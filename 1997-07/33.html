&gt; &gt; Some of the services in the inetd.conf are also open to buffer overflow
&gt; &gt; attack if you want to get serious about security, we had a customer using
&gt; &gt; a RH3 install (I think it was 3) that had the imapd uncommented in
&gt; &gt; inetd.conf and paid the price quite dearly.

&gt; relevant errata.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you know of any services which are supplied by Red Hat 4.2+updates
&gt; that are open to attack?  The hole in the imap server was fixed

Too late for me!  This is how a hacker dropped on my doorstep three weeks 
ago :-(  Now I am in the middle of building a new server just in case I 
didn't find all his/her trapdoors......

I have now disabled all unrequired services, used hosts.allow, 
hosts.deny, shadow passwords, drop source routes and better passwords!

Still its amazing just how long it takes to configure a new machine to 
do everything one that evolved over 4 years was doing.

My sugestion....

Get it right from the start and maybe you will not have to go through 
the pain of this task.

If you are not using it, don't run it and better still if you don't need 
it don't run it.

	Happy times,

PS This is the first detected un-welcome visitor I've had, that i know 
of in over 4 years of a full time connection to the Internet with Linux.
