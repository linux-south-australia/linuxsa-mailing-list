&gt; &gt; &gt; Also I want to setup my PPP link so that it operates between 9 and
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5, automatically bringing up the link at 9 and dropping it at 5 plus
&gt; &gt; &gt; having the ability to redial in the event of link failure.  How
&gt; &gt; &gt; would I go about doing this ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once you have the scripts, run 'crontab -e' and put in these two
&gt; &gt; lines:
&gt; &gt; 0 9 * * Mon-Fri /script/to/start/ppp
&gt; &gt; 0 17 * * Mon-Fri /script/to/stop/ppp
&gt; 
&gt; This will not bring your link up if it drops however unless there is an
&gt; option for pppd to stay online.

I wasn't sure if "having the ability to redial in the event of link
failure" meant that automatic redial was wanted or just the ability to
manually redial was wanted.  Manual redial is easy... just run
/script/to/start/ppp manually :).  Automatic redial is also easy if
netcfg is being used.  Check the box next to "Restart PPP when
connection fails" when configuring the PPP interface.

&gt; Is there an option for pppd to stay alive and redial - i know that in
&gt; comp.protocols.ppp there was talk of doing it.

I don't think pppd needs an option for redialing.  Have a look at the
ifup-ppp script that Red Hat uses.  The old Unix philosophy of "many
tools, each doing one job well" applies here I think.  pppd to support
the ppp protocol, and a while loop in your favourite scripting
language to support redialing.
