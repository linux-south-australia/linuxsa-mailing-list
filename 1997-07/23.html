I got asked via private email what exactly I did to calculate the
statistics on the age of the HOWTOs and kernel docs.  In case anyone
is interested, here 'tis.  It's not exactly what I did before; I
didn't write down what I did at the time, and I cleaned a couple of
things up a bit this time around :).

HOWTOs:

First extract the names and dates from the files (this is for csh):
cd /usr/doc/HOWTO
foreach file (*.gz)
echo -n $file
zcat $file | head -5 | grep '199[0-9]'
end
I then copied the above output into a document using the mouse.

Or if I was using zsh (or, theoretically bash, but it didn't work too
well when I tried it) I would have done this:
for file in *.gz; do
echo -n $file
zcat $file | head -5 | grep '199[0-9]'
done &gt; /tmp/howto-dates

Next I took a look through howto-dates and fixed the entry for
TeTeX-HOWTO (the names were put in the file so that I could see what
files any incorrectly extracted dates belonged too).

Then came:
vi /tmp/howto-dates
:1,$ s/^.*, [0-9]* //         get rid of the filenames and day numbers
:1,$ s/\(.*\) \(.*\)/\2 \1/   put the year before the month
:1,$ !sort -r                 sort into reverse alphabetical order
