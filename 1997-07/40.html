&gt; Hello all,
&gt; I'm trying reeeeal hard to move from the Big Bug (M$ W95) to Linux -
&gt; RH4.0 but having a few glitches (time restrictions being the main
&gt; offender).
Isn't time always the problem.

&gt; The problem I'm having at the moment is that I can successfully dial
&gt; into my ISP O.K. and can ftp, ssh and telnet, but can't surf. 
That indicates to me that your IP level config is fine.  Are you
connecting
to your ISP, or are you going out to the greater internet?  Are you
connecting
to an IP address or letting DNS resolve a name?

&gt; I've got Netscrape Navigator 3 (netscape 4-Communicator is too big and too
&gt; flaky for my liking) 
Big, yes it is, but Communicator 4.01b6 is *HEAPS* better, very few 
bus errors at all, *EVEN* with Java/Javascript enabled.  I'd recommend
it.

&gt; but I always get "Unable to find DNS entry" when
&gt; I fire it up.  It is refering to the proxy address of the ISP as well
&gt; as the home page on my ISP server I've set for it.  Here are my real
&gt; queries:
Sounds like your proxy config is confused.  BTW is it possible to post a 
complete display of the error.  If you are going through a proxy it does
the resolving for you (or at least some do I think).

&gt; 1) Is there a particular daemon(s) I need to have running?  I removed
&gt; a few from the startup sequence and might have removed one that is
&gt; needed!?!?
Don't think so.  The shouldn't need any daemons other than pppd to
connect
to an ISP at the IP level.  To get service connections you might need a 
daemon or two, but not for http.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Could it be my local IP address setup?  I'm running a local network
&gt; at home with this box using 10.0.0.x for it and the Win'95 and WFW3.11
&gt; boxes.
run the following commands and post the output (Before and after you
connect).
	
	ifconfig
	netstat -r

That could be your problem.
 
&gt; 3) What else could it be????
My method of attack would be to work up the networking layers.  You say
that
you have got limited IP connectivity...

1)	is IP working (and ICMP) technically.  Can you ping the outside
	world.  If not check routing and network interfaces.  If you try
	to ping and your modem lights don't blink you have routing problems.
	To try an address try 203.16.230.111 (the LinuxSA web server :).
	More importantly can you ping your DNS server?
2)	is DNS working (and hence UDP)?  Do a ping www.linuxsa.org.au :),
	that should resolve to 203.16.230.111 and have responses in the
	order of 200-500 ms (for a modem).
3)	Does TCP work?  Try telneting to a host lux.levels.unisa.edu.au is
	a local host I know will respond.  If you get to here then you 
	know that your networking is going fine.

4)	Now that your networking is fine, does your ISP allow non-proxied
	browsing.  If so try <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A> :).  If not double
	check your proxy settings, if your ISP is using a autoconfig proxy
	setup check the file ~/.netscape/proxyconf.  That should give you
	enough to get going.

My guess it would either be your routing or your proxy config.

&gt; 
&gt; I intend purchasing RH 4.2 in the near future and I'm sure that
&gt; installing it will 'fix' the problem but I'd rather understand what
&gt; the *^&(%^$ is going on so I can learn to administer a Linux system
&gt; correctly and set things up for others if necessary in the future.
*PLUG* *PLUG* well that is what LinuxSA is for... But you already know
that. 

&gt; I humbly beseech thy assistance oh gurus of the Computer New Age   :)
&gt; don.

Isn't a guru a person who lives in a dark dingy room, with too much
hair,
and survives on a religious diet of coke and pizza?

Have fun and good luck.

Matt
