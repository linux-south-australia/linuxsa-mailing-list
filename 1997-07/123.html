Hi 

Where is named run from in the init scripts. I am used to using the Slackware stuff, but it looks like every thing has moved in Red Hat :)

I want to setup named to run locally but reslove its names from the next name server. How do I go about this.
Will I still be able to used my 'hosts' file at all ?  Do I need to ?

Also on boot I have been noticing that I get the following message

Setting doman name to : (none)

Is there something wrong somewhere.... I thought I had its domain name set correctly.

Just one more for now :)

I have started to mess with httpd.  I have found the httpd.conf file and looked through it.  It looks similar to what I have played with before (cern), but I cannot find the definition that tells httpd what is the next proxy to talk to.  IE who is the next http server to send request to.

Thanx

	Peter Mc
