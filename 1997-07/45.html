&gt; &gt;&gt; So I've been told by a number of ppl now.  My impression was from an
&gt; earlier v4.x on the Sun box I'm using at work.  Crashing within 10
&gt; minutes of start-up is written in to the code of that version of
&gt; Communicator I think .  ;-)
That is why they call it beta-testing (although I think it was really
alpha, 
but netscape don't know their greek alphabet :)


&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; The problem was far, far, more complex than that.  Want to know what
&gt; it was?
&gt; weeeeeeell.........
&gt; 
&gt; I hadn't set up resolv.conf with the DNS entries.  That's it!  Nothing
&gt; tricky.  Just an ignorant user.   hehehehehe
&gt; Thanks to Wes 'The Wiz' Hosking for picking it straight off.  (He'll
&gt; thump me for mentioning him   |-O )
If you got to step two you would have found it... :)


&gt; 
&gt; I'm now happily surfin' away from my 486DX-33 Linux box, 32MB RAM,
&gt; and can tell you it's faster than my 686-P166+ Win'95 box with 48MB
&gt; RAM.  I'll get the hang of this Linux thing one day.  Now all I need
&gt; is to get 'makewhatis' working so I can genereate a database for
&gt; 'apropos' to use!  Hmmph.  I HATE those 'Directory or file does not
&gt; exist' type messages!  I've tried telling it where the directories are
&gt; but it still spits eg. 'makewhatis -v /usr/man /var/catman'.  It
&gt; processes the man pages then throws up the errors.  Ho Humm.
&gt; 
&gt; don.
On my machine, there is a cron entry which does makewhat is if my
machine
happens to be on at a certian time of day.  Works quite well...

Matt

PS See you all at the next meeting on Tuesday :).
