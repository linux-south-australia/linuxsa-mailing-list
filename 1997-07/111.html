&gt; or something like how to make your linux box more secure... covering
&gt; things
&gt; like.....
&gt; NIS, NFS, machines with no shell access, machines with limited shell
&gt; access
&gt; (some users can't get a shell) and machines with full shell access
&gt; (all
&gt; users can get a shell), how to stop hackers etc etc...
&gt; this could include a bit about appropriate use of permissions and
&gt; groups.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd mainly be interested in the 2nd topic because I am looking at
&gt; setting
&gt; up a machine so people can telnet in - but I want to stop them being
&gt; naughty and also want to limit how much they can use it etc etc....
&gt; 
&gt; just a few ideas there

I would be interested in doing this one.

Anybody want any particular areas covered?

Computer Security is a *HUGE* area.

If people want a series on different aspects of security then I am 
willing to look at a number of areas.

A couple of smaller areas are...

	o Stopping people getting in
	o Stopping people who supposed to be in doing naughties
	o Stopping people inadvertantly (or otherwise) letting people in.
	o General Administration for Security Guidelines

Of the above, the 4th one would probably be of most use to most people,
as it would touch on (ever so lightly) the other three.

Hmmm... Another topic coming...  File permissions under Linux...
It could cover setuid,setgid, sticky bit, (the LS output)...

And another... TCP/IP networking under Linux...
Routing, netstat, ports, ip, tcp, ifconfig....

These two would probably be a good basis for the security ones.
I personally think that you need a good basis before you start
on advanced topics.

I think that we could squeeze 4 meetings out of that topic.
Thanks Michael :).

Seriously, in terms of security, the generally safest way to 
secure a system is to start with *NOTHING* and then add *ONLY* 
things that you *NEED*.  That way you can evaluate what effect 
each thing you are adding has.  

It is limiting, but it is usually more secure.

Hope this meets with most peoples approval :)

'Nuff babbling
