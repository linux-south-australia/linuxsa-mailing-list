Thanx Steven but no luck I am afraid. I added debug to syslog.conf and got that working fine but the messages did not shed any light on my problem.  Just as before. Hangup at IP negotiation.  The speed is the same at 38400.

This is what the last few lines of the debuglog looks like

Using interface ppp0
Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; /dev/modem
Hangup (SIGHUP)
Modem hangup
Connection terminated.

Looks to me like a hangup at my end but why ????


&gt; First a thanx to a Geoffrey for my Domain name questions the other week, now I have more hassels with PPP.
&gt; (I'm sure this is a real new topic)  
&gt; 
&gt; I have trouble with the ppp-on script.  Every time I use it I get
&gt; through all the chat stuff no problem, but at the stage when ppp is
&gt; negotiating for the IP address the modem hangs up.  
&gt; I have had no luck getting pppd to log anything meaningful in
&gt; /var/log/messages (how is this done I know it is in syslog.conf but how
&gt; ???) .

In syslog.conf add "*.debug 	/var/log/debug"

Restart  syslog (or HUP it!)

add "debug" and maybe "-mn" in your /etc/ppp/options file

(The -mn is not to use magic numbers to detect a loopback in the network)

Make sure that your DTE rate is the same in ppp-on as you were trying when
you tried it with minicom  ie 38400

And you should be right.

	Regards Steven Ellison


&gt; 
&gt; I can successfully establish a link if I go through minicom and fire off 
&gt; pppd /dev/modem defaultroute
&gt; No problems, I can ping the world and everything,  just cannot get the damn script to work.
&gt; 
&gt; Even tried to use "ppd /dev/modem defaultroute" in the script but without success, same problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Your help appreciated
