Thnax Chris you were right on the money.  I get a lot of crap from my ISP before I actually get PPP dialog, so putting in the delay worked great.

Now the next question....

Does anyone know where I can get a pppdialer.  Now I know all about ppp-on etc, but I have used a pppdialer deamon that I download from somewhere that would call ppp-on when the link was down, and also call another script that was a keep alive ping.  When the link broke for whatever reason the deamon would recall the ppp-on script to bring back the link.  Does anyone know where I can fing this !!!  If I could only remember where I got it from I could sleep better tonight.

I am running RH 4.2 with no X (as I believe an X util can do this sort of thing)  I have found a dialer that is supost to be an on demand dialer but the damn makefile wont work.

Your help is appreciated

Perhaps you have a similar problem to one I had, being the time between
when the last extry in the ppp-on-dialer script is executed, and when
ppp frames are sent by the ISP.

Previously, password was the last entry, so I added to ppp-on-dialer:
	'IP addr'	''
which is sent a few lines prior to ppp starting.
It delays pppd starting and gives time to pick up the IP address.

Hope this helps.
