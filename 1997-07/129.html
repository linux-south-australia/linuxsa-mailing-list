&gt;My wife's machine is running win95 and Wingate2 software as a proxy
&gt;server (of sorts).  We are connected using a couple of 3com 3C503
&gt;cards.    Normally she is online most of the night with an unlimited
&gt;type PPP account and I just run my win95 email prog (Agent) on my
&gt;machine which gathers all my mail through her Wingate setup.
&gt;
&gt;This scheme has led to me being dependant on my Win95 setup for net
&gt;access so Linux only gets a look in when I'm really bored.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I couldn't see why it wouldn't work at my end using Linux so I
&gt;gave it a shot.   Limited success with me being able to post via SMTP
&gt;through her machine and being able to telnet to remote sites through
&gt;her machine.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't quite got the settings right for accessing my pop mail
&gt;account  though.   This is probably due to a lack of practice with
&gt;Linux/Unix type mail transfer agents.
&gt; 
&gt;I'm aware that the Linux machine would probably be a better choice for
&gt;the Net connection but my SO uses a couple of programs that just won't
&gt;cope through a LAN.
First of all - I reccommend using your linux machine to connect to the 
internet, and then just recompile your kernel to include ip 
masquerading, and enable ip masquerading. 
I use these lines in /etc/rc.d/rc.local

ipfwadm -F -v -p deny
ipfwadm -F -v -a m -S 192.168.0.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0

You'll prolly want to the load the various modules, etc. 
/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp
/sbin/modprobe ip_masq_irc
etc.

Then just set the win95 machine to use your linux machine as a gateway 
in the tcp/ip config in the network section in the control panel.
(ie. your netcard should have something like 192.168.0.1 as its address 
- your ppp device should get a dynamic IP I assume, which will be 
seperate. Assign the netcard in the win95 machine an ip like 
192.168.0.2, with a gateway of 192.168.0.1) To test the link, try 
telnetting to your linux machine (at 192.168.0.1) from the win95 
machine, when neitehr is connected tio the intenet.

-----------------------
Alternatively, to make your linux machine use the win95 to goto the 
internet, you should really only have to change the gateway settings on 
your netcard...However, I haven't really tried this direction in 
practice, so I am just assuming that wingate works like ipfwadm for 
linux does. (To change the gateway, just fiddle with ifconfig a 
little.))

...Careful with that axe, Eugene!
