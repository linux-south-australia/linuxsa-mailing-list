&gt; &gt; For rlogin, rsh, telnet, talk, the best way is to edit /etc/inetd.conf
&gt; &gt; and put a hash mark ("#") at the start of the appropriate line, then
&gt; &gt; restart inetd ("ps aux | grep inetd" and
&gt; &gt; "kill -1 whatever-inetd's-pid-is").  This leaves those servers
&gt; &gt; installed, but they can't be used.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a coarse form of access control, you can also look at the man page
&gt; for tcpd and hosts_access (5) - format of host access control files.
&gt; This allows per host/service control for these services which is nice and
&gt; safe depebding on who you trust ! Compiling with source route disabled
&gt; should also stop most spoofing attacks on the host.

Yup.  So depending on your needs:

fine control: vi /etc/hosts.{allow,deny}
medium control: vi /etc/inetd.conf
coarse control: rm /usr/sbin/inetd :)

&gt; Some of the services in the inetd.conf are also open to buffer overflow
&gt; attack if you want to get serious about security, we had a customer using
&gt; a RH3 install (I think it was 3) that had the imapd uncommented in
&gt; inetd.conf and paid the price quite dearly.

:(.  This is why anyone who cares about their networked Red Hat system
should be subscribed to redhat-announce and stay current with the
relevant errata.

Do you know of any services which are supplied by Red Hat 4.2+updates
that are open to attack?  The hole in the imap server was fixed
3-Mar-97.

&gt; &gt; Nope.  That is the beauty of PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module).
&gt; &gt; Anything compiled to use it (like Red Hat's telnet, ftp, samba, etc
&gt; &gt; servers) will use whatever authentication scheme you have installed.
&gt; 
&gt; What type of support does RH have for PAM, can you radius calls ?

The software shipped with Red Hat Linux fully supports PAM AFAIK; it's
just a matter of having the appropriate PAM modules.  There is at
least a radius accounting module.  See /usr/doc/pam-*/html/pam-6.html.

The first few sections of rfc86.0.txt ("Unified Login with Pluggable
Authentication Modules (PAM)") (also in /usr/doc/pam-*/) looks to be
an interesting read for anyone interested in PAM.
