Hi all,

NetCraft have available a number of new products from Red Hat
Software:

Red Hat's Triteal Common Desktop Environment (CDE) 1.2 is a complete,
friendly graphical user interface, giving you the same "look and feel"
as CDE for other Unix systems.  CDE is available in two versions.  The
Client Edition gives you everything you need to operate a complete
licensed copy of the CDE desktop.  The Developer's Edition also
includes a complete copy of OSF/Motif 1.2.5 providing you with
everything you need to create CDE-aware applications for any X system
platform.  Both versions include a CD-ROM, a printed Advanced User's
Guide, and extensive on-line documentation.  Red Hat's Triteal CDE is
compatible with all major Linux distributions (Red Hat, Slackware,
Debian, Caldera, etc) and all major X servers (XFree86, Metro-X, and
Accelerated-X).

Red Hat Motif 2.0.1 is a full OSF/Motif development system.  This new
version includes the KL Group's XRT Professional Developer's Suite
(PDS), a package of market-leading widgets and utilities for
professional Motif developers.  The PDS has a retail value of $5000,
but it is provided at no extra cost with Red Hat Motif 2.0.1.

Maximum RPM is the official, definitive technical reference book for
Red Hat's package management technology.  It provides accurate and
detailed coverage of RPM's history, philosophy, usage, and internals,
from both the user and packager perspectives.  New users of RPM will
learn how to install and upgrade packages, perform sophisticated
queries, and verify your RPM-based system.  Packagers will learn how
to build packages that are easy to use and maintain, as well as
advanced packaging techniques.

We also have the full range of Red Hat T-Shirts: the white "Running
Man" T-Shirt, the blue Red Hat T-Shirt, and the new black "Maximum
RPM" T-Shirt.

Other products available include the Red Hat Linux Official Boxed Set,
the Red Hat Power Tools/Archives 6-CD Set, Applixware, the Red Hat
Linux Library CD, the printed Linux Man Pages, and more.

Orders can be delivered at LinuxSA meetings, picked up from us in Eden
Hills, shipped by Overnight Express courier or by Australia Post, and
we accept payment by Bankcard, Mastercard, Visa, or COD.

any of the products we sell, see <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com.au/redhat/">http://www.netcraft.com.au/redhat/</A> ,
