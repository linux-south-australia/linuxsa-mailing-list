&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I am running RH 4.2 and wish to change the domain name.  I have
&gt; found /etc/HOSTMANE as a good starting point and the /etc/hosts file
&gt; is done but where else does it need it ?  I have noticed that the
&gt; httpd is complaining as is sendmail which takes forever to boot!

Hi Peter,

/etc/HOSTNAME isn't really a good starting point as it is not used by
any of Red Hat's startup scripts.  You should change it in case it is
used by any other programs, but Red Hat gets all its network config
stuff from /etc/sysconfig/network and
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/*.  The one you want in particular is
/etc/sysconfig/network; there's a line "HOSTNAME=your.f.q.d.n" that
you should change.

The reason for httpd and sendmail complaining/going slow is that they
couldn't find your hostname in the /etc/hosts file.

&gt; I know it can be done from the install but how do I rerun that
&gt; without going throught the whole boot/installation all over again.

The other way of changing your hostname is to run netcfg, click in the
"Hostname" text field, type the new hostname, then click "Save" and
"Quit".

&gt; Also I want to setup my PPP link so that it operates between 9 and
&gt; 5, automatically bringing up the link at 9 and dropping it at 5 plus
&gt; having the ability to redial in the event of link failure.  How
&gt; would I go about doing this ?

Create two cron jobs; one to run at 9am that calls the script that
starts up your PPP link, and one to run at 5pm that calls the script
that shuts down your PPP link.

Do you have scripts to do those two jobs?  If not, the easiest way is
to setup your PPP link through netcfg.

Once you have the scripts, run 'crontab -e' and put in these two
lines:
0 9 * * Mon-Fri /script/to/start/ppp
0 17 * * Mon-Fri /script/to/stop/ppp

&gt; Don't want much do I !! :)

Piece of cake :).

Regards,
