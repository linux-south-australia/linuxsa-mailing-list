&gt; 1. Running Samba from my linux server, I've created a section in the
&gt; smb.conf <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
&gt; [lukesdir]
&gt;   	comment = bla
&gt; 	path = /
&gt; 	valid users = luke
&gt; 	public = no
&gt; 	writable = yes
&gt; 	printable = no
&gt; 
&gt; When I try to log on from (dare I say it) a W95 machine, creating a mapped
&gt; network drive from Windows Explorer, I type in  my password *******, but it
&gt; doesn't get me through.

Will it work if you take out the "valid users" line?

Anything relevant appear in the log files?  It might be worthwhile
turning up the debug level.

&gt; 2. Connecting from anywhere on the Internet to my own machine with telnet
&gt; as root doesn't work.
&gt; How do I do this? Anyone? 

It's not meant to work.  You are meant to log in as yourself, then
"su" to root.  The reasoning behind this is that even if someone
discovers your root password they can't do anything unless they have
another account that they can log into first.  Not that allowing
telnet access into your machine from anywhere on the Internet is a
good idea anyway (use ssh instead, get it from ftp.replay.com).

That said, if you *really* want to do it and you don't care about
security, then add ttyp0, ttyp1, ttyp2, etc to /etc/securetty.  This
file contains the list of terminals on which root is allowed to login.
