<H1>Linux as a Wingate Client</H1>

<PRE>
Just been experimenting with Linux as a Wingate2 client machine and
wondering if anyone else has tried this succesfully. The wingate
mailing list seems to have died.

My wife's machine is running win95 and Wingate2 software as a proxy
server (of sorts).  We are connected using a couple of 3com 3C503
cards.    Normally she is online most of the night with an unlimited
type PPP account and I just run my win95 email prog (Agent) on my
machine which gathers all my mail through her Wingate setup.

This scheme has led to me being dependant on my Win95 setup for net
access so Linux only gets a look in when I'm really bored.

Anyway, I couldn't see why it wouldn't work at my end using Linux so I
gave it a shot.   Limited success with me being able to post via SMTP
through her machine and being able to telnet to remote sites through
her machine.

I haven't quite got the settings right for accessing my pop mail
account  though.   This is probably due to a lack of practice with
Linux/Unix type mail transfer agents.
 
I'm aware that the Linux machine would probably be a better choice for
the Net connection but my SO uses a couple of programs that just won't
cope through a LAN.
