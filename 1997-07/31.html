&gt; Franco,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep - I had some problems too but don't remember the one you describe. 
&gt;  Mine were fixed with the help of Geoffrey Bennett - meaning I watched in 
&gt; awe as he did his magic :-)

I think your problem was that the directory the gimp libraries were
installed into wasn't listed in /etc/ld.so.conf.  No magic here...
just add the name of the directory to that file and run 'ldconfig'.

&gt; Anyway, couple of questions...
&gt; 
&gt; Are you using Redhat Linux?
&gt; Did you download gimp as a RPM file or as a tar.gz?

To install gimp from the RPMs available at ftp.redhat.com (and various
mirrors), you need:
gimp-0.99.10-1.i386.rpm
gtk-0.99.10-1.i386.rpm
as well as gimp-data-0.99.9.tar.gz from the Gimp ftp site:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/gimp/developers/">ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/gimp/developers/</A>

After installing gimp and gtk, install gimp-data, then move it to
/usr/whatever instead of /usr/local/whatever and also rename it to
0.99.10.

Another package that will probably be of use is
gimp-freefonts-0.99.10-1.i386.rpm -- it is a collection of scalable
fonts for use with X/gimp/ghostscript/etc.

&gt; how you doing?  Hope you may be able to help me.  I downloaded Gimp
&gt; the other day and am trying to install it, but unfortunately, i am having
&gt; lots
&gt; of trouble.  Everytime I run make I get some errors re unable to find
&gt; certain files (ie linux/time.h)  Did you have any problems and if so, how
&gt; did you
&gt; go about fixing them?

That sounds like you don't have the libc-devel and/or kernel-headers
packages installed.

Regards,
