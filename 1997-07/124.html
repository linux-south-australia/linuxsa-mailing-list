&gt; Where is named run from in the init scripts. I am used to using the

/etc/rc.d/rc?.d/S55named.init which is a symlink to /etc/rc.d/init.d

&gt; I want to setup named to run locally but reslove its names from the next
&gt; name server. How do I go about this.  Will I still be able to used my
&gt; 'hosts' file at all ?  Do I need to ? 

Meaning ??? Do you want to run it as a caching only server, ok, see the
DNS (-caching ??) howto which explains this very well.

WRT hosts, make sure you have hosts still in the order line of you
/etc/host.conf file.  You can change the nameserver you reference by
editing /etc/resolv.conf

&gt; Also on boot I have been noticing that I get the following message
&gt; 
&gt; Setting doman name to : (none)

&gt; Is there something wrong somewhere.... I thought I had its domain name
&gt; set correctly. 

This could be the nis domain name which you needn't worry about.  If you
check /etc/sysconfig/network this is where you will find your DOMAINNAME
and HOSTNAME definitions.


Cannot help you with the below.  
&gt; Just one more for now :)  

&gt; I have started to mess with httpd.  I have found the httpd.conf file and
&gt; oked rough it.  It looks similar to what I have played with before
&gt; (cern), t I cannot find the definition that tells httpd what is the next
&gt; proxy
&gt;  talk to.  IE who is the next http server to send request to. 

Sorry about the crosspost but I though it would be useful for beginners to
RH.
