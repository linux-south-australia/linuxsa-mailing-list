Hello all Linux-sa members,

I run the ISP, InterWeb Connections, and recently attended the Lotus Notes
InterWeb conference in Melbourne (June).

One of the questions I asked the head of Notes development, who was there,
was whether they are considering/have considered porting to Linux.

He didn't _actually_ laugh at me, but he indicated that the fact that Linux
is used little in commercial environments (from an IBM point of view),
pretty much means that they won't be porting it.

However, as hinted at below, I believe that the code would be sufficiently
portable since notes server is already available on OS/2, Win NT, Solaris,
Netware, AIX and SCO.

But IBM is not going to do it unless enough people ask for it.

I encourage anybody who has used notes to reply to Evan, and lets see if we
can get it ported. Notes is potentially one of the best Internet Tools
IMHO, and I don't want to install an NT box, just to run it {grin}.

&gt; I was in conversation recently with someone who has been talking to IBM
&gt; (at an appropiately high level) about porting Notes to Linux. That person
&gt; told me that *any* testimonials about potential end-users who would buy
&gt; Notes for Linux would be instrumental in convincing IBM to make it happen.
&gt; There are no technical issues; this is only a matter of marketing and
&gt; convincing the sales folk.
&gt; 
&gt; While I personally have no use for Notes, I believe its availability for
&gt; Linux would be both an important application and yet another validation
&gt; of Linux's suitability for corporate use.
&gt; 
&gt; Please personally e-mail me any relevant information and I promise to
&gt; pass it on ASAP, added to a few stories of my own...
