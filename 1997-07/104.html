I was thinking about the idea of having a talk on two computer networking
for the next meeting. Sounds like a great idea, I'm very interested in
learning more about this. I'm trying to get a second computer here so I
can try it myself, but I haven't got the parts yet (anyone got an old 386
or parts they don't want?? :)

Anyway. I had a bit of a crazy idea, someone with lots of diskspace and
bandwidth could archive stuff like the latest contrib RPMS, latest
Netscape versions, Debian packages, popular games and utilities etc etc
and bring their machine to each meeting.

Anyone who wanted to could then bring their network card equipped PC to a
meeting and quickly copy all the latest linux stuff onto their own system.
I don't know about you guys, but my live internet access is sporadic at
best (a borrowed account), and even when I can use it, the size of the
latest netscape and other programs means I can't really easily get them.

So at the conclusion of the network talk we could get people PC's setup
for the network, and once they are setup, next meeting they can bring them
in ready to go and slurp software while the meeting is in progress :) 

Would also be great for Redhat/Debian upgrades.

What's the concensus? Am I crazy or not? :)
