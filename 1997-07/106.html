&gt;Anyway. I had a bit of a crazy idea, someone with lots of diskspace and
&gt;bandwidth could archive stuff like the latest contrib RPMS, latest
&gt;Netscape versions, Debian packages, popular games and utilities etc etc
&gt;and bring their machine to each meeting.

along these lines - i have LOTS of bandwidth.... so if someone wants has a
machine (maybe we could all provide a few bits and peices and get a machine
together) we can then d/l everything - someone could just dial-in and do
it.... then i'll bring it to each meeting....

&gt;Anyone who wanted to could then bring their network card equipped PC to a
&gt;meeting and quickly copy all the latest linux stuff onto their own system.
&gt;I don't know about you guys, but my live internet access is sporadic at
&gt;best (a borrowed account), and even when I can use it, the size of the
&gt;latest netscape and other programs means I can't really easily get them.

if anyone wants to do this sort of thing i should have a machine set-up
soon.... and depending on where dynasol move to we might have a high speed
link there anyway.... that would mean we can get something going with a
machine here.... have it download during the month - and then just plug
into the LAN and suck it down from here :)

&gt;So at the conclusion of the network talk we could get people PC's setup
&gt;for the network, and once they are setup, next meeting they can bring them
&gt;in ready to go and slurp software while the meeting is in progress :) 
&gt;
&gt;Would also be great for Redhat/Debian upgrades.

i would see this as the main use..... also i will soon have a spareish
machine..... so we can perhaps do some remote admin and do sumthing
there.... maybe sumthing to do at meetings... i dunno....

&gt;What's the concensus? Am I crazy or not? :)

more than likely..... but so am i :)
