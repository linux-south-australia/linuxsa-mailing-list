Sorry I didn't know the html mail thing was a can of worms... I'll 
shutup after this, but there are a few things I can't help but respond 
to... and, emotive language aside, my question still stands, to send a 
formatted file, with pretty colours and pictures what could be less 
bandwidth abusive and more platform independent than html?

&lt;boring html thread ;)&gt;

&gt;The Ludds were fabric and clothing makers who were being put out of
&gt;business and their livelihood because of the newly created industrial
&gt;weaving machines. They weren't destroying technology as such, they were
&gt;destroying that which was destroying their livelihood.
&gt;  
&gt;
You learn something every day ;)

&gt;As usual, someone misses my point. People don't generally use it to mark
&gt;anything up. It's blatant bandwidth usage.
&gt;
Is it really a matter of bandwidth? I can't see that... I mean from a 
group of people who download entire operating systems over the internet, 
surely some html tags, which are text anyway aren't a significant 
burden. I'd rather get a message in html than in pdf or postscript or 
some other binary format.

The thing about html messages is that they are a fucking nuisance to 
read if you are using a mail handler that a) doesn't read the tags or b) 
doesn't strip them. Especially if you get an email from someone using 
Outlook that puts tags after every letter... but people love their 
colours, and while you can stop them from coming though LinuxSA I guess 
we all have to deal with a general population that does and will use 
html in emails, without ever knowing it.

&lt;/boring html thread&gt;

Daniel.
