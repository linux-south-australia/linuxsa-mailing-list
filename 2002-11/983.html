An interesting take on the topic;

"There has been much discussion about the security vulnerability rates 
between Windows and Linux. Firstly, let me state that this focus on 
pure numbers and graph plots of vulnerabilities is pointless. There is 
no such thing as a truly secure operating system, there is only the 
ongoing process of keeping a host or network secure. One can never 
achieve a state of 'security Nirvana'. Think of it as a treadmill, 
constantly moving you (as a system administrator) backwards. You have 
to 'walk' forward just to keep still. If you don't move forward with 
security patches, security tools, revamped system security processes, 
you'll be flung off the end of the treadmill from sheer inactivity, and 
by the way, the crackers have access to the treadmill's speed control 
knob, and keep pushing up the speed. 

As an ancillary, all operating systems can be made 'secure', by 
whatever reckoning you attribute to this term. It all boils down to 
time, effort, money and will. What is security worth to you and your 
network? Some operating systems seem to need more of these, some less. 
They all need some. 
"
"This means that based on just this simple analysis, a modern Linux 
distribution ships with approximately 20 times more functionality in 
the box than Microsoft ships with Windows 2000 Server. Note, this is 
just a count of approximate  functionality. With the hundreds of 
millions of lines of source code shipping for these platforms, a much 
deeper analysis would be un-tenable. When one does a quick and dirty 
calculation therefore, Linux on a per-atomic-functionality basis, can 
be viewed as being 20 times more secure than Windows, i.e it ships with 
20 times as much materiel, but releases approximately the same number 
of security alerts as Windows. 

If this analysis proves anything, it's that this simple-minded churning 
of numbers is pointless. 
"

And that is as good a place as any to leave this discussion &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
