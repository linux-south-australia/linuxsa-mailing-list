&gt;&gt; &gt;I would use Linux (in any case) because:
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;5/ Better application (and OS) install processes
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Much as I hate to say this:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Windoze: Run something called setup.exe. Click Next a few times.
&gt;&gt; Reboot (probably). Fire up new application. Works. (except you can't
&gt;&gt; read the help files if your system background colour is black, or some
&gt;&gt; similar fault which you just have to put up with)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Linux: Unzip tarball. Bugger about with config files, Makefiles etc.
&gt;&gt; Compile. Compilation breaks. Hack something. Compile. Breaks again in
&gt;&gt; different place. Hack again. (repeat...............................)
&gt;&gt; Install. Try it. Doesn't work. Hack something. Try again.
&gt;&gt; (repeat.................) Write tear-stained post to list begging for
&gt;&gt; help...
&gt;
&gt;:) Yeah don't you just love that..
&gt;Then you are building an application totally from the source code, that
&gt;will be optimised to your systems processor, libraries and any other
&gt;options you pass to configure and make... Which is not even an option
&gt;with that other mob..

I _do_ love it! Problem is that there are so many possible options -
so many possible different system configurations, different
architectures, different OSes - that the software is trying to
support, that it's impossible for anyone to test all of them, and I
usually find that something somewhere breaks, or at least "works a bit
funny".
&gt;
&gt;Or you might have gone "apt-get install xxxxx" and got pretty much the
&gt;same result without even thinking about a reboot.(You wouldn't have even
&gt;had to look for an exe anything.)
&gt;
Much better, as a lot of the variables are removed. But you still have
to get the box online, which is daunting in Linux to someone who's new
to computers and/or doesn't want to mess about in the works; with
Windoze you can get CDs at the supermarket which do it all for you and
set up an account with an ISP at the same time.

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Installing Windoze 98 takes about an hour and a pot of tea. Installing
&gt;&gt; X 4.2 has taken me two days so far and the mouse doesn't work (which
&gt;&gt; is fairly vital) - incompatible with the supplied protocols, but it
&gt;&gt; works in Windoze as a "Standard PS/2 Mouse".
&gt;
&gt;What dist are you using. ??? 
Debian 2.1

&gt;More importantly what type of mouse ?
A "Trust Ami Track Dual Scroll" trackball, 3 buttons, 2 scroll wheels,
PS/2 interface. It's supposed to be Intellimouse compatible according
to Trust, but it isn't. Windoze' "Standard PS/2 Mouse" works it OK
apart from the scroll wheels. Trust supply Windoze drivers, but not
Linux ones (I didn't know this when I bought it...)

&gt;You have tried the gui tools for this ?
&gt;man XF86Setup
&gt;or just run it from the consol.
I used xf86config to get started, then hacked /etc/X11/XF86Config
directly.

&gt;Check your /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file mouse section looks something like
&gt;this: &lt;quote my INTELLIMOUSE &gt;
&lt;snip&gt;
Very similar but without the gpm option (gpm doesn't work with it
either...)

By hexdumping /dev/psaux and comparing the result with
xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/input/mouse/mouse.c, it seems that
"Intellimouse compatible" is rubbish. It looks very similar to
BusMouse protocol in fact. Trying BusMouse protocol in
/etc/X11/XF86Config didn't work though (not too surprising). I ended
up hacking the above mouse.c (and a few other files) to insert a new
protocol. (Which proves the superiority of Linux!) The amount of extra
code is small; I'll post it when I've tested it a bit more (can't test
the horizontal scroll wheel until I install something to use it in!)
for the benefit of anyone else with one of these things.

Thanks for your suggestions!

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's personal preference. I prefer the Linux way because I _can_
&gt;&gt; hack things if I want to, but I could never pretend it's easier.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Well, having tried to get things beyond "standard" working on WIN
&gt;(drivers etc for video, monitors, particular MultiMedia cards) I would
&gt;have to say that I know which I prefer..
&gt;
&gt;However, I will readily concede that Win cam take a AUD 3 - 5K box and
&gt;easily make it behave like a AUD 1.5 - 2K box. It does that REALLY well
&gt;:) Most people are happy with that ( in the short term ) and I for one
&gt;and happy to let them continue on that track.. (It's good enough for
&gt;most people) . Then I like to have my car tuned twice a year as well..
&gt;and it's a beat up old Holden... So who am I to say :)
&gt;

It does occur to me that we may be talking about slightly different
situations... I am usually installing Windoze 98SE on secondhand
Pentia which mostly came out before Win98 did, so it supports them
just fine; if they have oddball hardware, again it's usually old
enough that a driver that works properly with Win98 has been out for
some time. The people who use these boxes mostly care about using the
same sort of software that everybody else is using or that they use at
work, and are doing really basic things like using MS Word and
Internet Exploder. MS make sure these work (as well as they make sure
that anything works) because _everyone_ uses them. As you say, it's
good enough for most people. I couldn't persuade them to use Linux cos
they wouldn't understand what I was on about ("what's an operating
system?")

Plus, it's much more common for a hardware manufacturer to fail to
support Linux than to fail to support Windoze, though fortunately they
seem to be learning.

Linux performance is great, of course. Comparing the speed of PSPICE
circuit simulator running in protected mode using DPMI on DOS 6.22 -
single-tasking, so the app has the whole of the machine's resources to
itself - with spice3f4 in Linux, there's nothing in it. PSPICE is
faster on some things, spice3f4 on others.

spice3f4, by the way, is a good example of problems caused by not
testing all the multitude of different systems it might have to cope
with. The system it was written on apparently doesn't mind if you
fclose a file that has already been closed, or free a block of memory
that has already been freed. Mine, on the other hand, segfaults. This
means changing an awful lot of fclose()s and free()s. There is
evidence in the code that someone else has done this before, but more
code has been written later that has not been cleaned up. Aargh!
