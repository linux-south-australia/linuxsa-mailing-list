Hi All,
    Doesn't this miss the point completely about open
source? If you make some company pay for using your code,
shouldn't you shell out when you take other peoples code and
use it? I am sure that Lindows has put a bucket load of
money into it's product, but haven't other people and
companies benefitted and helped? Are you trying to tell me
that Lindows has SOLELY created open source code with their
$ under the GPL with absolutely ZERO help? Even if they
have, are they paying for the other developers that they are
effectively leaching from using their OSS/GPL code? What
about other companies who spend heaps on development? Red
Hat spends $ on developing code, but they leach others code
for their distribution. Under the GPL and OSS concept
models, I can legally copy their distro and sell it as is -
even undercut their price and they cannot do anything about
it. What about Mandrake, who copied RH and modified the code
and now compete?

    Now I agree that some code MAY not fit the OSS model.
This tends to be niche stuff or should be closed for other
reasons. But if you release it under the GPL, then it is
either GPL or not. If you want to stop others from profiting
from your work - fine, create your own license, but don't
complain if others take your code and use it and/or modify
it if it is GPL. One of the things that makes OSS work is
that people CAN modify it for their own means and this is
part of what makes development happen so rapidly. As soon as
you close source some part of it, then you are stuck with
that model and all of the costs and problems associated with
it. The OSS model is by no means perfect either, but RH
still seems to be making money. I bet the guy who invented
TCP/IP is really pissed off he didn't license it
differently, but then again, would TCP/IP be the standard if
he did license it for money? Basically it comes down to you
can't have your cake and eat it too.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Re: A licensing idea


I actually didn't write those amendments for myself. I did
it because I feel that  the idea needs to be developed
further along those lines. Anyway, I don't want to sell
anything really, its not even my profession.

This is what I wanted to accomplish, its gutsy, but I think
it still needs to be done.

Here is a concrete example. According to the executives at
Lindows, they have put about $1 Million dollars into Wine.

However, a brand new company can go out and deliver a
product that is just as good as Lindows, having _not paid_
the $1 Million dollars.

But what I am saying, is that the developer should have some
of his costs reimbursed. The only way to do that is to embed
the cost in the license, otherwise the company.

I am also saying that projects that make our software should
be able to collect some funding if all the distributors do
is download the source and throw a logo on a cd. If they
make the product work better, no royalties to pay.

Sometimes development has to be conducted by a single
company. If it is a collaboration, as I think it should be,
then one could argue that its a public benefit, thus the cap
at 10.

I also wanted to send a message to for profit companies,
saying, if you port your application to Linux, you won't
have to pay people to develop software for other people.

On the other hand, I wanted things to stay the same for
people that create software on their spare time.

1.  Let companies announce that they are considering opening
up their source depending upon how much the community
supports them.

2. Eliminate the unfair way costs are spread in the
community.

3. Send the hardware driver manufacturers a message, that we
don't need source to use their drivers.

4. Preserve the open source way of doing things, for parties
without a profit motive.

5. Get companies to open their legacy application source
code.

Anyway, the only lesson Lindows learned was that they should
_not_ put money into R&D.

As a desktop user I certainly don't want that. I want all of
the Linux Distributors to put money into improving the
operating system's user friendliness, so there won't be as
many "Outsiders."

You could just release it under the GPL (which was
written by a professional) with a stipulation that
other licences can be negotiated with the copyright owner.
