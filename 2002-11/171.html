Mac OS X "Least Prone to Attack"
By Remy Davison, Insanely Great Mac
October 31st 2002

OS X thrashes Linux, Windows in the security stakes.

Government departments, armed services, business, take note: a report 
by technology risk management company mi2g Ltd., which will be released 
today, says the Mac OS is the platform least vulnerable to hackers.

mi2g's report states that of over 1,100 software vulnerabilities 
identified for the period Jan-Oct 2002, "fewer than 25 were 
attributable to the Macintosh operating system".

Performing equally well were other Unix variants: Compaq's Tru64 and 
SCO Unix. Microsoft's Windows trailed the field with over 500 
vulnerabilities. 200 vulnerabilities were identified in Linux systems.

Exceptionally few attacks were mounted against Macintosh hardware, with 
31 attacks recorded (0.5% of all digital attacks).

Folks, how many times have we seen statistics like this bunch.

When they show stats based on the real numbers of systems out there 
(market share) versus the real number of attacks they have sustained 
then we can see just how secure these systems are. 

What is your take on this?

Cheers,  Ian
