Michael's Minutes:
Get A Discount On Microsoft(R) Windows XP When You Buy LindowsOS(TM) 
  
 Q: How do you get the best price possible for Microsoft
 software?

 A: Buy LindowsOS computers or sign-up as a Builder and then
 negotiate with the Microsoft sales rep.

 Microsoft is threatened by LindowsOS and has quietly
 instituted an initiative to attempt to undercut Lindows.com
 in key accounts in order to block our growth. Here's how it
 works. Microsoft sales representatives have been instructed
 to be on the lookout for businesses or OEMs (computer
 manufacturers) who are migrating some of their machines to
 LindowsOS. If they believe there's a credible threat for a
 substantial installation of LindowsOS computers, they can
 request authorization to offer radically lower prices in an
 attempt to stem the adoption of LindowsOS. The discounts are
 not a measly 2% or 5% but substantially greater --
 potentially more than 50% off previous pricing levels. These
 are massive price cuts rarely, if ever, seen before for
 Microsoft products.

 The program goes under such cleverly disguised names as
 "competitive pricing" and "marketing development funds". To
 qualify, businesses have to have an installation of
 LindowsOS machines and/or sign-up for the LindowsOS builder
 program (www.lindows.com/builders) and convince the
 Microsoft sales representative that your business is placing
 an even larger order of LindowsOS products. Armed with this
 information, it's possible to negotiate radical discounts on
 Microsoft products.

 Some may wonder how Microsoft can offer competitive pricing
 given the Judge's anti-trust ruling restricting them from
 offering preferential pricing terms to OEMs due to illegal
 pricing policies of the past. The ruling only pertained to
 the top 20 OEMs, not to other manufacturers. This means that
 the thousands of small to medium size OEMs can obtain
 sweetheart pricing while Microsoft's larger customers,
 theoretically, cannot receive these major discounts since
 the ruling requires Microsoft to give the same terms to
 their top 20 customers. (But those top 20 accounts can
 easily circumvent this barrier by using a subsidiary to
 demand the competitive pricing terms.)

 Aggressive pricing competition is normally a good sign that
 capitalism and the free market are working. Unfortunately,
 Microsoft has the ability to use the billions of dollars
 they've taken from consumers and businesses with their
 illegal monopoly to fend off new competitors, like
 Lindows.com, making it tough for new companies to gain
 momentum. For computer manufacturers, we're confident that
 our no-hassle, automated, online licensing program to ship
 an unlimited number of computers for just $500 a month (with
 no additional fees) will be enticing. And, hopefully, the
 newly-released LindowsOS 3.0 with its one-click software
 installation Click-N-Run (www.lindows.com/warehouse) service
 will attract customers who want an affordable product that
 fulfills all their basic software needs - including working
 with Microsoft formatted documents for one low price.

 Our goal at Lindows.com is to bring "choice" back to the
 desktop computer. Our belief is that if given a choice many
 of you will choose the affordable LindowsOS product line-up
 which costs a fraction of Microsoft products. If your choice
 is to continue to use Microsoft products, we hope you are
 able to negotiate a better price than in the past and for
 goodness' sake, make sure you keep your virus software up to
 date! :^)

Sincerely,
Michael Robertson
