&gt; Say we have a fairly large wan and want to monitor it all.  at the moment
&gt; i've just got a few web pages i threw together to ping stuff using fping and
&gt; show up some green or red lights.  works fine.  but i want some software
&gt; that will go exploring through a network with a given range and maps it all.
&gt; ideally it should shove out some html so you can have a monitoring service
&gt; machine running and check it from anywhere.

Have you looked at nmap2nagios?

&gt; If i want to write a script or something that does this exploration that i
&gt; want, what on earth would i use to generate the graphics for a web page.

I wouldn't get carried away with graphics.  The maps are useful
for newcomers, but text screens tend to be more useful once people
know the topology.

 &gt; all i want to monitor is basically a periodic ping as we don't care about
 &gt; services at this stage...

You'll need to monitor at least the DNS service.

&gt; i've used jpgragh to generate a graph of ping times with averages, quite
&gt; proud of that  :)
&gt; cheers to the jpgraph boys.

More commonly, MRTG is used to monitor SNMP variables independently
of Nagios.  The number of SNMP variables you need to monitor for
capacity planning and finding the cause of faults is truly astounding
and you don't want all these cluttering up Nagios.

The other bit of recommended software is gnokki and a old mobile
phone.  Then nagios can SMS you with network faults, even when the
network is really, really broken.

Installing good network monitoring and recording is really,
really worth the effort.  Every time AARNet extends its
network monitoring efforts we find out something really
useful -- to the extent that we've improved TCP goodput
on the network by 4 or 5 times.  Put another way, we could
be paying for five times the current capacity if we had
less monitoring.
