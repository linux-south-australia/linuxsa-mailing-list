&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the last year I've been forced on occasion to use a Microsoft-based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MUA.  In order to display a number of things, I had to use it in full-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; screen mode.  That meant, however, that the displayed lines were about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 200 characters long, and there was nothing I could do about it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds rather like what you had to read could not have been
&gt;&gt;&gt; presented in plain text at all.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What gives you that idea?  It was perfectly normal, unembellished
&gt;&gt; text.  The issue is that these toys are so subdivided that you can't
&gt;&gt; display enough of the subject line, for example, without going to full
&gt;&gt; screen.  Full screen is also good for tables, but it's not good for
&gt;&gt; text.
&gt;
&gt; I've used MS Mail, MS Outlook and MS Outlook Express and they all can
&gt; display a mail message in a window with no unreasonable adornment.
&gt; It sounds like you were using Outlook, and viewing the message in the
&gt; preview pane.

No, it was Lotus Notes.  But I think the same problem exists with
Microsoft Outlook.

&gt; If the problem was merely an excessively long subject line there
&gt; were other alternatives, too, for example dragging the mouse through
&gt; the subject to scroll it,

That's not an alternative.

&gt; or cut-n-paste the subject to a different window.

Nor that.

&gt; I'm not saying these are nice things to have to do, but they are
&gt; quite reasonable for the pathalogical case you seem to be
&gt; describing.

No, they're completely unreasonable.  Why should I have to do that
just to stop the MUA from reformatting the message to an unreasonable
number of characters?  Using the mouse at all slows things down
immensely, and having text scroll off the screen horizontally is even
worse than overlong lines.

&gt; A standard 80 character window could have had the same sorts of
&gt; problems with that message, so you seem to have described a
&gt; situation where HTML email probably was, or would have been, an
&gt; improvement.

Not at all.  Take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/mutt-view.gif">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/mutt-view.gif</A> to see how mutt
handles it.  The area between the first two yellow bars is a partial
index, with the subject on the right.  The text between the second two
yellow bars are the first 80% of your message.

Since the format of the message is predetermined, you can make the
window as long as you like without running the risk of having the text
reformatted.  The window in this example is 120 characters wide, for
no particular reason.  It could easily have been double that.

&gt;&gt; On the contrary, it's broken.  It's uncomfortable to read text that
&gt;&gt; wide.  The same, indcidentally, applies to
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.">http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.</A>
&gt;
&gt; While I'm impressed that you have a 2048 pixel wide screen, it was
&gt; your choice to make the display so wide and so a pretty feeble
&gt; attempt at arguing a deficiency in HTML email.

What nonsense!  The choice is good, and I certainly didn't choose it
to argue against HTML.  That resolution is really useful.  How else
are you going to view 2048x1536 images such as
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Photos/20010726/David-Luke-and-Grog.big.jpeg?">http://www.lemis.com/grog/Photos/20010726/David-Luke-and-Grog.big.jpeg?</A>
Oh, yes, I forgot, you scroll.  And that's what you'd have to do more
often in a vertical direction to read a message of any length.

&gt; I'm surprised you resorted to such a cheap trick.  It makes you look
&gt; desperate and obviously nobody is going to be fooled by it.

So far, you have argued in a reasonable manner.  The only way this
claim can be considered reasonable, however, would be if it were an
agreed fact that reformatting to the width of a window is desirable
and more important than the other advantages of a high resolution
screen.  But that's the point: it isn't.  Now you're just being silly
and a little insulting.

&gt; &lt;table border&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greg Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&gt; &lt;table border&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&gt; &lt;table border&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greg Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&gt; &lt;table border&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&gt; I should imagine that quoted text could be quite clear if preceeded
&gt; by the usual attribution line and enclosed in a cell with a
&gt; different coloured background.  A reasonable GUI agent should permit
&gt; cut and paste, or intermingling new text.
&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
&gt; How many colours can you distinguish?  How many before you lose track
&gt; of the sequence?  How do you print them out?  Here I see a total of
&gt; five mail messages, indicated by the indentation.  What colours would
&gt; you assign to each of them, and why?
&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
&gt; Entirely reasonable questions.  I think the use of colour is one that's
&gt; not very important, and easily open to argument.  There are alternatives,
&gt; such as placing quoted text in a bordered cell.
&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure I understand the term.  Can you give an example (say, of
&gt; this message)?
&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This is an example of how it could be done.

Except that it's in plain text, and my HTML-foo isn't good enough to
understand it.  

&gt; I didn't try to make it pretty.

You could have tried to make it intelligible.

&gt; Arguably it would be more attractive as a series of dated quotes
&gt; rather than nested cells, however it does mimick what you do with
&gt; angle brackets, while being a simple envelope to an HTML message (ie
&gt; the message within the cell maintains all of the HTML attributes of
&gt; the original message.)

OK, I've gone to the trouble of looking at it
(<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/nested.gif,">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/nested.gif,</A> in case anybody's
paying attention).  Yes, you're right, it mimics the &gt;, better than
the example I showed you.  It's a matter of taste, I suppose, but I
find it painful.  It seems that one of the phenomena of new technology
is that people use it to excess.
