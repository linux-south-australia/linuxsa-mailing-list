Do I take your comment to mean you condone or are indifferent to an
organisation with these qualities, or you feel powerless to have any influence.
I'd say ComputerBank, LinuxSA, & most people in research to name a few are very
different.

&gt; A biological Australian Research Society has an annual national science
&gt; research week.  The committee manages to gets limited media coverage by
&gt; writting the articles for the journalists, 'plying them with good food &
wine,
&gt; and using every personal contact anyone has.  We hit the papers, radio &
&gt; television in a well co-ordinated manner using hired PR consults.  We even
get
&gt; captains of industry, politicians & one year the Australian Noble Laureat to
a
&gt; dinner. 
&gt; Solomon Lew seems to have the budget for it.

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; Largely seems to come down to whether the organisers are 'in' with the
&gt; media. Remember the Jazz festival down at Glenelg a couple of weekends
&gt; ago? I knew it was on, and bought the Saturday 'tiser to see who was
&gt; playing. What did I find? One tiny paid ad in the what's on section! You
&gt; wouldn't find it if you weren't specifically looking for it.
&gt; 
&gt; There is lots of stuff 'on' in Adelaide, but it beats me how anyone finds
&gt; out about it.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Michael

&gt; &gt; I agree... I couldn't believe that such an event occurred in Adelaide
&gt; &gt; and I didn't notice!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm not a big TV viewer, but I read the Australian and Advertiser
&gt; &gt; everyday. Was there even an ad in the papers?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ian,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could say that most of the people stayed away in droves. How to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a good profile for such an event?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't seen any advertising for it at all apart from on LinuxSA...and
&gt; &gt; &gt; I watch a little TV, read a little newspapers...
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; *hmmm*
