Another thing I just thought of is that you could find an old AT power
supply and connect the outputs of the 5v rail to the plug for the switch.
Those power supplies can put out heaps of current.
Just an idea.

I had the same problem only the power supply i needed outputed 2.4Amps and
Dick smith didn't have this either and we're completely useless when i came
to asking for other suppliers.  apartenly JayCar has this kind of stuff,
perhaps give them a ring?

what was funny it was for a 100Mb switch which i needed to replace or power
up after hours and i asked him if he had any small 100Mb switches.  quite
funny.  he showed me all his Dlink ADSL modems and his USB hubs and a few
other things, all the while offerening to get them out of the case and
compare with mine to see if it was the 'same connections'..  hehehe.
kinda of unfunny on a saturday with our supplier closed tho.

Subject: [OT] replacement PSU ?


Hi all,

Sorry for the off topic post.  My Intel InBusiness 100mbit hub's power
supply unit went fritz this morning (slightly bubbled plastic with a
brown stain on the label). It's an external PSU and take AC 240V in and
gives DC 5V 3A out.

Unfortunately, Dick Smiths only has 5V supplies going to 1.5A so I'm
wondering if anyone has a suitable PSU they'd like to sell/get rid of ?

Dave
