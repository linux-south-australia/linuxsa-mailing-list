&gt; agreed - I was expecting a fair bit smaller than the sydney
&gt; IT expo but, well, this was smaller still than I imagined.

Not sure how well even a Sydney event would do just now. 

The organisers of WiredUp have sent out a circular letter to all
exhibitors to the effect that they are completely embarrassed by the
turnup.  The letter mentioned the flat IT environment and also asked for
feedback regarding what to do next year.

In response I suggested they consider having an open source theme next
year or at least an open source sub-expo, because it is one of the few
parts of IT that does have some vitality about it. I gave what I thought
was various indicators of this for them to followup if they choose.

If people have thoughts on this topic, contact Adelaide Exhibition and
Marketing Services via www.adlex.com.au and make them heard.

Incidentally, I gather that linux.conf.au is doing well for paid-up
registrations given that it is 11 weeks to go, but they urgently ask
people not to leave it to the last minute.
