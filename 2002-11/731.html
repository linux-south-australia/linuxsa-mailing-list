Bill Gates has contributed to an increasing number of research areas that
aren't sexy enough for any other funding agency to be interested.  Not-sexy
meaning the general public doesn't readily understand it & therefore most
journalists don't want to understand it.  The sexiest research in $ terms is
cancer.

Controversy as to what Cecil Rhodes is remembered for still exists.
1. A anglo-imperialist keen on world domination or
2. Generous philanthropist funding Oxford scholars.

Gates also maybe buying a place in history, replaceing domination with
benevolance.

Dan,

&gt; That's true, I agree. However, I think that it is important to ask
&gt; whether it's a charitable donation or a business decision (for example
&gt; USD100M on leprosy which would be more useful in India, but less sexy
&gt; from a PR perspective, might have been more appropriate?).

I'm not certain whether I would want to classify various diseases as
"more sexy" or "less sexy" from a PR perspective than any other. What
you say may be true--I don't doubt that--but, to quote from a particular
musical about a particular saviour, "there will be poor always
pathetically struggling".

And I would tend to interpret the word poor not as poor in pocket but
similar to the French concept, "les miserables".
