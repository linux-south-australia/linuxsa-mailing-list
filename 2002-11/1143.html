A word of warning here...

The rapid/float charger within your UPS may not be capable of charging your
car battery, if it was designed for a SLA battery.

The chemistry and construction of these two batteries results in the
internal impedance of these cells being quite different.   The internal
impedance of a battery determines the maximum current a battery can provide
(short circuit) along with the maximum charge current it will accept.   A
car battery will generally accept around 20-25A when flat, a SLA battery
around 4-5A of the same cell capacity (65Ah).

Engineers being Engineers (especially those from Sola) rely on the internal
impedance of the battery limiting the current out of the internal charger.
So the end result of swapping over to a big mother car battery will result
in the death of the UPS internal charger.

Swapping over to a larger SLA battery is not without its problems but it is
a safer path, especially for those UPS's that already have external battery
pack options for increasing run time capacity.   They have additional
circuitry to cope with the larger charging currents.

Also on the note of car-batteries and enclosed spaces... ** Danger Will
Robinson... Danger *** ...  This is a very bad idea and is quite seriously,
dangerous !   Any stationary wet cell (car batteries in computer rooms fit
into this category) will off gas when they are fully charged, especially on
float charge.   This will result in the production of Hydrogen Gas, in
low-mid O2 environments, results in a serious explosion hazard.   The only
safe way to do this is with a ventilated enclosure with the appropriate
approvals within the computer room.   This happens to a degree with SLA
batteries but the off gassing is not considered dangerous to warrant this
attention.   I can have seen first hand the results of remote DC powered
sites that have experienced very nasty explosions from poor wet-cell
battery containment/ventilation.... The result of the explosion is one
problem, the sulphuric acid is another !

Anyway that is from an Engineers perspective....

Matthew
