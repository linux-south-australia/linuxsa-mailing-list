I don't like my last answer, so I am going to try again.

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;    Doesn't this miss the point completely about open
&gt;source? If you make some company pay for using your code,
&gt;shouldn't you shell out when you take other peoples code and
&gt;use it? I am sure that Lindows has put a bucket load of
&gt;money into it's product, but haven't other people and
&gt;companies benefitted and helped? Are you trying to tell me
&gt;that Lindows has SOLELY created open source code with their
&gt;$ under the GPL with absolutely ZERO help? Even if they
&gt;have, are they paying for the other developers that they are
&gt;effectively leaching from using their OSS/GPL code? What
&gt;about other companies who spend heaps on development? Red
&gt;Hat spends $ on developing code, but they leach others code
&gt;for their distribution. Under the GPL and OSS concept
&gt;models, I can legally copy their distro and sell it as is -
&gt;even undercut their price and they cannot do anything about
&gt;it. What about Mandrake, who copied RH and modified the code
&gt;and now compete?
&gt;
I agree with you on a moral level, and I could have used a better example.

To digress a bit, and to explain what I really want but can't figure out 
how to do. But I am the kind of guy that feels he has to try.

I just want everybody to be happy. &lt;--- I'm naive.  

I want the developers to feel appreciated, the distributions to pay for 
themselves, the software to remain just as obtainable as it is today, 
but be very easy for everybody to use.

I just hope that people smarter than I am will figure out how to get the 
distributions to not only pay for themselves, but to also have an 
incentive to make it as easy as Windows to use.

Anyway, I tried.

&gt;
&gt;    Now I agree that some code MAY not fit the OSS model.
&gt;This tends to be niche stuff or should be closed for other
&gt;reasons. But if you release it under the GPL, then it is
&gt;either GPL or not. If you want to stop others from profiting
&gt;from your work - fine, create your own license, but don't
&gt;complain if others take your code and use it and/or modify
&gt;it if it is GPL. One of the things that makes OSS work is
&gt;that people CAN modify it for their own means and this is
&gt;part of what makes development happen so rapidly. As soon as
&gt;you close source some part of it, then you are stuck with
&gt;that model and all of the costs and problems associated with
&gt;it. The OSS model is by no means perfect either, but RH
&gt;still seems to be making money. I bet the guy who invented
&gt;TCP/IP is really pissed off he didn't license it
&gt;differently, but then again, would TCP/IP be the standard if
&gt;he did license it for money? Basically it comes down to you
&gt;can't have your cake and eat it too.
&gt;    Cheers!
&gt;        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I actually didn't write those amendments for myself. I did
&gt;it because I feel that  the idea needs to be developed
&gt;further along those lines. Anyway, I don't want to sell
&gt;anything really, its not even my profession.
&gt;
&gt;This is what I wanted to accomplish, its gutsy, but I think
&gt;it still needs to be done.
&gt;
&gt;Here is a concrete example. According to the executives at
&gt;Lindows, they have put about $1 Million dollars into Wine.
&gt;
&gt;However, a brand new company can go out and deliver a
&gt;product that is just as good as Lindows, having _not paid_
&gt;the $1 Million dollars.
&gt;
&gt;But what I am saying, is that the developer should have some
&gt;of his costs reimbursed. The only way to do that is to embed
&gt;the cost in the license, otherwise the company.
&gt;
&gt;I am also saying that projects that make our software should
&gt;be able to collect some funding if all the distributors do
&gt;is download the source and throw a logo on a cd. If they
&gt;make the product work better, no royalties to pay.
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes development has to be conducted by a single
&gt;company. If it is a collaboration, as I think it should be,
&gt;then one could argue that its a public benefit, thus the cap
&gt;at 10.
&gt;
&gt;I also wanted to send a message to for profit companies,
&gt;saying, if you port your application to Linux, you won't
&gt;have to pay people to develop software for other people.
&gt;
&gt;On the other hand, I wanted things to stay the same for
&gt;people that create software on their spare time.
&gt;
&gt;1.  Let companies announce that they are considering opening
&gt;up their source depending upon how much the community
&gt;supports them.
&gt;
&gt;2. Eliminate the unfair way costs are spread in the
&gt;community.
&gt;
&gt;3. Send the hardware driver manufacturers a message, that we
&gt;don't need source to use their drivers.
&gt;
&gt;4. Preserve the open source way of doing things, for parties
&gt;without a profit motive.
&gt;
&gt;5. Get companies to open their legacy application source
&gt;code.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, the only lesson Lindows learned was that they should
&gt;_not_ put money into R&D.
&gt;
&gt;As a desktop user I certainly don't want that. I want all of
&gt;the Linux Distributors to put money into improving the
&gt;operating system's user friendliness, so there won't be as
&gt;many "Outsiders."

&gt;What do you think?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You could just release it under the GPL (which was
&gt;written by a professional) with a stipulation that
&gt;other licences can be negotiated with the copyright owner.
