No, *some* text-mode agents wrap.  Other's truncate.  That was the
gist of my point.

&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary, it's broken.  It's uncomfortable to read text that
&gt;&gt;&gt; wide.  The same, indcidentally, applies to

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;While I'm impressed that you have a 2048 pixel wide screen, it was
&gt;&gt;your choice to make the display so wide and so a pretty feeble attempt
&gt;&gt;at arguing a deficiency in HTML email.  I'm surprised you resorted to
&gt;&gt;such a cheap trick.  It makes you look desperate and obviously nobody
&gt;&gt;is going to be fooled by it.
&gt;
&gt; It sounds to me like a last-ditch attempt to make it sort of legible!

I think the point was missed that the HTML displays nicely in a "normal"
size window, and only displays badly, at least in the way Greg complained,
in such a wide window.

&gt;&gt;&lt;table border&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greg Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is an example of how it could be done.

&gt; I had to cut that out and paste it into a browser.

Or just read it.

&gt; Yeah, it works, but it's no clearer than the text version, so what's
&gt; the point?

The point was that there are good HTML analogues of the text &gt;&gt;&gt; convention.

&gt; If anything, it'd be more awkward when the text version to keep track of
&gt; when it gets much taller than the screen. Counting kets is easy.

I don't think so.  When you get deeply nested quotes it gets quite
difficult to work out which is whose.  With cells it's a bit more obvious,
and you can make it even easier by assigning colours (if you wish.)
All of that, of course, would be done by the HTML MUA.


&gt; A lot of this is about broken tools rather than a broken format

Actually, it's about one side saying broken format and the other saying,
no, simply immature tools.
