&gt;A word of warning here...
&gt;
&gt;The rapid/float charger within your UPS may not be capable of charging your
&gt;car battery, if it was designed for a SLA battery.
&gt;
&gt;The chemistry and construction of these two batteries results in the
&gt;internal impedance of these cells being quite different.   The internal
&gt;impedance of a battery determines the maximum current a battery can provide
&gt;(short circuit) along with the maximum charge current it will accept.   A
&gt;car battery will generally accept around 20-25A when flat, a SLA battery
&gt;around 4-5A of the same cell capacity (65Ah).
&gt;
&gt;Engineers being Engineers (especially those from Sola) rely on the internal
&gt;impedance of the battery limiting the current out of the internal charger.
&gt;So the end result of swapping over to a big mother car battery will result
&gt;in the death of the UPS internal charger.
&gt;
&gt;Swapping over to a larger SLA battery is not without its problems but it is
&gt;a safer path, especially for those UPS's that already have external battery
&gt;pack options for increasing run time capacity.   They have additional
&gt;circuitry to cope with the larger charging currents.
&gt;
&gt;Also on the note of car-batteries and enclosed spaces... ** Danger Will
&gt;Robinson... Danger *** ...  This is a very bad idea and is quite seriously,
&gt;dangerous !   Any stationary wet cell (car batteries in computer rooms fit
&gt;into this category) will off gas when they are fully charged, especially on
&gt;float charge.   This will result in the production of Hydrogen Gas, in
&gt;low-mid O2 environments, results in a serious explosion hazard.   The only
&gt;safe way to do this is with a ventilated enclosure with the appropriate
&gt;approvals within the computer room.   This happens to a degree with SLA
&gt;batteries but the off gassing is not considered dangerous to warrant this
&gt;attention.   I can have seen first hand the results of remote DC powered
&gt;sites that have experienced very nasty explosions from poor wet-cell
&gt;battery containment/ventilation.... The result of the explosion is one
&gt;problem, the sulphuric acid is another !
&gt;
&gt;Anyway that is from an Engineers perspective....

Agree re possible death of UPS charger.

It is possible to get float chargers for wet batteries. I once worked
for a company producing/hiring small (&lt;=15kVA) diesel generators for
building sites. The larger ones had electric start, which gives a
battery use pattern of 30 seconds starting drain and 8+ hours on
charge. The "conventional" method of charging the battery on such a
genset is to incorporate what is basically the circuitry of a car
battery charger, powered from the 110V AC output, with a current
limiting resistor to "prevent" overcharging. We decided to go one
better, and fitted a clever charger that adjusted its current output
according to the state of charge of the battery.

Alas, it didn't make much difference. "Ordinary" and "clever"
generators both ate batteries at about the same rate, due partly to
vibration and partly to thick people flattening the battery by trying
to start the generator without using the preheat and then jumping it
off a JCB.

For a Heath Robinson UPS system I'd go for the car battery charger and
resistor method, using a 12V 21W car indicator bulb as the resistor.
The car battery charger (a big one) is modified with a huge capacitor
(&gt;=10000uF) across its output, and used to feed an inverter. The bulb
is connected in parallel with a high-current diode. The bulb/diode
combination is connected in series with the battery, diode anode to
battery positive. The battery/bulb/diode combination is then connected
across the output of the charger.

During normal operation, the car battery charger powers the inverter
which powers the computer. The battery is trickle-charged via the
bulb, which glows dimly. When the mains fails, the car battery powers
the inverter via the diode.

Take care with current ratings. 400W at 12V is 33A.

Re exploding batteries: I have exploded a battery by using a diddy
carbon arc welding kit which is powered from a car bettery. Bit of a
dodgy idea really. My clothes fell apart quite rapidly. No skin damage
though - battery acid isn't strong enough. It tastes rather nice.

If you have a jam jar 2/3 full of water and 1/3 full of a
stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen mix, and you apply a match to a small
hole in the lid (which is not screwed down), the resulting explosion
will not break the glass but will drive the lid into your fingers with
such force that it feels like mashing your fingertips with a hammer.
