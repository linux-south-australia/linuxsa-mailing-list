&gt; &gt;From the newsfactor web site;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "Even more security advisories will be released for open source
&gt; products in the future, while the number of Microsoft security
&gt; vulnerabilities will remain flat or decrease", Aberdeen's Eric
&gt; Hemmendinger predicted.
&gt;
&gt; ---------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Open source software has surpassed Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)  software
&gt; in terms of security  problems, according to an Aberdeen Group report.
&gt;
&gt; "Open source software, commonly used in many versions of Linux, Unix,
&gt; and network routing equipment, is now the major source of elevated
&gt; security vulnerabilities for IT buyers," the report stated.
&gt;
&gt; The research cited a list of advisories published by the Computer
&gt; Emergency Response Team (CERT), a federally funded research and
&gt; development center operated by Carnegie Mellon University.
&gt;
&gt; The CERT  report claims that security alerts for open source  and Linux
&gt; software accounted for 16 out of the 29 advisories published during the
&gt; first 10 months of 2002. During those same 10 months, only seven
&gt; security problems were documented in Microsoft products.

*sigh* Again, this heaps *all* Open Source *and* Linux software on one pile
and only M$ software on another pile...

They forget that:
1) Much open source also runs on Windows, and so should be held acountable
too... I haven't gone in to these advisories, but would not be surprized if
these 'Open Source' advisories include cross-platform software such as
Apache as well.. (very likely even, seeing we had a few Apache
vulnerabilities *on Windows* lately...)
2) What about other vendor's software that runs on Windows? Open Source
software encompasses many different 'organisation', so to do it right you
should take *all* software that runs on Windows in to a single pile too...
(Yes, that'd prolly mean that some tools, like OpenSSL, will show up in both
lists! *shocked expression*)

Ah well, as long as M$ can 'buy' Public Opinion these types of articles will
always be tainted...
