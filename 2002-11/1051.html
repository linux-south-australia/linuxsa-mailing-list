Hi Glen,

Very quickly, I've been doing most of what you suggest already, and talking to 
people (here and interstate) directly rather than via public mailing lists.  
Your thoughts are very much valued - like to join the team?  You'd very be 
welcome, and no doubt, very helpful :P

Cheers,

Michael...

&gt; &gt; I'm looking at organising a Linux conference here in SA in the centre of 
&gt; &gt; Adelaide, in January 2004, and I'm looking for venue cost and
&gt; availability.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; I took ten ten minutes out of my day and made a few calls.
&gt; 
&gt; I've no idea how many people will go to lca 2004 so I took
&gt; a stab at 400 -- this effects costs a lot, bigger conferences
&gt; being more expensive per person.
&gt; 
&gt; A good budgetary figure is $750 per day per facility.  LCA2003
&gt; has three streams and goes for five days, so that's about
&gt; $12,000.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the way to proceed from here *isn't* to ring Jim Denny on
&gt; 8303 6105 and book Union Hall at Adelaide Uni.  Ring the
&gt; organisers of LCA2003, get an idea of eventual numbers,
&gt; and then ring Jim.  Don't agree to anything, just get
&gt; pricing, availability and T&Cs (get him to fax these to you).
&gt; You'll need the T&Cs to answer questions later (does the
&gt; Hall come with audio, if so do you need to pay an audio
&gt; tech if you use it).
&gt; 
&gt; Then start to build a team of interested people.
&gt; 
&gt; With a good team you'll have someone from inside Adelaide Uni
&gt; working for you.  That will make things a lot simpler. It may
&gt; not on the surface cost less, but items like data projectors
&gt; will then be located by Means Nefarious rather than cost
&gt; upwards of $500 per day.  And any little emergency items like
&gt; powerboards can be found.
&gt; 
&gt; I suggest what you do to build that team is to put out a call for
&gt; a preliminary organising committee.  Noting that you'll want to
&gt; influence the membership a tad (the people you want most have
&gt; been burnt by conference organisation before and will need to be
&gt; personally begged/bribed/threatened).
&gt; 
&gt; You'll need to buddy up to the LCA2003 organisers and make
&gt; sure that there's no one unofficially lined up for 2004.  A
&gt; 2005 date would be better in many ways -- Jan 2004 is very
&gt; close, most conferences look at 18 months as barely enough
&gt; time.
&gt; 
&gt; Then you should schmooze LinuxSA, AUUG-SA, ACS-SA and groups
&gt; you don't even know about yet.  Things like accomodation,
&gt; net access, etc will fall into your lap.  But I've found that
&gt; building a core of effective volunteer organisers is by
&gt; far the hardest part of organising a grassroots conference
&gt; and you need to cast far and wide for these.
&gt; 
&gt; Best wishes,
&gt; Glen
