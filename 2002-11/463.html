&gt;&gt; Just because *I* don't need an extra large font doesn't change that
&gt;&gt; some people do.  However that was not my point.  My point was that it
&gt;&gt; doesn't matter if the email renders slightly differently.
&gt;
&gt; The trouble is, people carry that to extremes.  Look at the illegibly
&gt; mutilated mail that some people send, long, short, uneven quoting,
&gt; etc.  That's their argument too.

I sense that the bulk of your objection relates to quoting.  Certainly
issues such as long or short lines disappear with HTML.  In the same vein,
that seems to be your only argument (that I could discern) against the
different way email displays.  Having put some effort into this issue
I don't see it as insurmountable.  The HTML enabled mail client can and
should permit clearly text.  Everyone's unfavourate already does this by
use of a side-bar.  It's not perfect, but as has been remarked many times,
"you only have to make a project good enough to criticise."

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I *would* support would be some other SGML-based format if:
&gt;&gt;&gt; ... It would guarantee WYSIWIS (What you see is what I saw).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No such thing.  Even plain text makes no such guarantee.
&gt;
&gt; For a certain level of identity, it does.  You have to assume MTAs and
&gt; MUAs which don't perform their own mutilation, and you have to assume
&gt; that the font is not important, but then it works.

And you have to use it according to convention, such as line breaks at
column 70ish, implying monospace fonts.  That's not so different to the
convention (which sadly isn't yet widely understood) that HTML mail
should be devoid of superflous embedded objects.


&gt;&gt; Why do you oppose progress simply because it's less than perfect?
&gt;
&gt; I don't.  I oppose HTML because it's a dead end.

I'm genuinely trying to see your point of view, but failing.  Given that
perhaps all of the faults that people make formatting plain text email
are non-issues with HTML email, and given that you concede a need for
something better, I wonder why you don't describe how a good HTML agent
could solve the one issue of yours that I do understand.

I should imagine that quoted text could be quite clear if preceeded
by the usual attribution line and enclosed in a cell with a different
coloured background.  A reasonable GUI agent should permit cut and paste,
or intermingling new text.

One of the reasons why I think that HTML is unpopular for email is that
many long respected luminaries are also acting crusty.  This encourages
a belief that the subject needs no discussion; which in turn reduces
incentive to innovate in the area of GUI tools.  I lament that our
community leaders don't take a more positive approach.  Simply saying
that HTML is not the answer so we must stick to plain text is such a
negative attitude, and quite stiffling to innovation.
