&gt; And while we're on the topic, what's with the power connectors on
&gt; UPS's?  They all seem to have the male computer power connectors
&gt; (don't know the real name for that style of three-prong), which means
&gt; you can't plug just any old device into them, you have to have one
&gt; that takes the right type of cable. Why don't they just have the
&gt; normal Australian-style connectors? Can you get adapters, so I can
&gt; plug (say) a Modem PSU into it? Is there any reason why you shouldn't?
&gt; I mean, seriously, who has oodles of male-female computer three-prong
&gt; power cords lying around anyway? &lt;/rant&gt;

My SOLA 325-1000VA has four standard Australian plugs in the back of it....
makes it real easy to plug in stuff besides computers... ie. when the power
fails and its 40 degrees, a fan does nicely for several hours :)

I had an old Crietec (sic??) UPS which had those kinda connectors, I asked a
favour of a sparky friend of mine and he got a normal powerboard and cut the
normal power plug off the end and replaced it with a kettle-plug-type
connector so that I could plug it into that old UPS and use it... 6 months
after that, that UPS totally died... so I turfed it... now I have my Sola
325 which has the plugs in it anyway.
