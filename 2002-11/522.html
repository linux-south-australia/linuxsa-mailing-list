Ok, Strict I'm not sure of, Transitional isn't too bad and reaches more of 
our market, community access is not rich in resources.

CSS1 is the minimum and bits of 2 are OK.

Tables are great and so long as you include the summary with them I don't 
see a problem.

DIV is fine and not sure why not use SPAN, how else do you apply an inline 
style that you don't want to program into your Stylesheet.

All our sites are hosted on ISPs so we don't use any scripting. No dynamic 
serving either.

Yes, I agree about graphics. Eye candy is not attractive when it isn't thee 
for any real purpose. Then it just becomes a bandwidth sucker.

Yes, I follow the WAI Guidelines as much as I can.

Now, about Homesite, it is basically a glorified Notepad, it gives me 
options to insert code instead of typing code. To me that is a huge 
improvement. My normal procedure is to develop a hollow template then when 
it is working pour the content in. The content has been created elsewhere 
and is structured and able to stand on its own.

I have downloaded Bluefish for working on Lycoris. Seems to be a pretty 
nice tool.

Thanks for your feedback.

Cheers,  Ian
