I think you're missing the point here.  I too would like a better form
of communication than plain text.  But it has to be better.

&gt; I have never known HTML to be platform specific - so what's the
&gt; deal?

HTML is worse than platform specific.  What you see is dependent not
only on your browser, but how you set it up.  There is as good as no
possibility that what you see on the screen is the same as what I see
on the screen.  With properly formatted plain text, or with PDF, the
discrepancies are minimal.

&gt; Surely even the most basic of basic text email readers can still
&gt; render HTML - unless it has been deliberately turned off as a silent
&gt; protest against change.

In fact, most can't.  I don't know of any which can, though at least
mutt can grab a passing Netscape and get it to display for him.  But
answering such a message is difficult.

&gt; I'm sure the security concerns of HTML are dead easy to work around
&gt; too - so give the web site maintainers a break eh?

OK, how would you stop dereferencing an embedded a tag?  I don't want
to have to think about it.

&gt; Hmmmm... what exactly is the problem with HTML format? Isn't that
&gt; meant to be *the* platform independent document formatting language?

No.

&gt; It's much more light weight than pdf, which is a proprietary
&gt; encoding (it's just not MS).

Agreed, that's why people generally don't advocate PDF.  PDF has the
advantage of showing pretty much the intended text at the other end,
but it's also as good as impossible to reply to using UNIX tools.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for your newslettter. Normally due to security reasons I do not
&gt; have
&gt;&gt;&gt; html enabled by default. Thus your newsletter appears as plain text in my

(etc).

This was appended to the message.  I'm sure that wasn't "intentional"
in the sense that you wanted people to see it.  It was probably just
too much effort to remove.  That depends on the tools you're using.
With good tools, it would be trivial.  But I don't know any such good
tools in the HTML space.  You'll notice that your tool also mutilated
the quoted text.

&gt;
&gt; Sorry. Totally disagree. The vast majority of home internet
&gt; connections are via dialup and are therefore too slow for anything
&gt; but text.

Quite honestly, this isn't an argument.  HTML isn't that much larger.
And in the size range we're talking about, the transfer speeds for
email are not overly dependent on the length of the message.

&gt; At the end of the day, all of the arguments that I have seen concerning
&gt; why not to use HTML are shallow attempts to disguise poor use of the tool
&gt; as defects in the tool.

No, I think you're missing the point.  It's not an attempt to disguise
the problem.  It may be not recognizing the problem.  But, as I say
above, that's only part of the problem.
