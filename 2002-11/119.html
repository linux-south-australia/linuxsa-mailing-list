Agreed.  Landauer's point was more aimed at the deficiencies in software,
especially at the User Interface level.  His book is rife with anecdotes
of the kind of "spending excessive amounts of time trying to get the page
layout correct on a document", or the (in-)famous Xerox incident where
two computer scientists could not get their flagship photocopier to work
(this was videotaped by Xerox UI guys trying to convince the board that
the reason for the drop in sales is that their photocopiers had become
far too complicated, and of course the board wouldn't listen until they
saw that video).
