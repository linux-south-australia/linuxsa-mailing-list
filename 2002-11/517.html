&gt; Personally, I try to follow best current practice. That means:
&gt;
&gt;   - Pages served as HTML4 Strict[0], using no deprecated attributes or
&gt; elements.
&gt;   - Pages styled using CSS1, and some CSS2.
&gt;   - Don't use tables for laying out your page.
&gt;   - Avoid using &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; elements wherever possible.
&gt;   - Don't use scripting to generate intial content, nav menus, etc. Only
&gt; use it for dynamic effect on content already there.
&gt;   - Use graphics ony when you have some graphical content to display
&gt; (photos, diagrams) and use sound only when you have some audiable
&gt; content to be presented. I.e. don't use gratutious sound or images.
&gt;   - Follow the WAI's guidelines[1].

Geepers, that doesn't leave much for design then! :)

I agree with not using SPAN tags but DIV tags can be handy.
Not using tables for layouts, hmm. well not sure on that one, I use tables,
the only reason I haven't migrated to CSS is because of backwards
compatiblity, a lot of old browsers don't like the new css tags.
and HTML 4.01 Transitional seems to work just fine with 99% of browsers.

&gt; What you should be aiming for when using CSS to style a page is to be
&gt; able to load the same page in a v1 or v2 browser and have it still
&gt; rendered in a way that is legible, makes sense, and doesn't look too
&gt; shabby, albeit with all of your nice colors and fonts and layout gone.
&gt; It should allow the user of such a browser to successfully
&gt; read/hear/feel *all* content on your site, which means it must be easily
&gt; navigatable as well. How to achieve this is probably outside the scope
&gt; of this document. :) See *cough* my website *cough* as an example of this.

One way which you can get around some of the interim 4x browsers that think
they know advanced CSS but don't is to use the following for stylesheets:

&lt;link href="oldbrowsers.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;!--
@import url("newbrowsers.css");
--&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;

Browsers 5.x and above will load the newbrowsers.css and older browsers in
the 4.x range will load the oldbrowsers.css

and then do some trickery inside the stylesheets ie. having different values
for different things in these two stylesheets to satisfy whatever browser
needs.

&gt; I'd avoid all of these products, the markup they generate sucks.

I beg to differ. Dreamweaver MX does a very reasonable job of keeping its
own HTML in tow, the only time it doesn't like it much is when you hand edit
errors in or copy and paste them. (some it will pick up and correct, others
it will miss).

Generally though it writes the HTML pretty cleanly I have found.

Regards,

Michael
