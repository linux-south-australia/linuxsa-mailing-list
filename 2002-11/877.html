&gt; I've been trying to run Redhat (7.3) on a new Compaq (HP) EVO

&gt; BUT: seems they use the Intel 830/845G video card, and XFree86
&gt; seems to have problems with that chipset. Apparently they are
   :
&gt; Interestingly, HP are now offering Mandrake on the D510, which
&gt; suggests they've fixed the problem in Mandrake

&gt; or maybe Mandrake doesn't use XFree86.

No, this isn't the case :)

&gt; * Is there a fix I can use now for RedHat?

It seems like there is, in that you have found a fix for XFree, but it
isn't easy for you to apply. XFree is used by all distros for graphics,
from Slackware to FreeBSD.

&gt; * Should I go with Mandrake?

If someone else has done the work for you, then certainly in your case
that sounds like a good option. HPaq should make the CD available for
download as well as shipping it with systems (but you may have to prod
them to make this happen.)

&gt; * Should I use a different box? (But I WANT that 1.8Ghz/512MB/40GB
&gt; box! :-)

I think you should use a different box and give me the laptop. Then you
wont be bothered by the problem any more will you?
