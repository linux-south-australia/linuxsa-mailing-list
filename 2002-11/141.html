David,

&gt; I emailed them about my "lost" rego from their website but all
&gt; they had to say was "we had thousands of people who registered
&gt; and it did work for them".

That's probably like the meaning of life. A correct response to another
question. They should have investigated what happened to your
registration.

&gt; Your OSS idea is good though, the last IT expo I went to (sydney)
&gt; had a whole sub-section devoted to OSS, it was very popular
&gt; (I scored several t-shirts).  The other thing I remember about
&gt; it was the iomega girls - I nearly bought a zip drive.

This is something that I've been thinking about for a long time, and
periodically I keep on saying I might do something to organise an OSS
Exposition.

I feel the need for yet another BBQ.

It's something that I'm sure AUUG, LinuxSA, BUGA, Wired Up and open
source supportive companies such as Tellurian, Microbits (1) and IBm may
be interested in doing.

DSL

(1) I am going to slip up one day and say "Microsoft"...
