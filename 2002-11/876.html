<H1>Compaq EVO D510 -- too soon?</H1>

Hi.

I've been trying to run Redhat (7.3) on a new Compaq (HP) EVO
D510 CMT.

BUT: seems they use the Intel 830/845G video card, and XFree86
seems to have problems with that chipset. Apparently they are
fixing this in XFree86 4.3, due in January. Of course, I can't
possibly wait that long! There's a fix described at
<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/~dawes/845driver.html">http://www.xfree86.org/~dawes/845driver.html</A> which I found more
or less incomprehensible -- too hard for me. :-(

Interestingly, HP are now offering Mandrake on the D510, which
suggests they've fixed the problem in Mandrake, or maybe Mandrake
doesn't use XFree86.

Anyone who knows what in hell I'm talking about (and that
probably excludes me -- I'm just quoting here), can you offer any
advice?

* Is there a fix I can use now for RedHat?

* Should I go with Mandrake?

* Should I use a different box? (But I WANT that
1.8Ghz/512MB/40GB box! :-)


Regards,
Steve
