&gt; I am a self taught ordinary home user 

Good on you. It means that you look everywhere yourselve, and ofcourse
read the manuals ??

 I have read ( regarding Linux) "Try a few distributions, 
 O what did you try? redhat 6 7.1 7.2 7.3 FreeBSD 4.4  suse 6.4 ?

have not arrived at a trouble free user friendly operating system. On reflection I never tried printing from that so 
&gt; can't really say it was trouble free.

Despite tbat it was some fun to come somewhere ! Rome and Paris are not
built the same day either And the so called trouble free once depends on
the program and the use of the programs and the human errors make in
between the  ( home)users.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anywhere running courses that will give me the necessary knowledge
&gt; to solve the problems that keep arising? 
Did you found any dummies books??

I don,t know, but would we (pensioners) have that what it takes to sit
through all things what we want to know or are still told anyway if 
not? Maybe a mailing list in which each other help each other in the way
we can, or try to find via howtoo's or so.

 I have maybe 25 years left 
Hope for you.
. Have aquired a few books on the subject (don't learn very well 
&gt; from books), have spent many hours looking at FAQ's and Emails and am still 
&gt; in the same situation.

I too, but to work one problem at the time with little steps instead of
doing to much at once is the way to go maybe ?

&gt; 
&gt; If I am having these problems, there must be many others in the same 
&gt; situation, who just leave Linux alone, and put in the too hard basket.

I though so to but now I am solo linux and stopped using ms microsoft
things.The advange is, you have to go linux way to work having no
excuses to use the old easy ways.

&gt; At the moment, Linux gets used for Internet connection , Email and The Gimp, 
&gt; Windows for all the rest.

But what is the rest doing for you?
What is in microsoft that linux can't do for you ?

 
e,I am only trying to put myself in the position to solve my own problems, and become self 
&gt; sufficient, where I don't have to keep asking for help, 

Nobody lives on an island by him/her self.


&gt; I have attended 2 meetings and they seem to be aimed at the higher levels, 
&gt; and go right over my head, so any info on a suitable course would be much 
&gt; appreciated if anyone knows of any.

You may be right but how many of us are there and what is it concretely
what we need ?
