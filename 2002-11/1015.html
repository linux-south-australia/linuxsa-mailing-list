&gt;Don't use C shell.  When customers set specifications with implementation

You take the bullets out...

That's why it's actually easier to do this in DOS than Linux - fewer
bullets, and of smaller calibre.

It's probably better to give them access to the command line, but set
up file permissions so they can't then do anything naughty.

To help you persuade the customer about this: I know someone whose
employer said "You've done such a good job setting up this spare parts
database that we don't need you any more, so bugger off". This made
him very glad that the accounts/payroll computer had been set up in
the manner you describe...

Another system (badly) set up as you describe was mentioned by a user
of it in the pub one evening. "I can shell out of the editor, and I
get this really weird prompt. It's a # sign." A chorus of other voices
then said "cd /; rm -rf *"... we gave in eventually and told him what
it would do.
