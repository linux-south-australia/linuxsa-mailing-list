&gt;&gt;&gt; HTML is worse than platform specific.  What you see is dependent not
&gt;&gt;&gt; only on your browser, but how you set it up.  There is as good as no
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility that what you see on the screen is the same as what I see
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the screen.  With properly formatted plain text, or with PDF, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; discrepancies are minimal.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't think that matters.  Seeing how I am virtually blind*, and
&gt;&gt; therefore forced to use a 56pt font, I only get a 26 character wide
&gt;&gt; window, so your text to me is wrapped horribly no matter what.  At
&gt;&gt; least if you sent in HTML I wouldn't get stupid short line in the
&gt;&gt; middle of sentences.
&gt;
&gt; If you need such a contrived example to counter my argument, the
&gt; argument must be pretty bullet-proof.

The argument is not so contrived.  Just because *I* don't need an extra
large font doesn't change that some people do.  However that was not
my point.  My point was that it doesn't matter if the email renders
slightly differently.


&gt; What I *would* support would be some other SGML-based format if:
&gt; ... It would guarantee WYSIWIS (What you see is what I saw).

No such thing.  Even plain text makes no such guarantee.  Why do you
oppose progress simply because it's less than perfect?  (Crusty old fart
syndrome? *g*)
