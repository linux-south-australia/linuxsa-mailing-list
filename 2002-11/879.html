&gt;I've been trying to run Redhat (7.3) on a new Compaq (HP) EVO
&gt;D510 CMT.

You could try Redhat 8 as the XFree86 version used is a little later,
for obvious reasons, maybe the fix is already included.  


&gt;BUT: seems they use the Intel 830/845G video card, and XFree86
&gt;seems to have problems with that chipset. Apparently they are
&gt;fixing this in XFree86 4.3, due in January. Of course, I can't
&gt;possibly wait that long! There's a fix described at
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/~dawes/845driver.html">http://www.xfree86.org/~dawes/845driver.html</A> which I found more
&gt;or less incomprehensible -- too hard for me. :-(

I remember those sort of fixes, back when I tried to get Redhat 
5.x running on my TNT card, before Nvidia started releasing drivers
for Linux......those were the days, NOT! ;)


&gt;Interestingly, HP are now offering Mandrake on the D510, which
&gt;suggests they've fixed the problem in Mandrake, or maybe Mandrake
&gt;doesn't use XFree86.

Mandrake tends to be more cutting edge with the software they package
in their distro, so you'll find some of the more obscure drivers/fixes
in Mandrake before Redhat usually.  It's one of the reasons I like Mandrake
over Redhat for a workstation, but that's just personal preference...
