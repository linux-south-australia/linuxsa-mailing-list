&gt;&gt; A standard 80 character window could have had the same sorts of

&gt; Not at all.  Take a look at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/mutt-view.gif">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/mutt-view.gif</A> to see how mutt
&gt; handles it.

You use a text MUA that handles that problem gracefully.  Not all text
agents do so.  When you used an HTML agent it handled the problem badly.
Not all HTML agents are so poor.  That particular criticism must be seen
as a problem with the particular agent, not with the medium.


&gt; Since the format of the message is predetermined, you can make the
&gt; window as long as you like without running the risk of having the text
&gt; reformatted.  The window in this example is 120 characters wide, for
&gt; no particular reason.  It could easily have been double that.

As you pointed out previously, I can format my text message to be 200
characters wide, and there's little you can do except put up with it or
reformat it.  Your frequent, "format recovered"  tags suggest you choose
to do the latter.  In fact, if you think about it, that's approximately
the same as browsers reformatting text to fit the display, except that
in the browser case I *expect* that to be done.

&gt;&gt; While I'm impressed that you have a 2048 pixel wide screen, it was
&gt;&gt; your choice to make the display so wide and so a pretty feeble
&gt;&gt; attempt at arguing a deficiency in HTML email.
&gt; 
&gt; What nonsense!  The choice is good, and I certainly didn't choose it
&gt; to argue against HTML.  That resolution is really useful.

According to you it's not useful for viewing mail messages.  Resize your
window as you presumably would do when viewing most other web pages.

&gt; How else
&gt; are you going to view 2048x1536 images such as
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/Photos/20010726/David-Luke-and-Grog.big.jpeg?">http://www.lemis.com/grog/Photos/20010726/David-Luke-and-Grog.big.jpeg?</A>
&gt; Oh, yes, I forgot, you scroll.  And that's what you'd have to do more
&gt; often in a vertical direction to read a message of any length.

Nice picture.  That was a fun day, by the way, perhaps in part because
of, rather than despite, the problem with the pump!  I am still impressed
with your 2048 pixel display, and admit that even with a maximised window
I *still* have to scroll the image to see it all.


&gt;&gt; I'm surprised you resorted to such a cheap trick.  It makes you look
&gt;&gt; desperate and obviously nobody is going to be fooled by it.
&gt;
&gt; So far, you have argued in a reasonable manner.  The only way this
&gt; claim can be considered reasonable, however, would be if it were an
&gt; agreed fact that reformatting to the width of a window is desirable
&gt; and more important than the other advantages of a high resolution
&gt; screen.  But that's the point: it isn't.  Now you're just being silly
&gt; and a little insulting.

Hmm, okay, if I'm being insulting I apologise.  The message that I was
trying to convey, however, was that I figure you would reasonably set
your window to a reasonable size for the content, rather than leave it
at maximum.  I certainly know that well designed web pages don't make
assumptions about font sizes, display widths, etc.  Web pages would
display just as badly with a 2000 pixel window.  It did seem that your
maximised window was more designed to prove a point than to demonstrate
your normal modus operandii.


&gt; OK, I've gone to the trouble of looking at it
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/nested.gif,">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/nested.gif,</A> in case anybody's
&gt; paying attention).  Yes, you're right, it mimics the &gt;, better than
&gt; the example I showed you.  It's a matter of taste, I suppose, but I
&gt; find it painful.  It seems that one of the phenomena of new technology
&gt; is that people use it to excess.

Yes indeed, which is probably the real reason so many are against HTML.
If we hadn't got inundated with HTML message containing ugly background
pictures and frothy borders we'd probably all have said, yes, HTML does
add a useful degree of expression.  It's a pity that people immediately
leaped to a poor use of the technology, but I think that can be managed
by education (just as we currently do when we say no HTML.)
