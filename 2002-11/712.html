Just to add a point into the debate.

Tonight I got a message that had 20 different components, mostly GIF or 
JPG graphics. Don't know what it was about, I deleted after sending the 
following message to the sender;

 Sorry but you sent that as an HTML coded message. Many of us around
 the country like to receive our messages in Plain Text format. There
 are several very good reasons for this preference, it is much lighter
 on our connections, it takes up far less room, we can get to the crux
 of the message without waiting for so much of it to download and
 perhaps a very important reason, if we read only in Plain Text then no
 virus can slip through to our computer. Of course for those of us with
 visual impairments Plain Text makes it so much easier for the text
 readers to read the message to us.

 Could you please resend you above message to me, this time in Plain
 Text so I can read it? Or point me to a web site where I can read the
 message online.

 Many thanks

I have now plugged that in as a boilerplate and the same will go back 
to anybody else using my Inbox as a rubbish dump for graphical tidbits.

Hey, I tolerate a couple of pictures in a file, if I have to. 20 is 
just being silly and inconsiderate.

This wasn't spam mail, this was an update from a national community 
group. They should have known better. The sender is lucky that I know 
her otherwise I could easily have been nasty in my response &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
