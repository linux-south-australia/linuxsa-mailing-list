Many thanks Ian - well posted....

in such times as these when politicians talk the rhetoric of war, perhaps it 
is even more timely to remember WHY these men and women sacrificed...

indeed, lest we forget....

&gt; Remembrance Day 2002
&gt; "Lest We Forget"
&gt;
&gt;  At 11 Am on Monday 11 November countless thousands around the world
&gt;  will hear those words as they stand quietly in silent remembrance of
&gt;  the men and women who have died from war.
&gt;
&gt;  Remembrance Day was originally called Armistice Day and it reflected
&gt;  the beginning of Peace after the First World War, "The War to End All
&gt;  Wars" on the 11th of November 1917.
&gt;
&gt;  What are we going to Remember as we bow our heads on Monday? Will we
&gt;  be thinking of the gallant Australians who fought in the Boer War?
&gt;  Perhaps the ANZACS will come to mind. Maybe your thoughts will be on
&gt;  Troop actions closer to home? Could we be thinking of those lost
&gt;  through World War 2 or perhaps the Korean Vietnam or Desert Storm
&gt;  conflicts? Some of us will be thinking of those who gave their lives
&gt;  in undeclared wars such as the War against Terrorism being fought in
&gt;  Afghanistan, the Philippines, Bali and many other places.
&gt;
&gt;  In Australia and many Commonwealth countries they play the Last Post
&gt;  during the service, in the US and other countries the tradition is to
&gt;  play Taps. Follow these links to hear a rendition of these traditional
&gt;  tunes.  As you listen to the music silently give thanks for those who
&gt;  made the ultimate sacrifice;
