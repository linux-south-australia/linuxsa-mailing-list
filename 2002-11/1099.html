Hi Richard..

I purchased  a "Liebert" brand UPS for my Linux server, from the "Powersure
Proactive" range.  They come with Multilink V3.0 monitoring software which
can be configured via an Xwindows client program to notify via e-mail,
shutdown the server, etc on the various low batt, no power or return of
mains events.  It's very configurable (you can customise what commands it
runs on what events) and can even be driven over the network (I have
actually achieved monitoring my Linux server's UPS on a Windows98
workstation via IP).  I believe the software is written in Java and is a
little bit "bloaty" from my impressions (I'm no programmer) but in general
it works well and they have some reasonably priced models.

Have a look at:

<A HREF="http://www.bmstech.com.au/retail/Pricelist.asp?Cat1">http://www.bmstech.com.au/retail/Pricelist.asp?Cat1</A>=00000002MF000000050B&Cat
2=000000000T000000000A&Cat3=00000002MF000000050D

(Apologies for the long link) for the Powersure proactive range (the unit I
have is the 700VA model).  I know this range comes with a cable and the
Multilink software.  These are contact closure UPSs so they don't give you
fancy voltage and current draw figures, just basic "mains supply present",
"mains not present" and low battery information.  The 700VA unit keeps my
server alive for a smidgen over 30 minutes, even longer with no monitor.

For other models in the various Liebert ranges:

<A HREF="http://www.bmstech.com.au/retail/menu2.asp?Cat1">http://www.bmstech.com.au/retail/menu2.asp?Cat1</A>=00000002MF000000050B

The prices listed here are well over-inflated retail (nobody would ever pay
that much.. hopefully!) but it's a good rough "worse case" cost.  There are
many resellers around Adelaide, contact me off list if you need more info.

Hope that is of some help,

Cheers,
Graham Smith

Subject: UPS's


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I'm going to buy a UPS (hold your applause until the end, please), and
&gt; I was wondering if anyone has experience with any of the brands I can
&gt; get hold of easily -- specifically, how easy they are to configure so
&gt; they will notify your computer of power out, impending battery out,
&gt; and so on, so your computer can shut itself down nicely before it all
&gt; gets messy... Brands my suppliers stock are: Pro Power, PC Power,
&gt; Nikko, and Opti. I'm not familiar with any of these -- the only ones
&gt; I've ever dealt with previously are SOLA and APC.
&gt;
&gt; Any other comments re UPSes?
&gt;
&gt; Note that the purpose here is for a single machine, which is a
&gt; non-mission critical server -- budget is around $250, and I expect to
&gt; get a 500VA device for that.
&gt;
&gt; rr
