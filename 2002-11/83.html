Now this is a bit long but very interesting stuff. Most of us can agree 
with some of the descriptions. Sorry but I don't know the source.

IT hampers Aussie productivity

  AUSTRALIA'S growing reliance on IT during the work day is hampering 
our reputation as a nation of hard workers, according to a global 
study.   

 A Proudfoot Consulting productivity study found that Australia's 
overall productivity in the workplace dipped 1 per cent from 2001 to 
2002, and rose three percentage points in one year, to 7 per cent, for 
IT-related productivity losses. The survey of 1357 companies in seven 
countries including Australia, Austria, France, Germany, South Africa, 
the UK and the US found on average only 59 per cent of work time is 
productive. 

IT-related problems accounted for 8 per cent of lost time. This figure 
was the same in Proudfoot's 2001 survey. 

IT problems came in at number four behind insufficient planning and 
control (43 per cent), inadequate management (22 per cent) and poor 
working morale (14 per cent). 

Ineffective communication (7 per cent) and an inappropriately qualified 
workforce (6 per cent) also rated as causes of productivity loss in the 
workplace. 

The survey listed the causes of IT-related problems as communicating by 
email when face to face communication would have been more appropriate, 
information overload, too much data being produced and not enough 
information, time wasted searching for misplaced or badly stored 
information, computer downtime, corrupted data through virus and worm 
infections, systems not communicating properly with each other, 
duplication of data unnecessarily and applying IT to existing business 
processes instead of reviewing, redesigning and improving processes 
first. 

In comparison to last year's results, the UK went from one of the 
countries least affected by IT-related problems to one of the countries 
most beset by them. 

The UK figure rose from seven per cent to 10 per cent. 

Both France (6 per cent down from 9) and Germany (8 per cent) 
experienced improvements, and South Africa (3 per cent) suffered the 
least from IT-related problems.
