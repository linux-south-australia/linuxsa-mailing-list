&gt; The Adam up-front freebie comes with an 18 month contract lock-in. So

In my view, your view is somewhat biased, and I think that the list 
members of linuxsa are probably smart enough to figure this out without 
needing your help to point it out to them.

The retail price of this particular Netcomm modem/router is $269. The 
normal ADSL activation fee is $139 at most providers. Up to 3 months 
worth of ADSL access is a not worthless either. If you take the time to 
do the simple arithmetic of these values and the normal costs associated 
with ADSL, you'll find that it is a genuinely good deal that saves money 
in the short term AND the long term. Especially when compared with 'pay 
it all up front' deals.

&gt;
&gt; Internode ADSL services have only a 3 month minimum term - because 
&gt; we'd prefer that you stayed with us because you want to, not because 
&gt; we have you over a contractual barrel to stay with us.

Adam also has plans available with no minimum commitment at all. What's 
your point? If you really have confidence in your product's value and 
performance, why have even a 3 month term? Note that Adam Internet is 
still the only provider offering a 7-day money back guarantee on most 
products. We stand by our service.

&gt; - In the name of a minor amount of counter-advertising (since we're 
&gt; clearly the baseline that others are comparing to Adam here) - 
&gt; Internode has a new set of plans and pricing models on the way - 
&gt; expected to be released at the end of November.

In the software industry, this is known as vaporware, a technique made 
famous by Microsoft marketing tactics. I really don't think our industry 
needs the pollution of promises designed to stop churn, even if they are 
genuine.
