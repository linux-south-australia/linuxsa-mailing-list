I actually didn't write those amendments for myself. I did it because I 
feel that  the idea needs to be developed further along those lines. 
Anyway, I don't want to sell anything really, its not even my profession.

This is what I wanted to accomplish, its gutsy, but I think it still 
needs to be done.

Here is a concrete example. According to the executives at Lindows, they 
have put about $1 Million dollars into Wine.

However, a brand new company can go out and deliver a product that is 
just as good as Lindows, having _not paid_ the $1 Million dollars.

But what I am saying, is that the developer should have some of his 
costs reimbursed. The only way to do that is to embed the cost in the 
license, otherwise the company.

I am also saying that projects that make our software should be able to 
collect some funding if all the distributors do is download the source 
and throw a logo on a cd. If they make the product work better, no 
royalties to pay.

Sometimes development has to be conducted by a single company. If it is 
a collaboration, as I think it should be, then one could argue that its 
a public benefit, thus the cap at 10. 

I also wanted to send a message to for profit companies, saying, if you 
port your application to Linux, you won't have to pay people to develop 
software for other people.

On the other hand, I wanted things to stay the same for people that 
create software on their spare time.

1.  Let companies announce that they are considering opening up their 
source depending upon how much the community supports them.

2. Eliminate the unfair way costs are spread in the community.

3. Send the hardware driver manufacturers a message, that we don't need 
source to use their drivers.

4. Preserve the open source way of doing things, for parties without a 
profit motive.

5. Get companies to open their legacy application source code.

Anyway, the only lesson Lindows learned was that they should _not_ put 
money into R&D.

As a desktop user I certainly don't want that. I want all of the Linux 
Distributors to put money into improving the operating system's user 
friendliness, so there won't be as many "Outsiders."

&gt;You could just release it under the GPL (which was
&gt;written by a professional) with a stipulation that
&gt;other licences can be negotiated with the copyright owner.
