&gt;"Labor has always challenged the wisdom of long-term contracts capturing

Senator Lundy would be the most genuine politician I've ever met, and 
she is really switched-on when it comes to IT issues. She was in 
Adelaide last week, and could hold her own on discussions about Telstra 
internals, and offered help in dealing with them at high-up levels that 
we don't normally have access to.

By comparison, most of her peers don't even seem to read their own 
email, try emailing the minister for IT and see if you get back anything 
besides a form letter.

Don't knock her work without a good reason, she's on our side.

John Edwards
