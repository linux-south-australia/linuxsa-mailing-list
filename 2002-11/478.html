I am just having a conversation with Ben and his site is so very hard to 
work out anything let alone navigate and yet he likes it that way.

Now is it me or is it you or is there something we both missed along the 
way on what is the reason for a web site? I used to think it was to 
communicate with a reader and to make it easier for the reader you 
design the page with them in mind.

Then again, our project's web site is nearly all in text and we have 
just been panned for having a site that is not attractive to the young 
people we are trying to interest. "Not enough graphics".

So you need to pretty up the site and hide the content so kids can read it?

Geez this is getting confusing.

I better go back to <A HREF="http://www.webstyleguide.com">http://www.webstyleguide.com</A> and read up just how to 
get this right.

Cheers,  Ian


PS: This is being sent through Mozzilla Email and I have told it to send 
plain text. Hope it gets to you in that format &lt;sigh&gt;

&gt;&gt; At the end of the day, it's also agreed that HTML as a markup 
&gt;&gt; language is pretty poor; it confuses presentation with content, so 
&gt;&gt; using something so "90's" would be a pretty poor decision too, 
&gt;&gt; wouldn't you agree?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; To make matters worse, they teach eight-year-olds that style is more 
&gt; important than content. Some programme on late-night TV I saw, they 
&gt; were getting these eight-year-olds to write a web page. Some teacher
&gt; who should be shot: "Ah yes, 'Doggies' for a title. Very good. But 
&gt; it's a bit boring, isn't it? Can't you make it a bit more colourful?
&gt; Use a more interesting font? etc. etc." AARGH! Ten years later we have 
&gt; someone writing web pages & HTML emails for some company, who's been 
&gt; programmed to think that a 3k GIF of 'Doggies' in some fancy script is 
&gt; always preferable to 'Doggies' as 7 bytes of text.
&gt;
&gt; This thread should be (censored and) sent to IT teachers everywhere..?
