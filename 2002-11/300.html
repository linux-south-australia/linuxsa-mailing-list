Greetings and thank you for your most warm welcome and responses to our 
presentation, we were pleasantly suprised and even a little overwhelmed.  

Recovering and back to our senses we've decided to bring you all together, 
well, all who want to anyway, for a demonstration of our build, discussion 
about what we're doing and how people can help make the operation even 
better.  In the general geekiness that is Linux, doubtless many other matters 
will be addressed and please consider it as social an occasion as it is 
functional;  communal sharing being a distinguishing ethos of Computerbank, i 
encourage everyone gathering to BYO some small refreshments to share with 
all.  Anyone attending will be encouraged (not obligated) to sign their life 
away as a CAI-SA volunteer or member.

We were to gather together from 2:00pm to 4:00pm on Saturday the 9th of 
November, 2002, at the house of the Convenor (romana) and Volunteer/WFTD 
Co-ordinator(self) :

	30 Fern Hill Road,
	Bridgewater, South Australia, 5155
	'phone:	(08) 8370 1339
	mobile:	0403 865 721

The widely ranging responsibilities of our volunteers, members and visitors 
makes it prudent to extend these hours to the 12:00pm to 4:00 pm time slot.  
We hope this will allow more of you the opportunity to see exactly what we 
get up to.

Please feel free to bring anybody you think may be interested in volunteering, 
joining or even interested in applying for a computer;  all CAI-SA volunteers 
and members are welcome as ever, and p

If you need any further details, or have anything to suggest / contribute for 
the occasion then please feel free to 'phone us.

Best regards,

cromwell
