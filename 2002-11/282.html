&gt;
&gt;-- USB, Ethernet _and_ USB? Cool.
&gt;
Actually, customers have an option of taking a USB modem (no clutter 
with cords/powersupply etc) or an ethernet/usb all-in-one modem/router.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;p2:
&gt;"Once completed, you may remain on the current account and purchase
&gt;the modem at a cost of $1.10 or ..."
&gt;
&gt;-- $1.10? Is that for real?
&gt;
Yes. This allows Adam Internet to maintain ownership of the modem and 
replace it without charge during your contract should you have a problem 
with it. Once the contract is up, it's easier to sell it than arrange to 
pick it up :)

&gt;
&gt;p3 (this is the best one):
&gt;
&gt;"Standard warrantee does not include lightning, flood, fire, liquid or
&gt;cabbage damage."
&gt;
&gt;-- CABBAGE damage? I can't even begin to think of the possible
&gt;circumstances that have lead Adam Internet to think that Cabbage
&gt;damage is worth mentioning on its' own... :) I can't even think of a
&gt;possible typo for that one... :)
&gt;
This was in a draft inspired by 
<A HREF="http://ctnet.dyndns.org:81/ziggy/fries.jpg">http://ctnet.dyndns.org:81/ziggy/fries.jpg</A> which was a widely 
distributed howto document for disgruntled bigpond cable users. It 
remained in there as a way of identifying which new customers actually 
read the contract.

&gt;
&gt;Also, and on a slightly less whimsical note, it doesn't mention the
&gt;details of the plan you'll be on after finishing the free data period
&gt;(see point 4 on p3). Is there a choice? Do we choose after the 1 Feb,
&gt;or when we sign on? (Note: I don't have decent web access right now,
&gt;so haven't really looked at the site -- only the PDF).
&gt;
The only plan currently available with the special is the 1G per week 
one, in 256/64 and 512/128 flavours.
