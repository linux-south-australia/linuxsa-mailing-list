&gt; Exporting crypto:

    :

&gt; There's some legal discussion regarding if downloaded software
&gt; can be said to be a "good" given some Customs Act precedents.

"Some legal discussion" is actually a great deal more than that, given 
that the enforcement agency for this in Australia has explicitly not 
done any enforcement even though they wanted to at one stage.

As you know strong crypto software illegal for export by other means (to
certain countries) has been developed and distributed over the Internet
from Australia for years. I think you are not entirely correct that the
disputed term is "good", I think it is "tangible", and Internet downloads
aren't tangible or at least were probably not when this was a major issue.
As I recall it had ceased to become a major issue even before the US
crypto laws were repealed because those in charge of enforcing this
accepted that they simply couldn't.

However companies making closed source crypto products (eg some company
in Qld with an allegedly secure 256-bit product of some sort) are most
absolutely required to have a permit to ship their stuff, in fact the
company I am thinking of didn't even bother applying as I recall.

One of the things that makes it very difficult now to even think about is
that governments which are much larger than Australia are funding open
source crypto development with public money and encouraging its
distribution via the Internet to the entire world without restriction.

So, I think you are raising valid theoretical possibilities and I am
rejoining with valid comments on facts to date. All I would say about the
possibilities you raise is that we don't need bad laws to get bad
enforcement, we can get bad enforcement anyway. So yes, there is a bad law
in place which could be used for unhelpful things like restricting crypto
exports of free software, however it doesn't seem to have ever done so
yet.

&gt; Software patents:
&gt; 
&gt; The Patent Office of IPAustralia publishes a document
&gt; "Patents for Computer Related Inventions".  The following
&gt; is an extract

    :

&gt; My view is that the interpretation of the patent laws is
&gt; sufficently broad to allow most types of software to be
&gt; patented in Australia.

As it happens I have just returned from a meeting with an IT lawyer, who
was definite that due to a variety of factors in the Australian patents
and legal system that even if granted (which is theoretically possible)
the enforcement would be somewhere between difficult and impossible. I
don't know the reasoning behind this comment because that wasn't the focus
of the meeting. The president of the EFF in Australia is a lawyer, and I'd
like to see his comment on this question.

Again, in practice this has not yet been a problem in Australia for free
software. Unfortunately software patents are a global problem, because
something written locally can be prevented from being legally run
elsewhere. 

I am not aware of any precedent that will stop Australians using source
code published on the Internet within Australia due to software patents
issued anywhere. Are you? That's not to say it can't happen in the future,
but at least we're well ahead of places where it is an unavoidable part of
the development landscape.
