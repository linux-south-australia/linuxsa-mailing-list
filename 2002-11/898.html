&gt; &gt; The four collaborating vendors are the SCO Group, Conectiva in Brazil,

&gt; &gt; been favorably received, with more than 15,000 copies downloaded.

&gt; The beta looks almost identical to SuSE Linux but without having been tidied up.
&gt; Given they are really trying to target the server market, I'm not surprised...

There are some differences such as platforms and languages SuSE isn't
particularly interested in. But by and large I think this is a correct
comment. I find it fairly consistent and solid. Usual SuSE stuff.

To pick one of the technology questions I put, when asked what their
attitude is towards UL partner Conectiva's apt-rpm they say "UL is
apt-ready, but we don't ship it switched on by default". I take this to
mean "we use Yast2 without modification, and that doesn't use apt-rpm, so
the answer is no". Of course it is apt-rpm ready. The apt-rpm HOWTO was
written first with respect to SuSE!
