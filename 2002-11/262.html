G'day.

I've just downloaded the Adam ADSL application form to check it out,
and there's a few weird parts in it, which I thought I'd repeat --
partly to ask if they are intentional, partly to share a laugh with
you all :)

p1:
"The supplied Modem/Router utilises USB, Ethernet & USB depending on
your requirements."

-- USB, Ethernet _and_ USB? Cool.

p2:
"Once completed, you may remain on the current account and purchase
the modem at a cost of $1.10 or ..."

-- $1.10? Is that for real?

p3 (this is the best one):

"Standard warrantee does not include lightning, flood, fire, liquid or
cabbage damage."

-- CABBAGE damage? I can't even begin to think of the possible
circumstances that have lead Adam Internet to think that Cabbage
damage is worth mentioning on its' own... :) I can't even think of a
possible typo for that one... :)

Also, and on a slightly less whimsical note, it doesn't mention the
details of the plan you'll be on after finishing the free data period
(see point 4 on p3). Is there a choice? Do we choose after the 1 Feb,
or when we sign on? (Note: I don't have decent web access right now,
so haven't really looked at the site -- only the PDF).

Anyway, good luck to Adam -- it's great to see multiple ISPs offering
decent, competitive plans, and being alternate-OS friendly (and
allowing multiple computers per connection etc). Certainly makes it
hard to choose between Adam and Internode.
