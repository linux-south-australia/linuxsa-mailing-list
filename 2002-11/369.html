&gt; A thought which just occurred - comment from John or Simon maybe - Would
&gt; ISPs ever be willing to make a plan that slowed you to 56k once you hit
&gt; your limit and then sucked your usage away from next month's allowance?
&gt; I don't know how much of revenue such a stream would kill, but the user
&gt; would just be able to use his connection without fear, and the ISP would
&gt; know how much it was getting, and waht it was for.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, just a thought. But I think that I would pay a premium for such
&gt; ($10/month maybe).

&gt; &gt; Firstly, thanks John for posting this to the list.  I am interested in finding
&gt; &gt; out more about linux friendly DSL ISP's available in Adelaide and by the
&gt; &gt; feedback on the list a lot of others are as well.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Could you please expand clearly on what mirrors are available from Adam and
&gt; &gt; confirm that these are Quota free?  Is there a URL to a list of resources
&gt; &gt; available on your mirrors and how often they are updated?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also is there any guarantee on uptime, response time on outages?  I know your at
&gt; &gt; the mercy of Telstra for most of this but I also have experience of ISP's that
&gt; &gt; would go down constantly, and not really care because there was no uptime
&gt; &gt; warrantee for ADSL clients.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One other item, Optus cable kicks you down to 56k once you exceed your data
&gt; &gt; quota, I like this feature, as I don't like surprises in my bill at the end of
&gt; &gt; the month.  Is this possible with ADSL through Adam?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TIA,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mick
