Summarising:

The client IPs are right (as they should be since in one case they come
from the same machine and in the two other cases the furthest apart they
are is one switch).

&lt;grin&gt; yes, the domain names are right.

&gt; Dan,
&gt;
&gt; Have you double checked the apache log to make sure that your test
&gt; requests are coming from your IP, not a proxy or transparent proxy?
&gt;
&gt; Your config looks ok, and if DNS lookups from that machine are working
&gt; there is no reason it shouldn't work. Obviosuly with the proviso that
&gt; the domains are correct.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,

and...

dig shows that the top listed DNS is being used for name resolution and
the reason is given as `client denied by server configuration' which is
what you'd expect since removing the deny line allows access.

&gt; What does the apache error log say about the reason for denial?
&gt;
&gt; Last week there were some serious flaws revealed in bind that may have
&gt; prompted an upgrade, or disabled recursion. Check that 'dig' is using
&gt; the same IP addresses as those listed in resolv.conf.
