It depends on who you're advising and what the job in mind is. I would
probably start by looking at the printing devices you're planning on using.
If you know that you'll always be using Model X of Brand Y, I would consult
the Printing Database and other resources at:

  <A HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org/">http://www.linuxprinting.org/</A>

If you don't know which printing devices will be used, you'll probably find
that most printers would be supported with the CUPS + gimpprint-cups
combination will yield good results.

Another factor is the platforms you'll be dealing with. For most
heterogeneous environments, you'll often see a mix of SMB/CIFS, HP JetDirect
and LPR/LPD. It's possible to use each of the three printing systems you're
mentioned with each of the above protocols (SMB/CIFS with a little help from
Samba), but you'll find that CUPS has better support for some of the
protocols and supports IPP, which is fantastic for when Windows or NetWare
are involved. CUPS also runs on most flavours of UNIX (including things like
Mac OS/X), which makes it a pretty good printing system if support for other
systems is an issue.

Who would have thought that so much could be written / said about printing
:-)


thx,
Matt
