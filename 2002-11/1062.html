Thks Alex & others

Unfortunately, the desktop file already reads

DESKTOP=GNOME

but I still end up in KDE when I type  

startx 

after booting up in run level 3.

At least I'm being forced to learn a bit more about KDE!

&gt; If the other suggestions from people on the list don't help you much (as
&gt; I dont think they will), you can try hand editing the
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/desktop file so that DESKTOP="KDE" becomes
&gt; DESKTOP="GNOME" or vice versa. All the gui's just try to edit this file
&gt; and also play about with complex arrangements of .xinitrc.switchdesk
&gt; files and .Xclients-default files etc.....
&gt; You can run around for a long time trying to understand all those
&gt; dotfiles so the quick solution is the /etc/sysconfig/desktop file. Just
&gt; be aware that dotfiles in $HOME/ can sometimes lead to confusion.
&gt; 
&gt; man XFree86 and man xinit etc... for more details of files and filepaths
&gt; searched.
