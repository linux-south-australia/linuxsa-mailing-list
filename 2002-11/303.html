&gt; In your summary of the legal situation you didn't mention that .au doesn't
&gt; have two US problems: exporting crypto (via Internet), and software
&gt; patents.
&gt; 
&gt; There may potentially be some corner cases but by and large this is true.

Exporting crypto:

S112 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and Customs (Prohibited
Exports) Regulations 1958 13B and 13E prohibit exports of
goods in the "defence and strategic goods list".  This list
implements the Wassenaar Arrangement.  The current list
isn't available for public inspection (it is said to be
under significant review), so quite how they intend to
successfully prosecute people exporting items on the list
is beyond me:-)

Anyway, the (old) list contains dual-use crypto products with
the same definition as the Wassenaar Arrangement.  So you
need an export permit or licence from Defence Materiel
Organisation.

There is an exception:

&gt; EXPORT OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC GOODS FOR PRIVATE USE
&gt; 
&gt; The export controls recognise the legitimate use of information
&gt; security products to protect company information when employees are
&gt; overseas on business. The temporary export of these products is
&gt; permitted when they accompany their user for the user s personal
&gt; use. No formal approach to the Department of Defence or statement to
&gt; the Australian Customs Service is required.
&gt; 
&gt; The temporary export of cryptographic hardware or software products by
&gt; Australian citizens or lawful permanent residents is permitted on the
&gt; conditions that the items:
&gt; 
&gt;   a. are not sold, loaned or otherwise transferred; 
&gt;   b. remain under the control of and in the possession of the exporter;
&gt;   c. are not to be reproduced or copied;
&gt;   d. must return to Australia with the exporter; and
&gt;   e. shall not be used for demonstration, marketing or sales purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; If the cryptographic products are lost or stolen while outside of
&gt; Australia, the exporter shall advise the DTCC Section of the
&gt; Department of Defence, in writing, of the incident within 14 calendar
&gt; days of returning to Australia.

There's some legal discussion regarding if downloaded software
can be said to be a "good" given some Customs Act precedents.


Software patents:

The Patent Office of IPAustralia publishes a document
"Patents for Computer Related Inventions".  The following
is an extract

&gt; Software
&gt; 
&gt; Developments in Australia and overseas over the past decade have
&gt; enabled a diverse range of software to gain patent protection in
&gt; addition to protection under copyright.
&gt; 
&gt; Software is patentable if it includes a mode or manner of achieving an
&gt; end result that is artificially created and has economic
&gt; utility. Whether a particular invention falls within this definition
&gt; may be a matter for professional legal advice. However, a rough rule
&gt; of thumb is that the invention must be industrially applied. Software
&gt; that is merely a procedure for solving a given type of mathematical
&gt; problem is not patentable. Consequently mathematical algorithms and
&gt; abstract intellectual concepts, on their own, are not suitable for
&gt; patents.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a software innovation we suggest it is vitally important
&gt; that you consider seeking patent protection. You should seek advice
&gt; from a legal professional, eg a qualified patent attorney, who will be
&gt; able to advise you as to appropriate forms of protection and whether
&gt; patent protection is appropriate in your circumstances.
&gt; 
&gt; The following are examples of software suitable for patents:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Software included within an industrial process controller.
&gt; 
&gt; An example of a claim for such an invention is:
&gt; 
&gt;   "A method of producing a vulcanised rubber product by:
&gt; 
&gt;     (a) closing a vulcanising mould;
&gt;     (b) filling the mould;
&gt;     (c) heating the mould;
&gt;     (d) constantly measuring the temperature and pressure in the mould
&gt;         and providing these measurements to a computer;
&gt;     (e) calculating in the computer the value of the temperature
&gt;         multiplied by the pressure; and
&gt;     (f) when the value exceeds 3000, opening the mould and removing
&gt;         the product."
&gt; 
&gt; Even though this claim includes at item (e) a mathematical program in
&gt; a computer, the claimed method is suitable subject matter for a patent
&gt; because the program is applied to an industrial process.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Software directed to the operation of a computer.
&gt; 
&gt; For example such software may control data flow within the computer,
&gt; or enable the computer to operate faster, or allow the computer to
&gt; handle larger files, or produce a better quality of output display.
&gt; 
&gt; An example of a claim for such types of inventions is:
&gt; 
&gt;   "A method of reducing turnaround time in an edit-compile-link-run
&gt;   cycle of a programming development system, comprising the steps of:
&gt; 
&gt;     (a) editing a module of application source text, said source text
&gt;         being resident in a file system and held during all editing
&gt;         actions in virtual memory in a source text buffer including a
&gt;         plurality of lines;
&gt;     (b) incrementally compiling said module of application source text
&gt;         to create a module of executable application code;
&gt;     (c) incrementally linking said module of executable application
&gt;         code to create in memory an executable form of application
&gt;         program;
&gt;     (d) executing said executable form of the application program in
&gt;         place."
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Electronic commerce.
&gt; 
&gt; Patent applications directed to electronic commerce are similarly
&gt; acceptable if there is an end result or way of achieving an end result
&gt; that is an artificially created state of affairs of economic
&gt; utility. Examples of applications for electronic commerce that may be
&gt; patentable include methods of enabling electronic transactions, or
&gt; methods of electronically creating or monitoring interactions of
&gt; Internet sites, or creating electronic links between customers and
&gt; suppliers and banks.
&gt; 
&gt; The following is a suitable example of a claim related to electronic
&gt; commerce:
&gt; 
&gt;   A value transfer system comprising:
&gt; 
&gt;     (a) a plurality of electronic purses and interface devices whereby
&gt;         purses may communicate with each other to transfer value by
&gt;         means of transactions;
&gt;     (b) each of which involves an exchange of electric signals between
&gt;         a pair of purses;
&gt;     (c) each purse including memory means storing a record of the
&gt;         accumulated value currently contained within the purse;
&gt;     (d) the system being characterised in that each purse is assigned
&gt;         a class in a hierarchical structure and in that said memory
&gt;         means further stores a record of the class of that purse
&gt;         together with a list of those classes to which that purse can
&gt;         transfer value.
&gt; 
&gt; The above examples are only illustrative of some types of software
&gt; innovations that are suitable for patent protection.

My view is that the interpretation of the patent laws is
sufficently broad to allow most types of software to be
patented in Australia.

Regards,
Glen
