Michael,

[ having snipped what Greg said ]

&gt; These are good thoughts Greg - thank you for sharing them.

I tend to agree but I don't agree with all of them.

&gt; I guess you can always throw SAGE-AU and Airnet into the "SA geek crowd" as 
&gt; well.  More broadly you could include AJUG, ACS, and SEA.  Why are there so 
&gt; many groups?!? :)

Because they all have separate, specific objectives. I think they could be part
of The AUUG Inc, or even The LinuxSA Incorporated if only one of them would
actually work out how to deal with Special Interest Groups (a).

SLUG (Sydney Linux User Group) seems to have SiGs.

&gt; [1] the reason why is another thing.  Perhaps existing groups aren't meeting 
&gt; new needs.

Maybe they are, maybe they are not; having a suspicion that I know what you are
talking about this other group may distribute open source software which only
runs on Wintel platforms.

And I would hardly think that is part of The AUUG Inc or LinuxSA Inc stated
objectives. Its objectives are wider.

Noone sleeps, godly prince so cold
 Keep guard by the stars, fill my heart with love
Your love is a mystery to me, my heart grows old
 And though the stars tremble at your name
How I long to know you again!
