PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

            AUUG Welcomes Government Moves Toward Open Computing

The AUUG Open Computing for Government Committee welcomes Australian Federal
      Government moves toward an Open Computing e-government strategy.
  
SYDNEY, Australia -- 14 November 2002 -- The Australian UNIX and Open
Systems User Group (AUUG, Inc.) today welcomed the identification of Open
Standards and Open Source as critical factors for the "Efficient Application
of Technology" in the high level e-government strategy "Better Services,
Better Government" launched this week by the Minister for Communications,
Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston.
 
AUUG formed the Open Computing for Government (OCG) committee to help
accelerate the adoption of Open Computing within all areas of the Australian
Government sector.
 
"The Open Computing for Government Committee has had the opportunity to
provide input to Government on several occasions since its formation, and we
have been pleased with the positive reception and results thus far", said
Gordon Hubbard, Chairman of the AUUG Open Computing for Government
committee. "There are still many hurdles to cross, but Open Standards and
Open Source is now definitely on the agenda in Canberra."
 
AUUG has been invited to present at a seminar for departmental Chief
Information Officers (CIOs) and Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) on
government demand for Open Source Software that will be held by the National
Office for the Information Economy (NOIE) in mid February 2003.
 
AUUG commends the following statements from the "Better Services, Better
Government" strategy document:
 
     "The Government will encourage trials of open source software
     within the framework of fit-for-purpose and value-for-money."
 
     "..... the range of available software and software business
     models is increasing and the full range of options will continue
     to be considered and understood when making choices about
     whole-of-government architecture."
 
     "Re-use of assets will be enhanced by greater commonality of
     architecture and open standards. For example, in the e-Europe 2005
     Action Plan, there is a commitment to have an agreed
     interoperability framework in place for members of the European
     Union by the end of 2003. It will be based on open standards and
     encourage the use of open source software."
 
"AUUG congratulates NOIE on its leadership in this vital area of national
infrastructure, and commends the vision of Senator Alston in ensuring that
Open Source is regarded as a model appropriate for use by Australian
Government", said AUUG President Greg Lehey.
