&gt; You've also got to consider that Adelaide is at the far

&gt; another conference, IETF meeting, etc that was being held
&gt; in Australia.

I think you misunderstand the goals of l.c.a. As I have had it explained
to me just yesterday by the Perth committee it is intended to be very
heavy with Australian content. Brisbane was last year too. Getting some
speakers from overseas doesn't seem to be a problem, in fact choosing
between them all seems to have been the difficulty. 

In addition, in free software circles the international awareness of
Australia is much higher than with telecommunications or Internet or
software engineering etc.

A number of people have mentioned to me that they would like to help
organise a 2004 l.c.a held in Adelaide, and I have encouraged them to talk
to one another and with professional conference/expo organisers. So far,
l.c.a has managed to avoid having an associated expo. I think it would be
a very good thing and maybe by 2004 the event will have matured enough for
that to happen.
