&gt;Heheheheh I love it :-) sounds like me when I get desperate. Reminds me 
&gt;of something I found years ago while looking up help for ed (back when 
&gt;everything *was* text)... perhaps it's appropriate reading given the 
&gt;latest flame war ;-)

Teehee - brilliant!
IBM actually had several different editors which worked like ed, all
using slightly different commands to ensure maximum confusion.

ed is great for when you just want to change one or two lines in a
file without losing the context of what you were working on.

I once wrote a Unix bulletin board that was a clone of one I'd used on
an IBM system where the only available editor was ed-like. Naturally,
my board defaulted to using ed to compose new messages and replies.
People moaned at me, so I allowed it to use any editor. People who
then used vi or emacs tended to send in silly replies, because when vi
started up it cleared the screen of the text of the message they were
replying to, and they forgot what that message had actually said.

ed is also great when the only alternatives are vi and emacs. vi in
particular is a killer app, ie. you start it, nothing works, and to
get out of it you have to log in from another terminal and kill the
process. In fact most Linux editors seem to default to working
similarly. Horrid, horrid, horrid. Personal preference, of course.
