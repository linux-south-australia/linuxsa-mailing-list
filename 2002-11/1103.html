&gt;And while we're on the topic, what's with the power connectors on
&gt;UPS's?  They all seem to have the male computer power connectors
&gt;(don't know the real name for that style of three-prong), which means
&gt;you can't plug just any old device into them, you have to have one
&gt;that takes the right type of cable. Why don't they just have the
&gt;normal Australian-style connectors? Can you get adapters, so I can
&gt;plug (say) a Modem PSU into it? Is there any reason why you shouldn't?
&gt;I mean, seriously, who has oodles of male-female computer three-prong
&gt;power cords lying around anyway? &lt;/rant&gt;

That is a valid point, though I think you'll find most UPS vendors offer
a powerboard type arrangement on some of their lower end ones which take
the standard 3-pin AC plug.  I have a Sola UPS at home, 305/425 I think,
which has this setup, but it does jack when the power goes off apart from
prolong the inevitable abrupt shutdown of my PC because as yet I haven't 
been able to get nix to talk to it....
