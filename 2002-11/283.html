The media has a lot to answer for, they are greedy, lazy & have to be bought.

A biological Australian Research Society has an annual national science
research week.  The committee manages to gets limited media coverage by
writting the articles for the journalists, 'plying them with good food & wine,
and using every personal contact anyone has.  We hit the papers, radio &
television in a well co-ordinated manner using hired PR consults.  We even get
captains of industry, politicians & one year the Australian Noble Laureat to a
dinner. 
Solomon Lew seems to have the budget for it.

Hi.

Largely seems to come down to whether the organisers are 'in' with the
media. Remember the Jazz festival down at Glenelg a couple of weekends
ago? I knew it was on, and bought the Saturday 'tiser to see who was
playing. What did I find? One tiny paid ad in the what's on section! You
wouldn't find it if you weren't specifically looking for it.

There is lots of stuff 'on' in Adelaide, but it beats me how anyone finds
out about it.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; I agree... I couldn't believe that such an event occurred in Adelaide

&gt; I'm not a big TV viewer, but I read the Australian and Advertiser
&gt; everyday. Was there even an ad in the papers?

&gt; &gt; Ian,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; You could say that most of the people stayed away in droves. How to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get a good profile for such an event?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I haven't seen any advertising for it at all apart from on LinuxSA...and
&gt; &gt; I watch a little TV, read a little newspapers...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; *hmmm*
