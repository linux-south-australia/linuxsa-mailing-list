Hi all,

So, I bought one of those newfangled D-Link DWL520 PCI WiFi cards from
Microbits, and installed it in my new server. It now works, and I'm
typing this email from my XP latop over an ssh link through the WiFi
card. Hurrah. I could be in the toilet, and none of you would be any
the wiser.

Anyway, I can hear you all asking how I did it, so I'll explain as
best as I can remember. This should be pretty much identical for any
Prism2 based card. This is specifically to set it up as an Access
Point, using the hostap_pci driver, but you can use this driver for
other forms of access as well.

1. Install Woody (not really neccessary, but that's what I did).
2. Download the Kernel Headers.
3. Download the hostap driver source from hostap.epitest.fi
4. Edit the Makefile so the KERNEL_PATH variable points at your
headers.
5. type "make pci" -- assuming you have a pci card like mine. (You'll
need gcc and a few other things as well, obviously)
6. type "make install_pci".
7. "modprobe hostap_pci"
8. "ifconfig -a" -- you should see a wlan0 interface.
9. Install wireless-tools.
10. "iwconfig wlan0 mode Master" -- to set it to be an Access Point.
11. "iwconfig wlan0 essid &lt;Network Name&gt;"
12. "iwconfig wlan0 key s:&lt;WEP Key&gt;"
13. edit /etc/network/interfaces, adding an entry for the wlan0
interface -- you configure it exactly how you would configure a normal
interface.
14. "ifup wlan0"
15. You have Wireless. Look at the iw* tools and the usual network
tools. You'll need another wireless PC to test the network with, but
that would have gone without saying.

You may have to mess about a bit with some of that -- I did it by
trial and error, and may have missed one or two bits out. If I have,
could someone correct me? Thanks :)
