Hi.

We have two of the IBM DLT's, and they did cause hassle early on, until we
updated the firmware. There has been no problem since (daily use, over a
year now) We did the firmware update ourselves, I don't think we got
around to asking IBM for help on that.

We have also had very little problem with sony dat drives under linux or
NT, so I cannot concur on that either. (sorry!) :)

&gt; also as far as hardware, i wouldn't touch the quantum rebadged as ibm DLT
&gt; drives.  we've had a lot of issue which IBM palms off as 'driver' or
&gt; 'firmware' problems.  the HP slim ones seem ok so far...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I am looking into getting a tape drive to do backups on a freebsd
&gt; &gt;system, what systems are the most easy to live with? At the moment I
&gt; &gt;have Sony tape drives but they seem a little unfriendly to
&gt; &gt;anything not MS...
&gt; 
&gt; We have both a Sony DAT and a Sony AIT in different boxes, both running
&gt; Linux and Arcserve, never had a problem with either drive.  We have had
&gt; hassles with other Sony DAT drives in a number of NT servers (hardware
&gt; fault, not OS) so I wouldn't recommend their DAT drives.
&gt; 
&gt; Depending on what your requirements are, I'd recommend AIT, its the first
&gt; one I've had
&gt; the pleasure of installing, but it kicks serious butt over DAT, the only
&gt; downside
&gt; is the cost of the media in comparison (work on price per MB and the sums
&gt; are
&gt; a bit easier to sell).
&gt; 
&gt; (I'm unsure how compatibility with FreeBSD goes, but I guess it wouldn't
&gt; be too far off that of Linux as far as tape hardware goes)
