Francesco et al,

&gt; &gt; Thanks mate, while the younger members may wonder why those of the 
&gt; &gt; older generation remember days like this, the younger generation
&gt; &gt; have the life they have because the older generation built a future
&gt; &gt; so that their children could grow up in freedom.

I cannot agree with that statement more, but it is a process of change
and learning. 

It is a process where it is the duty of the elder to teach
the young and for the young to learn, and for the young to teach the
elder to broaden horizons and to help the elder live in this continually
evolving world.

&gt; &gt; The sacrifices of those that didn't return and the sacrifices of
&gt; &gt; those that returned but as broken men and women are a big part of
&gt; &gt; what has built this country up. It is a proud tradition and deserves
&gt; &gt; to be not just maintained but adopted and supported by the younger
&gt; &gt; generation.

Then perhaps next year we, as a vibrant, living community should think
of a way to remember this day in a way that is special to us and
focusses on what we do best.

Let me put some thoughts together on this.
