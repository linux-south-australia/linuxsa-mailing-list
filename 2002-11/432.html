&gt; Yep I have to say I have found much the same thing. It's sometimes
&gt; just too much for them as well.. (Beyond their ken at that point) Norm
&gt; will go WOW and then hide 'neath the nearest rock. A norm++ may see the
&gt; posibilties though.&gt; 

I am one of the norm(a)++s who may see the possibilities though.

So why haven't I loaded some Linux software and jumped in full
bottle?
It is just too much, and I'm not hiding underneath the nearest
rock. [One of the reasons I joined the Linux SA list was to learn
what I could, in my case start learning the language (aka jargon,
but it really is technospeak and essential to master.)]
It is just too much because I do other things - currently I have
exams starting next week and I'd like to put in a submission on GE
Food before 15/11. Apart from that I am trying to get my head
around PODI* and PPML** and to research the market for on demand
book printing and capital requirements, and supporting my ageing
mother and visiting my daughter in Victoria, and maintain a house
and garden, and .. oh, yes and to earn a crust. 

For me my computer is a tool, to send and get e-mail, to get
information, to write on.
Why am I considering open source?
I have a 486 and it is getting slower and slower, and hangs a lot
more, and although I could replace it there are other things I'd
prefer to do with my money - e.g. go see my daughter. Apart from
which as a greenie I like to make things last, and don't like to
buy things unnecessarily.
Why haven't I done it yet?
I'm nervous about doing it. 
+   I'll have to partition my hard disc, what if I lose things?
+   I've got some favourite programs 
one End Note is perfectly legal, but it was provided to me under
an education licence and can't reload it - which means I'll have
to buy it $700 odd, 
and the other a nice little game of jigsaw puzzles which I bought
online and I'll have to go through a lot of hassles 
+    I've been saving a lot of my emails to save the hassle of
going to archive files when I want info from 5 years back. One day
I'll find a good search engine so that I can burn them to disc and
take them off the hard drive.
+    I'll have to keep on hunting on line for things such as
drivers and fixes and stuff. I loathe internet searching and avoid
it as much as I can.
+    All the open source material  I've seen wants you to have a
pentium processor. Oh yes, there are "light" versions on the net.
After searching through an arcana of technobabble, and after
downloading for an hour and half, the system has a hernia, I get
an error message and the download is incomplete. Try again? you've
got to be kidding see previous point.

Quite frankly it is too hard, and the fault doesn't lie with me. I
am the customer. The customer is always right. And I don't
necessarily want to get it for free#.

Now consider - I'm what is called an early purchaser and I still
haven't converted. Microsoft's success lies in identifying what
the customer wants, the essence of which is "plug and play". When
open source delivers plug and play, MS will go the way of Apple.

I think there is a right price*** for software - 
something like $70 to $100 for big software such as -an operating
system, cad/cam, and graphics ; $29.95 for packages such as
spreadsheets, word processing, slide presentations, maths (as
opposed to word) processing, music writing ; and $5 for drivers
and other things that make thingies work.



* printing on demand initiative
** personalized print mark-up language
*** there's a right price for video recordings (tape and dvd)
$14.95, music cds $11.95 and paper back books $6.95. Everything
else is overpriced. :)

PS David did you like the formatting? :)
