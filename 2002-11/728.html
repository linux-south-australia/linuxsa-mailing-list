&gt; &gt; That's true, I agree. However, I think that it is important to ask
&gt; &gt; whether it's a charitable donation or a business decision (for example
&gt; &gt; USD100M on leprosy which would be more useful in India, but less sexy
&gt; &gt; from a PR perspective, might have been more appropriate?).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not certain whether I would want to classify various diseases as
&gt; "more sexy" or "less sexy" from a PR perspective than any other. What
&gt; you say may be true--I don't doubt that--but, to quote from a particular
&gt; musical about a particular saviour, "there will be poor always
&gt; pathetically struggling".

It strikes me that Bill Gates is engaging in that very human behaviour of 
altruism and impressing people with large numbers.

It is well known [1] that the level of altruism displayed by humans (and 
other species) is inversely proportional to the level of expected future 
interaction.

In Bill's case, and the case of other noted philanthropists, their 
expected future interaction is high. Bill expects to sell many of us one 
or more products in the future.

In the case of his detractors, they too are engaging in that well known 
human behaviour of pointing out that the most successful altruists minimise 
the cost of their altruism while maximising the benefit.
