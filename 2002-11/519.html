&gt; Geepers, that doesn't leave much for design then! :)

Not at all, have you seen the size of the CSS2 spec? :)

&gt; I agree with not using SPAN tags but DIV tags can be handy.

Yeah, there are situations where you just can't get away with anything 
else. Still, avoid {over|mis}using them. A common example is using 
something like:

&lt;div class="heading"&gt;My document's title&lt;/div&gt;

and using CSS to style that div to look like a heading, instead of:

&lt;h1&gt;My document's title&lt;/h1&gt;

and styling the h1 to look how you want. The former is meaningless 
drivel, the latter is a nicely styled heading, even if they look the same.

&gt; Not using tables for layouts, hmm. well not sure on that one, I use 
&gt; tables,
&gt; the only reason I haven't migrated to CSS is because of backwards
&gt; compatiblity, a lot of old browsers don't like the new css tags.

Yeah, but they're all a lost cause anyway. If you follow the best 
current paractices, then your pages will at least still be readable in 
old browsers. Bear in mind that a lot of older broswers don't support 
tables properly, either. In these cases CSS-based layout degrades well, 
table-based layout does not.

Check this out: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.meryl.net/css/&gt">http://www.meryl.net/css/&gt</A>;. 1000 web sites which don't 
use tables for layout. It's a bit out of date, but hey.

&gt; and HTML 4.01 Transitional seems to work just fine with 99% of browsers.

Yeah, but -transitional is just -strict with all the extra, bad, 
proprietry crap left in. If you're not using junk like &lt;font&gt; then you 
don't need to use -transitional.

&gt; One way which you can get around some of the interim 4x browsers

[snip: the @import trick]

Yep, which is quite useful, but it is a blight on what may othwerwise be 
good markup. Which is why I generally try to write CSS that doesn't 
cause those broken browsers to choke too badly.

&gt; I beg to differ. Dreamweaver MX does a very reasonable job of keeping its
&gt; own HTML in tow,

I haven't seen DMX's output, so I'll take your word for it. :)
