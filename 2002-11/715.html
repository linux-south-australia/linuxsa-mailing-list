&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the last year I've been forced on occasion to use a Microsoft-based
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MUA.  In order to display a number of things, I had to use it in full-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; screen mode.  That meant, however, that the displayed lines were about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 200 characters long, and there was nothing I could do about it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It sounds rather like what you had to read could not have been
&gt;&gt;&gt; presented in plain text at all.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What gives you that idea?  It was perfectly normal, unembellished
&gt;&gt; text.  The issue is that these toys are so subdivided that you can't
&gt;&gt; display enough of the subject line, for example, without going to full
&gt;&gt; screen.  Full screen is also good for tables, but it's not good for
&gt;&gt; text.
&gt;
&gt;I've used MS Mail, MS Outlook and MS Outlook Express and they all can
&gt;display a mail message in a window with no unreasonable adornment.
&gt;It sounds like you were using Outlook, and viewing the message in the
&gt;preview pane.

You could use Forte Agent, which you can configure so that the preview
pane is the full width of the screen.

&gt;If the problem was merely an excessively long subject line there were
&gt;other alternatives, too, for example dragging the mouse through the
&gt;subject to scroll it, or cut-n-paste the subject to a different window.
&gt;I'm not saying these are nice things to have to do, but they are
&gt;quite reasonable for the pathalogical case you seem to be describing.
&gt;A standard 80 character window could have had the same sorts of problems
&gt;with that message, so you seem to have described a situation where HTML
&gt;email probably was, or would have been, an improvement.

A text-mode screen would probably have wrapped the long lines
automatically, without anyone ever thinking about it, because text
output functions like printf() work like that. OK so you get some
unhyphenated word breaks and some short lines, but that's a lot easier
to deal with than having to scroll it sideways all the time.

&gt;&gt; On the contrary, it's broken.  It's uncomfortable to read text that
&gt;&gt; wide.  The same, indcidentally, applies to
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.">http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.</A>
&gt;
&gt;While I'm impressed that you have a 2048 pixel wide screen, it was
&gt;your choice to make the display so wide and so a pretty feeble attempt
&gt;at arguing a deficiency in HTML email.  I'm surprised you resorted to
&gt;such a cheap trick.  It makes you look desperate and obviously nobody
&gt;is going to be fooled by it.

It sounds to me like a last-ditch attempt to make it sort of legible!

&gt;&lt;table border&gt;
&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greg Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&gt;
&gt;This is an example of how it could be done.  I didn't try to make
&gt;it pretty.  Arguably it would be more attractive as a series of dated
&gt;quotes rather than nested cells, however it does mimick what you do
&gt;with angle brackets, while being a simple envelope to an HTML message
&gt;(ie the message within the cell maintains all of the HTML attributes of
&gt;the original message.)

I had to cut that out and paste it into a browser. Yeah, it works, but
it's no clearer than the text version, so what's the point? If
anything, it'd be more awkward when the text version to keep track of
when it gets much taller than the screen. Counting kets is easy.

A lot of this is about broken tools rather than a broken format, but
with so many broken tools, the distinction is not so important. If the
choice of tools for crimping spade connectors onto cables was those
plier things at $5 or the pukka tool at $10000, I'd solder them every
time. And if they're on a boat or somewhere else corrosion is a
problem, I solder them anyway. There seem to be a lot of boats and a
lot of plier things in the computer world.
