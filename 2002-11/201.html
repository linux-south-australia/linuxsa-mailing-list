&gt; If what we are making and giving away are tanks and the public all

&gt; 
&gt; So how do we reach the line where what is being produced by the Linux 
&gt; community is closer to the "station wagons" the public are expecting
&gt; to buy?
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe people want to buy the free software? Lindows seem to be
&gt; reaching that market. Maybe people just want to know there is some
&gt; support out there. Mandrake and certainly Red Hat seem to be playing
&gt; up to that market.

Now, I hate to be one to disagree with people but in my experience how
much support do you really get from purchasing Windows?? I've never
known anybody that rings Microsoft when they can't install windows, or
when software X doesn't run. They just take it down to the store where
they brought the PC and pay $$ to get it fixed (or they call me). I'm
sure there are more than enough people willing to provide a similar
service for linux.
