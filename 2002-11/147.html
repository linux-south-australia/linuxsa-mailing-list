I think you may be confusing acceleration with force here. g has unit
(ms^-2) which gives no indication of the mass of the object. if you stop
something suddenly, irrespective of its weight/mass it will feel a
deceleration shock that is dependent solely on it velocity prior to impact
and the amount of time it took to decelerate. The force of the shock will
differ - hence the greater feeling of pain in the foot from a dropped
brick.

BTW I would guess that shocks of ~300g would be easily acheived in low
velocity impacts because of the very short times allowed for deceleration
of a falling HDD/brick/Pen (these things don't often come equiped with
airbags or crumple zones). [0.5s to fall 2m and guess 0.01s to stop gives
acc of ~50g(rel) (impact vel of 18km/h), but a fall of much more or a more
rigid object and things rapidly increase]

cheers

&gt; &gt; Unless you have high-explosive boots, maybe you could try a warranty

&gt; Yes, but a HDD weighs a lot more than a bullet, hence it doesn't need to
&gt; be moving as fast for the same shock. Try this -
&gt; 1. raise a pen to the height of 2 m.
&gt; 2. position above foot.
&gt; 3. release pen.
&gt;
&gt; feel ok?
&gt; good.
&gt;
&gt; 4. repeat from 1. with a brick.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; PS. this advise is provided with absolutely no warranty, and may
&gt; invalidate the warranty on your pen/brick/foot also :)
&gt;
&gt; PPS. one of our clients stored a removable HDD in a filing cabinet when
&gt; it wasn't in use. Guess what happenned when they opened the cabinet a
&gt; little quickly one day? - I would guess more than the rated shock level
&gt; was achieved at impact.
