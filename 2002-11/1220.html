As an ex-ISP employee, I'd disagree with this point.

The TIO is supposed to be an office of last resort. Only get in contact
with the TIO when all efforts to resolve the issue with the ISP have
failed.


Okay, in this case, all efforts to resolve the issue may have already
been tried! Sending a letter from the directors sounds like a good idea,
but perhaps the ISP has some requirement that hasn't been met (maybe the
letter needed to be on company letterhead?) Maybe there is an
outstanding invoice issue?

I'm not trying to suggest, Michael, that you/your client/friend is in
the wrong and that the ISP is right - rather that you try everything you
can (within reason, of course!) before contacting the TIO. Don't just go
straight to the TIO whenever there is a problem.

(I'll stop preaching to the converted now :-)

This may seem a bit weird, but that's okay, because it is weird.
