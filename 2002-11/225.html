FYI,
Don't refer to them as "press releases".  Refer to them as "media releases" 
otherwise media other than newspapers can get stroppy and ignore them.

However, I'd agree that a well worded, short, media release is useful.  
Remember that they should be:

- short
- factual - no airyfairy waffly stuff.  It's got to grab their attention in 
5 sec.
- seem compelling or cover an issue that an editor would see as compelling 
and newsworthy. 
- cover of the basics of who/what/when/why in no more than a paragraph each
- easy to understand (no deep technical stuff) 
- contain GOOD quality contact information

I'd suggest using the "geeks helping charity" kind of angle.  It's a good 
human interest thing - don't push the open source thing too hard - or at 
least do it in the context of how it helps charities - not too much 
political stuff.

(My Fiancee (wife in 9 days) used to work for a PR firm and occasionally I
picked up useful tips).

If anyone writes one, send me a copy and I'll run it past her.

&gt; yes that's right, these days journos are under the same
&gt; financial constraints as everything else so you'd be
&gt; amazed (or perhaps not) how much publicity issuing
&gt; bunches of press releases gets you.
&gt; 
&gt; You may have seen my grandad on the news the other day
&gt; getting a PhD (at 92).  The uni of NSW media unit
&gt; issued a few press releases around the place and it
&gt; was covered by most/all tv channels and most major
&gt; newspapers (pretty much blanket coverage in SA and NSW).
&gt; 
&gt; I see the same thing happen with the CFS.  They have
&gt; a couple of media contact people and issue regular/lots
&gt; of press releases and a day or two later I see it
&gt; written up as a story in the Advertiser (which is pretty
&gt; much all ads, press releases, daily court records and 
&gt; the odd recycled story anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; My point? well: LinuxSA or AUUG (or whoever) can do the same
&gt; thing.  Preferably have a contact person who's good with
&gt; media/PR types and good at coming up with little "sound bites"
&gt; (and doesn't mind giving out their mobile number) and start
&gt; issuing press releases, say one every couple of days at the
&gt; start to "get noticed".  By fax (or perhaps email) is normal.

&gt; Dave.
