Richard,

&gt; I'm going to buy a UPS (hold your applause until the end, 
&gt; please), and I was wondering if anyone has experience with 
&gt; any of the brands I can get hold of easily -- specifically, 
&gt; how easy they are to configure so they will notify your 
&gt; computer of power out, impending battery out, and so on, so 
&gt; your computer can shut itself down nicely before it all gets 
&gt; messy... Brands my suppliers stock are: Pro Power, PC Power, 
&gt; Nikko, and Opti. I'm not familiar with any of these -- the 
&gt; only ones I've ever dealt with previously are SOLA and APC.

APC are good quality and have good support for linux. APC have
a linux agent for monitoring but I'm not sure about the pretty
GUI management Util. You can get VERY good pricing on APC UPS's
from Dell at the moment (approx $390 inc GST for a 700VA).As 
for all the other brands you mentioned I'm unable to comment as
I have never used any of them under linux.

&gt; Any other comments re UPSes?

Get one if you care about your machine being UP this summer and
you live in Adelaide :-)

&gt; Note that the purpose here is for a single machine, which is 
&gt; a non-mission critical server -- budget is around $250, and I 
&gt; expect to get a 500VA device for that.

Guess I should have read this bit first ;-). Not really sure if
you can get anything in this price range that is supported by
the manufacturer under linux. Most UPS in this price range are
aimed at the MASS market and unfortunatly that means Windows for
the majority of manufacturers. Someone else may prove me wrong
though.

Let us know the results of your research as it would be good to
know of a cheap UPS with support under linux.

Cheers

Matt...
