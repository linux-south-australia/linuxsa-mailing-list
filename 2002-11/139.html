Thanks. I have wanted to know that for ages. Now I have another
question:

My motherboard will take 3 x SDRAM DIMMs up to 128M each "ordinary type"
or 256M each "registered". Until I read this article I had never seen
another reference to "registered" memory.

Certainly I have NEVER seen memory advertised as being "registered", and
for this reason I have only half the memory I theoretically could have.

I don't, of course, expect anyone in Australia to give me a UK source of
133MHz registered 256M SDRAMs. What I would like to know is:
- Is being registered implied by some other feature which will be
advertised, ie. are there actually loads of registered RAMs out there
but nobody thinks it worth mentioning that feature specifically? If so,
what are they? (?Some ECC but not necessarily all?)
- Assume the shop simply shifts boxes without being knowledgeable about
their contents, but are willing to let me open the box and examine the
contents myself before buying it. Is there a distinguishing feature -
eg. characteristics of the chip type numbers, or one chip which is
different that handles the registering, by which I could identify
registered memory?

(PS: My first memory fault was on a BBC Micro. Nice BBC Micro, I could
find the dud chip with only a DVM. Unsoldering it from the motherboard
was the hardest part! Plated-through holes can be worse than
surface-mount)

&gt;
&gt; Registered Memory
&gt; Registers delay memory information for one clock cycle to ensure all
&gt; communication from the chipset is collected by the clock edge,
providing
&gt; a controlled delay on heavily loaded memories.
