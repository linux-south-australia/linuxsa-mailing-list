OK, I have trimmed a lot of what david has said to get at the meat.

&gt; Looking at Foreshew's article in The Australian, I can see how perhaps
&gt; what was written make sense in "lay terms".  From a copyright point of
&gt; view developers do not lose the ability to assert ownership, but they do
&gt; lose the ability to assert control, which is arguably the most important
&gt; aspect of ownership to a software manufacturing business.  Sue Tippett
&gt; went on to highlight a concern that employees (of a software developer)
&gt; could, for example, use a piece of open-source software that they download
&gt; from somewhere, and incorporate it into a program for their employer
&gt; without understanding the implications.  This is a very real threat.
&gt; Let me give you an example that's close to home.  I'm working on a large
&gt; COBOL system, making it run on linix.  Part of my task is to locate a
&gt; suitable compiler, one that is free of run-time royalties.  Two compilers
&gt; (Tiny Cobol and Open Cobol) were suggested to me (by my client.)
&gt; Both of them use the GNU readline library, which is GPLed not LPGLed.
&gt; My client does not want to release his software as open-source, and
&gt; while I noticed the "threat," others in a similar situation might not,
&gt; and so might have put my client in breach of the GPL.

Having also been involved in cases where people want to use Open Source 
software (BSD and GPL licences) in products, I agree with David's 
concerns.

However, I think that the original article was poorly constructed. The 
opening sentences were:

"MANY developers and users of open source software were exposing 
 themselves to legal threats and vulnerabilities yet to be tested under 
 Australian law, an expert has warned."

&gt; Tippetts whole trhust was about developers exposing themselves to legal
&gt; threats. 

I think Foreshew was aiming it at both developers and users.

&gt;           It is true that the GPL does attempt to disclaim liability
&gt; from all damages, but you must understand that the GPL was written in,
&gt; by and for America.  Laws differ in different countries, which is why
&gt; Microsoft have separate Australian, English, and German licences from
&gt; their US licence.  Where is the Australian GPL?  If a clause in the
&gt; GPL is illegal under Australian law it might invalidate the complete
&gt; contract in Australia.  Certain liabilities cannot be disclaimed in
&gt; Australia, and any attempt to do so is illegal.  The GPL has not been
&gt; tested in Australian and so it's unknown what protection, if any, it
&gt; offers Australian developers.

These are true, and the article could have said more about the differences 
between US and Australian law here.

&gt; Tippett was not criticising the GPL because customers lose warranties or
&gt; indemnities.  Such clauses are standard in all modern software licences.
&gt; She is warning developers that they might not have the protection that
&gt; they think they do.

However, she does say: 

 "The lack of a liability regime also meant the distributor was not liable 
 for defects in the product, which may cause data loss or systems to 
 crash."

I can only construe this as a comment by the author, and not Tippet, as 
there are no quote marks nor any attribution for that sentence. It seems 
to imply to me that the author thinks that such a liability exists in the 
case of Propietary products and not Open Source Products.

I think it is wrong on two counts:

 1. Propietary Software products have long disclaimed liability, so they 
    are in the same camp as Open Source software.

 2. Australian law is blind to OSS, GPL, and Propietary when it comes to
    the liabilities you can and cannot disclaim.

&gt; Tippett's article is reasonable.  While it is not technically accurate
&gt; in all respects, as an article for the general public it does express
&gt; the legal situation well.

I would have to give it one out of four here, because it does point out 
part of the problem WRT GPL, however, it does not go into sufficient depth 
and gets another part wrong.

Further, a quote in the article that I have problems with is:

 '"From a copyright point of view, developers are most at risk because 
   they lose the ability to assert ownership. But from the customer's 
   point of view, the warranties, indemnities, the IP ownership and all 
   those sorts of things are important," she said. '

Here the author is reporting Tippet's opinions. The first part is simply 
painted with too broad a brush, and lawyers should be the first to realize 
they should not make such sweeping statements. Of course, it could be that 
the author did not report certain other words Tippet said.

David has indicated some of the subtleties of the issues. Simply because 
you use GCC, does not cause you to loose control of the ownership of your 
product, however, using a compiler that uses a GPL's library that will be 
linked into your product, creates an issue.

Likewise, using Linux as the OS does not create an issue for you if your 
IP is tied up in applications that run on top of Linux. After all, people 
who ship products that run on NT do not loose control of their IP either.

Then the second statement also seems very wrong, because, it seems to me 
that the warranties and indemnities are something that the final seller is 
responsible for providing, regardless of the provenance of the actual 
software. 

Also, I am mystified about the IP statement. From a pure risk point of 
view, a GPL'd product reduces some risk, because the customer is entitled 
to get the source, if they want it. If their supplier exits the market, 
the customer has the ability to get other people to maintain the product 
for them, while with a propietary product with propietary IP that is 
almost never an option. 

&gt; By contrast, Sam Varghese's rebuttal in the Sydney Morning Herals contains
&gt; serious inaccuracies.  Tippett never said "don't use sofwtware that is
&gt; released under GPL," as Varghese claims.  In fact, Tippett went so fare
&gt; as to state some benefits of GPL relating to cost, development time and
&gt; time to fix bugs.  Even worse, Verghese said that Tippett warned users
&gt; against GPLed software because of legal threats, but actually the warning
&gt; was to the developer, not to the user.
&gt;
&gt; Varghese's observes that, "According to Moore's Law, 18 months is
&gt; considered a lifetime in the computer industry."  He misses the obvious
&gt; point which is that Tippett was discussing law, not computers.  Eighteen
&gt; months is not so long in law.

I tend to agree that Varghese's rebuttal was over the top.
