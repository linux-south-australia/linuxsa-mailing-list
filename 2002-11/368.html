Quoting <A HREF="mailto:bptimm@uwm.edu">bptimm@uwm.edu</A>:
&gt; I recently installed RedHat 8.0 on what was previously a windows machine. 
&gt; Due to antiquated ports (it is an old AMD K-6 box), I am running my
&gt; Logitech optical wheel mouse(USB) into the ps/2 port via an adapter.
&gt; While installing redhat, the installer detected the mouse just fine and
&gt; it worked for the graphical install.  however, during my first boot
&gt; after install, Kudzu (the hardware detection program) reports that my
&gt; mouse has been removed. Obviously, this is very troubling.  I have tried
&gt; several things, including tinkering with (/etc/sysconfig/hwconf), 
&gt; (/etc/fstab), and disabling gpm.  The mouse does not work in console
&gt; mode using gpm, either.  I have read other posts that said that 
&gt; X doesn't play nice with gpm if you're using a ps/2, but disabling gpm
&gt; doesn't have any affect.  I guess what the real problem is that my mouse
&gt; was somehow removed, and I'm not sure how to get it back.  Thanks for
&gt; any help.  

Hmm, do you have textutils installed? (rpm -q textutils)
That comes with /bin/cat

Ahem, sorry :)

Seriously though, disable gpm (service gpm stop; chkconfig gpm off) and run 
kudzu again and see what happens.
