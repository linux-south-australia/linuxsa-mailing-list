&gt; Hmmmm... what exactly is the problem with HTML format? Isn't that meant

&gt; not MS).

The problem with HTML is that some people don't like it.
They have their reasons, perhaps odd, perhaps not.

   - Can't be read from mail clients still used by tmany
     technical people.
   - Can be used to track e-mail usage.
   - Difficult to search using standard Unix tools.

My point is one of manners:

  - If you want to participate in discussion, then some allowance
    for the preferences of others is essential.  This applies
    as much to people hassling others for posting HTML as it
    does to the HTML posters.

  - If you are asking for help, then you are expecting people
    to do you a favour -- they're doing this for free, you are
    not their customer.  A bit of consideration about e-mail
    formats seems fair.

  - If you are promoting materials, and some of your potential
    customers are annoyed by HTML e-mail, then the obvious lesson
    is not to use it.  You could try to convert them, but this
    is unlikely to be a worthwhile use of time unless you're a
    retailer of HTML markup tags.

    Business cater to mysterious customer preferences all the time.
    Why do they like to get Christmas cards, when it's their money
    that, in the end, pays for them?  Why do they get upset about
    manufacturered additives and prefer 'natural' additives when
    the chemical reactions and amount of manufacturing input are
    about the same?  Why do they want to be told vegies are 'fresh',
    can't they tell a limp carrot?  Just accept it and move on.
