&gt; I'm seem to be still having problems with the rpm packages using RH7.2.
&gt; After installing new packages using up2date (messages at the very end) I

&gt; I get this when running strace mozilla, after lots of output.
&gt; 
&gt; unlink("/home/Lesley/.mozilla/default/ycmeibwt.slt/lock")=0_exit(11)
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone tell me what this means?
Well, unlink is delete, so its deleteing that lock file, and getting
exit code 11, whatever that is. 

Check if that lock file exists, and if your user can delete it or not.
Then delete it yourself anyway since it sounds like its just a stale
lock.
 
&gt; This is the second time I've had this happen.  Last time I tried deleting
&gt; and reinstalling the mozilla packages.  I ended up with a corrupt rpm
&gt; database and losing the GUI.  I've now reinstalled the whole system (RH7.2)
&gt; and want to get my system up to date.
&gt; Here are the messages I got after running the up2date command and
&gt; successfully installing packages.  I don't see anything here that indicates
&gt; potential problems for mozilla though.
&gt; 
&gt; warning: /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf  created as
&gt;         /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf.rpmnew

This is normal - its just not trashing your config, while providing an
upgraded template for you.

&gt; error: unpacking of archive failed on file
&gt; /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.0.4/libgcj.a;3ddcbc02:cpio:MD5sum
&gt; mismatch

This is bad. This means that your RPM is corrupted, or at least the file
was after it was written to disk for some reason. I belive if the RPM is
corrupted then it'll warn you before it starts installing - not 100%
sure on that though. Could be a hardware problem, or obscure bug that
just you are getting? 

Try grabbing the rpm manually, checking its md5sum, and installing that.
