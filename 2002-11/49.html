Probably you've used Gimp and seen all of the sliders
and wheels used to slect colours. This is because
colours are composed of multiple components. eg

Hue, Saturation and Lightness/Brightness

which correspond in physics-ish speak to:

Dominant Wavelength, Excitation purity and luminance.

I thought we were talking about Hue. The sensitivity
of the colour receptor cones inside the eye to changes
in the dominant wavelength (ie Hue) is like I said:
Red and Green are close and blue is at the back of the
field.

Luminance, or brightness is a different matter. What
humans see as colour are waves within certain
frequency band called the visible spectrum. This is
from Violet (400nm wavelength) to Red (700).

The graph of relative sensitivity of an eye to
luminance Vs the visible spectrum is a classic bell
curve. This makes sense: the eye can see brightness in
the middle of its range (550nm, or Yellow/Green), and
accuracy tails off at either end until we can no
longer detect ANY of the light at all.

ie the close a colour is to the centre of "ROY G. BIV"
the greater the eye's sensitivity to brightness.

&gt; Dial up any reference on analog television
&gt; transmission to read about
&gt; it.  There is an explanation for it, but I can't
&gt; remember it.

I think you are remembering how they got colour
signals to display on black and white TVs.

Black and white is a luminance-only signal.
