&gt; Hi, I use a nameless GeForce 2MX, and it's got a heat sink and a fan.
&gt; If I never use it even in graphics mode (ie on only ever use it as a
&gt; text console, and rarely even that), do I need the fan on it? It comes
&gt; awfully close to my SCSI card (which I can't move, as my mobo is
&gt; packed full), and would appear to me to do nothing but restrict
&gt; airflow to the heatsink anyway... What I'm really asking here is if I
&gt; don't use the card much at all, does it still get hot?

I think you'll find heat is generally related to clock speed. Depending
on the tollerances involved you might be OK just removing it. If your
lucky you might be able to find a utility that can underclock the chip,
and if you can do this you'll definatly make it run cooler. I have no
idea how much slower you'd need to run it do this safely, but when the
fan broke on my TNT2, I underclocked it by about 50mhz and ran it with
no fan with no troubles.
