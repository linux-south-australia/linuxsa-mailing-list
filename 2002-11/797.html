&gt;&gt; I think that it is, however, LinuxSA isn't a legal entity and has no
&gt;&gt; decision structure to make media contact and so forth.
&gt;
&gt; At the risk of openning yet another can of worms (I don't even *like* worms),
&gt; do people think that LinuxSA should incorporate, have elected positions, have a
&gt; membership fee and interact with the media?
&gt;
&gt; I used to be ultra-opposed to such a move.  Now I'm not so sure.

Well, I've stated my position on this in the past, but here it is
again: I don't think that Yet Another Geek Association in this space
will do any good.  Believe me, it's a lot of work, and despite the
broader membership base, AUUG is not having an easy time of it.  Yes,
you can point to the much higher "membership" of LinuxSA, but that's
precisely because it isn't incorporated.  Ask for a membership fee and
the numbers will fall back to those of AUUG.

&lt;out on a limb&gt;
When you look at it objectively, it doesn't really make sense to have
both AUUG and Linux organizations.  Logically, we're the same group of
people.  On the other hand, I know that a number of LinuxSA people
look on us as "opposition".  This is unfortunate, since we're all
pointing in (roughly) the same direction.  It would be nice for us to
come closer together, and I'd welcome suggestions about how to do
that.
&lt;/out on a limb&gt;
