&gt;&gt; Senator Lundy would be the most genuine politician I've ever met, and
&gt;&gt; she is really switched-on when it comes to IT issues. She was in
&gt;&gt; Adelaide last week, and could hold her own on discussions
&gt;&gt; about Telstra internals, and offered help in dealing with them at high-up
&gt;&gt; levels that we don't normally have access to.
&gt;
&gt; Forgive my sarcasm, but I've been working in government long enough
&gt; to have come across many upper level bureaucrats who can hold their
&gt; own in discussions about any subject you can name, including IT
&gt; issues, and are always able to help out with anything, until it
&gt; comes to the crunch and political/corporate pressure ends up forcing
&gt; them to back down from their moral high ground.

I think this is a pretty normal situation.  To quote WS Gilbert:

  When in that house MPs divide
  If they've a brain and cerebellum too
  They've got to leave that brain outside
  And vote just as their leaders tell'em to.

&gt; Don't get me wrong here, I haven't met Senator Lundy, and it'd be
&gt; great if she is as genuine as you say, but I'm skeptical of any
&gt; bureaucrats and their willingness to do anything useful for any
&gt; cause other than their own best interest, in the same way that I'm
&gt; skeptical of opposition political parties living up to what they
&gt; promise while still in opposition.  Of course, I wouldn't mention
&gt; any state governments in the same breath, and it cuts both ways,
&gt; goverments who return to opposition are suddenly so much wiser than
&gt; they were while running the state.....

I have a hearty scepticism too.  But things aren't quite the way
Senator Lundy portrays them.  As you're aware, AUUG is currently
involved in discussions with the NOIE (<A HREF="http://www.noie.gov.au/">http://www.noie.gov.au/</A>) about
the use of Open Source in the Government.  Some of us were in Canberra
on Thursday, where we had quite a long discussion with some of their
people.  I can honestly say that I'm very impressed by the people they
have there, and I think they're following the correct path for the
correct reasons (which, however, are not the reasons that I would
have).  This is the incumbent government, of course, and they're
addressing exactly the issues that Senator Lundy is talking about.
Given that, and Senator Lundy's stand (running in an open door), I
suspect that it wouldn't change under a Labor government.

AUUG has a web page up at <A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au/ocg/.">http://www.auug.org.au/ocg/.</A>  It's pretty
bare-bones at the moment, at least partially because we still don't
understand all the issues involved.  I've found it easy to get up on
my hind legs and say "The Government should be doing *this*", but
after looking at it more closely, I realize that it was easy at least
partially because I didn't understand the problem.
