 &gt;&gt;With the Microsoft agreement with the SA Education people there is
 &gt;&gt;little likelihood of any move away from MS as they are getting access
 &gt;&gt;to the licenses for a pittance, but not allowed to run other
 &gt;&gt;'opposition' stuff (from what I have heard).
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;From what I've heard, the licenses are not cheap, but are cheap in
 &gt;comparision to "proper" off-the-shelf Microsoft licensing. They can't 
 &gt;stop them from running anything else, as far as I understand, but I've 
 &gt;documented my experience in this matter below, if you're interested.

 &gt;One of the major problems with schools moving away from Windows on the
 &gt;desktop is that many South Australian schools will not save any money 
 &gt;by moving to an open source platform unless they do a *complete* move 
 &gt;(which is not going to be ideal).
 &gt;

Ok,gutsy question here....how many computers can be set up in an
installfest? Could 1 school be covered in a weekend by all of 
AUUG/LinuxSA/volunteers-for-the-day?

Some schools are just desperate for IT help, and IT help that comes with 
software -- if well-coordinated -- could be a boon. And if you think of 
schools in the less well off areas, would they qualify for Computer Bank 
to help them? If so, if enough well-organized volunteers descended at 
one time, computers could be fixed/upgraded, software installed and 
tested in a military-style operation. Not forgetting documentation, 
which schools often never see!

Just imagine, a group of working bees carrying 300 hard disks with Linux 
preinstalled on them, swapping all 300 in a weekend, taking the Windows 
disks home, formating them, putting Linux on them.

But, to leave and never come back would be irresponsible. It would take 
a significant amount of support from a committed group of liason 
volunteers to help the school with issues from classwork to network 
administration. Otherwise, it would be just another Red Escobar.

 &gt;
 &gt;The interesting part is in the calculation of the said license fees:
 &gt;
 &gt; * On the same day each year, the number of applicable machines is 
 &gt;counted
 &gt; * A per-seat fee is paid for each applicable machine. It started at 
 &gt;about $90, but within 12 months rose to about $110. Not sure what it's 
 &gt;at now.
 &gt; * Any Pentium class (or PowerPC class?) machine, whether it's going 
to &gt;run Windows or not, must be counted.
 &gt;

It seems like it would be very annoying to pay for Microsoft seats if
they were Linux machines. However, if a complete transition could be
made within a year,  the fact that $0 fees will be paid the next year,
might provide some comfort. :) Anyway, they won't end up spending any
extra money the first year, and will spend no money in the next.


 &gt;A school with around 300 machine would need to pay around $33,000 per 
 &gt;annum
