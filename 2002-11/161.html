Hi all,

Yep, it's off-topic, but hey.

My problem is that somehow, the OpenPROM on a brand spanking new
StarFire V100 [1] has decided to start booting from the net rather
than the disk as its default. I certainly didn't do that (at least, I
don't recall doing it, and I usually recall doing this kind of thing).
Does anyone recall how to change it back? I've browsed various bits of
doco, but can't find anything clear, and while OpenPROM is a great
idea, I always find it a little klutzy to use (or is it just that I am
a little klutzy when I use it).

[1] (By the way, the new SunFire V100, which is an updated Netra X1,
is great value for Sun gear. $2000 ish with an UltraSPARC IIe 550MHz,
256Mb RAM, 20GB IDE HDD, 1U Rackmount, LOM[2] and all. Sure, it's low
specc'd when compared to PC gear, but it's a real Sun, and will run
either Solaris or Linux -- though possibly not with LOM and the
Watchdog.)

[2] LOM is the best thing since Ethernet. It's Lights Out Management,
and means you can do _everything_ without touching the machine. Turn
power off _AND_ on, check temperature, turn the Fault LED on and off
-- everything except physically unplug the machine. It even has a
built-in watchdog timer. PCs REALLY need this -- but it would be nice
(though potentially impossible) if it were accessible via IP rather
than RS232.
