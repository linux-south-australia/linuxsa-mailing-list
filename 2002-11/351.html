&gt; &gt;I would use Linux (in any case) because:
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Wasn't the question office of a free version? You don't have to defend
&gt; Linux this time ;)

OOPs. I had deleted most of that mailbox.. Though I had been vaguely
following the thread.. Aplologies.&gt; 
&gt; A generic Norm might answer your points in the following way, so while
&gt; I agree with everything you say, I'm in too deep, what I want and what
&gt; Norm wants, my experience and Norm's experience of computer use are 
&gt; worlds apart, believe it or not most people don't get excited when an 
&gt; new idea in interface design comes out. People even think transparency
&gt; is a gimmick!

LOL. Yep I have to say I have found much the same thing. It's sometimes
just too much for them as well.. (Beyond their ken at that point) Norm
will go WOW and then hide 'neath the nearest rock. A norm++ may see the
posibilties though.&gt; 
&gt; &gt;1/ I "own" the tools I am using
&gt; &gt;
&gt; As long as I can use it I don't care if I "own" it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;2/ Huge range of applications
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Well we are just talking about one suit.
&gt; 
Yeah oops..
Well then perhaps the fact that the Linux Office Suites generally
accomodate the "closed" suite formats and interface "ergonomics".

&gt; &gt;3/ Better performance
&gt; &gt;
&gt; MS goes okay.
True on fast machines and latest versions. Yep unless you are pushing it
you probably wont appreciate the difference.(and lets face it none of
the major office suites are anything like fast on any platform.)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;4/ Choice of mix and match file systems
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; What's a file system?
LOL. OK OK..
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;5/ Better application (and OS) install processes
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Personal preference...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;6/ Way better security
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I lock the door every day, and I have one of those chain things for
&gt; when I am at home...
&gt; 

Sigh I guess they learn the hard way.
(I know I did)

&gt; &gt;7/ Better networking
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I own one computer at home...
&gt; 
Yep. I could mention Kernel level ip and stuff but, Norm won't get it..
&gt; &gt;8/ It's an important alternative to the "corporate norm"
&gt; &gt;(so it adds some bio-diversity to the computing world)
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I feel safe in the corporate norm. It means all my norm friends will
&gt; be able to use the files I create.
&gt; 
Well they still will if you can manage the "save -as " trick.
Besides since when did sending any doc to any other doc every really
work..?

&gt; &gt;9/ Updates to everything are really easy
&gt; &gt;(well on Debian at least)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; What's an update?
LOL. OK OK OK !
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;10/ I can get under the hood
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I am scared of hoods. Leave it down please.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;11/ I have the opportunity of contributing / putting back something
&gt; &gt;to a community.(so it is more human in approach) 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Community?? Are you a hippie long hair or something?
&gt; 
I have a beard.. You are right I am guilty..
Though maybe some of Norms more snaggy mates (or matettes) may
appreciate the sentiment..

&gt; &gt;12/ I can request (or
&gt; &gt;implement) features or even new applications. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; MS has already more than I ever use...

.... as long as you stay in a MS box ...

but yeah I get it .. (sad little Norm isn't he)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;13/ Stability !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I hate that MS crashes all the time... Actually you could really hype 
&gt; this angle..

Well give them a few weeks and some serious loss of work and the cost of
tools to restore their broken files .. which ususally only half work and
.... Hang on I never said anything about MS crashes..

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;14/ I can jump onto the "train" at any level form absolute newbie 
&gt; &gt;through &lt;shudder&gt; "poweruser" to guru/ wizard.(and/ Who uses office
&gt; &gt;suites anyway :&gt;) 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I do. And so do all of my norm friends...

Geez mate don't encourage them !


&gt; 
&gt; &gt;15/ The choice of interfaces is stunning I can find or
&gt; &gt;configure (even make) something that suites me and the way _I_ work
&gt; &gt;not the way some MS / Marketing wanker thinks I should.(E17 to
&gt; &gt;TTY/consol).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Don't you mean the nice guys at microsoft? Windows looks okay... I
&gt; like grey boxes.

So I will set you some up.. I guess there must be some nice people at
Microsoft... (they haven't all eaten each other yet)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;16/ In the end it is a more creative environment and that is a "Good
&gt; &gt;Thing" for humans.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; You are trying to tell me that thinking is a good thing? Bah... pass
&gt; me another coldie would you?

Make mine a Coopers and your on..


Sort of a sad end to a long thread really :)
Lost it's Sizzle .. :)
