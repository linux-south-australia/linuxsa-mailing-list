yes that's right, these days journos are under the same
financial constraints as everything else so you'd be
amazed (or perhaps not) how much publicity issuing
bunches of press releases gets you.

You may have seen my grandad on the news the other day
getting a PhD (at 92).  The uni of NSW media unit
issued a few press releases around the place and it
was covered by most/all tv channels and most major
newspapers (pretty much blanket coverage in SA and NSW).

I see the same thing happen with the CFS.  They have
a couple of media contact people and issue regular/lots
of press releases and a day or two later I see it
written up as a story in the Advertiser (which is pretty
much all ads, press releases, daily court records and 
the odd recycled story anyway).

My point? well: LinuxSA or AUUG (or whoever) can do the same
thing.  Preferably have a contact person who's good with
media/PR types and good at coming up with little "sound bites"
(and doesn't mind giving out their mobile number) and start
issuing press releases, say one every couple of days at the
start to "get noticed".  By fax (or perhaps email) is normal.

Dave.
