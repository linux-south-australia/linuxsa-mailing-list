<H1>Spamassassin Not Working * SOLVED * Upgrade to SuSE Linux 8.1</H1>

<PRE>
A few weeks ago I wrote that my SpamAssassin wasn't working on my local 
machine any more.

Well, I finally solved the problem today, and am ready to upgrade our 
small staff to SuSE Linux 8.1

I set SpamAssassin up exactly the way I had for the past two upgrades.

SuSE Linux 8.1 shows these packages installed:

1. perl-spamassassin 2.31
2. spamassassin 2.31
3. Perl 5.80
4. amavis-sendmail 0.3.12pre8-80 (Note default uses postfix, this might 
work, but I haven't used it)
5. fetchmail 5.9.13-47
6. fetchmailconf 5.9.13-47
7. procmail 3.15.1-307
8. sendmail 8.12.6-13


The setup I would use, and the ****changes to it***** are as follows:

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt; $HOME/.fetchmailrc :
&gt;
&gt; poll pop3.mymailserver.com with proto POP3
&gt; user '<A HREF="mailto:james@mymailserver.com">james@mymailserver.com</A>' there with password 'XXXXX' is james here


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Here's my $HOME/.procmailrc:
&gt;
&gt; Path=$HOME/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
&gt; LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log
&gt; VERBOSE=OFF
&gt;
&gt; #spamassassin
&gt; :0fw
&gt; |spamassassin -P  -c /usr/share/spamassassin                       
&gt; ****CHANGED. THIS IS NO LONGER USED  ------&gt; -c 
&gt; /usr/share/spamassassin****
&gt;
&gt; :0:
&gt; *^X-spam-Status:Yes
&gt; $HOME/spam/Inbox
&gt;
&gt; {
&gt; EXITCODE=$?
&gt; }


##################For GUI People:###########################3

fetchmail.sh

&gt;
&gt; Here is $HOME/fetchmail.sh, a shell script that starts fetchmail at 
&gt; login inside KDE.
&gt;
&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt; fetchmail

Autostart:

&gt;
&gt; A link to application, localed in $HOME/.kde/Autostart is set to run 
&gt; in the terminal. It reads this in the execute box.
&gt;
&gt; sh $HOME/fetchmail.sh


Nutscrape:

&gt;
&gt; IMPORTANT - $HOME/.mozilla/prefs.js must be edited so that the 
&gt; incoming mail server type is changed from POP3 to movemail. Movemail 
&gt; moves mail from the /var/spool/mail/james file to Netscape's local 
&gt; user inbox.



&gt;
&gt;
&gt; HOW IT WORKS:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Fetchmail retrieves mail from ISP
&gt; 2. Fetchmail gives mail to sendmail
&gt; 3. Sendmail calls up spamassassin
&gt; 4. Sendmail gives the mail to procmail
&gt; 5. Procmail sorts the mail and sends the spam to $HOME/spam
&gt; (A dummy account must be set up in netscape, to read spam, but the 
&gt; spam file must be deleted outside of Netscape 6.
&gt;
&gt; 6.The non spam mail is placed in /var/spool/mail with the local user's 
&gt; name by procmail.
&gt;
&gt; 7. When the user logs into kde, the cycle starts. By the time the user 
&gt; gets into Netscape 6, and clicks on get mail, his mail has started to 
&gt; accumulate in /var/spool/mail and will be moved with Netscape's 
&gt; Movemail to the local user inbox in Netscape.


*****NEW FEATURE*****    In SuSE 8.1 there is a new feature to 
spamassassin called spamd. I turned this on as a service from SuSE 
Control Center, system, run level editor, run level properties. I show 
this as running.

   

 :-(       :-(       :-(     PITFALLS:     :-(     :-(     :-(

Stuff that wasted my time:


1. You can't merely copy your old .procmailrc file into your home 
directory, it produce an error called "Suspicious .procmailrc file 
detected."

Its a bit annoying for someone else to be playing system administrator 
on my machine through programming.  They ought to simply offer to change 
bits to their proper configuration or not do anything at all. The 
warning is very unclear, but it is mostly related to other users having 
permissions on your .procmailrc file.

Solution:

To create the file, I used this command:

pico -w .procmailrc.

and used pico.


*****MARKING MESSAGES*****


2.  They decided that you have to turn on the "****SPAM****" markings 
for messages.  If I didn't know about looking at the message souce 
(view/message source) in Netscape, I wouldn't have a clue that 
spamassassin had determined that the message was spam.  I think that the 
reverse should be true, as it was before, so newbies that are looking 
for signs that the program works will get some indication that it does.

To change this, simply edit the configuration <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
 /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf

Change the line that reads:

rewrite_subject from 0 to 1


*****PROCMAIL CONFIGURATION SETTINGS CHANGE*****

I am refering to the removal of

"-c /usr/bin/spamassassin"

Once that was gone, the messages started getting marked as spam, and put 
in their proper place.


######  Troubleshooting symptoms  ######

1. When viewing the message source, Spamassassin is shown as having 
checked the mail, but there were no hits.

    Soltion, loose this: "-c /usr/bin/spamassassin"

2. Procmail doesn't start

    Solution, do this: pico -w .procmailrc.

3.  When I look at the message source it says that spamassassin gave the 
message 17 points, and only 5 were required.  Ho w come this mail isn't 
marked as spam, and it wasn't sent to $home/spam/Inbox (or /dev/null)?

    Solution:  You are missing the "-P" from the "|spamassassin -P" line 
in .procmailrc.  Further, if you want to mark your messages, you have to 
edit /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf to read rewrite_subject 1.
