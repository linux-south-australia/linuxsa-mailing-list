Quoting Steve Thomas &lt;<A HREF="mailto:stephen.thomas@adelaide.edu.au">stephen.thomas@adelaide.edu.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I've been trying to run Redhat (7.3) on a new Compaq (HP) EVO
&gt; D510 CMT.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT: seems they use the Intel 830/845G video card, and XFree86
&gt; seems to have problems with that chipset. Apparently they are
&gt; fixing this in XFree86 4.3, due in January. Of course, I can't
&gt; possibly wait that long! There's a fix described at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/~dawes/845driver.html">http://www.xfree86.org/~dawes/845driver.html</A> which I found more
&gt; or less incomprehensible -- too hard for me. :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, HP are now offering Mandrake on the D510, which
&gt; suggests they've fixed the problem in Mandrake, or maybe Mandrake
&gt; doesn't use XFree86.

Hi Steve,

This link you provided indicates that a late change has been made to XFree86 to 
support this graphics chip properly.  It also mentions that the change is only 
available in the latest CVS source - not in a released XF86 version.

If HP offers Mandrake it means that either they have a modified Mandrake with 
the change, or that the latest Mandrake includes this change by itself.  So you 
could try installing standard Mandrake and it may or may not work.  You could 
contact HP direct and ask them if their Mandrake is a standard Mandrake.

The other option is to go to the hardware compatability lists (like 
<A HREF="http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/">http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/</A> for Red Hat 8) to see if that graphics chip is 
supported by the latest distros.

Hope this helps,
