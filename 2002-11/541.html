&gt; My initial theory theory for this was if the HTML email was even half 
&gt; way between the .txt and .pdf files, it was too big, but O M F G ! Let's 
&gt; see the HTML advocates get out of this.

I have no idea what text you started with, so taking your message,
trimming the headers that are normally not displayed and the list
signature, I get 1,482 bytes.  Converting to HTML gives me 2,030 bytes,
which is a modest increase in size for such a small document, and gains
a significantly improved appearance.  To put this into perspective,
if I remove all headers and signatures, keeping only the body of the
mail, I get 1,030 bytes for text format and 1,181 bytes for HTML, which
is trivial.

Visual improvements using HTML are: Email addresses are reduced to
hyperlinks, as are the addresses in your signature and the "mBox" advert.
I added emphasis to your "O M F G", because obviously you wanted that
but were unable to express it in plain text ;-).  Your table is now
properly aligned and pleasantly positioned to the right of the paragraph
that introduces it.  You'll also recall that I cited tables as a key
improvement in HTML: so it's quite ironic that yours was misaligned.

These documents are available at <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn">http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn</A>
for your perusal.

&gt; I will only accept that Outlook was to blame if someone else sends me
&gt; the same thing ... not edited by hand

I have a problem with that.  My goal is to demonstrate that HTML is a
viable format.  Restricting the tool set to those known to be deficient
is manifestly unreasonable.
