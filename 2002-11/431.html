&gt;
&gt; HTML is worse than platform specific.  What you see is dependent not
&gt; only on your browser, but how you set it up.  There is as good as no
&gt; possibility that what you see on the screen is the same as what I see
&gt; on the screen.  With properly formatted plain text, or with PDF, the
&gt; discrepancies are minimal.

I don't think that matters.  Seeing how I am virtually blind*, and
therefore forced to use a 56pt font, I only get a 26 character wide
window, so your text to me is wrapped horribly no matter what.  At
least if you sent in HTML I wouldn't get stupid short line in the
middle of sentences.


&gt;&gt; I'm sure the security concerns of HTML are dead easy to work around
&gt;&gt; too - so give the web site maintainers a break eh?
&gt; 
&gt; OK, how would you stop dereferencing an embedded a tag?  I don't want
&gt; to have to think about it.

You wouldn't  One of the benefits of HTML, also it's prime purpose, is
that you can create hyperlinks.  It's not as if A tags launch themselves!


&gt; ...
&gt; This was appended to the message.  I'm sure that wasn't "intentional"
&gt; in the sense that you wanted people to see it.  It was probably just
&gt; too much effort to remove.  That depends on the tools you're using.
&gt; With good tools, it would be trivial.  But I don't know any such good
&gt; tools in the HTML space.  You'll notice that your tool also mutilated
&gt; the quoted text.

If you could find a good tool that is available on all popular platforms,
or even in source, would you then support HTML email?  Is that what it
would take?


* A blatant lie, but a good point none the less.
