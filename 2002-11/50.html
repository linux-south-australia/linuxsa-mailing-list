Here is an interesting note about luminance in OpenGL
from:
<A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/developers/code/features/KilgardTechniques/oglpitfall/oglpitfall.html">http://www.opengl.org/developers/code/features/KilgardTechniques/oglpitfall/oglpitfall.html</A>

You can use OpenGL's glReadPixels command to read back
rectangular regions of a window into your program's
memory space. While reading back a color buffer as RGB
or RGBA values is straightforward, OpenGL also lets
you read back luminance values, but it can a bit
tricky to get what you probably expect. Retrieving
luminance values is useful if you want to generate a
grayscale image.

When you read back luminance values, the conversion to
luminance is done as a simple addition of the distinct
red, green, and blue components with result clamped
between 0.0 and 1.0. There is a subtle catch to this.
Say the pixel you are reading back is 0.5 red, 0.5
green, and 0.5 blue. You would expect the result to
then be a medium gray value. However, just adding
these components would give 1.5 that would be clamped
to 1.0. Instead of being a luminance value of 0.5, as
you would expect, you get pure white.

A naive reading of luminance values results in a
substantially brighter image than you would expect
with a high likelihood of many pixels being saturated
white.

The right solution would be to scale each red, green,
and blue component appropriately. Fortunately,
OpenGL's pixel transfer operations allow you to
accomplish this with a great deal of flexibility.
OpenGL lets you scale and bias each component
separately when you send pixel data through OpenGL.

For example, if you wanted each color component to be
evenly averaged during pixel read back, you would
change OpenGL's default pixel transfer state like
this:

glPixelTransferf(GL_RED_SCALE,0.3333);
glPixelTransferf(GL_GREEN_SCALE,0.3334);
glPixelTransferf(GL_BLUE_SCALE,0.3333); 

With OpenGL's state set this way, glReadPixels will
have cut each color component by a third before adding
the components during luminance conversion. In the
previous example of reading back a pixel composed of
0.5 red, 0.5 green, and 0.5 blue, the resulting
luminance value is 0.5.

However, as you may be aware, your eye does not
equally perceive the contribution of the red, green,
and blue color components. A standard linear weighting
for combining red, green, and blue into luminance was
defined by the National Television Standard Committee
(NTSC) when the US color television format was
standardized. These weightings are based on the human
eye's sensitivity to different wavelengths of visible
light and are based on extensive research. To set up
OpenGL to convert RGB to luminance according to the
NTSC standard, you would change OpenGL's default pixel
transfer state like this:

glPixelTransferf(GL_RED_SCALE, 0.299);
glPixelTransferf(GL_GREEN_SCALE, 0.587);
glPixelTransferf(GL_BLUE_SCALE, 0.114); 

If you are reading back a luminance version of an RGB
image that is intended for human viewing, you probably
will want to use the NTSC scale factors.
