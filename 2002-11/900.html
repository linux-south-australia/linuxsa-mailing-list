Funny how nobody mentions various factors that contribute to this.

Cert don't list all advisories. Linux/BSD source code is available.
Linux is now popular enough that many, many talented people are trying
to break it, and most the recent holes have been really quite obscure
and have been found through close scrutiny of the source, where as with
windows there is no available source and I do recall last year/early
this year most buffer overflow vulnerabilities I read about were found
by people using automated testing software that just threw large strings
at the front end of programs. Now these obvious bugs have been found,
it'll take longer to find the obscure holes, which of course is not to
say they arn't there. If windows source was available, how many more
security holes would be discovered in a very short amount of time? And
of course security through obscurity is not what you want. Linux is in
the process of getting a very thorough testing, and I'm convinced will
have far fewer holes than windows but the time it starts slowing down.
Its a process that needs to be done, and I'm glad to see it happening.
Its just doing it in the public eye gives those who want to an easy way
to take cheap shots at linux's security get to come up with articles
like this one.
