&gt; I tried the SuSE 8.1 network installation this morning
&gt; with no success. I installed the ethernet driver,
&gt; setup my ethernet connection, obtained the IP of the
&gt; mirror/ftp, obtained the directory path, etc. I am
&gt; assuming it is perhaps a 'firewall' related issue. (?)
&gt;
I can't see why what you have described would be a firewall problem....
 
&gt; Following that I grabbed the whole 3.7Gb of SuSE 8.1
&gt; files hoping that I may be able to do an installation
&gt; from my NT partition. This is one of the SuSE
&gt; installation options. Response was "Could not mount
&gt; drive".
&gt;
Is your NT partition NTFS?  This certainly used to create problems for 
linux actually reading anything off the drive...
 
&gt; Are there any other methods to install the operating
&gt; system?
&gt;
I'm not too accustomed to SUSE, but more than likely there are a number of 
ways to install....
 
&gt; Trying to pull out the correct 700Mb onto one CD is
&gt; unlikely to be successsful.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess with a switch/hub/router (?), I could do a
&gt; network install using a second computer at home,
&gt; however I do not have one. Can I connect two computers
&gt; directly without a switch/hub/router? Just say using
&gt; an RJ45 directly between the two computers? Then I can
&gt; transfer the 3.7Gb to the other computer and install
&gt; from there.
&gt;
Yep, using a crossover cable would do it fine.  If you can make these 
yourself, do a google search to get the wiring... otherwise, you could 
probably buy one fairly cheaply...
 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Simon.
&gt; 
&gt; PS - Is there a logical reason as to why SuSE do not
&gt; just provide ISOs?
&gt; 
Hm, I thought they did.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I have some ISOs on my 
drive here just waiting for me to use them when I get time (some of the 
guys at work use SUSE instead of Red Hat and I'd like to be a little more 
familiar with it).

Have fun!
