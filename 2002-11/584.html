That's because you haven't thought about it. People have different
needs to each other. If you were someone else, you might need (want)
broadband, but also want (need) not to pay the $400 odd setup cost
(connection + modem). You may also be confident that you'll be needing
this connection for 18 months or more. So, you make a choice from
the compromises that are available, and in this situation, you'd
choose a 18 month contract with no setup fee.  Of course, if all else
was equal, you'd go without the contract, but the cost of not having a
contract is paying upfront for setup, line activation and a modem,
which is not an insignificant sum of money.

If you were someone else, and you had $400 odd lying around, and
thought the market was volatile enough for you to want to be able to
jump providers whenever you want (and hence, you don't want an 18
month commitment to a single ISP), then sure, you'd choose to pay the
upfront cost and have the freedom. Of course, if all else was equal,
you'd go without the upfront cost, but that's what it costs to have no
contract.

It's all a matter of what compromises you personally want to make.
Adam offer plans with or without contracts, and that gives _you_ the
choice. Other ISPs offer whatever set of choices they think is going
to be best for them to offer, and you need to evaluate them and
choose. Of course, you need to think about it the ISP is likely to
change the contract half-way through, but by now, the ADSL market has
settled down enough for ISPs to know what to expect, so they aren't
working with an unknown.

Oh, and surely 18 months is not that long to stay with one technology?
Most people stay with most technologies longer than this. Think about
how long you use your motherboard, or your mobile phone plan, or some
other technology investment. Personally, I can't understand paying
$400-odd to use a technology for much less than 18 months (well, i
can, but my choice is that if I pay $400 for something, I want to get
a reasonable amount of use from it).

Cheers to a free market economy!
