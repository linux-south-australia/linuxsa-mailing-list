&gt;&gt;&gt; In the last year I've been forced on occasion to use a Microsoft-based
&gt;&gt;&gt; MUA.  In order to display a number of things, I had to use it in full-
&gt;&gt;&gt; screen mode.  That meant, however, that the displayed lines were about
&gt;&gt;&gt; 200 characters long, and there was nothing I could do about it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It sounds rather like what you had to read could not have been
&gt;&gt; presented in plain text at all.
&gt;
&gt; What gives you that idea?  It was perfectly normal, unembellished
&gt; text.  The issue is that these toys are so subdivided that you can't
&gt; display enough of the subject line, for example, without going to full
&gt; screen.  Full screen is also good for tables, but it's not good for
&gt; text.

I've used MS Mail, MS Outlook and MS Outlook Express and they all can
display a mail message in a window with no unreasonable adornment.
It sounds like you were using Outlook, and viewing the message in the
preview pane.

If the problem was merely an excessively long subject line there were
other alternatives, too, for example dragging the mouse through the
subject to scroll it, or cut-n-paste the subject to a different window.
I'm not saying these are nice things to have to do, but they are
quite reasonable for the pathalogical case you seem to be describing.
A standard 80 character window could have had the same sorts of problems
with that message, so you seem to have described a situation where HTML
email probably was, or would have been, an improvement.


&gt; On the contrary, it's broken.  It's uncomfortable to read text that
&gt; wide.  The same, indcidentally, applies to
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.">http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.</A>

While I'm impressed that you have a 2048 pixel wide screen, it was
your choice to make the display so wide and so a pretty feeble attempt
at arguing a deficiency in HTML email.  I'm surprised you resorted to
such a cheap trick.  It makes you look desperate and obviously nobody
is going to be fooled by it.


&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greg Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greg Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;David Said&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
I should imagine that quoted text could be quite clear if preceeded
by the usual attribution line and enclosed in a cell with a
different coloured background.  A reasonable GUI agent should permit
cut and paste, or intermingling new text.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
How many colours can you distinguish?  How many before you lose track
of the sequence?  How do you print them out?  Here I see a total of
five mail messages, indicated by the indentation.  What colours would
you assign to each of them, and why?
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Entirely reasonable questions.  I think the use of colour is one that's
not very important, and easily open to argument.  There are alternatives,
such as placing quoted text in a bordered cell.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
I'm not sure I understand the term.  Can you give an example (say, of
this message)?
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This is an example of how it could be done.  I didn't try to make
it pretty.  Arguably it would be more attractive as a series of dated
quotes rather than nested cells, however it does mimick what you do
with angle brackets, while being a simple envelope to an HTML message
(ie the message within the cell maintains all of the HTML attributes of
the original message.)
