Well Paul and I went to WiredUp 2002 on Saturday.

Glad I got in for free because I couldn't see much value for 10 bucks!

Sure there were some interesting booths, the music place had some really nifty stuff happening on Macs. The AUUG stand did a roaring trade and I did agree with their logic of finding things for DSL to do away from the stand so he wasn't frightening away the trade &lt;VBG&gt;

Tellurian seemed to have gathered good interest and other Linux folks were holding their own. 

AirNet had a good stand, well they were major sponsor &lt;G&gt; Perhaps Colvin might jump in and explain their network connection for the show. I did hear about it but forgot the details. Really interested in what connection they were running to give them phone access back to Mother Node. 

We even sat in on Dan Shearer's final presentation about Linux in the Business world. I ended up with a prize for guessing what PKI stood for - Penguin Knowledge Institute - OK it wasn't right but was judged a good answer anyway &lt;G&gt;

Perhaps the talk should have been sub-titled, "Why MS Suck!".  One heckler took Dan to task for using MS as a symbol of what is wrong in the business software world. Gee, I thought he was being restrained when discussing them in terms of licensing and responsiveness to security concerns &lt;sigh&gt;

Oh, I should add that I also got a $25 phone card and SIM from Telstra, and 3 pens from the SA Central site, so the day wasn't a loss for me. 

I talked to a lot of people, put some suggestions in some ears that may end up being of value, got rid of heaps of business cards for competitions, and found out a range of stuff that I wasn't aware of.

A good day, but worth $10? Not convinced.

Cheers,  Ian
