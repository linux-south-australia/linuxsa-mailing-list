Brian,


I'm not sure how get got that particular subject onto this particular list. But
here goes...

&gt; I think you answered your own question.  To join AUUG (and thereafter form a 
&gt; SIG) would cost each member of the SIG $110 pa.

I believe that we need to form a community based, volunteer organisation who is
supported by volunteers for the good of the whole. People who are willing to
part with $110, I believe, also expect to receive a return on their investment.
I seek an organisation that gives no return, but for the satisfaction of helping
the community and promoting all commhnity software as a whole.

&gt; I think we need some kind of 
&gt; associate membership relating to the SIG(s) only. eg becoming a member of the 
&gt; LinuxSA SIG would involve a membership fee of $25 pa, but provide all the 
&gt; advantages of AUUG backing.  Or maybe the SIG could become the AUUG member?

But community software is so much more than "Linux" or "FreeBSD" or Unix
variants. Closely aligned with open source software, it is something that I
think empowers people to become part of the IT community; with the rise in the
use of IT those not part of that community are becoming illterate.

And it can empower people on any platform, whether that be Mac OS X, Solaris 9
or Windows 2000 Professional.

&gt; We do need to work together and be - and be seen (heard?) to be - speaking 
&gt; with one voice which is big enough and loud enough to be influential.

One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them.
One Ring to being them all, and with its power bind them
 In the Land of Mordor where the darkness lies.

..many the perils there will be, but an alliance between all the community IT
groups may be enough to drive the power of the devil--whose only power is to
make you believe you have none--out once and for all.

And the most effective community groups that I've been a member of have low
(i.e. &lt; $10) membership fees, no business manager and a lot of grass-roots
enthusiasm.
