I'm not across the SA state education department's negotiations,
but most .edu contracts with software suppliers are on a head-count
basis.  This is simply because taking a census of software installed
on machines is a significant compliance expenditure.

What this does mean is that all software seems equally-priced
to users.  At least until the next negotiation period, when it's
too late to quickly change software choices.

So you end up with an odd economic system where all software
costs the same and you make the choice on feature sets.  Which
upsets people that advocate Linux on price rather than features.

Increasing in importance is the role ofthe "home use licence",
as more and more students have home access to PCs.  Microsoft
usually offer these to .edu under terms with amazingly high
compliance costs (eg: institution needs to check that software
has been removed from disks of people that withdraw from courses).
The free software alternatives don't carry these compliance
costs.

Personally, I don't think that anything short of administrative
fiat will prevent a slow drift of .edu machines from Windows
to Linux.  This is mainly attributable to package management:
Windows does this poorly and most Linux distrubutions do this
well.  That means that a school of Linux computers is has
way lower running costs than a school of Windows computers.

There's a argument for Microsoft software in terms of "what
is used in the real world".  But this coming back to bite
MS.  For example, Woodville High's multimedia subjects use
Apache + PHP for exactly the reason that Apache + PHP is the
software used in the real world for building web sites.

Cheers,
Glen
