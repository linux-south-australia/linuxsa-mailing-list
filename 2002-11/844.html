&gt;  &gt; Hmm, I keep on flirting with them, but I walways come back to the One
&gt;  &gt; True IDE: Emacs.
&gt; As IDEs for java go it is reasonably impressive (written in java), they
&gt; have written their own graphics framework that uses the client widgets
&gt; where possible - so it is pretty responsive (at least on the PIII 600
&gt; with 256Mb RAM I am using). I am just checking it out myself. Better
&gt; still, although backed by a consortium of IBM/Borland among others, it's
&gt; Open Source (under the Common Public License V1.0) - woohoo :)

Actually Eclipse is pretty impressive.  It uses non-portable Java for the GUI 
(ie JNI calls) so it is all Java, but optimised for the platform (currently 
includes Win98/ME/2000/XP, Linux [RH,SuSE], Solaris 8, QNX, AIX, HP-UX).  
Choice of JDK, a pluggable open-source architecture, support from every 
toolmaker except Sun and Microsoft.  What more could you want?

What _IS_ very interesting is that Eclipse forms the basis of Web Sphere 
Application Developer (IBM's premier web application development environment) - 
they just take drops of the Eclipse code, do some value-add and support that.  
Once you couple that with IBM's premier web server (Websphere) being based on 
Apache, you see how IBM is very much in the OSS camp nowadays.  Good to see.
