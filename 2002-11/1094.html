&gt; &gt; And while we're on the topic, what's with the power connectors on
&gt; &gt; UPS's?  They all seem to have the male computer power connectors
&gt; &gt; (don't know the real name for that style of three-prong), which
&gt; &gt; means you can't plug just any old device into them, you have to have
&gt; &gt; one that takes the right type of cable. Why don't they just have the
&gt; &gt; normal Australian-style connectors?
&gt; 
&gt; That would mean that they would have to manafacture a differnt UPS for
&gt; each country! The plugs are a world standard, where as outlets are
&gt; not! In the current situation all they need to do is change the power
&gt; cord they supply.
&gt;

Unless you use the Thai type outlets... accepts US,UK, German,
Malaysian, Singaporean... oh opps.. You still had to bend the pins to
get a aussie plug to fit after ripping out the earth pin. Thailand,Laos,
vietnam (to name a few) have a floating power grid. You do not connect
to an mains earth. Email me off list if you wish to know why.
 
&gt; &gt; Can you get adapters, so I can
&gt; &gt; plug (say) a Modem PSU into it?
&gt; 
&gt; Buy a power board.
&gt; Cut of plug.
&gt; Go to Jaycar, buy plug thingo.
&gt; Put plug thingo on power board.
&gt; Instant adapter with many outputs!
&gt; 
Not enough Geek point for that one...
Buy a power board.
Cut off plug.
Switch on soldering iron to heat up
Remove cover from UPS
Drill hole in UPS cover...
Hard wire power board to UPS and solder joints properly.. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there any reason why you shouldn't?
&gt; 
&gt; Nup ! We do it so that if the power goes down we can still remotely
&gt; get to the machine :)
&gt; 
None at all, the power outlets are connected in parallel to the same
point in the UPS anyway.
