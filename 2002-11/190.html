&gt; terrible shame - I had my hopes up for a moment

Hi Ian,

You misread me.

This is exactly the sort of "riding the coat tails" PR that
happens to a successful technology.

My objection to the PR was that it implies that NOIE are
responsible for promoting or guiding the adoption of Linux
in .gov.au.  Whereas in actuality there has been no central
guidance (and thus credit), but a ongoing series of
case-by-case deployments.

NOIE are doing a Good Thing by arranging the seminar.  It's
much easier to make the argument for your case for deploying
Linux when your Head of Department has heard of the technology,
has seen a few slides and glossies, [1] and is generally comfortable
that her department's IT risk isn't significantly different
to that of other departments.

Best wishes,
Glen

   [1] If you are going consider the following Evil
       Experiment.  Count the number of presentations
       with computer slides.  Then count the number of
       these done in Microsoft PowerPoint.   &lt;hehehe&gt;

       As a OpenOffice user let me tell you that no web
       site where my conference presentations have been
       hosted already had the Star/OpenOffice MIME types
       configured.
