&gt;&gt; See "The Modern Parents" in the appropriate issue of Viz. (Does Viz

&gt;Never heard of it.. so yeah, if you can PDF it or something..

I can't generate PDF files; it's a line-art strip cartoon, so I can do
a gif or jpeg of a 1 bit per pixel image, whichever ends up smaller.
Biggest problem is going to be finding the appropriate issue. I'll see
what I can do.

&gt;&gt; I don't know. I couldn't make it to the zone of totality (because the
&gt;&gt; f*****g railway company wouldn't sell me a ticket) so I only saw a
&gt;&gt; partial eclipse.
&gt;
&gt;Eh? When was this? What was the deal with the tickets? Was this related?

The UK railway system is in a government-created mess, full of chaos
and confusion, with loads of different companies running the trains.
The company that runs the trains in the region of totality had laid on
extra services for eclipse watchers. The company running my local
station didn't know this and refused to sell me a ticket on the
grounds that I wouldn't be able to get a seat, though this doesn't
seem to stop them selling tickets to people wanting to travel on their
rush-hour services to London, where you can never get a seat. So I
missed totality, and also missed the chance to bash a duff along the
Dawlish sea wall.
