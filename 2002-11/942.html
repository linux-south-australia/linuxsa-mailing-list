What: Red Hat 8.0 Personal Edition
Where: Kim's Newsagent, O'Connell Street, North Adelaide
How Much: $3x dollars
Rating: 3.5 out of 5 penguins; well worth the effort

I chose to backup my existing linux partition (RH7.1) and make a fresh
install.  I normally "upgrade" that way because my system rarely stays
stock standard for long: When I have a problem I load and compile the
source from the, well, the source, and by the time a new distribution
comes out it's worth trying to go back to standard, at least as much as
possible.

I did have trouble with the install: While loading from the first CD the
installer grumbled about zlib, something about it not being an RPM, or
not having transferred successfully.  It offered me the chance to retry,
but when then promptly crashed after informing me there was no
/mnt/source/.discinfo.  This occurred twice in succession so on the
third time I flipped to the shell on virtual console 2, re-mounted the
CD in /mnt/source, deleted the zlib that it complained about and
recopied the rpm from the CD.  When I clicked the retry button it
ejected the CD and asked me to re-insert it, which I did, and it went on
it's merry way.  The same problem recurred with two other files, which I
solved the same way.

I have reason to suspect the problem was with my CD drive, and not with
the media.  Certainly my drive is flakey when writing, and indeed only
about half the disks that I write on it can be reliably read on other
drives.  The files that it complained about were the same size and date
as the ones on the CD, but did have different content.  I haven't
checked to see how they differ; it was probably my CD drive playing up.

My sound system, based on VIA's 8233 south bridge, didn't work.  The
chip was detected okay, and the via82cxxx_audio module was configured,
however it fails to load.  Looking through the documentation I note that
that module, which was originally for the via 82c686 south bridge, was
patched to recognise the 8233 chip; however looking at the source I see
no indication of that.  The only PCI ID it recognises is for the
82c686.  I had the same problem with RH7.1, and for that I used the ALSA
driver, which did then and still does work fine.

I rather like the new Gnome and the new KDE.  Setting up preferences is
easy, including volume controls, desktop themes and so on.  There's a
"preferences" item in the KDE menus, and a "preferences" folder in the
Gnome "Start here" folder.

I'm currently trying Evolution, and it seems like it might be worth
switching to.  I have a suspicion that the nice "plain text wrapping"
that it's doing will translate to long paragraphs, but what the heck,
we've just discussed how plain text is a WISIWYS media so if that
happens it must be your imagination. :-)  Evolution supports multiple
IMAP servers, and permits me to pick my identity when I send each
email.  I think it will suit my needs, although I'm still getting used
to its way of doing things.  (I probably will always prefer Pine's Fcc
approach to saving copies of outgoing mail.)  If you think Outlook is a
good thing, and there are some quite sane people who do, then Evolution
is well worth a look at.

I have to say that I've never been terribly thrilled by the cavalier way
the linux community treats documentation, and RH8 seems to continue in
that vein.  There's too much of a black-box, "don't you worry you don't
have to know about that" mentality becoming apparent, which I think is
Microsoft's major weakness and I lament that we may follow them down the
same bad path.  The new, easy to use, point and click control panels
are, in this way, a double edged sword.  If you actually don't need or
want to know, you can just click and and it's done.  However if the
control panel doesn't let you set something the way you want it can be
difficult to discover exactly where the config files are kept.  Case in
point: I needed to add ALSA to the services settings, and I had to work
backwards from the source for redhat-config-services to find out how to
make it fit in with all the new bells and whistles.  Honestly I'd prefer
people didn't "innovate" in ways that break prior knowledge, but geeks
will be geeks and so I just have to put up with it.  I suppose it's a
small cost for what seems to be a fine system.
