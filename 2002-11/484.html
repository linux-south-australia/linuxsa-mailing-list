Hi.

For one, I'd like to point out that while a nicely formatted html email
might look pretty, it will steal processor cycles opening windows,
rendering fonts and graphics. A badly formatted one looks like cr*p and
still steals the cycles.

If you are like me, and I get a fair amount of emails in a day, all I want
to do is read the content and react where required in the minimum of time.
HTML mail is extremely wasteful of my time - it renders slow compared to
text (even of a fast box), it often requires me to scroll the window
because of the font or paragraph width chosen.

So, my preference is for plain text based on productivity, not resistance
to change or any other emotive label. If html mail was quicker, clearer
and used less resources, I'd be singing it's praises and advocating it.

I've tried many times to adopt a gui as my primary mua, (and I do use
them), but I always land up using a cli as my primary mail app on the
basis of speed.

I think you'll find many people on this list of the same opinion. We're
not the types that tinker at infinitum with a word processing document
changing the fonts and wordspacing etc until it's time to go home.

Actually, one of the maxims that the DTP types have taught me is that when
formatting text, the eye reads the text better if it can scan 10-15 words
per line. (it's something to do with the eye/brain interfacing, but it
just works better) Funny how that 80 column display conforms roughly to
that maxim...

Thats my last input into this (too long running) thread.

:)

Michael
