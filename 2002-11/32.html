&gt;&gt;&gt;If we got a .org.au or similar domain (I think they are still free) could 
&gt;&gt;&gt;we get it pointed to our AirNet site? (In the service rules AirNet wont 
&gt;&gt;&gt;host a domain name for a dial-up membership, only for commercial accounts).
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have used dyndns.org and although I don't have my own domain, I think
&gt;they can do this (although that service isn't free, see their website
&gt;for details). These guys support and use open source software too.

Same horse, different color. There's lots in the race. Though some charge more than others!  ;-)

&gt;&gt;The hosting company provides a small program you compile and then include in
&gt;&gt;your boot scripts or run manually. It only needs to be run once and perhaps
&gt;&gt;cronned if you're paranoid. This updates your IP on the hosting DNS servers 
&gt;&gt;every five minutes so if your connection drops out (I get kicked every 6 
&gt;&gt;hrs) it gets renewed automatically.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would think it more efficient to put this in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/ that
&gt;way it only gets run when you get a new IP.
&gt;  
&gt;

The point of the program no-ip.com give you is that it's a background daemon that only renews the IP when necessary.
It doesn't need restarting every time you dial-in. You run it once.... then forget about it.
You only need to cron it if you're paranoid.
I've only had it stop on me once in nearly two weeks of uptime after dozens of dialins.
I've used other dynamic ip hosts that provided a perl script to be run at each dial-in. 
Depends who you host with, and whether it's for commercial sites as to the costs.
