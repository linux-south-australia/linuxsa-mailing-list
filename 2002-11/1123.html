Hi Richard (and others),
    I use a 650VA OptiPlus UPS, from memory it cost about
$300-350. These UPS's come in various sizes and are quite
good value for money. I am at present using mine on the
entire network for short term protection when I am there,
and server and modem only when I am not there. From the
limited tests I have done, and the genuine events (I live in
Queensland now and they have pretty crappy power supply,
especially when there are thunder storms about), I get about
40 mins protection under full load (entire network of 3
machines and monitors plus printer and scanner and sound
system) and about 3 hours for just server and modem (PI
100). Basically I turn off all but essentials when the power
has been off for more than 5 mins, and keep working until I
get the "10 minute warning" from the software.

    Part of the reason I chose this UPS was that I did a
google for UPS and Linux, and came up with a list of
compatible UPS. This one has support for RH (GUI only
unfortunately) but the RPMs are available from their site
with full instructions. The GUI is quite comprehensive and
the monitoring and diagnostics are also good (I even
diagnosed a line problem that I passed onto the electric
company nobody knew about).

    As far as hookups are concerned, I just got an IEC power
cable from Dick Smith Electronics and vandalised it to get a
power board to link up with it (They do have one available,
but it costs a fortune, just get a friend to do it if you
don't feel confident). I also run my switch and modem cables
through it. The boxes and monitors I hook up directly to the
UPS. The whole lot takes about 15 mins to unpack and hook up
and install the software, and then about 5 hours to charge
the battery the first time, after that it apparently takes 2
hours to charge when fully flat. The battery is a sealed
lead acid type and is fully replaceable. If I was in
Adelaide I would chat to Pacific Batteries to see about
replacing the existing battery with a bigger one that is
suitable for operations to extend your usage time. The
dealer I got the UPS said that he would not say anything
about it officially as a store representative, but that he
did just that at home. It voids the warrantee, but gives
much better time under load and doesn't affect the system
except maybe the software won't be able to recalculate. I
think I will wait however until I kill this battery before I
try that.

    Overall I am very happy with the system and would
recommend it to anyone looking for a UPS. Hope this has
helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
