Ian,

not a bad site, simple to navigate and informative.
me being particularily picky about table layout/alignment, you have a 
few 'inconsistencies' in the layouts, best shown by going to the members 
page, then the scenes page, then the training page and looking at the 
alignment of the main text table, and the nav banner.

also some of the page titles are set and others are not (most are set to 
'Title page of the SNNN web site')

the community page has differing fonts too, some text set, others not.

and on the home page, the city of Salisbury logo and the photo of their 
building doesnt display in the correct position in netscape 7, 
depending, of course, how much you wish to accomodate other browsers 
than Internet explorer. I suspect the use of the 'float' style.

all little things though..

&gt;  Ok, you have all heard about the community project I spend a
&gt;  lot of time on and many of you helped me a few months back
&gt;  when I was setting up the training program for the Youth IT
&gt;  Project.
&gt; 
&gt;  Well, our next site is just about to be launched this coming
&gt;  Wednesday (ARRRGH too soon!) Most of the pages are in place
&gt;  and content is almost done as far as we are going to do it
&gt;  in this phase.
&gt; 
&gt;  Could I ask a little time from you to please drop past the
&gt;  site and look across what we have done and offer any
&gt;  suggestions or criticisms as you wish. There is still a few
&gt;  nights left before the launch &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;

&gt;  Any help/comment/criticism is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt;  Cheers,  Ian
