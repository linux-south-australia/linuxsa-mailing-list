I came across a lengthy essay more or less by accident.  It's at:
<A HREF="http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/beginning_CLI.html">http://kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu/~kamikaze/documents/beginning_CLI.html</A>

I'm not sure that it says anything much that is new, but there is a 
wonderful analogy early on that likens Operating Systems to four auto 
dealers at a crossroads.  Apple is selling sleek but eccentric Euro 
styled sedans from a grungy lot with weathered "Going Out of Business" 
signs.  Microsoft is selling ponderous, badly engineered and shoddily 
constructed Station wagons from a huge lot.  Be is selling wonderful, 
cheap little batmobiles clones that no one is buying.  And Linux has a 
lot full of tents, yurts, RVs and whatever where hippies are somehow 
stamping out high tech tanks that are clearly superior to Microsoft's 
station wagons in almost all respects.  And they are giving them away.

The following scene ensues:

Hacker with bullhorn: "Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks! 
It is invulnerable, and can drive across rocks and swamps at ninety 
miles an hour while getting a hundred miles to the gallon!" 

Prospective station wagon buyer: "I know what you say is 
true...but...er...I don't know how to maintain a tank!" 

Bullhorn: "You don't know how to maintain a station wagon either!" 

Buyer: "But this dealership has mechanics on staff. If something goes 
wrong with my station wagon, I can take a day off work, bring it here, 
and pay them to work on it while I sit in the waiting room for hours, 
listening to elevator music." 

Bullhorn: "But if you accept one of our free tanks we will send 
volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you sleep!" 

Buyer: "Stay away from my house, you freak!" 

Bullhorn: "But..." 

Buyer: "Can't you see that everyone is buying station wagons?" 

===

The article is very lengthy, but it is well written and includes some 
stuff I rarely see elsewhere.  Like a description of the frustration in 
trying to find support information at www.microsoft.com (e.g. bad 
hyperlinks, search engine dies, etc).  There are times when I think 
from the lack of general outrage about the lousy quality of many web 
sites, vendor support, etc that I must be alone in  the continual 
problems I experience with that junk.
