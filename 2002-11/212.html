&gt; When you get a report showing that South Australia,
&gt; supposedly the IT 
&gt; Centre of Australia, has an internet takeup of less
&gt; than a third of the 
&gt; population, you don't wonder anymore about why few
&gt; turn up to geeky 
&gt; events like WiredUp. 

I think most people down with computers percieve Wired
Up as lanes of marketing fliers, a slicker, moneyed-up
equivalent of those broken business model booths in
the Royal show pavillions.

I went last year because I was willing to deal with
the marketing if the technology demonstrations were
sufficiently cool. They were not, nor were they new as
advertised.

I didn't go this year, nor did the idea sum up any
enthusiasm in my friends. Those guys are interested in
3d modelling, programming and games and had nowhere to
be on that day. We spent our $10 on 10 packs of
arnotts shapes that were on special at Coles. They
provided adequate sustenence for the Mario Sunshine
marathon. We have no regrets about not seeing Wired Up.
