When you get a report showing that South Australia, supposedly the IT 
Centre of Australia, has an internet takeup of less than a third of the 
population, you don't wonder anymore about why few turn up to geeky 
events like WiredUp. 

You could say that most of the people stayed away in droves. How to get 
a good profile for such an event?
In some states you could hook in with Education Departments and flog it 
off as good for schools. Northern Territory is a good example of a 
school system embracing the OpenSource world.

With our Ed Dept in bed with M$ that rules out any sort of support from 
that avenue.

Maybe we could look at what is going on at Tech Park and other hotspots 
of the IT Industry. They might be doing something that could 'adopt' an 
OpenSource Expo.

Cheers,  Ian
