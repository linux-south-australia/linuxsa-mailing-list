&gt; I'm looking at organising a Linux conference here in SA in the centre of 
&gt; Adelaide, in January 2004, and I'm looking for venue cost and availability.

Hi Michael,

I took ten ten minutes out of my day and made a few calls.

I've no idea how many people will go to lca 2004 so I took
a stab at 400 -- this effects costs a lot, bigger conferences
being more expensive per person.

A good budgetary figure is $750 per day per facility.  LCA2003
has three streams and goes for five days, so that's about
$12,000.

Now the way to proceed from here *isn't* to ring Jim Denny on
8303 6105 and book Union Hall at Adelaide Uni.  Ring the
organisers of LCA2003, get an idea of eventual numbers,
and then ring Jim.  Don't agree to anything, just get
pricing, availability and T&Cs (get him to fax these to you).
You'll need the T&Cs to answer questions later (does the
Hall come with audio, if so do you need to pay an audio
tech if you use it).

Then start to build a team of interested people.

With a good team you'll have someone from inside Adelaide Uni
working for you.  That will make things a lot simpler. It may
not on the surface cost less, but items like data projectors
will then be located by Means Nefarious rather than cost
upwards of $500 per day.  And any little emergency items like
powerboards can be found.

I suggest what you do to build that team is to put out a call for
a preliminary organising committee.  Noting that you'll want to
influence the membership a tad (the people you want most have
been burnt by conference organisation before and will need to be
personally begged/bribed/threatened).

You'll need to buddy up to the LCA2003 organisers and make
sure that there's no one unofficially lined up for 2004.  A
2005 date would be better in many ways -- Jan 2004 is very
close, most conferences look at 18 months as barely enough
time.

Then you should schmooze LinuxSA, AUUG-SA, ACS-SA and groups
you don't even know about yet.  Things like accomodation,
net access, etc will fall into your lap.  But I've found that
building a core of effective volunteer organisers is by
far the hardest part of organising a grassroots conference
and you need to cast far and wide for these.

Best wishes,
Glen
