Mick,

&gt; I also have attended a couple of LinuxSA meetings and think this is a
&gt; very valid point.  While the user group meeting are a place and time
&gt; for advanced users to get together and discuss ideas way over
&gt; begineers heads, and I don't want to lower everyone down to our
&gt; levels, some effort should be make to include everyone.

It's also the advanced users who happen to be the workers behind
InstallFests, bother about making presentation FOR NO CHARGE and do
other stuff.

We do it because we *want* to do it. You have to realise we're not paid
directly by the non-existent entity LinuxSA. All presenters are
volunteers, just as Geoffrey who is the main organiser, is a volunteer.
It's really as simple as that...

&gt; How about implementing some kind of Protege / apprentice systems where
&gt; a knowedgable user takes a newbie under thier wing to be a point of
&gt; contact, person to introduce us into the local linux circle of geeks
&gt; =)

That is a good idea...talk more about it.
