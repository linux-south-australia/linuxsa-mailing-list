&gt;&gt; I'm currently trying Evolution, and it seems like it might be worth
&gt;&gt; switching to.

I'm not sure how many have tried the current release (1.2), but it's 
a huge jump from the 1.0 versions.  I installed it from Mandrake's
cooker a week or so ago (go urpmi :), and apart from having a few hassles
with 
migrating my 1.0.x contacts across, the upgrade was quite smooth, 
although I did have to import my messages back in rather than just
copy the evolution folder across as with prior upgrades.

Positives:
- Nice new configuration dialog, pretty much everything's in one place now,
and logically arranged unlike before :)
- Faster, well it seemed faster on my poor old Celery 300 (still waiting 
for a replacement CPU for my Athlon so had to revert to the spare :(
- More stable, haven't managed to kill it yet.  With 1.0.x I had to use
"oaf-slay" on occasions when it refused to start properly after crashing.

Negatives:
Took me a while to work out how to import my contacts from v1.0.x,
turns out you select all the contacts and save them to a vcard file.
Personally I'd like to see the import/export wizard (which is excellent
I might add....) include contacts as well.
