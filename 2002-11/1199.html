&gt;So which bit explains why you don't have an earth? You only seemed to
&gt;cover the differences in the systems. Or did I miss something?
&gt;
&gt;FWIW, My old place in adelaide had all the neutral lines switched - I
&gt;found this out the hard way (lights off, re-attach to roof - shock!). It
&gt;also had live 240v connected to the bottom of the fan/light in my
&gt;bedroom. I found this out when I needed a high place to wedge an FM
&gt;aerial, and tried to clamp it under part of the light fitting (shouldn't
&gt;be live, right?). Bang! Blew sparks and chunks of the aerial across the
&gt;room! Needless to say, I don't think that house was wired by a licensed
&gt;electrician :(
&gt;

If the toaster is switched only on the neutral, and develops an earth
fault, and your "earth" is connected to neutral instead of to an earth
stake, you've got a direct path from live to neutral, and hundreds of
amps will flow. To make matters worse, it sounds like the sort of area
where the fuse is likely to actually be a nail. So you get great big
bangs.

The other thing that can happen is that people nick accessible parts
of the earth cabling to sell for scrap. So if anything develops an
earth fault, things with metal cases all over the building suddenly go
live. This isn't limited to Laos. I've heard of it happening to
English tower blocks.
