&gt; &gt;  A Proudfoot Consulting productivity study found that Australia's

&gt; &gt; IT-related productivity losses. The survey of 1357 companies in seven
&gt; &gt; countries including Australia, Austria, France, Germany, South Africa,
&gt; &gt; the UK and the US found on average only 59 per cent of work time is
&gt; &gt; productive.

&gt; This is something that Thomas Landauer (an ex Bell Labs researcher)
&gt; has been espousing since the mid 90's.  In his book "The Trouble
&gt; With Computers", he actually uses statistical methods (horrors!)
&gt; to backup up his assertion that computers haven't been the great
&gt; labour saving devices that the glossy brochures would have you
&gt; believe.

Computers are tools, like baseball bats, electricity, firearms, cars, gas 
stoves, ....  you name it!   All are useful in their context, and their 
degree of usefulness or danger depends entirely on two things.
1.  The level of knowledge of the tool held by its user, and
2.  The use to which the user places the tool.

We have probably all seen the absurd emphasis on "glamour" in the preparation 
and preparation of letters which could just as easily be handwritten.  (The 
number of examples of such anti-productive activities in the office and 
hospitality environments is legion.)

Electricity is dreadfully dangerous in the hands of the ignorant.

OTOH, how would it be possible to unravel DNA sequences by hand?  How would it 
be possible to automate car and furniture building without computing?  In 
these cases, computers undeniably increase productivity many-fold.

What influences the stats mught be the balance in the particular economy.  
High manufacturing industry, low service industries = good effects of 
computers.
Low manufacturing industry, high service industries = bad effects of 
computers.
The latter IS changeable by education - though don't hold your breath!.
