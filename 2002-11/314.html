&gt;I would use Linux (in any case) because:
&gt;  
&gt;
Wasn't the question office of a free version? You don't have to defend 
Linux this time ;)

A generic Norm might answer your points in the following way, so while I 
agree with everything you say, I'm in too deep, what I want and what 
Norm wants, my experience and Norm's experience of computer use are 
worlds apart, believe it or not most people don't get excited when an 
new idea in interface design comes out. People even think transparency 
is a gimmick!

&gt;1/ I "own" the tools I am using
&gt;
As long as I can use it I don't care if I "own" it.

&gt;2/ Huge range of applications
&gt;  
&gt;
Well we are just talking about one suit.

&gt;3/ Better performance
&gt;
MS goes okay.

&gt;4/ Choice of mix and match file systems
&gt;  
&gt;
What's a file system?

&gt;5/ Better application (and OS) install processes
&gt;
Personal preference...

&gt;6/ Way better security
&gt;  
&gt;
I lock the door every day, and I have one of those chain things for when 
I am at home...

&gt;7/ Better networking
&gt;
I own one computer at home...

&gt;8/ It's an important alternative to the "corporate norm"
&gt;(so it adds some bio-diversity to the computing world)
&gt;  
&gt;
I feel safe in the corporate norm. It means all my norm friends will be 
able to use the files I create.

&gt;9/ Updates to everything are really easy
&gt;(well on Debian at least)
&gt;
What's an update?

&gt;10/ I can get under the hood
&gt;
I am scared of hoods. Leave it down please.

&gt;11/ I have the opportunity of contributing / putting back something to a
&gt;community.(so it is more human in approach) 
&gt;
Community?? Are you a hippie long hair or something?

&gt;12/ I can request (or
&gt;implement) features or even new applications. 
&gt;
MS has already more than I ever use...

&gt;13/ Stability !
&gt;
I hate that MS crashes all the time... Actually you could really hype 
this angle..

&gt;14/ I can jump onto the "train" at any level form absolute newbie 
&gt;through &lt;shudder&gt; "poweruser" to guru/ wizard.(and/ Who uses office
&gt;suites anyway :&gt;) 
&gt;
I do. And so do all of my norm friends...

&gt;15/ The choice of interfaces is stunning I can find or
&gt;configure (even make) something that suites me and the way _I_ work not
&gt;the way some MS / Marketing wanker thinks I should.(E17 to TTY/consol).
&gt;
Don't you mean the nice guys at microsoft? Windows looks okay... I like 
grey boxes.

&gt;16/ In the end it is a more creative environment and that is a "Good
&gt;Thing" for humans.
&gt;
You are trying to tell me that thinking is a good thing? Bah... pass me 
another coldie would you?
