&gt; OK, I have trimmed a lot of what david has said to get at the meat.

This is always proper. :-)


&gt; I think Foreshew was aiming it [the article] at both developers and users.

Richard is right that the opening paragraph does make it seem like it
was going to a warn to users as well as developers, however I still see
no actual warning to users in the article.  I suppose that sometimes
some of us in the unix community make spurious comments about Windows in
order to promote unix, so we shouldn't be surprised if, on occassions,
others level equally absurd criticisms on us.  It's important not to
lose sight of the important warning in the article.  The GPL probably
provides little or no protection to Australian developers.


Richard is correct that the article was deficient in the paragraph
relating to distributors, although I feel his first point is not
necessarily correct in Australia.

&gt; Propietary Software products have long disclaimed liability, so they 
&gt; are in the same camp as Open Source software.

Proprietary and GPL developers may be in the same camp in USA, but
in other parts of the world the GPL may only give the illusion of a
disclaimer.  I shall certainly heed Tippett's warning, and not release
any software under GPL, or indeed anybody else's licence, until I have
my lawyer's sign off on it.  Of course, since the GPL is not GPLed and
it explicitly denies me the right to make changes to it, I can't modify
it to make it work in Australia.  (I find that a fundamental hypocracy.)


The issue of distributors is somewhat interesting in civil proceedings.
When you purchase a product you form an explicit or implied contract
with the body that sold it to you.  If you buy from a distributor there
is no contract between you and the developer, except insofar as the
developer imposes a licence.  If you suffer loss from a failure of the
product you have no recourse against the developer; you must sue the
distributor.  (Should you succeed in an action against the distributor,
they would seek their losses from the developer, but under the terms of
whatever contract those two parties agreed.)  This situation was made
quite clear in the worldwide windows refund day.  All of the people who
stampeded Microsoft were given a Pepsi, which was nice, but that's all.
Having purchased nothing from Microsoft, they were entitled to a refund
of the same amount: none at all.


&gt; Further, a quote in the article that I have problems with is:
&gt; 
&gt;  '"From a copyright point of view, developers are most at risk because 
&gt;    they lose the ability to assert ownership. But from the customer's 
&gt;    point of view, the warranties, indemnities, the IP ownership and all 
&gt;    those sorts of things are important," she said. '

That's certainly a major point of criticism from many parties, but I still
think that asserting ownership is intended to mean, asserting all of the
controls of ownership (hereinafter described as "asserting ownership.")
I suppose a lawyer's mindset is one of, how can you protect yourself while
maximimisng your return, at least half of which makes no sense when you
GPL your product because you actually want to give away financial benefit.
Tippett is right: you do give away the ability to assert the normal
controls of ownership.  That's one of the points of GPL.

The risks to the developer are still of concern, so a lawyer's mindset
is not totally irrelevant.
