&gt;&gt;I use a free dyndns hoster for my mail server, like www.no-ip.org which 
&gt;&gt;redirects all my email to awol.no-ip.org and it costs nothing to use.  :)

&gt;Alex,
&gt;
&gt;this might be something our community group could use.
&gt;
&gt;At present we are hosted on AirNet but that means we end up with a long 
&gt;(not as long as some) URL - <A HREF="http://www.airnet.com.au/~snnn">http://www.airnet.com.au/~snnn</A> (feel free to 
&gt;check us out).
&gt;
&gt;We also can only have 1 email address per account unless we want to pay 
&gt;$$'s more per year.
&gt;
&gt;How does this free DNS thing work? What about the No-IP Enhanced service at 
&gt;US$12.95 once off for a DNS redirect?
&gt;
&gt;If we got a .org.au or similar domain (I think they are still free) could 
&gt;we get it pointed to our AirNet site? (In the service rules AirNet wont 
&gt;host a domain name for a dial-up membership, only for commercial accounts).
&gt;
&gt;Is there a way we could work with somebody locally to do all this rather 
&gt;than go out of our state, we are a pretty patriotic bunch after all &lt;G&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,  Ian
&gt;

You get what you pay for. A site like www.no-ip.com (I should've said .com 
not .org since you will be redirected there anyway) has several plans to 
suit your budget and needs. A basic plans has limitations but you can 
redirect one domain for free including MX records. There are other dyndns
hosting companies around though. Google is your friend.

For example to see my web server point your browser to 
<A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/">http://awol.no-ip.org/</A> and you can always email 
me at <A HREF="mailto:awol@awol.no-ip.org">awol@awol.no-ip.org</A> too. My irc bots both have their own mailing lists 
too. For example on #linuxsa on irc.freenode.net my wombat bot has a web page 
at <A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/~wombat">http://awol.no-ip.org/~wombat</A> where you can subscribe to his mailing list.

The hosting company provides a small program you compile and then include in
your boot scripts or run manually. It only needs to be run once and perhaps
cronned if you're paranoid. This updates your IP on the hosting DNS servers 
every five minutes so if your connection drops out (I get kicked every 6 hrs)
it gets renewed automatically.
This way you can host as many domains as are publically resolvable on the one
machine. I'm not entirely sure how you'd go about hosting other domains
on an internal LAN machine as I've never tried. Perhaps another list member 
could shed some light on this. It would require some clever firewall
manipulation no doubt. 

It all depends how elaborate you want/need to get. The beauty of redhat is the
mail app rpm's like mailman and squirrelmail come with everything all setup for 
you. So all you have to do is tweak a few configs to get webmail and mailing
lists all happening and get on with business.
I dont know how easy debian is to setup though. I shall have to give it a try
sometime.   :)

Hope this helps!

Alex
