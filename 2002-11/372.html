Hello Brian,

Thanks for your message.
Yes anything is possible, but the limiting factor is the amount of time I
can devote to converting files from one format to another.

These short messages are the result of new products being listed on our web
site, which is compiled in MS Frontpage html format. It is a simple matter
then to copy the information and paste into a html email message.
To convert it back to plain text doesn't fulfill our requirement of giving
people a picture and hyperlinks to do something with the information. Also
to take the html file to another format where we can convert it to a pdf
file adds a considerable amount of time to the whole process.

Your suggestion is a valid one that most people have Acrobat or similar
file readers, and we are looking at the next edition of the full newsletter
being in a pdf format (the original MS Publisher file format allows this
without adding further conversion steps in the middle)

I trust this answers your queries.

Regards

Graeme
