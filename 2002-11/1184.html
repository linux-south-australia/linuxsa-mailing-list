&gt; &gt; So which bit explains why you don't have an earth? You only 
&gt; seemed to
&gt; &gt; cover the differences in the systems. Or did I miss something?
&gt; 
&gt; Roughly.  The Neutral is earthed at the power station, on one side
&gt; of the generators' windings.  The other side of the generators'
&gt; windings is the Active.  Generators actually have three windings,
&gt; leading to one shared Neutral and three Actives, thus the phrase
&gt; "three phase power".
&gt; 
&gt; The potential of the earth varies by location -- depending
&gt; upon altitude, soil, wind, solar radiation, etc.  You get
&gt; differing potentials even within sites -- the section of Adelaide
&gt; Uni at North Terrace has a differing earth potential to the
&gt; section of Adelaide Uni by the river as the soil moisture
&gt; content and the heights are different.
&gt; 
&gt; [ This is the reason for a Neutral wire at all.  If we used
&gt;    a Active and a local Earth we wouldn't have a stable
&gt;    potential difference (called a "voltage") and designing
&gt;    electrical devices would become very tricky.  Some
&gt;    older power lines to farm have a local Neutral, these
&gt;    are notorious for frying attached computers.
&gt; ]
&gt; 
&gt; So if you touch the Neutral at the power station you should
&gt; not in theory be shocked, as there is no potential difference
&gt; between your hand and your feet.  (I wouldn't test this theory,
&gt; as an experimental error of 1% of 40,000 volts would still be
&gt; deadly).
&gt; 
&gt; If you touch the Neutral somewhere else then the potential
&gt; difference between the earth potential at the power station
&gt; and the earth potential at your feet will flow through
&gt; your body.  That Neutral might also be temporarily very
&gt; high above the local earth potential -- imagine power lines
&gt; on a mountain in storm clouds.

One further point. In Australia we have the MEN (Multiple
Earth Neutral) system. That is, at the fuse box all earths
and neutrals are connected to an earth stake. This ensures that
neutral is at local earth potential, ensuring the above situation
does not occur.
