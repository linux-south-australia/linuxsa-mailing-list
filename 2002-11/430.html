&gt;&gt; The interesting thing about his comment is it ignores the "T" in HTML.
&gt;&gt; HTML is text.  It contains no images, music, or any media other than
&gt;&gt; text.
&gt; 
&gt; Then how come the majority of the HTML spam that I receive contains
&gt; embedded images?

I'm pretty sure I already addressed this question, however to save anyone
from having to read back, the truth is that the HTML doesn't contain the
images, rather the spam contains attachments and HTML tags to display it.

&gt;&gt; Aren't asterisks, slashes and underlines for expression all so last
&gt;&gt; millenium, particularly when HTML lets you emphasise in &lt;b&gt;*bold*&lt;/b&gt;?
&gt;
&gt; A majority of the English language is "last millenium" - should we be
&gt; dispensing with that too?

English does change with the times.  Considering we're using a technology
where, as was so recently pointed out, 18 months is a long time, why the
heck are we insisting on a format that's almost unchanged for twenty years?


&gt; I also noticed you use that quaint convention of sticking to less than
&gt; 80 characters for your column width.  Any reason for that?

Courtesy.  I do it because that's the current accepted format.  That
doesn't mean I can't or shouldn't present arguments supporting a change.


&gt; At the end of the day, it's also agreed that HTML as a markup language
&gt; is pretty poor; it confuses presentation with content, so using something
&gt; so "90's" would be a pretty poor decision too, wouldn't you agree?

No, I don't think that is agreed.  It makes no confusion about
presentation and content.  It specifically leaves most presentation issues
to the browser, and confines itself to describing the content.  It solves
many issues.  It's a suitably rich form of text without being excessive.

Really, the major problems some people gripe about are the inclusion
of graphic attachments, and weaknesses with some widely used rendering
agents.  I don't see these as problems.  Rather than flame people for
using HTML, thus denying ourselves the benefits, why not flame them for
misusing it?
