&gt; An operating system is a program, in my mind, so to say "Linux is an 
&gt; operating system, not a program..." is just wrong.

When IBM investigated unbundling software from hardware they had
difficulty deciding where to place the operating systems.  They eventually
decided that the OSes were more like the hardware, especially insofar
as some models, lacking specific hardware instructions, made up for that
lack by emulation in the OS.

The point is that while the OS obvioulsy is a program, it's in a very
special category.

Looking at Foreshew's article in The Australian, I can see how perhaps
what was written make sense in "lay terms".  From a copyright point of
view developers do not lose the ability to assert ownership, but they do
lose the ability to assert control, which is arguably the most important
aspect of ownership to a software manufacturing business.  Sue Tippett
went on to highlight a concern that employees (of a software developer)
could, for example, use a piece of open-source software that they download
from somewhere, and incorporate it into a program for their employer
without understanding the implications.  This is a very real threat.
Let me give you an example that's close to home.  I'm working on a large
COBOL system, making it run on linix.  Part of my task is to locate a
suitable compiler, one that is free of run-time royalties.  Two compilers
(Tiny Cobol and Open Cobol) were suggested to me (by my client.)
Both of them use the GNU readline library, which is GPLed not LPGLed.
My client does not want to release his software as open-source, and
while I noticed the "threat," others in a similar situation might not,
and so might have put my client in breach of the GPL.

Tippetts whole trhust was about developers exposing themselves to legal
threats.  It is true that the GPL does attempt to disclaim liability
from all damages, but you must understand that the GPL was written in,
by and for America.  Laws differ in different countries, which is why
Microsoft have separate Australian, English, and German licences from
their US licence.  Where is the Australian GPL?  If a clause in the
GPL is illegal under Australian law it might invalidate the complete
contract in Australia.  Certain liabilities cannot be disclaimed in
Australia, and any attempt to do so is illegal.  The GPL has not been
tested in Australian and so it's unknown what protection, if any, it
offers Australian developers.

Tippett was not criticising the GPL because customers lose warranties or
indemnities.  Such clauses are standard in all modern software licences.
She is warning developers that they might not have the protection that
they think they do.

Tippett's article is reasonable.  While it is not technically accurate
in all respects, as an article for the general public it does express
the legal situation well.

By contrast, Sam Varghese's rebuttal in the Sydney Morning Herals contains
serious inaccuracies.  Tippett never said "don't use sofwtware that is
released under GPL," as Varghese claims.  In fact, Tippett went so fare
as to state some benefits of GPL relating to cost, development time and
time to fix bugs.  Even worse, Verghese said that Tippett warned users
against GPLed software because of legal threats, but actually the warning
was to the developer, not to the user.

Varghese's observes that, "According to Moore's Law, 18 months is
considered a lifetime in the computer industry."  He misses the obvious
point which is that Tippett was discussing law, not computers.  Eighteen
months is not so long in law.

Tippett was criticised for saying that the GPL has not been tested in law,
but her detractors fail to put the claim in the context of Foreshew's
opening paragraph, which makes it quite clear that the article discusses
Australian law.  While the licence might have been tested overseas,
these cases hold no precedent in Australia.

I suppose Verghese's response could be considered innaccurate and
shrill, but I prefer to put it down to a knee-jerk reaction.  Had he read
Foreshew's article more carefully he would have realised that, in fact,
she was not warning users to beware GPL, she was warning developers to
be careful.  Good advice.
