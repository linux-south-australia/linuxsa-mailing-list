Let's be a bit less naive.

We've got NOIE.  An Office that had most of its significant
functions removed from it in the last budget, an Office in
search of a function.

It's arranging a seminar.  That is, Heads of Departments,
presentations on Linux, tea and bikkies.  Geoffrey does
about that much organisation for a LinuxSA meeting.

What they are doing is milking the seminar for as much
publicity as possible and appearing to be the Office that
manages IT strategy in gov.au (NOIE doesn't have that
responsibility -- the Dep't of Finance snarfed that in the
1980s.  But DoF have made major stuff-ups such as GOSIP and,
most recently, Whole of Government Outsouring).

Also milking the PR is NOIE's Minister.  Bureau of Meteorology
isn't even in Alston's portfolio -- it's in Science, not
Communications.  So Alston and NOIE's contribution to BoM's
successful Linux deployment was what?  They didn't provide the
money; they didn't take the risk; they are taking the credit.

The comments by John Rimmer of NOIE aren't anything special.
Of course gov't departments will make

     software decisions on a case-by-case basis based on
     value for money, fit-for-purpose functionality and
     reliability.

I bet the gov't departments are a tad miffed at the implied
suggestion that they've been making software decisions on
any other grounds.

And of course those departments are coming to NOIE's seminar
to make presentations on their successful Linux deployments
and plans.  After all, the departments know free PR when they
see it.  Best of all even if you haven't done a thing you
can fill 10 minutes with slides on "Evaluation methodologies
for deployment of Linux in the Department of Adminstrative
Affairs".

The Australian has already run this story a number of times.
You've got to ask if they read their own newspaper or just
print incoming media releases.
