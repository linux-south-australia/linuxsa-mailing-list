James,


&gt; I didn't get a chance to reread what I wrote....

*hmmm*

&gt; I was under the impression that the participants in the text-vs-html 
&gt; debate agreed to use text on Linuxsa for the sake of courtesy.

Did they? Now that is news to me...

&gt; I found impressive the ease in which the agreement was made, dispite
&gt; the debate...

Excuse me, an interesting discussion occured between two of the long
standing members of the Unix community (at least I think measured by
their age and participation therein). These two members didn't agree
with each other.

I can see merit in marked up e-mail but I don't believe the average
user, or the average LinuxSA member [ and I don't consider the two
discussers I allude to above as the average LinuxSA member ] use HTML
e-mails effectively.
