&gt; Maybe then
&gt; people can have a play and decide which distro they would like to try
&gt; out first?

I think there are only two issues with running modern distros on old 
hardware.

1) Hardware support. Some distros may only provide kernels that support 
more modern process, buses, etc. This isn't a problem as (I assume) all 
moder distros allow you to build a boot disk with a custom built kernel, 
and install using that.

2) Lack of skinny mainstream desktop. GNOME1 was terribly bloated, you 
wouldn't want to run it on anything resembling a 486. GNOME2 is much 
better, but it's still be slow on old hardware. I don't know much about 
KDE, but I hear it's getting slower. ;)  So your options are plain old X 
and fvwm or similar. If this is okay, or if the old machine will be a 
server, this isn't a problem either.

So, I don't see why (assuming your willing to put in a little extra 
effort and deal with a less glossy desktop) any modern distro would be a 
pain to install on an old machine.

I guess the interesting bit would be the hardware support issue, has any 
major distro dropped support for 386 or 486 processors in their default 
kernel?
