Squareyes!

&gt; does anyone know of any courses apart from those run by TAFE, 
&gt; which are well outside my financial and locale situation?? Pensioner
&gt; living  1 1/2 hours out of Adelaide.

A pity; I would invite you to my place but that you were so far away.

&gt; Is it wise to foster a 2 level society, them and us?

Very unwise in my opinion.

&gt; I am a self taught ordinary home user (who understands the difference
&gt; between an application, and a programme, seems they are both
&gt; programmes with differing functions)

Fair enough. Generally, though people refer to computer programs as
"program" not "programme [sic]". It's minor point but it shows that a
lot of computing terminology is American.

&gt; who is only trying to become
&gt; self sufficient, but seem to be confronted with one problem after
&gt; another. I have read ( regarding Linux) "Try a few distributions, and
&gt; find one that suits you", till now have tried a few and apart from
&gt; Mandrake 7 have not arrived at a trouble free user friendly operating
&gt; system. On reflection I never tried printing from that so can't really
&gt; say it was trouble free.

You might like to try Mandrake 9.0. I am currently using a distribution
called "Libranet" at work and it's very nice. I'm currently looking at
distributions to make a number of them Linux compatible and friendly for
end users such as yourself.

&gt; Is there anywhere running courses that will give me the necessary
&gt; knowledge to solve the problems that keep arising? I haven't got the

Contact Don Williamson on 08 8298 9966. He and Robyn Manning run Linux
Courses (amongst other things) and may be able to help you.

&gt; If I am having these problems, there must be many others in the same 
&gt; situation, who just leave Linux alone, and put in the too hard basket.

Agreed.

&gt; I don't want or need to be a "geek" I have maybe 25 years so don't
&gt; have the time :-) all I need is an operating system away from Windows
&gt; that can be used or manipulated by me to work without my needing to
&gt; become an IT pro.

You could then try Lindows or Lycoris. Contact me and I'll send you a
copy of Lycoris...

&gt; With the current Mandrake9 could run "printtool" in
&gt; my sleep. Over the last 10 months have installed, arrived at total
&gt; frustration, uninstalled, reinstalled, and arrived at the same total
&gt; frustration, disposed of half a box of continuous paper, etc. Have
&gt; supprised myself with my patience, didn't think I had any

Then you have learned something from all this grief.

&gt; Please take this in the spirit it was written, I am not complaining or
&gt; trying to put Linux in a bad light, or intending to upset anyone,I am

You're expressing what a lot of people think about Linux; unfortunately
you can't claim that it's just you, although this may be a Good Thing
[tm].

&gt; with being a geek) Sorry about that. I have attended 2 meetings and
&gt; they seem to be aimed at the higher levels, and go right over my head,
&gt; so any info on a suitable course would be much appreciated if anyone
&gt; knows of any.

Then we may have passed like ships in the night.

&gt; On your web site you ask for any suggestions for subjects for future
&gt; meetings: Have you thought of doing something for new users?

I'll be giving a talk on Squid and caching aimed at intermediate users
at the next meeting (which Geoffrey is yet to announce ;-P).

&gt; Take care, and be only as good as you need to be

If I took that advice I could have flamed you out of existence ;-P
