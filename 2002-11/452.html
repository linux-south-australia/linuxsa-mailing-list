Remembrance Day 2002
"Lest We Forget"

 At 11 Am on Monday 11 November countless thousands around the world
 will hear those words as they stand quietly in silent remembrance of
 the men and women who have died from war.

 Remembrance Day was originally called Armistice Day and it reflected
 the beginning of Peace after the First World War, "The War to End All
 Wars" on the 11th of November 1917.

 What are we going to Remember as we bow our heads on Monday? Will we
 be thinking of the gallant Australians who fought in the Boer War?
 Perhaps the ANZACS will come to mind. Maybe your thoughts will be on
 Troop actions closer to home? Could we be thinking of those lost
 through World War 2 or perhaps the Korean Vietnam or Desert Storm
 conflicts? Some of us will be thinking of those who gave their lives
 in undeclared wars such as the War against Terrorism being fought in
 Afghanistan, the Philippines, Bali and many other places.

 In Australia and many Commonwealth countries they play the Last Post
 during the service, in the US and other countries the tradition is to
 play Taps. Follow these links to hear a rendition of these traditional
 tunes.  As you listen to the music silently give thanks for those who
 made the ultimate sacrifice;
