Ian,

&gt; Perhaps because it was able to read and write in so many formats?

So can MS Word and it generally doesn't stuff formatting up.

&gt; Perhaps because it was able to run on so many different platforms 
&gt; without a problem with transferring files from one platform to
&gt; another?

A point.

&gt; Perhaps because it takes up so little room compared to MS Office?

What? I want the drugs you're on...OpenOffice takes up less space than
MS Office?

&gt; Perhaps because it is amenable to be altered to what YOU want it to be
&gt; and not what the program had decided you really wanted?

It's not. The whole point of an office application appears to be that
"it knows better than you". And Open Office Writer is just as painful as
MS Word in this respect.

It even has a stupid star of David that keeps on trying to tell me about
the XML saving formats.

&gt; Perhaps because it is so easily updatable so updates wont need a 
&gt; Service Pack because there would (hopefully) be less need to correct 
&gt; previous bad coding?

Is this good or bad? Users want to see stability and not continual
updates. Ideally they'd get OpenOffice 1.0 and it would WORK without
patches and stuff.

&gt; Perhaps because the licensing allows you to take the program home and 
&gt; run it on your home computer without worrying about the software
&gt; police knocking on your door?

I take your point.
