I recieved the auto reply from them, thank you for your enquiry da da 
da.......but nothing else. In the end Opera was the only browser I could get 
to work. I tried Konq but there must be something wrong with my 
configuration.

&gt; Reload Opera and I am into the site with full access. Opera doesn't
&gt; seem to like his FLASH (?) Pages so I better look into that aspect

&gt;
&gt; Why do people design sites like this?
&gt;
&gt; Now, IMHO, the persons to speak to are the people who paid him to
&gt; design the site, they must have given him a design brief, maybe they
&gt; are not aware that he has designed in a closed-source restriction.
&gt;
&gt; They are;
&gt;
&gt; ITD Resources Pty Ltd (ABN 86 076 392 062)
&gt; Trading as Wine Jobs Australia
&gt; 28 Greenhill Road
&gt; Wayville SA 5034
&gt; Australia.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Let them know that he is deliberately blocking people from access into
&gt; the site if they are using browsers other than Internet Exploiter. Let
&gt; them know that a number of other browsers are easily able to access the
&gt; site once they get past his restriction page.
&gt;
&gt; Ask them if this is what they really intended to do, "Block access
&gt; unless the reader has that specific brand of browser?"
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
