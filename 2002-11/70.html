Hi.

&gt; Here is a concrete example. According to the executives at Lindows, they 
&gt; have put about $1 Million dollars into Wine.
&gt; 
&gt; However, a brand new company can go out and deliver a product that is 
&gt; just as good as Lindows, having _not paid_ the $1 Million dollars.

Not true, otherwise Lindows would not even get started. Lindows is more
than just current wine, packaged in a working distro. There's lots of
other stuff involved in creating a workable Linux/Wine distro for the
Lindows target market. That, and the ability to market to a paying target
market is what makes Lindows a saleable product.

If another company is going to create a Lindows rip-off, they will have to
go through a process to create it, which will cost. They will benefit from
Lindows' investment in Wine, but so does everyone else, and Lindows knew
that when they made the decision.

&gt; 
&gt; But what I am saying, is that the developer should have some of his 
&gt; costs reimbursed. The only way to do that is to embed the cost in the 
&gt; license, otherwise the company.
&gt; 
&gt; I am also saying that projects that make our software should be able to 
&gt; collect some funding if all the distributors do is download the source 
&gt; and throw a logo on a cd. If they make the product work better, no 
&gt; royalties to pay.
&gt; 

And given the GPL and open source culture, WHO is going to police this?
Are we going to have a FSF Software Assurance body like the BSA? How could
all the GPL software become re-licensed under a new GP (General Pay)
License without a legal quagmire emerging?

If you look at the Lindows case on it's own, it's simple: Lindows created
a business plan that involved projected sales of a software product that
included a more capable Wine than what was available. Part of the plan
would have been to improve Wine so that the Lindows project was
successful, and the budgeted sales achieved. 

It's commercially true, even if it seems cruel, that if Lindows makes a
sizable error on the target market size, and it's ability to penetrate it,
or the size of investment in Wine required to deliver the required
functionality, then it will probably go broke unless it finds another
source of funds.

I guess I would like Lindows to succeed, but I can't see the point in
mortgaging all the work that has been done by thousands of individuals to
try and create a protected developer species. Isn't that what we're trying
to get away from?

Regards,

Michael
