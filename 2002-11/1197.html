heh, its a good one..

we had renamed our header and footer include files in our website for 
our page banners
and I had them referenced on the 404/403/500 pages the server displays....

the one it shows when it cant find a page.. and as it couldnt find the 
page, it tried to show the page saying it couldnt find a page.. and in 
that page it couldnt find a page, so it tried to load the page saying it 
couldnt find the page and in that page it couldnt find a page, so it 
tried to load the page saying it couldnt find the page

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; got a bit of a problem with apache 1.3.27 (compiled from source only 
&gt; with --enable-module=so but I tried with other compile options too) on 
&gt; RH7.2 with php versions (4.2.1 and 4.3.0pre)
&gt; 
&gt; I am getting the error loading any of the pages in documentroot;
&gt; "[error] server reached MaxClients setting, consider raising the M
&gt; MaxClients setting"
&gt; 
&gt; and apache crashes.
&gt; the MaxClients is set to 250 (256 being the max it can have)
&gt; 
&gt; now the server has been fine up until yesterday, then it has started 
&gt; doing this everytime without fail, even loading the simplest of pages.
&gt; I have tried recompiling/installing apache 3 times and that has made no 
&gt; difference, also have tried the new php 4.3.0pre instead of the original 
&gt; php.4.2.1 compiled only with apxs, cli and mysql support, but to no avail.
&gt; with a ps ax I can see hundreds of httpd processes and they arent dying 
&gt; off.
&gt; I am wondering if this is a bug or is there some kind of configuration 
&gt; change I can make, this is the relevant section of the httpd.conf;
&gt; 
&gt; Timeout 300
&gt; KeepAlive On
&gt; MaxKeepAliveRequests 100
&gt; KeepAliveTimeout 15
&gt; MinSpareServers 5
&gt; MaxSpareServers 10
&gt; StartServers 5
&gt; MaxClients 250
&gt; MaxRequestsPerChild 0
&gt; 
&gt; googling comes up with links to methods of tuning the server, but I 
&gt; suspect it is more than this since the same config worked for two months 
&gt; without a problem.
&gt; 
&gt; has anyone had this problem? or is having similar problems?
&gt; this is a production server and it has died on me (and re-compiling and 
&gt; installing isnt fixing it) so I am a bit lost as to where to look now..
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
