No, it is just being realistic about what the average Joe is aware of 
and what people like you and I who have some computer experience are 
much more aware of.

The delineation is provided by a group of readers made up of those who 
know something about computers and those who know very little about 
computers but may be interested in what a journo had to say about them.

By rights, as has been said earlier, an Operating system, while being a 
program, is much more than just a program as it has to carry out many 
more lower level functions and provide an environment where more usual 
programs can operate. So, to a beginner, or a lay person, or the 
average Joe, I would say that an Operating System is not a program, as 
they might define the word.

Hope that helps.

And if you live in the North perhaps I might be able to help out with 
easing some of your Linux problems.

Cheers,  Ian
