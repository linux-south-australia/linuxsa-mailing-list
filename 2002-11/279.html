Hi.

First, I'd like to say that I believe that both of these ISP's are good
quality long-term players in the adelaide market, so don't take these
comments the wrong way...

If you do the math, you will see that there is very little difference in
the rack rates of $119 and $135. Why? because Adam charge on a 4 week
cycle, which gives 13 months against Internode's 12. So that's $1547 vs
$1620 per year, not $1428 vs $1620. You also have to consider the risk of
blowing the download limit metered on a weekly basis against a monthly
one.

As usual, feel free to corrct me if I'm wrong, but that's how I see it.

Michael

&gt; &gt;yeah that's great - but you forgot the crucial information that is all
&gt; &gt;people really care about - how much bandwidth and for how much?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I didn't see a need to clutter up the list with figures, but since you 
&gt; asked, it's $19/week for 256/64K with 1G of data per week, or 
&gt; $21.50/week for 512/128K with 1G of data per week.
&gt; 
&gt; It also includes free data from gamingsa.com, a free Netcomm 
&gt; modem/router, free setup/provisioning/activation. We also throw in 2 
&gt; movie passes so you have something to do while you're waiting for 
&gt; Installation :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;ADSL modems are coming right down in price - now not much more than 1 or 2
&gt; &gt;months of ADSL.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does it beat Internode?  Internode offers 8GB for $135 / month is hard to
&gt; &gt;beat..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; That's the beauty of a free market, you get to decide which plan beats 
&gt; which. The equivalent plan at Adam starts at $119 for approximately 8.6 
&gt; Gigs per month on a 256K connection.
