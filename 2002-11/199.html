actually, I thought it was right on topic for Linux.

If what we are making and giving away are tanks and the public all want 
station wagons then just because it is free will not be good enough to 
make people switch over to our free tanks.

So how do we reach the line where what is being produced by the Linux 
community is closer to the "station wagons" the public are expecting to 
buy?

Maybe people want to buy the free software? Lindows seem to be reaching 
that market. Maybe people just want to know there is some support out 
there. Mandrake and certainly Red Hat seem to be playing up to that 
market.

We cant go down the path of offering peer level user support;
&gt; Bullhorn: "But if you accept one of our free tanks we will send 
&gt; volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you sleep!" 
&gt; 
&gt; Buyer: "Stay away from my house, you freak!"
&gt;

So how do you see Linux expand to not just giving away their tanks BUT 
selling off a few station wagons too?

Cheers,  Ian
