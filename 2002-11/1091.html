&gt; And while we're on the topic, what's with the power connectors on
&gt; UPS's?  They all seem to have the male computer power connectors
&gt; (don't know the real name for that style of three-prong), which means
&gt; you can't plug just any old device into them, you have to have one
&gt; that takes the right type of cable. Why don't they just have the
&gt; normal Australian-style connectors?

That would mean that they would have to manafacture a differnt UPS for each country! The plugs are a world standard, where as outlets are not! In the current situation all they need to do is change the power cord they supply.

&gt; Can you get adapters, so I can
&gt; plug (say) a Modem PSU into it?

Buy a power board.
Cut of plug.
Go to Jaycar, buy plug thingo.
Put plug thingo on power board.
Instant adapter with many outputs!


&gt; Is there any reason why you shouldn't?

Nup ! We do it so that if the power goes down we can still remotely get to the machine :)

&gt; I mean, seriously, who has oodles of male-female computer three-prong
&gt; power cords lying around anyway? &lt;/rant&gt;

Agreed, and they charge through the nose for them!!!!

Cheers,

Ben.......

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm going to buy a UPS (hold your applause until the end, please), and
&gt; &gt; I was wondering if anyone has experience with any of the brands I can
&gt; &gt; get hold of easily -- specifically, how easy they are to configure so
&gt; &gt; they will notify your computer of power out, impending battery out,
&gt; &gt; and so on, so your computer can shut itself down nicely before it all
&gt; &gt; gets messy... Brands my suppliers stock are: Pro Power, PC Power,
&gt; &gt; Nikko, and Opti. I'm not familiar with any of these -- the only ones
&gt; &gt; I've ever dealt with previously are SOLA and APC.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any other comments re UPSes?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Note that the purpose here is for a single machine, which is a
&gt; &gt; non-mission critical server -- budget is around $250, and I expect to
&gt; &gt; get a 500VA device for that.
