Matthew,

&gt; Would that actually stop LinuxSA from being able to submit something?

One point of view says that LinuxSA does not exist at all legally. The
other point of view, which I tend to agree with, is that LinuxSA is an
unincorporated group of individuals who have a reasonably well-defined
purpose and membership criteria [which incidentally opens another set of
considerations].

Glen Turner actually got some real legal advice about what risks would
occur if someone (eg, Geoffrey Bennet) made a statement on behalf of
"LinuxSA" for some definition of "LinuxSA". That advice in summary was
that it was a tricky and perhaps dangerous path to lead.

I am having a go at searching for the e-mail in the mailing archives but
I can't quite get the words right for htdig to give me what I want.

&gt; It may make it a little harder, but I wouldn't have thought it
&gt; impossible.

I put to you two logical propositions:

1) If LinuxSA doesn't actually exist, just how is LinuxSA supposed to
say anything?

2) If LinuxSA does exist who should take responsibility for something
that "LinuxSA" purportedly says?

I think James Leone pointed out, and I would hope sarcastically, that we
can't even decide whether HTML e-mail should be allowed onto the list
even though it's one of the few things the organisers of LinuxSA have
actually made a rule about.
