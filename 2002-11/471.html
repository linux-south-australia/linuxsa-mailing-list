&gt; Yeah, another markup language, that's a good idea. HTML I agree now

&gt; a modification to both.

I think a lot of you are missing the original point.

...why?

What's wrong with plain text email?  I don't know about you, but an 
email screaming at me with a bright pink coloured background and big 
yellow flashing Comic Sans MS text doesn't really do it for me.

95% of mail clients automatically hyperlink URL's these days anyway, so 
an argument of "we want links in our email" isn't really valid.

The only thing I can think that HTML email would provide that text 
can't, is if you're selling a product, and you want your email to look 
catchy - and hell, who likes spam? ;-)

Plain text standard formatted emails means all my emails are consistent 
- I can read them easily.  Its the way I like it, and I sure don't want 
it to change.
