&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well I think us Linux folk need to be putting less emphasis on the
&gt; &gt; free and more emphasis on what it really does, you know th phrase,
&gt; &gt; "sell the sizzle".
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, if one could obtain Microsoft Office for free, was not an open
&gt; source expert and could install it on what would essentially be a free
&gt; (as in beer) operating system, why would one use Linux or OpenOffice?
&gt; 
&gt; DSL

Are you looking for sources of sizzle ?

Well (to get the ball rolling) and in 25 words or less....

I would use Linux (in any case) because:

1/ I "own" the tools I am using
2/ Huge range of applications
3/ Better performance
4/ Choice of mix and match file systems
5/ Better application (and OS) install processes
6/ Way better security
7/ Better networking
8/ It's an important alternative to the "corporate norm"
(so it adds some bio-diversity to the computing world)
9/ Updates to everything are really easy
(well on Debian at least)
10/ I can get under the hood
11/ I have the opportunity of contributing / putting back something to a
community.(so it is more human in approach) 12/ I can request (or
implement) features or even new applications. 13/ Stability !
14/ I can jump onto the "train" at any level form absolute newbie 
through &lt;shudder&gt; "poweruser" to guru/ wizard.(and/ Who uses office
suites anyway :&gt;) 15/ The choice of interfaces is stunning I can find or
configure (even make) something that suites me and the way _I_ work not
the way some MS / Marketing wanker thinks I should.(E17 to TTY/consol).
16/ In the end it is a more creative environment and that is a "Good
Thing" for humans.

I could do this the other way around I guess:
Why I would not use Microsoft Windows even if they gave it to me ..

The short answer is that as far as most people are concerned they do
"give" it to you (I know that's not true and that is another reason
--the "cultural and intrenched subterfuge").

I have found that throwning heavy implements at monitors does not make
Windoze "go away" but Fdisk does :)
