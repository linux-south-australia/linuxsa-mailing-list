&gt;&gt; Then how come the majority of the HTML spam that I receive contains
&gt;&gt; embedded images?

&gt; I'm pretty sure I already addressed this question, however to save anyone
&gt; from having to read back, the truth is that the HTML doesn't contain the
&gt; images, rather the spam contains attachments and HTML tags to display it.

True, but what stops people (read: spammers) from abusing that?  With a
text only email, there's no incentive to include attachments of people
having sex with backhoes.

Note that I'm not a text only, for ever more, purist.  But I certainly
don't believe HTML is the answer either.

&gt;&gt; it confuses presentation with content, so using something
&gt;&gt; so "90's" would be a pretty poor decision too, wouldn't you agree?

&gt; No, I don't think that is agreed.

If I were to quote the above (as quoted by you) if were in HTML and by an
"intelligent" MUA, how would it distinguish whose comments were whose?
How would HTML mark those sections as belonging to a particular author,
so that the mail agent could correctly attribute (and perhaps format to
my preferences when displaying locally) those comments?   Something SGML-like
could carry this off (perhaps XML - I've only paid it a cursory glance, but
Paul Graham has described it as being "S-expressive", which would mean it
could handle such recursive data structures).

&gt; It makes no confusion about presentation and content.

Which is why paragraph elements have style attributes.  Sorry, but HTML
mixes presentation and content constantly.

&gt; Really, the major problems some people gripe about are the inclusion
&gt; of graphic attachments, and weaknesses with some widely used rendering
&gt; agents.

And until Microsoft take even a vague interest in securing their email
clients, do you think it's socially responsible to be advocating
HTML email use?
