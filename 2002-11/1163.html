Sorry geeks, but I got a dozen requests for the explanation of why
electrical appliances in some parts of the world are not earthed.

Disclaimer: I'm not an electrician, electronic engineer or electrical
engineer, nor someone who understands the flow of electrons through a
solid. :P 

This was an explaination that I got last year when over there (Laos).
(some details might be wrong...)

Basically the mains wiring in the region is dodgy at bestand should not
to be trusted... an appliance is not off unless unplugged. Heck, where I
was the circuit breaker was used as a light switch.

Most appliances switch only the active wire (the brown wire or red in
older wires) but some are miswired (especially in asia) and switch the
neutral instead.

Neutral is at zero volts with respect to earth. If a toaster (for
instance) should develop a fault, the active is shorting to the chassis.
If you touch the toaster, you will get an electric shock. 

Howevere, If the toaster is earthed, but the earth wire is not connected
to a stake in the ground but is connected to the neutral, it will travel
back along the netural, trying to ground out. So it can't find an earth
in the premises in which it originated, it will go back along the power
lines untill it find a path down to earth. Perhaps through your
fusebox. Some fuseboxes over there have been litterally blown apart
from hundreds of amps surging through the wires.

However, it can be done by using an isolating transformer and earthing
your side of the transformer. But you are talking $$$ to do this. The
Telcos and some of the embassies do but too expensive for everyone
else.

That was a rought laymans explaination. Is there a sparky or someone who can explain this better on the list??
asking an electrician about the difference between floating and earthed power supplies.
