If you and friends are interested in 3 D modelling there was a quite large
exhibit by a Mad Academy / True life creations  who were showing off
products from Discreet such as 3-D Studio max5 and some other nice ( but
expensive ) 3D modelling packages.

Must say the ONLY thing I knew about the expo was a few mentions on this
list some months ago. It was very low key in terms of advertising. Overall
I'm glad that I didnt pay $10 to go - it might not be a huge expense but
there wasn't a lot of stuff there.

&gt; When you get a report showing that South Australia,
&gt; supposedly the IT
&gt; Centre of Australia, has an internet takeup of less
&gt; than a third of the
&gt; population, you don't wonder anymore about why few
&gt; turn up to geeky
&gt; events like WiredUp.

I think most people down with computers percieve Wired
Up as lanes of marketing fliers, a slicker, moneyed-up
equivalent of those broken business model booths in
the Royal show pavillions.

I went last year because I was willing to deal with
the marketing if the technology demonstrations were
sufficiently cool. They were not, nor were they new as
advertised.

I didn't go this year, nor did the idea sum up any
enthusiasm in my friends. Those guys are interested in
3d modelling, programming and games and had nowhere to
be on that day. We spent our $10 on 10 packs of
arnotts shapes that were on special at Coles. They
provided adequate sustenence for the Mario Sunshine
marathon. We have no regrets about not seeing Wired Up.
