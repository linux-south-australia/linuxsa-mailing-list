&gt; &gt; &gt; Many insiders have come to the conclusion that we aren't able to

&gt; &gt; &gt; you have to buy their click and run service.

&gt; &gt; Maybe I misunderstood this.  It sounds like Lindows.com, in violation of
&gt; &gt; the GPL, only comes with kernel source for a fee.  They've been so good
&gt; &gt; to the wine project that it would be inconsistent of them to try that.
&gt; &gt; What's the real, detailed reason that insiders think you can't compile
&gt; &gt; the kernel without buying click and run?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that is a violation of the GPL. It only says that you have 
&gt; to make the sources available, not that they have to be free.
&gt; 
&gt; It _is_ unusual to not make them freely downloadable, but not in violation 
&gt; of the GPL, I believe.
&gt; 

Interesting, but, my interpretation would be different, particularly
when asking for commercial gain. When the GPL states that source should
be available, the 'intent' I'm sure would have been as part of the
package. eg the source can be had from ftp, http, on the cd etc etc.
The danger of acknowledging rights to charge for the source separately
from the program would be to limit who has access to the source. Indeed
if your interpretation was correct, it could be used as a defacto
controlling mechanism by charging huge sums of money knowing that the
vast majority of users would be unable to meet that criteria.

This, I'm sure was not the intention of the GPL
