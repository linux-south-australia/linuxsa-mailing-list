&gt; Looking at Foreshew's article in The Australian, I can see how perhaps
&gt; what was written make sense in "lay terms".  From a copyright point of
&gt; view developers do not lose the ability to assert ownership, but they do
&gt; lose the ability to assert control, which is arguably the most important
&gt; aspect of ownership to a software manufacturing business.  Sue Tippett
&gt; went on to highlight a concern that employees (of a software developer)
&gt; could, for example, use a piece of open-source software that they download
&gt; from somewhere, and incorporate it into a program for their employer
&gt; without understanding the implications.  This is a very real threat.

Is this any different from a developer using some code from a Microsoft 
Developer CD, or using some other MS code that is NDA'ed 'shared' source 
when they don't realize that this is the case?

I think the problem with GPL is that there is an unchecked mindset in 
the general public that just thinks of it as being 'free'. It seems that 
people just see the term 'free', and before they can put their mind into 
gear, wishfull thinking takes over.
