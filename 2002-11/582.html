i have a related question - i'm connecting to a RH8.0 box using puTTY 
from a windows box. no problems with vim like matthew, but my (minor) 
issue is dashes in man pages - they display as an "a" with a 
circumflex[1] above it. it doesn't interfere with any funcionality, it 
just makes man pages harder to read (eg, in `man ln`, some of the lines 
read:

        ‚b     like ‚‚backup but does not accept an argument

        ‚d, ‚F, ‚‚directory
               hard link directories (super‚user only)

any clues? TERM is set to xterm, and puTTY is an xterm emulator, and i 
don't have the same problem when connected to RH6/7 boxen.

[1] that's the accent that's the same as a caret - ^ (i.e. shift + 6 on 
most keyboards)

&gt; Okay,
&gt; I've installed RH8.0 no problems.
&gt;
&gt; But VIM seems to be behaving very oddly.
&gt;
&gt; Using EXACTLY the same method to connect to them machine that works fine
&gt; with RH7.x I cannot get any ed commands to work - I just end up back 
&gt; in edit
&gt; mode!  (using Tera Term SSH from Windows)
&gt;
&gt; so if I do the key sequence (no spaces) "ESC : w q !" to write and 
&gt; quit, I
&gt; end up in edit mode with a new line and a capital "M" at the start.
&gt;
&gt; Now, I've used vi for a while now (&gt;1 decade) and I cannot work out 
&gt; why it's
&gt; acting this way.  It looks like an extra character is being generated but
&gt; where and why?
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone experienced this wierdness?
