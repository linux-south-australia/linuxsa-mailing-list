Peter,

I upgraded to Evolution 1.2 from Ximian's RPM package for Mandrake 9.0.
Upgrading was seemless, I just left my Evolution directory alone and
didn't have to perform any importing of my Evolution 1.0.8 data.

One weird thing was that my contacts didn't show up. I quit Evolution
typed killev, restarted and everything was OK.

Evolution 1.2 is a lot faster for indexing operations. The hard disc
doesn't churn nearly as much as compared to Evolution 10.8 when
receiving new mail.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm currently trying Evolution, and it seems like it might be worth
&gt; &gt;&gt; switching to.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure how many have tried the current release (1.2), but it's 
&gt; a huge jump from the 1.0 versions.  I installed it from Mandrake's
&gt; cooker a week or so ago (go urpmi :), and apart from having a few hassles
&gt; with 
&gt; migrating my 1.0.x contacts across, the upgrade was quite smooth, 
&gt; although I did have to import my messages back in rather than just
&gt; copy the evolution folder across as with prior upgrades.
&gt; 
&gt; Positives:
&gt; - Nice new configuration dialog, pretty much everything's in one place now,
&gt; and logically arranged unlike before :)
&gt; - Faster, well it seemed faster on my poor old Celery 300 (still waiting 
&gt; for a replacement CPU for my Athlon so had to revert to the spare :(
&gt; - More stable, haven't managed to kill it yet.  With 1.0.x I had to use
&gt; "oaf-slay" on occasions when it refused to start properly after crashing.
&gt; 
&gt; Negatives:
&gt; Took me a while to work out how to import my contacts from v1.0.x,
&gt; turns out you select all the contacts and save them to a vcard file.
&gt; Personally I'd like to see the import/export wizard (which is excellent
&gt; I might add....) include contacts as well.
