Hi all,
does anyone know of any courses apart from those run by TAFE, 
which are well outside my financial and locale situation?? Pensioner living  
1 1/2 hours out of Adelaide.
=========================================

I read : 
"Sure Linux is a program as are all operating systems, but that is for 
the geeks amongst us to preach.  Lets leave the general public with 
just enough information so they think they understand the concepts. &lt;G&gt;

If the author had said "application" instead of "program" then we would 
have found nothing wrong with his statement but lots of users would not 
have grasped what an application was. It has taken us this long for 
them to understand what a program is! ",
=========================================

and this prompted my Email.
Is it wise to foster a 2 level society, them and us?
I am a self taught ordinary home user (who understands the difference between 
an application, and a programme, seems they are both programmes with 
differing functions), who is only trying to become self sufficient, but seem 
to be confronted with one problem after another. I have read ( regarding 
Linux) "Try a few distributions, and find one that suits you", till now have 
tried a few and apart from Mandrake 7 have not arrived at a trouble free user 
friendly operating system. On reflection I never tried printing from that so 
can't really say it was trouble free.

Is there anywhere running courses that will give me the necessary knowledge
to solve the problems that keep arising? I haven't got the need for a complete 
IT course which TAFE offers and includes Linux as a module, I have maybe 25 
years left . Have aquired a few books on the subject (don't learn very well 
from books), have spent many hours looking at FAQ's and Emails and am still 
in the same situation.

If I am having these problems, there must be many others in the same 
situation, who just leave Linux alone, and put in the too hard basket.
I don't want or need to be a "geek" I have maybe 25 years so don't have the 
time :-) all I need is an operating system away from Windows that can be used 
or manipulated by me to work without my needing to become an IT pro. 
With the current Mandrake9 could run "printtool" in my sleep. Over the last 10 
months have installed, arrived at total frustration, uninstalled, 
reinstalled, and arrived at the same total frustration, disposed of half a 
box of continuous paper, etc. Have supprised myself with my patience,
didn't think I had any


At the moment, Linux gets used for Internet connection , Email and The Gimp, 
Windows for all the rest. 

Please take this in the spirit it was written, I am not complaining or trying 
to put Linux in a bad light, or intending to upset anyone,I am only trying to 
put myself in the position to solve my own problems, and become self 
sufficient, where I don't have to keep asking for help, don't like anything 
to get the better of me, or too beholding to others, without becoming a 
"geek" (not that there is anything wrong with being a geek) Sorry about that. 
I have attended 2 meetings and they seem to be aimed at the higher levels, 
and go right over my head, so any info on a suitable course would be much 
appreciated if anyone knows of any.

On your web site you ask for any suggestions for subjects for future meetings:
Have you thought of doing something for new users?

Thanks again for your time and the easing of much frustration.
I sincerely hope I didn't ruffle too many feathers, this was definitely not my 
intention. 

Take care, and be only as good as you need to be

Winton
