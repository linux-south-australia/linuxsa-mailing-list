&gt;&gt; In the last year I've been forced on occasion to use a Microsoft-based
&gt;&gt; MUA.  In order to display a number of things, I had to use it in full-

&gt;&gt; 200 characters long, and there was nothing I could do about it.

&gt; It sounds rather like what you had to read could not have been
&gt; presented in plain text at all.

What gives you that idea?  It was perfectly normal, unembellished
text.  The issue is that these toys are so subdivided that you can't
display enough of the subject line, for example, without going to full
screen.  Full screen is also good for tables, but it's not good for
text.

&gt; So what you are saying is that mail, which was of such unusual
&gt; aspect that it required HTML, displayed using long lines.  That
&gt; doesn't sound like a criticism of HTML email at all.  To the
&gt; contrary, it sounds like an endorsement.

On the contrary, it's broken.  It's uncomfortable to read text that
wide.  The same, indcidentally, applies to
<A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.">http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/todavid.html.</A>  As you can see at
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/alldavid.gif,">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/alldavid.gif,</A> only one of the
paragraphs was more than one line.  The list of sizes that Daniel had
placed inline and left justified is now at the extreme right.

I think that one of the issues we have here is that you think that
lines should be as long as possible, whereas I am (marginally, some
might say) human and have a limited field of vision, requiring me to
move my eyes to read long lines.

Years ago, I did a course in speed reading.  In this course, I
discovered that when reading a novel, a typical reader fixates on
about three places in a line.  With practice, you can do it with one
fixation, which also means that you can read several lines with one
fixation, greatly speeding up reading rates.  That's easier with
newspapers in columns.  It's impossible if you overextend the line.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I should imagine that quoted text could be quite clear if preceeded
&gt;&gt;&gt; by the usual attribution line and enclosed in a cell with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; different coloured background.  A reasonable GUI agent should permit
&gt;&gt;&gt; cut and paste, or intermingling new text.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How many colours can you distinguish?  How many before you lose track
&gt;&gt; of the sequence?  How do you print them out?  Here I see a total of
&gt;&gt; five mail messages, indicated by the indentation.  What colours would
&gt;&gt; you assign to each of them, and why?
&gt;
&gt; Entirely reasonable questions.  I think the use of colour is one that's
&gt; not very important, and easily open to argument.  There are alternatives,
&gt; such as placing quoted text in a bordered cell.

I'm not sure I understand the term.  Can you give an example (say, of
this message)?

&gt; In fact that is perhaps best because it makes it perfectly clear how
&gt; many levels deep a quote is.

So does a list of &gt;&gt;&gt;s 

&gt; This is easy to do in HTML.

That is easy to do in text.
