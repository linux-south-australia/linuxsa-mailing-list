The saddest thing about Remembrance Day (including GW being dismissed in
1975) was that those who sacrificed their lives did so for the petty
squablings of the Royal Houses of Europe (this includes those who died in
the Second War since it has been reasonably well established that this was
a direct economic outcome of the First).

The thing that we should remember over everything else here (including the
senseless slaughter of many many millions of people - both consenting and
not) is that wars don't just happen, they are not the results of actions
of politicians; they are the result of the inaction of us.

"He who joyfully marches in rank and file has already earned my contempt.
He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord
would suffice."

- Albert Einstein

&gt; Thanks mate, while the younger members may wonder why those of the
&gt; older generation remember days like this, the younger generation have
&gt; the life they have because the older generation built a future so that
&gt; their children could grow up in freedom.
&gt;
&gt; The sacrifices of those that didn't return and the sacrifices of those
&gt; that returned but as broken men and women are a big part of what has
&gt; built this country up. It is a proud tradition and deserves to be not
&gt; just maintained but adopted and supported by the younger generation.
