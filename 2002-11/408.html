Thanks for the help, all those who replied.  Unfortunately, however, none of 
the fixes suggested yielded any results.  I tried aliasing /dev/mouse 
with /dev/psaux (ln -s /dev/psaux /dev/mouse), to no avail.  I tried 
mouseconfig, using both interactive and kickstart mode.  I went 
into /sysconfig/hwconf and manually switched the "detached" value back to 0 
(I'm assuming Kudzu changed it to 1 when it informed me that the mouse had been 
removed). So, my hwconf file seems to be intact, mouseconfig is set up 
correctly, gpm is disabled (using ntsysv), and I'm out of options.  I don't 
understand why during install it functions perfectly, yet as soon as I boot the 
mouse is removed.  I'm starting to wonder if perhaps it has to do with the fact 
that it is a USB mouse running through a ps/2 adapter.  (FreeBSD, my first 
distro, didn't seem to mind.  As soon as I turned off console mouse services in 
FreeBSD, X ran my mouse just fine).  I'm thinking about just breaking down and 
buying a standard ps/2 and see if that works.  If anybody else has any 
suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again.
