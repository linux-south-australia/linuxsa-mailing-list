&gt; The interesting thing about his comment is it ignores the "T" in HTML.
&gt; HTML is text.  It contains no images, music, or any media other than
&gt; text.

Then how come the majority of the HTML spam that I receive contains
embedded images?  I don't receive 60K+ emails anywhere else.  (I used
to receive the odd one when I was sent patches via email, but heck,
I asked for those - I don't ever recollect asking for "Teenage Nymphette
Monthly", no matter how many times the emails tells me I "opted in").

&gt; Aren't asterisks, slashes and underlines for expression all so last
&gt; millenium, particularly when HTML lets you emphasise in &lt;b&gt;*bold*&lt;/b&gt;?

A majority of the English language is "last millenium" - should we be
dispensing with that too?  Newness for newness' sake isn't a particularly
valid reason.

I also noticed you use that quaint convention of sticking to less than
80 characters for your column width.  Any reason for that?

&gt; At the end of the day, all of the arguments that I have seen concerning
&gt; why not to use HTML are shallow attempts to disguise poor use of the tool
&gt; as defects in the tool.

At the end of the day, it's also agreed that HTML as a markup language
is pretty poor; it confuses presentation with content, so using something
so "90's" would be a pretty poor decision too, wouldn't you agree?

As for defective tools:  to be realistic, Outlook and Outlook Express are
probably the most used (I nearly wrote "popular") email clients in current
use.  "Nimda", "I Love You" and "Sircam" are just some of the popular
viruses that used these clients to populate.  I think that until Microsoft
can actually start making these products more secury, that's a good enough
reason to avoid HTML.
