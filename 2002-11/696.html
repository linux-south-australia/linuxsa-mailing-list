bluetooth is for connecting small devices together such as your laptop to your mobile phone 
/ printer / microwave oven etcetera.  802.11b (wifi) is wireless ethernet for file sharing, 
internet access etc.

if you have more than one 'puter and want to network them use wifi, if you want to search 
endlessly for bluetooth compatable devices then that's the go. ;-)

i wouldn't 'invest' in bluetooth hardware, although 802.11b is worth the money (imho).  
bluetooth is yet to be proven as much more than a technology companies want us to want.

hope this helps.

&gt; I am fairly new to all things laptop but wasn't Bluetooth going to 
&gt; redefine the whole wireless aspect?  How long is the investment in a 
&gt; 802.11b wireless card going to be good for?

&gt; 
&gt; And I guess what application are we going to use these cards for - I'd 
&gt; like to be able to sit in the park in Nth Adelaide and be able to 
&gt; send/receive e-mail while still being able to connect to a lan at home 
&gt; etc with the card, as well as others at linuxsa meetings and such.
&gt; 
&gt; Which would be the better investment?

&gt;  &gt; I type too fast for my own good sometimes.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt; Microbits will be at the InstallFest as the sole hardware supplier and
&gt;  &gt;&gt; we are able to supply D-Link 520 PCI wirless cards for $187 (including
&gt;  &gt;&gt; GST):
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I should clarify that any hardware supplier is welcome to sponsor or
&gt;  &gt; otherwise support the InstallFest (this year or next year or the years
&gt;  &gt; afterwards). Probably the best way to find out how is for someone to
&gt;  &gt; join the installfest mailing list :-)
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;&gt; I'll have a price for a DSL-650 PCMCIA device later today.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; And that price is $131 GST inclusive.

&gt;  &gt; Internode's Grenfell St premises ;-P]
