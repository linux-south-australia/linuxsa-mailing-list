&gt;&gt; Not at all.  Take a look at
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/mutt-view.gif">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/mutt-view.gif</A> to see how mutt
&gt;&gt; handles it.
&gt;
&gt; You use a text MUA that handles that problem gracefully.  Not all
&gt; text agents do so.  When you used an HTML agent it handled the
&gt; problem badly.  Not all HTML agents are so poor.  That particular
&gt; criticism must be seen as a problem with the particular agent, not
&gt; with the medium.

How can a web browser correctly handle text which doesn't contain
enough formatting information?  Which browsers do a better job?  Which
non-broken text MUAs break the text/plain format?

&gt;&gt; Since the format of the message is predetermined, you can make the
&gt;&gt; window as long as you like without running the risk of having the text
&gt;&gt; reformatted.  The window in this example is 120 characters wide, for
&gt;&gt; no particular reason.  It could easily have been double that.
&gt;
&gt; As you pointed out previously, I can format my text message to be 200
&gt; characters wide, and there's little you can do except put up with it or
&gt; reformat it.  Your frequent, "format recovered"  tags suggest you choose
&gt; to do the latter.

Actually, most of the time I just discard the message unread.

&gt; In fact, if you think about it, that's approximately the same as
&gt; browsers reformatting text to fit the display, except that in the
&gt; browser case I *expect* that to be done.

Exactly.  And I submit that that's incorrect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; While I'm impressed that you have a 2048 pixel wide screen, it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; your choice to make the display so wide and so a pretty feeble
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt at arguing a deficiency in HTML email.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What nonsense!  The choice is good, and I certainly didn't choose it
&gt;&gt; to argue against HTML.  That resolution is really useful.
&gt;
&gt; According to you it's not useful for viewing mail messages.  Resize your
&gt; window as you presumably would do when viewing most other web pages.

That's a pain, and it's unnecessary.  You keep suggesting workarounds
instead of recognizing the problem.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm surprised you resorted to such a cheap trick.  It makes you look
&gt;&gt;&gt; desperate and obviously nobody is going to be fooled by it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So far, you have argued in a reasonable manner.  The only way this
&gt;&gt; claim can be considered reasonable, however, would be if it were an
&gt;&gt; agreed fact that reformatting to the width of a window is desirable
&gt;&gt; and more important than the other advantages of a high resolution
&gt;&gt; screen.  But that's the point: it isn't.  Now you're just being silly
&gt;&gt; and a little insulting.
&gt;
&gt; Hmm, okay, if I'm being insulting I apologise.

Accepted.

&gt; The message that I was trying to convey, however, was that I figure
&gt; you would reasonably set your window to a reasonable size for the
&gt; content, rather than leave it at maximum.

And the message I'm trying to convey is that resizing windows to fit
the context is a pain.  Yes, I do it with other web pages too, and I
consider that to be a weakness of HTML as well.  But that's not the
issue here.

&gt;&gt; OK, I've gone to the trouble of looking at it
&gt;&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/nested.gif,">http://www.lemis.com/grog/htmlwars/nested.gif,</A> in case anybody's
&gt;&gt; paying attention).  Yes, you're right, it mimics the &gt;, better than
&gt;&gt; the example I showed you.  It's a matter of taste, I suppose, but I
&gt;&gt; find it painful.  It seems that one of the phenomena of new technology
&gt;&gt; is that people use it to excess.
&gt;
&gt; Yes indeed, which is probably the real reason so many are against HTML.
&gt; If we hadn't got inundated with HTML message containing ugly background
&gt; pictures and frothy borders we'd probably all have said, yes, HTML does
&gt; add a useful degree of expression.

It adds a useful degree of expression, but at a cost that makes it
hardly worth the trouble.

&gt; It's a pity that people immediately leaped to a poor use of the
&gt; technology, but I think that can be managed by education (just as we
&gt; currently do when we say no HTML.)

I think the real thing we should learn from HTML is that it introduced
a number of new concepts, some of them good, some of them bad.  A
solution to the issue will recognize and address both.
