&gt;My mouse absolutely refuses to work.  In both RH 8.0 and Mandrake 9.0, the 
&gt;graphical install and X config runs flawlessly, but on first boot it does not 
&gt;work.  I have a generic ps.2 wheel mouse, and I install it under generic 2 
&gt;button (because I got weird bugs when I tried installing generic 2 button 
&gt;scroll).  In RH 8, Kudzu informs me that my mouse has been removed on first 
&gt;boot.  In mandrake, it just refuses to work in X or gpm. I have tried disabling 
&gt;gpm, to no avail.  I read the error messages for X, and it said this:
&gt;
&gt;xf86OpenSerial:  cannot find device or file /dev/psaux
&gt;
&gt;It gives me the same error with other devices (/mouse, /psm0, etc).  In 
&gt;FreeBSD, my mouse worked with the mouse daemon enabled and X used 
&gt;BSD's "sysmouse" port with the "SystemMouse" protocol.  Unfortunately, neither 
&gt;RH nor Mandrake supports this scheme.  I am out of options.  Has anybody else 
&gt;had problems with this?  I don't understand why X is trying to open a serial 
&gt;port for a ps/2 mouse, but I can't find any documentation on why it does this 
&gt;or how to fix it.  Thanks in advance for any help.

It's not necessarily trying to open a ttySx / COM port type of serial
port. Mice use serial communication of one form or another;
xf86OpenSerial is a C++ method to open the appropriate type of serial
port for the mouse, in this case the synchronous serial port called a
PS/2 mouse port on /dev/psaux. If you had an RS232 port mouse, it
would be trying to open the type of serial port you're thinking of.

As DSL says, first make sure that /dev/psaux exists; also make sure
that it is both readable and writable by all. 

There is a bug in X 4.2 (at least) that prevents it properly
initialising (some) PS/2 mice. These mice will not listen to their
initialisation string unless they are first reset, which X fails to
do. To reset the mouse before X starts, send the byte 0xFF to
/dev/psaux and wait half a second or so. If you do not do this there
may be little point in trying to use ImPS/2 protocol as the mouse will
never switch into intellimouse emulation mode.
