&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong, I like some aspects of Solaris, but the basic bits
&gt; &gt; of infrastructure that I learn to take for granted on Linux

[snip]

&gt; You come to rely on certain infrastructure with Linux which just ain't there 
&gt; under Solaris.

It's much better now that Solaris comes with a lot of the GNU stuff on CD.
:-)

You really shouldn't complain too much about Solaris though, given that it's
probably the commercial unix closest to Linux in a lot of ways. SCO
OpenServer is really, really painful (particularly if you're used to the
Linux FHS), HPUX leaves a bit to be desired and there's countless others. :-)

I have actually found, though, that I'd much rather run some stupid
commercial flavour of UNIX on my desktop than Windows, not for religious
reasons, but because of the lack of tools needed for my work. Cygwin comes
close, but not close enough.

Two or three years ago, a friend asked me why it was that I bothered learning
how to use the ex editor and other tools like sed, given the abundance of
emacs, vi and perl. When he then needed my help editing a file on an Ultrix
machine that couldn't mount the filesystem that contained the libraries
needed for vi to run properly, he saw the answer. :-)

thx,
Matt
