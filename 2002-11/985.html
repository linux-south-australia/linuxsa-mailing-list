I am trying to figure out if this is just a mistake I made....

I am going to work on this to figure it out.

A newbies conclusion is one thing, but a vets is another.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Many insiders have come to the conclusion that we aren't able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;compile the kernel if the source was not provided by Lindows.com. To
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;compile the source and have much of anything turned on in the kernel,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have to buy their click and run service.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe I misunderstood this.  It sounds like Lindows.com, in violation of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the GPL, only comes with kernel source for a fee.  They've been so good
&gt;&gt;&gt;to the wine project that it would be inconsistent of them to try that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;What's the real, detailed reason that insiders think you can't compile
&gt;&gt;&gt;the kernel without buying click and run?
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't think that is a violation of the GPL. It only says that you have 
&gt;&gt;to make the sources available, not that they have to be free.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It _is_ unusual to not make them freely downloadable, but not in violation 
&gt;&gt;of the GPL, I believe.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Interesting, but, my interpretation would be different, particularly
&gt;when asking for commercial gain. When the GPL states that source should
&gt;be available, the 'intent' I'm sure would have been as part of the
&gt;package. eg the source can be had from ftp, http, on the cd etc etc.
&gt;The danger of acknowledging rights to charge for the source separately
&gt;from the program would be to limit who has access to the source. Indeed
&gt;if your interpretation was correct, it could be used as a defacto
&gt;controlling mechanism by charging huge sums of money knowing that the
&gt;vast majority of users would be unable to meet that criteria.
&gt;
&gt;This, I'm sure was not the intention of the GPL
