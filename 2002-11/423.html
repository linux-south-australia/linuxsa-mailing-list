&gt; Does anybody know what driver the Red Hat installation uses?

If installed from a CD, the installation probably was in X. I haven't been
paying attention to this thread, but did notice the last two emails,
specifically the one saying the mouse doesn't work with GDM, and the mouse
is a USB mouse with a PS2 converter. I have a similar problem. I'm running
Mandrake 9 and the mouse works in X, but not in the consoles (the cursor
goes crazy when I move the mouse when in the console, and GDM gives error
messages when starting and stopping - I should turn it off in ntsysv,
really). It's a MS IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0. I had an original IntelliMouse
explorer (it would be been 1.0, if they were numbering it back then) which
worked in the console with older distros, but after the cable got damaged, I
haven't used it. They're both USB mice and I used both of them with the PS2
converters.

Sorry if this has already been answered, but is the problem only in the
console or doesn't it work in X either?

I don't use the console any more (except when trying to install nvidia
drivers), so it's not a problem for me.

Andy
