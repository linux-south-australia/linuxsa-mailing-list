Okay, since I have also been "trying out" the new RedHat 8.0, I kind of
feel qualified to comment....

&gt; 
&gt; I chose to backup my existing linux partition (RH7.1) and make a fresh
&gt; install.  I normally "upgrade" that way because my system rarely stays
&gt; stock standard for long: When I have a problem I load and compile the
&gt; source from the, well, the source, and by the time a new distribution
&gt; comes out it's worth trying to go back to standard, at least as much as
&gt; possible.

Good call! Upgrading a redhat7.x to rh8 will most certainly cause
problems! I tried that first myself. The problems are that they are
completely different in nearly every respect.
Both use a different rpm for example, and in rh8 the rpm command has
been split into several binaries. An upgrade often trashes rpm first
making it impossible to continue. They also have different gcc's,
glibc's and nearly everything else. RH8 also uses gnome2.

&gt; 
&gt; I did have trouble with the install: While loading from the first CD the
&gt; installer grumbled about zlib, something about it not being an RPM, or
&gt; not having transferred successfully.  It offered me the chance to retry,
&gt; but when then promptly crashed after informing me there was no
&gt; /mnt/source/.discinfo.  This occurred twice in succession so on the
&gt; third time I flipped to the shell on virtual console 2, re-mounted the
&gt; CD in /mnt/source, deleted the zlib that it complained about and
&gt; recopied the rpm from the CD.  When I clicked the retry button it
&gt; ejected the CD and asked me to re-insert it, which I did, and it went on
&gt; it's merry way.  The same problem recurred with two other files, which I
&gt; solved the same way.
&gt; 
&gt; I have reason to suspect the problem was with my CD drive, and not with
&gt; the media.  Certainly my drive is flakey when writing, and indeed only
&gt; about half the disks that I write on it can be reliably read on other
&gt; drives.  The files that it complained about were the same size and date
&gt; as the ones on the CD, but did have different content.  I haven't
&gt; checked to see how they differ; it was probably my CD drive playing up.

Most certainly it was your cdrom. Try hitting it with a large rubber
mallet and then buy a new one!  ;-P

&gt; 
&gt; My sound system, based on VIA's 8233 south bridge, didn't work.  The
&gt; chip was detected okay, and the via82cxxx_audio module was configured,
&gt; however it fails to load.  Looking through the documentation I note that
&gt; that module, which was originally for the via 82c686 south bridge, was
&gt; patched to recognise the 8233 chip; however looking at the source I see
&gt; no indication of that.  The only PCI ID it recognises is for the
&gt; 82c686.  I had the same problem with RH7.1, and for that I used the ALSA
&gt; driver, which did then and still does work fine.

ALSA is your friend for those chips.

&gt; 
&gt; I rather like the new Gnome and the new KDE.  Setting up preferences is
&gt; easy, including volume controls, desktop themes and so on.  There's a
&gt; "preferences" item in the KDE menus, and a "preferences" folder in the
&gt; Gnome "Start here" folder.

Here RedHat have made great advances in making the desktop as familiar
to windows users as they can. The concept is straight out of M$
philosophies, and thus fails miserably in the eyes of experienced linux
users who prefer the command line. However, all the necessary command
line tools are available too should you wish to use them.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently trying Evolution, and it seems like it might be worth
&gt; switching to.  I have a suspicion that the nice "plain text wrapping"
&gt; that it's doing will translate to long paragraphs, but what the heck,
&gt; we've just discussed how plain text is a WISIWYS media so if that
&gt; happens it must be your imagination. :-)  Evolution supports multiple
&gt; IMAP servers, and permits me to pick my identity when I send each

Or pop servers, or both.....

&gt; email.  I think it will suit my needs, although I'm still getting used
&gt; to its way of doing things.  (I probably will always prefer Pine's Fcc
&gt; approach to saving copies of outgoing mail.)  If you think Outlook is a
&gt; good thing, and there are some quite sane people who do, then Evolution
&gt; is well worth a look at.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to say that I've never been terribly thrilled by the cavalier way
&gt; the linux community treats documentation, and RH8 seems to continue in
&gt; that vein.  There's too much of a black-box, "don't you worry you don't
&gt; have to know about that" mentality becoming apparent, which I think is
&gt; Microsoft's major weakness and I lament that we may follow them down the
&gt; same bad path.  The new, easy to use, point and click control panels
&gt; are, in this way, a double edged sword.  If you actually don't need or
&gt; want to know, you can just click and and it's done.  However if the
&gt; control panel doesn't let you set something the way you want it can be
&gt; difficult to discover exactly where the config files are kept.  Case in
&gt; point: I needed to add ALSA to the services settings, and I had to work
&gt; backwards from the source for redhat-config-services to find out how to
&gt; make it fit in with all the new bells and whistles.  Honestly I'd prefer
&gt; people didn't "innovate" in ways that break prior knowledge, but geeks
&gt; will be geeks and so I just have to put up with it.  I suppose it's a
&gt; small cost for what seems to be a fine system.
&gt; 

RedHat do have a miniscule amount of docs that actually do cover what
you want.
Try man chkconfig and look at the add option.
Also look in /usr/share/doc/ sometime.....

The real trick is knowing where to look!
