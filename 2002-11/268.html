&gt;Mac OS X "Least Prone to Attack"
&gt;By Remy Davison, Insanely Great Mac
&gt;October 31st 2002
&gt;
&gt;OS X thrashes Linux, Windows in the security stakes.
&gt;
&gt;Government departments, armed services, business, take note: a report 
&gt;by technology risk management company mi2g Ltd., which will be released 
&gt;today, says the Mac OS is the platform least vulnerable to hackers.
&gt;
&gt;mi2g's report states that of over 1,100 software vulnerabilities 
&gt;identified for the period Jan-Oct 2002, "fewer than 25 were 
&gt;attributable to the Macintosh operating system".
&gt;
&gt;Performing equally well were other Unix variants: Compaq's Tru64 and 
&gt;SCO Unix. Microsoft's Windows trailed the field with over 500 
&gt;vulnerabilities. 200 vulnerabilities were identified in Linux systems.
&gt;
&gt;Exceptionally few attacks were mounted against Macintosh hardware, with 
&gt;31 attacks recorded (0.5% of all digital attacks).

&gt;
&gt;Folks, how many times have we seen statistics like this bunch.
&gt;
&gt;When they show stats based on the real numbers of systems out there 
&gt;(market share) versus the real number of attacks they have sustained 
&gt;then we can see just how secure these systems are. 
&gt;
&gt;What is your take on this?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,  Ian

The company I was working for in 1989 was using TOPS networking
software to stick a couple of PCs onto an AppleTalk network. To cut a
long story short, we were using TOPS in a sort of weird way which
confused the licence-enforcement code so things sometimes didn't work.
(We weren't breaking the licence, just confusing the code.)

It was me who hacked TOPS so it did work. I would not be surprised if
there aren't really that many people out there who want to hack Macs,
in the same way as not many people want to stick their hand into a
meat grinder.
