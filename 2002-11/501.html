&gt;...making statements without the power to make change is essentially
&gt;vapour ware. If you believe a Labor Government will support open source
&gt;aims then why don't you just put your money where your mouth is and:

The question on whether or not they would support open source if they got
into power remains up for debate, I have a sneaking suspicion that not too
much would change, apart from the faces at the top.  Call me a pessimist, 
but I guess that's brought about by working in government ;-P

I merely stated that I'm skeptical of an opposition government getting on
the bandwagon of open source just to attract a few votes (whether this is
actually the case or not, I tend to assume the worst with politicians, and
then occasionally, very occasionally get surprised when I'm proven wrong
about them).


&gt;Do something; quit whining about hindsight and crap here.

Technically a lot of what we post about on this list falls under both
categories,
mostly hindsight, but a fair amount of crap manages to permeate a few
threads ;)


&gt;If the Labor Party DOES support Open Source the next time they get in
&gt;power I'm not going to berate them for hindsight...

Neither will I, though I'd probably berate them about a few other things :),


&gt;Our children WILL NOT live in the past; the future is waiting them.

Couldn't agree more....but learning from the past is a precursor to
successfully
living the future....although being Remembrance Day today one would have to
ask
how much we really have learned from the past....but I digress....
