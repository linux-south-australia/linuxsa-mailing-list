&gt;&gt;Here is a concrete example. According to the executives at Lindows, they 
&gt;&gt;have put about $1 Million dollars into Wine.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;However, a brand new company can go out and deliver a product that is 
&gt;&gt;just as good as Lindows, having _not paid_ the $1 Million dollars.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Not true, otherwise Lindows would not even get started. Lindows is more
&gt;than just current wine, packaged in a working distro. There's lots of
&gt;other stuff involved in creating a workable Linux/Wine distro for the
&gt;Lindows target market. That, and the ability to market to a paying target
&gt;market is what makes Lindows a saleable product.
&gt;  
&gt;
I agree that Lindows is more than just current wine packaged in a 
working distro, it was my mistake on mistating that exactly and it drew 
from the point.



&gt;If another company is going to create a Lindows rip-off, they will have to
&gt;go through a process to create it, which will cost. They will benefit from
&gt;Lindows' investment in Wine, but so does everyone else, and Lindows knew
&gt;that when they made the decision.
&gt;  
&gt;
I just find it troubling that the smart thing to do is to not create 
features that make it more accessable to people.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;But what I am saying, is that the developer should have some of his 
&gt;&gt;costs reimbursed. The only way to do that is to embed the cost in the 
&gt;&gt;license, otherwise the company.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am also saying that projects that make our software should be able to 
&gt;&gt;collect some funding if all the distributors do is download the source 
&gt;&gt;and throw a logo on a cd. If they make the product work better, no 
&gt;&gt;royalties to pay.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And given the GPL and open source culture, WHO is going to police this?
&gt;Are we going to have a FSF Software Assurance body like the BSA? How could
&gt;all the GPL software become re-licensed under a new GP (General Pay)
&gt;License without a legal quagmire emerging?
&gt;  
&gt;
Well, the condition would only be true if 10 [10 = Random Number] or 
less groups contributed to a project, so that is small enough to police. 
Once it becomes unpolicable, it would be GPL, flat out. Picking the 
threashold should be determined mostly through practicality. Maybe only 
count "significant" contributors should be counted.

I agree that having a cure to be worse than the cause would be horrible.

&gt;If you look at the Lindows case on it's own, it's simple: Lindows created
&gt;a business plan that involved projected sales of a software product that
&gt;included a more capable Wine than what was available. Part of the plan
&gt;would have been to improve Wine so that the Lindows project was
&gt;successful, and the budgeted sales achieved. 
&gt;
&gt;It's commercially true, even if it seems cruel, that if Lindows makes a
&gt;sizable error on the target market size, and it's ability to penetrate it,
&gt;or the size of investment in Wine required to deliver the required
&gt;functionality, then it will probably go broke unless it finds another
&gt;source of funds.
&gt;
&gt;I guess I would like Lindows to succeed, but I can't see the point in
&gt;mortgaging all the work that has been done by thousands of individuals to
&gt;try and create a protected developer species. Isn't that what we're trying
&gt;to get away from?
&gt;  
&gt;
The only thing I am worried about is that most, if not all of the 
software distribution companies are making the same miscalculation. It 
makes me wonder if the correct calculation can be made at all.


Thank you for bringing up these points. I am just trying to come up with 
some ideas, share them, and hopefully, ideas will be discussed, and 
answers found.

James Leone

&gt;Regards,
&gt;
