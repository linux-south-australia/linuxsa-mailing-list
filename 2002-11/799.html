&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think that it is, however, LinuxSA isn't a legal entity and has no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision structure to make media contact and so forth.
&gt;&gt;&gt; At the risk of openning yet another can of worms (I don't even *like*
&gt;&gt;&gt; worms), do people think that LinuxSA should incorporate, have elected
&gt;&gt;&gt; positions, have a membership fee and interact with the media?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I used to be ultra-opposed to such a move.  Now I'm not so sure.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, I've stated my position on this in the past, but here it is
&gt;&gt; again: I don't think that Yet Another Geek Association in this space
&gt;&gt; will do any good.  Believe me, it's a lot of work, and despite the
&gt;&gt; broader membership base, AUUG is not having an easy time of it.  Yes,
&gt;&gt; you can point to the much higher "membership" of LinuxSA, but that's
&gt;&gt; precisely because it isn't incorporated.  Ask for a membership fee and
&gt;&gt; the numbers will fall back to those of AUUG.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;out on a limb&gt;
&gt;&gt; When you look at it objectively, it doesn't really make sense to have
&gt;&gt; both AUUG and Linux organizations.  Logically, we're the same group of
&gt;&gt; people.  On the other hand, I know that a number of LinuxSA people
&gt;&gt; look on us as "opposition".  This is unfortunate, since we're all
&gt;&gt; pointing in (roughly) the same direction.  It would be nice for us to
&gt;&gt; come closer together, and I'd welcome suggestions about how to do
&gt;&gt; that.
&gt;&gt; &lt;/out on a limb&gt;
&gt;
&gt; These are good thoughts Greg - thank you for sharing them.
&gt;
&gt; I don't disagree with what you say - indeed I'm all for the
&gt; combination of effort to minimise wasteage, but I hear rumblings
&gt; that another incorporation may occur in the "SA geek space"[1]
&gt; anyways so perhaps LinuxSA should be that body.

That's an interesting statement.  Firstly, if another body (who?) is
about to incorporate, why should they stop if LinuxSA incorporates?
Why should this be a reason for LinuxSA to incorporate?

&gt; I guess you can always throw SAGE-AU and Airnet into the "SA geek
&gt; crowd" as well.  More broadly you could include AJUG, ACS, and SEA.
&gt; Why are there so many groups?!? :)

Well, taking that list, I'd say:

SAGE-AU: Not specifically UNIX oriented.  We've had a long
         relationship with them in the past, some of it good
         (especially lately), and we've come to the conclusion that
         they have a sufficiently different focus that we both need to
         be distinct entities.

Airnet: Not really sure.  Again, I suspect they don't fit completely
	into the UNIX space.

AJUG: Very specialized group.  It could theoretically be a Special
      Interest Group within AUUG, but we haven't really defined what
      that is yet.

ACS:  Different focus.  Not only UNIX, not overly technical.

&gt; [1] the reason why is another thing.  Perhaps existing groups aren't
&gt; meeting new needs.

It would seem to be a rather strong reaction to that problem.  One of
AUUG's problems has been that we've been around for ever, so to speak
(1975, to be more exact), and the world changed while we had our heads
down.  We're catching up now, but if there are needs which we can
fulfil and which aren't being addressed, we'd certainly like to know
about them.
