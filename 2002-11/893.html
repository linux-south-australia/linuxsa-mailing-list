&gt; When you look at it objectively, it doesn't really make sense to have
&gt; both AUUG and Linux organizations.  Logically, we're the same group of
&gt; people.  On the other hand, I know that a number of LinuxSA people
&gt; look on us as "opposition".  This is unfortunate, since we're all
&gt; pointing in (roughly) the same direction.  It would be nice for us to
&gt; come closer together, and I'd welcome suggestions about how to do
&gt; that.
&gt; &lt;/out on a limb&gt;

I think you answered your own question.  To join AUUG (and thereafter form a 
SIG) would cost each member of the SIG $110 pa.  I think we need some kind of 
associate membership relating to the SIG(s) only. eg becoming a member of the 
LinuxSA SIG would involve a membership fee of $25 pa, but provide all the 
advantages of AUUG backing.  Or maybe the SIG could become the AUUG member?

We do need to work together and be - and be seen (heard?) to be - speaking 
with one voice which is big enough and loud enough to be influential.
