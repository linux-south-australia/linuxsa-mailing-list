&gt; &gt; I think that by the grossly abused metric of copies shipped -- which as I

&gt; &gt; considerably fewer boxed server editions than SCO does. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I last did serious work on SCO, which was many years ago and they
&gt; might well have changed since then, you got no server software with the
&gt; desktop version of their Unix.  SCO could therefore accurately state
&gt; the number of servers they sold.  Red Hat, by contrast, provide almost
&gt; everything with their most basic edition, and so number of boxed server
&gt; editions sold is likely to significantly under estimate the number of
&gt; Red Hat servers installed.  I really can't think how to determine the
&gt; number of Red Hat servers 'out there.'

That's right, and there's a lot. All I'm saying is that articles stating
"Red Hat ships lots of server product" is probably quite wrong. They
don't, at least according to my best interpretation of the results they
publish as previously described. Which must annoy them a lot, because a
boxed server edition of SuSE or SCO Linux costs hundreds of dollars
(except for SuSE for s390, which as of a few months ago cost USD11k and
the only 64-bit SuSE alternative was marked "beta" :)
