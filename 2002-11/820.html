&gt; I don't know. I couldn't make it to the zone of totality (because the
&gt; f*****g railway company wouldn't sell me a ticket) so I only saw a
&gt; partial eclipse. It was still an incredibly strange and moving event.
&gt; Definitely not to be missed.

I'd definitely go along with that - I've had a very lucky time of it;
seeing a total in Melbourne in 1976, partials in Adelaide on 1988 and
1991, but by far in a way the best was a total in India (in the town of
Varanasi also happening to coincide with the last day of the Hindu
festival Divali) in 1995. The last was probably the same as the Melbourne
one, but I was only small in 1976. Total eclipses do really weird things
on the ground with `writhing snakes', as the Indians described it.
