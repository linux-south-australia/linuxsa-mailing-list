Sendo kills Microsoft agreement 
Correspondents in Stockholm Sweden
NOVEMBER 08, 2002 	
	
BRITISH phone manufacturer Sendo Holdings PLC said it will terminate its
software agreement with Microsoft and license software from Nokia, the
world's largest cell phone maker.

Sendo will no longer develop or sell phones with software from Microsoft and
won't bring a Windows-powered smartphone, called Sendo Z100, to market,
chief executive Hugh Brogan said. 

The color-screen handset, which US mobile-phone operator Cingular Wireless
had planned to launch this year, was to run Microsoft's Smartphone software
and feature added web browsing, email and instant messaging capabilities. 

Mr Brogan declined to elaborate on why Sendo is severing its software ties
with Microsoft but said the Nokia platform will give Sendo more flexibility
to customise phones for different operators. 

Sendo said it will license the Series 60 software platform developed by
Finnish company Nokia and will use that, along with an operating system
developed by British software maker Symbian PLC, in its smartphones, which
have personal computer-like functions.

Sendo will continue using its own software in models other than smartphones,
Mr Brogan said. 

The Sendo decision is a setback for Microsoft, which hasn't made much
progress in extending its software franchise from personal computers to
high-end mobile phones. 

Last year, Microsoft bought a minority stake in Sendo to speed development
of the Z100. Mr Brogan said he didn't see that ownership relationship
changing. 

A senior Microsoft executive said Sendo's decision was a software choice by
one manufacturer and wouldn't derail Microsoft's move into the
wireless-handset space. 

"The momentum we have on the platform overall, I don't think it's undermined
in any way," said Adam Anger, group senior manager for Microsoft's mobile
devices division for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 

He said Microsoft would continue to develop the software.
