Do the installfests have beginner talks and presentations?

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;does anyone know of any courses apart from those run by TAFE, 
&gt;which are well outside my financial and locale situation?? Pensioner living  
&gt;1 1/2 hours out of Adelaide.
&gt;=========================================
&gt;
&gt;I read : 
&gt;"Sure Linux is a program as are all operating systems, but that is for 
&gt;the geeks amongst us to preach.  Lets leave the general public with 
&gt;just enough information so they think they understand the concepts. &lt;G&gt;
&gt;
&gt;If the author had said "application" instead of "program" then we would 
&gt;have found nothing wrong with his statement but lots of users would not 
&gt;have grasped what an application was. It has taken us this long for 
&gt;them to understand what a program is! ",
&gt;=========================================
&gt;
&gt;and this prompted my Email.
&gt;Is it wise to foster a 2 level society, them and us?
&gt;I am a self taught ordinary home user (who understands the difference between 
&gt;an application, and a programme, seems they are both programmes with 
&gt;differing functions), who is only trying to become self sufficient, but seem 
&gt;to be confronted with one problem after another. I have read ( regarding 
&gt;Linux) "Try a few distributions, and find one that suits you", till now have 
&gt;tried a few and apart from Mandrake 7 have not arrived at a trouble free user 
&gt;friendly operating system. On reflection I never tried printing from that so 
&gt;can't really say it was trouble free.
&gt;
&gt;Is there anywhere running courses that will give me the necessary knowledge
&gt;to solve the problems that keep arising? I haven't got the need for a complete 
&gt;IT course which TAFE offers and includes Linux as a module, I have maybe 25 
&gt;years left . Have aquired a few books on the subject (don't learn very well 
&gt;from books), have spent many hours looking at FAQ's and Emails and am still 
&gt;in the same situation.
&gt;
&gt;If I am having these problems, there must be many others in the same 
&gt;situation, who just leave Linux alone, and put in the too hard basket.
&gt;I don't want or need to be a "geek" I have maybe 25 years so don't have the 
&gt;time :-) all I need is an operating system away from Windows that can be used 
&gt;or manipulated by me to work without my needing to become an IT pro. 
&gt;With the current Mandrake9 could run "printtool" in my sleep. Over the last 10 
&gt;months have installed, arrived at total frustration, uninstalled, 
&gt;reinstalled, and arrived at the same total frustration, disposed of half a 
&gt;box of continuous paper, etc. Have supprised myself with my patience,
&gt;didn't think I had any
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;At the moment, Linux gets used for Internet connection , Email and The Gimp, 
&gt;Windows for all the rest. 
&gt;
&gt;Please take this in the spirit it was written, I am not complaining or trying 
&gt;to put Linux in a bad light, or intending to upset anyone,I am only trying to 
&gt;put myself in the position to solve my own problems, and become self 
&gt;sufficient, where I don't have to keep asking for help, don't like anything 
&gt;to get the better of me, or too beholding to others, without becoming a 
&gt;"geek" (not that there is anything wrong with being a geek) Sorry about that. 
&gt;I have attended 2 meetings and they seem to be aimed at the higher levels, 
&gt;and go right over my head, so any info on a suitable course would be much 
&gt;appreciated if anyone knows of any.
&gt;
&gt;On your web site you ask for any suggestions for subjects for future meetings:
&gt;Have you thought of doing something for new users?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again for your time and the easing of much frustration.
&gt;I sincerely hope I didn't ruffle too many feathers, this was definitely not my 
&gt;intention. 
&gt;
&gt;Take care, and be only as good as you need to be
&gt;
&gt;Winton
