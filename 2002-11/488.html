Two ideas come to mind. These are just ideas, hopefully the experts will 
have better info. So maybe wait till they answer, I am just brainstorming...

Do you remember upgrading or changing the file system type just before 
you went on vacation? I *think* that I *might have* seen a similar error 
come up when I rebooted into SuSE Linux after formatting another Linux 
partition that was reiser before the format, but not after the format.

Does anyone think it is safe to mount the disk as a second disk in 
another Linux box with compatable hardware, mount it and then copy it 
over to the other disk?

Just some ideas to hopefull spark some thought, but I would wait for 
more answers...

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt; I am in a terrible problem: My data disk on my Linux server has gone 
&gt; bad, with approx 18 GB of data on it, and I never got round to 
&gt; installing a abckup system!  :-(  (I know: very stupid!) I never 
&gt; noticed anything before, but I went on vacation, and after returning I 
&gt; simply turned the box on again, and now I have this problem!!!
&gt;  
&gt; It gave an error on a short read (attempt to read block from 
&gt; filesystem resulted in short read while trying to open /dev/hdc1. 
&gt; Could this be a zero-length partition?) and I ran e2fsck -cc on it, 
&gt; which seems to have fixed that, however the following inode sweep 
&gt; gives so many 'bad blocks in inode XXXXX', that I am afraid that I'll 
&gt; be left with an empty disk once the check is done...
&gt;  
&gt; The majority of the 18 GB are repaceable data (internet downloads, 
&gt; MPEG and AVI movies, MP3's, etc.) but it also contained all the shared 
&gt; documents me and mi wive have, as well as all her embroidery patterns 
&gt; and most painful, the digital photographs of our 2 kids... Esp of our 
&gt; youngest we have mostly digital pictures (birth and the first days 
&gt; after!!!)
&gt;  
&gt; Those are the files I want back most dearly!!!
&gt;  
&gt; Now when I try to do e2fsck /dev/hdc1 I get 'a corruption was found in 
&gt; the superblock'
&gt; When I try e2fsck -b 8193 /dev/hdc1 It claims it is not a valid 
&gt; superblock... The same for for instance 32679, a.s.o.
&gt;  
&gt; Can anybody help me to retreive as much of my data as possible???
&gt;  
&gt; TIA & BRgds
&gt;
