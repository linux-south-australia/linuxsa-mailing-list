Yeah. The brick hitting the foot will actually experience _less_ shock
than the pen (assuming equal impact velocities) because the foot will
deform more, so the brick will be decelerating over a greater
distance.

Crumple zones? Bricks no, HDDs maybe...
&gt;...Broken foot, dented case and 2 crashed hard drives for evidence
... seems to me there are two crumple zones involved here!
(BTW this does not imply lack of sympathy for broken foot... I kicked
a dent in a brick wall once and I still get twinges)

Gun barrel acceleration figures are a bit misleading. I have seen a
long-exposure night-time photograph showing the flight of a torch bulb
and two AA cells soldered together; the assembly had been launched out
of a bit of steel pipe with a charge of home-made gunpowder without
breaking either the glass or the hot filament. I agree re shock of
dropping something on the floor, but I find the counter-intuitiveness
of the situation amusing.

That said, I have dropped HDDs on the floor (OK, wooden) and not
damaged them. Makes a big difference whether they're running or not. A
couple of inches is about the limit for a running drive.

(PS. someone from defence.gov.au confusing bullet & artillery shell...
dearie dearie me! :-) )

&gt;I think you may be confusing acceleration with force here. g has unit
&gt;(ms^-2) which gives no indication of the mass of the object. if you stop
&gt;something suddenly, irrespective of its weight/mass it will feel a
&gt;deceleration shock that is dependent solely on it velocity prior to impact
&gt;and the amount of time it took to decelerate. The force of the shock will
&gt;differ - hence the greater feeling of pain in the foot from a dropped
&gt;brick.
&gt;
&gt;BTW I would guess that shocks of ~300g would be easily acheived in low
&gt;velocity impacts because of the very short times allowed for deceleration
&gt;of a falling HDD/brick/Pen (these things don't often come equiped with
&gt;airbags or crumple zones). [0.5s to fall 2m and guess 0.01s to stop gives
&gt;acc of ~50g(rel) (impact vel of 18km/h), but a fall of much more or a more
&gt;rigid object and things rapidly increase]

&gt;&gt; &gt; Unless you have high-explosive boots, maybe you could try a warranty

&gt;&gt; Yes, but a HDD weighs a lot more than a bullet, hence it doesn't need to
&gt;&gt; be moving as fast for the same shock. Try this -
&gt;&gt; 1. raise a pen to the height of 2 m.
&gt;&gt; 2. position above foot.
&gt;&gt; 3. release pen.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; feel ok?
&gt;&gt; good.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 4. repeat from 1. with a brick.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; :)

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PS. this advise is provided with absolutely no warranty, and may
&gt;&gt; invalidate the warranty on your pen/brick/foot also :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PPS. one of our clients stored a removable HDD in a filing cabinet when
&gt;&gt; it wasn't in use. Guess what happenned when they opened the cabinet a
&gt;&gt; little quickly one day? - I would guess more than the rated shock level
&gt;&gt; was achieved at impact.
