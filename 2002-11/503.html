&gt; So, keeping in the context of this list, when looking at design what
&gt; criteria do people use when building web sites?

Personally, I try to follow best current practice. That means:

  - Pages served as HTML4 Strict[0], using no deprecated attributes or 
elements.
  - Pages styled using CSS1, and some CSS2.
  - Don't use tables for laying out your page.
  - Avoid using &lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; elements wherever possible.
  - Don't use scripting to generate intial content, nav menus, etc. Only 
use it for dynamic effect on content already there.
  - Use graphics ony when you have some graphical content to display 
(photos, diagrams) and use sound only when you have some audiable 
content to be presented. I.e. don't use gratutious sound or images.
  - Follow the WAI's guidelines[1].

There's a bunch of others, but yeah, these are the main ones.

Do this, and you'll have a web site which is fast to download, 
accessable to anyone using any browser, and (provided you have e1lt3 
graphics design sk11z) looks good in modern web broswers.

What you should be aiming for when using CSS to style a page is to be 
able to load the same page in a v1 or v2 browser and have it still 
rendered in a way that is legible, makes sense, and doesn't look too 
shabby, albeit with all of your nice colors and fonts and layout gone. 
It should allow the user of such a browser to successfully 
read/hear/feel *all* content on your site, which means it must be easily 
navigatable as well. How to achieve this is probably outside the scope 
of this document. :) See *cough* my website *cough* as an example of this.

&gt; In my Windoze environment I use HomeSite 5 for my pages and PhotoImpact
&gt; 4 for my graphics. I have Dreamweaver 3 but it is much too flashy fort
&gt; my style of work.

I'd avoid all of these products, the markup they generate sucks.

&gt; What OpenSource sofware should I be looking for now I have this second
&gt; drive running Lycoris?

Emacs. Gnotepad?

Seriously. Using a text editor is a much better way to go. The only 
thing you gain from using a tool such as DW is that it's easy to apply 
the same look to multiple documents, and change it around and have it 
apply to all documents easily. This sucks using a text editor, but that 
why you're keeping your (HTML-free) content separate from your (HTML) 
style, right? Using some sort of templating system to generate your HTML 
for sites with more than 5-10 pages[2]. It is far more work in the short 
term, but far, far less hassle on the long run.

I generally author my HTML and CSS using Emacs and test it using 
Mozilla. When I'm happy, I'll then go and check the content on browsers 
which *pretend* to understand CSS (NN4.x, IE5.x/win32) and see how 
broken it looks. If it isn't too broken, I'll leave it. If it is 
illegible, then I'll start selectively hiding or modifying the CSS 
declarations responsible so as to reduce the damage in these crappy 
browsers.

&gt; Oh, and if this isn't in Plain Text please help me set Mozzilla up so it
&gt; does what it is supposed to do

It's even format=flowed.. Woohoo! :)

[0] - There's a lot of people serving XHTML up as text/html. *Don't* do 
this, it is just plain wrong[3]. If you are going to serve XHTML, make 
sure your web server is configured to serve it as text/xml.
[1] - See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/&gt">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/&gt</A>;.
[2] - Then, if you are using a templating system of some sort, you can 
generate both XHTML and HTML versions of your pages, and use content 
negotiation to ensure modern browsers (Moz, Opera) get XHTML sent as 
text/xml and legacy browsers (IE, NN &lt;= v4) get HTML sent as text/html.
