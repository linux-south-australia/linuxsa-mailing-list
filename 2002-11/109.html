Hi Richard.

I've often thought the same thing.  My collected research is
below.  If you get a legal opinion, please do let me know
what it says.

Basic summary of court decisions:

- Shareware/freeware/click-through, etc licences have been
recognised (Trumpet v OzEmail).

- Revoking a copyright licence for which there was no
consideration (money paid to you) requires you to
give reasonable notice.  Not a huge concern, as
the GPL grants eternal rights.

- Copyright does not subsist in computer langauge
syntax (Data Access v Powerflex).

- The fair trading aspects of the Trade Practices
Act apply to software.

- The parallel importation provisions of the Copyright
Act apply to software.

- The warranty provisions of the Trade Practices Act
apply to software (Caslec v Windhover).  However most
software developed doesn't fall under the TPA as the
value of the software developed is too high to make
the purchaser a "consumer".  Thus most cases about
warranties and software are contract law cases.

There's also an interesting trade mark case, Red Hat v
Mary-Ann Martinek.  Red Hat, overreaching somewhat,
argued that all software with "person and hat" logos
was infringing and got slapped down firmly.

Some general points:

- Contracts require consideration.  If you write software
and make it freely available and receive no consideration
(payment, etc) then there is no contract.  It's uphill
from here to argue "fitness for purpose".

- The new clauses in the Copyright Act allowing reverse
engineering are untested.

I think I can see the basics of how a contract for GPL
software development would be structured.  You are a
business, they are a business, no one is a consumer,
warranties are explicitly addressed.  The aim being
to knock out those TPA clauses which can be removed
by contracts between businesses.

As far as I can see, none of this excludes using the
GPL as the copyright license.  Surprisingly a standard
off-the-shelf software development contract should suffice,
as the aims seem identical.

As for distribution to the public, I think the safest course
is to avoid asking for consideration.  No asking for postcards
or contributions to download costs.

I think it's the Linux distributors that are in the tricky
legal position.

Glen
