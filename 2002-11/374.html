&gt;Senator Lundy would be the most genuine politician I've ever met, and 
&gt;she is really switched-on when it comes to IT issues. She was in 
&gt;Adelaide last week, and could hold her own on discussions 
&gt;about Telstra internals, and offered help in dealing with them at high-up 
&gt;levels that we don't normally have access to.

Forgive my sarcasm, but I've been working in government long enough to have
come
across many upper level bureaucrats who can hold their own in discussions
about any subject you can name, including IT issues, and are always able to
help out with anything, until it comes to the crunch and political/corporate
pressure ends up forcing them to back down from their moral high ground.

Don't get me wrong here, I haven't met Senator Lundy, and it'd be great if
she is as genuine as you say, but I'm skeptical of any bureaucrats and
their willingness to do anything useful for any cause other than their own
best interest, in the same way that I'm skeptical of opposition political  
parties living up to what they promise while still in opposition.  Of
course,
I wouldn't mention any state governments in the same breath, and it cuts
both
ways, goverments who return to opposition are suddenly so much wiser than
they
were while running the state.....   


&gt;By comparison, most of her peers don't even seem to read their own 
&gt;email, try emailing the minister for IT and see if you get 
&gt;back anything besides a form letter.
