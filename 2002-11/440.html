(JL just hoping to find solutions, all IMHO...this is not intended to be 
a rebuttal of any sort...)


&gt;I am one of the norm(a)++s who may see the possibilities though.
&gt;
&gt;So why haven't I loaded some Linux software and jumped in full
&gt;bottle?
&gt;It is just too much,
&gt;

I agree that it can be a big task. Having recently experienced the 
transition,
I know what you are talking about.

For me, it is an unfortunate situation. But I am willing to take a few 
"black eyes and
blood noses" while attempting to work with other people to try to solve 
this dilemma.

I have made some progress so far, as I have been sucessful at the 
former, but
not the latter.  :-D

&gt; and I'm not hiding underneath the nearest
&gt;rock. [One of the reasons I joined the Linux SA list was to learn
&gt;what I could, in my case start learning the language (aka jargon,
&gt;but it really is technospeak and essential to master.)]
&gt;It is just too much because I do other things - currently I have
&gt;exams starting next week and I'd like to put in a submission on GE
&gt;Food before 15/11. Apart from that I am trying to get my head
&gt;around PODI* and PPML** and to research the market for on demand
&gt;book printing and capital requirements, and supporting my ageing
&gt;mother and visiting my daughter in Victoria, and maintain a house
&gt;and garden, and .. oh, yes and to earn a crust. 
&gt;
&gt;For me my computer is a tool, to send and get e-mail, to get
&gt;information, to write on.
&gt;Why am I considering open source?
&gt;I have a 486 and it is getting slower and slower, and hangs a lot
&gt;more, and although I could replace it there are other things I'd
&gt;prefer to do with my money - e.g. go see my daughter. Apart from
&gt;which as a greenie I like to make things last, and don't like to
&gt;buy things unnecessarily.
&gt;Why haven't I done it yet?
&gt;I'm nervous about doing it.
&gt;

I am glad that you are sharing this.  That way anyone that is in the 
open source community
and is interested in this can take a look at the situation and see what 
can  be done.

&gt;+   I'll have to partition my hard disc, what if I lose things?
&gt;+   I've got some favourite programs 
&gt;one End Note is perfectly legal, but it was provided to me under
&gt;an education licence and can't reload it - which means I'll have
&gt;to buy it $700 odd, 
&gt;and the other a nice little game of jigsaw puzzles which I bought
&gt;online and I'll have to go through a lot of hassles 
&gt;
When I thought about this a while back, I did something odd...I showed 
up at an installfest
without a computer. I just wanted to get a feel for disk partitioning. I 
didn't want to try it
until I could take for granted that it would work, just like I already 
took for granted the fact
that Windows would boot up.

Or, perhaps, the price of a second hard disk could also buy some peace 
of mind.

There are just ideas that I realize may not be feasible either, but I 
should try to bring
them up I guess...

&gt;+    I've been saving a lot of my emails to save the hassle of
&gt;going to archive files when I want info from 5 years back. One day
&gt;I'll find a good search engine so that I can burn them to disc and
&gt;take them off the hard drive.
&gt;+    I'll have to keep on hunting on line for things such as
&gt;drivers and fixes and stuff. I loathe internet searching and avoid
&gt;it as much as I can.
&gt;+    All the open source material  I've seen wants you to have a
&gt;pentium processor. Oh yes, there are "light" versions on the net.
&gt;After searching through an arcana of technobabble, and after
&gt;downloading for an hour and half, the system has a hernia, I get
&gt;an error message and the download is incomplete. Try again? you've
&gt;got to be kidding see previous point.
&gt;
&gt;Quite frankly it is too hard, and the fault doesn't lie with me. I
&gt;am the customer. The customer is always right. And I don't
&gt;necessarily want to get it for free#.
&gt;

Just a reflection of my experience....obviously it may not work the same 
way for everybody...


As of now, I feel that, if the Linux you own was made in the last 6 
months, than I feel that, more
often than not, that keyboards, monitors, printers floppy drives, cdroms 
and mice will work properly
after a fresh Linux installation.

I say 'safe bet' because things pop up now and then with regard to 
monitors, printers and mice,
like the mouse issue on topic.

Now if you want a webcam, PDA, sound, cdrom burning, or applications 
unique to Windows
(I know I missed some things here) then there are tricks to doing these 
things AFAIK.

***What I want to do is make as many setup scripts as I can to automate 
these recipies.
I as a private individual on my own time will do this GPL. However, if a 
company does
this I believe that they can do it faster than I can do it alone. But I 
am still going to try, and I
hope that other people, with more experience and skills than I have will 
try also.

Because the more I make, the more will be GPL. Given that, I don't 
expect a company to
make similar automations and not charge for them; the race is on...who 
will make the scripts
people need first? GPL or proprietary?

I hope that it will be GPL.


&gt;Now consider - I'm what is called an early purchaser and I still
&gt;haven't converted. Microsoft's success lies in identifying what
&gt;the customer wants, the essence of which is "plug and play". When
&gt;open source delivers plug and play, MS will go the way of Apple.

I want to thank you for bringing up this information and I hope that 
these issues will be resolved soon.

&gt;#
&gt;I think there is a right price*** for software - 
&gt;something like $70 to $100 for big software such as -an operating
&gt;system, cad/cam, and graphics ; $29.95 for packages such as
&gt;spreadsheets, word processing, slide presentations, maths (as
&gt;opposed to word) processing, music writing ; and $5 for drivers
&gt;and other things that make thingies work.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* printing on demand initiative
&gt;** personalized print mark-up language
&gt;*** there's a right price for video recordings (tape and dvd)
&gt;$14.95, music cds $11.95 and paper back books $6.95. Everything
&gt;else is overpriced. :)
&gt;
&gt;PS David did you like the formatting? :)
