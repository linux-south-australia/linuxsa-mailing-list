Just another question, there was no contract time specified but to 
cancel the contract you have to pay $507 !!!!!! so in 2 years time when 
the modem gets stolen and i dont want to continue the contract i have to 
pay $230 to return you the modem i dont have then an aditional $507 to 
exit the contract

i can even leave and take the modem to another provider cos its not 
really given to you it remains the property of adam (but to leave i 
would have to pay $507 anyway)

&gt;&gt; all i could see was setup fee (99) waived if stayed with them for 6

&gt;
&gt; That's the standard plans. Look for the bright red and yellow graphic 
&gt; on the front page of www.adam.com.au, or if you're using lynx and 
&gt; cannot see that you can go direct to 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.adam.com.au/adslspecial.htm">http://www.adam.com.au/adslspecial.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, no Linux support, no support for a computer that has two 
&gt;&gt; network cards or PCs on LANs
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; While there is no explicit linux support, there hasn't been a linux or 
&gt; BSD user yet that we havn't been able to help out. We can also help 
&gt; out with PC's on lans (the free modem is also a router after all) but 
&gt; generally an ISP can't really be expected to know how an end-user's 
&gt; network is configured!
