A thought which just occurred - comment from John or Simon maybe - Would
ISPs ever be willing to make a plan that slowed you to 56k once you hit
your limit and then sucked your usage away from next month's allowance?
I don't know how much of revenue such a stream would kill, but the user
would just be able to use his connection without fear, and the ISP would
know how much it was getting, and waht it was for.

Again, just a thought. But I think that I would pay a premium for such
($10/month maybe).

&gt; Firstly, thanks John for posting this to the list.  I am interested in finding
&gt; out more about linux friendly DSL ISP's available in Adelaide and by the
&gt; feedback on the list a lot of others are as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Could you please expand clearly on what mirrors are available from Adam and
&gt; confirm that these are Quota free?  Is there a URL to a list of resources
&gt; available on your mirrors and how often they are updated?
&gt; 
&gt; Also is there any guarantee on uptime, response time on outages?  I know your at
&gt; the mercy of Telstra for most of this but I also have experience of ISP's that
&gt; would go down constantly, and not really care because there was no uptime
&gt; warrantee for ADSL clients.
&gt; 
&gt; One other item, Optus cable kicks you down to 56k once you exceed your data
&gt; quota, I like this feature, as I don't like surprises in my bill at the end of
&gt; the month.  Is this possible with ADSL through Adam?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA,
&gt; 
&gt; Mick
