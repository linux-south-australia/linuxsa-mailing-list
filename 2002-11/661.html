&lt;rant&gt;

Why is it that Sun, with all their money, can't seem to make things
work in a sensible manner? Specifically, I'm talking about
customisability of bootup, and more specifically, setting the
hostname. I have a Sun Solaris server that gets its IP from a DHCP
server, but the DHCP server doesn't know what hostname to give it. I
don't run the DHCP server.

What the Solaris startup script (inetsvc) does is checks if DHCP is
being used (it is), and then asks DHCP what the hostname is (it gives
an empty response), setting the hostname to "unknown" if DHCP doesn't
know the hostname. It then goes and edits /etc/hosts to set the
hostname for the DHCP-given IP Address there to whatever it's decided
the hostname should be -- "unknown", in my case.

Sure, I could edit that script, changing "unknown" to the right
hostname, but what happens when I patch the machine? Yay -- Sun's
package management system overwrites the file without telling me. So
editing the script is a short term solution. Additionally, there's
actually TWO separate scripts where this is set. I can't imagine the
logic that is being used here. 

Don't get me wrong, I like some aspects of Solaris, but the basic bits
of infrastructure that I learn to take for granted on Linux, and files
that I can assume I can edit and have left unchanged after a boot, are
just different on Solaris... and yes, I'm aware that Solaris may well
have been there before Linux, and hence Linux is the different one,
but I just don't like it...

Well, it's more than that -- I don't particularly like BSD's startup
scripts, but at least they are simple, consistent, and fairly easy to
use. I happen to prefer the more complex SysV style, as long as it's
consistent and straghtforward (which it is on Debian, and to a lesser
extent, IMHO, on RedHat). Solaris' startup scripts are SysV style, but
seem to lack the functionality and structure that you need on SysV to
overcome the inherent complexity.

&lt;/rant&gt;
