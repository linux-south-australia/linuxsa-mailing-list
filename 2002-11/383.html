Ian,

&gt; yeah I agree - time to get over it - this whole 10 year long
&gt; neo-luddite anti-change protest against all but the most ultra-basic
&gt; forms of communication is a bit thin.

Should I take offence that you are accusing me of being a "neo-luddite"?

The Ludds were fabric and clothing makers who were being put out of
business and their livelihood because of the newly created industrial
weaving machines. They weren't destroying technology as such, they were
destroying that which was destroying their livelihood.

If you would care to use such overly emotional appeals such as accusing
people of "being neo-luddite" without obviously knowing the facts then I
would suggest you would also support Microsoft's often illegal, bullying
tactics to put open source out of business.

&gt; I have never known HTML to be platform specific - so what's the deal?

As usual, someone misses my point. People don't generally use it to mark
anything up. It's blatant bandwidth usage. I am at a loss as to how to
say this in easier English.

&gt; Surely even the most basic of basic text email readers can still
&gt; render HTML- unless it has been deliberately turned off as a silent
&gt; protest against change.

I'll split this up:

"Surely even the most basic of text email readers can still render HTML"

 - true unless it's been made by Outlook with font tags for every second
letter

"...it has been deliberately turned off"

 - I don't see a problem with this point BUT you insist on saying

"...as a silent protest against change."

 - it's not a silent protest at all. I've never been silent about my
dislike for HTML e-mails. You equate "good" for "change". They are not
similar and history has proven that to be so.

&gt; I'm sure the security concerns of HTML are dead easy to work around
&gt; too - so give the web site maintainers a break eh?

You go and find yourself some logical arguments, unladen with emotional
overtones that might be able to convince me that HTML e-mail is bad. All
that this has proved to me is that you are willing to have us all accept
HTML e-mail as a de facto standard based not on its technical merit but
a load of emotional blackmail about not being technology friendly.

*hmmph*
