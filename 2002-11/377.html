Hmmmm... what exactly is the problem with HTML format? Isn't that meant 
to be *the* platform independent document formatting language? It's much 
more light weight than pdf, which is a proprietary encoding (it's just 
not MS).

&gt;&gt;Thanks for your newslettter. Normally due to security reasons I do not have
&gt;&gt;html enabled by default. Thus your newsletter appears as plain text in my
&gt;&gt;inbox. Mostly this is unreadable. I am wondering if it could be sent as an
&gt;&gt;attachment. say with a plain text heading "Newsletter enclosed", or
&gt;&gt;alternatively as a pdf file ? Adobe pdf would be a good alternative as it is
&gt;&gt;Operating System neutral. Thus it will display just as well on my Linux
&gt;&gt;computer as on a Microsoft one, with the Acroread software.

&gt;Hello Brian,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your message.
&gt;Yes anything is possible, but the limiting factor is the amount of time I
&gt;can devote to converting files from one format to another.
&gt;
&gt;These short messages are the result of new products being listed on our web
&gt;site, which is compiled in MS Frontpage html format. It is a simple matter
&gt;then to copy the information and paste into a html email message.
&gt;To convert it back to plain text doesn't fulfill our requirement of giving
&gt;people a picture and hyperlinks to do something with the information. Also
&gt;to take the html file to another format where we can convert it to a pdf
&gt;file adds a considerable amount of time to the whole process.
&gt;
&gt;Your suggestion is a valid one that most people have Acrobat or similar
&gt;file readers, and we are looking at the next edition of the full newsletter
&gt;being in a pdf format (the original MS Publisher file format allows this
&gt;without adding further conversion steps in the middle)
&gt;
&gt;I trust this answers your queries.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
&gt;
