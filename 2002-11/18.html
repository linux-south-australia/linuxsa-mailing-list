Quoting squareyes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:squareye@chariot.net.au">squareye@chariot.net.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; does anyone know of any courses apart from those run by TAFE, 
&gt; which are well outside my financial and locale situation?? Pensioner living 
&gt; 
&gt; 1 1/2 hours out of Adelaide.
&gt; =========================================
&gt; 
&gt; I read : 
&gt; "Sure Linux is a program as are all operating systems, but that is for 
&gt; the geeks amongst us to preach.  Lets leave the general public with 
&gt; just enough information so they think they understand the concepts. &lt;G&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; If the author had said "application" instead of "program" then we would 
&gt; have found nothing wrong with his statement but lots of users would not 
&gt; have grasped what an application was. It has taken us this long for 
&gt; them to understand what a program is! ",
&gt; =========================================
&gt; 
&gt; and this prompted my Email.
&gt; Is it wise to foster a 2 level society, them and us?
&gt; I am a self taught ordinary home user (who understands the difference between
&gt; 
&gt; an application, and a programme, seems they are both programmes with 
&gt; differing functions), who is only trying to become self sufficient, but seem
&gt; 
&gt; to be confronted with one problem after another. I have read ( regarding 
&gt; Linux) "Try a few distributions, and find one that suits you", till now have
&gt; 
&gt; tried a few and apart from Mandrake 7 have not arrived at a trouble free user
&gt; 
&gt; friendly operating system. On reflection I never tried printing from that so
&gt; 
&gt; can't really say it was trouble free.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anywhere running courses that will give me the necessary knowledge
&gt; to solve the problems that keep arising? I haven't got the need for a
&gt; complete 
&gt; IT course which TAFE offers and includes Linux as a module, I have maybe 25 
&gt; years left . Have aquired a few books on the subject (don't learn very well 
&gt; from books), have spent many hours looking at FAQ's and Emails and am still 
&gt; in the same situation.


Don't feel too bad Winton, I have 25 years, and hopefully many more than 25 to
go, and I don't learn well from books either, have spend many hours reading FAQ
and E-mails and still feel (am?) a linux newbie.


&gt; If I am having these problems, there must be many others in the same 
&gt; situation, who just leave Linux alone, and put in the too hard basket.
&gt; I don't want or need to be a "geek" I have maybe 25 years so don't have the 
&gt; time :-) all I need is an operating system away from Windows that can be used
&gt; 
&gt; or manipulated by me to work without my needing to become an IT pro. 
&gt; With the current Mandrake9 could run "printtool" in my sleep. Over the last
&gt; 10 
&gt; months have installed, arrived at total frustration, uninstalled, 
&gt; reinstalled, and arrived at the same total frustration, disposed of half a 
&gt; box of continuous paper, etc. Have supprised myself with my patience,
&gt; didn't think I had any

Hit the nail on the head, except I discover new low limits on my patience - or
lack there of.  Broken foot, dented case and 2 crashed hard drives for evidence
- never try booting your computer this way.
 
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment, Linux gets used for Internet connection , Email and The Gimp,
&gt; 
&gt; Windows for all the rest. 
&gt; 
&gt; Please take this in the spirit it was written, I am not complaining or trying
&gt; 
&gt; to put Linux in a bad light, or intending to upset anyone,I am only trying to
&gt; 
&gt; put myself in the position to solve my own problems, and become self 
&gt; sufficient, where I don't have to keep asking for help, don't like anything 
&gt; to get the better of me, or too beholding to others, without becoming a 
&gt; "geek" (not that there is anything wrong with being a geek) Sorry about that.
&gt; 
&gt; I have attended 2 meetings and they seem to be aimed at the higher levels, 
&gt; and go right over my head, so any info on a suitable course would be much 
&gt; appreciated if anyone knows of any.
&gt; 
&gt; On your web site you ask for any suggestions for subjects for future
&gt; meetings:
&gt; Have you thought of doing something for new users?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again for your time and the easing of much frustration.
&gt; I sincerely hope I didn't ruffle too many feathers, this was definitely not
&gt; my 
&gt; intention. 
&gt; 
&gt; Take care, and be only as good as you need to be
&gt; 
&gt; Winton
&gt;  

I also have attended a couple of LinuxSA meetings and think this is a very valid
point.  While the user group meeting are a place and time for advanced users to
get together and discuss ideas way over begineers heads, and I don't want to
lower everyone down to our levels, some effort should be make to include everyone.

How about implementing some kind of Protege / apprentice systems where a
knowedgable user takes a newbie under thier wing to be a point of contact,
person to introduce us into the local linux circle of geeks =)
