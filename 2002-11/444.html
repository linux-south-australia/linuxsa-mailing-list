&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; HTML is worse than platform specific.  What you see is dependent not
&gt;&gt; only on your browser, but how you set it up.  There is as good as no
&gt;&gt; possibility that what you see on the screen is the same as what I see
&gt;&gt; on the screen.  With properly formatted plain text, or with PDF, the
&gt;&gt; discrepancies are minimal.
&gt;
&gt; I don't think that matters.  Seeing how I am virtually blind*, and
&gt; therefore forced to use a 56pt font, I only get a 26 character wide
&gt; window, so your text to me is wrapped horribly no matter what.  At
&gt; least if you sent in HTML I wouldn't get stupid short line in the
&gt; middle of sentences.

If you need such a contrived example to counter my argument, the
argument must be pretty bullet-proof.

&gt;&gt; That depends on the tools you're using.  With good tools, it would
&gt;&gt; be trivial.  But I don't know any such good tools in the HTML
&gt;&gt; space.  You'll notice that your tool also mutilated the quoted
&gt;&gt; text.
&gt;
&gt; If you could find a good tool that is available on all popular
&gt; platforms, or even in source, would you then support HTML email?

No.

&gt; Is that what it would take?

No.  That doesn't address the fact that HTML renders differently
everywhere.  Nothing except replacement can address the fact.

What I *would* support would be some other SGML-based format if:

1.  It would be relatively universally available, with usable tools.
2.  It would guarantee WYSIWIS (What you see is what I saw).
