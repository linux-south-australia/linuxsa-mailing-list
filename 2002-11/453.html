&gt;At the end of the day, it's also agreed that HTML as a markup language
&gt;is pretty poor; it confuses presentation with content, so using something
&gt;so "90's" would be a pretty poor decision too, wouldn't you agree?
&gt;
To make matters worse, they teach eight-year-olds that style is more
important than content. Some programme on late-night TV I saw, they
were getting these eight-year-olds to write a web page. Some teacher
who should be shot: "Ah yes, 'Doggies' for a title. Very good. But
it's a bit boring, isn't it? Can't you make it a bit more colourful?
Use a more interesting font? etc. etc." AARGH! Ten years later we have
someone writing web pages & HTML emails for some company, who's been
programmed to think that a 3k GIF of 'Doggies' in some fancy script is
always preferable to 'Doggies' as 7 bytes of text.

This thread should be (censored and) sent to IT teachers everywhere..?

&gt;Tell us more, will you share the design.

&gt;Martin L.

Problem: Many car drivers assume that the laws of physics do not
permit a collision between a car and a bicycle. Cyclists know from
experience that this is not the case.

Proposed solution: Remotely disable their engine management systems to
reduce approach speed and facilitate collision avoidance.

Proposed method: Magnetron (probably ex-microwave-oven) or bank
thereof feeding suitable steerable horn aerial, driven by pulsed power
source, eg:
1) Big flywheel spun up from bike wheel, coupled to generator to whose
output the magnetron bank presents a low impedance
2) Magnet propelled through coil by explosive charge
3) Charged capacitor whose plates are separated by explosive charge
4) High velocity plasma jet fired between two electrodes perpendicular
to a strong magnetic field, produced by burning butane/air mixture

(1) and (2) have had some military testing I believe, probably in
connection with rail guns.

The practicality of all the possible options needs some work.
