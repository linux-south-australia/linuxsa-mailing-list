During the very first part of the boot routine hit stop-A to get into
OBP.
With 'printenv' you'll probably find that 'boot-device' is set to 'net'
Change it using 'setenv boot-device disk' 
If that doesn't work refer to Open Boot PROM Commands at

<A HREF="http://lios.apana.org.au/~cdewick/sunshack/data/sh/1.0/wcd00007/wcd007e2.htm">http://lios.apana.org.au/~cdewick/sunshack/data/sh/1.0/wcd00007/wcd007e2.htm</A>

Examples are given and it's a great reference.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, it's off-topic, but hey.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem is that somehow, the OpenPROM on a brand spanking new
&gt; StarFire V100 [1] has decided to start booting from the net rather
&gt; than the disk as its default. I certainly didn't do that (at least, I
&gt; don't recall doing it, and I usually recall doing this kind of thing).
&gt; Does anyone recall how to change it back? I've browsed various bits of
&gt; doco, but can't find anything clear, and while OpenPROM is a great
&gt; idea, I always find it a little klutzy to use (or is it just that I am
&gt; a little klutzy when I use it).
&gt; 
&gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; [1] (By the way, the new SunFire V100, which is an updated Netra X1,
&gt; is great value for Sun gear. $2000 ish with an UltraSPARC IIe 550MHz,
&gt; 256Mb RAM, 20GB IDE HDD, 1U Rackmount, LOM[2] and all. Sure, it's low
&gt; specc'd when compared to PC gear, but it's a real Sun, and will run
&gt; either Solaris or Linux -- though possibly not with LOM and the
&gt; Watchdog.)
&gt; 
&gt; [2] LOM is the best thing since Ethernet. It's Lights Out Management,
&gt; and means you can do _everything_ without touching the machine. Turn
&gt; power off _AND_ on, check temperature, turn the Fault LED on and off
&gt; -- everything except physically unplug the machine. It even has a
&gt; built-in watchdog timer. PCs REALLY need this -- but it would be nice
&gt; (though potentially impossible) if it were accessible via IP rather
&gt; than RS232.
