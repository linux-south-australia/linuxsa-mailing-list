Ah thanks.  at the moment with win2k / xp i can use TCP printing and print
to the ip address but still gotta find drivers which is the advantage of a
print server it dishes out the drivers for you when you connect.  , and
win95 98 doesn't support tcp printing (as in i've never got it working) very
nicely.
regards
Matthew

A little, yes :-)

&gt; or whatever as a 'anonymous' print server?  we have visitors that get
&gt; DHCP/WINS etc etc which is all good but if they want to print i have to
&gt; create a user on our winnt domain (yes we are still using winnt as our
print
&gt; server,  it's on my todo list to get a linux one happening)...

You could always try using a protocol other than SMB/CIFS. Windows NT has
*very* basic support for LPR/LPD through the 'Microsoft TCP/IP Printing'
service that you can install through the network control panel. That will do
what you want (by the sounds of things) and will be tied to the particular
machine, as opposed to SMB/CIFS printers, which aren't seen as local
printers
and tend to follow people around the network. Bad Printer! Stay Boy! Play
Dead!

If you find you do want to use SMB/CIFS, you could always try allowing the
guest user to print and by mapping the guest user to a generic unix userid
(such as nobody). Have a look at the smb.conf man page and the Samba
documentation. In particular any smb.conf options that refer to either
printing or the guest user.

Hope it helps,
Matt
