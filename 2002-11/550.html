Well, here goes.

I had a setup that has worked for the past two months but for a reason I
don't understand it fell flat on its face some time last night. Here's how
I receive my e-mail:

1) someone sends it to <A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>

2) I get my BSD box to fetchmail it, pop3 to gw.david.net.au
 - I don't own the david.net.au domain
 - My local name server intercepts all queries for it and resolves it to
   10.0.0.99 = gw
   10.0.0.100 = linux

3) I then use fetchmail from linux.david.net.au with pop3

4) I then take it off the pop server on my local linux box

(I have this extra step because I can't get damned spamassassin to build
on my BSD box, and yes, I know, it's in the ports collection but I've got
other things to worry about)

This has worked for thousands upon thousands of messages. Literally.

Suddenly last night it gives up the ghost and goes:

(the crux of the problem is...) :-

  553 5.3.5 localhost.david.net.au. config error: mail loops back to me \
  (MX problem?) 
  554 5.3.5 &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@localhost">lloy0076@localhost</A>&gt;... Local configuration erro

Huh?

After some investigation, it appeared to me that the most likely reason
that this was occuring was because either gw (.99) or linux (.100) had
decided that it had no idea who to send the mail to.

Now, I forget to mention I have some rather black magic going with the
name "localhost.david.net.au". gw, which is also my local authoritave name
server for .david.net.au, happens to say that is "10.0.0.100". This is
primarily because there are various *things* on my linux (.100) that
insist on appending ".david.net.au" onto "localhost" but then not looking
at /etc/hosts.

I wouldn't have the faintest idea WHY, but them's the breaks.

However, everything on gw (.99) happens to behave itself, so it's
/etc/hosts points localhost.david.net.au to 127.0.0.1 whilst the name
server points it at 10.0.0.100.

Don't ask -- it works for me.

Having trolled google for the particular errors (the 553 specifically) it
seemed I needed to add a few FQDN to /etc/mail/local-host-names. I first
tried adding:

localhost
localhost.david.net.au

[ I could SWEAR I added them when I first set it up ]

...to no avail. I then concluded that my BSD setup had gotten itself
confused (for some reason). I then proceeded to add that to its
/etc/mail/local-host-names and VOILA...it worked.

I think that my mail delivery worked before simply because I fluked it and
the sendmail on the BSD box just sorta decided "Oh, I'll deliver THAT
locally anyway". But I'm not sure...

I'm sort of like 400 messages short, which is way annoying because I have
NO idea who has been saying what to me.

BTW, I'm not really asking any particular questions--I understand (at
least enough to have fixed the problem) what the problem was--but if
anyone can see anything that would just suddenly trip up a perfectly
working system and make it go and fall over seemingly by itself it would
be useful to know...
