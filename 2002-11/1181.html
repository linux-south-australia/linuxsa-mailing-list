&gt; So which bit explains why you don't have an earth? You only seemed to
&gt; cover the differences in the systems. Or did I miss something?

Roughly.  The Neutral is earthed at the power station, on one side
of the generators' windings.  The other side of the generators'
windings is the Active.  Generators actually have three windings,
leading to one shared Neutral and three Actives, thus the phrase
"three phase power".

The potential of the earth varies by location -- depending
upon altitude, soil, wind, solar radiation, etc.  You get
differing potentials even within sites -- the section of Adelaide
Uni at North Terrace has a differing earth potential to the
section of Adelaide Uni by the river as the soil moisture
content and the heights are different.

[ This is the reason for a Neutral wire at all.  If we used
   a Active and a local Earth we wouldn't have a stable
   potential difference (called a "voltage") and designing
   electrical devices would become very tricky.  Some
   older power lines to farm have a local Neutral, these
   are notorious for frying attached computers.
]

So if you touch the Neutral at the power station you should
not in theory be shocked, as there is no potential difference
between your hand and your feet.  (I wouldn't test this theory,
as an experimental error of 1% of 40,000 volts would still be
deadly).

If you touch the Neutral somewhere else then the potential
difference between the earth potential at the power station
and the earth potential at your feet will flow through
your body.  That Neutral might also be temporarily very
high above the local earth potential -- imagine power lines
on a mountain in storm clouds.

Now why the Earth wire?  Well we need to connect a metallic
chassis to something.  We certainly don't want to connect
it to the Active.  Given the discussion above connecting it
to the Neutral might also shock us every time we pick it up.
We could connect it to nothing (technically called a "floating
chassis").

Connecting the chassis to nothing sucks if the Active or
Neutral comes in contact with the chassis.

What we really want to do is to have the chassis at the
local earth potential.  Then no current will flow from
the chassis, through the person's hand, through their feet,
and to the earth.

So let's add another pin and connect it to the local earth.
Then the chassis can be wired to that pin.

Now let's have a cabling fault.  Power flows from the
faulty Active or Neutral connection which touches the
chassis, through the chassis to the chassis/Earth connection,
through the Earth wire and to the stake outside your house.
Now if we pick the unit up our body's electrical resistance
makes the Earth stake still the preferred route for most
of the current.  So we only get a minor jolt or tingle.
Not something to be relied upon too heavily (if the Active
wire has become disconnected can the Earth wire be far
behind?) but worth the cost.  Well we think so, practice
in the USA varies.

Earthing the chassis brings some other benefits.  Firstly,
it ameliorates the lightning problem.  Secondly, it allows
a measure of RF shielding.  Thirdly, it allows the detection
of some deadly device faults.  Fourthly, it stops the chassis
altering potenital with every raindrop.
