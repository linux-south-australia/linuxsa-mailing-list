&gt;&gt; Is anyone planning on going to see the total solar eclipse on December

There was one in August 1999, visible from the southern extremities of
the UK and the north coast of France, and most of central Europe.
Don't miss it. And don't forget that ANYWHERE within the zone of
totality will do, preferably somewhere isolated, without ice cream.

DIY eyeshade test: if you can only just see a 100W incandescent bulb
through it at a few inches range it's probably OK. Arc welding shades
are good. Sunglasses are useless. Multiple layers of thoroughly
exposed black-and-white film (not colour) are OK (eg. black bits of
X-ray photos). Smoked glass is awkward, messy, uneven, hard to get
dark enough and generally an option of last resort.

Photography: you need a tracking mount to photograph totality. You
also stand quite a good chance of melting holes in your shutter when
setting it up if you're not careful.

&gt;I think I'm going to be busy doing my hair, or something. However, I 
&gt;hear you can simulate the whole eclipse+major-tourist-attraction 
&gt;extravaganza by sticking your head in a bucket for a few minutes during 
&gt;the evening, running several hundred dollars through a shredder and 
&gt;calling and talking to someone at 1900-mystic.

See "The Modern Parents" in the appropriate issue of Viz. (Does Viz
make it to Australia?) If I get my hands on a copy I'll scan it in and
email it to anyone interested enough to ask me.

&gt;What's the whole attraction of this thing anyway? The Sun goes away 
&gt;every evening, and no-one gets all worked up about it.

I don't know. I couldn't make it to the zone of totality (because the
f*****g railway company wouldn't sell me a ticket) so I only saw a
partial eclipse. It was still an incredibly strange and moving event.
Definitely not to be missed.
