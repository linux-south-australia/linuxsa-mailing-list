&gt; Couple of suggestions:

I'm not sure either of those will really help Matthew, since his problem
apparently is that the userland process can't run soon or often enough
during "peak" times.  I presume you are adding instrumentation to the
kernel, perhaps as simple as (syscall, time, pid), and I also presume
your problem is that occasionally you get mad bursts of activity such
that your fixed size buffer overflows before the user process can be
scheduled to flush it.  Obviously you could have a bigger buffer, but
then there's still no guarantee that it's big enough, and you get the
added disadvantage of tying up even more kernel memory.  Probably the
solution would be to use a chain of modest sized buffers.  When your
current pool is full you add another block to the chain, and when a
block has been flushed you release it.  Note, however, that this can
badly fragment kernel memory, leaving you with lots of available memory
but all chopped up into little, dis-contiguous pieces.  Were it me, I'd
assume the user process will empty the buffer at opportune moments, and
thus release all blocks only when they are empty, or maybe move the
unflushed bit at the end of the last block into the first block when
that unflushed bit is small enough.

I know that copying buffers is not efficient, but I'd argue that the
"correct" unix way to implement this sort of instrumentation is as a
file.  Data is gathered when the file is open (for reading), and the
reader blocks (assuming blocking i/o) until there's some data available
to read.  I guess you could use ioctl to pass a user buffer instead, and
collected data could be written directly into that, but somehow that
seems less elegant than a simple device file.
