<H1>PHP -&gt; Printing Cards?</H1>

Hiya.

I'm in the middle of some contract dev work - part of it involves 
printing up login "cards" for an Internet Cafe, business card sized.  
The web interface for doing this is written in PHP.

Previously I had just made a subroutine which made a HTML page in a new 
window - basically just 2x4 cards in a table, which you'd print through 
your browser.

This is kind of a horrible solution though - because instead of all the 
cards nicely on the page, you'd often get one card printed on half of 
one page and the other half on the other.  HTML isn't exactly the best 
way to do this, either.

What would be really cool is being able to output to another printable 
format which properly formatted everything nicely on each page, where I 
can send this as a printjob.

Not sure if I can output to PDF or another format, I'm kind of lost to 
a solution to this.

Anybody had experiences with this kind of thing in PHP?  Thoughts, 
ideas?

Thanks

R
