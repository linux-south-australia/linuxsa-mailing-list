Sorry. Totally disagree. The vast majority of home internet
connections are via dialup and are therefore too slow for anything but
text.

I tell my browser not to load images as this is the only way to get
most web pages to download in anything like a reasonable time. Stupid
webmasters who think that it's a good idea to turn 10 bytes of text
into a 3k gif image of the same text written in some stupid font, fail
to provide text placeholders, and quite often have no actual text text
on the webpage at all, are making their servers a target for my
portable bicycle-mounted EMP weapon (under development).

Corporate webpages are especially bad in this respect. Stupid
companies pay some obscene amount of money to some "image consultant"
(euphemism for "total parasite") to design a "new corporate image",
fail to realise that the general public don't give a flying f*** about
their "corporate image", and try and force it down your throat by
making their website illegible unless you load images.

It _is_ possible to write html documents which are not that bloated
compared to the original text. Just cut out all the fancy rubbish. A
few links don't bloat it that much. When browsing the net, images can
be ignored. For email purposes, the images could be sent as a separate
message with a subject of (say) "Re: whatevertheprimarymessageisabout:
Images". People who don't want them can then set up a rule to filter
them out.

&gt;Is it really a matter of bandwidth? I can't see that... I mean from a 
&gt;group of people who download entire operating systems over the internet, 
&gt;surely some html tags, which are text anyway aren't a significant 
&gt;burden. I'd rather get a message in html than in pdf or postscript or 
&gt;some other binary format.

It's a matter of _necessary_ bandwidth use. I've just downloaded the
latest X, which is about 60Mb and took several hours. But that's 60Mb
I decided I wanted. Downloading 60kb of html which comes down to maybe
1 or 2 kb of actual text means I've just waited and paid to download
58-59kb of shite. Most people don't like paying for shite. It is
unfortunate that most home internet users don't understand the
technology well enough to realise how much of it is shite. (Remember
this was originally about a 4WD club newsletter, not something
specifically for computer-savvy people.)

When I go to a fish'n'chip shop and buy a bag of chips, do I also have
to pay for a shopping trolley full of videocassettes documenting every
minute of the life of the potatoes from seed to fryer? And shove it
all the way home? Course not.

Sorry for the rant, but I am sick and tired of having to pay to
download loads of rubbish that I don't want along with the information
I do want.
