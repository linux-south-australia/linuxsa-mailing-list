just speaking of the CFS media releases, the CFS is currently
issuing around 2 a day I'd say, here's one I just got.
As Matthew said, shorter is better, this one is actually
quite long compared to the normal CFS ones.
What's the bet the iced coffee mention appears in the
Advertiser sometime soon:

Location : NSW
Incident Type : BUSHFIRE UPDATE

Description : NSW BUSHFIRE UPDATE

SA firefighters are continuing back-burning operations to protect homes in the path of the 52,000ha Bola Ranges fire in New South Wales.

The operations have focused on the western boundary of the fire to stop it spreading from Yengo National Park into Wollemi National Park, and on toward more populated areas.

SA crews have also conducted burn-offs to clear fuel surrounding properties directly in the path of the fire.

The Bola Ranges fire was started by a lightning strike on October 5, and its perimeter currently measures about 300km.

Firefighters are expecting stronger south-easterly winds of 30km/h to arrive later this afternoon.

Firefighters in the second deployment  which left Adelaide Airport today  will take to the fireground tomorrow, allowing members of the original deployment to return to Adelaide.

Meanwhile, exhausted firefighters resting at their base camp at Singleton Barracks have welcomed a delivery of Farmers Union Iced Coffee.

The truck-load of flavoured milk arrived at the base at about 10am.

The decision to kindly donate the iced coffee was made by Pura Milk shortly after SA firefighters arrived in New South Wales.

Further information about the NSW situation can be found at www.cfs.org.au/nsw.
