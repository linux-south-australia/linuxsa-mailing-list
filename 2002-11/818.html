&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Here's some rough code I made up for someone one time to do just that. 
&gt; This
&gt; will use a TIFF file as a background image for a business card, and 
&gt; put it
&gt; on a page with crop marks for easy cutting. Should be easy to modify 
&gt; to do
&gt; what you want, but getting pdflib installed will be the hardest part!


Ack, sorry for the delay in the response guys, been away all weekend up 
at the Bathurst 24hr race, only just woke up...

John - whoa, that's really cool, *exactly* the kind of thing I was 
looking for.  I'll play with this later tonight, thanks muchly ;-)  
Sample code should make the job nice and easy - and I've already had 
the cards drawn up in Adobe Photoshop, which does export to TIFF.  What 
size in pixels was your TIFF file? (in fact, do you still have the one 
you used?  Would make modelling my own easier.)

I assume (s/assume/hope/) this is what you're talking about John?  
Although, this links to <A HREF="http://www.pdflib.com/">http://www.pdflib.com/</A> (no source code/binaries 
on the sf page), and this is mentioned on the page:

&lt;snip&gt;
PDFlib licensing information
Purchasing PDFlib
A commercial PDFlib license is required for all uses of the software 
which are not explicitly covered by the Aladdin Free Public License 
(see bottom), for example:
• shipping a commercial product which contains PDFlib
• distributing (free or commercial) software based on PDFlib when the 
source code is not made available
&lt;/snip&gt;

I'm going to use it anyway though &lt;g&gt;.

Dave/James - I'm looking at more of a way to automate this, the less 
work done for the "administrator" who's printing these cards, the 
better.  The workstations are only windows machines, so having the 
pages coming up as PDF's in a web browser should make printing easy 
(PDF's mean that each page comes out as each page, and the user can 
just click "print").

Thanks anyhow, looks interesting - I'll look into this in my spare 
time.  Plan on selling this product (internet cafe management suite) 
commercially (with a GPL'ed "lite" version to give back to the 
community - anybody interested in being a tester/developer, give me a 
yell) eventually.  Just sh!ts me how all the net-cafe solutions these 
days are all Windows based, and they're not all that capable ;-(

For sure - if John's code works, I'll use this for now just for the 
sake of completing this contract, but always looking at better ways of 
doing it ;-)

Thankyou to everybody for the responses.

Just on the argument previously about HTML email - can't remember if 
somebody mentioned this, but rendering time is a big thing with me - 
I've got over 600 emails in my inbox from not checking throughout the 
weekend, and even though I can quickly skip through the plain text 
emails with Apple Mail, the HTML ones take a few seconds to render - 
and it certainly is getting annoying quickly :-(
