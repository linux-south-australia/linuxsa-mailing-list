&gt;&gt; If 55W is all you need, you might even be able to get away with simply
&gt;&gt; disconnecting the fan altogether. Run the computer on the bench for a
&gt;&gt; while, with the lid unscrewed from the PSU but still in place. Then
&gt;&gt; ***UNPLUG IT FROM THE MAINS***, lift off the PSU lid and feel the
&gt;&gt; heatsinks. If you can keep your finger on them comfortably it's
&gt;&gt; probably OK.
&gt;
&gt;Make sure you only touch things that aren't supposed to be live --
&gt;heatsinks only, not windings or anything else -- as many (all?) PSUs
&gt;have capacitors in them that can hold a significant charge, which
&gt;while it's unlikely to kill you, will at least make you feel funny...
&gt;
&gt;rr

It is all. But if the PSU is working, and has a load on, when you
unplug it from the mains, most of the energy in the reservoir
capacitors goes into the computer's dying gasp, and they are left with
only around 10-20V on them, which is safe.

If the PSU is KNACKERED, it has no way to dump the energy in the
reservoir capacitor, which is left with 300V or so on it. This can
cause some lovely bangs and muscular convulsions. If I'm mucking about
with a PSU I solder a discharge resistor across the reservoir to make
sure. But we're not talking about a knackered PSU here.

It seems to be true of all switched-mode PSUs that I've ever dealt
with, not just computer ones, that if they are working and loaded, the
reservoirs don't retain a dangerous charge. If they are unloaded, or
faulty, then watch out.

The other reason I said UNPLUG FROM THE MAINS is that the heatsinks
often _are_ live when it is plugged in. Because of the bridge
rectifier, everything on the primary side, even the "0V" rail, is
"live" with respect to earth. The heatsinks are often "grounded" by
connection to this 0V line. As far as the circuitry of the primary
side is concerned, they are grounded, but as far as your finger is
concerned, they're not. Really crap PSUs have heatsinks which are
connected to the collector or drain of the switching transistor via
its metal mounting tab, which puts kilovolt spikes on the heatsink.
Fortunately this is not common these days.
