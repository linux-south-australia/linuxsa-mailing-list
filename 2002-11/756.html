I think that is a great idea.  :-)

The best thing you can do is write down what you know.

There are a lot of recipies out there, and you might try a lot, and 
after a while, you might become a chef!

I am glad the printer is working now!

&gt;Hi all, 
&gt;Solution to my printer not working was as easy as formatting and re-installing 
&gt;Mandrake 9. Don't understand why, but now it works.
&gt;
&gt;Being in the position of being a rank beginner ( some say very rank) I would 
&gt;like to do something to help others in my position.
&gt;I have access to 20 meg of web space, and would like to know what everyone 
&gt;thinks to putting all the resources available to us in one place, in some 
&gt;sort of organized manner. Links to the mandrake site, freebsd, debian, red 
&gt;hat.
&gt;Tutorials on "common" problems etc. ( Can picture a nice high resolution 
&gt;background of penguins, background to remain still with the text scrolling 
&gt;over it, beethoven's 5th as a background sound, and maybe a small video 
&gt;playing top left. May even get a few more onto broadband:-) except me that 
&gt;is. Come back when you are using Mozilla would be a nice touch :-) 
&gt;Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt;Take care
&gt;
&gt;Winton
