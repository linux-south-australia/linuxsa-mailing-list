&gt; Buyer: "Can't you see that everyone is buying station wagons?"

&gt; 
&gt; The article is very lengthy, but it is well written and includes some
&gt; stuff I rarely see elsewhere.  Like a description of the frustration in
&gt; trying to find support information at www.microsoft.com (e.g. bad
&gt; hyperlinks, search engine dies, etc).  There are times when I think
&gt; from the lack of general outrage about the lousy quality of many web
&gt; sites, vendor support, etc that I must be alone in  the continual
&gt; problems I experience with that junk.

General Motors doesn't have a telephone "help line" for people who don't
know how to drive, because people don't buy cars like they buy
computers. But just imiagine if they did....

A CALL FROM A MOBILE PHONE!

HELPLINE:  "General Motors Helpline, how can I help you?"
CUSTOMER:  "Hi! I just bought my first car, and I chose your car because
it had automatic transmission, cruise control, power steering, power
brakes, power door locks, and airbags."
HELPLINE:  "Thanks for buying our car. How can I help you?"
CUSTOMER:  "How do I work it?"
HELPLINE:  "Do you know how to drive?"
CUSTOMER"  "Do I know how to what?"
HELPLINE:  "Do you know how to DRIVE?"
CUSTOMER:  "I'm not a technical person! I just want to go places in my
car!"
HELPLINE:  "Well, how can I help you?"
CUSTOMER:  "I got in my car and closed the door and nothing happened."
HELPLINE:  "Did you put the key in the ignition slot and turn it?"
CUSTOMER:  "What's an ignition?"
HELPLINE:  "It's a starter motor that draws current from your battery
and turns over your engine."
CUSTOMER:  "Ignition? Motor? Battery? Engine? How come I have to know
all these technical terms just to use my car?"
&lt;pause&gt;
CUSTOMER:  "My car ran fine for a week, and now it wont go anywhere!"
HELPLINE:  "Is the gastank empty?"
CUSTOMER:  "Huh? How do I know?"
HELPLINE:  "There's a little gauge on the front panel, with a needle,
and markings from 'E' to 'F'. Where is the needle pointing?"
CUSTOMER:  "It's pointing to 'E'. What does that mean?"
HELPLINE:  "It means that you have to visit a gasoline vendor, and
purchase some more gasoline. You can install it yourself, or pay the
vendor to install it for you."
CUSTOMER:  "What? I paid $12,000 for this car! Now you tell me that I
have to keep buying more components? I want a car that comes with
everything built in!"
HELPLINE:  "The owners handbook contains the operational instructions
and maintenence requirements."
CUSTOMER:  "Your cars suck!"
HELPLINE:  "What's wrong?"
CUSTOMER:  "It crashed! That's what's wrong!"
HELPLINE:  "What were you doing?"
CUSTOMER:  "I wanted to go faster, so I pushed the accelerator pedal all
the way to the floor. It worked for awhile, but then things went wrong,
and then it crashed! And now it wont start!"
HELPLINE:  "It's your responsibility if you misuse the product. What do
you expect us to do about it?"
CUSTOMER:  "I want you to send me one of the latest versions that
doesn't crash anymore!"
HELPLINE:  "Good luck with that."

END CALL
