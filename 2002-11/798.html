&gt; &gt;&gt; I think that it is, however, LinuxSA isn't a legal entity and has no
&gt; &gt;&gt; decision structure to make media contact and so forth.
&gt; &gt; At the risk of openning yet another can of worms (I don't even *like*
&gt; &gt; worms), do people think that LinuxSA should incorporate, have elected
&gt; &gt; positions, have a membership fee and interact with the media?
&gt; &gt; I used to be ultra-opposed to such a move.  Now I'm not so sure.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I've stated my position on this in the past, but here it is
&gt; again: I don't think that Yet Another Geek Association in this space
&gt; will do any good.  Believe me, it's a lot of work, and despite the
&gt; broader membership base, AUUG is not having an easy time of it.  Yes,
&gt; you can point to the much higher "membership" of LinuxSA, but that's
&gt; precisely because it isn't incorporated.  Ask for a membership fee and
&gt; the numbers will fall back to those of AUUG.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;out on a limb&gt;
&gt; When you look at it objectively, it doesn't really make sense to have
&gt; both AUUG and Linux organizations.  Logically, we're the same group of
&gt; people.  On the other hand, I know that a number of LinuxSA people
&gt; look on us as "opposition".  This is unfortunate, since we're all
&gt; pointing in (roughly) the same direction.  It would be nice for us to
&gt; come closer together, and I'd welcome suggestions about how to do
&gt; that.
&gt; &lt;/out on a limb&gt;

These are good thoughts Greg - thank you for sharing them.

I don't disagree with what you say - indeed I'm all for the combination of 
effort to minimise wasteage, but I hear rumblings that another incorporation 
may occur in the "SA geek space"[1] anyways so perhaps LinuxSA should be that 
body.

I guess you can always throw SAGE-AU and Airnet into the "SA geek crowd" as 
well.  More broadly you could include AJUG, ACS, and SEA.  Why are there so 
many groups?!? :)

[1] the reason why is another thing.  Perhaps existing groups aren't meeting 
new needs.
