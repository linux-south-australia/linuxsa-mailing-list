I agree with David.  $100 million to charity is huge by any normal persons
standards.  that's too many zeros for me to even count.   and the article at
the end kinda backs off and says
mumblemumblewerenotcomplainingaboutthe100millionwejusttryingtowritecontrover
syasusual.  interesting that he quotes the from the bible i thought.

Dan,

Then perhaps he should take back all the $100 million and keep
the personal fortune himself. It's beyond reasonable doubt that he could
give more, just as it's beyond reasonable doubt that each and every one
of us could give more.

However, let me take a pragmatic point of view here.

If, just by chance, this $100 million saves the life of just one single
Indian person whom I'll never meet and if, just by chance, this $100
million relieves the suffering of just one Indian person whom I'll never
meet then I'm quite willing, in this case, to ignore personal and
business motives and look at human issues.

I wonder, I just wonder, how many of us here actually know what HIV can
do and does do to people.
