&gt; I'd say ComputerBank, LinuxSA, & most people in research to name a few are very
&gt; different.

I think I sent that off-list, actually.

Just saying that media is no different to software, mining,
government, etc etc etc. There are exceptions, but even within those
exceptions, we find individuals who are greedy, lazy and have to be
bought.

I don't condone it, I'm not indifferent, I do feel somewhat powerless,
and I'm not innocent of it myself...

&gt; &gt; A biological Australian Research Society has an annual national science
&gt; &gt; research week.  The committee manages to gets limited media coverage by
&gt; &gt; writting the articles for the journalists, 'plying them with good food &
&gt; wine,
&gt; &gt; and using every personal contact anyone has.  We hit the papers, radio &
&gt; &gt; television in a well co-ordinated manner using hired PR consults.  We even
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; captains of industry, politicians & one year the Australian Noble Laureat to
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; dinner. 
&gt; &gt; Solomon Lew seems to have the budget for it.

&gt; &gt; Hi.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Largely seems to come down to whether the organisers are 'in' with the
&gt; &gt; media. Remember the Jazz festival down at Glenelg a couple of weekends
&gt; &gt; ago? I knew it was on, and bought the Saturday 'tiser to see who was
&gt; &gt; playing. What did I find? One tiny paid ad in the what's on section! You
&gt; &gt; wouldn't find it if you weren't specifically looking for it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is lots of stuff 'on' in Adelaide, but it beats me how anyone finds
&gt; &gt; out about it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Michael

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree... I couldn't believe that such an event occurred in Adelaide
&gt; &gt; &gt; and I didn't notice!
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not a big TV viewer, but I read the Australian and Advertiser
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday. Was there even an ad in the papers?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ian,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You could say that most of the people stayed away in droves. How to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get a good profile for such an event?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I haven't seen any advertising for it at all apart from on LinuxSA...and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I watch a little TV, read a little newspapers...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *hmmm*
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
