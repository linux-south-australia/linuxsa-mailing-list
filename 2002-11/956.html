&gt; I tried to upgrade a 7.3 box to 8 and it kept hanging just after hardware
&gt; detection... I disabled hardware detection and it still hung, I just gave up
&gt; and left the box as 7.3.

Sounds like it would have done that even it was a fresh install. My
projector sends invalid info about itself, which RH8 was the first
distro to actually even probe for on installation, so it was the first
distro that had problems with it. I had to wait for the probe then pull
the vga cable out so it just used default values, and then plug it back
in and it got past that point. In the end the vesa driver turned out to
be a bit unstable anyway, and I did a text mode install.... then tweaked
the installed OS to use the real nvidia drivers (its a geforce 4 which
wasnt supported out the box, hence the vesa, even after install). After
installing the real nvidia stuff (and sorting out some other hardware
issues that showed up under windows and linux, (eg pulling out the 80mhz
ram simm that was flakey at 133mhz :) )) it was fine...
