Yep. Part of the module is auditing certain system calls.

Yep. If I wanted the kernel to swallow all available memory, I'd port mozilla
to kernel land :-P

&gt; solution would be to use a chain of modest sized buffers.  When your
&gt; current pool is full you add another block to the chain, and when a
&gt; block has been flushed you release it.  Note, however, that this can
&gt; badly fragment kernel memory, leaving you with lots of available memory
&gt; but all chopped up into little, dis-contiguous pieces.  Were it me, I'd
&gt; assume the user process will empty the buffer at opportune moments, and
&gt; thus release all blocks only when they are empty, or maybe move the
&gt; unflushed bit at the end of the last block into the first block when
&gt; that unflushed bit is small enough.

This is on the list of things to consider, but I had thought of it before and
seems a little painful.

thx,
Matt
