&gt;I haven't been following Lindows too closely but now that it;s out I
&gt;thought I'd have a look at the site.
&gt;
&gt;From all the fuss it appears to be yet another distro (slick for sure) but
&gt;nothing special and a distro with Wine is all people will get I think.
&gt;
&gt;It's inability (or failure from the site) to support MS based apps beyond
&gt;what various Wine derivatives is disappointing. 
&gt;
&gt;Anyone actually used it?
&gt;
Poor old me.   :-D  I am an "insider" ewwwww... Yeah, whatever.


I can give Lindows a few plusses

*  The thing installs in like 8 minutes.  With that quick of an install, 
it changed my idea of  "debugging" from hunt, comb and wait for bug 
reports, to test it till its ready.
The installation time and it was actually a big help when I was working 
on the netware client scripts. I probably reinstalled 10 or so times. 
After all I want to be damn sure that a script that
automates the initiation and aftermath of a kernel recompile works 
right. I always knew I could start over again and not worry about 
loosing a few hours.

*  A true bazaar of users, with lots of input from people that are 
leaving the Windows cathederal

* Lindows.com staff and executives will tell us their plans,  even if 
they are unpopular

* The fact that they are making their desktop more user friendly forces 
the other distributions to follow suit.  I think you all can guess that 
I am pushing for them to create "click and configure."

* They made a significant contribution to Wine, and I am now much closer 
to using Linux solely

* Surprisingly bloat free for an eye candy extravaganza.


Mixed feelings:

* I want the distribution to pay for itself,  but Lindows will be funded 
primarily from selling Debian's apt.
I wish that they were able to sell their improvements to Wine instead! 
 Its unfortunate.

* The root thing.  Its a bad security policy, but by gosh, when I am 
working hard and learning, the last thing I want to
do is keep entering the stupid password.  

But that's the less frugal James talking, the James that thinks he only 
wants to eat ice cream instead of veggis.
As a practical matter, I think that making the root user the default 
user, is as bad as becoming an ice-cream-atarian.


Don't like:

* They are not going to provide Wine native in the distribution., you 
will need to pay for click and run

* Many insiders have come to the conclusion that we aren't able to 
compile the kernel if the source was not
provided by Lindows.com. To compile the source and have much of anything 
turned on in the kernel, you
have to buy their click and run service.


***************************

Anyway, that's what its like.  Lots of new users going there and they 
need answers. I am trying to help people out
as best I can, but I am not a seasoned vet, just adventurous and 
persistant. There are some answers I don't have.

For instance, I was helping someone use his palm pilot but the driver 
had a problem and the patch was put into 2.5 I think.
While working with people trying to solve their problems, I came to the 
realization that some things that should work do not work at all.
But if one of those guys went to kernel-land for help they would get 
eaten alive.  I probably would too.

After all of this I am more convinced than ever that it is going to take 
some major, additional resources
 to get Linux up to the standard that most Lindows Insiders expect that 
it should be. The expect to do no thinking, that everything ought to
be set up automatically, etc.

Anyway, enough of that.

&gt;&gt;Renegade software vendor Lindows.com Inc. has unleashed its new Linux-based 
&gt;&gt;operating system, promising an affordable Linux offering for the mass 
&gt;&gt;market that's compatible with Microsoft Corp.'s Windows file formats.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;With the release today of LindowsOS 3.0, the software vendor is raising the 
&gt;&gt;bar in its battle with nemesis Microsoft...
