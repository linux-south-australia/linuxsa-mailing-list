60 formats was what I heard about. Can Word do that many?

&gt; OpenOffice takes up less space than
&gt; MS Office?
&gt;

OpenOffice on my system is 129 Meg, 1923 files, 119 folders.
MS Office on my system is 207 Meg, 1523 files, 52 folders

&gt; Ideally they'd get OpenOffice 1.0 and it would WORK without
&gt; patches and stuff.
&gt;
Yes, that was my point.

&gt; The whole point of an office application appears to be that
&gt; "it knows better than you".
&gt;
I would have thought the point was a tool that you could set to do things 
just the way you wanted so that you didn't have to think about it, things 
were always set up and formatted how you needed them to be.

&gt; It even has a stupid star of David that keeps on trying to tell me about
&gt; the XML saving formats.
&gt;

Same as the Office Agent, some people (me) find them very helpful most of 
the time. If they get in your face too much they are simple to turn off.


I really think we need to develop these points so we can use them to 
support our cause. Free simply isn't enough to make people want to switch 
over. Lots seem to be switching over so we need to find out what made the 
move for them and how they are getting on with it. Then use that for the 
promotion of the product. If Apple can get away with their Switch ads 
showing former PC users who have made the switch to Macs, why cant we do 
the similar thing in our conversations about OpenSource.

Cheers,  Ian
