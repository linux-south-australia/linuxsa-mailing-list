Hi everyone,

New to the list and first post.  Couldn't find anything in the archives on
this (although it would appear as though there was some sort of bulk-buy
back in April or thereabouts), so apologies if this has been asked before.
Anyhow, &lt;/dribble&gt; :)

Attempting to get my wireless card up and running in RH8 but am having a
few issues with the pcmcia setup of the Nokia c910.

Is it true that one must compile a new kernel, minus pcmcia and then
install pcmcia-cs to get it (cirrus logic i82365 reg compat) working?  (I
_know_ it all works, WarLinux boots perfectly every time).

I've read of an issue with IRQ setup with these chips, hence the problem?

All assistance appreciated!

Regards,
Josh.
