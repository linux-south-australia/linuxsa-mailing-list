Also true, but unfortunately medical funding is apportioned on the basis
of `sexiness'; working in molecular biology as I do, this is very
apparent. People are alway prepeared to spend more after the fact.

After I posted the last comment I thought of several other diseases which
might go even above leprosy: cholera, dysentary, tuberculosis,
malnutrition... - these are not sexy diseases, and the funding is only
starting to reach useful levels in some (choleras for example).

&gt; I'm not certain whether I would want to classify various diseases as
&gt; "more sexy" or "less sexy" from a PR perspective than any other. What
&gt; you say may be true--I don't doubt that--but, to quote from a particular
&gt; musical about a particular saviour, "there will be poor always
&gt; pathetically struggling".
&gt;
&gt; And I would tend to interpret the word poor not as poor in pocket but
&gt; similar to the French concept, "les miserables".
