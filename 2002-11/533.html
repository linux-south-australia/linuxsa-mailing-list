&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Much as I hate to say this:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Windoze: Run something called setup.exe. Click Next a few times.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Reboot (probably). Fire up new application. Works. (except you
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can't read the help files if your system background colour is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; black, or some
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; similar fault which you just have to put up with)
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Linux: Unzip tarball. Bugger about with config files, Makefiles
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; etc. Compile. Compilation breaks. Hack something. Compile. Breaks
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; again in different place. Hack again.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (repeat...............................) Install. Try it. Doesn't
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; work. Hack something. Try again.(repeat.................) Write
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tear-stained post to list begging for help...
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, you're comparing a binary install to a source install.  This 
&gt; isn't really a valid argument.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; Debian:
&gt; &gt;&gt; apt-get install foo
&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;don't bother rebooting&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; run foo
&gt; 
&gt; Debian -- the OS for lazy people! (Hey, I use it...)

Yeah.. It's great like that.. Lazy (in this case) good.
BTW. You can also do similar things with debian src packages..
(Though I figure most people don't bother)
&gt; 
&gt; Lindows has tried to make a halfway between apt-get and the whole 
&gt; setup.exe deal - I guess it works for some, but I don't like it ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; IHMO neither system is "better".  They're completely different 
&gt; processes, and depending on your background, they suit you
&gt; differently.
&gt; 

I would also agree with this.. The right tool in the right place.

&gt; Show a debian advocate a setup.exe type install and they'll scream.


You heard me ?
  
&gt; Show a windows user apt-get and they'll scream.

Or stare blankly at the terminal an say "what ?" a lot..

&gt;  Go figure.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Debian installation 2 years old that hasn't been apt-getted anything
&gt; &gt; in all that time:

Well I guess that's a tribute to the quality of the original install.

&gt; &gt; apt-get install foo
&gt; &gt; &lt;data begins to trickle onto hard disk&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;month later: phone line disconnected for non-payment of bill which
&gt; &gt; exceeds National Debt&gt;


&gt; 
&gt; Laptop + someone else's broadband connection is always useful here ;-)


Or get a hold of the CD's of the latest stable..

&gt; 
&gt; Debian stable is great on dialup, but unstable always tests my 
&gt; patience, heh.  Getting ADSL soon - would love to get Internode if 
&gt; they'd provide a local debian mirror that isn't counted in the
&gt; download cap.
&gt; 
&gt; R

Debian Testing is a reasonable compromise.
IMHO unstable on a dialup is madness. (and probably eventual computing
suicide)

I have seen (and have had ) install based on unstable that were as bad
as RedHat in size and compromised libraries. One of the great things
about Debian is that you can trim it  down to fit your needs...

I use source and or dpkg -i for those "special" packages I just have to
have... What I have found though is that I am using fewer and fewer
packages as I go along... (just got rid of the gnome desktop etc and
bought some serious space back) This leads to quicker updates as well.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Scared to try it really!

I would be too.

Grab the CD's ...
Maybe DSL has some copies ?

(I have Potatoe here which would only get you half way)
