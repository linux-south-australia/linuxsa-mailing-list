Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; yeah I agree - time to get over it - this whole 10 year long neo-luddite
&gt; anti-change protest against all but the most ultra-basic forms of
&gt; communication is a bit thin.
&gt; I have never known HTML to be platform specific - so what's the deal?
&gt; Surely even the most basic of basic text email readers can still render HTML
&gt; - unless it has been deliberately turned off as a silent protest against
&gt; change.
&gt; I'm sure the security concerns of HTML are dead easy to work around too - so
&gt; give the web site maintainers a break eh?

*sigh*

Agree between yourselves all you like - a *lot* of people on this list don't 
like HTML, so get over it.

Why haven't more people replied to this thread?  They don't want to read 
*another* html-email thread.  Take this as a hint.

If really want HTML email go and write an HTML renderer for mutt.  Then you 
might get support for your cause.  Does it really matter?  IMHO, No.  But this 
list - for better or for worse - over the past x years has continually 
said "No" to HTML email.

Let's not get into this again.

Let's get into open-source, Linux and things that matter.
