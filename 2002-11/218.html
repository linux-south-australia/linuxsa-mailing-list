The commonly used symbol for relative gravitational force/acceleration
(these two continue to be confused because of this terminology) used with
centrifuges at least, is `lowercase g subscript rel'. We (molecular
biologists and others of the less mathematically rigorous scientific
disciplines) tend to use random symbols that overload the SI units - so
it's not suprising that a symbol which is either a multiplier (G) or a
unit of mass (g) is used. It's just that g is easier to write and think
about in short calculations than 9.8*m*s^-2 or 9.8*g*m*s^-2 (depending on
the context).

I still can't get over the fact that most of the people I work with think
1 log to base 10 is a unit of statistical significance.

&gt; :) It was the use of "g" that was confusing me :) Is that really the
&gt; symbol for gravities? I thought it was grams, but then G is Giga so who
&gt; knows... Anyway don't confuse me with a DSTO scientist - I am one of
&gt; those that actually does most of the work out here (a contract
&gt; programmer) :)
