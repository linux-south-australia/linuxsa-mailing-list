David,

&gt; The interesting thing about his comment is it ignores the "T" in HTML.

Whose comment? I haven't ignored the "Text" in HTML at all.

&gt; HTML is text.  It contains no images, music, or any media other than
&gt; text.  HTML is text with markup that provides some basic formatting
&gt; and expression which otherwise is missing from plain text.

...which the masses, who generally cannot typeset and shouldn't need to
be typesetter [use TeX or LaTeX to typeset], don't usually use to its
full advantage.

People can, indeed, use HTML to add to the meaning of e-mails but they
generally do not.

&gt; Aren't asterisks, slashes and underlines for expression all so last
&gt; millenium, particularly when HTML lets you emphasise in &lt;b&gt;*bold*&lt;/b&gt;?

Simply arguing that a new format for e-mail, in this case HTML, is good
because it allows you to make text bold and that another format of
e-mail uses "asterisks", "slashes" and "underlines" for expression is a
valid argument but not sufficient to carry your case.

You should know this.

&gt; At the end of the day, all of the arguments that I have seen
&gt; concerning why not to use HTML are shallow attempts to disguise poor
&gt; use of the tool as defects in the tool.

My primary argument, amongst much smoke, is that people do not use HTML
to add to the meaning or structure of their e-mails. In fact, I would
argue that HTML is a burden on e-mail that is not necessary at all.

&gt; My answer to that would have
&gt; to be a fifty line, ascii art signature.

If it is, then would you care to add one to each of your e-mails?
Practise what you preach.

&gt; That, and that the
&gt; arguments, coming as they mostly do from grey beards, is "crusty old
&gt; fart."

Have we just descended into the "we can't argue to the argument, so
we'll argue to the person"? You should also know that is very bad form.
In fact, I know someone who used to have a grey beard that you do
respect but who also shares a point of view that HTML e-mail is not good
form.

Would you care to:

a) guess who I'm talking about
b) call him a "crusty old fart" to his face at a conference

??

Obviously you would be self-assured that this wouldn't be libel because
you can't speak libel if you're only telling the truth for no ulterior
motive.
