In Opera 6.04 (under Windoze) it would not pass his "Incompatible 
browser" message until I changed the "Identify as" to read "IE 5". 
Reload Opera and I am into the site with full access. Opera doesn't 
seem to like his FLASH (?) Pages so I better look into that aspect 
further.

Why do people design sites like this? 

Now, IMHO, the persons to speak to are the people who paid him to 
design the site, they must have given him a design brief, maybe they 
are not aware that he has designed in a closed-source restriction.

They are;

ITD Resources Pty Ltd (ABN 86 076 392 062)
Trading as Wine Jobs Australia
28 Greenhill Road
Wayville SA 5034
Australia.


Let them know that he is deliberately blocking people from access into 
the site if they are using browsers other than Internet Exploiter. Let 
them know that a number of other browsers are easily able to access the 
site once they get past his restriction page.

Ask them if this is what they really intended to do, "Block access 
unless the reader has that specific brand of browser?"

Cheers,  Ian
