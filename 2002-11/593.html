&gt; In the last year I've been forced on occasion to use a Microsoft-based

&gt; 200 characters long, and there was nothing I could do about it.

It sounds rather like what you had to read could not have been presented
in plain text at all.  So what you are saying is that mail, which was of
such unusual aspect that it required HTML, displayed using long lines.
That doesn't sound like a criticism of HTML email at all.  To the
contrary, it sounds like an endorsement.


&gt;&gt; I should imagine that quoted text could be quite clear if preceeded
&gt;&gt; by the usual attribution line and enclosed in a cell with a
&gt;&gt; different coloured background.  A reasonable GUI agent should permit
&gt;&gt; cut and paste, or intermingling new text.
&gt;
&gt; How many colours can you distinguish?  How many before you lose track
&gt; of the sequence?  How do you print them out?  Here I see a total of
&gt; five mail messages, indicated by the indentation.  What colours would
&gt; you assign to each of them, and why?

Entirely reasonable questions.  I think the use of colour is one that's
not very important, and easily open to argument.  There are alternatives,
such as placing quoted text in a bordered cell.  In fact that is perhaps
best because it makes it perfectly clear how many levels deep a quote is.
This is easy to do in HTML.
