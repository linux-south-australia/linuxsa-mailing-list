Michael,

&gt; Largely seems to come down to whether the organisers are 'in' with the
&gt; media. Remember the Jazz festival down at Glenelg a couple of weekends
&gt; ago? I knew it was on, and bought the Saturday 'tiser to see who was
&gt; playing. What did I find? One tiny paid ad in the what's on section!
&gt; You wouldn't find it if you weren't specifically looking for it.

Then it is our duty to ensure that events like these where we can
demonstrate open source business models, products and businesses that
we lend some help in promoting them.

We're a grass roots movement and we have something that Microsoft don't
have: unpaid, enthusiastic volunteers--some might say zealots--who
believe in open source, know open source and are willing to promote
open source on its merits alone.

We only need a few marketing minded people to tune us in a little and
we've got a sales force who's unpaid, highly effective and
extraordinarily motivated; this is something any business manager would
just dream about.

We can stop dreaming.
