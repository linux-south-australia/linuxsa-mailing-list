&gt; Are you suggesting that Linux becomes popular in the same way that Unix
&gt; (tm) did? By getting people at school, universities and TAFEs?

Universities and TAFEs obviously have a different focus. I never saw any 
mention of a Unix type environment at my school, we were Winblows/Netware all 
the way. 

Universities and TAFEs generally teach about system administration and 
programming in a Unix environment (although i've recently seen an article how 
that's changing and they're offering courses on using Linux as an everyday 
OS). At my university we have Solaris with the pitiful excuse for a desktop 
environment that is CDE. And ordinary people hate it, programmers/science 
students and IT students go in there for maple, programming, etc... if the 
windows rooms are full you'll see some people with an rdpclient window open 
connecting to a windows terminal server. Unix is portrayed as some confusing 
hacker environment with no place on a home computer. 

My focus in _schools_ including primary schools, is to use linux as a medium 
to teach not the thing being taught, except in the case of high school 
courses about programming and system administration. If a KDE environment is 
set up nicely then there will be minimal teaching about how to use the thing, 
and more using it as a learning tool.  And besides, kids will pick it up in a 
flash and will probably end up administering the servers for the teachers 
anyway :) In fact i've heard that kids have written things for the school and 
got to see them run on the servers for everybody to use. Also web hosting, 
cgi scripting, etc etc...(maybe not kids, but highschool anyway)

I think you missed my point completely, I hope i've cleared it up (I did make 
a rather long post :)

Damien.
