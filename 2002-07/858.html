&gt; Depends what you want to use it for. If you want a text editor, I

&gt; &gt; Seriously, by current standards of computer hardware and software, emacs
&gt; &gt; is not bloatware, not in the slightest.
&gt;
&gt; Considering one of the advantages of Linux is that it runs on
&gt; non-current hardware, and for many home users, this is the case, then
&gt; that argument doesn't really stand up too well. Of course, if you are
&gt; running current hardware, you're probably right, but then, MS Word is
&gt; pretty quick on current hardware...

I still don't think that the degree warrants the 'bloatware' tag.

I have a P233MMX (Pentium classic, not II) which lives permanently in
swap, character mode emacs starts in about 2-3 seconds, and about 0.3
seconds for subsequent runs.

Not that you need subsequent runs, since the emacs paradigm is to run it
once, and use it for everything. Not saying I subscribe to that, but
there it is.

I'll not deny that emacs is bigger than vim/vi, but I will defend
against the bloatware tag. It's bigger because it has lots in it. But it
still performs more than adequately on all hardware I have. And the spec
of my poorest machine is pretty low end.

weasel:~ &gt; echo $EDITOR
vi
