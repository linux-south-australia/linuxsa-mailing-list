Subject: Re: [OT] MacOS for PC

&gt;&gt;     a)    Have they used Windows, MacOS or Linux before?
&gt;&gt;     b)    What are they going to do with it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     The reason I would ask the first question is that if
&gt;&gt; they have never used any system before, then the learning
&gt;&gt; curve for the system will be just as steep whichever one
you
&gt;&gt; use from a users perspective. I would also point out a
&gt;&gt;USERS
&gt;&gt; perspective, because I assume that you are going to set
it
&gt;&gt; up for them, and also if it does "break" then you will be
&gt;&gt; fixing it. I also assume that you will probably end up
&gt;&gt; installing any new software on it, so it will probably
end
&gt;&gt; up as some kind of administered system anyhow.

&gt;That's not entirely true. Sit a person down in front of an
iMac ?&gt;box
&gt;and tell them to "make it work", they'll have it done a lot
quicker
&gt;than if you sit them down in front of a Linux box and tell
them &gt;"make it work" (or a Windows box, for that matter).

&gt;If the Mac breaks (as in, for whatever reason, needs a
complete
&gt;reinstall), you just stick a CD, reboot it and press a few
buttons.
&gt;It's all pretty simple. Linux still isn't that simple --
neither is
&gt;Windows.

Hi Andrew,
    What do you mean by "make it work"? What I meant was If
a USER wanted to send mail, then run the mail client, if
they wanted to surf, run a Browser, if they wanted to
balance the cheque book, run a spreadsheet or if they wanted
to write a letter, run a word processor. These are everyday
USER things, and I would have to say that if the machine was
set up ready for a USER, then M$, Mac or a suitable Linux
Distro would be more or less identical. All these systems
are GUI based or menu driven and any user can pick it up in
next to no time. KDE and Gnome were designed to be Windows
and Mac like to make it easy to change over. Gnome used to
have a Windows mask that even changed the toolbar to a
"Start" button (it may still but I have used KDE for a while
now).

    I think that you may have been thinking of something
like Installing software, which is an ADMIN task, and in the
particular scenario we were talking about, the parents
(USERS) wouldn't be doing this, the son (ADMIN) would. IF
this were the case, then I think that many people in this
position would likely shy away from these type of tasks
which ever OS they used. As far as fixing Linux, the very
nature of Linux is that non root cannot break something
important, they can break their own account, but not the
system. In this case, whoever is ADMIN can easily fix it
without a full reinstall by deleting and recreating the
account at worst.

    In the case of a major break, the ADMIN person would do
the reinstall anyhow, so what difference does it make to
which OS you use in the first place. I think the original
point was that the users of this system were unlikely to
play and break anything, but even if they did, the admin
probably wouldn't trust them to just stick a CD in and press
a few buttons. So I still think that for this application,
Linux is probably the best solution. The only thing I would
add is that in this case M$ is probably the worst solution
in that a USER has complete admin like access (unless you
are using NT or such like) and all it takes is one of those
"delete this important file because it is a virus" emails,
and you could be in real trouble with a complete novice with
admin like access. Well that's my 2c worth.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

P.S. why do I always get mail from you on the list as a
message with a mail attachment? It isn't a big thing but I
usually don't get it from anyone else who regularly posts.
It might be a setting on your mail client you might like to
check out.
