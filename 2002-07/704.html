Hi

And there's the rub. A new user does not have your (or my) photoshop
background. Coming to grips with any of the current crop of feature-rich
and bloated software, both GPL and commercial, is daunting, but less
significantly so if you haven't used any other comparable app and
therefore will maybe not judge 'different' as 'inferior'.

Isn't this whole user-interface discussion about trading on the normal
human trait of generalised resistance to change? 

With that in mind, it always amazes me that MS constantly (and often
senselessly) changes the interfaces to their popular apps. It's even worse
for the same apps on different platforms. Have a look at OE on the Win and
Mac platform to see what I mean. At least the Gimp is pretty consistent
between versions!

As an aside, Photoshop is a pretty expensive bit of software for an
occasional user like me. I prefer to use a legal Gimp than an illegal
Photoshop.

Regards,

Michael
