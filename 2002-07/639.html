&gt; Do you have any say in their course content? Or are you employed by
&gt; TAFE?

No I am going by what I have read, I got that information from a story I read 
on the web some time ago, but i dont remember the link. From what other 
people have said about TAFE courses I think I was on the right track. If you 
have solid information about a _desktop_ linux/unix focus in TAFE courses, 
i'd like to hear about it.

Anyway, my focus was on *schools*, kids _have_ to go to school, they will 
learn very quickly and not be prejudiced by being brought up on M$ systems 
("hey that's different, that sucks"). 

&gt; &gt; At my university we have Solaris with the pitiful excuse for a desktop
&gt; &gt; environment that is CDE. And ordinary people hate it, programmers/science
&gt; &gt; students and IT students go in there for maple, programming, etc... if
&gt; &gt; the windows rooms are full you'll see some people with an rdpclient
&gt; &gt; window open connecting to a windows terminal server. Unix is portrayed as
&gt; &gt; some confusing hacker environment with no place on a home computer.
&gt;
&gt; So what; if I bothered about what people called me (geek, gook, slopey
&gt; eye and other interesting things) I'd have given up years ago.

Um. what? I don't understand how racism is related to people not liking unix.

&gt; &gt; I think you missed my point completely, I hope i've cleared it up (I did
&gt; &gt; make a rather long post :)
&gt;
&gt; No you missed my point.

I didn't mean to start an argument. When I said u missed my point, i was 
implying that I did not explain myself properly, which is often the case. I 
did not intend to insult you or anything  :)

Damien
