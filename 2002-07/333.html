We went the cheap and easy route, so its probably not for you.  We 
acquired an HP Netserver LXE Pro 200 (c19/98-Dual Pentium Pro 512MB RAM) 
from an auction for $385US. It happens to have 18GB useable storage
plus 4 GB for the system, so we popped in Mandrake Linux and Samba ($40 
US) and copy the contents of one of our servers from a Windows 
workstation over night.

&gt;Attention all people who have had any experience with backup systems!
&gt;:)
&gt;
&gt;We here at work are going to upgrade our backup system, and by jingoes,
&gt;I've been having quite an interesting ride engulfing all of this
&gt;information.  When it comes to "mega backup" systems, I have not had a
&gt;great deal of hands-on experience.
&gt;
&gt;We presently back up to DAT tapes on a SONY STD-10000 SCSI Drive.  The
&gt;box is running Windows 2000 Server, running Backup Exec 8.0.  The whole
&gt;system is completely unreliable and totally hopeless with backups
&gt;consistently failing.  We are about to increase our online storage
&gt;capacity (to about 200Gb) with the purchase of a new file server, and to
&gt;complement it, we need to replace our failing backup system.
&gt;
&gt;I have been looking into the Ultrium standard which would appear to be
&gt;the way backup technology is heading.  If this is the case, what are
&gt;people out in the real world using?  I have read the DAT technology has
&gt;been "end-of-life'd" so I do not see much point in going with it.
&gt;
&gt;Ultimately the system will work something like this:
&gt;
&gt;MAIN FILE SERVER:		Holds majority of our data (~200Gb)
&gt;				Running *nix (most likely FreeBSD)
&gt;
&gt;BACKUP DEVICE:		Detatched (independent)
&gt;				Communicate via SCSI to Main File Server
&gt;				Compatible with FreeBSD / Linux
&gt;
&gt;BACKUP SYSTEM:		Managed by Main File Server
&gt;				Possibly running Amanda
&gt;(<A HREF="http://www.amanda.org">http://www.amanda.org</A>) or something similar, as yet undecided
&gt;				Able to backup over SAMBA
&gt;
&gt;BUDGET:			$10,000 (with an $8,000 target)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As it stands I'm getting pretty tired of this Windows based system
&gt;falling all over itself, and I'd like to get something reliable
&gt;happening.  Unfortunately I have zero experience in looking for a
&gt;kick-ass backup system, and so I'm calling in advice to find out what
&gt;options people recommend me to go and explore.  I'd like to know what
&gt;other people are running in their corporate environments.
&gt;
&gt;Any directions?  I'm going in pretty blind here, and by the end of it
&gt;I'd love to come out all sweet, rosy and happy.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
