&gt; Just out of interest, is /tmp really a sensible place for putting Unix

I hope there's a special circle in hell for people who abuse /tmp this
way.  That and storing files in there.  "Can you not have the system
purge /tmp on bootup?  We've got files in there we need to keep." was
a request I actually received once (the irony was that it was on
Solaris, as explained below - they thought I was just being BOFHish
when I said "no, you can't").

&gt; (side note: I can't remember what OS'es do it, but apparently some OS'es
&gt; actualy mkfs the /tmp partition because it's quicker than actually
&gt; fsck'ing it or sumthing like that ;-P)

As the followups say, Solaris does this by default.  HP-UX can do it,
but it impacts VM on any system, so why would you?  The increase in
speed isn't worth it once you hit swap.
