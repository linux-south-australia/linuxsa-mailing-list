Well there are some in the U.S. that will oppose it.

 From my point of view and as an outsider, I think that Australia has a 
better chance at rejecting the rediculous compared to the U.S.

I watched the Australian House of Commons many years ago on a U.S. 
government public access channel called "CSPAN."  I found the Australian 
House of Commons to be much more spirited and lively with debate then 
the U.S. House of Representatives.

Just my .002 - (2 mills).

&gt;&gt;If they both do the same thing, the user won't care. So put a link to
&gt;&gt;mozilla on the desktop with an IE like icon, and set diald or something
&gt;&gt;up.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The user does care.  That's the problem.  If it doesn't look EXACTLY The
&gt;same then they refuse to use it.  They claim it's too difficult to use. 
&gt;They claim they can't use feature X (when feature X is actually in a
&gt;more relevant location in the menu system), because they can't see it in
&gt;the menus.  People are simple and lazy.  They don't think.  They just
&gt;want to do what they've been shown to write a letter or surf the web. 
&gt;That little paperclip must be common among the simple masses - "You're
&gt;writing a letter, would you like me to a. bollocks it up for you b. fsck
&gt;off c. crash your computer".
&gt;
&gt;&gt;MYOB runs under wine. Chat progs are available.
&gt;&gt;GUIs can be setup to behave however you want, like windows, or for the more
&gt;&gt;adventurous - in a useful configuration :)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Wine still crashes too much - I wouldn't trust it to run MYOB, because
&gt;the people who run MYOB generally keep all kinds of really important
&gt;data in it.  VMWare is a good start, but it still needs the M$ tax :-( 
&gt;If VMWare could work without a kernel patch it'd be excellent.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Open Office, faster to load docs than Word.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Open Office loads faster than word.  What you have to take into account
&gt;is that when Windows boots it actually preloads IE, word and excel (and
&gt;their associated DLLs) into memory.  It appears they're loading faster,
&gt;when simply a small amount has to be swapped back into memory.  Why do
&gt;you think the boot time for windows goes from a few seconds to well over
&gt;a minute immediately after office is installed?  It's M$'s way of
&gt;looking superior to the competition.  It's cheating, I know, but it
&gt;still looks better to those who don't have a clue/dont' care.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;DRM is a joke and even if the US decide to cripple their IT industry, I
&gt;&gt;doubt
&gt;&gt;the rest of the world will blindly follow. (EU at least, if not we lemmings
&gt;&gt;in aus).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We are Lemmings in AU.  The ozzie government is so conformist to the US
&gt;that it's not funny. DRM is becoming LAW in the US.  If it's not opposed
&gt;and thrown out then it will be a requirement.  That's not a good thing! 
&gt;It's a breach of privacy.  Say I download some "educational" material. 
&gt;My Fritz (I always knew there was a reason I didn't eat that saussage
&gt;stuff) goes and talks to whoever owns it, tells them lots about me then
&gt;gets a license to play it.  Now they know all about what I like to
&gt;watch, and can a. use it against me if they feel like it   b. send me
&gt;more crap and advertising that targets my specific "interest".
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The gap is closing, and microsoft need to concentrate on their deficient
&gt;&gt;areas
&gt;&gt;according to bill (security etc.). There are plenty of areas - on the
&gt;&gt;desktop -
&gt;&gt;where Linux is already superior (IMHO).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The gap is not closing.  Geeks are moving away from Windows because they
&gt;can.  Hackers because it's a better programming environment, and
&gt;crackers (prolly only script kiddies) because they can get root access
&gt;on it and do some nasty network things to better enable them to break
&gt;through whatever security we put in place.
&gt;
&gt;Joe Schmoe doesn't care.  He doesn't even care about security. He
&gt;doesn't have the first clue about getting cracked, or spyware or
&gt;anything.  He installs (has someone else install for him) Windows and
&gt;Office.  He downloads Kazaa and Audio Galaxy so he can get free music. 
&gt;They install spyware.  He uses internet explorer and it sends all his
&gt;personal information to whatever site requests it.  And all the time he
&gt;is ignorant to what's going on.  He bitches about privacy and all that,
&gt;but doesn't know that because he's using Windows he has almost none!
&gt;
&gt;Ignorance is bliss my friends!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Adam
