Hi

I'm having some fairly serious problems with a SCSI disk in
a Linux server I administer and would be grateful for any
help you can offer.

-----
Dell PowerEdge 2450
2 x Intel Pentium III
Adaptec 7899P SCSI controller
1 x Seagate UW SCSI 18 GB (scsi 0:0:0) (/dev/sda)
1 x Fujitsu UW SCSI 18 GB (scsi 0:0:1) (/dev/sdb)
Red Hat Linux 7.3
Linux 2.4.18 (?)
-----

This afternoon the server hung and all my terminal sessions
on the machine displayed a message about a failed assertion
in do_get_write_access() (presumably from the kernel).  I
went to the server room and saw the following error on the
system console:

-----
kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 1 lun 0\
return code = 10000
 I/O error: dev 08:13, sector 49272
[repeated a few times on various sectors]
EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,17)): ext3_readdir:\
directory #863415 contains a hole at offset 0
-----

I had similar errors a few weeks ago, and after rebooting
neither the OS nor the SCSI BIOS could detect the SCSI disk.
The disk was replaced with a new disk which was mostly
identical except for the vendor (old disk was Seagate, new
disk was Fujitsu -- replaced under warranty), I restored
from our most recent backup, took the opportunity to upgrade
to the latest Red Hat Linux kernel package (which includes a
more recent aic7xxx driver), and things worked again.

I don't know much about SCSI, so I would appreciate any
ideas about what the problem could be (solutions would be
good too!).

This was the brief version.  Let me know if you want more
information or logs (most of which are actually on the
server that went down, but I can try to bring it back up.)

Thanks in advance for any help.
