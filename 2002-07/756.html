&gt; In my observations, dynamic IPs and a part-time connection to the
&gt; net don't make you any safer.  When I first setup my firewall (ages
&gt; ago) I was very surprised to find port scans and connection attempts
&gt; starting seconds after I'd connected to my ISP (dynamic IP).

None, I've been done twice, and I'm on a dialup.  Admittedly I spend a
fair amount of time online, but it didn't make any difference to the
script kiddie.  I don't think they know how to tell whether you're on
cable/DSL anyway.  They just want to r00t the Internet. It's some sort
of personality disorder.  Nobody loves them or something?


&gt; All the script kiddies run automated stuff scanning IP ranges.
&gt; Obviously they'd prefer to "hack" a box with cable/adsl or other
&gt; faster connections and if they do they use that to run their scans
&gt; from.  Which is why tracking them down is a waste of time, you can
&gt; find where the connection to you comes from but not the next hop
&gt; without cooperation all the way back up the chain.

You can do a bit of your own nasty stuff to find out.  We did agree on
the list a while ago that this is a waste of time though, as it is
illegal and likely to land you in trouble if said script kiddie is using
resources from a larger organisation that takes security a little more
seriously.

It got to the point for me that I put on a firewall to block all
incoming connections, and closed anything that listens on the Internet. 
I run netstat -lp as root and see nothing except a few Unix sockets. 
It's easier than worrying about things, and I don't really need the
services running (ssh would be nice, but it was the only service running
last time and they got in so I'm assuming that was the hole).

Anywho,
Cheers,
Adam
