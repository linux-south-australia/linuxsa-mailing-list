Ok I hope there is a simple answer for this but trolling around the
HOWTOs the squid.conf file and several google searches later I'm not
sure.

I am running the Dansguardian web filter program (not bad really, I know
SquidGuard is probably better but I couldn't get it to fly - long story)
and it does a fine job. The last bit of the puzzle however is having it
log the username of the user who tried to get to a blocked site. Now if
I was using some kind of authentication in squid then Dansguardian would
log the user. However all that is happening is you can login to a
workstation here at school, via a Novell login that of course
authenticates the user to the Novell server but also passes the
information to the local windows workstation to let the user in. Then if
you run a browser your on the internet, we never felt the need and
thought it too cumbersome to have a user type in a username/password
combo again to get access to the internet. But we will go down that path
if we have too.

The Dansguardian docs say

"Username identification methods (used in logging):
The proxyauth option is for when basic proxy authentication is used
(obviously no good for transparent proxying). The ntlm option is for
when the proxy supports the MS NTLM authentication.  This only works
with IE5.5 sp1 and later, and has not been implemented yet. The ident
option causes DansGuardian to try to connect to an identd server on the
computer originating the request."

So what I'm after is turning proxy authentication on in Squid so it logs
the username it gets from the workstation, is this possible? Or must it
look of an external list of usernames/passwords??? Or can we turn on
proxy authentication on and let all usernames in? We have other ACL's in
place of course.
