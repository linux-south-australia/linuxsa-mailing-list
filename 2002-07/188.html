Hi All,
    I have a rather annoying problem with a dual boot
desktop at present. It works fine with the Redmond Product,
but when I boot Linux (Suse 7.2 Pro) I discovered I couldn't
surf with Netscape. On further investigation (I initially
thought it was a DNS problem), I came across the following
error msg in the boot log:

Setting up network device eth0
doneSetting up IPv6 network interface (no address)done
Setting up routing (using /etc/route.conf)
Error while excuting:
    /sbin/route add -net 203.XX.YYY.193 netmask 255.255.0.0
gw 203.XX.YYY.193 dev eth0
    route: netmask doesn't match route address

Setting up routingfailed

    Now I know that the Netmask here is wrong (everything
else uses 255.255.255.192), but it occurred to me that if it
was something different I don't have a clue how to calculate
a Netmask anyhow, and after a bit of a search I couldn't
find anything on the Net about how to either. Further to
this problem, the 255.255.255.192 works on all the M$ boxes
and my Server, but when I tried to manually run the command
as root on the Linux Desktop with what I thought to be the
correct Netmask, I got the same error. Now I have had a
routing problem before that was solved when someone kindly
calculated the Netmask for me (ie 255.255.255.192), but to
be honest I just took their word for it because it worked.
Can someone help me out here and show me and everybody else
here who might have run into this problem - How do you
calculate a Netmask? Any suggestions as to why the route
command doesn't work for other resons would also be
appreciated.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
