Hi.

Having had to migrate from a simple DAT backup on linux to a fancy Windows
backup system, I can offer some comment.

1. The interfaces on the Win backup products all suck. I find BackupExec
better than ArcServ, but getting a reliable unattended backup is not
easily achievable on either. Getting a restore happening is even harder.
Classic case of the designers creating a pretty interface over a
functional one.

2. Try to find software that is smart about managing and tracking tapes,
and also prevents accidental overwriting of previous backups (like on
Monday of a long weekend, or when someone forgets to swap tapes one day)

3. Looks like you are going for an all-in-one solution (One box, files and
backup system) We found that too painful on Windows, but it will probably
work fine on *nix. Our issue was not being able to bounce the backup
system (don't ask) because people were using the data - that is way less
likely to happen on *nix.

4. We're using DLT tape drives for about 170Gb of files and data, which
fits on one tape with compression. Tape drives will be the biggest expense
in your system, so choose carefully. We actually have 2 drives, one for
the nightly complete backup, and one for transaction log backup during the
day. Eventually, we will have to cascade the nightly backup over the two
drives. The DLT's (Quantum) have been trouble free so far (18 months)

5. If you have space (and execution time) available, I'd reccomend keeping
2 copies: 1 on the tape, and one on another system on your network. Others
have mentioned this and the need for offsite tape storage.

6. As far as your existing system is concerned, We went through similar
pain. The answer for us was to upgrade to the latest BE, and hassle
support for answers to the crazy problems as they arose. Eventually, we
had a reliable backup running. Backup Exec is painfully pedantic, and will
classify an entire backup job as failed for the most insignificant
problem.

Good Luck,

Michael

&gt; Attention all people who have had any experience with backup systems!
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; We here at work are going to upgrade our backup system, and by jingoes,
&gt; I've been having quite an interesting ride engulfing all of this
&gt; information.  When it comes to "mega backup" systems, I have not had a
&gt; great deal of hands-on experience.
&gt; 
&gt; We presently back up to DAT tapes on a SONY STD-10000 SCSI Drive.  The
&gt; box is running Windows 2000 Server, running Backup Exec 8.0.  The whole
&gt; system is completely unreliable and totally hopeless with backups
&gt; consistently failing.  We are about to increase our online storage
&gt; capacity (to about 200Gb) with the purchase of a new file server, and to
&gt; complement it, we need to replace our failing backup system.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been looking into the Ultrium standard which would appear to be
&gt; the way backup technology is heading.  If this is the case, what are
&gt; people out in the real world using?  I have read the DAT technology has
&gt; been "end-of-life'd" so I do not see much point in going with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Ultimately the system will work something like this:
&gt; 
&gt; MAIN FILE SERVER:		Holds majority of our data (~200Gb)
&gt; 				Running *nix (most likely FreeBSD)
&gt; 
&gt; BACKUP DEVICE:		Detatched (independent)
&gt; 				Communicate via SCSI to Main File Server
&gt; 				Compatible with FreeBSD / Linux
&gt; 
&gt; BACKUP SYSTEM:		Managed by Main File Server
&gt; 				Possibly running Amanda
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.amanda.org">http://www.amanda.org</A>) or something similar, as yet undecided
&gt; 				Able to backup over SAMBA
&gt; 
&gt; BUDGET:			$10,000 (with an $8,000 target)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As it stands I'm getting pretty tired of this Windows based system
&gt; falling all over itself, and I'd like to get something reliable
&gt; happening.  Unfortunately I have zero experience in looking for a
&gt; kick-ass backup system, and so I'm calling in advice to find out what
&gt; options people recommend me to go and explore.  I'd like to know what
&gt; other people are running in their corporate environments.
&gt; 
&gt; Any directions?  I'm going in pretty blind here, and by the end of it
&gt; I'd love to come out all sweet, rosy and happy.
&gt;
