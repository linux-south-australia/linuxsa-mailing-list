 &gt; Microsoft have made a killing out of selling Windows for Intel PC's.

And, in the process, they have completely dominated that market segment.
There is *no room* for any Microsoft competitors at the moment.  Apple
would be absolutely insane to try to redesign their company into a 
Microsoft competitor.

 &gt; For a good many users, Windows does work albeit in a semi-to-totally
 &gt; broken manner but it does what they want.
 &gt; Seeing they can get a $2000 machine to do WHAT THEY WANT, why pay $7000
 &gt; to do WHAT THEY WANT?

Because, by and large, PC's don't do what people want.  Or, more
generously, they do what people want, but only by throwing in wasteful
hours of crap which nobody in their right mind would want.  I'm sure
we can all think of dozens of examples of this;  "Email Viruses" kinda
sticks out in my mind, but it's not too hard to remember the countless
others.

Macs do what people want - and that's it.  Macintosh hardware, with
the MacOS, "just works."  

Furthermore, your figures are a bit rubbery:  Yes, you can buy a 
$2000 PC to do "what you want" (and a whole lot of things which you
don't want), but you can also buy a $2000 Mac to do "what you want."
You're comparing the "typical" PC to the "bells and whistles with 
the 22-inch flat-panel LCD display" Macintosh, which is hardly fair.

 &gt; If Apple released Mac OS for Intel I'd probably buy it (yes, buy)...

Yup - So you'd spend, say, $150 on Apple software instead of $2000
or more on Apple hardware.  And then you wouldn't be able to run any
applications on it, because all the apps in the market run on PowerPC
hardware, and because the "applications barrier to entry" which the
US Antitrust judges have eloquently written about in the judgements
which found that Microsoft was a criminal organization would prevent
a critical mass of those applications from being ported, so you'd
stop using it and switch to Windows.  And nobody would buy Macs anymore,
so the existing apps for the MacOS would lose their marketplace.  And
Apple would go broke.

THINK through the implications.  Apple wouldn't last 18 months if
it was an MS competitor.
