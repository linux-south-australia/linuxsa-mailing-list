Hmm, good advice.  I've just chucked in a new power supply, video card,
network card (when i say new i mean more old junk from the collection) and
it survived the night.   it seems to be fairly random but never crashes
during the day...  only at night.  i think it's not been hacked as it's only
got ssh running and limited to only our internal range with the
hosts.allow/hosts.deny ...

thanks for the feedback people
M

Heyas all,

How stable is your power supply and what wattage is it? You didn't specify
what type of CPU you are running (amd or intel.) My computer runs stable
only when I've got a box fan running next to the open case but I suspect
it's got something to do with a dodgy power supply because if I'm running
anything else on the same power circuit it crashes anyway (no matter where
it is.) I'm running an Athlon 550.

Try getting a hold of a high quality power supply with a good wattage rating
and see if it makes any difference.. Its just an idea can't hurt to try.

Good luck.

Simon.

Subject: Troubleshooting a crashing machine


Hi Everyone,
I've got a machine which basically has dial up (ppp authenticating to the
local password file) and hylafax and was running very nicley for about 3
months straight.  Now all of a sudden it's crashing every night and i have
no idea why.  I've got about three extra fans in it as i thought it would be
overheating, but it's a cool as a cucumber when i come to restart it.

I searched google, but understandably there isn't much by way of Linux Crash
Troubleshooting - Howto  :)

had a look at log files, testing all kinds of things, so i think it's
hardware.  i'm currently loading up a new machine to take it's place, but i
don't learn anything that way, anybody got any ideas?  something to run on
the machine all the time to test it as it's running?

The hard drive isn't full either.

anyway, thanks ppl
M
