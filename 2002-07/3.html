Hi all,

I have a confusing problem with two RH 7.3 desktop machines that I
administer. When the users are not using them for more than an hour or
so (I don't know if it's a regular amount of time, or random), they
get logged out. AFAIK, there is no auto-logout facility that has been
enabled...

The machines are basically RH7.3 standard workstation installs,
running on an Ethernet (I don't know if it's 10 or 100, switched or
hubbed) network, which uses DNS, SMTP, and POP for the obvious, and
NIS (yp) and NFS (with the automounter maps coming over NIS) for home
directories and some data directories. One of them is using a static
IP address, and the other is using a static (MAC-based) DHCP-assigned
IP address. Both are running KDM and KDE (3, I think) for the desktop,
and users use StarOffice (which is loaded over NFS) and KMail, as well
as the occasional xterm session. The Network is not connected to the
internet (yet).

Neither machine was doing this prior to the entire network (of
~10 desktops and 1 server) being upgraded from 6.x, so I can't really
beleive that it's a hardware problem... The only evidence I have seen
so far is a slightly corrupted-looking last log... (typing `last`
shows some entries where the logout time contains non-ascii
characters).

Any hints as to where to look for this? Anyone experienced this
before? Is it just me, or does RH suck completely? (the default
install doesn't have the man pages for ntp, and the doco included
blows) ... Sorry, just venting at everyone's favourite commercial
distribution. :)
