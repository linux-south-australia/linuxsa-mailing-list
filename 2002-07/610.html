 &gt; Desktop is dead
 &gt;
 &gt; Not too mention the linux apps are appearing. These days there are
 &gt; numerous browsers that are pretty good,

All of which take longer to load than IE, none of which work as well (in
terms of web site compatibility - Standards are a different matter and the
average desktop user doesn't care.)

Excuse me while I play devil's advocate.

Joe Schmoe knows that if he hits the Big Blue E, and clicks "Connect" he can
surf the web.  The majority of Internet users (the ones that ring support
anyway) don't understand the distinction between a network connection to the
internet, and the software that makes use of that connection.  They don't
know that Internet Explorer is a browser, they think Internet Explorer is
just how the Internet works.  In that respect I don't think three sluggish
browsers with funny names is much of an advantage.

Joe Schmoe's employer isn't likely to switch to a Linux desktop because Joe
Schmoe has been surfing the web and chatting to his mates on MSN after work
every night and is thus already competent in using a Windows GUI.  Besides
which, he runs MYOB.

Joe Schmoe's son has heard of Linux before, but all the computers at his
school run complimentary Microsoft software, all his IT assignments have to
be handed up in DOC format, etc., etc., etc.....

How can Linux possibly hope to combat something with so many fingers in such
hefty pies?

Besides which, what happens when your desktop must be DRM compliant?  Surely
open-source is a circumvention device in itself?  Perhaps there are ways
around the problem, but while the open source communities scramble, Windows
will dominate in countless other ways.

Jordan.
