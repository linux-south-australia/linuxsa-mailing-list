&gt; I am trying to set up my Linux box  (Red Hat 7.3) as an adsl router with a
&gt; D-Link dsl-100d pci card.

:-)

&gt; I have downloaded the drivers from the d-link site but when I insert the
&gt; module into the kernal and then enter
&gt; # ifconfig eth1 up

Check what is in:

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*

...[ where * is some number ]. These are the configuration scripts for
ethernet devices under RedHat 7.3.

&gt; i get a unknown device error even after checking that the the driver has
&gt; been inserted properly

If it's loaded as a module, you'll need something in /etc/modules.conf.
Here is a sample entry for my own NIC:

[root]# cat modules.conf
...
alias eth0 ne2k-pci
...

You probably already know the name of the module that you're using, but
if you don't they normally reside in:

/lib/modules/2.4.[lots of numbers]/kernel/drivers/net

...look for one that has a similar name to the card. Mind you, it's
probably easier to read the README which will just tell you what the
name of the driver is.

&gt; The driver was written for kernel 2.4.8-16 and I am running 2.4.18-3  it was
&gt; the only one that I could find. I imagine that this does matter, but I dont know to what
&gt; extent?

These two kernels shouldn't have changed so much they'd upset the
driver.

&gt; Does anyone have a more up to date driver for this modem or any other
&gt; suggestions?

If you have the source to the driver, you could try rebuilding it on
your current system; if you don't know how then if you do an "ls" in the
source directory (it will probably have a Makefile in it or a file call
configure) and send me the results of that "ls".

[

My hunch would be:


./configure
make
make install

OR

make
make install

OR

make linux
make install
