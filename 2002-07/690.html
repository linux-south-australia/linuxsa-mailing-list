&gt; I generally always use Gnome. KDE is a total pain for me to use (but I
&gt; can use it), and it kills my productivity on a system if I use it...and
&gt; Mozilla seems to change its interface between versions.

The Mozilla interface doesn't change too much - it's pretty finalised
now.  I used to be a Gnome user until I sat down and really looked into
KDE.  Now I've found it better suits my needs.  It's not to say that the
Gnome interface was bad, or that KDE was bad.  It's just that when I
first got really deep into Linux, Gnome was the more prominent interface
in most distributions - there were things like Ximian Gnome (and a few
more) that you could download a simple installer and let it do the hard
work of soving the package dependencies. To get KDE to work was more
involved and I really didn't have the time. 

Yes, I was lazy, like so Joe Schmoe.  I had work to do and I just wanted
to get on with it.

It's much of a muchness between the interfaces once you've got them set
up.  They both clone the "Windows" type interface to some extent.  Both
Gnome and KDE support CTRL-C and CTRL-X and CTRL-V for copy, cut and
paste. That's the stumbling block for a lot of people.  When I did start
with Linux ^C ^V was unheard of. It was select with the mouse and middle
click where you wanted it.  That was pretty much the common way of doing
things (and I actually quite like it) but it took some getting used to.

&gt; I don't want to play with stuff until it works. *I* want to work...

Yes, buy you're not kids - kids don't understand *HOW* it works - they
just know that trying lots of things will eventually lead to the outcome
that they desire.  It does not matter whether you give them Windows,
MacOS or Linux, they're going to click everywhere until they see what
they want to see. It's called the learning process - you learn more by
making a lot of mistakes in the process than you do by getting things
that just do what you expect right on the first try.

The advantage of giving them Linux is that each app is slightly
different.  There is conformity among them, but not 100% conformity. 
Thus, in their fooling about with it, they will learn more about the
concept of the interface and the tools, rather than "to run programs I
use the start menu", "to edit pictures I *need* Photoshop".

&gt; Yes, but should they be thinking about "How do I make a better graphical
&gt; design with The Gimp?" rather than "How do I actually use this f****ng
&gt; program?"???

It's like everything though, there is a learning curve.  It does not
matter which is the superior tool; GIMP, Photoshop, Paintshop Pro.  All
three have their applications, and I think a user would need two of them
to do most serious work... one application cannot possibly cover all
types of work. If a user switches from Paintshop to Photoshop there's
still going to be a steep learning curve.  The interfaces are quite
different.  The only similarity is the MDI interface and the basic file
menu structure.

All three programs conform to a simple "graphics program" paridigm and
so they have common elements that work in a similar fashion.  Once you
find those elements and discover how they operate you can begin being
productive.

Cheers,
Adam
