&gt;&gt; This (ought to) fix problems with an unstable process running as the 
&gt;&gt; user and crashing.  Usually a restart of Samba is required to get it 
&gt;
&gt;Ummm.. Sounds like a kludge when the source of the problem could be
&gt;fixed. I havnt had a single problem with my redhat 6.1 samba server in
&gt;about 2.5 years. (samba 2.0.5a-12 currently, may have been upgraded at
&gt;some stage in the past). I thought each client got its own smbd process
&gt;on the server anyway?

Those were my thoughts also, our Samba box has been very stable apart from
a couple of power supply problems.  It's been through several Samba upgrades
and runs several other applications which add to the server load.

Personally I don't see the point in changing something that works quite well
at the moment, just running it by the list to see if anyone had played with
it as I didn't really have an opinion to give from experience (not that its
stopped me before ;)
