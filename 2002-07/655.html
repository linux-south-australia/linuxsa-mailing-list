&gt; BTW, OpenOffice is slow because it is running over Wind/U,

That is true, but have a look a bit deeper and you'll see that the system
is not only designed to be slow (which some companies very successfully
argue is a problem that modern hardware solves) but in addition it is also
designed to be non-portable. 

Have a look at the UNO bridges technology that the entire cross-platform
structure is built on. Every OS and language compiler combination needs
its own bridge. (A bridge fiddles with the virtual method tables and call
semantics in classes so that objects can invoke methods written in other
languages.) Bridges are largely written in assembler. Even different
optimisation levels within an OS/Compiler combination can require a
special bridge. Welcome to 32k files and 530Mb of very-hard-to-port source
code. And you'd think ANSI language standards would be used, but no. I
thought I'd learn a litle bit about the basics of how this monster works,
and I didn't find it a very rewarding experience.

I think that the bridge technology alone puts some upper bounds on how
well, quickly and responsively OpenOffice can grow even on the three
reference platforms.

&gt; It's only the lack of a viable alternative which makes OpenOffice at
&gt; all attractive.

I agree with this, much as the capabilities of OpenOffice can be highly
useful commercially.
