Steven,
	              
&gt;	I have been reading this list for nearly 12 months now and a lot 
&gt;	of information I have seen  has been useful to me. I started out with Linux 
&gt;	as part of my TAFE course last year and became hooked. I was taught linux by  
&gt;	Richard Russell. (hi rr)

I respect Richard because he's prepared to criticise me and present
fair reasons to do so. If you look through the list archives, you'll
probably find a number of times where he and I have disagreed with
each other but unlike some he actually makes sense.

[NOTE TO RICHARD: This doesn't mean I agree with you though ;-P ]

My advice is be brazen; I started my career in Linux by sendind an e-mail
to one of the list members basically saying I have no experience but I'm
willing to learn. It took a while for something to materialise but I haven't
looked back since.

Don't concentrate on the negatives, concentrate on what you have to offer
and make sure you can convincingly state that you'll either learn the stuff
you don't know through your work experience or that you'll consider studies
further.

And don't ignore the "Job Posts" that require experience; sometimes it
takes experience to put an application together. Put it together as best
you can ANYWAY; if you want be really blatant about not having experience
but make sure that you are noticed.

For example, a letter stating that "I notice you have a Linux position offered,
I'm looking for experience blah blah blah blah" to potential employers,
in my opinion, can't hurt.

The world is *your* oyster; go get it :-)

	BTW David Lloyd 
	According to Genesis 9:1 "... Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the 
	earth."
	**Sex is NOT evil**

I would tend to agree...but you don't quote the full context...

;-P
