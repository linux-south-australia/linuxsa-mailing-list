Regardless of the fact that Apple have thsee things (and are one of
the very few vendors that do), it still does not change the fact that,
when it comes to restoring your system, a Mac is lightyears ahead of
the nearest competitor.

Not even the "quick" restore CDs that Compaq can provide with servers
are this simple. Really, it's true.

&gt; ...and I'll make [ FreeBSD, Windows, MacOS, Linux, BeOS, DSL-OS,
&gt; WOTEVER-OS ] work just like you describe:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If the Mac breaks (as in, for whatever reason, needs a complete
&gt; &gt; reinstall), you just stick a CD, reboot it and press a few buttons.
&gt; &gt; It's all pretty simple. Linux still isn't that simple -- neither is
&gt; &gt; Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Trying to compare OS for usability is prone to being subjective. How
&gt; does one define "usable" anyway? A system setup so my mother (who is a
&gt; computer-illiterate dolt but she can now at least work out how to send
&gt; e-mails using Hotmail under Windows) is comfortable is totally unusable
&gt; for my work...for a start it would have the wrong OS on it. Systems that
&gt; boot up to XDM are pains if you ask me, therefore if you include "the
&gt; experience doesn't unsettle you" then any Unix machine where the login
&gt; goes directly to XDM/KDM/GDM is a little less usable for me...

If it's easy to pick up and learn, then I think you get a fairly good
mark for usability. Apple have put a lot of time and effort into
making sure that their product is easy to use for people like your
Mother.

It plays music during the installation procedure. It even shows you
how to use the mouse (if, after a period of time, you haven't worked
out what do to with it). That makes the experience stress free and
lets the user spend more time actually /using/ the computer.

&gt; In my humble opinion, pick whatever OS suits; for my mother (to take
&gt; that example again), I would probably choose Windows because that's what
&gt; she's being taught, other friends near her (she's not within an hour's
&gt; driving distance of me -- lives in country) can help her out because
&gt; they "understand" the operating system and its quirks and she can go
&gt; into any newsagent, pick up any magazine and the CD stuck to the cover
&gt; will probably be useful to her...

I agree. It just seems that Apple do a bloody good job of providing a
total solution that is far easier to use than any other member of the
competition.

&gt; *why would she want the latest version of Apache [ for example ] -- but
&gt; she may be interested in the latest version of IE or wotever*

Err, yes. Pick and choose. I don't quite understand what you mean
here, though.
