&gt;  &gt; a) If you were an ant I would squash you for sending me HTML
&gt;  &gt; e-mail....(grrr)
&gt; 
&gt; tee hee!  What are you whinging about anyway?  Your mailer reads
&gt; HTML.  Sorry about the extra packet or two....

My mailer sometimes renders HTML.

I reckon, looking at the headers, that your Outlook IS actually behaving
itself but your Exchange server is converting your text anyway. The HTML
e-mail I'm seeing isn't rendered as though by Outlook...

&gt; Doesn't anti-spam software just identify email as being spam?  You'd
&gt; still have to download it to find that out, yes?

Yes, but it needn't be.

For example, the ISP could just stop it.

&gt; 80 spam messages seems like a lot.  I'd advise against submitting your
&gt; address for "free porn in your email every day!" ;-)

I don't; 80 spam messages in 2000 e-mails that I downloaded (icck) isn't
really that bad considering. And I am on a lot of mailing lists and I do
post a lot so my e-mail address is probably on every harvest engine
available...

*sigh*
