Hi.

For me, the point is that I would be unlikely to play upgrades on a safety
of life service - I would look for a kernel that supplied the required
functionality and go with it. 

Once a system is devised for a particular use, and is focussed on it,
there is very little reason for upgrade. New requirements will break old
systems, but aren't these generally complete lifecycle upgrades?

Just because redHat offers a kernel upgrade, why would I load it on my
safety-of-life system? I have the functionality I need in the current
kernel, I wouldn't expose such a system to the internet (or perhaps any
network) would I?

What is it about linux uptimes that needs improving? Some of our systems
run for well over a year at a time, and usually the only reason they get a
bounce is hardware failure, extended power failure or location change. Our
Win 2k servers start to get flakey and suffer performance degredation
after a couple of months - some admins are recomending monthly bounces for
all Win2k systems.

As an aside, 5 minutes is a long time for a reboot cycle, we typically
have network back up and running under 2 minutes, 90 seconds is typical on
our pentium systems. (watching the gap on a ping session)

Perhaps I'm missing the point about safety-of-life systems. Can you quote
an example?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Linux uptimes are slowly getting better, but are nowhere near good
&gt; enough.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's say you need to run a safety of life service.  The typical figure
&gt; for that is 5 minutes of "scheduled outage with no service impact" per
&gt; annum.
&gt; 
&gt; Red Hat Linux has had now many kernel upgrades (each requiring a
&gt; five minute reboot) this year?
&gt; 
&gt; Note that running redundant servers usually moves the problem to
&gt; another platform, which isn't a great help.  DNS is an exception
&gt; here --  the redundancy is designed into the protocol and is
&gt; implemented by the client.
