Question:  what happened to the FUD from MS saying that the community
model of open source was a "danger" to the future of software...........??

Are there any features of Linux that Microsoft would like to adopt?
&lt;snip&gt;
There are two things we've learned from Linux. 
First, there's a lot to be said for the community model. 
You need to bring customers and developers together. 
If you don't bring them together, you end up learning 
where your holes are a year or two after you ship. 
&lt;snip&gt;
The Linux community gets quick feedback from people. 
On the technology side, Linux is a kernel, and then 
there are services that plug into that kernel. 
For example, Samba is a file server that runs on the kernel, 
or there is a Web server that runs on the kernel. 
They don't integrate much. They plug in. 
With Windows we've always had this interconnected set of processes. 
You touch something over here, and you feel it over there. 
We believe customers would like products from us that deploy 
in a more componentized profile. 
&lt;snip&gt;
Today with Windows 2000, there are services that are running 
that don't need to be. 
&lt;snip&gt;
