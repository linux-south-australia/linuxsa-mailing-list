Actually I think it is a sound idea.  The only main thing to work on is
marketing, It's the one thing many Linux people I know fail to do well.
If we have learned one thing from Microsoft, it's marketing pays.

Take a leaf out of IIT's approach, it markets as far and wide as
possible, and runs courses in all States.

My own thoughts though would be to limit the desktop training to Sun's
StarOffice 6.0  (speak to Sun for official support?)and Evolution.

Just my 0.2c worth.

&gt; If I were to develop a course entitled "Linux on the Desktop" which
&gt; encompassed subjects such as:
&gt; 
&gt; * Word processing
&gt; * Spreadsheet
&gt; * Basic drawing applications
&gt; * Presentations
&gt; * Sending and receiving e-mail
&gt; 
&gt; ...would there be a desire for such a course? That is to say, a course
&gt; which taught the "Office Stable" but not with Microsoft Office...
&gt; 
&gt; I can say now it would be similarly priced to other courses (I do have
&gt; to eat), but if there were enough people asking for it, it's possible
&gt; you might get an accredited training authority [i.e. one that is
&gt; actually recognised such as the WEA, University Community Education
&gt; Programmes and such] willing to approve such a course.
&gt; 
&gt; My point is this: you might ASK for such a course in schools,
&gt; universities and other learning institutions, but are you, as a student,
&gt; willing to take the courses?
