Hi.

I second the suggestion of a laser. We do quite a lot of printing at home
on an old LaserWriter, and it costs us about $100 every couple of years
for a toner cart. The colour inkjet we have does a few kids projects and
is chewing through over $100 worth of ink a year. I wouldn't be scared of
buying a good secondhand laser from a reputable dealer either. You land up
with a higher spec machine with more robust internals than a cheapie new
machine for the same money.

You also land up spending more time futzing with the inkjet to solve it's
inherent nozzle clogs and paper feed problems.

I think Lexmark now has an inkjet on the market that costs less than it's
replacement ink cartridges. that just confirms my suspicions about the
business plan of the inkjet mastubfacturers.

regards,

Michael

&gt; Can't say, but in my experience Hewlett Packard printers are pretty well
&gt; supported under Linux (from way back, both my inkjet and laserjet
&gt; worked).  HP now have their own Linux driver project too, which is a
&gt; bonus.  AFIK, Canon are... um.. a$$holes when it comes to giving out the
&gt; tech specs on how to drive their hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The overwhelming majority of my printing is black and white text on plain A4 paper, 
&gt; 
&gt; Have you thought about a laser? I rekon for just BW test on plain A4
&gt; they're the cheapest option (a little more expensive initially) with
&gt; toner cartridges lasting almost forever.  My inkjet printer costs me a
&gt; small fortune to run, while my laser (which does most of the printing)
&gt; costs me next to nothing.  Just hang onto your colour printer for the
&gt; few times you do print colour...
&gt; 
&gt; Just a few (hopefully) helpful suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
