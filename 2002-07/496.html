Gripe...

I have two web cameras, neither work in Linux right now, at least for me 
at my skill level. (not much.... :-) )

A friend of mine used to tout "the difference between the ordinary and 
the extraordinary is that little extra"

So I already know that Linux has a lot of the little extra already, but 
when it comes to periferals, it seems to have "a little less" at least 
for me.

Wanting it to have "a little extra" I keep coming back to the idea of 
funneling money into Linux through not for profit organizations that 
would pay developers to create Free/Open Source software.

It wouldn't be too difficult to do, and if I were involved I would 
contribute my services as a CPA to help gain non profit status. On a 
limited basis, but as much as humanly possible of course.

Questions:

1. Would this be a good or bad thing?
2. Is this already in place?
3. If it is in place, can it be advertised more agressively?
