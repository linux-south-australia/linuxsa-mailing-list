Attention all people who have had any experience with backup systems!
:)

We here at work are going to upgrade our backup system, and by jingoes,
I've been having quite an interesting ride engulfing all of this
information.  When it comes to "mega backup" systems, I have not had a
great deal of hands-on experience.

We presently back up to DAT tapes on a SONY STD-10000 SCSI Drive.  The
box is running Windows 2000 Server, running Backup Exec 8.0.  The whole
system is completely unreliable and totally hopeless with backups
consistently failing.  We are about to increase our online storage
capacity (to about 200Gb) with the purchase of a new file server, and to
complement it, we need to replace our failing backup system.

I have been looking into the Ultrium standard which would appear to be
the way backup technology is heading.  If this is the case, what are
people out in the real world using?  I have read the DAT technology has
been "end-of-life'd" so I do not see much point in going with it.

Ultimately the system will work something like this:

MAIN FILE SERVER:		Holds majority of our data (~200Gb)
				Running *nix (most likely FreeBSD)

BACKUP DEVICE:		Detatched (independent)
				Communicate via SCSI to Main File Server
				Compatible with FreeBSD / Linux

BACKUP SYSTEM:		Managed by Main File Server
				Possibly running Amanda
(<A HREF="http://www.amanda.org">http://www.amanda.org</A>) or something similar, as yet undecided
				Able to backup over SAMBA

BUDGET:			$10,000 (with an $8,000 target)


As it stands I'm getting pretty tired of this Windows based system
falling all over itself, and I'd like to get something reliable
happening.  Unfortunately I have zero experience in looking for a
kick-ass backup system, and so I'm calling in advice to find out what
options people recommend me to go and explore.  I'd like to know what
other people are running in their corporate environments.

Any directions?  I'm going in pretty blind here, and by the end of it
I'd love to come out all sweet, rosy and happy.


Regards,
