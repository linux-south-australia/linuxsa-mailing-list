I don't have an entire PC, but i've got a bunch of old harddrives and a 
pentium 166 CPU you can have if you like?

By the way, when I was at a festival early this year, I had a chat to a 
hippy girl who was moderately fluent with Linux, but had never seen 
Windows. Why? Because she had been given the PC by Computerbank and it 
came pre-installed with a Linux distro. (I think it might have been an 
interstate version of computerbank tho')

Anyway.. I just thought that was nice in several ways.

(and I wish my first PC had been running Linux.. dos was icky :/   )

&gt; linux - the avg being p166 with 64mb ram, 2gb hdd, cdrom IF we have any, and
