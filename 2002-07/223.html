If you happen to want to give me:

* a computer equipment manufacturing plant
* a stranglehold on all the peripherals to connect to my equipment
  [ and a userbase who accepts that if they install third part,
non-approved rubbish on it, it's likely to not work]
* a relatively large user base willing to actually PAY for the OS
  [ the OS can be free but not as in beer ]
*  marketing department

...and I'll make [ FreeBSD, Windows, MacOS, Linux, BeOS, DSL-OS,
WOTEVER-OS ] work just like you describe:

&gt; If the Mac breaks (as in, for whatever reason, needs a complete
&gt; reinstall), you just stick a CD, reboot it and press a few buttons.
&gt; It's all pretty simple. Linux still isn't that simple -- neither is
&gt; Windows.

Trying to compare OS for usability is prone to being subjective. How
does one define "usable" anyway? A system setup so my mother (who is a
computer-illiterate dolt but she can now at least work out how to send
e-mails using Hotmail under Windows) is comfortable is totally unusable
for my work...for a start it would have the wrong OS on it. Systems that
boot up to XDM are pains if you ask me, therefore if you include "the
experience doesn't unsettle you" then any Unix machine where the login
goes directly to XDM/KDM/GDM is a little less usable for me...

In my humble opinion, pick whatever OS suits; for my mother (to take
that example again), I would probably choose Windows because that's what
she's being taught, other friends near her (she's not within an hour's
driving distance of me -- lives in country) can help her out because
they "understand" the operating system and its quirks and she can go
into any newsagent, pick up any magazine and the CD stuck to the cover
will probably be useful to her...

*why would she want the latest version of Apache [ for example ] -- but
she may be interested in the latest version of IE or wotever*
