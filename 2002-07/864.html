&gt; &gt; There are still a lot of older servers out there where emacs will take ten

&gt; As I demonstrated in another mail, this isn't the case.
&gt; 
&gt; These days, a P233 is give-away material.

Yes it is, but when a company has a working, reliable, server, they don't 
see any reason to replace it. In the last few years I've worked on several 
machines in the 386, 486 and Pentium (&lt;100 mhz) range, which were running 
as firewalls, file and mail servers.

The other issue is memory -- even on a P200, if you've got 10+ users and 
only 32 or 64 mb of ram, you'll run into swap with everyone using emacs. 
vi on the other hand goes fine.


&gt; Ahh but when I use dozens of different machines, many of which I may not
&gt; even have a home directory on to call mine, I like the default behaviour
&gt; to be predictable and sensible.

The defaults for vim and emacs vary from distro to distro and version to 
version - you shouldn't be relying on a particular default for either 
really?

&gt; 
&gt; That said, I don't use emacs on remote machines. I use vi for almost all
&gt; system maintainance tasks.
&gt; 
&gt; I use emacs when I'm going to be playing with a file for more than a few
&gt; seconds. IE coding.
&gt; 
&gt; I have nothing against vi at all, I use it a lot.  I think it's powerful
&gt; and fast. It's always there, it works consistently.

I just like vim.. i guess its one of those eternal arguments which just 
comes down to personal preference.. or perhaps the way the brain works.. 
who knows.. doesn't really matter too much..  well, except that you're 
forbidden from complaining that emacs isn't installed on my machines :D

&gt; 
&gt; My only beef is about the whole 'emacs is bloatware' argument. Used to
&gt; be true, isn't any more.
&gt; 

It's not a big deal any more, but that's only because modern machines 
are extremely overpowered for simple tasks like editting text. Not that 
i'm complaining about that, you understand ;)
