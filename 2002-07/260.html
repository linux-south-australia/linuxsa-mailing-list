&gt; &gt; ...it is possible that the transaction is way too large to unroll I
&gt; &gt; guess (I hadn't thought of that -- does Postgres keep the transaction in
&gt; &gt; memory until you commit it which would give this type of behaviour)...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure where Postgres keeps its uncommitted transactions these
&gt; days, but that could be the problem.  Do you specifically need
&gt; transaction semantics?  Note that it does pay to do a batch of
&gt; inserts within a transaction, because this speeds up the inserts
&gt; no end (at least, this used to be the case - I haven't tried it on
&gt; recent Postgres's's to see if that's changed).

I've started investigating Postgres because of its transaction
capabilities.

This was clearly the problem because the moment I removed the BEGIN and
COMMIT, the import went perfectly although I will probably have to use
Perl and some time functions to get the timestamp to get it in ther.

Things I noticed:

1) Importing the data into MySQL didn't cause my disk to thrash (it's
not the quietest disk and I can hear it when it's going)
2) Importing the data into Postgres caused my disk to really go wild

Hypothesises [icck -- I wonder what the plural should be]:

i) MySQL doesn't sync data to the filesystem as often as Postgres
ii) Postgres tables require more disk fiddling than MyISAM tables

The import for MySQL also went a lot quicker.
