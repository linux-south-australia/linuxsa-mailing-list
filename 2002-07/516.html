&gt;&gt; What can I do to allow sendmail to let me send mail from any machine but
&gt;&gt; keep it from relaying spam? I can't seem to find the right balance!
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK, the only good way to do it is to allow all relaying for 
&gt; authenticated SMTP over SSL/TLS (which use use for for sending mail), 
&gt; but deny relaying for normal SMTP (which gets used for local delivery).

We use authenticated SMTP with TLS  and it works a treat.  Supported by
Pine, Mozilla, Communicator, Outlook.  Mozilla only likes it if you
establish a CA and load that root certificate.  Other software works
fine with standard self-signed certificates.

One advantage for schools is the end of faked messages from the
headmaster :-)

You can also easily configure IMAP to use only SSL.  WebDAV over
SSL is also a reasonable alternative to SMB in PPTP, this works
very nicely from Windows XP.  Linux's davfs is still sucky when
compared to smbfs.  Cadaver, a ftp-like client, works well.
Obviously SSH can replace Telnet.

The very nice result is that you can do all of your work out
of the office with exactly the same configuration as in the
office.  No more starting PPTP hassles.

The trust model has differing threats, but isn't worse for most
organisations than the normal PPTP trust model (where one
password grants access to all network services).

Also worthwhile is setting up DHCP and Dynamic DNS (configured
so the DHCP server updates the DNS server).  This lets you
bind DNS names to MAC addresses with the very nice result
that your machine has the same DNS name whereever you use it
within the organisation.
