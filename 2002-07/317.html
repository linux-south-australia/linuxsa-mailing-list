<H1>M$ taking over OpenGL?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
The Register, bless their cotton socks, have posted an article 
regarding Microsoft staking "an IP claim on portions of the 
OpenGL spec", this has quite disturbing potential consequenses 
for non-M$ based 3D graphics applications.

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26125.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26125.html</A>

here's the relevant and worrying sections,

"In January we revealed that Microsoft had acquired a chunk of 
SGI's graphics portfolio. At the time we mused if the Beast had a 
plan to scupper OpenGL.

This was taking paranoia too far, wise heads told us.

But in the minutes of the OpenGL developer meeting, it's clear 
that Microsoft has staked an IP claim on portions of the OpenGL 
spec, and it's willing to license it's patents on RAND terms.

"Microsoft believes they have patent rights relating to the 
ARB_vertex_program extension. They did not contribute to the 
extension, but are trying to be upfront about it. They're 
offering to license their IP under reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory terms; will license rights to the extent 
necessary, provided a reciprocal license is granted to MS. 
Granted on 1:1 basis for OpenGL 1.3, 1.4, and earlier versions. 
Contact Dave Aronson for more specifics ... Microsoft does 
believe they have IP claims against fragment shaders, too."

This gives the first public indication that hardware 
manufacturers are beginning to rub up against Microsoft's patent 
portfolio. Whether the Beast's goal is to kill OpenGL with 
kindness, or simply to let the GPU manufacturers know who's da 
boss, we don't know. The wording is misleadingly benign: 
non-discriminatory licenses are only non-discriminatory until 
there's some discrimination.

And right now it's too early to say. All we can see is the 
shark's fin.

But we'll be keeping our eyes on two patents filed by SGI - which 
created OpenGL - particularly this one and this one. If we 
discover that these have been assigned to Microsoft, it may be 
time to leave the beach entirely."
