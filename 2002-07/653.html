&gt; &gt; Um, what is wrong with CDE?? I have never tried it myself... but I found
&gt; &gt; XFCE the other week which is supposed to be almost a copy, and I loved

&gt; &gt; -- find the little terminal icon at the bottom left and there's access
&gt; &gt; to all your programs, hard to learn to use?? As long as you know the
&gt; &gt; basics of Linux *all* windowmanagers are easy -- some just piss you off

&gt; that's the problem.  People don't want to use the terminal - it's "DOS"
&gt; remember.  DOS died with Windows 95, so it must be outdated.  Therefore,
&gt; Unix is outdated because it still needs DOS.

Ah, I disagree with that.

Several times people have enquired what I'm doing when i'm working in a
terminal window. I've explained that its a command prompt like DOS, but
demonstrated the cool stuff you can do (ie. backgrounding tasks, swapping
between tasks, command-line editting/history/searching, process lists,
priorities, top, screen for even more cool stuff, etc). After this most
people think the Linux CLI is actually quite nifty.

DOS was horribly clunky by comparison! People who will judge something 
purely on that first glance are doing themselves a disfavour.


&gt; We forget that most of these people are simple in their nature (and
&gt; computer needs).  Force Linux on them and they'll use it. Give them a

I think many people are more intelligent than you give them credit for - 
The problem is just that people who've used windows for ages know all the 
shortcuts and ways to do things (or in the case of some ppl who don't 
understand, they just know the magic rituals to make things work)... But 
when you give them Linux they have to start all over again.

I believe that if you took a group of people who'd never used computers 
before, and gave half a new windows PC and the other half a new linux PC, 
and came back in 6 months, then you'd find each group was quite happy 
using the PC.

I reckon that if my old mother can figure out how to search the windows 
registry for strings related to a software bug, and attempt to fix them, 
then I'm fairly sure she'd be able to get her head around UNIX man pages 
and the /etc/ directory.

However her windows laptop works OK for her and she understands how to fix 
it when it breaks, and it took her years to get this far; as far as she's 
concerned, why waste the time to re-learn it all on Linux when Windows 
works OK for her? (Her work pays for the software, so thats not an issue)


It's not that people are simple and unable to learn linux -- its just that 
people are too busy, and those that aren't have other ideas about fun ways 
to spend their spare time.
