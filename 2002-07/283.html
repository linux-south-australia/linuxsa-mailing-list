Yep, the bit about only working on outgoing traffic caught me at first
too.. you need to use your internal interface(s) (eth0 and eth2 in my
case) instead. This means you then need a rule to shuttle the
internal-only traffic into the unregulated stream.

Figuring out how to shape cache misses and not cache hits turned into a
whole another problem on its own -- I sort-of got around this by setting
the proxy to a virtual IP address, and then I had the option of either
1) shaping user traffic from the proxy (which was an internal IP and would
otherwise have been unlimited)
or
2) shaping internet-&gt;proxy traffic, which would mean the proxy traffic
wouldn't hog bandwidth, but also meant that if everyone used the proxy
except 1 user, then that one user would get half the bandwidth and
everyone else would share the remaining half.

I contemplated setting up a virtual IP address for the proxy per user,
which would have worked perfectly, except that every user would have their
own personal proxy IP which would be confusing for them.
I suppose this could be got around by using transparent redirects on the
firewall, but by the time I got up to this stage I was thinking that the
old method of bandwidth allocation had been far easier to implement and
went out to get beer.*

Has anyone else ever worked out a neat or elegant solution for that?


I was using u32 matching rather than iptables marks, in the final version.
I started off with iptables marks too though, since i already understood
the way iptables worked.

(* The old bandwidth allocation method had been "if someone is using all
the bandwidth for a long time, their ethernet cable gets removed from the
switch." This tended to get the point across.)

&gt;
&gt; it all become much clearer when i read the line 'you can only shape outgoing
&gt; traffic' and it all fell into place.   i didn't have any joy from that
&gt; security focus thing, but found it easier in the advanced routing howto.
&gt; IPChains/IPTables chains marking then using tc to slow it down didn't work
&gt; for me.  as in i got it going with just tc and marking the IP in my tc
&gt; script.  the only limitation of that is that you can't (we'll i couldn't
&gt; figure it out) mark different ports on the same IP, so if you we're to do
&gt; that you'd need to mark with tables/chains and then do the tc thing..
&gt;
&gt; thought i'd post my script here for you to take a look if you're
&gt; interested....   so ava look at the bottom...  this seems to work, but i've
&gt; only enough understanding to look at someone elses example and have a crack.
&gt; seems to be limiting fine tho....
&gt;
&gt; for accounting purposes only, i found that ipac was brilliant,  just a
&gt; simple conf file with very easy rules and it just sits on top of iptables
&gt; with a bit of a database to record should the iptables totals become
&gt; zeroed//
&gt;
&gt; anyway i think that it's all going nicley now...
&gt;
&gt; thanks for feedback people.

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; &gt; just been bending my brain around this Traffic Control stuff, and i read
&gt; at
&gt; &gt; the bottom of <A HREF="http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:">http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:</A>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway back to banging my head against my Advanced Routing Howto.  Anybody
&gt; &gt; can explain to me what the crock half of this stuff means?  :)
&gt;
&gt; I feel your pain.. That stuff took me ages to figure out.
&gt;
&gt; it seems to work well once you've done it though. What in particular did
&gt; you want to do? I might be able to help out with some recipes.
&gt;
&gt; (My use was "stop housemates using all the bandwidth" - then telstra
&gt; capped us anyway, and the problem became accounting, instead of shaping)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Something that might help you, is to imagine that you've got a cascading
&gt; pyramid fountain thing. Like, lots of troughs which overflow into some of
&gt; the ones below them. Then imagine that the water for the fountain is
&gt; either poured into the top trough, or else you can insert some of it into
&gt; other troughs directly. Now expand on the analogy by imagining that the
&gt; troughs are different sizes, so some take longer than others to overflow.
&gt;
&gt; Got that? I don't know how much it'll help your understanding of traffic
&gt; shaping, but its a pretty soothing mental image, and might help you get to
&gt; sleep after fighting 'tc' all day.
&gt;
