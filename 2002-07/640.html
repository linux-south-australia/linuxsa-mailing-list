&gt; Um, what is wrong with CDE?? I have never tried it myself... but I found
&gt; XFCE the other week which is supposed to be almost a copy, and I loved
&gt; it (until I found FluxBox the other day...). It's just a window manager
&gt; -- find the little terminal icon at the bottom left and there's access
&gt; to all your programs, hard to learn to use?? As long as you know the
&gt; basics of Linux *all* windowmanagers are easy -- some just piss you off
&gt; more than others.

Yeah i've got xfce, dont use it much, but it looks kinda nice, good for an old 
computer. But CDE is ugly, inflexible, hard to switch between windows, etc... 
Also, the way they've set it up, it's not obvious what desktop apps are 
available, we generally load stuff from the command line. I dont mind using 
it (once we learnt the trick to turn focus follows mouse off!), but it 
certainly doesn't entice people to use a "unix clone" at home, unless they're 
doing a programming topic, even then...

I'm not a window manager zealot, my dream really is to see everyone with the 
same base OS (linux) or compatible OS (eg bsd), then they can run any window 
manager on top they like. I always find it interesting to see how people have 
set up their linux/bsd boxes, they're all different... 

Damien
