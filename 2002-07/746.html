Forget all rational explanations and etc.

The real problem is that God is a Cricket fan, and mistook Shane for 
someone else :-)

&gt; &gt; I am sure those who have the right knowledge will ask the right questions to 
&gt; &gt; get the information they require to diagnose a situation. =)
&gt; 
&gt; My apologies! I completely forgot that you sent the question in the
&gt; first place... thought you were just taking the chance to have a go at
&gt; someone without offering information, when it was you seeking
&gt; information in the first place... my head hurts too much thinking.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; office, web based mail service etc.  I received an email at a client site 
&gt; &gt; which had a word document attached.  When I checked the email out at my home 
&gt; 
&gt; Did you check whether the attachment was intact when received at the
&gt; client site? Could be useful in determining where along the line it got
&gt; corrupted.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; office, KDE Mail reported an attachment which I was able to save, but word 
&gt; &gt; wouldn't recognise it as a word document, therefore I assume it was corrupted 
&gt; &gt; somehow when it came through my server.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps it is just word being not nice? ;-) I don't really know what I'm
&gt; talking about here so all I can do is throw a few suggestions that
&gt; probably won't work, but someone else might be able to help more.
