&gt; No I am going by what I have read, I got that information from a story I read
&gt; on the web some time ago, but i dont remember the link. From what other
&gt; people have said about TAFE courses I think I was on the right track. If you
&gt; have solid information about a _desktop_ linux/unix focus in TAFE courses,
&gt; i'd like to hear about it.

It's possible that someone could write a "Desktop Linux" module and
integrate it into a TAFE but only if one could convince the TAFE that
the course would be actually useful in the real world. But "Desktop
Linux" doesn't exist in a great majority of work places so there's a
chicken and egg problem...

&gt; &gt; &gt; window open connecting to a windows terminal server. Unix is portrayed as
&gt; &gt; &gt; some confusing hacker environment with no place on a home computer.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So what; if I bothered about what people called me (geek, gook, slopey
&gt; &gt; eye and other interesting things) I'd have given up years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Um. what? I don't understand how racism is related to people not liking unix.

LOL - my point is that people continuously portray unix as "some
confusing hacker environment", where hacker really means cracker as
opposed to someone who is genuinely interrested in working out how
something works for self-development or to improve the tool, and that I
really don't care that they think that. It gives me time to work out how
to make a robust system as opposed to a pretty GUI that is easy to use
but unstable.

&gt; I didn't mean to start an argument. When I said u missed my point, i was
&gt; implying that I did not explain myself properly, which is often the case. I
&gt; did not intend to insult you or anything  :)

I don't have an argumentative bone in my body...
