Thanks all for the Input !

In reply to Richards Comments:
----------------------------

&gt;However, you should be able to achieve something like 75% or so of the max
&gt;atainable at 100Mb/s (around 10MB/s).

Yes this was my thoughts exactly, if I can reach a sustained 8-9Mbyte/s I
would be perfectly happy.  It is just these 2Gb files where I am suffering
greatly, otherwise you I normally dont notice.

&gt;Secondly, Windows does lots of funny things on the wire, and unless you
&gt;write some special programs, you have to wait for the data to hit the
&gt;disk (buffers) before you ask for more, so it might not even be capable of
&gt;driving a 100Mb/s link to saturation.

I was aware that Win98se is a bit screwy on what comes out the network
port, I might remove these boxes from the equation and use the Win2k
box.... jury is still out.

&gt;Make sure the server is the bottleneck first. You can do this by grabbing
&gt;a packet trace and looking at the delay between one request completing and
&gt;the next one issuing.

Good Points !  I will see what I can capture with a terminal dump from the
switch.

&gt;I have recently committed some code that does allow you do generate CIFS
&gt;load, called cifs-load-gen, that will allow you to explore these things.
&gt;
&gt;You can also use the load generator to check what the system is capable
&gt;of. Tests I did last year with 750MHz Duron with 1GB running either 2.4.7
&gt;or FreeBSD 4.4 suggests that it takes about 10 clients running netbench
&gt;to saturate a 100Mb/s link. The load generator can get you reading or
&gt;writing files, and that may allow you to go hell for leather.

Is thje cifs-load-gen in the current samba code ?  I looked at my version
and 2.2.0a is probably getting a little stale, have swiped 2.2.5 down from
the samba site so I will compile this and give it ago.   I have considered
using FreeBSD 4.5 for the machine but will stick with linux for a little
longer (learning curve thing).

In Reply to Glen's Comments:
--------------------------
&gt;You actually want a fair bit of idle CPU.  If you don't have
&gt;any idle CPU than Samba will need to wait behind other processes
&gt;before it gets it's allocation of CPU time.  If the other processes
&gt;are CPU-bound Samba might end up waiting 0.005s per packet.  The
&gt;jargon for this is the "run queue length" and some utilities
&gt;will display that.

Agreed, but with the double buffering of the information through the kernel
it is a good indication of smbd load on the system.   Richard I think is
right in that the Win client is possibly not able to generate enough load.
I think top from memory will sort the processes according to "run queue
length", will check this out.

&gt;You might find the 'bonnie' disk benchmarking program useful
&gt;for tracking server bottlenecks.  Look at the 'sequential
&gt;output - block' figure and the 'random seeks - per sec'
&gt;figures.
&gt;
&gt;Your client I/O traffic will usually be a mix of these, the
&gt;number of seeks will increase more than proportionately with
&gt;the number of clients (the more users, the greater the odds
&gt;that the disk head will need to be moved to satisfy the request).

Will STW and see if I can find this, ideally I would like to monitor the
Mb/s from the ethernet card but the load placed on the system by these
packages downgrades performance significantly.  I have tried ethereal,
iptraf and a couple of others, they typically chew 15-30% of the cpu load
which is less than ideal for bench marking.   The IPMeter package looks
very interesting but uses an external BSD box to do the monitoring, haven't
got that many spare boxes around the place :(

&gt;High-end servers come with 10,000RPM disks, explicitly to get
&gt;the head movement time down.  This is professional kit, so
&gt;simply use the fastest disks you can reasonably find (say
&gt;7200 rather than 5400).
&gt;
&gt;If you use IDE then set the hdparm and idebus= settings optimally
&gt;for your hardware.

Know these commands well, hdparm -T /dev/x gives me 15-17Mbyte/s sequential
read performance levels on the ATA66 controller from both drives.   Will
check the random seek performance with bonnie.  Both drives are 7200rpm
models, I am going to get an ATA100 controller so the benefits of 7200rpm
should become apparent then.

&gt;Use the ext2 or xfs filesystems.  The others suck for file
&gt;serving applications, as you would expect from their design
&gt;goals.

Ext2 is my current choice, Not sure if I trust XFS for this machine yet,
not a big fan of patching kernals and tools for xfs support.   I still have
a reasonable ammount of data on this machine that I would prefer not to
have to reload from backup.

&gt;Make sure you have a fair whack of RAM.  A lot of the user I/O
&gt;requests should be cachable.  There is also a cache on the disks
&gt;themselves,  If you are buying more IDE disk, try for a 8MB cache
&gt;rather than the standard 2MB cache.  Fiddle with the disk pre-
&gt;fetching parameters to make this cache work best for your I/O
&gt;mix.

I have stuffed 768Mb of ram in this machine, 512M is the peak physical i
have seen used.  I am sure it can max it out but haven't observed so yet.

The latest drive is a WD800JB drive, on the ATA66 controller I see a
2Mbyte/s improvement over the WD400BB drive sequential throughput
performance. Migrating this to ATA100 I hope to see a bigger performance
improvement.

&gt;If you have a UPS, consider enabling write caching on the disk.
&gt;A single-machine UPS will set you back about $200, so this might
&gt;be a cheap way to improve throughput.

Little 200VA unit attached and write caching already enabled, this gave a
15% improvement in writes to the box, which now means that up and down are
very similar in terms of throughput.

&gt;Finally, start a log book and keep the benchmark results in
&gt;the book.  You'll find them very handy.

A really good piece of advice that one !   I started my log book the day I
loaded Slackware 8.0 onto the machine the first time.   It is great to take
one step forward, end up two steps back... read the log book and figure out
where to go next.

Anyway I will keep plodding along, at least I have a few more ideas where
to continue looking.   The machine for all its quirks has been extremely
reliable and stable running linux for the last 18 months, not having much
say in the hardware when I got the machine (insurance wrangle) was a pain,
but it seems to have straightened itself out.

Regards

Matthew
