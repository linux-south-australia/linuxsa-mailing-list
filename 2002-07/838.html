&gt; Hi Robyn,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Our project is just starting and we are throwing around ideas,
&gt; brainstorming, etc.

Hmmm, but what will you do to stop the representative from Intuit et al 
from proposing legislation to prevent free tax prep software from being 
used to submit tax returns?
 
&gt; But I can tell you what, I would bet that there are some core & common
&gt; principles of taxation shared between between Australia and the U.S. -
&gt; and to me all that means is that the programming code can be shared in
&gt; some way. Maybe its total interest or total wages, capital gains or self
&gt; employemnt income. (I don't know what to call them, libraries?)  The
&gt; program is being written in Perl, I hope that it would be useable by
&gt; all.
&gt; 
&gt; Since we have 50 states plus a federal government to produce forms for
&gt; here in the U.S., I am sure that one of them has parts of it that looks
&gt; kinds like one of the forms in Australia...
&gt; 
&gt; I hope - although I am not runnig the project, that we will have
&gt; different people all over the place sharing and maintaining pieces of
&gt; unique taxation all over the place, including Australia.
&gt; 
&gt; As I understand it Perl can run in Windows, and I would be more than
&gt; happy to talk with him about the types of calculations that can be
&gt; shared in the program.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One last thing. I am not a programmer myself. Some other guys are
&gt; working on it, I am going to do mey best to make sure the calculations
&gt; comes out right.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the mean time and in the next few weeks, I am hopefully going to get
&gt; to a point that I have made "SSGTBASOTAWNWGB" (Simple Sambas Guide) as
&gt; good as I can get it.
&gt; 
&gt; Best and thank you,
&gt; 
&gt;

&gt;   &gt; Hi
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; Can your tax program run on Windows and will it work with Australian tax
&gt;   &gt; rules?
&gt;   &gt;
&gt;   &gt; I can ask my tax accountant friend if you need help with the Aussie
&gt;   &gt; stuff.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; After some expirimentation, I got Lotus Organizer 6 to work in Linux,
&gt;   &gt; &gt; using Codeweavers cross over office 1.1.  Internet Explorer and Office
&gt;   &gt; &gt; was already installed, and I instaled organizer from within the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; "Organize" directory, selecting "Install.exe". If you select setup 
&gt; from
&gt;   &gt; &gt; /, it will fail.
&gt;   &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; When I installed I selected the program file only.
&gt;   &gt; &gt;
&gt;   &gt; &gt; I will give more details later, now I am off to bed.

&gt;   &gt; &gt; P.S. I am starting help a few Perl programmers that are working on the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; tenfourty program, which will help USIANS pay their personal income
&gt; tax.
&gt;   &gt; &gt; The project is just opening up, and I am the bridge between the
&gt;   &gt; &gt; programmers and the tax law... Before I get into that too deep, I hope
&gt;   &gt; &gt; to add some more  information to the Samba beginner's guide soon...
