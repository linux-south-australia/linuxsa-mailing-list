Exactly. It makes me wonder what M$ have made people think about a lot
of unix things. Like your example of dos. When windows people think CLI,
they think dos which is a pain to use.  They dont make the connection
that a nice shell is heaps better and easier. Same goes for some
protocols like telnet. How long did M$ have a broken implementation that
reported ANSI then didnt work properly? Having to type export TERM=vt100
every time sucks, and it makes the unix machine look broken.

Ive been thinking about this problem though. I think what linux needs is
a disto for the desktop that tryes to do primarily the things office
people want their workstation to do. Things like word processing,
browsing, groupware type stuff. If you categorised these needs down,
then went looking for an app that did what the windows equivalents do, I
think you'd find 3/4 of the stuff exists. Then if you got some publicity
with that people would probably start filling in the gaps. When they got
there, then you'd have your nice simple OS that windows people can use.
They dont want a choice in GUI, or this or that or anything. They just
want plain and simple intuative tools to do their work. Perhaps said
distro could even have a team working on modifiying GUIs to make it
conform to a standard. The apps are almost there, it just needs to be
pulled together a bit tighter to lessen the learning curve for those
that dont care.

&gt; that's the problem.  People don't want to use the terminal - it's "DOS"
&gt; remember.  DOS died with Windows 95, so it must be outdated.  Therefore,
&gt; Unix is outdated because it still needs DOS.
&gt; 
&gt; We forget that most of these people are simple in their nature (and
&gt; computer needs).  Force Linux on them and they'll use it. Give them a
&gt; choice and they'll choose Windows every time because it's "modern".  It
&gt; has a pretty interface and it's just there - they don't have to think.
