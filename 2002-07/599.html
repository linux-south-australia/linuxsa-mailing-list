LaM: Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?

R: Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that resembles what
you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The market is not driven by
a technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its crashes a few times
a day. Users don't (mostly) care. They just reboot and get on with it. They
want apps. If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose.
Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to
nice areas (video production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core
now will probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to
see Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the apps
are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This is where
the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.

LaM: Where do you think the future ought to lie for desktop Linux?

R: There is none. The future for Linux for anything that isn't a headless
server in a back room tirelessly serving out data and services all day long
is on the device market, from PDA to phone to watch.
