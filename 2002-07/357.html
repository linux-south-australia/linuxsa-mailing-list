Those numbers ring a bell.. 4GB was a limitation of earlier versions of
FAT and 8GB was tied to the 1024 cylinder issue associated with CHS bios
access. The one where you need an OS running to go past 1024 so it was 
the bootloaders that suffered most.
Its been a while since I played with this stuff, but I'd suggest you try
make a small boot partition at the front of the disk for NTldr and
hopefully you can create what ever partitions you like after that.
yeah - its a long shot! :)

&gt; 
&gt; I have a LICENCED version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0, and seeing I
&gt; bought a 40Gb drive I decided to install it on my other computer. The
&gt; drive is a Western Digital 7200 RPM drive with nothing special about it
&gt; but NT only detects it as 8032Mb, says that the maximum NTFS partition
&gt; can be 8032Mb and then when I type in 8032Mb it complains the partition
&gt; is too large.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried setting the drive to be LBA and NORMAL but neither seem to
&gt; fix the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I then gave up and decided to install FreeBSD 4.4RC3 [ I know, I'm
&gt; getting 4.6 very soon now ] and it installed without a problem. It
&gt; wouldn't boot at first but changing the drive setting to LBA and redoing
&gt; the installation fixed that problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Just out of interest, is there any reason why NT can only see 8Gb of a
&gt; 40Gb drive?
