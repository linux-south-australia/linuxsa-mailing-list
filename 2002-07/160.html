Hi There,
    Before you make such a rash decision, I would ask a
couple of questions first -

    a)    Have they used Windows, MacOS or Linux before?
    b)    What are they going to do with it?

    The reason I would ask the first question is that if
they have never used any system before, then the learning
curve for the system will be just as steep whichever one you
use from a users perspective. I would also point out a USERS
perspective, because I assume that you are going to set it
up for them, and also if it does "break" then you will be
fixing it. I also assume that you will probably end up
installing any new software on it, so it will probably end
up as some kind of administered system anyhow.

    This leads on to the next question of what will they do
with it? Looking at some of the user ready out of the box
systems like Suse, which comes with a reasonable desktop
setup and Star Office and Netscape, I would feel quite
comfortable in offering this to a beginner as long as they
were only a user, and not trying to administer the system as
well.

    Providing that all they want to do is surf, read news
and/or mail, write letters and maybe balance the cheque
book, there is no real reason why you couldn't just use
Linux. Distributions like Suse now set up most basic or old
systems straight out of the box, and with Linux, it is hard
for a User to break it. Suse also provides about everything
a basic user needs out of the box. Why go for an "exotic"
fix when all you need is a good sturdy solution that is hard
for a beginner to break. If they want to go beyond basic
use, tell them that they are using cutting edge technology
and they will probably get a real kick out of it. Hope this
has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: [OT] MacOS for PC


&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; I am intending to give my retired parents a pc so they can
use the net. But,
&gt; I don't really want to give them a box with MS Windows on
it. I fear I may
&gt; be around there more often than I like. I think that a
linux box may be a
&gt; bit to complicated for beginners. I was thinking about
buying them a Mac,
&gt; but that seems rather silly seeing I have 2 pc's at home I
am not using.
&gt; Besides, if I bought a Mac I would keep it for myself.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know if there is a version of MacOS that runs
on an intel based
&gt; pc ?
&gt;
&gt; Alternatively, is there any Mac shops that sell second
hand imacs ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Wayne
