&gt; Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 released                           <A HREF="mailto:press@debian.org">press@debian.org</A>
&gt; July 19th, 2002                 <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/News/2002/20020719">http://www.debian.org/News/2002/20020719</A>
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; The Debian Project is pleased to announce the release of Debian GNU/Linux
&gt; version 3.0.  Debian GNU/Linux is a free operating system, which now
&gt; supports a total of eleven processor architectures, includes KDE and GNOME
&gt; desktop environments, features cryptographic software, is compatible
&gt; with the FHS v2.2 and supports software developed for the LSB.
&gt;
&gt; With the addition of the IA-64 (ia64), HP PA-RISC (hppa), MIPS (mips,
&gt; mipsel), and S/390 (s390) architectures, Debian GNU/Linux now supports a
&gt; total of eleven architectures.  It now runs on computers ranging from
&gt; palmtops to supercomputers, and nearly everything in between, including
the
&gt; latest generation of 64 bit machines.
&gt;
&gt; This is the first version of Debian that features cryptographic software
&gt; integrated into the main distribution.  OpenSSH and GNU Privacy Guard are
&gt; included in the default installation, and strong encryption is now present
&gt; in web browsers and web servers, databases, and so forth.  Further
&gt; integration of cryptographic software is planned for future releases.
&gt;
&gt; For the first time, Debian comes with the K Desktop Environment 2.2 (KDE).
&gt; The GNOME desktop environment is upgraded to version 1.4, and X itself is
&gt; upgraded to the much improved XFree86 4.1.  With the addition of several
&gt; full-featured free graphical web browsers in the form of Mozilla, Galeon,
&gt; and Konqueror, Debian's desktop offerings have radically improved.
&gt;
&gt; This version of Debian supports the 2.2 and 2.4 releases of the Linux
&gt; kernel.  Along with better support for a greater variety of new hardware
&gt; (such as USB) and significant improvements in usability and stability, the
&gt; 2.4 kernel provides support for the ext3 and reiserfs journaling
&gt; filesystems.
&gt;
&gt; Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 features a more streamlined and polished
installation,
&gt; which is translated into numerous languages.  The task system has been
&gt; revamped and made more flexible.  The debconf tool makes configuration of
&gt; the system easier and more user friendly.  Debian GNU/Linux can be
installed
&gt; from CD, or from the network and a few floppies.  It can be downloaded
now,
&gt; and will soon be available on CD-ROM from numerous vendors
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/CD/&gt">http://www.debian.org/CD/&gt</A>;.
&gt;
&gt; Upgrades to Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 from earlier releases are automatically
&gt; handled by the apt package management tool.  As always, Debian GNU/Linux
&gt; systems can be upgraded painlessly, in place, without any forced downtime.
&gt; For detailed instructions about installing and upgrading Debian GNU/Linux,
&gt; please see the release notes
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/releasenotes&gt">http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/releasenotes&gt</A>;.
&gt;
&gt; This is the first release of Debian that is compatible with version 2.2 of
&gt; the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).  Debian GNU/Linux now also
supports
&gt; software developed for the Linux Standard Base (LSB), though it is not yet
&gt; LSB certified.
&gt;
&gt; Current Debian users may be interested to know that this release of Debian
&gt; supports build dependencies, to aid in building packages from source, and
&gt; apt pinning, to ease partial upgrades to our testing or unstable branch.
&gt; This release of Debian features aptitude as an alternative for the
&gt; venerable dselect program, which will make it easier to select packages.
&gt; About four thousand new software packages were added to the distribution
in
&gt; Debian GNU/Linux 3.0.
&gt;
&gt; About Debian
&gt; ------------
&gt;
&gt; Debian GNU/Linux is a free operating system, developed by nearly a
thousand
&gt; volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the Internet.
&gt; Debian's dedication to Free Software, its non-profit nature, and its open
&gt; development model make it unique among GNU/Linux distributions.
&gt;
&gt; The Debian project's key strengths are its volunteer base, its dedication
&gt; to the Debian Social Contract, and its commitment to provide the best
&gt; operating system possible.  Debian 3.0 is another important step in that
&gt; direction.
