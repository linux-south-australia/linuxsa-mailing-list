Hi,

I was wondering that if anybody knows (or works for) a company which provides 
email accounts that meet the following requirements:

* Must NOT be free: free email is usually encumbered by banner ads, turds at 
the bottom of sent email, bandwidth/uptime problems, etc. I'm very willing to 
pay a small monthly/annual fee for this sort of thing.

* Must allow for IMAP connections, creation of folders, etc. Preferrably IMAP 
over SSL. I'm on the road a fair bit, so I'll be needing to store a fair amount 
of mail on the server in an organised fasion. Mailing lists and other junk will 
be archived locally and deleted, of course. Preferrably also offers some sort 
of server-side filtering/sorting service, possibly using Cyrus Sieve or similar.

* Preferrably offers webmail (for when I don't have an IMAP client handy), but 
doesn't add turds to the bottom of each mail.

* Preferrably hosted by an ISP: ie, somewhere that I know will still be around 
in a year or two and also has more than one link to the Internet.

Many ISPS offer email-only accounts, but don't allow for IMAP or server-side 
filtering. The key here is being able to access my mail from my laptop, my work 
machine, or my home machine in the same fashion.

Thanks,
