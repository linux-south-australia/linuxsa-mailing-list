These el-cheapo laptops are ideal for quite a few users that want mobility
but don't need to use their laptops in remote places. There aren't many
locations that don't have a power outlet.

The promoters of these cheap laptops don't need to worry about the weight
and expense of batteries, neither do they have to worry about battery life
or processors that go into slow mode to save power.

I'm guessing that to make their price seem even better they are avoiding
paying M/S for an OEM license of Windows also which leads to a very
cheap/mobilish desktop replacement.

&gt; Subject: Re: Founder of "Enlightenment" thinks Linux on
&gt; Desktop is dead

&gt; I was pretty amazed to find when a friend's dad brought home
&gt; his el'cheapo
&gt; new laptop from some shonky computer store in the city
&gt; somewhere (so shonky
&gt; it didn't even come with a battery) we found it had Linux preloaded.
&gt; Looking further we found the "OEM" Install Disk, was named
&gt; KlezLinux or
&gt; something off memory, I forget the exact name.
&gt;
&gt; Its becoming more, and more dominant on the desktop, which is actually
&gt; surprising me.
