Speaking of cold. Read this recently about rescuing dead drives.
<A HREF="http://forums.overclockers.com.au/showthread.php?s">http://forums.overclockers.com.au/showthread.php?s</A>=&threadid=71436&s=8637e3d37841dca0fee128d38ada53c4
registration required to read so I'll copy and paste.

This might be a good tips for you to rescue physical crashed harddrives.

Some weeks ago we had a Harddrive that was crashed. The user wanted to retrieve some data from it. Although the data was not so important so the user wanted to pay $2500 to get it restored by ibas.no, anyway a colleague of me recalled a hint he was told some years before.

Put the HDD in the freezer for a couple of hours.

With doubt in my mind I did as he said. A couple of hours later i pluged in the HDD into the computer again and tested. And damn, I was suprised. The thing worked without any problems at all. We were able to retrieve every single byte from it.

Quite nice way to save bucks with. Although this might not work with all crashed HDD's but it's still worth a try before spending bucks on a expensive Data restore company.

 &gt; &gt; Looks very much like it.  You'll probably find it'll start 
 &gt; making clunking
 &gt; &gt; noises and freeze up your system again.  You might want to 
 &gt; think about
 &gt; 
 &gt; Yep. just before I had a chance to dump the data off it. 
 &gt; Gone. Rebuilt it
 &gt; on a new Seagate barra. 60gig

Once it's cold it will probably spin up again long enough for you to get
any important data from the drive (but it sounds like you have a recent
backup)

 &gt; Funny. I have a heap of these drives, and this is the first to go.

I've only been working here for a year, so wasn't around when they were
all purchased and I'm not sure exactly how many of them we have out
there.  But we seem to be getting a lot come back now that they're a few
years old.

These days as far as IDE drives go, we use Western Digital exclusively.

 &gt; The expired drive has a 'Binary Logic' sticker on it, are 
 &gt; you psychic or
 &gt; something?

No, but dead hardware is one of my areas of expertise! :-)

Email me the Binary Logic serial number and I'll let you know if it's
under warranty.  If it is, we should be able to get a new Maxtor as a
replacement.

Or give us a call on 8244 1800.
