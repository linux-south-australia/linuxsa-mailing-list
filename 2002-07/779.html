Hi There,

I am wondering if anyone would be interested in doing a command
line linux/unix course. At the end of the course you would be familiar
with bash shell semantics, a number of useful GNU/Linux command line
tools and have practiced writing scripts to put these tools to effective
use.

Topics covered would include:

1.Basic information about the shell 
2.Using the shell in interactive and non-interactie mode 
3.Manipulating files with shell commands 
4.Manipulating directories with shell commands 
5.Manipulating file attributes, including file permissions, with shell
commands 
6.Manipulating processes 
7.Creating and using shell variables 
8.Using shell quotes 
9.Using flow control 
10.Using loops 
11.Using parameters and getopts 
12.Input and output including i/o redirection 
13.Using functions 
14.Manipulating text 
15.Using sed and awk with regular expressions 
16.Miscellaneous topics 

The course would include 20 hours of face-to-face, practical contact
with exercises you'd be expected to undertake in your own time.

I expect the cost would be $220 (non-concession) and $200
(concession/students); because I understand that this can be a
considerable tax on people's resources, I am willing to accept payment
on a week by week, pro rata basis. The cost includes course materials
and, of course, the GST.

I will be presenting the course and there are enough spaces for 15
people.

At the moment, the course is most likely to start on  Wednesday 4
September this year.

(ps: it is possible I may attempt to have a recognised training
organisation approve this course; I suspect that this process will take
a little time but hopefully when this occurs, said organisation will
recognise prior learning)
