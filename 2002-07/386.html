OK here we go - from memory - it has been several years now so it's a bit
scratchy.

Before installing NT go to the Micro$oft web site and get the drivers that
enable large disk support - sorry I can't remember names or where but I can
search around if you need me to, I think I found a link off an article on
the site that described the problem and how to get around it - not sure now.
Anyway copy these drivers onto a floppy disk.

When installing NT, at one point it will ask if you have any other special
hardware.  Say YES and point it to the drivers on the floppy disk (there are
a number of steps in this process but I cannot remember them all).  You will
then be able to see the whole 40GB from go and partition it as a single
drive.

Scares me that I know this!!

Subject: *STUPID* NT Workstation 4.0



Confound it,

I have a LICENCED version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0, and seeing I
bought a 40Gb drive I decided to install it on my other computer. The
drive is a Western Digital 7200 RPM drive with nothing special about it
but NT only detects it as 8032Mb, says that the maximum NTFS partition
can be 8032Mb and then when I type in 8032Mb it complains the partition
is too large.

I've tried setting the drive to be LBA and NORMAL but neither seem to
fix the problem.

I then gave up and decided to install FreeBSD 4.4RC3 [ I know, I'm
getting 4.6 very soon now ] and it installed without a problem. It
wouldn't boot at first but changing the drive setting to LBA and redoing
the installation fixed that problem.

Just out of interest, is there any reason why NT can only see 8Gb of a
40Gb drive?
