&gt; I attempted to join the SA mailing list a while ago to see what exactly
&gt; is discussed/goes on etc but never seemed to be able to subscribe
&gt; (presumably cos it's a members only list? although the webpage
&gt; doesn't say that).

I can answer that particular statement because I am currently the person
who administers the mailing lists. The committee of the SA Chapter of
AUUG believe that the mailing list is a benefit for members and
therefore should only be available to members of AUUG.

&gt; PS. don't take this email as criticising AUUG (since I don't really
&gt; know what they do) or moaning about the membership fee (since I
&gt; don't know what you really get or how/why it might be worth it).

I'm told -- although PLEASE consult your accountant/tax adviser before
actually claiming -- that for computer professionals the AUUG membership
fee is tax deductible.

I have attended one AUUG conference as a presenter and I can say that
the content, or the content that I was able to see (I had to leave half
way through for personal reasons), was of good quality, interesting and
well worth the fee. I can't quote the exact figures but if you attend
the main conference and the other conference then the difference between
non-member fees and member fees should fall close to or exceed the
membership fee.

Personally, I have joined AUUG because I think that such an organisation
has a place in Australia's IT landscape and that by supporting it, the
benefits will return to me in some, small way.
