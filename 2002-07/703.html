I remember many years ago when I first ventured onto efnet's irc,
talking to rasterman. He suggested then that he was going to write a
"real" window manager designed the way they should be, with lots of
bells & whistles. I told him then he was crazy, and the world would be
better off if he joined the development of current popular wm's.
Well he went off and did what he said he would anyway. And now the world
has Enlightenment. A fine example of flashy bloatware that demands even
more resources with each new release. It would seem to me that rasterman
likes to compete with M$ in that regard. No wonder that he would say
those things in that interview. He's probably embittered by the fact
that E hasn't become the default desktop of choice for all linux users.

I myself prefer a leaner window manager like the latest fvwm, which with
fvwm-themes add-on, makes my desktop as user friendly as any. Hell! It
can even look exactly like wincrap if I choose to load the Redmond98 or
RedmondXP themes! And with far less memory and resources consumed.

I don't put much stock in the words of a single developer. And open
source means open choice! Linux doesn't have to compete with M$ or
anyone else. It's already firmly established in it's own market which
grows daily. If linux had had the millions upon millions of dollars that
have been spent on marketting and promoting windows it wouldn't be the
OS it is today. Linux is an evolution of ideas, not the product of
marketting and salemanship. Eventually people will tire of giving the
world's richest company their hard earned dollars and decide to invest
in value for money. The march of linux onto the desktop is inevitable,
and cannot nor will not, be stopped by a few nay-sayers and doom
merchants. Just don't expect it to happen overnight. But it will happen.

The truth is, the vast majority of computer users don't even realise
there are alternatives to windows, so they simply assume they have to
use it. Linux may not yet be ready to sweep the world with it's own
revolution, but that day is drawing ever closer.

&gt; 
&gt; LaM: Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; R: Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that resembles what
&gt; you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The market is not driven by
&gt; a technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its crashes a few times
&gt; a day. Users don't (mostly) care. They just reboot and get on with it. They
&gt; want apps. If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose.
&gt; Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to
&gt; nice areas (video production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core
&gt; now will probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to
&gt; see Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
&gt; well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the apps
&gt; are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This is where
&gt; the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.
&gt; 
&gt; LaM: Where do you think the future ought to lie for desktop Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; R: There is none. The future for Linux for anything that isn't a headless
&gt; server in a back room tirelessly serving out data and services all day long
&gt; is on the device market, from PDA to phone to watch.
