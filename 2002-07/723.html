Hi,

I thought I would forward this for people to be aware of.

This is another success story. Today I managed to get around 100MB/s out 
of cache out of Samba over GigE. Of course, this was using sendfile and 
the driver machine was a 2GHz P4 on Plumas mobo and two GigE adapters and 
4GB of memory. My goal is to assemble a machine capable of 10Gb/s for 
testing :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; A local company has been having issues with samba for some time (it kills
&gt; &gt; &gt; an e250, and has seriously stressed an e5000) and I've been telling the
&gt; &gt; &gt; admin (half seriously) that he should just toss it on a PC with FreeBSD.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well they finally got tired of hearing FreeBSD this and FreeBSD that and
&gt; &gt; &gt; asked me to bring a box in if I was so confident... tomorrow morning at
&gt; &gt; &gt; 9am.  So, I'm building a new box tonight and was wondering if anybody
&gt; &gt; &gt; has any tried and true tuning parameters for samba on -stable.  They
&gt; &gt; &gt; currently have ~700 users attached.  The load per user is pretty low
&gt; &gt; &gt; but just rebooting and handling the reconnects has killed small boxes.
&gt; 
&gt; As a follow up to my post a few weeks back...
&gt; 
&gt; The box is currently easily handling an average of 650 connections with
&gt; 80% cpu free and lots of memory.  The only thing I had to change was
&gt; kern.ipc.nmbclusters=32768.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As others have said, memory is an issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Memory hasn't actually been a problem.  The vast majority is inactive, and
&gt; the scan rate is pretty close to 0.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; In some 'benchmark' testing, I have noticed that FreeBSD holds up pretty 
&gt; &gt; well to large numbers of connects coming in at one time, say compared to 
&gt; &gt; Linux. Starting up 100 clients during about two or three seconds (as long 
&gt; &gt; as it takes to fork 100 processes on the driver) does not kill a FreeBSD 
&gt; &gt; Samba server as much as it does a Linux server running Linux 2.4.x.
&gt; 
&gt; All of the load is actually redirected through a firewall, and when we
&gt; changed the mapping from the e250 over to FreeBSD about 350 clients
&gt; connected all at once.  The cpu dropped to about 50% for 30 seconds and
&gt; then things settled down.  We did see 3 seg faults in smbd during the
&gt; initial rush, but have been unable to reproduce or to get a core file.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a side note, the data being served will be attached to the samba server
&gt; &gt; &gt; via NFS.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hmmm, some of the locking stuff might be an issue then ...
&gt; 
&gt; We haven't noticed any problems with samba that could be traced to NFS.
&gt; I have found that the NFS performance is actually worse for bulk copies
&gt; when nfsiod is running, so we just do not run it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to everybody for their input.  Due to the success of our tests
&gt; FreeBSD will now be replacing Solaris 9 in this environment.
