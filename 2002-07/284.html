Microsoft's Plans to Secure Every PC with a Unique ID;

Symantec Enterprise Security News Clip
Volume 3, Issue 28
July 9, 2002

Just a short clip of the above article;

"Microsoft Corp reckons by the middle of the decade every new Windows
device will come with a built-in hardware/software key management system
that will allow developers to combat most security risks and at the same
time make every device uniquely identifiable. 

It emerged last week that Microsoft is working on a project codenamed
Palladium that will build "trust" directly into the operating system,
but which is causing much concern among privacy and competition
advocates, who see it as a way for large corporations, including and
particularly Microsoft, to exert more control over computer users."

We have seen this before, Intel (with MS) is trying again....

"The Palladium project calls for wide cooperation among the industry's
dominant players. Microsoft product manager Mario Juarez said Advanced
Micro Devices Inc and Intel Corp are already publicly involved, and
there are other players (likely including PC makers) participating
privately."

Very interesting article.
