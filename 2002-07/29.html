&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I have some unexplained Samba questions I was hoping someone might be able
&gt; to point out what I have missed.
&gt; 
&gt; - What would be the typical sustained download speed on a 100Mbit LAN ?

What an interesting question. Every block of data being read or written 
has to take two trips between kernel space and user space. If you are 
reading, smbd has to read it from disk and then has to write it to the 
socket. Thus, there is quite a bit of copying going on. 

However, you should be able to achieve something like 75% or so of the max 
atainable at 100Mb/s (around 10MB/s).

Unlike FTP, the SMB protocol is a request/response protocol, so a client 
has to wait for a response to every write before it can send another 
request, and it has to wait for the data from every read before it can 
send another request.

Secondly, Windows does lots of funny things on the wire, and unless you 
write some special programs, you have to wait for the data to hit the 
disk (buffers) before you ask for more, so it might not even be capable of 
driving a 100Mb/s link to saturation.

I have recently committed some code that does allow you do generate CIFS 
load, called cifs-load-gen, that will allow you to explore these things.

Also, different file system deliver different performance. John Terpstra 
presented a paper at a recent conf that demonstrates that ext2 performs 
better than ext3, for example.

&gt; - Why does smbd only grab 50% cpu if the machine is essentially idle ?

You are dealing with essentially a single thread. If the client is not 
issuing the requests fast enought, then it will not be able to grab all 
the CPU, Also, it may be that it does not require 100% of the CPU to keep 
a 100Mb/s link saturated. That is only 10MB/s, and even with the three or 
four copies that are required, it is only 40MB/s the CPU is ask to move.

&gt; - What priority level does smbd run at ?

Dunno.

&gt; - How does one squeeze more speed out of it.

Make sure the server is the bottleneck first. You can do this by grabbing 
a packet trace and looking at the delay between one request completing and 
the next one issuing.

If the server is not the bottleneck, get a faster client. If the server is 
the bottleneck, you need to determine if it is IO that is the problem, but 
an idle CPU suggests it is waiting for IO. If that is the case, use a RAID 
system or something like that.

You can also use the load generator to check what the system is capable 
of. Tests I did last year with 750MHz Duron with 1GB running either 2.4.7 
or FreeBSD 4.4 suggests that it takes about 10 clients running netbench 
to saturate a 100Mb/s link. The load generator can get you reading or 
writing files, and that may allow you to go hell for leather.

&gt; The basic senario is I have a small SOHO consisting of a linux file server
&gt; (Slackware 8.0+samba) which serves  2 desktops and a laptop
&gt; (Win98se&Win2K).   The sustained file download speed from the linux box on
&gt; any machine is 1.5-5.5M byte per second, but it changes depending
&gt; day/time/orientation of the moon, there is no consistancy.   I have
&gt; verified that the network layer is 100%, there are no IP errors and the
&gt; timing is consistant across all boxes.   I have read James doco and fixed
&gt; the slow browsing problems under win2k (see James we are using it !)   I am
&gt; not running samba as a PDC (yet) so it is configured as the master browser
&gt; and to "win" browser elections.
&gt; 
&gt; The linux box is a Celleron 600 on a VIA motherboard (no body laugh) with
&gt; 3Com Ethernet card (3C905B), there are a couple of big ATA100 drives on a
&gt; measly ATA66 controller (fixed next pay cheque).   I cannot see why the
&gt; performance of samba varies so much from day to day.   It should be noted
&gt; that I have never seen smbd take more than 50% of the cpu (via top) which
&gt; roughly equates to my 5Mbytes per second peak, but it is fustrating to see
&gt; the smbd load requirement drop to 11% (1Mbyte/s out) with 80%+ of idle time
&gt; when transfering 2Gb files !
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure it is a samba/os/config problem and not a network hardware
&gt; problem (those I can fix !).   I can email config files if required.
&gt;
