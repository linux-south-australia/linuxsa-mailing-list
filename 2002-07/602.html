Hiya,

" LaM: Where do you think the future ought to lie for desktop Linux?

R: There is none. The future for Linux for anything that isn't a 
headless server in a back room tirelessly serving out data and services 
all day long is on the device market, from PDA to phone to watch. "

 From this year's release of Mozilla 1, OpenOffice 1, KDE3, GNOME 2 and 
my own experiences this weekend with some great Linux Divxing software - 
I think that is pretty pessimistic. I have a feeling that the quote may 
end up like Bill Gate's famous 'no one needs more than 640Kb' quote.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; 
&gt; Also, I believe that very large organisations with limited numbers of app 
&gt; requirements may realise the savings to be made from using Linux instead 
&gt; of Microsoft Windows + Apps.
&gt; 
&gt; If a single Linux OS + required apps can be imaged and rolled out en 
&gt; masse for a given purpose, you could get away with lower hardware costs, 
&gt; avoidance of expensive yearly per-seat licenses, etc..
&gt; 
&gt; First example that comes to mind would be call centres. If you could have 
&gt; a setup involving one custom app with everything else driven via a 
&gt; web-browser, then Linux would be a certain winner.

&gt;&gt;LaM: Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;R: Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that resembles what
&gt;&gt;you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The market is not driven by
&gt;&gt;a technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its crashes a few times
&gt;&gt;a day. Users don't (mostly) care. They just reboot and get on with it. They
&gt;&gt;want apps. If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose.
&gt;&gt;Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to
&gt;&gt;nice areas (video production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core
&gt;&gt;now will probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to
&gt;&gt;see Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
&gt;&gt;well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the apps
&gt;&gt;are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This is where
&gt;&gt;the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.
&gt;&gt;
