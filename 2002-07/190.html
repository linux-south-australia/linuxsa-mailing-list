That network address is bogus, so I will assume that it is a type. You 
probably meant ...YYY.192

Network addresses are all 0's in the host portion.

&gt; here who might have run into this problem - How do you
&gt; calculate a Netmask? Any suggestions as to why the route
&gt; command doesn't work for other resons would also be
&gt; appreciated.

Typically, you don't calculate a netmask, someone gives it to you. You 
only calculate a netmask when you subnet a network you already have.

You need to know how many bits have been set aside for hosts in your 
network, and then you can work from there.

If for example, you have 7 host bits, ie 128 host numbers minus 2 (or 3 
:-) you look at it like this:

   AAA.BBB.CCC.xbbbbbb

Where A, B, and C are Decimal digits, x is a bit specified by someone 
else, and b are bits under your control.

The netmask serves to tell the network where the bits you control start 
and the bit it 'owns' ends, in a sense. The netmask is anded with an 
address to separate out the network number and host portion of an address.

So, the netmask for the above is:

  255.255.255.10000000
  AAA.BBB.CCC.xbbbbbbb

By using ANDs or NEG and AND, you can separate out the two fields.

Now, the value of that 1 above is 128, so the netmask is 255.255.255.128. 
You can move bit-wise in either direction by adding or subtracting the 
next lowest or highest power of two.

Thus, if you had 6 bits for the host address, you want a netmask of:

  255.255.255.11000000
  AAA.BBB.CCC.xxbbbbbb

or 255.255.255.192, since that second bit above is worth 64.

Here is a handy chart:

  Bit 7 = 128
  Bit 6 =  64
  Bit 5 =  32
  Bit 4 =  16
  Bit 3 =   8
  Bit 2 =   4
  Bit 1 =   2
  Bit 0 =   1

But also,

  8 bits for host: Netmask 0
  7 bits for host: Netmask 128
  6 bits for host: Netmask 192 (128 + 64)
  5 bits for host: Netmask 224 (128 + 64 + 32)
  4 bits for host: Netmask 240 (128 + 64 + 32 + you guessed it, 32)
  3 bits for host: Netmask 248
  2 bits for host: Netmask 252
  1 bit for host:  Netmask 254

You can extend these in the other direction as well. 

Finally, I mentioned minus 2 (or 3) above. This comes about because some 
numbers are unusable.

A host address of all 0's is the network number, while a host address of 
all 1's is the broadcast address, and you need a router as well in most 
cases. So, you get two (or three) less addresses to play with. Also, a 
netmask of 254 in the last byte is useless (why?).
