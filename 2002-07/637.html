This comment (and plenty others in this thread) sounds like it might not
be based on much practical experience, or if so, with a very different
kind of Windows users than those I've found.

What I've done a number of times is give Mozilla 1.0 to IE users.  In all
cases so far the changeover has been quick and painless. You do have to
make sure the plugins are configured, but after that it is pretty plain
sailing. (The mail client is a separate and easy sell.)

This isn't at all like switching from Windows to Unix, but it is a start
and protects users from ever-increasing IE lockin which should make a
future transition away from Windows easier. Even if it is two years before
applications exist that will make a particular Windows user happy to
consider migrating, moving to Mozilla now is an excellent start.

I have found a lot of quite basic Windows users are uneasy about the
things IE might be doing, and even the fact that Mozilla has an
easily-found control for denying automatic popup windows is reassuring for
many. Some magazine (PC World, from memory) did a comparison of IE6 and
Mozilla 1.0 on Windows and concluded that IE had no noticeable speed
advantage and only a small number of integration advantages and clearly
they were coming from a Windows perspective. They explicitly included
rendering in their tests. Maybe someone here can come up with a URL.
