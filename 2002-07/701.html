At risk of top posting,... but the trend has been set with this branch
of the thread...

I spoke to a LAN administrator of a 2000 odd seat enterprise, who last
week had a Microsoft rep call them up to inquire about their plans on
upgrading to XP....

Lan Admin: We are not planning to upgrade... It offers no benefit to us
or our users

M$ Rep: But it has new features.... (insert more waffle here)

LA: Which no-one here will ever use and we will have higher tech support
calls..

Anyway, to cut to the point, the conversion went around in circles a few
times.

Don't forget, Microsoft's biggest competitor for the desktop is their
previous version. In a lot of business large and small, a large
percentage of computers are still running windows 98 (which I think is
the best MS OS to date, small simple and very little for the users to
mess with)....

Just a few thoughts...

&gt;  From this year's release of Mozilla 1, OpenOffice 1, KDE3, GNOME 2 and 
&gt; my own experiences this weekend with some great Linux Divxing software - 
&gt; I think that is pretty pessimistic. I have a feeling that the quote may 
&gt; end up like Bill Gate's famous 'no one needs more than 640Kb' quote.

&gt; &gt; Well there's the third, unmentioned location of linux on the desktop, 
&gt; &gt; which is upon die-hards' PCs ;)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, I believe that very large organisations with limited numbers of app 
&gt; &gt; requirements may realise the savings to be made from using Linux instead 
&gt; &gt; of Microsoft Windows + Apps.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If a single Linux OS + required apps can be imaged and rolled out en 
&gt; &gt; masse for a given purpose, you could get away with lower hardware costs, 
&gt; &gt; avoidance of expensive yearly per-seat licenses, etc..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First example that comes to mind would be call centres. If you could have 
&gt; &gt; a setup involving one custom app with everything else driven via a 
&gt; &gt; web-browser, then Linux would be a certain winner.

&gt; &gt;&gt;LaM: Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;R: Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that resembles what
&gt; &gt;&gt;you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The market is not driven by
&gt; &gt;&gt;a technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its crashes a few times
&gt; &gt;&gt;a day. Users don't (mostly) care. They just reboot and get on with it. They
&gt; &gt;&gt;want apps. If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to
&gt; &gt;&gt;nice areas (video production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core
&gt; &gt;&gt;now will probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to
&gt; &gt;&gt;see Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
&gt; &gt;&gt;well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the apps
&gt; &gt;&gt;are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This is where
&gt; &gt;&gt;the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.
