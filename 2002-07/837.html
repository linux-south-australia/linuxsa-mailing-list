Hi list,


Here is my impression of ELX...and my conclusion is that I guess that
Reiser is the reason I use SuSE instead of this. It loads SuSE Linux
very fast, but not as fast as the BeOS. However, reiser is much improved
over anything I have used.

With reiser, when all was lost, and I had to power off the machine, I
didn't have
to worry about weather I would get a kernel panic or not.

Overall, reiser works a treat!! So, I will go with SuSE.


My impression of Elx was as follows, not in order of importance:


ELX is impressive and innovate in some wayd. However, the downside to
Elx is that its appearance, the lack of reiser, and the bloated and not
immediately useable utilities, makes it appear less
attractive thn it really is.  I think it is definitely better than Red
Hat 7.


Basically, these were my thoughts during the install: "...this is
definitely Red Hat's
installer..looks a bit nicer, although it looks a bit cartoonish...DHCP
setuo is a bit confusing...wow! it detected my monitor and my video
card, didn't have to chooose a thing that's as impressive as SuSE!...at
login, Why does KDE 3 say 2.2.2?...hmmm, didn't detect my printer like
SuSE...doesn't boot fast with reiser like SuSE....icons look like they
came from Lycoris Linux...network neighborhood browsed nicely, but I
couln't mount the share...checked out the start menu...FOR ONCE! THE
START MENU IS ACTUALLY INTUITIVE!!!

Open Office only...so I'm kinda bummed...Mandrake gave me Star Office
6....however, they have seemed to have picked all of the best for the
rest of the applications and put it in there...right click works,
impressive...

The update was fast, easy and impressive!

Very nice to have webmin set up already..looks like they took the time
to pick all of the best applications, cdbakeoven, etc, the look needs
more polish. And some things still have to be dome the old fashiond way,
like edit fdsab to add partition to mount...

The added menus & features seem pretty cool, but because things don't
always work quite right, it seems kinda pointless...the graphics make it
look kinda "off brandish", and because, in general, some things don't
work quite right or at all...my web camera, Wine without the Codeweavers
hacks that results in an installation failure of MS Office 2000.

So would I replace SuSE for this? No way, because I have it customized (
I made icons called "my computer" "network neighborhood, I have all of
my network shares mounted automatically, vnc and bochs one click away...

I would pick this as a choice distribution for a beginner that has the
help of an experienced Linux user. However,
SuSE Linux and Mandrake are two very good distrributions that I would
give to a beginner before giving out this..





I would give this a 8.5 out of 10.


Ok, I am off to bed.

James Leone
