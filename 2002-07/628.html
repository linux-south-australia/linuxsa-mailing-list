&gt; I do remember a bunch of friends in Sydney and Melbourne mentioning how they
&gt; were learning the basics of Redhat at TAFE, and how boring it was, heh
&gt; (although interestingly a lot are now running it in firewall/server
&gt; situations, but not desktop).  I can't say I know anybody who goes to
&gt; Adelaide, but it is possible that they perhaps haven't "caught up" yet.

It would be useful to have such feedback (if you could actually convince
them to talk to you about it) and actually determine what they thought
was boring. Was it the actual content, the way it was being taught? It
would be useful because it is very possible that I may have a vested
interest in making sure that the TAFE courses are not boring.
