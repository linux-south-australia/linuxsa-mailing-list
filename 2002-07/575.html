&gt; What is unclear to me:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. I thought that if you have local IP numbers set up i.e. 192.168.x.x
&gt; or 10.1.X.X behind a router with a masquerraded local IP number, that
&gt; this kind of thing couldn't happen. Am I incorrect?

Not directly, but if I compromise the gateway itself or another machine
that is able to route packets to the local network then I am able to do
this.

&gt; 2. If the use of local IP numbers have little or no effect on intrusion
&gt; deterance, are there any other methodologies that can keep an intruder
&gt; from reaching the vulnerable computer?

Security is a frame of mind, use tools such as Tripwire, virus scanners
and keep up to date with the security updates. The LDP has a Security
guide (look up their address on Google "Linux Documentation Project" --
I alwas forget their URL and get the Christian Democratic Party or some
such thing of Denmark).

&gt; P.S. Last night, I went to a good used bookstore located near where I
&gt; live. The Amanda Book Buyers Club operates by giving store credit to
&gt; people that bring in their books or SOFTWARE  :-) . The bookstore then
&gt; sells them at a higher price. Turns out that this bookstore (on Castro
&gt; near Books, Inc.) has had all varieties of operating systems and
&gt; computer books there off and on for quite some time.  Saw a book in
&gt; french by a guy named bourne, 2 copies of Richard Stallman's GNU Emacs
&gt; manual circa 1984. The software was kinda sparce last night, but they
&gt; did have one book that caught my eye.

Where is Catro near Books, Inc?
