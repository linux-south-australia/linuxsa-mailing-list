I have been thinking for the last couple of months (since I got SpamAssassin) 
that an ISP offering an *optional* service to filter mail through 
SpamAssassin, and/or through a virus scanner would probably do well.

Not so much for myself though. I recently setup a box for my parents (they 
want to email friends, surf web etc), and trying to get them "educated" not 
to double-click on attachments etc is quite difficult. I would be more than 
happy to sign them up to an ISP that let me "opt (them) in" to the above two 
services, and would not be above paying a small extra monthly fee for the 
service (say $5)

I can't see how this would be too hard - the "protected" mail service could 
be setup on a separate box (ie different hostname for POP servers etc), and 
be sized appropriately to the number of subscribers, without the worry of 
trying to size the main mail server to scan all incoming messages, which not 
everyone (especially people belongs to lists like this one) want anyway.

And for bonus points a WWW proxy server with virus scanning software on 
download also would be handy, but not essential. 

If any ISP's are listening to the list that do have such a service, please 
drop me a mail off-list.
