Further to Richard's reply.

You actually want a fair bit of idle CPU.  If you don't have
any idle CPU than Samba will need to wait behind other processes
before it gets it's allocation of CPU time.  If the other processes
are CPU-bound Samba might end up waiting 0.005s per packet.  The 
jargon for this is the "run queue length" and some utilities
will display that.

You might find the 'bonnie' disk benchmarking program useful
for tracking server bottlenecks.  Look at the 'sequential
output - block' figure and the 'random seeks - per sec'
figures.

Your client I/O traffic will usually be a mix of these, the
number of seeks will increase more than proportionately with
the number of clients (the more users, the greater the odds
that the disk head will need to be moved to satisfy the request).

High-end servers come with 10,000RPM disks, explicitly to get
the head movement time down.  This is professional kit, so
simply use the fastest disks you can reasonably find (say
7200 rather than 5400).

If you use IDE then set the hdparm and idebus= settings optimally
for your hardware.

Use the ext2 or xfs filesystems.  The others suck for file
serving applications, as you would expect from their design
goals.

Make sure you have a fair whack of RAM.  A lot of the user I/O
requests should be cachable.  There is also a cache on the disks
themselves,  If you are buying more IDE disk, try for a 8MB cache
rather than the standard 2MB cache.  Fiddle with the disk pre-
fetching parameters to make this cache work best for your I/O
mix.

If you have a UPS, consider enabling write caching on the disk.
A single-machine UPS will set you back about $200, so this might
be a cheap way to improve throughput.

Finally, start a log book and keep the benchmark results in
the book.  You'll find them very handy.
