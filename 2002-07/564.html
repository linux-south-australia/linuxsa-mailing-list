Following Robyn's lead I started renaming directories in my home directory.
This didnt help at first so I took it to the extreme and removed everything
from mine and the roots home dirs. Now, it worked.

btw I have done quite a few re-boots from the start and this has never
appeared to help anything.

So, having got gnome up and running again, the task was to then try and
bring the home directory files back in without upsetting what had just been
created. I've had mixed success with this. I used cp -uR in an effort to try
not overwrite the newly created files.

the problem at the moment is  ~ &gt;tail .xsession-errors  gives the following
report

  File "/usr/bin/gnome-upgrade.py", line 535, in ?
    nautilus_needed = check_nautilus ()
  File "/usr/bin/gnome-upgrade.py", line 387, in check_nautilus
    contents = open (session_file, 'r').read ()
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'/home/sambelld/.gnome/session'

Gtk-WARNING **: invalid cast from (NULL) pointer to `GtkOptionMenu'

Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkoptionmenu.c: line 248
(gtk_option_menu_set_history): a
ssertion `option_menu != NULL' failed.

 - - end - -

The desktop is not being fully loaded for my account. Root logon is fine.
What happens is parts of the task bar (presumably called the GtkOptionMenu)
are missing.

sounds very odd.  /tmp is supposed to be temporary.
ie. deleting random stuff in there in a running system is not
too clever but logging out and in again (or at worst rebooting)
should "fix" it.  (in solaris /tmp is cleared on every reboot)
