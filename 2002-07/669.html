&gt; Linux's user interface sucks.  You're going to burn classroom
&gt; hours and kid's energy explaining why OpenOffice doesn't work
&gt; the same as Mozilla, which doesn't work the same as GNOME/KDE.

But Windows isn't the model of consistency either.  Microsoft
often upgrade common controls which break/modify the way previous
ones worked, regularly shift things about on their UI (I'm still
oming to grips with the changes from NT4 to 2000, and am told
that XP (Tonka-Toy edition) changes that yet again), and performs
"non-intuitively".  One example that regularly bites me - I _think_
it's Notepad that does this - if you decided to print your document,
you can use the menu shortcut (ALT-F P), or as the menu indicates,
straight ALT-P.  But ALT-F P brings up a print dialog, letting you
choose printer, orientation, whereas ALT-P just prints the document
immediately.

The irony of this, as Alan Cooper pointed out, is that Microsoft
want all third party apps to conform to a particular UI standard
that Microsoft lays out, but Microsoft regularly breaks it
themselves ("for a better desktop experience").

Hmphh.

&gt; Schools *want* an alternative to Mac and Windows.

Provided it understands Word and Powerpoint formats, and does
exactly what Outlook does.
