&gt; Linux uptimes are slowly getting better, but are nowhere near good
&gt; enough.

&gt; Red Hat Linux has had now many kernel upgrades (each requiring a
&gt; five minute reboot) this year?

I guess the linux kernel has been maturing rapidly for some time now.
2.4 is probably the only one with enough of the more advanced features
for many aplications (including iptables), and it is only reaching
maturity now. Hopefully this means that if you start with a recent 2.4
kernel now you should have enough of the features and few enough of the
bugs and not have to update it. But yes, it isnt as tried and proven as
some of the BSDs etc. (yet).
