&lt;takes deep breath... :)&gt;

&gt; [ Not picking out Damien's posting in particular, more flaming
&gt;    the entire thread :-) ]
&gt; Yeah right, lets force an inferior product on the school kids
&gt; because we can.  Whoo hoo, that will win Open Source Religion
&gt; converts.  After all everyone that's been to a Catholic school
&gt; has gotten religion and joined the Jesuits :-)

Okay, for the many reasons I have stated in earlier posts, I don't think Linux 
is a third rate solution. And it can also provide a decent computing 
experience for poorer schools because it can be run on throw away hardware.  
And it's not like Linux in schools isn't being trialed right now. Of course, 
not in Australia because we're just a bunch of fscking sheep who wont say boo 
unless the US does too. Anyway, I got enthusiastic (am I the ONLY one?) about 
linux in schools from various websites and articles:

an example of collaboration between schools and the community (haven't looked 
for a better example, but im sure they're there)

I could go on, but I should really be doing some work :)

&gt; I don't know if you've been on the blackboard side of a classroom,
&gt; but coherency and consitency is really important when you are
&gt; trying to teach.  A lot of subject design uses the coherency of
&gt; the subject to teach the basics, and then something more
&gt; complicated, and then something really interesting.

The whole consistency with the user interface thing is bollocks, all the 
programs use the same paradigm. And anyway, we're talking about KIDS here, 
not some old technophobe who's gonna go "oh dear option X isn't in the file 
menu, but in the options menu, this is so hard". "Oh this program looks 
slightly different to this other program, oh dear, oh woe is me". (note the 
sarcasm :)

&gt; Linux's user interface sucks.  You're going to burn classroom
&gt; hours and kid's energy explaining why OpenOffice doesn't work
&gt; the same as Mozilla, which doesn't work the same as GNOME/KDE.
&gt; And then there's the command-line intruding upon everything,
&gt; itself massively complex and contradictory.  And you're not
&gt; trying to teach kids how to navigate a nightmare user interface:
&gt; you're trying to help them learn digital photography, or english,
&gt; or design.

There are articles out there proving this argument wrong, but i'm too lazy to 
find em. Read my comment above. 

The command line thing is rubbish, my first computer was a C64, I wrote basic 
programs more than 100 lines long when i was 8 or 9. My first x86 PC had DOS 
on it, and I rejected win95 because Dos + Norton Commander was WAY faster for 
doing stuff. GUI isn't everything, kids aren't scared of technology like 
adults are, they'll _try_ to break it :).

&gt; It's not as bad as the traditional UNIX interface.  But still far
&gt; too bad to pretend that there's a coherency of design and a
&gt; consitency of use.
&gt; At the moment Linux is the third-best desktop operating system.
&gt; I see no reason why kids should be forced to use third-rate tools
&gt; to meet some ideology.

It's good enough now, and will only keep improving. There's no strategy tax, 
there's no threats of BSA audits, no licensing woes. The Pro's of using linux 
far outweigh and perceived lacking in the GUI. And I really don't understand, 
KDE rocks! I'm sitting here with liquid mosfet, translucent menus, and it 
looks bloody awesome, windows bores the crap out of me. 

Microsoft didn't get to where it is because it was the best, it got there 
because it was good enough and cheap enough. Now they have the muscle to push 
people around and raise prices, threaten audits, etc. What are people going 
to do about it? We'll make our own software, stuff them, we don't need them 
as badly as they'd like.

&gt; Why don't you go away and make Linux a first-rate user experience.
&gt;
&gt; Once you've done that you won't need to talk to schools about
&gt; adopting it.  Schools *want* an alternative to Mac and Windows.
&gt; It's the Open Source/Free Software community which is letting them
&gt; down

In this Marketing driven capatilist world, it is us who must inform them of 
these alternatives. The KDE and GNOME projects continue to move forward in 
terms of user interface design and features, it'll only get better, but it's 
good enough to start using *now*.

&gt; There have been decades of negotiation about consitent user interfaces
&gt; for the UNIX system and then the GNU/Linux system and it's still a mess.
&gt; That says a hell of a lot about its developer's attitudes to users outside
&gt; of the Slashdot cult.

KDE and GNOME wouldn't even exist if people didn't care. There may be some 
developers in it only for themselves, so what? There overall direction of the 
projects is to provide a fantastic desktop experience to Unix users.

Anyway, I _really_ need to do some work :)

Damien.
