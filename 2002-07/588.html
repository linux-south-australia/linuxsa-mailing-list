&gt; MySQL sockets used to live there by default and it was a total pain...

Postgres' sockets still do (unless built otherwise).  Can make for a
great denial of service, plus makes it hard to secure the socket.

&gt;&gt; As the followups say, Solaris does this by default.  HP-UX can do it,
&gt;&gt; but it impacts VM on any system, so why would you?  The increase in
&gt;&gt; speed isn't worth it once you hit swap.

&gt; Surely you've answered your own question...

Well, no, I haven't.

&gt; If, for example, Solaris were a gaming
&gt; OS where the games relied more on specialised hardware and a FAST but
&gt; TEMPORARY file system, having /tmp in memory would give you a huge
&gt; gain...

And which game would this be?  This is my beef - I'm looking for a real
example, not hypothetical cases.  I know of one: sort will occasionally
use temporary files if its input data is large enough.  You'd have to
want to be performing a large number of sorts (or on large datasets)
for that to be a good enough reason to reduce your core size.

And yes, I'm probably looking at the machine skewed, more as a server
that as someone's personal workstation.

It reminds me of a signature I saw in the late 80's: "Great!  Virtual
Memory - now I can have a really big RAM disk!".  Seems to have come
home to roost.
