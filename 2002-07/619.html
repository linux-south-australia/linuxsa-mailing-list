I was pretty amazed to find when a friend's dad brought home his el'cheapo
new laptop from some shonky computer store in the city somewhere (so shonky
it didn't even come with a battery) we found it had Linux preloaded.
Looking further we found the "OEM" Install Disk, was named KlezLinux or
something off memory, I forget the exact name.

Its becoming more, and more dominant on the desktop, which is actually
surprising me.

Subject: Re: Founder of "Enlightenment" thinks Linux on Desktop is dead


&gt; No-one ever said it was going to be easy :) There seems to be another
person
&gt; every week saying that Linux on the desktop is dead, yet the apps and
&gt; improvements keep coming regardless. Also the profile of Linux is getting
&gt; better, it is being taken seriously in mission critical environments. Sure
&gt; it's being perceived as a cheap backroom server that'll just keep running,
&gt; but before that it was perceived only as a toy.
&gt;
&gt; People keep predicting Linux will fail here, there and everywhere, yet
they
&gt; keep getting proven wrong. Where there is a will there is a way, and there
is
&gt; a *lot* of will out there.
&gt;
&gt; I think the key to getting Linux on desktops and in peoples minds, is
schools.
&gt; Kids will want to have what they use at school, and they get to take a
copy
&gt; home, legally. According to the K12 project, setting up a terminal server
&gt; classroom with a beasty application server and some recycled machines
turned
&gt; into thin clients, reduces the cost of the _hardware_ by half. Then comes
the
&gt; fact u can stick a copy of redhat on the server for nothing, or if u want
&gt; support for that server, buy a single copy.
&gt;
&gt; Typical high school applications are certainly plentiful (word processing
&gt; etc), and of course it's a fantastic environment for computer programming
(we
&gt; learnt toolbook and logowriter at my school, um.. yay, how about some C??
or
&gt; some scripting languages, or Java, ie something useful). I'm not too sure
&gt; about educational programs for little kids though, but the various Linux
for
&gt; schools projects are working on that, and the new addition in KDE3
includes
&gt; some educational programs - although rather boring, but that can be fixed.
&gt;
&gt; Also, Tux is cute. Linux is fun, it can appeal to kids. It's a stable,
easily
&gt; administrated server. Beige windows environments are BORING! Where are the
&gt; negatives here people? Linux in schools is cheaper, centrally
administered,
&gt; easy to update with no downtime (except in kernel upgrade, but why do that
if
&gt; the current kernel works?), linux can be fun and cute, it sends a good
&gt; message about sharing and choice and to not just follow your corporate
&gt; masters blindly, provides a better learning environment  - kids will be
more
&gt; competent with computers, etc etc.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not giving up on linux until Microsofts marketshare has dwindled
&gt; significantly (and i'm talking like 50% or more). I know things will keep
&gt; improving, regardless of what the naysayers(?) say.
&gt;
&gt; Damien.

&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Not too mention the linux apps are appearing. These days there are
&gt; &gt;  &gt; numerous browsers that are pretty good,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All of which take longer to load than IE, none of which work as well (in
&gt; &gt; terms of web site compatibility - Standards are a different matter and
the
&gt; &gt; average desktop user doesn't care.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Excuse me while I play devil's advocate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joe Schmoe knows that if he hits the Big Blue E, and clicks "Connect" he
&gt; &gt; can surf the web.  The majority of Internet users (the ones that ring
&gt; &gt; support anyway) don't understand the distinction between a network
&gt; &gt; connection to the internet, and the software that makes use of that
&gt; &gt; connection.  They don't know that Internet Explorer is a browser, they
&gt; &gt; think Internet Explorer is just how the Internet works.  In that respect
I
&gt; &gt; don't think three sluggish browsers with funny names is much of an
&gt; &gt; advantage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joe Schmoe's employer isn't likely to switch to a Linux desktop because
Joe
&gt; &gt; Schmoe has been surfing the web and chatting to his mates on MSN after
work
&gt; &gt; every night and is thus already competent in using a Windows GUI.
Besides
&gt; &gt; which, he runs MYOB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joe Schmoe's son has heard of Linux before, but all the computers at his
&gt; &gt; school run complimentary Microsoft software, all his IT assignments have
to
&gt; &gt; be handed up in DOC format, etc., etc., etc.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How can Linux possibly hope to combat something with so many fingers in
&gt; &gt; such hefty pies?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Besides which, what happens when your desktop must be DRM compliant?
&gt; &gt; Surely open-source is a circumvention device in itself?  Perhaps there
are
&gt; &gt; ways around the problem, but while the open source communities scramble,
&gt; &gt; Windows will dominate in countless other ways.
