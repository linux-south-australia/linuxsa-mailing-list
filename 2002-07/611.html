&gt; First example that comes to mind would be call centres. If you could have 
&gt; a setup involving one custom app with everything else driven via a 
&gt; web-browser, then Linux would be a certain winner.

Even call centres need a standard desktop, which typically includes
Word, Excel, Outlook, a 3270 emulator, a good telnet client, a web
browser and some number of frequently changing custom applications.
I've seen attempts at "all in one" apps and they suck big time.  If you
want to burn $10-100m they are a great way to go.  If you want to solve
problems stick to small, well targetted apps.

I'm inclined to agree with Rasterman, in fact I think I'm already on
record as holding that opinion.  He really does hit the nail quite
succinctly on the head: it's the apps.  If it doesn't run exactly
Microsoft Word for Windows (recent version) it's not what "they" want.
If only Wine would hit prime time, but I can see that were in for a
repeat of Wine16/Win32 -- ie 64 bit Windows will be established before
Wine reliably runs 32 bit apps, by which time nobody will want it.
