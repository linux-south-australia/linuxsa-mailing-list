&gt;     What do you mean by "make it work"? What I meant was If
&gt; a USER wanted to send mail, then run the mail client, if
&gt; they wanted to surf, run a Browser, if they wanted to
&gt; balance the cheque book, run a spreadsheet or if they wanted
&gt; to write a letter, run a word processor. These are everyday
&gt; USER things, and I would have to say that if the machine was
&gt; set up ready for a USER, then M$, Mac or a suitable Linux
&gt; Distro would be more or less identical. All these systems
&gt; are GUI based or menu driven and any user can pick it up in
&gt; next to no time. KDE and Gnome were designed to be Windows
&gt; and Mac like to make it easy to change over. Gnome used to
&gt; have a Windows mask that even changed the toolbar to a
&gt; "Start" button (it may still but I have used KDE for a while
&gt; now).

"Make it work" refers to a scenario where a user purchases a machine
and decides that they want to do something with it (i.e., send mail,
surf, balance cheque books etc.). If you've just purchased a machine,
you've got to get it from the box and to a working state on your desk
that will allow you to do all that aforementioned fun stuff.

If the machine has been setup beforehand, a Linux or Windows box would
be roughly the same in terms of ease-of-use. Linux, perhaps, may have
a very slightly steeper learning curve, but I'd imagine most people
could get around it.

A Mac, on the other hand, fresh from a restore, will step the user
through everything. It introuduces them to the system and gives them
an opportunity to understand what they're doing.

If you've given the machine to them before that step, I'd argue that
they're [Macs] easier to navigate anyhow.

&gt;     I think that you may have been thinking of something
&gt; like Installing software, which is an ADMIN task, and in the
&gt; particular scenario we were talking about, the parents
&gt; (USERS) wouldn't be doing this, the son (ADMIN) would. IF
&gt; this were the case, then I think that many people in this
&gt; position would likely shy away from these type of tasks
&gt; which ever OS they used. As far as fixing Linux, the very
&gt; nature of Linux is that non root cannot break something
&gt; important, they can break their own account, but not the
&gt; system. In this case, whoever is ADMIN can easily fix it
&gt; without a full reinstall by deleting and recreating the
&gt; account at worst.

Yeah, that's true, but users need to be able to fix certain problems
without someone holding their hand. The fact that the machine will be
administered by a person who has a portion of a clue does not mean
that you don't need to worry about keeping administration easy.

I understand "the very nature of Linux". I understand that. But, we're
not just talking about Linux. I think Apple came into the equation
somewhere.

In the longer term, the Mac is a more sensible option. If "Dad" comes
home with a new printer, scanner or mouse (as Fathers tend to do),
it'll just work when you plug it into a Mac (or a Windows box, for
that matter). I'm affraid I can't say the same for Linux in a similar
situation.

&gt;     In the case of a major break, the ADMIN person would do
&gt; the reinstall anyhow, so what difference does it make to
&gt; which OS you use in the first place. I think the original
&gt; point was that the users of this system were unlikely to
&gt; play and break anything, but even if they did, the admin
&gt; probably wouldn't trust them to just stick a CD in and press
&gt; a few buttons. So I still think that for this application,
&gt; Linux is probably the best solution. The only thing I would
&gt; add is that in this case M$ is probably the worst solution
&gt; in that a USER has complete admin like access (unless you
&gt; are using NT or such like) and all it takes is one of those
&gt; "delete this important file because it is a virus" emails,
&gt; and you could be in real trouble with a complete novice with
&gt; admin like access. Well that's my 2c worth.

In the case of a major break, you don't want to have to burden your
administrator with hours of unnecessary stuffing around just because
you can. Stick a CD in and press a button. That's how it should be.

Linux may be a reasonable solution, I don't doubt that. However, when
you consider the merits of the other solutions, I think the Mac comes
out in front.

&gt; P.S. why do I always get mail from you on the list as a
&gt; message with a mail attachment? It isn't a big thing but I
&gt; usually don't get it from anyone else who regularly posts.

Eh? D'you mean the PGP signature?

&gt; It might be a setting on your mail client you might like to
&gt; check out.

Nup, thanks. I like my PGP signature as it is.
