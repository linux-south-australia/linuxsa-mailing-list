Seen this before with an earlier release of Mozilla, there is just
something extra that you need to copy across in order to get the VM
working. .... can't remember what it was though? I did dual installs of
mozilla and netscape 6 to see what the difference was though.
That reminds me I need to set this up again after reinstaling the OS.

IF I get it working I'll post the results.

&gt;Okay, what are you linking to, then? For 1.4.0, I've symlinked to:
&gt;
&gt;   $JAVA_HOME/jre/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji.so
&gt;
&gt;That version of the plugin should work with most latter versions of
&gt;Mozilla (something like 0.9+).
&gt;


Damn! Me and my big mouth, the java 1.4.0 plugin was working for me last
night
till I upgraded Mozilla to a later v1.0 dot point release (cooker update)

Now the java plugin doesn't work, and doesn't show up in the list of
plugins,
even though I've reinstalled (relinked) the plugin.  I did notice Mozilla
1.0
uses a /usr/lib/mozilla-1.0.0 directory rather than the old
/usr/lib/mozilla,
thats on my Mdk 8.2 system, not sure if its any different for other
distros.

The plugin from the ns40 directory is listed in about:plugins, however it
doesn't associate itself with application/x-java-vm, only the java beans
stuff,
which as I understand it is only the applets etc.

Mozilla doesn't give any errors when starting, but if I try Galeon, which
uses
the Mozilla engine, it gives the following error:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library
/usr/lib/jre-1.4.0/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji140.so
[/usr/lib/jre-1.4.0/plugin/i386/ns610/libjavaplugin_oji140.so: undefined
symbol: GetGlobalServiceManager__16nsServiceManagerPP17nsIServiceManager]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interestingly enough I tried java 1.3 and it came up with the same problem
with
the older version of the plugin, maybe there's a bug in Mozilla???  I've
yet
to try rolling back Mozilla versions to see if it makes any difference.

Sigh................
