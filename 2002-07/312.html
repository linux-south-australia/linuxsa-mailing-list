Hi Shane,
    The first question to ask is: Is it Broke? And I am sure
you know the answer that: If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

    If you are just running a web server/firewall machine,
then the best way to upgrade it is to simply apply any
security patches and upgrade only the limited number of
services you should be running that have security issues.
This means that instead of upgrading the entire machine, all
you need to do is upgrade the unsecure bits. The other thing
that this usually means is that you usually are only offline
for a very short period of time because you only have to
shut down the services while you upgrade them in many cases
and the other services are still available while you do.

    I can assure you from experience that just sticking the
disk in the drive and pushing upgrade will cause you a fair
bit of downtime as often newer versions of software,
especially in a 7.1-7.3 upgrade will have quite different
config files, and you will end up having to fix all of the
system, instead of just the service you upgrade manually.
The overwhelming response I got from the members of this
list (amongst others) when I cried for help was that next
time, only fix it if it is broken. The other thing is that
if you do a limited manual upgrade, you will know
immediately if you have broken a service when you test it
(you do test things straight away don't you?), so this means
you fix it straight away. I got into trouble because the
upgrade I did ended up breaking things I didn't expect it
to, and so I spent most of my time identifying the other
things instead of keeping my server up.

    If you feel you must do a hardware upgrade (probably
also unnecessary), then the easiest way to do this is
probably build up a second machine, configure it so it is
ready to hook up to the net, then disconnect your existing
machine from the net, copy over the files you need in any
db, then connect the new machine to the net. You may only
have to bring down apache for a few minutes while you do the
copy and then start apache on the new machine and not have
to disconnect from the net at all. Even so, it should only
mean a short period of time depending on what data you have
to transfer between machines.

    I might point out that a hardware upgrade may be
unnecessary at all. HotMail (before Uncle Bill bought it)
used to run on an old 486 (might have been a low power
Pentium but it doesn't really matter) for ages and served
it's purpose quite well in all that time. I read somewhere
that the only reason they upgraded it was that it got a bit
embarrassing talking to people from the media who thought it
was a much more powerful setup than it really was. I think
that the funniest thing about it was that when Uncle Bill
took it over, M$ tried to get it to run on a number of their
servers and it failed miserably so they had to switch it
back until they got it fixed.

    I suppose the last advice I could give you is think
carefully before you upgrade a Linux Server, you may not
have to upgrade it at all. One of the biggest selling points
of Linux is it's reliability on older hardware, so by all
means upgrade it if you want to do the exercise, but don't
get into the mindset of upgrading for the sake of it. Hope
this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Installation question


&gt; Hi There.
&gt;
&gt; I am looking at upgrading my web server from RH7.1 to
RH7.3.  I do
&gt; not want to take the machine off line for a significant
period of
&gt; time while I perform the install and set everything up on
it.
&gt;
&gt; In such a situation when installing Windows, I would
handle this by
&gt; doing a partial install on one machine, and then
completing the
&gt; installation on the target machine.
&gt;
&gt; Can someone tell me if you can do a similar sort of thing
with Linux?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Shane.
