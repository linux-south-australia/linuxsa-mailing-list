Hi all,

The ISP I work for uses spamassasin on incoming mail only but just marks it as
being spam before sending it on to the user. It is then up to the user to
implement filtering or to report it SpamCop etc.

IANAL but I don't think you could call it an invasion or privacy.

I think it is a good idea in that it let's the user see just how much UCE they
are receiving and also how much they are paying for (ie $1.00 ph for internet
time, spend 5 mins getting your email, all SPAM, 8.3c wasted)

On another note, what do people think about virus scanning the emails coming
into our system. Is it up to the ISP to scan and filter these out or is it up to
the user to have an up-to-date anti-virus program on their machine. Also what
comeback does a user have on the ISP if they contract a virus transmitted to
them via our email server?

Regards

&gt; Subject: [OT] ISP anti-spam
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; There seems to be a movement among ISPs to "help" us by applying spamassasin
&gt; (or similar) to all mail they handle - IN or OUT.
&gt; Is this an invasion of privacy?
&gt; Is such behaviour dangerous, in suggesting to political control freaks that
&gt; Internet Control is possible and desirable?
&gt; Would it be MUCH better for all users to be encouraged to use spam filters,
&gt; if they wish?
&gt;
&gt; What do people think on these and related issues?
&gt;
