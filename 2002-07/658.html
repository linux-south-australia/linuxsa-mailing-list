Quoting Damien Uern &lt;<A HREF="mailto:carrigan@ozonline.com.au">carrigan@ozonline.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Okay, for the many reasons I have stated in earlier posts, I don't think
&gt; Linux 
&gt; is a third rate solution. And it can also provide a decent computing 
&gt; experience for poorer schools because it can be run on throw away hardware. 

Ah, but what exactly are you trying to do with Linux? GUI / Usability fluff 
requires nice hardware. KDE and Gnome aren't exactly fast. Mozilla and 
OpenOffice are dog-slow compared to their Microsoft (IE, Office) counterparts.
 
It's very quick when all I'm running is a few Eterms under Blackbox, but I 
really wouldn't want to teach kids how to use the command line.

&gt; &gt; I don't know if you've been on the blackboard side of a classroom,
&gt; &gt; but coherency and consitency is really important when you are
&gt; &gt; trying to teach.  A lot of subject design uses the coherency of
&gt; &gt; the subject to teach the basics, and then something more
&gt; &gt; complicated, and then something really interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; The whole consistency with the user interface thing is bollocks, all the 
&gt; programs use the same paradigm. And anyway, we're talking about KIDS here, 
&gt; not some old technophobe who's gonna go "oh dear option X isn't in the file 
&gt; menu, but in the options menu, this is so hard". "Oh this program looks 
&gt; slightly different to this other program, oh dear, oh woe is me". (note the 
&gt; sarcasm :)

Yes. We're talking about kids: people with very short attention spans and with 
less intellect than most adults. The ideal situation is that a button which 
does something in one place should do /exactly the same thing/ when found in 
another place. People remember process before they remember meaning: they'll 
remember that to save a file they'll need to click "File", then "Save", not 
that "File" is a logical place to put the "Save" function. That sort of 
understanding comes later.

It only seems consistent to us because we're used to it. I remember it making 
no damn sense whatsoever 5 years or so (or was it 4?) ago. (/usr? /usr/local? 
What the hell? Why are configuration files in /etc, and not something sensible 
like /conf?)

&gt; The command line thing is rubbish, my first computer was a C64, I wrote basic
&gt; programs more than 100 lines long when i was 8 or 9. My first x86 PC had DOS
&gt; on it, and I rejected win95 because Dos + Norton Commander was WAY faster for
&gt; doing stuff. GUI isn't everything, kids aren't scared of technology like 
&gt; adults are, they'll _try_ to break it :).

Good work. It's taken my younger sister (15, at the time) over a year to work 
out how to move, delete, and create files in a directory-based filesystem. I 
don't want to think about having to teach her how to move files that she 
can't "see". 

Some people just "get" computers. They know why things happen. Most people 
don't. They remember process. In the end, they shouldn't need to know 
the 'why'. It's not their job: it's ours.

Personally, I'm not an advocate of dumbed down interfaces, because they make my 
job hell. Quite often, it's a case of poor targeting: Microsoft seems to assume 
that nobody using the computer actually knows what they're doing, including the 
administrators. This is why I use Linux and FreeBSD: I know what I'm doing, and 
if I don't, I have enough background to understand the accompanying manuals. 
I've set up a development environment which works extremely well for me, 
because I know how to, and the OS is complex and configurable enough to allow 
for it. I can call up the appropriate log files when something goes wrong. If 
all else fails, I can read the source code. I don't have to play hit-and-miss 
with problems, because can understand what is going on.

Most users don't have nearly enough technical background to know 
what "Permission denied" really means, or how the UNIX permissions system 
works. Some don't even know what "Disk full" means. Under Windows and MacOS, a 
reboot/reinstall will fix most operating system problems. Under Linux, they'll 
need to possibly compile the kernel with a new driver, work around an RPM 
dependency problem (grr!), change permissions on files, remove their broken 
window manager configuration, etc.

Linux works for me, as a developer and an administrator, because most programs 
are developed by people who assume that I know what I'm doing. Windows or MacOS 
works for everybody else, because it's developed by people who assume that 
their users aren't paid to bitshift 8 hours a day.
