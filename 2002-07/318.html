It's nasty, but the error you've got looks a bit like there's a hardware
problem with the new harddrive.

Anecdotal knowledge suggests that most new harddrives have a few bad
sectors, but they get mapped out on the first error and don't show up
again. Thus, I usually run a once-over on all new harddrives I get before
using them.

For you, I'd suggest running something like
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
on your harddrive. (from a bootCD or something)
That's totally destructive though, be warned.

After doing that, power the PC off, wait, then power back up and restore
from your last backup.

If you're still getting bad read errors on sectors after that, it's
warranty time for the harddrive.

I'd stick with Seagate and Fujitsu, they've been good to me over the
years, in terms of lasting without problems.

&gt; Hi

&gt; I'm having some fairly serious problems with a SCSI disk in
&gt; a Linux server I administer and would be grateful for any
&gt; help you can offer.
&gt;
&gt; -----
&gt; Dell PowerEdge 2450
&gt; 2 x Intel Pentium III
&gt; Adaptec 7899P SCSI controller
&gt; 1 x Seagate UW SCSI 18 GB (scsi 0:0:0) (/dev/sda)
&gt; 1 x Fujitsu UW SCSI 18 GB (scsi 0:0:1) (/dev/sdb)
&gt; Red Hat Linux 7.3
&gt; Linux 2.4.18 (?)
&gt; -----
&gt;
&gt; This afternoon the server hung and all my terminal sessions
&gt; on the machine displayed a message about a failed assertion
&gt; in do_get_write_access() (presumably from the kernel).  I
&gt; went to the server room and saw the following error on the
&gt; system console:
&gt;
&gt; -----
&gt; kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 1 lun 0\
&gt; return code = 10000
&gt;  I/O error: dev 08:13, sector 49272
&gt; [repeated a few times on various sectors]
&gt; EXT3-fs error (device sd(8,17)): ext3_readdir:\
&gt; directory #863415 contains a hole at offset 0
&gt; -----
&gt;
&gt; I had similar errors a few weeks ago, and after rebooting
&gt; neither the OS nor the SCSI BIOS could detect the SCSI disk.
&gt; The disk was replaced with a new disk which was mostly
&gt; identical except for the vendor (old disk was Seagate, new
&gt; disk was Fujitsu -- replaced under warranty), I restored
&gt; from our most recent backup, took the opportunity to upgrade
&gt; to the latest Red Hat Linux kernel package (which includes a
&gt; more recent aic7xxx driver), and things worked again.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know much about SCSI, so I would appreciate any
&gt; ideas about what the problem could be (solutions would be
&gt; good too!).
&gt;
&gt; This was the brief version.  Let me know if you want more
&gt; information or logs (most of which are actually on the
&gt; server that went down, but I can try to bring it back up.)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help.
&gt;
