Yeah right, lets force an inferior product on the school kids
because we can.  Whoo hoo, that will win Open Source Religion
converts.  After all everyone that's been to a Catholic school
has gotten religion and joined the Jesuits :-)

I don't know if you've been on the blackboard side of a classroom,
but coherency and consitency is really important when you are
trying to teach.  A lot of subject design uses the coherency of
the subject to teach the basics, and then something more
complicated, and then something really interesting.

Linux's user interface sucks.  You're going to burn classroom
hours and kid's energy explaining why OpenOffice doesn't work
the same as Mozilla, which doesn't work the same as GNOME/KDE.
And then there's the command-line intruding upon everything,
itself massively complex and contradictory.  And you're not
trying to teach kids how to navigate a nightmare user interface:
you're trying to help them learn digital photography, or english,
or design.

It's not as bad as the traditional UNIX interface.  But still far
too bad to pretend that there's a coherency of design and a
consitency of use.

At the moment Linux is the third-best desktop operating system.
I see no reason why kids should be forced to use third-rate tools
to meet some ideology.

Why don't you go away and make Linux a first-rate user experience.

Once you've done that you won't need to talk to schools about
adopting it.  Schools *want* an alternative to Mac and Windows.
It's the Open Source/Free Software community which is letting them
down

There have been decades of negotiation about consitent user interfaces
for the UNIX system and then the GNU/Linux system and it's still a mess.
That says a hell of a lot about its developer's attitudes to users outside
of the Slashdot cult.

Regards,
Glen

BTW, OpenOffice is slow because it is running over Wind/U,
a API that lets programs run above Window or UNIX without
rewriting.  This is a neat trick, but it makes OpenOffice
an amazing time and resoruce hog.  It's only the lack of
a viable alternative which makes OpenOffice at all
attractive.

Windows doesn't pre-load the Office DLLs as far as I can see
on a just-booted XP system.  You can configure Office to load
a toolbar which is launched on startup, but equally you can
turn that off.
