On Wed, 31 Jul 2002 17:36, you imparted:
&gt; I don't have an entire PC, but i've got a bunch of old harddrives and a
&gt; pentium 166 CPU you can have if you like?

we'lll take anything offered that isnt broken and rusty (someone once donated 
a trailerload of parts - all of which were dead/rusty/unusable - we turned 
out to be a concevnient way to dump stuff:((( )

thanks for your generosity! email me off list to arrange:))

&gt; By the way, when I was at a festival early this year, I had a chat to a
&gt; hippy girl who was moderately fluent with Linux, but had never seen
&gt; Windows. Why? Because she had been given the PC by Computerbank and it
&gt; came pre-installed with a Linux distro. (I think it might have been an
&gt; interstate version of computerbank tho')

victoria is hugely ahead of us, they have done east timor and fiji donations..
but they refer local stuff to us now, so who can say?

we find windows users are pleasantly surprised, newbies are wide open to 
possibilities.....

its such a rewarding experience:)))

&gt; Anyway.. I just thought that was nice in several ways.

so do we:))))

&gt; (and I wish my first PC had been running Linux.. dos was icky :/   )

me too - cp/m was - umm - interesting:)

r:))
