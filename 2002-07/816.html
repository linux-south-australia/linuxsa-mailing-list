Ditto to that -- I have an old HP Laserjet 6 that had a hard life in an 
office, but is still running. Toner cartridges last forever, and aren't 
too expensive to get refilled anyway.

The price of ink for bubblejets is absolutely rediculous, and for some 
reason the ones i've owned have always had trouble with some lines being 
darker than others, so stuff looks bad.

Just make sure you get a decent printer though -- there are a few 
ultra-cheap laserprinters which are rather dumb and won't give you much 
joy. I think the cheap panasonics were one to avoid. Check for postscript 
capability -- if it has it, thats a good sign.

&gt; I agree, I found an old HP laserjet 4 at a Cash Converters.
&gt; If you're looking at new lasers though make sure it's a "real" printer,
&gt; lots of the cheapy ones are like winmodems and only work in M$.
