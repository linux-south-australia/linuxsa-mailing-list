David,

I didn't do anything special as far as I know. If you've got conflicting
drivers try uninstalling them first, and then make sure you have the right
kernel patch. (nVidia has a script in their linux drivers page to determine
which ones you need.)

There is a text file too with instructions. I didn't follow them the first
time and managed to screw up my display and couldn't get into X.

you might need to edit the xf86config and remove some options there
&lt;snip&gt;

(sec-03) EDITING YOUR XF86CONFIG FILE
__________________________________________________________________________

When XFree86 4.0 was released, it used a slightly different XF86Config
file syntax than the 3.x series did, and so to allow both 3.x and 4.x
versions of XFree86 to co-exist on the same system, it was decided that
XFree86 4.x was to use the configuration file "/etc/X11/XF86Config-4"
if it existed, and only if that file did not exist would the file
"/etc/X11/XF86Config" be used (actually, that is an over-simplification
of the search criteria; please see the XF86Config man page for a complete
description of the search path).  Please make sure you know what
configuration file XFree86 is using.  If you are in doubt, look for a
line beginning with "(==) Using config <A HREF="file:">file:</A>" in your XFree86 log file
("/var/log/XFree86.0.log").  This README will use "XF68Config" to refer
to your configuration file, whatever it is named.

If you do not have a working XF86Config file, there are several ways
to start: there is a sample config file that comes with XFree86, and
there is a sample config file included with the NVIDIA_GLX package (it
gets installed in /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/).  You could also use
a program like 'xf86config'; some distributions provide their own tool
for generating an XF86Config file.  For more on XF86Config file syntax,
please refer to the man page.

If you already have an XF86Config file working with a different driver
(such as the 'nv' or 'vesa' driver), then all you need to do is find
the relevant Device section and replace the line:

        Driver "nv"
    (or Driver "vesa")

with

        Driver "nvidia"

In the Module section, make sure you have:

        Load   "glx"

You should also remove the following lines:

        Load  "dri"
        Load  "GLcore"

Simon,

Did you do anything special to get it to work in OpenGL accelerated
mode? I've got two systems here with TNT/TNT2 class cards in them and
neither will do accelerated OpenGL, even with the nVidia drivers
installed - I suspect (but haven't had time to check) that there are
conflicting GL libraries on these systems (both running SuSE linux).

Thanks,

Dave
