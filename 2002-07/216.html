Hi,
     Personally I have not had a problem with the VIA KT266A SDRAM and I
have a friend running the newer VIA KT333 DDR RAM the only issue he has
is the AC97 sound not being picked up.

We have had some issues with MS Xp on the VIA KT333 using DDR RAM not
shutting the system down properly and registering a RAM problem when
trying to reboot, The owner finally consented to trying linux (Mandrake
8.2 ) but try as we might we cannot reproduce the problem with linux.
  His AC97 sound card is recognised. His AGP geforce mx200 is recognised
his linmodem worked with patch, and with a few patches from the linux
games site his WarCraft is working (at a better frame rate than windows
gives him) Losing all her AOL and ICQ contacts but we transfered them
and she has one app (everbuddy)that lets her talk to both groups. and
her files and setting are seperate from his so her email doesn't flood
his mailbox anymore. Now he's pissed at the money he spent for XP when
it didn't work properly on his hardware (Can't "win" everything).

 &gt; Hi all,
 &gt; In addition to my internet searches I would like to see if any one on
 &gt; this list has any views on the following:
 &gt;
 &gt; Does linux run well (or better) on any of the following mother boards?
 &gt;
 &gt; Asus A7V333 or A7V266-E.
 &gt;
 &gt; MSI KT3Ultra or KT266 Pro 2A.
 &gt;
 &gt; A lot of people seem happy with the Asus boards and the newer VIA
 &gt; Athlon chipsets. On the other hand, I hear of issues with MSI boards
 &gt; and earlier VIA chipsets, especially with Linux. Howerver, people do
 &gt; indicate that the MSI boards are more stable than usual when using the
 &gt; VIA KT266A and VIA KT333 chipsets.
 &gt;
 &gt; Any opinions or experiences?
 &gt;
 &gt; Dale.
