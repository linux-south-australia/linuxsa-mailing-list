&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I have a rather annoying problem with a dual boot
&gt; desktop at present. It works fine with the Redmond Product,
&gt; but when I boot Linux (Suse 7.2 Pro) I discovered I couldn't
&gt; surf with Netscape. On further investigation (I initially
&gt; thought it was a DNS problem), I came across the following
&gt; error msg in the boot log:
&gt; 
&gt; Setting up network device eth0
&gt; doneSetting up IPv6 network interface (no address)done
&gt; Setting up routing (using /etc/route.conf)
&gt; Error while excuting:
&gt;     /sbin/route add -net 203.XX.YYY.193 netmask 255.255.0.0
&gt; gw 203.XX.YYY.193 dev eth0
&gt;     route: netmask doesn't match route address

I would suggest two things:

1) network addresses are all 0's in the host part, so your address
should be 203.XX.0.0 if the netmask is correct. Alternately, if you
meant "-net 203.XX.YYY.192", then your netmask probably should have
been "255.255.255.192" or 255.255.255.224 or ...240 or ...248 or
...252, depending on the size of your subnet (that's /26, /27, /28,
/29 and /30 respectively -- meaning the number of bits in the network
address ... )

2) Your gateway appears to be on the network you are routing. The
gateway needs to be accessible -- on your current network or some
other accessible route. It is the "gateway" (forget the jargon, think
garden gate) to the network you are specifying. What you are saying
above is: "to get to this area, go via this gate", and if the gate is
only accessible from in the area, it won't work :)

2) 203.anything is a Class C network, so your netmask has to be at
least 255.255.255.0 ...
<A HREF="http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2002/IPaddressing.html">http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2002/IPaddressing.html</A>

Briefly, network classes, while being superseded by the CIDR concept,
are still important, and I have a feeling that any CIDR networks
(anything with other than 255 or 0 in the netmask) need to actually
subnet an old style network class -- you can't aggregate 16 class C's
into one /20 network AFAIK...

&gt; Setting up routingfailed
&gt; 
&gt;     Now I know that the Netmask here is wrong (everything
&gt; else uses 255.255.255.192), but it occurred to me that if it
&gt; was something different I don't have a clue how to calculate
&gt; a Netmask anyhow, and after a bit of a search I couldn't
&gt; find anything on the Net about how to either. Further to
&gt; this problem, the 255.255.255.192 works on all the M$ boxes
&gt; and my Server, but when I tried to manually run the command
&gt; as root on the Linux Desktop with what I thought to be the
&gt; correct Netmask, I got the same error. Now I have had a
&gt; routing problem before that was solved when someone kindly
&gt; calculated the Netmask for me (ie 255.255.255.192), but to
&gt; be honest I just took their word for it because it worked.
&gt; Can someone help me out here and show me and everybody else
&gt; here who might have run into this problem - How do you
&gt; calculate a Netmask? Any suggestions as to why the route
&gt; command doesn't work for other resons would also be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
