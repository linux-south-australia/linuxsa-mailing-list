Hmm, i tell you what my brain was frazzled for a week after tc, i need a bit
of soothing...

it all become much clearer when i read the line 'you can only shape outgoing
traffic' and it all fell into place.   i didn't have any joy from that
security focus thing, but found it easier in the advanced routing howto.
IPChains/IPTables chains marking then using tc to slow it down didn't work
for me.  as in i got it going with just tc and marking the IP in my tc
script.  the only limitation of that is that you can't (we'll i couldn't
figure it out) mark different ports on the same IP, so if you we're to do
that you'd need to mark with tables/chains and then do the tc thing..

thought i'd post my script here for you to take a look if you're
interested....   so ava look at the bottom...  this seems to work, but i've
only enough understanding to look at someone elses example and have a crack.
seems to be limiting fine tho....

for accounting purposes only, i found that ipac was brilliant,  just a
simple conf file with very easy rules and it just sits on top of iptables
with a bit of a database to record should the iptables totals become
zeroed//

anyway i think that it's all going nicley now...

thanks for feedback people.
regards
M

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; just been bending my brain around this Traffic Control stuff, and i read

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Anyway back to banging my head against my Advanced Routing Howto.  Anybody
&gt; can explain to me what the crock half of this stuff means?  :)

I feel your pain.. That stuff took me ages to figure out.

it seems to work well once you've done it though. What in particular did
you want to do? I might be able to help out with some recipes.

(My use was "stop housemates using all the bandwidth" - then telstra
capped us anyway, and the problem became accounting, instead of shaping)


Something that might help you, is to imagine that you've got a cascading
pyramid fountain thing. Like, lots of troughs which overflow into some of
the ones below them. Then imagine that the water for the fountain is
either poured into the top trough, or else you can insert some of it into
other troughs directly. Now expand on the analogy by imagining that the
troughs are different sizes, so some take longer than others to overflow.

Got that? I don't know how much it'll help your understanding of traffic
shaping, but its a pretty soothing mental image, and might help you get to
sleep after fighting 'tc' all day.
