But it is...

	Hi Greg,

	As you would have seen, there were plenty of smileys at the end of my
	post, indicating that I was joking.  I was giving David a hard time, and
	I don't think the humour was lost on him.

 Michael, you could easily give me a HARD time but then there's the matter of
your gender (1), your marital status (2) and your personal beliefs (3)....

DSL

(1) i.e. we appear to be both male -- although people always mistake me
as female

(2) whilst I am not married, you are ---&gt; you should *behave* and I have
publicly stated I don't do married people (I may have even said MEN)

(3) irrespective of gender, isn't it NORTI for a married man to give anyone
apart from his partner a "hard time"?

LMAO
