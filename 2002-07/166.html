&gt; Ive reported spam to ozemail, and although their report form is very

&gt; just gets more - again and again. This isnt really a case of them
&gt; ignoreing him, but rather being constantly targetted by him.

that's true but ozemail/uunet/blah are still useless.  Of all the spam
complaints I've sent them, about 10% of the time I get the automated
repsonse, the rest nothing.

Why is it only ozemail/etc that have this problem?  Why don't they
simply say that on a prepaid account (where you don't need any id to
get it as I understand it, which I thought wasn't allowed anyway same
as for prepaid mobiles) you can only send say 20 (or some suitable
number) of emails every hour?  that'd solve it.
