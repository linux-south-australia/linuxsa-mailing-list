Hi everyone,
just been bending my brain around this Traffic Control stuff, and i read at
the bottom of <A HREF="http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:">http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:</A>

Another way of making use of traffic shaping for security purposes is
limiting the amount of ICMP-unreachables that a firewall can return within a
given amount of time. This way, a proper portscan would take much more time
to do. As long as there is no answer to a portscan packet, the portscanner
will not know for sure if the port is open or not. Slow scanning is the only
way to know for sure and when the firewall is protecting a large number of
hosts; however, slow scanning could take weeks. During that time, the
portscanner is clearly visible and that's something most portscanners will
try to avoid. This can be done by defining traffic shape classes for the PPP
interface, just as we did for the eth0 interface.


What do people thing about this for an idea?  At first glance i would have
thought that this would slow down legitimate use, but perhaps not?  I havn't
even thought about any rules in iptables etc but i found it a very
interesting thought....


Anyway back to banging my head against my Advanced Routing Howto.  Anybody
can explain to me what the crock half of this stuff means?  :)

regards
M
