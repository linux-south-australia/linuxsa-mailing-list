I like 'E' its a cool window manager. That said, it does not mean that the 
creator, Aka Rasterman is fortune teller.
Like all people he bases his views on his current perceptions of how things 
are progressing in Linux Land.

Some of us have different experiences and hence different views on how well 
Linux will do/is doing.
What can be said with some certainty, however, is that things change, its 
the natural order of 'things'.

What some people forget is that the world is BIG and POPULATED and 
POOR.  In the grand scheme of things, Microsoft is doing really well, on 
the desktop and, that's if we look in our own backyard.

The Western countries have certainly adopted Microsoft on the Desktop, but 
Microsoft's other war front, the server, is not fairing so well. Halting 
Microsoft on the server front should not be underestimated, particularly as 
'as SUN puts it' the Internet is just a big network. Once the server war is 
won, and, of that not many people would disagree, although it is not 
certain, the desktop becomes easier. The adoption rates in poorer countries 
will accelerate regardless on how much money Microsoft spends buying 
favours from politicians and power brokers.  Ordinary people will look for 
an edge, a fix, a solution, a means of creating a better standard of living 
for themselves and their children. That can only be done if the tools are 
available for them to use, GPL'/OSS anyone?

With China, India and the East in general making up a huge portion of the 
population there is no alternative to FREE.

Also don't forget, that governments are just people, China might want to 
keep people in the dark, America might wake up to the fact that Big 
Business is not the be-all and end all of power.  Worldcom anyone? 
Governments change when new people take the helm.

Europe might want to compete with the USA on the IT front, using and 
supporting US companies is not the best way forward. The list is endless.


Sheesh time to end rant,  the common Linux desktop is inevitable (IMHO)

&gt;No-one ever said it was going to be easy :) There seems to be another person
&gt;every week saying that Linux on the desktop is dead, yet the apps and
&gt;improvements keep coming regardless. Also the profile of Linux is getting
&gt;better, it is being taken seriously in mission critical environments. Sure
&gt;it's being perceived as a cheap backroom server that'll just keep running,
&gt;but before that it was perceived only as a toy.
&gt;
&gt;People keep predicting Linux will fail here, there and everywhere, yet they
&gt;keep getting proven wrong. Where there is a will there is a way, and there is
&gt;a *lot* of will out there.
&gt;
&gt;I think the key to getting Linux on desktops and in peoples minds, is 
&gt;schools.
&gt;Kids will want to have what they use at school, and they get to take a copy
&gt;home, legally. According to the K12 project, setting up a terminal server
&gt;classroom with a beasty application server and some recycled machines turned
&gt;into thin clients, reduces the cost of the _hardware_ by half. Then comes the
&gt;fact u can stick a copy of redhat on the server for nothing, or if u want
&gt;support for that server, buy a single copy.
&gt;
&gt;Typical high school applications are certainly plentiful (word processing
&gt;etc), and of course it's a fantastic environment for computer programming (we
&gt;learnt toolbook and logowriter at my school, um.. yay, how about some C?? or
&gt;some scripting languages, or Java, ie something useful). I'm not too sure
&gt;about educational programs for little kids though, but the various Linux for
&gt;schools projects are working on that, and the new addition in KDE3 includes
&gt;some educational programs - although rather boring, but that can be fixed.
&gt;
&gt;Also, Tux is cute. Linux is fun, it can appeal to kids. It's a stable, easily
&gt;administrated server. Beige windows environments are BORING! Where are the
&gt;negatives here people? Linux in schools is cheaper, centrally administered,
&gt;easy to update with no downtime (except in kernel upgrade, but why do that if
&gt;the current kernel works?), linux can be fun and cute, it sends a good
&gt;message about sharing and choice and to not just follow your corporate
&gt;masters blindly, provides a better learning environment  - kids will be more
&gt;competent with computers, etc etc.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not giving up on linux until Microsofts marketshare has dwindled
&gt;significantly (and i'm talking like 50% or more). I know things will keep
&gt;improving, regardless of what the naysayers(?) say.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Desktop is dead
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Not too mention the linux apps are appearing. These days there are
&gt; &gt;  &gt; numerous browsers that are pretty good,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; All of which take longer to load than IE, none of which work as well (in
&gt; &gt; terms of web site compatibility - Standards are a different matter and the
&gt; &gt; average desktop user doesn't care.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Excuse me while I play devil's advocate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joe Schmoe knows that if he hits the Big Blue E, and clicks "Connect" he
&gt; &gt; can surf the web.  The majority of Internet users (the ones that ring
&gt; &gt; support anyway) don't understand the distinction between a network
&gt; &gt; connection to the internet, and the software that makes use of that
&gt; &gt; connection.  They don't know that Internet Explorer is a browser, they
&gt; &gt; think Internet Explorer is just how the Internet works.  In that respect I
&gt; &gt; don't think three sluggish browsers with funny names is much of an
&gt; &gt; advantage.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joe Schmoe's employer isn't likely to switch to a Linux desktop because Joe
&gt; &gt; Schmoe has been surfing the web and chatting to his mates on MSN after work
&gt; &gt; every night and is thus already competent in using a Windows GUI.  Besides
&gt; &gt; which, he runs MYOB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Joe Schmoe's son has heard of Linux before, but all the computers at his
&gt; &gt; school run complimentary Microsoft software, all his IT assignments have to
&gt; &gt; be handed up in DOC format, etc., etc., etc.....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How can Linux possibly hope to combat something with so many fingers in
&gt; &gt; such hefty pies?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Besides which, what happens when your desktop must be DRM compliant?
&gt; &gt; Surely open-source is a circumvention device in itself?  Perhaps there are
&gt; &gt; ways around the problem, but while the open source communities scramble,
&gt; &gt; Windows will dominate in countless other ways.
