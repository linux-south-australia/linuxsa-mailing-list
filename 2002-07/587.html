&gt; &gt; Just out of interest, is /tmp really a sensible place for putting Unix
&gt; &gt; sockets?
&gt; 
&gt; I hope there's a special circle in hell for people who abuse /tmp this
&gt; way.  That and storing files in there.  "Can you not have the system
&gt; purge /tmp on bootup?  We've got files in there we need to keep." was
&gt; a request I actually received once (the irony was that it was on
&gt; Solaris, as explained below - they thought I was just being BOFHish
&gt; when I said "no, you can't").

I thought the same too; I've done stupid things in /tmp myself and then
deleted everything in /tmp only to find X or something didn't work.
MySQL sockets used to live there by default and it was a total pain...

&gt; &gt; (side note: I can't remember what OS'es do it, but apparently some OS'es
&gt; &gt; actualy mkfs the /tmp partition because it's quicker than actually
&gt; &gt; fsck'ing it or sumthing like that ;-P)
&gt; 
&gt; As the followups say, Solaris does this by default.  HP-UX can do it,
&gt; but it impacts VM on any system, so why would you?  The increase in
&gt; speed isn't worth it once you hit swap.

Surely you've answered your own question...you would do it, perhaps, on
a system like mine where I have singificant resources to use (for
example I allocate 32Mb to my in-memory netscape cache and I only
download 1/2 of that per week). If, for example, Solaris were a gaming
OS where the games relied more on specialised hardware and a FAST but
TEMPORARY file system, having /tmp in memory would give you a huge
gain...

Just a thought I guess.
