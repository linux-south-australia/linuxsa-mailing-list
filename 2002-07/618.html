&gt; Universities and TAFEs obviously have a different focus. I never saw any
&gt; mention of a Unix type environment at my school, we were Winblows/Netware all
&gt; the way.

Oh, they don't teach...I forgot.

&gt; Universities and TAFEs generally teach about system administration and
&gt; programming in a Unix environment (although i've recently seen an article how
&gt; that's changing and they're offering courses on using Linux as an everyday
&gt; OS).

Do you have any say in their course content? Or are you employed by
TAFE?

&gt; At my university we have Solaris with the pitiful excuse for a desktop
&gt; environment that is CDE. And ordinary people hate it, programmers/science
&gt; students and IT students go in there for maple, programming, etc... if the
&gt; windows rooms are full you'll see some people with an rdpclient window open
&gt; connecting to a windows terminal server. Unix is portrayed as some confusing
&gt; hacker environment with no place on a home computer.

So what; if I bothered about what people called me (geek, gook, slopey
eye and other interesting things) I'd have given up years ago.

&gt; I think you missed my point completely, I hope i've cleared it up (I did make
&gt; a rather long post :)

No you missed my point.
