&gt; Ive been thinking about this problem though. I think what linux needs is
&gt; a disto for the desktop that tryes to do primarily the things office
&gt; people want their workstation to do. Things like word processing,
&gt; browsing, groupware type stuff. 

If Open Office broke their package up into separate executables for the
Word Processor, the Spreadsheet, etc it would load a hell of a lot
faster.  Sure, you'd lose a little integration, but it's nothing good
use of IPC wouldn't fix.

Mozilla is excellent, and pretty.  It's just slow.  Knock out the mail
component of it and it doesn't chew up anywhere as much memory.  Compile
it without any of the talkback crap and turn off debugging, set the
optimisations to high and we're talking a nice piece of software.  They
just need to get some form of Java integrated with their installer - it
can download/find the JDK and set Mozilla up for it - it'd be a lot
easier.

There's lots of plugins available for Mozilla.  Real Player, Shockwave
(the most important these days), MIDI players, Acrobat Reader, etc.

Acrobat is available for Linux.  If it had mouse wheel support it'd be
as good as the Windows version.  But it doesn't yet.  There's a lot of
alternatives, but I don't think they're quite as good as the base
Acrobat from Adobe.

Evolution is about as good as it comes (IMHO) for E-mail. It's pretty
lightweight, it's fast and it's pretty.  On top of all that, it can talk
to Exchange servers (with a plugin) and it's palm-pilot compatible. 
That's good for all the business people out there who need calendaring
and scheduling as well as email.

GIMP is the Photoshop of tools.  I haven't used it for anythign more
than basic image retouching so I can't really comment on it.  It's fast
though, and seems to have a lot of features.  It should be promoted a
lot more than it it - get it in the stores for Windows... there is a
Windows port of it.  That's one of the Killer Apps (TM) that will get
support for Linux. Get Windows people using it, and then show them the
Linux version is even more stable and powerful (and cheaper 'cos you can
build it yourself instead of having to buy a CD... I know it's GNU
software, but the average Schmuck would have a hard time assembling all
the tools required to build GIMP... they just work on Linux).

kxICQ2 works like a treat for those who need ICQ functionality.  There
are other alternatives too... LICQ, GnomeICU, etc.  kxICQ2 drops into
the KDE task bar, however (and that's a good thing). LICQ has a Gnome
plugin that lets it dock into Gnome.  It wouldn't be too hard to write a
KDE GUI plugin for it either.

I use cc-msn for talking on MSN, and that's pretty stable. It's
featureless though.  It was the only package I could get to talk to MSN
though :-(.  

There's lots of tools available.  We need to work on Games for the
market and getting them to work easily.  I just installed QuakeIII and
it's a bitch to make work.  Ok, so when it does work it's fast, smooth
and stable, but it took some reading to get it to use the NVidia GLX
module and not Mesa of 3dFX.

I've been looking at 3D software lately and started finding a lot of
packages to do modelling, rendering, and movies.  They all look
reasonable but I haven't really used them much.

Audio is an area where Linux fails dismally.  There's so many different
sound driver architectures.  ALSA, OSS, etc.  Sure, they all include
compatibility layers with the others, but can't we just pick one
interface standard and go with it?  Then we can work on getting a decent
multi track audio processing/editing suite available.  I've heard talk
of two or three that are supposed to be excellent.  If they're 1/2 as
good as Cool Edit Pro then I'm in.


&gt; If you categorised these needs down,
&gt; then went looking for an app that did what the windows equivalents do, I
&gt; think you'd find 3/4 of the stuff exists. 

You'll find that 100% of the stuff exists, but only 50% with a pretty
interface.  As with the DOS thread, if you need a command line to drive
it, it must be outdated.

&gt; Then if you got some publicity
&gt; with that people would probably start filling in the gaps. When they got
&gt; there, then you'd have your nice simple OS that windows people can use.
&gt; They dont want a choice in GUI, or this or that or anything. 

There was a window manager called QVWM (it was Japanese) that nearly
100% emulated the look and feel of Win95, including the taskbar and dock
and start menu.  Sadly, it stopped running on X3.3.6 (it ran on 3.3.5). 
If you could hook that with some of the apps above and an auto-login
you'd be well on your way to an excellent windows replacement that's
stable, fast and that people might actually use! Naturally, give them a
choice in GUI, but make it really really easy to go back to the Win95
look-alike if they want.

&gt; They just
&gt; want plain and simple intuative tools to do their work. Perhaps said
&gt; distro could even have a team working on modifiying GUIs to make it
&gt; conform to a standard. The apps are almost there, it just needs to be
&gt; pulled together a bit tighter to lessen the learning curve for those
&gt; that dont care.

Well let's make a distro that does all that.  Make some distinction
between system packages and user apps (kernel, X server, etc vs mozilla,
evolution, etc).  That makes it easy for Joe Schmoe to manage what's
installed.

Cheers,
Adam
