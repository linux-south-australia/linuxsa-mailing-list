I found a good source on intrusion monitoring, and I thought I would 
pass it along.

&gt; <A HREF="http://www.honeynet.org/book/">http://www.honeynet.org/book/</A>

 
I read the book last night, and I came away with the impression that the 
following happens when an attack occurs..

1. The blackhat scans your system for a "vulnerability"
2. ' ' gains root by exploiting the "vulnerability" with an exploit script
3. ' ' telnets to the server and uses accounts created by the exploit script
4. ' ' checks to see who is on
5. ' ' edits the log files
6. ' ' replaces system binaries with trojans
7. ' ' downloads rootkit and installs it

Seems with all of the "vulnerabilities" out there, and how often scans 
occur, it is a wonder that most Linux boxen aren't "rooted."

I highly recommend a close look at this site, and their whitepapers.

However, a few things surprised me, and one thing isn't clear to me, but 
I would like some answers if people know them...

Surprised me:

1. The ease and speed in which the Red Hat Linux 5.1/6 boxen were "rooted."

2. The wide variety of operating systems the blackhats claimed to "root."

What is unclear to me:

1. I thought that if you have local IP numbers set up i.e. 192.168.x.x 
or 10.1.X.X behind a router with a masquerraded local IP number, that 
this kind of thing couldn't happen. Am I incorrect?

2. If the use of local IP numbers have little or no effect on intrusion 
deterance, are there any other methodologies that can keep an intruder 
from reaching the vulnerable computer?

Any thoughts?

P.S. Last night, I went to a good used bookstore located near where I 
live. The Amanda Book Buyers Club operates by giving store credit to 
people that bring in their books or SOFTWARE  :-) . The bookstore then 
sells them at a higher price. Turns out that this bookstore (on Castro 
near Books, Inc.) has had all varieties of operating systems and 
computer books there off and on for quite some time.  Saw a book in 
french by a guy named bourne, 2 copies of Richard Stallman's GNU Emacs 
manual circa 1984. The software was kinda sparce last night, but they 
did have one book that caught my eye.
