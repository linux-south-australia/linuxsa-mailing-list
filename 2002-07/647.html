&gt; This comment (and plenty others in this thread) sounds like 
&gt; it might not
&gt; be based on much practical experience, or if so, with a very different
&gt; kind of Windows users than those I've found.
&gt; 
&gt; What I've done a number of times is give Mozilla 1.0 to IE 
&gt; users.  In all
&gt; cases so far the changeover has been quick and painless. You 
&gt; do have to
&gt; make sure the plugins are configured, but after that it is 
&gt; pretty plain
&gt; sailing. (The mail client is a separate and easy sell.)
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't at all like switching from Windows to Unix, but it 
&gt; is a start
&gt; and protects users from ever-increasing IE lockin which should make a
&gt; future transition away from Windows easier. Even if it is two 
&gt; years before
&gt; applications exist that will make a particular Windows user happy to
&gt; consider migrating, moving to Mozilla now is an excellent start.
&gt; 
&gt; I have found a lot of quite basic Windows users are uneasy about the
&gt; things IE might be doing, and even the fact that Mozilla has an
&gt; easily-found control for denying automatic popup windows is 
&gt; reassuring for
&gt; many. Some magazine (PC World, from memory) did a comparison 
&gt; of IE6 and
&gt; Mozilla 1.0 on Windows and concluded that IE had no noticeable speed
&gt; advantage and only a small number of integration advantages 
&gt; and clearly
&gt; they were coming from a Windows perspective. They explicitly included
&gt; rendering in their tests. Maybe someone here can come up with a URL.

You should see how fast Open Office is propogating around here since I gave
someone a cd with v1.0 on it. (and not just with geeks either).
