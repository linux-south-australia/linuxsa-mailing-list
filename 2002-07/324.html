&gt; Hi Toby
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It's nasty, but the error you've got looks a bit like there's a
&gt; hardware
&gt; &gt; problem with the new harddrive.
&gt;
&gt; It does, doesn't it?  What worries me is the first hard disk
&gt; that failed was under two years old, and the replacement one
&gt; was new.  I am wondering if perhaps there is a problem with
&gt; the power or cabling that is causing some damage to the disk.
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Two disks on the same channel seems too coincidental for it to just be a
&gt; random hard disk error.

True, but never underestimate the power of Coincedences!


&lt;anecdote mode on - skip this if you like, contains no relevant info&gt;
I had a similar problem last week.. Machine went down for a reboot, and
wouldn't come back up. In the end had to resort to swapping one component
in and out at a time to try and find the problem.
It turned out it was the video card, but unfortunately the other video
card I was swapping in was broken as well, so I didn't pick up on the
video card being at fault until trying every component individually in
another machine.
Then, probably due to the large number of power cycles, one of the ancient
harddrives in the machine died and stopped the machine booting, just after
we'd finally decided it must be the video card at fault..
&lt;/anecdote&gt;
