&gt;&gt; I'm not sure where Postgres keeps its uncommitted transactions these
&gt;&gt; days, but that could be the problem.  Do you specifically need
&gt;&gt; transaction semantics?  Note that it does pay to do a batch of
&gt;&gt; inserts within a transaction, because this speeds up the inserts
&gt;&gt; no end (at least, this used to be the case - I haven't tried it on
&gt;&gt; recent Postgres's's to see if that's changed).

&gt; I've started investigating Postgres because of its transaction
&gt; capabilities.

But there is a difference between using and abusing, which is why I
asked do you specifically need transaction semantics when importing
data.  You shouldn't be performing what's basically a data import
inside a transaction (but then see the caveat below).

&gt; 1) Importing the data into MySQL didn't cause my disk to thrash (it's
&gt; not the quietest disk and I can hear it when it's going)
&gt; 2) Importing the data into Postgres caused my disk to really go wild

Unfortunately (and this is what I was alluding to with the "batch of
inserts"), Postgres commits every insert that occurs outside of a
"begin; ...; commit;" pair.  One way[1] to get around it is to batch
the transactions - 100 or so inserts inside a transaction.  Another
way is to switch off fast sync on the postmaster/backends (a flag
on the more recent versions), but you'd want to make damn sure you
didn't care about losing your data (or have an appropriate UPS
backing it up).  There was a third method I used to use, but my
ailing brain has failed (fled?) me.

&gt; Do you have leprosy?

No, that's my natural skin colour.


[1]  Most of this is based on 6.5.3 - I've used 7.1.3, but 
not to that deep a level.  And I've never managed to get
myself successfully signed onto the postgres mailing lists.
