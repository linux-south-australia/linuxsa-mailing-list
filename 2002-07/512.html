David,
I have already inserted in /etc/modules.conf

# alias eth1 100d1483 [which is the inserted module]

but still get an unknown device error.  As you suggested I checked the
/etc/sysconfig/network-script/ifcfg-eth*

there is a eth0 there which is my 10/100 nic, but there is no eth1 which is
supposed to be my adsl card.

If I do an lsmod I can see the module there but it says that it is used by
nothing.

If i do a ifconfig eth1 it comes up but the first line says

eth1      Linkencap UNSPEC         HWaddr     00-00-00-00-00-00-00 (lots of
oo's)

I dont have the source file for the driver

The driver that I have came with an executable called 100dconfig which
allows such commands as
./100dconfig version
which brings the the same result as the ifconfig eth1 but with another error

ITEX_GET_CONFIG_1483: Operation not supported

In /var/log messages there is a few lines indication that the module has
been inserted properly however the last 2 say
kernel # 100d_close  vc is NULL!
kernel # modprobe cannot locate module connect

By the way I am using Internode Professional with a static IP address. I am
not sure if a setserial command would help the card be recognised

Cheers and thanks for all of your help

&gt; Christian
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am trying to set up my Linux box  (Red Hat 7.3) as an adsl router with
a
&gt; &gt; D-Link dsl-100d pci card.
&gt;
&gt; :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have downloaded the drivers from the d-link site but when I insert the
&gt; &gt; module into the kernal and then enter
&gt; &gt; # ifconfig eth1 up
&gt;
&gt; Check what is in:
&gt;
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*
&gt;
&gt; ...[ where * is some number ]. These are the configuration scripts for
&gt; ethernet devices under RedHat 7.3.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; i get a unknown device error even after checking that the the driver has
&gt; &gt; been inserted properly
&gt;
&gt; If it's loaded as a module, you'll need something in /etc/modules.conf.
&gt; Here is a sample entry for my own NIC:
&gt;
&gt; [root]# cat modules.conf
&gt; ...
&gt; alias eth0 ne2k-pci
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; You probably already know the name of the module that you're using, but
&gt; if you don't they normally reside in:
&gt;
&gt; /lib/modules/2.4.[lots of numbers]/kernel/drivers/net
&gt;
&gt; ...look for one that has a similar name to the card. Mind you, it's
&gt; probably easier to read the README which will just tell you what the
&gt; name of the driver is.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The driver was written for kernel 2.4.8-16 and I am running 2.4.18-3  it
was
&gt; &gt; the only one that I could find. I imagine that this does matter, but I
dont know to what
&gt; &gt; extent?
&gt;
&gt; These two kernels shouldn't have changed so much they'd upset the
&gt; driver.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a more up to date driver for this modem or any other
&gt; &gt; suggestions?
&gt;
&gt; If you have the source to the driver, you could try rebuilding it on
&gt; your current system; if you don't know how then if you do an "ls" in the
&gt; source directory (it will probably have a Makefile in it or a file call
&gt; configure) and send me the results of that "ls".
&gt;
&gt; [
&gt;
&gt; My hunch would be:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ./configure
&gt; make
&gt; make install
&gt;
&gt; OR
&gt;
&gt; make
&gt; make install
&gt;
&gt; OR
&gt;
&gt; make linux
&gt; make install
&gt;
