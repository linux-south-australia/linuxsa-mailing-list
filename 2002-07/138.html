I dont think it would make much difference. True it'll slow the scan
down, but when its an automated scan nobody is even going to notice, and
the results will still be the same the next day. Or, if its a manual
scan, then I dont see many people aborting it after waiting 30 seconds
too long when they have a multi taking/threading operating system.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; just been bending my brain around this Traffic Control stuff, and i read at
&gt; the bottom of <A HREF="http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:">http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Another way of making use of traffic shaping for security purposes is
&gt; limiting the amount of ICMP-unreachables that a firewall can return within a
&gt; given amount of time. This way, a proper portscan would take much more time
&gt; to do. As long as there is no answer to a portscan packet, the portscanner
&gt; will not know for sure if the port is open or not. Slow scanning is the only
&gt; way to know for sure and when the firewall is protecting a large number of
&gt; hosts; however, slow scanning could take weeks. During that time, the
&gt; portscanner is clearly visible and that's something most portscanners will
&gt; try to avoid. This can be done by defining traffic shape classes for the PPP
&gt; interface, just as we did for the eth0 interface.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What do people thing about this for an idea?  At first glance i would have
&gt; thought that this would slow down legitimate use, but perhaps not?  I havn't
&gt; even thought about any rules in iptables etc but i found it a very
&gt; interesting thought....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway back to banging my head against my Advanced Routing Howto.  Anybody
&gt; can explain to me what the crock half of this stuff means?  :)
&gt; 
&gt; regards
