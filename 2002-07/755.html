&gt; In my original postings I also meant highschools, so obviously &gt; 10 yrs old

Tell me, Damien, how much *real* testing of this kind of thing have
you done? Have you had success after giving Linux to a non-UNIX IT
person in a school and telling them to "build me a workstation"?

I'm telling you now, it doesn't work.

Now, I'm all for UNIX on the desktop, really, I am -- have a look
through the list archives. Unfortunately, Linux itself, as it stands,
is not suitable for the K-12 education market.

Sun've done some interesting work with their SunRay architecture -- at
least (very large) one local school has deployed scores of them, with
success.

However, Linux, a product with no corporate face like Sun to do all
the hard yakka, isn't quite there. It's not the same as giving the
school computer person Windows and Office CDs.

Frankly, I cannot possibly see how you are even remotely qualified to
be making such assertions. As someone who's actually been there, done
that, I can tell you that you're wrong.

The closest thing that we've got to a workable UNIX desktop for
schools currently is Apple's OS X.

Grumble. This thread is boring.
