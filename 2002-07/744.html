My apologies! I completely forgot that you sent the question in the
first place... thought you were just taking the chance to have a go at
someone without offering information, when it was you seeking
information in the first place... my head hurts too much thinking.

&gt; office, web based mail service etc.  I received an email at a client site 
&gt; which had a word document attached.  When I checked the email out at my home 

Did you check whether the attachment was intact when received at the
client site? Could be useful in determining where along the line it got
corrupted.

&gt; office, KDE Mail reported an attachment which I was able to save, but word 
&gt; wouldn't recognise it as a word document, therefore I assume it was corrupted 
&gt; somehow when it came through my server.

Perhaps it is just word being not nice? ;-) I don't really know what I'm
talking about here so all I can do is throw a few suggestions that
probably won't work, but someone else might be able to help more.

Regards,
Daniel Mundy
