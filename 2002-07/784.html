Michael,

&gt; Ok, well I do not think I have been r00ted, and if I have, I didn't
&gt; enjoy  it.

Doesn't hurt to rule out the possibility though.

&gt; For starters I am rarely connected to the internet, just enough to
&gt; download my e-mail each night.  I tried surfing with links and lynx but
&gt;  too many websites hate us text browser users, and the fact that I am
&gt; constantly getting 80% packet loss still.  I really would like to get
&gt; that  solved, I tried pinging the IP address at the other end of the
&gt; ppp link  and got 0% packet loss.  Its got me beat.

Have a look into something called TCP Explicit Congestion Notification
support in the kernel. You want it turned *OFF*. If it is compiled into
the kernel (which it is in one version of RedHat, but I can't recall which
one exactly) there is a line you can add to /etc/sysctl.conf to turn it
off without recompiling the entire kernel.

&gt; As to my config, I have pretty much a bog stock standard RH7.2 laptop
&gt; install and therefore if there are scripts probing for weaknesses they
&gt; would probably find them at my IP when I am connected.  I am pretty
&gt; sure  that I left the firewall setting at the default 'medium' setting
&gt; when I  did the install.  I could not tell you more about the firewall
&gt; settings  unless you instruct me how to log them and send them to the
&gt; list.

[<A HREF="mailto:root@host">root@host</A> root]# iptables -L -nv

&gt; At the moment my priority is learning e-mail and getting it working
&gt; 100%  and knowing WHY it is working =)  All this does not explain the
&gt; quantity  of e-mail being sent by sendmail.  I only discovered the log
&gt; messages when  I ran pine as root by accident really.  I do not really
&gt; know how to  analyse or parse log files etc.  I did 'less
&gt; /var/log/maillog' and got  hundreds of pages of meaningless gibbish.
&gt;
&gt; I am still getting mail errors.  I have inserted one I recieved back
&gt; today.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;    ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
&gt;&gt; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mcampbell@toolah.com">mcampbell@toolah.com</A>&gt;
&gt;&gt;     (reason: 550 5.1.1 User unknown)

Do you have a user (or alias) for <A HREF="mailto:mcampbell@toolah.com">mcampbell@toolah.com</A>? The error message
there would seem pretty obvious to me ;)

Make sure that you don't have the alias for 'root' going to an account
that doesn't exist, as if you do that you could experience the exact same
symptoms that you've described. What will happen is the 'bounce' message
will go to root, which will then be forwarded to a non-existant account,
which will generate a bounce message to root... etc, etc. See where that's
going?

Obviously <A HREF="mailto:mick@toolah.com">mick@toolah.com</A> works, so alias mcampbell and root to mick. Read
the man page for 'aliases'. In short you'd probably want something like
this in /etc/aliases:

root:       mick
mcampbell:  mick

Don't forget to run the command `newaliases` after changing the aliases
file. You don't need to restart sendmail though.

&gt; My last question is to verify if I have been rooted or not.  Can I run
&gt; a  md5 check of /sbin/nologin to see if it has been trojaned?  Can
&gt; someone  give me explict instructions on how to do this please?

Simple, run this command and see if the sum is the same.

[<A HREF="mailto:root@host">root@host</A> root]# md5sum /sbin/nologin
467bb4acc8544eaa18046393e43b3a8f  /sbin/nologin

Hope that helps
Darryl
