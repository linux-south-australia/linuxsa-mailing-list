&gt; I have an AMD Athlon computer running Mandrake 8.2 and currently use a
&gt; Canon BJC-4200 printer connected to the parallel port which is suffering a
&gt; terminal illness (at least, economically speaking).
&gt;
&gt; Would anyone on the list be able to say whether a Canon S200SP or S300
&gt; would be a suitable replacement (both use a USB interface only), or should
&gt; I look at something else.
&gt;
&gt; The overwhelming majority of my printing is black and white text on plain
&gt; A4 paper, with very occasional forays into colour text and line-art
&gt; graphics.

Hi,
I speak from LOTS of printer experience both as a high volume user and a 
copier /printer /fax tech for 20 odd years...get a laser!
If you do the sums, Kyocera Lasers are the cheapest to run at around .7cents a 
page.
They are competively priced, very reliable and mostly come with postscript as 
standard.
They are easy to fix if something goes wrong.
I have not come across one yet that I haven't been able to get working with 
Linux.

If you are looking around, either new and secondhand, here would be my 
choices...all work well, some are more expensive to run than others...

Epson EPL5700,EPL5800 and EPL5900 - are a very good 1200dpi class (good for 
reproduction of photos on newsletters, brochures and flyers etc.) don't get 
an "L" version...i.e EPL5900L, as they are win printers and don't work...

HP Laserjet 4+, 5M (or any Canon EXII Engine Based laser) also very good, 
reliable 12ppm 
600dpi

Canon LBP1260 is ok (EXII Engine) 12ppm 600dpi not as good

I have found Lexmark stuff VERY expensive to run - they charge a fortune for 
the cartridges...

Samsung lasers are good (if you can find them in a shop)
The ML7050 is a beauty...

By the way, I work for a Canon dealer and we won't sell currently available 
Canon laser printers because they suck! (Their support sucks also, but that's 
another story)
www.linuxprinting.org lists the S200 as a Paperweight, and the S300 as 
"Partially" working... this means the more than likely you will be frustrated 
and disappointed with it's performance under Linux...
Be careful with the newer canon ink jets under linux - WOOF!! WOOF!!
they can be a real dog...
The Canon BJC3000 and S400 inkjets are good performers under Linux...
(Cups or Normal printer config. under RH7.X)
The BJC3K is an old model and the S400 you still might find around the place
as a runnout/discontinued...( it does both parrallel and USB )
The most important thing is to do some homework...
Find out the cost of the toner cartridge  ( and drum cartridge if applicable)
and see how many pages it will print for your money - most are rated a 5% or 
6% coverage on an a4 page.
 Multiply it out over the life of the printer...you'll see a vast difference 
between brands and models
Lasers range from .7 to 4 cents a page
Inkjets up to 10 cents a page...
