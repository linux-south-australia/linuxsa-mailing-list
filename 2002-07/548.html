&gt; So what I'm after is turning proxy authentication on in Squid so it logs
&gt; the username it gets from the workstation, is this possible? Or must it
&gt; look of an external list of usernames/passwords??? Or can we turn on
&gt; proxy authentication on and let all usernames in? We have other ACL's in
&gt; place of course.

I'd be installing LDAP on the Novell box (this comes in the box from
5.0 and up). Use pam ldap and Squid's pam auth module to get usernames
and passwords out of NDS. 

You'll need to make a few changes to the pam ldap configuration file
to make it work properly:

* "base should be the dn of the container holding your users. For
  example, "base = ou=users,o=pedarecc".

* "binddn" needs to be a user with decent priviledges. I think a user
  with read access to the entire tree should be sufficient. For
  example, "binddn cn=readall,ou=users,o=pedarecc".

* "bindpw" should be the password for the user specified in binddn.

* "scope" should be set to "sub".

* "pam filter" needs to be set to reflect Novell's weird schema
  conventions. Set to "pam filter objectclass=organizationalPerson".

* "pam login attribute" needs to be set to "cn".

* "pam member attribute" should be set to "groupMembership".

Making those changes, and only those changes, seems to have done the
trick for me in the past. However, I've not had any experience with
the pam ldap module's group support. One of the ways that I thought to
test it was to go the "whole hog" and plug it into NSS to get file
permissions etc. Sadly, FreeBSD's NSS implementation doesn't quite
measure up to that of Linux, so I was unable to test it.

One thought that I did have was that it's [the OS] probably not going
to like group names that contain spaces. I've got no evidence to back
that up, it's just a hunch :-)
