  A few days ago I was looking for a linux equivalent to Treesize 
Professional for Windows, and application that will report how much 
space is being used by various files on the hard disk that it scans.

I ended up figuring out that "du" does the job, but I was still curious 
to look
at jDiskReport because it was advertised as a Linux application at 
www.jGoodies.com .

Initially, I had trouble installing jDiskReport because the instructions 
only mentioned Sun's Java Web Start and JRE2 (Jave Runtime Environment 2).

I finally came to the conclusion that I would have to install both 
applications from Sun to get jDiskReport to run in Linux.

When I was finished setting up jDiskReport, I was very pleased because 
not only did I happen to stumble upon Java Web Start, which turned out 
to be a very user-friendly cross-platform application deployment/launch 
environment, but I found the free jDiskReport application to be of high 
quality.

I was also very pleased to find SecureFTP as I could not use ICEftp or 
GNUftp, and would have to reboot into Windblows 2000. Again, SecureFTP 
was of high quality and worked without a glich. Most importantly, this 
application, as well as jDiskReport were free. However, I would pay for 
these applications and Java Web Start.

Java Web Start is launched from the command prompt, or an icon can be 
created for its use. Upon launch, an attractive message windows appears, 
and soon thereafter, the Java Web Start Application Manager appears. Any 
program that was downloaded with a single click on the mouse can be 
launched from within the Java Web Start Application Manager.

Here are the steps I took to get Java Web Start, jDiskReport and Secure 
FTP to work.

   1. Download and install the Java Run Environment 2 (JRE2) from
      jre-1_4_0_ 01-Linux-i586-rpm.bin into your home directory from
      <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/Download6">http://java.sun.com/Download6</A> .
   2. Go into the shell script and type sh jre-1_4_0_01-Linux-i586-rpm.bin
   3. An RPM file with a similar name will appear in the home directory.
      Click on it to activate Karchive and install the RPM.
   4. Download Java Web Start into your home directory from
      <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/download-linux.html">http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/download-linux.html</A>
   5. Log in as root
   6. Open shell and cd to download directory in home directory.
   7. Type sh install.sh
   8. When asked where JRE2 is, say /USR/JAVA/JR2E1.4.0_01
   9. Go into Netscape and go to jgoodies.com/content/cont1/download.htm
  10. Click on Java Web Start
  11. When asked what to open with, choose advanced.
  12. Select browse and go to your home directory and into the directory
      labeled Javaws, and select javaws. If you are not in Netscape you
      can start from the shell by typing /home/yourhomedirectory/javaw

The rest is pretty self explanitory.

A site to get apps for JRE2:

Hope someone finds this useful,
