&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; just been bending my brain around this Traffic Control stuff, and i read at
&gt; the bottom of <A HREF="http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:">http://online.securityfocus.com/infocus/1285:</A>
&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; Anyway back to banging my head against my Advanced Routing Howto.  Anybody
&gt; can explain to me what the crock half of this stuff means?  :)

I feel your pain.. That stuff took me ages to figure out.

it seems to work well once you've done it though. What in particular did
you want to do? I might be able to help out with some recipes.

(My use was "stop housemates using all the bandwidth" - then telstra
capped us anyway, and the problem became accounting, instead of shaping)


Something that might help you, is to imagine that you've got a cascading
pyramid fountain thing. Like, lots of troughs which overflow into some of
the ones below them. Then imagine that the water for the fountain is
either poured into the top trough, or else you can insert some of it into
other troughs directly. Now expand on the analogy by imagining that the
troughs are different sizes, so some take longer than others to overflow.

Got that? I don't know how much it'll help your understanding of traffic
shaping, but its a pretty soothing mental image, and might help you get to
sleep after fighting 'tc' all day.
