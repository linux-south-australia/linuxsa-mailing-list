David,

I had the same problem as you've experienced when installing NT Server on a
20Gb drive...  The problem it would seem is that the atapi.sys driver on the
NT installation CD's/Disks has an 8Gb limit to it.  This is fixed in SP4 and
later, but that doesn't help you at all when you can't even get Windows
installed!  The workaround is to create a floppy with an updated atapi.sys
driver, and use that during install, the install SP4 or later once
installed.

The MS KB article explaining the problem and workaround is here...

<A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid</A>=kb;EN-US;q197667

Also useful...

Hope that helps.

Jim.

Confound it,

I have a LICENCED version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0, and seeing I
bought a 40Gb drive I decided to install it on my other computer. The
drive is a Western Digital 7200 RPM drive with nothing special about it
but NT only detects it as 8032Mb, says that the maximum NTFS partition
can be 8032Mb and then when I type in 8032Mb it complains the partition
is too large.

I've tried setting the drive to be LBA and NORMAL but neither seem to
fix the problem.

I then gave up and decided to install FreeBSD 4.4RC3 [ I know, I'm
getting 4.6 very soon now ] and it installed without a problem. It
wouldn't boot at first but changing the drive setting to LBA and redoing
the installation fixed that problem.

Just out of interest, is there any reason why NT can only see 8Gb of a
40Gb drive?
