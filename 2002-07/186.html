&gt; You where right about the file system only handling a certain file
&gt; size. It ends at just over 2gb everytime.

As others have pointed out, this isn't necessarily a limitation of
the file system.  I regularly strike gzip/gunzip problems on HP-UX
and Sun boxes with large file system support enabled.  And if
David N. is listening, this is the only time I've ever had to
use the "cat uncompressed.file | gzip &gt; archive.gz" to get it
to work (gzip can't stat the input descriptor correctly if it
comes from a pipe, and hence won't play guess the file size
games and break).

&gt; It's a Redhat 7.3 box with ext3 filesystem. What should I do to fix
&gt; the problem ?

It depends a lot on what you're trying to achieve.  The following
are my random points of view only, and as I know nothing about the
circumstances of your backup, should be taken with a kilo of salt.

Personally, I wouldn't have a large compressed archive sitting
on disk anyway if I could help it.  If you need to restore a
single file/directory from the archive, it's going to take a
fair amount of time to restore a file from the tail end of the
archive.  I would try to break up the archive into reasonable
components (eg, file system based, or probably directory based
if you were dealing with stupendously large files).  Copying
around (or any sort of manipulating of) such large archives on
disk will be a pain in the proverbial.  Restoring such an
archive to/from the same disk will be painful too (this one is
probably less applicable).
