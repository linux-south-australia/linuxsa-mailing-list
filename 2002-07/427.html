SHOULD MY LOVED ONE BE PLACED IN AN ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY? 
For family members, it is often the most difficult and painful decision they 
will face: to accept that a loved one - a parent, a spouse, perhaps a sibling 
- is technologically impaired and should no longer be allowed to live 
independently, or come near a computer or electronic device without direct 
supervision. The time has come to place that loved one into the care of an 
Assisted Computing Facility (ACF). But you have questions. So many questions. 
We at Silicon Pines want to help. 
WHAT EXACTLY IS AN ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY? 
Sometimes referred to as Homes for the Technologically Infirm, Technical 
Invalid Care Centers, or Homes for the Technically Challenged, Assisted 
Computing Facilities (ACFs) are modeled on assisted living facilities, and 
provide a safe, structured residential environment for those unable to handle 
even the most common, everyday multitasks. Most fully accredited ACFs, like 
Silicon Pines, are an oasis of hope and encouragement that allow residents to 
lead productive, technologically relevant lives without the fear and anxiety 
associated with actually having to understand or execute the technologies 
themselves. 
WHO SHOULD BE IN AN ACF? 
Sadly, technology is advancing at such a dramatic rate that many millions, of 
all ages, will never truly be able to understand it, putting an undue burden 
on those friends and family members who must explain it to them. But unless 
the loved one is suffering from a truly debilitating affliction, such as 
Reinstallzheimers, the decision to commit is entirely personal. You must ask 
yourself "How frustrated am I that my parent/sibling/spouse is unable to open 
an email attachment?" "How much of my time should be taken up explaining how 
RAM is different from hard drive memory?" "How many times can I bear to hear 
my father say, Hey, can I replace the motherboard with a fatherboard? Ha ha 
ha! To make things easier, we have prepared a list of Warning Signs that we 
encourage you to return to often, or, if you can't figure out how to bookmark 
it, print out. Also, please take a moment to read I'm Glad I'm in Here! - A 
Resident's Story. 
MUST IT BE FAMILY, OR CAN I PLACE ANYONE IN AN ACF? 
Several corporations have sought permission to have certain employees, or at 
times entire sales departments, committed to ACFs. At present, however, 
individuals can be committed only by direct family or self-internment. The 
reason is simple: there are not nearly enough ACFs in the world to 
accommodate all the technologically challenged. For example there are 
currently only 860,000 beds available in ACFs, but there are 29 million AOL 
users. 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST? 
ACF rents range from free up to $12,500 per month. The disparity is currently 
a point of contention in the ACF industry. Many residents are covered through 
government programs such as Compuaid or Compucare, but reimbursement rates 
are low and only cover a portion of the fees. Exacerbating the situation are 
the HMOs (HelpDesk Maintenance Organizations), which often deny coverage, 
forcing residents to pay out of pocket or turn to expensive private techcare 
insurers such as lueCache/BlueScreen. Offsetting the costs are technology 
companies themselves, many of which subsidize ACFs. Firms such as Microsoft, 
Dell, Qualcomm, and America Online will pay up to 100 percent of a resident's 
monthly bill, but there is a catch. ISPs, for instance, require residents to 
sign service contracts lasting a year or more. Microsoft, meanwhile, 
prohibits the installation of any competitive software, while Priceline 
requires that residents buy shares of its stock, which seems onerous but 
saves residents on lavatory tissue. 
HOW OLD MUST I BE TO HAVE SOMEONE COMMITTED? 
Until very recently, you had to be 18 or older to legally commit a family 
member. However, the now famous British court case Frazier vs. Frazier and 
Frazier has cleared the way for minors to commit their parents. In that case, 
15-year-old Bradley Frazier of Leicester had his 47-year-old parents 
committed to an ACF in Bournemouth after a judge ruled Ian and Janet Frazier 
were a danger to themselves and the community. According to court records, 
Bradley told his parents about the I Love You virus and warned them not to 
click attachments, then the next day his parents received an I Love You email 
and clicked on the attachment because, they explained, It came from someone 
we know. 
WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR IN AN ACF? 
First, make sure it's a genuine Assisted Computing Facility, and not an 
Assisted Living Facility. To tell the difference, observe the residents. If 
they look rather old and tend to openly discuss bowel movements, this is 
probably 'assisted living.' On the other hand, if they vary in age and say 
things like, I'm supposed to figure that out? I'm not Bill Gates you know!, 
this is probably assisted computing. Also, at a well-run ACF, residents 
should lead full, independent lives, and should be allowed the use of many 
technology devices, including telephones, electric toothbrushes, and alarm 
clocks. However, only a facility's Licensed Techcare Professionals (LTPs) 
should perform computational or technological tasks such as installing 
programs or saving email attachments. And LTPs should NEVER answer residents' 
questions because studies have shown that answering user questions inevitably 
makes things worse. Instead, residents should simply have things done for 
them, relieving them of the pressure to "learn" or "improve". 
CAN A RESIDENT EVER GET OUT? 
No. 
OK, THIS SOUNDS PROMISING. HOW CAN I LEARN MORE? 
For your enlightenment, we offer extensive information on Silicon Pines and 
the ACF lifestyle, which can be found by clicking one of the links in the 
navigation bars found at both the top and bottom of this page. But whatever 
you decide, keep in mind that due to demand, ACFs now have long waiting 
lists. WebTV & AOL users alone will take years to absorb.
