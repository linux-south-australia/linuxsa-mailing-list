Hi SDUKAS,

Well, now is as good as ever a time for me to update my progress.

But first, but first, here is the callbacks.c file you asked for.

Second, a caveat, I made the post specifically for Netware 4, so I would 
be very happy to know that it is of help to Netware 5 users. Could you 
write back and let me know what the additional  procedures you had to 
take, if any, to get it working?

Also please note that you should modify your /etc/nwserv.conf file to 
prevent denial of service, please see my last post on computing.net.


********************ANOTHER GUI FRONT-END OPTION**********************

My update is about an additional option for logging into the netware server.

Attached are some shell scripts that do the same thing as GTK, and is 
faster and easier to set up. It does not require compilation or that you 
use a novell login password for it to work, as does GTKNW. This does not 
mean that the Novell login password can be circumvented, it just means 
that if you don't use a Novell login password, you can still use the 
script to log into the Netware server. This is not true of GTKNW as far 
as I know.

Note that the scripts are just a GUI front end, you still have to set up 
all of the background tweaks as described in the post. To be clear, it 
just replaces GTK as a means to log into the netware server.

The bottom line is that you have a choice of Netware clients. If you use 
the shell scripts, you do not need the callbacks.c file.

The attachment labeled "Netware Client for Linux" is just an icon.  If 
you want the netware client to automatically start when KDE loads up, 
place the icon in /home/linux-local-username/.kde/Autostart. (the /.kde 
folder is hidden, so you can go to view/show hidden files in konqueror 
so it will show up.)

If you would rather not autostart the client, just place the icon on the 
desktop and edit it by right clicking ang going to properties. Click on 
the execute tab and change the 'username' part in the 'command:' box to 
the local-user's user name. For example, mine reads
sh /home/james/novell.sh. A user will log into the server by clicking on it.

This icon calls up the shell script I made, which is attached next. It 
is called novell.sh
Note that this file must also be edited.  Store the shell script in the 
local Linux user's home directory. Right click on the shell script and 
open with kwrite or some other type of editor.

Basically the script automates the ncpmount command.  It won't work the 
way it is now, you have to edit it. Note that if you do not use a 
password,  keep the -n in the script and delete the "-P PASSWORD" part. 
Replace the word "SERVERNAME" with the name of your server, and 
"USERNAME" with your Novell login name. Note that the Novell login name 
could differ from your local Linux user name.

I have also made a 'my computer' icon which is just a folder on the 
desktop with an icon associated with it. Inside of it, place the 
'F:\SERVER\VOLUME' attachment and rename it by right clicking on it. 
Also click on the URL tab and remane the mounted path.

Once the netware volume is mounted, simply click on this icon and you 
can access files easily without having to cd to the mounted volume.

&gt;Hi, my name is Stavros Dukas 
&gt;I'm an MIS assistant at law firm in NYC. I am working on a project to
&gt;see whether it is possible to switch our Windows workstations to Linux
&gt;workstations. We are running Novell 5 as our main server so of course
&gt;looking for a good clone of the Novell client that would allow the
&gt;employees to have a smoother transition into the Linux environment. I
&gt;saw your post about the GTKNW client on the computing,net forum and want
&gt;to try it out. So if you still have that modified callbacks.c file I
&gt;would really appreciate it if you could send it to me. Also if you know
&gt;of any other possibilities in mind that could be of any help it would
&gt;also be appreciated. Thank you in advance.
