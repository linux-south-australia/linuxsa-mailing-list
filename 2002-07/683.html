&gt; &gt; experience for poorer schools because it can be run on throw away
&gt; &gt; hardware.
&gt;
&gt; Ah, but what exactly are you trying to do with Linux? GUI / Usability fluff
&gt; requires nice hardware. KDE and Gnome aren't exactly fast. Mozilla and
&gt; OpenOffice are dog-slow compared to their Microsoft (IE, Office)
&gt; counterparts.

well, I mean throw away boxes, connected up to a beast of a server :) Works 
out pretty damn cheap.

&gt; Yes. We're talking about kids: people with very short attention spans and
&gt; with less intellect than most adults. The ideal situation is that a button
&gt; which does something in one place should do /exactly the same thing/ when
&gt; found in another place. People remember process before they remember
&gt; meaning: they'll remember that to save a file they'll need to click "File",
&gt; then "Save", not that "File" is a logical place to put the "Save" function.
&gt; That sort of understanding comes later.

Do you have any actual examples where non-conformity would be confusing? Sure 
GIMP looks a bit different, but kids play with stuff til it works. They click 
stuff until stuff happens, and they gradually get the hang of what to click. 
And if they have to think a bit more, isn't that a good thing? Shouldn't we 
encourage them to think more? Not just turn out another M$ drone, then when 
they're too old to bother learning anymore they'll just stick with what they 
know, kids are curious and it's an advantage.

Adults have generally carved out who they think they are, what their 
limitations are, their comfort zone. They are often unwilling to venture out 
of it. It's not that they _couldn't_ understand something, but they've 
already pre-programmed their minds to not understand it. I see kids as a 
clean slate ready to be influenced in a positive way, but I see schools 
largely failing them.

&gt; It only seems consistent to us because we're used to it. I remember it
&gt; making no damn sense whatsoever 5 years or so (or was it 4?) ago. (/usr?
&gt; /usr/local? What the hell? Why are configuration files in /etc, and not
&gt; something sensible like /conf?)

So what? The system is taken care of by the schools administrator. I think 
windows' file layout is rubbish, there are text and binary log files 
scattered all over the place, what does what? And they have a really bad log 
syntax, I've tried findign stuff and i have no idea what I'm doing. Windows 
is OK for doing basic things, but if u wanna do something complex outside of 
what it allows u, then ure stuffed. It took me ages to realise "documents and 
settings" was just /home (and it's not encouraged to be used anyway).

&gt; &gt; The command line thing is rubbish, my first computer was a C64, I wrote
&gt; &gt; basic programs more than 100 lines long when i was 8 or 9. My first x86
&gt; &gt; PC had DOS on it, and I rejected win95 because Dos + Norton Commander was
&gt; &gt; WAY faster for doing stuff. GUI isn't everything, kids aren't scared of
&gt; &gt; technology like adults are, they'll _try_ to break it :).
&gt;
&gt; Good work. It's taken my younger sister (15, at the time) over a year to
&gt; work out how to move, delete, and create files in a directory-based
&gt; filesystem. I don't want to think about having to teach her how to move
&gt; files that she can't "see".

she's 15, she's too far gone :) I'm talking about 10 and under, i've seen 15 
yr olds struggle as well, it doesn't surprise me.

&gt; Some people just "get" computers. They know why things happen. Most people
&gt; don't. They remember process. In the end, they shouldn't need to know
&gt; the 'why'. It's not their job: it's ours.

I think we're still talking about older people here. Kids have a much more 
open mind and are not held back by what society has drummed into them (yet). 
They don't go "I'm not a computer person, therefore I don't know how to do 
this and will require help from someone who is a computer person.". 

I think the way schools teach is flawed anyway. My niece came home one day 
reciting her times tables, 3x1=3, 3x2=6,3x3=9, she would say over and over. 
So i asked her "If I had 3, multiplied by x, and it gave me 6, what would x 
be?". I even prompted her saying "well 3x1 is 3, so it's not 1, 3x2 is 6, oh 
so x must be 2". But it didn't click at all. She was being taught to recite 
some meaningless crap, but not being taught what it actually meant.

&gt; Personally, I'm not an advocate of dumbed down interfaces, because they
&gt; make my job hell. Quite often, it's a case of poor targeting: Microsoft
&gt; seems to assume that nobody using the computer actually knows what they're
&gt; doing, including the administrators. This is why I use Linux and FreeBSD: I
&gt; know what I'm doing, and if I don't, I have enough background to understand
&gt; the accompanying manuals. I've set up a development environment which works
&gt; extremely well for me, because I know how to, and the OS is complex and
&gt; configurable enough to allow for it. I can call up the appropriate log
&gt; files when something goes wrong. If all else fails, I can read the source
&gt; code. I don't have to play hit-and-miss with problems, because can
&gt; understand what is going on.

No argument there, dumbed down Microsoft interfaces are churning out less 
skilled computer users, not more.

&gt; Most users don't have nearly enough technical background to know
&gt; what "Permission denied" really means, or how the UNIX permissions system
&gt; works. Some don't even know what "Disk full" means. Under Windows and
&gt; MacOS, a reboot/reinstall will fix most operating system problems. Under
&gt; Linux, they'll need to possibly compile the kernel with a new driver, work
&gt; around an RPM dependency problem (grr!), change permissions on files,
&gt; remove their broken window manager configuration, etc.

Don't need to in a school, sysadmin takes care of it.

&gt; Linux works for me, as a developer and an administrator, because most
&gt; programs are developed by people who assume that I know what I'm doing.
&gt; Windows or MacOS works for everybody else, because it's developed by people
&gt; who assume that their users aren't paid to bitshift 8 hours a day.

They assume their users are "mentally challenged". Which annoys the crap out 
of me. If I click on Program Files, I don't want the damn thing to say how 
important these files are, i just wanna see em. If they were important you 
would've made it easier for me to run as a user not as administrator all the 
time.

Damien.
