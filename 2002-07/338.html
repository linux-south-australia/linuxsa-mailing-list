&gt; While I don't agree entirely with everything this guy has to say, he
&gt; does raise some valid points which need to be addressed before Linux
&gt; has a genuine chance of toppling Windows from the desktop, corporate,
&gt; home or otherwise. (The first step IMHO is to move away from MS Office
&gt; to remove the #1 reason to stay with Windows, but I digress)  
&gt; 
&gt; There's no way that I'm switching back to Windows at home for anything 
&gt; other than ripping DVDs and gaming, but I don't class myself as a joe 
&gt; average user and I don't mind the odd bit of tweaking to make things work 
&gt; just the way I like it.

"I once heard a song by Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie called Every OS Sucks,
where Linux users were described as 'elitist nerdy shmucks'. Sadly this is true
for much of the 'community'. Too many consider themselves better than the rest
of the world because they run Linux. Can you believe that? It's just a computer
operating system, but somehow they think that it makes them better than those
people who run systems such as Microsoft Windows! Elitism drives people away,
as does saying RTFM or belittling people who choose a different distro from
yourself."


Methinks someone has a bit of a chip on their shoulder :-)
