&gt; If they both do the same thing, the user won't care. So put a link to
&gt; mozilla on the desktop with an IE like icon, and set diald or something
&gt; up.

The user does care.  That's the problem.  If it doesn't look EXACTLY The
same then they refuse to use it.  They claim it's too difficult to use. 
They claim they can't use feature X (when feature X is actually in a
more relevant location in the menu system), because they can't see it in
the menus.  People are simple and lazy.  They don't think.  They just
want to do what they've been shown to write a letter or surf the web. 
That little paperclip must be common among the simple masses - "You're
writing a letter, would you like me to a. bollocks it up for you b. fsck
off c. crash your computer".

&gt; MYOB runs under wine. Chat progs are available.
&gt; GUIs can be setup to behave however you want, like windows, or for the more
&gt; adventurous - in a useful configuration :)

Wine still crashes too much - I wouldn't trust it to run MYOB, because
the people who run MYOB generally keep all kinds of really important
data in it.  VMWare is a good start, but it still needs the M$ tax :-( 
If VMWare could work without a kernel patch it'd be excellent.

&gt; Open Office, faster to load docs than Word.

Open Office loads faster than word.  What you have to take into account
is that when Windows boots it actually preloads IE, word and excel (and
their associated DLLs) into memory.  It appears they're loading faster,
when simply a small amount has to be swapped back into memory.  Why do
you think the boot time for windows goes from a few seconds to well over
a minute immediately after office is installed?  It's M$'s way of
looking superior to the competition.  It's cheating, I know, but it
still looks better to those who don't have a clue/dont' care.

&gt; DRM is a joke and even if the US decide to cripple their IT industry, I
&gt; doubt
&gt; the rest of the world will blindly follow. (EU at least, if not we lemmings
&gt; in aus).

We are Lemmings in AU.  The ozzie government is so conformist to the US
that it's not funny. DRM is becoming LAW in the US.  If it's not opposed
and thrown out then it will be a requirement.  That's not a good thing! 
It's a breach of privacy.  Say I download some "educational" material. 
My Fritz (I always knew there was a reason I didn't eat that saussage
stuff) goes and talks to whoever owns it, tells them lots about me then
gets a license to play it.  Now they know all about what I like to
watch, and can a. use it against me if they feel like it   b. send me
more crap and advertising that targets my specific "interest".

&gt; The gap is closing, and microsoft need to concentrate on their deficient
&gt; areas
&gt; according to bill (security etc.). There are plenty of areas - on the
&gt; desktop -
&gt; where Linux is already superior (IMHO).

The gap is not closing.  Geeks are moving away from Windows because they
can.  Hackers because it's a better programming environment, and
crackers (prolly only script kiddies) because they can get root access
on it and do some nasty network things to better enable them to break
through whatever security we put in place.

Joe Schmoe doesn't care.  He doesn't even care about security. He
doesn't have the first clue about getting cracked, or spyware or
anything.  He installs (has someone else install for him) Windows and
Office.  He downloads Kazaa and Audio Galaxy so he can get free music. 
They install spyware.  He uses internet explorer and it sends all his
personal information to whatever site requests it.  And all the time he
is ignorant to what's going on.  He bitches about privacy and all that,
but doesn't know that because he's using Windows he has almost none!

Ignorance is bliss my friends!

Cheers,
Adam
