I really love reading messages like this, especially when they're nestled in
against other threads that are bagging windows for being arcane,
non-intuitive, cryptic, and difficult to troubleshoot...

&lt;ducks for cover&gt;

Subject: Live, via web cam - watch me scramble my kernel module!


  Tonight, I was trying to get my web camera working.

Why do I want to use a web Camera you ask? Well, because it is there, I
guess.   :-)

I had an IBM Net Camera Pro that I was able to get the green light to
turn on, but only a black screen out of xawtv with the c-xirlink driver.
I read another page that says that the particular model I have just
doesn't work.  I remeber doing some kind of mknod thing to get it to
give me a green light.

Ok, so I went off to Fry's to get another camera, this time with a print
out of some pages with web camera information, etc.

After looking over the list of cameras that should work in Linux as well
as the prices, I decided to buy a Labtech Webcam listed as compatable at
<A HREF="http://qce-ga.sourceforce.net">http://qce-ga.sourceforce.net</A> .

I downloaded the driver from the page and unzipped it, did the make
thing, and got this error:

"memory.c in function uvirt_to_kva
 memory.c:45 warning:implicit declaration in function kmap_pagetable"

I didn't notice the error at first and continued to run the script that
came with the driver.

Here is what I got:

Using /lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/video/videodev.o
insmod: a module named videodev already exists
Using /lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/usb/usbcore.o
insmod: a module named usbcore already exists
Using /lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/usb/usb-uhci.o
insmod: a module named usb-uhci already exists
Using /lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/usb/usb-ohci.o
/lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/usb/usb-ohci.o: init_module: No
such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters,
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
Using /lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/usb/uhci.o
/lib/modules/2.4.18-4GB/kernel/drivers/usb/uhci.o: init_module: No such
device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters,
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters.

Well, the hint didn't give me a clue, so it seemed that perhaps Linux
thought that the IBM Camera was still installed, blocking the new Labtec
camera's installation.

So,  I did a dumb thing and deleted the usbcore.o, videodev.o,
usb-uhci.o and usb-ohci.o files. I thought that if I recompiled the
driver I downloaded from sourceforge the files would come back. Needless
to say no luck down that path, so I copied all of these files back from
another machine with SuSE on it, minus the videodev.o, as it was not on
the other machine.

I searched around the internet,  and FTP'd a videodev.o file, but I got
another error saying that the videodev.o file was compiled with the
2.4.18-4GB kernel, not the 2.4.18 kernel. I already did a search on my
SuSE disks for videodev.o, but no luck.

Ok, so I went into the kernel and compiled video4linux support into the
kernel - I said "Y" instead of "M" - which I think changes the
video4linux support from a module (.o file?) to inside the kernel. I
chose this route because the instructions said that I could use 'ismod
mod_quickcam.o' to get the Labtec Camera to run instead of the script if
video4linux support was compilied into the kernel.

bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt! Wrong answer....

When I ran 'ismod mod_quickcam.o' I got this message.

"mod_quickcam.o: unresolved symbol kmap_pagetable"

I tried "modprobe quickcam.o" within the directory that the module was
compiled but I get a message that says, "can't find module quickcam.o -
YOU NEWBIE!!". Well, almost... :-)

I searched around and I found what looks like an answer. Only thing, I
have no idea what it means, so I don't really know if I have an answer
at all. My gut tells me that I need a symbolic link somewhere.

Here it is:

Any ideas?
