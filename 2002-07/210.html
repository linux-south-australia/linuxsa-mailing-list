&gt; &gt; Well, I meant compatibility between the distros, and specifically, the
&gt; &gt; certification of that compatibility -- they want to assure ISVs will

&gt; &gt; will be certified as compatible with any of the members... Presently,
&gt; &gt; ISVs would have to certify (or test or whatever) against each distro
&gt; &gt; separately.
&gt; 
&gt; I have problems with this.. what they are basically saying is "we're
&gt; the distro that does everything the *right* way, and by certifying your
&gt; software with us, you are certifying it with every other decent distro,
&gt; because they should be like us".

uh... no they're not. They're saying "We're a bunch of prominent
distros, and you can certify against us all at once". Of course, they
would say that they are the best distro(s), and that they all do
things the right way, and that other distros get something wrong, but
everyone says that. I assme you would prefer it if they said either
"We're kind of like other distros, but different, so by certifying
your software against us, you won't be certifying it with other quite
decent distros, but it would be nice if you'd certify anyway" or
"We're the best distro(s), so if you certify against us, we'll certify
you against every other distro -- particularly RedHat, because they
rock." ???

&gt; Since when is it acceptable for a company to decide that *it* is the
&gt; standard??

The Market decides that... And the Marketing department talk them into
it.
