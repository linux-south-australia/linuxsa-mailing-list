My thoughts are that the best option is having separate systems for on
and offsite backup...

You can reasonably easily use cp -al and rsync and a few scripts that
have been previously discussed to keep multiple online copies of your
data on a live filesystem, and then keep tapes for real backups...

The basic idea is:

/data # all your data

/backup # the backup tree
/backup/&lt;datestamp&gt; #the daily/fortnightly etc backups.

set up /backup/&lt;today&gt; by doing a cp -a on /data

on a daily basis, run:

cp -al /backup/&lt;yesterday&gt; /backup/&lt;today&gt;

and then 

rsync /data /backup/&lt;today&gt;

This will keep daily online backups, with all inodes correct etc, and
permissions, etc as well... It will not waste too much space, as the
cp -al uses hardlinks for files, and rsync only creates new files when
data is changed, so there will only be one copy of each unchanged
file. Obviously, this doesn't work for large files with small changes
(eg databases), but for most user stuff, is fine...

export /backup as read-only to users, and then it's reasonably easy
for them to get their old files without having write access and
breaking their own backups.

Regularly rm -rf old backup directories, keeping only what you want --
eg archived monthlies for a year, weeklies for three months, and
dailies for a month...

This is easy to do overnight, and as it's all disk-based, the backup
window will be less of a problem than with tape.

Of course, you will still want off-site backups, but as these are for
archival and disaster recovery only, and not regular file retrival,
you don't need to worry too much about how convenient the access is.
And, as you can back up from the backup directory on disk, you don't
need to worry about speed... You also may decide that you don't need
to worry about keeping archives, in which case, you only need keep a
few rotations of tapes (or whatever)...

Another possiblity, if you have fast, cheap networking, is to partner
with a similar organisation, and use rsync over a network to do
offsite backups for each other...
