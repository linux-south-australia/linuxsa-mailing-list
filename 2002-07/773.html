&gt; I think DDG is correct in saying that MC has been "rooted."  I am as 
&gt; well versed at these things as DDG, so I just have a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; I am curious:  What are chances of a laptop being rooted?  When I think 
&gt; of laptops, I envision a part time computer, vs a server that is 
&gt; continuously used. I am prejudiced to think that it is a less likely target.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anyway he could use the information on his machine to catch the 
&gt; SOB that is doing this?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, just so I can get a feel for what the dangers are: how often 
&gt; did he use his computer, did he use a local ip number, or did he have a 
&gt; firewall?
&gt;

Ok, well I do not think I have been r00ted, and if I have, I didn't enjoy 
it.

For starters I am rarely connected to the internet, just enough to 
download my e-mail each night.  I tried surfing with links and lynx but 
too many websites hate us text browser users, and the fact that I am 
constantly getting 80% packet loss still.  I really would like to get that 
solved, I tried pinging the IP address at the other end of the ppp link 
and got 0% packet loss.  Its got me beat.

As to my config, I have pretty much a bog stock standard RH7.2 laptop 
install and therefore if there are scripts probing for weaknesses they 
would probably find them at my IP when I am connected.  I am pretty sure 
that I left the firewall setting at the default 'medium' setting when I 
did the install.  I could not tell you more about the firewall settings 
unless you instruct me how to log them and send them to the list.


At the moment my priority is learning e-mail and getting it working 100% 
and knowing WHY it is working =)  All this does not explain the quantity 
of e-mail being sent by sendmail.  I only discovered the log messages when 
I ran pine as root by accident really.  I do not really know how to 
analyse or parse log files etc.  I did 'less /var/log/maillog' and got 
hundreds of pages of meaningless gibbish.

I am still getting mail errors.  I have inserted one I recieved back 
today.

&gt; Subject: Re: Question
&gt; 
&gt; This is another bloody test!  I seem to have my e-mail configured 
&gt; correctly as 90% of people are getting them and the mailing lists are 
&gt; getting them but I am still uncertain that I have it set up right.
&gt; 
&gt; I am getting e-mail through my mail server at my domain www.toolah.com by 
&gt; Whizhost.com.  I am sending mail through my roommates ISP account with 
&gt; ozE-mail (smtp.ozemail.com.au).
&gt; 
&gt; Hope you get this.
&gt; 
&gt; Mick
&gt; 


My last question is to verify if I have been rooted or not.  Can I run a 
md5 check of /sbin/nologin to see if it has been trojaned?  Can someone 
give me explict instructions on how to do this please?
