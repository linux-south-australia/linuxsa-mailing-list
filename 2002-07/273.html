Daryl,

&gt; But there is a difference between using and abusing, which is why I
&gt; asked do you specifically need transaction semantics when importing
&gt; data.  You shouldn't be performing what's basically a data import
&gt; inside a transaction (but then see the caveat below).

I used a script that is endorsed by the Postgres developers because I
thought they might be able to get the dump into a better format than me.
Given my problems actually getting Postgres even talking to me, I didn't
expect to fall over this problem.

&gt; &gt; 1) Importing the data into MySQL didn't cause my disk to thrash (it's
&gt; &gt; not the quietest disk and I can hear it when it's going)
&gt; &gt; 2) Importing the data into Postgres caused my disk to really go wild
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately (and this is what I was alluding to with the "batch of
&gt; inserts"), Postgres commits every insert that occurs outside of a
&gt; "begin; ...; commit;" pair. 

So I found out.

&gt; One way[1] to get around it is to batch
&gt; the transactions - 100 or so inserts inside a transaction.  Another
&gt; way is to switch off fast sync on the postmaster/backends (a flag
&gt; on the more recent versions), but you'd want to make damn sure you
&gt; didn't care about losing your data (or have an appropriate UPS
&gt; backing it up).  There was a third method I used to use, but my
&gt; ailing brain has failed (fled?) me.

Oh confound...

&gt; &gt; Do you have leprosy?
&gt; 
&gt; No, that's my natural skin colour.

LOL

&gt; [1]  Most of this is based on 6.5.3 - I've used 7.1.3, but
&gt; not to that deep a level.  And I've never managed to get
&gt; myself successfully signed onto the postgres mailing lists.

hmmm...
