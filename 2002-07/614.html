No-one ever said it was going to be easy :) There seems to be another person 
every week saying that Linux on the desktop is dead, yet the apps and 
improvements keep coming regardless. Also the profile of Linux is getting 
better, it is being taken seriously in mission critical environments. Sure 
it's being perceived as a cheap backroom server that'll just keep running, 
but before that it was perceived only as a toy. 

People keep predicting Linux will fail here, there and everywhere, yet they 
keep getting proven wrong. Where there is a will there is a way, and there is 
a *lot* of will out there. 

I think the key to getting Linux on desktops and in peoples minds, is schools. 
Kids will want to have what they use at school, and they get to take a copy 
home, legally. According to the K12 project, setting up a terminal server 
classroom with a beasty application server and some recycled machines turned 
into thin clients, reduces the cost of the _hardware_ by half. Then comes the 
fact u can stick a copy of redhat on the server for nothing, or if u want 
support for that server, buy a single copy. 

Typical high school applications are certainly plentiful (word processing 
etc), and of course it's a fantastic environment for computer programming (we 
learnt toolbook and logowriter at my school, um.. yay, how about some C?? or 
some scripting languages, or Java, ie something useful). I'm not too sure 
about educational programs for little kids though, but the various Linux for 
schools projects are working on that, and the new addition in KDE3 includes 
some educational programs - although rather boring, but that can be fixed.

Also, Tux is cute. Linux is fun, it can appeal to kids. It's a stable, easily 
administrated server. Beige windows environments are BORING! Where are the 
negatives here people? Linux in schools is cheaper, centrally administered, 
easy to update with no downtime (except in kernel upgrade, but why do that if 
the current kernel works?), linux can be fun and cute, it sends a good 
message about sharing and choice and to not just follow your corporate 
masters blindly, provides a better learning environment  - kids will be more 
competent with computers, etc etc.

I'm not giving up on linux until Microsofts marketshare has dwindled 
significantly (and i'm talking like 50% or more). I know things will keep 
improving, regardless of what the naysayers(?) say.

Damien.

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Not too mention the linux apps are appearing. These days there are
&gt;  &gt; numerous browsers that are pretty good,
&gt;
&gt; All of which take longer to load than IE, none of which work as well (in
&gt; terms of web site compatibility - Standards are a different matter and the
&gt; average desktop user doesn't care.)
&gt;
&gt; Excuse me while I play devil's advocate.
&gt;
&gt; Joe Schmoe knows that if he hits the Big Blue E, and clicks "Connect" he
&gt; can surf the web.  The majority of Internet users (the ones that ring
&gt; support anyway) don't understand the distinction between a network
&gt; connection to the internet, and the software that makes use of that
&gt; connection.  They don't know that Internet Explorer is a browser, they
&gt; think Internet Explorer is just how the Internet works.  In that respect I
&gt; don't think three sluggish browsers with funny names is much of an
&gt; advantage.
&gt;
&gt; Joe Schmoe's employer isn't likely to switch to a Linux desktop because Joe
&gt; Schmoe has been surfing the web and chatting to his mates on MSN after work
&gt; every night and is thus already competent in using a Windows GUI.  Besides
&gt; which, he runs MYOB.
&gt;
&gt; Joe Schmoe's son has heard of Linux before, but all the computers at his
&gt; school run complimentary Microsoft software, all his IT assignments have to
&gt; be handed up in DOC format, etc., etc., etc.....
&gt;
&gt; How can Linux possibly hope to combat something with so many fingers in
&gt; such hefty pies?
&gt;
&gt; Besides which, what happens when your desktop must be DRM compliant? 
&gt; Surely open-source is a circumvention device in itself?  Perhaps there are
&gt; ways around the problem, but while the open source communities scramble,
&gt; Windows will dominate in countless other ways.
