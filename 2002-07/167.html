&gt; &gt; I am looking at making a small database (Access typr of thing) using
&gt; &gt; Glade, but I'm having probs linking a table.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't quite follow what you're trying to do but, from what I've seen
&gt; of Glade it simply creates the GUI widgets for you, makes the code to
&gt; create the Gnome/Gtk+ Window, place menus and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt; It doesn't seem to:
&gt; 
&gt; * be component based like Borland's Builder, Delphi or Kylix (or VB)

Actually, I just had a look and while I don't use it there is now
support for GnomeDB, and this includes some very nice componants.

Like...
Database Login Widget, DSN Configurator, Database Browser, etc.

Hmmmm, maybe I should have a look at this.
I probably could have saved myself a lot of time d;-D

&gt; I reckon you're actually asking something to the effect of "Why can't
&gt; I see a Glade component that has a property that links automatically
&gt; to[My|Postgre]SQL"; I *suppose* you could write one but I would
&gt; suggest:
&gt; 
&gt; * investigating Kylix
&gt; * seeing whether you can use a Web Server, CGI/PHP and HTML forms

See above, then see... 
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-db/">http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-db/</A>

&gt; If you wanted to display say a table created with:
&gt; 
&gt; create table foo (
&gt; 	id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
&gt; 	firstname varchar(25));
&gt; 
&gt; A possible sequence of events would be:

 
&gt; 1) Create the Gnome Application Window

Add some widgets for the data to appear in. 
eg CLists or Text/Entry widgets.

&gt; 2) On "Creation Event" populate the widgets "ID" and "FIRSTNAME" from
&gt; the database

ID and FIRSTNAME being GtkEntry widgets, a CList with two columns gets a
little more exciting d;-)

click on the widgets, add an "on_realize" event.
in the callback for said event (eg on_FIRSTNAME_realize in
callbacks.c)...

&gt;  - substeps would be connect to DB, get the first values, check for
&gt; errors

etc... 

&gt; 3) On "next record", "previous record", "first record" events [created
&gt; by pressing buttons] do the appropriate action


But, GnomeDB will probably be a lot easier with it's DatabaseBrowser
widget.
