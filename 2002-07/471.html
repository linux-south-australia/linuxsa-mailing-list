&gt; I guess the thing to remember about this list is that there is a great amount
&gt; of expertise available in this list on many computing areas..tis natural that
&gt; we turn to that when stumped:)

I wasn't stumped; I had already identified that the operating system
itself was to blame...

&gt; also, one of the things i cherish most about linux is the fact that users are
&gt; a community - and like any community, we have our small disagreements....;))

Huh? We don't have disagreements -- everyone except me is wrong ;-P

LMAO

&gt; but it means that we are available for each other - to help out.......

Too true.

&gt; we have no formal agreement (afaik!) to list things as OT or HUMOR or any of
&gt; the others we have started to adopt - like all communities, we are evolving
&gt; to meet needs - much like linux itself really (and unlike the monolith that
&gt; is M$ - yes, i never miss an anti M$ opportunity!;) )

We're self-regulating on the whole, although every now and then I wake
up and wonder whether Hyde had gotten to the keyboard (eeck)...
