Hi Robyn,


Our project is just starting and we are throwing around ideas,
brainstorming, etc.

But I can tell you what, I would bet that there are some core & common
principles of taxation shared between between Australia and the U.S. -
and to me all that means is that the programming code can be shared in
some way. Maybe its total interest or total wages, capital gains or self
employemnt income. (I don't know what to call them, libraries?)  The
program is being written in Perl, I hope that it would be useable by
all.

Since we have 50 states plus a federal government to produce forms for
here in the U.S., I am sure that one of them has parts of it that looks
kinds like one of the forms in Australia...

I hope - although I am not runnig the project, that we will have
different people all over the place sharing and maintaining pieces of
unique taxation all over the place, including Australia.

As I understand it Perl can run in Windows, and I would be more than
happy to talk with him about the types of calculations that can be
shared in the program.


One last thing. I am not a programmer myself. Some other guys are
working on it, I am going to do mey best to make sure the calculations
comes out right.


In the mean time and in the next few weeks, I am hopefully going to get
to a point that I have made "SSGTBASOTAWNWGB" (Simple Sambas Guide) as
good as I can get it.

Best and thank you,


James Leone

 &gt; Hi
 &gt;
 &gt; Can your tax program run on Windows and will it work with Australian tax
 &gt; rules?
 &gt;
 &gt; I can ask my tax accountant friend if you need help with the Aussie
 &gt; stuff.

 &gt; &gt; After some expirimentation, I got Lotus Organizer 6 to work in Linux,
 &gt; &gt; using Codeweavers cross over office 1.1.  Internet Explorer and Office
 &gt; &gt; was already installed, and I instaled organizer from within the
 &gt; &gt; "Organize" directory, selecting "Install.exe". If you select setup from
 &gt; &gt; /, it will fail.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; When I installed I selected the program file only.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; I will give more details later, now I am off to bed.

 &gt; &gt; P.S. I am starting help a few Perl programmers that are working on the
 &gt; &gt; tenfourty program, which will help USIANS pay their personal income 
tax.
 &gt; &gt; The project is just opening up, and I am the bridge between the
 &gt; &gt; programmers and the tax law... Before I get into that too deep, I hope
 &gt; &gt; to add some more  information to the Samba beginner's guide soon...
