&gt; There are still a lot of older servers out there where emacs will take ten

As I demonstrated in another mail, this isn't the case.

These days, a P233 is give-away material.

emacs has grown an awful lot less than computer speed/size in the last
five years. Five years ago, emacs on 'vintage' hardware would suck.
Today, emacs on 'vintage' hardware is fine.

&gt; Also when you're dealing with a machine on a laggy and/or loaded link, vi
&gt; is better because of the way it works. I can do things using less
&gt; keystrokes, and I can determine exactly where I'll be in several seconds
&gt; time and work ahead of the lag. I'll submit to saying that you could
&gt; probably do something similar with EMACS if you knew how, but even so you
&gt; have to admit its graphically more intensive in text mode.

Why do I have to admit this? I'd imagine the difference would be
negligible, given enough terminal smarts. Which all terminals have these
days.

Apart from two lines (menu bar and the status bar), it's just text.

The menu bar and the status bar change rarely enough that the
said terminal smarts will not need to 'visit' them for changes very
often.

&gt; &gt; I don't have vim on this box. The cost of the evil automatic DOS &lt;-&gt;
&gt; &gt; Unix translation is worth throwing away that free entry ticket :-)
&gt;
&gt; Well, it is just an option. Turn it off if you don't like it. And if you
&gt; take your .vimrc with you to new shells, then you'll never be bothered
&gt; again.

Ahh but when I use dozens of different machines, many of which I may not
even have a home directory on to call mine, I like the default behaviour
to be predictable and sensible.

That said, I don't use emacs on remote machines. I use vi for almost all
system maintainance tasks.

I use emacs when I'm going to be playing with a file for more than a few
seconds. IE coding.

I have nothing against vi at all, I use it a lot.  I think it's powerful
and fast. It's always there, it works consistently.

My only beef is about the whole 'emacs is bloatware' argument. Used to
be true, isn't any more.

<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/bloatware.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/bloatware.html</A> :

  bloatware n.

  [common] Software that provides minimal functionality while requiring
  a disproportionate amount of diskspace and memory. Especially used for
  application and OS upgrades. This term is very common in the
  Windows/NT world. So is its cause.

P.S. Geoffrey - you started this :-)
