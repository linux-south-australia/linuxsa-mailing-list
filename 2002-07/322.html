Hi Toby

&gt; It's nasty, but the error you've got looks a bit like there's a
hardware
&gt; problem with the new harddrive.

It does, doesn't it?  What worries me is the first hard disk
that failed was under two years old, and the replacement one
was new.  I am wondering if perhaps there is a problem with
the power or cabling that is causing some damage to the disk.

&gt; Anecdotal knowledge suggests that most new harddrives have a few bad
&gt; sectors, but they get mapped out on the first error and don't show up
&gt; again. Thus, I usually run a once-over on all new harddrives I get
before
&gt; using them.
&gt;
&gt; For you, I'd suggest running something like
&gt; dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
&gt; on your harddrive. (from a bootCD or something)
&gt; That's totally destructive though, be warned.

Naturally!

As there are people on my back to get the server back up,
I've performed a e2fsck -c on each partition on the disk
the errors referred to and have enabled an option to the
aic7xxx driver I just discovered (panic_on_abort and
verbose).

&gt; After doing that, power the PC off, wait, then power back up and
restore
&gt; from your last backup.
&gt;
&gt; If you're still getting bad read errors on sectors after that, it's
&gt; warranty time for the harddrive.

Or the controller... :-/

I went and did some more thoro web searching last night,
and there were definately many different causes and
solutions suggested (naturally none were definitive)
including each of SCSI disk, SCSI controller, and driver,
but Red Hat's Bugzilla shows a significant number of people
with other similar problems with the aic7xxx driver, so I
think my next step might be to find the very latest
Adaptec driver and use that.  Two disks on the same channel
seems too coincidental for it to just be a random hard disk
error.

Thanks for your advice
