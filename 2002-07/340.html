I agree.  I'm not using Linux at home much (dual boot) cos i've got XP and
it just works.  sure you can crash it occasionally, but i don't have to/want
to stuff around for 19 hours getting my video capture card going etc etc
(unlike Petefree who likes using computer after hours &lt;dig&gt;).    i do
enought mucking around getting things going on linux at work.  but once you
get it going, it sits there and hums along.  we like it for servers, but for
desktops?  not by a long shot.

I agree with the community spirit too.  I got a few RTFM manauls a few times
so i got the hint.  goto google.com and learn to skim read  :)  then try to
post intelligent questions to mailing lists.

winblows is a crock, but for Ma and Pa Kettle, it works.

&gt; While I don't agree entirely with everything this guy has to say, he
&gt; does raise some valid points which need to be addressed before Linux
&gt; has a genuine chance of toppling Windows from the desktop, corporate,
&gt; home or otherwise. (The first step IMHO is to move away from MS Office
&gt; to remove the #1 reason to stay with Windows, but I digress)
&gt;
&gt; There's no way that I'm switching back to Windows at home for anything
&gt; other than ripping DVDs and gaming, but I don't class myself as a joe
&gt; average user and I don't mind the odd bit of tweaking to make things work
&gt; just the way I like it.

"I once heard a song by Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie called Every OS Sucks,
where Linux users were described as 'elitist nerdy shmucks'. Sadly this is
true
for much of the 'community'. Too many consider themselves better than the
rest
of the world because they run Linux. Can you believe that? It's just a
computer
operating system, but somehow they think that it makes them better than
those
people who run systems such as Microsoft Windows! Elitism drives people
away,
as does saying RTFM or belittling people who choose a different distro from
yourself."


Methinks someone has a bit of a chip on their shoulder :-)
