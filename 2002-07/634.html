&gt; Um, what is wrong with CDE?? I have never tried it myself... but I found
&gt; XFCE the other week which is supposed to be almost a copy, and I loved
&gt; it (until I found FluxBox the other day...). It's just a window manager
&gt; -- find the little terminal icon at the bottom left and there's access
&gt; to all your programs, hard to learn to use?? As long as you know the
&gt; basics of Linux *all* windowmanagers are easy -- some just piss you off
&gt; more than others.

that's the problem.  People don't want to use the terminal - it's "DOS"
remember.  DOS died with Windows 95, so it must be outdated.  Therefore,
Unix is outdated because it still needs DOS.

We forget that most of these people are simple in their nature (and
computer needs).  Force Linux on them and they'll use it. Give them a
choice and they'll choose Windows every time because it's "modern".  It
has a pretty interface and it's just there - they don't have to think.

Cheers,
Adam
