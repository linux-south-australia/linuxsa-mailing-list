Looks like this could be a very strong use of the open source 
community's resources, especially the ones that don't know how to code. 
LIKE ME. :-)

Anyway, here's my same-old same-old -&gt; the same could be done to pump 
some $ into other open source projects, to reward the current volunteers 
and recruit future talent. The funds could then be used to increase the 
number of and speed of open source/free software development and at the 
same time, keep them GPL.

&gt;Subject: free Blender fund
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear Blender user,
&gt;
&gt;Finally some good news. It looks like Blender will get a new future. 
&gt;I've managed to make a deal with the investors in NaN, to agree on a 
&gt;plan to make Blender become an open source project, published as GNU 
&gt;GPL. This will be organized by an independent non-profit organisation, 
&gt;the 'Blender Foundation'.
&gt;
&gt;You can read about this at the Blender site:
&gt;
&gt;  <A HREF="http://www.blender3d.com">http://www.blender3d.com</A>
&gt;
&gt;Before you go there... there's one 'but' involved. The Foundation will 
&gt;have to pay 100k euro (or USD) to NaN in order to make it happen. That 
&gt;money will be collected with a campaign during the next month. I 
&gt;honestly expect we can find big sponsors to help us out, but I'm afraid 
&gt;it also comes down to you, as the individual Blender user.
&gt;
&gt;I hope you consider making a donation; you can become Foundation Member 
&gt;for 50 euro (or USD), which will also give you some nice extras during 
&gt;the campaign.
&gt;
&gt;Let's make Blender Free Software forever!
&gt;
&gt;-Ton Roosendaal-
&gt;Blender Foundation
