There are a couple of companys working on wine. Codeweavers have been
putting a lot of time in to it.

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/support_wine.php&gt">http://www.codeweavers.com/products/office/support_wine.php&gt</A>;

transgamaing have as well, although they recently forked from the
original wine project, which I dont think was a good thing.

&gt; data in it.  VMWare is a good start, but it still needs the M$ tax :-( 
&gt; If VMWare could work without a kernel patch it'd be excellent.

But it does. It only has a network driver kernel module, but that doesnt
require a kernel module to install and is only required for networking
support. It seems to compile and install really easily. I just gave up
on it because of the ram requirements and speed hit.
