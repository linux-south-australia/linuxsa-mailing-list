&gt;  - Your taskbar stays consisent throughout desktops, so if you click on
&gt; a task from another desktop, it appears on your current one.  Then when
&gt; you go back to the other desktop, it's disappeared because its now on
&gt; the wrong desktop.

That's the default option for KDE.  Ok, so it moves you to the right
desktop if you click an option, but you can change it to bring windows
to the current desktop.

&gt;  - If you disable above said feature, you can't move a window from one
&gt; desktop to another.

There must be some way!

&gt;  - You can't cycle desktops.  You have to keep going WIN+1, WIN+2, WIN+3
&gt; etc to go through the desktops.

Depends what window manager you use on X.  Some can cycle desktops.  I
don't think KDE can - you have a number of keys, and you select a
desktop in a similar way.


&gt;  - There's no "Send to Desktop" function.

A very useful option - present in everything I've seen.  Is there a
sticky option?

&gt;  - You can't drag between desktop screens.

I don't think you can do this under a lot of Un*x window managers
either.
 
&gt;  - If you load an application that will take a few seconds to load and
&gt; switch desktops before it has appeared, it will launch in the desktop
&gt; you switched to, not the desktop it was launched from.

Depends on a. the application and b. the window manager under X.  Some
apps display on the desktop where you started them, and some come up on
the desktop you're at.  You have to keep in mind that the window manager
doesn't know about the app until it opens a window.

&gt;  - It's really slow.

Buy a new dual processor ultraFAST (TM) machine; then it will cease
being slow.

I'm not disagreeing with you (I think M$ "solutions" tend to be crappy
compared to what they copied to come up with the solution), but you have
to be a bit more specific when you make the comparison - there are a
multitude of window managers and desktop environments for X.  Some are
very similar to the MS one.  KDE does a lot of stuff exactly the same by
default now.  Admittedly, there are options in KDE, but you must expect
that the average desktop user doesn't care - they never change the
options anyway.

Oh well.

Cheers,
Adam
