&gt; It's possible that someone could write a "Desktop Linux" module and
&gt; integrate it into a TAFE but only if one could convince the TAFE that
&gt; the course would be actually useful in the real world. But "Desktop
&gt; Linux" doesn't exist in a great majority of work places so there's a
&gt; chicken and egg problem...

Yes Linux is going to be in the real world didn't we have a post
just a week or two ago that Employment National, or was it
CentreLink are moving to a Linux environment. Secondly the way MS
charges per seat hurts budgets and more and more organisations
will be looking for alternative cheaper software. Also MS's
constant changes reduce office productivity another reason to get
out from under.

Rather than write a Desktop Linux module for integration into a
TAFE course, why not write it & have it taught at WEA, they're
always looking for new courses.
I would do a Linux desktop course at WEA for two reasons
1) cheaper than TAFE
2) I'd like to use Linux and Open Office, but I don't have the
confidence to alter what I've got until I know where I'm going.
