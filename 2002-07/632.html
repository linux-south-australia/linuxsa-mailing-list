David,

&gt; &gt; I do remember a bunch of friends in Sydney and Melbourne mentioning
&gt; &gt; how they were learning the basics of Redhat at TAFE, and how boring
&gt; &gt; it was, heh(although interestingly a lot are now running it in
&gt; &gt; firewall/server situations, but not desktop).  I can't say I know
&gt; &gt; anybody who goes to Adelaide, but it is possible that they perhaps
&gt; &gt; haven't "caught up" yet.
&gt; 
&gt; It would be useful to have such feedback (if you could actually
&gt; convince them to talk to you about it) and actually determine what
&gt; they thought was boring. Was it the actual content, the way it was
&gt; being taught? It would be useful because it is very possible that I
&gt; may have a vested interest in making sure that the TAFE courses are
&gt; not boring.

I was at Panorama TAFE (about 2 years ago now) and they taught intro to
operating systems on RedHat 5.(something). Although I was up to speed on
what they were teaching (file permissions, using Vi (good to see they
arent teaching Emacs :P ), installing etc), I found the course to still
be informative. For some of the Windows-centric people in the class,
they could have done some clarification on the more in depth basics like
how X windows relates to Linux, versus how the Windows GUI related to
the base OS. As an example, one of the students yelled out "i crashed
linux, i crashed linux", it took 10 minutes to explain the difference
between windows and linux, and that it was X windows not linux that died
:). However, i guess it was not directly related to the course topic,
being how the operating system works, cpu management, memory management,
file management etc rather than a linux class.

My $0.02

Cheers

James
