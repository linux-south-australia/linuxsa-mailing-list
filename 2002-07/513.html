&gt; Once a system is devised for a particular use, and is focussed on it,

The reasons are bug fixes and hardware support.

Take the recent ext3 disk corruption bug or the older ext2 disk
corruption bug in Linux 2.2.  You do need to upgrade, as the
resulting downtime from encountering the bug would be massive.

&gt; I wouldn't expose such a system to the internet (or perhaps any
&gt; network) would I?

The exposure or otherwise to the Internet isn't relevant.

I am one of those insane people working on engineering the Internet
to carry life critical traffic.  And that means helping develop a
suitable operating system for lightweight network infrastructure
tasks.

&gt; What is it about linux uptimes that needs improving? Some of our systems
&gt; run for well over a year at a time, and usually the only reason they get a
&gt; bounce is hardware failure, extended power failure or location change. Our
&gt; Win 2k servers start to get flakey and suffer performance degredation
&gt; after a couple of months - some admins are recomending monthly bounces for
&gt; all Win2k systems.

I don't understand why you want to compare Linux with Windows.  I'm
much more interested in growing Linux to be suitable for what I want
to use it for -- network infrastructure.  If I were to make comparisons
it would be with Tandem Non-stop UNIX, QNX and MVS.

&gt; As an aside, 5 minutes is a long time for a reboot cycle, we typically
&gt; have network back up and running under 2 minutes, 90 seconds is typical on
&gt; our pentium systems. (watching the gap on a ping session)

Five minutes would be an outside figure, excluding fsck (and
the interesting question of often you should run that on a
system).

&gt; Perhaps I'm missing the point about safety-of-life systems. Can you quote
&gt; an example?

DNS resolution for the URL voice://emergency.au springs to mind.
Web servers containing emergency medical procedures.
E-mail between on-road ambulance officers and at-base doctors.

It's easy enough to say "don't do these", but the last two actually
happen now, on infrastructure that isn't up to the task.
