Well there's the third, unmentioned location of linux on the desktop, 
which is upon die-hards' PCs ;)

Also, I believe that very large organisations with limited numbers of app 
requirements may realise the savings to be made from using Linux instead 
of Microsoft Windows + Apps.

If a single Linux OS + required apps can be imaged and rolled out en 
masse for a given purpose, you could get away with lower hardware costs, 
avoidance of expensive yearly per-seat licenses, etc..

First example that comes to mind would be call centres. If you could have 
a setup involving one custom app with everything else driven via a 
web-browser, then Linux would be a certain winner.

&gt; LaM: Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; R: Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that resembles what
&gt; you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The market is not driven by
&gt; a technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its crashes a few times
&gt; a day. Users don't (mostly) care. They just reboot and get on with it. They
&gt; want apps. If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose.
&gt; Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to
&gt; nice areas (video production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core
&gt; now will probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to
&gt; see Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
&gt; well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the apps
&gt; are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This is where
&gt; the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.
&gt; 
&gt; LaM: Where do you think the future ought to lie for desktop Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; R: There is none. The future for Linux for anything that isn't a headless
&gt; server in a back room tirelessly serving out data and services all day long
&gt; is on the device market, from PDA to phone to watch.

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.
