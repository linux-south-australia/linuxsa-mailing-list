&gt; I read the book last night, and I came away with the impression that the

&gt; 
&gt; 1. The blackhat scans your system for a "vulnerability"
&gt; 2. ' ' gains root by exploiting the "vulnerability" with an exploit script
&gt; 3. ' ' telnets to the server and uses accounts created by the exploit script
&gt; 4. ' ' checks to see who is on
&gt; 5. ' ' edits the log files
&gt; 6. ' ' replaces system binaries with trojans
&gt; 7. ' ' downloads rootkit and installs it

I'd call them "Script kiddies", not blackhats.

People using pre-packaged scanners and exploits are known as "Script
kiddies". Blackhats are people creating their own exploits (or getting
hold of other "underground" exploits), and keeping their existence quiet
so the bugs don't get fixed!

&gt; 
&gt; Seems with all of the "vulnerabilities" out there, and how often scans 
&gt; occur, it is a wonder that most Linux boxen aren't "rooted."

Well, 
a) If its just some guys 56k dialup, why bother?
   Boxes on adsl or cable are much more attractive, but are there's less 
of them, and people who get broadband internet are usually either more 
clueful or else have more money than the average punter (and thus they are 
running recent hardware and recent MS O/S, which aren't as insecure as 
you'd think these days.)

b) Even with all the vulnerabilities out there, an old box with a decent 
firewall is still secure.. I mean, say you're running vulnerable versions 
of nfs, lpd, xfs, ftpd, and telnet, BUT you have a firewall which blocks 
just about everything except letting certain outbound traffic through. 
(probably via NAT). You'll be fine.


&gt; 1. I thought that if you have local IP numbers set up i.e. 192.168.x.x 
&gt; or 10.1.X.X behind a router with a masquerraded local IP number, that 
&gt; this kind of thing couldn't happen. Am I incorrect?

Hmm.... Yes, it can still happen. Either
a) by compromising the router or gateway
or
b) carefully forged packets, combined with your badly setup or 
non-existent firewall.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. If the use of local IP numbers have little or no effect on intrusion 
&gt; deterance, are there any other methodologies that can keep an intruder 
&gt; from reaching the vulnerable computer?

Fight them every stage of the way.
In order of effect:

Setup your firewall correctly.
Make sure you are running the minimum of services on your box.
Have secure operating practices.
Use PAM, tcpwrappers, etc. well.
Keep on top of patches.
