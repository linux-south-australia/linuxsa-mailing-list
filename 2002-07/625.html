Excuse me while I respond :)

&gt; All of which take longer to load than IE, none of which work as well 
&gt; (in terms of web site compatibility - Standards are a different matter
&gt; and the average desktop user doesn't care.)

We don't need to convince the users though - we need to convince web
designers (and /or M$) to follow the standards. M$ is getting nearer to
the standards - they just throw in some non standard crap to piss people
like me off and to keep netscape/mozilla at bay. This is similar to what
they tried to do to Java, maybe a similar court case might fix the problem.
(I'll stop dreaming now :) )

&gt; Excuse me while I play devil's advocate. 
&gt;
&gt; Joe Schmoe knows that if he hits the Big Blue E, and clicks "Connect"
&gt; he can surf the web.  The majority of Internet users (the ones that
&gt; ring support anyway) don't understand the distinction between a network
&gt; connection to the internet, and the software that makes use of that
&gt; connection.  They don't know that Internet Explorer is a browser, they
&gt; think Internet Explorer is just how the Internet works.  In that respect
&gt; I don't think three sluggish browsers with funny names is much of an
&gt; advantage.

If they both do the same thing, the user won't care. So put a link to
mozilla on the desktop with an IE like icon, and set diald or something
up.

&gt; Joe Schmoe's employer isn't likely to switch to a Linux desktop because
&gt; Joe Schmoe has been surfing the web and chatting to his mates on MSN
&gt; after work every night and is thus already competent in using a Windows
&gt; GUI.  Besides which, he runs MYOB.

MYOB runs under wine. Chat progs are available.
GUIs can be setup to behave however you want, like windows, or for the more
adventurous - in a useful configuration :)

&gt; Joe Schmoe's son has heard of Linux before, but all the computers at his
&gt; school run complimentary Microsoft software, all his IT assignments have
&gt; to be handed up in DOC format, etc., etc., etc.....

Open Office, faster to load docs than Word.

&gt; How can Linux possibly hope to combat something with so many fingers in
&gt; such hefty pies? 

Seems to be doing ok so far. You haven't mentioned the main area it is still
struggling badly in - DirectX games. OpenGL can be ported easiliy (if
written
correctly) or run under wine, but directX is the killer ATM.

&gt; Besides which, what happens when your desktop must be DRM compliant?

DRM is a joke and even if the US decide to cripple their IT industry, I
doubt
the rest of the world will blindly follow. (EU at least, if not we lemmings
in aus).

&gt; Surely open-source is a circumvention device in itself?  Perhaps there are
&gt; ways around the problem, but while the open source communities scramble,
&gt; Windows will dominate in countless other ways.

The gap is closing, and microsoft need to concentrate on their deficient
areas
according to bill (security etc.). There are plenty of areas - on the
desktop -
where Linux is already superior (IMHO).

&gt; Jordan.

Barney.
