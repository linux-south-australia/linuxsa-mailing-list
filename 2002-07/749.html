&gt; Is this implying that you're saving the attachment under Unix, then
&gt; transferring it to Windows somehow?

(ie. dos2unix/^M problems)
also check the attachment just isn't being encoded "weird"
I've had some people email me stuff (from an M$ machine) and
evolution mail handles it all automatically but sometimes
evolution claims not to recognise the attachment as being
eg. a word doc.  It happens a lot from my brother and it
appears to be M$ at his end doing some weird encoding on it
(ms-tnef pops into my head at this point but I'm not sure
that's related).  My point is: save the attachment and check
it out thoroughly to see if it's just weird encoding rather
than real corruption.
