&gt; &gt; GIMP is the Photoshop of tools.  I haven't used it for anythign more
&gt; 
&gt; Ive done quite a bit of graphic work under windows in the past, and I
&gt; find gimp really annoying, just because I am incapable of using it.

I would emphasise that it's because you are not used to using it.

 
&gt; I think it needs more intuative interface. Although those who can use it
&gt; probably dont think so.

I find Photoshop's interface irritating and I can almost never quite
work out what I want to do. This is because I'm used to using The GIMP
and how it thinks.

&gt; Its an excellent program that can do way more
&gt; than they have to but even selecting an area and doing a cut and past
&gt; wasnt too obvious last time I looked

The only thing that is not altogether too obvius is that unlike
Photoshop, The GIMP doesn't use an MDI style interface so you have
separate windows all over the place. These windows don't have menus, but
if you're used to X then you'd probably work out that the right mouse
button brought the menus up quite easily. And if you don't understand
what "edit-&gt;select all" and "edit-&gt;paste" does, well, what can I say
without displaying my infamous sarcasm?

Adobe's Photoshop has been a de facto program for the work it does and a
lot of people are used to it. The GIMP does not use the same "thought
process" as Photoshop and hence for a lot of people it seems to be "more
difficult" and "less intuitive" to use. But that's only because they're
used to Photoshop -- not because The Gimp is inherently
"non-intuitive"...

BTW, I can use Photoshop, it just takes me a while to work out where
things are. The basics between Photoshop and The GIMP are really
similar. For example, their concept of "layers" is essentially the same
but the place where you can change, alter, merge or wotever with the
layers is different and the dialogs don't look the same.

I feel special now ;-)
