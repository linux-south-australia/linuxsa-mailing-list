Not too mention the linux apps are appearing. These days there are
numerous browsers that are pretty good, evolution for mail (with
commercial, but cheaper than M$ exchange server plug in), nice desktops,
the blender3d thread below, star office with official support from sun,
vmware and crossover office if you really need it, etc etc. The apps
will keep filtering in, and the more there are the more of a more viable
alternative it becomes.

&gt; Well there's the third, unmentioned location of linux on the desktop, 
&gt; which is upon die-hards' PCs ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I believe that very large organisations with limited numbers of app 
&gt; requirements may realise the savings to be made from using Linux instead 
&gt; of Microsoft Windows + Apps.
&gt; 
&gt; If a single Linux OS + required apps can be imaged and rolled out en 
&gt; masse for a given purpose, you could get away with lower hardware costs, 
&gt; avoidance of expensive yearly per-seat licenses, etc..
&gt; 
&gt; First example that comes to mind would be call centres. If you could have 
&gt; a setup involving one custom app with everything else driven via a 
&gt; web-browser, then Linux would be a certain winner.

&gt; &gt; LaM: Where do you think the future lies for desktop Linux?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; R: Not on the desktop. Not on the PC. Not on anything that resembles what
&gt; &gt; you call the desktop. Windows has won. Face it. The market is not driven by
&gt; &gt; a technically superior kernel, or an OS that avoids its crashes a few times
&gt; &gt; a day. Users don't (mostly) care. They just reboot and get on with it. They
&gt; &gt; want apps. If the apps they want and like aren't there, it's a lose-lose.
&gt; &gt; Windows has the apps. Linux does not. Its life on the desktop is limited to
&gt; &gt; nice areas (video production, though Mac is very strong and with a UNIX core
&gt; &gt; now will probably end up ruling the roost). The only place you are likely to
&gt; &gt; see Linux is the embedded space. Purpose-built devices to do a few things
&gt; &gt; well. There is no encumbent app space to catch up with as a lot of the apps
&gt; &gt; are custom written. It's still a mostly level playing field. This is where
&gt; &gt; the strengths of Linux can help make it shine.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; LaM: Where do you think the future ought to lie for desktop Linux?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; R: There is none. The future for Linux for anything that isn't a headless
&gt; &gt; server in a back room tirelessly serving out data and services all day long
&gt; &gt; is on the device market, from PDA to phone to watch.
