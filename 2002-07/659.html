&gt; [ Not picking out Damien's posting in particular, more flaming
&gt;   the entire thread :-) ] 

Ok, you're on!

&gt;
&gt; Yeah right, lets force an inferior product on the school kids
&gt; because we can.  Whoo hoo, that will win Open Source Religion
&gt; converts.  After all everyone that's been to a Catholic school
&gt; has gotten religion and joined the Jesuits :-)


Windows is the operating system equivalent of:

A Yugo with its outsides rebuilt to look like a Lamborghini Countash.

Linux is the equivalent of a Lamborghini Countash without its exterior on.

&gt;
&gt; I don't know if you've been on the blackboard side of a classroom,
&gt; but coherency and consitency is really important when you are
&gt; trying to teach.  A lot of subject design uses the coherency of
&gt; the subject to teach the basics, and then something more
&gt; complicated, and then something really interesting.


If I said that I 'found Linux educational,' it would be a rediculous 
understatement.

&gt;
&gt; Linux's user interface sucks.  You're going to burn classroom
&gt; hours and kid's energy explaining why OpenOffice doesn't work
&gt; the same as Mozilla, which doesn't work the same as GNOME/KDE.
&gt; And then there's the command-line intruding upon everything,
&gt; itself massively complex and contradictory.  And you're not
&gt; trying to teach kids how to navigate a nightmare user interface:
&gt; you're trying to help them learn digital photography, or english,
&gt; or design.


It is quicker to type in shell commands to burn a cdrom rather than 
using a GUI.  

To be educated, a student must be taught how a computer works. So, I 
will also argue that it is much more educational to teach the student to 
burn a cdrom by using the shell, than it would be to merely "point and 
click"  which seems to teach the student that the world is already made, 
and he need not strive to make it a better place.

&gt;
&gt; It's not as bad as the traditional UNIX interface.  But still far
&gt; too bad to pretend that there's a coherency of design and a
&gt; consitency of use.
&gt;
&gt; At the moment Linux is the third-best desktop operating system.
&gt; I see no reason why kids should be forced to use third-rate tools
&gt; to meet some ideology. 


The point is teaching, not attrativeness. That's why we don't let kids 
eat dessert lest they finished their supper.

Third rate as in, can't be compiled to run optimally on a particular 
machine, or read various file systems perhaps? Sounds like the Windows 
Kernel to me.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Why don't you go away and make Linux a first-rate user experience.
&gt;
&gt; Once you've done that you won't need to talk to schools about
&gt; adopting it.  Schools *want* an alternative to Mac and Windows.
&gt; It's the Open Source/Free Software community which is letting them
&gt; down


The open source community has done a quite fantastic job, thank you very 
much!

Has open source let me down? Hmmmmm. Lets, see, here on my desktop, 
hmmm, I have a free typesetting program called LyX that produces 
documents that everyone thinks was professionally typeset....(What did I 
save there, a few hundred...?)  I didn't have to pay for a server 
operating system at all...(THANKS TO SAMBA)... I can make an image file 
of my Windows 2000 partition and then delete the partition for "splits 
and giggles" and then restore it from the image file without a hitch. By 
the way, all the programs will remain preinstalled in  Windows but the 
restoration will only take about 30 minutes unattended, instead of 6 to 
8 hours attended.......(Thanks To Partimage - That's a good $1,000 in 
savings as I didn't have to buy ghost)...Using Linux, I don't have to 
reinstall Windows evey few months because of its horrible security and 
viruses,  not to mention the lack of disk defragmentation....I have to 
defrag at each and every install....I could go on.

Well, I guess the answer is NO, open source has not let me down. Quite 
the contrary in fact. 

&gt;
&gt; There have been decades of negotiation about consitent user interfaces
&gt; for the UNIX system and then the GNU/Linux system and it's still a mess.
&gt; That says a hell of a lot about its developer's attitudes to users 
&gt; outside
&gt; of the Slashdot cult.


An abundance of choice can be messy for some people.

&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Glen
&gt;
&gt; BTW, OpenOffice is slow because it is running over Wind/U,
&gt; a API that lets programs run above Window or UNIX without
&gt; rewriting.  This is a neat trick, but it makes OpenOffice
&gt; an amazing time and resoruce hog.  It's only the lack of
&gt; a viable alternative which makes OpenOffice at all
&gt; attractive.
&gt;
&gt; Windows doesn't pre-load the Office DLLs as far as I can see
&gt; on a just-booted XP system.  You can configure Office to load
&gt; a toolbar which is launched on startup, but equally you can
&gt; turn that off.
