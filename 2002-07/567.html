&gt; &gt; Na, we'll be more generous than that - if this list can agree on a design
&gt; &gt; they want we'll buy the heat press and charge only $8 to press the design
&gt; &gt; onto the shirt of your choice

It will take years for us to agree on a design, and then we'll have a
war about whether it's a GPL'ed or BSD style licenced design...

&gt; (ie, you supply the shirt).  The only size
&gt; &gt; restriction then is the A4 transfer which cost about $5 per pop (bad pun).
&gt; &gt; Therefore we'd have the heat press paid for in only 1000 t-shirts!
&gt; &gt; (allowing for toner).  Surely there's enough of us out there for a 1000
&gt; &gt; t-shirts? (hahahaha)

Watch out here, David Newall had some InstallFest T-Shirts made up which
he can't GIVE AWAY...I think it would be better to convince a company to
actually sponsor the T-Shirts to pay for the press because I can't
seriously see us selling 1000 T-Shirts in a hurry.

[sorry for that drop into reality]

&gt; not only would I want a couple adult ones, but i'd dearly love some kid size
&gt; ones too:)) maybe we need a baby tux design!

Adult ones would be nice, but I'm afraid I'd take a S or even XS (extra
small)...it's a total pain being the largest kids size or smallest adult
size but not really either size (so my trousers are either too tight but
the right length or just right tightness but too long :-( )

&gt; after all, tshirts, like ties, are good advertising......

True.
