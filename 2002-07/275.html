Well, endorsed doesn't necessarily mean it will work 100%.  If you
break it, you still get to keep both halves.

&gt; Oh confound...

Databases still aren't perfect abstractions - at my last contract,
developers were constantly banging into "limitations" of Oracle
because they basically didn't know any better.  What's a rollback
segment, and why are we blowing it?  Who cares, we'll do a massive
data load within a transaction anyway, and then watch Oracle spend
8 hours rolling it back out when it's shutdown for a nightly backup.
And for a grand finale, we'll do a dataload with the indexes on.
That'll learn 'em.

&gt;&gt; [1]  Most of this is based on 6.5.3 - I've used 7.1.3, but
&gt;&gt; not to that deep a level.  And I've never managed to get
&gt;&gt; myself successfully signed onto the postgres mailing lists.

&gt; hmmm...

I get immersed in what I need to get the job done, and then have
to move on.  Sometimes I play developer, sometimes system
administrator, sometimes bit herder.  Currently, I'm strong on
HP-UX, but that'll fade as my Python and Java hat becomes more
accustomed to my head for my clients current requirements. I
don't have to dive into 7.1's system tables like I used to do
with 6.5.
