Andrew,

Uh Oh, netmasks!

it is useful to understand CIDR as specified in RFC1518
<A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc1518.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc1518.html</A>
but for local stuff the following works for me

Rule one - think binary

Rule two - netmasks may not have embedded 0's
ie x.x.x.193 (x.x.x.1100001) is not allowed

Rule three - the number of zeroes determine the network number
ie this must match the boundary created by the mask

Rule four - you lose two addresses, first is the network number
last is the broadcast address of the subnet

Easy Huh

If you want 16 (less two) hosts your netmask is 240 (11110000)
the last four zeroes give you 16 (binary) possibilities
x.x.x.240 is your network number
x.x.x.241 is host 1
--
x.x.x.254 is host 14
x.x.x.255 is you broadcast address of the subnet

so your address in this case will be between x.x.x.241 and x.x.x.254
with a mask of x.x.x.240

but your address may start on any boundary that 256 is divisable by (in 
this case 16)
x.x.x.0
x.x.x.16
--
x.x.x.144
--
x.x.x.192

in other words, any number is valid as long as it has the same or 
greater number of trailing zeroes when expressed in binary

so in your case you have a netmask of x.x.x.192 giving you
62 hosts (rule 4) and a network number of x.x.x.192 but yor network
can have other numbers (Rule 3) ie

x.x.x.0
x.x.x.64
x.x.x.128
x.x.x.192

CIDR is much easier to work out (x.x.x.192/26) once you get the hang of it

The frightening thing is that I can do this stuff in my head :)
HTH

Cheers

Luke

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I have a rather annoying problem with a dual boot
&gt; desktop at present. It works fine with the Redmond Product,
&gt; but when I boot Linux (Suse 7.2 Pro) I discovered I couldn't
&gt; surf with Netscape. On further investigation (I initially
&gt; thought it was a DNS problem), I came across the following
&gt; error msg in the boot log:
&gt; 
&gt; Setting up network device eth0
&gt; doneSetting up IPv6 network interface (no address)done
&gt; Setting up routing (using /etc/route.conf)
&gt; Error while excuting:
&gt;     /sbin/route add -net 203.XX.YYY.193 netmask 255.255.0.0
&gt; gw 203.XX.YYY.193 dev eth0
&gt;     route: netmask doesn't match route address
&gt; 
&gt; Setting up routingfailed
&gt; 
&gt;     Now I know that the Netmask here is wrong (everything
&gt; else uses 255.255.255.192), but it occurred to me that if it
&gt; was something different I don't have a clue how to calculate
&gt; a Netmask anyhow, and after a bit of a search I couldn't
&gt; find anything on the Net about how to either. Further to
&gt; this problem, the 255.255.255.192 works on all the M$ boxes
&gt; and my Server, but when I tried to manually run the command
&gt; as root on the Linux Desktop with what I thought to be the
&gt; correct Netmask, I got the same error. Now I have had a
&gt; routing problem before that was solved when someone kindly
&gt; calculated the Netmask for me (ie 255.255.255.192), but to
&gt; be honest I just took their word for it because it worked.
&gt; Can someone help me out here and show me and everybody else
&gt; here who might have run into this problem - How do you
&gt; calculate a Netmask? Any suggestions as to why the route
&gt; command doesn't work for other resons would also be
&gt; appreciated.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
