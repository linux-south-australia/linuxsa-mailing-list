I have to agree,
    I set my parents up recently as users on their system using Mandrake 8.2

Set kppp so that it opens kmail and when kmail closes it opens a browser.
Removed some of the extra's ie 1 editor not 6 , development tools etc...

They're wrapped with it, the last system they used was a win95 system 
which was always crashing.

This they can leave on, ie log out not shut down
Browse the net easily
Get and send email
Play their cd's and dvd's

Perfect for their current needs

dcd
ps. They are recommending it to friends who have constant problems with 
their winblows systems.

&gt;Hi There,
&gt;    Before you make such a rash decision, I would ask a
&gt;couple of questions first -
&gt;
&gt;    a)    Have they used Windows, MacOS or Linux before?
&gt;    b)    What are they going to do with it?
&gt;
&gt;    The reason I would ask the first question is that if
&gt;they have never used any system before, then the learning
&gt;curve for the system will be just as steep whichever one you
&gt;use from a users perspective. I would also point out a USERS
&gt;perspective, because I assume that you are going to set it
&gt;up for them, and also if it does "break" then you will be
&gt;fixing it. I also assume that you will probably end up
&gt;installing any new software on it, so it will probably end
&gt;up as some kind of administered system anyhow.
&gt;
&gt;    This leads on to the next question of what will they do
&gt;with it? Looking at some of the user ready out of the box
&gt;systems like Suse, which comes with a reasonable desktop
&gt;setup and Star Office and Netscape, I would feel quite
&gt;comfortable in offering this to a beginner as long as they
&gt;were only a user, and not trying to administer the system as
&gt;well.
&gt;
&gt;    Providing that all they want to do is surf, read news
&gt;and/or mail, write letters and maybe balance the cheque
&gt;book, there is no real reason why you couldn't just use
&gt;Linux. Distributions like Suse now set up most basic or old
&gt;systems straight out of the box, and with Linux, it is hard
&gt;for a User to break it. Suse also provides about everything
&gt;a basic user needs out of the box. Why go for an "exotic"
&gt;fix when all you need is a good sturdy solution that is hard
&gt;for a beginner to break. If they want to go beyond basic
&gt;use, tell them that they are using cutting edge technology
&gt;and they will probably get a real kick out of it. Hope this
&gt;has helped.
&gt;    Cheers!
&gt;        Andrew.

&gt;Subject: [OT] MacOS for PC
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Hi
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am intending to give my retired parents a pc so they can
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;use the net. But,
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't really want to give them a box with MS Windows on
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;it. I fear I may
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;be around there more often than I like. I think that a
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;linux box may be a
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;bit to complicated for beginners. I was thinking about
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;buying them a Mac,
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;but that seems rather silly seeing I have 2 pc's at home I
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;am not using.
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Besides, if I bought a Mac I would keep it for myself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone know if there is a version of MacOS that runs
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;on an intel based
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;pc ?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Alternatively, is there any Mac shops that sell second
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;hand imacs ?
&gt;  
&gt;
