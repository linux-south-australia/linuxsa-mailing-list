Well gang,
I spent some time and fixed this darn problem and uncovered a few things
whilst at it.
It appears my assumption that 'ifconfig eth0 up' rereads the ifcfg-eth0
file was wrong.  It merely restarts
the previously configured interface.  To force a reread of ifcfg-eth0 it is
required to 'cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts'
and then 'ifup ifcfg-eth0'.  My real problem is to do with a bug in the
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network script.
It reads ALL files with names beginning with "ifcfg-eth".  As I had used
joe to do my editing it was reading the backup file
ifcfg-eth0~ as well (after ifcfg-eth0) and leaving the system configured to
that file.
Here's hoping no-one else gets caught in future.
Don.

&gt; Subject: IP Address change
&gt; Date: Monday, 8 September 1997 19:39
&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; I have a problem with my home RH4.2 box concerning it's IP address.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I attached it to another network.  To do this I needed to change
the
&gt; IP address in /etc/hosts 
&gt; and also the network addressing table in
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.
&gt; This worked fine.  Now I have re-attached it to my local network and
&gt; re-edited those two files back
&gt; to the original setup.   The problem is that immediately after boot
&gt; ifconfig shows the interface up, but
&gt; with the "inet addr:" from earlier in the day.  A "ifconfig eth0 down"
&gt; followed by a "ifconfig eth0 up"
&gt; doesn't change things.  The really weird thing is that if I use netcfg to
&gt; deactivate and activate the eth0
&gt; interface it DOES change the interface IP to what I need.
&gt; This is a clean (as of yesterday) Red Hat 4.2 install.
&gt; 
&gt; Three questions:
&gt; 1) What file(s) should I be looking at???
&gt; 2) What is the command to look for a particular string in every file on
the
&gt; system.  (This way I can look for references
&gt; to the IP address from earlier in the day)
&gt; 3) What files does ifconfig access and what files does netcfg access??? 
&gt; They are obviously different.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any ideas I thank you in advance for your reply.
&gt; regards...Don.
