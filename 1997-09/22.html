&gt; Just re the argument about paths...
&gt; One side effect of having . at the beginning of your path is, as someone has pointed out, is that someone else could put a fake ls file in there...but that is only if your directory is world-writeable, etc. And who here has users directories as chmod 777?
&gt; 700 in my case, and u script to reset them to that too.. hehe
&gt;  
How often do you do an ls while in a directory that isn't under your
$HOME?

That is the problem.  If you aren't in your $HOME directory then its
permissions don't matter.  It also dosn't matter what the trojan is
called, or where it is.  If WEC can trick you into executing it then they
can execute arbitary commands under your UID/GID.  Having . in your $PATH
is one way. Then again using suid/sgid scripts makes it even easier.

&gt; Also, if u have . on the END of your path, then if you make a program called, say, test, and run it, then you may actually run a file somewhere earlier in the path called test. If u are like me, and sometimes put wierd files into /usr/local/bin n stuff, this can cause users hassle when they try to run their little batch/shell scripts etc,and get unexpected results...;)
(note please trim your lines to &lt;80 chars :).

Again, I just type two extra characters when I want to execute an
application under my home directory, fixes all these problems.
