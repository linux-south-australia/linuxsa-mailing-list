Here is a belated, but not entirely forgotten thankyou.

At the last meeting, when I did the thankyous I ommited a
someone that actually did a considerable amount of work
to enable maddog to come to town.

Well it's not really a person, but a company, 


	Netcraft Australia.


NetCraft provided some of the finer organisation with regard 
to getting maddog on the night.  NetCraft also orchestrated 
getting the sound system in and setting that up.  NetCraft 
was also very active in the promoting of the presentation.
Finally NetCraft organised the gift of Australian Produce
for maddog.


More importantly NetCraft also provided considerable 
financial support to LinuxSA with regard to the hiring 
of the sound system and provision of the gift presented 
to maddog on the day.





Although this seems like a shameless plug for NetCraft it 
isn't.  It was a severe oversight on my behalf not 
thanking them on the night.  This is my way of making up
to them.

I think that we should all thank NetCraft Australia.  
I give them a virtual round of applause. (The ones they
should have got on the night.

Thanks to NetCraft.

Matthew Tippett
