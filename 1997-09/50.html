Alan Kennington  &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Alan.Kennington@dsto.defence.gov.au">Alan.Kennington@dsto.defence.gov.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt; There seems to be some real ambiguity as to what chip is in
&gt; the card, and the warranty at the computer store does not
&gt; permit me to open the box to have a look. (There are seals on
&gt; the box.)

Don't know about your ethernet card, but I doubt the seal on the box
(assuming 'the box' is the computer case) is binding.  Modern computers
are consumer appliances which do contain user-servicable parts and you
are allowed to open it, for example to install a new sound or a video
capture card.  Further-more the seal could be illegal because it serves
to restrict competition: if you can't open the box the only place you
can buy more memory, or more disk--or a sound or video capture card for
that matter--is from the original vendor.  Such a restriction is not
legal.

The advice I've had from The Office of Consumer & Business Affairs is
that you do have a statutory warranty which they cannot avoid, and if
there is a warranty claim your vendor must look at why you broke their
seal and what was done before they could deny any warranty claim.

If it were me I'd completely ignore that seal.
