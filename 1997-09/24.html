Hi everyone,
I have a problem with my home RH4.2 box concerning it's IP address.

Today I attached it to another network.  To do this I needed to change the
IP address in /etc/hosts 
and also the network addressing table in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.
This worked fine.  Now I have re-attached it to my local network and
re-edited those two files back
to the original setup.   The problem is that immediately after boot
ifconfig shows the interface up, but
with the "inet addr:" from earlier in the day.  A "ifconfig eth0 down"
followed by a "ifconfig eth0 up"
doesn't change things.  The really weird thing is that if I use netcfg to
deactivate and activate the eth0
interface it DOES change the interface IP to what I need.
This is a clean (as of yesterday) Red Hat 4.2 install.

Three questions:
1) What file(s) should I be looking at???
2) What is the command to look for a particular string in every file on the
system.  (This way I can look for references
to the IP address from earlier in the day)
3) What files does ifconfig access and what files does netcfg access??? 
They are obviously different.

If anyone has any ideas I thank you in advance for your reply.
regards...Don.
