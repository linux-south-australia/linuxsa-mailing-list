I havent found any oz importers of clone boards, but Digital does have
an OEM board. They are still a little outside the price range that you
are probably looking for, but there are some good deals around on the
first generation (EV4) stuff to be had.

There are not many 'real' manufacturers of OEM boards, many/most are
just rebadged digital semi products, but you might want to look at one
exception at <A HREF="http://www.sec.samsung.com/Products/alpha/alpha-page1.html">http://www.sec.samsung.com/Products/alpha/alpha-page1.html</A>
, I dont know what the pricing is likely to be. NCR810 scsi, Matrox
Millennium etc. are cards Digital use in their own AXP solutions so that
might explain why they are preferred by clone users. (I dont believe
these parts are re-engineered by Digital, like the RZ disk series was
(from quantum/Seagate etc.) for example.)

Re the Multia's, yes they did come to vk, they can be had for 'very'
cheap if you can find them ... which is getting a bigger 'if' as time
goes on unfortunately. At 166 they still offer quite reasonable
performance, but to reflect on the original thread it would be true to
say that all bogomips are not created equal ...

&gt;
&gt;A machine so fast that the paint has bubbled on the case :-)
&gt;
&gt;I spoke to a friend of mine at Uni this morning at he told me that the
&gt;DEC Alpha he has on his desk cost the Uni $12k with the Uni discount
&gt;of 33%. This make the machine way beyond the means of mere mortals
&gt;that most of use are.
&gt;I was wondering if anyone knows of an Australian imported of clone
&gt;boards that I've seen advertise in Linux Journal by people such as
&gt;DCG and Apache. The appear to use bog standard NCR810 SCSI
&gt;controllers and Matrox video cards. Making a system very cheap to
&gt;built from locally available components.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;Ben
&gt;
&gt;PS: Did DEC ever bring the Multia (UDB) into Australia ? I've seen the
&gt;      US 166Mhz version for good prices in:
