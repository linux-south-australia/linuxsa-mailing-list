Hi all,

People should remember Australian Personal Computer having a
discussion forum on whether they should have stuff on Linux in their
mag.  For those who weren't paying attention or didn't find out about
it, there were about 100 positive messages in just a few days.  The
APC staff seemed pretty impressed and said that they were convinced.

There are now a few forums at <A HREF="http://www.apcmag.com/">http://www.apcmag.com/</A> "for OS-specific
technical queries, hints and tips, or to get in touch with other
users".  There's one forum for Windows 95, one for OS/2 Warp, one for
Mac OS, and best of all, one for Linux!

Also, someone said on the Linux forum "Just thought I'd ask if APC is
intending to give Linux coverage in the dead tree edition of APC" and
the reply was:
-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----8&lt;-----
Linux coverage is starting on a regular basis in November. The first
few Linux columns will be, as it happens, about the issues to consider
when setting up Linux.

Later the column will move to more generalised, technical and in-depth
issues to do with Linux, but always with a tutorial bend on what you
can do and how to go about doing it.

If anyone has any suggestions for topic ideas, or certain aspects of
Linux you'd like to see covered, feel free to email me.

Ashton
