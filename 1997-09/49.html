Linux persons:

About a year after installing linux on my pentium 133,
I still have not been able to use it in any serious way -- because
I've had terrible luck with ethernet cards.
My third (and current) card is an Intel EtherExpress Pro/10+ PIC card,
which, being very costly, I had assumed would be fast and good.
Unfortunately, it turns out to be about 10-15% as fast as
an el cheapo $60 non-name (almost) card, and I can't seem
to get a driver for it under linux.

There seems to be some real ambiguity as to what chip is in
the card, and the warranty at the computer store does not
permit me to open the box to have a look. (There are seals on
the box.) My attempts to register with RedHat (which I purchased
after the CD-ROM in the back of a book didn't work out that well)
did not succeed, and I couldn't e-mail to them to tell them about it
because I wasn't registered. I made many attempts to register over
the web.

Anyway, I now see two solutions:

1.      Get a dinkum driver for the card I've got, or...
2.      cut my losses and get another card.

Can anyone recommend to me a good card (maybe one of the 3Coms?)
and a place to buy it, so that I can use it under RedHat linux
(and also the other so-called OSs sold by a certain company)?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I use the ethernet card principally to connect to my home sparc station,
which I connect to the net via PPP over telephone modem.
