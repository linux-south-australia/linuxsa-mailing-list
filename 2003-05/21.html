&gt;Does anyone happen to know the fix for this problem (apart from dumping SuSE)?
&gt;
&gt;Problem:
&gt;I install SuSE 8.1 in a rather normal sort of way on a rather normal
&gt;sort of mums-and-dads PC with Hyundai monitor and 
&gt;S-Media nVidia GeForce2 MX-400 AGP graphics card.
&gt;
I also have this thing about using software that is a year or two newer 
than the hardware it will run on. Maybe try SuSE 7x, then upgrade.

**************************************************************************************************************

When you get to the log in screen, does the command sax2 work? That 
should get you directly to the monitor setup.

I don't know much about the monitor model. If it is an older one, you 
coul try installing the older xfree compatability packages. These can be 
selected during setup.

&gt;
&gt;The installation seems to go normally until X is run -- and then the
&gt;screen goes blank and the lights flash on the monitor.
&gt;

Does a GUI come up during the installation?  If not, then it is not 
being detected. You need to find out what the specs on your monitor are 
and then enter them in sax manually.

&gt;I can log in on the ethernet and re-boot, and re-boot the machine into
&gt;some sort of "safe mode" which has these kernel parameters:
&gt;
&gt;========================================================
&gt;title failsafe
&gt;   kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz.shipped root=/dev/hda3 ide=nodma apm=off acpi=off vga=normal nosmp maxcpus=0 disableapic 3
&gt;========================================================
&gt;
&gt;This is in some modern-fangled /boot/grub/menu.lst file.
&gt;(I hope this GRUB thing has some advantages to make up for the fact
&gt;that I've got to forget everything I learned about lilo for 8 years!)
&gt;  
&gt;
The pretty picture that comes up when you reboot is the real benefit. 
 The side benefit is the ability to boot a kernel stored almost anywhere 
on your hard drive. Or vis a vi.  :-)

&gt;I suspected that the problem could be related to 
&gt;automatic power management blanking the monitor.
&gt;So I thought that maybe those APM/ACPI off parameters were saving me
&gt;when I got a plain text console when I used the failsafe mode.
&gt;
&gt;However.... when I got into Yast2 (because SuSE scrapped the superior
&gt;YaST1 which actually had more functions and was easier to use),
&gt;
&gt;everything went fine until I tried to configure the monitor parameters.
&gt;Obviously it must have tried to fire up the X window system again - because
&gt;the monitor and keyboard locked up again.
&gt;
&gt;So I logged in over the ethernet and ran YaST2 in text mode and
&gt;tried to configure the monitor again. And surprise, surprise... my remote
&gt;CLI login hung!!
&gt;
&gt;====================
&gt;By an odd coincidence, the other machine I loaded SuSE 8.1 onto - a
&gt;quite different machine - also had painful problems with the graphics
&gt;configuration. Is SuSE 8.1 just not very good at graphics configuration?
&gt;  
&gt;
Depends upon how old your monitors and graphics cards are and what 
version of xfree86 is installed in SuSE. AFAIK.

SuSE 7x  to 8 supported a few older Dell monitors here, but the update 
required that I install the vendor's driver as well as an older version 
of xfree.

&gt;Has anyone else had this problem?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I must say that I'm very disappointed that absolutely every single thing
&gt;(except a few things) that I try in linux is a right royal pain.
&gt;Things are fine as long as I don't try to make anything better.
&gt;Any sort of new hardware or software requires hours, days, weeks or
&gt;months of pain.
&gt;  
&gt;
I think that has improved with SuSE 8.2 did a nice job of autodetecting 
both of my webcams -&gt; Xirlink generic and Logitech Quickcam Express, my 
Handspring visor, zip drive, cdrom R/W and RO and printer.


&gt;I still have 3 sound cards which are resisting all attempts at configuration.
&gt;
I am just curious,  what kernel are you using? Is sound enabled? If so, 
have you gone to alsa.org and downloaded the driver, installed it and 
ran the utility I mentioned in a recent post?


&gt;I bet ms-wind users don't spend 5 days a month diagnosing configuration errors.
&gt;
True, unless you buy a network card or two whose Windblows drivers are 
not digitally signed. :-)  
I had a post on that frustration.

&gt;Maybe I should stop buying such cheap hardware or something.
&gt;  
&gt;
Ah haaa!   Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell.
Now we know the real reason!

SuSE autodetects weather your hardware is cheap and makes sure that "you 
get what you pay for."

Just kidding....

Hope the xfree compatability and alsa thing-a-muh-bobbers work.

&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;PS.  The old YaST installation tool for SuSE used to allow you to
&gt;choose any software on the distribution disks for installation.
&gt;Now it seems to only permit you to install stuff from the first
&gt;2 our of 7 disks. It never offers to install source for you any more.
&gt;It mystifies me that people scrap things that work and replace them
&gt;with things that don't work.
&gt;
But without this, wouldn't life be boring? :-)

&gt;This has happened to my favourite ice cream, my favourite cottage cheese,
&gt;my favourite shampoo, bread, etc. etc. As soon as the manufacturers
&gt;realise that I like something, it's immediately discontinued.
&gt;The very day I find that linux is perfect in every way, it will be replaced
&gt;by something completely different which doesn't work at all.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
Cheers,

James Leone
