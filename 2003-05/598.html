&gt; Does anyone have any recent experience of using 2 or more monitors

Yes! It's called xinerama and the howto is at
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Xinerama-HOWTO/index.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Xinerama-HOWTO/index.html</A> The xinerama
extensions have been available since XFree86-4.x.x first came out AFAIK.

&gt; 
&gt; I remember that when the X window system was first getting popular
&gt; in the late 1980s, there was X server software which would allow you
&gt; to move your mouse to the side of the screen and you would
&gt; then find yourself on a monochrome X screen :0.1 or :1.0 or something,
&gt; instead of the usual :0.0. So one monitor emulated two monitors.
&gt; This was in SunOS 4, I think.
&gt; But the literature indicated that the purpose of the :X.Y screen notation
&gt; was to permit multiple monitors to connect to one computer.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that nowadays we use multiple simulated desktops in KDE and Gnome
&gt; and click with a mouse or control-Fn to shift between desktops, it

The xfree specs allow for up to 8 billion virtual desktops. Imagine a
number line going to plus or minus 4 billion. Funnily though, gnome
doesn't respect negative desktop numbers, but I'm not sure about kde.

&gt; occurred to me that with the decreasing prices of CRT screens, we should
&gt; all be able to afford to keep our old monitors and line them up
&gt; in a row on the physical desktop - as a sort of history of the evolution
&gt; of monitors - and stick one graphics card in the PC for each monitor.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm surprised I've never heard anyone mention this sort of thing. Is that
&gt; because there's some "show stopper" or because no one's thought of it,
&gt; or because I just don't move in the right circles?
&gt; I feel an ascii diagram coming on...

&gt;                 \           |          /
&gt;                  \          |         /

&gt;                     mouse     keyboard
&gt; 
&gt; (I bet someone's written software to generate ascii diagrams...)

Look for dia which is an app that can draw flowcharts and all kinds of
diagrams.

&gt; Then the idea would be to set up the software so that the mouse moves off
&gt; monitor 1 to monitor 2 when you go off the right edge, and the
&gt; keyboard input follows the mouse cursor.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone actually have any experience of doing this?
&gt; If so, was it easy to do? I can imagine that the XF86Config file would

If you have the hardware all setup just do X -configure.

&gt; be the place to make it happen. But would KDE let it happen?
&gt; I don't want to start trying to do this unless someone has succeeded already.
&gt; My purpose is to reduce the amount of time I spend tediously clicking
&gt; between my 16 KDE software desktops. I bet it would be great for

I use simple key combination assignments to switch between desktops
really quickly.

&gt; network management centres too. You could have a bank of 9 monitors,
&gt; 3 wide and 3 high, monitoring everything that's fit to monitor.
&gt; Of course you might want a larger mouse pad then.
&gt; 

I currently am using 3 monitors with a single desktop of 3072x768 (I
only have crappy monitors). The window manager needs to support the
xinerama extensions to X though. KDE uses kwin as it's window manager
and I haven't had any problems with it, but I use fvwm and fvwm-themes
myself. Incidently fvwm has both gnome and kde compliance, xinerama
support, session management, and much much more....

The man XF86Config page has information on the ServerLayout section and
as an example my XF86Config can be viewed at
<A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/awol/configs/XF86Config-4.triple.">http://awol.no-ip.org/awol/configs/XF86Config-4.triple.</A> I have 3 video
cards but the minimum requirement AFAIK is 2. One has to be AGP and the
other PCI. You can also run two different windows managers on each
monitor but then you can't drag windows between them.

The really cool way to use xinerama is with vmware running windows. Then
you can have the left monitor for example running vmware windows in full
screen mode and linux on the right monitor, with the mouse moving
seamlessly between the two operating systems. Lots of fun!  ;-P

Hope this helps.

Alex
