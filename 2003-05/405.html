&gt;    Hello,
&gt;  I have just installed redhat 9 and the sound module will not load for the Creative 5.1 card that I have . Is there any known issues with this card in Redhat . The card works fine in Mandrake 9 .

Hi Pete.

Typically, sound card drivers are loaded by using a command at the shell 
prompt called modprobe. You have to be logged in as root, and typing 
"su" prevents you from having to log out and back in again.

The only trick is figuring out which driver to use.  However, the 
command is pretty easy, its just "modprobe name-of-driver."  So for 
example, if I wanted to load a driver named "widget", I would type 
"modprobe widget", without the quotes, at the shell prompt.

You can find out what driver Mandrake used, by being logged in as root, 
and typing the command "lsmod."  That will list all of your drivers. 
However, its not easy to pick out what is what unless you are able to 
write all of the names down. It also doesn't help much if Mandrake is no 
longer installed.

There is a more automated, but a bit riskier of a way to load the 
driver.  You could go to <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/,">http://www.alsa-project.org/,</A> download this 
package-&gt;<A HREF="ftp://ftp.silug.org/pub/alsa/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.3a.tar.bz2,">ftp://ftp.silug.org/pub/alsa/driver/alsa-driver-0.9.3a.tar.bz2,</A> 
and unzip the file by right clicking on it, selecting action, then 
extract. Place the whole set in your home directory.

Go to the shell and type:
cd alsa-driver-0.9.3a
./configure
make
make install

When that is through,

cd /utils
./alsaconf

alsaconf will detect your soundcards and configure the drivers.

HTH,

James Leone
