Ok, I am a bit annoyed. :-(  I need to know how to get IMAP to run in 
SSL so I can use Squirrelmail.

With the goal of learning today, I decided that I would like to try to
set up Squirrelmail, a nice looking web based mail client, on the 
server.  So I load up the RPM during the install, and do a quick check 
to see if it will pull up on a web based interface, and yes it did, so 
it looked promising.

But when I tried to log in, I get the following message on the web page:

"Warning: fsockopen()[function.fsockopen]:php_hostconnect: connect
failed in /srv/www/htdocs/squirrelmail/functions/imap_general.php on
line 172."

Luckily I was able to glean that I had to install UW Imap server from
this, so after I installed the RPM for that, I tried to log in, and I
got this message:

"ERROR

Unknown user or password incorrect

Go to the login page"

WTF? I already had a James set up on the server.

Ok, so I ran nmap from the console to see if the imap service was running:

nmap 192.168.5.66

Starting nmap V. 3.00 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )

Interesting ports on (192.168.5.66):

(The 1592 ports scanned but not shown below are in
state: closed)

Port State Service

143/tcp open imap2

Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned
in 6 seconds

Nmap was recently showing the default port reading for services and not
the actual ports open.  This wasted hours of my time when I was reverse
engineering the Gestetner Multifunctional scan server. So I have this in
mind.

Then I did a search of the Linuxsa archives and this message came up:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-05/465.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-05/465.html</A>

I tried to telnet over to the IMAP server and I saw this behavior, which
is different than described on the above post:

telnet 192.168.5.66 143

Trying 192.168.5.66...

Connected to 192.168.5.66.

Escape character is '^]'.

WTF???

Login Disabled...who the heck did that? I didn't!

And the FAQ's for IMAP are 55 pages big, and section 7.4 is supposed


So I search then I find this:

<A HREF="http://www.wu-wien.ac.at:8082/rfc/rfc2595.hyx/3.2._bIMAP_bLOGINDISABLED_bcapability">http://www.wu-wien.ac.at:8082/rfc/rfc2595.hyx/3.2._bIMAP_bLOGINDISABLED_bcapability</A>

An exerpt:

&gt;    The current IMAP protocol specification (RFC 2060) requires the
&gt;    implementation of the LOGIN command which uses clear-text passwords.
&gt;    Many sites may choose to disable this command unless encryption is
&gt;    active for security reasons.  An IMAP server MAY advertise that the
&gt;    LOGIN command is disabled by including the LOGINDISABLED capability
&gt;    in the capability response.  Such a server will respond with a tagged
&gt;    "NO" response to any attempt to use the LOGIN command.


My comment is: Oh hell!

I try to telnet to port 993, no response. I try the web browser on 
https:, no response.

And where is the bloddy /etc/imap.conf file that allows me to specify this?

I have piles of print outs two inches thick from google searches, etc.

************************************************************

Computing should not be this difficult.

First of all, no where in the documentation do I find anything of this 
nature at Squirrelmail to warn me.

Secondly, I am _lucky_ that I guessed that it was IMAP and not 
Squirrelmail. What's there to differentiate to the average user, that 
its not a squirrel mail problem?

Thirdly, the Squirrelmail mail group has so many messsages for help on 
the mail list, that it takes a significant amount of time to find an 
appropriate message, and when I find it, I can see that one guy has been 
asking the list for 4 days the same question I have.

Further the University of Washington mail list simply didn't answer 
someone's question about this from January 2002:

<A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/imap/listarch/2002/msg00024.html">http://www.washington.edu/imap/listarch/2002/msg00024.html</A>

Ughhhhhh!

P.S.

I had recently set up the server again to change to SuSE 8.2 on the
server instead of Mandrake.  In the process I figured out why the server
would be powered off at random times.  The power supply program nut
wasn't working well with my small APCC boxes.  But I digress.
