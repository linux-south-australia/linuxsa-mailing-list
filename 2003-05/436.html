&gt; &gt; I think he is trying to protect users (giving them the right to fix and

&gt; &gt; redistributed derivatives both acknowledge and enhance their original 
&gt; &gt; work), which is a noble persuit. However to say Satallman is doing this 
&gt; &gt; is incorrect. He is responsible for the GPL and a lot of evangilism, but 
&gt; &gt; it is the copyright holder who releases their code under the GPL that is 
&gt; &gt; to "blame".
&gt; 
&gt; It's going to be harsh for users when companies decide to produce no
&gt; driver for linux at all.  Some businesses clearly find it palatable to
&gt; give away a binary kernel module but quite unacceptable to give away the
&gt; source (and thus to give away the bulk of their intellectual property
&gt; rights.)  Force them to choose between giving source or giving nothing,
&gt; and some will give nothing.  It's hard to see how users benefit from
&gt; that losing those drivers.

And of course hardware manufacturers were already porting drivers for
their products to non-(current)-Windows platforms, right?  Well, no.  I
have a digital video camera that has support under Win9X, but not Win2k
or XP.  Because there is no source, my device is obsoleted by companies
following their primary goal - making money - which means that consumers
lose out.

If they had released source I could have ported my camera driver to
Linux, *BSD, Windows XP, or even a Mac.  Now I'm stuck.

My point?  If companies choose to supply no source, then you should
choose another supplier.  This is independent of your OS.

Binary drivers are almost as bad as no drivers at all - as your OS
improves, the binary API changes, and your binary modules won't work, so
it's just delaying the inevitable loss of access to your device.

Choose suppliers that provide source code to ensure access to your own
device.
