yer i dunno
my vaio laptop been running for 2 & 1/2  years without any problems
i guess it is luck of the draw tho
sony sent me stuff a couple of times too.. crappy stuff, vaio t-shirts, 
mouse pads etc...

one tip that i wish i had gotten b4 i got my laptop - LOOK FOR DEAD PIXELS

most places say that up to 4 dead pixels are acceptable - its a 
manufacturing thing

my sony had 1 dead pixel when i got it (didn't notice in the shop) ..

so turn the machine on, get a black screen and look for unblack pixels
then get a white screen, and look for unwhite pixels
then get a green screen..
then a red..
then a blue..

well actually, maybe red/green/blue is all you have to test..

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am currently in the market to purchase a new laptop before the end of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;financial year. My &gt;budget is @$4000.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any suggested retailers/resellers here in adelaide that

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a particular model/brand people have had problems with that I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;should stay away from ?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I bought my Toshiba Satellite 1110 at Harvey Norman.  Yes, they have a poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;range and the prices can sometimes be lousy, but they gave me 17 month
&gt;&gt;&gt;interest free no deposit terms ;-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;This is the top model Satellite 1110 but it's reasonably cheap and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;quality is only "good" not "great" as a Toshiba should be.  One motherboard
&gt;&gt;&gt;has already been replaced...  With a budget of $4k you can easily get a
&gt;&gt;&gt;'real' Toshiba not manufactured by Compal.  Apparently the way to tell is
&gt;&gt;&gt;that 'real' Toshibas run at 15v while Compals are 19v.  I'm sure this will
&gt;&gt;&gt;change someday (or may have already), but it appears to be a good yardstick
&gt;&gt;&gt;to go by.  Most top tier manufacturers OEM a good deal of their product line
&gt;&gt;&gt;anyway (Sony, Dell, IBM, NEC, etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you do decide to get a Toshiba the service centre in Adelaide (BMS
&gt;&gt;&gt;Technology) is very good to deal with and they have always dealt with me
&gt;&gt;&gt;promptly and curtisouly.  Replacement parts arrive the next day and the
&gt;&gt;&gt;laptop is up and running that day.  Only the Toshiba head office in Sydney
&gt;&gt;&gt;sometimes introduce some delays in answering questions but there's not much
&gt;&gt;&gt;BMS can do about it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;See ya
