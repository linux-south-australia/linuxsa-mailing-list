&gt; The  protocol would basically be an agreement between the ISP and I 
&gt; suppose other ISP's [the group Kevin W(1) is with] that if one ISP 
&gt; sent above a certain % of spam, they will be blocked for a certain 
&gt; time. The blocker would have to notify the blockee ISP and the blockee 
&gt; ISP would notify its customers. Or maybe screen customers.... :-)

That's kind of the concept behind SPEWS; thing is, getting your IP 
range out of a SPEWS blacklist, even if it isn't your server, is 
virtually impossible (colo facility I was with unknowingly were hosting 
spammers).  Seems the only way you can contact the spews guys is via 
newsgroups/usenet, and from what I've seen, they're *not* very helpful, 
and in fact, quite damn rude.  The colo facility ended up getting a 
whole range of new IP's because the spews guys basically went off at 
the colo facility saying they ignored one warning (probably because 
they never DID check their email regularly).

Spam filters seem like the best solution for now; although this is far 
from desirable.  Blocking huge subnets just seems silly, IMO, unless 
you're receiving thousands of emails a day from an indeterminable 
amount of addresses within that range (is that what's happening, 
Kevin?).  What's the point in blocking spam if you're crippling your 
ability to communicate with a proportionally large part of the world?
