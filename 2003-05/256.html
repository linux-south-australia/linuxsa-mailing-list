&gt; Ok, to clear this up. The Windows2k PDC logs show that the samba server has failed an authentication test as a standard "Invalid uid and or password" according the the logs - this happends aprox every 30 seconds. Im trying to figure out why this is when the samba server is only sharing files and printers.
&gt; 
&gt; My first assumption is that one of hundreds of windows2k clients is the cause of the problem. I think this because smbstatus sometimes shows IPC$ sessions as 'nobody' coming from machine A while at the same time showing valid sessions as a valid domain user from the same machine A. 
&gt; 
&gt; The logs only show these errors from samba, not the windows2k clients. 
&gt; 
&gt; The samba config relavent to this is:
&gt; &gt; &gt;    security = server
&gt; &gt; &gt;    password server = NTMachine
&gt; &gt; &gt;    encrypt passwords = yes
&gt; 
&gt; But i can show more if you need it. From here i need to know what questions to ask as im a little lost as to the cause of the error logs.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this clears this up a little :)

'NTMachine' is a 2K Machine running as a PDC, but the Samba machine is
not a member of the domain, but rather uses the old-style authentication
stuff. Much clearer :-)

If you don't want to do a packet capture, try turning the log level up a
little at a time. You should be able to change the log level without
restarting Samba by changing the smb.conf file, sending a SIGHUP to the
smbd processes, waiting, changing it back and sending another SIGHUP to
the smbd processes.

This problem may not occur if the Samba machine were a member of the
domain, but if the Samba machine is a production server, you may have to
do a little more testing before making that change.

Hope it helps,
Matt
