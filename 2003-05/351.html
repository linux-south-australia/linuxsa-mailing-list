Loophole from the "tainted" kernels?

It's occurred to me that the "tainted kernel" thing
can be removed fairly simply, and in accordance with the GPL etc. etc.

The enforcement of the GPL kernel modules is done by the linker "ld"
or whatever, which is GPLed and therefore can be forked.
So anyone who wants to avoid those GPL constraints can just
fork their own "ld" which doesn't mix politics with software
and they can freely link what they like into the kernel, as originally 
advertised by Linus et al. 

Then the mildly offensive "tainted" label on the "lsmod" output can
be removed similarly.

The linux kernel 2.4.20 compiled and linked etc. with older "ld",
"insmod", "lsmod" etc. show no symptoms of creeping exclusionism.
So the solution is to just hold on to your old linker etc.
This could become another SSH versus OpenSSH saga.

Of course "they" might then put in a clause in the kernel licence to
exclude use of forked linkers etc.
This is reminiscent of the Debian assertion that the GPL itself is not
a free document since it forbids modification.
Eventually the linux kernel licence could forbid modification of the linker,
compiler etc. to prevent fair use of the kernel for in-house work.
It's starting to look a bit like DRM and Palladium, if you project the
trend forward a couple of years.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the linux kernel forks as a result of
the GPL kernel module enforcement. Some big company could see it in their
interests to maintain a forked kernel which permits any non-GPL modules,
or even BSD or Artistic Licence modules etc. etc.
There are already effectively forked kernels from SuSE, Redhat etc.
As someone once said, software wants to be free.
Anyway, Sunday's almost over. Time to get serious again....

Cheers and hamsters,
Alan Kennington.
