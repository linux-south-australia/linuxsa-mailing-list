Hi All..

I'm currently running Redhat 8.0 on my desktop and I'm finding 2D stuff
in X rather slow (e.g. xmms plugins run like a dog, terminal windows
scroll slowly).  

I have got DRI going for the 3D stuff and OpenGL is smooth and fast but
for some reason 2D redraws on my Radeon 7500 seem to have high latency
under RH 8.0 and I can't really work out why.

Anyway I ran up the latest Knoppix release the other day and suddenly 2D
came to life.  My xmms plugins were smooth, terminal sessions had snappy
scrolling speeds.  The only thing I can think (after much mucking around
comparing XF86Config files and logs between Knoppix and RH 8.0) is that
XFree86 V4.3 (which the latest Knoppix runs) has better drivers for my
Radeon than the 4.2 version shipped in RH8.

I'm now considering an upgrade to RH 9.0 which includes XF86 4.3 but
I've just spent the last week getting my system configured up just the
way I want it, so I don't want to go to the lengths of upgrading if RH
9.0 is being received poorly.  I have read a few reviews and nothing too
disturbing has been reported about RH 9.0 but I'm wondering if any list
members have any first hand comments to make about it, specifically in
comparison to RH 8.0.

Thanks for your thoughts guys.

Cheers,
Graham Smith
