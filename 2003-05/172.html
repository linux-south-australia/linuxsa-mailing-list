My sound card problems resolved: ALSA not in standard kernel.

Referring back to a problem or two which I had aeons ago with sound
card configuration, I think I've found a simple explanation for my problems.
No, it's not my brain... It's the fact that the machines that I was
trying to get sound going on both had linux kernel 2.4.20 downloaded
fresh from the net (from AARNet actually) and therefore did not contain ALSA!

The SuSE system configuration is all set up around the idea of using
ALSA software rather than some obscure sound software clump called OSS.
(I don't have the time to research the differences between these, but I 
gather they're two alternative sound software APIs or something.)

Anyway, this finally shows me one of the pitfalls of using these
customized kernels from linux distro mongers. 
They add in lots of useful stuff, like ALSA, and then when you
want to get the latest kernel (e.g. to fix some major vulnerability such
as 2.4.20 just happens to have anyway), you find that a bunch of
stuff doesn't work any more. In my case, I've now wasted a lot of
valuable time because I wasn't aware of this.
(A related problem is the lack of a .config file in the SuSE kernel
source that they give you. So you get the source all right, but they
don't give you the crucial .config file you need for recompiling it.
Of course you can create your own, but it won't yield the same kernel
that they put on your system.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
The kernel module licence enforcement/policing.

A colleague of mine interstate has found something reverse - he was compiling a
very basic sort of hello-world sort of kernel module and found that
the linker didn't want to link it to the rest of the kernel because
it wasn't compiled as GPL. So he had to state it was GPL to get it to link.
But in his case he _was_ using a distro version of the kernel, in this
case from Redhat. So something in the kernel was getting strict about
GPL linking which is not so strict in the official standard kernel.
(I've heard about the new politically aware linker, but it's never
affected me personally so far.)

It irks me a little that the file /usr/src/linux/include/module.h
(in a kernel near you) contains this verbiage:

============================================================
/*
 * The following license idents are currently accepted as indicating free
 * software modules
 *
 *      "GPL"                           [GNU Public License v2 or later]
 *      "GPL v2"                        [GNU Public License v2]
 *      "GPL and additional rights"     [GNU Public License v2 rights and more]
 *      "Dual BSD/GPL"                  [GNU Public License v2 or BSD license choice]
 *      "Dual MPL/GPL"                  [GNU Public License v2 or Mozilla license choice]
 *
 * The following other idents are available
 *
 *      "Proprietary"                   [Non free products]
 *
 * There are dual licensed components, but when running with Linux it is the
 * GPL that is relevant so this is a non issue. Similarly LGPL linked with GPL
 * is a GPL combined work.
 *
 * This exists for several reasons
 * 1.   So modinfo can show license info for users wanting to vet their setup 
 *      is free
 * 2.   So the community can ignore bug reports including proprietary modules
 * 3.   So vendors can do likewise based on their own policies
 */
============================================================

So this means that BSD and the Artistic Licence and dozens of other licences
recognized by opensource.org:
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/</A>
are not "free software" according to the kernel developers.
It's like the kernel developers are saying: 
    You're either with us or you're against us.
Have they been spooked by neuf-onze too?
I don't use the GPL myself simply because it _isn't_ a free licence.
It's very restrictive - but I don't want to stir the ghosts of Xmases past
into action on this one...

I think it's getting a bit restrictive when you can't even run
a hello world sort of kernel module without declaring it GPL.
This makes me feel about as "free" as when I used to (try to) program win32.
It looks like the Spanish Inquisition has had its way with the kernel too now.

Anyway, things could be worse. E.g. MS could buy out FSF...
That would put the rat among the pigeons.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Topic 3: My proposal for software nirvana.

I've been thinking that computers are so fast now, and there are
so many peripherals and there's such a big hoik of software in the
world now that we could afford to stop all development for 2 years.
Therefore I propose that there should be a moratorium on all new
software and hardware development for 2 years starting on 1 July 2003
to allow everything to be fully documented.
That's what's lacking right now - documentation.

No programmer or hardware designer should be allowed to do any more
development until they have fully documented everything they have created. 
This would give book publishers time to get things in to print long enough
so that they would still be useful by the time they arrive in the post.
Then users wouldn't have to keep scratching their heads to work out
why their system is nothing at all like the out-of-date books they buy.
It shouldn't be necessary to work out everything by trial and blunder.
I also propose that all source code should be commented so as to
give users some hope of understanding it.

Cheers and grunge,
Alan Kennington.
