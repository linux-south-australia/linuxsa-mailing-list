From: "Kirsty Rae" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:junkie@rae.cx">junkie@rae.cx</A>&gt;
&gt; Do we deserve more money as Linux/Unix SysAdmins compared to the
&gt; Micro$oft SysAdmins.  If we're hardware type engineers, why should we
&gt; get anymore than the TV repair person?

I think it depends on what the engineer does.  If they design circuits they
do deserve more than the person who later services the equipment.  Regarding
the proverbial TV repair person, they are getting squeezed much more than
anyone in the IT field.  It's nice when anyone can go out and purchase 68cm
CRT TVs for $500 or less, but to service that same TV will cost at least $50
in labor costs just to get anyone to merely look at it (not to mention part
costs, which are always high).

&gt; Do I particularly want work going overseas?  No, I don't.  But it
&gt; happens and my place of work is an example of sending work offshore, but
&gt; they're sending it to Oz and I am benefitting from it.  Sending work to
&gt; India is still one of those things that will happen whilst the quality
&gt; of life is lower there, but one day, it will catch up.

I agree.  Movement of employment to cheaper markets is a natural side effect
of Globalisation.  Reading slashdot every day, I get the impression that
there are few IT jobs left in the US and that 'the Indians are taking all
our jobs'.  Both cases are definately not true, and in the latter it's not
people in other countries taking jobs but the US based corporation with
predominantly US based shareholders sending those jobs there.  If anyone's
to blame it's the corporation rather than the worker on the other end.
