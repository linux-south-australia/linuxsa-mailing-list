&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Looking for CDRW Master burners.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Whenever I've been asked to repair something made by Sony it's
&gt; &gt;generally been a bitch to repair, often due to being badly made in the
&gt; &gt;first place, which is also the reason why it failed. I've fixed a Sony
&gt; &gt;amplifier where if you disconnected the preamp section from the power
&gt; &gt;amp section to see which section the fault was in, using the internal
&gt; &gt;plug handily provided, the power supply blew up. And they were
&gt; &gt;responsible for a vast number of shitty CD players in the early days
&gt; &gt;of CD, with their horrible idea of having one DAC multiplexed between
&gt; &gt;channels - blech.
&gt; 
&gt; One DAC multiplexed for both channels was very common across all brands with
&gt; dual DACs only becoming popular in consumer grade equipment in the early
&gt; 90s.  I remember reading a lengthy discussion on the subject in a mid 80s
&gt; Electronics Australia magazine.  There were two primary disadvantages: a
&gt; very slight delay between channels when switching back and forth, and a
&gt; slight decrease in frequency response on mono recordings.  While fringe
&gt; golden eared crowd threw a huge frenzy, 99% of the population were delighted
&gt; to finally have something that sounded better and was more durable than
&gt; vinyl ;-)  Of more concern were the 14bit DACs used early on to cut
&gt; costs....

Yes, In The Beginning there was the Sony chipset (one 16-bit DAC
multiplexed across channels) and the Philips chipset (two 14-bit ADCs,
one for each channel). The 14-bit idea looks dodgy, but the reduction
to 14 bits was by means of an oversampling / noise-shaping technique,
so you did get 16-bit resolution and you got some of the quantising
noise shifted out of band as well. (This is the technique which is
taken to the limit with the 1-bit DAC.) You also got a converter with
better linearity than the 16-bit multiplexed chipset. Really, it was
the 16-bit chipset that was the "cost-cutting" one - ie, using one DAC
instead of two to cut costs.
