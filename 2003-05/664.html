&gt;The linux version of Arcserve, which we have been using for a while,

&gt;worth
&gt;spending the $$$ for, depending on the site of course (tho if the client can
&gt;afford
&gt;a tape robot for the backup system then it may be feasible to them with cost

&gt;PS hope you have more reliability from the DLT tapes than we've had from
&gt;our lowly DAT tapes, had a horror week for data restoration :P

I respect your point of vew, I'm new here in Ade and in Linux too. It is 
just a question.
Why don't you make a separation between two aspects, backup on tape and 
access of users to a "backup" which is located somewhere on a disk? 
Backup means just backup, does not matter what type is it. Direct acces  
of users to a backup seems to be a little strange for me. Make a 
"backup" stategy for them using scripting, put this pseudo-backup on hdd 
and you and can save a lot of $$$.
