&gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; 
&gt; As someone who works regularly with both FreeBSD and Debian 
&gt; systems, I'm
&gt; curious: would you mind highlighting the main problems you 
&gt; are finding with Debian?  
&gt; 
&gt; Is it in large part the problem of the slow Debian stable 
&gt; branch release cycle?

Primarily, yes.

I originally adopted Debian because I thought that it would enable me to
keep up to date with recent software, but would remain more stable than
RedHat (and I don't like RadHat for a variety of reasons). Evidently,
this isn't the focus of Debian, and it seems that FreeBSD (and possibly
gentoo) might be able to give me similar stability, but more up-to-date
packages.

It's really frustrating to go 'apt-get php4', and then try some php
thing, only to find that it requires php 4.3.0 or later (which was
released in Feb of this year), and I only have 4.1.2 (which was released
about Feb of last year). It certainly means that if I ever have a
problem with a certain version of a program, I can't really go to the
developers, because they tell me to use the most recent version. I also
find that it's not entirely trivial to work out which known
vulnerabilities I am still open to, and which have been fixed, because
while I have apache 1.3.26, it's had numerous security patches
backported to it, though I'm not entirely sure which ones.

Yes, I understand the reasons why debian's process is as it is -- I
waited quite some time for Debian 3.0 to come out, and was quite happy
with what I found at the time, but now, it feels restrictively ancient.
I'm not criticising debian per se, I'm just deciding it's not suited to
my needs.

I'm also aware that I can download src-debs, and compile my own debs,
even updating them myself. However, I don't want to do this for a few
reasons:

Firstly, Debian isn't exactly designed to make this easy. It's not that
it's impossible, or even incredibly complex, but I can certainly say
(from experience) that it's a more invovled process than I really want.

Secondly, avoiding getting heavily involved in individually upgrading
packages was one of my (misguided) reasons for choosing debian in the
first place.

Thirdly, there are other OS's (FreeBSD and gentoo in particular) which
appear designed for this very purpose, yet may well share Debian's
reliability and stability.


The other problem that I have found is perhaps more an irritation than a
real problem, and it could just be something that could be tuned out, or
it could be unavoidable in any OS... Performance seems pretty average. I
have a software RAID1 with ext3, and I find that a lot of CPU time is
spent on doing journalling and raiding... I certainly notice a complete
lack of responsiveness when I'm doing anything with the filesystem. The
machine is a 700MHz Celeron with 512 Mb RAM, so it's not exactly slow...


Finally, I am sick of the SysV init scripts, and while I don't go much
on ye olde BSD style scripts, I think I like the new ones in FreeBSD 5.0
-- they work out their own dependencies and all...
