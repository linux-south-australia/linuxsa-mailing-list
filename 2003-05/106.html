&gt; &gt; "Lines from Unix's source code have been copied into the heart of

&gt; &gt; disguise their origin, SCO Group Chief Executive Darl McBride said
&gt; &gt; Thursday."
&gt; 
&gt; So maybe they should just give credit where credit is due. For
&gt; example...

after read the strip it occured to me that it may well have been
intentional. could SCO be really desparate enough to do it themselves?
then point the finger at IBM? stuff like this has happened before.

but that would be bad form on IBMs part for dragging themselves into it
as a large corp that has based large chunks of its product line on
Linux.

hmmm ... makes me wonder if SCO has used any FreeBSD code recently?
or maybe its that SCO OpenServer has borrowed code from Linux ...

SCO have been going down for years. One large nail wont make any
difference now, IMHO. 

SCO Europe have been trying to get the Banking industry on side for over
twelve months, with Linux based and SCO UNIX desktop stuff. It can only
hurt them. So can this possibly help?

confused,

Kim
