&gt; I have a solution -- why doesn't the original sender (Ian?) email
&gt; another similar (or identical) message, and address it to the same
&gt; mailing list, along with both Greg and Brian (the KMail user). 

Ian has done this SFAIK.
I could read his posts direct to me via airnet and via compuserve 
perfect;y well, though they presented differently (the former I could 
see on screen within the message body, the latter produced a widget 
that led to a perfectly readable picture).
That via the lca2004 digest was the original issue.

&gt; Greg
&gt; can diff the two messages, and use his evident knowledge of SMTP and
&gt; MIME to show any changes that *could* affect a mail client, even if
&gt; they *shouldn't*.

He has done this to some extent, I believe.  His cryptic comments about 
the similarities or otherwise meant nothing to me I'm afraid.

&gt; Brian can see if he has the same problem with the
&gt; directly sent copy as he does with the mailing list message. 

See above.  No issues with directly sent jpg or gif files.

&gt; Greg can
&gt; (assuming he can force himself through it) attempt to open both
&gt; messages in KMail also. 

I believe he has sucessfully done this.  I'm not sure if he has tried to 
read the digest version in Kmail.

&gt;By doing this, you should be able to tell
&gt; where the error is coming from -- the sender, the mailing list,
&gt; KMail, or Brian's KMail setup.

Hopefully.  I have sent hime my kmail config for comparison with his, 
but have not seen any result so far.
