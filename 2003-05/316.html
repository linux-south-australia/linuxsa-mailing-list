&gt; Ok, I looked over the etheral sniff some more and I think that the
&gt; multifunctional sends out an FTP job. :-D

Yep, that looks very much like an FTP session to a non-standard port.

&gt; 1. The Windows 2000 "server" sends an arp broadcast to the
&gt; multifunctional.  (I think this means ping)

ARP = address resolution protocol.  The W2K is trying to find
out what MAC address is associated with an IP address.  This
is an integral function of IP which Unix/Linux does fine .

&gt; 4. Another message from multifunctional port 1035 to win2k virtual
&gt; server at port 3670 "USER anonymous"
&gt; 5. Win2k virtual server sends messsage from port 3670 to multifunctional
&gt; port 1035 "331 Password required..."
&gt; 6. Message from multifunctional port 1035 to win2k virtual server port
&gt; 3670 "PASS .."

It's just logging in anonymously (duh!), and I'm not sure if ethereal
is obscuring the password here, or it really is ".".  Shouldn't matter
though - traditionally anonymous logins have accepted any password.

&gt; 8. Message from multifunctional port 1035 to win2k virtual server port
&gt; 3670 "CWD /d000074756b

Interesting - does it always go to this directory?  (You'll probably
need to capture a few more sessions to determine this).

&gt; 10. M (1035) -&gt; W2vs (3670) "CWD 20030507220642105..."
&gt; 11. W2kvs (3670) -&gt; M (1035) "550 .."
&gt; 12. M(1035) -&gt; W2vs (3670) "MKD 20030507220642105..."
&gt; 13. W2k(3670)-&gt;M(1035) "257 MKD command successful..."
&gt; 14. M (1035) -&gt; W2vs (3670) "CWD 20030507220642105..."
&gt; 15. W2k(3670)-&gt;M(1035) "250 CWD command sucessful..."

This is interesting - the scanner tried to move into a
directory that didn't exist, so it then created the
directory and tried again (this time succeeding).  I
think it might do the same for step 8.  That directory
looks suspiciously date/time stampish, too.

&gt; 16. M (1035) -&gt; W2vs (3670) "TYPE I.."
&gt; 17. W2k(3670)-&gt;M(1035) "200 TYPE command sucessful..."

Sets binary transfer mode.

&gt; 18. M (1035) -&gt; W2vs (3670) "PORT 192,168,0,125,4,12.."
&gt; 19. W2k(3670)-&gt;M(1035) "200 PORT command sucessful..."
&gt; 18. M (1035) -&gt; W2vs (3670) "STOR page1.."
&gt; 19. W2k(3670)-&gt;M(1035) "150 Data connection..."
&gt; 20. Scanned document is sent from M (1036)-&gt;W2kvs(1092)
&gt; 
&gt; On line 18, I know what the first 4 numbers are. Any guesses?

Standard FTP protocol - it's the port number for the data
connection, module 256 (the connection details you've mostly
seen above having occurred on the control connection).

4 * 256 + 12 = 1036.  Now look at the port number in step 20.

&gt; This looks like plain old ping and then FTP. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

Congratulations, you've just reverse engineered their proprietary
"protocol".  It looks like anonymous FTP on a non-standard port,
which you should be able to set up just fine under Unix/Linux.
Go get 'em, James!
