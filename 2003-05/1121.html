Glen,

This shows clearly what's wrong with the linux community.
We're not "carefully selected and screened teams of programmers".
But it's clear how to remedy this deficiency in our way of working.
We obviously need some sort of management experts to carefully select
and screen us, and to force us to work in teams rather than just the
individuals that we are. It's no wonder the IP rights of linux software
are so insecure and we have no ownership of IP rights (or much else).
I think this chap has given us all the clear heads-up on this one.
We need more selection, more screening and more monitoring if we're ever
going to build really secure software. No wonder linux has so many bugs in it!!
Maybe if we send this guy money, he'll select, screen and monitor us for free.
I haven't been properly selected, screened or monitored since I wrote
some computer-aided machining software in 1987 in the UK in Basic for DOS 3.0.
(But the company collapsed 1 week after I joined them - literally. Strangely 
enough, the cause was their lack of secure ownwership of IP rights. Hmmm...)

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
