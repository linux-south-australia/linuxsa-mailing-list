 &gt;&gt;&gt;ARP = address resolution protocol.  The W2K is trying to find
 &gt;&gt;&gt;out what MAC address is associated with an IP address.  This
 &gt;&gt;&gt;is an integral function of IP which Unix/Linux does fine .
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;This is what I am missing. The W2k server somehow announces to the
 &gt;&gt;multifunctional that there is a machine named James with a certain ip
 &gt;&gt;address that is an ftp server, ready to receive transmissions.  I need
 &gt;&gt;to sniff when that takes place. It was already in place during the last
 &gt;&gt;sniff.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;From memory (it was last night), all I saw was an ARP request.  Is the
 &gt;the multifunctional preconfigured to know that it has to talk to a
 &gt;machine named James?
 &gt;
What I observe....

When I turn off Win2k,  and go to the multifunctional key pad and press
the scan/update address, it says cannot communicate with the server. It
then has no record of James being a recipient.  I opened up copies of
the files remaining after a copy was transfered over from Win2k to the
multifunctional, and the  body of the file said "james" and that's it.

The very last capture I took, was taken in Win2k after I replugged in
the ethernet cable into the multifunctional, and then had it update
addresses. When the multifunctional updates addresses, the following
happens:



Arp broadcast using IP #'s from Multi to Win2k:  Who has 192.168.x.xxx?
   (Who has win2k?)
ARP response from Win2k to Multi:   192.168.x.xxx is at
00:44:k4:64:77:6f   (Ethernet card number)
(See the bottom of my last post for the remainder of the sniff...)

Roadmap

0. SYN TCP broadcast from Multi (1081) to Win2k (3670) Seq=big number;
Ack,Win & Len=0
1. Arp broadcast using IP #'s from Multi to Win2k:  Who has
192.168.x.xxx?   (Who has win2k?)
ARP response from Win2k to Multi:   192.168.x.xxx is at
00:44:k4:64:77:6f   (Ethernet card number)
(See the bottom of my last post for the remainder of this sniff...)

2. A bunch of TCP communications take place between both machines, at 5
sets of ports; (1081 & 3670),(1082 & 1085),(1086 & 1083),(1087 &
1084),(1088 & 1085) but the data section of the frame is missing.  This
packet sniff is on the bottom of my past post. (This sniff is on the
last post I made where I say a lot more is going on here)
3. The Win2k machine sends a message to M:  "220 server ready" and then
the multifunctional ftp's into the win2k machine and gets 3 copies of
files from Win2k delivering it to M (That sniff is included in the
message where I said that this was fun, so I am not going to LA yet.)
4. M delivers the scanned document to win2k as described last night.

 &gt;
 &gt;If I were me, and I am, which is fortunate, the next step I would do
 &gt;is:
 &gt;
 &gt;1)  Power off the multifunctional.
 &gt;2)  Start tcpdump/ethereal in packet capture mode with a suitable
 &gt;    snaplen, and set the host IP address to that of the
 &gt;    multifunctional.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Ok, I will power off the multifunctional, start the sniff from win2k,
filter it to only display communications with the multifunctional, then
turn on the multifunctional, while continuing the sniff all the way
through a scan and delivery of the document to win2k.

 &gt;-OR-
 &gt;3)  Same as 2, except by MAC address (this will capture any non-IP
 &gt;    traffic, if that is occuring - note that a switched network will
 &gt;    foul this up).
 &gt;
(Yeah I now have a switch)

 &gt;4)  Power up the multifunctional.
 &gt;5)  Do a test scan.
 &gt;
 &gt;Record the times of step four and five (including any substeps), so
 &gt;you can refer back to the capture and say "Aha!  It didn't start the
 &gt;FTP process until after the scan had completed").  I can assist in
 &gt;analysing the capture, if you wish.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;--dt, on the laptop in the smallest room in the house (which happens
 &gt;  to be the cellar).
