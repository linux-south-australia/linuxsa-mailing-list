Hi All,

&gt; It's the classical globalisation effect. I really don't know why it
&gt; hasn't happened in IT sooner given that it is easier to export IT
&gt; knowledge over an IT network than, say, shoes and clothes. (i.e. the
&gt; logistics of sending a finished product over the wire is easier than
&gt; sending a shipment of shoes).
&gt; 
&gt; I tend to think that for the most part that IT has been a white-collar,
&gt; professional industry where this hasn't yet occured...but it will and it
&gt; is already happening.

I agree, and think that this has already occured in other 
technology-industries such as automotive and the electronics industry so 
it is not a new phenomena.

The lesson here is that if you want a viable industry in your country 
you've got to make sure that your product is competitive. For us lucky 
enough to have tech jobs here in Australia aim high and remember that 
staying still is like going backwards.

I deal with electronics at work and at home and after decades of off 
shore manufacture of components and parts from the US, the US actually 
still manufactures a lot of stuff. From what I've seen they 
differentiate by producing world-class quality products - that's how one 
D-subminiture receptacle cost 10x of another and still sells!

Cheers,
Joseph Tan
