Michal,

This is a relevant link:
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/foib">http://www.mail-archive.com/foib</A>@ianbell.com/msg00031.html

Quotation:
"instead of sending a SYN packet like every other TCP/IP application in the 
world, IE would send out the request packet first of all. Just to check. 
Just in case the HTTP server was, oh, say, a Microsoft IIS server."

I'm pretty sure this was in slashdot a couple of months ago, but I'm
not going to wade through their archive for the article.
Microsoft is already guilty of blatant abuse of the TCP spec.
IE users should be banned from the net.

So yes, I think it would be reasonable to get users of ISPs such as,
say, Internode, to require fair play with the rules of TCP.
In fact, a few months ago, I seem to remember getting a big set of
conditions from Internode - and that was just for using their global
roaming service a couple of times a year. In fact, their 8-page set
of conditions (version 2.0, 5/10/2001) requires me (page 6, rule 12)
to comply with the Telecommunications Act 1997. And I must not block or
disrupt the access to the Internet by other users.
That can be taken to mean that I promise not to remove the TCP slow start
algorithm etc. But I guess they'd lose a lost of custom if they
required strict adherence to the TCP spec.

If I get to agree to an 8-page set of conditions for connecting a modem
to the net, then what's wrong with a 1-page set of conditions for use
of an 802.11 transceiver?

It seems inconsistent that users are assumed to behave responsibly
with a 2.4 GHz transceiver but not with a 2400 bits/sec modem.
(I happen to have one of these from the USA which I'm not allowed
to connect to the net because I just might use the wrong settings.)
The govt doesn't need sledgehammers and machine guns to enforce
wireless LAN spectrum - but a 1-page form should not be too onerous.
Then people who fiddle with the registers in the linux kernel code
can't claim ignorance.

Anyway.....

Alan Kennington.
