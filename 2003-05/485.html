 &gt; It's RFC 3095. 
 &gt; <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3095.txt">http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3095.txt</A>

Sect 4.5.5 says, 

  This section assumes (initially) that the IPv4 stack at the source
  host assigns IP-ID according to the value of a 2-byte counter which
  is increased by one after each assignment to an outgoing packet.

That's a horrible assumption.  Even if your reading of STD-5 was correct
(and I still claim that it isn't!), assuming that the header Identification
is a monotonically increasing integer is bizarre.  There is -nothing-
in STD-5 which says that needs to be the case;  And there are good reasons
for using a PRNG or a CRC16 for working out the "unique" identifier, which
would ruin the dodgy assumption in sect 4.5.5 just as resolutely as
setting the Identification to zero.

RFC-3095 is making an assumption which isn't backed-up by any other 
standard.  That's the source of your problem.  I could answer all of 
your complaints about the Linux kernel failing to honor STD-5 by 
writing a subroutine which calculated a 16 bit CRC and stuffed it into
the IP-ID field;  But that wouldn't help you at all with RFC-3095, would
it?

 &gt; Sooner or later it will come out into the open that the linux OS
 &gt; has an inefficient interaction with voice and video over 3G (and 2.5G)
 &gt; networks. Eventually, the linux kernel people will feel the pressure and
 &gt; they will put back the varying IP ID fields as they no doubt used to
 &gt; be before some bright spark removed them.  (I'm making assumptions here.)

The problem is with the authors of RFC-3095, not the Linux kernel.

 &gt; But briefly, RFC 3095 reduces the IP/UDP/RTP header on all
 &gt; voice and video traffic from typically 40 bytes down to 1 or 2 bytes
 &gt; most of the time. With linux IP/UDP/RTP headers, that will be 3 or 4 bytes
 &gt; because a constant ID field can't be compressed. 

&lt;aghast&gt;  Then we're talking about a difference of two bytes...?

 &gt; That's because of a clever compression algorithm which exploits the
 &gt; fact that the ID field increases by 1 per packet in most OSs.
 &gt; It just didn't occur to the RFC 3095 standards people that anyone would
 &gt; use constant ID values. So they didn't cater for that possibility.

They don't cater for any possibility -except- the id increasing by 1 per 
packet.

Serious question, Alan:  If there was code in the kernel which used a 
CRC16 to set the IP-ID field, would you have "difficulties" with the 
kernel or with RFC-3095?
