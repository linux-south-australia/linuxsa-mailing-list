&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What bothers me about Novell's letter is that they are as vague in
&gt;&gt; refuting SCO's rights as SCO are in providing specific evidence of
&gt;&gt; misappropriated IP.  Novell sold UNIX to SCO; there's a contract which
&gt;&gt; both of those parties signed; so why can't Novell be certain about
&gt;&gt; what rights they sold to SCO, and agbout what interests SCO can
&gt;&gt; demonstrate?
&gt;
&gt; Agreed, this upset me too.  I'm wondering if it's not just an American
&gt; way of expressing themselves (or possibly CYA).  Elsewhere in the
&gt; letter they were much more forceful and definite.

I took the wording as saying "there is nothing we have or are aware of
that validates your claim, but it is possible that there are claims we
don't know about, if you have anything, you better raise it"

I think they are pretty sure that SCO has nothing, or they wouldn't have
gone public at all. They are being careful, in complete contrast to the
tone and content of SCO's dissertations. All power to them, It's good to
see extreme and desparate actions being countered by good sense and
reason.
