&gt;&gt; Obviously his MS controller attached the strings too tightly that day. Or
&gt;&gt; it could be that his hearing is suffering from too much MS urine being

&gt;
&gt; It's an odd one all right.
&gt;
&gt; I think, when all the smoke and mirrors is stripped away, that SCO's
&gt; complaint is about IBM's withdrawal from Project Monterey.

SCO has two separate issues, apparently.  That's the first one.  The
second is a claim that they have incorporated UnixWare 7 code in the
Linux kernel.

&gt;   Project Monterey had the immediate goal of porting SCO UNIX to
&gt;   IA-64 and the longer term goal of adding enterprise features which
&gt;   existed in AIX to SCO UNIX.  There would be application
&gt;   portability between AIX and SCO UNIX.
&gt;
&gt;   The Project progressed slowly.  Timelines slipped.  Deliverables
&gt;   slipped, leaving the core project of porting SCO UNIX to IA-64.  It
&gt;   has to be asked what IBM got from its participation at this point.
&gt;
&gt;   Linux meanwhile was doing an unrelated IA-64 port, which was somewhat
&gt;   simpler than Project Monterey as Linux was already 64-bit (thanks to
&gt;   the Alpha port).
&gt;
&gt;   As time passes, Linux is taking market share from SCO UNIX.  Linux,
&gt;   not SCO, is now the first choice for people looking for a POSIX-compliant
&gt;   OS for PC platforms.
&gt;
&gt;   Each month that Intel can't ship IA-64 in economic quantity, the
&gt;   less relevance Project Monterey has.
&gt;
&gt;   IBM canned Monterey.  IBM got the Linux religion. AIX 5L got a Linux
&gt;   ABI, not a SCO UNIX ABI.
&gt;
&gt;   SCO hasn't got a 64-bit UNIX.  That is, it has no product for the
&gt;   impending generation of CPUs (slowly impending, but impending all
&gt;   the same).

The complaint against IBM specifically mentioned PPC SMP support.
That doesn't quite tie in with anything to do with ia32.  HP is much
more active with Linux on ia32.

&gt; Now SCO might have a valid contractural bitch here.  It depends upon
&gt; the terms of the joint venture.  Who knows?

It's possible.  Since SCO hasn't revealed what they're really talking
about, just about anything's possible.

&gt; But where exactly in this process Linux and Linux users get dragged
&gt; into a joint venture contract dispute is beyond me.  The Novell and
&gt; Open Group letters point out that SCO don't own any intellectual
&gt; property that's remotely relevant to Linux development.

Rea <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/sco.html.">http://www.lemis.com/grog/sco.html.</A>  It seems that these are two
separate issues.

&gt; At best SCO could show the Project Monterey developed some IA-64
&gt; technologies that were also simultaneously developed Linux's IA-64
&gt; port.  If these technologies were patented that could be a problem.
&gt; But SCO's patent holdings are small.  And a code inspection could
&gt; well show prior art or worse.

I'm pretty sure that IBM has never published ia64-specific code.

&gt; I also suspect that the whole thing has gotten much bigger than SCO
&gt; expected and that IBM, The Open Group, and Novell have called SCO's
&gt; bluff.

I'd strongly guess that SCO wasn't expecting Novell to react like
that.  Steve Ballmer may have done, though.  That would be a nice
conspiracy theory, wouldn't it?

&gt; Bruce Perens claims that the license buy is simply an easy way for
&gt; MS to contribute to SCOs litigation.  If so, I wonder how happy
&gt; Microsoft will be after learning that 95% of the license fee they
&gt; paid to SCO goes to Novell :-)

Heh.
