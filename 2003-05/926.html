Hi Jake,

Other people have had lots of good advice, so I'll restrain
myself to your resume.

  - The most interesting bits of your resume currently
    have the least detail.  Tell more about the software
    projects you have worked upon if you want to do more
    of that work.  How maby lines of code, how many records
    in the database, etc.

  - Show don't tell.  If you work on software then put
    screenshots in your resume.  If there was a sales
    brouchure put this in too.  Put in the positive
    news articles.  For example, put in URLs for
    the pages you did at Oceania.  Your resume should
    be a sales package (because it is).

  - Zap the cover page.  Imagine that no-one reads beyond
    page 2 of your resume unless they are about to hire
    you and want some small talk in the interview.  Having
    page 1 basically empty doesn't help sell yourself.

  - Reorder things to put what the employer wants to know
    first.  So past employers and skills goes before schooling.

  - Employers have no idea what a "TAFE Certificate IV
    Information Technology" is.  You'll need to tell them.
    The TAFE course guide probably has a nice summary.

  - Net Media Solutions needs a lot less explanation.
    You're selling to employers here, they want to hear
    that you're gung-ho and have no life to get their
    project done on time.  Don't disabuse them until
    after you've got the job :-)

  - Put in comments from employers.  I assume you've got
    references after each of your contracts and work experience
    placements.  If not, go and get these now.

  - Zap the "leaving reason".  Employers don't want to here
    that you are going to leave them one day.  Instead just
    incorporate this into the text.  "At my holiday job at the
    Mondello factory I packed and moved 20Kg bags".  As an
    aside, list your employer as the factory, not the temping
    agency which placed you.

  - If you have a good plain-background digital photo handy,
    then put this on the right-hand side of the first page.
    Some people remember faces not names.

  - The programming skills checklist is good.  Take a
    company that wants a "PHP programmer with some C skills".
    They'll start by making a stack of resumes that mention
    PHP and C and discarding the rest.  You made that bit
    easy for them.

    Now they'll want to short-list that stack.  But you haven't
    given them any idea of the level of your PHP skills.  Are
    you "expert", "competent", "have used", etc.  And you haven't
    given them any objective measures to reinforce that opinion.

    Something I find works is

        Programming language    Skill      Accomplishments

                 C             Expert    Co-wrote 20,000 lines of
                                         C code to implement TCP/IP
                                         on IBM-compatible mainframe.

                 Perl         Laughable  Wrote a 150 line program to
                                         strip passwords, it still
                                         doesn't work

    Hmm.  Perhaps I'll just say "written some short utility programs" for
    the second.

    Also list important technologies.  For example

         Apache modules    Expert   Wrote module in C to do access control
                                    based on BGP attributes, such as a
                                    user's ISP.

         OSPF, BGP         Expert   Contributed BGP Looking Glass extensions
                                    to Zebra routing code.
                                    &lt;<A HREF="http://www.zebra.org/&gt">http://www.zebra.org/&gt</A>;

    In you case this might involve aspects of PHP, such as the database
    used.

  - Be concrete in eveything.  There's a few areas of
    vagueness.  Eg: replace "I have been trained in several
    different sections of the company" with "I was trained to
    Flip Hamburgers, Greet Customers, ..."  Basically, some
    employers think you are hiding something bad when being
    vague, so don't do it.

  - Mention small certificates.  Driver's license (stating full or auto),
    first aid certificate, etc.  These won't get you the
    job but they do make people more comfortable in hiring
    you and it's something people forget to ask about at interview.

  - Alter DOB to "Birth date: 11 June 1985, Adelaide" or whatever.
    This addresses the citizenship question for employers which work
    on military projects.

  - If you are in the CFS or Army Reserve or give blood or ... state
    this in the resume. There are two employer reactions to this.
    The ones that place you in the "not" pile you don't want to
    work for anyway.

  - Replace all the abbreviations.  Employers are older than
    you.  Often by a few generations.  They may not have been
    raised in Australia.  They have no idea what "Yr R - 3"
    means.  At least "Reception to Year 3" gives them a fighting
    chance to mentally translate to "Kindergarten to Third Grade"
    if that's what they need to do.

  - "Subjects for future".  Convert this from a list to prose
    (to distinguish what has been done from what you plan to
    do) and make it more concrete.  "Next year I plan to take
    evening classes to obtain a Microsoft Certified Engineer (MSCE)
    certificate".

    At the moment it's not impressive because it's way too long.
    There's at least three years work to do all that list.  It looks
    better to have a concrete short term plan than a wishy-washy
    long-term plan (which isn't to say don't have long term plans,
    but that you don't put everything into a sales pitch).

  - Put an area code on your phone number.  And its a "telephone"
    not a "ph".  "Telephone: (08) 1234 5678".

  - If you've won anything on merit, or have passionate hobby,
    or have written a substantial work then mention that (unless
    it's  controversial).   Employers want to know that they are
    hiring sucessful people.  Don't fret if you don't have
    anything yet, these pile up as the years pass.

  - Some employers will want you to work interstate (either
    fulltime or for periods), or travel, or work long hours
    at critical times [eg: my answer is yes; yes; not on Thursdays].
    Have a position on these.  Mention  them in the resume if
    positive, leave them for the interview if not.

Best of luck,
Glen
