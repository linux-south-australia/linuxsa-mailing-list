&gt;            -- Jack L. Messman, Chairman, President and CEO,

&gt; 
&gt; What bothers me about Novell's letter is that they are as vague in
&gt; refuting SCO's rights as SCO are in providing specific evidence of
&gt; misappropriated IP.  Novell sold UNIX to SCO; there's a contract
&gt; which both of those parties signed; so why can't Novell be certain
&gt; about what rights they sold to SCO, and agbout what interests SCO
&gt; can demonstrate?


If don't think they are vague at all.

They are qualified.  But the qualifications basically
say "as far as we know".  That's reasonable given that
the negotitaions were seven years ago.

Think of it as "we've looked at our paperwork and it
says... but perhaps you've got another piece of
paperwork that we haven't archived properly".
