Ok, to clear this up. The Windows2k PDC logs show that the samba server has failed an authentication test as a standard "Invalid uid and or password" according the the logs - this happends aprox every 30 seconds. Im trying to figure out why this is when the samba server is only sharing files and printers.

My first assumption is that one of hundreds of windows2k clients is the cause of the problem. I think this because smbstatus sometimes shows IPC$ sessions as 'nobody' coming from machine A while at the same time showing valid sessions as a valid domain user from the same machine A. 

The logs only show these errors from samba, not the windows2k clients. 

The samba config relavent to this is:
&gt; &gt;    security = server
&gt; &gt;    password server = NTMachine
&gt; &gt;    encrypt passwords = yes

But i can show more if you need it. From here i need to know what questions to ask as im a little lost as to the cause of the error logs.

I hope this clears this up a little :)

Thanks for the help so far.
AG.

&gt; What was the authentication-related error message you were getting
&gt; again? It's possible that some user somewhere has an invalid 
&gt; (as far as
&gt; the unix box and NTMachine are concerned) username/password 
&gt; pair cached
&gt; in their NT logon session and it's being tried before a legitimate
&gt; account each time some authentication stuff is happening.
&gt; 
&gt; Is the user of the machine that's making these failed authentication
&gt; requests complaining of some kind of problems?
&gt; 
&gt; thx,
