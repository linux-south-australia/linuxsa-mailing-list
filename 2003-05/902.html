Hi.

Richard Russell said:

&gt;
&gt;&gt; And there is the root of the problem. Whole ranges are
&gt;&gt; excluded because of the number of spammers using dialup and
&gt;&gt; or parked in that IP range. This is just the world protecting
&gt;&gt; itself from junkmail. Do you really want to have to go into
&gt;&gt; battle every time someone decides to improve the
&gt;&gt; signal-to-noise ratio on their mail system?
&gt;
&gt; No, I do not. Hence my attempts to find out the source of this mindless
&gt; blocking, rather than the individual mailserver admins.

Fair enough. It's a good cause, to distinguish yellowgoanna.com from the
seething masses of spammers in your IP range. If you have the time, go for
it. :)
I agree with your position, (yellowgoanna.com is good, don't add it to the
RBL), but you might need to make a lot of noise to make it happen, only to
see some other blacklist pick up the whole subnet and your problems start
over.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Use smarthost to your isp is the simple answer. Is there some
&gt;&gt; reason why you cannot do that? Michael
&gt;
&gt; Because if I do so, then any mail that gets stuck for some reason (eg
&gt; other mailserver down) gets queued there rather than here. I'd rather
&gt; be able to discover this, fix the problem, and nudge the mailqueue
&gt; myself. I run my own mailserver for a reason. I also do not see why
&gt; braindead spam-blocking should block good servers, and see this as a
&gt; problem of the spam blocking, not of my mail setup.

Yes (but) if the other mailserver is down, it doesn't matter if the mail
sits in your queue or the ISP's queue. It will either eventually get
through, or bounce.
'Braindead' spamblocking is all we really have, because (big picture)
there is no end-to-end authentication between all the parties involved in
mail transport. Welcome to the Matri^H^H^H^H^HInternet... :)
If we knew for sure that the sender of the email was authenticated and
traceable, spam control would be a simpler case of verification of
credentials, and the problem would not be the issue it is today.
Anyway, I understand your reasons, I'll stop telling you to smarthost now,
except to say that if you would like a simpler life, there are time and
energy savings to be had...

Saw Trinity using nmap today...


Regards,

Michael
