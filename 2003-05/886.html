&gt; &gt;I need work, im 17 well skilled in IT (check resume) and ready

&gt; &gt;Ive been offered several trainiships so far, but as always 
&gt; &gt;there is no training just cheap labour.
&gt; 
&gt; My advice would be to take up one of the traineeships that you're
&gt; being offered.  At 17 I would regard that as your best chance to
&gt; get into the industry, as a traineeship will offer you both educational
&gt; and vocational qualifications, even if you regard it as "cheap labour".  
&gt; Take any opportunity you can get, you'll be surprised where it can lead, 
&gt; if, as you say, you are well skilled in IT and ready to learn more...
&gt; 
&gt; PS If you think that advice sucks, that's fine, but at 17 I was in a 
&gt; similar position and took up a traineeship in IT, only 6 years ago.
&gt; That year of "cheap labour" was the stepping stone to where I am right now,
&gt; managing IT for a regional health service...

This piece of advice is even more meaningful in today's environment. 
Unemployment is way up, so employers are being bombarded with lots of 
resumes. We [1] are looking for a CIFS person right now and we can be very 
selective, while two years ago we would have had to take what we could get 
and pay heaps for it.

Also, at 17, you probably have some time on your hands, so I would suggest 
that you get into some of the open source code around. Get to know it, add 
improvements or fix bugs in it. You never know, in two or three years, 
when things improve a great deal, that might be your ticket to something 
big. However, you really might want to consider the importance of the 
right piece of paper as well.
