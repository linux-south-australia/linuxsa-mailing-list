I dispute "a fine job" when "he has crazy spam filtering."  Blocklisting
large parts of Australia on the basis that they are large parts of
Australia certainly is crazy, and that sort of thing will come back and
bite you.

&gt; If u cant get through yell and scream here i guess =) or email me at
&gt; my alternate school/tafe email - <A HREF="mailto:jpress@olc.sa.edu.au">jpress@olc.sa.edu.au</A>

For example, if you were conversing with a business and their email to
you bounced as 'spam' they may well just not bother contacting you again.
Probably it'd be your loss, and you might well think about this point
because it's not at all unlikely.

&gt; Kevin is a mate of mine and gives me hosting/mail for free, so i don't
&gt; complain and i cant afford anything else anyway.

Can you really afford to make yourself unavailable to Australian businesses?


&gt; Oceania is excellent hosting btw.

Disputable.  See first comment.
