&gt;  &gt; So I see a simple solution to the problem of 802.11 units being programmed
&gt;  &gt; to go out of band:
&gt;  &gt; -	Only sell these units to people with licences.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah.  You must mean this license, right?

&gt; 
&gt; (note that anyone can buy any radio they want, whether or not they have
&gt; a license.  it's operating that radio that requires the license)

Mark,

They say this:

"Class licences do not have to be applied for, and no licence fees are payable."

on this web page:
<A HREF="http://www.aca.gov.au/aca_home/publications/reports/info/spreadsp.htm">http://www.aca.gov.au/aca_home/publications/reports/info/spreadsp.htm</A>

My point - minus the frivolity - is that purchasers of 802.11 transceivers
should be made to sign a little document which says that they
understand that they're not allowed to fiddle with the frequencies.

If you buy a hunting gun, you have to sign a piece of paper which says,
by implication, that if you shoot pigeons in Victoria Square, the local
constabulary will take umbrage.

There seems to have been this shift in Australian licensing away
from licensing people and towards licensing equipment.
One very annoying example was that in the late 1980s and through the 1990s,
and mabe still now, cheap modems made for the USA were verboten in
Australia because they just _might_ be used in a reckless manner,
like to answer a phone in less than 2 rings or to send some pulses
with duration in error by a few milliseconds for Telstra's liking.
Therefore a handheld PC I bought in 1997 had the modem ripped out
of it for the Australian version because it was too costly to get
the licence for the _equipment_.

Now with the 802.11 frequencies that Glen's talking about, it seems
like there's a piece of equipment which has been allowed into
Australia without being gelded for Australian use.
Therefore the "licence the equipment" ideology has failed to
stop some equipment getting into Oz which could potentially be fiddled with.
I'm really amazed that modems can't be permitted into Oz with
minor capabilites for "unauthorized use" whereas 802.11 units
which can disrupt comms are okay.

Surely getting a purchaser to just sign that they understand that
they're not allowed to fiddle with frequency registers is a small
overhead compared to getting equipment licensed in the first place.
The alternative is to require 802.11 gear to be specially gelded
for "Australian conditions".

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
