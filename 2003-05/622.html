&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any recent experience of using 2 or more monitors

&gt; 
&gt; The xfree specs allow for up to 8 billion virtual desktops.

Er... why?

&gt; I have 3 video
&gt; cards but the minimum requirement AFAIK is 2. One has to be AGP and the
&gt; other PCI.

That sounds interesting... how do you control which one the computer
uses during the BIOS part of the boot sequence?

My situation is a bit different: I currently have a PCI video card
which fulfils all my needs perfectly well with the sole exception of
providing reasonable performance in MS Train Sim. I am about to
install an AGP video card to solve this problem.

Unfortunately, the new card won't be supported by svgatextmode, which
is a pain, as I don't want to lose my 100x36 text consoles in Linux.
So what would be really useful would be if I could have both cards
installed, and have Linux boot using the PCI card but Windoze boot
using the AGP one. (I have one monitor, which I would plug into either
card as necessary.)

The long term fix is to hack svgatextmode to support the new card,
which seems to involve either pulling apart the source code for the X
drivers or registering as an ATI developer to get hold of the Radeon
7500 data sheet. I am pursuing both routes, but it may take some time.

In the meantime, if you could give any hints on booting with different
video cards, it would be much appreciated.

&gt; The really cool way to use xinerama is with vmware running windows. Then
&gt; you can have the left monitor for example running vmware windows in full
&gt; screen mode and linux on the right monitor, with the mouse moving
&gt; seamlessly between the two operating systems. Lots of fun!  ;-P

That would be SO COOL... MS Train Sim won't run in wine. You don't
happen to know where I can get a secondhand copy of vmware? :-)
