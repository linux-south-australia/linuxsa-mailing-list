&gt;&gt; Having a look at their recent financials shows SCO being owned by...the

&gt;&gt; But who owns the canopy group....?  The web site doesn't say AFAIK.
&gt;
&gt; Somewhere I read that MS sometimes forms companies simply for
&gt; the purpose of purchasing other companies cheaply.

FWIW, a couple of points:

1.  Microsoft used to have a controlling interest in SCO about 20
    years ago.  In 1980, SCO's main project was developing Microsoft's
    operating system, which as everybody knows was called XENIX.

2.  I recently saw a claim on another mailing list that Microsoft
    still has a significant interest in SCO.  I asked for details and
    got this rather cryptic reply:

      Just go to www.nasdaq.com, Quotes+, Stock report (SCOX), play
      around and find that Microsoft has 3800000 stocks SCO.

    Well, I did that and got
    <A HREF="http://holdings.nasdaq.com/asp/Institutional.asp?CIK">http://holdings.nasdaq.com/asp/Institutional.asp?CIK</A>=&HolderName=&LinesPerPage=5&PageNum=1&SortBy=&Descending=&strFilter=&site=nasdaq&symbol=SCOX&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&FormType=INSTITUTIONAL&Selected=SCOX&market=Nasdaq-SCM&coname=Caldera+International%2C+Inc%2E&LogoPath=http%3A%2F%2Fa676%2Eg%2Eakamaitech%2Enet%2Ff%2F676%2F838%2F1h%2Fnasdaq%2Ecom%2Flogos%2FSCOX%2EGIF&pageName=Holdings+Summary,
    which made no mention of Microsoft.  If anybody else can find
    a link, I'd be interested to hear about it.

&gt; The idea is that if a company knew that MS was trying to buy them,
&gt; they would ask for more money. So buying anonymously keeps prices
&gt; down. It's entirely credible that MS would have done that in this
&gt; case and then continued to keep it quiet after the purchase, for
&gt; obvious reasons.

Take a look at <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/sco.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/sco.html</A> (near the bottom)
for information on what this business is doing to SCO's stock.  I
don't think this theory can hold water.

&gt; Since MS is purportedly in the habit of setting up companies for the
&gt; purposes of anonymous purchase, it's a small step to then use this
&gt; trick to anonymously attack linux.

That's a completely separate issue.
