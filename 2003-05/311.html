Our small office has recently had the need to replace our old 
photocopier with a new one, so we traded in our old Konica photocopier 
for a newer Konia 7035 multifuctional. In general, multifunctionals can 
print, scan, send faxes, and print.


So, the question that comes to mind is:


****How well are multifunctionals supported in Unix[1]? What do I gain 
or loose by using it in Unix vs Windows 2000?****


*********Konica 7035 *****************

On the Konica, the answer is not much.

There are available generic print drivers in SuSE 8.2 and these work ok, 
but not as well as the Windows version. Further and as per usual, the 
unix drivers are buried on a web page found by search engine, and the IT 
person accompanying the sales person, does not offer software or drivers 
that are for Linux.

So, in this situation,  we really did not lack anything in the way of 
features as a result of our choice of operating system. However, it was 
more difficult to set up. The Unix drivers were buried in the site, and 
I had to find them via search engine, rather than going to the regular 
support section. I also did not find the drivers functional or useful at 
all, whereas for Windows 2000, I did.

Not much to do with the Unix support provided, we weren't quite 
satisfied with the Konica and had the Richoe/Gestetner salesman bring in 
his machine.


**************Gestetner 2212*****************************

There is a lot lost by not using this with Windows 2000, and all of 
these features are additional to the Konica.


This machine has some neat features, only suppoerted under Windows.  (At 
least as of now!):

1. You can scan a document and it will be delivered to your desktop as a PDF
2. You can send faxes out from your desk


***************The Question********************

Any way to reverse engineer the features provided by the Gestetner below 
without making it my life's work? :-\

Not having software for multifunctionals is perhaps one of the major 
reasons why Windows 2000 servers might be favored over Unix companions 
in some situations.  

However, I am too bloody stubborn for that. :-)  
So _Dammit_, I want to do this in Linux and not have to spend 3 days 
figuring it out.


*********************Clues**********************

I was also told that server for fax and scan delivery would only work if 
a Windows 2000 workstation acted as a server.  The program created its 
own name independent of my Windows 2000 computer name, it was localhost, 
I am James in mdkgroup.  The Windows 2000 server has to be running the 
scan router service, and then I am supposed to set up each person on the 
lan as a user in the program/server localhost and then go to each desk 
and install a client. I asked the salesman to see if, by their 
perception, cash paying Unix customers were supported..."surely you 
support SCO or Sun Solaris" I asked. "No", they replied.

Seeing as how I have a Samba server, I don't see why I wouldn't be able 
to use my server, as a server. After all, it is a server and my 
workstation, is a workstation.   
And I don't even use Windows 2000 that often, and our office dual boots, 
so it makes no sense to make a workstation a server.

They say that TCP/IP is supported by the machine, along with IPX, & 
Netbios. They throw SMB in there too.

So, I got bold, and I used Ethereal to packet sniff network traffic when 
a scan was sent from the printer to Windows.

I don't know how to read the dump, but here are some highlights

Ethernet II
Source (Richoe)
Destimation (James)
Type IP (0x0800)
Internet Protocol v4
Header  Length 20 bytes
Differentiated Services Field 0x10 (DSCP 0x04: Unknown DSCP; ECN:0x00)
0001 00..=Differentiated Services Codepoint: Unknown (0x04)
.... ..0. = ECN-Capable Transport (ECT): 0
.... ...0 = ECN-CE: 0
(more)
Src Port 1035
Dest Port 3670

So I went to IANA to see what these ports are:

mxxrlogin 1035/tcp MX-XR RPC
mxxrlogin 1035/udp MX-XR RPC
# Arnold E. Mauer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:amauer@vrms.com">amauer@vrms.com</A>&gt; April 2003

Smile 3670/tcp SMILE TCP/UDP Interface
smile 3670/udp SMILE TCP/UDP Interface
# Andre Petras &lt;<A HREF="mailto:A_Petras@web.de">A_Petras@web.de</A>&gt; January 2003

And then nothing made sense to me after this. :-(

I thought I saw 1035 some where, but all the article talks about are 
trojans and such.
Port 3670 seemed to be about graphics.

 Will I be able to escape the grips of the evil empire...stay tuned!

[1]Linux is in the same boat as Unix, so I just call it Unix here.
