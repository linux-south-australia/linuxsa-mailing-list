Mike,

&gt; Would we not all be better off snail-mailing our representatives
&gt; asking them politely to support the Bill?

I'm not sure how you get from what I said, to:

&gt; Instead of bitching about the wording and complaining that one of the 
&gt; major parties is not introducing it, how about we all get behind it
&gt; and show some support, so it has a chance of passing?

I said "Maybe LinuxSA should enter a submission" but then pointed out
that it cannot because it's not a legal entity. There's been advice
about this in the past (search for lawyer or solictor and Glen Turner).

 a) I didn't say I didn't support the bill
 b) I didn't say I didn't think it was a good idea
 c) I didn't even say anything unconstructive

And I certainly didn's complain about the fact that a party which
doesn't hold the majority in Government that is currently unable to form
a majority in the lower house happens to be game enough to introduce
such a worthy bill...
