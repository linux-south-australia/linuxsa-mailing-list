&gt;&gt;He seems to have entered the scene from caldera, and be right behind

&gt;
&gt;After more thinking and reading, I guess this statement is unfounded. He
&gt;could have joined caldera after first being part of canopy.
&gt;
&gt;I still think the most plausable answer so far is that he stands to gain
&gt;the most from the sco share price rise that seems to have been initiated
&gt;by this legal battle. Since he seems to invest in so many things,
&gt;perhaps this is merely the best way he sees to make profit from his sco
&gt;shares, and the movement is driven by money? It certainly wouldnt be the
&gt;first time this type of thing has happened! 
&gt;
&gt;Surely if microsoft were behind it, someone would have turned up some
&gt;evidence by now which would have spread through the linux community in
&gt;an instant!

Mr. Yarro is also an owner of Altaris:

I don't know much about Altaris.
