Hey

	The mail server isn't administrated by me, Kevin runs it.
	He does a fine job of it too. Although he has crazy spam 		filtering - its his server and he can do what he likes.
	If u cant get through yell and scream here i guess =) or email 		me at my alternate school/tafe email - <A HREF="mailto:jpress@olc.sa.edu.au">jpress@olc.sa.edu.au</A>
	Kevin is a mate of mine and gives me hosting/mail for free, so i 	don't complain and i cant afford anything else anyway.
	Oceania is excellent hosting btw.

	Also David, you asked me too send you that email direct too you, 	and then u paste it back too the list? lol 
	I replied again direct.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Due to the gross amount of spam coming from that block.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;But, but, surely that doesn't mean blocking mail from decent folks? Is 
&gt; &gt;&gt;that a 'right' thing to do? 
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Is there anything I can do - my ISP can do so - we are not labeled 
&gt; &gt;&gt;"spammers"?
&gt; &gt;&gt;    
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would be very happy to find a better solution, and I am currently working
&gt; &gt;on one, but it rather involves a dns lookup for each mail, but does seem 
&gt; &gt;more effective. I have removed the 202.* ban and replaced it with a more
&gt; &gt;'sane' block. If I continue to get too much spam from that block, it will
&gt; &gt;go back on. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Also realize, more and more spam is originating here in .au and as such
&gt; &gt;I have many .au domains on my block list.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Kind regards
&gt; &gt;Kevin
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I am just thinking about a system that...who knows... maybe it will 
&gt; work, maybe it won't...probably won't go anywhere, but what the 
&gt; heck....its an idea.
&gt; I have no idea who would have the authority to impliment the 
&gt; system.....but maybe a trusted key protocol can be created between ISP's.  
&gt; 
&gt; The  protocol would basically be an agreement between the ISP and I 
&gt; suppose other ISP's [the group Kevin W(1) is with] that if one ISP sent 
&gt; above a certain % of spam, they will be blocked for a certain time. The 
&gt; blocker would have to notify the blockee ISP and the blockee ISP would 
&gt; notify its customers. Or maybe screen customers.... :-)
&gt; 
&gt; But for the system to work, I guess there would have to be "judges" to 
&gt; be sure that unfair practices are not encouraged as a result.
&gt; 
&gt; But then again, I start thinging about free speach issues....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well that's my try...

&gt; 
&gt; (1) My apologies Keven, I am just not too savy on who is who in making 
&gt; the mail arrive...
