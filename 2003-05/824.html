&gt; I've been deciding on either a Dell Latitude D600 or Thinkpad T40 since
&gt; March. I've put off the purchase until the next Pentium M price drop on
&gt; the first week of June and the current Australian dollar comes into
&gt; effect.

I got sent the Dell Latitude D600 (my work has a policy of not
running out-of-service machines and I had to argue really hard
to convince them to wait until the Pentium M machines arrived).

Red Hat Linux 9 installed with no drama.  I wouldn't consider
an earlier version as the Broadcom 10/1000/1000 interface
was dodgy under RHL7.*.

The remaining device support is variable

  - IrDA might work (I haven't put time into this)

  - 802.11 doesn't work.  Neither the "Centrino" (really
    a Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 LAN MiniPCI adapter) or
    the "Dell TrueMobile" (really a selection from
    the Broadcom range) have drivers.

  - Bluetooth works.

  - The modem is a Conexant HSF soft modem.  There are
    third-party drivers with source, which work.  Only
    downside is to remember to recompile them after a
    kernel upgrade.  So keep the sources handy on disk.

  - The smart card doesn't work.  It's a new chip and
    there's no driver.  (This sucks, as when it works
    you could encrypt the disk using a key from the
    smartcard.  So noone could access your data as
    long as you had the smartcard in your pocket.)

  - PCMCIA works (it's run from the same chip as the
    smart card, but the chip emulates a popular PCMCIA
    bridge.  No idea why they didn't emulate a popular
    SmartCard driver too.)

  - USB2 works.  Interop with USB1.2 devices is fine.

  - Graphics works, and configured correctly during install
    if "Generic panel 1400x..." selected.  Acceleration
    works.  Sub-pixel font hinting works -- pixel order
    is RGB horizontally.  The screen is 125 dots per inch.

  - The Panel/VGA port keystroke offers display on the
    laptop panel or display on the VGA port.  But not
    both.  Arrrrrgh.  Possibly a X configuration?????

  - Sound works, and correctly detected and configured in
    installation.

  - CPU power minimisation features don't work.  Kernel 2.5
    should do this.

  - The BIOS doesn't do APM and RHL9 doesn't do ACPI.  So
    no suspend or automatic switch-off.  Apparently (on the
    web, not confirmed by me) recompiling the kernel with
    ACPI just reveals bugs in the Dell BIOS.

  - There are no FireWire ports.  So you can't grab images
    from a video camera.

  - The port expander power supply and the laptop power
    supply look identical.  But they are not.  Label them
    as you take them out of the box.

  - The CD/DVD can be replaced by a battery pack.  Which
    is nice.  The hefty 8-cell D800 battery won't fit
    in the slot for the 6-cell battery on the D600 :-(

  - The port expander doesn't have a microphone port.
    Unlike the CPort/2 it doesn't have a ethernet chip,
    so the MAC address when undocked and docked is the
    same.  The port expander has five USB ports, but
    still has RS-232, Centronics, and two PS/2 ports.

  - The BIOS will boot from USB flash memory.  So there's
    no need to buy the USB floppy drive.

  - The disk works.  I got the faster but smaller drive.
    You might not want to do this, as faster drives use
    a lot more power.  The IDE bus seems to be ATA-100,
    so booting with "idebus=100" should give some performance
    win.  I used hdparm -i /dev/hda to query the capabilities
    of the drive and then set these in /etc/sysconfig/harddisk.

  - ext3 filesystem uses a lot more power then ext2 filesystem.
    Even after I set the "noatime" mount parameter.

There's been some complaints on the web about the keyboard
touching the screen when closed (which is does) and damaging
the screen (which it hasn't on mine).  It's probably something
to check closely just before warranty expiry.

The Windows XP disks are for *reinstalling* Windows.  They don't
appear to want to install under VMWare.  I'm told the EULA
to XP says that you need to buy an extra license for each
concurrent VM.  Since this is outrageiusly uneconomic
this is a Linux-only notebook.

I haven't tried multiple boot partitions (as my main
use for Windows is cut-and-paste screen shots when writing
documentation so using a VM is a much better option).

The *really* irritating thing is that manufacturers won't
send data sheets so I can write drivers.  Hassling our
Dell rep big-time about this.  Not supporting Linux is
fine by me, not having a technical documentation set
sucks.
