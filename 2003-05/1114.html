Novell's media release follows.


Defending its interests in developing services to operate on the Linux
platform, Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL) today issued a dual challenge to The
SCO Group over its recent statements regarding its UNIX ownership and
potential intellectual property rights claims over Linux.

First, Novell challenged SCO's assertion that it owns the copyrights
and patents to UNIX System V, pointing out that the asset purchase
agreement entered into between Novell and SCO in 1995 did not transfer
these rights to SCO. Second, Novell sought from SCO facts to back up
its assertion that certain UNIX System V code has been copied into
Linux. Novell communicated these concerns to SCO via a letter (text
below) from Novell(R) Chairman and CEO Jack Messman in response to SCO
making these claims.

"To Novell's knowledge, the 1995 agreement governing SCO's purchase of
UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated copyrights,"
Messman said in the letter. "We believe it unlikely that SCO can
demonstrate that it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those
copyrights. Apparently you share this view, since over the last few
months you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to
SCO, requests that Novell has rejected."

"SCO claims it has specific evidence supporting its allegations
against the Linux community," Messman added. "It is time to
substantiate that claim, or recant the sweeping and unsupported
allegation made in your letter. Absent such action, it will be
apparent to all that SCO's true intent is to sow fear, uncertainty,
and doubt about Linux in order to extort payments from Linux
distributors and users."

"Novell has answered the call of the open source community," said
Bruce Perens, a leading proponent of open source. "We admire what they
are doing. Based on recent announcements to support Linux with NetWare
services and now this revelation ... Novell has just won the hearts
and minds of developers and corporations alike."

Text of the letter from Novell to SCO:

      Mr. Darl McBride
      President and CEO
      The SCO Group

      Re:  SCO's "Letter to Linux Customers"

      Dear Darl:

     As you know, Novell recently announced some important Linux
     initiatives.  These include an upcoming NetWare version based on
     the Linux kernel, as well as collaboration and resource management
     solutions for Linux.

     Put simply, Novell is an ardent supporter of Linux and the open
     source development community.  This support will increase over
     time.

     It was in this context that we recently received your "Letter to
     Linux Customers."  Many Novell business partners and customers
     apparently received the same letter.  Your letter compels a
     response from Novell.

     As we understand the letter, SCO alleges that unnamed entities
     incorporated SCO's intellectual property into Linux without its
     authorization.  You apparently base this allegation on a belief
     that these unnamed entities copied some UNIX System V code into
     Linux.  Beyond this limited understanding, we have been unable to
     glean any further information about your allegation because of
     your letter's vagueness.

     In particular, the letter leaves certain critical questions
     unanswered.  What specific code was copied from UNIX System V?
     Where can we find this code in Linux?  Who copied this code?  Why
     does this alleged copying infringe SCO's intellectual property?
     By failing to address these important questions, SCO has failed to
     put us on meaningful notice of any allegedly infringing Linux
     code, and thus has withheld from us the ability -- and removed any
     corresponding obligation -- to address your allegation.

     As best we can determine, the vagueness about your allegation is
     intentional.  In response to industry demands that you be more
     specific, you attempt to justify your vagueness by stating,
     "That's like saying, 'show us the fingerprints on the gun so you
     can rub them off.'"  (Wall Street Journal, May 19, 2003) Your
     analogy is weak and inappropriate.  Linux has existed for over a
     decade, and there are plenty of copies in the marketplace with
     which SCO could attempt to prove its allegation.

     We are aware that you recently offered to disclose some of the
     alleged Linux problems to Novell and others under a nondisclosure
     agreement.  If your offer is sincere, it may be a step in the
     right direction.  But we wonder whether the terms of the
     nondisclosure agreement will allow Novell and others in the Linux
     community to replace any offending code.  Specifically, how can we
     maintain the confidentiality of the disclosure if it is to serve
     as the basis for modifying an open source product such as Linux?
     And if we cannot use the confidential disclosure to modify Linux,
     what purpose does it serve?

     In your letter, you analogize SCO's campaign against the Linux
     community to that of the record industry against major
     corporations whose servers contained downloaded music files.
     There are crucial differences between the two campaigns.  The
     record industry has provided specific information to back up its
     allegation, while SCO steadfastly refuses to do so.  In its
     allegation letter, the record industry provides evidence of
     allegedly infringing activity that is specific to the targeted
     company.  This offers the company real notice of the activity,
     sufficient information to evaluate the allegation, and an
     opportunity to stop the activity if it determines the allegation
     is true.  If SCO wants to compare its actions to those of the
     record industry, it should follow the example set by that industry
     and present specific evidence of the alleged infringement.

     SCO claims it has specific evidence supporting its allegation
     against the Linux community.  It is time to substantiate that
     claim, or recant the sweeping and unsupported allegation made in
     your letter.  Absent such action, it will be apparent to all that
     SCO's true intent is to sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt about
     Linux in order to extort payments from Linux distributors and
     users.

     This true intent becomes clearer when one considers various public
     statements you and other SCO personnel have made about SCO's
     intellectual property rights in UNIX.  SCO continues to say that
     it owns the UNIX System V patents, yet it must know that it does
     not.  A simple review of U.S. Patent Office records reveals that
     Novell owns those patents.

     Importantly, and contrary to SCO's assertions, SCO is not the
     owner of the UNIX copyrights.  Not only would a quick check of
     U.S. Copyright Office records reveal this fact, but a review of
     the asset transfer agreement between Novell and SCO confirms it.
     To Novell's knowledge, the 1995 agreement governing SCO's purchase
     of UNIX from Novell does not convey to SCO the associated
     copyrights.  We believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that
     it has any ownership interest whatsoever in those copyrights.
     Apparently, you share this view, since over the last few months
     you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to
     SCO, requests that Novell has rejected.  Finally, we find it
     telling that SCO failed to assert a claim for copyright or patent
     infringement against IBM.

     SCO's actions are disrupting business relations that might
     otherwise form at a critical time among partners around Linux
     technologies, and are depriving these partners of important
     economic opportunities.  We hope you understand the potential
     significant legal liability SCO faces for the possible harm it is
     causing to countless customers, developers, and other Linux
     community members.  SCO's actions, if carried forward, will lead
     to the loss of sales and jobs, delayed projects, canceled
     financing, and a balkanized Linux community.

     We, like others, are concerned about the direction of SCO's
     campaign.  For now, we demand that SCO either promptly state its
     Linux infringement allegations with specificity or recant the
     accusation made in your letter.  Further, we demand that SCO
     retract its false and unsupported assertions of ownership in UNIX
     patents and copyrights or provide us with conclusive information
     regarding SCO's ownership claims.  In the future, we hope SCO will
     adhere to standards of strict accuracy when stating its rights in
     UNIX.

      Sincerely,
      Jack L. Messman
      Chairman, President and CEO
