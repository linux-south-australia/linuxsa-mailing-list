&gt; Several years ago, I read a little article about a company that was
&gt; seemingly being successful in producing clear, multi-layered compact
&gt; discs that could hold anything up to 100GB. The company was called
&gt; Constellation 3D. Wired News have an interesting background article[1]
&gt; on the company.

&gt; Recently, I had cause to start investigating them again. For a
&gt; spit-second, I thought there was something wrong with my Internet
&gt; connection, as the company's website, <A HREF="http://www.c-3d.net/">http://www.c-3d.net/</A> didn't want
&gt; to load.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I found some more information[2] today that states that the
&gt; company filed for bankruptcy in December of last year.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a little surprised that they went under in some ways (and not, in
&gt; others), due to the fact that they seemed to have some rather
&gt; remarkable technology in their possesion.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what's happening with the technology, or have any
&gt; background on the "how's" and "why's" of their demise?
&gt; 
I'd completely forgotten about this technology. Indeed remarkable that
none of the major companies like Sony & Matsushita didn't snap it up.

Pure speculation,but...

Maybe there's too much money already invested in DVD technology by these
companies, & so development would annul any return on these investments.

Perhaps the majors couldn't agree on a suitable licensing system. I
remember reading somewhere that C3D were in negotiations with Lite-On
whereby Lite-On would pay a licensing fee for every FMD-Rom drive they
produced to use the technology. I've yet to see Lite-On produce even one
of these drives.

Whatever the reasons, it amounts to a crying shame.
I like the idea of the technology being introduced into hard drive
platters. At a starting point of 100GB per disc (50GB per side), & an
average of 8 platters in most HD's these days, that would be a fantastic
800GB hard drive.

I live in hope that some day one company will pick up on this.

Regards,
Rick
