&gt;&gt;Interesting. One thing im confused about though with this whole saga.
&gt;&gt;Didnt caldera opensource unix to stop this kind of stuff from happening?
&gt;&gt;Arnt sco caldera now anyway? 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Caldera did buy SCO, and changed their name back and forth a few times,
&gt; but they didn't open source unix.  They did it because, I suppose,
&gt; they figured owning unix would give them a better chance of surviving.
&gt; Unfortunately, or perhaps just because they need the money, they also
&gt; seem to have bought SCO's legal team.  No real surprise.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I find this an interesting (and perhaps accurate) comment from the article:
&gt; 
&gt;    ``"This shows one of the weaknesses of the open-source movement,"
&gt;    said Mark Radcliffe, a copyright attorney with Gray Cary. "You're
&gt;    all dependent on trust. Unfortunately, a number of people involved
&gt;    in the process do not have a great degree of respect for intellectual
&gt;    property. It's fine if it's personal, but if you decide to implement
&gt;    that by saying I don't give a damn about this intellectual property,
&gt;    everything that touches it is now screwed."''
&gt; 

yeah, intellectual property is a cancer, man. it infects everything it 
touches. as soon as you release one part of an application under 
intellectual property, you have to, um, intellectual propertise, all of 
it. if you even look at the intellectual property of something else you 
have to. you have to wear lead glasses or something, i don't know. maybe 
if you read something with another application that has some 
intellectual property associated with it, you have to do it with all of 
it. or something. whatever, it's bad, ok?
