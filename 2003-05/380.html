David,

Their stratum 2 page lists ntp.adelaide.edu.au as being discontinued,
but it's still been working for me for the last 12 months.
They (eecis.udel) used to list a tictoc.csiro NTP server - and so did I on one
of my web pages, but then some guy at CSIRO asked me to remove the
link because they were discontinuing their server.

Therefore it seems like you can't really go by what you read in
these lists much.

By the way, what is the relative load of a continuous NTP synchronization
between two hosts compared with a 4-times-a-day sync with /usr/sbin/ntpdate
(which is what I do in cron)? Do NTP server operators get peeved at
the load on their servers? What about the traffic load?

A related issue is running /sbin/hwclock regularly to sync the hardware clock.
I guess that would be less important if you have NTP running from just
after boot - well not much. But I think it's important to combine
NTP sync with hardware clock sync (via cron in my case).

Have I got the right ideas on this, or is there a more modern way to do it?
It's difficult to keep up with the times these days...


Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
