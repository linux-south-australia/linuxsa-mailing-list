 Crashed Computer Traps Thai Politician:

 Thailand's Finance Minister Suchart Jaovisidha had to be
 rescued today from inside his expensive BMW limousine after
 the onboard computer crashed, leaving the vehicle
 immobilized. Once the computer failed, neither the door
 locks, power windows nor air conditioning systems would
 function, leaving the Minister and his driver trapped inside
 the rapidly heating vehicle. 

 Despite the pair's best efforts, it took a full ten minutes
 before they were able to summon the attention of a nearby
 guard who freed the two men by smashing one of the vehicle's
 windows with a sledgehammer. 

 A report published in the Bangkok Post indicates that the
 vehicle was Mr Jaovisidha's own BMW 520 which was being used
 while his state-supplied Mercedes, was being repaired. 

 BMW's more up-market 7-series range uses a computer system
 called i-drive which has Microsoft's WindowsCE at its core. 

 Did Mr Jaovisidha narrowly miss being killed by the blue
 windscreen of death? 


Cheers,  Ian
