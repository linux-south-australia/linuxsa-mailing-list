&gt; Ok, I am a bit annoyed. :-(  I need to know how to get IMAP to run in 
&gt; SSL so I can use Squirrelmail.

I'm not entirely sure why you need SSL to use squirrelmail. If
squirrelmail is running on the same host as IMAP (which it smells like
it is...), then there is no security hazzard in allowing them to talk to
each other in plaintext (as all traffic is local, no-one can sniff it).

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Luckily I was able to glean that I had to install UW Imap 
&gt; server from this, so after I installed the RPM for that, I 
&gt; tried to log in, and I got this message:

I *think* squirrelmail will also run with POP, and it certainly works
with non-UW IMAP servers... I use it with Courier-IMAP.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; nmap 192.168.5.66

If you run IMAP on localhost only, then squirrelmail will still be able
to connect, and you will avoid any security hassles from external
connections.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Login Disabled...who the heck did that? I didn't!

It's probably in the imap config somewhere. Two possibilities -- try
using the SSL port (993) instead (ah, I see you did that later...), or
try disabling TLS. Note that SSL isn't plain text, so you can't do it
manually unless you have a crypto module in your brain. Try using a
simple client like pine, and remove squirrelmail from the list of
possible error sources.

&lt;snip&gt;


&gt; I try to telnet to port 993, no response. I try the web browser on 
&gt; https:, no response.

https is not imaps. https is port 443, and is http over ssl, and imap is
port 993, and is imap over ssl.

Is your IMAP server listening on port 993? (try 'netstat -anp --inet |
grep LIST') Is your packet filtering blocking it?

&gt; 
&gt; And where is the bloddy /etc/imap.conf file that allows me to 
&gt; specify this?

NFI. I don't use UW IMAP. Does a RPM query list the files included in
the package? Is there a configgy looking file there? 

&gt; 
&gt; I have piles of print outs two inches thick from google searches, etc.

You do realise you can view them on screen? ;)

&gt; 
&gt; ************************************************************
&gt; 
&gt; Computing should not be this difficult.
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, no where in the documentation do I find 
&gt; anything of this 
&gt; nature at Squirrelmail to warn me.

"this nature"? I'm not entirely sure where your problem lies...

&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, I am _lucky_ that I guessed that it was IMAP and not 
&gt; Squirrelmail. What's there to differentiate to the average user, that 
&gt; its not a squirrel mail problem?

I think squirrelmail has a log file somewhere. Also, this is the first
part of troubleshooting -- what are the components that make this system
up, and are they all working? The first thing you do is test the lowest
level that isn't proven. In this case, it's your IMAP server. Get a
simple IMAP client, fudge your iptables config so you can get to it from
your PC perhaps, use pine, whatever. Test if it's working. If not, fix
it. If it is, check squirrelmail's logs... etc

&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, the Squirrelmail mail group has so many messsages 
&gt; for help on 
&gt; the mail list, that it takes a significant amount of time to find an 
&gt; appropriate message, and when I find it, I can see that one 
&gt; guy has been 
&gt; asking the list for 4 days the same question I have.

&gt; 
&gt; Further the University of Washington mail list simply didn't answer 
&gt; someone's question about this from January 2002:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/imap/listarch/2002/msg00024.html">http://www.washington.edu/imap/listarch/2002/msg00024.html</A>

None of these are the same as your problem.

Personally, I've never liked UW IMAP. I'd choose another IMAP server.


&gt; P.S.
&gt; 
&gt; I had recently set up the server again to change to SuSE 8.2 on the
server instead of Mandrake.  In the process I
&gt; figured out why the server would be powered off at random times.  The
power supply program nut wasn't working well
&gt; with my small APCC boxes.  But I digress.

Strange... (both that nut was nutty, and that you changed OS's on your
server again -- mostly, people find it's best to find one and stick with
it... :)
