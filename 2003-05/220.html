Quoting David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dlloyd@microbits.com.au">dlloyd@microbits.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My install went smoothly, so unless you've got a highly customised
&gt; &gt; system, I wouldn't expect too many problems. 
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from keeping up with the Joneses and adding a few kernel patches
&gt; here and then, I really don't see the reason for RedHat 9.0. In fact,
&gt; we're starting to see the insidious "We are going to upgrade because we
&gt; can..." syndrome or even worse "We are a commercial company who can't
&gt; make money if we don't upgrade..."
&gt; 
&gt; *hmmm*

As I have said before on this list, a Red Hat product manager has gone on the 
record in suggesting that the reason Red Hat 9 isn't called Red Hat 8.1 is due 
to binary compatibility.  This has been the case for (at least) the 6, 7, 8 and 
now 9 series or products (and unlike most other commercial distros that up 
version numbers for marketting reasons).

Red Hat 9 has a new threading library in glibc, which breaks binary 
compatibility with RH 8, hence the increase in major version number.  The 
reason for the new threading library is to greatly improve Java thread 
performance which was supposedly a big customer request.  (Similar to why RH7
(?) went to GCC 3 - customers wanted a decent C++ compiler and Red Hat took the 
plunge first (and wore lots of flack for it)).

So I don't think your conspiracy theory work this time David :-)

You may have reasons for disliking Red Hat, but this one ain't valid.
