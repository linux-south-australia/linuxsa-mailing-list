 &gt; It seems inconsistent that users are assumed to behave responsibly

 &gt; to connect to the net because I just might use the wrong settings.)

I've already covered the fact that the assumption you've described there
is wholly incorrect, and that the real reason why you're not allowed
to use that modem is because it might kill someone.  The ACA testing 
regime is intended to demonstrate that the modem in question won't
transmit a dangerous voltage down the telephone line.  Many foreign
modems which are illegal to use in Australia have failed this testing.

You may not agree with it, but you don't work on the phone network,
do you?  I think you'd have a different attitude if you routinely 
performed work on building MDFs and needed to wonder whether you were
about to be electrocuted by a cheap and nasty Taiwanese modem every 
time you reached for your Krone tool.  As someone who -does- do that
kind of work from time to time, I'm personally delighted that the ACA
takes such a dim view of untested equipment.

So I don't know why you're clinging to the idea that you're legally 
prevented from using it because someone is afraid you'll use the wrong
settings.  Your attitude seems a bit irrational to me.

Perhaps you're playing devils' advocate.  Wouldn't be the first time
someone has argued an intellectually bankrupt angle just to strike up
a discussion.  (Right, Mr. Newall? :-)

 &gt; The govt doesn't need sledgehammers and machine guns to enforce
 &gt; wireless LAN spectrum - but a 1-page form should not be too onerous.

Don't be ridiculous.  A 1-page form *would* be prohibitively onerous 
for the landscape gardener who wants to use his iBook's AirPort card
to talk to the DSL connection in his house from the shed in the 
back yard.  Along with everyone else who wasn't a geek and didn't know
or want to know anything whatsoever about the frequencies in use.

If you can use a cordless phone or a garage door opener then you should
be able to use a 100 mW spread spectrum tranceiver.  End of story.

 &gt; Then people who fiddle with the registers in the linux kernel code
 &gt; can't claim ignorance.

People who fiddle with frequency registers in kernel modules already
can't claim ignorance;  The only reason to fiddle with those registers
is if you already know what they do and why they're set the way they
are.  Your proposal would have no effect on these people.

It would, however, prevent non-geeks from using the technology at all,
even though it'd never occur to them that there'd ever be a reason to
want to (a) find out what a kernel is, and (b) modify it.

So tell me again what the proposed red tape is intended to achive...?
