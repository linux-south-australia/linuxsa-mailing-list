Here it is.  Doesn't sound like they have a clue as to what the 
allegations are, and are disregarding the threats made to Linus. If 
Linux development has to stop,  how does Lindows go on?

&gt; Lindows.com Reveals Pre-existing Caldera Agreement
&gt;
&gt; SAN DIEGO --May 29, 2003-- In 2001, Lindows.com,Inc. (www.lindows.com 
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.lindows.com&gt">http://www.lindows.com&gt</A>;) entered into talks with SCO Group, then 
&gt; called Caldera, to provide technology for certain product initiatives. 
&gt; Later that same year, a business agreement was reached in which for 
&gt; certain considerations from Lindows.com, SCO agreed to provide 
&gt; technology to Lindows.com. The contract remains in effect.
&gt;
&gt; "We're in an unique situation because of our pre-existing relationship 
&gt; with SCO," said Michael Robertson, chief executive officer of 
&gt; Lindows.com, Inc. "Recently, we have fielded some questions concerning 
&gt; LindowsOS and SCO's legal claims. We want to take this opportunity to 
&gt; emphasize there are no issues between SCO and Lindows.com, Inc. SCO 
&gt; has publicly stated they will continue to honor all contractual 
&gt; obligations with existing customers including product updates, 
&gt; service, and support. Businesses, educational institutions and home 
&gt; users of LindowsOS can be confident they will not be dragged into a 
&gt; legal battle."
&gt;
&gt; Lindows.com is not a party to the legal disagreement between SCO, IBM 
&gt; and other technology companies. Until more facts are presented, 
&gt; Lindows.com will not take a position as to the validity of the claims 
&gt; presented by either side.
