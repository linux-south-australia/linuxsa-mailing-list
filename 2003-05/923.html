&gt; I have a few questions for Knoppix users that may help me in 
&gt; my research.
&gt; 
&gt; Mandrake Box, 233Mhz Pentium MMX, 100MB Ram, 1x4.5GB 	HD, 1x170MB HD.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently this box is used for connecting to the Internet, 
&gt; Print Server and 
&gt; Faxing, (when not on the Net). Could Knoppix do this job, and 
&gt; could I free up 
&gt; the 4.5GB in the process ?

I'm sure it could... You may struggle with just 170MB though -- that's a
pretty minimal installation of anything, really. You could, of course,
use the CDROM with the HDD... but I suspect that that would be painfully
fiddly.

&gt; My early empressions are that it has an excellent OS with a 
&gt; huge assortment of 
&gt; software, and that it was slow running KDE. I then went to 
&gt; Window Maker. I 
&gt; have yet to try any other Window Managers.

It's slow partially because it uses some RAM as a / filesystem, and
because it loads everything off a CDROM. If you installed it on the HDD,
you'd find everything sped up somewhat. There's little reason apart from
this for knoppix to be much slower (then again, it's supposed to run on
pretty much *everything*, which may slow it down a little too).

&gt; 
&gt; A GUI may not be neccessary. I am just as happy with booting 
&gt; into a text 
&gt; prompt. Can I boot into a text prompt with all software running ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; How much room does Knoppix require to boot from the HD. I E 
&gt; would the 170MB HD 
&gt; do the job ok ?

I don't know, but I doubt it -- Perhaps you could try seeing how the CD
mounts filesystems, and attempt to fudge that on your small HDD... ie,
try to configure the small HDD to be the boot partition (copy the CD's
boot stuff to it), make it /, and anything else that needs to be
writable, and mount the CD as /cdrom, with symlinks from
/usr-&gt;/cdrom/livefs/usr or whatever... You'd find this faster than
running from CDROM directly, but still somewhat slow. Also, you'll
certainly find it a PITA. I'd suggest using a real distro, and trying a
minimal install. I don't know which would fit on 170M though...
