Hi,

I have a strange situation here with apache-2.0.43; I am starting to get 
the 403 Forbidden error, when I try to access my page.

My server was running apache-2.043/tomcat4.1.18, and was working fine. 
 Server also had mod_ssl, and was working fine with apache.  Recently I 
tried to use mod_ssl with tomcat applications as well.  After some 
modifications, tomcat application started to work with apache and ssl, 
but only with that; not without SSL.

While I was tampering with httpd.conf, ssl.conf and mod_jk.conf files, 
things got worst. I now have the following problems.

(1) I only managed to ssh that server as root (I have been doing this 
remotely) . If I ssh as normal user, connection closes, and "ssh -v 
myserver" shows the followings:

debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method password
debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
debug1: send channel open 0
debug1: Entering interactive session.
debug1: ssh_session2_setup: id 0
debug1: channel request 0: pty-req
debug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing.
debug1: channel request 0: x11-req
debug1: channel request 0: shell
debug1: fd 3 setting TCP_NODELAY
debug1: channel 0: open confirm rwindow 0 rmax 32768
debug1: channel_free: channel 0: client-session, nchannels 1
Connection to myhost closed by remote host.
Connection to myhost closed.
debug1: Transferred: stdin 0, stdout 0, stderr 103 bytes in 0.3 seconds
debug1: Bytes per second: stdin 0.0, stdout 0.0, stderr 359.4
debug1: Exit status -1

(2) When I try to access my webpage, I get:


  Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.

Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use 
an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache/2.0.43 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.46 OpenSSL/0.9.6e Server at myhost Port 80



As far as I know, httpd.conf file has gone back to its original state (I 
also tried new compilation of apache-2.0.46 with the same result), and 
permission of all directories are normal. So, I suspect, I should have 
messed with some other configuration file to deny the said access (since 
ssh is also behaving differenly).

I appreciate, should any one on the list provides me some pointer on this.

Thanks,

Damar
