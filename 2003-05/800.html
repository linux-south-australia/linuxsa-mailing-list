Yeah, from my knowledge they have been heading down hill for quite some 
time. The last place I worked with had their dial-up lan internet 
connection with SENet and their support was excellent to begin with. 
However, after about mid way through 2002, we had so many troubles. Many 
times our internet connection was dying throughout the day, calls to 
SENet were going unanswered for over 20mins etc. It got too much for my 
boss when we, like Jason, attepmted to get an FTP password for our 
website, but do you think they could give it to us?!?! No, I was on hold 
for 30 minutes, to which eventually I got a tech who obviously new 
nothing about what I wanted (put me on hold to ask for his manager) and 
then gave me the wrong password. Agggggrrrrrr. I then had to wait 
another 20 mins to get the right password! Yep, its been downhill from 
SENet for quite some time if you ask me!!!

&gt;Yeah, I recently had a non-award-winning SENet experience...
&gt;
&gt;After being on hold for *45* minutes (despite the automatic system
&gt;estimating hold times of under 20 minutes...  they must use the same time
&gt;estimation algorithm as Microsoft Installer) I got greeted with a very
&gt;unhelpful Tech who seemed to want nothing more than to get me off the line
&gt;to deal with the next question.
&gt;
&gt;I was just after an FTP password for one of my website clients, who'd lost
&gt;his password and didn't have time to sit about on hold to ask about a bunch
&gt;of stuff he didn't understand anyway.
&gt;
&gt;After some brief dialogue, the person evidently couldn't be bothered dealing
&gt;with me any more, because he HUNG UP on me !  I followed up immediately with
&gt;an email to SENet Tech Support saying that this was inappropriate customer
&gt;service, and haven't heard a thing since.
&gt;
&gt;You'd think they'd look after their site hosting clients, because surely
&gt;there's more money in that than Dialup ISP services ??  And negative word of
&gt;mouth never helped ANYONE'S business !  I'm going to recommend to my client
&gt;that he shift his hosting to someone a bit more helpful...
