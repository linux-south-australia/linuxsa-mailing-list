&gt;&gt;&gt; Microsoft will license the rights to Unix technology from SCO Group, a

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I wonder whether this is because:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  a) Microsoft want to bankroll SCO before IBM makes it fall flat on its
&gt;&gt;     face
&gt;
&gt; Why would Microsoft do that though?  SCO develop server systems, as does
&gt; Microsoft (although, still in its infancy with this venture).  My personal
&gt; opinion is that it is in Microsoft's interest to discredit Linux as a
&gt; viable option

Yes, this seems a reasonable assumption.

&gt; and certainly, there have been some grumbles at work as to whether
&gt; we should use it or not.

And that's what I have expected.  I fear that Microsoft and SCO have
found a viable way to attack Linux.

&gt;&gt;  b) Microsoft actually have borrowed some Unix technology using a
&gt;&gt;     licence that would be unpalatable for the public to know (i.e. they
&gt;&gt;     didn't steal it but kept the licence secret [1]) and might get egg
&gt;&gt;     on its face if SCO suddenly realises it has
&gt;
&gt; Of course they have borrowed Unix technology - they actually sell a
&gt; product specifically aimed at the Windows/*nix mixed environments.
&gt; Not that I know many people that use it, but it does exist.

This is an interesting point.  It means that Microsoft must already be
a UNIX  licensee, so it's reasonable  to guess that the  deal with SCO
over the weekend must be something else.

&gt; Not exactly in the same vein, but I remember spending two hours
&gt; explaining to a Microsoft only SysAdmin that *nix had been using
&gt; LDAP and DNS technologies for years.  Slightly more subjective, I
&gt; then went on to explain to this guy that AD was simply a bastardised
&gt; copy of these technologies and that probably took another few hours
&gt; or so (and plenty of beer). *shrug*
