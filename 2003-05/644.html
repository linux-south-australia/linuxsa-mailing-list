Thanks guys, last night I found evidence of a serious brain fade, I'd 
downloaded the kernel-headers for 2.4.20-1 but not for 2.4.20-1-k7, DOH!
After apt-getting the correct headers and using
"export IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH=yes" things went better, but the kernel 
module still wouldn't load automatically.
It exists and I can load it manually with insmod.
The NVIDIA script exits with errors talking about not being happy with 
non-GPL modules but at least the module exists.
I'll just have to tack "/sbin/insmod nvidia" onto the end of one of the 
rc3.d scripts.
But at least it all works now, and I can get 150 fps while running 
EGOBOO, which will make my daughter (and me of course) very happy.

Thanks again for you patience and suggestions,
David Creed

&gt;&gt; Hi list, I'm just trying to install Nvidia drivers on Debian/Knoppix 
&gt;&gt; Unstable and coming up against problems.
&gt;&gt; kernel is standard Debian
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:root@ferret">root@ferret</A>:/usr/src# uname -r
&gt;&gt; 2.4.20-1-k7
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I tried to install Nvidia drivers version NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-4349.run
&gt;&gt; and found I needed to install source code for 2.4.20, did this, 
&gt;&gt; unzipped and untarred it, pointed /usr/src/linux at 
&gt;&gt; kernel-source-2.4.20 and re ran the Nvidia installer.
&gt;&gt; Next problem was a message saying 
&gt;&gt; /usr/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h didn't exist, I had a look 
&gt;&gt; and there was a modsetver.h, so I did ln -s modsetver.h modversions.h
&gt;&gt; that seemed to satisfy things until on my next attempt to install I 
&gt;&gt; got errors about different versions of compilers used to compile my 
&gt;&gt; kernel and being used to compile the Nvidia driver and that I should 
&gt;&gt; investigate IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH, so my next move was to
&gt;&gt; export IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH=yes
&gt;&gt; Now it get's beyond my level of skills and exits with (to me anyway) 
&gt;&gt; obsure messages about "conflicting types for `kernel_thread'" which 
&gt;&gt; means nothing to me.
&gt;&gt; I'm hoping someone can help me with this, as it's bloody frustrating.
&gt;&gt; I've attached the /var/log/nvidia-installer.log file for referance.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;&gt; David Creed

&gt; 
&gt; David,
&gt;     Having gone through this process myself (using vanilla debian 
&gt; unstable), I think I can get you though it :) The fixes to your problems 
&gt; are these:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. You need the setup that was used to build your current kernel, so 
&gt; what you need to do is "apt-get install kernel-headers-2.4.20-1-k7" 
&gt; which will have the config and modversions.h that were used to build 
&gt; your current kernel. You don't even need the full source once you do 
&gt; this. I think it sticks it in /usr/src/kernel-headers-2.4.20-1-k7 or 
&gt; something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. To fix the CC mismatch you'll need to set the version of CC to the 
&gt; same one the kernel used, which I would guess is 2.95, while the default 
&gt; installed version is probably 3.2. To do this, before building do 
&gt; "export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-2.95" make sure that /usr/bin/gcc-2.95 exists - 
&gt; I might have the filename wrong, or it might need to be installed - but 
&gt; you get the idea.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to keep things debianised - It might pay to use the packaged 
&gt; version of the drivers and follow the README.Debian files in 
&gt; /usr/share/doc/&lt;package_name&gt; on how to build them "the debian way". It 
&gt; is pretty straightforward once you get used to it.
&gt; 
&gt; HTH
&gt; Barney
