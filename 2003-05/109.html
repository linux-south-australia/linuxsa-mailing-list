Alright. This list is coming alive, I mean really alive!!  :-)  It 
already was alive, but wow! :-)

Ok, I have something unique to throw in.  People are people, right? 
 That's why I also think its important to watch what happens in Oregon, 
so that we can anticipate how it will play out in South Australia. By 
the way,  a lot of this thread echos what was said ih the recent 
committee hearing in Oregon.

To me, it is very clear that the position that the Open Source bill 
proponents have taken cannot be clearly explained. Microsoft and its 
cronies have played on words and misframed the scope of the arguement 
and as a  result can refute what is being said because representatives 
will not have a full understanding on the issue.

Folks, you have to be very ready to go in there and avoid these pitfalls.

Everyday people supported the bill, while big software companies sent 
out attornies, one of which was a puppet group of Microsoft.  It looked 
as though the opponents had a broad base of support, while only a select 
few people supported the bill.

To counter this type of appearance of mismatch, I suggest that a 
cohesive arguement be made by a large group with broad based support. 
 Whoever shows up to speak for the group ought to have a title that 
sounds important.

One thing is for sure, Stallman is right. The focus should not be on 
cost, it should be on access to government information, AKA open 
formats. Problem is that the bill was brought up mostlly out of monetary 
concerns, not civil rights.  Government access makes the strongest 
arguement, and leaves no room for rebuttal, just a change in the 
behavior of proprietary vendors. Furthermore, open standards can be set 
by a rule making body, and that's all a legislator wants to know. He 
doesn't have time to sort out all of the computer technology.

On contacting elected officials as a body. *****

I print out and pass on mail sent to an elected official. It is very 
noticable when 50 different people send letters containing the exact 
same words.  :-D



***** Highlights ******

Statements made by the proponents:

1. There is a bias against Open Source software and the bill's purpose 
is to remidy the bias.

2. Data is held for the public by the government in trust. Access to 
this data ought not be subject to vendor lock in and the resulting 
blackmail. Open standards will guard against vendor lock in and 
exploitation.

To me, this is the strongest arguement.  It poses the question, if 
Microsoft want to do business with the government, they had better play 
by open rules. The important piece of information that is not mentioned 
is that citizens must have access to that information as well.

3. Implied that only closed source software will have spyware features

4. Made blanket statements about security, almost mythological. That 
software is combed over by open source code readers and security holes 
are always fixed immediately, so fast that vendoes slow down the process. 

5. Linux' security model limits the damage that can be done by viruses. 
So, there are no viruses. Data will be absolutely secure. (Bad 
arguement. What if a Linux server gets rooted)

6. Software will be free and save the state money. (No, methinks that 
the state will have to create its own Department of Software creation)

( I agree that it will be a lower cost, but _not_ that it will be 
gratis. There will be development costs, expirimentation costs, costs to 
migrate)





Opponents:

   1. American Electronics Association
   2. Business Software Alliance
   3. Initiative for Software Choice

This page will give a good idea of who they are:

Statements made by opposition:

   1. We just want to compete fairly. *innocent blinks* That gives us
      the incentive to innovate
   2. The law is restrictive to choosing the most cost effective solution
   3. Law adds additional buracracy to the process
   4. Opens up legal problems to state if Open Source is not chosen
   5. Law already allows for state agencies to choose open source solutions
   6. The market and competition it brings causes best choices to be made
   7. Data formats is a management issue and not a software issue
   8. Were not voting on if Open Source is a good solution
   9. Tips State procurment of software in favor of a vendor
  10. Justification requirement ads to software costs, does not reduce costs
  11. The word "avoid" in  the phrase "avoid proprietary closed formats"
      is anticompetative
  12. We are a big big big group we speak for many many people
  13. Even through we are in tough times economically, not regulating
      the economy has allowed our proprietary companies to innovate
  14. The first computer virus was a Unix virus. (Up oh, there goes the
      credability) 
  15. Saying that Open Source software is non commercial is a mistake.
      This bill will force companies to lower prices, and kill innovation
  16. However, there will be no savings to the tax payer
  17. Software will not match the needs of the state
  18. Proprietary means that you poured your resources into creating the
      product and you control it
  19. Open Standards are, for the most part, worked on and paid for by
      proprietary software vendors. After all they have the revenue
      streams to fund it because they are not free. 
  20. There is no such thing as a free lunch, just cost of acquisition
      is considered, not total cost of ownership
  21. Big businesses like Red Hat and IBM are behind this bill, and this
      is their attempt to carpetbag marketshare
  22. Free software purchasers will need to pay close to a billion
      dollars for support, total cost of ownership will be higher, they
      make money because it is difficult to use the software, they have
      that incentive.
  23. We need more teachers not software administrators
  24.  "We won't say that Proprietary software should considered over
      Open Source solutions. We think the system works, and as you can
      see, people that have testified today have chose open source
      solutions, proving the system works." They were free to choose the
      open source soilution and they did. This is not a battle between
      good and evil.

Observations:

Two members of the committee could not imagine the impact a proprietary 
format could have on one's ability to view government documents. They 
had no concept that a citizen could be denied access to public 
information if they did not  purchase a proprietary piece  of software.

A comparison between contracts for a food product choice for the state 
prison system and software were made along these lines... 'If I always 
pick Kellogs and then someone makes me also consider Mayberry's Muslix, 
it muddies the water, causes extra beauracy, all for not because I will 
go with Kellogs anyway because they are confident in it.. Am I just 
dense, or does this sound burdensome?'

One Committee member thought that Linux was a company.  "If all of this 
was free, how do you guys make a living?" Laugh laugh. No answer. 
 Folks, they needed Stallman there very badly!
