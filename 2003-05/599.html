Alex,

That's really awesome. I'll give it a go some time soon, at least
with 2 monitors for a start.

After some further thinking, it's occurred to me that with X windows,
one generally has the ability to bring up windows for each of several
machines - like for example I have a home office net of 9 linux PCs
plus bits and pieces, which I access from one pokey little monitor.
But the reverse fan-out of using multiple monitors on one machine - which
then access the multiple machines - is rarely done.
This is a strength of the "ageing" X window system which is not even
used much yet.

Another thing that occurred to me is that for a linux open day sort of
event, it would be very impressive to the MS and Mac mob to show
them a triple monitor machine so that they can see that linux
does offer them something extra that they don't expect to get on MS.
I wonder if one could get one of those screen animals like fish or cats
to go wandering around between the screens. I have some dim recollection of
this from the late 1980s as a demo.
Whether or not you _can_ get multiple monitors on an MS or Mac machine,
I reckon the sight of linux doing this would win a lot of converts
among the young and impressionable.

&gt; The man XF86Config page has information on the ServerLayout section and
&gt; as an example my XF86Config can be viewed at
&gt; <A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/awol/configs/XF86Config-4.triple.">http://awol.no-ip.org/awol/configs/XF86Config-4.triple.</A> I have 3 video
&gt; cards but the minimum requirement AFAIK is 2. One has to be AGP and the
&gt; other PCI. 

Ay, there's the rub. I'll have to dig up an old PCI graphics card.
I've heard of some high-price motherboards which have dual APG slots, I think, 
but it's probably best to go down the PCI path.

Cheers and many thanks,
Alan Kennington.
