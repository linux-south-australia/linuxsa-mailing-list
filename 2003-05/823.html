&gt; I've found that even the most basic _documentation_ even on the
&gt; mainstream Toshiba laptops I've bought consists of .exe files!!*%
&gt; Now that's about as unportable as I can think of.
&gt; They seem to be sending a definite message about what they expect
&gt; you to be running on their machines.
&gt; I had to wind up my old wind95 machine to even look at the documentation,
&gt; and it wouldn't extract itself out into anything else sensible either -
&gt; you could only view the files while the .exe file was running.
&gt; So I had to take notes on paper. I hope Toshiba have got wiser since then.

I think they have, as the toshiba.com site contains quite a lot of
documentation and updates including a forum staffed by Toshiba USA people.
There is also a service to automatically email you tech support updates.

Tip for looking for patches and documentation: Check Toshiba sites around
the world.  My Satellite 1110 came with ATi video drivers that were prone to
BSODing.  Toshiba AU and Toshiba USA websites had the same old drivers for
many months, but Toshiba Canada had updated ones.  A month later the USA and
AU websites were updated with even better drivers but the Canadian site
wasn't.  A bit uncoordinated to say the least.

I would rate Dell's and HP's online forums above that offered by Toshiba.
