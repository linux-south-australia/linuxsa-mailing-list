&gt; This is a _private_ network, it is shared for some who wish 
&gt; free hosting. It is not available for emails to others except 
&gt; my family and a few who would like free hosting. There are no 
&gt; accounts for legions of users or businesses queueing up for 
&gt; service, it is mine, and I will admin it how I wish. If your 
&gt; domain is part of a block that is know for spam, tough!

You may do whatever you want. However, if you indiscriminately accuse me
of spam, which you have (that's the only thing that your rejection email
does), and give me no way of saying "no, this isn't spam" (if you reject
all mail, I can't contact you), and refuse to fix your broken setup when
I go out of my way to tell you that I'm not a spammer (which I did, yet
mail is still being rejected), and if I want to send email to someone
who uses your mail server, expect me (and anyone else who you do the
same to) to call you on it (which I have done). At this point in time, I
really don't care any more, especially as there is unlikely to be many
people there who I want to contact. 

&gt; If you have better suggestions for the handling of spam, I am 
&gt; always open to them, I have used SpamAssasin, bogofilter and 
&gt; others but still it persists from some domains, some say that 
&gt; my blocking Yahoo is extreme, some say it is a good measure.

You will ALWAYS get spam. ALWAYS. There is NO KNOWN WAY of getting rid
of all of it. Every other way (spamassassin etc) is less indiscriminate,
and most of them at least give people a way of finding out why they have
been blocked. Even using rbls gives more fine-grained control than
202.*, and, importantly, lets users know what they can do to get off the
blackhole list.

I got particularly irritated with your setup because I couldn't even
find out why I was blocked -- was it a wrong blocking list that was
shared by many, or is it just a single admin somewhere? If I'm on a
blocking list of some sort, I am really concerned, and will put
significant effort into getting myself off it. If it's just a single
admin, I don't care as much, but will still put some effort into
correcting them, in case I need to contact someone on that server at
some stage.
