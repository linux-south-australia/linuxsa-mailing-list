&gt; &gt; I'm having problem with my MA401 and MA301 NetGear cards under Linux. In
&gt; &gt; both cases, I'm running Debian 3.0 release with a 2.4.20 kernel (that's
&gt; &gt; been slightly patched). Neither card seem to work with any of the
&gt; &gt; modules that the documentation claim they should.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been a while since I played with PCMCIA cradles on Linux.. But I
&gt; assume that this might be your problem, not the Netgear wifi driver.

I was thinking the same thing myself, but it does seem strange that
FreeBSD likes it on the same hardware (dual-boot laptop) and that both
operating systems are happy coping with my ethernet cards (one old and
3com and the other new and RealTek).

I've just managed to get cardmgr/cardctl to detect the device in the
slot (had problems with that for a while) and not lock the machine. It
says that it's a MA401RA, which isn't the same as an MA401 (apparently
the labels are identical).

&gt; &gt;From memory you need to enable Wireless Extensions in the kernel config
&gt; but DISABLE PCMCIA support.
&gt; 
&gt; Then grab the pcmcia card services from:
&gt; <A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/">http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Untar and compile that. (You will need a made dep kernel source)

I've got a pre-dep'd kernel source lying around for the running kernel
as well as the external PCMCIA stuff. I'm about to try that again.

&gt; &gt; The funny thing is (well, Greg might disagree :-)) that both work very
&gt; &gt; nicely using the wi driver in the FreeBSD 5.0 kernel running on the same
&gt; &gt; hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, funny that :P

Unlike the APM/ACPI thing..... Grrr. :-)

&gt; You might find alot of useful information, specifically about wireless
&gt; hardware and software in the <A HREF="http://www.air-stream.org/forums/">http://www.air-stream.org/forums/</A> forums.

thx,
Matt
