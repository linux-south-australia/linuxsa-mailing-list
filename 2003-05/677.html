*JL Crawling out from underneath the email papers*

Well, we decided against acquiring the Gestetner Multifunctional after 
all. However, I still hope to make an attempt to document what I did on 
a web site of some sort. At least Linux users can know that they don't 
have to own a Windows box to use the scanning feature .  I hadn't made 
any progress on faxing out, but  Daryl has provided some valuable 
information that should help whoever needs the information.

We did buy a Konica 7022 Multifunctional, and I hope to see what can be 
done with it.

&gt;&gt;Can Etheral send captured packets? See below***
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It can capture it to a pcap compatible file, and you can switch the
&gt;"Follow TCP trace" output screen from ascii to hex (well, my old
&gt;0.8.8 version can).  There is a utility that can convert pcap capture
&gt;files back into raw binary dumps, but its name eludes me at the
&gt;moment (tcpflow? tcpsplice? tcptrace?  nuts (that last one isn't a
&gt;program :-)).
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I will try to look for a Linux "G3 fax" front end that allows me to
&gt;&gt;specify a phone number, etc.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;G3 is that fax data format (think of it like a GIF for faxes), and
&gt;it doesn't know about things like phone numbers, so it's only part
&gt;of the solution (and that's still a wild guess on my part).  There's
&gt;still more digging and splicing to be done, because I suspect the
&gt;"PCFAX Adonis-C2" part is a header of some sort, plus you will need
&gt;to add the PJL header to that as well before you can even begin to
&gt;start sending faxes, and this is *after* the binary part has been
&gt;figured out.  It's a bit premature to be throwing data at the thing
&gt;just yet.
&gt;
&gt;If you can extract the data portion after the header, then running
&gt;the "file" command across the data should reveal if it's in a common
&gt;format or not.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Netcat is a mystery to me, it should do the job, but the documentation,
&gt;&gt;to me, does not make clear how the commnd really works.  Some of the
&gt;&gt;documentation out there shows commands that appear to now be obsolete,
&gt;&gt;or that are not in use with the version of Netcat on my machine. I have
&gt;&gt;sent netcat commands only to have it just sit there and do nothing, then
&gt;&gt;give me an annoying "punt!" message when I hit control-c.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;nc &lt; file_loaded_with_data  multi_hostname port#
&gt;
&gt;I suspect that if you can grab a binary capture of the data and dump it
&gt;into a file, then you could execute the above and have it work.  The
&gt;trick would be creating a compatible format of your own so that you don't
&gt;have to have an infinite number of faxes, with everything you'd every want
&gt;to fax prepared in advance.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The next trick will be to "make a print driver" or "find one already
&gt;&gt;made". I have no idea where to start, except to look for the "G3 fax"
&gt;&gt;drver, assuming that it will allow me to include a phone number, etc to
&gt;&gt;send the fax to. Any ideas as to where I might look.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We're not at that stage yet, buddy, for reason outline above.  :-)
