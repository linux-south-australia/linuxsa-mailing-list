Mike,

I don't have any direct experience with the S3 you describe.  Some things you 
could try...

Examine the output from startx.  On my Debian system this goes to 
/var/log/XFree86.0.log.  If you don't find it there, just tee the output from 
startx to a file.  Somewhere in all this information, Xfree will tell you 
that it has rejected various modes and why.  

Examine the Xfree configuration file, mine is at /etc/X11/XF86Config-4.   
Find the section "Monitor" and ensure that the Horiz and Vert sync matches 
your actual monitor.  I hope that this is not telling you to suck eggs but 
you reported:
&gt; the monitor reports Out of Range, frequency of 26Hz.
This is a clue that the entry in this section is wrong and if so, maybe the 
top end of the range has not been correctly set either and that would explain 
the inability to go higher than 640x480.

Check that the Xserver which you are using is able to access the video clock. 
Prior to version 4 of Xfree86, this was partly the responsibility of the sys 
admin, in those days, the clock generator was separate from other things and 
getting it wrong would exclude a whole bunch of video modes not unlike the 
symptoms you describe.  The older X86 server had an option to probe the 
clocks but I am unable to find it.  Perhaps someone on the list knows what 
has happened to it.

If you can load M$ Windows AND the drivers that came with the 
motherboard, examine the the video settings including the clock frequency.  
This will give you a benchmark.  Try creating a modeline in XFConfig which 
uses the same clock and resolution.  I once used this technique to 
discover that if I overclocked my monitor just a tweeny-weeny little bit, I 
could push the frame rate to 85Hz and reduce eye strain.

Good Luck,

&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt; We are experiencing difficulties getting a S3 ProSavage DDR video
&gt; chipset to work with X. The S3 ProSavage is an integrated VGA chipset on
&gt; the MSI KM2M MS-6738 Ver 1.0 mainboard. The adapter works fine in
&gt; 640x480 24bit resolution, however when increased to 800x600 or 1024x768
&gt; the monitor reports Out of Range, frequency of 26Hz.
&gt;
&gt; So far we have tried:
&gt;
&gt;  - Downloading and compiling XF86 from source with new driver from
&gt; maintainers site (<A HREF="http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html">http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html</A>).
&gt;  - Changing the motherboard
&gt;  - Changing the monitor
&gt;  - Upgraind the bios to the latest v1.3 from MSI website
&gt;  - Attempted installing new versions of linux ie Redhat 9.0 or Konppix
&gt; both get Out of Range error on installation (Konppix works in 640x480).
&gt;
&gt; The application we are using the computer for is to boot an LTSP
&gt; terminal. The motherbaord is installed into an AOPEN mini-ATX case where
&gt; installing an alternative Video Card is not an option. There appears to
&gt; be very little reference to the ProSavage DDR chipset on the Internet in
&gt; relation to Linux, however any documentation that does exist seems to
&gt; indicate that it is a fully supported chipset.
&gt;
&gt; We have also tried to hardcode the X modelines to support 1024x768,
&gt; however the driver appears to ignore our modelines and do its own thing.
&gt;
&gt; Changing the motherboard or video card is a very difficult option given
&gt; we have already purchased 25 units and have fully installed and disposed
&gt; of all packaging, as research was done prior to purchasing the equipment
&gt; that indicated all hardware was supported.
&gt;
&gt; Any help greatly appreciated, happy to offer financial compensation for
&gt; somebody who is able to get it working, sorry no $$$ for trying !!!
&gt;
&gt; Time is of the essence, as these 25 units are due to be shipped this
&gt; coming Tuesday !!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;   Mike O'C
