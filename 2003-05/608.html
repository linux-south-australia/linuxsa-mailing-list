The new Networker 7.0 may be your friend in this instance... of course, 
this costs a lot of money, but it works....

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of software that will enable users to access and
&gt; restore their own backups? I'm about to have a big (52 tape) DLT tape
&gt; robot for backups, and I know I can use Amanda (or probably even just
&gt; tar and friends) to automate daily backups. However, even amanda appears
&gt; to be somewhat clunky when I try to restore -- the process is something
&gt; like this:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) run amrecover as the amanda user
&gt; 2) use the command-line interface to set the correct host (in my case,
&gt; there is -- or will be -- one host) DLE (disklist entry), and restore
&gt; date.
&gt; 3) manually look for the file in the filesystem, and mark it (or them).
&gt; 4) extract the file... amanda then asks for confirmation, then says
&gt; which tape to load.
&gt; 5) load the tape (manually, or with an amtape command)
&gt; 6) amanda may ask for another tape... step 5 again...
&gt; 7) copy or move the file from the cwd to whereever you want it (or
&gt; change cwd before step 4)
&gt; 
&gt; This requires sysadmin intervention, and can take a few hours. It's
&gt; particularly irritating if you need three tapes, and have to wait two
&gt; hours between each tape, and only have three hours available onsite. I'd
&gt; really like some sort of online or user-driven restore system.
&gt; Unfortunately, the rsync-based script as described here some time ago is
&gt; not presently an option, as we don't have the spare disk space, and
&gt; won't be getting sufficiently more for some time. Also, I have this tape
&gt; robot now, and suspect I should be able to automate it with this
&gt; somehow...
&gt; 
&gt; So... what I want is either a filesystem-like interface (though I
&gt; suspect that this would be painfully unresponsive), or a web-based
&gt; interface, where users can clickety-click, wait a few hours, and presto,
&gt; their file is restored, and all I hear is the whirr-snick-bzzt of the
&gt; tape robot.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
