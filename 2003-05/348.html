This should be doable.  If you run the standard FTP client under Linux,
just issue "ftp" on its own from the command line, then at the ftp prompt
enter "open w2k_server_name 3670", then enter the anonymous username and
whatever for a password (which it should accept, otherwise you'll have to
sniff the exact password).

&gt; I opened an ftp session from another
&gt; box to my Linux machine and tried the command CWD and it errored out,
&gt; but when I ran cd it worked.  Do I need to worry about this?

No.  "cd the FTP command" is translated to "CWD the FTP protocol command".
As a _user_, you're not supposed to know those underlying details.  It's the
same with retrieving the file, you're not supposed to know about the PORTs
and RETRs that go on.

So your first session looks like the following from a *client* point of
view (broken up to look a bit more functional).  You should be able to
replicate this by ftp'ing to the windows server yourself.  Note that
there is a lot of redundant commands in there.

ftp win2kserver
user anonymous
pass *

cd /
bin
get serverstatus

cd /
bin
get serveroption

cd /Version
bin
get D000074756b8f.ver

cd /Address
bin
get D000074756b8f.12.grp

cd /Address
bin
get D000074756b8f.12.dst

cd /Address
bin
get D000074756b8f.12.snd

quit

=== Second session ===

Putting files onto the server.   Incoming fax or scan?  The put of
the file ".end" looks to be just a flag to indicate that the process
has completed.


ftp win2kserver
user anonymous
pass *


cd /d000074756b8f
mkdir 20030509212604019
cd 20030509212604019
bin
put page1
bin
put docinfo.xml
bin
put .end
quit
