I've upgraded from RH 8.0 to RH9 recently. Really I can't see the difference 
compared to RH 7-8 or even more so 6-7. I would almost call RH9 RH8.1. It is 
nice to have all the latest versions of programs, saves a huge RPM update, 
and so for that much is worth it. 

My install went smoothly, so unless you've got a highly customised system, I 
wouldn't expect too many problems.

&gt; Hi All.. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently running Redhat 8.0 on my desktop and I'm finding 2D stuff
&gt; in X rather slow (e.g. xmms plugins run like a dog, terminal windows
&gt; scroll slowly).   
&gt; 
&gt; I have got DRI going for the 3D stuff and OpenGL is smooth and fast but
&gt; for some reason 2D redraws on my Radeon 7500 seem to have high latency
&gt; under RH 8.0 and I can't really work out why. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I ran up the latest Knoppix release the other day and suddenly 2D
&gt; came to life.  My xmms plugins were smooth, terminal sessions had snappy
&gt; scrolling speeds.  The only thing I can think (after much mucking around
&gt; comparing XF86Config files and logs between Knoppix and RH 8.0) is that
&gt; XFree86 V4.3 (which the latest Knoppix runs) has better drivers for my
&gt; Radeon than the 4.2 version shipped in RH8. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm now considering an upgrade to RH 9.0 which includes XF86 4.3 but
&gt; I've just spent the last week getting my system configured up just the
&gt; way I want it, so I don't want to go to the lengths of upgrading if RH
&gt; 9.0 is being received poorly.  I have read a few reviews and nothing too
&gt; disturbing has been reported about RH 9.0 but I'm wondering if any list
&gt; members have any first hand comments to make about it, specifically in
&gt; comparison to RH 8.0. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your thoughts guys. 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Graham Smith
