&gt; What changed the tide for me was _not_  using  _alsamixer_  but using

&gt; Assumeing that you use KDE, click on the Alligator face, go to

James,

I didn't find GKaumix on the SuSE 8.1 disks, but there is something called
"gamix" which is described in the RPM notes as being a GTK audio mixer,
and it seems to be what you've described.
Both gamix and alsamixer seem to have no documentation that I can find.
Nor can I find anything except bits and pieces about aplay, arecord,
amixer etc. etc.
So I've downloaded the sources for everything I could find on the ALSA site.
I'm usually prepared to spend up to 3 days getting something working,
but this has now been 3 years, and I haven't got one single millisecond
of sound through that optical S/PDIF interface yet.
 
&gt; Just click on the Rec button for the Vol setting.  Take the microphone 
&gt; down to zero.  PCM at 15 eliminates any distortion in the recording.

I suspect that mike recording is okay.
The alsamixer and gamix softwre have two different ways of denying me
the possibility to use the S/PDIF input, it seems:

The alsamixer does have sliders for:
IEC958, IEC958 C, IEC 958 A, IEC958 A, IEC958 1
and two sliders marked "Digital".
I suspect that among these must be the controls for my optical
S/PDIF input interface.

However, unlike the MIC, AUX, CD, Line, MIx, Mix Mono sliders, there
is no "Capture L-R" button to set on top of the digital-looking sliders.

It's just possible that whoever wrote the drivers for this
particular chipset just didn't get around to programming the
capture facility for these interfaces.

The gamix tool has a little menu for selecting the capture source,
and it lists the above ones that alsamixer offers me,
and not the digital inputs. In fact, gamix doesn't even have
sliders for the digital inputs at all.

The arecord listing facility gives me this:

==========================================================
<A HREF="mailto:akenning@hamster">akenning@hamster</A>:~&gt; arecord -l
card 0: card0 [Yamaha DS-XG PCI (YMF754)], device 0: YMFPCI [YMFPCI]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: card0 [Yamaha DS-XG PCI (YMF754)], device 3: YMFPCI - AC'97 [YMFPCI - AC'97]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
==========================================================

So I know that the digital stuff is there on device 3.
The last two lines of output from "arecord -L" are:

iec958 'cards.pcm.iec958'
spdif 'cards.pcm.iec958'

This gives me some hope too. It sort of suggests that the ALSA writers
have some awareness of the S/PDIF interface. But I have no idea how
to use this info because I can't find documentation.
Virtually everything I do with the audio software is by guesswork
and inference. 

But I think that this might be the final or penultimate nail in the coffin:

------------------------------------------------------
Simple mixer control 'Digital',0
  Capabilities: cvolume
  Capture channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Capture 0 - 16383
  Front Left: Capture 16383 [100%]
  Front Right: Capture 16383 [100%]
Simple mixer control 'Digital',1
  Capabilities: cvolume
  Capture channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Capture 0 - 16383
  Front Left: Capture 16383 [100%]
  Front Right: Capture 16383 [100%]
------------------------------------------------------

This output from "amixer" says that the digital interfaces (I think that 0
means coax and 1 means optical) only have volume capabilities, but
no "cswitch" capability to turn on capture.
But then again, these lines are also in the output from "amixer":

------------------------------------------------------
Simple mixer control 'IEC958',0
  Capabilities: cvolume pswitch pswitch-joined cswitch cswitch-joined
  Playback channels: Mono
  Capture channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Capture 0 - 16383
  Mono: Playback [on]
  Front Left: Capture 16054 [98%] [off]
  Front Right: Capture 16054 [98%] [off]
Simple mixer control 'IEC958 AC97',0
  Capabilities: pvolume
  Playback channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Playback 0 - 16383
  Front Left: Playback 16383 [100%]
  Front Right: Playback 16383 [100%]
Simple mixer control 'IEC958 AC97',1
  Capabilities: pvolume
  Playback channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Playback 0 - 16383
  Front Left: Playback 16383 [100%]
  Front Right: Playback 16383 [100%]
Simple mixer control 'IEC958',1
  Capabilities: cvolume
  Capture channels: Front Left - Front Right
  Limits: Capture 0 - 16383
  Front Left: Capture 14742 [90%]
  Front Right: Capture 14742 [90%]
----------------------------------------------------

So there should be a "cswitch" facility for the IEC958,0 thing.
But I'm just guessing. I have no documentation to explain the above output.

I'm used to reading a couple of thousand pages of technical documentation
for even fairly ordinary tasks, and I don't expect to understand any
substantial system or piece of software without reading at least
a few hundred pages of docs.
The frustrating thing with this though, it the very sparse amount of
documentation that I can find on the ALSA site, the linux HOWTO docs,
the man-manuals, in Google, etc. etc.
I just hope the source code for ALSA is commented!
If not, I'm going to have to read a large amount of source just
to get a few bytes of sound through an interfaces.
I really can't imagine a Mac user putting in so much effort over
3 years to get their sound gear set up.

Do you happen to know where the output of "amixer" is documented?
And what about the mysterious $HOME/.asound file?
There's a tiny cookbook with snippets and clues here:
<A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/asoundrc.php3">http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/doc-php/asoundrc.php3</A>
But none of the many links I've followed from this lead to
any more details on this mysterious .asoundrc language.

My best guess is that in these last 3 years, the ALSA driver writer
for my sound card has still not got around to implementing
digital audio capture.
So I've got to choose between adding it myself by reading the
YMF754 chip spec, or cutting my losses and getting an audio
card with _verified_ optical S/PDIF input capture with the ALSA software.
I strongly suspect that if I had been using MS-Windows, this
capability would have been working within 1 hour of getting the
card home. This is just one of the many sacrifices one has to make
for the politically principled choice of using linux.
I'm beginning to think that:

Macs are for artists,
MS-Windows is for office workers,
Linux is for engineers and scientists.

Probably everyone should have 3 machines and use the right OS
for each category of activity.
I've noticed that Mac users have a raging social life and they're always
smiling and popular. MS-Windows users have very healthy bank accounts.
And linux users are glum and obsessive and think they're being
persecuted and discriminated against - which sounds credible to me.
But then I'm a glum, obsessive linux user.
I bet my social life would explode if I had a Mac.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
