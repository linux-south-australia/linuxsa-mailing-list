Topic: Really wierd hardware and PPP/serial RX packet loss.

While playing around with PPP over a null modem today,
in a more or less scientific manner, like by inserting lots of trace
commands in the kernel modules, I found something rather surprising.
Considering that millions of people use PPP/serial worldwide,
I'm surprised that I've not heard of this problem in my last
6 years of linux/PC usage.

My PPP/serial link loses about 1 out of 20 to 50 packets over a
lighltly loaded link at 19200 bits/sec between two computers on the
same desk. The cause turned out to be UART overrun - I traced it right
down to the serial driver's flag bytes; so I'm sure of the _nature_ of
the problem. But the cause is still a little uncertain.

While searching in the Google encyclopedia, I found this little gem:
<A HREF="http://cae.best.vwh.net/irqtune/">http://cae.best.vwh.net/irqtune/</A>
The document is dated 1997 but happens to describe the problem I've got.
I wouldn't have thought that such a glaring error - a rather large
packet loss rate - would persist into 2003.

This guy seems to have some software (which no doubt doesn't work in
the modern kernel as we know it) to fix up the hardware priorities
in software by loading up a kernel module to modify the priorities.
It seems like the wacky PC hardware organises all those priorities
in the /proc/interrupts file as follows:
0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
from highest to lowest priority.
Now that's what I call wacky hardware. Coming from a 68k background,
I find this a little bizarre - like most of the PC hardware, including
the fact that all the bytes are backwards, and they've got this
wierd way of making address registers by shifting 16-bit integers
4 bits to the left and adding - truly wacky!

But now what I'd like to know is:
-	How come no one ever mentions this amazingly high PPP/serial
	packet loss rate? It seems to be caused by the lateness
	of servicing hardware interrupts, although I can't fathom this,
	given the way bottom-half hand-offs are supposed to avoid this.

-	Is there a simple fix for the problem?

-	Or is it already fixed and I've really got something else.

-	If this guy in 1997 knew how to arbitrarily rearrange the
	IRQ priorities, then how come this fix isn't in the kernel already? 

My RX host is always getting the overrun when opening an ohphone
voice call, which means it's probably starting up the audio card
kernel modules into action. My provisional explanation of the problem
is that the sound modules are just not letting the serial
module get a look-in for up to 10 mSec or so. This would match
my experiments. This is despite the fact that I have audio on IRQ 7 and
serial on IRQ 4.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
