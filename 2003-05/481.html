&gt; Alan, you've read (and probably /written/) standards documents before.
&gt; You should know that when the document is silent on some matter, that
&gt; means the implementor is free to do whatever they want.

Mark,

In this case, the spec was clear. And it was silent on _contradictions_
to the rule. It was not silent on the requirement to put a different
IP ID in every packet.

&gt; You've concluded that it's zero if the DF bit is set;  Without looking at
&gt; it in detail, I'd conjecture that it's -actually- zero for unfragmentated
&gt; packets, whether the DF bit is set or not.  You're probably in a better
&gt; position to test that than I am.

Actually not. I see constant IP ID = 0 if and only if the DF bit is set.
I don't have the energy to read the kernel source for this right now.
But I will read it.

&gt;  &gt; I now have to tell my client that my software will only work as
&gt;  &gt; required when the two machines generating voice/video conference packets
&gt;  &gt; are not linux. With linux, my software will work at 50% efficiency.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;  So write your application differently.  Unless you're looking 
&gt; forward to being able to say, "I wrote the only network application in
&gt; history which works better on Windows than Linux" on your resume'.

But it isn't an application. It's kernel software _below_ IP in the
protocol stack. And it must conform with an RFC. And I intend to write
it in conformance to the RFC - not kludged to work with linux.
If it was a private protocol I was implementing, I'd modify it
to work with linux. 
So I will be writing in my report that 50% efficiency will be experienced
in the case of conference source nodes which run linux.
Therefore NetMeeting should be used instead of GnomeMeeting for
purposes of aceptance testing.

I actually _want_ linux to be better in all things.
But the facts are against me in this case.

============================================
By the way, ethereal has turned out to be a real star in this work
I'm doing right now. It's got a great range of application protocol
interpreters and a user-friendly way to associate them with streams.
It does a stunning job on RTP and RTCP protocols.
That's saved me weeks of work.
For a while I stopped using ethereal because it used to be stodgy.
Now it's a real pleasure to use.

I was also delighted by the functionality of another chunk of
free software - ohphone (OpenH323), which I believe is written
by an Australian company. This has built-in stats info which is
excellent for people developing software.

So the free-software applications have worked delightfully, but
the linux kernel has an "issuse". 
I guess I'll fight it out in the kernel developers' mailing list
as soon as I get some spare time and energy.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
