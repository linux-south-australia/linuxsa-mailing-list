I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of using the Debian Bug Tracking
system versus the Mozilla Bug Tracking System. Specifically here's the
situation:

1) We have a system based on Debian
   - some of which we have tweaked

2) We want to receive ALL the bug reports from our customers
   - using some kind of bug reporting tool

3) We'll forward any valid reports onto the Debian project ourselves
   - i.e. if we determine that "it's not our problem" then we'll forward
     it to bugs.debian.org

Now, we've got a toss up between the Debian BTS and Mozilla.

Currently I'm thinking:


Debian BTS:

 Pros:
 - it's natively understands the Debian system
 - it can be manipulated totally by e-mail
 - it stores all things in a text backend (no sql servers etc etc)
 - it behaves just like bugs.debian.org
 - it's collaboratively managed

 Cons:
 - the lack of an sql server is a con too
 - it's hideously difficult to set up
 - it's lack of documentation on set up makes me wish it had a Windows
    Help file
 - I can't find any pre-built "nice" interfaces (GUI toolkit/web-based
    or otherwise) to use it


Bugzilla:

 Pros:
 - it's UI is highly configurable
 - it's security settings seem more fine-grained than the Debian BTS
 - it uses an SQL backend
 - it's easy to setup (apt-get does most of it for you)

 Cons:
 - it's not a Debian-specific product and needs to be set up to
    understand what we're doing
 - it's very, very, very complex to use as a user [I can never get my
    head around a bugzilla submit page and the users who will be using
    this thing would probably just give up]
 - it uses an SQL backend

*hmmm*

/me ponders

Any thoughts on this?
