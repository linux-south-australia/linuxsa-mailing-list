&gt; &gt; I originally adopted Debian because I thought that it would enable me to
&gt; &gt; keep up to date with recent software, but would remain more stable than
&gt; &gt; RedHat (and I don't like RadHat for a variety of reasons). Evidently,
&gt; &gt; this isn't the focus of Debian, and it seems that FreeBSD (and possibly
&gt; &gt; gentoo) might be able to give me similar stability, but more up-to-date
&gt; &gt; packages.
&gt; 
&gt; You're sounding like an end-user.  A person with your technical prowess
&gt; should use a distribution as a starting point, and download whatever
&gt; source updates you think you need from each separate 'package' maintainer.
&gt; 
I tend to agree with this philosophy, but there are some qualifications
to it...

&gt; I've previously complained about point-n-click, that it takes away the
&gt; need for deep knowledge of the system, and leaves a knowledge vacuum in
&gt; return.  Your complaint with Debian pretty much illustrates what I said.
&gt; (Obviously you do have a deep knowledge of your system, but your using
&gt; it less and less.)
&gt; 
There are so many things that you need to know and should know about
your operating environment and starting from a distribution is often an
easy way to be able to get a good grounding.  However, there comes a
point for all mortal people where there is too much to know.  It is at
this point where mere mortals begin to rely on "experts".

Do all Systems Administrators need to be experts when it comes to all
the operating environments that they deal with on a regular basis? 
(That would mean that I have to have expert knowledge of Microsoft
Windows XP/2K/ME, RedHat 7.1 to latest, FreeBSD 4.5 to current, OpenBSD
2.8 - latest, SunOS 5.51 to Solaris 9 and MacOS 8 to - MacOSX 10.2 (or
however it's actually written) - yeah, right).Is it too much to ask that
some experts have created distributions appropriate to a bunch of
individuals' needs?

My opinion is that it is useful to be an expert in at least one distro. 
Choose your distro, be aware of it's inadequacies and strengths, know
that for some servers, there are specific differences, document the
differences precisely and have functional systems.  This is not too hard
if you're an expert in one system because the concepts are generally the
same throughout all the operating environments available.

There are certainly definite advantages to keeping Linux distributions
close to their distributor supported packages, but then again, this
isn't always useful to the task at hand.  This is where keeping
configure options in CVS or similar under the machine-service name come
in very handy in case of emergency (of course, this isn't as appropriate
for the micro$oft operating systems, but it certainly covers most of the
open source OSs and unices which are perhaps one and the same).

My advice to Richard is to continue using Debian (although I don't use
it personally) because it has already met a number of his needs.  Use
the source, become "expert" in the use of Debian, know what happens when
you need to use latest and greatest applications/whatever, thoroughly
document the changes and be happy.
