&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm having problem with my MA401 and MA301 NetGear cards under Linux. 
&gt; In
&gt; both cases, I'm running Debian 3.0 release with a 2.4.20 kernel (that's
&gt; been slightly patched). Neither card seem to work with any of the
&gt; modules that the documentation claim they should.
&gt;
&gt; The driver from the netgear site locks my machine, as does the stuff
&gt; from linux-wlan.org (which is where the netgear stuff is derived
&gt; anyway). :-(

The netgear drivers have always sucked.  The MA301 cards use either 
tulip or natsemi, off memory, and some other strange chipset too that I 
don't usually compile as a module.

P*sses me off when companies change chipset but keep the product the 
same - guy I work with bought 6 DWL-520's (wireless cards that can be 
used as access points) off ebay, thinking they were the same as the 
other DWL-520's we had, but alas, they use a completely different 
chipset.

And no, they wernt DWL-520+'s.  Exactly the same bloody product name, 
and the boxes for each card are almost identical, except one's white 
instead of blue.

&gt; The funny thing is (well, Greg might disagree :-)) that both work very
&gt; nicely using the wi driver in the FreeBSD 5.0 kernel running on the 
&gt; same
&gt; hardware.

I've always seemed to have more access with networking devices under 
FreeBSD then with Linux - if you haven't got a standard(ish) card, 
wierd things tend to happen, whereas FreeBSD tends to behave itself.  
Better written drivers?

R

&gt; Has anyone out there solved a similar problem or have any suggestions
&gt; for getting this stuff working under Linux?
