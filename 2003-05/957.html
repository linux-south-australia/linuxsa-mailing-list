&gt;&gt; It's difficult to say what that is.

&gt; "That" is a widget with the title "NuDizT.jpg" and the description "JPEG

&gt;&gt; MUAs shouldn't make assumptions about how people work, nor how
&gt;&gt; important they consider their data.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe not - but offering an app that works in a way that many people
&gt; might like isn't wrong IMHO.  Nobody is _forced_ to use it (except to
&gt; research a presentation, perhaps :-) )

One of my concerns is that people end up using this kind of software,
not because it's good, but because it's there.

&gt;&gt; To change from threaded to non-threaded displays (a thing I do
&gt;&gt; several times a day) appears to require reconfiguration.
&gt;
&gt; Yes it does.  This has the effect that sorting by (eg) size has some
&gt; strange-looking results when threading is turned on. So mutt would be
&gt; superior in that regard.

Heh.  See Daniel's message.  It is possible with just two key strokes,
but it's badly documented.  Still, as Daniel says, KMail is like mutt
in that respect.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [Kmail]  Works just fine for me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It appears that it doesn't.  That's how we started this discussion.
&gt;
&gt; Touche  :-)
&gt;
&gt; I still wonder why one person can send me a jpg file attach and I can
&gt; handle it with ease (the M$ way - sorry!  :-)  ) wheras stuff from
&gt; lca2004 digest comes as MIME text.

It's all MIME.  I'm not sure what it tickling your KMail, especially
since "It works for me".
