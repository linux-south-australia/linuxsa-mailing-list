Hi Guy's,
sorry to butt in but this stopped me
As a ham radio operator I can tell you this  two line are not quite true 
you see before I became a ham radio operator I Had a
Kenwood  ts-120v  which is a  SSB all band radio  80meter 40 meters and 
15 and 10 meter usb and lsb cw  I was studying for my Ham radio License 
but did not have it guess what  I got caught with it no not using it it 
was packed up on my work bench at home  I was at tech  my ex-wife 
answered the door and there was a local police man and a ACA  person the 
came in asked my wife to plug the radio in and get it working she did 
not have a clue but to cut a long store short I got fined $70  and had a 
week to sell the radio..
I had is sent to Hobart to a radio shop who made some mod so it would 
not transmit and left it as a receiver and was allowed to keep it then 
but only after I showed them the doc from the repair shop where I had it 
done and they contacted them..
so that was my experience .

I repeat I was not using the radio it was there for when I passed my ham 
radio exams (no power no antenna not connected)
cheers for now ..

&gt;(note that anyone can buy any radio they want, whether or not they have
&gt;a license.  it's operating that radio that requires the license)
&gt;
