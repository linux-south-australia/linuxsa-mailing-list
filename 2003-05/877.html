&gt;I need work, im 17 well skilled in IT (check resume) and ready 
&gt;too learn more.
&gt;Ive been offered several trainiships so far, but as always 
&gt;there is no training just cheap labour.

My advice would be to take up one of the traineeships that you're
being offered.  At 17 I would regard that as your best chance to
get into the industry, as a traineeship will offer you both educational
and vocational qualifications, even if you regard it as "cheap labour".  
Take any opportunity you can get, you'll be surprised where it can lead, 
if, as you say, you are well skilled in IT and ready to learn more...

PS If you think that advice sucks, that's fine, but at 17 I was in a 
similar position and took up a traineeship in IT, only 6 years ago.
That year of "cheap labour" was the stepping stone to where I am right now,
managing IT for a regional health service...
