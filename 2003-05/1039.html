This one time, at band camp, "Richard Russell" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt; You may do whatever you want. However, if you indiscriminately accuse me
&gt; of spam, which you have (that's the only thing that your rejection email
&gt; does), and give me no way of saying "no, this isn't spam" (if you reject
&gt; all mail, I can't contact you), and refuse to fix your broken setup

Its not broken, it is working exactly the way I set it up. It is sendmail
and that is the behavior of the beast. As for the 'indescrimante' accusation
of spam, it is just basic message from sendmail, directly out of the docs
as it goes. Never really say much point in saying more. So now it reads..
ERROR:"550  This domain has been identified as a source of SPAM"

I really dont see the need to write an essay on it.

&gt; 
&gt; You will ALWAYS get spam. ALWAYS. There is NO KNOWN WAY of getting rid
&gt; of all of it. 

No arguement there...

&gt; Every other way (spamassassin etc) is less indiscriminate,
and less effective

&gt; and most of them at least give people a way of finding out why they have
&gt; been blocked. Even using rbls gives more fine-grained control than
&gt; 202.*, and, importantly, lets users know what they can do to get off the
&gt; blackhole list.
As I mentioned in an earlier mail, I have listened to people and removed that block
Why do you persist with it?

Kind regards
kevin
