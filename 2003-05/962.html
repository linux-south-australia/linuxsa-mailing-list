Hi.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What you're saying is that you have voluntarily cut off access from more 
&gt; &gt; than 10% of Australia to your customers? Do you inform your customers of 
&gt; &gt; this before they sign up with you?
&gt; 
&gt; This is a FREE service, customers are advised that there is strict control
&gt; of spam, including some services in .au
&gt; If customers do not like it, they are free to take their domains to another
&gt; hosting service.

Note to RR: 

Not taking sides either way on the rights or wrongs of Kevin's actions, but this
brings the point I was making into absolute focus. Everytime Kevin or one of the
other thousands of mail admins makes a decision like this, or someone tries to
tune up their RBL rules, YOU will have to deal with it for your domain. No-one
else will do it for you. If on the other hand, an ISP cops it, they are going to
complain with a bigger stick and find their way onto Kevin's whitelist (you do
have one, don't you Kevin?) with a lot less hassle because they have the weight of
users on their back, probably hassling the hell out of them as well.

The ISP's will find out about them sooner too, and probably have them fixed before
you even need to mail into that system.

Regards, and thanks for the heads-up Kevin.

Michael

&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards
&gt; Kevin
