&gt;&gt; Hey,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; A quote from an interview on OSnews with the FreeBSD core team:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news">http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news</A> id=3415
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; "FreeBSD is a *system*, not a kernel with a bunch of other stuff thrown on top
&gt;&gt; to make a "distro."
&gt;
&gt; What about this quote from one of the commenters? :)
&gt;
&gt; The personalities here are interesting

&gt; Lehey exhibits all the worst things I have heardabout the BSD culture: he's
&gt; snobby and argumentative and can't stop promoting himself (see the plugs
&gt; for his books). But the other guy, Warner, seems to have his head on
&gt; straight and really know what he's talking about. I say promote the latter
&gt; and give the former the boot.
&gt;
&gt; *looks at Greg*

/me feels his ears burning.

Look where that message came from.  lariat.org.  Some of the other
messages also came from that domain.

I have had a major difference of opinion a certain Brett Glass,
<A HREF="mailto:brett@lariat.org.">brett@lariat.org.</A>  The differences of opinion were shared by the rest
of the FreeBSD core team, and we were discussing throwing him off the
mailing lists, but I was the primary target of his wrath.  I'm
surprised he didn't state his name here: usually he is out to have his
name seen everywhere.  I think he realises that if he did so here, it
would detract from his message.

Brett is a flaming anti-GPL person, which also makes him anti-Linux.
He is continually flogging dead horses.  In the December 2000 issue of
the Daemon's advocate
(<A HREF="http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200012/dadvocate.html">http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200012/dadvocate.html</A>):, I quoted him
without mentioning his name; see "The rabble rousers".  He read it and
wrote to me:

&gt; Date: Wed, 13 Dec 2000 10:16:18 -0700
&gt; From: Brett Glass &lt;<A HREF="mailto:brett@lariat.org">brett@lariat.org</A>&gt;
&gt; To: Greg Lehey &lt;<A HREF="mailto:grog@lemis.com">grog@lemis.com</A>&gt;
&gt; Subject: Copyright violation
&gt; X-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Version 4.3.2
&gt; 
&gt; Have just read the most recent Daemon News, and have discovered that you have posted a substantial excerpt of something 
&gt; +I have written without attribution. The amount of text you included goes beyond the limits of fair use, and your
&gt; +failure to acknowledge authorship is a violation of the Berne Convention and hence international copyright law -- not
&gt; +to mention journalistic ethics. Kindly remove the material NOW.

I discussed it with the Daemon News editors, and we decided to leave
it there.  Next time, though
(<A HREF="http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200202/dadvocate.html">http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200202/dadvocate.html</A>), I gave an
attribution.  He complained again, this time claiming that I was
trying to defame him, though I published nothing that wasn't on public
mailing lists.  For the following article I wrote:

  My last article aroused more interest than I've had for a while.
  Gratifyingly, almost all people who commented agreed that we need to
  be open to the GNU and Linux people.  I did have one strong
  objection, though: Brett Glass complained that I was trying to
  defame him.

  I would like to make it very clear that I have had no intention of
  defamation.  I am criticizing his approach, not his person.  In
  fact, I find him quite an agreeable person when he's not in
  GPL-bashing mode.  On a previous occasion I referred to his
  approaches without mentioning his name, and he became very upset
  about that, so I agreed to mention his name if I referred to him
  again.  And of course he is welcome to submit an article explaining
  his point of view.

I was going to give the URL of this article, but I see the editors
removed this text without telling me.

Comments?
