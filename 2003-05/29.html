&gt; "Much of the cuts will be made possible by falling equipment costs in an
&gt; ultra-competitive market and the possible dumping of expensive software
&gt; licences.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Smith is an avowed fan of so-called open source software, which attracts
&gt; a fraction of the licence fees associated with companies like Microsoft. "
&gt; 
&gt; what stinks is the job cuts and the paying dirt cheap wages to Indian
&gt; programmers.  i can't find the news article any more, but Telstra is paying
&gt; 100 programers working in india the equvilant of $12,000AUD a year.
&gt; nothing against India but it's sad to see them go that way....

I saw an article about this on a site recently that was pushing open 
source software, and the claim was made that many companies were forced to 
use off-shore programmers because they were paying so much in licence 
costs. 

The article also pointed out that using off-shore labour has risks 
associated with it, so if their costs go down elsewhere, they might be 
forced to bring jobs back in-house.
