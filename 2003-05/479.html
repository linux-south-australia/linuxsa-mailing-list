Gentlemen,

&gt; &gt; The "Identification" (aka Fragment ID) field is only used for

&gt; 
&gt; Mark,
&gt; 
&gt; RFC 791, pages 8, doesn't seem to agree:
&gt; 
&gt; ===========================================
&gt; The originating protocol module of
&gt;     an internet datagram sets the identification field to a value that
&gt;     must be unique for that source-destination pair and 
&gt; protocol for the
&gt;     time the datagram will be active in the internet system. 
&gt; ===========================================

What about the Context?

------
The identification field is used to distinguish the fragments of one
    datagram from those of another.  The originating protocol module of
    an internet datagram sets the identification field to a value that
    must be unique for that source-destination pair and protocol for the
    time the datagram will be active in the internet system.  The
    originating protocol module of a complete datagram sets the
    more-fragments flag to zero and the fragment offset to zero.

I don't see that as meaning that it must set this in *every* case, only
in cases where DF is not set.

&gt; 
&gt; Some humans have also informed me in the last hour that in 
&gt; fact the linux implementation does contradict RFC 791. There 
&gt; is no indication that I can find in RFC 791 that an exception 
&gt; to the rule is made for packets with the DF bit set.

The fact that this rule is only mentioned in the context of packets with
the DF bit set might indicate that this is that case.

&gt; 
&gt; You're right about the stated purpose of the ID field.
&gt; However, when someone writes a spec and people implement that 
&gt; spec, then other people who write other specs assuming that 
&gt; everyone will implement the IP protocol according to the 
&gt; spec, it's very inconvenient when someone chooses to break 
&gt; the spec for all machine using a particular operating system, 
&gt; in this case linux. That's what's happened in this case. It's 
&gt; an embarrassment that linux has acted on the assumption that 
&gt; the RFC can be improved upon, in the just the same way that 
&gt; MS-Windows "improves" TCP 3-way handshakes to 1-way 
&gt; handshakes. In the linux case, this makes another IETF 
&gt; protocol work at 50% efficiency because of the zero ID fields.

That would, be bad, if it were the case. However, I don't think it is
the case.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; While I'm sure it'd be convenient for your application if 
&gt; the standard 
&gt; &gt; required more from the Identification field, it actually doesn't.  
&gt; &gt; It's possible that some TCP/IP stacks set it on every IP 
&gt; packet, but 
&gt; &gt; they're going above and beyond the requirements of the 
&gt; TCP/IP spec in 
&gt; &gt; doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; Nope. It isn't "convenient" for my application. It's assumed 
&gt; by another, more recent RFC.

which one, and where?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Does anyone out there happen to know if there is some 
&gt; official  &gt; 
&gt; &gt; excuse for why linux doesn't seem to do quite the right thing here?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You're making assumptions again :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Everybody makes assumptions. Some assumptions are correct, 
&gt; and some are not. You can't function without assumptions in a 
&gt; complex world. And notice that little word "seems". That's 
&gt; not an assumption, is it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Incidentally, you're probably seeing lots of packets with 
&gt; the DF bit 
&gt; &gt; set because the IP stack is attempting to use Path MTU 
&gt; discovery (RFC 
&gt; &gt; 1191, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1191.txt">ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1191.txt</A> )
&gt; 
&gt; Nope. It's because I'm running "ohphone" to generate voice 
&gt; RTP packets, which all use DF. They're coming out every 80 
&gt; mSec, although I can set it to 20 mSec. This is less than the 
&gt; "time the datagram will be active in the internet system"
&gt; for even my 19200 bits/sec null modem in the lab.

So why do you need a unique ID field? If they are set as DF, then you
can tell which packets are which by the very fact that they aren't
fragmented. What else are you using the ID field for?
