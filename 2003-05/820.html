Glen,

This sounds like a great idea. Do you mean like you could
add, say, a photo of oneself with a message saying the owner's
name etc.? If this is possible, that would be great.

I've found that even the most basic _documentation_ even on the
mainstream Toshiba laptops I've bought consists of .exe files!!*%
Now that's about as unportable as I can think of.
They seem to be sending a definite message about what they expect
you to be running on their machines.
I had to wind up my old wind95 machine to even look at the documentation,
and it wouldn't extract itself out into anything else sensible either -
you could only view the files while the .exe file was running.
So I had to take notes on paper. I hope Toshiba have got wiser since then.

But on the subject of BIOS tools, I have some vague memory that there are some
linux-based BIOS memory modification tools, aren't there?
A personalised BIOS boot screen certainly would be a discouragement to
the average thief. A few years ago there were stories of stolen linux
laptops being abandoned because they had linux on them. I guess that
wouldn't be a discouragement any more. What's needed is a very personal
sort of face, preferably with a hint of menace....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
