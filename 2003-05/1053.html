&gt; &gt; You may do whatever you want. However, if you indiscriminately accuse me
&gt; &gt; of spam, which you have (that's the only thing that your rejection email
&gt; &gt; does), and give me no way of saying "no, this isn't spam" (if you reject
&gt; &gt; all mail, I can't contact you), and refuse to fix your broken setup
&gt; 
&gt; Its not broken, it is working exactly the way I set it up. It is sendmail
&gt; and that is the behavior of the beast. As for the 'indescrimante' accusation
&gt; of spam, it is just basic message from sendmail, directly out of the docs
&gt; as it goes. Never really say much point in saying more. So now it reads..
&gt; ERROR:"550  This domain has been identified as a source of SPAM"

Kevin,

One neat little approach that I do is to replace the default message
for a 550 to "My new e-mail address is.... ".
Then a real human will see that in the bounce page and use that instead.
The spambots (so far) don't have the ability to do this.
Of course, not all users are clever enough to read the 550 error message text.

&gt; &gt; You will ALWAYS get spam. ALWAYS. There is NO KNOWN WAY of getting rid
&gt; &gt; of all of it. 
&gt; 
&gt; No arguement there...

On the other hand, some people think that the future of e-mail may look
something like this:
<A HREF="http://alankennington.com/extra/email.php">http://alankennington.com/extra/email.php</A>
This is just a mock-up. It won't actually send mail to me.
But it's similar to my real e-mail form.
Once again, the spambots ain't clever enough to know the capital of
Upper Volta. So humans get through this easily. Well, my real form
has an easier question than that. Lots and lots of people have sent
me e-mail through the genuine non-mockup email form.
Note that I don't make people type into a form - they're supposed to click
on a mailto: link as usual, but they need to pass the IQ test first.

The best approach of all is not to let one's e-mail address be seen anywhere,
and for public lists like linuxSA, use an alias which you can change when
the spambots put it in a database. And then as a last resort, use
black lists etc.
Keeping your e-mail address secret is like having a silent phone number.
Having aliases is like having variable PO Box addresses.

I used to block yahoo.com. But then two people who were of great significance
to my work had their mail bounce. Those people were so annoyed, they
never contacted me again - after being close associates previously.
So my defensive measures against spam have cost me dearly already.

Ultimately, it is a political question. You don't get rid of burglary
by putting ever-stronger locks on doors and changing address every month.
I remember the first time I heard of spam - probably around 1988 - when
someone posted an ad to every Usenet newsgroup on the net. That person
was sent so much mail, it filled their mailbox and they lost their
account on that computer. Things went downhill from that point on.
The perpetrator in question got more benefit than cost, and US Americans
think that economic self-interest and moral correctness are the same thing.
[I'm so controversial, n'est-ce pas? I should have my own chat show...]

One of the worst developments historically was the stupid anti-porn
hysteria among politicians which distracted attention from the real
threat to the Internet while giving politicians and their less
educated supporters the feeling that they were doing something to make
the net better for the general public - with the presumption that
the up-to-then net users were somehow immoral and the net was going to
be cleaned up for the kiddies. The truth was the reverse. The net used
to be a very wholesome place, and it was the advent of the ordinary
non-computing-science users which brought in the riff-raff and the
spammers and the porn etc. 
The current situation is that politicians still just "don't get it".
They sat down at their browsers for the first time a couple of years
ago and typed in the word "sex" and lo and behold, the net was
seething with sex. So that's how they got the wrong idea about what
was wrong with the net. Even now, their sysadmins get rid of most of
their spam. So they don't know what a problem it is.
Politicians' sysadmins should unblock spam to politicians for a couple
of weeks and see how they like it!

The blacklisting we are seeing now is a direct consequence of the
negligeance of politicians. Such a huge effort by sysadmins is going into 
closing down the e-mail capabilities of the net now, it's really killing
off the e-mail utility of the net. I don't give out my real e-mail address
to anyone now. Even for close friends, I make a different alias
for each friend. 
Businesses have benefitted hugely from the net as a means of
cutting staff and using a small IT crews instead to service their customers,
especially the banks. I think it's about time to stop fighting among
ourselves about how sophisticated our spam-blocking is and mount
a major campaign to get politicians to cure the spam disease
at the source instead of wasting our precious time and energy
writing software and scripts to block rich idiots with broadband
connections from flooding us with illiterate rubbish.

Myself, I've invested too much time, energy and goodwill already to set up my
current (successful) anti-spam defences. So I don't intend to lift a finger to
fix the problem for the rest of the world. I'm just going to wait
until the net melts down and corporate interests see it as in their
self-interest to tap the politicians on their shoulders to tell them
that it's time to fight the worst sort of cyber-crime: theft of
human intellectual energy.

Ergo, Kevin, I think you're 100% blameless. 
The victims of spam shouldn't be blaming each other.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
