&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Looking at colocating a server hosted locally at Internode - originally was 
&gt; going to be an Xserve, due to the fact they're only 1RU, but I'm personally 
&gt; not a huge fan of them (OS X Server has many, many issues).
&gt; 
&gt; We'd like to either cheaply (&lt;$1500) build a 1RU server, or rent out a 
&gt; namebrand x86 machine (IBM, SUN, etc), and throw Debian on it.  Thing is, I 
&gt; can't find 1RU cases for building my own systems (and I'm wondering exactly 
&gt; how expansion cards would fit in a 1RU case), or anywhere in Adelaide that'd 
&gt; sell a prebuilt 1RU (namebrand?) server, let alone on a rentsmart type deal.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got any ideas?

have a look on www.auspcmarket.com.au for cases. they have some of the
1U Skyhawk cases IIRR.

get a mainboard with everthing on it. like LAN, video, FW, USB, serial
etc...  remember 1U is much harder to cool. past experience shows that
hosting lots of 1U boxes in a rack makes it dificult to disipate as much
heat as they genterate. running temperatures are often high.  so go with
a slower CPU that generates less heat. go with slower HDDs that
genereate less heat, get lotsa fans, think about the airflow.

Intel does 2U servers in Xeon, and PIII servers in 1U.
Sun does a 1U server which is about ~ AU$3500, they are ok...

my thoughts would be to get a mainboard that was designed for a 1U
chassis. spend more on your chassis as airflow is critical, if they
designed it properly, they woulda spent more time on it and thought
about the airflow. go PIII or even a celeron, for lower heat output.
maybe SATA drives with the small profile cables, IDE bites with large
cables.  mainboard should have well supported hardware on it. get lower
profile memory, slimline CDRom and floppy.  maybe a front facing USB
port if you have a USB key/memory thing you want to use for Auth ato
console stuff (this is very handy =)

but thats going to push AU$1500 tho, as a mainboard and case is about
$1000...

cheers,

Kim
