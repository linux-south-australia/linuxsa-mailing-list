Glen,

Are you quoting from a written spec, recommendation or RFC?
Or is that just oral tradition?
Maybe you don't need it, but even the best of specs do not necessarily
explain all uses of all requirements under all circumstances.
I'm certain you know the nature of the standardisation process - lots
and lots of discussions and meetings - sometimes even prototyping
and testing and demonstrations - over many years.
The result, in my experience, is that often a very complex train of
thought that led to a feature in a spec/rec/RFC ends up being a
mere single line without explanation.

(I once wrote several hundred pages of analysis of simulation studies
for IEEE 802.6 over about a year, and the result was a single line
in the standard - with about 6 words of comment on its purpose.
The nice thing, though, was that I defeated IBM's attempt to replace a
good MAC algorithm with a bad one. It's satisfying to beat IBM.)

Sometimes a spec just says "do this" without giving an extended tutorial
on how it was decided.

Therefore for the linux community to decide that a field is "not needed"
just defeats the whole purpose of a spec.
It's not up to the implementer to toss out stuff that is not obviously
useful.

&gt;   - If the identifier is not needed then it should either
&gt;     not be set or should be randomised, as the Identifier
&gt;     can be used in port scans to discover what processes are
&gt;     running and this technique can be done without revealing
&gt;     the address of the scanner.
&gt; 
&gt;     Obviously RFC791 couldn't anticipate this.
&gt; 
&gt;        &lt;<A HREF="http://ouah.sysdoor.net/newantirez.html&gt">http://ouah.sysdoor.net/newantirez.html&gt</A>;

Then someone should write another RFC to update RFC791.
If the TOS field can be redefined, then so can the IP ID field.
And I don't believe that setting the IP ID to zero is necessarily the
best way to defeat port scans. But I have no knowledge of this particular
security issue.

&gt;   - The assumption in RFC3095 that Identifer increments
&gt;     isn't unreasonable.  It's a compression spec, so
&gt;     a guess at the most likely implementation will give
&gt;     the best results.  The option negotiation in the spec
&gt;     leaves room for a future always-zero Identifier.
&gt;     You might want to submit an Internet Draft requesting
&gt;     such an option.

RFC 3095 is already frozen in stone, of course. But there are already
suggestions that the IP-only compression profile which has not yet
been turned into an RFC should have a special "Static IP-ID" bit,
which will be used for linux UDP packets.
It's definitely on the agenda. 

=============================================
I've found it interesting to follow this discussion in two different
forums: linuxSA and the ROHC mailing list.
The contrast has such strong echos of the the 1980s when there were two
mutually incomprehending universes - the IEEE sort of world
together with computer scientists and military, versus the Telcos
as instantiated in CCITT (now ITU-T or something).
The computers versus communications mind-split is still in existence.

The ROHC crowd (RFC 3095 header compression etc., mobile telephony...)
seem to mostly think that linux has an "issue" with a faulty IP stack,
whereas from the computer networks (IETF etc.) perspective, it looks
like the ROHC crowd have made a blunder.
In my opinion, they both have. The linux IP stack is wrong and
the ROHC should have taken linux zero-IP-ID into account.
They obviously just didn't test a single linux machine during the
years of developing the spec.
If only they had had a linux developer like me in the working group!

=============================================
Here's a little summary of what I found in the ROHC mailing list:

Reply number 1:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&gt; Is there an obvious way to solve the problem of the constant value
&gt; of the IP header Identifier field for UDP/IP from linux boxes?

Constant IP-ID?? It looks to me a faulty implementation (of IP stack)
which defeats the exact purpose of IP-ID (see RFC 791).
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

That's one vote against linux.

Reply number 2 (Actually not a direct reply - just happened to be on the 
identical topic):

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
[...] we also have a sugesstion of how the problem with
IP-ID = 0 could be solved. IP-ID should not be zero, but we have detected that
+it
is zero when sending package in a local network. The condition is that both the
source and destination are members in the same submask-network. The DF-flag is
also set in the package. Even if this behavior seems to be odd, all the packages
is correct accoriding to the standard. This have been found in the Linux
implementation (kernel 2.4.20). Other OS may have the same "problem".
[...]

IP-ID == 0:

One solution on the IP-ID equal to zero problem is to add a flag (SID) that says
if the ID-field is static.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is sort of half a vote for and half against.
Score so far: 1.5 against to 0.5 for.
But this is interesting. He's saying that linux will only do this
IP-ID = 0 for source/destination on the same LAN. If so, then
linux will _not_ have problems in reality. But I can't test
this because I don't have two sites to test ohphone across.

I had faced the same problem earlier (check list archives). Since the
Linux stack behaviour is non standard, I guess its upto the Linux guys
to fix it.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is definitely a vote against linux.
Score = 2.5 to 0.5, running against linux.

Reply number 4 was from the guy who invented ROHC, as I understand it:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Thanks for clarifying this. It is thus not really an invalid
stack implementation, but it is indeed a little bit odd.
However, this should not be a big problem for scenarios where
ROHC would actually be implemented, right? It is more of
a typical "test environment problem".
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

He seems to be saying that linux is not noncompliant.
I'd count this as a vote for linux.
Score: 2.5 to 1.5, running against linux.

Unfortunately, he seems to be implying that no one in the real world
is going to use a linux box for audio/video to a G3 phone.  Hmmm...

Reply number 5 is from the inventor again:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I guess I better correct myself on this statement:

&gt; Thanks for clarifying this. It is thus not really an invalid
&gt; stack implementation, but it is indeed a little bit odd.

Actually, it can probably be considered an incorrect
implementation as it would not comply with the rule of
RFC 791:
"Thus, the sender must choose the Identifier to be unique
for the source, destination pair and protocol for the time
the datagram (or any fragment of it) could be alive in the
internet."

However, if one considers the purpose of the Identification
field and the intent with the above text (i.e. the above is
an obvious consequence of how fragmentation/reassembly is
defined), one could claim that the Identification is not
used if DF is set, and that the above text would not apply
in that case.

Anyway, for us this is not a very big problem. We might want
to make ROHC handle this case better, but I do not think
it is a core issue. Neither should we waste our time trying
to agree on whether there is a Linux error or not.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Well, now he's cancelled out his vote in favour of linux.
At the very least, he's cancelled out his pro-linux vote, and
arguably given his vote entirely against linux. But I'll just
leave his previous vote in place.
Current score: 3.5 to 1.5, running against linux.

Reply number 6 from someone else:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We came across a similar problem when testing the packet formats for the TCP/IP
profile, e.g. in the following flow carrying HTTP:

45000028454440004006e7e0c176c1b2c176c90b80540050bc2e8cd16e1bbbe45010f53cb9470000

The behaviour of the Linux stack is even weirder in the TCP/IP case than for
the UDP/IP case, because it chooses to set the IP-ID to 0 for certain packets
only (typically at the beginning and the end of the flow).

&gt;From the perspective of the IP-only profile, a "perfect" solution to the
+problem
would therefore require a new packet format which allows the IP-ID to
occasionally deviate from its expected behaviour. However, I think that this
would be overkill to solve what is only a minor problem - the proposal to add
a SID flag to the IR-DYN packet looks like a good idea because it addresses the
issue at a very low cost.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Well, that really puts the rat among the pigs.
Linux can't even keep the ID sequence going according to a simple
increment rule for TCP.
I would say that this "wierdness" comment is at least half a vote
against linux. 
Final score: 4 against linux, 1.5 in favour.

I think the linuxSA votes would be roughly round the reverse of this
but in about the same proportions. I ain't going to count....
I've got to go to the fruit/veg shop now.
Otherwise I'm going to get nightblindness, beri-beri and rickets
sitting in front of this monitor 16 hours a day.

Cheers and ferrets to all who gave feedback...
(And hamsters for those kept out of it.)
