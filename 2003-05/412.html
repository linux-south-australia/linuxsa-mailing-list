&gt; (And, for what it's worth, the regulatory situation is almost identical
&gt; today, excepting that the number of modem manufacturers has decreased,
&gt; the multinationals who sell modems these days care enough about the
&gt; Australian market to get their equipment tested for regulatory compliance
&gt; in Australia, the Government organization which performs the regulation
&gt; is different, and you now take your equipment to an approved third-party
&gt; testing centre instead of Austel's testing labs)

With one major exception.  You can now do "proof by design" to
meet the ACA criteria.  So the presentation of engineering
documentation showing the steps taken to prevent, say, ingress
of 240V into the phone pair is adequate.  This is a major
advance on actual testing -- which is a lot more expensive.

&gt; I'm not convinced that there's a problem there.  Who, exactly, has had
&gt; their comms disrupted, and how much money have they lost?

No one, yet.  The front-end receivers of the newer 802.11a chipsets
are impressive -- coverage of the complete 5GHz band with nice
rejection characteristics.

So any user of 5GHz space could find their frequencies used.  This
isn't good -- you might consider the mess in the 27Mhz band when
people tweaked a few kHz out of the CB band.

The worst case would be that the entire 5GHz band would became
hostile to non-WLAN applications.

To an extent the regulators have bought this upon themselves.  A
world-wide allocation would have lead to chipsets with less frequency
coverage.

There's also a fair whack of irresponsibility by the
chipset maker.  Incidently the one mentioned in relationship
to misuse of NTP servers :-(
