Chris,

It's interesting to see this spectrum enforcement from the historical
perspective. During WW2 (which I did not personally witness), private
citizens - the amateur radio people - were forbidden to use radio
at all except to help the war. Some govts, e.g. the USA, thought they
wouldn't give back the ham bands after the war, but there were some
voices which argued that for the next war there would be no ham expertise
available unless the hams had a few bands to play with between wars. 

Reluctantly, governments let amateur radio exist after WW2, but the conditions
were strict:
-	You had to be able to send and receive 15 words/minute of morse.
-	You needed to be able to design an entire SSB circuit using
	beam tetrodes in a 3-hour exam along with lots of other circuits
	and the regulations.
-	Every radio transmitter had to be individually licensed.
	Changes of address had to be notified.
-	You had to log every communication you made.
-	You weren't allowed to communicate with some foreign powers.
-	Your transmissions were monitored by govt people in every city to
	make sure you didn't get out of your tiny bands.
	The technical exams were intended to make sure you had the
	_competence_ to stay inside your band. The regulations exams
	made sure you couldn't claim ignorance of the laws.
-	In case of emergency (e.g. war), any govt authority could commandeer 
	your rig and either use it themselves or require you to operate
	it for their communciations.
-	Otherwise it was completely forbidden to use the rig for
	third party comms.

I think there were prison penalties for transmitting outside your band.
Fellow hams would warn you quickly if they saw your frequency drifting
out of band.

Now I compare this with the modern situation.
Licensing is so slack now that anyone can get a transmitter, and
enforcement doesn't seem that strict either. 
I once complained about interference to overseas HF band stations I was
listening to and the govt enforcement guy said he could only
take action if Australian commercial stations were being interfered with.
I guess nowadays spectrum is just a commodity whereas it used to be
a sovereign national asset.

So I see a simple solution to the problem of 802.11 units being programmed
to go out of band:
-	Only sell these units to people with licences.
-	Only give 802.11 operator's licences to people after they
	have passed a morse test and shown an ability to design
	SSB transceivers using beam tetrodes (or pentodes).
-	Monitor and prosecute people who are out of band, whether
	or not they're interfering with a commercial transmission. 

So there's my solution - give'm tetrodes and morse! Or the modern equivalent.
I.e. it's the operator's responsibility to obey the law, and every
802.11 operator should have a licence which requires them to
demonstrate a full understanding of the regulations and technical competence.
They should pass a test and sign to the licence conditions.
No problem.
But I guess the Oz govt's already signed some trade agreement which says
that we can't restrict trade in this way. Goodbye sovereignty....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
