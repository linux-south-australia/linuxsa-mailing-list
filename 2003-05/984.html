No, not at all. If the writers that dropped loads of excess recyclable 
horse excretions upon you had thought for a moment what it was to be 17 
again and having come through what is best a mediocre school system 
then they might have given you the benefit of the doubt and focussed on 
encouragement rather than what eventuated.

Yes there were problems with your writing, we knew that, but our 
schooling was much more pedantic about the niceties of communication 
and perhaps we were even more responsive, yes, they used the cane back 
in my days.

Might I add that I found your request and the responses very helpful to 
me just today.  I was talking to a salesman who had called on another 
matter and the discussion came around to how his son should be thinking 
about the next step once he finishes Year 12 this year. With the 
background I was able to share with him from this topic I am sure I 
have helped in some way to guide a youngster onto a career for the 
future.

Thankyou for having the guts to ask the question and thanks to all the 
kind folks who have shared their ideas. This is why I think LinuxSA is 
one of the best lists out there. All please take a bow.

OK, now back to the flamewars...

Cheers,  Ian
