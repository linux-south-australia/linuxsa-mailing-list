 &gt; Is there any company out there still putting cable up on light poles?

No.  Telstra stopped laying new cable about a fortnight after Optus
stopped.

 &gt; After much complaining to Telstra and getting the result I knew I would
 &gt; get. I am really quite dismayed at the whole broadband saga.
 &gt; I live in an old suburb 5k's from the city and have a rim installed on
 &gt; my exchange. They absolutely have no intention of changing it...

You might still be ok, though -- When Telstra retrofit RIMs to old
areas, they often cut local phone services at the pit next to the RIM
and rejumper them onto it.

That means there's often straight-through cable between the pit next
to the RIM and the exchange which is unused.  It just sits there with
nothing connected to either end of it.

Telstra has recently made a change to their wholesale ordering process
which means that cable can be used if it exists.  It doesn't help everyone,
but if you submit an ADSL order and it's rejected due to "Incompatible
Infrastructure" then you ask the ISP to resubmit the order with a 
request for a search to be made for clear copper.

If that search is successful, then your home phone line will be taken off
the RIM and jumpered on the old copper.  Telstra will charge a fee for
this to happen (which is why you have to ask your ISP -- It doesn't 
happen automatically).  Then you'll be able to resubmit your ADSL order.

Note that paying that fee doesn't necessarily guarantee ADSL: The disused
copper will inevitably be fairly old, so when you resubmit your ADSL 
order there's a non-zero chance that it'll be rejected because the line
loss is too high (and if that happens you won't get the changeover fee
back).

This is all fairly recent.  It was privately announced to us for trial
purposes in February, and formalized by Telstra last month.  If you've
previously had ADSL rejected then you have nothing to lose by applying
again to see if you can be taken off the RIM.
