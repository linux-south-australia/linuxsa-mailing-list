Hi.

Maths or statistics... Damn Lies ?

* Alan Kennington &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ak.linuxsa@topology.org">ak.linuxsa@topology.org</A>&gt; [2003-05-15 12:12]:
&gt; Barney,
&gt; 
&gt; You're only missing the fact that internet telephony software
&gt; tends to send 20 to 80 mSec of sound in a packet.
&gt; E.g. 20 mS of sound for 2.5 kbit/sec LPC10 voice compression - such as
&gt; the ADF has been using for at least 8 years, I think, or is
&gt; that CELP or something - would give you about 7 bytes of payload per packet.
&gt; So if you reduce 40 bytes of IP/UDP/RTP header down to 1 or 2 bytes,

Okay, that's a packet of what? 8-9 bytes

&gt; that's a big improvement. If you reduce to 3 or 4 bytes, then that's
&gt; only half a good. I used the marketing definition of percentage, which is

And I think that makes 10-11 bytes

&gt; to calculate it by dividing by the smallest number that has any relevance
&gt; to the issue so as to get the largest percentage.
&gt; Everybody does it - even academics in seminars.
&gt; 
&gt; More typical would be G.723.1 at about 6 kbits/sec with 20 or 24 
&gt; bytes per payload. That's what NetMeeting uses.

Add the compressed headers for 21-26bytes vs 23-28bytes per packet. 

Neither of these sums add up to anything like 50%, more like worst case of
(Marketing calc) 25% and best case of what? 8% rounded up.

The 50% sounds great, gets attention, but you can't watch and listen to headers.

&gt; I've heard of people using 1.2 kbits/sec voice comms.
&gt; But you need special training to recognize words.

Heh. Had a character from New Delhi on the phone today, trying to flog Optus. I
think he was using 1.2 kbits/sec :)

&gt; 
&gt; The short packets have an advantage over 4-frames-to-a-packet
&gt; packets because your packet loss probability in a noisy environment
&gt; (e.g. 3G networks) goes up quickly for long packets - and your latency
&gt; goes up a bit too, especially with multiple hops.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a really useful table of overheads:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.openh323.org/docs/bandwidth.html">http://www.openh323.org/docs/bandwidth.html</A>
&gt; This explains the drastic cost of IP/UDP/RTP - and you can see why
&gt; 3G networks will not like VoIP getting into their networks without
&gt; a bit of header compression - and that's why they invested a lot
&gt; of time and effort in getting rid of the headers while maintaining
&gt; end-to-end header transparency. 
&gt; 
&gt; Voice and data are not being to be integrated over 3G networks without
&gt; successful header compression.
&gt; And in marketing terms, the enemies of linux _will_ say that
&gt; with linux VoIP to a 3G handset, you will have twice the packet
&gt; header overhead as with MS software. 

Which leads us to the inevitable question about the motives of the people
developing the RFC in the first place...

Maybe someone will get into the kernel and provide a build option for "3G header
compression wierdness" ...

Regards,

Michael
