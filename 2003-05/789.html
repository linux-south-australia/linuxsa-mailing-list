Is all this trouble with SeNet really recent?

As far as I know SeNet has been disolved into Ozemail by order from 
WorldCom.
If my information is correct from a friend who just lost his job on 
helpdesk there cause they were being shut down,
then all SeNet customers are already dialing into the OzEmail system 
without knowing it. If that's the case, then maybe they
have also re-routed the help desk number to a section of OzEMail 
dedicated to taking on the existing SeNet userbase.

Just a thought,

Nathan MIllhouse

&gt;Yeah, I recently had a non-award-winning SENet experience...
&gt;
&gt;After being on hold for *45* minutes (despite the automatic system
&gt;estimating hold times of under 20 minutes...  they must use the same time
&gt;estimation algorithm as Microsoft Installer) I got greeted with a very
&gt;unhelpful Tech who seemed to want nothing more than to get me off the line
&gt;to deal with the next question.
&gt;
&gt;I was just after an FTP password for one of my website clients, who'd lost
&gt;his password and didn't have time to sit about on hold to ask about a bunch
&gt;of stuff he didn't understand anyway.
&gt;
&gt;After some brief dialogue, the person evidently couldn't be bothered dealing
&gt;with me any more, because he HUNG UP on me !  I followed up immediately with
&gt;an email to SENet Tech Support saying that this was inappropriate customer
&gt;service, and haven't heard a thing since.
&gt;
&gt;You'd think they'd look after their site hosting clients, because surely
&gt;there's more money in that than Dialup ISP services ??  And negative word of
&gt;mouth never helped ANYONE'S business !  I'm going to recommend to my client
&gt;that he shift his hosting to someone a bit more helpful...

&gt;
&gt;Oddly enough, a friend was just having a good grumble about senet. she
&gt;recently had her win98 box reformatted and reinstalled (my idea of fun,
&gt;NOT!.)
&gt;
&gt;put in senet setup disk - modem issues. resolved modem issues for her.
&gt;
&gt;still, after that, there was still error 691 (from memory). now, thats a
&gt;username/passwd error. the tech guys told her it was mdoem error. she drives
&gt;from pt adelaide to her just to have me correct her username - it needed to
&gt;have @senet.net,au or whatever added to it.
&gt;
&gt;now :
&gt;1) the setup cd didnt indicate this.
&gt;2 the tech guys SHOULD have checked that that at very least was correct.
&gt;
&gt;she said her response times with them for tech support have been growing
&gt;steadily worse, and was fed up with them. when her contract runs out, she
&gt;will be another exiting customer.
&gt;
&gt;i believe senet have been bought out by one of the major national isp
&gt;players
&gt;- coincidence?

&gt;&gt;Hi.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Am I alone in my frustration with SeNet?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The problems I've been having with senet cannot possibly be isolated to
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;me:
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Lousy Voice response system 15+ minutes for just about any business
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;hours
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;call
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Inability to respond in a timely manner to tech queries
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Reticence to hand out direct phone numbers to customers with ongoing
&gt;&gt;problems, requiring them to use the Voice Response system, thereby wasting
&gt;&gt;their time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Support staff do not have the authority or quick access to anyone with
&gt;&gt;authority to solve simple problems.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Failure to carry out promised actions, resulting in interuption of
&gt;&gt;services.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Large infrastructure changes within the organisation, disrupting
&gt;&gt;services, esp web services.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I've been a SeNet customer since the early days, Steve Baxter even came
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;out
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;to my house to set up my first ever internet connection. He and Chris
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Foote
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;had a lot of fun helping me with an install of linux (Slackware 1.2.13)
&gt;&gt;onto an IBM Thinkpad.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;All that is behind me know, I think I will be in the market for a new ISP
&gt;&gt;very shortly, the time costs of dealing with such an unreachable and
&gt;&gt;unresponsive organisation in this day and age is unacceptable.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sorry to vent this to the list, but it saddens me to see a good business
&gt;&gt;like SeNet go so far downhill. (and I'm frustrated to hell and back with
&gt;&gt;the difficulties their problems have forced on me) Maybe the 'All you can
&gt;&gt;eat' customers don't know what it used to be like, so this is 'normal' for
&gt;&gt;them.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I don't believe the problems are because of the staff, who all seem quite
&gt;&gt;reasonable. It's the pressure they are placed under, and the lack of
&gt;&gt;authority they are given to make a decision within their roles.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Regards,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Michael
