Several years ago, I read a little article about a company that was
seemingly being successful in producing clear, multi-layered compact
discs that could hold anything up to 100GB. The company was called
Constellation 3D. Wired News have an interesting background article[1]
on the company.

Recently, I had cause to start investigating them again. For a
spit-second, I thought there was something wrong with my Internet
connection, as the company's website, <A HREF="http://www.c-3d.net/">http://www.c-3d.net/</A> didn't want
to load.

However, I found some more information[2] today that states that the
company filed for bankruptcy in December of last year.

I'm a little surprised that they went under in some ways (and not, in
others), due to the fact that they seemed to have some rather
remarkable technology in their possesion.

Does anyone know what's happening with the technology, or have any
background on the "how's" and "why's" of their demise?

Cheers,

   - andrew
