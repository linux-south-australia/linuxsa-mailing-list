I've never had any problems with the all you can eat package,  been 
using it for only a year or so. I'm not familiar with any support issues 
tho cos i've never used it.

&gt;Hi.
&gt;
&gt;Am I alone in my frustration with SeNet?
&gt;
&gt;The problems I've been having with senet cannot possibly be isolated to me:
&gt;
&gt;* Lousy Voice response system 15+ minutes for just about any business hours call
&gt;
&gt;* Inability to respond in a timely manner to tech queries
&gt;
&gt;* Reticence to hand out direct phone numbers to customers with ongoing problems,
&gt;requiring them to use the Voice Response system, thereby wasting their time.
&gt;
&gt;* Support staff do not have the authority or quick access to anyone with authority
&gt;to solve simple problems.
&gt;
&gt;* Failure to carry out promised actions, resulting in interuption of services.
&gt;
&gt;* Large infrastructure changes within the organisation, disrupting services, esp
&gt;web services.
&gt;
&gt;I've been a SeNet customer since the early days, Steve Baxter even came out to my
&gt;house to set up my first ever internet connection. He and Chris Foote had a lot of
&gt;fun helping me with an install of linux (Slackware 1.2.13) onto an IBM Thinkpad.
&gt;
&gt;All that is behind me know, I think I will be in the market for a new ISP very
&gt;shortly, the time costs of dealing with such an unreachable and unresponsive
&gt;organisation in this day and age is unacceptable.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to vent this to the list, but it saddens me to see a good business like
&gt;SeNet go so far downhill. (and I'm frustrated to hell and back with the
&gt;difficulties their problems have forced on me) Maybe the 'All you can eat'
&gt;customers don't know what it used to be like, so this is 'normal' for them.
&gt;
&gt;I don't believe the problems are because of the staff, who all seem quite
&gt;reasonable. It's the pressure they are placed under, and the lack of authority
&gt;they are given to make a decision within their roles.
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;
&gt;Michael
