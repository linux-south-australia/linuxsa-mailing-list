Hi.

Am I alone in my frustration with SeNet?

The problems I've been having with senet cannot possibly be isolated to me:

* Lousy Voice response system 15+ minutes for just about any business hours call

* Inability to respond in a timely manner to tech queries

* Reticence to hand out direct phone numbers to customers with ongoing problems,
requiring them to use the Voice Response system, thereby wasting their time.

* Support staff do not have the authority or quick access to anyone with authority
to solve simple problems.

* Failure to carry out promised actions, resulting in interuption of services.

* Large infrastructure changes within the organisation, disrupting services, esp
web services.

I've been a SeNet customer since the early days, Steve Baxter even came out to my
house to set up my first ever internet connection. He and Chris Foote had a lot of
fun helping me with an install of linux (Slackware 1.2.13) onto an IBM Thinkpad.

All that is behind me know, I think I will be in the market for a new ISP very
shortly, the time costs of dealing with such an unreachable and unresponsive
organisation in this day and age is unacceptable.

Sorry to vent this to the list, but it saddens me to see a good business like
SeNet go so far downhill. (and I'm frustrated to hell and back with the
difficulties their problems have forced on me) Maybe the 'All you can eat'
customers don't know what it used to be like, so this is 'normal' for them.

I don't believe the problems are because of the staff, who all seem quite
reasonable. It's the pressure they are placed under, and the lack of authority
they are given to make a decision within their roles.

Regards,

Michael
