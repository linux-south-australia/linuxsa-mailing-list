&gt; &gt; However, whoever is the majority owner of Canopy, is the majority owner 
&gt; &gt; of SCO. With SCO being so cheap, it would make a tempting purchase for 
&gt; &gt; Microsoft, wh0 have Billions of dollars sitting around. But that is a 
&gt; &gt; leap, I have no evidence (or lack of evidence) to draw a conclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; Interestingly, if you look at their portfolio, they claim to have 
&gt; invested in Trolltech, the guys responsible for the Qt library KDE is 
&gt; built on.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't see MS investing in a company that invests in the likes of 
&gt; Trolltech and Linux Networx.

Yeah I tend to agree. Ive just been tracking around the net trying work
this out, and as stated by James's post (and others) the biggest stock
holder by far is the canopy group, of who the CEO is Ralph J Yarro, who
you can find a blurb about here:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.vultus.com/investors/bod.html&gt">http://www.vultus.com/investors/bod.html&gt</A>;

" Under Ralph's direction, the Canopy Group has identified and invested
in promising open source and Internet infrastructure technologies.
Canopy's greatest strength lies in providing the companies that produce
these technologies a sheltered environment in which they can grow and
develop. Canopy companies are strongly encouraged to work with each in
synergistic partnerships.

Ralph also servers as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Angel
Partners, a 501(c)3 support organization for the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints. He is also a Trustee for the Noorda Family Trust,
the Scenic View Center, and the Worth of a Soul Foundation. He is the
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Altiris, AP Software, Caldera
Systems, Center 7, Coresoft, and Helius. He sits on the Board of
Directors for: the Canopy Group, 2NetFX, Arcanvs, Cogito, DataCrystal,
Expressware, Global Prime, The Guy Store, HomePipeLine, iBase Systems,
Interworks, Lineo, MTI, ManageMyMoney, Nombas, Profit Pro, Recruit
Search, Troll Tech and TugNut."

He seems to have entered the scene from caldera, and be right behind
open source and interoperability.

"APIs should belong to the community at large, no one entity should
control them," said Ralph Yarro, general manager of The Canopy Group,
Inc. "We want users to have the freedom to choose the platforms that
best serve them and not be limited by the lack of applications that run
on them. That's why we support not only this action, but other
developments like the Wine Project and Java as well. We greatly
appreciate the investment of time and money that developers have made to
the Windows API. It is our intention to give them a free and efficient
alternative for moving their products to other platforms without further
investment."
