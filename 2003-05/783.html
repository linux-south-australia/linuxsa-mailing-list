Oddly enough, a friend was just having a good grumble about senet. she 
recently had her win98 box reformatted and reinstalled (my idea of fun, 
NOT!.)

put in senet setup disk - modem issues. resolved modem issues for her. 

still, after that, there was still error 691 (from memory). now, thats a 
username/passwd error. the tech guys told her it was mdoem error. she drives 
from pt adelaide to her just to have me correct her username - it needed to 
have @senet.net,au or whatever added to it. 

now :
1) the setup cd didnt indicate this.
2 the tech guys SHOULD have checked that that at very least was correct.

she said her response times with them for tech support have been growing 
steadily worse, and was fed up with them. when her contract runs out, she 
will be another exiting customer.

i believe senet have been bought out by one of the major national isp players 
- coincidence?

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; Am I alone in my frustration with SeNet?
&gt;
&gt; The problems I've been having with senet cannot possibly be isolated to me:
&gt;
&gt; * Lousy Voice response system 15+ minutes for just about any business hours
&gt; call
&gt;
&gt; * Inability to respond in a timely manner to tech queries
&gt;
&gt; * Reticence to hand out direct phone numbers to customers with ongoing
&gt; problems, requiring them to use the Voice Response system, thereby wasting
&gt; their time.
&gt;
&gt; * Support staff do not have the authority or quick access to anyone with
&gt; authority to solve simple problems.
&gt;
&gt; * Failure to carry out promised actions, resulting in interuption of
&gt; services.
&gt;
&gt; * Large infrastructure changes within the organisation, disrupting
&gt; services, esp web services.
&gt;
&gt; I've been a SeNet customer since the early days, Steve Baxter even came out
&gt; to my house to set up my first ever internet connection. He and Chris Foote
&gt; had a lot of fun helping me with an install of linux (Slackware 1.2.13)
&gt; onto an IBM Thinkpad.
&gt;
&gt; All that is behind me know, I think I will be in the market for a new ISP
&gt; very shortly, the time costs of dealing with such an unreachable and
&gt; unresponsive organisation in this day and age is unacceptable.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to vent this to the list, but it saddens me to see a good business
&gt; like SeNet go so far downhill. (and I'm frustrated to hell and back with
&gt; the difficulties their problems have forced on me) Maybe the 'All you can
&gt; eat' customers don't know what it used to be like, so this is 'normal' for
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; I don't believe the problems are because of the staff, who all seem quite
&gt; reasonable. It's the pressure they are placed under, and the lack of
&gt; authority they are given to make a decision within their roles.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Michael
