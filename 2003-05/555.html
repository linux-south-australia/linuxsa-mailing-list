Brian,

I'm not an expert. Someone else hopefully will be. But anyway...

That looks very much like what I used to get when some kernel module
did something dodgy with the kernel memory allocation.
I.e.

-	kernel module X frees already freed memory or wrong address etc.,
	just like in user space.
-	then some other block of code Y goes to allocate some memory and
	triggers an exception because the memory allocation structures
	have lost their integrity.

The problem is that module X damages the malloc structures well before
the core dump. 
So there is no record of the identity of the culprit.
Even in user space, this delay between bug and crash makes bug location
quite difficult, but in the kernel, it's even more difficult, especially
if you're not developing module X yourself from source. 
In user space, at least you know which program the malloc access bug is in.

When this happens, you usually have to assume that it's the last
piece of dodgy software you loaded up into the system.
E.g. when I was writing experimental ATM card driver software, it was
a fair bet that this was the cause of system crashes and hangs.
But I still had to read several thousands of lines of someone else's original
code to find the bug.

If that VMware software has kernel modules with it, it's just possible
that this is the cause. But that's just a wild guess.

Is the bug reproducible? Looking at the "lsmod" output should narrow down the
range of suspects a bit.
What's the kernel module in that list which you least trust?
That's the one to keep an eye on.

But I'd have a fair confidence that you are indeed looking at a
damaged malloc structure there because the crash has happened during
a quite normal-looking call to __alloc_pages().

Does anyone know if there is a kernel build option which sets traps for
bad malloc/free function calls? That would be a boon.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
