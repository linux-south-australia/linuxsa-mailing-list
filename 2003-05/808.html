&gt; Anybody do an OS detect on a scan of www.sco.com ?

No, but their page is very interesting... they are porting MS Active
Directory to SCO unix, in the latest news.

Does anyone have the latest SCO Linux (Caldera) distribution? Something
that would be interesting to see would be the differences in the Kernel
between that and another Linux. Presumably the IP issue is in their own
version of Linux, thus it's withdrawal. If SCO have been distributing the
same source as Suse or Redhat or whatever won't that destroy their case,
in that they have been giving the source away themselves?

I wonder what the legal implications would be? Could they claim that they
didn't know that they were distributing it?

To compare it to SCO Unix would be the last step... although I don't
suppose anyone has source for that lying around.

What does diff say? :P
Daniel.
