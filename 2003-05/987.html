Users Voice Doubts About SCO-Microsoft Deal

 What does the software giant's licensing of Unix mean for
 the future of Linux? 

Todd R. Weiss, Computerworld
Friday, May 23, 2003

Excerpt:

 Microsoft "would love for corporations to believe that they
 will have to pay big licensing fees to SCO for using Linux,"
 said Scott Davis, chief technology officer at Realty Times,
 a Dallas-based real estate Web site. Davis uses Microsoft
 products and wrote Computerworld about the issue. "Anyone
 who can interpret Microsoft's announcement as anything other
 than a PR ploy needs a serious reality check." 

 Jeffrey Nicholas, a systems analyst at a large New York
 financial services firm that he asked not be identified,
 said he thinks Microsoft wants to help fund SCO's Linux-
 related legal actions. "The whole thing to me really doesn't
 smell right," he said. "It seems like it's all just too
 coincidental." 

 Ken Schumack, a software engineer at LSI Logic Corp. in
 Milpitas, California, said in an e-mail that he sees
 Microsoft's involvement as a "behind-the-scenes tactic ...
 to try and keep Linux from taking market share. A lot of
 people are thinking that--especially given Microsoft's
 history in the past--they almost tip their hand that they're
 involved in some way." 

 In a research note, Tony Baer, an analyst at onStrategies in
 New York, called SCO's actions "the software industry's
 equivalent of terrorism." Baer said he "can only conclude
 that the licensing of SCO Unix is Microsoft's strategy to
 drive a new wedge into the Linux community, a sector whose
 growth poses a far more formidable threat than the empty
 roars emanating out of SCO."
