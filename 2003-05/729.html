&gt;&gt;I am currently in the market to purchase a new laptop before the end of the
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;financial year. My &gt;budget is @$4000.
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Does anyone have any suggested retailers/resellers here in adelaide that
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;are helpful ?
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is there a particular model/brand people have had problems with that I
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;should stay away from ?
&gt;
&gt;I bought my Toshiba Satellite 1110 at Harvey Norman.  Yes, they have a poor
&gt;range and the prices can sometimes be lousy, but they gave me 17 month
&gt;interest free no deposit terms ;-)
&gt;
&gt;This is the top model Satellite 1110 but it's reasonably cheap and the
&gt;quality is only "good" not "great" as a Toshiba should be.  One motherboard
&gt;has already been replaced...  With a budget of $4k you can easily get a
&gt;'real' Toshiba not manufactured by Compal.  Apparently the way to tell is
&gt;that 'real' Toshibas run at 15v while Compals are 19v.  I'm sure this will
&gt;change someday (or may have already), but it appears to be a good yardstick
&gt;to go by.  Most top tier manufacturers OEM a good deal of their product line
&gt;anyway (Sony, Dell, IBM, NEC, etc).
&gt;
&gt;If you do decide to get a Toshiba the service centre in Adelaide (BMS
&gt;Technology) is very good to deal with and they have always dealt with me
&gt;promptly and curtisouly.  Replacement parts arrive the next day and the
&gt;laptop is up and running that day.  Only the Toshiba head office in Sydney
&gt;sometimes introduce some delays in answering questions but there's not much
&gt;BMS can do about it.
&gt;
&gt;See ya
