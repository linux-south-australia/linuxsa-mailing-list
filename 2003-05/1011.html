&gt;&gt;&gt;Due to the gross amount of spam coming from that block.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But, but, surely that doesn't mean blocking mail from decent folks? Is 
&gt;&gt;that a 'right' thing to do? 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is there anything I can do - my ISP can do so - we are not labeled 
&gt;&gt;"spammers"?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I would be very happy to find a better solution, and I am currently working
&gt;on one, but it rather involves a dns lookup for each mail, but does seem 
&gt;more effective. I have removed the 202.* ban and replaced it with a more
&gt;'sane' block. If I continue to get too much spam from that block, it will
&gt;go back on. 
&gt;
&gt;Also realize, more and more spam is originating here in .au and as such
&gt;I have many .au domains on my block list.
&gt;
&gt;Kind regards
&gt;Kevin

I am just thinking about a system that...who knows... maybe it will 
work, maybe it won't...probably won't go anywhere, but what the 
heck....its an idea.
I have no idea who would have the authority to impliment the 
system.....but maybe a trusted key protocol can be created between ISP's.  

The  protocol would basically be an agreement between the ISP and I 
suppose other ISP's [the group Kevin W(1) is with] that if one ISP sent 
above a certain % of spam, they will be blocked for a certain time. The 
blocker would have to notify the blockee ISP and the blockee ISP would 
notify its customers. Or maybe screen customers.... :-)

But for the system to work, I guess there would have to be "judges" to 
be sure that unfair practices are not encouraged as a result.

But then again, I start thinging about free speach issues....


Well that's my try...

James Leone



(1) My apologies Keven, I am just not too savy on who is who in making 
the mail arrive...
