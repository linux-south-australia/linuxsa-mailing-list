I tried Mandrake 9.1 on an Nvidia nforce2 box about a month or so ago, and it 
wasn't entirely successful. The Hard drive is running at ata-33... but I did 
get the modem, network, sound and graphics working (though the sound card 
only allows one program to open /dev/dsp at a time). I had some weird 
problems which I blame on IRQ sharing not working properly... e.g. when doing 
a cd burn, I couldn't make any applicaiton run in fullscreen (I think that 
was the problem, I can't quite remember now). Burns would sometimes fail too, 
not sure why.

Anyway, I think the nforce2 is a bit flakey with Linux at the moment (I had 3 
proprietry drivers on that thing! Winmodem, network card, and graphics card). 
Though it's probably "useable". If you had a VIA chipset or something, it 
might be a different story.

&gt; My son has a new system running an AMD Athlon XP 3000 on a new MSI K7N2
&gt; Delta board with 1 G DDR. He is also running the new MSI GeForce FX
&gt; 5600 video card.
&gt;
&gt; My system is a more sedate AMD Athlon XP 2600 running on an MSI K7N2G-L
&gt; board with 512 M DDR.
&gt;
&gt; Both system boards are running with the nVidea chipsets. Both of us are
&gt; running CD-burners and DVD players.
&gt;
&gt; Are these systems too fresh to be successfully running Linux?
&gt;
&gt; What kind of problems could we expect if we did try to put a distro on
&gt; them?
&gt;
&gt; Is there any place on the net where we might be able to check out these
&gt; systems for compatibility?
