&gt; &gt; My advice would be to take up one of the traineeships that you're

&gt; &gt; get into the industry, as a traineeship will offer you both educational
&gt; &gt; and vocational qualifications, even if you regard it as "cheap labour".  
&gt; &gt; Take any opportunity you can get, you'll be surprised where it can lead,

&gt; Also, at 17, you probably have some time on your hands, so I would suggest

&gt; improvements or fix bugs in it. You never know, in two or three years, 
&gt; when things improve a great deal, that might be your ticket to something 
&gt; big. However, you really might want to consider the importance of the 
&gt; right piece of paper as well.

Peter,

One should never give advice. If the advice is followed, the advice-giver is
blamed for everything that goes wrong in the life of the advice-taker
from that point on. If the advice isn't followed, why bother giving it?
Nevertheless, this is Sunday morning according to my NTP-synched machine. So...

The advice that everyone is giving is right. But let me list the advantages
of a wage-slave or even non-wage-slave job in a little more detail:

-	You can ask the other employees where the better workplaces are.
-	You can find out what the employers are looking for.
-	You can see other employees show up new on the job, or for
	interviews, and see what they look like from the point of view
	of someone within the culture of an organisation. This is 
	valuable because the sometimes awkward things that new people do
	are clear to established employees, but you might not realise
	that that's how you seem too when you arrive in a place.
-	You can read lots of manuals and books to find out how to do things.
-	You can win approval from more knowledgeable people when you
	finally get the hang of something. You don't get that while
	working at home without a job.
-	You get lots of free advice over the coffee urn on career moves.
-	You get lots of free training without realising it, just by
	asking questions. In my estimation, half of all that people
	learn in a uni CS course is learned by "asking the person
	sitting next to you". Virtually all questions can be answered
	in this way. But the answer may sometimes be: "read the manual".
-	You can discover that in fact, no matter how long you live and
	work, there will always be other people who know 10 times as
	much as you do. This helps you to stay humble. 
-	You may learn the difference between programming and software
	engineering. (Anyone who thinks there's no difference is a
	programmer.) The habit of exhaustively analysing all failure
	modes of a system is more characteristic of a software engineer,
	whereas the "try it 3 times and see how it goes" method of
	software validation is more characteristic of programmers.
	(Software engineering has many other important characterstics too.)
-	A very important advantage of any kind of job is the fact that
	someone wants you to finish your task. This helps you get into a
	habit of actually finishing tasks. (I haven't quite mastered this
	one myself yet.) The pressure to finish tasks helps with the
	ability to focus on one thing and ignore side-tracks.
-	You can learn the importance of testing and documentation.
	These both require strength of character as well as practice.
-	You can learn to estimate the time it takes to do a software task.
	(Well, actually almost no one knows how to do this. But you can
	at least learn how to state your estimate with a straight face.)
-	You can learn dozens of semi-credible excuses for why your task is late.
	(Finding someone/something to blame is an important part of task
	management.)

Despite all the advantages that a job of any kind can offer, there
is no substitute for the deep meditation of a university-level
course in CS or Eng - preferably both combined. On the other hand,
a large proportion of employers don't care much for qualifications.
They just want to know that you have been doing work matching their
job description for the last 2-3 years. That's because employers just
hate training people. They don't care if you've got a PhD, a mountainous IQ,
and the ability to learn anything in 2 weeks. They often just compare
your last 2 years of work to the job description. If they don't match then
you go into the (circular) filing cabinet. In spite of this, if you want
good jobs in the longer term, it's best to meditate at uni for a few years.  

True anecdote 1:
About 1988, I knew someone with no programming experience - just a maths
degree. He was unemployed for a few years. So I told him to learn C
and write a program. I gave him a task - but he chose a different task;
he wrote a scrabble program instead. On the basis of that program as proof,
he got his first job programming in Cobol. From that day to now, he has 
never been out of a job, and he doesn't have to program in Cobol any more.
He is happy with his current job, his happy family and a big house.

True anecdote 2: 
A few years ago, a close acquaintance of mine was unemployed for a few years
after graduating in microbiology or something. She took a couple of
slave-labour non-paying jobs in her field. I suggested she ask lots and
lots of lots of questions about other organisations and jobs, and about
the job itself. She did that, and a couple of jobs later, she is now
in a constant state of bliss with her current job. Every time I talk with her,
she talks constantly about how perfect her job is. But she got it on the
basis of the unpaid work she did.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. What was the question again? (Just kidding...)
