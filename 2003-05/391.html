What's your point?

A license to use/distribute GPL software doesn't have to be applied for,
and no license fees are payable;  But it's still a license.  Since when
has there been any requirement to spend money or sign paper to obtain
a license?

 &gt; My point - minus the frivolity - is that purchasers of 802.11 transceivers
 &gt; should be made to sign a little document which says that they
 &gt; understand that they're not allowed to fiddle with the frequencies.

Why?  The whole point of a class license is to enable people to utilize
useful equipment without needing to know what frequencies -are-.

Should you have to talk to the ACA to apply for a license to use your
cordless phone?  Of course not -- The spectrum used by that phone is
covered by a class license, just like CB and UHF radios, garage door
openers, Bluetooth headsets and model aircraft radios.

Your proposal is great if you think that the only people allowed to use
wireless Ethernet are geeks who know what frequency registers are.  But
if mum and dad are ever going to be able to use their Macintosh airport
card to talk to their TiVo then the regulations need to be sufficiently
relaxed to let them do it without a Communications Engineering degree.

 &gt; If you buy a hunting gun, you have to sign a piece of paper which says,
 &gt; by implication, that if you shoot pigeons in Victoria Square, the local
 &gt; constabulary will take umbrage.

But that's because a hunting gun can kill someone, Alan.  I don't think 
you can draw an equivalence between guns and 802.11b tranceivers.

Think about the problem the gun regulation is attempting to address.
Now think about your proposed regulation, and whether it's attempting
to address any particular problem or whether it's just bureaucracy
for the sake of it.

 &gt; There seems to have been this shift in Australian licensing away
 &gt; from licensing people and towards licensing equipment.

That's not what's happening at all, Alan.  The class license which
permits the use of 2.4 GHz spread spectrum tranceivers permits people
to use the relevent frequencies.  There are conditions on the use of
those frequencies, such as the type of modulation used, and the fact
that tranceivers you use to utilizing the frequencies persuant to the
license need to be designed and manufactured to the license's
specification.

But mark my words, it's a license for you, not your WLAN card.  If you
poke something wierd into your WLAN card and convince it to disrupt
the microwave uplink frequency which SA-FM uses to get to Mount Lofty,
you'll be the one in jail, not Cisco's or Lucent's CEOs.

The fact that a license doesn't have your name and signature on it 
doesn't make it any less of a license.  The Government has said that
every man, woman and child in Australia is *licensed* to use those
frequencies in the manner described in the license specification, and
that's no different to the HAM radio license you described in your
last email message.

 &gt; One very annoying example was that in the late 1980s and through the 1990s,
 &gt; and mabe still now, cheap modems made for the USA were verboten in
 &gt; Australia because they just _might_ be used in a reckless manner,

That's not why they were verboten, Alan (and it wasn't targetting cheap
modems in the USA either).

They were prohibited because it was against the law to attach *any*
equipment to the Australian telephone network until it had been tested
by Telecom (and later Austel).  And the reason wasn't because people
might use it in a reckless manner, it was because the regulators wanted
to make sure that there wasn't any connection between the 240VAC mains
supply and the telephone network which could damage telephone exchanges
and electrocute a linesman working on the other end of your telephone
line dozens of kilometers away.

(And, for what it's worth, the regulatory situation is almost identical
today, excepting that the number of modem manufacturers has decreased,
the multinationals who sell modems these days care enough about the
Australian market to get their equipment tested for regulatory compliance
in Australia, the Government organization which performs the regulation
is different, and you now take your equipment to an approved third-party
testing centre instead of Austel's testing labs)

 &gt; like to answer a phone in less than 2 rings or to send some pulses
 &gt; with duration in error by a few milliseconds for Telstra's liking.

Yes, those things were part of the spec;  No, they weren't the primary
driver for the regulation.  The regulation was designed to prevent your
cheap and nasty modem from *killing someone*.

 &gt; Therefore a handheld PC I bought in 1997 had the modem ripped out
 &gt; of it for the Australian version because it was too costly to get
 &gt; the licence for the _equipment_.

That has always been the case, that isn't a new trend.  

If you think that's bad, cast your mind back to the bad old days of 
the US AT&T monopoloy:  -Every- attachment to the AT&T network needed
to be approved by AT&T.  AT&T successfully fought a case against a 
company who was eroding their yellow pages advertising monopoly.  AT&T
won the case by claiming that the telephone book was an attachment to
the AT&T network, and therefore required AT&T approval.  

The Australian regulations have historically been pretty relaxed in
comparison, right?

 &gt; Now with the 802.11 frequencies that Glen's talking about, it seems
 &gt; like there's a piece of equipment which has been allowed into
 &gt; Australia without being gelded for Australian use.
 &gt; Therefore the "licence the equipment" ideology has failed to
 &gt; stop some equipment getting into Oz which could potentially be fiddled with.
 &gt; I'm really amazed that modems can't be permitted into Oz with
 &gt; minor capabilites for "unauthorized use" whereas 802.11 units
 &gt; which can disrupt comms are okay.

I'm not convinced that there's a problem there.  Who, exactly, has had
their comms disrupted, and how much money have they lost?

Are the numbers involved in either of those questions significant enough
to justify the bureaucracy that you've proposed, which would only ever
have the effect of completely destroying the market for spread-spectrum
based equipment, networks and services?

 &gt; Surely getting a purchaser to just sign that they understand that
 &gt; they're not allowed to fiddle with frequency registers is a small
 &gt; overhead compared to getting equipment licensed in the first place.

Just like the paper that HAM radio operators signed has stopped them 
all from illegally receiving satellite TV broadcasts, right?

 &gt; The alternative is to require 802.11 gear to be specially gelded
 &gt; for "Australian conditions".

We're talking about a channel set, Alan.  I'd hardly call that "gelding".
