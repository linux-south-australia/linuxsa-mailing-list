James,

Hallelujah! Peace in our time! And sapristi!

That absolutely last straw to clutch to has come good.
The clouds have dispersed and the sun is shining!

That very last little parameter in the IEC958,0 cswitch turned out
to be hidden away on the alsamixer slider for that slider,
and lo and behold, the optical S/PDIF input is working.
Free at last! (You have to say this with a southern black accent.)

Now I will have to write a little howto page (along with my current
couple of dozen linux micro-howtos) so that others also may be saved
as I have been saved!
But the question lingers - if the ALSA people were so energetic
as to write all this software, why didn't they document it?
And if they did, why didn't they link it directly to their home page?
I think I'll approach my local member to launch an inquiry.
The world has lost 3 years of my multi-tracked artistic output because
of not being able to discover one particular single bit that had to be set.
Who knows how this might have affected the trade deficit or world peace?
In a parallel universe somewhere, I'm using a Mac, the world is listening
to my music, the Australian trade deficit has turned around, and the
middle east is a zone of tranquility and prosperity.

As Jack Thompson once said: Now we can _all_ get some sleep.

Cheerio, and thanks for the help,

Alan Kennington.
