&gt; this MS slush fund for undercutting linux is going to give linux

No big surprise.

Does anyone remember Austek Microsytems?  They used to design microchips
at Tech Park.

One of their products was a drop-in pin-for-pin replacement for the
387 math coprocessor which retailed for about half the price.

Intel didn't like the idea of someone else treading on their turf, so
they started a publicity campaign which denounced the features and
performance of teh Austek 387 lookalike.

The biggest single effect of that publicity campaign was to make
ordinary people say, "Huh?  You mean I can buy my math coprocessors
from someone other than Intel?!  Way to go...!"  and suddenly Austek
was selling them as fast as they could fab them.

The same thing is happening here.  The writing for Microsoft was on
the wall as soon as they declared Linux to be public enemy number one
three or four years ago.  The biggest effect their FUD campaign is
having is to introduce people who aren't geeks to the idea that there's
actually an alternative to Windows.
