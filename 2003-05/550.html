<H1>Who is SCO Owned by?</H1>

Having a look at their recent financials shows SCO being owned by...the 
Canopy Group.

<A HREF="http://www.canopy.com/portfolio/index.htm">http://www.canopy.com/portfolio/index.htm</A>

But who owns the canopy group....?  The web site doesn't say AFAIK.

However, whoever is the majority owner of Canopy, is the majority owner 
of SCO. With SCO being so cheap, it would make a tempting purchase for 
Microsoft, wh0 have Billions of dollars sitting around. But that is a 
leap, I have no evidence (or lack of evidence) to draw a conclusion.

With name changes and large stock offerings come new ownership I 
suspect. Here is a new issue of a Million shares disclosed in a 
registration statement:

<A HREF="http://ir.sco.com/EdgarDetail.cfm?CompanyID">http://ir.sco.com/EdgarDetail.cfm?CompanyID</A>=CALD&CIK=1102542&FID=1047469-03-3746&SID=03-00

They have had three since February.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm...

I can say that the Canopy Group smells like a venture capital fund, a 
partnership of very wealthy and anonymous individuals. These 
partnerships ususally take ownership  of a wide variety of investments, 
but also have a wide variety of owners.

The only noticable management change took place in June 2003 when Mr. 
Ransom Love (That's his real name) accepted a severance package from SCO 
and quietly slipped away.  In the mean time, the new CEO, Mr. Robert 
Bench has been buying shares of stock in blocks of 3,000 odd.

They are holding an annual shareholder's meeting today:

<A HREF="http://ir.sco.com/Calendar-Detail.cfm?EventID">http://ir.sco.com/Calendar-Detail.cfm?EventID</A>=12069

Now as far as financially, the company is loosing money such as I would 
expect them to be gone in two years time. Unlike Red Hat, they have 
eaten up 95% of their additional paid in capital , and can survive to 
break even another loss year.
