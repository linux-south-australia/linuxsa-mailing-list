Barney,

You're only missing the fact that internet telephony software
tends to send 20 to 80 mSec of sound in a packet.
E.g. 20 mS of sound for 2.5 kbit/sec LPC10 voice compression - such as
the ADF has been using for at least 8 years, I think, or is
that CELP or something - would give you about 7 bytes of payload per packet.
So if you reduce 40 bytes of IP/UDP/RTP header down to 1 or 2 bytes,
that's a big improvement. If you reduce to 3 or 4 bytes, then that's
only half a good. I used the marketing definition of percentage, which is
to calculate it by dividing by the smallest number that has any relevance
to the issue so as to get the largest percentage.
Everybody does it - even academics in seminars.

More typical would be G.723.1 at about 6 kbits/sec with 20 or 24 
bytes per payload. That's what NetMeeting uses.
I've heard of people using 1.2 kbits/sec voice comms.
But you need special training to recognize words.

The short packets have an advantage over 4-frames-to-a-packet
packets because your packet loss probability in a noisy environment
(e.g. 3G networks) goes up quickly for long packets - and your latency
goes up a bit too, especially with multiple hops.

Here's a really useful table of overheads:
<A HREF="http://www.openh323.org/docs/bandwidth.html">http://www.openh323.org/docs/bandwidth.html</A>
This explains the drastic cost of IP/UDP/RTP - and you can see why
3G networks will not like VoIP getting into their networks without
a bit of header compression - and that's why they invested a lot
of time and effort in getting rid of the headers while maintaining
end-to-end header transparency. 

Voice and data are not being to be integrated over 3G networks without
successful header compression.
And in marketing terms, the enemies of linux _will_ say that
with linux VoIP to a 3G handset, you will have twice the packet
header overhead as with MS software. 

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
