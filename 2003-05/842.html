Hi all,

I'm trying to learn some PHP (and the HTML I don't know). I've got the
real basic stuff sorted, but would like either some decent tutorials on
specific things, or some eg code with specific things in it...

Specifically, the specific things I'm talking about are :

* Text Processing (I'm not real familiar with Perl either, so that won't
help)
* Creating a selectable and browseable list so checkboxes can be passed
back to PHP...
* Interacting with external commands (specifically, amrecover -- I need
to be able to communicate with stdin/stdout)
* How to communicate with a process that lasts longer than a single HTTP
session...

The first is simple stuff like how do I get text that looks like this:

---
2003-05-20 .
2003-05-20 bin/
2003-05-20 boot/
2003-05-20 dev/
2003-05-20 etc/
...
---

and make it into a nice HTML list. I know how to do this with awk, but
not PHP.

The second is just forms, I guess... I'd like to have HTML that looks
like this:

[ ] /bin/
[ ] /boot/
[ ] /dev/
[*] /etc/

and click select, and have PHP know that I have selected "/etc/". I
think this would be obvious if I knew a little more HTML (checkboxes are
common enough that they should be obvious)...



The third is more complex... The only way I know how to interact with
amanda's recovery system is through amrecover. How would I go about
starting this process, entering commands into it, getting results of
said commands, and then parseing them in PHP?


The fourth is possibly quite painful. I'm really not sure how to do
this. Somehow I need to either keep the one instance of amrecover going
from when a user logs on until they have successfully restored their
file (which could take twenty or so page clicks, and then an hour or
more of time to do the restore). Alternatively, I could start a new
amrecover for each page, and keep the actual selections in a php session
variable... This sounds messy, as amrecover would (surely) be better at
doing that for me, and no matter what, I have to solve the problem of
what happens when I try restoring something, and it takes hours (which
would doubtlessly exceed any session that I could maintain with the
browser).


I'm sure there would be half-decent tutorials around somewhere that
would do the first two at least, but starting from www.php.net, I
haven't yet found them. I'd certainly find some simple example code
helpful. I don't actually want to learn everything about PHP, I just
want to learn what I need.

Also, I'd like to ensure that my code is modular ... Anyone know of any
tutorials on PHP classes or other mechanisms for ensuring modularity of
code?

Cheers

rr
