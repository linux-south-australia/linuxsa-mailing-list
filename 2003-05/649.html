I can't reply to this directly due to you blocking my IP range, so
despite it being sent off-list, I'll just put it back on the list.


&gt; &gt; Um. I assume from this that your ppp (which I assume is a modem, 
&gt; &gt; right?)
&gt; correct
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and your sat links have different IP addresses? I assume also that 
&gt; &gt; your sat link is bidirectional? (who is that with?)
&gt; 
&gt; Sat link is download only, the uplink is via modem, the Sat 
&gt; link has its own IP address
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I need to set the route to accept all incoming 
&gt; traffic to the IP of the sat card

The route is set at the sender end. You can't set a route to accept
anything. Packets go out your PPP interface, with a source address of
x.x.x.10, the replies will come back to the same address. If this
address is routed by your ISP through your ppp link, that's where you
will get them from. If this address is routed by your ISP to your
satellite link, that's where you'll get them from. _They_ have to do
this, not you. Alternatively, if you ask your ISP nicely, they might let
you set your PPP address to be the same as your satellite address, so
incoming packets automatically get routed back to your satellite -- ie
they come out your PPP interface with a source address of y.y.y.30,
despite the fact that your ppp interface has address x.x.x.10, and of
course, replies will be addresses to y.y.y.30, which is your sat link.
Alternatively, again, you can use a /30 subnet that is routed by your
ISP via your satellite, but routed by you via your PPP... In *ANY* case,
you'll likely need your ISP's co-operation.
