&gt; Gavin,
&gt;
&gt; No doubt at all, you'll be told by one or more persons about these links:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/csdn/">http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/csdn/</A>
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/csdn/distro.html">http://www.adam.com.au/lloy0076/csdn/distro.html</A>#Linux
&gt; I won't tell you about these because I know nothing about them...
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, on the subject of Gentoo, I'd like to know if Gentoo is
&gt; particularly bug prone or just very good at finding and/or reporting bugs.
&gt; My slashdot account is configured to show linuxsecurity.com news at the
&gt; top right of the screen, and most days there are 2 or 3 Gentoo security
&gt; advisories there. This morning is a rare exception. But here's the past
list:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/gentoo.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/gentoo.html</A>
&gt; I count 86 advisories so far for 2003.

If you stick with the defaults, Gentoo is extremely stable & not at all bug
prone.
If you want to install the latest beta development software though, then you
take the risk.
Many choose to do this, as it's easy to switch back & forth between stable &
unstable source with the 'emerge' & 'unmerge' tools, and so are able to test
quickly whether something labelled as unstable is for them or not.
As a result, Gentoo does have a sizeable bleeding edge community (me
included).

&gt; So if I finally take the plunge and put Gentoo on a sacrifical machine,
&gt; will I be in security heaven because Gentoo is so good at reporting
&gt; problems that other distros don't,

You will be in security (and fix) heaven. User communication with Gentoo
maintainers is immediate, & so any real fixes are immediately added into the
portage tree for testing.
Example: I created a patch/fix for a certain package & e-mailed the
maintainer with it that night - 2 days later it was fixed & in the global
portage tree for testing :) - can't get much more on the ball than that.

Having said that, the real benefit in using Gentoo for me was that
EVERYTHING was compiled by my system, for my system with full gcc
optimisations. The difference in speed & response really is something to
behold in comparison to any generic binary based distro (they do install far
quicker though).
A typical Gentoo install on an XP 1800+ w/512MB ram will take around 3
hours.

&gt; or a security nightmare because
&gt; their packages are dodgier than the average distro's?

Apart from the basic portage tools & install .iso (40MB), Gentoo doesn't
release any packages.
It simply provides a directory tree of ebuild scripts (updated through
rsync) that wget the original source files from the developer's web-site &
then run ./configure && make && make install - with options & full
dependency checks.
So in answer, no.

If you have a moderately fast processor, & a broadband connection, you'll
fall in love with Gentoo.


Regards,
Rick
