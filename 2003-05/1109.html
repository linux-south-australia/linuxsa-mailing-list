Greetings,
Actually I noticed this on a RedHat 8 box the other day too. 

I have a static IP address on this box. When we shifted it recently, it was 
plugged into a network port on a different subnet. I didn't notice this 
until I tried to connect to this box from outside. The network had been 
working. 

Upon investigation I found that despite the network configuration it had 
obtained a DHCP lease from the server. I thought this a neat feature, and 
guessed it was designed to enable network connectivity for precicely my 
situation (wrong subnet). I reconfigured the address to the correct one for 
that network port and changed DNS all worked fine. 

3 days later I had the same problem in connecting. Looked at the network 
config, and discovered that the DHCP lease had been renewed and the IP 
address re-assigned. This is now getting annoying. 

I have looked for a network configuration option in the GUI tools, and for a 
DHCP service started from either xinetd or as a separate service, but can 
find none. 

Does anyone know how to stop this happening ? 

Thanks
