Hi all (and sorry for the cross-posting, but I think it's relevant to
both lists),

I'm not a developer, I'm a sysadmin. However, I have a problem that I
desire a solution for, and apparently none exists. Hence, I am
considering trying my hand at building it. If anyone wants to
participate, or would even like to take this idea and do it themselves,
please let me know. I've written some partially organised thoughts down
here, but I'm thinking as I write, so they may be a little more muddled
than they could be.



The Problem: amrecover is a text-driven interface that requires
systems-type skills to select which files to restore. However, the
process of selecting which files to restore, at least in the context of
user home directories should be one that the user controls. There is
nothing intrinsic about this process that should require sysadmin
intervention, apart from manual tape changing, where that is neccessary.

The Solution: A tool that allows people to select the files to be
restored, while requiring them to know nothing but the location of the
relevant files within their home directory, and the date to restore from
(both of which should be browseable).

How to do it: The two interfaces that jump out at me are a web-based
interface and a filesystem-based interface.

Filesystem Interface 
pros: * familiarity
	* user OS independant
      * no need to waste time designing a User Interface
      * could use copy and paste to restore files wherever user wants --
though the delays would be too long
cons: * familiarity (restoring takes hours sometimes, and this would be
unexpected behaviour)
      * would need to stop users from trying to open files in place, and
force them to copy before openning
      * sounds like lots of low-level work to me...

Web Interface
pros: * Interface could be more similar to actual process of restoring
(select files then start restore)
      * user OS independant
      * time delay could be made clear in the interface
      * no filesystem implementation "stuff", so could do it at a
"higher level"
cons: * another new interface for users
      * sounds like lots of interface design work to me...

One could use an FTP interface also, but I think that would be pretty
much equal to the filesystem interface, but with a slight familiarity
advantage (users are used to waiting for FTP file transfers, though the
fact that the wait would be a long delay followed by high bandwidth
transfer could be problematic for client programs).

I personally think the web interface is the go. If I could have someone
authenticate with their normal username and password, to a web page that
restricts them to the correct host and disk (using sethost and setdisk)
and subdirectory, and gives them a list of files and directories with
checkboxes next to them, allows them to browse the directories, change
dates, and then begin an extract, I think that would be simple enough.
Basically, the URL would look like this:

http[s]://&lt;host&gt;/&lt;basename&gt;?date=&lt;date&gt;&path=&lt;path&gt;

eg:

https://server.domain.com/filerestore?date=2003-05-01&path=/documents/Le
tters

Which would give them a list of the files in ~/documents/Letters
(obviously, on their correct host and disk), on the 1st of May, 2003.
Directories would be browsable, and all directories and files would have
a checkbox next to them. There would be a button at the bottom called
"select", which would select the files, and return to the same screen,
with selected files highlighted and with checkboxes pre-ticked. There
would also be a button at the bottom that said "restore", which would
take you to a screen listing which files from which dates were selected,
and wait for confirmation or correction. Correction would take you back
to the last screen, and correction would either start the download,
swapping tapes as needed with amtape, or email the sysadmin, asking them
to swap tapes as needed. There would then be a significant wait, and the
web session would have to be considered closed. Once the file restore
was complete, or if there was an error, the user could be automatically
emailed.

Of course, there would have to be some security checking -- you don't
want people restoring out of their home directory, for example. ".."
would be disallowed in the path, and as symlinks are not followed in
amrecover, they wouldn't matter here.

My initial thought is to make a webpage that integrates with amrecover
through stdin/stdout, but I'm sure there would be some sort of library
that could be used instead. Which would be better is not real clear to
me. I suspect that stdin/stdout would have some advantages, though I can
see an obvious disadvantage -- what if the UI changes? An advantage I
can see is that doing it in Perl or some similar language may well be
easier on this level.

Anyway, what do people think of this idea? Any volunteers? Anyone spot
any glaring problems? Is there anything else I should attempt to think
through?
