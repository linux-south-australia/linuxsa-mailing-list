&gt;
&gt; Total institutional cowardice. You would think thay would have the
&gt; intestinal fortitude to let their customers know what they were doing and
&gt; why. What's that? 50 odd jobs lost in SA? Damn shame if you ask me, and a
&gt; waste.
&gt; Well, off to find a new one. I won't be staying for further 'treatment',
&gt; I've had enough. Once a business forgets who their customers are and how
&gt; to look after them, they have lost the right to their support.

same thing happened with accessone/connect/aapt (before it
all became part of aol, which I should imagine plumbed new depths).

For a while (after aapt bought them) I could still get decent tech
support by ringing the connect corporate support people directly and
bypassing the aapt untrained monkeys.  But things got worse and I
left vowing never to have anything to do with aapt again.

Of course none of this is limited to ISPs, regardless of what I'm
buying I always try and support local small businesses.

Dave.
