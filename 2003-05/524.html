&gt; RFC 3095 is already frozen in stone, of course. But there are already

&gt; which will be used for linux UDP packets.
&gt; It's definitely on the agenda. 

Regardless of whether you interpret RFC 791 as requiring a unique id 
when the DF bit is set or not, the following paragraph definately 
invalidates the assumption of the incrementing id:

   Identification

     The choice of the Identifier for a datagram is based on the need to
     provide a way to uniquely identify the fragments of a particular
     datagram.  The protocol module assembling fragments judges fragments
     to belong to the same datagram if they have the same source,
     destination, protocol, and Identifier.  Thus, the sender must choose
     the Identifier to be unique for this source, destination pair and
     protocol for the time the datagram (or any fragment of it) could be
     alive in the internet.

     It seems then that a sending protocol module needs to keep a table
     of Identifiers, one entry for each destination it has communicated
     with in the last maximum packet lifetime for the internet.

     However, since the Identifier field allows 65,536 different values,
     some host may be able to simply use unique identifiers independent
     of destination.

     It is appropriate for some higher level protocols to choose the
     identifier. For example, TCP protocol modules may retransmit an
     identical TCP segment, and the probability for correct reception
     would be enhanced if the retransmission carried the same identifier
     as the original transmission since fragments of either datagram
     could be used to construct a correct TCP segment.


The suggestion here is that the easy implementation be an id incremented 
for each datagram regardless of destination, which I think would 
invalidate the compression that assumes incrementing ids immediately, if 
it is related to a particular source-destination pair.

eg	src-&gt;dest1  id=1
	src-&gt;dest2  id=2
	src-&gt;dest3  id=3
	src-&gt;dest3  id=4
	src-&gt;dest1  id=5
	etc...

Or as has been mentioned before there are other reasonable ways to get 
unique ids that are not just an incremented counter. So regardless of 
whether the linux implementation is correct or not the same problems 
could well exist with implementations definately do conform.

Barney

PS. The wording of this bit of RFC 791 does seem to add weight that it 
is suggesting that unique ids always be used regardless of the DF bit, 
specifically:
     "Thus, the sender must choose
     the Identifier to be unique for this source, destination pair and
     protocol for the time the datagram (or any fragment of it) could be
     alive in the internet."
but it is still somewhat ambiguous as there is still no obvious use for 
the id if the datagram is unfragmented. If it needs to be there 
regardless IMO the spec should say so unambiguously, ans similarly if it 
is undefined when the DF bit is set the spec should also say so.
