&gt; &gt; Just based on your thoughts above, I would go with Bugzilla.
&gt; 
&gt; I would tend to agree except I don't it. Essentially, I'm thinking
&gt; something along the lines of:
&gt; 
&gt;  "Hmmm...the best solution is something that I don't like."
&gt; 
&gt; ..and when I get to such a situation I tend to mull things out aloud.
&gt;
Then you really can't go with either of these then.  There are certainly 
classes of users when implementing a tracking system and there is 
certainly a requirement that all classes of users get what they need.  If 
Bugzilla is deemed too complicated, then I would probably look elsewhere.  
I believe someone else has suggested that there are many similar, but less 
complicated systems around.

When I was looking for a helpdesk tool for work, I found 
<A HREF="http://www.testingfaqs.org/t-track.htm.">http://www.testingfaqs.org/t-track.htm.</A>  They're not all free and/or 
opensource, but there are certainly a lot of products available.
 
&gt; &gt; depending on what you need the users to do, it could simply be a
&gt; &gt; matter of deleting all the irrelevant stuff (complications?) from the
&gt; &gt; existing pages.
&gt; 
&gt; True.
&gt; 
&gt; However, it would be nice to have a tool that was built with Debian in
&gt; mind and Bugzilla isn't. "reportbug" which is part of Debian adds some
&gt; Debian specific stuff to the reports which Bugzilla doesn't.
&gt; 
Hmmmmmm... I've often battled with the concept of whether to implement the 
generic tool or the specific tool and it would appear that Murphy is the 
ruler of the destiny of each tool in both cases.  I generally go towards 
the more generic tool if I have time...
 
&gt; There's no SQL backend for Deb. BTS. Or documentation about how to set
&gt; it up...
&gt;
That didn't come out quite the way I wanted it to... but an sql backend is 
definitely a good thing.
 
&gt; &gt; Are you sure you want to restrict your available options to just these
&gt; &gt; two?
&gt; 
&gt; We've taken a glance about and there seems to be:
&gt; 
&gt;  * Bugzilla
&gt;  * The Debian BTS
&gt;  * Jitterbug
&gt;  * Something called "Mantis"
&gt; 
&gt; We're not really stuck with these two but they seem to be the most
&gt; likely.
&gt; 
Take a glance at the web page I suggested above... there are some good 
products available...
