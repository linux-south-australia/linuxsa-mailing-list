    Hello,
          I found the problem with the redhat 9 sound driver not loading with my creative 5.1 card I ran sndconfig and it read "Creative card found disabled  suggest Bios set to Plug and Play OS , checked found that was set to plug play os ,set bios to non play os and the sound card loaded ok.   

Thanks to all for their suggestions :) 

I do have a problem with my Mandrake 9 that I would like suggestions . After a while of inactivity the screen goes blank and when I move the mouse it will not come out of hibernation ,if I press enter I then have a display but the mouse will not move. I looked on the mandrake site there are two erratas that may explain it but I tried their suggestions and still have the problem.

Their suggestions was to 1.boot with "noapic" option  
                         2. delete Load dri from       etc/X11/XF86Config-4 there was not an entry "Load dri"

I can exit from X by Control Alt Backspace

I have a Asus gf4mx400 video card and Logitech usb wheel mouse & Asus a7v133 mb. 

I also now have my multi booting sorted out between XP, Mandrake and Redhat.

Thanks to all for their help with that just for interest Mandrake 9 although it says in Control centre that it uses "Lilo with Graphical" it installs Grub :)
