&gt; Hello,
&gt; I will look further tonight but in the Mandrake control centre in the boot configuration the bootloader listed as Graphical lilo.

Well, you only have one boot sector which will will load a single boot
loader to deal with all your operating systems[1]. Since you've
installed redhat 9, it sounds like its overwritten lilo and installed
grub. This is ok. You should now forget lilo and the mandrake side of
things, as it may overwrite your redhat boot loader if you play with it.
What you need to do is use redhat, and either use their configuration
tool, or directly edit grubs configuration to list both operating
systems. Then you should be able to boot either OS fine. You should be
able to mount mandrakes filesystem from redhat and have a look at
/etc/lilo.conf to get an idea about what you need to change to configure
grub. Syntax is a little different, but its basically the same
information. The file to edit for grub is usually /boot/grub/menu.lst Be
awear that grub references disks and partitions with numbers, starting
at 0. Eg Hd(0,0) is hda1, and hd(1,1) is hdb2... You also dont need to
re-run grub after changing its config. Its smart enough to read the
menu.lst file on the fly.

Ant

[1] of course, then theres windows, who have nothing more than a basic
stub in there and then their boot loader on the partition of the
operating system, which cant do anything much really, so if you need to
boot somewhere else you need to copy the other boot sector to a file on
the windows partition and point thier loader there! aackk...
