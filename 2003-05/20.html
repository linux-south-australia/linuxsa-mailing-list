<H1>SuSE 8.1 blank monitor config problem</H1>

Does anyone happen to know the fix for this problem (apart from dumping SuSE)?

Problem:
I install SuSE 8.1 in a rather normal sort of way on a rather normal
sort of mums-and-dads PC with Hyundai monitor and 
S-Media nVidia GeForce2 MX-400 AGP graphics card.

The installation seems to go normally until X is run -- and then the
screen goes blank and the lights flash on the monitor.
I can log in on the ethernet and re-boot, and re-boot the machine into
some sort of "safe mode" which has these kernel parameters:

========================================================
title failsafe
   kernel (hd0,0)/vmlinuz.shipped root=/dev/hda3 ide=nodma apm=off acpi=off vga=normal nosmp maxcpus=0 disableapic 3
========================================================

This is in some modern-fangled /boot/grub/menu.lst file.
(I hope this GRUB thing has some advantages to make up for the fact
that I've got to forget everything I learned about lilo for 8 years!)

I suspected that the problem could be related to 
automatic power management blanking the monitor.
So I thought that maybe those APM/ACPI off parameters were saving me
when I got a plain text console when I used the failsafe mode.

However.... when I got into Yast2 (because SuSE scrapped the superior
YaST1 which actually had more functions and was easier to use),
everything went fine until I tried to configure the monitor parameters.
Obviously it must have tried to fire up the X window system again - because
the monitor and keyboard locked up again.

So I logged in over the ethernet and ran YaST2 in text mode and
tried to configure the monitor again. And surprise, surprise... my remote
CLI login hung!!

====================
By an odd coincidence, the other machine I loaded SuSE 8.1 onto - a
quite different machine - also had painful problems with the graphics
configuration. Is SuSE 8.1 just not very good at graphics configuration?

Has anyone else had this problem?


I must say that I'm very disappointed that absolutely every single thing
(except a few things) that I try in linux is a right royal pain.
Things are fine as long as I don't try to make anything better.
Any sort of new hardware or software requires hours, days, weeks or
months of pain.
I still have 3 sound cards which are resisting all attempts at configuration.
I bet ms-wind users don't spend 5 days a month diagnosing configuration errors.
Maybe I should stop buying such cheap hardware or something.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.


PS.  The old YaST installation tool for SuSE used to allow you to
choose any software on the distribution disks for installation.
Now it seems to only permit you to install stuff from the first
2 our of 7 disks. It never offers to install source for you any more.
It mystifies me that people scrap things that work and replace them
with things that don't work.
This has happened to my favourite ice cream, my favourite cottage cheese,
my favourite shampoo, bread, etc. etc. As soon as the manufacturers
realise that I like something, it's immediately discontinued.
The very day I find that linux is perfect in every way, it will be replaced
by something completely different which doesn't work at all.
