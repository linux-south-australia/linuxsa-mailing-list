I'm sorry to be asing for yet more help so soon after the last time, but...


I really do need a sound card with a verified ability to 
accept optical S/PDIF input for linux ALSA software.
Has anyone had a direct or indirect experience of getting optical S/PDIF
sound into their linux PC with some sound card?

Just now I've been trying to get my old Hoontech DS-XG 
card working with software that has presumably developed a lot
since I first failed with this card and ALSA 3 years ago.
Now I'm just tired of waiting for the software to work for this card.
I did ask for a similar recommendation a couple of years ago,
but somehow didn't buy a new card.

In my searches on the web for info about my particular Hoontech sound
card problem, nearly all of the URLs google gave me had my own
name on them -- they are, self-evidently, useless.
No help on the ALSA site either, nor the sound HOWTO etc. etc.

By the way, this Hoontech card does everything else fine - works in
alsamixer just like it did 3 years ago, and has even more 
sliders than before. I turn them all up full, and still nothing.
I've tried this sort of thing:

arecord -D hw:0,3,0 -t wav -d 5 -f cd xyz.wav

Nothing but white noise.
Strangely, I can't find any systematic documentation of the language
used in ALSA .asoundrc files. Just a couple of cookbook style things.
But someone must have written a language spec.

This person:
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/alsa-user">http://www.mail-archive.com/alsa-user</A>@lists.sourceforge.net/msg06265.html
has had almost identical problems to me, and several other mail messages
on the net have the same problem with optical S/PDIF with this card
with ALSA.
So I'm concluding that I bought a real dog of a sound card.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Of course I could subscribe to the ALSA mailing lists, but
last time I did that, I got nothing useful at all.
