<H1>A Linux for Accountants Course</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
As an accountant I am required each year to take 40 hours of continuing 
education courses to retain my accounting license.

Anyway, a friend of mine that I meet up with once a week, told me about 
this class:

&gt; <A HREF="http://www.educationfoundation.org/courses/courses_display.asp?Par">http://www.educationfoundation.org/courses/courses_display.asp?Par</A>%5FEventID=43520501&Par%5FEventYR=03


I was shocked to see this, because I have heard little or no reports of 
accounting software running in Linux that can be used in an accounting 
office, outside the expirimentation and work that I have done here.

The most I would expect the guy to talk about is Gnucash, Quicken and 
Turbotax for the web, plus the outlandishly expensive applications 
ported by Accpac, Oracle and Sage. Problem is that most members of the 
California Society of CPA's are small practices from 1 - 20 employees. 
These businesses cannot afford those applications and would not see much 
benefit by it.  Tax preparation software, unless provided as a web 
service, would still be missing. At least as I can guess, he knows it.

What I have to do now is get the word out that Linux is a viable option. 
I am probably going to take a ton of screen shots of various 
applications that run in Linux, including some that, I would wager, a 
significant number of  accountants miss very badly.  I will also have to 
explain how Wine and DOSemu have brought this viability. Most 
importantly, I have to be honest about how well all of this will work, 
it isn't perfect yet. I don't want to leave a perception that I have 
oversteaked my claims, lest it damage Open Source creditability.

I am going to write him as well as the AICPA's Journal of Accountancy to 
demonstrate that an accounting office could conceivably solely use Linux 
as their operating system, using most of the traditional tools used and 
favored ny CPA's in California. They can do that today.

In a way, I feel that because I have been in the trenches working on a 
long term migration to Linux from Windows in a CPA office, I have 
something to share. I think I am too young or shy to be an instructor.  

Anyway, I hope to make a PDF file with that correspondence to the 
instructor, whom I have never met, before my supper time.

Once again, more good news!

James Leone
