&gt; &gt; Ideally, you should have the same message, sent
&gt; &gt; directly, and on the list, to compate with. For that 
&gt; matter, did the 
&gt; &gt; test message Greg sent (the one he used to diff with) work for you?
&gt; 
&gt; I have no idea.  I don't know what he is doing, or what relevant 
&gt; information can be gleaned from header comparisons.

No, you misinterpret me. I'm not asking you to look at the result of his
diffs, I'm asking you to look at the actual message that he used in that
diff. It appears to have been sent to you directly, as well as via the
list. Hence, you should have two copies of it in your email client.

They were sent by Greg, with subject "Toy MUAs (was: [lca2004-helpers]
Badges for LCA)", at 11:43 am. You should be able to find them.

FYI, mail headers are lines that mail servers use to track what has
happenned to a mail message, who it was from, when it was sent, and so
on and so forth. Ones you would be most familiar with are the To:, Cc:,
From:, and Subject: headers. Here's a few specific headers from that
diff that you might recognise:

Date: Mon, 26 May 2003 11:43:02 +0930
From: Greg 'groggy' Lehey &lt;<A HREF="mailto:grog@lemis.com">grog@lemis.com</A>&gt;
To: Brian Astill &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bastill@adam.com.au">bastill@adam.com.au</A>&gt;
Cc: <A HREF="mailto:lca2004-helpers@linuxsa.org.au">lca2004-helpers@linuxsa.org.au</A>, David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>&gt;
Subject: Toy MUAs (was: [lca2004-helpers] Badges for LCA)

I've got rid of a lot of other stuff there, to show you the most
relevent headers. Most of these, normal mail clients use to sort
messages and so on by.

The other stuff is occasionally useful, though ignored by most people.

The diff that Greg sent showed all the differences between his original
email and the one he got back from the mailing list. It was a "unified
context diff", which means that it has all the '+' and '-' and so on at
the start of each line, and that it shows three (or thereabouts) lines
of unchanged context before and after every change. His point was that
there was no change in the actual content of the message.

As an example of how this works, try it for yourself. Copy a text file
somewhere -- make it a reasonably large file, like your httpd.conf or
perhaps an init script -- and then make three or four small text changes
to the file. Now do this:

diff -u originalfile modifiedfile

You'll see some output that looks similar to what Greg included. I did a
simple test on my own httpd.conf:

the line starting with "---" is the name and date of the first file.
the line starting with "+++" is the name and date of the first file.
lines starting with "@@" are the locations of the changes in each file 
  (distinguished by + and -), and specifying the line number of the
start
  of this section of changes, and the number of lines that are listed.
lines starting with " " are the same in both files
lines starting with "-" are in the first but not the second
lines starting with "+" are in the second but not the first

So, greg did that with two mail files -- these are the raw emails, as
KMail sees them. Depending on your mail server, they might exist as
separate files on disk, or they might actually be sections of a single
file.

OK, that's the "diff and mail header FYI"... 

Back to the mails -- the two mails that Greg compared using diff are
ones that you should have in your KMail inbox. You should be able to
compare KMails' behaviour when it tries to open each of these files.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully.  I have sent hime my kmail config for comparison with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; his, but have not seen any result so far.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK then
&gt; 
&gt; And I think I might understand differences between config files.  :-)

:)

Good luck then.

By the way, one change I did notice in Greg's diff is the footer info
that was added. I think it probably *shouldn't* break a mail client, but
it *might* -- but I don't know if that is a bug in the mail client or a
bug in the mailing list server...
