Hi all,

Does anyone know of software that will enable users to access and
restore their own backups? I'm about to have a big (52 tape) DLT tape
robot for backups, and I know I can use Amanda (or probably even just
tar and friends) to automate daily backups. However, even amanda appears
to be somewhat clunky when I try to restore -- the process is something
like this:

1) run amrecover as the amanda user
2) use the command-line interface to set the correct host (in my case,
there is -- or will be -- one host) DLE (disklist entry), and restore
date.
3) manually look for the file in the filesystem, and mark it (or them).
4) extract the file... amanda then asks for confirmation, then says
which tape to load.
5) load the tape (manually, or with an amtape command)
6) amanda may ask for another tape... step 5 again...
7) copy or move the file from the cwd to whereever you want it (or
change cwd before step 4)

This requires sysadmin intervention, and can take a few hours. It's
particularly irritating if you need three tapes, and have to wait two
hours between each tape, and only have three hours available onsite. I'd
really like some sort of online or user-driven restore system.
Unfortunately, the rsync-based script as described here some time ago is
not presently an option, as we don't have the spare disk space, and
won't be getting sufficiently more for some time. Also, I have this tape
robot now, and suspect I should be able to automate it with this
somehow...

So... what I want is either a filesystem-like interface (though I
suspect that this would be painfully unresponsive), or a web-based
interface, where users can clickety-click, wait a few hours, and presto,
their file is restored, and all I hear is the whirr-snick-bzzt of the
tape robot.

Any ideas?
