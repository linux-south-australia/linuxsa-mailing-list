Thanks Peter, I appreciate and understand your advice completely.
I actually worked in a computer shop voluntarily for well over a year and a half. (e.g. free)
In that period I learnt an immense amount of IT/customer relation skills.
Since working there various opportunities have arrived. So I understand your points.

But...

Cheap labor is fine, as long as I am learning/happy.			

In which these current opportunities are lacking (_learning_).

Yours Sincerely


Jake Press

&gt; &gt;I need work, im 17 well skilled in IT (check resume) and ready

&gt; &gt;Ive been offered several trainiships so far, but as always 
&gt; &gt;there is no training just cheap labour.
&gt; 
&gt; My advice would be to take up one of the traineeships that you're
&gt; being offered.  At 17 I would regard that as your best chance to
&gt; get into the industry, as a traineeship will offer you both educational
&gt; and vocational qualifications, even if you regard it as "cheap labour".  
&gt; Take any opportunity you can get, you'll be surprised where it can lead, 
&gt; if, as you say, you are well skilled in IT and ready to learn more...
&gt; 
&gt; PS If you think that advice sucks, that's fine, but at 17 I was in a 
&gt; similar position and took up a traineeship in IT, only 6 years ago.
&gt; That year of "cheap labour" was the stepping stone to where I am right now,
&gt; managing IT for a regional health service...
