Richard,

This was mentioned on slashdot a few weeks ago.
They decided to reject all xDSL IP addresses and all Telstra addresses too.

&gt;    ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:linuxcpa@netscape.net">linuxcpa@netscape.net</A>&gt;

How come a netscape.net address is being rejected by AOL?
What's AOL got to do with it?
Has this got something to do with AOL buying netscape?
Poor old netscape. They must be behind the AOL firewall.
No wonder they're so out of touch these days.

&gt;    ----- Transcript of session follows -----
&gt; ... while talking to mailin-02.mx.netscape.net.:
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; DATA
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; 550-The IP address you are using to connect to AOL is either open to
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; 550-the free relaying of e-mail, is serving as an open proxy, or is a
&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; 550-dynamic (residential) IP address.  AOL cannot accept further e-mail

I assume this means AOL thinks you've got a dynamic IP address.
How do they know this?
Is there some global index of dynamic IP addresses that they look up?

The spam must have been pretty overwhelming for AOL to take such
drastic actions.
But as I keep saying: Spam is destroying the Internet, not porn.
And yet politicians attack porn and let spam go free - the British
govt even got the EU to not ban spam.
Some politicians think that spam is an entrepreneurial activity,
which means that there's probably a bit of campaign financing in it.
So you can't expect politicians to crack down on entrepreneurial
activity, can you?
Therefore we just all have to stand idly by and let spam - and the
collateral damage from defences against spam - destroy the net.

As I always say: We are in the medieval era of computing.
In 50 years, everything will work perfectly and history students will
gasp when they read what we had to put up with.
Patience, patience....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
