&gt;&gt; Intro for the newcomers: Brian has trouble with KMail.  I took at look

&gt;
&gt; Want to summarise 'trouble'?

Yes, I did at the end of the original message:

&gt; So what conclusions can I draw:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  I don't know what your problem is, but "it works for me".  For
&gt;     some definition of "works".
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  KMail is a toy hiding from Microsoft in a foreign environment.  It
&gt;     doesn't do anything useful, it is very slow, it wastes enormous  
&gt;     amounts of space, and it doesn't interface with its environment. 
&gt;     I'll use it as another example for the paper I'm planning to
&gt;     present at AUUG 2003 in September: "Why I hate OpenOffice".  If
&gt;     you like this kind of software, you'll love Microsoft's "Windows".
&gt;     
&gt; In more detail, these are the problems I see with KMail (referring to
&gt; the point numbers above):
&gt; 
&gt; 1-4.  KMail shouldn't go off and start messing around in your saved
&gt;       mail without telling you and giving you the option to say yes or
&gt;       no.
&gt;     
&gt; 5-7.  It should interface with the system.  The whole concept of UNIX
&gt;       is cooperation: MUAs read and write mail.  MTAs transfer it from
&gt;       one place to another.  Shells and logins define the user.  KMail
&gt;       is trying to do all three.
&gt; 
&gt; 12-14: It's inefficient.  Despite setting up index files, sorting a 
&gt;        "folder" with 1600 messages can take up to 10 seconds.  mutt
&gt;        does the same thing in an imperceptibly short time.
&gt;         
&gt;        It's limited.  I can't thread, I can't sort by size.
&gt; 
&gt;        It's clumsy.  To search for anything I have to push mice
&gt;        around, and it opens new windows which don't show what you're
&gt;        looking for.
&gt;         
&gt; Discussion invited.

&gt;&gt;&gt; and yes you CAN sort by size, but you have to display size in your
&gt;&gt;&gt; listing first (see Settings, Configure KMail, Appearance, Layout).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, I thought that might be possible.  But the defaults are bad.
&gt;
&gt; Nice subjective assesment there.
&gt; Perhaps most people don't care what size their messages are?

This was in the context of the fact that the subject line was too
short to show any differences between the individual messages,
although the display was half empty.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's asking you to make your own choice of name.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Of course I understand that.  But why should I choose a name?  For
&gt;&gt; what?  Doesn't it know I'm running UNIX and already have defined every
&gt;&gt; name that I need.
&gt;
&gt; Is that English?

Yes.  In this context, it asked for a name where none appeared
required.  It didn't say why.  I'm guessing that it's supplying a way
for multiple real users to use one user ID.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5-7.  It should interface with the system.  The whole concept of UNIX
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       is cooperation: MUAs read and write mail.  MTAs transfer it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from one place to another.  Shells and logins define the user.  KMail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is trying to do all three.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Why shouldn't it?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The whole concept of UNIX is cooperation: MUAs read and write mail.
&gt;&gt; MTAs transfer it from one place to another.  Shells and logins define
&gt;&gt; the user.
&gt;
&gt; Why do you say it's trying to do all 3?

Because it's trying to do all three.

&gt; It does have options to run commands before checking email, but IMHO
&gt; that is only there to work around stupidities in site policies (eg
&gt; it allows you to run a tool to tunnel your mail connection over ssh
&gt; because your firewall admin may block out going IMAP+SSL
&gt; connections)

That in itself is a good idea.  But it shouldn't be the default way of
doing things.

&gt; I don't see how KMail acts as an MTA though, unless you mean the bit
&gt; where it can connect to a given SMTP server to send your email. If
&gt; so, then I interpret that as a concession to the broken nature of
&gt; the internet as it currently stands.  Ideally  you wouldn't have to
&gt; do it, but IRL you do, so it does it.

I'd be more inclined to think it's the broken nature of the Microsoft
environment.  I've never seen a case where it's needed on UNIX, though
I'm sure they exist, at least if you accept badly configured MTAs as a
reason.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 12-14: It's inefficient.  Despite setting up index files, sorting a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        "folder" with 1600 messages can take up to 10 seconds.  mutt
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        does the same thing in an imperceptibly short time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; You must have an interesting mail setup :-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, I've been collecting mail messages for over 20 years.  In that
&gt;&gt; time you get to know a lot of people, and you accumulate a fair amount
&gt;&gt; of mail.
&gt;
&gt; I just put 1600 messages in a local folder and changing sort method takes
&gt; under 1 second.. (both as maildir and mbox)
&gt;
&gt; This is a PIII-700.

Then there must be something else which makes the difference.  It
depends on which way you sort it.  In my case, it's when going from
Subject V to Subject (Status) ^.  The others are much faster, though
still noticeable.  Machine is a 600 MHz Pentium II (I think).

So how do you use mbox under KMail?  I couldn't find information on
that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        It's limited.  I can't thread, I can't sort by size.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry, Greg.  I do both.  That's RTFM again.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; OK, for the sake of argument, I've checked this stuff.  Yes, I can
&gt;&gt; display threads and sizes.  I can't sort by size.  To change from
&gt;&gt; threaded to non-threaded displays (a thing I do several times a day)
&gt;&gt; appears to require reconfiguration.  With mutt it's two keystrokes.
&gt;
&gt; I can view by thread and size. It was hardly complex to change.

How do you do it?  I have to:

1.  Take my hands off the keyboard and grab the mouse.
2.  Select "Settings".
3.  Select "Configure KMail".
4.  Select "Appearance".
5.  Select "Layout".
6.  Select "Thread list of message headers".
7.  Click on "OK".
8.  Wait 30 seconds while KMail does something using up all of the
    CPU:

          tty             ad0             acd0              fd0             cpu
     tin tout  KB/t tps  MB/s   KB/t tps  MB/s   KB/t tps  MB/s  us ni sy in id
       0   76  0.00   0  0.00   0.00   0  0.00   0.00   0  0.00  69  0 28  3  0
       0  229  6.96  23  0.15   0.00   0  0.00   0.00   0  0.00  65  0 32  3  0

Even without point 8, which may be fixable, it's just plain
inconvenient.  Do you know a better way?  In mutt it's two characters,
done in a fraction of a second.

&gt; You seem to expect KMail to behave the same as mutt, why?

No, I want something I can use easily.  FWIW, I have plenty of
problems with mutt.

&gt; It is aimed at different users.

What's the difference?

&gt; Anyway, you can change threading with two key strokes in kmail -
&gt; Alt-o, t.

Ah, good.  Where's that documented?  Unfortunately, it still takes 30
seconds to come back.

&gt;&gt; All there is is this help facility.  It doesn't appear to be very
&gt;&gt; good: I can't find any mention of threads in it, for example, so I
&gt;&gt; can't say with any certainty that I can't easily change the message
&gt;&gt; display.  I can say with some certainty that it's difficult to find
&gt;&gt; out how to do it.  For example, I found a reference to using mail
&gt;&gt; files instead of directories, but I couldn't find any details.
&gt;
&gt; It does mention threads, go down to 'Menu Entries' -&gt; 'Folder Menu'.
&gt; Admittedly it doesn't have much to say.

In particular, it doesn't talk about the keystrokes you need.

&gt; I'd also like to point out the mutt man page is pretty worthless. It
&gt; shows you the command line options for mutt, but not actually how
&gt; you might go about using it.

Agreed, it's pretty terrible.

&gt;&gt; While searching the help files, I *did* find a chapter (7) on
&gt;&gt; importing data from other MUAs, all of them apparently from the
&gt;&gt; Microsoft space.  But the idea of importing and exporting data is the
&gt;&gt; Microsoft way, not the UNIX way.
&gt;
&gt; My version of the handbook has examples for either importing or interoperating
&gt; with 13 odd mail programs, of which 3-4 are Win32 specific.

I'm running KDE 3.0, installed from the port on 4 December.  What
about you?

&gt; Not sure what "the microsoft way" of importing and exporting data is.

Importing and exporting data.  The UNIX way doesn't need to import or
export.
