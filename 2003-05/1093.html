Quoting jonathan soong &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jon.soong@imvs.sa.gov.au">jon.soong@imvs.sa.gov.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm sure I can't tell you anything you don't know already, but who knows...
&gt; &gt;In my own experience, more than 85% of all spam attempts come from
&gt; &gt;a domain name which "postfix" calls "unknown". I.e. the SMTP peer IP
&gt; &gt;address is not in the reverse DNS. Of the remaining percentage,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Just wondering, as i am setting up a DNS. Does it _really_ matter if you 
&gt; don't put a reverse
&gt; DNS entry in for a domain? What happens if you don't? is it bad?
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?

Are you trolling? :-)

You should set it up for reason that others can more eloquently explain.

Having said that, my site, msdavies.net, is hosted by a company that doesn't 
set up reverse-DNS.  What does this mean?  Web appears to work fine from 
anywhere.  Email works almost anywhere, except for sites that check there is a 
reverse DNS entry and drop email otherwise.  This is annoying because I don't 
see that there is a problem, people just don't respond.

What happens in my case, is the hosting company I use keeps a list of domains 
that check reverse-DNS on email, and punch SMTP through another host that does 
have a reverse-DNS entry for them.

Is that bad?  Well, annoying at least.  But it seems a common practice.

(And don't complain to me about the TZ of *this* webmail email again, ok :-)
