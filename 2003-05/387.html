&gt; My point - minus the frivolity - is that purchasers of 802.11 transceivers
&gt; should be made to sign a little document which says that they
&gt; understand that they're not allowed to fiddle with the frequencies.

How many users are likely to be able to modify the frequency settings in
your average 802.11 equipment?  Equally by your example we should require
all purchasers of walkie-talkie style radios to sign, as well as cordless
phone users, etc.  Microwave oven users should also be taken to account,
especially those with old ovens containing deprecated seals.

What is the difference between:

A) User signs, then user modified the equipment as they want
B) User modifies equipment without signing

Surely we have achieved nothing as in both scenarios the user still needs to
be caught.  In both cases they have committed a violation of licensing laws
equally.

Would you take exception to a regulatory body requiring certification that
the TCP/IP stack you have just compiled for Linux is fit to use with
Australian ISPs?

&gt; Now with the 802.11 frequencies that Glen's talking about, it seems
&gt; like there's a piece of equipment which has been allowed into
&gt; Australia without being gelded for Australian use.
&gt; Therefore the "licence the equipment" ideology has failed to
&gt; stop some equipment getting into Oz which could potentially be fiddled
with.
&gt; I'm really amazed that modems can't be permitted into Oz with
&gt; minor capabilites for "unauthorized use" whereas 802.11 units
&gt; which can disrupt comms are okay.
&gt;
&gt; Surely getting a purchaser to just sign that they understand that
&gt; they're not allowed to fiddle with frequency registers is a small
&gt; overhead compared to getting equipment licensed in the first place.
&gt; The alternative is to require 802.11 gear to be specially gelded
&gt; for "Australian conditions".

If the user uses the equipment incorrectly they may be prosecuted for it.  I
could well set my 802.11b access points to USA frequencies instead of the
current Australian settings.  But that is also my choice.  The modem example
is a little different as Austel feared substandard and non compliant modems
being plugged in and causing damage to the network, not meeting
specifications when it came to surge resistance, etc.  One can always wonder
whether these concerns were genuine or simply an attempt to extract a bit of
revenue.  I have seen plenty of USA import modems work fine on Australian
phonelines (no, I don't own one).

Just out of curiousity, what licensed frequencies around 2.4Ghz (taking
802.11b as an example) are under threat if 802.11b users start fiddling with
binary changes to firmware?  How much can they reasonably change the
frequency by?

See ya
