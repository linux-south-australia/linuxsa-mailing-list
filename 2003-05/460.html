I've been reading the doco, the web, my crystal ball and I can't seem to
figure out who to enact user level security on an nfs.

I've mounted two Tru64 Unix 5.1a filesystems onto my Redhat Linux 6.2 box.

I need for only one user (and root) to be able to read, write and execute
everything on that mount but I also need for other users in a specified
group to be able to read only the same mount.

At the moment anyone on the Linux box can read, write and execute everything
on that mount and I need to restrict access.

If anyone can help me, please.

Regards,
Desiree de Fluiter
