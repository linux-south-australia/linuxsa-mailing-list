Hi Richard,

True, but everything doesn't have to work for a functional system. Both
Nvidia and ATI's mobile graphic chips are supported in varying degrees
in both open source and proprietary drivers. At work we managed to get
our own developed OpenGL apps running with the open source Radeon 7500
mobile drivers. I never would of believed it until I saw it. I haven't
heard of any Ethernet problems in modern laptops. Same with sound
support.

I haven't tried USB floppy drives. I do know power management can be
shaky due to the immaturity of ACPI in the linux kernel.

The big item I think right now is Wi-Fi support in the new Intel
Centrino and Broadcom BCM4306 and BCM2050 WLAN chips (for 802.11g
support). There was a post on Slashdot today about it - it's a big deal
for new laptop buyers.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; &gt; This sounds like a conversation 5 years years ago.. how many

&gt; 
&gt; Laptops vary even more than desktops. They always have something that is
&gt; odd about them. Sure, you can almost always get some sort of functioning
&gt; Linux system on most laptops, but try getting sound, accelerated
&gt; graphics, the ethernet card, the modem, the USB floppy, and power
&gt; management to work as well. Mostly, it's possible, but with compromises.
