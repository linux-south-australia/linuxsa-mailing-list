First cup of coffee still sinking in ...

&gt;&gt; How complicated can it be to get ftp to listen on the port I want it to?

&gt; not very!
&gt; I'm using proftp too (debian woody), so I edited /etc/proftp.conf,
&gt; changed "Port 21" to "Port 3670".
&gt; Edited /etc/inetd.conf (since for me proftp is started by inetd)
&gt; and copied the "ftp" line calling the service "myftp" instead, ie:
&gt; 
&gt; myftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/proftpd
&gt; 
&gt; edited /etc/services, and added:
&gt; 
&gt; myftp           3670/tcp
&gt; 
&gt; then restarted inetd, proftp is now listening on the port:
&gt; 
&gt; # netstat -a |grep ftp
&gt; tcp        0      0 *:ftp                   *:*                     LISTEN
&gt; tcp        0      0 *:myftp                 *:*                     LISTEN

Sorry for the large quote, but I needed to keep some context here.

The part between editing the config for inetd and proftpd is possibly
conflicting - either *one or the other* listens to the port that that
the initial connections are made on.  When inetd is starting up the ftp
daemon (or any daemon), it listens to that port on the programs behalf,
then spawns the process on an incoming connection and hands across file
descriptors 0 and 1 (and possibly 2 - NFI, DFC[1] currently :-) to that
process.  Unless the process uses some system calls, it's not even aware
that it's been handed a set of sockets to talk over (ftp daemons usually
do, because it places some access controls limits on the connection).
When ftpd daemons are run in standalone mode (which the more modern
variations like proftp are able to do), it handles the listening that
inetd would normally do.  But it's a one or the other deal - if both do
it, you'll get the 'Address in use' error.  David, you'll probably find
that there is some other configuration option that's preventing proftp
from starting up in stand alone mode, but it shouldn't care at all about
the port setting.  If it does, well, I'd consider that broken behaviour.
