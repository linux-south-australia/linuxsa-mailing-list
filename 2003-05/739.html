&gt; Nothing personal against Sony laptops - but as with all Sony gear in SA it 
&gt; can be a trial to get it fixed if it breaks.  
&gt; 
&gt; Compaq have a repair centre in Adelaide (Frome St) (highly recommend getting 
&gt; extend waranty - doesn't cost much, saves time and issues).  
&gt; 
&gt; Toshiba have various people who'll repair stuff including one on wright st 
&gt; (who's name escapes me at the moment).

My experience with getting broken Dell's fixed (under the
3 year extended warranty) is good.  It's on-site, so
someone appears with a few boxes of possibly-relevant
parts (typically installing all of them rather than actually
finding the fault).

I'd have to say that the reliabilty of laptop machines is
way beneath the reliability of desktop machines, so repair
is a first-order concern.

Getting the Dell laptops to work with Linux has been a trial.
For example, none of the mini-PCI 802.11 options offered with
my laptop have Linux support.  I'm not sure there is a
good vendor in this respect, as I noticed that the IBM laptops
have the same problem.  This is a strong argument for going
with a local vendor (which might offer a customisation which
has better Linux support).

I found it difficult to tell in advance how much difficulty
there would be.  None of the vendors seem to list chipsets
on their websites.  The "Linux on laptops" link farm is
good, but only for laptops that have been on the market
for a while (and the Pentium M is causing lots of new models
to appear).
