This kind of garbage keeps appearing in my system log files:

----------------------------------------------------
May 10 21:43:46 hamster insmod: Warning: loading /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/net/xyz1.o will taint the kernel: no license
May 10 21:43:46 hamster insmod:   See <A HREF="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</A>#export-tainted for information about tainted modules
May 10 21:43:46 hamster insmod: Module ppp_xyz1 loaded, with warnings
May 10 21:43:46 hamster insmod: Module ppp_xyz2 loaded, with warnings
----------------------------------------------------

Now I've been sort of following this kernel module licence thing,
and I know about how to set the licence attributes for a kernel module,
and all that sort of thing. That's not my problem. I know how to "comply".
What worries me is that the so-called "free" software camp led by
Mr. Stallman will ultimately "prevail".

The worrying thing on the horizon is that the kernel linker will
already not let you link non-GPL code to GPL-only modules, and if
enough of the kernel is GPL-only, this will mean very definitely that
all kernel modules must be GPL. There are no exceptions to the
"only GPL is free" rule in the kernel linker. BSD is "not free".
Artistic Licence is "not free". 

Therefore I greatly fear that this will be the demise of the linux kernel.
It will be completely owned by a proprietor whose licence mutates over time to
successively eliminate all non-GPL code from the kernel.

The original understanding was that non-GPL modules were allowed.
On that understanding, many people and companies got onto the linux
bandwagon. If that understanding is now being removed, which apparently
it is, then linux will go back to being hair-shirt anti-proprietary.
In other words, Mr. Stallman owns your software if it's in the kernel.
What's yours is his, and what's his is his own.

----------------------------
Can anyone tell me what the current thinking is in the linux kernel world
on this? Is the future GPL-exclusive kernel modules?
I don't want to subscribe to the kernel mailing list to find out.
My modem is only 33k.

By the way, the module (above) that I'm currently developing might end up
going under GPL - or some licence which is little more free than that.
But forced charity is the same as theft. It's nicer to give out
of generosity than because of compulsion.
I think that Mr. Stallman has taken the generosity out of "free software".

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
