&gt; Interesting. One thing im confused about though with this whole saga.
&gt; Didnt caldera opensource unix to stop this kind of stuff from happening?
&gt; Arnt sco caldera now anyway? 

Caldera did buy SCO, and changed their name back and forth a few times,
but they didn't open source unix.  They did it because, I suppose,
they figured owning unix would give them a better chance of surviving.
Unfortunately, or perhaps just because they need the money, they also
seem to have bought SCO's legal team.  No real surprise.


I find this an interesting (and perhaps accurate) comment from the article:

   ``"This shows one of the weaknesses of the open-source movement,"
   said Mark Radcliffe, a copyright attorney with Gray Cary. "You're
   all dependent on trust. Unfortunately, a number of people involved
   in the process do not have a great degree of respect for intellectual
   property. It's fine if it's personal, but if you decide to implement
   that by saying I don't give a damn about this intellectual property,
   everything that touches it is now screwed."''
