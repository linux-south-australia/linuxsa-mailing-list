&gt;  What is your opinion of job security in Australia? Do you
&gt;  think there should be more intervention to harness local

&gt;  with your opinion.

I think the IT Industry generally is starting to become sane.  Do web
developers deserve $50/hr?  Do SysAdmins deserve $50/hr?  Do managers of
IT deserve $50/hr?

Do we deserve more money as Linux/Unix SysAdmins compared to the
Micro$oft SysAdmins.  If we're hardware type engineers, why should we
get anymore than the TV repair person?

Is our work particularly challenging and/or any more stressful than
other job?  Most of us now work on consumer devices.  That certainly
wasn't always the case, but it is now.  I don't know many people without
computers and of course, some of that is biased because I work in the IT
Industry and I know a lot of people in the IT Industry, but I don't know
just people that work in IT.

Do I particularly want work going overseas?  No, I don't.  But it
happens and my place of work is an example of sending work offshore, but
they're sending it to Oz and I am benefitting from it.  Sending work to
India is still one of those things that will happen whilst the quality
of life is lower there, but one day, it will catch up.

My belief is that things will certainly even themselves out in the IT
Industry.  I currently have a job that pays reasonably well considering
I have no tertiary education in the area and I'm not looking at changing
jobs.

I would be interested in what others on this list think regarding these
issues.
