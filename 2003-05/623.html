&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any recent experience of using 2 or more monitors
&gt; &gt; &gt; attached to one linux box using KDE and a single mouse and keyboard?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The xfree specs allow for up to 8 billion virtual desktops.
&gt; 
&gt; Er... why?

Um.... because it can?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have 3 video
&gt; &gt; cards but the minimum requirement AFAIK is 2. One has to be AGP and the
&gt; &gt; other PCI.
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds interesting... how do you control which one the computer
&gt; uses during the BIOS part of the boot sequence?

My bios allows me to choose either the AGP or PCI card as the boot
device.

&gt; 
&gt; My situation is a bit different: I currently have a PCI video card
&gt; which fulfils all my needs perfectly well with the sole exception of
&gt; providing reasonable performance in MS Train Sim. I am about to
&gt; install an AGP video card to solve this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, the new card won't be supported by svgatextmode, which
&gt; is a pain, as I don't want to lose my 100x36 text consoles in Linux.
&gt; So what would be really useful would be if I could have both cards
&gt; installed, and have Linux boot using the PCI card but Windoze boot
&gt; using the AGP one. (I have one monitor, which I would plug into either
&gt; card as necessary.)

You'd have to change the bios each time for whichever OS you want to
boot to. The better solution would be to get another cheap second hand
monitor. I'm not sure how the windows games would handle that though, as
some want to take complete control over the display but aren't xinerama
aware.

&gt; 
&gt; The long term fix is to hack svgatextmode to support the new card,
&gt; which seems to involve either pulling apart the source code for the X
&gt; drivers or registering as an ATI developer to get hold of the Radeon
&gt; 7500 data sheet. I am pursuing both routes, but it may take some time.

Sounds like too much trouble to me.

&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime, if you could give any hints on booting with different
&gt; video cards, it would be much appreciated.

Get to know your bios. Configuring for X is easy, X -configure works
just fine for me. BTW: X wont care which is the boot device but will
allocate Screen0 to it regardless which one you choose.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The really cool way to use xinerama is with vmware running windows. Then
&gt; &gt; you can have the left monitor for example running vmware windows in full
&gt; &gt; screen mode and linux on the right monitor, with the mouse moving
&gt; &gt; seamlessly between the two operating systems. Lots of fun!  ;-P
&gt; 
&gt; That would be SO COOL... MS Train Sim won't run in wine. You don't
&gt; happen to know where I can get a secondhand copy of vmware? :-)

VMware is propriety software. Piracy is illegal! Sorry can't help there.
