&gt; Debian BTS:
&gt; 
&gt;  Pros:
&gt;  - it's natively understands the Debian system
&gt;  - it can be manipulated totally by e-mail
&gt;  - it stores all things in a text backend (no sql servers etc etc)
&gt;  - it behaves just like bugs.debian.org
&gt;  - it's collaboratively managed
&gt; 
&gt;  Cons:
&gt;  - the lack of an sql server is a con too
&gt;  - it's hideously difficult to set up
&gt;  - it's lack of documentation on set up makes me wish it had a Windows
&gt;     Help file
&gt;  - I can't find any pre-built "nice" interfaces (GUI toolkit/web-based
&gt;     or otherwise) to use it
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Bugzilla:
&gt; 
&gt;  Pros:
&gt;  - it's UI is highly configurable
&gt;  - it's security settings seem more fine-grained than the Debian BTS
&gt;  - it uses an SQL backend
&gt;  - it's easy to setup (apt-get does most of it for you)
&gt; 
&gt;  Cons:
&gt;  - it's not a Debian-specific product and needs to be set up to
&gt;     understand what we're doing
&gt;  - it's very, very, very complex to use as a user [I can never get my
&gt;     head around a bugzilla submit page and the users who will be using
&gt;     this thing would probably just give up]
&gt;  - it uses an SQL backend
&gt; 
&gt; *hmmm*
&gt; 
&gt; /me ponders
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts on this?
&gt;
Just based on your thoughts above, I would go with Bugzilla.
 
Perhaps you've just about convinced yourself already that you prefer 
Bugzilla.

On interface issues... well, they're just web pages and web pages aren't 
difficult to edit (time is probably the major issue here) and depending on 
what you need the users to do, it could simply be a matter of deleting all 
the irrelevant stuff (complications?) from the existing pages.

Not having documentation is a big negative in my mind.  The sql backend is 
a positive (for both products).

Are you sure you want to restrict your available options to just these 
two?
