Jake,

&gt; Example - the most prominent traineeship offer so far has been at a local
high school,
&gt; Where I would be assisting the administrator in tedious tasks. (Which he
laughed &gt;about in the interview)

    What is your idea of System Administration? I hate to shatter your
illusions, but most of it is tedious tasks. Once a Network is set up
Sysadmin is all about keeping it working efficiently. Hardware breaks - you
fix it. Software breaks - you fix it. Someone tries to crack your system -
you stop them. Most smaller networks have combined Sysadmin/Helpdesk
functions so telling the same person 20 times a week how to open their mail
client without getting pissed off is tedious (don't laugh - surf the net for
the Computer Humour sites - the real stories are funny but sad). To do all
this stuff you have to keep on top of all your documentation and advisories.
Router cupboards and cable ducts are meant to be, but are not the cleanest
places in the world - you may end up being the bunny who cleans them (out
with the dustbuster and rags - no not polish, but at least dust them). If
you do get to install a new sub network, the planning of it is the fun part,
but when you have set up the 20th diskless workstation and tested it, it
maybe isn't fun anymore - especially when it is all you did for a week.

    Sysadmin is not all about playing Quake and blowing away lusers'
accounts (see the BOFH at the Register for reference). Most of it is tedious
and repetitive. That is not to say it cannot be and isn't fun also. There is
some pride in working out why that pesky router has been crashing for the
last year and nobody else has been able to fix it. There is something about
saying to people that you are in charge of a full class C network. I
wouldn't let an offhand comment put you off. If you want real experience you
WANT to get a traineeship with one of these smaller networks like a school,
because it will give you real experience and a bit of independence while you
work. The expectations will be higher on you because you will have more
responsibility - but that is a good thing. If you wait around for a
traineeship with a big company then you will feel like the bottom of the
pile (because you will be). At a larger company, you will be much more
likely to get the "very responsible job" of setting up 200 diskless
workstations - and have it done by the end of the week. You will also be
more likely to tell the same 20 people 20 times a week how to open their
email clients. I would have a chat to a few Sysadmins and try to get a much
better idea of the job if I was you because it seems that maybe what you
think Sysadmin is and what it actually is may not be the same. I would
encourage you to keep trying as well. Playing with hardware and software can
be alot of fun, especially if you get paid to do it - but at the end of the
day a business of any kind is paying you so that the Network does work. Hope
this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
