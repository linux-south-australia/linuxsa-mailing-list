&gt; There are so many things that you need to know and should know about

Kirsty,

100% agreement. It's the principle of "division of labour" as promoted
by Adam Smith in the first 3 chapters of "Wealth of Nations" in 1776.
Here's a relevant quote from the first page of Chapter 3:

===================================================================
	"When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement
to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to
exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is
over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other
men's labour as he has occasion for.

	"There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which
can be carried on no where but in a great town. A porter, for example, can
find employment and subsistence in no other place. A village is by much too
narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary market town is scarce large enough
to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very small
villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the Highlands of
Scotland, every farmer must be butcher, baker and brewer for his own family.
In such situations we can scarce expect to find even a smith, a carpenter,
or a mason, within less than twenty miles of another of the same trade.
The scattered families that live at eight or ten miles distant from the nearest
of them, must learn to perform themselves a great number of little pieces of
work, for which, in more populous countries, they would call in the
assistance of those workmen. Country workmen are almost everywhere obliged
to apply themselves to all the different branches of industry that have so
much affinity to one another as to be employed about the same sort of
materials. [...] It is impossible there should be such a trade as even that
of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the Highlands of Scotland.
Such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails a day, and three hundred working
days in the year, will make three hundred thousand nails in the year. But
in such a situation it would be impossible to dispose of one thousand,
that is, of one day's work in the year."
====================================================================

The moral of this story is that if you live in "so desert a country as 
the Highlands of Scotland", you have to do everything for yourself,
like building and configuring your own linux distribution, fixing bugs,
writing your own scripts and other software, doing your own hardware
circuit design, building your own silicon chip factory, etc. etc. etc.
But otherwise, you just have to know enough to (1) be an intelligent buyer,
and (2) know how to operate what others have designed, (3) know
when it's broken and in need of repair, and (4) know how to fix it
yourself if the "experts" ask the Earth for something simple.

And since none of us in this allegedly "globalized" world lives in
"so desert a country as the Highlands of Scotland", it follows that
we should all just buy a distro that does most of what we want so that
we don't have to spend all day downloading, installing, configuring
the "CVS update du jour" of all 2000 packages on our systems.
Why make your own nails when you can buy a hundred for a dollar?
As set theory lecturers often say: "Learn it, absorb it, and forget it."

The reason I haven't jumped from SuSE (with its comprehensive, up-to-date,
well-packaged Software-Klumpen, but with some fantastically annoying
lack of choice and control in their pointy-clicky install/config tool) to
Gentoo (reputedly a "build it yourself with screws and dowels included" system) 
is the fact that I would then have to check every package to make sure
it's okay. At least with SuSE, I know that they have a reputation to lose
if they packet up something dodgy. By getting a SuSE system, I have the
right trade-off between the maximum-convenience, minimum-control Mac
and the minimum-convenience, maximum-control of Gentoo. I just wish
SuSE would give me a little, teency-weency bit more control.
I worry that if I try Debian, I'll become so religious that I'll start
riding around on a bicycle in a suit with a little book under my arm.

Anyway. It must be time to start work now. Where's my cup of tea...
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
