&gt;&gt;
&gt; Correct, and just by the way, why were we filling up the LCA Helpers
&gt; list with discussion that quite rightly belongs in LinuxSA?
&gt;
&gt; Hence this new posting in this list.
&gt;
&gt; For the benefit of those not on the LCA list, I sent a JPEG to the list
&gt; that Brian's settings with KMail refused to decode. There has been lots
&gt; of to and fro about this including an lengthy examination of KMail by
&gt; Greg (a repost here might be useful Greg).

I sent a message here yesterday, also copying BUGA.  In the meantime
we have about 50 messages on the subject.  If anybody wants to dig
back, contact me and I'll bounce you a couple of the messages.

&gt; My email program is Virtual Access and I have this section set up
&gt; for sending all attachments as MIME. Before any helpful suggestions
&gt; on using any other programs or OS, I MUST use this program and MUST
&gt; use this under Windows because of my longstanding commitments to
&gt; many CompuServe Forums (since 1994). VA is now on SourceForge and
&gt; OpenSource so soon this restriction will be gone and so will most of
&gt; my need for Windows.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, onwards, my help files tell me:
&gt; "
&gt;  Encoding Binary Files
&gt;
&gt;  The encoding method is selected in the Attachments dialog.
&gt;  The default is UUEncode. Check the "Use MIME Encoding" to
&gt;  change this.
&gt;
&gt;  If you send a binary file on the Internet, the file must
&gt;  first be encoded. The most common methods of encoding are
&gt;  UUEncode and MIME.
&gt;
&gt;  CompuServe encodes all files sent via New Mail using MIME.
&gt;  Files sent via Old Mail are UUEncoded by Virtual Access.
&gt; "
&gt;
&gt; So which is the preferred/universal method for file attachment,
&gt;  MIME or UUEncode?

MIME.  I'm not sure I understand the help text, though.  MIME is a set
of standards which describe how to subdivide a mail message into
"attachments".  The individual attachments can have one of a number of
formats.  For example, your image attachments have a base64 encoding,
and your text attachments are 8 bit clean (i.e. plain text).  Here's
what mutt says about the attachments of your most recent message with
an image:

&gt; [-- Attachment #1 --]
&gt; [-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 8bit, Size: 0.1K --]
&gt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, so this time without going through the mailing lists, here is the
&gt; file I sent before.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; [-- Attachment #2: LCA buttons.jpg --]
&gt; [-- Type: image/jpeg, Encoding: base64, Size: 86K --]
&gt; Content-Type: image/jpeg; name="LCA buttons.jpg"
&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
&gt; Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="LCA buttons.jpg"
&gt; 
&gt; [-- image/jpeg is unsupported (use 'v' to view this part) --]

Brian's text attachments are quoted printable, which is a little
obsolete, but that's what KMail does by default:

&gt; [-- Attachment #1 --]
&gt; [-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: quoted-printable, Size: 1.5K --]
&gt; Content-Type: text/plain;
&gt;   charset="iso-8859-1"
&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

These are all MIME.  It was my understanding that uuencoding was an
obsolescent alternative for, say, base64.  I think most MTAs can
handle 8 bit clean text, though.  I note that my MUA (mutt) also
encodes with base64, though, so maybe I'm incorrect there.
