&gt; 1. SCO owns the UNIX trademark and, presumably, the AT&T source code. If 
&gt; any of that has found its way into Linux, that is a problem.

No, SCO bought the trademark and gave it away to The Open Group.

There's no secret to how IBM could have the source code originally owned
by AT&T.  They could have paid for it.  It was for sale (license) almost
for ever.

&gt; SCO's charges are a big problem, because they can effectively scare a lot 
&gt; of companies away from Linux. They can say that they have evidence that 
&gt; their code has turned up in Linux, but refuse to divulge which bits they 
&gt; claim were copied except in court, and that leaves a big cloud over Linux.

I completely agree.  I fully expect Microsoft to use this to their own
benefit and to the open source movement's discredit.
