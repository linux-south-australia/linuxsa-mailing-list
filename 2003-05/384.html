 &gt; Now I compare this with the modern situation.
 &gt; Licensing is so slack now that anyone can get a transmitter,

Not quite true.  Anyone can get a transmitter because there is a license
which explicitly permits it.  The 2.4 GHz band used by 802.11 is covered
by a class license.

 &gt; and enforcement doesn't seem that strict either. 

Send a signal which interferes with my employers Microwave links. 
Then I'll ask you again whether you think enforcement doesn't seem
strict (I might need to book some visiting hours and walk through a 
metal detector to ask you the question, though)

 &gt; I once complained about interference to overseas HF band stations I was
 &gt; listening to and the govt enforcement guy said he could only
 &gt; take action if Australian commercial stations were being interfered with.

That's not entirely true.  International use of frequencies is worked 
out by a treaty system, so it'd come down to a question of whether the
transmitting station was licensed in his country of origin, and whether
that license was in accordance with whatever treaty there is between 
Australia and that country, among other things.  So the ACA would need
to engage a lawyer who specialized in international telecommunications
law.

Frankly, they don't give enough of a shit, given that the economic 
value of your communications is likely to be unmeasureable.  If you
could put up a case to say that the transmitting station was causing
economic damage (and if you had a license to use that frequency) then
you might have seen a different outcome;  But I can't see the ACA
spending tens of thousands of dollars worth of taxpayers money just
because Alan Kennington is annoyed :-)

 &gt; So I see a simple solution to the problem of 802.11 units being programmed
 &gt; to go out of band:
 &gt; -	Only sell these units to people with licences.

Ah.  You must mean this license, right?

(note that anyone can buy any radio they want, whether or not they have
a license.  it's operating that radio that requires the license)

 &gt; -	Only give 802.11 operator's licences to people after they
 &gt; 	have passed a morse test and shown an ability to design
 &gt; 	SSB transceivers using beam tetrodes (or pentodes).

Way to go.  You've just killed 99.9% of wireless LAN usage, and removed
several billion dollars per year from world telecommunications expenditure,
and destroyed the hundreds of Australian businesses which sell the stuff,
operate it, and build networks with it.  What on earth are you trying to
achieve?

 &gt; -	Monitor and prosecute people who are out of band, whether
 &gt; 	or not they're interfering with a commercial transmission. 

This happens now, trust me.

 &gt; So there's my solution - give'm tetrodes and morse! Or the modern
 &gt; equivalent. I.e. it's the operator's responsibility to obey the law,
 &gt; and every 802.11 operator should have a licence which requires them to
 &gt; demonstrate a full understanding of the regulations and technical
 &gt; competence.

The class license system that's in place now is designed specifically 
to allow an industry (and its associated economy) to grow without that
kind of arbitrary and rigid government interference.

 &gt; But I guess the Oz govt's already signed some trade agreement which says
 &gt; that we can't restrict trade in this way. Goodbye sovereignty....

No, the Oz Government has decided that it wants its citizens to have the
ability to participate in the economic opportunities that this particular
bit of spectrum can offer.  Surely that's a brilliant example of what
sovereignty is -for-.
