from another email:

&gt; &gt; PS for some reason, the last mail I sent you bounced with a 
&gt; "550: we 
&gt; &gt; don't accept mail from spammers" error. I am not aware of being a 
&gt; &gt; spammer, and have checked my logs, and see no evidence of 
&gt; being used 
&gt; &gt; for spam (and I am not an open relay). Perhaps you or someone else 
&gt; &gt; could let me know why this might be happenning -- I can't 
&gt; tell if it's 
&gt; &gt; the "<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>" address, or the IP address of my 
&gt; &gt; mailserver
&gt; &gt; (202.6.145.73) that would be doing this. Cheers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; yes, the whole of 202.* is banned due to the amount of spam 
&gt; from thos domains Sign of the times..

Great. I don't know if other people are doing this too, but it's pretty
annoying, and I'm only trying to send free help to Kevin here... I would
be livid if this was business...

As I understand, 202.* is actually 16000-odd class C networks. My
impression of this is that 202.* could be coming from anywhere, and it's
just 202.6.145.* that "goes togther". (without getting too technical).
Banning 202.* is surely overkill. Anyway, regardless of that, what can
be done? I only have control of a /29 within 202, and no spam comes from
there... Sigh. What to do, what to do?
