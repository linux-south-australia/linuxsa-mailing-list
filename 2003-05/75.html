&gt;&gt;The problem with the wording is a big one IMO. There shouldn't be 
&gt;&gt;legislation to mandate the use of Open Source over proprietary software. 
&gt;&gt;This is too restrictive and would never be acceptable to a majority. The 
&gt;&gt;mandate should be to avoid lock-in software, ie. open *Standards* should 
&gt;&gt;always be used - Then it matters a less whether the source is open or 
&gt;&gt;not, because you can always change vendors if required.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Depends a bit on your definition of an "open standard" - should it
&gt; require that at least two separate implementations of the standard
&gt; exist or only that the protocol/formats are documented? If there is
&gt; only one vendor then you can effectively get locked in you don't have
&gt; the source code. If there is only one implementation then how do you
&gt; measure that they are compliant against the standard (which they may
&gt; well have written themself?)
&gt; 
&gt; Chris

Obviously you would test for compliance the same way that you would test 
for any other requirements (acceptance testing etc). The point is that 
if you are being screwed it would be a lot easier to find anther vendor 
if those others don't have to reverse engineer the formats being used, 
and don't have to worry about it being incrementally altered just to 
frustrate those trying to duplicate it. I would also hazard a guess that 
any application based on an open standard that is reasonably popular 
will most likely have an open source implementation also (There are 
plenty out there that are based on *closed* standards).

Barney

PS. I personally think that open source is better than closed in this 
context, I just don't think that it should be enforced unilateraly, 
especially if the best product available for the job is closed source.
