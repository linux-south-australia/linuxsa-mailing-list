----- Original Message ----- 
From: jason
&gt;I am currently in the market to purchase a new laptop before the end of the
financial year. My &gt;budget is @$4000.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any suggested retailers/resellers here in adelaide that
are helpful ?
&gt;
&gt;Is there a particular model/brand people have had problems with that I
should stay away from ?

I bought my Toshiba Satellite 1110 at Harvey Norman.  Yes, they have a poor
range and the prices can sometimes be lousy, but they gave me 17 month
interest free no deposit terms ;-)

This is the top model Satellite 1110 but it's reasonably cheap and the
quality is only "good" not "great" as a Toshiba should be.  One motherboard
has already been replaced...  With a budget of $4k you can easily get a
'real' Toshiba not manufactured by Compal.  Apparently the way to tell is
that 'real' Toshibas run at 15v while Compals are 19v.  I'm sure this will
change someday (or may have already), but it appears to be a good yardstick
to go by.  Most top tier manufacturers OEM a good deal of their product line
anyway (Sony, Dell, IBM, NEC, etc).

If you do decide to get a Toshiba the service centre in Adelaide (BMS
Technology) is very good to deal with and they have always dealt with me
promptly and curtisouly.  Replacement parts arrive the next day and the
laptop is up and running that day.  Only the Toshiba head office in Sydney
sometimes introduce some delays in answering questions but there's not much
BMS can do about it.

See ya
