&gt; Kirsty,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Microsoft will license the rights to Unix technology from SCO Group, a
&gt; &gt; move that could impact the battle between Windows and Linux in the
&gt; &gt; market for computer operating systems.
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder whether this is because:
&gt; 
&gt;  a) Microsoft want to bankroll SCO before IBM makes it fall flat on its
&gt;     face
&gt;
Why would Microsoft do that though?  SCO develop server systems, as does 
Microsoft (although, still in its infancy with this venture).  My personal 
opinion is that it is in Microsoft's interest to discredit Linux as a 
viable option and certainly, there have been some grumbles at work as to 
whether we should use it or not.
 
&gt;  b) Microsoft actually have borrowed some Unix technology using a
&gt;     licence that would be unpalatable for the public to know (i.e. they
&gt;     didn't steal it but kept the licence secret [1]) and might get egg
&gt;     on its face if SCO suddenly realises it has
&gt;
Of course they have borrowed Unix technology - they actually sell a 
product specifically aimed at the Windows/*nix mixed environments.  Not 
that I know many people that use it, but it does exist.  Not exactly in 
the same vein, but I remember spending two hours explaining to a Microsoft 
only SysAdmin that *nix had been using LDAP and DNS technologies for 
years.  Slightly more subjective, I then went on to explain to this guy 
that AD was simply a bastardised copy of these technologies and that 
probably took another few hours or so (and plenty of beer). *shrug*
 
&gt; DSL
&gt; 
&gt; [1] Note: I am not implying that Microsoft is acting illegally; I'm
&gt; talking about a similar situation to various authorities--generally
&gt; ecclesiastical--who, as part of a settlement, insert clauses such as
&gt; "You shall not speak of this to anyone not bound by privacy laws (eg.
&gt; you could speak to a counsellor in a professional doctor/patient
&gt; relationship but not to the media).". That is to say, the agreement is
&gt; legal but not necessarily ethical from various perspectives.
&gt;
understood
