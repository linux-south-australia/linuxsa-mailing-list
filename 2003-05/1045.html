Brian, all,

Excuse irrelevant attached image -- there *is* a reason... read below.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; the line starting with "---" is the name and date of the first file.
&gt; the line starting with "+++" is the name and date of the first file.
&gt; lines starting with "@@" are the locations of the changes in each file

&gt;   (distinguished by + and -), and specifying the line number of the
start
&gt;   of this section of changes, and the number of lines that are listed.
&gt; lines starting with " " are the same in both files
&gt; lines starting with "-" are in the first but not the second
&gt; lines starting with "+" are in the second but not the first

... the thing I forgot to say here is that large sections of identical
content are not included in the output. Hence, the fact that you saw no
message content in Greg's diff indicates that the content was identical
-- apart from that footer.

... which makes me wonder -- did the message that I sent with an
attachment at about 1am (Subject: RE: Help! I've been blacklisted! [was
Re: adelaide IT jobs]) appear to you as a message with lots of stuff
included inline, or was it as a separate attachment. If you found it
inline (not an attachment), then it's likely that your mail client is
getting confused by the LinuxSA footer ... which would explain what's
happenning on the lca list too... Just for experiment's sake, I've
included a (very small) image as an attachment in this email... You
should get two copies of it, one from LinuxSA, and one from me. Do they
both work, or just one?
