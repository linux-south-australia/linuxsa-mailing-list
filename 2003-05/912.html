Argh, I do deserve all of the abuse.
In my defense all I can say is I wrote / posted / and linked in haste. (Late for date (nice date + matrix 2.. = haste)

sylpheed needs a spellchecker interface - eek. Ill go look when I have time.
=)



Sorry guys.

Anyway a few things:

1 - I changed the permissions on the link.
2 - I went too resave the word doc file as a txt but it asked me too install some other dodgy filter 
	- Microsoft.. What can I say?
	- I don't have the office cd handy atm.

3 - Matt Pearce - thanks dude, that was worth the post. =/

4 - Richard Russell,
	Thanks for a lengthy reply, Thank You - but don't cut me any slack for being 17, that's exactly my problem.
		Don't age restrictions suck? My close circles of friends are all 2-3 years older than me.
		That doesn't always work well (&lt;18 != Great Weekends)

	I've fixed the link (argh forgot too chmod the doc file.), maybe ill check before I post next time.

	Spectacular stuff? Hardly anything magical but for my job hopes sake ill list a few achievements that come too mind.
		# I've been working in IT since I was 16 - all be it voluntary (thirst for knowledge and job hopes).
		# At age 16 I got a contract almost $3k. 80% perhaps through the project my employer did a runner on me.
		  ( He went interstate for personal / business reasons im told.)

		# After breaking my back on the first day of yr 12 (isn't that spectacular???)
 		 I returned 6 months later I successfully completed yr12 and kept far ahead in my IT Cert IV Course (with every merit possible so far).

		# have been offered partnership in a prominent business in the Adelaide cbd (Programming/Web Design)
		  I won't mention the name of the business, but it was located King William / Hinley Street.
			- Which _I_ turned for various reasons.
		
	"Being offered a few traineeships sounds like a pretty good situation to be in for a 17 year old."
	Sure, but 1 - ugh.. So far all traineeships I have been offered are great, but offer me nothing in the way of learning.
		Example - the most prominent traineeship offer so far has been at a local high school,
			Where I would be assisting the administrator in tedious tasks. (Which he laughed about in the interview)
			My latest part time job has been working in a few schools as a system administrator.
			Which I have been doing for nearly 6months now.

5 - Jordan Noblet,
	I have fixed the permissions problem, I forgot too chmod.

	"Poo-poo the study bit all you like, but you'll find that you'll learn more by doing (i.e. working)
	Than by most traditional "training" techniques."

	I never poo-poo'd study, I wasn't asking too just drop into a perfect job. If u read the above you will see that I have already worked on this method.

	Great advice thanks

6 - David Finch,
	Ha-ha, I agree. As I mentioned earlier with the office/cd lack I couldn't post a txt (lol)
		- Well at least not nicely formatted


7 - Richard Sharpe,
	Lots of time? I wish,
	But don't we all wish we had more?
	Maybe Alan Kennington doesn't, he has allot of time from what I can see from his activity on linuxsa
	=)

8 - Alan Kennington,
	Wow, I had too get another coffee to read that, your English teachers must have hated you.
	Although it was full of direct points and didn't stray far from the topic cheers.
