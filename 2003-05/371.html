Hi Chris,

Of course they can.

I suppose it's really about setting fences to jump.  This
seems reasonably successful in other areas of the kernel.
For example, you could easily modify TCP to be non-fair,
giving yourself a 10%-odd performance boost but if too
many people do it there will be congestion collapse of the
Internet.

Fortunately, the TCP code is pretty complex, so the
fence is pretty tall.

This isn't so for some drivers.  For example, the per-country
frequency assignments in wireless drivers is just an array
of integers.  If you are in a dense WiFi area then it
makes sense to the selfish to fiddle those numbers and
get a uncongested frequency.  Of course, the national
spectrum regulator may have allocated that frequency
to some other purpose.

This wasn't an issue until recently, when the frequency
range of 802.11 chipsets increased impressively.

There's a simple long-run fix -- the chip vendor provides
a table of frequency assignments and a verifying hash and
the chipset refuses to load assignments which fail the hash.

Of course, changing the firmware downloaded to the chipset
could still allow people to alter the frequency assignments.
That's just a very tall fence to climb :-)

In the meantime, holding the assignments in a binary module
with some checksum verification sets a reasonably tall fence
with the advantage that most people that are capacble of hacking
with the assignments know better than to do so.

I really can't see much of another way forward with the
current Intel and Broadcom chipsets and the national
regulators' concerns.

Best wishes,
Glen
