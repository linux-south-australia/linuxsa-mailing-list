Moved to the BUGA and linuxsa mailing lists.  This doesn't have
anything to do with LCA any more.  I've BCCd the lists so that people
know what's going on.

Intro for the newcomers: Brian has trouble with KMail.  I took at look
at it and had trouble too, though the trouble doesn't seem to overlap.

&gt;
&gt; First, thank you for going to so much trouble.

You're welcome.  But my real reason, as I said at the end, was part of
the research for my paper :-)

&gt; I have not had any of the problems you describe - I sort in
&gt; milliseconds, not even seconds, let alone minutes,

Probably with less data, as you indicate below.

&gt; and yes you CAN sort by size, but you have to display size in your
&gt; listing first (see Settings, Configure KMail, Appearance, Layout).

Yes, I thought that might be possible.  But the defaults are bad.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; That looks OK to me.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe it does, but this doesn't look OK to me:

This looks like a configuration problem.  Can you read your own jpeg
attachment?  Here's what's actually in the mail <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

1.  Ian's message:

    --Next part of message (VA.0000088f.004406d2:airnet.com.au)

2.  Your message:

    --------------Boundary-00=_M90HONLHD3TJ2YXKZ1EZ
    Content-Type: image/jpeg;
      name="thoughts.jpg"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

    /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLDBkSEw8UHRofHh0a
    HBwgJC4nICIsIxwcKDcpLDAxNDQ0Hyc5PTgyPC4zNDL/2wBDAQkJCQwLDBgNDRgyIRwhMjIyMjIy

In other words, they're pretty much identical.

&gt; This does, however (from a message received from a friend, recently)
&gt;
&gt;  [symbol omitted] NuDizT.jpg
&gt; JPEG File Interchange

It's difficult to say what that is.

&gt; I can save that image to disk, or view it immediately at my choice,
&gt; without any problem.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;  In addition, I needed a "name", defaulting to
&gt;&gt;   "unnamed".  I have no idea what that's intended to be.
&gt;
&gt; It's asking you to make your own choice of name.

Of course I understand that.  But why should I choose a name?  For
what?  Doesn't it know I'm running UNIX and already have defined every
name that I need.

&gt;&gt; 12.  So I thought "there must be a search function".  Yes, it's
&gt;&gt; there. As far as I can tell, it's pretty much useless.  It takes
&gt;&gt; forever for only 1600 messages, and it opens a new window with four
&gt;&gt; columns across the left of the window (the rest is empty) and a
&gt;&gt; truncated subject line (they all say "Re: [lca2004-helpers]"). They
&gt;&gt; don't show the size, so it's difficult to find what I'm looking for.
&gt;
&gt; That is an RTFM problem, I'm afraid.  Maybe a little impatience, too.
&gt; The truncation would not occur if you widened the "Subject" column.

Yes, I realize that.  But why does it compress the columns and leave
most of the screen blank?

&gt; Space is there for you to widen any column or columns of your
&gt; choice.

I'd prefer not to have to do more work than necessary.

&gt;&gt;  It shows a little icon for the attachment, not
&gt;&gt;  my favourite way of doing things, but bearable.  Select it, get a
&gt;&gt; dialogue box asking if it should be opened with KView.  OK. It
&gt;&gt; displays them (see attachment).
&gt;
&gt; That is exactly what I was expecting, and did not receive.
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, this is what your attachment looks like to me:
&gt; --E69HUUNAyIJqGpVn
&gt; Content-Type: image/gif
&gt; Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="buttons.gif"
&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

Yup, that looks right.  Compare with what I showed above.

&gt;&gt; 5-7.  It should interface with the system.  The whole concept of UNIX
&gt;&gt;       is cooperation: MUAs read and write mail.  MTAs transfer it
&gt;&gt; from one place to another.  Shells and logins define the user.  KMail
&gt;&gt; is trying to do all three.
&gt;
&gt; Why shouldn't it?

&gt;&gt; 12-14: It's inefficient.  Despite setting up index files, sorting a
&gt;&gt;        "folder" with 1600 messages can take up to 10 seconds.  mutt
&gt;&gt;        does the same thing in an imperceptibly short time.
&gt;
&gt; You must have an interesting mail setup :-)

Well, I've been collecting mail messages for over 20 years.  In that
time you get to know a lot of people, and you accumulate a fair amount
of mail.

&gt; I have many mail folders, each folder dedicated to a different list
&gt; or topic, and a fairly comprehensive filter system that puts
&gt; maessages in their place as they are received.  As I read the
&gt; messages in their separate folders I delete them unless the content
&gt; is particularly worth saving.  Thus I do not have any folder which
&gt; contains anything like 1600 messages,

That's approximately the number of messages I receive every day:

  On 23 May 2003 you received 2171 mail messages and sent 42 mail messages.
  On 24 May 2003 you received 1321 mail messages and sent 17 mail messages.
  On 25 May 2003 you received 1639 mail messages and sent 37 mail messages.

&gt; and cannot comment on your experience except to say that maybe Kmail
&gt; is designed to work the way I do, and not the way you do.

MUAs shouldn't make assumptions about how people work, nor how
important they consider their data.

&gt;&gt;        It's limited.  I can't thread, I can't sort by size.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, Greg.  I do both.  That's RTFM again.

OK, for the sake of argument, I've checked this stuff.  Yes, I can
display threads and sizes.  I can't sort by size.  To change from
threaded to non-threaded displays (a thing I do several times a day)
appears to require reconfiguration.  With mutt it's two keystrokes.

I tried to RTFM.  What I get was (expectedly):

  === <A HREF="mailto:grog@sydney">grog@sydney</A> (/dev/ttyp5) ~ 13 -&gt; man kmail
  No manual entry for kmail

All there is is this help facility.  It doesn't appear to be very
good: I can't find any mention of threads in it, for example, so I
can't say with any certainty that I can't easily change the message
display.  I can say with some certainty that it's difficult to find
out how to do it.  For example, I found a reference to using mail
files instead of directories, but I couldn't find any details.

While searching the help files, I *did* find a chapter (7) on
importing data from other MUAs, all of them apparently from the
Microsoft space.  But the idea of importing and exporting data is the
Microsoft way, not the UNIX way.

&gt;&gt;        It's clumsy.  To search for anything I have to push mice
&gt;&gt;        around, and it opens new windows which don't show what you're
&gt;&gt;        looking for.
&gt;
&gt; That is a matter of preference.  Kmail doesn't work the way you prefer.
&gt; Works just fine for me.

It appears that it doesn't.  That's how we started this discussion.
