I changed my post title, so if someone is searching the web looking for 
a Linux scanrouter client for a Richoe or Gestetner multifunctional, 
they can start where I left off and maybe turn this from wasted time 
into something that will help people.

Please note that you also want to check the "Putting it all together / 
office multifunctionals & Linux" thread.

[1]So, that's it for me. The coach took the ball away and is patting me 
on the back as I walk into the dugout. I gotta get back to my life.   :-D

No matter what I do, my Linux desktop, in an attempt to emulate the 
Windows server, still runs on port 21 and not 3670. Yeah, I know FTP 
usually runs on port 21, but apparently Richoe doesn't. So, to reverse 
enginer the way that the Richoe and Windows 2000 communicate to allow 
the Windows machine to act as a scan server, all I gotta do is set up an 
anonymous FTP server from my that listens on port 3670 and allows for 
anonymous users to have read write privileges.

I edited /etc/services, installed proftp from source, changed the 
configuration file in /etc/pure-ftp. Walked on hot coals and jumped 
through burning hoops. 

How complicated can it be to get ftp to listen on the port I want it to? 
  :-(

[1]It was kind of fun for a bit, but I don't see a clean answer here, so 
now its just an annoyance. So much for the clean, easy and seprable 
configuration settings that I hear so much about. (Yeah, I'm ticked.)
