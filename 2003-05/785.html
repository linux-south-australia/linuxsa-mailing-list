Yeah, I recently had a non-award-winning SENet experience...

After being on hold for *45* minutes (despite the automatic system
estimating hold times of under 20 minutes...  they must use the same time
estimation algorithm as Microsoft Installer) I got greeted with a very
unhelpful Tech who seemed to want nothing more than to get me off the line
to deal with the next question.

I was just after an FTP password for one of my website clients, who'd lost
his password and didn't have time to sit about on hold to ask about a bunch
of stuff he didn't understand anyway.

After some brief dialogue, the person evidently couldn't be bothered dealing
with me any more, because he HUNG UP on me !  I followed up immediately with
an email to SENet Tech Support saying that this was inappropriate customer
service, and haven't heard a thing since.

You'd think they'd look after their site hosting clients, because surely
there's more money in that than Dialup ISP services ??  And negative word of
mouth never helped ANYONE'S business !  I'm going to recommend to my client
that he shift his hosting to someone a bit more helpful...

Jason =)

Oddly enough, a friend was just having a good grumble about senet. she
recently had her win98 box reformatted and reinstalled (my idea of fun,
NOT!.)

put in senet setup disk - modem issues. resolved modem issues for her.

still, after that, there was still error 691 (from memory). now, thats a
username/passwd error. the tech guys told her it was mdoem error. she drives
from pt adelaide to her just to have me correct her username - it needed to
have @senet.net,au or whatever added to it.

now :
1) the setup cd didnt indicate this.
2 the tech guys SHOULD have checked that that at very least was correct.

she said her response times with them for tech support have been growing
steadily worse, and was fed up with them. when her contract runs out, she
will be another exiting customer.

i believe senet have been bought out by one of the major national isp
players
- coincidence?

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; Am I alone in my frustration with SeNet?
&gt;
&gt; The problems I've been having with senet cannot possibly be isolated to
me:
&gt;
&gt; * Lousy Voice response system 15+ minutes for just about any business
hours
&gt; call
&gt;
&gt; * Inability to respond in a timely manner to tech queries
&gt;
&gt; * Reticence to hand out direct phone numbers to customers with ongoing
&gt; problems, requiring them to use the Voice Response system, thereby wasting
&gt; their time.
&gt;
&gt; * Support staff do not have the authority or quick access to anyone with
&gt; authority to solve simple problems.
&gt;
&gt; * Failure to carry out promised actions, resulting in interuption of
&gt; services.
&gt;
&gt; * Large infrastructure changes within the organisation, disrupting
&gt; services, esp web services.
&gt;
&gt; I've been a SeNet customer since the early days, Steve Baxter even came
out
&gt; to my house to set up my first ever internet connection. He and Chris
Foote
&gt; had a lot of fun helping me with an install of linux (Slackware 1.2.13)
&gt; onto an IBM Thinkpad.
&gt;
&gt; All that is behind me know, I think I will be in the market for a new ISP
&gt; very shortly, the time costs of dealing with such an unreachable and
&gt; unresponsive organisation in this day and age is unacceptable.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to vent this to the list, but it saddens me to see a good business
&gt; like SeNet go so far downhill. (and I'm frustrated to hell and back with
&gt; the difficulties their problems have forced on me) Maybe the 'All you can
&gt; eat' customers don't know what it used to be like, so this is 'normal' for
&gt; them.
&gt;
&gt; I don't believe the problems are because of the staff, who all seem quite
&gt; reasonable. It's the pressure they are placed under, and the lack of
&gt; authority they are given to make a decision within their roles.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt; Michael
