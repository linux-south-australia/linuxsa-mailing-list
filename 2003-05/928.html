Glen,
Maybe you should expand this to "Glen's guide to resume's - a howto".

not looking for a job but you never know ...]

&gt; 
&gt; Hi Jake,
&gt; 
&gt; Other people have had lots of good advice, so I'll restrain
&gt; myself to your resume.
&gt; 
&gt;   - The most interesting bits of your resume currently
&gt;     have the least detail.  Tell more about the software
&gt;     projects you have worked upon if you want to do more
&gt;     of that work.  How maby lines of code, how many records
&gt;     in the database, etc.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Show don't tell.  If you work on software then put
&gt;     screenshots in your resume.  If there was a sales
&gt;     brouchure put this in too.  Put in the positive
&gt;     news articles.  For example, put in URLs for
&gt;     the pages you did at Oceania.  Your resume should
&gt;     be a sales package (because it is).
&gt; 
&gt;   - Zap the cover page.  Imagine that no-one reads beyond
&gt;     page 2 of your resume unless they are about to hire
&gt;     you and want some small talk in the interview.  Having
&gt;     page 1 basically empty doesn't help sell yourself.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Reorder things to put what the employer wants to know
&gt;     first.  So past employers and skills goes before schooling.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Employers have no idea what a "TAFE Certificate IV
&gt;     Information Technology" is.  You'll need to tell them.
&gt;     The TAFE course guide probably has a nice summary.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Net Media Solutions needs a lot less explanation.
&gt;     You're selling to employers here, they want to hear
&gt;     that you're gung-ho and have no life to get their
&gt;     project done on time.  Don't disabuse them until
&gt;     after you've got the job :-)
&gt; 
&gt;   - Put in comments from employers.  I assume you've got
&gt;     references after each of your contracts and work experience
&gt;     placements.  If not, go and get these now.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Zap the "leaving reason".  Employers don't want to here
&gt;     that you are going to leave them one day.  Instead just
&gt;     incorporate this into the text.  "At my holiday job at the
&gt;     Mondello factory I packed and moved 20Kg bags".  As an
&gt;     aside, list your employer as the factory, not the temping
&gt;     agency which placed you.
&gt; 
&gt;   - If you have a good plain-background digital photo handy,
&gt;     then put this on the right-hand side of the first page.
&gt;     Some people remember faces not names.
&gt; 
&gt;   - The programming skills checklist is good.  Take a
&gt;     company that wants a "PHP programmer with some C skills".
&gt;     They'll start by making a stack of resumes that mention
&gt;     PHP and C and discarding the rest.  You made that bit
&gt;     easy for them.
&gt; 
&gt;     Now they'll want to short-list that stack.  But you haven't
&gt;     given them any idea of the level of your PHP skills.  Are
&gt;     you "expert", "competent", "have used", etc.  And you haven't
&gt;     given them any objective measures to reinforce that opinion.
&gt; 
&gt;     Something I find works is
&gt; 
&gt;         Programming language    Skill      Accomplishments
&gt; 
&gt;                  C             Expert    Co-wrote 20,000 lines of
&gt;                                          C code to implement TCP/IP
&gt;                                          on IBM-compatible mainframe.
&gt; 
&gt;                  Perl         Laughable  Wrote a 150 line program to
&gt;                                          strip passwords, it still
&gt;                                          doesn't work
&gt; 
&gt;     Hmm.  Perhaps I'll just say "written some short utility programs" for
&gt;     the second.
&gt; 
&gt;     Also list important technologies.  For example
&gt; 
&gt;          Apache modules    Expert   Wrote module in C to do access control
&gt;                                     based on BGP attributes, such as a
&gt;                                     user's ISP.
&gt; 
&gt;          OSPF, BGP         Expert   Contributed BGP Looking Glass extensions
&gt;                                     to Zebra routing code.
&gt;                                     &lt;<A HREF="http://www.zebra.org/&gt">http://www.zebra.org/&gt</A>;
&gt; 
&gt;     In you case this might involve aspects of PHP, such as the database
&gt;     used.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Be concrete in eveything.  There's a few areas of
&gt;     vagueness.  Eg: replace "I have been trained in several
&gt;     different sections of the company" with "I was trained to
&gt;     Flip Hamburgers, Greet Customers, ..."  Basically, some
&gt;     employers think you are hiding something bad when being
&gt;     vague, so don't do it.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Mention small certificates.  Driver's license (stating full or auto),
&gt;     first aid certificate, etc.  These won't get you the
&gt;     job but they do make people more comfortable in hiring
&gt;     you and it's something people forget to ask about at interview.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Alter DOB to "Birth date: 11 June 1985, Adelaide" or whatever.
&gt;     This addresses the citizenship question for employers which work
&gt;     on military projects.
&gt; 
&gt;   - If you are in the CFS or Army Reserve or give blood or ... state
&gt;     this in the resume. There are two employer reactions to this.
&gt;     The ones that place you in the "not" pile you don't want to
&gt;     work for anyway.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Replace all the abbreviations.  Employers are older than
&gt;     you.  Often by a few generations.  They may not have been
&gt;     raised in Australia.  They have no idea what "Yr R - 3"
&gt;     means.  At least "Reception to Year 3" gives them a fighting
&gt;     chance to mentally translate to "Kindergarten to Third Grade"
&gt;     if that's what they need to do.
&gt; 
&gt;   - "Subjects for future".  Convert this from a list to prose
&gt;     (to distinguish what has been done from what you plan to
&gt;     do) and make it more concrete.  "Next year I plan to take
&gt;     evening classes to obtain a Microsoft Certified Engineer (MSCE)
&gt;     certificate".
&gt; 
&gt;     At the moment it's not impressive because it's way too long.
&gt;     There's at least three years work to do all that list.  It looks
&gt;     better to have a concrete short term plan than a wishy-washy
&gt;     long-term plan (which isn't to say don't have long term plans,
&gt;     but that you don't put everything into a sales pitch).
&gt; 
&gt;   - Put an area code on your phone number.  And its a "telephone"
&gt;     not a "ph".  "Telephone: (08) 1234 5678".
&gt; 
&gt;   - If you've won anything on merit, or have passionate hobby,
&gt;     or have written a substantial work then mention that (unless
&gt;     it's  controversial).   Employers want to know that they are
&gt;     hiring sucessful people.  Don't fret if you don't have
&gt;     anything yet, these pile up as the years pass.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Some employers will want you to work interstate (either
&gt;     fulltime or for periods), or travel, or work long hours
&gt;     at critical times [eg: my answer is yes; yes; not on Thursdays].
&gt;     Have a position on these.  Mention  them in the resume if
&gt;     positive, leave them for the interview if not.
&gt; 
&gt; Best of luck,
&gt; Glen
&gt; 
&gt;
