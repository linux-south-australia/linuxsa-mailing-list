James,

Definitely not. At each point where SaX2 is invoked, that's when the screen
locks. But when I run YaST2 remotely, a control-C gets me out of it.
This is what I just found in the file /var/log/SaX.log:
(The file is 931 lines long. So I'll edit it a bit.)

================================================================

I gather now that the "got run" means that X thinks it's running, whereas
in fact the monitor is very unhappy with the signal it's getting.
The later "could not open" things must come from me trying to
run the X server from a remote monitor.

&gt; &gt;The installation seems to go normally until X is run -- and then the
&gt; &gt;screen goes blank and the lights flash on the monitor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Does a GUI come up during the installation?  If not, then it is not 
&gt; being detected. You need to find out what the specs on your monitor are 
&gt; and then enter them in sax manually.

The config software correctly saw that I had a Hyundai monitor,
although maybe its parameters were wrong.
"max sax2" doesn't mention any config files for SaX2.
I guess it just generates the XF86Config file.
So I suppose I'll have to edit that a bit.

The broader problem is apparently that SuSE have decided as a marketing
decision to remove heaps of config options from the installation process
so that they can claim that it's really quick.
Yes it is - if you install only the 10% of stuff that they offer by default -
but then it doesn't work after the installation.
(Even things like "locate" aren't installed if you ask for the maximum
installation packages!)
I'd rather spend 1 hour longer on installation and 20 hours less on
fixing problems caused by incorrect/incomplete installation.

&gt; &gt;I still have 3 sound cards which are resisting all attempts at configuration.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I am just curious,  what kernel are you using? Is sound enabled? If so, 
&gt; have you gone to alsa.org and downloaded the driver, installed it and 
&gt; ran the utility I mentioned in a recent post?

These are mostly linux kernel 2.4.20 - the one with the local vulnerability.
Very definitely the sound modules are there, because I can load them
with modprobe etc.
But they don't work excpet for making a squeaky little noise, and they
don't link up to the ALSA software. And so forth....
It's so woeful, I hate to even think about it.
I was hoping that by setting up this new machine with all new software
straight out of the box, it might work better. But now I can't even
get it to run X.

ALSA is the default software that SuSE installs for music.
Sometimes it even works. It worked on one of my machines for
a while and I can't it to work again.
The trouble is that I don't understand the "concept of operations"
of ALSA - even though I read all the docs I could find on ALSA about
3 years ago (when it failed miserably to make contact over optical
fibre with my then-new Roland VS880-EXHD 8-track digital recorder, which cost
me A$2500 and has collected dust for the last 3 years because the ALSA
drivers couldn't do optical SPDIF - I try not to complain, but
virtually nothing works properly with linux for me...).
I'm hoping that this newly set-up machine with non-working X will
at least work for optical SPDIF and OpenH.323 and ALSA.
If not, I'll have to set up a couple of machines and stick WindXYZ on them!!
I'll be eating at the soup kitchen by July if I dont' get this
sound stuff going soon...

Anyway, I'll just hack yet another night away and forget about productive
work for a while.... (My last 3 days have been a write-off due to
linux config problems. If I added up the financial cost of my time,
then linux would be a very costly OS indeed. I only use linux because I
hate monopolists and I have an almost religious zeal for seeing the source.)
One moment I'm writing 300 lines a day of linux kernel code
to create the world's best implementation of a new RFC, next moment
I'm spending several days on trivial config tasks.

===========================================================
Now having a look at it a bit more, I've found that if I kill
a program "xapi", the screen lock is removed and I get back
to where I was before.
So now I don't have to re-boot every time I try to config the X server.

(That is a constant problem with SaX2, which stupidly uses X to
configure X - so if it doesn't work, you can't fix it!!
The old SaX used to have a text-only mode. But I guess the
marketing people didn't like its looks so much.
This is the problem with the rush to imitate the MS pointy-clicky
approach to everything. The advantage of unixes is that you can always
get out of every problem - if you're prepared to give up such
luxuries as sleep and social life. The big distros have turned their
backs on the greatest strength of unixes - the text command line.)


So.... nose to the grind stone, shoulder to the wheel, elbow grease ready...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
