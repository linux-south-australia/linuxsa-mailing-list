&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I am not familiar with tape robots and the like, but am in a position
&gt; where a client might be able to get hold of a particularly cheap robot
&gt; for themselves -- but they'll want me to configure it. It's an "ACL
&gt; 4/52", which means it has space for 52 tapes and 4 tape drives (it has 3
&gt; DLT4000's installed, and 50 tapes). It has an Ultra-Wide differential
&gt; SCSI interface. We use AMANDA running off a Linux system to do our
&gt; backups at present, writing to a single DLT drive (I can't recall if
&gt; it's DLT4000 or DLT7000...).
&gt; 
&gt; How can I go about telling whether this will be managable by AMANDA on
&gt; Linux? 

the short answer is amanda _should_ drive it...
have a look on the amanda web site at the strange doc/faq thing they
have there...

&gt; Where do I find out what tape robots are supported?

look under tape changers. an example would be the 6 slot DDS4 changer
made by HP/SONY/QUANTUM/... or the 8 slot SDLT made by HP/Quantum/..
but i've not used a multi-drive tape loader with amanda before,
so YMMV...

&gt; What does "differenctial" in "Ultra-Wide differential SCSI" mean?

differential scsi uses two cables instead of one.
its similar to the concept of extra cabling for redundancy, but
electrically its more complex, using +X volts on channel A and -X volts on
channel B. comparitors checking the signals are the same absolute
value... or think of it like parity. differential scsi also allows much
longer cables. its also plenty more expensive!

cheers,

Kim
