Kirstu.

&gt; Just based on your thoughts above, I would go with Bugzilla.

I would tend to agree except I don't it. Essentially, I'm thinking
something along the lines of:

 "Hmmm...the best solution is something that I don't like."

..and when I get to such a situation I tend to mull things out aloud.

&gt; depending on what you need the users to do, it could simply be a
&gt; matter of deleting all the irrelevant stuff (complications?) from the
&gt; existing pages.

True.

However, it would be nice to have a tool that was built with Debian in
mind and Bugzilla isn't. "reportbug" which is part of Debian adds some
Debian specific stuff to the reports which Bugzilla doesn't.

I've taken a look at bug-buddy (Gnome and Ximina's bug tool) but it's
not quite usable with the Debian BTS or Debian system's yet.

One of the things I like about reportbug (a horrid, complicated, totally
undocumented, impossible to understand conglomerate of python that
interprets a web-server whose scripts are written in Perl - AARGH) is
that it will flag things like:

 "Oh, but the FREEBSD package isn't installed. What are you talking
  about"

[ok, so I paraphrased it a little]

Bug-Buddy can do this but not against a Debian apt-repository
dynamically.

I *could* wrap reportbug into a GUI...now there's a thought. A horrid
thought. A totally horrid thought...but it would work. I think.

&gt; Not having documentation is a big negative in my mind.  The sql
&gt; backend is a positive (for both products).

There's no SQL backend for Deb. BTS. Or documentation about how to set
it up...

&gt; Are you sure you want to restrict your available options to just these
&gt; two?

We've taken a glance about and there seems to be:

 * Bugzilla
 * The Debian BTS
 * Jitterbug
 * Something called "Mantis"

We're not really stuck with these two but they seem to be the most
likely.


DSL

(1) Hint: I like the Debian BTS as found at:
     - <A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/">http://bugs.debian.org/</A>

    ...if only it had a nicer way to enter bugs
