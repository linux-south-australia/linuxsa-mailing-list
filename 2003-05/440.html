Michael,

Agreed, 100 percent. But having followed this policy for the last
several years, I find myself constantly saddened by the fact that
I have to use a subset of the hardware that other people can use.
But then again, everything that I do buy has clear specs in source
software which I can re-engineer over the next 10 years, if need be,
to keep getting more out of the thing. 

I think the question is not just: Can you use the thing for years?
But rather: Can you use that hardware to the full?
The existence of linux driver source generally signifies that the interface
spec is open and available, and you have sample interface code to
start with if you want to extract 100% of capabilities out of the hardware.

One way of thinking about this is:

-	Linux is a project.
-	MS software is a product range.
-	The Mac is a lifestyle accessory.

Anyone with engineering or scientific instincts wants to get full
access to everything they buy - not just a product that works or
an accessory that complements their bohemian lifestyle.
(Fridges and washing machines may be exceptions. But not toasters.)

I'm sure I remember someone (an engineer) explaining to me in the late 1980s 
that the reason the Mac didn't catch on in the PC market was because it was
a closed box whereas the IBM architecture was open for expansion boards.
And closed software is no more useful than a closed box.
I think that this is why open software must prevail some time soon now.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
