Replies to his own email : )
It was the ide-scsi paramater that was causing the problemo. This was being 
passed to the hard drive (hdd) when it should have been the cdrom (hdc), by 
grub. Once reconfigured grub did its job correctly. New hard drives change 
the disk numbering hdd &gt; hdc. This can create problems

&gt; The PC is now bootable with its new drive- so some progress. One of my

&gt; Is it ok to have the CDrom as Secondary Master and hdd1 (40GB Seagate) as
&gt; Secondary Slave ?
&gt; The reason I ask is because I cannot mount hdd1 yet. I am getting error
&gt; messages about an ide-disk driver not present and Reiserfsck failing when
&gt; the system boots. Yet when booting into rescue and running reiserfsck it on
&gt; this drive it completes without any problems.

&gt; &gt; I am having trouble getting a new HD installed. I have tried a lot of
&gt; &gt; different configurations of Prim Master/Slave and Secondary Master/Slave.
&gt; &gt; The disk shows in bios and it shows on the boot screen. But the system
&gt; &gt; hangs after this. It will not boot. As soon as I take it out the boot
&gt; &gt; process works ok. Grub then does its job. When the new drive is back in
&gt; &gt; the PC grub will not work.
&gt; &gt; The boot drive is hda1 (existing). I am wishing to add a new 40GM
&gt; &gt; Seagate. I have played around with the jumper settings on the back to no
&gt; &gt; avail.
