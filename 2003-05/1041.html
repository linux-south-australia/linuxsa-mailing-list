&gt; &gt; You may do whatever you want. However, if you 
&gt; indiscriminately accuse 
&gt; &gt; me of spam, which you have (that's the only thing that your 
&gt; rejection 
&gt; &gt; email does), and give me no way of saying "no, this isn't spam" (if 
&gt; &gt; you reject all mail, I can't contact you), and refuse to fix your 
&gt; &gt; broken setup
&gt; 
&gt; Its not broken, it is working exactly the way I set it up. It 
&gt; is sendmail and that is the behavior of the beast. As for the 
&gt; 'indescrimante' accusation of spam, it is just basic message 
&gt; from sendmail, directly out of the docs as it goes. Never 
&gt; really say much point in saying more. So now it reads.. 
&gt; ERROR:"550  This domain has been identified as a source of SPAM"

... which is indiscriminate (despite the original being from sendmail's
doco -- I'd suspect that it was never meant to be used on ranges of IPs
like 202.*), and gives the recipient no idea *why* ... is it a rbl list,
or is it just this admin? How does the user get around this? Suppose
someone wanted to contact you or one of your clients, for business,
pleasure, or whatever. They get this in response. There is nothing else
they can possibly do, despite the fact that they have done nothing to
deserve this accusation apart from having a 202.* IP address, which a
LOT of people have... (I suspect that anyone on Adam.net.au who runs
their own mailserver would be likely to have a 202 address -- certainly,
Walford School does, as does Westminster, and these are just a couple of
the places that I know of off the top of my head).

Note also that your correction is actually *wrong*, because it's not the
domain, but the IP address.

&gt; I really dont see the need to write an essay on it.

Nor do I. As I said, you can do whatever you want, but if you
indiscriminately accuse me of spam with no indication of why or how to
get off the blacklist and onto the whitelist, expect me (and others --
they will come, they will come) to kick up a stink. I've done so, and
I've said more than enough.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You will ALWAYS get spam. ALWAYS. There is NO KNOWN WAY of 
&gt; getting rid 
&gt; &gt; of all of it.
&gt; 
&gt; No arguement there...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Every other way (spamassassin etc) is less indiscriminate,
&gt; and less effective
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and most of them at least give people a way of finding out why they 
&gt; &gt; have been blocked. Even using rbls gives more fine-grained control 
&gt; &gt; than 202.*, and, importantly, lets users know what they can 
&gt; do to get 
&gt; &gt; off the blackhole list.

&gt; As I mentioned in an earlier mail, I have listened to people 
&gt; and removed that block Why do you persist with it?

I received the same rejection from your address at 10:42pm in response
to the email you are replying to. I shall attach that rejection note to
this email in full.

I've emailed you directly, and CC'd jake, simply to test whether the
rejection is still occurring or not. You should both receive emails
off-list as well as on the list. If you don't, then the block is still
there. I will not contact you again about this, because it's just not
worth my effort. :)

&gt; This is a _private_ network, it is shared for some who wish 
&gt; free hosting. It is not available for emails to others except 
&gt; my family and a few who would like free hosting. There are no 
&gt; accounts for legions of users or businesses queueing up for 
&gt; service, it is mine, and I will admin it how I wish. If your 
&gt; domain is part of a block that is know for spam, tough!

You may do whatever you want. However, if you indiscriminately accuse me
of spam, which you have (that's the only thing that your rejection email
does), and give me no way of saying "no, this isn't spam" (if you reject
all mail, I can't contact you), and refuse to fix your broken setup when
I go out of my way to tell you that I'm not a spammer (which I did, yet
mail is still being rejected), and if I want to send email to someone
who uses your mail server, expect me (and anyone else who you do the
same to) to call you on it (which I have done). At this point in time, I
really don't care any more, especially as there is unlikely to be many
people there who I want to contact. 

&gt; If you have better suggestions for the handling of spam, I am 
&gt; always open to them, I have used SpamAssasin, bogofilter and 
&gt; others but still it persists from some domains, some say that 
&gt; my blocking Yahoo is extreme, some say it is a good measure.

You will ALWAYS get spam. ALWAYS. There is NO KNOWN WAY of getting rid
of all of it. Every other way (spamassassin etc) is less indiscriminate,
and most of them at least give people a way of finding out why they have
been blocked. Even using rbls gives more fine-grained control than
202.*, and, importantly, lets users know what they can do to get off the
blackhole list.

I got particularly irritated with your setup because I couldn't even
find out why I was blocked -- was it a wrong blocking list that was
shared by many, or is it just a single admin somewhere? If I'm on a
blocking list of some sort, I am really concerned, and will put
significant effort into getting myself off it. If it's just a single
admin, I don't care as much, but will still put some effort into
correcting them, in case I need to contact someone on that server at
some stage.
