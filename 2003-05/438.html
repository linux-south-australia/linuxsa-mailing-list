Hi Kim, all,

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; How can I go about telling whether this will be managable 
&gt; by AMANDA on 
&gt; &gt; Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; the short answer is amanda _should_ drive it...
&gt; have a look on the amanda web site at the strange doc/faq 
&gt; thing they have there...

Ummm... I've poked at most things on www.amanda.org, and can't find
anything about tape changers or robots... could you nudge me towards it?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Where do I find out what tape robots are supported?
&gt; 
&gt; look under tape changers. an example would be the 6 slot DDS4 
&gt; changer made by HP/SONY/QUANTUM/... or the 8 slot SDLT made 
&gt; by HP/Quantum/.. but i've not used a multi-drive tape loader 
&gt; with amanda before, so YMMV...

Hmmm... For various reasons, I'd really like to make sure this works
before reccommending that they purchase it. One reason is the cost, but
another is the size -- I don't want to transport it if it's not usable.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What does "differenctial" in "Ultra-Wide differential SCSI" mean?
&gt; 
&gt; differential scsi uses two cables instead of one.
&gt; its similar to the concept of extra cabling for redundancy, 
&gt; but electrically its more complex, using +X volts on channel 
&gt; A and -X volts on channel B. comparitors checking the signals 
&gt; are the same absolute value... or think of it like parity. 
&gt; differential scsi also allows much longer cables. its also 
&gt; plenty more expensive!

OK... That makes sense... (though I did read that it's actually still
one cable, but instead of +V and 0 (ground), they use +V and -V...)

However, where do I get a controller for this from? I've done some
searching, and have found that it's a bad idea to connect differential
and non-differential devices together, as at least one device will lose
its magic blue smoke and cease to perform its intended function. I would
assume it's the same as "Ultra-Wide SCSI", but I don't want to take that
chance.

Cheers
