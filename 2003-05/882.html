&gt; I need work, im 17 well skilled in IT (check resume) and 
&gt; ready too learn more. Ive been offered several trainiships so 
&gt; far, but as always there is no training just cheap labour.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone reccomend any IT job agencies around?
&gt;

Well, apart from the abuse you've copped (which, while accurate, is
somewhat harsh for a 17 year old -- perhaps some of us could remember
what it was like all those years back, and take it a little easy), there
has been some decent advice, which I shall repeat, and hopefully add to.

Employers take people on based on risk and reward. At 17, you're at the
high end of the risk side, and the low end of the reward side. Your
skills (which I couldn't check, due to the broken link) are largely
untested, you are (assumedly) inexperienced in the art of being an
employee, and generally are a relatively unknown quantity. Unless you
have done something truly spectacular and out of the ordinary, you're
pretty much just another 17 year old with potential. You may be bright,
you may be driven, but you're a risk.

For these reasons, Job Agencies are not going to get you anywhere --
they thrive on being able to give some certainty to their clients
(employers). Likewise, cold canvassing of potential employers won't help
you much (what have you got that would convince them otherwise?). Your
best bet is either further training (Adelaide TAFE have some great
courses, including some that are Linux-based), or something like a
traineeship. No matter what, unless you already have had a decent job,
you're not going to get one that isn't fairly entry-level. If you're
lucky, it will have training in it, if not, take the job itself as your
training. You don't stop learning once you start a job.

Another thing to remember is that the IT job market is at the end of a
slump (hopefully). What this means is that there are a large number of
skilled and talented people out there who are un- or under-employed
(there's a number of them on this list). There's also a lot of recent
TAFE and University Graduates in IT who are in similar situations. When
you compare yourself with these people, from an employers' perspective,
you should realise that you're not going to get everything you ever
wanted in your first job. Being offered a few traineeships sounds like a
pretty good situation to be in for a 17 year old. Take one of the
opportunities you've been given, and run with it. Work hard, learn hard,
make yourself more employable for your next job. That's what
traineeships are all about.
