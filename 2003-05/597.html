<H1>multiple KDE monitors experience?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Does anyone have any recent experience of using 2 or more monitors
attached to one linux box using KDE and a single mouse and keyboard?

I remember that when the X window system was first getting popular
in the late 1980s, there was X server software which would allow you
to move your mouse to the side of the screen and you would
then find yourself on a monochrome X screen :0.1 or :1.0 or something,
instead of the usual :0.0. So one monitor emulated two monitors.
This was in SunOS 4, I think.
But the literature indicated that the purpose of the :X.Y screen notation
was to permit multiple monitors to connect to one computer.

Given that nowadays we use multiple simulated desktops in KDE and Gnome
and click with a mouse or control-Fn to shift between desktops, it
occurred to me that with the decreasing prices of CRT screens, we should
all be able to afford to keep our old monitors and line them up
in a row on the physical desktop - as a sort of history of the evolution
of monitors - and stick one graphics card in the PC for each monitor.

I'm surprised I've never heard anyone mention this sort of thing. Is that
because there's some "show stopper" or because no one's thought of it,
or because I just don't move in the right circles?
I feel an ascii diagram coming on...


	monitor 1	monitor 2	monitor 2
	      \		    |            /
	       \	    |		/
	        \	    |	       /
		 \	    |	      /
		  \	    |	     /
		   \        |	    /

			linux box

			  /   \
			 /     \
			/	\
		    mouse     keyboard

(I bet someone's written software to generate ascii diagrams...)
Then the idea would be to set up the software so that the mouse moves off
monitor 1 to monitor 2 when you go off the right edge, and the
keyboard input follows the mouse cursor.

Does anyone actually have any experience of doing this?
If so, was it easy to do? I can imagine that the XF86Config file would
be the place to make it happen. But would KDE let it happen?
I don't want to start trying to do this unless someone has succeeded already.
My purpose is to reduce the amount of time I spend tediously clicking
between my 16 KDE software desktops. I bet it would be great for
network management centres too. You could have a bank of 9 monitors,
3 wide and 3 high, monitoring everything that's fit to monitor.
Of course you might want a larger mouse pad then.

Cheers in advance,
Alan Kennington.
