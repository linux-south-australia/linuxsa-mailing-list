Just realized that my PC time was wrong, so I am sending this again.

My apology for sending the same message twice.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have a strange situation here with apache-2.0.43; I am starting to 
&gt; get the 403 Forbidden error, when I try to access my page.
&gt;
&gt; My server was running apache-2.043/tomcat4.1.18, and was working fine. 
&gt; Server also had mod_ssl, and was working fine with apache.  Recently I 
&gt; tried to use mod_ssl with tomcat applications as well.  After some 
&gt; modifications, tomcat application started to work with apache and ssl, 
&gt; but only with that; not without SSL.
&gt;
&gt; While I was tampering with httpd.conf, ssl.conf and mod_jk.conf files, 
&gt; things got worst. I now have the following problems.
&gt;
&gt; (1) I only managed to ssh that server as root (I have been doing this 
&gt; remotely) . If I ssh as normal user, connection closes, and "ssh -v 
&gt; myserver" shows the followings:
&gt;
&gt; debug1: ssh-userauth2 successful: method password
&gt; debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]
&gt; debug1: send channel open 0
&gt; debug1: Entering interactive session.
&gt; debug1: ssh_session2_setup: id 0
&gt; debug1: channel request 0: pty-req
&gt; debug1: Requesting X11 forwarding with authentication spoofing.
&gt; debug1: channel request 0: x11-req
&gt; debug1: channel request 0: shell
&gt; debug1: fd 3 setting TCP_NODELAY
&gt; debug1: channel 0: open confirm rwindow 0 rmax 32768
&gt; debug1: channel_free: channel 0: client-session, nchannels 1
&gt; Connection to myhost closed by remote host.
&gt; Connection to myhost closed.
&gt; debug1: Transferred: stdin 0, stdout 0, stderr 103 bytes in 0.3 seconds
&gt; debug1: Bytes per second: stdin 0.0, stdout 0.0, stderr 359.4
&gt; debug1: Exit status -1
&gt;
&gt; (2) When I try to access my webpage, I get:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Forbidden
&gt;
&gt; You don't have permission to access / on this server.
&gt;
&gt; Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to 
&gt; use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
&gt;
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Apache/2.0.43 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.0.46 OpenSSL/0.9.6e Server at myhost 
&gt; Port 80
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As far as I know, httpd.conf file has gone back to its original state 
&gt; (I also tried new compilation of apache-2.0.46 with the same result), 
&gt; and permission of all directories are normal. So, I suspect, I should 
&gt; have messed with some other configuration file to deny the said access 
&gt; (since ssh is also behaving differenly).
&gt;
&gt; I appreciate, should any one on the list provides me some pointer on 
&gt; this.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Damar
&gt;
