Is there any company out there still putting cable up on light poles?
After much complaining to Telstra and getting the result I knew I would
get. I am really quite dismayed at the whole broadband saga.

I live in an old suburb 5k's from the city and have a rim installed on
my exchange. They absolutely have no intention of changing it...

They stopped running cable two poles from my house, even though the
steel carry cable is in place. sigh...

So is there a company willing to put this stuff up for two poles?

Next solution is wireless to my mates house exactly 970m from my place
and attach to his cable/DSL connection. He does not have it yet, but
both are available to him. (it's an injustice :-))

Come to think of it does anyone know of a court case brought against
someone who linked to a friends place? It's ironic that in the USA its
perfectly legal to connect to a friends place.

Maybe we will get broadband through power lines one day and get some
real competition for BB
