It's an odd one all right.

I think, when all the smoke and mirrors is stripped away, that SCO's
complaint is about IBM's withdrawal from Project Monterey.

   Project Monterey had the immediate goal of porting SCO UNIX to IA-64
   and the longer term goal of adding enterprise features which existed
   in AIX to SCO UNIX.  There would be application portability between
   AIX and SCO UNIX.

   The Project progressed slowly.  Timelines slipped.  Deliverables
   slipped, leaving the core project of porting SCO UNIX to IA-64.  It
   has to be asked what IBM got from its participation at this point.

   Linux meanwhile was doing an unrelated IA-64 port, which was somewhat
   simpler than Project Monterey as Linux was already 64-bit (thanks to
   the Alpha port).

   As time passes, Linux is taking market share from SCO UNIX.  Linux,
   not SCO, is now the first choice for people looking for a POSIX-compliant
   OS for PC platforms.

   Each month that Intel can't ship IA-64 in economic quantity, the
   less relevance Project Monterey has.

   IBM canned Monterey.  IBM got the Linux religion. AIX 5L got a Linux
   ABI, not a SCO UNIX ABI.

   SCO hasn't got a 64-bit UNIX.  That is, it has no product for the
   impending generation of CPUs (slowly impending, but impending all
   the same).

Now SCO might have a valid contractural bitch here.  It depends upon
the terms of the joint venture.  Who knows?

But where exactly in this process Linux and Linux users get dragged
into a joint venture contract dispute is beyond me.  The Novell and
Open Group letters point out that SCO don't own any intellectual
property that's remotely relevant to Linux development.

At best SCO could show the Project Monterey developed some IA-64
technologies that were also simultaneously developed Linux's IA-64
port.  If these technologies were patented that could be a problem.
But SCO's patent holdings are small.  And a code inspection could well
show prior art or worse.

My suspicion is that the claims were simply a strategy to increase the
pain on IBM: "if IBM chose Linux over Project Monterey then let's
queer that decision".

I also suspect that the whole thing has gotten much bigger than SCO
expected and that IBM, The Open Group, and Novell have called SCO's
bluff.

Bruce Perens claims that the license buy is simply an easy way for
MS to contribute to SCOs litigation.  If so, I wonder how happy
Microsoft will be after learning that 95% of the license fee they
paid to SCO goes to Novell :-)
