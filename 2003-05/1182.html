Richard,

Have you though of using Libranet? I think it may have what you want. It
is Debian based but is more up to date. (v2.8 has PHP 4.1.2-6) The
latest version is not free however you can download an earlier version
to try out if you desire.

Cheers,
Anthony

&gt; &gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As someone who works regularly with both FreeBSD and Debian 
&gt; &gt; systems, I'm
&gt; &gt; curious: would you mind highlighting the main problems you 
&gt; &gt; are finding with Debian?  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it in large part the problem of the slow Debian stable 
&gt; &gt; branch release cycle?
&gt; 
&gt; Primarily, yes.
&gt; 
&gt; I originally adopted Debian because I thought that it would enable me to
&gt; keep up to date with recent software, but would remain more stable than
&gt; RedHat (and I don't like RadHat for a variety of reasons). Evidently,
&gt; this isn't the focus of Debian, and it seems that FreeBSD (and possibly
&gt; gentoo) might be able to give me similar stability, but more up-to-date
&gt; packages.
&gt; 
&gt; It's really frustrating to go 'apt-get php4', and then try some php
&gt; thing, only to find that it requires php 4.3.0 or later (which was
&gt; released in Feb of this year), and I only have 4.1.2 (which was released
&gt; about Feb of last year). It certainly means that if I ever have a
&gt; problem with a certain version of a program, I can't really go to the
&gt; developers, because they tell me to use the most recent version. I also
&gt; find that it's not entirely trivial to work out which known
&gt; vulnerabilities I am still open to, and which have been fixed, because
&gt; while I have apache 1.3.26, it's had numerous security patches
&gt; backported to it, though I'm not entirely sure which ones.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, I understand the reasons why debian's process is as it is -- I
&gt; waited quite some time for Debian 3.0 to come out, and was quite happy
&gt; with what I found at the time, but now, it feels restrictively ancient.
&gt; I'm not criticising debian per se, I'm just deciding it's not suited to
&gt; my needs.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm also aware that I can download src-debs, and compile my own debs,
&gt; even updating them myself. However, I don't want to do this for a few
&gt; reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, Debian isn't exactly designed to make this easy. It's not that
&gt; it's impossible, or even incredibly complex, but I can certainly say
&gt; (from experience) that it's a more invovled process than I really want.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, avoiding getting heavily involved in individually upgrading
&gt; packages was one of my (misguided) reasons for choosing debian in the
&gt; first place.
&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, there are other OS's (FreeBSD and gentoo in particular) which
&gt; appear designed for this very purpose, yet may well share Debian's
&gt; reliability and stability.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The other problem that I have found is perhaps more an irritation than a
&gt; real problem, and it could just be something that could be tuned out, or
&gt; it could be unavoidable in any OS... Performance seems pretty average. I
&gt; have a software RAID1 with ext3, and I find that a lot of CPU time is
&gt; spent on doing journalling and raiding... I certainly notice a complete
&gt; lack of responsiveness when I'm doing anything with the filesystem. The
&gt; machine is a 700MHz Celeron with 512 Mb RAM, so it's not exactly slow...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, I am sick of the SysV init scripts, and while I don't go much
&gt; on ye olde BSD style scripts, I think I like the new ones in FreeBSD 5.0
&gt; -- they work out their own dependencies and all...
&gt;
