&gt; i'm refering to the smbfs.o module. the exact problem i'm having is that i

This is probably true.

&gt; the output of an 'lsmod' confirms this, claiming
&gt; that the smbfs module is in use by 1 process.

This is false.  lsmod shows reference counts of instances, not processes.
If you had two mounted shared and 4000 processes with open files, you would
most likely see a count of 2 (or 3 - I think sometimes a reference is
incremented by one just to keep it resident.  For example, my SCSI controller
shows a link count of 3, but only 2 mounted filesystems off that controller).

&gt; Other then a reboot, i cant
&gt; work out how to unmount this connection.

rmmod is *not* what you want to do.  You want to find out what process is
currently residing on that file system, kill the processes, and then you
will be able to unmount the file system.

"fuser -m /mount_point_name" should show you the process ids with files
open to that mount point.  Once that list drops to zero, then you will
be able to unmount the file system.
