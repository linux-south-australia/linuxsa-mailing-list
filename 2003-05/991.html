On this one the driver is HP LaserJet 6P/6MP -Postscript
In the Properties box of this driver I have Graphics resolution 600dpi and
under the Postscript tab select Encapsulated Postcript (EPS). From memory
most of the other settings were default

Getting the (EPS) tab correct was important for a successful setup.
There was also an issue with the spacing of numbers and letters when typing
in
Fax-Nr:xxxxx. It has been a while since I have used Sambafax.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I have a nicely working samba/cups print server working and have sambafax
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.purpel3.com/sambafax/">http://www.purpel3.com/sambafax/</A> installed and working to a certain
extent.
&gt;
&gt; The problem i have is that no matter what post script driver I use on the
&gt; windows end, the ps2ascii line in the sambafax cups backend scripts seems
&gt; to not be able to change back to the original readable text and thus fails
&gt; parse the Fax-Nr: xxxxxxx line.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have a working sambafax server and know what driver I should
be
&gt; using and if this sambafax is as good as it seems?  or is there something
&gt; better than this?
&gt;
&gt; are there any other options for a fax backend for CUPS?  i've managed to
&gt; get Cypheus or WHFC working on a different test machine, but don't want to
&gt; install this client software on every machine that wants to fax, not to
&gt; mention try to explain to each user how to use it.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks and regards
&gt; Matthew
