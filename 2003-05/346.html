&gt;&gt;I edited /etc/services, installed proftp from source, changed the
&gt;&gt;configuration file in /etc/pure-ftp. Walked on hot coals and jumped
&gt;&gt;through burning hoops.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;How complicated can it be to get ftp to listen on the port I want it to?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;not very!
&gt;I'm using proftp too (debian woody), so I edited /etc/proftp.conf,
&gt;changed "Port 21" to "Port 3670".
&gt;Edited /etc/inetd.conf (since for me proftp is started by inetd)
&gt;and copied the "ftp" line calling the service "myftp" instead, ie:
&gt;
Dave thanks for helping out. :-)

I am temporarily clueless and frustrated, so, ug!   :-P  Where is the 
[1]GUI? I can't tell if its running. Well I can, but I need to complain 
about something. :-D


I've got a few probs that I have to work out. I compiled from source, 
because the RPM's have a dependency.
The program is compiled in my home directory. ./install doesn't put all 
the parts in the right places (in fact does not run), but I copied 
proftpd to /usr/sbin/.

Basically, I need to figure out how to add a service in SuSE.

In suse 8.2 it has both /etc/inet.d and /etc/xinet.d, but inet.d is 
completely commented out. xinit.d just says, use the shell scripts in 
init.d. I put a shell script in there, but it says I don't know what a 
'myftp' is, even though you edited /etc/services. (so :-P )

I went into the yast control center to add network services, and at 
first it says inet.d is not used and is disabled, but I can undisable 
it, if I feel lucky.
Inet.d is not used by default. The runlevel editor doesn't let you add 
anything.


I'll get back to this.

I have to eat.

[1] I wish they had a window manager called the "molassas window 
manager" you wouldn't use a keyboard to type, just the mouse to click on 
a slow, bloated GUI on emulated keyboard on screen.  Actually I don't, 
but its funny to think about, and I need a good laugh right now.


&gt;
&gt;myftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/proftpd
&gt;
&gt;edited /etc/services, and added:
&gt;
&gt;myftp           3670/tcp
&gt;
&gt;then restarted inetd, proftp is now listening on the port:
&gt;
&gt;# netstat -a |grep ftp
&gt;tcp        0      0 *:ftp                   *:*                     LISTEN
&gt;tcp        0      0 *:myftp                 *:*                     LISTEN
&gt;#
&gt;
&gt;(PS. surely you mean "Ricoh" not "Richoe"?)
&gt;
