Jason (who used HTML email, hence why my reply is at the top),

Depends if you like nipples or pads for mousing. I like nipples, so my
choices are pretty much limited to Toshiba or IBM. Dell used to have a
few nipple models, but doesn't seem to any more.

Second thing it depends on is how much travelling you do, or intend to
do, and what you expect from your warranty. Personally, I limit my
choices to the tier one brands of laptop (Toshiba, IBM, Dell, HP/Compaq,
Fujitsu, Apple and Sony, and perhaps a few others) for this reason
alone, even though I don't do a lot of travelling. Laptops are less
servicable than PCs (you can't just swap one video card for another),
and hence I think it's worth paying more for a company that will fix
your laptop. That said, if you run Linux, they won't care about software
problems.

Third thing is what you want to do with it -- does it need to be highly
portable, or a desktop replacement. You'd be surprised how heavy even
2.4kg can get. Likewise, you'd be surprised how much slower some laptop
components are.

After that, it comes down to price and features, and how well it suits
you -- try playing with it, see if it fits.

As far as local places to get them from go, I got mine from GBM on Glen
Osmond Road. They have been reasonably good, though a bit slow on fixing
things.

Subject: Laptop


hello,

I am currently in the market to purchase a new laptop before the end of
the financial year. My budget is @$4000.

Does anyone have any suggested retailers/resellers here in adelaide that
are helpful ?

Is there a particular model/brand people have had problems with that I
should stay away from ?

regards
jason
