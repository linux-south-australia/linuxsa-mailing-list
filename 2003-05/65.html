Well here's my response :-)
I reckon the democrats know as much about OSS as my mom ;-)
What is happening is that there is growing press coverage and just too much 
to ignore.
Polies just jump on the band wagon, but when u are a minor party you jump 
on first :-)
Pressure will make all of them take OSS on board, none of them will really 
understand it, or believe in it. They will just get mileage out of it :-)

&gt; David,
&gt;
&gt; Please don't be offended by my post, I was aiming it at the list in 
&gt; general (note that I sent it to the list, not you), your post just 
&gt; provided a nice spring-board for my rant. :)
&gt;
&gt; I'm just suprised by what I'm perceiving to be a fair degree of apathy 
&gt; towards this issue from the list. I would have expected that such 
&gt; proposed legislation would garner a lot of support from us, considering 
&gt; we all know and love Linux. The original post has seen twelve replies. 
&gt; Debates about HTML in email have seen more posts easily by order of 
&gt; magnitude or two. It is quite bizzare.

&gt;&gt; b) I didn't say I didn't think it was a good idea
&gt;&gt; c) I didn't even say anything unconstructive
&gt;
&gt; True, but your post didn't seem overly positive. :) Then again, neither 
&gt; did mine.
&gt;
&gt; Come on people, show some support!
