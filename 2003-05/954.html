Make sense.  Thanks.


&gt; &gt;  [symbol omitted] NuDizT.jpg
&gt; &gt; JPEG File Interchange
&gt;
&gt; It's difficult to say what that is.

"That" is a widget with the title "NuDizT.jpg" and the description "JPEG 
file interchange" beneath.
When I click on the widget a 


&gt;
&gt; &gt; I can save that image to disk, or view it immediately at my choice,
&gt; &gt; without any problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  In addition, I needed a "name", defaulting to
&gt; &gt;&gt;   "unnamed".  I have no idea what that's intended to be.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's asking you to make your own choice of name.
&gt;
&gt; Of course I understand that.  But why should I choose a name?  For
&gt; what?  Doesn't it know I'm running UNIX and already have defined
&gt; every name that I need.

I think I understand where you are, now.  Kmail allows you to separate 
ISPs (or other mail sources).  So you are invited to choose a name for 
the group of messages you just imported.

&gt; The whole concept of UNIX is cooperation: MUAs read and write mail.
&gt; MTAs transfer it from one place to another.  Shells and logins define
&gt; the user.

OK.


&gt; MUAs shouldn't make assumptions about how people work, nor how
&gt; important they consider their data.

Maybe not - but offering an app that works in a way that many people 
might like isn't wrong IMHO.  Nobody is _forced_ to use it (except to 
research a presentation, perhaps :-) )

&gt;  I can't sort by size.  

Yes you can - I just did it!

&gt; To change from
&gt; threaded to non-threaded displays (a thing I do several times a day)
&gt; appears to require reconfiguration. 

Yes it does.  This has the effect that sorting by (eg) size has some 
strange-looking results when threading is turned on. So mutt would be 
superior in that regard.

&gt; All there is is this help facility.  It doesn't appear to be very
&gt; good: I can't find any mention of threads in it, for example

That help isn't the best thing I've every seen, either :-)
Threading IS mentioned in the chat about Layout, but finding it when 
that was all you were looking for would NOT be easy.

&gt; While searching the help files, I *did* find a chapter (7) on
&gt; importing data from other MUAs, all of them apparently from the
&gt; Microsoft space.  But the idea of importing and exporting data is the
&gt; Microsoft way, not the UNIX way.

Yes.  The authors generally appear to address a person switching from 
Windoze to Linux or FBSD.  The operation of KMail appears to me to be 
desugned the same way.  As I DID come from Wondoze to Linux, then FBSD, 
KMail's operation seems much better to me than it would to you.

&gt; &gt; [Kmail]  Works just fine for me.
&gt;
&gt; It appears that it doesn't.  That's how we started this discussion.

Touche  :-)

I still wonder why one person can send me a jpg file attach and I can 
handle it with ease (the M$ way - sorry!  :-)  ) wheras stuff from 
lca2004 digest comes as MIME text.
That doesn't sound like Kmail is entirely the culprit.
