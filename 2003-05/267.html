Well, not that you want to know about this, but after ripping out the
2.4.18 kernel and putting in a nice fresh 2.4.20 kernel, and then
adding the latest ALSA 0.9.3 software fresh off the net, lo and behold,
the S/P DIF optical digital sound input which took me 3 years to get
working just completely stopped. There were all kinds of messages in the
system log file, which I got rid of by fixing the /etc/modules.conf file
and updating the ALSA utils etc. etc. etc.

But still absolutely not a peep out of the speakers. So I was just about
to get some cash out of the ATM to go down to the local gunshop to buy
something to end my worries - after the mandatory 6 months cooling
off period or whatever - when I realised that I had plugged the speakers into
a different computer very late last night (like 6am).
Having 5 computers on and under one desk does make things a bit confusing.
But I blame linux for this. If it had been a Mac or MS, it would have come up
with a message saying "Are you sure you plugged the speakers into the
right computer?" Linux users are somehow just presumed to be too intelligent 
to make a mistake like that. So that was a close call for sure. Now I'm just 
so glad I don't live in the USA...

Time for me to go and count my chickens, I think.
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
