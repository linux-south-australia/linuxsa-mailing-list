 &gt; They (eecis.udel) used to list a tictoc.csiro NTP server - and so did I

 &gt; Therefore it seems like you can't really go by what you read in
 &gt; these lists much.

You can, but you just need to stay up-to-date.

The NTP protocol has a bit in it which allows an NTP server to tell an
NTP client to back off and go away;  However, a prominent vendor of
ADSL devices (with a name consisting of a letter followed by a four-letter
word) decided to (a) ignore that bit of the protocol, and (b) hard-wire
the IP addresses of CSIRO's NTP servers.

Several hundred thousand ADSL modems later, CSIRO discontinued the 
service to the public due to the massively unsustainable load on their
upstream network links.

 &gt; Have I got the right ideas on this, or is there a more modern way to do it?

Google is your friend. :-)

(hint:  Running ntpd is a good start;  Parenting it up with a public 
time server which isn't necessarily stratum-1 or stratum-2 is also 
a good idea.  The difference in accuracy between (say) stratum-1 and
(say) stratum-5 is small enough that no real human will ever give a 
shit, but for some reason people think their clock will be inaccurate
if they don't sync up with a stratum-1)

The other thing you can do is buy a supported GPS receiver and get
your own time sync from that.

ntp.internode.on.net is available to Internode customers as well.  Most
other ISPs run some kind of time service for their customers.

ntpdate is probably one of the highest-overhead least-accurate ways of
syncing your clock, and one of the least accurate ways too.  But in
practical terms it really makes very little difference because no
carbon-based life forms in this universe give a damn about a few 
thousandths of a second one way or the other.

 &gt; It's difficult to keep up with the times these days...
