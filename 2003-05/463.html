&gt; Hi Kim, all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; What does "differenctial" in "Ultra-Wide differential SCSI" mean?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; differential scsi uses two cables instead of one.
&gt; &gt; its similar to the concept of extra cabling for redundancy, 
&gt; &gt; but electrically its more complex, using +X volts on channel 
&gt; &gt; A and -X volts on channel B. comparitors checking the signals 
&gt; &gt; are the same absolute value... or think of it like parity. 
&gt; &gt; differential scsi also allows much longer cables. its also 
&gt; &gt; plenty more expensive!
&gt; 
&gt; OK... That makes sense... (though I did read that it's actually still
&gt; one cable, but instead of +V and 0 (ground), they use +V and -V...)

Yes, it's one cable. The conductors which are normally ground become
the -V signals, and each pair of +V/-V conductors is a twisted pair.
This makes for some funky-looking ribbon cables with parallel twisted
pairs that flatten out into ordinary ribbon every now and then to
allow IDC connectors to be attached.

The main advantages, electrically, are: the twisted pair preserves the
signal integrity better - it sort of works like a coax cable; and any
electrical noise will induce a voltage of the same polarity in each
conductor of the pair, so when the receiving device subtracts the
voltages on the conductors one from the other, it cancels out the noise.

&gt; However, where do I get a controller for this from? I've done some
&gt; searching, and have found that it's a bad idea to connect differential
&gt; and non-differential devices together, as at least one device will lose
&gt; its magic blue smoke and cease to perform its intended function. I would
&gt; assume it's the same as "Ultra-Wide SCSI", but I don't want to take that
&gt; chance.

Ultra-Wide SCSI is the "next step down" from ultra-wide differential
SCSI. The system this is being typed on has differential and ordinary
SCSI devices on the same bus; it works OK, no smoke, the differential
devices just operate in single-ended mode.

I think the Adaptec 2940-U2W (not the plain UW) does LVD and is
reasonably plentiful/cheap secondhand. Buying new - seems most new
cards do it apart from the cheapies. You do, unfortunately, pay quite
a bit for it. I'd advise the second-hand option.

How to tell LVD from HVD: I think you have to look at the docs on the
device. HVD seems pretty rare though.
