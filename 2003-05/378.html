&gt; I suppose it's really about setting fences to jump.  This
&gt; seems reasonably successful in other areas of the kernel.
&gt; For example, you could easily modify TCP to be non-fair,
&gt; giving yourself a 10%-odd performance boost but if too
&gt; many people do it there will be congestion collapse of the
&gt; Internet.

I guess I see it as a delaying tatic which only works when the
userbase is fairly small. It only takes one person to write a little
tool to tweak the binary module and then everyone else can do the same
thing with little skill required.

My main concern is that witholding the source code comes at a cost. Eg:

- now impossible for the average developer to debug
- compatibility issues between kernel versions
  - even with a shim you need to recompile it, often separately 
    outside of the standard source tree
  - gets a lot harder if you're running development kernels
  - next to impossible if you're not running on x86 hardware
    and they don't produce a binary for your architecture

Is this price worth the benefit you get for making it a harder (and
possibly only for a small period of time) for users to use the cards
in ways you don't want them too?

&gt; Of course, changing the firmware downloaded to the chipset
&gt; could still allow people to alter the frequency assignments.
&gt; That's just a very tall fence to climb :-)

It is, but if its a popular tweak, I don't think its going to be a
tall enough fence - for example look at the number of firmware
"upgrades" you can get for pc dvd players to allow multi-region play.

&gt; In the meantime, holding the assignments in a binary module
&gt; with some checksum verification sets a reasonably tall fence
&gt; with the advantage that most people that are capacble of hacking
&gt; with the assignments know better than to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; I really can't see much of another way forward with the
&gt; current Intel and Broadcom chipsets and the national
&gt; regulators' concerns.

They could work on the other side, where if someone is found to be
causing problems because they're using frequencies they shouldn't then
to prosecute them (ok, this is probably pretty expensive to do).

Regards,

Chris
