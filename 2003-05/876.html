Hey,

You sounded in dire straights, so I thought I'd have a google for you (I don't 
have any actual experience with one of these cards, sorry). I'm assuming the 
chipset your using is a VIA chipset, and I found this on VIA's site:

<A HREF="http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID">http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID</A>=87

Though the help seems to be nothing that you don't already know. Have you 
tried using just the generic VESA driver in 16-bit mode at say 1024x768 
resolution?

Sorry I couldn't be more help, good luck anyway.

Damien

&gt; Dear All,
&gt;
&gt; We are experiencing difficulties getting a S3 ProSavage DDR video
&gt; chipset to work with X. The S3 ProSavage is an integrated VGA chipset on
&gt; the MSI KM2M MS-6738 Ver 1.0 mainboard. The adapter works fine in
&gt; 640x480 24bit resolution, however when increased to 800x600 or 1024x768
&gt; the monitor reports Out of Range, frequency of 26Hz.
&gt;
&gt; So far we have tried:
&gt;
&gt;  - Downloading and compiling XF86 from source with new driver from
&gt; maintainers site (<A HREF="http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html">http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html</A>).
&gt;  - Changing the motherboard
&gt;  - Changing the monitor
&gt;  - Upgraind the bios to the latest v1.3 from MSI website
&gt;  - Attempted installing new versions of linux ie Redhat 9.0 or Konppix
&gt; both get Out of Range error on installation (Konppix works in 640x480).
&gt;
&gt; The application we are using the computer for is to boot an LTSP
&gt; terminal. The motherbaord is installed into an AOPEN mini-ATX case where
&gt; installing an alternative Video Card is not an option. There appears to
&gt; be very little reference to the ProSavage DDR chipset on the Internet in
&gt; relation to Linux, however any documentation that does exist seems to
&gt; indicate that it is a fully supported chipset.
&gt;
&gt; We have also tried to hardcode the X modelines to support 1024x768,
&gt; however the driver appears to ignore our modelines and do its own thing.
&gt;
&gt; Changing the motherboard or video card is a very difficult option given
&gt; we have already purchased 25 units and have fully installed and disposed
&gt; of all packaging, as research was done prior to purchasing the equipment
&gt; that indicated all hardware was supported.
&gt;
&gt; Any help greatly appreciated, happy to offer financial compensation for
&gt; somebody who is able to get it working, sorry no $$$ for trying !!!
&gt;
&gt; Time is of the essence, as these 25 units are due to be shipped this
&gt; coming Tuesday !!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;   Mike O'C
