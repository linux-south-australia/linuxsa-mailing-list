&gt; Is it ok to have the CDrom as Secondary Master and hdd1 (40GB Seagate) as 
&gt; Secondary Slave ?

Is this because having the CD-ROM as primary slave doesn't work?

&gt; The reason I ask is because I cannot mount hdd1 yet. I am getting error 
&gt; messages about an ide-disk driver not present and Reiserfsck failing when the 
&gt; system boots. Yet when booting into rescue and running reiserfsck it on this 
&gt; drive it completes without any problems.

Is the rescue kernel identical with the normal boot kernel?

Here's some possibly relevant stuff from the kernel docs (2.4.20,
dunno what kernel you've got but this stuff isn't new)

  Use old disk-only driver on primary interface
    CONFIG BLK DEV HD IDE
  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE disks.  Most people use just
  the new enhanced driver by itself.  This option however installs the
  old hard disk driver to control the primary IDE/disk interface in
  the system, leaving the new enhanced IDE driver to take care of only
  the 2nd/3rd/4th IDE interfaces.  Doing this will prevent you from
  having an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM or tape drive connected to the primary
  IDE interface.  Choosing this option may be useful for older systems
  which have MFM/RLL/ESDI controller+drives at the primary port
  address (0x1f0), along with IDE drives at the secondary/3rd/4th port
  addresses.

  Normally, just say N here; you will then use the new driver for all
  4 interfaces.

  Include IDE/ATA-2 DISK support
    CONFIG BLK DEV IDEDISK
  This will include enhanced support for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks.  If
  you have a MFM/RLL/IDE disk, and there is no special reason to use
  the old hard disk driver instead, say Y.  If you have an SCSI-only
  system, you can say N here.

  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read &lt;<A HREF="file:Documentation/modules.txt&gt">file:Documentation/modules.txt&gt</A>;.  The module
  will be called ide-disk.o.  Do not compile this driver as a module
  if your root file system (the one containing the directory /) is
  located on the IDE disk. If unsure, say Y.

My guess is your normal kernel has CONFIG BLK DEV HD IDE set and does
not have CONFIG BLK DEV IDEDISK set, whereas your rescue kernel does
have CONFIG BLK DEV IDEDISK set. This suggests that you need to
recompile your kernel if you want to use more than one hard disk.
