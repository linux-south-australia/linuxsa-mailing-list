These seem to be becoming cheap.  I got one with my new PC.

Not sure about all aspects of this procedure, it still seems
too hard even with the new hotplug/devlabel system.


                    CONFIGURING A USB MEMORY DISK
                          (Red Hat Linux 9)

USB memory keys look like car keys but contain flash memory chips and
a USB interface.  They appear to the operating system as a disk drive.
They'll probably replace floppy disks, now that most files are bigger
than 1.44MB.

USB memory keys use SCSI commands over a USB bus, and so appear to
Linux as SCSI drives.  Unlike most hard drives, they are often removed
whilst the system is running.


PARTITION AND FORMAT

A lot of memory keys come pre-formatted.  If so, skip this bit.

Insert the disk.  Look at /var/log/messages

  Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi1, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
  SCSI device sda: 125952 512-byte hdwr sectors (64 MB)
  sda: Write Protect is off
  sda:

From the messages, see that our USB disk appears as the SCSI drive
/dev/sda.

Partition the disk (one big primary MS-DOS partition)

  # parted /dev/sda
      mklabel msdos
      print

        Disk geometry for /dev/sda: 0.000-61.500 megabytes
        Disk label type: msdos
        Minor    Start       End     Type      Filesystem  Flags

      mkpart primary fat16 0.000 61.500
      set 1 boot on

The 61.500 in the mkpart command comes from the output of the print
command.

Format the disk.  We use a MS-DOS filesystem, since USB memory disks
are mainly for transferring files and MS-DOS is the most interoperable
filesystem (FreeBSD; Linux; Mac and, no surprise here, Windows).

  # mkfs -t vfat -F 16 -n usbdisk1 -v /dev/sda1

    mkfs.vfat 2.8 (28 Feb 2001)
    /dev/sda1 has 4 heads and 32 sectors per track,
    logical sector size is 512,
    using 0xf8 media descriptor, with 125920 sectors;
    file system has 2 16-bit FATs and 4 sectors per cluster.
    FAT size is 123 sectors, and provides 31410 clusters.
    Root directory contains 512 slots.
    Volume ID is 3ec97615, volume label usbdisk1   .


ADD THE DISK TO DEVLABEL

devlabel attempts to give the same device name to removable media,
wherever they appear on the bus.  We want our memory disk to always
appear as /dev/usbdisk1 no matter what USB bus it is on or what other
USB disk might be present.


  # devlabel printid -d /dev/sda1

    S80:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

  # devlabel add -s /dev/usbdisk1 --partnum 1 -u 'S80:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'

    Created symlink /dev/usbdisk1 -> /dev/sda1
    Added /dev/usbdisk1 to /etc/sysconfig/devlabel


ADD THE DISK TO FILESYSTEM LIST

Edit /etc/fstab, adding

  /dev/usbdisk1 /mnt/usbdisk1 vfat noatime,nodev,noexec,nosuid,user,umask=077,fmask=177,dmask=077 0 0

The noatime stops writing access times.  Flash memory has a large but
limited number of writes and we don't want to use those maintaining
file access times.

The remaining parameters allow mere mortals to mount the disk and do
their best to stop them shooting themselves in the foot.


TEST

Insert the memory key

Look in /var/log/messages or use dmesg

  hub.c: new USB device 00:01.0-1, assigned address 2
  usb.c: USB device 2 (vend/prod 0x123/0x12) is not claimed by any active driver.
  Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
  usb.c: registered new driver usb-storage
  scsi1 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
    Vendor: XXXXX     Model: XXXXXXXXXXXX      Rev: /W1.
    Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  WARNING: USB Mass Storage data integrity not assured
  USB Mass Storage device found at 2
  USB Mass Storage support registered.
  Attached scsi removable disk sda at scsi1, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
  SCSI device sda: 125952 512-byte hdwr sectors (64 MB)
  sda: Write Protect is off
   sda: sda1

Mount the disk (an ordinary user can do this)

  $ mount /mnt/usbdisk1

Remember to unmount it.


AUTOMOUNTER

If you want the disk to automount add an entry to /etc/auto.misc

  usbdisk1 -fstype=vfat,noatime,nodev,noexec,nosuid :/dev/usbdisk1

  # /sbin/service autofs restart

Test with

  ls /misc/usbdisk1

Because of ownership of files on the disk, automounting isn't as nice
as explicit mounting.  If you're the only user of the machine you
could hardcode these (using your numeric UID and GID)

  usbdisk1 -fstype=vfat,noatime,nodev,noexec,nosuid,user,uid=500,gid=500,umask=077,fmask=177,dmask=077 :/dev/usbdisk1

Although that also sucks (it would be nice if there was some way we
could get the UID and GID of the console user into the command line).


GNOME AND KDE

Both have mount tools which sit on a toolbar.

For RHL9 with GNOME, go to bottom toolbar, right mouse click, select
Add to panel|Utility|Disk mounter.  Right-click on new disk icon, select
Preferences.

  Mount point: /mnt/usbdisk1
  Icon: Jaz drive  (just soemthing which looks different from CD or floppy)
  [ ] Scale size to panel
  [ ] Eject on unmount
  [X] Use automount friendly status test

To mount, click on the icon.  To unmount, click again on the icon.
