&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of software that will enable users to access and
&gt;restore their own backups? I'm about to have a big (52 tape) DLT tape
&gt;robot for backups, and I know I can use Amanda (or probably even just
&gt;tar and friends) to automate daily backups. However, even amanda appears
&gt;to be somewhat clunky when I try to restore -- the process is something
&gt;like this:
&gt;
&gt;1) run amrecover as the amanda user
&gt;2) use the command-line interface to set the correct host (in my case,
&gt;there is -- or will be -- one host) DLE (disklist entry), and restore
&gt;date.
&gt;3) manually look for the file in the filesystem, and mark it (or them).
&gt;4) extract the file... amanda then asks for confirmation, then says
&gt;which tape to load.
&gt;5) load the tape (manually, or with an amtape command)
&gt;6) amanda may ask for another tape... step 5 again...
&gt;7) copy or move the file from the cwd to whereever you want it (or
&gt;change cwd before step 4)
&gt;
&gt;This requires sysadmin intervention, and can take a few hours. It's
&gt;particularly irritating if you need three tapes, and have to wait two
&gt;hours between each tape, and only have three hours available onsite. I'd
&gt;really like some sort of online or user-driven restore system.
&gt;Unfortunately, the rsync-based script as described here some time ago is
&gt;not presently an option, as we don't have the spare disk space, and
&gt;won't be getting sufficiently more for some time. Also, I have this tape
&gt;robot now, and suspect I should be able to automate it with this
&gt;somehow...
&gt;
&gt;So... what I want is either a filesystem-like interface (though I
&gt;suspect that this would be painfully unresponsive), or a web-based
&gt;interface, where users can clickety-click, wait a few hours, and presto,
&gt;their file is restored, and all I hear is the whirr-snick-bzzt of the
&gt;tape robot.
&gt;
&gt;Any ideas?
&gt;

hi
did you think at mirrordir? you will have problems with debian
(libc6 is not updated), or may be not, i have. it has pconsole and you
can use crontab too.
i'm working  to implement a backup policy using it and it seems to work
fine over network too.
it is just a suggestion.
