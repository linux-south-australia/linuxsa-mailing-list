Talking about inventing new terms, I remember reading this in about 1965 or so:

"The how and why wonder book of mathematics", 
Esther Harris Highland, B.A., Harold Joseph Highland, B.S., M.S., Ph.D,
Wonder Books, New York, 1961. Pages 4-6.

=======================================================
What is a Googol?

If you were walking along the street and found a piece of paper on which
was written:

		googol &lt; OO		[the symbol on the right is "infinity"]

would you know that it is mathematical shorthand? The idea of using
shorthand or symbols in place of words is very old and is widely used. More
than 1,000 years ago, the ancient Egyptians used symbols to stand for words.
Stenographers do it today, although, of course, the symbols are entirely
different. Mathematical shorthand is a short and exact way of writing
mathematical instructions and quantities.

What does ``googol &lt; OO'' mean? Translated into everyday English, it reads:
``a googol is smaller than infinity''. The little ``v'' turned on its side
means ``is smaller than''. Whatever is on the left is smaller than whatever
is on the right. The figure ``8'', on its side, is the symbol for infinity;
that is, a number greater than any we can write, speak or think.

A googol can be written as 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. It is 1 followed
by 100 zeros. It is a number so large that it exceeds the number of raindrops
that would fall on New York, Los Angeles and Chicago in more than a century.
Yet, it is smaller than infinity.

Signs and symbols are only one portion of the language of mathematics. 
Definition of basic terms is another. Together they make up a universal
language. In this way, a scientist or mathematician writing in France or
Russia can communicate precisely with his counterpart in the United States
or Great Britain. Googol &lt; OO has the same meaning to a Canadian as to a
Norwegian.
=======================================================

I wonder if it was the above passage which inspired the name "Google".
It could have left an impression on one of Google founders.

Cheers and ferrets,
Alan Kennington.
