Matthew,

That's true, but I didn't think I would be popular if I quoted the entire RFC.

&gt; The internet fragmentation and reassembly procedure needs to be able
&gt;     to break a datagram into an almost arbitrary number of pieces that
&gt;     can be later reassembled.  The receiver of the fragments uses the
[...]
&gt; 
&gt; Which says exactly that the id field is for fragments only.
&gt; 

I don't think so. It says that the id field is for fragments.
It doesn't say "only". And it says nowhere that there are
any exceptions. I would have expected a comment to the effect that
if DF = 1 then the Identification field is optional.

What seems to have happened is that the standards of clarity in
RFCs was not so good in 1981 was not as good as currently.
If it had been written now, this issue would have been discussed
and clarified very explicitly. And it seems that the linux implementers
have correctly concluded that they can see now application for
the ID field apart from fragmentation, and therefore no one will be
harmed (probably) if they cut a few corners. But standards are standards.
They have no value if both MS and linux cut corners.

I now have to tell my client that my software will only work as
required when the two machines generating voice/video conference packets
are not linux. With linux, my software will work at 50% efficiency.
(The details are way too technical to describe here.
There will be snoring in the aisles if I start.)
Therefore they will have to use Windows as their conferencing nodes
instead of linux.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
