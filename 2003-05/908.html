If only it was a simple as that, so now I'll reply in general terms.
I'd guess, that most of the people on this list are 'Resourced Based
Learners' not lecturer led disciples. In fact the best teachers are
resource based learner themselves.

Dealing with students who want their education like they want a
McDonalds' burger 'served by a slave' is emmm a -little- disheartening.

The student who takes responsibility for their learning invariably does
a lot better for both themselves and their employer.

I don't want students regurgitating material by rote, I want them to
tell me a better way to do it. There is nothing better than when a
student come up and says "hey Mr D did u know about this? and then go on
to add to my knowledge base.

Now THATS learning...

&gt; Reality: Resource based learning gives the lecturers a convenient out
&gt; for not putting in a 100% effort.
