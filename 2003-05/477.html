 &gt; I don't think so. It says that the id field is for fragments.

Alan, you've read (and probably /written/) standards documents before.
You should know that when the document is silent on some matter, that
means the implementor is free to do whatever they want.

 &gt; What seems to have happened is that the standards of clarity in
 &gt; RFCs was not so good in 1981 was not as good as currently.
 &gt; If it had been written now, this issue would have been discussed
 &gt; and clarified very explicitly. And it seems that the linux implementers
 &gt; have correctly concluded that they can see now application for
 &gt; the ID field apart from fragmentation, and therefore no one will be
 &gt; harmed (probably) if they cut a few corners. But standards are standards.
 &gt; They have no value if both MS and linux cut corners.

Which corners have been cut?  What, precisely, have you found in the 
TCP/IP stack which renders it incompatible with IETF STD-5?

As I read STD-5, the Identification field is not required if fragementation
is not happening.  It's supposed to be unique for the lifetime of a fragment;
So what happens if there are no fragments?

You've concluded that it's zero if the DF bit is set;  Without looking at
it in detail, I'd conjecture that it's -actually- zero for unfragmentated
packets, whether the DF bit is set or not.  You're probably in a better
position to test that than I am.

 &gt; I now have to tell my client that my software will only work as
 &gt; required when the two machines generating voice/video conference packets
 &gt; are not linux. With linux, my software will work at 50% efficiency.

&lt;shrug&gt;  So write your application differently.  Unless you're looking 
forward to being able to say, "I wrote the only network application in
history which works better on Windows than Linux" on your resume'.
