hi

firstly i should point out that the only way i can replicate the problem is 
with the following series of events:

1) mount the drive
2) kill the mount.smbfs process
3) unplug the network

this series of events seems to somehow create a process somewhere which i cant 
find which prevents me from unmounting the share

i tried the fuser command and this is what it gave:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@david">root@david</A> /mnt] #fuser -m /mnt/smbmount
/mnt/smbmount: Input/output error
[<A HREF="mailto:root@david">root@david</A> /mnt] #

and the same happens with all the extra dud mounts i now have as a result of 
trying to replicate the error :-)

the 'ls' command also gives the following output:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@david">root@david</A> /mnt] #ls
ls: ntfs: Input/output error
ls: cdrom: Input/output error
ls: smbmount: Input/output error
floppy
[<A HREF="mailto:root@david">root@david</A> /mnt] #
(i mounted the extra test shares onto the other directories in /mnt which are 
now also having the I/O problem)

running the stat command on the directories also gave the same error

dunno if it will help, but here is the output of the 'mount' command:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@david">root@david</A> /mnt] #mount
/dev/hda4 on / type reiserfs (rw,noatime,notail)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /dev type devfs (rw)
tmpfs on /mnt/.init.d type tmpfs (rw,mode=0644,size=2048k)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
usbdevfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbdevfs (rw)
//150.203.239.92/My_Music on /mnt/smbmount type smbfs (0)
//chiron/SharedDocs on /mnt/cdrom type smbfs (0)
//chiron/SharedDocs on /mnt/ntfs type smbfs (0)
//chiron/SharedDocs on /mnt/floppy type smbfs (0)
[<A HREF="mailto:root@david">root@david</A> /mnt] #

and i'm using gentoo (just trying to give as much info as possible)


i guess what i am really trying to do here is forcibly unmount something when 
its no-longer working as it should!!

well, thanks in advance

&gt; &gt; i'm refering to the smbfs.o module. the exact problem i'm having is that

&gt; &gt; claiming that the device is busy.
&gt;
&gt; This is probably true.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; the output of an 'lsmod' confirms this, claiming
&gt; &gt; that the smbfs module is in use by 1 process.
&gt;
&gt; This is false.  lsmod shows reference counts of instances, not processes.
&gt; If you had two mounted shared and 4000 processes with open files, you would
&gt; most likely see a count of 2 (or 3 - I think sometimes a reference is
&gt; incremented by one just to keep it resident.  For example, my SCSI
&gt; controller shows a link count of 3, but only 2 mounted filesystems off that
&gt; controller).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Other then a reboot, i cant
&gt; &gt; work out how to unmount this connection.
&gt;
&gt; rmmod is *not* what you want to do.  You want to find out what process is
&gt; currently residing on that file system, kill the processes, and then you
&gt; will be able to unmount the file system.
&gt;
&gt; "fuser -m /mount_point_name" should show you the process ids with files
&gt; open to that mount point.  Once that list drops to zero, then you will
&gt; be able to unmount the file system.
