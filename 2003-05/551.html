&gt; Having a look at their recent financials shows SCO being owned by...the 
&gt; Canopy Group.
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.canopy.com/portfolio/index.htm">http://www.canopy.com/portfolio/index.htm</A>
&gt; 
&gt; But who owns the canopy group....?  The web site doesn't say AFAIK.
&gt; 
&gt; However, whoever is the majority owner of Canopy, is the majority owner 
&gt; of SCO. With SCO being so cheap, it would make a tempting purchase for 
&gt; Microsoft, wh0 have Billions of dollars sitting around. But that is a 
&gt; leap, I have no evidence (or lack of evidence) to draw a conclusion.
&gt; 
&gt; With name changes and large stock offerings come new ownership I 
&gt; suspect. Here is a new issue of a Million shares disclosed in a 
&gt; registration statement:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://ir.sco.com/EdgarDetail.cfm?CompanyID">http://ir.sco.com/EdgarDetail.cfm?CompanyID</A>=CALD&CIK=1102542&FID=1047469-03-3746&SID=03-00
&gt; 
&gt; They have had three since February.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmmmmmmmmm...
&gt; 
&gt; I can say that the Canopy Group smells like a venture capital fund, a 
&gt; partnership of very wealthy and anonymous individuals. These 
&gt; partnerships ususally take ownership  of a wide variety of investments, 
&gt; but also have a wide variety of owners.
&gt; 
&gt; The only noticable management change took place in June 2003 when Mr. 

                                                     ^^^^^^^^^

Hmmm, Deja Vu?

&gt; Ransom Love (That's his real name) accepted a severance package from SCO 
&gt; and quietly slipped away.  In the mean time, the new CEO, Mr. Robert 
&gt; Bench has been buying shares of stock in blocks of 3,000 odd.
&gt; 
&gt; They are holding an annual shareholder's meeting today:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://ir.sco.com/Calendar-Detail.cfm?EventID">http://ir.sco.com/Calendar-Detail.cfm?EventID</A>=12069
&gt; 
&gt; Now as far as financially, the company is loosing money such as I would 
&gt; expect them to be gone in two years time. Unlike Red Hat, they have 
&gt; eaten up 95% of their additional paid in capital , and can survive to 
&gt; break even another loss year.
