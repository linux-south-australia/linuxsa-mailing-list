&gt; ISP says link is up and working, they do not support linux.

... get a new ISP ;-)

&gt; I am sure this is just a routing settup. The IP of the card 
&gt; can be pinged from outside, I imagine traffic coming through 
&gt; ppp0 do the card.

Um. I assume from this that your ppp (which I assume is a modem, right?)
and your sat links have different IP addresses? I assume also that your
sat link is bidirectional? (who is that with?)

Try tracerouting in to both addresses from the outside (use mtr -- it's
noice). You should be able to identify certain things, like the gateway
at the ISP end immediately before either the phone line or the sat link
(it's the one immediately before the couple-of-hundred millisecond
delay). If you can get to both from the outside, and all appears well,
then you should be able to set your default route as the sat link, which
will send all incoming and outgoing traffic over the sat link, or,
arrange with your ISP to get a single IP shared across both links, so
outgoing from you can go out your default route (ppp), but incoming
comes back in the sat link. You can do this using a routed subnet, or by
setting the sorce address of your PPP link to the sat address, as John
Edwards explained.

PS for some reason, the last mail I sent you bounced with a "550: we
don't accept mail from spammers" error. I am not aware of being a
spammer, and have checked my logs, and see no evidence of being used for
spam (and I am not an open relay). Perhaps you or someone else could let
me know why this might be happenning -- I can't tell if it's the
"<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>" address, or the IP address of my mailserver
(202.6.145.73) that would be doing this. Cheers.
