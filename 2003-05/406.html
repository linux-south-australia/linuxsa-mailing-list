Hospital seeks Klingon speaker

PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) -- Position Available: Interpreter, must be fluent in
Klingon. 

The language created for the "Star Trek" TV series and movies is one of
about 55 needed by the office that treats mental health patients in
metropolitan Multnomah County. 

"We have to provide information in all the languages our clients speak,"
said Jerry Jelusich, a procurement specialist for the county Department of
Human Services, which serves about 60,000 mental health clients. 

Although created for works of fiction, Klingon was designed to have a
consistent grammar, syntax and vocabulary. 

And now Multnomah County research has found that many people -- and not just
fans -- consider it a complete language. 

"There are some cases where we've had mental health patients where this was
all they would speak," said the county's purchasing administrator, Franna
Hathaway. 

County officials said that obligates them to respond with a Klingon-English
interpreter, putting the language of starship Enterprise officer Worf and
other Klingon characters on a par with common languages such as Russian and
Vietnamese, and less common tongues including Dari and Tongan.
