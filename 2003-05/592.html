&gt; -----Original Message-----
&gt; From: Richard Russell [mailto:<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>]
&gt;
&gt; It appears that Nokia Care is not owned by Nokia
&gt; anyway, and not only that, but they seem to have three responses to any
&gt; problem: update the software, invariably losing all your settings and
&gt; numbers (lucky I had a backup), "It's a Network problem", and "We
&gt; couldn't reproduce the fault". OK, maybe they have "Here's a second-hand
&gt; 'reconditioned' phone that probably has a different set of problems" as
&gt; well, but they are pretty much useless. Nothing against the people in
&gt; there, it's a symptom of a faceless corporation that brands everything
&gt; but doesn't stand behind anything.

sounds just like my experiences with motorola!
exact same excuses, exact same response.

my phone (mot 7760) would just loose the signal every so often and
drop out.  this occured even when stationary and on a call.
this is theoretically not supposed to happen on cdma.

the Motorola service people had it for weeks, when I rang to ask
how it's going (cos of course they never just ring you with info)
the reponse was the main board is fried and it doesn't even power on.
This took them about 4 weeks to determine.  Obviously someone had
dropped it, connected it to the wrong power supply or similar.
Instead they gave me a reconditioned one.  I kicked up a fuss
about why it's not a brand new one and with a new warranty, wrote
letters to motorola customer service, management, fair trading dept,
ACCC, anyone I could think of.  Got nowhere so will never buy another
motorola anything.

I know this is no help to you Richard, but it's interesting to hear
nokia has gone the same way.

I too have been looking for a new mobile for a while now.  I still
haven't found one that's suitable so will keep going with my
hyundai (!) which I bought years ago (for $70!) as a temp
replacement while the motorola was being fixed (oh yeah, they
wouldn't even give me a loan phone either cos it's cdma and so
they couldn't just swap sim cards, instead you have to ring telstra
and get them to change it and they couldn't be bothered spending
the extra 5 mins this takes).

Dave.
