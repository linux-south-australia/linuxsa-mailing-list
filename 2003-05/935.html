&gt;&gt; And there is the root of the problem. Whole ranges are 
&gt;&gt; excluded because of the number of spammers using dialup and 
&gt;&gt; or parked in that IP range. This is just the world protecting 
&gt;&gt; itself from junkmail. Do you really want to have to go into 
&gt;&gt; battle every time someone decides to improve the 
&gt;&gt; signal-to-noise ratio on their mail system?

&gt;No, I do not. Hence my attempts to find out the source of this mindless
&gt;blocking, rather than the individual mailserver admins.

As it happens, I am the mailserver admin for the domain in question.
And yes, the whole of 202.* was blocked due to the rampant amount of
spam coming from that block. 66.* will not be far behind it I feel.

This is not a decision made lightly. As an admin I need to balance the
signal-to-noise, doing this takes time (money). I cannot be sitting
24/7 blocking individual hosts/IPs. 

Spam mostly comes from dynamic IP addresses these days, so the only 
real protection is to start blocking blocks of IPs, eg
202.6.73.4
now, when we begin to see 202.8.33.211, 202.27.4.2, 202.99.66.241 
etc etc etc we need to take drastic measures, for systems with
thousands of users, these spammers can almost bring your system
to a stop. Action needs to be taken.

Creators of spam have long ago figured the work arounds for spam filters
to the point they are mostly useless, most admins now will block at the
firewall, I tend to let sendmail to the job for me. It is harsh but
workable. I am not saying this is the perfect method if fighting SPAM,
but it is all we have to work with. Should anyone have a better system
I am always open to suggestions and trialling new methods

Kind regards
Kevin
