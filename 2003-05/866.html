&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; * Interacting with external commands (specifically, amrecover -- I
need
&gt; to be able to communicate with stdin/stdout)

Problem sort of solved. I found proc_open, which will give me file
descriptors that I can read from and write to. Cool. Only problem is
that it needs PHP4 4.3.0 or greater, and I only have 4.1.2 on my Debian
Woody sytem. I think that just about does it for me and Woody. Anyway,
once I've worked out how to get around that small issue, I should have a
way to interact with interactive processes in PHP. That's a good
start...

&gt; * How to communicate with a process that lasts longer than a single
HTTP
&gt; session...

This is still causing me grief. However, I have a few ideas, which, due
to my version problems, I have not yet tested. There are basically two
parts to the problem -- the first is interacting with amrecover to
select the appropriate files, and the second is using amrestore and
amtape to actually restore the files. I think I've solved both, but hope
others can comment on my proposed solutions:

For the first part, I plan to start a new amrecover each time, and
basically build a list of selected files to restore within PHP,
re-selecting them in a new amrecover process on every page refresh. This
could be somewhat slow, but would have the benefit that a session that
dies doesn't really matter. I could keep an array (or map), indexed by
datestamp, which would contain an array containg the selected files or
directories to be restored from that date, as follows:

$selected = array( "2003-05-20" =&gt; array("/foo", "/bar/baz"),
                   "2003-05-17" =&gt; array("/bar/quux") );

and so on. Remember that the "/foo" and so on are relative to the users'
home directory. There would also be a current directory variable as well
(of course, also relative to the users' home dir), and the current date
that is being browsed -- though these could quite sensibly be passed in
the URL itself. Once all the files desired are selected, the list
command could be used to create a file that would contain text like:

TAPE Daily-02 LEVEL 0 DATE 2003-05-17
        /bar/quux
TAPE Daily-05 LEVEL 0 DATE 2003-05-20
        /foo
        /bar/baz

A script could be written to run this in an at job, using amtape to
change to the right tape, and amrestore -p and either restore or tar to
restore the relevant files... I haven't quite worked out how to do this
(which isn't helped by the fact that I lack familiarity with almost
everything I'm using here, from amanda itself through to PHP and even
HTML :) ... Certainly, this would require either an auto tape changer,
or operator intervention (and I'm not sure how that would work with an
at job, but I'll cross that bridge later...)

Another problem here (and with any solution) is that I would need to
enable some sort set uid access to amrecover, probably through sudo.
This means that effectively, the www-data user could run amrecover as
root, and probably more if I wasn't careful. Can anyone say "security
risk" ... ?

And, of course, I still have the problem of monitoring the restore
process once it has started. I don't want to have to make the user keep
refreshing the webpage to prompt PHP to check if another tape is being
asked for, or if the process is completed.

Any further comments from anyone?

Cheers

PS yes, I'm doing this on a Friday night...
