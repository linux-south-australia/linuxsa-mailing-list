&gt; Can Etheral send captured packets? See below***

It can capture it to a pcap compatible file, and you can switch the
"Follow TCP trace" output screen from ascii to hex (well, my old
0.8.8 version can).  There is a utility that can convert pcap capture
files back into raw binary dumps, but its name eludes me at the
moment (tcpflow? tcpsplice? tcptrace?  nuts (that last one isn't a
program :-)).

&gt; I will try to look for a Linux "G3 fax" front end that allows me to
&gt; specify a phone number, etc.

G3 is that fax data format (think of it like a GIF for faxes), and
it doesn't know about things like phone numbers, so it's only part
of the solution (and that's still a wild guess on my part).  There's
still more digging and splicing to be done, because I suspect the
"PCFAX Adonis-C2" part is a header of some sort, plus you will need
to add the PJL header to that as well before you can even begin to
start sending faxes, and this is *after* the binary part has been
figured out.  It's a bit premature to be throwing data at the thing
just yet.

If you can extract the data portion after the header, then running
the "file" command across the data should reveal if it's in a common
format or not.

&gt; Netcat is a mystery to me, it should do the job, but the documentation,
&gt; to me, does not make clear how the commnd really works.  Some of the
&gt; documentation out there shows commands that appear to now be obsolete,
&gt; or that are not in use with the version of Netcat on my machine. I have
&gt; sent netcat commands only to have it just sit there and do nothing, then
&gt; give me an annoying "punt!" message when I hit control-c.

nc &lt; file_loaded_with_data  multi_hostname port#

I suspect that if you can grab a binary capture of the data and dump it
into a file, then you could execute the above and have it work.  The
trick would be creating a compatible format of your own so that you don't
have to have an infinite number of faxes, with everything you'd every want
to fax prepared in advance.

&gt; The next trick will be to "make a print driver" or "find one already
&gt; made". I have no idea where to start, except to look for the "G3 fax"
&gt; drver, assuming that it will allow me to include a phone number, etc to
&gt; send the fax to. Any ideas as to where I might look.

We're not at that stage yet, buddy, for reason outline above.  :-)
