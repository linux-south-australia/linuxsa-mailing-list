Resend, misfire last time.

&gt;As it happens, I am the mailserver admin for the domain in question.
&gt;And yes, the whole of 202.* was blocked due to the rampant amount of
&gt;spam coming from that block. 66.* will not be far behind it I feel.
&gt;
&gt;This is not a decision made lightly. As an admin I need to balance the
&gt;signal-to-noise, doing this takes time (money). I cannot be sitting
&gt;24/7 blocking individual hosts/IPs. 
&gt;  
&gt;

Here's some quick stats derived from 
<A HREF="http://ftp.apnic.net/stats/apnic/apnic-2003-05-26">http://ftp.apnic.net/stats/apnic/apnic-2003-05-26</A>
Using only the AU entries, this is how Australia has it's IP's allocated:

61.0.0.0/8: 311296      3%
129.0.0.0/8: 327680     3%
141.0.0.0/8: 262144     2%
150.0.0.0/8: 393216     4%
151.0.0.0/8: 131072     1%
163.0.0.0/8: 393216     4%
202.0.0.0/8: 1061376    11%
203.0.0.0/8: 5629696    59%
210.0.0.0/8: 679936     7%
211.0.0.0/8: 180224     1%
218.0.0.0/8: 34048      0%
220.0.0.0/8: 65536      0%

What you're saying is that you have voluntarily cut off access from more 
than 10% of Australia to your customers? Do you inform your customers of 
this before they sign up with you?

202.* in New Zealand makes up 36% of their countries IP addresses.

&gt;Spam mostly comes from dynamic IP addresses these days, so the only 
&gt;real protection is to start blocking blocks of IPs, eg
&gt;202.6.73.4
&gt;now, when we begin to see 202.8.33.211, 202.27.4.2, 202.99.66.241 
&gt;etc etc etc we need to take drastic measures, for systems with
&gt;thousands of users, these spammers can almost bring your system
&gt;to a stop. Action needs to be taken.
&gt;  
&gt;

What sort of mail server cannot handle a few thousand accounts worth of 
mail, including the spam? I have multiple systems with 20K accounts and 
no spam filtering as yet, and they cope just fine.

&gt;Creators of spam have long ago figured the work arounds for spam filters
&gt;to the point they are mostly useless, most admins now will block at the
&gt;firewall, I tend to let sendmail to the job for me. It is harsh but
&gt;workable. I am not saying this is the perfect method if fighting SPAM,
&gt;but it is all we have to work with. Should anyone have a better system
&gt;I am always open to suggestions and trialling new methods
&gt;  
&gt;

What methods have you tried so far? When you say 'most admins' who are 
you referring to?
