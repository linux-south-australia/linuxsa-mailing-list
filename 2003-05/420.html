&gt;  &gt; One very annoying example was that in the late 1980s and through the
1990s,
&gt;  &gt; and mabe still now, cheap modems made for the USA were verboten in
&gt;  &gt; Australia because they just _might_ be used in a reckless manner,
&gt;
&gt; That's not why they were verboten, Alan (and it wasn't targetting cheap
&gt; modems in the USA either).
&gt;
&gt; They were prohibited because it was against the law to attach *any*
&gt; equipment to the Australian telephone network until it had been tested
&gt; by Telecom (and later Austel).  And the reason wasn't because people
&gt; might use it in a reckless manner, it was because the regulators wanted
&gt; to make sure that there wasn't any connection between the 240VAC mains
&gt; supply and the telephone network which could damage telephone exchanges
&gt; and electrocute a linesman working on the other end of your telephone
&gt; line dozens of kilometers away.

I don't believe this claim of "the reason" is correct. There was just as
much emphasis placed on the operational characteristics of the attached
equipment. This was to ensure that its use didn't interfere with the
operation of the carrier's equipment and that its use didn't interfere with
other users. While the safety aspect is certainly an important
consideration, it was by no means the only one.
