Nah. There are many reasons I dislike RedHat. Many. 

* The whole philosophy of the company
* rpm
* bluecurve
* so many redhat-isms
* redhat network
* stability 

and so on. It would be a backwards step from Debian (despite being more up 
to date). 


To be honest, I don't need another which-distro-is-best war. I recognise 
that some people like RedHat, for good reasons (there are some things I like 
about it too), some like Debian, some like to roll their own. That's fine. 
For me, it appeared that Debian was what I wanted, but now I don't think it 
is. Now, it appears that maybe either FreeBSD or gentoo might suit my needs, 
but I don't have the luxury of having spare computers that work to try them 
out on, nor do I have a whole lot of time spare to get to know both before I 
make a decision. That said, my laptop is presently compiling its heart out 
building a few ports on FreeBSD... So far, so good -- though it's a very 
different feeling OS. Also, downloading and compiling is slow... . . . But 
hey, I can live with that, as long as things work and are up-to-date, and 
the thing is stable (I'll have some more requirements when I stop to think a 
little further, too).
