&gt; Would we not all be better off snail-mailing our representatives asking

I think snail-mail will be more effective.
 
&gt; I told a friend of mine, a reporter for the Messenger, about this. She 
&gt; talked to her editor but was told to drop it because no one will 
&gt; understand what the point is. I imagine the response from the Advertiser 
&gt; to be either similar, or some paid editorial about how "open source" == 
&gt; "communism".
&gt; 
&gt; Unless we, the open source community, make it clear to our elected 
&gt; representatives that they must support this Bill and do all we can to 
&gt; promote it (i.e. get everyone we know to do the same) then the only 
&gt; feedback the government will get will be from Microsoft and other 
&gt; commercial software companies. It doesn't take too much immagination to 
&gt; work out that the Bill will quickly be dropped after that.
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of bitching about the wording and complaining that one of the 
&gt; major parties is not introducing it, how about we all get behind it and 
&gt; show some support, so it has a chance of passing?

Unfortunately, if the wording is incorrect, and it ends up achieving the 
wrong thing, you have not really achieved anything.

To do the most public good in this area, I think that governments must 
insist on open standards, not simply mandate open source software.
