&gt;Subject: Re: Looking for CDRW Master burners.
&gt;
&gt;Whenever I've been asked to repair something made by Sony it's
&gt;generally been a bitch to repair, often due to being badly made in the
&gt;first place, which is also the reason why it failed. I've fixed a Sony
&gt;amplifier where if you disconnected the preamp section from the power
&gt;amp section to see which section the fault was in, using the internal
&gt;plug handily provided, the power supply blew up. And they were
&gt;responsible for a vast number of shitty CD players in the early days
&gt;of CD, with their horrible idea of having one DAC multiplexed between
&gt;channels - blech.

One DAC multiplexed for both channels was very common across all brands with
dual DACs only becoming popular in consumer grade equipment in the early
90s.  I remember reading a lengthy discussion on the subject in a mid 80s
Electronics Australia magazine.  There were two primary disadvantages: a
very slight delay between channels when switching back and forth, and a
slight decrease in frequency response on mono recordings.  While fringe
golden eared crowd threw a huge frenzy, 99% of the population were delighted
to finally have something that sounded better and was more durable than
vinyl ;-)  Of more concern were the 14bit DACs used early on to cut
costs....

I find Sony TVs to be high quality (although Sony ceased making their own
CRTs a few years ago...) although the car hifi equipment isn't up to
scratch.  Video cameras are excellent and those complaining about modern
VCRs being sub-par quality should take a look at all leading brands:
they're universally cheap 'n nasty now.  Bring on cheap recordable DVD! ;-)

See ya
