&gt;&gt;I'm looking for a portable MP3 player.  I have very little idea about
&gt;&gt;what features I should be looking for, or where I should be looking
&gt;&gt;for them here in Adelaide.  Can anybody help?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Good things to look out for;
&gt; 
&gt; - - Storage: Hard Drive? Size? Removable Media (CD/MD/etc)?  How cheap 
&gt; are these to buy/produce?
&gt; - - Battery Life; what type of battery (cost?)
&gt; - - Playback; some devices play back mp3's terribly, some have massive 
&gt; gaps between tracks, some play back other formats (WMA, yet to see one 
&gt; that does OGG), whether they do VBR well
&gt; - - Design; how portable it is, how well it fits into a pocket/onto a 
&gt; belt, how well it takes being dropped/scratched/etc
&gt; - - OS support; many of the USB devices can be mounted as removable 
&gt; media, meaning virtually anything can put files onto it, but some 
&gt; require index files/certain directory structures, which means 
&gt; proprietry applications
&gt; - - Sound quality; some use better mp3 decoding chips/algorithms then 
&gt; others.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm quite partial to the Apple iPod's;  they play back mp3's 
&gt; brilliantly, they look great, sound quality is awesome (better then the 
&gt; Creative Zen; despite Creative's claims), I've had a friend that's 
&gt; dropped his quite a few times, and it's survived; and there's 
&gt; Windows/Linux/BSD apps out there to "sync" your mp3's to it.  Too bad 
&gt; the price tag is ~$1000 - but its definitely worth it.
&gt; 
&gt; R

Here is a review on an iPod like device that is supposed to have linux 
and OGG support in the near future - I have no personal experience with 
it though, just saw a link on linux.com today.
