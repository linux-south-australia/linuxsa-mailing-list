&gt; &gt; I have a solution -- why doesn't the original sender (Ian?) email 
&gt; &gt; another similar (or identical) message, and address it to the same 
&gt; &gt; mailing list, along with both Greg and Brian (the KMail user).
&gt; 
&gt; Ian has done this SFAIK.
&gt; I could read his posts direct to me via airnet and via compuserve 
&gt; perfect;y well, though they presented differently (the former I could 
&gt; see on screen within the message body, the latter produced a widget 
&gt; that led to a perfectly readable picture).
&gt; That via the lca2004 digest was the original issue.

Perhaps it is these two messages that should be diff'd... However, it
appears something strange is happenning somewhere... if Ian sent two
identical messages to your two addresses, yet KMail read them
differently, then surely either one or other of your ISPs is doing
something funny to mails, or KMail is random.

&gt; &gt; Greg
&gt; &gt; can diff the two messages, and use his evident knowledge of 
&gt; SMTP and 
&gt; &gt; MIME to show any changes that *could* affect a mail client, even if 
&gt; &gt; they *shouldn't*.
&gt; 
&gt; He has done this to some extent, I believe.  His cryptic 
&gt; comments about 
&gt; the similarities or otherwise meant nothing to me I'm afraid.

Yes, I figured that. The comments weren't particularly cryptic, they
just assumed knowledge of SMTP and IMAP.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Brian can see if he has the same problem with the
&gt; &gt; directly sent copy as he does with the mailing list message.
&gt; 
&gt; See above.  No issues with directly sent jpg or gif files.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Greg can
&gt; &gt; (assuming he can force himself through it) attempt to open both 
&gt; &gt; messages in KMail also.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe he has sucessfully done this.  I'm not sure if he 
&gt; has tried to 
&gt; read the digest version in Kmail.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;By doing this, you should be able to tell
&gt; &gt; where the error is coming from -- the sender, the mailing list,  
&gt; &gt;KMail, or Brian's KMail setup.
&gt; 
&gt; Hopefully.  I have sent hime my kmail config for comparison with his, 
&gt; but have not seen any result so far.
&gt;
