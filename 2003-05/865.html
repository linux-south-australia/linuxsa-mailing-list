Richard,

Seriously, www.php.net is THE place.
<A HREF="http://php.resourceindex.com/">http://php.resourceindex.com/</A> has some nice examples.

Or look on www.freshmeat.net  for php impementations of similar tasks
you're trying to achieve & pull that code apart to see how it's done.
For example, you may benefit from looking at the php code for a file
browser.

There's always #php on irc.freenode.net. Lots of gurus willing to help
out in real time. Provided your questions aren't too newbish.

Regards,
Rick

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to learn some PHP (and the HTML I don't know). I've got the
&gt; real basic stuff sorted, but would like either some decent tutorials on
&gt; specific things, or some eg code with specific things in it...
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically, the specific things I'm talking about are :
&gt; 
&gt; * Text Processing (I'm not real familiar with Perl either, so that won't
&gt; help)
&gt; * Creating a selectable and browseable list so checkboxes can be passed
&gt; back to PHP...
&gt; * Interacting with external commands (specifically, amrecover -- I need
&gt; to be able to communicate with stdin/stdout)
&gt; * How to communicate with a process that lasts longer than a single HTTP
&gt; session...
&gt; 
&gt; The first is simple stuff like how do I get text that looks like this:
&gt; 
&gt; ---
&gt; 2003-05-20 .
&gt; 2003-05-20 bin/
&gt; 2003-05-20 boot/
&gt; 2003-05-20 dev/
&gt; 2003-05-20 etc/
&gt; ...
&gt; ---
&gt; 
&gt; and make it into a nice HTML list. I know how to do this with awk, but
&gt; not PHP.
&gt; 
&gt; The second is just forms, I guess... I'd like to have HTML that looks
&gt; like this:
&gt; 
&gt; [ ] /bin/
&gt; [ ] /boot/
&gt; [ ] /dev/
&gt; [*] /etc/
&gt; 
&gt; and click select, and have PHP know that I have selected "/etc/". I
&gt; think this would be obvious if I knew a little more HTML (checkboxes are
&gt; common enough that they should be obvious)...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The third is more complex... The only way I know how to interact with
&gt; amanda's recovery system is through amrecover. How would I go about
&gt; starting this process, entering commands into it, getting results of
&gt; said commands, and then parseing them in PHP?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The fourth is possibly quite painful. I'm really not sure how to do
&gt; this. Somehow I need to either keep the one instance of amrecover going
&gt; from when a user logs on until they have successfully restored their
&gt; file (which could take twenty or so page clicks, and then an hour or
&gt; more of time to do the restore). Alternatively, I could start a new
&gt; amrecover for each page, and keep the actual selections in a php session
&gt; variable... This sounds messy, as amrecover would (surely) be better at
&gt; doing that for me, and no matter what, I have to solve the problem of
&gt; what happens when I try restoring something, and it takes hours (which
&gt; would doubtlessly exceed any session that I could maintain with the
&gt; browser).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure there would be half-decent tutorials around somewhere that
&gt; would do the first two at least, but starting from www.php.net, I
&gt; haven't yet found them. I'd certainly find some simple example code
&gt; helpful. I don't actually want to learn everything about PHP, I just
&gt; want to learn what I need.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I'd like to ensure that my code is modular ... Anyone know of any
&gt; tutorials on PHP classes or other mechanisms for ensuring modularity of
&gt; code?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
