Hi everyone,
 I'm part of the organising collective for the 2003 Students of
Sustainability Conference.

 Where: Flinders University, South Australia
  When: Monday 7th - Friday 11th July
   WWW: <A HREF="http://studentsofsustainability.org.au/">http://studentsofsustainability.org.au/</A>

 The conference aims to address all forms and levels of
sustainability, and areas that have been neglected are the range of
issues surrounding our use of computers and technology and 
attitudes towards IP and software ownership.
 
 SoS2003 is being run on an "open space" model, meaning almost all
the content of the conference is provided by the delegates
themselves. (We expect about 600 delegates).
 
 So if this conference interests you and you want to hold a workshop
on anything ("Linux: an alternative to Windows", "Microsoft, Free
Software and Argentina", "What is Free Software?", "How to make
soymilk", "Copyright, copy protection and your rights" ...), contact
me and I'll help get things happening at the conference for this
aspect of sustainability, and spread the word that there is such a
thing as Linux and Free Software.

 Each day has a different (broad, only for guidance) theme and
begins with a plenary with speakers before workshops begin for the
day. Friday's theme is "Cultural and Societal Sustainability", which
is where Software/Freedom/IP issues would be best placed. 
 
 It would be great to have someone to speak for 10 or 20 minutes
about Free Software and IP to the audience at Friday's plenary,
keeping in mind that most people will be users of computers, not
experts, and this will probably be the first time they heard of the
concept of free software. So if anyone knows someone who could give
a great talk like this, please let me know! Of course, not much can
be explained in 10-20 minutes, but just enough to get people
interested and inspired. There could be a forum/workshop held by the
speaker after the plenary in openspace for delegates to come to if
they want to know more.

 I haven't been before to a LinuxSA meeting, but I'll be at
Tuesday's meeting so if anyone's interested they can speak to me
before and after the movie. I'll have some flyers to give out too.

 Michael.

 PS, What do I do? Hmm.. I'm doing studying towards a BSc (CompSc)
and DipLang (German) at Flinders University, but generally
neglecting that and giving too much attention to organising this
conference and stuffing around with my Gentoo linux installation.
