&gt; Or as has been mentioned before there are other reasonable ways to get

Barney,

At the risk of driving some innocent bystanders up the pole...

Actually RFC 3095 does cope very nicely with your scenario.
It efficiently encodes the _non-negative_ deviation of the the IP ID
from the increment-by-one rule. It even copes nicely if the bytes
or the 16-bit field are in little-endian order. 
I didn't want to go into details. RFC 3095 is _very_ complex. 

The frustrating thing is that the inventors did not sample the
traffic from a linux box before setting their design parameters in stone.
Just one single number in the spec needs to be changed from 0 to -1
to fix the problem. This is just an example of how linux does not
have the market share yet to force protocol designers to take it into account.

This, incidentally, is the last reply on the ROHC (RFC 3095) mailing list:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
b) Constant IP-ID (as mentioned by Alan and Fredrik).

Since it does not follow RFC 791, I see that as an "irregular" case.
IMHO, it's not worth the protocol change on RFC 3095 in order to
optimize just for this special case. It would be much easier to change
the IP stack implementation to be compliant with RFC 791 and have
the benefit of optimal performance of ROHC.

Actually, it seems to me the change is necessary for interoperability of
IP itself, i.e., what if the receiving IP node, by following RFC 791,
does not check DF bit? What will it do with two IP datagrams with
same IP-ID? Or did I miss any RFC that updates RFC 791 in this regard?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In retrospect, I made a mistake to present this as a standards compliance
issue, since a good lawyer can prove that the Sun rises in the west
if you pay them enough. Written English is just ambiguous.
It's a strategic issue. Perceptions are important.

Let me put it this way:

-	The mobile phone industry is going to say that linux is
	in non-compliance with RFC 791.
-	MS is going to agree, and they'll pay an "independent"
	consultancy to prove that linux has an "issue".
-	It's trivial to change the linux kernel to do the
	increment-by-one rule which it already does for TCP.

The question is not: "Is linux kosher/halal/dinkum?"
The question is: "Do you want linux to gain wide acceptance?" and
"Do you want to avoid a PR coup for the anti-linux camp?"

The general public knows even less about RFC legal interpretation
than the least knowledgeable among us.
There will be maybe 500 million 3G handsets out there with
RFC 3095 in 5 to 10 years.
So I say linux should be wise, not clever, and just put back
the increment-by-one rule for IP ID fields.
As MS has taught us, it's usually better to win than to be right.
And I'm only suggesting that one dubious linux feature be replaced
with an unambiguously correct implementation choice.
(If linux can't be secure without hiding a tiny percentage of IP ID fields, 
then linux security must be horribly slack, which we know it isn't.)

Another point I should make is that I think that if MS had done the same
thing with the IP ID, then linux advocates would be pointing the finger
at them and talking about "embrace and extend".

Right now, RFC 3095 exists only in the lab. But when it hits the fan,
it would be good if linux was "3G-ready" already.

Anyway.... Time to purchase the weekly munga.

Cheers again,
Alan Kennington.
