&gt; In other words, Mr. Stallman owns your software if it's in the kernel.
&gt; What's yours is his, and what's his is his own.

So you don't use GCC or programs compiled by it? Emacs? Any tools that 
have been written for the GNU project?

The GPL was invented to stop companies from witholding source code from 
users of a program, this is by definition is anti-proprietary. Whoever 
holds the copyright owns the code and it is up to the copyright holder 
to provide a license when releasing the source code. Hence, as the 
copyright holder, if you choose to release your source code under the 
GPL, you are taking an anti-proprietary stance.

Linux is released under the GPL, and hence is anti-proprietary. There's 
no getting around that fact, so saying that the kernel is becoming more 
anti-proprietary is like saying that one shade of black is more black 
than another.

If you want a free as in beer, proprietary-friendly kernel, you should 
be using a BSD, not Linux.


&gt; By the way, the module (above) that I'm currently developing might end up
&gt; going under GPL - or some licence which is little more free than that.

And so by releasing software under the GPL, *you* are being 
anti-proprietary, and that it is your choice. I assume Stallman has not 
forceed you to do this, on pain of torture or similar, so it has been 
your decision to do so.

&gt; I think that Mr. Stallman has taken the generosity out of "free software".
&gt; 

I think he is trying to protect users (giving them the right to fix and 
otherwise modify the software they use) and developers (so that 
redistributed derivatives both acknowledge and enhance their original 
work), which is a noble persuit. However to say Satallman is doing this 
is incorrect. He is responsible for the GPL and a lot of evangilism, but 
it is the copyright holder who releases their code under the GPL that is 
to "blame".
