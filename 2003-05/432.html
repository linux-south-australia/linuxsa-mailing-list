Mark, many thnx for taking the time to reply in detail.
I will certainly go through the process of requesting a check for old 
copper lines tomorrow with a good ISP.
Any recommendations =)

Again thnx

&gt; You might still be ok, though -- When Telstra retrofit RIMs to old
&gt; areas, they often cut local phone services at the pit next to the RIM
&gt; and rejumper them onto it.

&gt; That means there's often straight-through cable between the pit next
&gt; to the RIM and the exchange which is unused.  It just sits there with
&gt; nothing connected to either end of it.
&gt;
&gt; Telstra has recently made a change to their wholesale ordering process
&gt; which means that cable can be used if it exists.  It doesn't help 
&gt; everyone,
&gt; but if you submit an ADSL order and it's rejected due to "Incompatible
&gt; Infrastructure" then you ask the ISP to resubmit the order with a request 
&gt; for a search to be made for clear copper.
&gt;
&gt; If that search is successful, then your home phone line will be taken off
&gt; the RIM and jumpered on the old copper.  Telstra will charge a fee for
&gt; this to happen (which is why you have to ask your ISP -- It doesn't 
&gt; happen automatically).  Then you'll be able to resubmit your ADSL order.
&gt;
&gt; Note that paying that fee doesn't necessarily guarantee ADSL: The disused
&gt; copper will inevitably be fairly old, so when you resubmit your ADSL 
&gt; order there's a non-zero chance that it'll be rejected because the line
&gt; loss is too high (and if that happens you won't get the changeover fee
&gt; back).
&gt;
&gt; This is all fairly recent.  It was privately announced to us for trial
&gt; purposes in February, and formalized by Telstra last month.  If you've
&gt; previously had ADSL rejected then you have nothing to lose by applying
&gt; again to see if you can be taken off the RIM.
