&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't it isn't valid MIME.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; What problem do you see?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It looked like it was part of a MIME message was quoted without the
&gt;&gt; framework to make it a proper MIME message.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly.  Now it can be told!  :-)
&gt; Actually, perhaps the smiley shoud not be there.
&gt; I sent a jpeg to Daniel (who also uses Kmail) - it worked just fine.
&gt; Did the same for Ian - no problems.
&gt; Ian sent me his original jpeg "direct" - worked just fine.
&gt;
&gt; It now seems clear that the problem is that when messages are processed
&gt; to form the lca2004 digest, changes are made to MIME/jpg files such
&gt; that Kmail (and no doubt some other mail clients) cannot read them.
&gt; THAT needs to be fixed.

Well, I've done a diff of what I sent to the list and what came back,
and there weren't any changes that I could see.  Also, this doesn't
explain why you couldn't view the image I sent you, though I was quite
able to view both mine and Ian's with KMail.  The only explanations
that I can see are that your KMail configuration is stuffed up, or
that your particular version is buggy.
