&gt; &gt; But, but, surely that doesn't mean blocking mail from decent folks? Is 
&gt; &gt; that a 'right' thing to do? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there anything I can do - my ISP can do so - we are not labeled 
&gt; &gt; "spammers"?
&gt; 
&gt; I would be very happy to find a better solution, and I am currently working
&gt; on one, but it rather involves a dns lookup for each mail, but does seem 
&gt; more effective. I have removed the 202.* ban and replaced it with a more
&gt; 'sane' block. If I continue to get too much spam from that block, it will
&gt; go back on.

Kevin,

I'm sure I can't tell you anything you don't know already, but who knows...
In my own experience, more than 85% of all spam attempts come from
a domain name which "postfix" calls "unknown". I.e. the SMTP peer IP
address is not in the reverse DNS. Of the remaining percentage,
about half at least would have a HELO address which is not a FQDN.
So my postfix chucks these two out without even looking at the 
From and To addresses. (In my case, the rest of the junk mails get
thrown out because I have 40 e-mail aliases and I use a different one
for each mailing list or individual. And if one is found, I just comment it
out of /etc/aliases. Obscurity _is_ a good defence against spammers.
If they don't know your address, they can't get very far.)

My conclusion is that you get a pretty good spam exclusion probably
from just excluding all mail which is:
-	from 202.* _and_
-	(without a FQDN as HELO address, or
-	without a reverse DNS for the SMTP peer IP address).

Chopping out mails with From-address = <A HREF="mailto:support@microsoft.com">support@microsoft.com</A>
would cut out half of the remaining junk, I reckon.
And I estimate a half of what remains after that would have a
HELO address which is the same as the destination mail server
IP or domain name address. Sneeky spammers!!

If what I've said is obviously right or obvioulsy wrong, please ignore it...

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
