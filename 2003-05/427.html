&gt;&gt; They were prohibited because it was against the law to attach *any*
&gt;&gt; equipment to the Australian telephone network until it had been tested
&gt;&gt; by Telecom (and later Austel).  And the reason wasn't because people
&gt;&gt; might use it in a reckless manner, it was because the regulators wanted
&gt;&gt; to make sure that there wasn't any connection between the 240VAC mains
&gt;&gt; supply and the telephone network which could damage telephone exchanges
&gt;&gt; and electrocute a linesman working on the other end of your telephone
&gt;&gt; line dozens of kilometers away.

&gt;I don't believe this claim of "the reason" is correct. There was just as
&gt;much emphasis placed on the operational characteristics of the attached
&gt;equipment. This was to ensure that its use didn't interfere with the
&gt;operation of the carrier's equipment and that its use didn't interfere
with
&gt;other users. While the safety aspect is certainly an important
&gt;consideration, it was by no means the only one.

No it is quite correct, the legislators primary concern is user safety.
The Austel requirements for equipment connected to the PSTN are very
strenuous and prohibatively expensive.   You do not get much change from
$16k for each submission, note if you fail *any* part of the test you have
to resubmit.
