&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps it is these two messages that should be diff'd...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, somewhere along the line the fact got lost that this was
&gt;&gt; a digest version of the message, and thus potentially
&gt;&gt; different from the version most of us see.  I diffed the
&gt;&gt; versions sent directly from the list and saw no useful difference.
&gt;
&gt; Well, in that case, diffing a normal non-digested message won't help at
&gt; all.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Greg can diff the two messages, and use his evident knowledge of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SMTP and MIME to show any changes that *could* affect a
&gt;&gt; mail client,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; even if they *shouldn't*.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anybody can diff them :-)
&gt;
&gt; In theory, yes, in practice no...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; At this point, the obvious thing to do is to take exactly the
&gt;&gt; message that Brian has difficulties with and look at it
&gt;&gt; elsewhere.  Is there a way to resend the digest mail?
&gt;
&gt; Brian -- perhaps you could bounce or forward as an attachment (don't
&gt; forward it inline) the digest mail to me and Greg (probably best not to
&gt; send to the list, as it's likely to be large)... I'll certainly take a
&gt; look at it and try to open it in a few clients, and compare it to the
&gt; MIME spec... (I'm learning a lot about MIME here, and quite enjoying it
&gt; :)

I'd strongly advise to take the file containing the message and send
only that.  The best thing to do is to create a new folder and store
the message there; that way you don't have to try to work out which
one it is.  I've just tried that: file in a new folder, in this case
called sample, and you'll see something like this:

   === <A HREF="mailto:grog@sydney">grog@sydney</A> (/dev/ttypa) ~ 3 -&gt; ls -lR Mail/sample/
   total 1
   drwx------  2 grog  wheel  512 May 29 15:28 cur
   drwx------  2 grog  wheel  512 May 29 15:25 new
   drwx------  2 grog  wheel  512 May 29 15:28 tmp
   
   Mail/sample/cur:
   total 1
   -rw-r--r--  1 grog  wheel  205455 May 29 15:28 1053913094.11784.aLJa:2,S
   
   Mail/sample/new:
   
   Mail/sample/tmp:

The file you want is the one with the silly name (which includes the
date of creation and the PID of the KMail who created it).  Just send
that, completely unadorned, and we can take another look.
