&gt; I think getting outgoing faxes to work is going to be difficult.

James, James, James, James, James ... Yea of little faith.

&gt; Anyway, the job goes to the Multifunctional on port 9100, which is, I
&gt; think, a standard port number for printing.

It's used by HP Laserjets, and is basically a "connect to port 9100, dump
data and close" protocol (I'm sure with associated pat. pending).  It's
been a while since I've played with it, but I don't remember it being a
particularly bidirectional protocol.

&gt; Any ideas, or is this impossible to do? The sniffs are below:

Some of the formatting hasn't come out because of the binary nature
of the data you're trying to print, so I've had to guess at a couple
of characters.

This looks like a PJL ripoff, which is HP's Printer Job Language.  While
HP no longer give out PJL documentation, there are still a few references
floating around on the web (e.g. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~csandrew/pjl.htm&gt">http://www.cs.ust.hk/~csandrew/pjl.htm&gt</A>;)
I used to have a PDF file that described it and PCL in fair detail, but I
can't seem to locate it with a cursory search.

Anyway, I say "PJL ripoff" because I've not seen an "ENTER LANGUAGE=RFAX"
before, and a Google for the term didn't find anything either.  However!!!
Given that so far the company hasn't displayed too much "innovation" to
date, there's a good chance that it's only sending some other well known
format, such as TIFF or G3 fax.  Any chance of a (raw) binary or hex dump
of the data following the RFAX command?

I take it this is the fax number embedded within the document?  Or wasn't
there a fax number at all?
