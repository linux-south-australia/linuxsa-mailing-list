&gt;&gt; Example - the most prominent traineeship offer so far has 
&gt;been at a local
&gt;high school,
&gt;&gt; Where I would be assisting the administrator in tedious 
&gt;tasks. (Which he
&gt;laughed &gt;about in the interview)
&gt;
&gt;    What is your idea of System Administration? I hate to shatter your
&gt;illusions, but most of it is tedious tasks. Once a Network is set up
&gt;Sysadmin is all about keeping it working efficiently. Hardware 
&gt;breaks - you
&gt;fix it. Software breaks - you fix it. Someone tries to crack 
&gt;your system -
&gt;you stop them. Most smaller networks have combined Sysadmin/Helpdesk
&gt;functions so telling the same person 20 times a week how to 
&gt;open their mail
&gt;client without getting pissed off is tedious (don't laugh - 

ROFLMAO...

If you want a real life story, transcript of a phone call between /dev/me[1]

and /dev/user this morning, as best as I remember it (we don't record 
phone calls, they're too embarrassing for userland ;) 

call from laptop user, says she can't log on to network, 
i say, shutdown your laptop and unplug the blue cable, plug it in again,
then startup again, 
she says, no, i've already done all that, 
i say, are you sure, 
she says, of course i'm sure
i say, ok, we'll try something different, shutdown your laptop, and we'll
check the network card, 
she says, how do i do that, 
i say, we'll get to that
(talks luser thru unplugging credit card thingy from side of laptop, unplug,
plug in all cables)
i say, start up your laptop again (goes to get coffee, old clunker laptop)
she says, still can't log onto network
i say, are you sure all the cables are secure
she says, yeah, but i'll check them again....
she says, oh &*#^$&
i say, what (thinks: such language, how wude)
she says, i think it will work now,
i say, what was wrong
she says, the other end of the cable wasn't plugged into the wall
i say nothing... :P (thinks: the Bahamas are good this time of year, in
between bashing head on desk)
she says, i'm so sorry
i think, &lt;edited&gt;
i say, ok, make sure u double check the cables next time, BEFORE you call me

Cabinet Cleaner, Paper Shredder and Jack of All Things In Between
