Yeah, you just need to drag it to a clear spot, I have konqueror set up to use 
detailed list view. and I only have 4 columns, "Name, Size, File Type, 
Permissions", so the fifth column has enough whitespace to allow drag'n'drop 
to work even at the default window size.

It always seems to me that KDE is never totally glitch free, something that 
works in a previous version will just break. So something annoying will get 
fixed in a new ver, yay, but something that worked goes away. Oh well, it's 
still the best DE out there (IMO).

&gt; &gt; I have the same problem, worked in 9.0, stopped working in 9.1. Not sure
&gt; &gt; why, I presume it's a bug, I think I filed a bug on mandrake expert (i've
&gt; &gt; filed a few so I can't quite remember)... drag'n'drop works tho, so
&gt; &gt; that's what I use if I'm going to copy something via the gui.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Damien,
&gt;
&gt; Looks like it's not just my installation then.
&gt;
&gt; With regards to drag 'n drop, I've never used it on Linux.  Wasn't even
&gt; aware that KDE supported this feature.  Cool, it works.  Bit glitchy
&gt; though, since it won't allow you to drag a file into a window that's chock
&gt; full of files, unless you're dropping the copy into a folder in that
&gt; window.  Mmmm . . . definitely better than nothing though.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have Mandrake 9.1 installed and am frustrated by the inability to
&gt; &gt; &gt; paste a file from one open Konqueror window to another.  Click on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; document in one window, and you can choose copy from the Edit menu.  No
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem. But then go to another open Konqueror window and choose Edit,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the paste option just isn't there.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; No problems copying from directory to directory using cp in a shell,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but in many instances, this is a little too cumbersome.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 9.1 has done this since I first installed it on this computer (and
&gt; &gt; &gt; accross more than one install on this same computer).  Previous
&gt; &gt; &gt; versions of Mandrake 9.1 have had no such problem.  Just wondering if
&gt; &gt; &gt; any one knows how would I find which Konqueror/KDE file is missing or
&gt; &gt; &gt; needs reinstallation , or whether I'll need to put in a bug report ?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cheers,
