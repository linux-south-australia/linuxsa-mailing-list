&gt;You can safely ignore the ARP side of things - ARP is required for all

&gt;ARP packets for other IP traffic as well.

:-D   Ok. Got that.

&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;2. A bunch of TCP communications take place between both machines, at 5
&gt;&gt;sets of ports; (1081 & 3670),(1082 & 1085),(1086 & 1083),(1087 &
&gt;&gt;1084),(1088 & 1085) but the data section of the frame is missing.  This
&gt;&gt;packet sniff is on the bottom of my past post. (This sniff is on the
&gt;&gt;last post I made where I say a lot more is going on here)
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Those additional connections appear to be the actual files being transferred.
&gt;
You were spot on.   :-)

&gt;The verbose debug you posted before was only the control portion of the
&gt;dialog.
&gt;
Ahhhhhh!  * My eyes are opened! *   :-D   How doooo I forget the little 
details? :-)


I used the 'follow TCP stream' feature in Ethereal to quickly get down 
to everything that happened. Note that I have additional information 
because I powered off the machine and powered it back on, just as Daryl 
Tester had suggested, and that is helpful! Thank you DT!   See below:

I also plan on opening up an ftp session from a Linux box to the windows 
box to see if I can learn anything there.

I am going to place all of the files that are in Windows in Linux's 
ftproot, so files will be available. I have to figure out how to run my 
ftp server to listen on port 3670, and to allow anonymous unrestricted 
log ins. I also may need to know how to get the FTP client to accept the 
commands from the Multifunctional. I opened an ftp session from another 
box to my Linux machine and tried the command CWD and it errored out, 
but when I ran cd it worked.  Do I need to worry about this?
