&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't it isn't valid MIME.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What problem do you see?
&gt;
&gt; It looked like it was part of a MIME message was quoted without the
&gt; framework to make it a proper MIME message.

It doesn't to me.  I've just checked, and it looks fine.  If you can
see something I can't, why don't you say what it is?  Otherwise you
sound like SCO.

&gt; I try not to ask sendmail to do anything that is remotely
&gt; complicated as it's usually too hard to debug :(

Agreed, it's a pain.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes I realise sendmail is possibly not the 'best' MTA around, but I
&gt;&gt;&gt; prefer to avoid the problem as much as possible,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sure.  I use sendmail on my laptop because it just works out of the
&gt;&gt; box.  Occasionally you need to get round some local configuration
&gt;&gt; problem by pointing at a smart host, but that's an MTA function, not
&gt;&gt; an MUA function.
&gt;
&gt; Bleh, what a pain in the ass.

You don't mean horse, do you?

&gt; I never change my mail configuration on my laptop. I never have to
&gt; find a smart host to handle email for me.

So you do you get your mail out?  I thought you said you did it by
changing your mail configuration.  If you have to point at a specific
server, I can't see any other method.

&gt; I prefer that, it's less work.

What's "that"?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ah.  Good.  But why must you make a new "folder"?  What's wrong with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; existing ones.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; eh?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; As I said in the message I bounced to you, I calculated that starting
&gt;&gt; up KMail on my laptop would take about 90 minutes (and, which I didn't
&gt;&gt; say, use up about 10 GB of disk space) because it was trying to
&gt;&gt; "import" all the files in ~/Mail.  That shouldn't be necessary.  I
&gt;&gt; don't want to waste space like that.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't noticed my version of KMail doing things like that.

Take a look in your ~/Mail directory and check if you have any files.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Could be.. I don't see any weird index crap with my mbox example I just
&gt;&gt;&gt; created though.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Did you look with ls -al?  This is what was created this morning:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; total 1351
&gt;&gt; -rw-------   1 grog  lemis      4629 May 26 09:58 .$znet.index
&gt;&gt; -rw-r--r--   1 grog  lemis       101 May 26 09:58 .$znet.index.ids
&gt;&gt; -rw-------   1 grog  lemis        33 May 26 09:58 .-----.index
&gt;&gt; -rw-r--r--   1 grog  lemis        33 May 26 09:58 .-----.index.ids
&gt;&gt; -rw-------   1 grog  lemis        33 May 26 09:58 .--.index
&gt;&gt; ...
&gt;&gt; -rw-------   1 grog  lemis      1313 May 26 10:01 .apesa.index
&gt;&gt; -rw-r--r--   1 grog  lemis        49 May 26 10:01 .apesa.index.ids
&gt;&gt; -rw-------   1 grog  lemis       653 May 26 10:01 .apfortin.index
&gt;&gt; -rw-r--r--   1 grog  lemis        41 May 26 10:01 .apfortin.index.ids
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (etc).  It doesn't create just one index file, it creates two!  And
&gt;&gt; look at the size.  All of those in 2 kB frags.
&gt;
&gt; OMG! Calamity.

Don't be silly.

In my particular case, which admittedly is extreme, these files would
represent about 36 GB of mainly wasted space.  Certainly other MUAs
get by without them.


&gt;&gt;&gt; Scroll bars? Hierachies? I have about 200 mail folders, I can't imagine
&gt;&gt;&gt; USING 9000 folders since I doubt I even have that many email messages.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you imagine using scroll bars to fight your way through 9000
&gt;&gt; files?
&gt;
&gt; Hierachies would help. I wouldn't dream of having a flat list of
&gt; 9000 folders.

No, because you're using the wrong tools.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even assuming I decided to start keeping mail from all my mailing
&gt;&gt;&gt; lists I still wouldn't need 9000 folders without being able to hide
&gt;&gt;&gt; some of them in hierachies (eg have archive folders which are
&gt;&gt;&gt; collapsed by default)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Each of these files represents somebody I know.  With file name
&gt;&gt; completion, it's not ridiculously easy to find the right one, but
&gt;&gt; usually there's no problem, and with a few standard tools you can find
&gt;&gt; what you're looking for.
&gt;
&gt; What can I say? I don't operate like that. I don't think many mail
&gt; tools are designed by people who operate like that.
&gt;
&gt; ie you have unique problems.

This is an unsubstantiated claim.  Who wrote mutt?  It comes a lot
closer to being useful.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, but this is all menu oriented, right?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Not really, there are standards applications follow for key
&gt;&gt;&gt; bindings.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you give an example?
&gt;
&gt; Alt-e will be the edit menu, Ctrl-q will quit, Ctrl-w will close a window,
&gt; Ctrl-s saves, etc..

c-q and c-s break the Xlib bindings.  And I've seen c-s do different
things, search for example.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's particularly the UNIX way.  It's one of the most important
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things about it.  How do you grep through an OpenOffice text, for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; example?  What about version control?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; How do you see what your troff document will look like after markup?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You use one of the programs designed for that purpose.  Revision
&gt;&gt; control is for source.
&gt;
&gt; An OO document IS source. It's displayed specially.

It's not displayed at all.  I had to extract it.  What use is a diff
on a one-line document?

&gt; How do you spell check your documents?

With Emacs and flyspell mode.

&gt; Last time I tried running ISpell on something with markup it tried
&gt; to correct all my markups.

You didn't tell it what the markup was like.

&gt; I choose the applications I run because I find them useful - if you
&gt; don't, or they don't fit with the way you work then don't use them!

That's what I do, of course.

&gt; I don't really care if something is "the unix way", or adhering to
&gt; it for dogmatic reasons.

These are not dogmatic reasons.  I used Microsoft-oriented programs
before I was able to use UNIX.  I hated them, and I certainly wouldn't
want to go back.

&gt; I've finished bashing my head against the monitor for now BTW.

Yes, that's one of the effects that Microsoft-based software has on
me, too.
