&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a solution -- why doesn't the original sender (Ian?) email
&gt;&gt;&gt; another similar (or identical) message, and address it to the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; mailing list, along with both Greg and Brian (the KMail user).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ian has done this SFAIK.
&gt;&gt; I could read his posts direct to me via airnet and via compuserve
&gt;&gt; perfect;y well, though they presented differently (the former I could
&gt;&gt; see on screen within the message body, the latter produced a widget
&gt;&gt; that led to a perfectly readable picture).
&gt;&gt; That via the lca2004 digest was the original issue.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps it is these two messages that should be diff'd...

Yes, somewhere along the line the fact got lost that this was a digest
version of the message, and thus potentially different from the
version most of us see.  I diffed the versions sent directly from the
list and saw no useful difference.

&gt; However, it appears something strange is happenning somewhere... if
&gt; Ian sent two identical messages to your two addresses, yet KMail
&gt; read them differently, then surely either one or other of your ISPs
&gt; is doing something funny to mails, 

I think we need to establish if that is in fact the case first.

&gt; or KMail is random.

I'm using exactly the same version of KMail.  Brian has sent me his
config file, but it's so different from mine that the only thing I
could suggest is that he use mine to test it.  I consider that too
dangerous, however: there's a very good chance that he would then lose
mail he wanted to keep.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Greg can diff the two messages, and use his evident knowledge of
&gt;&gt;&gt; SMTP and MIME to show any changes that *could* affect a mail
&gt;&gt;&gt; client, even if they *shouldn't*.

Anybody can diff them :-)

At this point, the obvious thing to do is to take exactly the message
that Brian has difficulties with and look at it elsewhere.  Is there a
way to resend the digest mail?
