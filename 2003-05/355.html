The reason the kernel becomes marked as tainted is because Kernel developers 
cannot debug the kernel if proprietary drivers are installed (as they cannot 
trace through all the source code).

I understand your problem though. I worry that in the future the GNU GPL may 
become really extremist (ala what Hans Reiser said on newsforge recently). 
Then it will be time for me to switch to BSD.

I believe that the GNU license should allow static and dynamic linking of GPL 
code without requiring you to make your own code GPL. I also think that a lot 
of the binary incompatibility issues in the GNU world are because most 
developers don't want proprietary software running on their libraries. This 
sort of extremist attitude will affect the adoption of GNU Operating Systems.

At my University there is a problem with that fact that we have some very 
expensive proprietary hardware, but the drivers are only available for Linux 
(I know that sounds weird, that part is the good part :). However, the 
drivers are compiled against the Red Hat 7.3 Kernel. The Linux kernel does 
not support a binary interface, which means we need to ask the Hardware Maker 
to compile their drivers against a newer version (unless they're smart and 
make a source interface like with the NVIDIA drivers).

This sort of hassle makes it hard for us to use Free systems with some 
proprietary stuff. Let's say that a Hardware maker decides that it's too much 
hassle and decides to not bother with Linux drivers, instead they make 
Windows NT/2K drivers because they wont have to recompile for every known 
kernel out there.

A user of that hardware (and let's say this is niche hardware and so it's 
difficult to just shop around until somebody offers Linux drivers with 
comparable hardware) must now run a 100% Non-Free system, instead of a 95% 
Free system. How is this beneficial for Free Software?

This all or nothing attitude of RMS and other GNU developers may bring about 
the downfall of the Free Software movement (note I didn't say Open Source 
movement, BSD-like licensed software and more reasonable GPL-derived licensed 
software may still flourish).

One bright note is that Linus himself seems pretty level headed. I've read 
that he does not want the Kernel licensed under any later version of the GPL 
other than version 2, because versions after that are ridiculous. Also, with 
the bitkeeper issue, I think it shows he is not anti-proprietary, he uses the 
right tool for the right job. I sincerely believe that he is against a binary 
driver interface to the kernel because of engineering issues (e.g. having to 
do workarounds in order to keep the Driver-BI consistent) and not political 
issues.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents.

&gt; Loophole from the "tainted" kernels?
&gt;
&gt; It's occurred to me that the "tainted kernel" thing
&gt; can be removed fairly simply, and in accordance with the GPL etc. etc.
&gt;
&gt; The enforcement of the GPL kernel modules is done by the linker "ld"
&gt; or whatever, which is GPLed and therefore can be forked.
&gt; So anyone who wants to avoid those GPL constraints can just
&gt; fork their own "ld" which doesn't mix politics with software
&gt; and they can freely link what they like into the kernel, as originally
&gt; advertised by Linus et al.
&gt;
&gt; Then the mildly offensive "tainted" label on the "lsmod" output can
&gt; be removed similarly.
&gt;
&gt; The linux kernel 2.4.20 compiled and linked etc. with older "ld",
&gt; "insmod", "lsmod" etc. show no symptoms of creeping exclusionism.
&gt; So the solution is to just hold on to your old linker etc.
&gt; This could become another SSH versus OpenSSH saga.
&gt;
&gt; Of course "they" might then put in a clause in the kernel licence to
&gt; exclude use of forked linkers etc.
&gt; This is reminiscent of the Debian assertion that the GPL itself is not
&gt; a free document since it forbids modification.
&gt; Eventually the linux kernel licence could forbid modification of the
&gt; linker, compiler etc. to prevent fair use of the kernel for in-house work.
&gt; It's starting to look a bit like DRM and Palladium, if you project the
&gt; trend forward a couple of years.
&gt;
&gt; I wouldn't be at all surprised if the linux kernel forks as a result of
&gt; the GPL kernel module enforcement. Some big company could see it in their
&gt; interests to maintain a forked kernel which permits any non-GPL modules,
&gt; or even BSD or Artistic Licence modules etc. etc.
&gt; There are already effectively forked kernels from SuSE, Redhat etc.
&gt; As someone once said, software wants to be free.
&gt; Anyway, Sunday's almost over. Time to get serious again....
&gt;
&gt; Cheers and hamsters,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
