&gt; firstly i should point out that the only way i can replicate the problem is

&gt; 
&gt; 1) mount the drive
&gt; 2) kill the mount.smbfs process
&gt; 3) unplug the network
&gt; 
&gt; this series of events seems to somehow create a process somewhere which i cant
&gt; find which prevents me from unmounting the share

Your system is probably hosed then.  Check what the pid of the mount.smbfs
process is, then see if it's still hanging around after the unplug.  Either
way, it's probably waiting for a TCP timeout that may be a long time coming.

&gt; i guess what i am really trying to do here is forcibly unmount something when
&gt; its no-longer working as it should!!

You can't if there are still processes running on there.  You've more than
likely well and truly wedged the system with the above failure scenario.
