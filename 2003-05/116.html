&gt;&gt;The most I would expect the guy to talk about is Gnucash, Quicken and 
&gt;&gt;Turbotax for the web, plus the outlandishly expensive applications 
&gt;&gt;ported by Accpac, Oracle and Sage.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I've been keeping an eye out for decent accounting software but it
&gt;has to do the quarterly BAS thing for me 
&gt;
Ok, in my screen shots, and although a DOS program, and not the nicest 
output, ATB Write UP will produce quarterly financials
ATB write up is no longer suported or made, but people like it for its 
speed and simplicity.  ATB4 for DOS had a supposed Y2K problem that was 
never dealth with. The program is perfectly functional, it just likes to 
say 1900 instead of 2000 for the year.  I have messed with the binary 
overlay file and got some of the wording to change but could not change 
the date. But since ATBwrite up is all ATB4 is plus it doesn't have that 
cosmetic problem, it makes a decent solution in DosEMU.

Caseware 2000 will create quarterlys and even monthlys. And you can set 
up some automatic financial statements that are at the word processor / 
spreadsheet level of appearance quality.  Caseware takes a long time to 
learn, and is a lot of work up front.  But I would share my mapping 
numbers and design templates, only thing they are in the next version of 
Caseware up (2001) and they are a bit of a pita to backport the mapping 
numbers, and I have done that. However, I can't backport the financial 
statements (Caseview). www.caseware.com.  They do sell Caseware in AU.

&gt;and GnuCash doesn't.
&gt;Have you tried/heard of SQL Ledger? 
&gt;
I haven't heard of it, but I will try it.   :-) 


&gt;Dave.
