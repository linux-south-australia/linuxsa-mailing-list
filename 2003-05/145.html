I'll second that, pyslsk is surely worth the effort to get going.
And has come ahead in leaps & bounds in just the past couple of months.
<A HREF="http://www.sensi.org/~ak/pyslsk/">http://www.sensi.org/~ak/pyslsk/</A>

(16 Feb 2003) pyslsk is now available in FreeBSD ports. Install it with:
cd /usr/ports/net/pyslsk
make install clean

If you can run wxPython demos, you may be sure PySoulSeek will run too.


Another to keep an eye out for is mldonkey, it has developing support
(almost there) for gnutella, dc+connect, soulseek, open-nap, e-donkey &
bit-torrent p2p networks. Each network can be individually
enabled/disabled & it comes with a CLI, GTK+ gui & web interface setup
similar to that of Audiogalaxy's where the core daemon is run & access
is given to it via the web interface.

Not sure how well Wine runs in BSD (if at all), but another alternative
is to run Kazaa through Wine. This works extremely well.

As far as my thoughts on gnutella go, i'd steer clear of it. It doesn't
scale well, & all you end up doing is becoming a node for everyone
else's stale searches.

Rick

&gt; I miss using SoulSeek and could never get Pyslsk to work properly on
&gt; FreeBSD 5.0.  I was introduced to mutella, which connects to Gnutella and
&gt; Limeware and Bearshare and all that other stuff, but the program itself is
&gt; can never see very much data across these networks, and as a result I can't
&gt; find anything!
&gt; 
&gt; Apparently the Gnutella network protocol is what Bearshare/Limeware/etc
&gt; use, and the protocol KaZaA uses is licensed through whoever created it,
&gt; but the KaZaA network appears to be extremely broad.  Because of this
&gt; difference in networks the actual peer-to-peer networks aren't totally
&gt; compatible to connect to each other, which is a shame.
&gt; 
&gt; Who here has ventured into the world of Peer to Peer networks in Unix, and
&gt; what have you been using?  Is it GUI based or console based, or both?  What
&gt; kind of networks does it connect to?
