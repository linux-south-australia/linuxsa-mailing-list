the thing i liked about it is the kernel support for both 3Com gigabit cards
without the crashing bug and the promise support (not sure if it's 66 or 100
IDE).  could i have upgrade the kernel, yes, but my kernel skills suck and i
hate doing it. one of these days i'll managed to do a working kernel
upgrade.   :)  yeah i know it's _easy_.  :(  me not guru.

Michael,

&gt; I think you'll see some more product differentiation soon - versions
&gt; of distros that are aimed at desktop users verses back office systems.
&gt;  Whether this will  work (from a business sense) for free software is
&gt;  another thing (i.e. I want it all).

True.

I think the one thing that the companies tend to misunderstand is that
Linux system administrators don't *need* the vendors to package
everything up too nicely for them. In fact it could be a very bad model
to actually do so.

A balance between customisations that the system administrator does on
the one hand, and whether it works straight out of the box on the other.

When it comes down to:

 1) It works straight out of the box with RedHat
    - but costs a mint
    - and sort of makes me redundant

 2) It works with a small amount of documented fiddling with Debian (or
     something less expensive)
    - and costs less
    - and makes me have a job

It's a difficult call to make.
