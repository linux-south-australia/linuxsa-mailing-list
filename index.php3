<H2>General Information</H2>

<P>The LinuxSA Mailing Lists are the main method of communication
between LinuxSA members (note that the terms "members" is used
loosely; you can consider yourself a member if you're subscribed to
one of the mailing lists).</P>

<P>There are three mailing lists:</P>

<UL>

<LI><TT>linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</TT> - for general discussion on any
topic that is at least vaguely Linux-related or likely to be of
interest to LinuxSA members<P>

<LI><TT>linuxsa-announce@linuxsa.org.au</TT> - a low-volume
non-discussion list for announcements that are likely to be of
interest to Linux users in Adelaide/South Australia.<P>

</UL>

<?
# There are
#currently < ? system("/www/linuxsa/data/mainlist"); ? > people on the
#main list and < ? system("/www/linuxsa/data/digestlist"); ? > people
#on the digest list.
?>
</P>

<H2>Subscribing and Unsubscribing</H2>

<P>To subscribe, unsubscribe, or change your subscription options, you
can use the Mailman web interface:

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="/mailman/listinfo/linuxsa">linuxsa</A>
<LI><A HREF="/mailman/listinfo/linuxsa-announce">linuxsa-announce</A>

</UL>

Note that:

<UL>

<LI>You need to subscribe to (and unsubscribe from!) <TT>linuxsa</TT>
and <TT>linuxsa-talk</TT> separately.<P>

<LI>Posts to <TT>linuxsa-announce</TT> are automatically copied to
<TT>linuxsa</TT> so you do not need to subscribe to both of them.<P>

</UL>

<H2>Important Notes</H2>

<UL>

<LI><P>Postings to the mailing lists are only accepted from your
subscribed address.  This is to reduce the likelihood of spam making
it on to the list.  If you have more than one email address, you can
subscribe all of your addresses separately, and then turn off mail
delivery for all but one of them.</P>

<LI><P>The main discussion list (<TT>linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</TT>) is
for anything vaguely Linux-related, or related to the LinuxSA community. That includes (but is not limited
to):</P>
<UL>
<LI>Meeting announcements
<LI>Discussion about Linux and software that runs on Linux
<LI>Requests for help with Linux
<LI>Non-commercial/private wanted to buy/sell (if it can run Linux)
<LI>Employment opportunities (if they're to do with Linux)
<LI>Anything else to do with Linux
<LI>All of the above in relation to other Linux-like operating systems
(such as BSD, Mac OS-X) and other Open Source software
<LI>Other more-general-interest less-controversial things that are
likely to be of particular interest to LinuxSA members (eg. computer
networking)
<LI>Topics relevant to the LinuxSA community, remembering we are a technology community set amongst the wider Australian context
</UL>
