&gt; I have a FreeBSD 5.0 system here, running Samba 2.2.7a, and I want to
&gt; enable ACL's.  I want to utilize them in such a way that I can
&gt; manipulate ACL's from a Windows workstation and have those ACL's set on
&gt; my samba server.

Don't we all :-)

&gt; I've searched and searched and searched and searched and searched and
&gt; searched and searched and searched and I haven't been able to find a
&gt; great deal of information or any HOWTO's that explain what is required,
&gt; or how exactly *to* implement ACL's.  As far as I know it, UFS2 supports
&gt; ACL's.
&gt; 
&gt; So I mounted a partition in /data.  I newfs'd it specifying a file
&gt; system type of 2 (UFS2.)  Then I couldn't tell exactly what was going on
&gt; with it, because when I remounted it, 'mount' still reported it as UFS.
&gt; I was directed to have a look at tunefs, and I ran 'tunefs /dev/ar0s1g
&gt; -a enable' which told me ACL support was now enabled.
&gt; 
&gt; Now what?  I have enabled in smb.conf:
&gt; 
&gt; nt acl support = yes
&gt; inherit acls = yes
&gt; inherit permissions = yes
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From a workstation I can view permissions but not change them.  'Access
&gt; Denied.'  As a regular user and a member of the wheel group, I can
&gt; change permissions using my 'regular' account, right?  I even tried
&gt; using my 'root' account directly from a workstation to see what would
&gt; happen, but still, 'Access Denied.'

I imagine you will need to configure the source code with --with-acl=yes 
or some such ... checks ... oops, --with-acl-support.

However, no one on the Samba team has actually built Samba on FreeBSD 5.0 
with ACL support, AFAIK, so, it still might not work, but you might be 
pleasantly supprised.

Oh, yes, I think you can frob the Makefile in /usr/ports/*/samba to add 
that flag automatically.
