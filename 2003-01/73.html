Hi,
Since this often comes up:

- For whatever reason a lot of Compaq Small Form Factor (SFF) Deskpro EN 
series machines are around for Auction on ebay.com.au at the moment 
(someone must have had a lot and dumped them at the end of lease)
(goto ebay.com.au -&gt; computers -&gt; PII and have a look - some are 
complete, some are just the box - if you look on the PIII page there are 
a few higher spec ones)
- Most are somewhat stripped - no ram, hd, etc - they take SDRAM (PC100 
and up) and normal sized HD's.
- Most are around PII350 speed but come without a CD drive (difficult as 
they require a small sized drive!)
- However, they make an excellent little servers - they have room for 2 
PCI or 1 PCI/1 ISA.
- They're quite quiet and don't put off a lot of heat.
- There's a guy on Ebay in Adelaide (with whom I have no connection 
other than having purchased one) who's selling a whole pile - they're 
under $100 at the moment.
- They run RH8.0 quite well - seems to support all of the hardware - 
they have built in 10/100 ethernet, VGA, sound, USB - even USB keyboards 
work under linux - so no more PS/2 keyboards hanging around plugged in 
just in case!)

I purchased one to replace my old PII233mhz machine which had dying SCSI 
disk.  Just dropped a 128MB SDRAM in along with an existing 20GB HD and 
then booted of a floppy and installed overnight from the Internode RH8.0 
mirror via FTP!

Anyway, thought a number of people would be interested in this for a 
cheap, new years project

Happy New Year.

MMC
