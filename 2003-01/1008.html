&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; You dont *need* to bridge.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, with wireless networking, its a much preferred 
&gt; solution to either route, with wireless clients on a 
&gt; different subnet, or to just supply a VPN on the AP, which 
&gt; once tunneled into will give a local address anyway 
&gt; (basically giving you an IP on the same subnet, with the same 
&gt; end result as bridging anyway).

Hmm... care to elaborate on that? I'm planning to bridge mine, and if
it's not the sensible thing to do, then maybe I won't...

My setup is a bit unusual... I have a server sitting on a /29 (8 IP)
real subnet on an ADSL link. The server has three ethernet cards and one
wireless card. eth0 is connected to the ADSL modem, and presently has a
routable IP address on the /29 network. eth1 is connected to my internal
network, and presently has a 172.31 address. eth2 is connected to
another network not under my control, and has a 192.168 address. wlan0
is my wireless LAN, and has a 172.32 address. I had planned to try
something rather complex to get the result I want -- that is, to have
both my internal Wireless LAN and my internal ethernet LAN (wlan0 and
eth1, respectively) on real IP addresses, but protected by my firewall,
without having to get another subnet.

Plan: bridge eth0, eth1 and wlan0 together, running them all on one IP
address on the /29 network, using iptables to filter packets heading out
eth1 or wlan0, so I can use real addresses as I wish on a protected
subnet. I believe linux can do transparent packet filtering over a
bridge (though it's some time since I looked at this, and I may be
thinking of FreeBSD).

Any advice would be appreciated -- am I trying to solve a simple problem
with a complex kludge? Is there a reason why what I plan won't work, or
will be a Bad Idea?

Thanks
