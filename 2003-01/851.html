&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pity that government is a monopoly :-(

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;But you get to choose them, don't you?
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;In the absence of a smiley, I can only assume that you actually believe 
&gt;&gt;that. I am shocked.
&gt;&gt;

&gt;He obviously meant *help* choose them, which is true in Australia as well
&gt;as USA.  
&gt;
When I was still in college, I used to follow U.S. politics fairly 
heavily.  I don't things have changed much in the last 5 years, but the 
only candidates that ever get elected are either part of the Democrat or 
Republican parties.  It really is like a monopoly, ologopoly I think 
they call it. Most of the news and even classroom instruction seems to 
enfore the idea of Demorat v Republican.

I do know this, in 1991 when I really watched the campaigns, the 
following individuals had their names on the ballots in all 50 states:

Milora Fullani (New Alliance Party)
Ross Perot (Independant - became Reform Party ala Jesse Ventura)
George Bush Sr. (Republican)
Bill Clinton (Democrat)
Andre Marrou (Libertarian)

However, only Bush, Perot and Clinton were invited to participate in the 
Nationally televised debates.

It takes way too long to be able to vote in the U.S. if you move over 
from another country. The owner of my company is Canadian and it seemed 
to take a while before he got his citizenship, and with it the ability 
to vote in the U.S.

You put these factors together, I can see why it feels like a monopoly!
