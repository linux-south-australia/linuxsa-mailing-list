The syndrome was first documented in people who sat in deckchairs for too long
in air raid shelters during the bombing of London in WW2, according to
the BBC.

&gt; THE next time your boss asks you to put in a few extra hours at your
&gt; desk - remind him it could be deadly.
&gt; 
&gt; New Zealand researchers have found that sitting at a computer for hours
&gt; on end can cause fatal blood clots, just as long flights can lead to
&gt; deep vein thrombosis (DVT), known as economy-class syndrome. 
&gt; 
&gt; They discovered the link when a 32-year-old man who sat at his computer
&gt; terminal for up to 18 hours a day nearly died after he developed a blood
&gt; clot in his leg which travelled to his lungs. 
&gt; 
&gt; "This is the first reported case of an association between repeated
&gt; prolonged immobility sitting at a computer and life-threatening (lung
&gt; embolism)," wrote the researchers led by Richard Beasley from the
&gt; Wellington-based Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. 
&gt; 
&gt; They suggest the condition be called "e-thrombosis".
