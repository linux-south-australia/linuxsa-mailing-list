Hi Kim,

Thanks for your ideas. Im playing around with some static routes, and
everything seems to be progressing well :)

Yup the BSD AP works well, im writing a help guide for anyone else looking
at doing it, its locted here: <A HREF="http://www.drew.id.au/wireless">http://www.drew.id.au/wireless</A> . Its only
brief atm , but should be filled out as soon as i get the time.

And someone asked "why people still live in the 80's", its all about
waking up before you go go i think :)

cheers!

&gt; &gt; Bridging requires interfaces to be put in promiscuous mode, and transmit
&gt; &gt; packets with Ethernet source addresses.  Some interfaces (e.g.
&gt; &gt; wi(4)) do not support this functionality.  Also, bridging is not
&gt; &gt; compatible with interfaces which use hardware loopback, because there is
&gt; &gt; no way to tell locally generated packets from externally generated ones.
&gt; &gt; - --end snip--
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My questions are thus:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Why o why wouldnt wi0 allow packets to be transmitted with ethernet
&gt; &gt; source addresses? I would imagine this could be VERY insecure, or
&gt; &gt; rapidly decrease available badwidth but that is my stab in the dark, and
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. Could there be a way around this, ie everyone talks about bridging
&gt; &gt; wireless subnets, heck ive done it here, but as allways when you go to
&gt; &gt; tweak it, and RTFM you see the light :) Maybe some kind of static routing?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been able to (using wireless) bridge 2 lans using a freebsd bridge
&gt; &gt; on one side, but this was with a stand alone windows machine on the other side.
&gt; &gt; Might have been samba doing the hard work there tho. Routed is my friend.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any comments, abuse more than welcome :)
&gt;
&gt; if think back to why bridging was used "in the old days";
&gt; - mixed media interfaces
&gt; - join together ethernet segments that were too long
&gt; - "we cant afford a router!"
&gt; - "its 1985 and we don't know what routing is yet!"
&gt;
&gt; i think that if you are using bridging thatn you may need
&gt; to ask yourself why you are using it...
&gt;
&gt; IIRR wiX does not support it because, at the time when the
&gt; driver was developed there was a lot of discussion on whether
&gt; or not it would be "a good thing" and the BSD guys are a
&gt; bit ... odd like that, for different values of "good thing"!
&gt;
&gt; anyhow, if you are using wireless then you might like to
&gt; explore some of the other "seamless" routing arenas,
&gt; like MADHOC, mobilemesh or AODV.
&gt;
&gt; AODV seems to be the most portable one about at the moment,
&gt; but obviously there is no support on hardware access points.
&gt;
&gt; but as you seem to be using a BSD AP, then thats cool =)
&gt;
&gt; i have used mobilemesh quite successfully, but its only
&gt; currenly available on linux.
&gt;
&gt; anyhow, a decent setup with dhcpd, zebra/routed, dyndns
&gt; and maybe nocat should ease "seamless" networking issues.
&gt;
&gt; cheers,
&gt;
