Matthew,

We use Amavis with McAfee on our mail server...  Amavis is a performance
bottleneck, but that's mainly because its processing an average of 600
messages a day on a Pentium 75 with 32mb of RAM.  Performance is barely
acceptable under load, but if you have respectable hardware it'd be fine.  

On a couple of the user accounts we run SpamAssasin for Spam detection,
which performs well, however it needs to be updated regularly to remain
effective.  I normally receive 10-15 Spam messages per day I receive,
SpamAssasin catches all but 1 or 2 of them, but I haven't updated my
SpamAssasin rules in a few months.

Jim.

Subject: Anti-virus & Anti-spam on sendmail


Hi All,
Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on anti-virus/spam on sendmail.
i've read all the linuxsa archives on anti-virus and there's a pile of
anti-spam measures in sendmail which is excellent.  what i'm interested in
is what are people using with success?   i think nowadays that anti-spam
should be built into anti-virus.  stinks that symantec only have anti-spam
on their exchange2000 product.  crock.  sorry, starting to rant.

i read that AmaViS is a resource hog, but is free.  we have a fairly beefy
box, so apart from being a hog, is there any problems with it apart from
being a hog?

symantec has an SMTP gateway by the look of it so i might convince someone
to buy something.  like someone suggested open source virus stuff is
unlikely to happen because of the resources needed to keep the definitions
up to date.

i wonder if it's legal to use the .exe updates from symantec if one was to
figure out the format of the file.  if a person paid for a symantec desktop
license they get the use of the updates, so in that case could they use an
open source product that uses those same definitions?  just a thought.

anyway.
ta
Matt
