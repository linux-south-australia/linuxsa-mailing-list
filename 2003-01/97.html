Quoting David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dlloyd@microbits.com.au">dlloyd@microbits.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt; I know there are up to 32 possible clients awaiting a chance to be
&gt; &gt; accept'ed, is there anyway I can either a) peruse that list of waiting
&gt; &gt; clients to see who they are, or b) simply know how many are queued up?
&gt; &gt; [1]
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't this what the "select" function is supposed to do? Why do you need
&gt; to poll them all? Can't you just watch their status with "select" and
&gt; deal with them as needed.
&gt; 
&gt; You could also look at poll(2).

I don't want to poll them all, just deal with them one at a time (ie they come 
along, request some work, go away and process it and eventually come back with 
the result).  The socket connection doesn't stay open all the time.  Clients 
can join and leave any time, may be killed mid-stream, and their number may 
vary etc.

For performance measuring reasons I just want to know how many are sitting 
there (pre-accept()'ed) waiting for their turn, and if possible, who they are.  

If the connections were persistent I could select() with a zero time out, to 
find out amongst the connected who had data ready, but that's a different 
kettle of penguins.  I may have to go to persistent socket connections for 
performance reasons, but before I make that design decision I want to know 
where my performance bottle neck is.

Any ideas?
