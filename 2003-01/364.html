Not quite -- At least in the early days of 802.11b equipment, all the 
vendors built "features" into their kit specifically to prevent them 
from being used in bridging configurations.

Why?  Because if you could bridge on their wireless interfaces, there'd 
be nothing to stop you from building your own "access point" (i.e., 
wireless bridge) instead of spending a couple of grand on an Aironet or 
WaveLAN access point instead.

To give you an example:  The programming documentation for the Aironet 
802.11b cards describes the procedure for getting the card into "monitor 
mode" (the wireless equivalent of promiscuous mode, an absolute 
requirement if you intend to behave like a bridge), then goes on to 
describe an important caveat:  When placed into monitor mode, the 
firmware would *switch off the transmitter*.  And if you thought, 
"That's ok, I'll stay in monitor mode 'til I want to transmit, then I'll 
drop back to the normal configuration to spit out my packet, then I'll 
go back into monitor mode," you'd be disappointed, because it takes 50 
mSec for the card to power up the transmitter again afterwards.

The WaveLAN (xi) gear had some other different-but-similar boneheaded 
restriction which prevented you from using it as a bridge.  The details 
are hazy (it's been a few years since I looked at this), but I think it 
was something like, "You can listen in monitor mode if you want, but 
don't go trying to transmit packets with someone else's MAC address in 
the header!" (another absolute requirement for a bridging interface).

So all in all, supporting bridging on wireless interfaces was, until 
relatively recently, "all too hard".  The situation might have changed 
now (otherwise the Linux access point project wouldn't have any legs), 
but there's no reason to believe that all the drivers on all operating 
system platforms will be updated RIGHT NOW to suit the new world order.
