&gt; 
&gt; After 10 years of beating my head against Linux's documentation brick 
&gt; wall, I have to disagree. The documentation issue is what drove me into 
&gt; buying a Mac.
&gt; 
&gt; Go to apple.com/support and start browsing through the help files, 
&gt; knowledgebase, support, documentation and detailed instructions to see

Well, I have a problem with OSX that I have not been able to get ANY support or interest from Apple from, and has been logged with the apple helpdesk, with a zero result. (It's the dying lookupd problem)

Last time I spoke with the helpdesk was after installing Jaguar, and I had to talk with some moron who was not conversant with anything more detailed than how to log on and start an app. 

I've resigned to having to switch network addresses every now and then when nameservice fails (which restarts lookupd) until I have a chance to re-install from scratch. I've never had a basic service crap out like this on any other system.

Sorry, Apple's help system and kb might be good, but they are resistant to taking on individual user problems. Not good for a commercial situation where the customer is offered free support on purchase.

Looking back on my calls to M$ and comparing them with my Apple calls, I'd say that the M$ calls have usually been more professionally handled, but the wait is always longer.

Off-list, 'cause this isn't really a linux gripe. You're right about the apple help on the web, I cheered when they unlocked it so that mere mortals could access the information.

&gt; just how pallid and inadequate free documentation is in comparison. 
&gt; It's not the quality of the individual documentation that is the 
&gt; problem (eg, Apache is fairly well documented), it's the variable 
&gt; quality of documentation across the board.
&gt; 
&gt; If I bump into a problem, I never know whether it's going to be a "HI! 
&gt; HAPPY HAPPY! HELP IS HERE!" answer, or whether I'm going to have to 
&gt; wade through the source code from a 1984 variety of Brainfuck. This 
&gt; lack of predictability is like walking through a minefield where a 
&gt; perfectly rational decision like "let's group those hard drives" could 
&gt; be a walk in the park or a trip to hospital.
