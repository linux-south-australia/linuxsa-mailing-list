<H1>LQ500 printer under Linux</H1>

Some of us have been working with Winton to get his Epson LQ500 to 
print from his Linux box. Neither Red Hat 8 nor Mandrake 9 would talk 
properly to the printer. Thinking that perhaps Lycoris had a chance 
Winton loaded that up (and is very impressed with it) and the printer 
started up but unfortunately nothing would print.

I put the question to the CompuServe Linux Forum and one member gave 
back this response;
"
cat /etc/passwd &gt; /dev/&lt;parallel port device name&gt; or,
cat  /etc/inittab &gt; /dev/&lt;parallel port device name&gt;

It should print something. If not, maybe parallel port is not defined.
"

It printed and all is working well from then on. Dunno why or how it 
cleared the blockage but there you are. 

Another happy customer and another problem solving trick to add to your 
repertoire &lt;G&gt;

And if anybody has any idea why this worked I would love to hear about 
it. I don't think it had anything to do with the OS change though of 
course I would not say that in public &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
