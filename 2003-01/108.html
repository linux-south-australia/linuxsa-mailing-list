I think you left out the actual cost of building the towers for the 
antennas and underestimated the cost of cabling.   Towers are often 
expensive and require specialists AND council approval (not always easy).  
For point to point you normally need wireless bridges rather than APs - 2 
APs won't _necessarily_ associate with each other and comminicate.  You also 
have to add in the cost of the low loss antenna cable and/or weather 
proofing the Bridges.

Cabling's more than just rolls of cable and does require licensed people.  
The cable isn't the expensive bit, it's usually the people to do it.  

Even if you use volunteers for most of this, you'll probably want to factor 
in a coordinator AND the cost of running the network from the on (eg. 
Sysadmins, maintenance on key bits of kit).  

I think you're underestimating the cost of a lot of this and discounting the 
costs that are really there.

MMC

&gt; 
&gt; That would take the costs down to about:
&gt; 
&gt;     12 * $3000 servers
&gt;    320 * $1000 client stations
&gt;     12 * $500 base stations
&gt;     12 * $500 dishes
&gt;     12 * $500 Ethernet switches
&gt;    ====================
&gt;    $374,000 for ten locations with 30 clients each with two spares of 
&gt; everything.
&gt; 
&gt; On top of this, you need to add the cost of wiring (buy rolls of 
&gt; cable), desks, chairs, security and labour. The physical Internet 
&gt; connection could also be over wireless if you find a suitable ISP, then 
&gt; the remainder of the money would go into traffic costs. So with a nice 
&gt; big safety margin, I think you're looking at $50k per site for 
&gt; equipment and setup.
&gt; 
&gt; The weak point of this scenario is going to be whether the signal holds 
&gt; up when it rains or everyone in between starts cooking microwave 
&gt; dinners.
