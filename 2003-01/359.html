In my experience Lindows is full of Bologna.

They did claim to spend $1million on wine, but now I have my doubts.

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/27410.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/27410.html</A>

I know I have read more than once that they think that marketing is more
important than actual functionality, and that came from the president of
the company.

If you were actually able to browse around the Forum you would find many
people that are having practical problems with Lindows that can be
solved if they used other distributions.

Right now they are working on a click and run client that does not use
apt-get so that they can eliminate that option from the operating system.

What that leaves people that Pay $129 to buy the operating system, is a
system with no applications unless they buy click and run at $99 a year.

Pretty disgusting,  if you also consider that they would not put the
win4lin kernel into Lindows.  A customer worked for MONTHS to figure
this out and also received some *heaven sent* help on it to bring it to
fruition, and they refused to put it in. Maybe they even poisoned it.

  &gt; Help... I just bought win4lin based on this Hint so I could use some
  &gt; Windoze apps I still need. But, the win4lin install failed. It said
  &gt; that my kernel was not a standard kernel! I have installed a number of
  &gt; things via CNR but I did not think any of them changed my kernel. Is
  &gt; there any way I can go back to a "standard" Lindows 3.0 kernel that
  &gt; win4lin would install on without re-installing Lindows. If I have to
  &gt; re-install, is there a way to back up the files/programs I have
  &gt; already installed so I don't have to go through the laborious task of
  &gt; reinstalling them. I am still on a dial-up modem connection at 28K!
  &gt; Thanks for any suggestions!
  &gt;

And they don't care about functionality.  I have made several scripts
for them, that people needed and thanked me for, and they have not added
one of them into the operating system.


My friend Robert Campbell Posted this:

  &gt; wasted resources... I agree with most of what you said but the win4lin
  &gt; kernel has already been made and win4lin has an easy installer....
  &gt;
  &gt; This would take what.... maybe 5 to 10 minutes of your time?
  &gt;
  &gt; sorry but this is the time of year that everything bugs me to death...
  &gt; (I hate winter).
  &gt;
  &gt; but I don't understand... how somebody cannot take 5 to 10 minuts out
  &gt; of there day or maybe stay a little late to put a win4lin kernel into
  &gt; the CNR...
  &gt;
  &gt; ok so I suppose you will of cource want to compile your own and not
  &gt; trust mine... well here is the simple solution...
  &gt;
  &gt; 1. Get the patch patch and the kernel source (this should take maybe 3
  &gt; to 5 minutes depending on how good you guys really are).
  &gt;
  &gt; 2. start the compile of the kernel and so that way you aren't wasting
  &gt; time on the kernel you con come here and respond to ppl on the forum
  &gt; or perhaps get something to
  &gt; drink then I assume your computers can't be turtles so this
  &gt; shouldn't take to long)...
  &gt;
  &gt; So when you come back from the forums and the kernel is compiled you
  &gt; can go to step 3..
  &gt;
  &gt; 3. put into the CNR warehouse.
  &gt;
  &gt; Is this really so hard to do???
  &gt;
  &gt; Other wise I agree... get people to support linux... but when you can
  &gt; offer everyone something they have been asking for and only take a few
  &gt; minutes out of your day... where are the wasted resources?
  &gt;
  &gt; I don't understand.
  &gt;
  &gt; (I HATE WINTER... MAKES ME CRABBY!!)
  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; I see no mention of win4lin in this post of yours here...
  &gt;
  &gt; so how about that quick addition to the CNR... not for me I already
  &gt; have mine and I guess as long as it isn't in there it makes my hint &
  &gt; tip valid so that is ok too... for me...
  &gt;
  &gt; but make it sound so hard just isn't accurate...
  &gt;

  &gt; but make it sound so hard just isn't accurate...
  &gt;
  &gt; Well,I wouldn't know how to do it, and I don't want to pull engineers
  &gt; off of more improtant items to do it.
  &gt;
  &gt; It's a priority thing. We simply do not hear this request except from
  &gt; a handful of existing Win4Lin users.
  &gt;
  &gt; Maybe there's just a bit of determination in this as well...we want to
  &gt; spend every minute we can supporting LINUX solutions.

But this is what he said about an open source tax project...


  &gt; I believe TurboTax is free to people who fall below a particular
  &gt; income level (as required by the IRS).
  &gt;
  &gt; I have to be honest in saying this is one area that I personally do
  &gt; not plan on leaning on Open Source for, at least not for some time yet
  &gt; (unless you have extremely simple tax needs). Creating a program to
  &gt; fill out the form is one thing, but creating a walk-through program
  &gt; that takes all the tons of different tax code into account is quite
  &gt; another problem. TurboTax charges a very reasonable fee to support the
  &gt; company in providing a very good, highly complex program. Anything
  &gt; that deals with tax code is going to be complex. =)
  &gt;
  &gt; Fortunately, the web-based products should work fine with Linux.

Don't hold your breath. I have been fighting for decency for Lindows
customers for some time.

  &gt;Extract from the latest Lindows newsletter:
  &gt;"Desktop Linux Summit is the watershed moment for Linux on the desktop
  &gt;(Microsoft guarantees it!)
  &gt;
  &gt;I recently spent some time with a major hardware vendor who talked with
  &gt;excitement about the savings that Linux can bring as they build more
  &gt;affordable computing devices. This company is a big believer in Linux,
  &gt;but they sheepishly confessed that they weren't yet a sponsor of the
  &gt;Desktop Linux Summit (Feb 20-21st, 2003 in San Diego). They explained to
  &gt;me that Microsoft had called them up and told them not to lend their
  &gt;support to this event and discouraged them from attending. At first, I
  &gt;was aghast that Microsoft employees would be spending their time
  &gt;disinviting companies from attending the Summit. But then it got me
  &gt;thinking that it actually was a good indicator. If Linux wasn't ready
  &gt;for the desktop, then MS would be happy to have people spend 2 days in
  &gt;sunny San Diego because they would witness first hand the state of
  &gt;desktop Linux.
  &gt;
  &gt;The opposite of course is true. Microsoft is fearful that attendees will
  &gt;find out that Linux is now no longer just about the server - that it's
  &gt;ready for the desktop. It hasn't been this way in the past, but the
  &gt;stars have aligned and all the pieces have come together (user
  &gt;interface, programs, hardware support, retailers, etc.) to reinvigorate
  &gt;competition in the operating system business. It reminds me of the first
  &gt;MP3 Summit we planned at MP3.com. Before that event, MP3 was a geek
  &gt;novelty. But we invited everyone - yes, even the media companies and the
  &gt;RIAA that were not fond of MP3 - to that first event. After that first
  &gt;conference it was clear we had given MP3 a huge boost in momentum and
  &gt;propelled it into the industry standard it is today.
  &gt;
  &gt;The Desktop Linux Summit is open to all companies who wish to attend -
  &gt;yes, even Microsoft. (I personally think it would be smart for Microsoft
  &gt;to release their own desktop Linux product.) While I'm not sure Bill G.
  &gt;will accept our invitation to speak, I am confident that Microsoft will
  &gt;have attendees in the audience at the Desktop Linux Summit, quietly
  &gt;taking notes of where the industry is at. I hope you'll be there too.
  &gt;

  &gt;
  &gt;Now isn't that an interesting sutuation.
  &gt;
  &gt;cheers, Ian
