&gt; Interesting comment.  Have you spoken to Dan Shearer lately?
&gt; There is no question you CAN "buy a support contract for"  Linux.
&gt; It's just a tad harder to find, perhaps?

It's not so much that it's harder to find, but less advertised. I doubt
many have seen much advertising from us, but we support Linux servers in
particular for a number of organisations. Having said that, most
probably don't know that we also support other flavours of *NIX
(including all things commercial and OS X) and Windows.

&gt; FWIW I think Linux might well threaten Unix as well as M$.  On Unix, it won't
&gt; threaten existing installations but will intrude into new setups.  On M$, Linux
&gt; will tend to take over because of MS vulnerability and licence costs.

It already has done in a number of areas. We've helped a number of
people migrate old SCO applications to Linux (which is reasonably
straightforward), for example. By far the most migration that we see is
from Windows to Linux or *BSD. This is probably not a good indicator of
the whole industry, but more to do with our customers :-)

thx,
Matt
