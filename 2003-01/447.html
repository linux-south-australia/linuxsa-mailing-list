Hi all, back online after a few weeks -- this is a continuation of an
earlier thread from before Christmas. Hope y'all had a good break etc.

&gt; Hmmm... never used hdparm before... any tips?

OK, I used hdparm, and I have some advice for people...

Don't.

Just kidding -- it did increase the reported speed of my HDD, and
worked ok, but then I pushed it too far, with "sub-optimal" results
(in the sense that wholesale disk corruption might be considered
sub-optimal).

Yes, I know, there are warnings, but hey -- I had a fairly recent
backup, and the machine is not yet in production, so it was a risk I
could afford to take.

My IDE interfaces look like this:

hda: Seagate Barracuda IV 20G
hdb: CDROM
hdc: Seagate Barracuda IV 20G
hdd: CDRW

The HDDs are identical, being the same model (ST320011A), with the same
partitioning. They are also running under software RAID 1 (Mirror) on
each of the partitions (except swap). The CDROM and CDRW drives are
running as SCSI devices (scd0 and scd1 respectively) using the
ide-scsi module.

Anyway, after messing about a bit, I found out that the drives should
support Mode 5, according to the specs. I (cleverly) didn't check what
the motherboard supported, but assumed that it would be ok. Turns out
it only supports up to UDMA66, which I believe is Mode 4. I used
hdparm -i to see what it said, and was slightly puzzled by the "DMA
modes:" line...

hda said:
DMA modes: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2

and hdc said:
DMA modes: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 udma5

That was the only difference between the two, and seeing as they are
identical models, I can't see why there should be any difference.
Anyway, I initially went conservative, and put them both on udma2.
This worked fine, but didn't really give me the kind of speed I was
expecting (according to the -tT option, at least). So, I tried udma3.
I had a recent backup, so thought it couldn't be that bad... Seemed
OK, so I got confident. Fiddling about a bit, I did udma4 and udma5,
and started seeing huge quantities of error messages rolling up my
screen. I turned it all back, but it was too late.

Strangely, the machine still seems to work, but there are numerous
files that appear to be dying, and every time I boot up, it's an
adventure in fscking.

Aaaaanyway, I think the moral of this story is to take note of the
warnings in hdparm (which, incidentally, is why I've avoided it
entirely in the past), make sure you have good backups -- test them
first (which I later discovered is causing me problems, as my backups
appear to be corrupt), and don't do it on a machine you can't afford
to lose (which I could, so this disaster is more of an inconvenience,
and gives me opportunity to redo my machine from scratch, documenting
it properly this time... :)
