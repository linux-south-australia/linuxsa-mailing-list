&gt; If i didnt supply a constant flow of traffic (in this case it was a

&gt; Unfortunately i dont have any logs to indicate what was going on, the
&gt; client would just "disappear". This turned out to be a problem with the
&gt; silly windows (sp1 fixes it).

I already have SP1 on the working configuration.  :-)  Actually,
going back over my notes, this actually was a problem (and appears
to be a similar problem) with the initial DLink drivers.  I had to
download a new set off the 'net to resolve this.

&gt; If i was rich id just buy a harware AP from d-link, beats pulling hair out
&gt; over bridging, routing and ARP proxying, but i have learnt a hell of alot
&gt; in the meantime, which is allways good.

Actually, I'd prefer the Unix solution - the hardware APs keep
appearing in Bugtraq with various flaws and open services (the
DWL-1000 or 900 being the latest, from memory).  There's just
so much funkier stuff you can do when the black box is biege.  :-)
