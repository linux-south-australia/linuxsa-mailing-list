&gt; That is just a ballpark figure mentioned during discussions. What I

OK, I think I understand more about what you're trying to do. More 
comments off the top of my head (and hastily typed since I want lunch):

The main ongoing cost will be the connection to the Internet, and going 
wireless won't avoid that. The wireless connections will be unreliable 
or die entirely in bad conditions.

A base station is around $500, a dish should be about the same. A 
suitable server would be about $3000 (configured with local caching), 
and client stations would be about $1000 (diskless, netboot). To reduce 
costs, you can connect to an ISP that doesn't charge you for local 
traffic and offload onto their large caches.

I would buy a couple of spares of everything rather than going for the 
$10,000 machines and ultra-reliable equipment. You can't really buy 
reliability - you can only buy a statistical expectation of 
reliability. A more reliable system without a recovery plan is actually 
a lot less reliable than an unreliable system with an instant recovery 
plan.

That would take the costs down to about:

    12 * $3000 servers
   320 * $1000 client stations
    12 * $500 base stations
    12 * $500 dishes
    12 * $500 Ethernet switches
   ====================
   $374,000 for ten locations with 30 clients each with two spares of 
everything.

On top of this, you need to add the cost of wiring (buy rolls of 
cable), desks, chairs, security and labour. The physical Internet 
connection could also be over wireless if you find a suitable ISP, then 
the remainder of the money would go into traffic costs. So with a nice 
big safety margin, I think you're looking at $50k per site for 
equipment and setup.

The weak point of this scenario is going to be whether the signal holds 
up when it rains or everyone in between starts cooking microwave 
dinners.

Lunch time.
