&gt; totally unacceptable.

Thanks for the support.

&gt; I agree with the suggestion of reloading the system after each user
&gt; finishes.

Fine but I need to have a way of activly blocking access to these sites.
Cleaning up after the damage is done would be far too late. The
computers are not screened nor are they in a position where such
screening would be possible nor would I wish it to be so. There are many
adult and mature-age people attending activities inside both of these
community venues and our name would be blackened should amember of the
public see some of the stuff that even a half-tame porn site might
offer. 

There are young children who bring their family over to show them the
Internet, I have watched them do this several times and I have
encouraged their actions as it is a great help to break down th digital
divide. We need to be reassured that the debris of some persons carnal
desires doesn't litter the screen while these youngsters wait in the
wings for their turn to show Mum to cool new Bob the Builder games
online.

David, all I am asking of Linux is to provide the same or better
protection than the programs I am presently using in Windoze. Not a big
ask but to some it the mere asking seems to be a bigger sin that
allowing everybody full access to the Internet with all that entails
&lt;sigh&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
