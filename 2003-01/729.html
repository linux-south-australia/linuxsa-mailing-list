&gt; &gt;Curious.  I'd bet a bagel to a French Poodle that Bush thinks encryption
&gt; &gt;helps the terrorists.  It just may be that the war against terror provides
&gt; &gt;the perfect opportunity to FUD TCPA out of existence.

&gt; NOW you're talking!  That argument make heaps of sense.  Terrorists 
&gt; using their own  Fritz chip to ensure all their equipment and data are 
&gt; secure from prying law enforcement/anti-terrorist agencies.  Nice.
&gt; We should dissemminate this WIDELY.

I think the point of one of the TCPA articles I read from this list was
that the hardware in the TCPA is "trusted" meaning that trust is relied
upon that the software/hardware with the keys does the right thing.
Considering Microsoft and the NSA key thing, I'd say its quite likely
that the US will want this, and will have their own backdoors in it.

I also think that these companys will push it as hard as they can and
modify it slightly when they get bad press and get as much of it
operational as possible, which might not be the whole thing. Where the
limits will be drawn and what happens from there we'll have to wait and
see.
