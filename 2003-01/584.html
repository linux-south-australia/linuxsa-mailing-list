&gt; &gt; I may be wrong but I thought LCD screens IGNORED refresh rates and they
&gt; &gt; only listen to what resolution you want them to run at. In fact I seem
&gt; &gt; to remember that older LCD screens behave like older fixed frequency
&gt; &gt; monitors and can do funny things if you run them at a resolution the
&gt; &gt; manufacturers don't expect you to.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember the picture is sent as an analog signal, serially, on the vga
&gt; cable (Unless your using one of those digital flat screen interfaces,
&gt; but I havnt seen these in use yet). The refresh rate refers to how many
&gt; frames get sent down the cable per second. Therefore, higher refresh
&gt; rates mean each frame gets less time on the cable, and the lcd driver
&gt; gets less time to process the signal An analog monitor wont need to
&gt; proces it as it will sync the electron gun to the signal in real time.
&gt; My projector supports refresh rates up to 80hz, but at the top end you
&gt; can see that your pushing the specifications to the limits, as the edges
&gt; of the pixels become a little ill-defined and bleed from one to the
&gt; next, or in some cases flicker a little. If you use 60hz, the picture is
&gt; far better defined. I can see how old lcds may only support one refresh
&gt; rate, but that would mean that you have to use the right one, rather
&gt; than it is irrelevant.

what about DLP?

I have seen artifacts in my projector (like if it is bumped) that would indicate that the DLP
technology is like a cross between CRT nad LCD technology.  It almost looks like it the image is
painted on the wall in a raster like fashion.  This is, of course, wrong.  But that is what it
looks like.

anyhoo - early morning rambling.
