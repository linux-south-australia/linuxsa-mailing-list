 From the article:

&gt; Then, last week, Lindows.com suddenly and unilaterally directed 
&gt; DesktopLinux.com to substitute a new agenda for the old one -- one 
&gt; that had not been discussed or reviewed with the Advisory Board. The 
&gt; agenda was a completely new one, with major changes such as 
&gt; substitution of Lindows.com CEO Michael Robertson for Open Source 
&gt; advocate Bruce Perens &lt;<A HREF="http://perens.com/&gt">http://perens.com/&gt</A>; in the conference welcome 
&gt; keynote slot.

Here is what Keven Carmony, President of Lindows.com said in response:

&gt; We had contracted with one of the employees of Desktoplinux.org (they 
&gt; only have a couple) to pay them to help out with organizing A FEW 
&gt; PARTS of the summit. Without going into great detail, let's just say 
&gt; this relationship ended up being unworkable. Due, perhaps from some 
&gt; bad communication on our part, this person became upset with some of 
&gt; the decisions being made about the summit. (We wanted a consumer, 
&gt; media-friendly event, not a technical, developer's conference.) Based 
&gt; on early misunderstandings, this person unfortunately had made 
&gt; promises to vendors without our final approval and had promised 
&gt; speaking slots. When the agenda came up for final approval (the first 
&gt; time Michael or I even saw it), we made changes to make it have more 
&gt; of a mass-market slant. The changes we made put this person in an 
&gt; awkward position with some people. We told this person that we would 
&gt; take full responsibility for the misunderstandings and to blame us if 
&gt; anyone was disappointed.
&gt;
&gt; In the end, it was simply a bad fit and this person was simply not the 
&gt; appropriate ambassador for the summit as we envisioned it. (It's hard 
&gt; to sell something you yourself don't believe in.) Therefore, we 
&gt; stopped contracting with this individual and used other people who 
&gt; LOVED the summit as we had planned it.
&gt;
&gt; As for this notion of "vendor neutrality," Lindows.com was NOT in 
&gt; anyway trying to turn the Summit into a "Lindows.com Show." Anyone who 
&gt; attended Wineconf or an MP3 Summit (both events also sponsored by 
&gt; Michael) know he's not like that. One look at the agenda and it's 
&gt; pretty obvious this is a show about how COOL LINUX IS ON THE DESKTOP, 
&gt; not about Lindows.com. Besides, Linux is so much more than distros. 
&gt; It's about office suites (Sun), applications (Kompany), printers (HP), 
&gt; tablets (StepUp), Games (Transgaming), hardware (Microtel), and on and 
&gt; on... Lindows.com doesn't even compete with 95% of the vendors at the 
&gt; show. We DO plead guilty that we VERY MUCH were making sure the summit 
&gt; stayed a show with MASS MARKET appeal, but the notion that we wanted 
&gt; to turn it into a Lindows.com show is simply ridiculous. (Go view the 
&gt; wineconf or 4 years of mp3 summit videos to see for yourself.)
&gt;
&gt; This is the sort of wacky "drama" that has plagued Linux for far too 
&gt; long and makes Microsoft laugh at Linux. Fortunately we, as we always 
&gt; do, will remain above this. The only reason I'm even making this post 
&gt; is because this thread asked for a response.
&gt;
&gt; To be clear, none of the paid sponsors have pulled out, and the demand 
&gt; is as great as ever. (They know that this is going to be a great event 
&gt; and want to make sure they're part of it!)
&gt;
&gt; We'll have a packed house and it's going to be a great show. If you 
&gt; look at the agenda &lt;<A HREF="http://www.desktoplinuxsummit.org/main/&gt">http://www.desktoplinuxsummit.org/main/&gt</A>;, you'll 
&gt; see it's the interesting, consumer-focused type of show Linux needs to 
&gt; start moving into the mainstream markets.
