&gt; &gt; &gt; not if when you bought it, you specified you wanted one for a
&gt; &gt; &gt; linux machine.  If you did, and it doesn't work in linux, then
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's not "fit for purpose" (trade practices act) and you can
&gt; &gt; &gt; return it (regardless of packaging etc).  But if you asked for
&gt; &gt; &gt; "a raid controller" then the above doesn't apply.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That assumes that the original poster is in the same 'trade practices'
&gt; &gt; collision domain that you are :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
&gt;
&gt; I'm not, but here in The Netherlands we have similar laws, however there
are
&gt; clauses which can allow a supplier to refuse it anyway, like when you
could
&gt; have known on beforehand (ie by reading the supplied info) that it was not
&gt; compatible...
&gt;
&gt; The problem is that they initially ordered a Promise card, but that was on
&gt; backorder for 7 weeks, and still no delivery commotment, so they searched
&gt; for another card!
&gt;
&gt; Ah well, we'll see...

OK,

I figured for the money I paid it was hardly more expensive than a normal
ATA100 card anyway, so I decided to go ahead.

I donwloaded the drivers for RedHat from the Highpoint site, did the new
kernel, copied it to boot, installed the module and did LILO.

After reboot the card was recognized, but nothing loaded, so I did:
insmod sd_mod
insmod hpt37x2

and voilá: /dev/sda @ 80 GB....    :-)

The only issue was that I couldn't follow their suggestions on replacing the
SCSI mod sense, so I tried made a slightly different approach...

I altered rc.sysinit so it includes, just before the software raid start the
following bit:
action $"Starting up SCSI support: " insmod scsi_mod
action $"Starting up SCSI harddisk support: " insmod sd_mod
action $"Starting up HPT37x2 devices: " insmod hpt37x2

This makes it look nice in the bootscreen and adds the output to dmesg, what
else can one wish?

So in all I am one happy puppy...
