Just in from Leon Brooks who put together the educational mini-conf as 
well as many other tasks associated with the conference.

Cheers,  Ian

 A penguin ambled out on-stage at the opening session, and
 then off again. After a few minutes, Rusty appeared with a
 penguin head under his arm. "Ha, ha" said everyone, very
 funny, Rusty wore a penguin suit, yay. Then when everyone
 was thoroughly disarmed, Linus came back on in his usual
 casual way, wearing the headless suit. It took a minute or
 two for the penny to drop for quite a few people, but the
 cheers came.

 [...]

 The PenguinMeister wrote a book, and called it "just for
 fun." He tells us that's the secret to getting him to come
 to a conference: make it easy for him to come, make it fun,
 have some real content (not just marketing). Not the forced-
 hilarity commercial kind of fun, but the laid-back, playful,
 amateur, spontaneous fun that characterises so much of open
 source. Computer-illiterates reading that sentence might
 think I've been staring at monitors for too long, but yes,
 computer software can be fun, and we had some (software and
 fun) at LCA2003.
