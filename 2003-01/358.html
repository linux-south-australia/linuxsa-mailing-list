I saw this on the USC Linux users group, and I thought someone might 
know something that I don't


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;An open inquiry, moderately related to Linux (simply because Linux is used
&gt;to run the machines).
&gt;
&gt;As a graduate student, I have found it necessary, at repeated intervals,
&gt;to justify just how "good" the cluster I built is in order to provide
&gt;datapoints for the people involved in acquiring additional funding for
&gt;our lab at USC.  Providing validation for an obviously good thing without a
&gt;specific marketing-bullet-point is cropping up as a weak point of mine
&gt;recently as I'm focusing more and more (exceptionally more) on my
&gt;research.
&gt;
&gt;The case in point is, I built a single system which currently provides
&gt;20 Athlon processors of clockspeed 1.4 GHz or above for my lab's usage at
&gt;an initial purchase cost of $20k.  We've already used this computational
&gt;cluster for well over 100,000 hours of processing time.  This equates to
&gt;a rate of, excluding electricity fees, less than $0.20/cpu-hour.
&gt;
&gt;I know that this is good.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone help me with links to current corporate or educational
&gt;facility cpu-hour rates that I can use to compare the "goodness" of
&gt;my achievement?  The only ones I can find are in the range of $40+/hour
&gt;or some other wierdness.
&gt;
&gt;A few years ago there were companies which charged cpu-hour rates
&gt;for general processing needs but I cannot seem to find links to these
&gt;companies anymore.  When attempting to provide valid comparison points
&gt;I find that I am many times forced to say, "Well, if we would have
&gt;bought a Sun 10000 with 64 processors it would have cost over a million
&gt;dollars even with academic discount to provide the same floating point
&gt;performance."  But that's arguably bullshit because what I've built is not
&gt;a shared-memory machine.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance.
