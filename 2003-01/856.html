&gt; Hiya,
&gt; 
&gt; Music's a huge part of my life - my biggest hobby is collecting music,
&gt; usually CD's when I can but mp3's[1] when I can't (afford them, heh!).
&gt; 
&gt; Even when I buy CD's, I always rip them to ogg/mp3 (lame with optimal
&gt; settings).  Quality is a *huge* thing for me.

Most people can't tell the difference between two mp3s created from the
same CD using different quality options. You still end up with the same
limitations you'd get from a CD. That's why I'm still recording onto
tape (4 track and reel-to-reel). You can kinda make up for it with a
little extra volume, but it's just not the same :-(

&gt; I don't know if its just me, but my SB Live! Value card has always sounded
&gt; like trash under any OS apart from Windows (I use xmms to play mp3's). 
&gt; Using Creative's drivers, or the kXmedia drivers (awesome 3rd party drivers
&gt; made by a russian dude) on Windows has always resulted in my mp3's through
&gt; winamp sounding so clarified its not funny.

I have my SB Live! card configured to use the ALSA drivers with the OSS
compatibility stuff. I can then configure XMMS to use either the OSS or
ESD output plugins.

&gt; FreeBSD's drivers sound bloddy horrible (unfortunately, one of the reasons
&gt; why I'm using Linux right now), and Linux is better, but still nowhere near
&gt; as good as Windows.  I've tried the emu10k1 drivers in the kernel, alsa's
&gt; drivers (which sounded worse, and the OSS emulation was terrible last time
&gt; I tried them), and today emu10k1 drivers from sourceforge, which was a step

Did you try the 0.5 alsa stuff, or the 0.9 stuff. I think that the
recommendation is to use the 0.9 series (even though it's not "stable").

&gt; up again, but it still doesn't sound right.  The sound's not clear - I mean,
&gt; its acceptable for most people, but its irritating the crap out of me *g*.

Can you describe the symptoms a little more? Does the same thing happen
when you convert an MP3 to a WAV file and play that using a player other
than XMMS? Did you test using the same MP3s under each OS?

&gt; Anybody else had experiences with this, and has suggestions on making the
&gt; card sound a whole lot better?

I'm using an SBLive! (the cheap one, I think) on Linux (both Mandrake
9.0 and Debian 3.0). My setup isn't all that complicated, but it does
involve a 4 track, a HiFi Amp, a Guitar amp and 6 guitars. TiMidity++
works fine, as does my collection of ogg vorbis and mp3 tracks (metal
mostly). Audacity, Sox and the other standard tools all seem to sound OK
too.

In fact, the gear that I'm using is a little too good. I'm actually
picking up a number of flaws in the guitar amp and stompboxes I'm using.
It's driving me nuts. :-)

Hope it helps,
Matt
