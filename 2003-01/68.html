&gt;&gt; Hmm, $1.5 million for ten 802.11b base stations, that's like $150,000

&gt; It is now assumed that by dividing the total budget by ten, we have
&gt; worked out the cost of each base station.  I'm sure the budget
&gt; encompasses a lot more than just the cost of each base station rolled 
&gt; up
&gt; into a neat figure.

I wasn't working out the cost of the base station. I was working out 
the cost of each base station installation, including all the local 
infrastructure, ongoing costs, and any other administrative overheads. 
At the end of the day, it still works out to $150,000 for ten access 
points, so I'm interested in how functional the access points are.

It could be that Ian isn't talking about standard base stations, but 
something like the Vivato's instead. Maybe the cost includes 
broadcasting licenses so the signal can be amplified. John Edwards also 
pointed out a few compelling cases for implementing wireless that would 
justify the additional cost.

I'm just curious.
