The Community Software (Distribution) Network will be holding a BBQ
&gt;followed by a meeting:
&gt;
&gt;  Date:   Saturday 1 February (2003)
&gt;  Time:   12 Noon SHARP
&gt;  Venue:
&gt;          131 St Bernards Rd
&gt;          Rostrevor SA 5073
&gt;  Bring:  Food and drinks
&gt;          (a chair would be useful)



 Sounds like fun.  Unfortunately will be in Melbourne that weekend (my
 anniversary even).  I have/am recently moving to
 Adelaide so don't really know anyone there.

 How often are these held?

 I am currently working in West Lakes, and actually do have a couple of
Linux
 type projects, both work and personal floating around it would seem.

 &gt; &gt;  Bring:  Food and drinks
 &gt; &gt;          (a chair would be useful)
 &gt; &gt;
 Hah, I do have a rollup foldup chair, thanks to the mother-in-law no less!
 :)

 On the work front though, linux areas of interest are :-

 1) Desktop - but lots of BASIC applications are used and more particularly
 DOS apps, so would have to be able to use that for the computer clueless
 (e.g. email can be hard, for them) - and generally speaking those are
 running 98/XP currently, in an NT backend enviroment (where everything
 currently works fine and dandy).  Microsoft licensing of course also
getting stupidly
ridiculous oto.

 2)  Mailserver - would like to give a linux mailserver a shot, and advice
on
 antivirus etc. type solutions would be appreciated here.    Probably would
 end up with the odd technical question too I imagine. :)

 Personally, I have a bunch of stuff written in ASP that uses SQL Server,
and
 as a hobby project, I'd like to convert that to something open source that
I
 know I can use and get cheap whenever I want it.  One tricky thing is have
a
 bunch of stored procedures written, and last time I looked MySQL did not
 support that?  Have not really delved into ASP for Apache at any stage.

 Seeing there is a fair bit of number crunching type stuff - have even
 considered making a flat file type database myself and writing whatever in

 C++, etc., to make it work.  Other option is to clone it to PHP/Perl/MySQL
 etc., but haven't made any decisions on either yet, really, but something
 that would happily work on multiple OSes with a bit of tinkering wouldn't
be
 bad either.

 Basically 2-3 databases with a bunch of statistics (basically sports
 related), and a couple of tables that will be approaching half a million
 records each sometime in the future.

 If I could end up with all this on a laptop so the open source version is
 portable, that would be cool too.

 If anyone with advice fancies a beer, happy to provide that too. :)

 Cheers,

 Richard
