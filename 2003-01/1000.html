&gt; &gt; &gt; Does this package still exist, or did it get obsoleted? It seems that it
&gt; &gt; &gt; hasn't been updated since 1998, and there seems to be no support for 2.4
&gt; &gt; &gt; kernels. Did its functionality get obsoleted by something else? I need
&gt; &gt; &gt; to run some sco binarys under linux. I did this once under redhat 5
&gt; &gt; &gt; quite successfully. Surely its still posible?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hmmm, wasn't SCO hiring some big lawyer to extract money from people like 
&gt; &gt; you?
&gt; 
&gt; especially now that they ship their own linux distribution ...

Were they? On what grounds? I'm talking about programs compiled by a
third party to run on sco, not actual OS binaries. I'm hoping to start a
new system afresh anyway, but I want to familiarize myself with the old
system at home first, and also explore the option of continuing to use
the old package under linux. I havn't seen any copyright notices on it,
so I thought I was within the law!
