&gt; Well, that was quick... maybe 10 minutes... Someone should write a
&gt; script to do that, and submit it to the debian people... maybe I'm
&gt; that someone... hmmm... Naaaah... :)

Here's my attempt at a script -- quick and dirty style...

----
#!/bin/bash

ON_DISK=/tmp/hddmd5s.$$
IN_DPKG=/tmp/dpkgmd5s.$$

cd /

/usr/bin/sort -k 2 /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.md5sums &gt; $IN_DPKG

for i in `/usr/bin/cut -f3 -d" " $IN_DPKG`; do /usr/bin/md5sum $i; done &gt; $ON_DISK

/usr/bin/diff $ON_DISK $IN_DPKG
----

Nothing special, no parameters, no help, no error catching, etc... run
it on your debian system at your own risk... :)

&gt; 
&gt; I did as you suggested, and it seems that the only differences are in
&gt; the following files:
&gt; 
&gt; /etc/pam.d/login
&gt; /etc/pam.d/passwd
&gt; /usr/lib/mime/packages/less
&gt; 
&gt; Having browsed these files, I can't see any obvious change or anything
&gt; that would indicate to me any issues with corruption -- hard-drive or
&gt; hacker-based.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a Good Thing (though I still don't know about files not in the
&gt; database -- specifically config files...)

&gt; &gt; You would think that there would be such a tool but I haven't been able 
&gt; &gt; to find anything after reading dpkg(1) and a few of dpkg-* utilities.  I can 
&gt; &gt; see that you are prepared to do a little work to make it happen.  One 
&gt; &gt; approach would be to collect the contents of 
&gt; &gt; /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGES.md3sums into one file and sort it on the second 
&gt; &gt; field.  Then create another using md5sum from the root directory.  Then do a 
&gt; &gt; diff on the two files.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Good luck,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any tool that anyone knows of that will enable me to see
&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly what has changed from the standard debian packages on my
&gt; &gt; &gt; machine? I want to know for two reasons -- to help document my
&gt; &gt; &gt; installation, and to help me identify and recover a few corrupted
&gt; &gt; &gt; files.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; One thought that I have is to create a subdirectory on a partition
&gt; &gt; &gt; with room, and basically re-install all my packages there and do a
&gt; &gt; &gt; recursive diff or something similar. However, I'd rather there was
&gt; &gt; &gt; something a little more sophisticated available. Another thought was
&gt; &gt; &gt; forcing a re-install of each and every package, but I have a feeling
&gt; &gt; &gt; that that may cause more problems than it solves -- I'd rather know
&gt; &gt; &gt; what differences existed so I could deal with each individually...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any comments?
