&gt; It does make me wonder weather what seems to be a conclusion will 
&gt; actually materialize. I honestly do not think so, unless there are 
&gt; significant improvements in people's experience with Linux.

1.  Statistics are only as reliable as their data.  Measuring M$ and 
Apple OS usage can be done (not extremely accurately) by examining sales 
records.  Those records do not allow for "dumped" outdated versions. 
 (if I buy XP and stop using NT4 I haven't changed my usage, just 
upgraded from one version of the OS to another), purchased but unused 
software, and other sources of inaccuracy,  but can provide some sort of 
guide.
How can one obtain any sort of accuracy allowing comparison with 
freely-available freely-copiable software?  
How would you treat dual-boot systems?

2. Translating poor stats directly into "people's experience" is 
completely impossible by any logical means.  Where is the data source to 
give credence to your claim?

This thread is littered with imagination masquerading as factual 
exposition.  How about we stick to fact, insofar as we know it?
