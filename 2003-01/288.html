This would probably be better said in the Whirlpool forums, but I don't
use them frequently, and this list is my home :-)  So I ask --


I don't want to start some sort of ADSL war here, but I figured all the
relevant people were on this list, so they'd be able to answer it.

For the many recent months that Internode and Adam Internet have been
offering ADSL services, I've always wanted to be able to directly host
my own domain, so I can run my low traffic personal website and collect
my own email etc.  But I can't do that efficiently, because I have a
dynamic IP.  I believe once in the past, Internode used to have such low
personal plan pricing because they said that the business plans absorbed
(somewhat) the costs of personal ADSL.  Now that the business to
personal plan pricing is much closer together and becoming more
realistic, what are the chances of additional services such as Static IP
addressing becoming cheap and easy?

At present, why are Adam Internet are able to offer a permanent IP
address on their personal plans for as little as $30 extra per month
while Internode can't? The plan pricing is relatively similar?  As a
loyal customer I'd not want to have to switch :-)

I'm really over the moon that Internode's plan costs recently came down
(or in fact, my plan went UP to meet the lower costs,) and I think that
ADSL Internet is becoming closer to the type of Internet access I used
to dream about as a young lad ;)

Looking forward to the day... :)
