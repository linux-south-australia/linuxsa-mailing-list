<H1>/boot/grub/stage2 file changes magically.. very weird! (LONG post!)</H1>

Hi everyone..

This problem has really got me baffled and I would appreciate any ideas.  It
all started 3 days ago when tripwire reported that /boot/grub/stage2 had
changed (in the overnight integrity check).  The file dates, file size,
permission were all identical.  Only the MD5 and CRC32 checksums were
different.  That was the only file that showed up as suspicious in the
tripwire report.  I thought it was incredibly unlikely that my system had
been rooted and only a boot file like stage2 had been modified or caught by
tripwire.

So I felt (and still do, given what has occurred since) that the system had
not been rooted as there was NO other evidence.  My log files, link traffic
reports, etc all looked normal and nothing else was picked up by tripwire.
Anyway, I decided to do a manual update of tripwire (tripwire -m c -I) to
stop it from reporting stage2 the next day and I decided to wait and see
what happened.

The following night the tripwire report was clean, but then the next night,
sure enough up comes /boot/grub/stage2 in the integrity report with a
changed MD5 and CRC32.  Now what I noticed was that the MD5 and CRC32
checksums had reverted back to what they were back 3 days ago.  So it
appeared the file had "changed back" to exactly what it was prior to 3 days
ago!  If I had not updated tripwire when it first reported the change, it
would not have reported it this time around as the file had reverted back to
it's original state, before tripwire first reported it, with it's original
MD5 and CRC32.  Very strange!!  To illustrate this, here is the output of
the tripwire MD5 and CRC32 lines for /boot/grub/stage2 the first time around
(not that these are the only 2 properties that tripwire reported to have
been changed):

Modified object name:  /boot/grub/stage2
Property:            Expected                    Observed
  -------------        -----------                 -----------
* CRC32                BezgOL                      A6zNgj
* MD5                  A1Xwm8sAFkK2LuEfUl4roR      AN6kUxus/JAmbV3XlUMp0B


And here it is 3 days later:
Modified object name:  /boot/grub/stage2
Property:            Expected                    Observed
  -------------        -----------                 -----------
* CRC32                A6zNgj                      BezgOL
* MD5                  AN6kUxus/JAmbV3XlUMp0B      A1Xwm8sAFkK2LuEfUl4roR

As you can see the MD5's and CRC32's swap around.  The file seems to be
alternating between two states.

At this point I decided to do some tests of my own using the cmp command.
Firstly I made a copy of the stage2 file in the state it was currently in
and verified that cmp reported no differences between it and the version
stored in /boot/grub/.  Then I waited.. 10 minutes later I rechecked the two
files with cmp, and the version of stage2 in /boot/grub had changed again..
yep, magically it had changed and now cmp was reporting differences between
the two files!  So now I had two ever so slightly different version.  The
output of cmp is reporting this:

stage2 /boot/grub/stage2 differ: char 536, line 5
   536  50  57
   537 150 147
   538 144 162
   539  60 165
   540  54 142
   541  60  57
   542  51 147
   543  57 162
   544 147 165
   545 162 142
   546 165  56
   547 142 143
   548  57 157
   549 147 156
   550 162 146
   551 165   0

Now I made a second copy of /boot/grub/stage2 in this state also, so now I
had both "states" of the file stored elsewhere so I could use them as
references.  Basically at random it appears the original /boot/grub/stage2
file changes from it's original state to the state above and then back
again.  There seems to be no pattern that I can establish to the change.  It
just happens.  Sometimes it won't change for a day, then it might change
within an hour.  What I have determined beyond reasonable doubt is that it
only ever alternates between these two states with no other variations to
the file.

Now for some technical specs:

The system is running Redhat 7.2 with a 2.4.18-18.7.xcustom kernel using
ext3 and software raid.  Now I am aware that there is a bug in the ext3 code
of this kernel version according to Redhat but it should only effect systems
that specifically mount with the data=journal option and only effects
filesystems when unmounted.  This is not the default mode and my ext3
filesystems are mounted with the default mode.  The errata documentation on
the Redhat site confirms my system should definitely not be vulnerable to
this bug and the symptoms don't match in either case.

The system runs mirrored IDE drives using the software raid built into
linux.  Is it possible the stage2 file has somehow ended up slightly
different on each of the mirrored drives? It would explain why the file
seems to alternate states.  Could the RAID system be alternating between the
versions on the two drives??  I know in theory this should never happen and
if it does, the system should resync the two drives.  Just a thought!

I did a lot of searching around on the net and the only thing I could come
up with is a news group post from somebody that interestingly enough
reported that stage2 had changed and was reported by tripwire (I thought I
had hit the jackpot solution).  The replies he got to his post suggested
vague RAM problems but I can't work out why the file changes and then
changes back again to it's original state?  One would think a RAM problem
would cause the file to change permanently, in a more random nature (but
perhaps someone will correct me on that point?).    Unfortunately this news
thread ended abruptly after only a few suggestions and no real solution was
posted other than "check your ram".  Because my system is running a
webserver, I don't particularly want to jump straight to having to pull the
thing offline to run memory testers if this turns out to be something other
than a RAM problem and from my experience, it seems like a very odd
incarnation of a memory issue.

The first time I touched linux was about 18 months ago and I have undergone
a huge learning curve since.  I love it and really enjoy using it but there
is still a lot of holes in my knowledge.  So any ideas as to what might be
causing this or how I could narrow it down further would be most
appreciated!

Many thanks,
Graham Smith
