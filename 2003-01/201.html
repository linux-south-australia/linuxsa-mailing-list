&gt; Bridging requires interfaces to be put in promiscuous mode, and transmit
&gt; packets with Ethernet source addresses.  Some interfaces (e.g.
&gt; wi(4)) do not support this functionality.  Also, bridging is not
&gt; compatible with interfaces which use hardware loopback, because there is
&gt; no way to tell locally generated packets from externally generated ones.
&gt; - --end snip--
&gt; 
&gt; My questions are thus:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Why o why wouldnt wi0 allow packets to be transmitted with ethernet
&gt; source addresses? I would imagine this could be VERY insecure, or
&gt; rapidly decrease available badwidth but that is my stab in the dark, and
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Could there be a way around this, ie everyone talks about bridging
&gt; wireless subnets, heck ive done it here, but as allways when you go to
&gt; tweak it, and RTFM you see the light :) Maybe some kind of static routing?
&gt; 
&gt; I have been able to (using wireless) bridge 2 lans using a freebsd bridge
&gt; on one side, but this was with a stand alone windows machine on the other side.
&gt; Might have been samba doing the hard work there tho. Routed is my friend.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments, abuse more than welcome :)

if think back to why bridging was used "in the old days";
- mixed media interfaces
- join together ethernet segments that were too long
- "we cant afford a router!"
- "its 1985 and we don't know what routing is yet!"

i think that if you are using bridging thatn you may need
to ask yourself why you are using it...

IIRR wiX does not support it because, at the time when the
driver was developed there was a lot of discussion on whether
or not it would be "a good thing" and the BSD guys are a 
bit ... odd like that, for different values of "good thing"!

anyhow, if you are using wireless then you might like to 
explore some of the other "seamless" routing arenas,
like MADHOC, mobilemesh or AODV.

AODV seems to be the most portable one about at the moment,
but obviously there is no support on hardware access points.

but as you seem to be using a BSD AP, then thats cool =)

i have used mobilemesh quite successfully, but its only
currenly available on linux.

anyhow, a decent setup with dhcpd, zebra/routed, dyndns
and maybe nocat should ease "seamless" networking issues.

cheers,

kim
