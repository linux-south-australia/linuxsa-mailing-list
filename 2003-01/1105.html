"Long hours at computer 'deadly'

29jan03

THE next time your boss asks you to put in a few extra hours at your
desk - remind him it could be deadly.

New Zealand researchers have found that sitting at a computer for hours
on end can cause fatal blood clots, just as long flights can lead to
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), known as economy-class syndrome. 

They discovered the link when a 32-year-old man who sat at his computer
terminal for up to 18 hours a day nearly died after he developed a blood
clot in his leg which travelled to his lungs. 

"This is the first reported case of an association between repeated
prolonged immobility sitting at a computer and life-threatening (lung
embolism)," wrote the researchers led by Richard Beasley from the
Wellington-based Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. 

They suggest the condition be called "e-thrombosis".
