&gt; &gt; Have you tried using ALSA 0.9 and messing with the ALSA mixer?
&gt; &gt; I'm using 0.9.0rc3 (apparently rc2 doesn't work well with the emu10k1)
&gt; &gt; with the SB Audigy and it sounds pretty good to me.
&gt; &gt; I have had quality problems before and found that tweaking with the alsa
&gt; &gt; mixer made a LOT of difference.  Make sure everything you're not using is
&gt; &gt; muted.
&gt;
&gt; I'll try this today, I think I tried an earlier ALSA with no luck.
&gt;
&gt; What's the OSS compatibility like?  In particular, do you play games at
&gt; all? Wondering how compatible it is with WineX, and Quake3, UT, etc.

I've subscribed to wineX a couple of times before to get their RPM downloads.
Have played Q3 demo, UT2003 demo very recently, and the sound quality has been 
quite good.  I haven't played these games on windows so I cant compare the 
quality.  But UT2003 definitely sounds great under linux, no distortion (I 
have Creative SoundWorks DTT2500 Digital 5.1 speakers).

Games running under Wine/WineX tend to suffer in sound quality a little.  I 
haven't had a lot of success with getting games to work under WineX so I cant 
really comment on it.

I use XMMS regularly (using the OSS driver) and it works perfectly.  I haven't 
used the equaliser in XMMS though.

Another thing to note is that I'm using the Analog outputs on the Audigy (the 
digital ones aren't supported yet), so you may come across differences.  
Also, the mixer program I used is called 'gamix'.  Its basically a gtk 
interface to the alsamixer and is easier to use than the one that comes with 
alsa.

Hope you get it sorted out.

-Steve.
