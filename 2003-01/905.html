&gt; In the recent past I have tried to record the Palo Alto City Council 
&gt; meetings in Linux, but found it a bit frustrating.
&gt;
&gt; Up to today, all I had been able to do was record 12 MB of silence.
&gt;
&gt; But for some reason, it worked for me today.
&gt;
&gt; All I did was use the command line from this post:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2002-04/803.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2002-04/803.html</A>
&gt;
&gt; sox -c 2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track&lt;nn&gt;.wav
&gt;
&gt; [literal]
&gt;
&gt; sox -c 2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track1.wav
&gt;
&gt; to pick up some audio from:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://kzsulive.stanford.edu/">http://kzsulive.stanford.edu/</A>
&gt;
&gt; However, you don't have to go there...
&gt;
&gt; You can create a text file and call it
&gt;
&gt; kzsu-1.ram
&gt;
&gt; The contents should read:
&gt;
&gt; rtsp://171.66.118.60/encoder/kzsu-1.rm
&gt;
&gt; That's it. You can open it up with the real player, or whatever you 
&gt; prefer.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ***************************************************************
&gt;
&gt; Real Audio Batch Files
&gt;
&gt; While learning about Linux and sound I decided to do some testing with 
&gt; USC's band songs.
&gt;
&gt; I saved 22 .ram files and then played them. I was kind of disappointed 
&gt; that the songs did not play as the band played them while I was there...
&gt;
&gt; That is they would play songs 1,2,3 and 22 consecutively without 
&gt; pause. I opened up the .ram file with emacs and saw this:
&gt;
&gt; rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/01.rm
&gt;
&gt; So I edited it to read like so:
&gt;
&gt; rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/01.rm
&gt; rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/02.rm
&gt; rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/03.rm
&gt; rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/22.rm
&gt;
&gt; Ahh... that's better.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Now I thought...
&gt;
&gt; Its had been a bit disappointing that the Real One Player for Linux 
&gt; doesn't seem to be able to play an entire cd as the Windows version 
&gt; could...
&gt;
&gt; But what if I did the same thing with my cd's?  I already had a copy 
&gt; of my Linkin Park CD on my shared storage hard disk, previously 
&gt; recorded in Windows.
&gt;
&gt; All I had to do was create a .ram file with contents....
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="file:/windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/01_-_Papercut_-_Linkin_Park.rmj">file:/windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/01_-_Papercut_-_Linkin_Park.rmj</A> 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ....and edit the .rmj files to not include any empty spaces....(note 
&gt; the underscores!)
&gt;
&gt; Instead of editing the list tediously, I changed directories to where 
&gt; my songs are:
&gt;
&gt; cd /windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/
&gt;
&gt; Then ran ls -l
&gt;
&gt; Copied the contents of the shell by highlighting it first and then using:
&gt;
&gt; CTL-C
&gt;
&gt; I then opened up kwrite and edited the .ram file and pasted the 
&gt; contents of the output, and then set them in place.
&gt;
&gt; It will play the songs I include in the .ram file in a sequence.
&gt;
I forgot:

To get the playlist to repeat, make sure that the last line in the .ram 
file is the name of the .ram file itself.

Example:

<A HREF="file:/windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/01_-_Papercut_-_Linkin_Park.rmj">file:/windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/01_-_Papercut_-_Linkin_Park.rmj</A>
<A HREF="file:/home/james/linkin.ram">file:/home/james/linkin.ram</A>

Hope this helps!

James Leone
