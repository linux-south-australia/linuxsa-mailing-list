For those who have been keeping up with the SCO IP stuff on slashdot,
this may provide an interesting read.

&gt; Subject: SCO News: SCO Establishes SCOsource to License UNIX Intellectual Property
&gt; Date: 23 Jan 2003 18:42:21 +1100
&gt; 
&gt; Good afternoon,
&gt; In an effort to keep you informed of new offerings and services provided
&gt; by SCO, we would like to inform you of a business division, announced
&gt; today, within SCO called SCOsource which will manage the licensing of
&gt; its UNIX intellectual property. SCOsource will manage the substantial
&gt; UNIX intellectual property assets owned by SCO, and will operate an
&gt; array of licensing programs.
&gt; 
&gt; Key components of this announcement include:
&gt; *  The creation of SCOsource, a division of SCO that will expand the
&gt; licensing of the company's core intellectual property, including the
&gt; core UNIX source code.
&gt; *  The first offering from SCOsource will be SCO System V for Linux-an
&gt; end-user licensed product for use on Linux systems. SCO System V for
&gt; Linux provides unbundled licensing of SCO's UNIX System shared libraries
&gt; for use with UNIX applications, enabling them to run on Linux.
&gt; *  The appointment of David Boies and the law firm of Boies, Schiller
&gt; and Flexner to help research and advise SCO on the company's
&gt; intellectual property.
&gt; 
&gt; ** SCOsource **
&gt; SCO's patents, copyrights and core technology date back to 1969 when
&gt; Bell Laboratories created the original UNIX source code. SCOsource will
&gt; manage the licensing of this software technology to customers and
&gt; vendors.
&gt; 
&gt; "SCO is the developer and owner of SCO UnixWare and SCO OpenServer, both
&gt; based on UNIX System V technology," said Darl McBride, president and
&gt; CEO, The SCO Group. "SCO owns much of the core UNIX intellectual
&gt; property, and has full rights to license this technology and enforce the
&gt; associated patents and copyrights. SCO is frequently approached by
&gt; software and hardware vendors and customers who want to gain access to
&gt; key pieces of UNIX technology. SCOsource will expand our licensing
&gt; activities, offering partners and customers new ways to take advantage
&gt; of these technologies."
&gt; 
&gt; ** SCO System V for Linux **
&gt; The SCO System V for Linux license will provide access to SCO's UNIX
&gt; System Shared Libraries for use with Linux. Customers frequently use
&gt; SCO's shared libraries to allow UNIX applications to run on Linux. In
&gt; the past, SCO's UnixWare and OpenServer license agreements did not allow
&gt; these UNIX libraries to be used outside of SCO's operating systems. With
&gt; this announcement, customers can now license these libraries from SCO
&gt; for use with Linux without having to license the entire SCO operating
&gt; system. This will enable customers to now run thousands of UNIX
&gt; applications on Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; "The most substantial intellectual property in UNIX comes from SCO,"
&gt; said Chris Sontag, Senior Vice President for Operating Systems and
&gt; SCOsource, The SCO Group. "While Linux is an Open Source product, it
&gt; shares philosophy, architecture and APIs with UNIX. Starting today,
&gt; SCO's libraries will be available to third-party application developers,
&gt; OS vendors, hardware providers, services vendors, and end-users. SCO
&gt; will help customers legitimately combine Linux and UNIX technology to
&gt; run thousands of UNIX applications. SCOsource plans to create other new
&gt; licensing programs to make our rich inventory of UNIX System technology
&gt; available to the market."
&gt; 
&gt; SCO will offer SCO System V for Linux for $149 per CPU. Volume licensing
&gt; discounts will also be available to enterprise customers and OEMs.
&gt; 
&gt; SCO is offering customers of SCO Linux Server 4.0 a license to SCO
&gt; System V for Linux as a free value-add to their use of SCO Linux. Future
&gt; updates to SCO Linux Server will include a license to SCO System V for
&gt; Linux.
