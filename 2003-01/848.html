&gt; OK,
&gt; Who would like to organise one of these?  Sounds like fun.

&gt; Would there be anyone interested in attending something like this?

&gt; AUUG are planning to hold a security symposium in Adelaide this year.

I should hasten to add that the AUUG security symposium will be
nothing like what that URL describes.  We're off to a rather slow
start, and I'd actively solicit volunteers.  Take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au/events/security.html">http://www.auug.org.au/events/security.html</A> for an idea of what we're
planning.

At the moment, I'd like to ask for people prepared to help with the
organization.  Our business manager, Liz Carroll, will do the
nitty-gritty work, but she's in Sydney, and we need people locally.

Specifically, we need to find:

1.  A venue.
2.  A date.  The board has decided that it should be in May, but it
    will require local knowledge to decide when in May.  It's a three
    day event held during the week.
3.  Presenters.  Who has something interesting to say about
    security-related topics?  That's the job of the programme
    committee.
4.  Attendees.  This is the kind of event which costs a fair amount of
    money, but one which employers should be prepared to pay for.

Interested?  Please reply to this message and we'll see what we can
put together.

Greg
