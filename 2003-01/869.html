&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Pity that government is a monopoly :-(
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;But you get to choose them, don't you?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;In the absence of a smiley, I can only assume that you actually believe 
&gt; &gt;&gt;that. I am shocked.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;He obviously meant *help* choose them, which is true in Australia as well
&gt; &gt;as USA.  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; When I was still in college, I used to follow U.S. politics fairly 
&gt; heavily.  I don't things have changed much in the last 5 years, but the 
&gt; only candidates that ever get elected are either part of the Democrat or 
&gt; Republican parties.  It really is like a monopoly, ologopoly I think 
&gt; they call it. Most of the news and even classroom instruction seems to 
&gt; enfore the idea of Demorat v Republican.
&gt; 
&gt; I do know this, in 1991 when I really watched the campaigns, the 
&gt; following individuals had their names on the ballots in all 50 states:
&gt; 
&gt; Milora Fullani (New Alliance Party)
&gt; Ross Perot (Independant - became Reform Party ala Jesse Ventura)
&gt; George Bush Sr. (Republican)
&gt; Bill Clinton (Democrat)
&gt; Andre Marrou (Libertarian)
&gt; 
&gt; However, only Bush, Perot and Clinton were invited to participate in the 
&gt; Nationally televised debates.
&gt; 
&gt; It takes way too long to be able to vote in the U.S. if you move over 
&gt; from another country. The owner of my company is Canadian and it seemed 
&gt; to take a while before he got his citizenship, and with it the ability 
&gt; to vote in the U.S.
&gt; 
&gt; You put these factors together, I can see why it feels like a monopoly!
&gt;

Same sort of thing in the UK: you've got the "choice" of Tories,
Labour, or a bunch of small-timers it's not worth voting for because
they'll never get in anyway. So we had the Tories for several terms
even though everyone hated Thatcher, because Labour looked like a
bunch of headless chickens; then Labour finally got their act
together, people voted them in with relief that they didn't have to
have the Tories anymore... and they carried on doing exactly the same
sort of things that the Tories were doing. In fact they're so Tory
that the Tories aren't really an Opposition, more a
Quibbler-round-the-edges. Some choice.

The good thing about the British regime is not the so-called "choice"
but the results of our centuries-old tradition of not taking shit from
our rulers, so that people can blockade refineries in protest about
petrol prices and not get shot. This tradition seems to have been
exported pretty well to Australia. Not so well to America, where a lot
of the population were refugees from a tradition of being shat on by
their rulers all the time and not getting any effective opposition
together.

People get the sort of rulers they allow themselves to have; the idea
that you can forcibly convert a country to a more liberal system of
government by external military pressure is pretty well bound to fail
in the long run - or not so long.
