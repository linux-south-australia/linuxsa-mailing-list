&gt;&gt;"The most substantial intellectual property in UNIX comes from SCO,"
&gt;&gt;said Chris Sontag, Senior Vice President for Operating Systems and
&gt;&gt;SCOsource, The SCO Group. "While Linux is an Open Source product, it
&gt;&gt;shares philosophy, architecture and APIs with UNIX. Starting today,
&gt;&gt;SCO's libraries will be available to third-party application developers,
&gt;&gt;OS vendors, hardware providers, services vendors, and end-users. SCO
&gt;&gt;will help customers legitimately combine Linux and UNIX technology to
&gt;&gt;run thousands of UNIX applications. SCOsource plans to create other new
&gt;&gt;licensing programs to make our rich inventory of UNIX System technology
&gt;&gt;available to the market."

That's just beautiful:  they're offering SCO software which will
be used mainly to help people migrate away from SCO.

REPLACING THE SCO BOX:  A GUIDE FOR APPLICATION VENDORS WHO WISH TO
MIGRATE TO LINUX
Step 1:  Install apps on a Linux box with all the SCO apps running under
          emulation.
Step 2:  Begin the process of migrating apps to native-Linux.  This can
          be done on a module-by-module basis;  non-migrated modules can
          continue to run under emulation.
Step 3:  ???
Step 4:  Profit!

Sure, the libraries will have other uses (e.g., they'll help people to
run legacy apps for which no source code exists on a more modern
platform), but their most substantial use will surely be to assist
application devlopers in the process of migrating away from a SCO
solution.  The press-release even says as much, by pitching the
libraries at developers.

Call me crazy, but it seems to me that SCO have had absolutely no
idea about how to cope with Linux ever since it started to make
corporate inroads.  I'm sure they think this is all a very clever
move, but I can't see how it's going to be a good thing for them.

My gut feeling is that SCOsource will initially serve to license
SCO products like this one, but in the long term it's main role will
be to find examples of open-source operating systems violating
SCO-owned UNIX patents, and find ways to prosecute them.  SCO will
be the 21st century equivalent to Unisys.
