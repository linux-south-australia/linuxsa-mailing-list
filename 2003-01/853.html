Hiya,

Music's a huge part of my life - my biggest hobby is collecting music,
usually CD's when I can but mp3's[1] when I can't (afford them, heh!).

Even when I buy CD's, I always rip them to ogg/mp3 (lame with optimal
settings).  Quality is a *huge* thing for me.

I don't know if its just me, but my SB Live! Value card has always sounded
like trash under any OS apart from Windows (I use xmms to play mp3's). 
Using Creative's drivers, or the kXmedia drivers (awesome 3rd party drivers
made by a russian dude) on Windows has always resulted in my mp3's through
winamp sounding so clarified its not funny.

FreeBSD's drivers sound bloddy horrible (unfortunately, one of the reasons
why I'm using Linux right now), and Linux is better, but still nowhere near
as good as Windows.  I've tried the emu10k1 drivers in the kernel, alsa's
drivers (which sounded worse, and the OSS emulation was terrible last time
I tried them), and today emu10k1 drivers from sourceforge, which was a step
up again, but it still doesn't sound right.  The sound's not clear - I mean,
its acceptable for most people, but its irritating the crap out of me *g*.

Anybody else had experiences with this, and has suggestions on making the
card sound a whole lot better?

always looking for people with simular (warped) music tastes to trade music
with :-)
