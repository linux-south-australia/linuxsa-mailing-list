Hi Guys / Gals

Maybe this question should be directed to a BSD mailing list, not too sure
if the same man appears in your favourite flavor of nix. There
are some smart people out there who might be able to give me the answer..

ref: man bridge

- --snip--
Bridging requires interfaces to be put in promiscuous mode, and transmit
packets with Ethernet source addresses.  Some interfaces (e.g.
wi(4)) do not support this functionality.  Also, bridging is not
compatible with interfaces which use hardware loopback, because there is
no way to tell locally generated packets from externally generated ones.
- --end snip--

My questions are thus:

1. Why o why wouldnt wi0 allow packets to be transmitted with ethernet
source addresses? I would imagine this could be VERY insecure, or
rapidly decrease available badwidth but that is my stab in the dark, and

2. Could there be a way around this, ie everyone talks about bridging
wireless subnets, heck ive done it here, but as allways when you go to
tweak it, and RTFM you see the light :) Maybe some kind of static routing?

I have been able to (using wireless) bridge 2 lans using a freebsd bridge
on one side, but this was with a stand alone windows machine on the other side.
Might have been samba doing the hard work there tho. Routed is my friend.

Any comments, abuse more than welcome :)

Cheers,

Drew
