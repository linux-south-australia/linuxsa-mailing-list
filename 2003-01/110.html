&gt; I was thinking the AP's could go on top of the building. If it got to 
&gt; the stage of building towers, then paying for a Telstra link would be 
&gt; more of an option. An extra $100,000 buys a lot of Telstra link - 
&gt; especially if the PAPL option is still lurking.

An AP ontop of a building:

a) won't have a great deal of range - maybe a few hundred meters - you need 
a good height for distance (look up freznel zone).
b) won't allow you to communicate to another AP (you need a wireless bridge 
for that).

If you run links via a telco then $100k is going to get used up pretty 
quick.

&gt; 
&gt; I also wouldn't run low loss antenna cabling, since it'd be cheaper to 
&gt; run an Ethernet link (fibre if necessary) up to the roof then place the 
&gt; AP local to the dish. This is presuming the wireless is only for 
&gt; connecting the buildings together.

Umm, much of a muchness.  Fibre's not cheap.  Probably more than low loss.
(termination costs mostly)

&gt; 
&gt; It would be worth considering an AP for the roof, and an AP for the 
&gt; class to avoid some wiring, but I'm not a big fan of wireless for 
&gt; internal use seeing as local activity (eg, printing a large graphics 
&gt; heavy file) can saturate bandwidth.

&gt; &gt; I think you're underestimating the cost of a lot of this and discounting
&gt; &gt; the costs that are really there.
&gt; 
&gt; I have left a few things out, but I think the physical costing is in 
&gt; the ballpark. I don't know if Ian's $150k per site was for physical or 
&gt; for the entire show.

I think so.
