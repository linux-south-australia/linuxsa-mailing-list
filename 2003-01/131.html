<H1>problem with pppd on redhat 7.3 and 8</H1>

Hi all,

Got a question, running a couple of linux servers one is redhat 8 the other
is redhat 7.3, using the latest kernels available from Redhat via RPM, both
these machines dial to the internet using wvdial and pppd, I have a problem
with both of them.

This seems to be something which has happend with later kernel releases, ie.
the 8 box did it right from install, the 7.3 box did it only after a kernel
upgrade.

When the modem goes to connect it will connect just fine but what concerns
me is what is the bottom line below:

Jan  5 14:32:35 ae-gw pppd[19223]: pppd 2.4.1 started by root, uid 0
Jan  5 14:32:35 ae-gw pppd[19223]: Using interface ppp0
Jan  5 14:32:35 ae-gw pppd[19223]: Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; /dev/ttyS0
Jan  5 14:32:35 ae-gw /etc/hotplug/net.agent: assuming ppp0 is already up
Jan  5 14:32:39 ae-gw modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module
ppp-compress-21

I have searched the net for solutions to this and the only one I can find is
to put this:

alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp

into modules.conf, I tried that it does SFA, i.e. it doesnt fix the problem,
now an older 7.2 box which I have not upgraded the kernel on does this:

Dec 29 23:19:14 wac-gw kernel: PPP generic driver version 2.4.1
Dec 29 23:19:14 wac-gw pppd[897]: pppd 2.4.0 started by root, uid 0
Dec 29 23:19:14 wac-gw pppd[897]: Using interface ppp0
Dec 29 23:19:14 wac-gw pppd[897]: Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; /dev/ttyS1
Dec 29 23:19:16 wac-gw kernel: PPP BSD Compression module registered
Dec 29 23:19:16 wac-gw kernel: PPP Deflate Compression module registered

which to me looks nice, and correct.... my question is, why is the 8 box
doing this and why is the 7.3 box doing this after a kernel upgrade???? and
how do I fix it.

By kernel upgrade I mean I downloaded the kernel via Redhat network as an
RPM then used RPM to upgrade it.

In terms of the 7.3 box, I don't think its a unique problem because I
actually had this happen on 2 separate 7.3 boxen after a kernel upgrade...
which leads me to believe that Redhat has borked something in their RPMised
Kernels, anyone else come across this on their 7.3/8 boxen?
