&gt; I guess this means that if you want to avoid TCPA, then you can choose

&gt; using the OS that we know and love.

You might have a choice.  The old ISA architecture really was quite
terrible, and so IBM 'invented' MCA which really did make PCs faster.
Unfortunately MCA was patented (even to IBM's surprise) and most
manufacturers were unwilling to pay the royalties.  The industry responded
by designing EISA, which was entirely as complicated as MCA but a heck
of a lot cheaper.  With speed and cost both on the side of EISA, why
don't we use it today?  Too complicated, hence consumer disinterest.
That's probably why we have PCI today, and thus it all turned out okay.

TCPA might be like MCA and EISA: too expensive and/or too complicated.
