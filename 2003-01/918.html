The biggest PITA has been setting up ALSA.  Next issue has been spontaneous 
change in operation, such as output swapping between jacks and loss of LHS 
channel - which came good today, so I don't have a dud card after all.  (More 
about this in another post).

As for sound quality: I'm still not certain if its the drivers or the 
applications, but to my untrained ears the top end of the spectrum is poor.  
Sounds which should be "ssss" are more like "choof", this shows up in lyrics 
containing words with emphsis on the letter S and instruments like cymbals.

&gt; &gt; Until today I though that I was the only sucker having problems with this
&gt; &gt; stupid card.  My original criteria for choosing this (Windows) hardware
&gt; &gt; was that "Creative" has a good reputation for driver support in Linux for
&gt; &gt; the classic SB cards.
&gt;
&gt; Can either of you describe the sorts of quality problems you're having?
&gt; Tinny? Muffled? Sound breaks up on lower end of the spectrum? Higher
&gt; level of distortion? Sounds like it's underwater? You can't hear the
&gt; sound over the deafening crackle of burning copper?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; A little later I discovered that the left channel is not producing any
&gt; &gt; output.  That's the last straw!  Now I've got an excuse to buy something
&gt; &gt; which works with Linux.  Endorsements or recommendations by LinuxSA
&gt; &gt; members would be much appreciated at this stage.
&gt;
&gt; I've had some luck with the SBLive! card. Perhaps one of those would
&gt; suit? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Don't know whether you've seen this site - I hadn't, but it seems OK.
