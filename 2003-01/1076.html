This particular Microsoft patch was a pr*ck to install, even by their
normal standards.  There's been no shortage of complaints about this
in various related mlists.

&gt; From K Styles:
&gt; "Just as well the T(H)elstra Engineers who are responsible for their
&gt; servers, weren't working for me. They would have been given their
&gt; marching orders for their incompetence.. A failure to maintain server
&gt; software with all the security patches from M$oft is irresponsible and
&gt; demonstrates an indifference to their employer and their customers,
&gt; which is totally unacceptable."

This is pretty short sighted on several accounts.

1)  Sometimes it's hard to get an outage on a server to apply
    a patch, let alone test one (I once nearly had to wait for
    four weeks to get an outage on a Unix box to reboot it, but
    luckily the problem it was suffering from took care of that
    for me).  In an ideal world, there would be a test server
    that mirrors the setup of the production server, but ideal
    worlds are few and far between, and patching will sometimes
    break existing functionality (the flip side of the coin).
2)  Part of the problem is that MSSQL is installed as part of
    a product, and the consumer is none the wiser.  When I
    scanned my father-in-law's machine while it was dialled
    into the 'net (with his permission), not only did I find
    MSSQL installed as part of a CRM package that he'd installed,
    but the default DBA admin account had no password (which is
    how it's installed by default).  I could connect and view
    tables just fine, and I'm fairly certain I could have dropped
    them without any problems.  *Nowhere* in the documentation
    was it mentioned that it was running MSSQL, let alone that it
    needed to be locked down.

&gt; Where are all the Linux folks and MySQL users yelling out how the worm
&gt; didn't affect them?

"There but for the grace of God ..."

MySQL, Postgresql and Oracle have had their own buffer overflow problems.
