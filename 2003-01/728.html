&gt; I'm not sure how robust the heartbeat software for Linux is.

I think it's as robust as it can be, given the circumstances.
Between two servers, it's pretty difficult to detect whether the
far end server has gone down, or just your mechanism of detecting
it has (e.g. failure of the local serial port or NIC that the
heartbeat goes across).  HP's ServiceGuard training actually like
to have a quorum of servers (which means having more than two,
and preferably not an even number).  If you were to get a failure
that causes partitioning (e.g. hub splits network in half), then
you still need a majority of servers to say "I'm alive!", and
you can't do that with just two servers.

As usual, it's a simple problem statement - "Let's have redundancy!" -
with lots of tradeoff and potential ramifications (and cost!).

&gt;&gt; A further option (which is out of our budget) would be to use an array
&gt;&gt; of scsi disks on a controller that could be plugged into the secondary
&gt;&gt; machine should the primary machine die.

&gt; That be a real bitch if the server crashed at half-passed four in the
&gt; morning.

You can have multiple controllers plugged into the same set of SCSI
disks (using them concurrently is a different matter).  Most JBODs
I've seen support this.
