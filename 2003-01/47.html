Ok, so I got sick of whining, and decided to go out and do something.  I
still hope that things are better than I fear that they might. Ok,
enough of that.


I have a list of applications that I am hunting down Linux replacements
for.
As of yesterday, I was down to nine, but as of now,  we have a good
chance to be down to eight. :-)


The program is timesheet.php.

<A HREF="http://www.stratlink.com.au/timesheet/">http://www.stratlink.com.au/timesheet/</A>

This is how you set it up if you are interested:


Necessary Software:

1. L  inux
2. A  pache
3. M  ysql
4. P  HP (mod_php4) (Even if you have installed PHP, you still need
mod_php4 from RPMfind.net)

(LAMP)

5. Timesheet.php
6. Webmin helped, but was not essential.

*************************************************************************************************************************

How you set it up:

A. Install all 4 components of (LAMP) &lt;b&gt;Don't forget mod_php!&lt;/b&gt;


B. Set the MySQL Password

         When you set up timesheet.php later on, it will ask you for the
administrator's name and password, so lets get it out of the way now,
so there are no surprises.

         The first obsticle is figuring out how to log into Mysql.

         If you installed MySQL from an RPM and not source, it will
install with a blank user name and password.
         When I was first asked to provide the user name and password for
MySQL, I knew I hadn't provided one, so as I do with Webmin and Swat,
         I logged in as root and used my root password. That is secure,
and it makes sense.

         But for Mysql, bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!

         Wrong answer.

         Instead, just run this command at the prompt:

         mysqladmin -u root password the_password_you_choose

         Just, as an example:  lets say I decide I want to use "OPENup"
as a password....I would then type the following at the shell:

         mysqladmin -u root password OPENup

         You are done with MySQL! :-)


C. Edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

         You will need to have this line included in the httpd.conf <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

         Addtype application/x-httpd-php .php
         I simply placed it at the end. placed them at the end.

         I will note that installing mod_php-4.0.6-3.2mdk.rpm added these
lines to httpd.conf and also installed libphp4.so in the extramodules
subdirectory:

                 &lt;IfDefine HAVE_PHP4&gt;
                 LoadModule php4_module    extramodules/libphp4.so
                 &lt;/IfDefine&gt;
         I saw in another thread, that it was a problem if those lines,
or the file were missing.

         I also had to comment out three lines from httpd.conf:

         # &lt;IfDefine HAVE_PHP4&gt;
         #AddModule mod_php4.c
         #&lt;/IfDefine&gt;   (The .c raised an error)


D. Set up timesheet.php

     Download the program from:
      <A HREF="http://www.stratlink.com.au/timesheet/timesheet_1.1.6.tar.gz">http://www.stratlink.com.au/timesheet/timesheet_1.1.6.tar.gz</A>
      Put it in your home directory
      type this:
                         gzip -dc timesheet_1.1.6.tar.gz  | tar xvf -
                         cd timesheet_1.1.6
                          su (supply password)
                           mkdir /srv/www/htdocs/timesheet (SuSE 8.1)
                            mkdir /var/www/html/timesheet (Mandrake 9.0)
                             sh install.sh

                             When asked what the MySQL Administrator name
is, use root, and OPENup, if you were silly enough to follow the example
to the letter....
                             When asked supply a password for the
timesheet administrator
                             When asked, just stick with his suggestion
and use timesheet_
                             When asked the full path is

/var/www/html/timesheet (Mandrake 9.0)


E. Use it:

         Restart Apache and Mysql
         Go to a web browser and point it to:

           <A HREF="http://localhost/timesheet/">http://localhost/timesheet/</A>

             You should be prompted for a log in at this point.


Good luck and hope that this helps!
