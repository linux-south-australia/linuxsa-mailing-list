&gt; So for zero benefit you are saying we should forget about trying to
&gt; achieve any breaking of the digital divide as it is something that Linux
&gt; cant do but Windows does well?
&gt; 
&gt; For the last 6 months we have not had any porn episodes. Obviously I
&gt; should just keep patching the crappy W2K system and leave Linux to
&gt; "safer" venues.

That's a nice spin you've put on that. :-)

I've tried to ignore this thread, as it doesn't seem to have gotten
anywhere, but I think that some of the participants of this discussion
appear to be missing some of the points being made by others.

As David has mentioned, whilst you haven't had any problems with your
current setup, it doesn't mean that it's a good solution. It's just that
nobody's been caught subverting security yet. As Mark and David have
said, any Linux solution you put in will have the same flaws. Some may
even be more flawed.

So, if the only reason you're considering Linux is because you think it
might have some magic algorithm for working out what is porn and what is
not, I'm afraid you're out of luck (at this stage). If there are other
reasons (such as ongoing licensing costs, etc, etc) then Linux is
probably going to be a better solution than the Windows one.

I hope that this clears things up a little.

Matt
