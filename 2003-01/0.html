Ian,

&gt; "Poor PC access may stifle kids: report
&gt; 
&gt; Children from disadvantaged backgrounds were at risk
&gt; of falling behind at school and in the workforce due
&gt; to poor access to technology, a new report has found.
&gt;  Access to computers and the internet was critical to
&gt; ensuring a young person's success at school, according
&gt; to The New Economy Revisited - a report compiled by 
&gt; The Smith Family charity.

I would totally agree; organisations such as ComputerBank realise this
and are attempting to address this divide now. 

Companies such as Microbits are starting to invest research dollars into
developing an appropriate desktop OEM Linux solution to put onto less
expensive hardware so that the end user didn't have to pay not only the
extra money for the OS licence but also the extra money to get the CPU
to even run the OS.
