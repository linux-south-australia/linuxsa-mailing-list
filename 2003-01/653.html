Richard,

&gt; Can anyone tell me how certain I can be that post-fsck, my ext3
&gt; filesystems will be no more corrupted than what I find in my
&gt; lost+found?

Unfortunately I can't tell you for certain, but then again I doubt even
the ext3 architects would be willing to guarantee that unless they had a
fat insurance policy.

&gt; ie is there any other corruption likely that would cause
&gt; no evidence to be seen?

It's a journalling file system so to perform a recovery you'd have to:

1) replay the journal
2) run fsck (if you had to)

If you do (2) before (1) you can really clobber things. Some journalling
filesystem's fsck's will silently do (1) before (2) EVEN IF you do (2)
without (1) and others will let you stuff up silently. 

&gt; no way of finding out -- although, perhaps I could (somehow) compare
&gt; the volumes of my (software) RAID 1 Mirror?

Perhaps. If you have had a crash--and reading between the lines it
sounds like you have--I'd be taking a "dd" of the partition in question.
