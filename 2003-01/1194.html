Duncan and Sun would be rightly peeved at the garbage going on over 
this event;

 "Microsoft is making the most of its opportunity, flying US
 business strategy senior vice-president Maggie Wilderotter
 to Australia to address the public sector troops. 

 This has prompted rival software maker Sun Microsystems to
 complain about being frozen out of an official role at the
 seminar. 

 "I'm looking for some guidance from the federal government
 as to what they're seeking to achieve from the event," Sun
 Australia Linux product manager Duncan Bennet said. "The
 event is very much about open source and, obviously, Sun has
 a number of open source products.
..

 "NOIE business strategy branch general manager Steve Alford
 said the program for the seminar had been decided in
 consultation with public sector CIOs and software industry
 groups. 

 "Our target audience for the seminar are the chief
 information officers and chief technology officers, may of
 whom have made substantial investments in their departments
 in the Microsoft operating environment," Mr Alford said. 

 "This is not a Linux sales program. It aims to provide a
 balanced view." 
"
What a piece of work this is.  MS can bring out one of their big guns 
and get to sit on the panel alongside IBM etc all the while openly 
being antagonistic to the whole concept of opensource - anti-American 
&lt;sigh&gt;

Does anybody seriously expect anything positive to come out of this?

Cheers,  Ian
