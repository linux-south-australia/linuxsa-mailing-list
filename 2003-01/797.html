&gt; &gt; Uh, XP home = XP Pro with some modified registry settings.  
&gt; &gt; They're exactly based on the same thing.
&gt; 
&gt; So it's now possible to create a full NT domain trust with XP home?

No, but Microsoft had the perfect opportunity to get rid of the Windows
98 branch with Windows XP.  Did you see a Windows 2000 "Home" edition?

Windows 2000 was still seen by many as the "Professional" operating
system for some reason, rather than the one best used for home.  Having
really crappy legacy support was also a major downfall, and it still is.

When it was released, Windows XP could have brought together Windows 98
users with Windows 2000 users if they'd wanted, but they decided not to
to do that.  They decided to create two identical products, and then
seperate them down the middle by changing some end-user features, giving
it a new login screen and reducing its price.  Looks to me like Windows
XP Home is the next step in the '98' stream, and Windows XP Pro is the
'NT' stream still going strong.  I'd say the stream goes something like
this

They could be doing this on purpose, so that if their Palladium garbage
makes it to the commercial desktop, we'll probably see the one client
and one server from now on.  Until Unix undermines Microsoft of course
:-)

It's obvious their development path went down two ways, and although
their technology is now all NT-based, they are still targeting a Windows
98 market.  This chart represents the releases.  To me at least, Windows
XP Home is the 'next step' in Windows 98's foulness, even though it's of
NT-design.

makes it to the commercial desktop, we'll probably see the one client
and one server from now on.  Until Unix undermines Microsoft of course

PS.
Ew I just drew a Windows ascii chart.  After I looked at what I'd drawn
I thought, why am I doing this, and then I thought, oh who gives a fsck
:)
