I like to think that broadband services of any kind arern't just about 
doing the same things faster, which is how they tend to be perceived by 
just about everyone right now.

The Internet has been around in one form or another since 1969, but it 
wasn't until 14400 modems became commonplace that it (along with the 
web) became interesting enough to start attracting the masses. Not too 
many people had the foresight to see where it was going to end up, and 
we might see the same thing with broadband.

It's hard to imagine what the future holds, but chances are that fast 
and attractively tarriffed local networks can enable applications that 
change our lives (in ways that we'll probably take for granted). ISP's 
peering with each other AND community networks will make this possible.

Imagine:

voice-over-ip - here today, but not for everyone. Community networks 
potentially challenge local call monopolies.

videophones - a long time feature of almost every science fiction movie, 
just waiting for networks to mature enough to feature the right QoS, and 
technology to make it cheap and easy to use.

broadcast of localised events - you probably can't watch your local 
football team play on TV right now, nor do you see TV ads for your local 
butcher.

remote medical services - if you're sick have a doctor examine you 
remotely, or have outpatient checkups without having to go to a hospital 
and be at risk of disease from other sick people.

paranoid parental coverage - watch your kids at kindergarten or school 
based on live video feed that picks the camera closest to the location 
of their RFID tag.

There are lots of things that won't happen because of fast Internet, but 
they will become possible. All of the things I mention above are already 
happening somewhere, but like the 14.4 modems, faster access will allow 
it to become part of everyday life (for those who can afford it..).
