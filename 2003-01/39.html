&gt; Present estimates are that we will need about $1.5 million for this

&gt; I would like to better this figure but that depends on the level of 
&gt; community
&gt; support that the project can build. The major cost will be 
&gt; infrastructure to
&gt; build and install 10 Community Access Points, some in City of 
&gt; Playford, most
&gt; in City of Salisbury.

My instant and uninformed thought process goes like this...

Hmm, $1.5 million for ten 802.11b base stations, that's like $150,000 
each! You'd want to be reaching an awful lot of people and have an 
awful lot of traffic per base station to make that kind of money 
worthwhile.

What if $1.5 million were to be spent on computers, modems and normal 
dialups instead? $400 per computer and say $100 per year for localised 
Internet access. You could get 3000 people connected from nothing. How 
many could wireless connect?

To use wireless, people would need their own computers, their own 
802.11b cards AND be within range of the access point. How many people 
can use these access points? Unless they're using something different, 
it's still going to be limited to 50 metre radius. If they have to 
travel to the access point, they may as well go into TAFE and use the 
existing links along with the benefit that the computers are provided.

So I wonder... how many people would benefit from wireless vs how many 
people would benefit from normal access methods? For $1.5 million, 
where's the greater benefit?
