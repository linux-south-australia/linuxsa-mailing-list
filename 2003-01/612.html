&gt; &gt; I guess this means that if you want to avoid TCPA, then you can choose
&gt; &gt; to buy a PC without if for a while.  Eventually you won't have a choice,
&gt; &gt; but hopefully by then Linux would run on TCPA PC's and we can continue
&gt; &gt; using the OS that we know and love.
&gt; 
&gt; You might have a choice.  The old ISA architecture really was quite
&gt; terrible, and so IBM 'invented' MCA which really did make PCs faster.
&gt; Unfortunately MCA was patented (even to IBM's surprise) and most
&gt; manufacturers were unwilling to pay the royalties.  The industry responded
&gt; by designing EISA, which was entirely as complicated as MCA but a heck
&gt; of a lot cheaper.  With speed and cost both on the side of EISA, why
&gt; don't we use it today?  Too complicated, hence consumer disinterest.
&gt; That's probably why we have PCI today, and thus it all turned out okay.
&gt; 
&gt; TCPA might be like MCA and EISA: too expensive and/or too complicated.

i think that there was more to the ISA/EISA/MCA issue, compaq and others
were pushing EISA as a top end "server" product.

there was also the cost factor EISA shiped in smaller quantity and
was twice the price for otherwise equivalent mainboards ...

and then there was VL-BUS ... thankfully now laid to rest =)

but PCI is a standard, but the big players will want to push
a new standard out soon ... marketing boys get tired of the
same of toys =/

cheers,

kim
