I don't have a direct answer to your question (sorry) but in a related thread 
on emu10k1 sound quality, I became aware of utilities and drivers obtained 
through Creative and Source Forge.  You could get some insight into the 
architecture by reading the documents which come with:
	emu-tools-0.9.4.tar.gz
and	emu10k1-v0.20a.tar.bz2

I've experienced frustration similar to yours whereby once it would work and 
some time later it would be broken with no clue as to what may have happened 
to change it.  The emu-tools include a utility named emu-dspmgr plus some 
plug-ins, I remember reading about surround sound plug-ins, perhaps this is 
what you need.

Good luck,

&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I have a sblive! value and I am trying to configure ogle to use my 4
&gt; speakers properly (which is supposedly supported). I know the driver
&gt; supports it because I have set up xine to use 4 speakers before, and it
&gt; worked fine. At the moment the front speakers are mirrored on the back.
&gt;
&gt; In the oglerc file I have set up the speakers as such:
&gt;
&gt;     &lt;speakers&gt;
&gt;       &lt;front&gt;2&lt;/front&gt;
&gt;       &lt;rear&gt;2&lt;/rear&gt;
&gt;       &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&gt;     &lt;/speakers&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I have been switching between ALSA and OSS (easy with mandrake 9), but no
&gt; luck. When I use ALSA ogle just says it's using 2 channels, under OSS it
&gt; doesn't say anything about channels, but as far as I can tell it's only 2
&gt; speakers (I just listen to the dolby sound thing at the start of The
&gt; Matrix).
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody had luck setting this up?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Damien
