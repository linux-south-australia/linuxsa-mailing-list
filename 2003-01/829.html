*Note to all mailing-list newbies* - the reason I post this is to
show what I've discovered, so that other people searching the
mailing lists for similar issues can see the resolution rather
than just a bunch of people with similar problems ...  I also
intend to follow up in the linux-vlan mailing list, even though
it's probably less appropriate for there.

Earlier, Greg 'groggy' Lehey wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just to help localize the problem, have you tried running this card
&gt;&gt;&gt; with FreeBSD?

No.  Because it's a "production" laptop (in that I use it daily, including
weekends, for my work, including an on-call component) and had been in use
for about two years, it has two year's worth of accumulated software on it.
The worst case scenario was that I blew away either partition and would be
unable to restore it (even from backups) in a timely manner.  So while I
had considered installing FreeBSD, the risk currently was too great[1].
Does FreeBSD have a CD-only running version?  I know I could muck around
with mfsroot, but I don't have a system here capable of building it yet.

Besides, it was FreeBSD's fault anyway.  :-)  (Read on).

Subsequently, Greg 'groggy' Lehey wrote:

&gt; It could also be related to hardware compatibility.  That's why I
&gt; suggested it.

A combination of a good night's sleep and some meditation on the problem
this morning brought forth the answer, being that it was the Host AP box.
I thought about possible points of failure, and realised I hadn't ruled
out the AP (so "Nyah!" DSL, I *do* make mistakes! :-).  So while I was
booting the AUUG Knoppix CD, I did some grepping of the wi driver code
in the FreeBSD source tree (I'd already done this on Linux's drivers,
thinking it was the problem), and came across this gem:

zen# grep 120 *
wi_hostap.h:#define WIHAP_DFLT_INACTIVITY_TIME	120 /* 2 minutes */

(That symbolic name is a dead giveaway if ever I saw one.)  Grepping
for that shows quite a few hits within wi_hostap.c.  When Knoppix had
finished booting (this was happening concurrently), it loaded the
orinoco_cs pcmcia driver, DHCP'd up the network fine, then disassociated
after being idle for 2 minutes.  So that's two Linux drivers down for
the count, so to speak.  Setting the wi interface to debug mode (which
I've only just figured out, again from the source) reveals:

Jan 18 16:49:35 zen /kernel: wi0: inactivity disassoc: 00:40:05:ae:f6:32
Jan 18 16:49:35 zen /kernel: Sending deauth to sta 00:40:05:ae:f6:32


I've been looking at the sources for wicontrol and ifconfig, and neither
of them seem to be able to alter the timeout (so far), but the wi
driver indicates host ap timeout changes should be supported through
its ioctl() interface, which indicates that it's doable.  Short term
fix is to cut me a knew kernel; longer term is to check the FreeBSD
tree to see if wicontrol/ifconfig supports it now, or write a small
util that ioctl()'s appropriate values to the appropriate interface.


[1]  One of my back burner projects for a while now has been
"Joe 90"[2], a set up where I can reload system images of various
distributions via Etherboot/PXE onto a variety of machines.  I
figured it was a way of maintaining configuration management while
being able to cope with a lot more operating system configurations
than machines.  The advantages for me would be a) being able to test
software on a variety of machine configurations (NT/95 OS' included)
(BTW, thanks for that link, MMC), and b) being able to restore
machines to their previous state after just making hack 'n' slash
changes to them.  Still need more time in the day.
