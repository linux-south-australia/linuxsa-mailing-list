 From the AUUG website:
    The Security Symposium provides a forum for discussion of security 
technologies,    techniques and management.

I would think the following would be appropriate.
Technologies
    Firewalls
    Intrusion Detection
    VPN
    IPSec
    PKI
    ... etc ...
Techniques
    ssh tunnelling
    sftp etc
    CERT watching/Email lists
    ???
    Social Engineering
    ... etc ...
Management
    Policy? Whats current best practice?
    Social engineering
    work instructions/practice
    Updates/Patches (and maybe automation?)
    ... etc ...
   

Is this what is expected?
Maybe a little box hacking demo to provide some fear and Zeal &gt;:)
I would be interested in finding out more/helping.

Regards,
Brandon Johnson    Network Engineer CSC

&gt;&gt;OK,
&gt;&gt;Who would like to organise one of these?  Sounds like fun.

&gt;&gt;Would there be anyone interested in attending something like this?

&gt;&gt;AUUG are planning to hold a security symposium in Adelaide this year.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I should hasten to add that the AUUG security symposium will be
&gt;nothing like what that URL describes.  We're off to a rather slow
&gt;start, and I'd actively solicit volunteers.  Take a look at
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au/events/security.html">http://www.auug.org.au/events/security.html</A> for an idea of what we're
&gt;planning.
&gt;
&gt;At the moment, I'd like to ask for people prepared to help with the
&gt;organization.  Our business manager, Liz Carroll, will do the
&gt;nitty-gritty work, but she's in Sydney, and we need people locally.
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, we need to find:
&gt;
&gt;1.  A venue.
&gt;2.  A date.  The board has decided that it should be in May, but it
&gt;    will require local knowledge to decide when in May.  It's a three
&gt;    day event held during the week.
&gt;3.  Presenters.  Who has something interesting to say about
&gt;    security-related topics?  That's the job of the programme
&gt;    committee.
&gt;4.  Attendees.  This is the kind of event which costs a fair amount of
&gt;    money, but one which employers should be prepared to pay for.
&gt;
&gt;Interested?  Please reply to this message and we'll see what we can
&gt;put together.
&gt;
