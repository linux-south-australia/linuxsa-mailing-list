&gt; &gt; Perhaps getting involved with some people who have been 
&gt; involved with 
&gt; &gt; the whole wireless movement for a lot longer then you have 
&gt; is a good 
&gt; &gt; idea?

There are heaps of these now. I wont bother to name all, but there is a
lot of activity in sydney. www.sydneywireless.com I am a member, and it
was great to find a person who was also a member that lives in the
property directly behind mine. Although he is only about 50m away, he
cant access my AP because of one tree - which is a damn shame! Funnily
enough, we could just run a 100mb ethernet cable and be done with it!

&gt; Most of Ian Loxton's ideas are reasonably sound providing he 
&gt; doesn't fall over the ACA. Until recently air-stream:
&gt; 
&gt; * <A HREF="http://www.air-stream.org/">http://www.air-stream.org/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; ...have been a group of 6 people who have been working 
&gt; reasonably well to pull up a wireless network in Adelaide. 
&gt; However they do have work commitments, study committments and 
&gt; a social life. They also suffer from the "wireless is a great 
&gt; idea but we expect to be able to be part of your network for 
&gt; absolutely no money at all" syndrome.
&gt; 
&gt; Providing wireless access points, no matter how you look at 
&gt; it, is not free. Coordinating a community wireless group does 
&gt; cost  e v e n  i f 
&gt; you cannot by law make a profit to distribute to shareholders 
&gt; or members of the group.
&gt; 
&gt; But I suspect some people wouldn't pay even $5 to be a member 
&gt; of "air-stream" even though I believe it's worth at least ten 
&gt; times that figure to be a member of that organisation.
If it was available close to me, without needing too much extra
equipment (i.e $1000 antenna) I would pay a good amount too!


Cheers.
Happy New year.
