&gt; 1) have own company (flexible but high costs, lots of
&gt;    paperwork and rapidly losing the tax benefits it once had)

IMHO, only do this if you are confident you can stay disciplined and
organised, and keep on top of the paperwork EVERY week. Also, the real
benefit of being on your own comes when you can move beyond simply
selling your services and start actually building a business. It's
really not worth the bother of setting up a company if you don't
really want to build a business from it (what I mean by build a
business is employ people, develop intellectual property, grow a
client base, and create a brand -- without these, you don't own a
business, you own a job, and that rapidly loses its charm).

&gt; 2) go through a "management" company like CXC or Entity
&gt;    Solutions etc (a mob of accountants basically)
&gt;    (lower cost, if you're not doing a contract no cost to
&gt;    you, less paperwork etc - but not particularly flexible
&gt;    if you want to branch out into other things as well (like
&gt;    selling computers (for eg))

Yes, but it depends if you really want to branch out, with all the
accompanying hassle...

&gt; 3) go through an agency (like Icon)
&gt;    (costs much more than (2) but simpler for you, no flexibility)

It's still pretty darned flexible -- you are still on contract
somewhere, and can go somewhere else. In some ways, this is the best
option for someone who doesn't want to be too tied down -- as soon as
you start building a business, you get tied to it.

&gt; 
&gt; what about being a sole trader (like plumbers etc)?
&gt; I suppose that's option (1) really?

Similar. The difference is that a pty ltd company is a separate legal
entity, whereas a sole trader (or a partnership) is not. This means
that legal action can't be taken against you personally (if that
happens), it has to go against the company itself -- which means your
house and car are safe. HOWEVER, if, as a director of a company, you
are founf to be negligent, then you become personally liable anyway.

&gt; can you have a combination of (1) and (2)?

Yes, but I think it's twice as much effort with twice the overhead
etc.

&gt; or can you do option (1) but having no interest in paperwork
&gt; or dealing with tax etc?

No. You can have an accountant do most of it, but unless you are
disciplined and organised enough to keep them fed with your data etc,
they can't do their job, and it doesn't work. I'm sure you can somehow
outsource most things (bookkeeping, invoicing, accounting, tax, etc),
but that would come at a not insignificant cost, which may erode the
advantage of having a company in the first place.

One thing to consider is whether you want to be a contractor or a
consultant. Contractors tend to do a series of single contracts --
effectively short term jobs -- for different companies, rarely working
for more than one company at once. Contracts vary from a month or so
up to a few years, or even indefinite, ongoing ones. Consultants tend
to have a fair number of things going on at once, and they often tend
to be small jobs, of a day or a few weeks, or perhaps even a few hours
every week for a few years. Consultants tend to be more like companies
in that they sell services to many clients, whereas contractors tend
to be more like employees, in that they sell their services to a
single client at a time. The line is blurry, but trying to do both at
once is difficult, as the clients of contractors tend to expect 40
hours a week, whereas the clients of consultants tend to expect
immediate response to whatever the issue is, even if it's a 10 minute
job at 3:15pm on a Tuesday. It's very hard to balance these two types
of demand.

The decision as to whether you want to work as a consultant or
contractor will affect what type of arrangement you will use --
contractors tend to find recruitment agencies (Icon, Speakman etc)
more useful than do consultants.

The other thing to be certain of is that you really want to do this --
it's all very romantic and "free" when you're on the outside, but
in reality, you end up exchanging 1 boss for 10, and have to deal
directly with people like accountants and the ATO, which is less fun
than it sounds (and it doens't sound like fun at all).

Good Luck.
