Hi All,
Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on anti-virus/spam on sendmail.
i've read all the linuxsa archives on anti-virus and there's a pile of
anti-spam measures in sendmail which is excellent.  what i'm interested in
is what are people using with success?   i think nowadays that anti-spam
should be built into anti-virus.  stinks that symantec only have anti-spam
on their exchange2000 product.  crock.  sorry, starting to rant.

i read that AmaViS is a resource hog, but is free.  we have a fairly beefy
box, so apart from being a hog, is there any problems with it apart from
being a hog?

symantec has an SMTP gateway by the look of it so i might convince someone
to buy something.  like someone suggested open source virus stuff is
unlikely to happen because of the resources needed to keep the definitions
up to date.

i wonder if it's legal to use the .exe updates from symantec if one was to
figure out the format of the file.  if a person paid for a symantec desktop
license they get the use of the updates, so in that case could they use an
open source product that uses those same definitions?  just a thought.

anyway.
ta
Matt
