&gt;&gt; And then they have the audacity to pin the problem on SMTP.

&gt; I don't read them as blaming SMTP.

Is UUCP email unaffected by the problem?  It's an RFC822 interpretation
"issue" on their part, so mentioning SMTP (which is a session layer
protocol) is a complete furfy, unless they're inferring that they're
own superior "Exchange protocol" doesn't suffer from the problem,
which is how the MCSE that brought it to my attention read it.

&gt; It's nice when the sender whips the output of uudecode into /bin/mail
&gt; and I can merely click on an attacment to access the original document.

Even though its not sent as an attachment.  I believe that if it was
supposed to have been sent as an attachment, then send it as such, not
to have the client second guess the intentions (and then get it wrong).
It's like IE "automatically" correct backslashes in URLs to forward
slashes, rendering improper URLs only readable by IE (surprising, that).

I achieve similar results under elm with "|uudecode".  Suprisingly
flexible: "|metamail" handles MIME encoded emails, and
"|sed -ne '/^$/,$p' | psql dbname" (one I've actually used) imported
an export of a small Postgres database, without having to resort to
saving to temporary files.  I'd hate to think what Outlook/Express would
try to guess to do under those circumstances.
