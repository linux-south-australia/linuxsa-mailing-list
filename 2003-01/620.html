&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess this means that if you want to avoid TCPA, then you can choose
&gt; &gt; &gt; to buy a PC without if for a while.  Eventually you won't have a choice,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but hopefully by then Linux would run on TCPA PC's and we can continue
&gt; &gt; &gt; using the OS that we know and love.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You might have a choice.  The old ISA architecture really was quite
&gt; &gt; terrible, and so IBM 'invented' MCA which really did make PCs faster.
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately MCA was patented (even to IBM's surprise) and most
&gt; &gt; manufacturers were unwilling to pay the royalties.  The industry responded
&gt; &gt; by designing EISA, which was entirely as complicated as MCA but a heck
&gt; &gt; of a lot cheaper.  With speed and cost both on the side of EISA, why
&gt; &gt; don't we use it today?  Too complicated, hence consumer disinterest.
&gt; &gt; That's probably why we have PCI today, and thus it all turned out okay.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; TCPA might be like MCA and EISA: too expensive and/or too complicated.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe. but more likely that there will be 'seen' to be two grades of
&gt; hardware: trusted and untrusted. Price will probably determine
&gt; popularity, but ability to access some services like video on demand and
&gt; other content may drive the 'secure' solution at the behest of the big
&gt; players like Sony and MS, and will be a factor for many users in the
&gt; purchase decision.
&gt; 
&gt; The real question is will there be an avenue for a linux to boot on the
&gt; TCPA box, and will the TCPA boxes become popular to the point where it
&gt; is a problem for us because there are many computers out there that will
&gt; not boot into a real operating system.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe it will be able to run under a guest OS arrangement like VMWare
&gt; (who have a serious investment in linux on PC hardware), although such
&gt; an arrangement would break the 'free' nature of linux on TCPA hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; As seems usual these days, there are competing interests of open and
&gt; closed systems facing off once again. Will this become 1984 revisited or
&gt; just another megalomaniac control freak's wet dream?

one of the key things that drives the PC market is the Games Industry.
they *have* a serious investment in PC hardware as it stands,
i think that they will determine where to go, and most of the non
business world will follow ...

but, they will also want better copy protection and this means
a "trusted" system will give them the warm and fuzzy feeling
so will mostly go with it, but the xbox scene seems to be the
precusor to the trusted scene as far as i can tell...
and the xbox scene at the moment is pumping out low quality games
certainly not what folks like sony want to be associated with...

trusted hardware will also do away with our good old friends
the overclockers ... is no underground culture safe from
microsoft =(

cheers,

Kim
