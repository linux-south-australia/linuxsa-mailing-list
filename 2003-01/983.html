What about the distribution. EG Redhat. It's "redhat linux". Its
produced by redhat (from external opensource projects, and inhouse
opensource projects). They make a lot of the configuration tools. I
think you can hire them to work on a problem too. At least you could,
but I think I may have seen that they were dropping that. You can list
any strange bugs in their bugzilla database... And you can still hire
local support anyway. What more do they want?
