I'm not quite sure what comment you were replying to, and who wrote
it... [1] but I'll hazard a guess.
&gt; 
&gt; Some people are banking that this will change in the coming year..  It's
&gt; what the crystal ball told me..

&gt; &gt;Ian,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;People choose Windows because the available (commercial) 
&gt; &gt;&gt;support is much
&gt; &gt;&gt;more mature and the platform is unified.

Is this the comment to which you were replying?

If so, I don't see how the fact that commercial Windows support is
available would add to the TCO of Linux. Commercial Linux support is
also available nowdays.

So, TCO for Windows is the price of the licensing + support. TCO for
Linux is just what you pay for support, and a couple dollars for the
software.

If you pay the same for Linux and Windows support, how does that make
Linux any less competative to Windows in term of cost??

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Unix people can't even agree on standard email formats let 
&gt; &gt;&gt;alone a standard architecture - it's the great undoing of 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Linux and Window's strength.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;And since when could Windows do these things?

Sorry if I'm missing something.

Daniel Mundy.


[1] When you quote an email, you do it to make clear to whom and to what
you are replying to. Sorry to be so blunt but your quoting was all over
the place, and would almost have been as useful as not including any of
the original thread [2].

Cut out the parts that are not immediately relevant to what you are
saying in reply, that way the quoted text will simply serve as a
reminder to where the thread was going. If someone elses quoting was
lacking, fix it up (if it makes your own message more understandable,
it's worth the time).

Even if you may be required to use Outlook, this is no excuse to simply
churn out mass amounts of email without thinking about simple things
like message layout.

[2] Key word being "almost".
