&gt; &gt; &gt; Obviously not..... Unless someone can tell me
&gt; &gt; &gt; different.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unless your SuSE is super ancient you should be able to
&gt; &gt; do:

Alan David is dead right.
Your install must be broken.
(also 3.1 is ancient now)
Though it should still work ..
Wow having to setenv is pretty drastic..
(though nice hack)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; % docbook2pdf hello.sgml
&gt; &gt; % docbook2html hello.sgml
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; David,
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed that's exactly what I tried, with dozens of
&gt; variations. But the docbook2html just didn't like my
&gt; choice of "public identifier". It gave me dozens of lines
&gt; of useless error messages.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Did you know that the Definitive Guid
&gt; &gt; (to Docbook) is available for free download:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * <A HREF="http://www.docbook.org/">http://www.docbook.org/</A>
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, that's where I got my "hello world" document
&gt; from. The problem - as I now understand it - is that the
&gt; docbook2html style of invocation just doesn't match that
&gt; "hello world" document. I consulted numerous
&gt; introductions, manuals and man-pages. These are some of
&gt; the useful links I found:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/soft/docbook.html">http://www.topology.org/soft/docbook.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; What I really needed was documentation for "Configuring
&gt; your DocBook/SGML/XML Environment". 
Yeah absolutely. SGML =&gt; DSSL makes undertanding the unix
library linkages look like a pack of iced vovos. However. If
installing from fresh it should be autoconfigured for you.
Your sure you haven't deleted / edited a catalog file or
something ?.

if you have some kernel sources hanging about you could try
autogenerating the sgml docs in there. That should work
AOK.. If not ... Or some other known ok sgml doc.

I have some  stuff you could play with if you like.
(they are big enough and modularised enough to fully test
your install)

Checkout the docs section at my website... (url in sig)

&gt; All of the available documentation seems to assume that
&gt; some guru has set up your environment and all you have to
&gt; do is start typing documents.
Yeah it's pretty much the same with XML.. (though not nearly
as bad.) You need to know the history of the approach.

&gt; I'm sure the documentation I needed was out there
&gt; somewhere, but the SGML/XML literature on the net is so
&gt; vast and poorly written that I couldn't find the right
&gt; tree in the forest. When I say poorly written, I mean that
&gt; every piece of DocBook/SGML/XML literature assumed that
&gt; you were already knowledgable about the subject and just
&gt; needed a bit of extra detail on something. It's what I
&gt; used to call Kontextfrei when I encountered this style of

Kontextfri --- great word -- yep that descibes it  spot on.

&gt; documentation constantly while working in Germany.
&gt; Everything I read on DocBook/SGML/XML was either useless
&gt; philosophical generalities (apparently written for babies
&gt; or managers), or else fine details of syntax (apparently
&gt; written for gurus).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; DSL
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; (ps: welcome back--did you go on a Safari or something?)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks. I went hermit - to write a book on differential
&gt; geometry full time for 18 months while waiting for the IT
&gt; industry to get back on its legs. This DocBook problem was
&gt; just so painfully frustrating, I finally decided that it
&gt; was time to resubscribe to linuxsa. There are some
&gt; problems that are so difficult that all the man-pages,
&gt; online documentation, O'Reilly books, specialist mailing
&gt; list archives, the Google encyclopedia, examination of the
&gt; source, and deep meditation just can't solve.
&gt; Then it's time to throw oneself at the mercy of linuxsa.

&lt;bowed double bass and didge should kick in about here&gt;
