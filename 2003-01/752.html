&gt; see that you are prepared to do a little work to make it happen.  One 
&gt; approach would be to collect the contents of 
&gt; /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGES.md3sums into one file and sort it on the second 
&gt; field.  Then create another using md5sum from the root directory.  Then do a 
&gt; diff on the two files.  
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck,

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any tool that anyone knows of that will enable me to see
&gt; &gt; exactly what has changed from the standard debian packages on my
&gt; &gt; machine? I want to know for two reasons -- to help document my
&gt; &gt; installation, and to help me identify and recover a few corrupted
&gt; &gt; files.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One thought that I have is to create a subdirectory on a partition
&gt; &gt; with room, and basically re-install all my packages there and do a
&gt; &gt; recursive diff or something similar. However, I'd rather there was
&gt; &gt; something a little more sophisticated available. Another thought was
&gt; &gt; forcing a re-install of each and every package, but I have a feeling
&gt; &gt; that that may cause more problems than it solves -- I'd rather know
&gt; &gt; what differences existed so I could deal with each individually...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any comments?
