 I had the same issue with RH8 - an explanation and rpm that fixes the
ability to play mp3s is available at <A HREF="http://www.xmms.org">http://www.xmms.org</A> on the front page.

Quoting Andrew Galdes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:AGaldes@elders.com.au">AGaldes@elders.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I have custom installed RH8.0 over a previous install of suse and
found that
&gt; xmms isn't working from any user including new users. 
&gt; 
&gt; When starting xmms, it loads fine. however, it will not play anything.
&gt; Pressing play will bring up the "Open" window asking me to select a
song to
&gt; play. Selecting a song and pressing play just repeats the story. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have cleared the /tmp directory of anything likely to be the cause.
I have
&gt; reinstalled xmms. Anything else I should try?
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

Are you trying to play a mp3?  xmms under RedHat doesn't support mp3
natively 
right now due to licensing concerns - there are RH8 RPMs with support
available 
from 3rd parties on the web which are meant for RH8.  Google will help.

And before people get on the bandwagon, I don't blame RH for going down
this 
path - distributors haven't been given immunity from MP3 licensing
costs, so a) 
Red Hat would have to charge more, and b) their freely downloadable ISOs
would 
have to differ from the "supported" ISOs.  Go Ogg Vorbis go!

OTOH, if other sound files don't work as well, look at what sound
daemons you 
have going, that might help.  I don't believe there's been any change
there, 
but it wouldn't hurt to check.
