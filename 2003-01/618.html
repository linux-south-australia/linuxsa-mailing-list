&gt; &gt; I guess this means that if you want to avoid TCPA, then you can choose
&gt; &gt; to buy a PC without if for a while.  Eventually you won't have a choice,
&gt; &gt; but hopefully by then Linux would run on TCPA PC's and we can continue
&gt; &gt; using the OS that we know and love.
&gt; 
&gt; You might have a choice.  The old ISA architecture really was quite
&gt; terrible, and so IBM 'invented' MCA which really did make PCs faster.
&gt; Unfortunately MCA was patented (even to IBM's surprise) and most
&gt; manufacturers were unwilling to pay the royalties.  The industry responded
&gt; by designing EISA, which was entirely as complicated as MCA but a heck
&gt; of a lot cheaper.  With speed and cost both on the side of EISA, why
&gt; don't we use it today?  Too complicated, hence consumer disinterest.
&gt; That's probably why we have PCI today, and thus it all turned out okay.
&gt; 
&gt; TCPA might be like MCA and EISA: too expensive and/or too complicated.

Maybe. but more likely that there will be 'seen' to be two grades of
hardware: trusted and untrusted. Price will probably determine
popularity, but ability to access some services like video on demand and
other content may drive the 'secure' solution at the behest of the big
players like Sony and MS, and will be a factor for many users in the
purchase decision.

The real question is will there be an avenue for a linux to boot on the
TCPA box, and will the TCPA boxes become popular to the point where it
is a problem for us because there are many computers out there that will
not boot into a real operating system.

Maybe it will be able to run under a guest OS arrangement like VMWare
(who have a serious investment in linux on PC hardware), although such
an arrangement would break the 'free' nature of linux on TCPA hardware.

As seems usual these days, there are competing interests of open and
closed systems facing off once again. Will this become 1984 revisited or
just another megalomaniac control freak's wet dream?
