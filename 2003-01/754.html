&gt;&gt;Anyway, Ian, I would have thought that you, of all people, would have
&gt;&gt;understood the arguments about information-haves and information-have-nots
&gt;&gt;which were put forward in the ACLU vs Reno case in the late 90's.  You're
&gt;&gt;managing a project which aims to break the digital divide by giving Internet
&gt;&gt;access to disadvantaged people;  Can you *really* see a future for them
&gt;&gt;when the Internet they get to use has been deliberately nobbled, and is
&gt;&gt;less featureful and less pleasant to use than the Internet which those who
&gt;&gt;can afford commercial rates can access?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; To be fair to Ian, even though he's got a snowball's chance in Hell of
&gt; success, he *does* have to try.  He's absolutely right that a public
&gt; access internet terminal displaying some blonde bimbo's udders is totally
&gt; unacceptable.

... or "udderly unacceptable" :-)

In any case, I'm unconvinced that a technical solution is required to
demonstrate due care in this situation.  A strong and (fairly) enforced
acceptable use policy coupled with "privacy screens" (screens on
monitors which restrict the field of view so that those who are not
immediately in front of the screen can't see it) ought to be sufficient.

To be sure, I've never once walked past the Ngapartji public access
terminals and seen anything I'd regard as offensive.  I find that I
need to challenge those who think censorware is required to explain
their priorities, because it seems to me that there are far more
important things to worry about...

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
      but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
