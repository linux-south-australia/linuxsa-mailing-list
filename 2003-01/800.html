&gt; Wow.

&gt; Its little wonder that the majority of the population sees Linux 
&gt; people as being a bit 'left field', along with the community that 
&gt; works on it - is it.
&gt;
&gt; Ian asked y'all a simple, *technical* question.
&gt;
&gt; This *technical* question is whether there is something comparable in 
&gt; the Linux world available, that generates a technical outcome similar 
&gt; (or indeed better) than the Norton software suite for smut-busting and 
&gt; also for general system security - or not.
&gt;
&gt; He didn't ask you to debate 'at him' the notion of whether the 
&gt; community drivers for wanting to do this were legally, morally, or 
&gt; technically defensible.
&gt;
&gt; He just asked if Linux could do something (warts and all accepted!) 
&gt; that his W2K box can do - today, right now, in production. Again, 
&gt; warts and all. 

"Sermon" completely irrelevant.  Ian has asked the question and been 
given answers which he prefers to ignore.  Idon't know why.

DanGuardian has been mentioned (and is used in an article on Linux in 
schools which appeared on this lis recently), so has a PCI card called 
HDD sherif.

Why Ian want's to rant on about the importance of porn-blocking rather 
than respond to the solutions that have been offered I really can't say. 
 It is, however, that ranting which has evoked the negative responses.
