&gt; But I suspect some people wouldn't pay even $5 to be a member of
&gt; "air-stream" even though I believe it's worth at least ten times that
&gt; figure to be a member of that organisation.

I think the problem is cost-benefit.  We've been over this before - 
ultimately since a wireless community network can't offer access to the 
Internet - then what does spending $x get you?  

If all it gets you is the ability to d/l stuff from other people then it's
probably cheaper to just drive to their house and get burnt CDs (never
underestimate the bandwidth of a truck full of tapes quote etc).

(I can see the benefits of an education based network for organizations as 
there are obvious resources they can share - eg. people - one admin person 
could easily look after many linux sites remotely)

I think if said network could offer some benefit, like internet access, then 
people would hook up, but unless being able to play games amongst your 
friends is what you want, then it doesn't massively offer you something 
above your internet connection.

I'm not deriding a wireless community network as a pointless exercise, I can 
see and appreciate it in terms of the community aspect, and as with most 
people, if I could connect up easily (*) I would, but I'm not sure what I'd 
use it for.


eg.

- I can already d/l most linux stuff I need from Internode's mirrors for no
additional cost.  

- I guess if linuxsa was available via a WCN I'd get it delivered via there,
but that's a fairly marginal thing.

- I guess I could make things available to other people - eg. some sort of
rate limited access via NAT to internode's mirrors (technically easy,
legally dodgy) but there are probably easier ways for people to get most of
this stuff.

(*) Currently I'm renting so putting up antenna's isn't really possible or 
worthwhile.

So, ultimately, attaching to said network would have to be low cost and low 
effort for the benefits I would perceive.
