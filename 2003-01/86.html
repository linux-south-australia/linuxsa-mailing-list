That is just a ballpark figure mentioned during discussions. What I 
suggested was how much it might cost for a base station and serves etc 
and around 20 to 30 client stations. I was given the figure of around 
$150k. The aim is to use the federal funding to buy the whole 
infrastructure outright so that the ongoing running of the project is 
minimal. I don't know the exact figures. We have not gotten close enough 
to detail to work out any sort of standard set up nor have we worked out 
how many clients per base station etc. 

This is just a concept and I aired it because I wanted to hear the pros 
and cons of the concept to help me fine tune the technology part of the 
whole. This thread is helping me greatly even though it might appear 
some are taking it negatively.

&gt; What if $1.5 million were to be spent on computers, modems and normal 
&gt; dialups instead?
&gt;
Well you still have to add in the installation cost of an extra 
dedicated line and then around $330 rental a year plus call costs plus 
internet costs etc. Then include the problem of disconnecting lines and 
getting new installations out of Telstra when shifting the location of a 
client station. Remember, the house model you are thinking of is in the 
minority. Most of our client premises will be community clubs, sporting 
venues, community facilities.

It still might end up cheaper to do it by dialups but then the funding 
is not for ongoing support, the funding is looking at providing 
infrastructure for big jobs that wont need much in the way of ongoing 
support. To my limited knowledge that calls for a wireless solution. I 
could easily be wrong, I don't think so.

Cheers,  Ian
