&gt; 
&gt; Back in BSD4.1ish sockets worked slightly differently.  I think it was
&gt; listen that you called to block and wait for a connection, although
&gt; that was so long ago that maybe it's now something different which
&gt; we used to call :) Anyway, the point is that you got to inspect the
&gt; incoming connection before accepting; you could call peerinfo to find
&gt; out who they were, and reject if you didn't want to talk to them.
&gt; The reject system call seems now to have gone by the wayside, so it
&gt; seems there's no way to peruse the list, not even the first element,
&gt; without actually accepting.  Most people probably just accept and then
&gt; close if they don't want to talk.

Right. You can do that, but I think, only on the top connection on the 
queue.

FreeBSD also has the concept of an acceptfilter. It is a KLD 
(unfortunately) that can be specified that looks at the incoming 
connections and accepts or rejects them in the kernel based on some 
criteria supplied by the userlevel.
