This problem has been resolved, but I don't know why - I don't even know
where to begin to look to figure out why the problem happened.

I have a set of perl scripts that do genomics analysis and are batched
together by a script (not set as executable which I `. ./batch' to start).
Over the holidays this batch went from working to returning a bash error
when trying to run the perl scripts (the error related to the syntax of
the perl but was reported by bash (? it didn't look like a perl error))
and now having done a apt-get update/upgrade back to working (so I can't
post the error verbatim, but it was along the lines of unexpected token).

The perl has not been changed and as far as I can see, bash was not
upgraded (perl was).

Things are working again, so I'm not _really_ worried, but I am wildly
befuddled. Does anyone have any ideas what may have happened.

Sorry about the lack of info, but I can't get the problem to replicate.

Dan
