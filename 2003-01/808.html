Ian,

I should hardly say you've been given "flack". Everyone has been
relatively good humoured about it.

&gt; Ian is not "ranting", I have been responding to the claptrap that has
&gt; been presented to me as arguments why I need not have bothered trying.

People have answered your questions...

&gt; When it is a case of doing porn blocking or not having a computer in a
&gt; public venue then what direction would you choose to follow? That is the
&gt; choice that faces me. I have no other options available to me. 

But you say that Windows does the job you want to do.

&gt; Why is it that my goals of bringing Linux to the masses continue to get
&gt; such a heated and negative response? Is there elitism amongst the ranks?

That is taking everyone else's arguments too far. No elitism there is, but
you are speaking to a community unafraid to take a stance on particular
issues.

Not my problem if you can't cope :-)
