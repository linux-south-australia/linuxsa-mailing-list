Wow.

Its little wonder that the majority of the population sees Linux 
people as being a bit 'left field', along with the community that 
works on it - is it.

Ian asked y'all a simple, *technical* question.

This *technical* question is whether there is something comparable in 
the Linux world available, that generates a technical outcome similar 
(or indeed better) than the Norton software suite for smut-busting 
and also for general system security - or not.

He didn't ask you to debate 'at him' the notion of whether the 
community drivers for wanting to do this were legally, morally, or 
technically defensible.

He just asked if Linux could do something (warts and all accepted!) 
that his W2K box can do - today, right now, in production. Again, 
warts and all.

Many of you ignored the question and bit the person who asked the 
question for not joining in the religious crusade for the 
intellectual freedom of web browsing under Linux, instead of helping 
him by actually addressing his question.

I *completely* understand the issues about why its technically hard 
(specifically, impossible) to do a perfect job of blocking smut with 
zero examples of 'false positives' (blocking non-smut) and zero 
examples of failures to block obvious smut. I've written long 
submissions about why to government enquiries (who ignored me, of 
course). I'm on 'your side' to the extent that there is, or should 
be, any 'sides' in this issue.

We all KNOW its not perfect. But trotting out the usual excuses for 
dismissing the notion as useless isn't what Ian asked you to do, and 
it isn't helping him at all, in what he said he wanted to achieve.

He has an existing W2K box doing a job for him, he wants to know if 
he can replace it with a Linux box with equivalent or better 
functionality. Most of you ignored that question and proceeded to 
explain to Ian why he's a terrible human being for fielding the W2K 
box in the first place. Yah, that helps a heap, doesn't it (not).

The hard line view that this is not possible to do perfectly, and 
that that any approximations of a technical solution that are 
imperfect are of zero value, is just not reasonable at all.

It is an inflexible point of view that will get the Linux community 
precisely nowhere in the battle to make things better in the world.

It is what gets some of that community dismissed as loonies.

Let me try to make the point with a different technical problem space 
as an example - one that is quite close to my heart:

That abovementioned hard-line point of view means that none of you 
should be running spamassassin to do a best-effort job of blocking 
spam from your mailboxes - shame on you all, you KNOW it isn't 
perfect, you KNOW it doesn't stop all spam.

By the logic espoused in this thread, because spamassassin isn't 
perfect, it has zero value.

Because it has zero value, you shouldn't run it.

By extension, you should accuse anyone who does run it of being naive 
people who 'don't understand the situation'.

But - I bet some of you who think smutbusting is pointless are also 
current users of spamassassin.  I run it.

We all KNOW that spamassassin will generate false positives (block 
what it shouldn't) and false negatives (allow some spam through that 
it should have blocked).

Why run that tool, when you know that you can not, in general , 
guarantee not to block a crucially important piece of email in the 
process? Why DOESN'T that piece of software have zero value? Why am I 
committing significant chunks of engineering staff time at Internode 
to building a spam management tool around spamassassin for the 
benefit of Internode's customers?

Well, its obvious, really. Why do we do ANYTHING in life? We do it when:

	The benefit (to us) exceeds the cost (to us) in doing so.

	We know it isn't perfect but the nett outcome is positive - 
for us- so we do it.

That simple value judgement, above, is why any of us do ANYTHING.

So it is with Ian. In his view, the benefit, to him, of smutbusting 
software in this specific situation, exceeds the (known, and 
understood) negatives in running it.

He's absolutely at rights to hold that point of view, and you must 
respect that he is perfectly allowed to hold that point of view, even 
if it differs to your own.

Its why people accept signed contracts over fax machines that are 
trivial to forge - the benefit exceeds the risk of fraud. It doesn't 
mean no fraud happens, and it doesn't pretend to mean that. It just 
means the benefits are greater than the downsides, which is why it 
happens.

Again: Ian has made it clear that in his situation, the benefits of 
running some smutbusting software on his W2K system, TO HIM, exceeds 
the (known, and accepted) downsides, TO HIM.

If you want to help Ian to convince his community otherwise, that's 
easy - get together and write him a suitable disclaimer that he can 
put up on the wall beside his machine that sets appropriate 
expectations in terms of the outcome of using it (e.g. that you may 
get legitimate sites blocked, and you may get some nasties that come 
up regardless of our reasonable efforts to block them).

That whole hard line attitude (If you can't solve it perfectly, you 
should not bother trying at all) is amazingly 'brittle' as a way to 
live.

It doesn't just mean that people who think that way shouldn't run spamassassin.

They also shouldn't drive cars, or fly aircraft, or do anything much 
else in the
world that might not have a perfect outcome.

Its not logical to conclude that something is of zero value if it 
can't be done perfectly. None of us are perfect. We all make value 
judgments to allow us to live in our imperfect world.

Just answer the underlying -technical- question. That's what he asked 
for after all.

Here endeth the sermon :)

Cheers,
Simon

p.s. and in all of that, Ian, you did get the answer you probably 
wanted in the first place, I see - there is something called 
'dansguardian' which might do what you need under Linux, by the sound 
of it.
