Uggg!


We have a Dell Dimension PIII X2 497mhz that is being used as a 
workstation.  When I started doing upgrades on December 23rd, I found 
that when I did a fresh install of SuSE Linux 8.1, the network card, 
which uses the 3c59x module, would not work.  Looking for a quick 
solution, I threw the Lindows 3.0 CD into the computer, and it was ready 
for Internet use in 10 minutes. So my coworker was able to get on the 
net but had to deal with some other practical difficulties until I could 
set his up the way I set up the other machines around the office.

However, I didn't stick with Lindows on that machine, because Lindows 
has a few problems.  First, One very well known problem is that it will 
delete lilo and rewrite the boot sector by merely going into Lindows 
with a zip drive connected. Lindows will end up as the default 
selection, and because we use Linux for fun stuff and a limited amount 
of office work, anything Internet related.  

So, I decided to deal with the situation this weekend.  The first thing 
I decided to do was install SuSE 8.0, which could get on the Internet 
and then upgrade to 8.1, under the assumption that my kernel would still 
be in place, with the module that worked, and edit Lilo and be on my 
merry way. Just to be extra sure that I wouldn't be wasting my time, I 
added another Network card at an open slot, and I could see that the 
card showed green on the back.

Nope! Upon upgrade the old kernel sources were gone along with the 
kernel, and the same situation with the network card came about again. 
Neither of the cards worked at all.

Oh, and when I try to do upgrades in SuSE 8.1, it takes a ridiculously 
long time and says "error!"

Ok, so I tried Mandrake, and I figured that I would use APT-RPM in 
Mandrake.  The only sources.list I could find was out of date, and 
apt-get update never worked. Then I decided that maybe I would install 
Connectiva's crystal icons and the Keramik theme, and although missing 
apt, I figured that the desktop would still be attractive.  I also took 
a quick look to see if PHPGroupware worked, but it didn't at all. But 
when I saw that it didn't have procmail as an installable package,  I 
decided to move on.

My plan was to then set up SuSE 8.0, save the /boot, /lib/modules 
directories and  /etc/modules.conf and then use Apt to upgrade to SuSE 
8.1, and then put the SuSE 8.0 directories and files in place and then 
use Lilo once again.   I followed the instructions in the how to and the 
damn thing crapped out on me. What is so annoying is that it crapped out 
on my right where it said that it might, but the guide said just 
inistall the compatability package, which of course did not work.

I Just finished doing an upgrade install from the SuSE 8.1 CD's , which 
were supposed to take longer than APT, and now I am going to see if the 
plan worked.

Well, I just went over there and renamed the old initrd as initrd2.4.18 
and the old vmlinuz as vmlinuz2.4.18 and I copied them into boot. I 
copied down the old /lib/modules/2.4.18 directory but did not change the 
/etc/modules.conf, but instead set them up in the Yast Control Center. 
 I tested the browser before rebooting, and no luck.  When I set up Lilo 
in Yast, I tried to make the vmlinuz2.4.18 kernel the default, and it 
looked like it worked, but when I rebooted, I didn't see the new Lilo 
description and I saw messages referring to /lib/modules/2.4.18.

But  when I tried the web browser, IT WORKED!  Howl-a-luuuu-ya!

Beats me.  Now I feel like this guy:

Oh well, at least I can document what I did!
