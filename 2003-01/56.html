Quoting Dan Shearer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dan@tellurian.com.au">dan@tellurian.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; You'll probably find everything you need (within th e bounds of what is
&gt; possible) already in libraries and applications that use those libraries.

You could try looking at the source code from any of Kword, Abiword or 
OpenOffice.org - or try the "antiword" project.  I've played with the AbiWord 
source before and it's commented C++.  I've also used "antiword" as a mutt 
filter, but not very succesfully.

Not that this comment will help Antonin with his problem right now, but IIRC a 
couple of months(?) ago there was some collaboration started between Abiword, 
Kword & OpenOffice.org (through the GNOME Office people) to get MS file filters 
into a common library that all could use and improve upon.  But by that time MS 
will have moved on and exbraced-and-extended XML to death and we'll have the 
same problem all over again :-(

mirky on irc            as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition,
                        not smart enough to debug it." -- Brian Kernighan
