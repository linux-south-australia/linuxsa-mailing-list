Jonathan,

&gt; I was wondering if anyone has had any more recent experience with
&gt; either of these system (or Richard, if you were happy with your choice
&gt; of DRBD?, has it been stable? any major problems?)..

The DRBD that was worked on was for kernel series 2.2.X, one of the
later ones if I recall. However at some stage data became corrupted and
DRBD could have been one of the reasons it was corrupted. 

I would refer you to this message:

* <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-08/421.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2000-08/421.html</A>

I think the series of events was more that the data became corrupted
because the hard drive(s) overheated, the system got unstable, the
application data got confused on disk and the confusion was correctly
mirrored to the other machine.

The moral of this story is, that DRBD probably didn't cause the corrupt
data but it DID copy the corruption in 1's and 0's faithfully to the
other disks and made the hot swap copy just as useless as the machine
that died. Had there been a more "lagged" backup strategy--let's say
about 1/2 a day--we might have been able to roll back 1/2 a day and just
lose 1/2 a day's work instead of, if I recall, up to 4 day's work not
including the time taken to diagnose the problem.

I haven't tested DRBD on 2.4.X series but it seems to be supported.

(1) and if you're wondering why I happen to know something about this,
I used to help administer the systems in question. And, yes. The first
thing I would do the moment I walked into the server room was wet my
fingers and check ALL of the hard drive caddy fans :(
