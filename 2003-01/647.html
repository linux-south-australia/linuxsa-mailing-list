Damn, $9,900 for a monitor.

:-D

I am Glad I don't make animations for movies.

&gt;I have been reading the responses to the original posters question, and most 
&gt;seem along the lines of "any reasonable LCD display should work", which is 
&gt;fine and true for those LCD displays with analogue (VGA) connectors.
&gt;
&gt;However I do not know about the rest of you, but if I was going to fork over 
&gt;the money for an LCD display, I would want one with a DVI connector for the 
&gt;best possible picture quality (after all, unless you are desperate to save 
&gt;space, image sharpness is probably your number one goal in buying an LCD 
&gt;display - so why try and re-generate a digital image from an anlogue signal).
&gt;
&gt;At the moment my understanding is that linux support for a full DVI digital 
&gt;signal from the video card is somewhat patchy, and not always supported in 
&gt;the GPL drivers, however if you buy and LCD that supports DVI input, you can 
&gt;always activate it later when you get a new card, or linux support for your 
&gt;particular card comes along.
&gt;
&gt;As an aside, the current king of monitors seems to be made by IBM. Check out 
&gt;the specs (and price - ouch) on this beauty:
&gt;
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.monitoroutlet.com/342898.html">http://www.monitoroutlet.com/342898.html</A>
&gt;
&gt;Now that I have got my own answer to the question out, I can use that as a 
&gt;pretext for my own monitor related musings:
&gt;
&gt;1 .. I have always spent far more money on my monitor that the actual CPU, 
&gt;and never regretted it. Whilst I might upgrade my CPU every 2-3 years, the 
&gt;monitor should last a good 5+ years easily if it is a quality item. I am just 
&gt;at the stage of pondering whether to upgrade my current monitor (a little 
&gt;known brand, Cornerstone, but very good specs and quality) to an LCD. However 
&gt;my gut feeling is to leave the LCD display for another 18 months, and since 
&gt;my current monitor is still going great guns, I might as well. 
&gt;
&gt;However when I do buy an LCD display, I will try and select the biggest, best 
&gt;quality one I can afford, as I will be looking at it for a long time. 
&gt;
&gt;As far as Computer hardware goes, I personally have a philosophy that the 
&gt;three most important items are (1) the monitor, (2) the chair !, and (3) the 
&gt;keyboard. 
&gt;
&gt;So long as the CPU is reliable and reasonable speed, it is not really that 
&gt;important to me personally (well, with the exception that it should be as 
&gt;quiet as realistically possible). I understand that other people have other 
&gt;priorities, especially if they are heavily into gaming or number crunching, 
&gt;but if you are at you workstation for any length of time I think that comfort 
&gt;and ergonomics are an important factor.
&gt;
&gt;2 .. If I do go out and buy an LCD display, even one coupled to a fully 
&gt;digital output, there is still the odd concept of "refresh rates" for the 
&gt;display and card. 
&gt;
&gt;To quote Seinfeld, "what is the deal there ?". I would have though having a 
&gt;fully digital LCD display would make video card design (at least the output 
&gt;stage) so much easier. Can't we now directly correlate LCD pixels with video 
&gt;card memory, and only update the display when an area of memory changes ? No 
&gt;RAMDACs, at least.
&gt;
&gt;Why update the LCD display 60/70/85 times a second when mostly (except for 
&gt;movies and games) it never changes ? If I open a new window in whatever 
&gt;window manager I am using, the video RAM changes just where the window is 
&gt;opened - can't the card notice this and say to the LCD "change pixels x-y". 
&gt;If no other pixels change for 30 seconds, then no further comms between the 
&gt;LCD and card should be needed for that time.
&gt;
&gt;It is easy for an armchair engineer to say these sort of things, and I am 
&gt;sure there sound reasons for how things are done currently, it is just 
&gt;puzzling. 
&gt;
&gt;If next week there was a breakthough in LCD design that greatly increases 
&gt;resolution (eg by decreasing pixel pitch, or allows fabbing of enormous 
&gt;displays, or a combination of both) we would currently have no way of driving 
&gt;all those pixels through the current interface technology (although 
&gt;converting all window mangers and applications to fully vector based system 
&gt;to take advantage of the increased resolution would also be a small problem !)
&gt;
&gt;The IBM monitor mentioned above only works at its highest resolution when 
&gt;driven in a tiled or striped mode by *multiple* video cards, and I believe 
&gt;that one of the reasons is that the max bandwith suppored by the DVI spec is 
&gt;not enough to drive that many pixels at a reasonable refresh rate.
&gt;
&gt;So we still have a way to go I think .. but is interesting to see the tech 
&gt;emerge. Just my 2c.
