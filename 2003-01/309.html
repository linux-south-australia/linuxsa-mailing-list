Like many things in life, this is an oversimplification - albeit an 
understandable one.

Well, I'll try - but at the end of the day, you are responsible for 
your own emotions in the main :)


First: In the below I'm speaking for me, noone else, and I'm not 
directing any 'other ISP's do...' comments at Adam, or at any other 
specific ISP. I'm just addressing the request that I respond from my 
(Internode) point of view.

There are both technical, economic, and resource utilisation grounds 
for having a static IP address as one of the distinctions between the 
Internode personal and business DSL services.

In reverse order:

Resource Utilisation: IPv4 addresses are NOT free. Not Not Not Not. 
IPv4 Addresses are very finite indeed.

Of course all the 'old school' has their old IP allocations lying 
around and they aren't about to return them to the pool of 
unallocated IP's in a hurry - why would you, they didn't previously 
have any cost on them.

These days they do have a cost - APNIC membership isn't free by any 
means (APNIC perform Asia-Pac IP allocation services these days), and 
the reason they aren't free (and more importantly, exist to put ISP's 
through the third degree when they ask for more IP blocks) is that 
they'll run out.

Its remarkably like conservation of old growth forests - when we're 
out of these things, there ARE NO MORE OF THEM.

ISP's who don't appreciate this point are misguided or wrong (or very 
very small - so small that they think that a Class-C allocation is 
actually a lot of IP's, or they've borrowed a Class-C from another 
mate's cat to start their ISP with).

Sure, if you have a business need and you want to talk a /26 out of 
an ISP from their provider block, you usually can. But try talking 
them out of a /16.

The Internode Business ADSL services offer Static IP's over bridged 
DSL link which provides direct layer 3 IP (non-PPPoE) Internet 
access. To do this, for  single customer with a single IP address, we 
have to burn FOUR IP's out of the global pool because we route you a 
full IP subnet to deliver that IP:

- A reserved IP address (this is how IP subnets work)
- Your IP
- Our default router IP in your assigned range
- The broadcast IP address for your assigned range.

So that one static IP customer costs 4 of those finite addresses out 
of the pool, forever - not just one.

[We've got a new business service in the works using PPPoE which will 
allow us to reduce that to 1 IP used, because PPP lets us achieve 
that outcome, at the cost of having to run a PPPoE client at the 
business customers' end of the link - and given the above, you can 
see why - every additional 64 business customers burns an additional 
class-C right now]

A dynamic IP customer, on the other hand:

- Burns one IP at the most
- Actually burns LESS than one IP on average because (contrary to 
what folk on this list might expect), most 'average' people don't 
surf 24x7, and will turn off their PC (and free up the IP it was 
using) quite frequently. So frequently that the average consumption 
factor of IP's per dynamic IP customer is probably somewhat below 50%.

The distinction here that leads to this latter effect is that while 
most "LinuxSA" folk are likely to want 24x7 "Always On" Internet to 
their Linux server, most non-Linux folk - the great numerical 
majority of Personal ADSL customers - just want 'Always Available on 
Demand' internet access - and they really DO turn their PC's off at 
night when they got to bed.

The nett effect of this is that a single Internode Business ADSL 
customer burns about *eight times* (probably more) of the share of 
the global IP pool that a Dynamic IP customer does (4:1 plus that 50% 
factor - which is conservative)

Economic (1): The result of the above is that the effective cost of 
an IP address is rising over time, and the effective cost of a 
business IP service is therefore rising at about 8 times the rate of 
a dynamic one - all as an inverse function of the number of them that 
are left. Anyone who doesn't think that the 'last' class-C is going 
to be very, very expensive doesn't understand the seriousness of the 
problem yet...

... Just like people buying tables made from old-growth forests don't 
give a shit about the forests, just as long as they get THEIR table 
made first.

Economic (2): Personal ADSL plans are generally knife-edge in 
economic terms (really - these aren't huge profit centers at all). 
And more specifically, whether Personal ADSL plans make, or lose, 
money is a direct function of the -average- downloading habits of the 
customer base concerned. The Personal plans are based on the average 
economics being consistent (again, on average) with single users (or 
single families) downloading stuff they rationally need.

The business plans run on completely different QoS, peak-time-of-day, 
peak demand, average demand, and total download factors. Business use 
the Internet -differently-.

To try to encourage folk to sit in the plan that will suit them, and 
that we can sustainably keep offering them, as well, we can try 
putting in silly AUP's about not using home plans for business 
purposes all we like... (which we used to do but we don't do any 
more)...

... but in the end, the only thing that's likely to help to constrain 
folk with no life and/or no sense of civility from buying a Personal 
ADSL plan and running their massive business on it is the lack of a 
Static IP, frankly.

This might not matter to an ISP that cares less about business ADSL 
QoS than we do. That's their choice (and that of their customers). It 
isn't our choice (or the choice of most of our business customers).

So its an intentional distinction, sure, and one that is necessary in 
a world with enough bastards in it to make life difficult for the 
(reasonable) majority.

Its also the case that in a world where IP allocations -are- 
expensive (and increasingly so), having about 1/8th of the 
incremental cost in supporting the IP for your dynamic ADSL plan also 
DOES help keep the cost of that down. It also lets us remap the IP 
allocations over time to more efficiently rework our allocations of 
IP addresses so we need to ask less often for more of them from APNIC 
- without renumbering the networks of all of our Business ADSL 
customers for them, at our expense, as well.

A business static IP customer wants their IP address to change 
-never- (including when we have a spring clean in our IP 
allocations). And they pay more for that simple life. This is called 
Business Value Add, and if you don't think that this is worth 
something, that's fine, but you probably also aren't running your own 
business.

Hackers here on LinuxSA are not being targetted with the lack of a 
static IP - you represent a small demographic that isn't a 
conventional 'home' ADSL user (who are usually information 
'consumers' only, not information producers in the main).

LinuxSA members are also not a conventional 'business' ADSL user 
(with heaps of mission critical stuff to move back and forth that 
requires a static IP to make it work), but they frequently would like 
a static IP so they can fiddle with things for which a static IP 
makes things easier to do.

So in the demographic here, we have 'Linux' people - smart enough to 
be cool with finding a fix, and not interested in paying much more 
for a static IP because they just want to fiddle with a few small 
personal servers anyway, i.e. the Static IP is optional, but 
preferable, but there is no budget to pay for it.

The fix for technically astute folks here is the obvious, and 
popular, one - use one of the (many) dynamic DNS tracking services on 
the Internet and make the issue almost completely disappear as a 
result.

Would a major business want to rely on a third party dyn-dns service? 
Nope - which is what the Internode Static IP Business ADSL services 
are for - giving businesses a simple and effective life, at a price 
point sufficient to ensure that we're still around to support them as 
they use it, and to support their often very large demands on both 
network capacity and technical support.

This is also why most 'real' businesses just chose the Business ADSL 
service - because it provides a simple life, very high QoS, and costs 
way way less than ISDN permanent links, while delivering huge 
performance 24x7. Our Business ADSL services are not targetted to 
home users who wish they had a static IP, they're for a completely 
different market.

Technical: Running subnets to Business customers creates a number of 
technical complications that mirror the resulting simplicity of 
access for the customers concerned - some of which is hinted at 
above. Including a pretty major chunk of IP 
allocation/assignment/management magic dust.

We do (again as already noted) plan to generate a new Business plan 
running over PPPoE, mostly to drop that IP 'wastage' from 4:1 down to 
1:1 (it also makes a few other business value-adds a bit simpler to 
provide as well - like routing of additional IP ranges, access 
filters, etc etc).

PPP based dynamic (pool) allocation is far simpler for us to manage, 
in a world where the number of Personal customers will (of course) 
greatly outnumber the business customer count going forward. And in 
some senses, PPP based business IP services will be easier to manage 
for us and for our customers in the future too.

Yes, some ISP's chose to charge less for a static IP (in some cases, 
its a built in feature for 'free').

If those other ISP's have some IP's left to burn (and remember, 
again, that static home customers cost the Internet at large the loss 
of that IP 24x7, even if they aren't actually logged in 24x7), that's 
their perogative. It isn't sustainable, but nothing in the capitalist 
society we live in prohibits business from making bad or 
un-sustainable decisions - or prohibits their customers from 
exploiting those decisions to the maximum extent that they can.

Static IP ain't free, even if some other ISP pretends that it is. 
That's the bottom line.

And for LinuxSA folk who want to run some servers at home - we 
(Internode) are all for it, those of you who have known me for a 
while know that I'm highly supportive of technical communities at 
many many levels, and that I'm very much a 'propeller head' CEO at 
Internode. But I've still got a business to sustain. The only way to 
last this long in the industry is to be capable of balancing business 
and technical drivers so that they both remain sustainable.

The compromise is simple:

- We need to make rational business decisions to ensure we remain 
here in the long term (approaching 12 years and counting). We plan to 
stay around.

- We'll support the interests of 'propeller head' customers (people 
like me!) just as far as we can, commensurate with being able to 
afford to provide them the high quality that they've become rightly 
accustomed to with Internode. For  'personal' servers, we:

    - Don't block any ports (many ISP's do), to let you run those servers at all

    - Are happy for you to go and sign with a dynamic DNS provider if 
you want a fairly stable DNS name for your server(s)

    - Are happy to (and explicitly do) support customers connecting to 
us with non-Windows operating systems (very much including Linux). 
Try asking Big Pond to support your Linux PCI ADSL card into their 
ADSL service, if you enjoy rejection.

Go back and take a look at who sponsored the last Installfest, guys. 
We're on your side. But remember that money doesn't grow on trees - 
just like IP addresses don't. Life involves a rational compromise 
between conflicting drivers.

Cheers,
Simon

p.s. The real answer here to some of this - but not all of it - is 
IPv6. Some of us helped to design it, many many years ago, when the 
majority had no idea why we were involved in doing so. That reason is 
coming into pretty sharp focus now - and yet again the 'internet old 
boys' have fixed something before most punters realised that a 
problem existed :) IPv6 clients are now embedded quietly in the 
latest versions of both Windows and Mac OS, so when it really gets to 
be a hassle, the answer is 'in there' waiting to get out in its own 
good time.
