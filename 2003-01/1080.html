Um, I cam back on the 9 AM flight ex Perth on Sunday. Actually 7 of us
came back on the same flight. We did try to hook up laptops into a
network but we had all packed our crossover cables &lt;G&gt;
It was suggested that perhaps a battery powered AP might be handy for
trips like these so we could all go WiFi but there was the thought that
such a device might just upset some of the planes electronic gizzmos.

&gt; we all knew about that already

I was also posting it because of the accusative nature of the comments
that had been posted on ZDNet and my wonder if such comments were valid
or perhaps just people shouting out loud for the sake of it.

&gt; I'd rather hear about your adventures at linuxconf 

Mmm, OK, putting together some stories now. See how things go over the
next few days. 

We have a panic on right now as we lose our community workshop space on
31 Jan and I need to find storage for 30 something computers and bits.
Anybody know of any locations in Salisbury area that we could use for a
short while till we get into more permanent premises?

Cheers,  Ian
