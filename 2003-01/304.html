&gt;I have been wondering what video card to get.
&gt;
&gt;I have a powerfull box that I am building gradually.  I am ready for the video card.
&gt; - I dont play games.
&gt; - I watch DVDs and videos.
&gt; - I'd like to do some video editing.
&gt; - I want to use my s-video/svga capable digital projector.
&gt;
&gt;Multiheaded X would be nice - I would consider buying an X server.
&gt;
&gt;I have tried to find an explination of the differences between SDL and openGL and I guess I have
&gt;concluded that these things are used by game coders to get directX like control of the hardware.
&gt;
&gt;What I want to know is what do I need to know about which video card works best with x windows.
&gt;which ones supply linux drivers, and which of these are worth it.
&gt;
&gt;I currently use a windows 2000 laptop to play DVDs, and am generally saisfied.  There are things
&gt;that bug me, but they are hardware things, not software things.
&gt;
&gt;In considering this, I remember a time when you used to buy DVD decoder cards, and they would
&gt;supply svideo out, as well as digital audio out.  This is what I want.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I am looking for some help from people who are up to date with the hardware/linux relationships.
&gt;
&gt;Any pointers appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Also, directed replies to me (as apposed to just the list) would be appreciate.  I get the list in
&gt;digest form......
