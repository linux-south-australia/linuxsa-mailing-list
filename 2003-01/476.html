Adam,

&gt; couldn't be easily searched by means of a search engine.  There were
&gt; always plans to try TWiki on Apache however that never got off the
&gt; ground.  Now that the "portability" factor has come in, the plans are
&gt; changing.

Twiki running on Apache is quite good.

&gt; and although I often do my best to convince him, it's hard to do it
&gt; because he's seen me grow in the last two years from a young boi with
&gt; skills that hardly went past Windows, to a Systems Administrator who
&gt; has put so much improvement into our network, develop skills in using
&gt; Unix and networking technologies.  I've learned so much, but my advice
&gt; is not always completely agreed upon, because my boss knows the extent
&gt; of my skill-base

I'm not sure whether that has anything to do with your skill base; it
seems endemic across all disciplines that management has a knack of
ignoring good advice regardless of whether it's from young system
administrators or highly paid consultants.

At other times, management just listens and says "yes".
