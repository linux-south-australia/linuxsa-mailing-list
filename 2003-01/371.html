&gt; &gt; So all in all, supporting bridging on wireless interfaces was, until
&gt; &gt; relatively recently, "all too hard".  The situation might have changed
&gt; &gt; now (otherwise the Linux access point project wouldn't have any legs),
&gt; &gt; but there's no reason to believe that all the drivers on all operating
&gt; &gt; system platforms will be updated RIGHT NOW to suit the new world order.
&gt;
&gt; I believe that FreeBSD and Linux both support host ap on cards based on
&gt; the same chipset as the Dlink DWL 520's. Air-Stream have a few of these
&gt; running in their network.
&gt;
&gt; DSL
&gt;
&gt; [memory says it's a prism chipset but I think prisms come in prism1's and
&gt; prism2's...]
&gt;

That is correct, i have a freeBSD machine running beaut as a hostAP, could
not ask for any thing better i think ( well maybe if it made coffee, but
that is pushing it too far i think) It is running freeBSD 4.7 STABLE with
a d-link DWL520 that the friendly ppl at microbits supplied.

I guess it was a tad confusing, cause the FreeBSD manual tells you to
bridge the interfaces, but the 'man bridge' says that you cant bridge wi0.
AFAIKS the hostAP does do something resembling bridging, the single
clients who log in (using infrastructure mode, they are all running XP)
can see and browse my samba shares on 3 different machines on my local
LAN, which is very cool, they can even access my proxy server, and get out
to the net (I choose not to NAT on my internet gateway/firewall for that
obvious reason :))

WinXP has a 'feature' where you can 'create a network bridge' by
highlighting then right clicking -&gt; create network bridge or something
(please excuse my lack of details, its all a bit to point and click for me
:)) On my friends Athalon1800 it churns away for about a minuite
doing_something then pops up with a 'network bridge' icon. I have no idea
what it did, but whatever it was, its not very effective cause it didnt
seem to work (suprise suprise)

When a remote LAN wants to join my LAN, this is where i needed to either
1. Setup a Freebsd client that logs into my hostAP and 'bridges' its
network cards, so we can all see each other,
2. Try to set up another hostAP at the remote site, exactly the same as
the one here, and *try* to get it to talk to my hostAP (dunno if this is
possible, i need to do more reading on this),or
3. Get all the remote clients to have their own wireless cards, and log in
infrastucture mode to my hostAP.

The last idea, albeit more expensive, and less geeky is probably the
easiest, but i like a challenge, so id rather put a Freebsd router at the
remote site, also give me some more control, and places to locally store
stuff like common files / antivirus updates on 'that_end_of_the_link' :)

Static routing is still an option, and im looking into this now aswell.

Hope everyone has a nice thursday, im off to the beach (holidays are good)

Cheers,


drew
