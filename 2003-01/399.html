&gt; Disaster!!
&gt; 
&gt; Ugh.  My boss has gone directly to one of our Technical Writing staff to
&gt; try and organize the creation of a "knowledgebase."
&gt; 
&gt; This is disastrous, because I've had phone calls and I've had questions
&gt; from him regarding the following two technologies which are making me
&gt; dry reech as I type this email:
&gt; 
&gt;  - IIS 5.0
&gt;  - Compiled HTML or Compiled Help or whatever it is.
&gt; 
&gt; They basically want a knowledgebase that can be browsed/searched online
&gt; via our Intranet (which would now have to incorporate IIS.. rip my heart
&gt; out) and then they want a version of it which can be portable -- so that
&gt; our site guys can take it away with them and use it whenever they are on
&gt; site.  They modeled it on the Citect Knowledgebase (www.citect.com)
&gt; which is exactly what they want to replicate.
&gt; 
&gt; His answer is to use a product called Doc2Help (blech!) which generates
&gt; Windows Help files and HTML navigational things out of Word Documents.
&gt; So basically the answer according to him is to create WORD documents,
&gt; generate them into some CHF navigationable/searchable engine and compile
&gt; it into a distributable format.  All of which it's able to do, but
&gt; really grossly and disturbingly.
&gt; 
&gt; My obvious answer would be to create a php front-end to a MySQL database
&gt; and just store all the articles in there, be able to search it, edit it,
&gt; whatever using our Intranet.  The problem is, what about the portable
&gt; version they want?
&gt; 
&gt; What can I suggest that will make this hideous nightmare go away? lol

my gut reaction to the situation like this is deploy a wiki
of some sort. there are many versions about these days.

but, more importantly remember that a twiki or wiki is a 
draft document preparation tool.

it is not the kind of tool to deploy for your final product.

=)

of course the "documents" can be redeployed into another format
at a later stage =)

try to reinforce that word documents and windowswankhelpfiles
do not work well with revision control systems and "quality control"
wth multiple documetn editors

try to lever the aspect of peer review and document standards *and*
revision control ...

windows based document control software costs a fortune!
and licencing is a nightmare...

a wiki costs nothing and does most of the above fairly well
for small groups of people ~5-15 on a project
and you can run several wikis independantly on a given server
for thousands of documents/pages/topics

maybe you could deploy a wiki, then use the ploy,
"but we already have a draft document control system"

there are tools to rip the copntents of wikis and create
flat html... especially for CDs

there are also lots of "web page control" systems but a wiki
is far easier to setup and maintain

there wikis that do full user/pw/group authentication for page
and heirachies of pages... but as always YMMV

cheers,

kim
