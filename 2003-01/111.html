I know about the Fresnel effect. That's why it'd be at the edge of the 
building.

&gt; b) won't allow you to communicate to another AP (you need a wireless 
&gt; bridge
&gt; for that).

Look up mesh networks. Buy the same brand of AP to minimise 
compatibility problems, and buy the brand that works.

&gt; If you run links via a telco then $100k is going to get used up pretty
&gt; quick.

Depends if it's a PAPL link or not. It also has the upside of 
continuing to work even when it rains or someone cooks a meal in their 
microwave. For that reason, a Telstra link is still going to be needed 
as a backup (ISDN or broadband) to ensure reliability.

Government grants are funded to a time scale, so a cheaper option for a 
few years is going to win over a more expensive option that lasts for 
10 years. There's no point in spending a fortune on an expensive 
solution that may be completely obsolete in 5 years, especially when 
it's a technology solution.

There's also the further option of finding existing towers and running 
dual-hops. Place an AP on the existing tower, and point the building AP 
at the tower.

&gt; Umm, much of a muchness.  Fibre's not cheap.  Probably more than low 
&gt; loss.
&gt; (termination costs mostly)

Fibre is about $100 for a 10m cable up to about $200 for a 100m cable. 
Laying fibre is expensive unless there's an existing cabling run.

Let's concentrate on feeding information to Ian. If you feel I've left 
a few things out, please add or replace my costings with your own.

At this point, I don't have anything else I want to say.
