&gt; WTF? Why would they be different? They are identical drives! Is there
&gt; something else there that may be interfereing -- maybe the CDROM or
&gt; the CDRW (The CDROM is quite new, and is on hdb, whereas the CDRW is
&gt; older, and on hdd -- and besides, the slave shouldn't affect the
&gt; master, as it's the masters' controller that is used for both master
&gt; and slave (hence the names), correct?)... Could it have something to
&gt; do with the RAID driver? Hmmm... any other ideas?

A quirk of the ide chipset when dealing with unsupported modes? I wouldnt read too much in to that when you _know_ the motherboard isnt capable of dealing with it anyway. Try swapping them over and see if the extra modes follow the drive. If so, check the drives firmware revisions..

The master and slave is more to do with addressing and termination than which actual controller gets used. The drives controller handles the hardware local to the drive and serves it up in a nice Logical Block Addresses (LBA) way [1].

Ant

[1] Unless backwards compatability is required, when they still do Cylinder Head Sector (CHS) adressing, but the values here are rubbish anyway as the aim is to fit as much space in to the highly limited address space available using this scheme. EG, they max out the "heads" field and the drives controller does all the translation anyway... No other drives controller could do this.
