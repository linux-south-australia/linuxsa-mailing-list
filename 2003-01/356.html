Extract from the latest Lindows newsletter: 
"Desktop Linux Summit is the watershed moment for Linux on the desktop
(Microsoft guarantees it!)

I recently spent some time with a major hardware vendor who talked with
excitement about the savings that Linux can bring as they build more
affordable computing devices. This company is a big believer in Linux,
but they sheepishly confessed that they weren't yet a sponsor of the
Desktop Linux Summit (Feb 20-21st, 2003 in San Diego). They explained to
me that Microsoft had called them up and told them not to lend their
support to this event and discouraged them from attending. At first, I
was aghast that Microsoft employees would be spending their time
disinviting companies from attending the Summit. But then it got me
thinking that it actually was a good indicator. If Linux wasn't ready
for the desktop, then MS would be happy to have people spend 2 days in
sunny San Diego because they would witness first hand the state of
desktop Linux.

The opposite of course is true. Microsoft is fearful that attendees will
find out that Linux is now no longer just about the server - that it's
ready for the desktop. It hasn't been this way in the past, but the
stars have aligned and all the pieces have come together (user
interface, programs, hardware support, retailers, etc.) to reinvigorate
competition in the operating system business. It reminds me of the first
MP3 Summit we planned at MP3.com. Before that event, MP3 was a geek
novelty. But we invited everyone - yes, even the media companies and the
RIAA that were not fond of MP3 - to that first event. After that first
conference it was clear we had given MP3 a huge boost in momentum and
propelled it into the industry standard it is today.

The Desktop Linux Summit is open to all companies who wish to attend -
yes, even Microsoft. (I personally think it would be smart for Microsoft
to release their own desktop Linux product.) While I'm not sure Bill G.
will accept our invitation to speak, I am confident that Microsoft will
have attendees in the audience at the Desktop Linux Summit, quietly
taking notes of where the industry is at. I hope you'll be there too.

Michael Robertson"

Now isn't that an interesting sutuation.

cheers, Ian
