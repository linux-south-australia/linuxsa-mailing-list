Hi

Thanks for your post, looking in my php.ini file, register_globals is currently
set to On, I may have changed it last week while playing with it.

After much searching through mysql etc, it came back to being an incorrect
layout in the database. There must be an error in the file I used to import the
layout and sample data. Initially when I read the documentation it stated that
if you download version 4, there is a problem with the layout and an
upgrade/change of the database needs to be done. I downloaded version 5 in
which it stated the correction had been made, but after importing the update
for version 4, it fixed my the problem. I guess that fix had not been applied
to 5 like stated.

Thanks for your suggestions anyway - appreciated.

Wayne

 &gt; I had a look at <A HREF="http://websight.sourceforge.net/">http://websight.sourceforge.net/</A> which was ideal, but
somes up
 &gt; with errors after installation.

not necessarily the answer you are after, but, I have found that most
php scripts I have downloaded were designed to work with
register_globals On and the default php install now has register_globals
Off for added security when passing variables.
I havent checked the websight scripts at all, so it could be something
totally different, but it is a simple thing to try;
edit your php.ini, find register_globals and change the Off to On, save
and reload the page(s) in your browser, if it wworks, thats the problem,
leaving you two options, leave register_globals on or re-write it all to
work with it switched off.
I do believe there are also some lines of code you can insert into each
page to emulate register globals on, even when its off, check their
website for that one.

BUT, before you do anything, you should read about the possible security
implications of using register_globals, it should be on the php.net
website about here;
<A HREF="http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.registerglobals.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.registerglobals.php</A>

alternatively you could post some of the errors to indicate where it is
going wrong?
