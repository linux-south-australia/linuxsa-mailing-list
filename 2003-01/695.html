&gt; I don't know a whole lot about the -650 cards, but I'd strongly suggest you
&gt; going to a 2.4.x series kernel.

2.2's an invariant - Oracle 8.1.7 isn't (wasn't?) certified to run on
later versions, nor are the binary only applications I'm running.

&gt; My experiences with wireless on 2.2.x have been flakey at best.

linux-wlang actually test against 2.2 series kernels (although I
could be confused, because I've come up to speed on this real-
quick, read a lot of doco, and probably have it all muddled in
my head).

&gt; Bit of information for orinoco/cabletron/enterasys users (I'm guessing the
&gt; - -650 is a prism, so it won't apply...)

Prism 2.5.

&gt; (there are 3.2.1
&gt; patches, but I had problems with iwpriv, 3.1.34 runs perfect).

That was my biggest waste of time - the iw* tools only partially
work with the linux-wlan drivers, and they in fact supply their
own preferred management tools.  But the pcmcia stuff didn't
install correctly, and was trying to use iwconfig & friends to
configure the card.  Grrr.

&gt; 4. Restart pcmcia, throw your card in, it *should* come up.  Try running
&gt; iwpriv &lt;device&gt;, and see if you've got a "monitor" there down the bottom.

It all seems to run fine until I leave it idle (I haven't seriously
stressed it - at least, not as much as it's stressed me).
