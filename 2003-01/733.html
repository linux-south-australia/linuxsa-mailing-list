IMHO its the SIS hardware.
I have even seen some SIS hardware die just from unplugging it and plugging
it back in again. Reboots (for Windows) didnt even fix it.
The only way to fix the issue was to set the nic to 10 half and cold boot.
( even after that going back to auto (100) didnt work) strange gear, avoid
it especially the early SIS boards.

Hello all,

My laptop (SIS chipset) is doing strange things on my network. I have it
connected to a switch (low cost 100mb switch) and up to three other
computers at any time. The laptop seems to loose its network connection
from
time to time.

*     When this happens, the laptop has trouble sending and receiving
pings (as used in my testing). It seems that other computers have the same
trouble at this time also.

*     I have disconnected other computers and it seems that it is for-sure
the laptop causing it. either that or the hub and laptop don't like each
other.

*     Restarting the network (#service network restart) fixes this problem
until next time. It only seems to happen in Linux and not windows.

*     I can force this problem to reoccur by changing ports in the hub or
otherwise disconnecting and reconnecting the laptop to the hub.

I am running redhat 8.0 on a leader/excel sis laptop.

Any ideas?

AG
