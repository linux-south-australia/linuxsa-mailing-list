&gt; &gt; The good thing about the British regime is not the so-called "choice"
&gt; &gt; but the results of our centuries-old tradition of not taking shit from
&gt; &gt; our rulers, so that people can blockade refineries in protest about
&gt; &gt; petrol prices and not get shot. This tradition seems to have been
&gt; &gt; exported pretty well to Australia. Not so well to America, where a lot
&gt; &gt; of the population were refugees from a tradition of being shat on by
&gt; &gt; their rulers all the time and not getting any effective opposition
&gt; &gt; together.
&gt; 
&gt; This has to be one of the most simplistic and sweeping generalizations I 
&gt; have ever heard. It certainly betrays a lack of knowledge of the American 
&gt; character and system of government.
&gt; 
&gt; Quick hint: Despite their behaviour overseas, they are not all ignorant 
&gt; loud mouths :-)

Argh what did I say wrong? I wasn't intending to imply that all
Americans are ignorant loudmouths. Those I have met or conversed with
seem to be just as reasonable as non-Americans. I may have a problem
with American _politicians_, but then I have a problem with lots of
politicians, British ones not excepted!

Maybe I should have made it clearer that I was talking about
relatively small differences between countries that are right at the
opposite end of the spectrum from regimes like, say, China as
exemplified by Tiananmen Square.

Nor did I mean that the British regime was perfect! I acknowledge that
freedom is written into the American constitution at a fundamental
level, whereas Britain doesn't even have a constitution like that. But:
a) I find it hard to imagine something like the McCarthy era taking
place in Britain, and
b) I think this must be connected (to some extent at least) with the
inherited traditions of the people living in the countries concerned.

Obstinacy is an ancient British tradition. It's not always a good
thing, but it does mean that British rulers began to find it hard to
shit on the people way before the rulers of neighbouring countries. I
think that part of the reason Hitler pussyfooted around over invading
Britain was that he realised imposing Nazism on the British would be
an infuriatingly difficult job, especially given the uncomfortable and
suppressed result from his racial theories that actually put the
British ahead of the Germans. (Before someone else misunderstands me,
I'm NOT saying "Yay, Britain is great, because Hitler said so!")

The current ruling population of Australia is of largely British
descent, so this tradition has been exported along with the people
pretty much intact. But a large part of the American population
descends from people who were refugees from places *without* the
tradition of not letting your rulers shit on you - often this is why
they were seeking refuge. (eg: There are still quite a few ordinary
Russians who actually revere Stalin and refuse to acknowledge anything
bad about him; this was also the case with people like Ivan the
Terrible, and most of the other awful rulers the Russians have had.)

Is it an offensive generalisation to say that the modern American
tradition shows elements of the traditions from whose blending it is
descended? I apologise if it seems that way, but to me it simply seems
like a logical and wholly expected fact. People with different
histories are different people - how could it be otherwise?

Again I apologise if I've trod on anyone's toes. I'm trying not to but
I don't seem to always be able to write in such a way that everyone
reading it thinks I meant what I thought I meant; hopefully the
misunderstandongs wouldn't arise if we were talking face to face.
