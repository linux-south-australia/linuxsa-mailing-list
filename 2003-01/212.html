&gt; &gt; Anyway, bridging is still useful every now and then.
&gt; 
&gt; bridging was an intermediate step introduced to patch a hardware
&gt; media limitation.
&gt; 
&gt; i would suspect that a routed network would make more sense in 
&gt; the example above.

Perhaps, but the effort that would need to be undertaken would be
ridiculous. As it happens, the particular scenario involved a public
school, already crippled by SINA.

&gt; especially that the groups of people working in building A and C
&gt; would be working in different tasks or groups and requiring different
&gt; services/servers, the need to be on the same logical ethernet segment
&gt; does not make a great deal of sense ... IMHO

Not in this case. Students all do the same things.

&gt; but they will need to access common resorces. and the only thing
&gt; that will need to have access to both networks is a samba server,
&gt; the rest can be accomodated by sensible network design... and routing.
&gt; there are ways and means to get a samba server to talk "locally" on
&gt; distant networks ;)

Oh, I know. We *did* end up solving the problem in the end using
routing, but it would have been much easier to just go:

# sysctl net.whatever.something.bridging=1
# sysctl net.whatever.something.bridgcfg=xl0,wi0

...than to have to stuff around with routing. All I really wanted in
this case was a "software" media converter.
