&gt; Can you *really* see a future for them

Apples and oranges.
Apples as you, DSL, myself and others want to see. An unfettered
Internet. Great, in private.

What people look at in their own houses is their business. The project
manages public access computers in 3 private houses and there isn't any
access controls on any of them. 

Oranges that I am talking about. Internet with responsibility.
The project runs 2 computers as public access machines in public places.
Both the public access machines in the public places run Internet
Security by Norton. 

It would be highly irresponsible for our project to run these public
machines without any attempt to control the access to unsavoury sites.
It would not only stupid of us to attempt that it would also be very
likely to land us in hot water the first time a less responsible person
accessed unsavoury pictures where other public could see them. It is
just too wrong to consider the public machines as open as the machines
in private houses. Apples and oranges.

I am not discussing the machines in the private houses, I have always
been very clear that I am talking about the computers that are required
to run in full public view. 

It is with that aspect and only that aspect that led me to approach the
list seeking help to set up a Linux box that not only remained secure
from inteference but it also would prevent/strongly limit access to
unsavoury sites. 

Now how can such an aspect go against the goal of breaking the digital
divide when reaching out to the public in an open area and without
restriction on who can utilise the computers? It doesn't. It seeks to
provide the best Internet access we can provide while recognising that
the community will not tolerate open display of porn. 

Taking this aspect for a public computer and applying private home
computer standards might be good for your arguments but it doesn't help
me achieve my goal of bringing Linux into the public venues. 

Lets accept that the community standards for public display must apply
in these cases and go onto how I can best utilise such agents as
DansGuardian which do seek to address the issues that are being put
forward.

Cheers, Ian
