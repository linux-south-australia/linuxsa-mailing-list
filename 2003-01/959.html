&gt; Interesting comment.

Which, David's comment or my quoting of it?

&gt; Have you spoken to Dan Shearer lately?

Regarding ... ?

&gt; There is no question you CAN "buy a support contract for"  Linux.
&gt; It's just a tad harder to find, perhaps?

There's relatively no problem buying support contracts for Open Source
stuff.  The problem is that relatively few corporate middle managers
are going to do it.  Having a contract with IBM/HP/Sun/MS/etc is S.O.P.
Having a support contract for Linux is still seen as a "courageous
decision" (in every bit of the "Yes, Minister" meaning) unless it's
one of the above supplying it, and they offer perfectly functional
alternatives (well, mostly).

I've heard that (I think it was) Firewall-1 now has Linux as it's
primary support platform, followed by Sun then MS, and yet I know of
a company that considers the choice of OS is between #2 and #3 (i.e.
#1 is out of the picture).

&gt; FWIW I think Linux might well threaten Unix as well as M$.

Undoubtedly.
