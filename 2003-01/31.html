&gt;&gt; I don't read them as blaming SMTP.

&gt; Is UUCP email unaffected by the problem?

Does exchange *have* a UUCP email import?  I never heard of it
if they do!


&gt; It's an RFC822 interpretation "issue" on their part

Nonsense.  BTW RFC822 has been superceeded by RFC2822, which they correctly
interpret.  Ther mention of SMTP merely serves to state that the problem
occurs when messages are delivered using that protocol.  They didn't blame
SMTP; they stated the bounds of the problem.

&gt;&gt; It's nice when the sender whips the output of uudecode into /bin/mail
&gt;&gt; and I can merely click on an attacment to access the original document.

&gt; Even though its not sent as an attachment.  I believe that if it was
&gt; supposed to have been sent as an attachment, then send it as such, not
&gt; to have the client second guess the intentions (and then get it wrong).

Well yes, if they're going to second guess the intentions they should at
least get it right.  I still appreciate the attempt.
