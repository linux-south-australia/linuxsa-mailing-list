Yeah I am stuck. :-(

Recently I was able to set up a web based program called timesheet.php. 
I posted the details of that here:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-01/47.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2003-01/47.html</A>

I am trying to convert two Micro$oft Acce$$ databases over to the 
timesheet.php program I set up.

I went to MySQL.com and installed MyODBC and tried to follow the 
procedures outlined here:

<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?q">http://groups.google.com/groups?q</A>=MS+Access----%3E+MySQL%3F+Paul+Law&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=Tmia6.4077%24vH6.78368%40news6-win.server.ntlworld.com&rnum=1

However when I got to the oint where I was goint to export the data to 
the MySQL database on the server,  it said "ODBC--call failed. 
 [TCX][MyODBC]Host '192.168.88.44' is not allowed  to connect to this 
MySQL server (#1130)

So I did some looking and found this:

<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Privileges.html">http://www.mysql.com/doc/en/Privileges.html</A>

I started to read it, but I figured that I would just go into Webmin and 
temporarily grant privilages to anything and everything to see if that 
was the problem. But then again, I said nah, this is just way too 
complicated. Maybe I can follow this guide and import the data locally:

<A HREF="http://www.unixodbc.org/doc/OOoMySQL.pdf">http://www.unixodbc.org/doc/OOoMySQL.pdf</A>

On Mandrake 9.0,  I was able to get to Page 5,  just above the section 
entitled "Creating the ODBC.ini files."

However Mandrake 9.0 likes to use the libmysql10.mdk.rpm instead of 
MySQL-shared-xxx.i386.rpm, as per the instructions.

So when I do a whereis libmyodbc.so it is not found, but it is listed as 
an element listed in the /etc/odbcinst.ini file in the "Driver" row.

On page 7 it does state that the author's RPM file did not install 
libodbc.so (which is not listed at all in /etc/odbcinst.ini). He created 
a symbolic link and it solved it for him.

Having found no files in /etc that resembled libmyodbc.so, I made the 
symbolic link anyway, cause, I don't know any better.

When I tried to follow the section labeled "Testing ODBC" and run the 
command  "isql MySQL-test -v" I get a message that says "Segmentation 
fault (core dumped)"

I did find one message that addresses this:

<A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/dbi-users">http://archive.develooper.com/dbi-users</A>@perl.org/msg15111.html

...but no answer comes up.

So, I got cut off at the pass on both routes.

Any ideas?
