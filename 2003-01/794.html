&gt; &gt; Hmm. Am I missing something here? What is XP based on?
&gt; 
&gt; Windows XP Home is based on mostly Windows 9x/3.x. Windows XP
&gt; Professional is based mostly on Windows NT (Which is also based a bit on
&gt; 3.x).

Not last time I checked. XP Home and Pro are versions of the same thing,
which is based on NT. Win 9x is dead in the water, there is no current
product in the line, although 98 is still being sold...

&gt; 
&gt; Windows is doing what Unix did. There was a fork at around Windows 3.x.
&gt; This is when NT came into being and was based on a number of things
&gt; (including Lan Mangler, IIRC). The two trees were constantly looking
&gt; over each other's shoulders and borrowing features (such as the
&gt; Win95/WinNT desktop) and for a while now, Microsoft has been trying to
&gt; kill Windows 9x/ME/XPHome, but has failed so far (mostly due to games on
&gt; Windows NT/2K/XPPro, IIRC).
