&gt; Hmm. Competition is inherently wasteful. If I find that the pursuit of
&gt; a certain end brings me into competition with other people or
&gt; organisations, I modify my methods so as to avoid competition. Or
&gt; possibly I may revise my goal. Generally I come up with plans which
&gt; don't involve competition in the first place.

Hmm. So rather than rising to a challenge, you swap challenges. Isn't
that also a wasteful pastime? Most products have a development cycle and
cost that has to be recovered. If the product gets changed every time a
competitor shows up, It's going to get hard to cover costs unless the
development costs are way low, or you are very lucky.

What you say you are doing, sounds like you are trying to find a unique
market for your product where you have no competition. Define Monopoly!

&gt; 
&gt; Competition, and the profit motive, don't necessarily benefit people.
&gt; They may result in cheap stuff, but it tends to be crap. Examples:
&gt; Winmodems, the 8086 PC architecture, my CD-RW, Athlon heatsinking
&gt; arrangements, motherboards with VIA chipsets. Artificial competition
&gt; results in expensive crap: look at the current state of the British
&gt; rail system; I think the Australian rail system is similarly afflicted.

Yes, but. I don't think either rail system has it's ethos rooted in
either profit or competition. Whilst it is arguable that the 8086
architecture is crap, it does give a standard platform, and parts of
many different qualities are available in a similarly wide range of
prices. The market will reject a product for the platform that is below
par for it's price, and accept one that is equal or better than
expectations for it's price level. I think competition is working well
in that market.

&gt; 
&gt; Good stuff produced by the profit motive is not impossible -
&gt; Shakespeare wrote for money - but in general the best you get is either
&gt; good but really expensive stuff (Apple Mac hardware) or (more
&gt; commonly) expensive stuff which is sort of OK but could be SO much
&gt; better (road vehicles, hi-fi systems).

Pigeon, you are not being consistant! If the Mac is good stuff, but
expensive, how is that not 'Good stuff produced by the profit motive'?
(And it isn't realy that horribly expensive for the quality you get in
the box)

Similarly, the HiFi market is littered with examples of cheap crap and
expensive high quality gear, and everything in between. Enjoying good
quality sound, I go for the expensive end if I can afford it, every
time. All of the manufacturers are profit motivated, but they are
competing on different levels (markets). This is another good example of
competition delivering quality for the best possible price, and Profit
motivated production. (although some of the designers and engineers are
in there to make a better box regardless) 

&gt; 
&gt; When you get rid of the profit motive and replace it with the simple
&gt; desire to do a good job, you get good stuff. Examples: old-time local
&gt; tradesmen, like the village blacksmith; the King James Bible; and of
&gt; course LINUX!!!

A lot of stuff gets done with that desire, lucky people get paid to do
it, the rest do it in their spare time. Um, they all have to eat and
provide for their families and old age you know?

And although Linux is not organised on a profit motivation, it is
certainly in competition. How many Win vs Linux discussions have we had,
KDE vs Gnome, Alsa vs OSS, etc etc? 

&gt; 
&gt; So how to perform this replacement... cure the wider disease; a bad 
&gt; job is not hidden before the Lord, and we are told not to bother about 
&gt; accumulating earthly riches, but this doesn't count for much with most 
&gt; people these days...

I don't want to go there... You are suggesting that there was never a
bad god-fearing old-time local tradesman? That the King James Bible is
complete and accurate?

Even if a bad job is not hidden from the Lord, it's a total pain in the
arse for those of us 'down here' on earth that have to put up with it
whilst the perpetrator continues to fail in the Lord's book and stuffs
up our lives with their continued 'bad jobs' that 'the Lord' sees. In
the absence of the Lord smiting him with a thunderbolt, I think he
should just go out of business like many other operators offering a very
poor service for the money.

This is not the venue for such a discussion, but some of those bad jobs
are very close to home for the Lord, and his local representatives have
been extremely recalcitrant in providing remedies. 

For linux content, I'd like it be known that I'm not ready to hand
control of the linux kernel and OS over to the Lord yet. It's working,
and I'm having too much fun with it to have it stuffed up. (Sorry Lord,
you'll have to submit code for peer review just like everyone else)
