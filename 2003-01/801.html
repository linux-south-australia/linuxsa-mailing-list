&gt; Ian, you did get the answer you probably 
&gt; wanted in the first place, I see - there is something called 
&gt; 'dansguardian' which might do what you need under Linux, by the sound 
&gt; of it.

many thanks for the support. Seems that you have ben one of the few who
have been listening to me instead of preaching to me.

I am well aware of community standards relating to porn and I am
required by the community that I am part of to do all I can to stop
those standards being breached. That is it, nothing more than that. If I
can get even close then that is fine, I can say to the folks, OK, here
is the best solution we can afford and it should work most of the time.
I cannot do any more than that even though I would love to have 100% I
now realise that it just wont happen.

Now, I don't see the reborn card as value or money because as far as my
limited knowledge goes the same effect can be had by running a rebuild
script every time the computer is started and making sure that firewalls
and password protections are as strong as I can make them. And having
the card will make zero contribution to stopping the porn access.

I see the DansGuardian as value though it is costly to a non-profit
organisation such as ours. I appreciate the false negative question but
a simple mechanism for us to be notified of sites that are blocked when
they shouldn't be is one way to get around the problem. DansGuardian has
a reporting mechanism for white and black sites. 

I am also interested in what filtering our ISP can provide. It might be
more effective to have it blocked at the ISP. Certainly it would be
easier for me as I have to maintain this system/network for zero pay.

Sorry if your support for my stance means you have to cop some flack, I
do appreciate your message.

Cheers, Ian
