* Ant &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Fineales@ozemail.com.au">Fineales@ozemail.com.au</A>&gt; [2003-01-29 12:37]:
&gt; Im on the dev list, and they've been developing it quite quickly for
&gt; several years now. It grew out of dvgrab. I havn't used it in a very
&gt; long time though, although I would give it another shot. It used to have
&gt; some annoyances with problems with compatibility between some of the
&gt; supporting libs versions, and each other, and one particular bug in the
&gt; MMX code of the dv playback library (which you had to patch the source
&gt; to disable mmx permanently to use it at all). That said, I think those
&gt; problems are now sorted out. Give it a shot!
&gt; 
&gt; Ant

I haven't used it in anger, but Heroine Virual who used to do
Broadcast2000 have a new mousetrap called Cinelerra. I did d/l it a
while ago, and it did run, but I can't really offer much more info than
that.

I am actually looking for something that easily does multimedia
slideshows like PTE (Pictures To Exe), but without the Exe. There's a
bunch of these happening for Windows, but not anything for Linux that
I've seen yet. One very good package is called SSMM (Slide Show Movie
Maker), which can output a DiVx video from a bunch of still images, with
full transition control and even image zooming/panning. High res
(1024x768 or better) is not a problem as long as you have a fast CPU.
Interestingly, rendering is pretty fast for these DiVx movies, and I
reckon a P4 at around 3.4ghz will render my max quality movies at or
better than real time.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; Anyone have experiences with this? Also, has anyone any experiences with
&gt; &gt; other software--the software DOES NOT have to be free as in beer (or
&gt; &gt; speech)?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It should, though, run on Linux.
