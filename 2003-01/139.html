&gt;has anyone used the mandrake version of the sims, my kids are currently
&gt;using the windows version and i would like to load up the linux version,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I bought the Mandrake Edition of the Sims and installed it for my Niece 
(5) and Nephew (4) a while back.
The interesting part of the whole deal is that I ended up setting up 
SuSE Linux 8 on the machine.

I really need to update my web page!

I was still able to install and use the SIMS game in SuSE 8.  I tested 
the game out very briefly. It appeared to work fine. That's all I know.

The real bugger was when I went back to give them SuSE 8.1 for 
Christmas, the mouse wasn't registering in the BIOS for some reason.

Most people I know got one of several distributions.

&gt;the windows version doesnt appear to work under wine and I am wondering
&gt;if anyone has had any success, I've just spent a while google searching
&gt;for answers but havent been able to find any satisfactory answers
&gt;  
&gt;

With Wine, at least in my experience, I have found that if a game does 
not work in one version of Wine, it may work in another.  For example, 
the Transgaming and Winehq Wine would not install Harry Potter and the 
Sourcer's stone, but Cross Over Office would. However, the Transgaming 
version of Wine will run AOL 5 (if you create a text file and call it 
wsock32.dll and put it in .transgaming/c_drive/windows/system) on a LAN 
- not dialup AFAIK.

So, if you happened to have Cross Over Office or the Winehq veersion of 
Wine, you may give that a shot as well, as it may work just fine.

Best,
