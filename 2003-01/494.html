&gt; Can anyone tell me which is the best linux distribution for serious
&gt; (full-time, paid) development work (including kernel development)?

It depends on you personal preference. You'll find that most
distributions come with the most essential tools (interpreters,
compilers and other tools) and many even come with plenty of
editors/IDEs. It's a case of picking one that suits the way you work.
Personally, I change distributions and operating systems (to and from
*BSD, anyway) every few months (depending on what I'm doing). I'm
currently running RedHat 8.0 with all available eye candy, whereas three
weeks ago, I was running Debian 3.0 with sawfish and nothing more. Both
were more than suitable for my coding, support and documentation needs.

It's also not a bad idea to develop on something close to what you
customers will be using (or at least have a test box or twelve around).

I don't think that anyone will be able to give you any sensible and
quick answers. Depending on how strongly you feel about the whole thing,
you'll probably have to evaluate a few distributions and decide which
one best suits your needs.
