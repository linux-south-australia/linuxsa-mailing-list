In a thread responding to Lindows doing a better job at PR, this was said:

&gt; Lindows needs to start answering the rumers more effectivly.
&gt;
&gt; What value would that provide?
&gt;
&gt; 1. It takes time to try and stomp out rumors. I couldn't agree with 
&gt; Sir Winston Churchill more.
&gt;
&gt; "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to 
&gt; get its pants on." Sir Winston Churchill
&gt;
&gt; 2. Even when they hear the truth, some people don't like the fact that 
&gt; we're a commercial enterprise. They don't like that we're letting more 
&gt; people (WalMart shoppers even! For horror!!!) into the club. How many 
&gt; Democrats do you know who are swayed with Republican rhetoric? It 
&gt; would for the most part be a waste of our time and breath.
&gt;
&gt; 3. The time we'd spend in TRYING to "answer the rumors" would be taken 
&gt; away from us doing any real work. Me even typing this response pulls 
&gt; me away from something that would be far more productive to taking 
&gt; Linux to the masses. Wouldn't you rather I was helping make LindowsOS 
&gt; better than typing this response? I know I would. I wouldn't bother 
&gt; with this comment elsewhere, but I make it here out of respect for 
&gt; keeping OUR customers informed.
&gt;
&gt; 4. Even if we did invest the time to "answer the rumors," and 
&gt; Lindows.com got every dollar ever spent by "the community" for a Linux 
&gt; desktop OS, we do NOT have a business. Mandrake + Lycoris + SuSE + 
&gt; Xandros + Insert Linux Desktop OS here = Not enough in revenue to 
&gt; support a business. It's the 95% of people who have never seen or 
&gt; touched Linux where the real opportunity lies. While others were 
&gt; bickering over this unbelievably silly nonsense, we released our 
&gt; Educational Licensing program, the MP3.com Edition, and the Lindows 
&gt; Media Computer. Now, which do you think WalMart cares more about?
&gt;
&gt; 5. The summit is SOLD OUT. A few companies dropped out, but more 
&gt; main-stream companies (Epson, Earthlink, Tech TV, etc. were happy to 
&gt; take their place.
&gt;
&gt; Look at all the cool booths that will be at the summit...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Fonts
&gt; Books
&gt; Laptops
&gt; Web Filtering
&gt; Virus Protection
&gt; Internet Service Providers
&gt; Printing
&gt; Games
&gt; Graphics Editing
&gt; Training
&gt; Software Applications
&gt; Media PCs
&gt; Operating Systems
&gt; Magazines
&gt; Desktop PCs
&gt; Music
&gt; Migration
&gt; QA
&gt; Tablet PCs
&gt; Office Suites
&gt; Education
&gt; Installing Applications
&gt; USB Devices
&gt; Networking
&gt; Hot Swapable Drives
&gt; Cool Linux Devices
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; We don't compete in the vast majority of these areas, and yet that's 
&gt; what people will walk away from knowing about Linux who attend the show.
&gt;
&gt; And as I have already stated, it was NOT Michael who insisted he be 
&gt; the keynote speaker. That was ME. His message fits with the theme of 
&gt; this summit. The fact that I've explained this already, but many 
&gt; didn't get that message, just proves how hard it is to educate people 
&gt; about things. Look at how many people still talk about LindowsOS 
&gt; running MS Windows programs, something we stopped messaging months ago.
&gt;
&gt; Educating the masses about something takes time, money, energy, and 
&gt; resources. We would much rather spend those resources on educating the 
&gt; masses about how cool Linux is, not answering our critics who will 
&gt; probably never agree with anything we do.
