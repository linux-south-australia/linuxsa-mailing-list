&gt;&gt; Basically, management want someone to blame if something bad happens.
&gt;&gt; We "support" the OS on our machines whether they be Solaris, HP/UX,
&gt;&gt; *BSD, etc, but if a curly one comes up that is OS related and we can't
&gt;&gt; work it out, they want someone they can engage that has really 
&gt;&gt; in-depth
&gt;&gt; knowledge of the system because they wrote it. So yes, we could go and
&gt;&gt; hire any number of Linux support companies, and quite a few of them
&gt;&gt; could provide exactly what we want, but management aren't convinced
&gt;&gt; because there is no one vendor for the OS.
&gt;
&gt; What about the distribution. EG Redhat. It's "redhat linux". Its
&gt; produced by redhat (from external opensource projects, and inhouse
&gt; opensource projects). They make a lot of the configuration tools. I
&gt; think you can hire them to work on a problem too. At least you could,
&gt; but I think I may have seen that they were dropping that. You can list
&gt; any strange bugs in their bugzilla database... And you can still hire
&gt; local support anyway. What more do they want?
&gt;

Good question.
