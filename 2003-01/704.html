&gt; I've never used linux raid so my advice is purely theoretical.
&gt; The underlying disk partitions should still be available, e.g. /dev/hda1
&gt; and /dev/hdc1.  You can use cmp on them, whether or not they are mounted.
&gt; There might well be some expected differences, for example describing
&gt; the fact that they are two different halves of a mirrored set.  I would
&gt; expect those differences to be at the start of each disk.  If you get
&gt; differences all over the place either the theory (that you can compare
&gt; mirrors) is wrong or else your mirrors are totally hosed.

Hmm I gave this a try but it looks like the raw parition is unavailable.  I
just end up with:

/dev/hda1/grub/stage2: Not a directory

I can't ls or cat or see anything in the /dev/hda1/ path (which is the
correct partition).  Perhaps the mounting of raid makes these devices
unavailable to view in this way.

&gt;
&gt; Another idea, albeit a dangerous one: you should be able to break your
&gt; mirror by taking one half off-line.  Do so and see which version of the
&gt; file you have.  Then replace the half that's on-line with the half that's
&gt; off-line and see if you have the same file.

Yes this thought did run through my mind.  It will mean a mirror resync when
I hotadd the drive back in but perhaps that in it itself will solve the
problem.  I think this will be my next step.  Thanks again for the
assistance David.

Cheers,
Graham
