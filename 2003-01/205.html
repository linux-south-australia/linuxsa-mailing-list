<H1>D-Link VPN Products</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
We've got several regional offices here at work that are currently
connected via individual modems (i.e., each person uses a modem to
connect to the Internet), which is slightly brain-dead, so I've been
looking at ways to pull them all in to our network.

Here at head office, we've got a nice Cisco PIX 515-E, and that's
working quite nicely. There's a IPSec VPN setup for roaming users, and
I've thought that perhaps a site-to-site VPN would be appropriate too
for the regional offices.

Pushing Internode Business DSL out as their Internet connection seems
plausible, but the next bit I'm still a little undecided on.

If possible, I'd like to combine the ADSL modem and router functions
in the same box that initiates the IPSec tunnel. I know the Cisco
827-H will do that with the firewall featureset, but I feel that $2000
is a little expensive for such a thing. It's not that we're not
prepared to spend the money if we need to, but if there's a cheaper
option available that does the same thing, then it'd be worth at least
looking at it.

Internode have a $1999 price tag on the 827-H + Firewall Featureset
package. The PIX 501 with 3DES is $1600, but that doesn't do the ADSL
modem stuff as well, so you need to spend another $350-odd to do that,
which is coming up to the 2 grand mark anyway.

The other option is, of course, to look at not using any Cisco gear
for the remote sites, and just use D-Link products. It worries me
slightly that D-Link don't have a SMARTnet-type program that'll look
after hardware replacement in the event of hardware failure, though. I
suppose the cost difference means you can almost buy spares and still
be ahead.

D-Link don't seem to have an all-in-one product that covers ADSL
modem, router and VPN in the same case, but that's not a huge, huge
issue.

The combination of a DSL-300 ADSL modem and a DI-804V seems a likely
duo that will do the trick. I could get the both of them for around
$700 (or less), a whole $1300 less than the Cisco solution, a whole 6
months of ADSL Internet access.

Has anyone had any experience with these products? Would anyone
suggest that I spend the extra $1300 (plus SMARTnet) and go with the
Cisco gear?

Comments would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance.
