&gt; Could you go into more detail about why you're ditching your HP's? I'm 
&gt; not considering these machines but it's nice to keep a finger on the 
&gt; pulse.
&gt;

Well we had a couple of reasons.
* The most important one was that we're migrating to Checkpoint 
firewall-1 and HP/UX is not well supported for that product.
* We now have a large number of machines and are trying to keep a 
standard environment in order to keep suppoort costs down.
* Most of the admins were more familiar with Solaris than HP/UX, so 
from a support aspect it made sense to standardise on Solaris.
* We're a Sun partner ;)

&gt; You could consider getting IBM? (it feels so weird to say that) Nobody 
&gt; ever got sacked for buying IBM and they support Linux. :)

Well we could, but getting an S/390 to use as a firewall seems rather 
silly. ;^)

More seriously, until recently (last few years), Intel based systems 
just couldn't compete with the workstation and midrange hardware 
vendors. This has changed, but management attitude hasn't (you try 
spending years convincing management that it really is worth the $$ to 
buy Sun/HP/SGI/etc hardware over the cheaper intel stuff, and then come 
back later and tell them the opposite...)
