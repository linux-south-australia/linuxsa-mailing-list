Ryan,


&gt; Perhaps getting involved with some people who have been involved with
&gt; the whole wireless movement for a lot longer then you have is a good
&gt; idea?

Most of Ian Loxton's ideas are reasonably sound providing he doesn't
fall over the ACA. Until recently air-stream:

* <A HREF="http://www.air-stream.org/">http://www.air-stream.org/</A>

...have been a group of 6 people who have been working reasonably well
to pull up a wireless network in Adelaide. However they do have work
commitments, study committments and a social life. They also suffer from
the "wireless is a great idea but we expect to be able to be part of
your network for absolutely no money at all" syndrome.

Providing wireless access points, no matter how you look at it, is not
free. Coordinating a community wireless group does cost  e v e n  i f 
you cannot by law make a profit to distribute to shareholders or members
of the group.

But I suspect some people wouldn't pay even $5 to be a member of
"air-stream" even though I believe it's worth at least ten times that
figure to be a member of that organisation.

There are ways of making this all mesh together and work; I assure you
of that. There shall be no duplication of effort...
