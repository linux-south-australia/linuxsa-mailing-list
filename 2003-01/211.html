&gt; &gt; if think back to why bridging was used "in the old days";
&gt; &gt; - mixed media interfaces
&gt; &gt; - join together ethernet segments that were too long
&gt; &gt; - "we cant afford a router!"
&gt; &gt; - "its 1985 and we don't know what routing is yet!"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i think that if you are using bridging thatn you may need
&gt; &gt; to ask yourself why you are using it...
&gt; 
&gt; Bridging is still useful. Consider:
&gt; 
&gt; * Building A is connected to building C via building B. Building B
&gt;   gets knocked down. Nobody wants to pay to re-cable building C, so
&gt;   one installs a wireless link between building A and C. Bridge
&gt;   between the wireless link and the ethernet in building C, and the
&gt;   network appears as one big happy LAN again.
&gt; 
&gt; ...not that I had much success with that exact scenario recently, mind
&gt; you. Some FreeBSD quirk, or a wi(4) shortcoming, or I was trying to do
&gt; something that wi(4) wasn't designed to do.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, bridging is still useful every now and then.

bridging was an intermediate step introduced to patch a hardware
media limitation.

i would suspect that a routed network would make more sense in 
the example above.

especially that the groups of people working in building A and C
would be working in different tasks or groups and requiring different
services/servers, the need to be on the same logical ethernet segment
does not make a great deal of sense ... IMHO

but they will need to access common resorces. and the only thing
that will need to have access to both networks is a samba server,
the rest can be accomodated by sensible network design... and routing.
there are ways and means to get a samba server to talk "locally" on
distant networks ;)

cheers,

kim
