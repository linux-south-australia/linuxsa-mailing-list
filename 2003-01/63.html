&gt;What if $1.5 million were to be spent on computers, modems and normal 
&gt;dialups instead? $400 per computer and say $100 per year for localised 
&gt;Internet access. You could get 3000 people connected from nothing. How 
&gt;many could wireless connect?

I would say a reasonable amount for $1.5 million. I'm not sure why each
station would cost 150k each either tho (unless that factors Internet
costs). I think you could spread the cost of wireless atleast over three
years, as the technology will still be good for that time. People on
airstream have been getting 600k/s transfer rates over a few Km's (a lot
better than dial up). I think you would have to cost the dialup connection
for more than a year to compare it, and if your comparing dialup to wirless,
please factor the cost of local calls (which over a year can be quite
substantial), the actual speed of dialup on the internet (let's face it,
dial up feels SLOW now) and a range of other issues ;)

&gt;To use wireless, people would need their own computers, their own 

plenty of options here, just ask romana ;) not only this, there are a number
of commerical and government orgs. donating computers to "worthy" causes.

&gt;802.11b cards AND be within range of the access point. How many people 
&gt;can use these access points? Unless they're using something different, 
&gt;it's still going to be limited to 50 metre radius. If they have to 

well this is where they'd need an antennae, considerably extending the range
from 50 metre's to several k's. If people are partial to climbing on roofs,
you can pick yourself up a pacific-monolithic dish that was used by the
failed galaxy tv mob. regardless, buying in bulk will save you a lot of
money, and if we're looking at the number it possibly could be, then that'd
be quite a saving. i think the main question here is "how many people can
connect to an AP at one time".. is this why it's 150k for one AP. can anyone
answer this question??

&gt;travel to the access point, they may as well go into TAFE and use the 
&gt;existing links along with the benefit that the computers are provided.

has anyone ever used these?? i have, and i gotta say, it wasn't a pleasant
experience! i guess other tafe's may be different ;) i think it'd be great
for people with home duties, or people with a disability that can't travel
easily, or people that just don't have a car! horses for courses.

&gt;So I wonder... how many people would benefit from wireless vs how many 
&gt;people would benefit from normal access methods? For $1.5 million, 
&gt;where's the greater benefit?

well, you've also got support on top of this. who will fix people's
problems, setup and install the WiFi link. there's a range of
questions/problems. I think the main point tho, is i doubt you could get the
funding for the "dialup" option.

Adam Cusack
