&gt; Greetings,
&gt; I am in the process of setting up new Linux and Solaris servers. The 
&gt; district auditors requirements are that we have centralised usernames and 
&gt; passwords, but from a management point of view, it makes sense too. 

Makes sense, but has been the bane of Network Administrators since
networks came into existence :-)

&gt; We already have an integrated Active Directory and NDS system in place, both 
&gt; of which act as LDAP servers, so it makes obvious sense to use LDAP clients 
&gt; for authentication. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do people have a recommendation for Linux and Solaris LDAP client. 

I personally always use OpenLDAP (www.openldap.org) with the nss_ldap
and pam_ldap modules (www.padl.com). I'm not a fan of Novell's
eDirectory on UNIX and haven't had much success with IBM's LDAP server.
The SunOne Directory Server (or whatever it's called this week - it was
originally Netscape Directory Server, I think) isn't too bad.

Where possible, I also like to have parts of my LDAP trees replicated to
each host that will be using it for authentication to keep network
traffic and authentication latency down to a minimum.

&gt; I'd additionally like to make some of these servers members of the Native 
&gt; mode Active Directory domain. Having read both Samba and Samba TNG 
&gt; documentation, they are both unclear whether computers running either of 
&gt; these products can be made members of a Win2K domain, or whether they are 
&gt; limited to NT4 domains only. Could someone clarify this for me ? 

Samba 2.2.x can be made a member of an Active Directory, according to
the documentation and mailing lists. I've not ever tried myself though.

thx,
Matt
