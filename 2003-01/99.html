&gt; Quoting David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dlloyd@microbits.com.au">dlloyd@microbits.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know there are up to 32 possible clients awaiting a chance to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; accept'ed, is there anyway I can either a) peruse that list of waiting
&gt; &gt; &gt; clients to see who they are, or b) simply know how many are queued up?
&gt; &gt; &gt; [1]
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Isn't this what the "select" function is supposed to do? Why do you need
&gt; &gt; to poll them all? Can't you just watch their status with "select" and
&gt; &gt; deal with them as needed.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You could also look at poll(2).
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to poll them all, just deal with them one at a time (ie they come 
&gt; along, request some work, go away and process it and eventually come back with 
&gt; the result).  The socket connection doesn't stay open all the time.  Clients 
&gt; can join and leave any time, may be killed mid-stream, and their number may 
&gt; vary etc.
&gt; 
&gt; For performance measuring reasons I just want to know how many are sitting 
&gt; there (pre-accept()'ed) waiting for their turn, and if possible, who they are.  
&gt; 
&gt; If the connections were persistent I could select() with a zero time out, to 
&gt; find out amongst the connected who had data ready, but that's a different 
&gt; kettle of penguins.  I may have to go to persistent socket connections for 
&gt; performance reasons, but before I make that design decision I want to know 
&gt; where my performance bottle neck is.

So, it sounds like you are not proposing to use the standard approach of:

  loop:

    listen();
    accept();
    fork();
    if (parent)
     goto loop;
    else
     process_child();

The only clues I have here are that accepting connections, while not on 
the TCP fast path, is likely to be much less expensive than forking and 
the attendant copy-on-write behaviour. However, if you have a large number 
of clients being non-persistent, you might want to consider threads or a 
process pool.
