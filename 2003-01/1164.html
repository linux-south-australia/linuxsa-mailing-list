&gt; [1] At l.c.a. 2003 Bdale showed a map with debian developers world-side and there was at least one red dot in Adelaide.

I was stunned during his presntation when over half the audience put up
their hands for being debian developers or considering to become one. The
contributions that Australians have made to the OpenSource movement are way
out of proportion (IMHO) than the population compared to other countries.
With Rusty, Tridge and all that crowd, it just surprised me but also made
me feel proud I was in their company.

In fact the thought came during the dinner, early before too much wine was
consumed &lt;G&gt;, that I was part of the Annual Dinner for Linux Corporation.
Most of the bosses were there, the evangalists, developers,
trouble-shooters, builders, vendors, users, they were all represented.

I am just so looking forward to 2004 to again be part of such a great
crowd. Sure made my day^H^H^Hweek &lt;G&gt;

Cheers, Ian
