Tell everybody that is there that...I hope that they all are having a 
great time and I miss their messages. :-)

Sounds fun, wish I were there!   :-(

&gt;Hi folks,  
&gt;
&gt;this is one great place to hold a conference. The buildings, the grounds, ducks on the water features and peacocks wandering around the place. Fabulous!
&gt;
&gt;So, firstly the flight, Virginblue was great. I used the headset from a previous QANTAS flight, better than paying $2.50 for their bud sets &lt;yuk&gt;
&gt;Accommodation is good though the only airconditioning is a big fan in a corner of the room. Breakfast is good so at least we can start the day right.
&gt;
&gt;I attended the educational mini-conf and found it very interesting. We shared a lot of viewpoints and I am sure we all gained from the interchange.
&gt;
&gt;Today is Wednesday and we are about to start the Tutorial sessions. I am looking forward to a day of immersion in PHP. See what I feel about tonight!
&gt;
&gt;Oh, did I mention that Linus is here!! With his family, looking forward to getting a chance to meet with him at the drinkies session tonight.
&gt;
&gt;Of course the real reason we go to conferences is the networking outside of the sessions and that has been very valuable. Looks like some of the contacts will pay off when the NNN project gets off the plannning table.
&gt;
&gt;See you back there next week and hope to bring you a full run-down on a future (February?) LinuxSA meeting.
&gt;
&gt;If you want to see some nice piccies, including some snaps of DSL, they are putting up a page off the confernce site. Soon as I get the URL I will repost it. There is a web cam running in the network room, available off the site. 
&gt;
&gt;And did I say that Linus is here?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,  Ian
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;PS: big thanks again to anybody who helped me get here. When linux.conf.2004 comes around don't miss it!
&gt;
