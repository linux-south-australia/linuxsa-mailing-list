'day,

* David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@adam.com.au">lloy0076@adam.com.au</A>&gt; [2003-01-28 22:20]:
&gt; 
&gt; Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks Ian, I think we all knew about that already, it must have
&gt; &gt; happened while you were on the plane?
&gt; 
&gt; No, it killed our Internet connection on Friday and Saturday. It was
&gt; very frustrating and at one point we couldn't quite decide whether
&gt; something funny had happened with the Internet gateway at UWA or whether
&gt; something bigger was happening.

I know what you mean, I thought my ADSL was playing up, but it was
something at the other end of the line getting saturated. At one stage,
I could ping most any Aussie site I could think of, but anything in the
states was off the air.
 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally, I'd rather hear about your adventures at linuxconf than
&gt; &gt; recycled information about the problems of another OS...
&gt; 
&gt; Well then spam <A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A> and remind them that part of
&gt; Ian's package was that he had to make a real presentation to the
&gt; group.

Now David, I wouldn't do that! (It wouldn't work anyhow, they have
decently thick skins)

Hopefully there was enough going on that Ian can throw us a few morsels
without wrecking his 'real presentation'. Arguably, a post to this list
is a real presentation, certainly read by more linuxsa'ers than turn up
to the meetings.

&gt; 
&gt; I'll be putting up a heap of notes very soon now.

Ok, thanks...

Michael
