&gt; &gt; I grant you that Windows is more expensive than the free alternatives,

&gt; &gt; need to fight.  Comrade.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, I think not, little puppy :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Profit is good, but so is competition.
&gt; 
&gt; However much MS protests that they innovate, the truth is that the do 
&gt; precious little of that.
&gt; 
&gt; We must fight monopolies, since healty competition benefits all consumers.
&gt; 
&gt; Pity that government is a monopoly :-(

Hmm. Competition is inherently wasteful. If I find that the pursuit of
a certain end brings me into competition with other people or
organisations, I modify my methods so as to avoid competition. Or
possibly I may revise my goal. Generally I come up with plans which
don't involve competition in the first place.

Competition, and the profit motive, don't necessarily benefit people.
They may result in cheap stuff, but it tends to be crap. Examples:
Winmodems, the 8086 PC architecture, my CD-RW, Athlon heatsinking
arrangements, motherboards with VIA chipsets. Artificial competition
results in expensive crap: look at the current state of the British
rail system; I think the Australian rail system is similarly afflicted.

Good stuff produced by the profit motive is not impossible -
Shakespeare wrote for money - but in general the best you get is either
good but really expensive stuff (Apple Mac hardware) or (more
commonly) expensive stuff which is sort of OK but could be SO much
better (road vehicles, hi-fi systems).

When you get rid of the profit motive and replace it with the simple
desire to do a good job, you get good stuff. Examples: old-time local
tradesmen, like the village blacksmith; the King James Bible; and of
course LINUX!!!

So how to perform this replacement... cure the wider disease; a bad
job is not hidden before the Lord, and we are told not to bother about
accumulating earthly riches, but this doesn't count for much with most
people these days...
