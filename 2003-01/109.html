I was thinking the AP's could go on top of the building. If it got to 
the stage of building towers, then paying for a Telstra link would be 
more of an option. An extra $100,000 buys a lot of Telstra link - 
especially if the PAPL option is still lurking.

I also wouldn't run low loss antenna cabling, since it'd be cheaper to 
run an Ethernet link (fibre if necessary) up to the roof then place the 
AP local to the dish. This is presuming the wireless is only for 
connecting the buildings together.

It would be worth considering an AP for the roof, and an AP for the 
class to avoid some wiring, but I'm not a big fan of wireless for 
internal use seeing as local activity (eg, printing a large graphics 
heavy file) can saturate bandwidth.

&gt; Even if you use volunteers for most of this, you'll probably want to 
&gt; factor
&gt; in a coordinator AND the cost of running the network from the on (eg.
&gt; Sysadmins, maintenance on key bits of kit).

Yep. One sysadmin should be able to run the lot though. Purchasing 
spares avoids the need for warrantee and maintenance costs.

&gt; I think you're underestimating the cost of a lot of this and 
&gt; discounting the
&gt; costs that are really there.

I have left a few things out, but I think the physical costing is in 
the ballpark. I don't know if Ian's $150k per site was for physical or 
for the entire show.
