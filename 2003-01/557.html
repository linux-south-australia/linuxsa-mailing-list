&gt; I may be wrong but I thought LCD screens IGNORED refresh rates and they

&gt; manufacturers don't expect you to.

Remember the picture is sent as an analog signal, serially, on the vga
cable (Unless your using one of those digital flat screen interfaces,
but I havnt seen these in use yet). The refresh rate refers to how many
frames get sent down the cable per second. Therefore, higher refresh
rates mean each frame gets less time on the cable, and the lcd driver
gets less time to process the signal An analog monitor wont need to
proces it as it will sync the electron gun to the signal in real time.
My projector supports refresh rates up to 80hz, but at the top end you
can see that your pushing the specifications to the limits, as the edges
of the pixels become a little ill-defined and bleed from one to the
next, or in some cases flicker a little. If you use 60hz, the picture is
far better defined. I can see how old lcds may only support one refresh
rate, but that would mean that you have to use the right one, rather
than it is irrelevant.
