Michael,

&gt; Sounds like memory leaks...
&gt; 
&gt; a) X is often the cause of memory leaks.  Run in run-level 3 
&gt; and "startx" 

I should have mentioned this before. This system was running X and it is not
any more. 

&gt; should keep your box up a lot longer.  That's only a good 
&gt; suggestion if your 
&gt; box is a server - if it's intended to be a workstation that's 
&gt; another story...

It's a server.

&gt; b) (Big) X applications typically leak memory too.  Leave 
&gt; these running at your 
&gt; peril.
&gt; 
&gt; c) I've found that 2.4 kernels will use all your RAM (and 
&gt; that's on my 512Mb 
&gt; laptop!), but that's nothing to be overly concerned about.  
&gt; Most of it is 
&gt; cached data (I've had over 384Mb of cache at times!) - it 
&gt; should be making your 
&gt; computer run quicker.  You only need be concerned if it's 
&gt; thrashing (i.e. 
&gt; constant disk activity).

My original testing of this machine involved large files and several at a
time. It slows the machine (as you would expect) but doesn't crash it. I bet
X was a big player in this.

AG.
