&gt; Linux.conf.au - Australian Special Report 
&gt; As Perth plays host to Linux.conf.au--one of the world's largest gatherings of technology developers--Builder Australia takes you behind the scenes, in an exclusive special report. 
&gt; <A HREF="http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?194601">http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?194601</A> 

&gt; PHP creator: Rasmus Lerdof 
&gt; Builder Australia recently caught up with PHP innovator Rasmus Lerdorf, to
&gt; talk about the success of PHP, the open source movement and what we can
&gt; expect to see in PHP 5. 
&gt; <A HREF="http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?194602">http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?194602</A>

Though I knew nothing about PHP I attended the Intro Tutorial on PHP
presented by Rasmus on the Wednesday of the conference.

It rocked me just how powerful this language is and the range of things tht
can be done with it. I did have trouble folowing some of the discussion but
the early years with C at Uni came in handy as he described the scripting
to achieve some of the effects.

I didn't attend his Advanced PHP sessions in the afternoon, I knew I had
already reached my limit to understanidng his concepts but I would think it
was just as good as the morning sessions for those who knew something about
PHP. 

To get the good word from the creator of the product was something I had
not anticipated and I would hope that Rasmus might come back in 2004 to
again tell folks about his great language. He is a nice bloke and easy to
talk to. Look out for it on the program &lt;G&gt;

Now, there is a site with his talks on it, I don't have th URL with me but
David or any of the other SA attendees should be able to help here. If you
are doing PHP then I think you would find his talk very interesting,
especially the part where he creates graphics on the fly the makes them
rotate. Cool scripting.

Cheers,  Ian
