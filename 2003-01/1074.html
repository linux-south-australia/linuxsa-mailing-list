&gt;I have a FreeBSD 5.0 system here, running Samba 2.2.7a, and I want to
&gt;enable ACL's.  I want to utilize them in such a way that I can
&gt;manipulate ACL's from a Windows workstation and have those ACL's set on
&gt;my samba server.

Can be done, though I have zero experience with FreeBSD, but the principle
should be the same.


&gt;I've searched and searched and searched and searched and searched and
&gt;searched and searched and searched and I haven't been able to find a
&gt;great deal of information or any HOWTO's that explain what is required,
&gt;or how exactly *to* implement ACL's.  

I'm with you here, there isn't a whole lot of easy to follow info out there,
a lot of it is dated sadly.  I won't complain though because I'd be quite
capable of writing some docs on it myself if I had some spare time.... :P


&gt;with it, because when I remounted it, 'mount' still reported it as UFS.
&gt;I was directed to have a look at tunefs, and I ran 'tunefs /dev/ar0s1g
&gt;-a enable' which told me ACL support was now enabled.
&gt;
&gt;Now what?  I have enabled in smb.conf:
&gt;
&gt;nt acl support = yes
&gt;inherit acls = yes
&gt;inherit permissions = yes

Ok, as long as your underlying filesystem is enabling ACLs you're pretty 
much there.  You can check this further by using the acl utilities, setfacl,
getfacl and so on.


&gt;From a workstation I can view permissions but not change them.  'Access
&gt;Denied.'  As a regular user and a member of the wheel group, I can
&gt;change permissions using my 'regular' account, right?  I even tried
&gt;using my 'root' account directly from a workstation to see what would
&gt;happen, but still, 'Access Denied.'

There's one of two conditions which must be met in order for you to change
ACLs from a workstation (AFAIK):

1. You must be the owner of the file/dir OR
2. You must have root level access to the share

This can be a pain in the proverbial when you're manipulating ACLs on shares
which are accessed by many users because you end up with files owned by
those
many different users.  You've found this out by getting access denied
errors.

What we do here is have a root level share which gives root access for IT
staff
only so they can manipulate ACLs anywhere on the data shares.  (All our
samba 
shares reside in /home/samba, so we share /home/samba as the root level
share)

Obviously you need to be careful with this as root level access means root
level
access, so don't give it guest+browseable access without good backups! ;)

Our smb.conf entry for this share is as follows:

[Storage]
        comment = Storage Server Root
        path = /home/samba
        valid users = @g-itstaff
        admin users = @g-itstaff
        force user = root
        read only = No
        browseable = No

Once you have this setup you should be able to manipulate ACLs from any
workstation
if you have logged in as a member (in this case) of the group "g-itstaff"


&gt;This is all a humungously enormous gigantic learning curve.  I've
&gt;mastered Samba before but only for my own small-time setup, 
&gt;not anything
&gt;as major as this.  But I'm-a gettin' there Martha!

If it's any consolation, ours is only a small time setup too, although
there are many of them.  The largest samba box we have only has around
70 concurrent users...

(and the learning curve is worthwhile, once you reach the top and have 
a look at the view ;)
