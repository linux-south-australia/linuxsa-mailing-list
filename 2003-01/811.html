&gt; on here instead of reasoned discussion. I certainly appreciate him

&gt; &gt;  Ian has asked the question and been 
&gt; &gt; given answers which he prefers to ignore.  I don't know why.

&gt; I have been given a great deal of flack and in the majority of cases it
&gt; has been irrelevant to the situation that I have been speaking about. I

I generally agree with setting limits in public places, but it's foolish
to think that you have a 100% solution. I set up a DansGuardian box for

(paid-for, big bucks) filter running at the high power school the kids
went to - and the kids openly told me that!

don't know what is...
