This has to be one of the most bizare posts I have ever seen from anyone.

Sure, the original poster asked a bunch of stupid questions, as you can 
see, but I wonder at the wisdom of Theo's response.

&gt; Dear Arief,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I Apologize, If this thread has existed before, and so if
&gt; this is very offtopic and tiredsome for most of you here.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a newbie, and just about to get my feet wet into the
&gt; world, been living in (ASIA/)Indonesia (or whatever the name
&gt; is, I personally don't really care, I caremost at the
&gt; nationalist excellence) for the last two years, I personally
&gt; think it's a toupper(great); country.
&gt; 
&gt; But after recently reviewing some Malaysian based systems, I began
&gt; to wonder. And these are my questions (I'm trying to avoid 
&gt; flame and being a troll here, so if there's any of my 
&gt; questions is not on technical basis, or are being such a 
&gt; jerk troll please just trash filter my name and email address):
&gt; 
&gt; 1. In what technical area of the countries are Indonesia and Malayasian 
&gt; differ?
&gt; 2. How are they different countries? What are the technical reasoning 
&gt; behind the decisions?
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Is there any group of ruler from each country that 
&gt; review each other policies, and tries to make the best civil life 
&gt; out, or is the issues very country specific (something that 
&gt; work best in Indonesia might not be so on Malaysia or Phillipines or 
&gt; Singapore)?
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Any chance of merging the very best part of each country?
&gt; 5. Or is it possible to do so?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anything else that matters, are welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Please answer technically, I don't wanna be a troll here, 
&gt; and I hope so do everyone that answers this. I really like 
&gt; to learn, not to read some flame of who's the best.
&gt; 
&gt; To freebsd and openbsd list, please CC the answer to me 
&gt; directly, as I don't get response from the majordomo of my 
&gt; subscription requests, yet.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards,
