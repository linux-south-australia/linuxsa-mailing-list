Evan,

&gt; A friend was raving about smoothwall on icq and was insistant on the
&gt; fact SW will not allow any software to be loaded etc. 

You could ask the Smoothwall mailing list but Richard Morrell makes my
most deranged e-mails seem like I'm the picture of utter piety and
politeness.

&gt; Not knowing much about it I was really surprised. Does anyone know
&gt; if this is true or if not how one adds software to a SW box?

I don't know how you'd add software but given that SmoothWall is
supposed to be "secure" then it would make sense they would work to
prevent you from adding material that could then make it insecure.

&gt; As my friend would like to
&gt; install some things seeing its his gateway.

What would he like to add?
