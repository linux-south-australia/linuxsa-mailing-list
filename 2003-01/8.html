Ian,

&gt; Great post and I agree with much of what you say. Especially the 
&gt; discussion on documentation. It just sucks in many cases.

This can go on forever, however users of Microsoft Windows 2000 Server
tend to recognise that managers, office staff or their kids aren't
really the right people to be managing IIS, Microsoft SQL Server and so
forth. Therefore they employ MCSE's or other supposedly competent
people.

Users of Linux and other free operating systems seem to forget that
running things like mail servers, web servers and so forth isn't really
what the average every day person does with their computers. And no,
neither Ian Loxton nor James Leone is an average computer user. Ian
tinkers and WANTS to learn more much like James.

Your average user wants to put their CD's in, just copy them. Do some
stuff in Word. Play a few games of Solitaire and so on. The latest
distros, such as Mandrake 9.0 and Lycoris and maybe even Lindows are
getting close to this ideal.

The documentation is not at all bad.

People seem to think they can just start using Linux (or any other free
operating system) and suddenly a whole new field of expertise, its
jargon and how it works will automagically become understandable. 

Let me end by saying this: Linux is not a panacea. It's not a cure all.
Its documentation is not bad. People who state a "blanket statement"
that its documentation is all bad are missing the point.
