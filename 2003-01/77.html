&gt;I'll completely agree - very, very impressed with the Samba team, 
&gt;they're by far the most helpful bunch of people I've ever known.

What you said.  Kudos squared and to the power of the biggest number you
can think of to the Samba team.  I'm another recipient of direct support
from the developers.  There aren't many proprietary software products out 
there with which you can communicate directly with the development team to 
nail some bugs or fix some weird hassle that's fairly unique to your own
situation.  

Actually, come to think of it, there aren't too many proprietary software 
products out there that work as well as Samba either, but hey, maybe I'm 
just biased ;)

(pity we couldn't talk to the MS Outhouse developers about certain crusty
text wrapping habits of their product....hmmmmmm.... :P

(and yes, I've read your page on this very issue Greg, lol ;)
