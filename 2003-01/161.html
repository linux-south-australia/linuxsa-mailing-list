&gt; To my limited knowledge I believe towers are going to be essential and 
&gt; in almost every case would be sited on Council property. I think that 
&gt; by using ISPs such as Internode / AirNet with their telco licenses we 
&gt; can get towers that can go up to 6 metres (?) to broadcast/receive to 
&gt; the client premises. 

If it's on Council premises getting approval may not be an issue.  Telco's 
play by their own Federal rules.

However, I'd say you'll need more than 6m for 3-5km to get LOS with enough 
fresnel room.

This Cisco antenna guide is useful:

<A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/wireless/ps458/products_data_sheet09186a008008883b.html">http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/wireless/ps458/products_data_sheet09186a008008883b.html</A>

Has a table of values.  5miles = 35feet of clearance from highest point = 
10m

Cisco have a spreadsheet 
(<A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao340ap/prodlit/obrc_in.xls">http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/cc/pd/witc/ao340ap/prodlit/obrc_in.xls</A>)

Which is quite useful, if a little conservative.  However, if you use their 
figures you won't get it wrong.

&gt; My goal, and again I am not a technical person, is to at the least be 
&gt; able to broadcast 3 to 5 km LOS without accepting too much 
&gt; deterioration of signal. I anticipate around 20 maybe even as many as 
&gt; 30 clients from each base station. I am prepared to accept 2x dialup 
&gt; (56k) as a minimum connect rate.

Yeah, I reckon with high enough towers (10m) you'll get 5km at close to 
11mbps (7Mbps in actual usable throughput).

&gt; Is this reasonable to assume such spread is possible?

Yes.  Have a look at the spreadsheet - it'll figure it out. 

(although it's got Cisco stuff through it, you can subsitute other values - 
it's great to play with as it gives you an idea of what you can play with).
