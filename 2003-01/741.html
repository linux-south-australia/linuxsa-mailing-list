That's fine, Ian -- Find some software which reliably tells the difference
between those two categories and you'll no doubt get endless offers of
help to install it.  Currently no such software exists, which explains why
you're getting yawns from the mailing list.

Until Artificial Intelligence develops to the point where software which
*claims* to do that is any better than random guesswork with a far-right
political bias, you'll probably find that the people on this list aren't
too entheusiastic about installing software which doesn't work.

[ Anyway, Ian, I would have thought that you, of all people, would have
  understood the arguments about information-haves and information-have-nots
  which were put forward in the ACLU vs Reno case in the late 90's.  You're
  managing a project which aims to break the digital divide by giving Internet
  access to disadvantaged people;  Can you *really* see a future for them
  when the Internet they get to use has been deliberately nobbled, and is
  less featureful and less pleasant to use than the Internet which those who
  can afford commercial rates can access? ]
