Well, that was quick... maybe 10 minutes... Someone should write a
script to do that, and submit it to the debian people... maybe I'm
that someone... hmmm... Naaaah... :)

I did as you suggested, and it seems that the only differences are in
the following files:

/etc/pam.d/login
/etc/pam.d/passwd
/usr/lib/mime/packages/less

Having browsed these files, I can't see any obvious change or anything
that would indicate to me any issues with corruption -- hard-drive or
hacker-based.

This is a Good Thing (though I still don't know about files not in the
database -- specifically config files...)

&gt; approach would be to collect the contents of 
&gt; /var/lib/dpkg/info/PACKAGES.md3sums into one file and sort it on the second 
&gt; field.  Then create another using md5sum from the root directory.  Then do a 
&gt; diff on the two files.

&gt; Good luck,

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any tool that anyone knows of that will enable me to see
&gt; &gt; exactly what has changed from the standard debian packages on my
&gt; &gt; machine? I want to know for two reasons -- to help document my
&gt; &gt; installation, and to help me identify and recover a few corrupted
&gt; &gt; files.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One thought that I have is to create a subdirectory on a partition
&gt; &gt; with room, and basically re-install all my packages there and do a
&gt; &gt; recursive diff or something similar. However, I'd rather there was
&gt; &gt; something a little more sophisticated available. Another thought was
&gt; &gt; forcing a re-install of each and every package, but I have a feeling
&gt; &gt; that that may cause more problems than it solves -- I'd rather know
&gt; &gt; what differences existed so I could deal with each individually...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any comments?
