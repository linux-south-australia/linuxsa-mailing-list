Lets just flip the answers for a second.

&gt; After this it was a simple case of setting the DISPLAY variable
&gt; correctly.
&gt;
That was the problem with OpenOffice not installing. I was in konsole 
under su - to do the install as I wanted to setup OOo using the --net 
option. As you pointed out, there wasn't an X Server running for root 
so when OOo tried to run glibc to install it couldn't. I needed to 
either be in full root login or install from user. 

Now back to the first part of your reply:

&gt; To reply to this topic, a number of things had happened:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Somehow all the authentication in the "startx" script had usefully
&gt;    been deleted or was not there
&gt;  - hence "startx" would eventually start X but then you'd get "client
&gt;    can't connect errors"
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Somehow libpng got upgraded from 1.0.8 to 1.2.X
&gt;  - and Ian claims he has no idea why
&gt;
I know I updated libpng along with several other updates off the 
Lycoris site. No idea why it should have cause problems like that. I 
know my last program running had been kpresenter and that was several 
reboots after the update so there doesn't seem to be a link between the 
update and the failure. Thanks for your patience in fixing it. It had 
me worried &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
