&gt; Now that the business to personal plan pricing is much closer together and
&gt; becoming more realistic, what are the chances of additional services such
&gt; as Static IP addressing becoming cheap and easy?

Bugger all I'd say.

&gt; 
&gt; At present, why are Adam Internet are able to offer a permanent IP
&gt; address on their personal plans for as little as $30 extra per month
&gt; while Internode can't? The plan pricing is relatively similar?  As a
&gt; loyal customer I'd not want to have to switch :-)

Won't not can't.  You've said yourself above that "Now that the business to 
personal plan pricing is much closer together" so ultimately it's your call, 
if you want to either a) have an adam account and pay $30pm for the static 
or b) pay extra for the Internode play you can.

You're the consumer.  It's your choice.

(BTW, I have chosen to have a Business service at home so I can route my own 
ClassC and run my own webservers etc.  I could do it with DynDns kinds of 
stuff, but I chose not to (one of my websites generates more than 3GB pm of 
outgoing traffic).  I do run a dyndns service for a friend of mine who has a 
personal adsl service through internet (search for GnuDIP2 for the sw).  The 
business service has the advantage of NO PPPoE!)

&gt; I'm really over the moon that Internode's plan costs recently came down
&gt; (or in fact, my plan went UP to meet the lower costs,) and I think that
&gt; ADSL Internet is becoming closer to the type of Internet access I used
&gt; to dream about as a young lad ;)

Obviously you don't want it _that_ much.
