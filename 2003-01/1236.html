Because otherwise Australian IT would not have been there, Kate's boss 
didn't see that it was important enough to pay her fare. Sun, as one of 
the big sponsors said yes, we believe it is important for you to be 
there, same as they paid for my fare. Nobody said to me to treat Sun 
nicely.

They got the chance to put a good story forward, Kate wrote them up. 
Now they give her good info and she writes that up. It doesn't 
necessarily mean a relationship exists.

On the educational Linux list (that grew out of the LCA) there has been 
a full discussion on how MS and others will be represented and 
speaking.  Pia and other Linux reps will be there showing the flag for 
opensource.

It is going to be very interesting.
Cheers,  Ian
