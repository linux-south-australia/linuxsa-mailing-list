The claim implied that Open Source is the only way to fight the "digital
divide," and it was that which I objected to.  In fact I argue that
Microsoft's dominance and support for "ISA PCs" is the major factor
behind the plummetting cost of Wintel hardware.  Open standards, such
as S100, didn't make computing more affordable in the same way that
Microsoft did.  Neither did Sun nor Apple, at least until they adopted
the hardware standards which Microsoft helped push, such as PCI and IDE.
Despite that you might find it distasteful, it would be both ungracious
and dishonest to deny that Microsoft, whether wittingly or not, has
done more to reduce the digital divide by driving down costs than any
other company except, perhaps, Intel.  You don't have to like them,
but I think you do have to give credit where it's due.
