&gt;Hiya,
&gt;
&gt;Music's a huge part of my life - my biggest hobby is collecting music,
&gt;usually CD's when I can but mp3's[1] when I can't (afford them, heh!).
&gt;
&gt;Even when I buy CD's, I always rip them to ogg/mp3 (lame with optimal
&gt;settings).  Quality is a *huge* thing for me.
&gt;
&gt;I don't know if its just me, but my SB Live! Value card has always sounded
&gt;like trash under any OS apart from Windows (I use xmms to play mp3's). 
&gt;Using Creative's drivers, or the kXmedia drivers (awesome 3rd party drivers
&gt;made by a russian dude) on Windows has always resulted in my mp3's through
&gt;winamp sounding so clarified its not funny.
&gt;
&gt;FreeBSD's drivers sound bloddy horrible (unfortunately, one of the reasons
&gt;why I'm using Linux right now), and Linux is better, but still nowhere near
&gt;as good as Windows.  I've tried the emu10k1 drivers in the kernel, alsa's
&gt;drivers (which sounded worse, and the OSS emulation was terrible last time
&gt;I tried them), and today emu10k1 drivers from sourceforge, which was a step
&gt;up again, but it still doesn't sound right.  The sound's not clear - I mean,
&gt;its acceptable for most people, but its irritating the crap out of me *g*.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody else had experiences with this, and has suggestions on making the
&gt;card sound a whole lot better?
&gt;

&gt;[1] - If any of you are into IDM/Industrial/Goatrance, give me a yell,
&gt;always looking for people with simular (warped) music tastes to trade music
&gt;with :-)

&gt;cynical: a word used by the frightened to describe the realistic.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
I'm using an SBLive!(emu10k1) the cheapest I suppose, on Linux (Mandrake 9.0, stock kernel and sound libraries that came with it, libalsa2 0.9.0).
XMM works with no difference from Windows' amp or media player on mp3's. I use GNOME Volume Control (has treble/bass controls effective), OSS driver 1.2.7.
XMM's equalizer works very nice, the extra stereo plugin works to, so probably is just a lucky hardware match in contrast with so many unfortunate experiences.
