&gt; Hi There,
&gt;     It is fairly straight forward to do what you want quite painlessly. Get
&gt; your Linux distro and create a boot disk if you haven't got one already, or
&gt; just boot direct from Disk 1 CD. At the appropriate time, type in Linux
&gt; Rescue - you will know when, it prompts you for it. The disk will then do a
&gt; few things and search for your Linux install. When it finds it - mount to
&gt; it. When you have booted the Linux system in rescue mode, just run lilo, and
&gt; it will write to the boot sector again. Reboot the machine and lilo should
&gt; launch as normal and windoze should be blissfully unaware of it as always.
&gt; 
&gt;     The command is just:
&gt;         /sbin/lilo
&gt; 
&gt; Hope this has helped.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
&gt; 
&gt; P.S. there are instructions in the Linux Pocketbook on how to do this. It is
&gt; available from Australian Personal Computer Magazine still and the latest
&gt; version supports RH 8.0.

&gt; Subject: Reinstalling Windows while keeping Linux
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have both a Windows 98 and a Redhat Linux 8.0 on my
&gt; &gt; machine and my Windows started to raise problems about
&gt; &gt; one month after installation (as usual) and now I have
&gt; &gt; to reinstall it. It's ok; reinstalling Windows and
&gt; &gt; using its benefits(!) has been my job for about six
&gt; &gt; years. But the problem is that "Microsoft virus" will
&gt; &gt; cause my Linux to be lost after reinstalling it. Is
&gt; &gt; there any way to backup MBR, reinstall Windows, boot
&gt; &gt; Linux using a boot floppy and restore MBR? I want to
&gt; &gt; avoid reinstalling Linux after reinstalling Windows.
&gt; &gt; Could anybody please lead me to some man pages or
&gt; &gt; other resources on this problem?

there is another option however,

you could folow the above procedure for puting linux
boot loader on the root file system partition and
get booteasy from the FreeBSD site.

booteasy is a dos program install the FreeBSD boot
loader that auto detects the partitions and will
load from and partition that has a valid boot loader on it...

cheers,

kim
