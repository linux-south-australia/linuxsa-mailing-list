Just been digging around the Sun site following on from the offer from 
the Sun folks to let our project have StarOffice™ under same conditions 
as "educational" - free.

Now, my apologies if none of this is new to you, it might be new for 
others. There is a wealth of good curriculum information there ranging 
from the resources posted by many US schools which were supported by 
Sun to the 6 modules to teach StarOffice™ to Teachers. 

The good thing about all this stuff is that with only minor changes the 
same material can support the teaching of the OpenOffice.org suite.

Cheers,  Ian
