Can you imagine having to list every monitor make and model on the
planet? Fact is, most standard PC-compatible LCD monitors will work.

&gt; Red Hat have a searchable list by manufacturers - load of good that is (not)
&gt; - because I want a list of all supported LCD screens. 

Again, stress less. Guaranteed pretty much any monitor that you buy
from your local dealer will work without any problems on your Linux
box.

&gt; Has anyone had any luck with LCD and suggestions to makes and models?

Get whatever. The nice ones are not made in China, and generally have
a recognised brand name on them. NEC tend to be good.

The thing that you might like to remember is that the resolution on
LCD monitors is fixed. Have you ever seen a laptop that is running at
a resolution lower than that of the screen? The text and graphics are
all nasty lookin', due to the way the monitor does screen stretching.

Pick one that you like from a features and aesthetics point-of-view.

Monitors generally work. They're like keyboards in that sense. You
generally don't have keyboards that'll only work with certain
operating systems.
