In the recent past I have tried to record the Palo Alto City Council 
meetings in Linux, but found it a bit frustrating.

Up to today, all I had been able to do was record 12 MB of silence.

But for some reason, it worked for me today.

All I did was use the command line from this post:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2002-04/803.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2002-04/803.html</A>

sox -c 2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track&lt;nn&gt;.wav

[literal]

sox -c 2 -w -t ossdsp /dev/dsp -r 44100 track1.wav

to pick up some audio from:

<A HREF="http://kzsulive.stanford.edu/">http://kzsulive.stanford.edu/</A>

However, you don't have to go there...

You can create a text file and call it

kzsu-1.ram

The contents should read:

rtsp://171.66.118.60/encoder/kzsu-1.rm

That's it. You can open it up with the real player, or whatever you prefer.

Real Audio Batch Files

While learning about Linux and sound I decided to do some testing with USC's band songs.

I saved 22 .ram files and then played them. I was kind of disappointed that the songs did not play as the band played them while I was there...

That is they would play songs 1,2,3 and 22 consecutively without pause. I opened up the .ram file with emacs and saw this:

rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/01.rm

So I edited it to read like so:

rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/01.rm
rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/02.rm
rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/03.rm
rtsp://www.debutwebdesign.com/audio/in_studio/22.rm

Ahh... that's better.


Now I thought...

Its had been a bit disappointing that the Real One Player for Linux doesn't seem to be able to play an entire cd as the Windows version could...

But what if I did the same thing with my cd's?  I already had a copy of my Linkin Park CD on my shared storage hard disk, previously recorded in Windows.

All I had to do was create a .ram file with contents....

<A HREF="file:/windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/01_-_Papercut_-_Linkin_Park.rmj">file:/windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/01_-_Papercut_-_Linkin_Park.rmj</A>

....and edit the .rmj files to not include any empty spaces....(note the underscores!)

Instead of editing the list tediously, I changed directories to where my songs are:

cd /windows/D/My_Music/Linkin_Park/Hybrid_Theory/

Then ran ls -l

Copied the contents of the shell by highlighting it first and then using:

CTL-C

I then opened up kwrite and edited the .ram file and pasted the contents of the output, and then set them in place.

It will play the songs I include in the .ram file in a sequence.

Hope this helps!

James Leone
