This could go one of two ways...

Either it will be a bit like the Pentium 3 processor serial number thing,
which at the time it was introduced was basically promoted as being the last
word in identification and security.  "Buy a P3 and all will be secure
because of this magic serial number thingy" was the basic marketing message.
However I don't know of any applications which ever actually used the P3
serial number for security, do you?  TCPA could go the same way, "a good
idea at the time, but no one actually uses it for real work".  

However, given that TCPA architecture seems to involve the BIOS refusing to
boot an unknown bootloader, etc.  It would seem that if your PC is TCPA
compliant, then you have no choice but to use the supplied TCPA compliant OS
(i.e.. Windows) on your PC, and given Microsoft's current position on DRM,
etc once you've booted windows I doubt you'll have a choice to turn your
TCPA "protection" off.  Which makes the second scenario somewhat more
likely...

It will most likely be handled like the "legacy free PC's", and most other
major changes I've seen in the industry.  In this scenario, both TCPA
compliant, and "good old fashioned" PC's will be built for a period of
(years?) time.  I guess this means that if you want to avoid TCPA, then you
can choose to buy a PC without if for a while.  Eventually you won't have a
choice, but hopefully by then Linux would run on TCPA PC's and we can
continue using the OS that we know and love.  Personally I don't like the
idea of TCPA, but given Microsoft's track record on DRM, etc Windows users
probably won't have a choice but to use it.

There is a third option I guess...  If Linux/BAD, etc was able to gain a
large share of the new PC market in the next 18 months or so, and refused to
support TCPA, it could become viable for PC manufacturers to produce TCPA
compliant hardware for windows users and "good old fashioned" hardware for
Linux/BAD, etc users.  Of course there's possible interoperability issues
there because TCPA is involved at the network level as well if I remember
correctly.

Jim.

this is a complete crock.  surely intel/AMD etc are going to make non TCPA
stuff?  anybody else on here thinks this stinks?  any thoughts about if it
will get off the ground or not?

Also from the same site.

Welcome to www.notcpa.org

 Wondering "Why am I here"? You should. You really should.

Here's what Raife has to say:


 &gt;&gt;"What is the "TCPA" (the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance)?
 Allegedly, this is a 'multi-company'
 'alliance' created in an effort to
 'improve computer-security', increase
 'WEB commerce', and stop, 'software', and
 'media', PIRACY (This 'alliance' also pays
 HEAVY 'lip-service' to "consumer-choice").


However, the REALITY is that it is...
 ...fundamentally, a narrow-monopoly's
 attempt to ELIMINATE choice, DESTROY
 consumer-rights, and gain...
 *ABSOLUTELY-CONTROL, OVER, the 'end-use' of
 personal-computers.*

 This can EASILY be seen by examining the
 "requirements", implicit in the "TCPA" standard.&lt;&lt;

You think he's a paranoid nerd? No, he's not - he's totally right,
unfortunately. Read on.
