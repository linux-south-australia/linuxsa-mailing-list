Or company is in the middle of producing a custom soultion like this
Basically you have a client (seems i will be in charge of doing this in 
php) which we have currently as a windows application. The client logs 
onto a server or several servers which can be local, of over a network 
and search through the knowledge base. Clients can also add to the 
knowledge base if the have the right permissions

&gt;Disaster!!

&gt;Ugh.  My boss has gone directly to one of our Technical Writing staff to
&gt;try and organize the creation of a "knowledgebase."
&gt;
&gt;This is disastrous, because I've had phone calls and I've had questions
&gt;from him regarding the following two technologies which are making me
&gt;dry reech as I type this email:
&gt;
&gt; - IIS 5.0
&gt; - Compiled HTML or Compiled Help or whatever it is.
&gt;
&gt;They basically want a knowledgebase that can be browsed/searched online
&gt;via our Intranet (which would now have to incorporate IIS.. rip my heart
&gt;out) and then they want a version of it which can be portable -- so that
&gt;our site guys can take it away with them and use it whenever they are on
&gt;site.  They modeled it on the Citect Knowledgebase (www.citect.com)
&gt;which is exactly what they want to replicate.
&gt;
&gt;His answer is to use a product called Doc2Help (blech!) which generates
&gt;Windows Help files and HTML navigational things out of Word Documents.
&gt;So basically the answer according to him is to create WORD documents,
&gt;generate them into some CHF navigationable/searchable engine and compile
&gt;it into a distributable format.  All of which it's able to do, but
&gt;really grossly and disturbingly.
&gt;
&gt;My obvious answer would be to create a php front-end to a MySQL database
&gt;and just store all the articles in there, be able to search it, edit it,
&gt;whatever using our Intranet.  The problem is, what about the portable
&gt;version they want?
&gt;
&gt;What can I suggest that will make this hideous nightmare go away? lol
