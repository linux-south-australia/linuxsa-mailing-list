&gt; I'm interested.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the RFID systems I've looked at have been dissapointing in that 
&gt; they don't give enough information to triangulate the location of items, 
&gt; but there are a few that do.

Trilateration can do the same thing. <A HREF="http://www.uk.research.att.com/bat/">http://www.uk.research.att.com/bat/</A>

&gt; It would also be nice to see something written formally that says that 
&gt; RFID's won't give you cancer, although I imagine it'll be a few years 
&gt; yet before that becomes a scare.

The bat mostly uses sound, just some RF.

&gt; Ideally I'd like to be able to dial an extension in the phone system, 
&gt; and have it ring the handset nearest to the person with the matching ID 
&gt; tag :)

The bat system has been doing that for years. It's installed in some
hospitals so it is at some level of production use. I think Olivetti even
sell the gear now (AT&T UK labs used to be Olivetti, as long-time VNC
users will remember.) I spoke to them when I was doing some work on
building management systems and they appeared to be doing small volumes of
commercial work without wanting to advertise for fear the volume would get
too high. I have no idea who owns the Bat product, sounds like there's at
least one person on linuxsa with the incentive to find out though :-)
