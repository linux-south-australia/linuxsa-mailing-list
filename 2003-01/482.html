Alan,

| Yes, BSD has been something I've been thinking of getting into for
| a while, but it has a few disadvantages - I would have to learn

The BSD world is *awesome* for development, judging by your requests its a
mindframe that you'll really love.

| an entire new kernel, the device support is (or used to be) less
| comprehensive than for linux, and the current contract is specified
| as being specifically for linux (and it is mostly in the kernel).

In regards to supporting hardware, its very close to Linux these
days, supports loads of things (most webcams linux does, most soundcards
linux does, even nvidia 3D acceleration).  If you want to stick with Linux
though, Gentoo's definitely worth checking out... its Linux, but it provides
the kind of "world" BSD does, which makes it really ideal for development.

| I looked at the Gentoo web page. It sounds very good indeed.
| But I can't find where I pay to get a bunch of CDs.
| Is it download only?

Should find some ISO's, there's several ways you can install it - by
downloading a very small (40mb) image, then "building" the system yourself
with instructions given on the site - ie you do partitioning/building of
compilers, shells, etc yourself.  Sounds painful, but its all step by step,
so it isn't too unpleasant (of course, there's always the normal ISO with
everything already precompiled).

Only disadvantage with BSD/Gentoo/Debian is that they're strongly internet
driven - that is, packages/tarballs are continually downloaded when you want
to build/install the latest and greatest app.  I'm on 56K, and I'm suffering
with FreeBSD/Debian boxes.  :-(

I believe you can get a "frozen" branch of tarballs on a 4-5 cd set,
ask DSL - he has a distrib network for this kind of stuff.  I know FreeBSD
does for a fact, but not completely sure about Gentoo.

| If so, I'm in trouble with my 33k modem link.
| I've found it here for sale:
| <A HREF="http://www.everythinglinux.com.au/cat/distributions/misc">http://www.everythinglinux.com.au/cat/distributions/misc</A>
| At A$10, I guess this is a single disk without the big heap of
| software that a 7-disk set gives.

Yah, thats one thing SuSE has always provided.  I used it going back 3-4
years now before I had an internet connection, and it was great in regards
to having everything I ever needed on the 6 cd set.

Just like Redhat/Mandrake/most other distribs these days, they seem to have
gone more user friendly, and less "friendly" for us older users :-(

R
