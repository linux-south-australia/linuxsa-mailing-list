Quoting Andrew Galdes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:AGaldes@elders.com.au">AGaldes@elders.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; I have custom installed RH8.0 over a previous install of suse and found that
&gt; xmms isn't working from any user including new users. 
&gt; 
&gt; When starting xmms, it loads fine. however, it will not play anything.
&gt; Pressing play will bring up the "Open" window asking me to select a song to
&gt; play. Selecting a song and pressing play just repeats the story. 
&gt; 
&gt; I have cleared the /tmp directory of anything likely to be the cause. I have
&gt; reinstalled xmms. Anything else I should try?
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

Are you trying to play a mp3?  xmms under RedHat doesn't support mp3 natively 
right now due to licensing concerns - there are RH8 RPMs with support available 
from 3rd parties on the web which are meant for RH8.  Google will help.

And before people get on the bandwagon, I don't blame RH for going down this 
path - distributors haven't been given immunity from MP3 licensing costs, so a) 
Red Hat would have to charge more, and b) their freely downloadable ISOs would 
have to differ from the "supported" ISOs.  Go Ogg Vorbis go!

OTOH, if other sound files don't work as well, look at what sound daemons you 
have going, that might help.  I don't believe there's been any change there, 
but it wouldn't hurt to check.
