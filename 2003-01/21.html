&gt; Everybody seems to have no idea at all what "community" means
&gt;
and yourself seem to be included in that list. If you have a look at my 
personal page you might find I do know what community is, I have participated 
and volunteered in the community for many years. Do you have a similar 
commitment to those around you?

My project isn't  "ANOTHER community wireless project" at all. Nor does it 
set up to be different to those you named. Wireless is just the medium that 
the project uses to deliver to the community. The overriding goal is to break 
down the digital divide and create opportunities for lifelong learning.

I want to pull together the technology that is already available in community 
wireless, AirNet, Internode and to a lesser extent Airstream already have the 
expertise. Why would I want to recreate an already proven wheel?

This technology will be used to deliver the project to premises of clients, 
sporting facilities, supported housing, community venues, private citizens. 
The gathering and dissemination of information will involve the local 
community and provide them with a discussion and learning venue.

The project hooks into present TAFE initiatives to provide localised 
education opportunities using the wireless connection back to courses stored 
on the server and when needed the Internet to get to their Tutors etc.

The project hooks into the Internet for both information provision and 
commercial access by utilising the telco licenses of Internode/AirNet 
therefore removing the legal question. Both of these companies are aware of 
the project and both feel there is a role they can play in it. Until 
Airstream can resolve that side of the equation they wont be able to provide 
the links but there will be other avenues where they should be able to 
participate and share their knowledge to the benefit of the community. I am 
not sure if there is an option to co-locate equipment but I am sure that 
Airstream would like to be able to negotiate to see if such an outcome is 
possible. It would be my hope Airstream can leapfrog onto this project to 
build their network out into the northern suburbs. Time will tell.

&gt; Its because yet another brightspark has the
&gt; initution to start another group up, instead of getting the community sense
&gt; together and working with current groups to actually achieve something.
&gt;
That was almost nasty and quite uninformed of you. I have verbal support from 
City of Salisbury, City of Playford, TAFE and other bodies. I have been to 
about 8 or 9 community meetings and discussed this concept with a whole raft 
of people at various levels in federal, state and local government and 
community organisations. The concept has been developing over the last 6 
months and is now settling to the stage where I can define concrete elements 
and start to bring the concept together.

Present estimates are that we will need about $1.5 million for this project. 
I would like to better this figure but that depends on the level of community 
support that the project can build. The major cost will be infrastructure to 
build and install 10 Community Access Points, some in City of Playford, most 
in City of Salisbury.

The money is available from the Federal Sustainable Regions funding, just 
that the project will have to show it can deliver sustainable benefit to a 
large portion of the community in those two cities. I believe that it can.

Instead of knocking on the basis of a very rough draft why not offer 
constructive support and see just how good this project can be.

Cheers,  Ian
