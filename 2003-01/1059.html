Well, I don't know.

I have a FreeBSD 5.0 system here, running Samba 2.2.7a, and I want to
enable ACL's.  I want to utilize them in such a way that I can
manipulate ACL's from a Windows workstation and have those ACL's set on
my samba server.

I've searched and searched and searched and searched and searched and
searched and searched and searched and I haven't been able to find a
great deal of information or any HOWTO's that explain what is required,
or how exactly *to* implement ACL's.  As far as I know it, UFS2 supports
ACL's.

So I mounted a partition in /data.  I newfs'd it specifying a file
system type of 2 (UFS2.)  Then I couldn't tell exactly what was going on
with it, because when I remounted it, 'mount' still reported it as UFS.
I was directed to have a look at tunefs, and I ran 'tunefs /dev/ar0s1g
-a enable' which told me ACL support was now enabled.

Now what?  I have enabled in smb.conf:

nt acl support = yes
inherit acls = yes
inherit permissions = yes
