&gt;&gt;Ian, you did get the answer you probably 
&gt;&gt;wanted in the first place, I see - there is something called 
&gt;&gt;'dansguardian' which might do what you need under Linux, by the sound 
&gt;&gt;of it.

&gt; many thanks for the support. Seems that you have ben one of the few who
&gt; have been listening to me instead of preaching to me.

Dansguardian combined with SquidGuard works a treat too. You can also 
use the Squidguard blocking lists within Dansguardian.

The Dansguardian word filter is relatively good. You can tailor it to 
block based an how many 'bad words' you want to allow the intended 
audience to see in one page. This is based on an estimation of age 
group. Eg: young adults vs kindergarten children. This can be weighted 
towards allow the page to be seen, for example, if the words "breast" 
and "medical" are on the same page it might mean that the page is most 
likely not porn oriented.
Given that, nothing is perfect. This is of course compared to the rest 
of the content of a given page.

You do get some interesting messages in a system log when there are 
replications or errors in the filter/word lists. :-)

Dale.
