Back in BSD4.1ish sockets worked slightly differently.  I think it was
listen that you called to block and wait for a connection, although
that was so long ago that maybe it's now something different which
we used to call :) Anyway, the point is that you got to inspect the
incoming connection before accepting; you could call peerinfo to find
out who they were, and reject if you didn't want to talk to them.
The reject system call seems now to have gone by the wayside, so it
seems there's no way to peruse the list, not even the first element,
without actually accepting.  Most people probably just accept and then
close if they don't want to talk.
