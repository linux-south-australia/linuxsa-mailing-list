Until today I though that I was the only sucker having problems with this 
stupid card.  My original criteria for choosing this (Windows) hardware was 
that "Creative" has a good reputation for driver support in Linux for the 
classic SB cards.  

Boy was I wrong about the emu10k1 chip.  The driver in the 2.2 and 2.4 
kernels didn't produce so much as a squeak.  Next I down-loaded both 0.5 and 
0.9 ALSA drivers and compiled the kernel and drivers over and over again with 
different combinations of modules in and out (there are a few drivers in the 
standard kernel which must be removed to prevent conflicts).  I had to track 
down several bugs including wrong arguments in one of the module loading 
configs and an init.d script which kept destroying the devices in /dev (could 
be just a Debian thing).

When I finally got it working, the sound would come out of the "rear" jack 
(the black one), but from time to time it would change over to the main 
(lime) jack.  Recently it stopped playing altogether.  Backtracking to 
previous kernels and modules didn't fix it so out of desperation I 
down-loaded the Source Forge Linux drivers pointed to by the Creative web 
site.  Yay, this produced a much easier installation and it actually worked 
right out of the box, no bugs.  

My joy was short lived however.  Ryan's email arrived this morning and 
started me tinkering with quality issues (until now my attention was on a 
system to rip my CD collection and create a mp3 juke-box with random 
playlists etc).  Now, I'm not very fussy about music quality but I could tell 
that something was very wrong with my set-up.  Shock, horror, there are no 
tone controls available for the drivers which I've just installed.  I tested 
three mixers, and none of them can access any tone controls.  Furthermore, 
the equaliser which is bundled with xmms has no effect on the sound output.

Dual booting to Windows to use the OEM drivers demonstrated that it is indeed 
possible to make the output sound acceptable to my (not so golden) ears with 
just a little extra tone and bass.  Why didn't the emu10k1 drivers permit 
tone control? after all, the ALSA drivers had all sorts of adjustments.  Then 
I remembered something in the FAQ which came with the Source Forge drivers.

Q.B2- I want to develop Live drivers -- can I get a copy of the Emu10K1
specifications?

It may be possible for us to arrange to get you specifications. You'll need
to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Visit the Creative developer's home page
for more info on how to become a registered developer.

That would explain it.  Open source drivers for SB Live! are SB Crippled! 

A little later I discovered that the left channel is not producing any 
output.  That's the last straw!  Now I've got an excuse to buy something 
which works with Linux.  Endorsements or recommendations by LinuxSA 
members would be much appreciated at this stage.

&gt; Hiya,

&gt; Music's a huge part of my life - my biggest hobby is collecting music,
&gt; usually CD's when I can but mp3's[1] when I can't (afford them, heh!).
&gt;
&gt; Even when I buy CD's, I always rip them to ogg/mp3 (lame with optimal
&gt; settings).  Quality is a *huge* thing for me.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know if its just me, but my SB Live! Value card has always sounded
&gt; like trash under any OS apart from Windows (I use xmms to play mp3's).
&gt; Using Creative's drivers, or the kXmedia drivers (awesome 3rd party drivers
&gt; made by a russian dude) on Windows has always resulted in my mp3's through
&gt; winamp sounding so clarified its not funny.
&gt;
&gt; FreeBSD's drivers sound bloddy horrible (unfortunately, one of the reasons
&gt; why I'm using Linux right now), and Linux is better, but still nowhere near
&gt; as good as Windows.  I've tried the emu10k1 drivers in the kernel, alsa's
&gt; drivers (which sounded worse, and the OSS emulation was terrible last time
&gt; I tried them), and today emu10k1 drivers from sourceforge, which was a step
&gt; up again, but it still doesn't sound right.  The sound's not clear - I
&gt; mean, its acceptable for most people, but its irritating the crap out of me
&gt; *g*.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody else had experiences with this, and has suggestions on making the
&gt; card sound a whole lot better?
