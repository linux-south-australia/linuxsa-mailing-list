<H1>VPN and forwarding</H1>

I have a symantec firewall box connected to an adsl router through one port,
and through another port I have a switch connected. So basically the data comes
in throught the adsl router, through the symantec box and then out through to
the switch to the server and workstations. We are also running VPN connections
remotely into the server, and all seems to be going fine.

Our Internet provider could not provide a means of measuring the data coming in
or going out. So I placed a linux box with two ethernet cards between the
symantec box and switch, which graphs the data via a little program called
ifmonitor. I set up iptables to do the masqurading between the two ethernet
cards, which is working fine.

The ip ranges are 192.168.0.9 on the symantec box leading into 192.168.0.5 on
the linux box, and out through the other network card is 192.168.1.9 and a
fileserver of 192.168.1.1

Prior to the linux box being in place the symantec box was 192.168.1.9

The symantec box has vpn settings which pass the connections through to the
server 192.168.1.1, but since installing the linux box between the symantec box
and server, vpn sessions do nt work. I guess this has something to do with the
masqurading or forwarding and my lack of/incorrect settings.

Do I need to set up vpn on the linux box or should I be able to forward the
requests via iptables ?

Any idea's or references to web sites appreciated.

I am running Redhat 7.3 with iptables V1.2.6a


Thanks

Wayne
