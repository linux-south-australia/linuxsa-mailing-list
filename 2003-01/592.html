&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; For the entire 7.x series and release 8.0 of RedHat's distribution, I
&gt; and a number of others have had problems when trying to recompile the
&gt; kernel from the sources provided by RedHat. Has anyone worked out what
&gt; black magic is required to build a RedHat kernel?
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried using my usual build method, which works on all other
&gt; distributions I run. I have also tried (on a freshly installed
&gt; kernel-source-* RPM) the RedHat Way(tm):
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/ch-custom-kernel.html">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/custom-guide/ch-custom-kernel.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried using an unmodified .config file from the configs directory.
&gt; The architecture I'm building for (as well as the CPU model) all match,
&gt; but it doesn't compile.
&gt; 
&gt; The errors I see are different depending on which build process I follow
&gt; and which .config options I use, but more often than not, gcc complains
&gt; about syntax errors. The kernel headers also match the version of the
&gt; kernel source and gcc is being called with the '-nostdinc', so it
&gt; shouldn't be the fact that the kernel includes under /usr/include are
&gt; not the version as the kernel (but rather the same as the kernel that
&gt; was used to build glibc).

I think I got this to work once, and I think I posted the secret sauce to 
LinuxSA at some stage. I think it is Makefile cruft left around.

You have to move the .config file out of the way, then do a 'make 
reallyclean' or something like that, and then move the .config file back, 
and then you are right.

Red Hat seem to have got this wrong for a long time.
