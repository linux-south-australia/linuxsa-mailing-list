Yup,

I havnt seen the earlier parts of this thread, but i thought id butt in
with my half-cocked theory.

I recently tested a redhat wlan setup running p2p with a windowsxp
machine.
If i didnt supply a constant flow of traffic (in this case it was a
constant icmp ping) the client would 'unassociate' its self.
Unfortunately i dont have any logs to indicate what was going on, the
client would just "disappear". This turned out to be a problem with the
silly windows (sp1 fixes it). I have successfully set up both clients and
AP's using both FreeBSD (my favorite) and RedHat8.
If i was rich id just buy a harware AP from d-link, beats pulling hair out
over bridging, routing and ARP proxying, but i have learnt a hell of alot
in the meantime, which is allways good.

Cheers

&gt;
&gt; It looks like this is the case - tcpdump on the firewall
&gt; shows some sort of link level pack being transmitted
&gt; every 100 millseconds when running under 2000,
&gt; even when I've switched off all the networking
&gt; options.  Now I have to determine whether this is
&gt; being done by the driver or the firmware ...

&gt; Still after anyone's wlancfg ... anyone, anyone?  Bueller?
