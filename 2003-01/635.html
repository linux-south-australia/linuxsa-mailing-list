David, you should go back to wearing dark sunglasses, those
rose-coloured ones just don't suit you mate &lt;VBG&gt;

The situation is, the public access computer at the Salisbury North
Footy Club has been attractive to 'lads' with a devious bent who have on
3 occasions left very explicit wallpaper on the screen to shock the
more reasonable patrons that have to walk past the computer setup to get
into the lounge and gaming room. T

Under instructions from the management of the venue the options are,
lock the computer down and ensure that porn sites are not accessible to
anybody, or take the computer out of that venue. So I locked it down
tightly using W2K.

I want to provide a Linux system for the community to try out and it
would have to be under the same restrictions. No way for the user to
mess about with the system AND strong parental controls so that no porn
could be accessed and no wallpaper changed. 

Hence my request.

Now can we please continue the discussion having accepted that the site
controls are a 100% neccessity in this very public situation.

cheers,  ian
