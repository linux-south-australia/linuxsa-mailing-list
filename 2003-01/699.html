Hi Everyone,

Just had a question regarding fail-over configurations.

We are currently looking to put in a webserver that must stay up most of 
the time :).

i.e. 10-15 mins downtime now and then (maybe once a month) is probably 
tolerable, but nothing more than that.

As the machine is likely to be storing many 100's meg of data or even 
gig's, restoring from backup is not really an option.


We are currently looking at running a secondary server that will sit 
side by side the primary webserver. It is likely that we will either get 
the firewall to monitor the machines and re-direct traffic if a machine 
goes down, or run something like heart beat on the machines.

We will be using a mysql database on the primary with replication to the 
secondary machine, hence the database is not a problem.

The main problem is that there will be many files sent to the primary 
machine that will need to exist on the secondary machine as well.

The 2 options currently considered are:
1. Writing our own daemon programs to sync up the 'data' directories
2. Using something like ENBD (enhanced network block device). In which 
case the secondary server would make some disk available for the primary 
  webserver to incorporate into its RAID. Hence we would have 'real 
time' mirroring over the network.


A further option (which is out of our budget) would be to use an array 
of scsi disks on a controller that could be plugged into the secondary 
machine should the primary machine die.

I was wondering if anyone has had any thoughts on this, or and 
suggestions on how to implement high-availability web-servers. I'm sure 
that this must be a common problem!

Cheers,

Jon
