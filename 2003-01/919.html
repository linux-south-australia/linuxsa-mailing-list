Thanks for the hint, I'm a happy little camper once again.  

The utility described by the README is used to compile digital signal 
processing (DSP) code and load it into the SB Live card using "emu-dspmgr".   
I used this to reset the L-R volumes.  The idea of being able to change 
controls and signal paths would explain the freaky behaviour I've had.  Some 
process has apparently changed the paths to the output hardware in the recent 
past.  I've spent quite a bit of time with the ALSA drivers and didn't see 
any mention of it in the docs.  The Creative/Source Forge drivers are onto a 
good thing.

Sound quality experiments....I've been playing the same material side by side 
using xmms, gqmpeg, mpg321 and the CD drive.  They all sound different, its 
so confusing!  I'm currently grumpy about the xmms equaliser, it has no 
effect on the output and I've been through every option in xmms and all its 
plug-ins in an attempt to unlock its function.  I figure that if I could 
sweeten the sound to my taste with the equaliser then the emu10k1 drivers 
would be exonerated.  The dsp utilities have a 5 band equaliser but I've run 
out of Linux time to hook it up; maybe tomorrow.

Anyone out there using the xmms equaliser, any hints??

&gt; I'm running the same drivers as you are, and there are bass & treble
&gt; controls.  They're just not installed as per default.

&gt; I'd suggest you read this:
&gt;
&gt; emu10k1-v0.20a/utils/as10k1/README
&gt;
&gt; Still makes it sound nowhere near as great as Windows, though.
