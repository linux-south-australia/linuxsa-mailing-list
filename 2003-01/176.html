Quoting Andrew Galdes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:AGaldes@elders.com.au">AGaldes@elders.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; My system died over the xmas break. Logs indicate that it ran out of memory.
&gt; I have removed all un- needed services and the system seems to be ok again.
&gt; This is a bad look though, what can I do to minimise the risk of this
&gt; happening again?
&gt; 
&gt; I have build some bash scripts myself and these may have problems, I am
&gt; looking at this.
&gt; 
&gt; The system is running redhat 8.0 and has only 64mb ram. It is always using
&gt; swap space. It does do memory intensive work. Is there a way to "flush" the
&gt; RAM perhaps?
&gt; 
&gt; Ideas are welcome...

Sounds like memory leaks...

a) X is often the cause of memory leaks.  Run in run-level 3 and "startx" 
should keep your box up a lot longer.  That's only a good suggestion if your 
box is a server - if it's intended to be a workstation that's another story...

b) (Big) X applications typically leak memory too.  Leave these running at your 
peril.

c) I've found that 2.4 kernels will use all your RAM (and that's on my 512Mb 
laptop!), but that's nothing to be overly concerned about.  Most of it is 
cached data (I've had over 384Mb of cache at times!) - it should be making your 
computer run quicker.  You only need be concerned if it's thrashing (i.e. 
constant disk activity).
