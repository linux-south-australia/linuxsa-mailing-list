I have been reading the responses to the original posters question, and most 
seem along the lines of "any reasonable LCD display should work", which is 
fine and true for those LCD displays with analogue (VGA) connectors.

However I do not know about the rest of you, but if I was going to fork over 
the money for an LCD display, I would want one with a DVI connector for the 
best possible picture quality (after all, unless you are desperate to save 
space, image sharpness is probably your number one goal in buying an LCD 
display - so why try and re-generate a digital image from an anlogue signal).

At the moment my understanding is that linux support for a full DVI digital 
signal from the video card is somewhat patchy, and not always supported in 
the GPL drivers, however if you buy and LCD that supports DVI input, you can 
always activate it later when you get a new card, or linux support for your 
particular card comes along.

As an aside, the current king of monitors seems to be made by IBM. Check out 
the specs (and price - ouch) on this beauty:

Now that I have got my own answer to the question out, I can use that as a 
pretext for my own monitor related musings:

1 .. I have always spent far more money on my monitor that the actual CPU, 
and never regretted it. Whilst I might upgrade my CPU every 2-3 years, the 
monitor should last a good 5+ years easily if it is a quality item. I am just 
at the stage of pondering whether to upgrade my current monitor (a little 
known brand, Cornerstone, but very good specs and quality) to an LCD. However 
my gut feeling is to leave the LCD display for another 18 months, and since 
my current monitor is still going great guns, I might as well. 

However when I do buy an LCD display, I will try and select the biggest, best 
quality one I can afford, as I will be looking at it for a long time. 

As far as Computer hardware goes, I personally have a philosophy that the 
three most important items are (1) the monitor, (2) the chair !, and (3) the 
keyboard. 

So long as the CPU is reliable and reasonable speed, it is not really that 
important to me personally (well, with the exception that it should be as 
quiet as realistically possible). I understand that other people have other 
priorities, especially if they are heavily into gaming or number crunching, 
but if you are at you workstation for any length of time I think that comfort 
and ergonomics are an important factor.

2 .. If I do go out and buy an LCD display, even one coupled to a fully 
digital output, there is still the odd concept of "refresh rates" for the 
display and card. 

To quote Seinfeld, "what is the deal there ?". I would have though having a 
fully digital LCD display would make video card design (at least the output 
stage) so much easier. Can't we now directly correlate LCD pixels with video 
card memory, and only update the display when an area of memory changes ? No 
RAMDACs, at least.

Why update the LCD display 60/70/85 times a second when mostly (except for 
movies and games) it never changes ? If I open a new window in whatever 
window manager I am using, the video RAM changes just where the window is 
opened - can't the card notice this and say to the LCD "change pixels x-y". 
If no other pixels change for 30 seconds, then no further comms between the 
LCD and card should be needed for that time.

It is easy for an armchair engineer to say these sort of things, and I am 
sure there sound reasons for how things are done currently, it is just 
puzzling. 

If next week there was a breakthough in LCD design that greatly increases 
resolution (eg by decreasing pixel pitch, or allows fabbing of enormous 
displays, or a combination of both) we would currently have no way of driving 
all those pixels through the current interface technology (although 
converting all window mangers and applications to fully vector based system 
to take advantage of the increased resolution would also be a small problem !)

The IBM monitor mentioned above only works at its highest resolution when 
driven in a tiled or striped mode by *multiple* video cards, and I believe 
that one of the reasons is that the max bandwith suppored by the DVI spec is 
not enough to drive that many pixels at a reasonable refresh rate.

So we still have a way to go I think .. but is interesting to see the tech 
emerge. Just my 2c.
