&gt; No, but Microsoft had the perfect opportunity to get rid of the Windows
&gt; 98 branch with Windows XP.  Did you see a Windows 2000 "Home" edition?
IMHO they did - most of my friends with recentish computers have XP.
(Even when the computer came with 98/ME). Admittedly it is XP Pro most
of the time.

&gt; Windows 2000 was still seen by many as the "Professional" operating
&gt; system for some reason, rather than the one best used for home.  Having
&gt; really crappy legacy support was also a major downfall, and it still is.
IMHO that's what led to not being a 'home' OS. A number of games and
older apps just didnt work.

&gt; When it was released, Windows XP could have brought together Windows 98
&gt; users with Windows 2000 users if they'd wanted, but they decided not to
&gt; to do that.  They decided to create two identical products, and then
&gt; seperate them down the middle by changing some end-user features, giving
&gt; it a new login screen and reducing its price.  Looks to me like Windows
&gt; XP Home is the next step in the '98' stream, and Windows XP Pro is the
&gt; 'NT' stream still going strong.  I'd say the stream goes something like
&gt; this
Again, XP Home is the 9x stream only in sales. What's wrong with a "Home
desktop", "Workstation" and "Server" differentiation? They all have
different aims, given reasonable pricing differences I figure it's all
fair enough. (Besides, the pricing only affects people who buy Windows
not, say, Linux ;-)

&gt; They could be doing this on purpose, so that if their Palladium garbage
&gt; makes it to the commercial desktop, we'll probably see the one client
&gt; and one server from now on.  Until Unix undermines Microsoft of course
&gt; :-)
"One client / One server" is what they've been pushing since... well,
forever I think ;-)

&gt; It's obvious their development path went down two ways, and although
&gt; their technology is now all NT-based, they are still targeting a Windows
&gt; 98 market.  This chart represents the releases.  To me at least, Windows
&gt; XP Home is the 'next step' in Windows 98's foulness, even though it's of
&gt; NT-design.
I don't know, everyone I know has Pro not Home :D

&gt;   Windows 95		Windows NT 3.5
NT 3.5 was never built from 3.11, it was a totally seperate O/S from the
start. (It was going to be a brand-new OS/2 actually!)

You missed Lindows ;-)

&gt; They could be doing this on purpose, so that if their Palladium garbage
&gt; makes it to the commercial desktop, we'll probably see the one client
&gt; and one server from now on.  Until Unix undermines Microsoft of course
&gt; :-)
Again, that's been their aim the whole time. (Not the Unix bit of course
;-)

Advogato had an article recently, with some great stuff:
