Heh, ah yes, of course. Now that you point it out, it's pretty obvious. ;)

 From what I've seen from Theo, it seems like quite a, err, restrained 
response. This guy admits he's a newbie, asks a bunch of questions that 
he could have found out for himself, or just picked up over time, 
cross-posts to at least two lists, either of which may not have been 
freebsd-chat and the OBSD equivalent and in which case would have been 
on-topic. I'm suprised he got off so lightly, especially if he did post 
to technical lists.	

Anyway, what makes you wonder about the wisdom of such a response? It 
sounds like Theo regards Arief's questions to be rhetorical at least, if 
not completely un-answerable or just plain pointless. He illustrated 
this in a restrained way, at the same time he gave an example as to why 
he thinks this is the case and the example he used could be understood 
by most people, regardless of their technical background. I think he did 
quite well; managing to kill a few birds with the one stone, in a 
not-terribly-abrasive manner.
