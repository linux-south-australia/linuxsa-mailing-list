&gt; "Sermon" completely irrelevant.

not so, it was a clear thrust through the verbiage that had been going
on here instead of reasoned discussion. I certainly appreciate him
stepping up to the mark on my behalf.

&gt;  Ian has asked the question and been 
&gt; given answers which he prefers to ignore.  I don't know why.

I have been given a great deal of flack and in the majority of cases it
has been irrelevant to the situation that I have been speaking about. I
don't need a sermon on the rights or wrongs of access to the Internet, I
have been an advocate of this for many years. I don't need a sermon on
the futility of trying to make a silk purse out of a sows ear. If I had
even believed one percent of that I would never have taken up Linux and
neither would many of us here. If you wanted something to be perfect
Linux aint it but hey it sure is fun trying to get it better.

&gt; Why Ian want's to rant on about the importance of porn-blocking rather
&gt; than respond to the solutions that have been offered I really can't
&gt; say. 

Ian is not "ranting", I have been responding to the claptrap that has
been presented to me as arguments why I need not have bothered trying.

When it is a case of doing porn blocking or not having a computer in a
public venue then what direction would you choose to follow? That is the
choice that faces me. I have no other options available to me. 

Many of you are aware that I desperately want to get computers into
public venues and I desperately want to have these computers running
Linux instead of MS. Hence my wish to build the Northern Neighbourhood
Network. Look at the flack I got for that suggestion.

Why is it that my goals of bringing Linux to the masses continue to get
such a heated and negative response? Is there elitism amongst the ranks?


Cheers, Ian
