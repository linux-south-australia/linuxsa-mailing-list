By rectangular euro plug I guess you mean scart? The big ones with about
20 pins or something, and a slant across one end? If so you can get an
adapter from jaycar, that will break that down to composite and stereo
audio. Or there is one that has svideo as well. www.jaycar.com.au, and
do a keyword search for "scart".

Then If your tv card has a line in, you can do that and remove the
quality loss at the RF conversion stage. If your tv card only has RF in,
then about the best you can do is make sure you have high quality
cables. In the case of RF, the channel is usually 0 or 1. There is also
often a switch to give you 2 channel options on the back of the vcr,
which should tell you what the two possible channels are, and which one
you've got selected. 

Good cables will make a big difference. I swapped my video cable from a
cheap 2 meter cable, to a better, but still cheapish jaycar cable that
was 5 meters, and the picture looked substantially better, with greatly
decreased ghosting, despite being 3m longer!

&gt; Ye olde Stereo Video player (Hitachi) has an RF output plug on the back and 
&gt; one of those rectangular Euro A/V plugs (there is some stereo audio outputs 
&gt; as well) The TV card on my PC will play Videos if I run a cable from RF out 
&gt; to TV in on the PC. I have to find the correct channel on xawtv for it to 
&gt; work. It is like 597 Khz or something. The sound quality is only passable. 
&gt; Question is should I be doing this some other way, that may give a better 
&gt; result ? Software settings are PAL, with Television as the input source and 
&gt; the Aust frequency table. The player does not have any other output.
&gt; 
&gt; I am happy with the TV card. Dmesg makes all of the correct "noises" etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone played around with this ?
