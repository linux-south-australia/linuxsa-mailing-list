Just a point!!

"Despite Sun’s claim that their high-end servers are highly reliable and
built with redundant components, customers report that failures in service
processors, controllers, processor cards, and other components have caused
entire production systems to fail. "

Sounds like hardware to me.  If the hardware craps itself, it doesn't
matter what OS u are running it will die!!
I have played with Win2k RC2 server and advanced server.  It was woefull.
Our NT4 machine (which has a slower processor and less ram and was actually
doing stuff was wee bit faster than the Win2k (dunno how much debug code
that is)  I also deceided to put a hard drive (2.1 gig) in it with a few
bad sectors.
It got to about 1 gig and died (locked up. no screen of death or anything)
I have since wacked it in my linux box, lost all of 2 meg and runs
absolutely fine (mind you, I fsck it every boot).   I certainly won't be
recommending it to the boss.

Andrew
