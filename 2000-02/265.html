That certainly is the question that Microsoft, and not co-incidentally Red
Hat, hope that people ask.  It's a question that presupposes you will
upgrade.  The real question should be why would anyone using Product
version X be interested in upgrading to Product version X + 1.

Too often people fail to ask why they should upgrade their working system.

I have no problem with my 5 year old SCO systems.  What's a new OS going to
do for me other than cost time and money to install?  Do I need the latest
WU-FTPD if the machine doesn't use FTP?  Do I need symmetric multi processing
on an old 486 uni-processor?  How will threads, kernel or user, make any
different to a non-threaded application?  Does it matter that the sendmail
that came with the install tape is full of known security holes when the
system is in a secure environment?  What value is there in support for all
the latest graphic engines when the machine doesn't even have a screen?

I think the main reasons why people automatically upgrade are twofold:
First, there's keeping up with the Jones; and second, there's an uneducated
fear that the old system is somehow insecure or incomplete.  Actually the
second reason is often spot-on target; and I should explain that
"uneducated" means "without knowing the details".  Is it too much to expect
people to know what the details are?  The answer, so it seems, is yes.
