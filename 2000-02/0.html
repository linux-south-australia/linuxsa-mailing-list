The fix was relatively round about, however this is what I had to do

1) Reinstall Windows 95
2) Purchase Windows 98 First Edition Upgrade
3) Install it
4) Install the drivers that came with the motherboard

This wasn't as easy as it sounds. The drivers helpfully convinced
Windows that the Secondary IDE port didn't exist. Hence, I had to
manually override the "AMD" specific IDE drivers with the generic IDE
drivers, which were promptly overwritten by the "AMD" specific drivers.
Basically, the disk "half" installed the drivers as Windows does and
installs the rest at reboot. Except if you wipe support for the second
IDE port where my CD ROM is AND the drivers are on the CDROM you're in
trouble.

5) Download the latest driver from nvidia itself
6) Install that

After all of THAT it worked. I am not convinced whose fault this is,
there are many possibilities:

1) Microsoft write Windows for genuine Intel board sets only and other
board sets simply don't get along with the generic drivers
2) AMD stuffed up
3) MSI stuffed up
4) Nvidia stuffed up

Personally I think it's a combination of the whole lot. Anyway, thanks
for everyone's help.

Incidentally I have decided to write a kernel rebuilding howto and an
Xconfigurator howto (THAT INCLUDE SCREEN SHOTS). In addition I shall
polish the RedHat ppp howto that I wrote and post it to Netcraft/LinuxSA
organisers as well...

[rofl...soon the tips page will be full of Davids, Sharpes and
Bennetts...what a wonderful combo!!!!]
