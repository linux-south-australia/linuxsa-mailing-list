&gt; From what I understand, you need two ISDN lines if you want to use two

&gt; This also means that you will need two ISDN Modems

No, that shouldn't be the case.  Ye olde standard Microlink (now OnRamp
2, or whatever the Malaysian equivalent is) is a 2B+D ISDN connection,
meaning it has 2 64K data channels (for user use) and 1 16K signalling
channel (for call setup/tear-down).  The data channels can be operated
independently (ie, one could be used to place a data call while using
the other for a voice call), but the most common mode these days is
to aggregate the bandwidth using PPP Multilink.  To do this, however,
is a modem specific thing, meaning that Raj won't find the information
residing in any Linux documentation; rather he is going to have to read
the documentation that comes with his modem.

&gt; The ISP that I work for has a 128k (ie 2x64k) ISDN connection to Telstra and
&gt; it uses two B-channels on our Portmaster

Which is probably using two channels out of a Macrolink/OnRamp 10/20/30
(30B+D), with the remainder being used for incoming modem calls.
