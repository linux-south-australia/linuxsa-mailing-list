I think that Directory Services is the direction of the future while the NIS has been around for a while. I think that LDAP has "a better way" of "doing" "shared services" .

&gt; Subject: 	NIS or LDAP
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I have been considering setting up NIS for my home
&gt; network (I also enjoy banging my head against walls). I was
&gt; talking about this to someone the other day and they
&gt; suggested that LDAP might be a better way to go. I have had
&gt; a look at both the HOWTOs for NIS and LDAP and they "seem"
&gt; straight forward enough to set up so basically I am left
&gt; with the decision of which one. O.K. I suppose that my
&gt; question now becomes "Which One?". Which is easier to set up
&gt; and maintain? Which is more secure? Why is one better than
&gt; the other? What other pros and cons are there to worry about
&gt; that I may not have thought of?
&gt; 
&gt;     O.K. Gurus (and others) get to it. I look forward to a
&gt; healthy discussion.
&gt; 
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
