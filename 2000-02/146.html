Hi everyone,

First - Thanks for the help with fstab and permissions. I can read, =
write & exec wherever I want now :-)

Second - Re: Andrew & the BIOS update Question. The first thing I would =
try if you don't have a good diagnostic programme is put the HDD in =
another PC(If you have one available) just to rule out the HDD as being =
faulty but unfortunately It Sounds a bit like the bios to me.

Third - I work for a small computer retail/repair company that is also =
an ISP. All my chat about Linux recently has sparked interest in our =
system administrator. He was asking me if there was a Web Based front =
end for our mail server that was available on Linux. So out users can go =
to a web page to check their e-mail. Our mail server is Sendmail  =
running on NT (which he doesn't want to change). We have tried some =
other commercially available packages that do the job but unfortunately =
the pricing has been restrictive. Has anyone heard of or currently using =
a programme that does this. Any suggestions would be greatly =
appreciated.

Regards Matt.
