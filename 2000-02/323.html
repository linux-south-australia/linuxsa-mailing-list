I agree totally. My first distro was Slackware with 1.2.8. It ran on a 386
with 4MB RAM (8MB recommended for X).

The Linux GNU community seems set against bloatware, but it seems the
commercial side is still trying to cram way too much into the apps. Any
given month, this list reminds us of Applix, StarOffice, CorelWP, etc all
lacking the refinements to keep the performance level high.

Corel Linux made some decisions to standardize the installs (the
"cookie-cutter" approach) which leaves out not only the automatic
customizations most people are used to from M$, but even the ability to
customize, especially if one's video card doesn't make their "cut"

For version 1.0, I think it's a good start. Distribution is wide, marketing
is decent. What needs to happen now is that version 2.0 must incorporate
*all* the feedback they have received from their sites. In retail,
salespeople are taught that you have two chances to get it right:
- when you screw up
- when the customer points out the error

If you set it right, usually the customer is OK. If you continue to screw
up, the customer will leave. If CL 2.0 has "vast improvements" over 1.0,
then it'll continue to attract users.
