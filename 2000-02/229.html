&gt; I suspect we will have a go at loading Linux onto her laptop Real Soon
&gt; Now (tm).
&gt;
&gt; The said machine is a Toshiba Satellite 1550 CDS. I have never done a
&gt; load onto a laptop before, dunno what I will face, wish me luck :)))

We have a couple here. They don't have Linux, but the only problem I have
ever seen with Laptops and Linux is the video card. Given that the 1550CDS
comes with an S3 card, you should pretty much be right. Toshiba should really
ship their laptops with Linux - they are a good match.
