I have a strange situation at my hand:
I bought RedHat 6.1 Linux Operating Sytem package to end the frustration 
that I had with the non-installable downloads.  That's not the issue though.
After installing RH 6.1, when it tried to load linux after hitting enter at 
the LILO: prompt, my ChipAwayVirus guard alarmed for the existence of a boot 
virus.  Here is the message that was displayed on the screen:
=================================================================     Trend 
ChipAwayVirus has detected a boot virus on your hard drive.  The operating 
system is not supported by ChipAwayVirus.

=================================================================

I reinstalled RH 5.2, I had no problem.  Then I reinstalled RH 6.1 after 
FORMATTING the drive, I still got the same warning.  I scanned the 
installation CD and the diskette(although I used the same diskette for RH 
5.2 and 6.1) for possible viruses on Win98 using McAfee Anti Virus software, 
but no viruses were found.

DO I REALY HAVE A VIRUS? What am I supposed to do to bring the peace of mind 
to myself.  I visited www.antivirus.com as recommended in the warning, but 
no info was there.  Of course, I contacted their tech. support and told them 
about the situation and I am waiting for a response.  Any input? Do you 
think the Installation CD may have a boot virus on it?
Thank you
Nour Douchi
