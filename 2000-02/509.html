Hi,

I have just sat the LPI exam for Linux Certification.

You can take it a The Electronic Word in Angas Street.

The exam is 60 questions that you can take over 90 minutes, and you do not
get your result back straight away.  They say it takes 6 to 12 weeks before
you get your result posted to you :-(

The exam is not easy.  You have to carefully look at each question and in
many cases eliminate the wrong answers and rely on your experience as well.
 I was satisfied with my answers, but not certain that I had achieved the
95% that I wanted :-(

A number of questions required that you know options that would be passed
to commands to achieve a result, where I would usually use the man pages to
find that out.  Other questions required that you think carefully about
what a command (sequence) would actually do.

All-in-all, it is not the sort of exam where you can take a Linux course
and then just pass the exam.  Prep materials will probably be forthcoming
soon for the exam.

The cost was AUD165.  For those interested, the first 300 to take the exam
get some sort of a freebie from various organizations, but it is a lottery.

You can cheat in a sense in some questions, because you can review your
answers, and the answers to some questions are obvious in the form of other
questions.  So, simply go back and review and look at all the questions.


Regards
