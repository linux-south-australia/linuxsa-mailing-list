&gt; The problem arose when my comp wan't shut down

&gt; 
&gt; All was then ok. However, I then went to mount a floppy
&gt; ie mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy  my system just shutdown
&gt;    and rebooted. I did it again and again and the same thing happened.
&gt; 
&gt; I then noticed the mountd had *failed* when booting up.
&gt; 
&gt; Would it be better to run e2fsck on all the partions?
&gt; Would this fix all the errors of the partions more thoroughly?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know how to fix mountd failing?
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone help?

Mountd is a networking mount daemon. It is used to allow NFS (Network File
System) connections from other machines. It has nothing to do with
mounting the floppy drive.

Since you had to run the drive check manually I'd say something has become
corrupted on your filesystem.

Since the problem occurs when you try and mount the floppy disk I'd say it
was a kernel module. Either: floppy.o or msdos.o

If you are running redhat try and reinstall the module package
(kernel-modules). You may have to force the reinstallation (rpm -i
--force)

As for fixing mountd. If your not going to use NFS you won't need it. Run
ntsysv in redhat and simple deselect it. (You may want to remove netfs and
portmap as well)

Cheers,
