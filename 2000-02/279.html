Hi.

All very reasonable.

The only problem with Microsoft's position (apart from their boisterous
self-serving attitude) is that they have made a logical error in comparing
themselves as an OS vendor with Sun as an OS/Hardware vendor. The two
cannot reasonably be compared because windows does not run on sun
Hardware. They should declare that Windows with such-and-such hardware
specifics is as/more/other reliable as Sun's xyz server.

Replaceing a Sun server is only a victory for MS if the Sun Server is new
and failing. If it's an old crock than likely any new computer would be
more reliable hardware wise.

It's all marketing hype that doesn't bear inspection. Hey, MS is good at
that - that's how they got so big!

&gt; &gt;Sun claims to be a leader in system reliability and more reliable &gt;than 
&gt; &gt;Windows. The Reality: Major customers, such as Quote.com, are switching 
&gt; &gt;from Sun to the &gt;Microsoft Windows platform because it offers better 
&gt; &gt;reliability.
