That's right - this is the difference between "transparent" proxying and
"real" proxying.  In real proxying, the browser knows that it is
connecting to a proxy, and knows that the proxy has no way of
determining
the original site that the browser wanted to connect to, so it passes
this
information in the URL it is trying to fetch.

	"GET HTTP://www.microsoft.com.au/ HTTP/1.0"

All browsers (well, all that I know of) do this when they are configured
to use a proxy.  On the other hand, if a browser is configured to direct
connect to a web site, it has no way of knowing that you're fooling with
the networking behind its back; it thinks it's directly connecting to
the
site in question, so it passes a "normal" HTTP GET method.

	"GET / HTTP/1.0"

What squid does is take the destination IP address of the incoming
connection (this is what ipchains REDIRECT gives you) and the
Site:/Host: header (I can never remember exactly what it's called)
if available and uses that to establish the outbound connection.

&gt; Squid then complains to the client that they have not typed in a correct
&gt; address.

At least squid is getting the URL requests, and correctly, from the
looks
of it, so I would say your ipchains configuration is correct.

&gt; How do I get ipchains to pass all address info to squid. Can anyone point me
&gt; to some obscure references to Transparent Proxies that I may not have looked
&gt; at yet?

I'll repeat this from my last email:  Have you configured squid for
transparent proxying? Have you (from looking at the FAQ on nlanr.net,
searching for "transparent", and finding the relevant section which
took all of 30 seconds) done -

	http_port 8080
	httpd_accel_host virtual
	httpd_accel_port 80
	httpd_accel_with_proxy  on
	httpd_accel_uses_host_header on

?  Have you then restarted squid to make sure it loaded this new config?
