Hi There,

If any one has any experience with restoring/fixing partition tables
please read on. I am in a lot of trouble.

I have had a very tough couple of days. On thursday night decided to
create a partition in some unused space on the hard disk on the server
at work. At 9pm on thursday I had noticed that I had completely screwed
it up. I had deleted the drives /usr /home. My biggest mistake was the
fact that I did not have a backup  of /usr and my most recant backup of
/home was 9 days old.

After working a 28 hour day I had restored normal services to the users
in the office (bar their 9 days worth of data). To get the users up and
running with out changing the contents of the screwed hard drive I
booted the server of my crappy 3.2 GB IDE hard drive (some what of a
downgrade form their 18gb ultra2 scsi HDD).

The problem is essentially that I have incorrectly partitioned my hard
drive. To fix the problem I have tried a program called gpart (guess
partition).  Unfortunately it was not all that useful (the program is in

its early stages of development). I have also tried writing a file
boot.0800 (which had not changed since before my little accident) to my
mbr using dd but unfortunately no luck (when I did this the partition
table hardly changed.).

I have 3 questions:

1. Can any one recommend any software for automatically rebuilding a
partition table?
2. Is there any hope for the lost hard disk? Should I just salvage what
I have and start again?
3. Are there any people in melbourne who would be able to help for a
fee?

Regards

James Morgan
