&gt; To take this discussion further, we have purchased Windows 2000

&gt;
&gt; By all means, give Windows 2000 Server a try but don't rely on it for
&gt; anything critical.  You can just about hit Linux with a hammer and it
&gt; doesn't care.
&gt;
&gt; Oh ,before anyone comes out with "That's not the final release, yada yada
&gt; yada", yes it is.  As a school we can get software under the software
&gt; select agreement and the Windows 2000 suite has been released to CPM&S or
&gt; as they are called now Volante` (Does anyone else think that sounds like a
&gt; table wine)?

&gt; $0.02

Does that mean you *paid* for software?

I have seen Beta 3 and not counting the bugs / stability thing, I would still not
run it. This is based on performance alone.

Whoever thought of running a GUI with things like pretty animations and fading
menus and things, on a server? Surely the system resources could be used better
somewhere else (like the database that's meant to be running, or the web server
that's meant to be serving out HTML).

Bah Humbug.

Can anyone enlighten me as to why someone *would* go with Windows 2000? Note:
I am not trying to start a fight, I just want to know if there is a valid reason.

Matt
