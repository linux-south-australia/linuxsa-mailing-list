&gt; Topic: Linux doesn't make it in the real corporate world.
&gt; 
&gt; So there you have it.
&gt; In a serious work environment, where people
&gt; are paying me money to write reports, they
&gt; cannot read my documents correctly, and I have
&gt; to effectively abandon linux.

I personally don't see how you can equate "serious work envionment"
and "word documents". As suggested by someone else, you should be
using a document formatter for technical documents, or, if you must
use a word processor, use Applix. Applix is by far the most superior
Office suite for the PC. It's document storage format is ASCII, so it
could almost be termed a document formatter if you like. What about
latex, lyx, etc.

The problem isn't that Linux isn't ready, the problem is that people
like you honestly belive that OS/Word-processing success equals
compaibility with word. 

This is rubbish.

Prepare your documents the way that you prefer. If an inferior format
is requested, you are probably not working in a "serious work
environment".

&gt; Well, now I'm going to buy an external disk and
&gt; PC card to load windows onto.
&gt; This is a real pain!!!

Interesting, because in my "serious work environment" I have not been
in contact with a microsoft operating system, nay product, since I
started.

Chant this mantra.

"If you wish to communicate with me, do not send me a word document."

Cheers

Alex!
