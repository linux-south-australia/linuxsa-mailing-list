Well People of Linuxland, it appears that Swann Communications does wish to
retain their Linux customer base - read the below attachment from Swann
Communications.

Here is an example of the power of the Linux community.  Hardware vendors are
coming to realise that the Linux community is not some laughable group of
pimply faced pizza and coke addicts sitting around pushing random buttons.

I am still keen on starting a list of known Linux friendly harware vendors /
ISPs in South Australia.  All we ask is a bit of information about our
hardware so we can set it up.  We don't need them to do it for us, we just
require the information.

I have always been very pleased with my my Swannsmart modem and Primus.  The
problem I find under Linux is not the quality of product, but the level of
support we Linux people often receive.

All we ask for is the information required so that we may offer support to
other Linux users in our position.  We don't expect them to, as they probably
do not receive any Linux training.  We appreciate this.

I don't mind spending a little time setting up a web page to offer assistance
to set up hardware under Linux, aimed at new initiates.

It has just finally got to me that not one hardware vendor or ISP that I have
contacted has offered any Linux support what-so-ever, or even mimimal
technical assistance so that we can work it out ourselves (which people of
Linuxland often enjoy doing, hence saving them labour costs, and everyone is
happy).

I am not biased against Microsoft, I just think they display utter contempt
for their customers, so I gave Linux a go and have not looked back since.

&gt; Hi Ian,
&gt; Thanx for your mail again. With reference to your mail further, please note
&gt; somewhere due to misunderstanding and incorrect conclusions drawn from the
&gt; earlier mails, we sincerely do aplogize for the same.
&gt;
&gt; a.) The Swann Smart 56K External Modems basically works under any software
&gt; profile/base programs.
&gt;
&gt; b.) The Modem is specifically marketed as of for PC and Mac users because
&gt; over the past experience and usage under these platforms, we can provide
&gt; the right support and assistance to our customers.
&gt;
&gt; c.) Over a period of time people have been buying and using our Swann Smart
&gt; Modems and using it under various Operating platforms, viz... Windows (any
&gt; version), Mac, DOS, Unix, Linux, Lotus Notes, etc...
&gt;
&gt; We specifically do not market our Modems for any OS Platforms other than
&gt; Windows or Mac because we have not much used them under other OS
&gt; enviroments.
&gt;
&gt; The affirmed reason of being so very strict about the Mac and Windows OS
&gt; environment is because if we say yes to you/other customers and manipulate
&gt; that the Modem does support and works successfully and overall cannot
&gt; provide any Technical Support then that leaves us with more of risk and
&gt; undue liability.
&gt;
&gt; We certainly once again do apologize if we have upset your opinion about
&gt; the reliability or usage of our products but the real facts remain that our
&gt; Modems dynamically do work for all OS enviroments but the Technical Support
&gt; restrains to Windows and Mac users only.
&gt;
&gt; Also note in your very first mail you did request for some AT Commands. We
&gt; can send you a comprehensive listing of the entire AT Commands (as an
&gt; attachment file) which will enable you to use the type of AT Command and
&gt; test the right features out you require to know. We also need to know if
&gt; you have Acrobat Reader first though, as it is in *.pdf format.
&gt;
&gt; Your second request about the error you are facing could be because of the
&gt; TCP/IP Settings (internally), though not much sure.
&gt;
&gt; Please feel free to let us know any of your further queries or if Technical
&gt; assistance required. We respect and value the interest  that you have shown
&gt; in all your past mails about the usage of Swann Modems under Linux OS with
&gt; us having backed off, we assure you that we will assist and support you as
&gt; far as our Technical Expertise can do.
&gt;
&gt; Thanking you in anticipation.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps.
&gt;
&gt; Best Regards.

&gt;
&gt; Dear Tech Support,
&gt;
&gt; Indeed it does.  The box does have two colourful logos (one for Mac and one
&gt; for Windows), but no mention of only supporting these operating systems.
&gt; The only warning regards connecting to AUSTEL permitted or certified
&gt; equipment only.  However, thank you for the advice.  I will pass your
&gt; warning on to local and national Linux user groups for the benefit of those
&gt; who wish to purchase hardware for use under non Windows / Mac operating
&gt; systems.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi Ian,
&gt; &gt; Thanx for your mail. With reference to your mail, please note that on the
&gt; &gt; boxing it is mentioned though that teh Modems are for Windows 9x (OS).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; Dear Tech Support,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Perhaps in the future Swann Communications should place a warning on the
&gt; &gt; packaging to this effect
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you,

&gt; &gt; firstly
&gt; &gt; &gt; we do not sell the Modems for Linux/Unix Environment and also we do not
&gt; &gt; &gt; have any drivers supporting the Modem under that environment.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to get my Swansmart v.90 / kflex 56k modem set up under
&gt; &gt; &gt; Linux.  Please provide me a with a list of the command set for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; modem, and any recommendations for setting up my modem under Linux.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The connection keeps stalling and sometimes I also recieve a error
&gt; &gt; &gt; message 'connection reset by peer' - afterwhich no data can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; received..
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!
