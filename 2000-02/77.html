Actually, I beleive he ment you have to be root to do 'make install',
because it writes to directories that only root has write access to. make
should be available to all users, so they can write their own programs, so
executing make should not be a problem, since /usr/bin is normally in the
path on most systems.

Anyway, to Craig Mann, who was the person who posted the first message:
try doing a "make" or "make all" before trying "make install". I looked at
the readme file in the driver tar.gz, and it's hopeless. It says to install
the driver, do a "make install", but it forgets to tell you that the driver
must exist before you can install it! To build the driver, you should need
to only do a "make", but that depends on how they made the Makefile.

If the help you have received is not enough to help you, may I ask you to
tell us what commands you entered and what error messages you get, so we can
be more certain to what the problem is.

Good luck,
Andy

&gt; Hi Craig,
&gt; as Damien also replied, if you are root, then you will be able to
&gt; run the make
&gt; program. However, you do not HAVE to be root to run it. It
&gt; depends on where you
&gt; are doing the installing and compiling.
&gt;
&gt; The way it boils down is this:
&gt; - when a user logs in, they open a shell which communicates with
&gt; the operating
&gt; system kernel.
&gt;
&gt; - depending on the shell the user is running, a hidden 'rc' file
&gt; will be run when the
&gt; shell is initiated. If the user is running bash, this file will
&gt; be called .bashrc and
&gt; should be located in the user's home directory. If the file
&gt; doesn't exist, you can
&gt; create it with your favourite editor.
&gt;
&gt; - a user can run more than one shell that connects with the
&gt; kernel, ie. each xterm
&gt; that is opened is running a shell that is connected to the
&gt; kernel. Each shell has
&gt; a range of environment variables, that can be viewed by typing
&gt; 'env' at the command prompt
&gt; of that shell. One of the variables is called PATH, and looks
&gt; something like this:
&gt;
&gt; PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
&gt;
&gt; - the PATH environment variable is used by the kernel to look in
&gt; the directories specified
&gt; in the PATH variable (separated by colons ':') for any of the
&gt; commands you type at the command
&gt; prompt.
&gt;
&gt; - you can add directories to your PATH variable by specifying
&gt; them in the .bashrc file (if
&gt; using bash), ie. you would have a line like the following:
&gt;
&gt; export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin
&gt;
&gt; - this line means  you wish to add the path '/usr/bin' to
&gt; whatever is already specified by
&gt; the PATH variable.
&gt;
&gt; As Damien said, if you type whereis make, the whereis command
&gt; will find the location that
&gt; the make command is located in. Another command you could type is
&gt; which make, which would
&gt; try and find the make command in the paths specified in your
&gt; shell's PATH env variable.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Your problem depends on what error messages you get back after
&gt; typing make install. If
&gt; you get something along the lines of:
&gt; unable to install in drectory xxx
&gt;
&gt; then the problem is probably that you should be doing the install
&gt; as root, as only root has
&gt; access to some of the directories (like /usr/bin). If you get
&gt; something like:
&gt; command not found
&gt;
&gt; then the problem is probably one to do with the PATH variable.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps, and apologies for the verbosity,
&gt;
&gt; regards,
&gt; Andrew O'C
