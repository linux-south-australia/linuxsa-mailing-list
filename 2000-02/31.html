Without giving away too many company secrets, we run Pick on Topix, and as
described by others, you can print almost anything (including logos) to
basically any printer that will accept escape sequences to control the printing.
We've got serial and parallel receipt printers, both thermal and impact,
Lexmark, HP and other Lasers, and Fuji line printers.  Of course, if you've got
a Laser (or other) printer with ethernet, or an ethernet print server, and your
*ix box has ethernet, you can print directly to the printer with IP.
Don't bother to ask me how to control print jobs...I look after the hardware and
comms!
Getting plain or even formatted text to print would probably amount to looking
in the more detailed manual with the printer.

Hope this helps a bit.

Cheers.

Hi.

David is correct. Pick is definitely not unix.

I don't know R91, but I've used R83 and more modern variants, currently running
'D3/Linux' on RedHat.

I reckon you could use almost any printer apart from winprinters. We run Lexmark
Optra with great success. We have used canon, HP, Fujitsu, Epson, Brother,
Star!, and all sorts of interfaces from serial and parallel through to network
(which your R91 box probably doen't have)

How they work depends on the application on the pick box, but you start with
plain text and go as complex as you like. I have heard of people storing company
logos in the pick database and including them in their printouts, but I have
never tried that.

&gt; OK thanks for the (somewhat terse) coments...
&gt; I'm just going by what my customer told me ( "It's kinda like Unix")
&gt; I'd never even heard of pick up until yesterday...
&gt; The company that sold them the software is no longer in business from
&gt; what I've been told...
&gt; Any one else?
