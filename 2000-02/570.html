&gt; Hello DOMAIN\Everyone.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Linux Server.  It's soon to become two Linux servers.  It
&gt; is running Samba, and windows NT and 95 clients access files from it.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to be able to use a GUI that runs in Windows 95+ to
&gt; change the security settings on my Samba box, similar to the way one
&gt; can use the NT Explorer program to change permissions on normal NT
&gt; shares.
&gt; 
&gt; My reason for this?  I have working with me a guy who's background
&gt; is Windows NT, and hasn't yet had Linux training.  I need him to be
&gt; able to set appropriate file security on the shares, without using
&gt; the Linux command line.
&gt; 
&gt; What are people's thoughts and/or opinions on this?  Is there a
&gt; program that will do what I want available?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 

Nick,

This is possible to do. You can install the NT server tools (available
from many places - I can leave them somewhere for you to download). You
can then edit the Unix file system permissions on a Samba server by
right clicking the files/directories --&gt; properties, etc, etc... The
best versions of samba to try are 2.0.6 and 2.0.5a. You will want to
keep your eye out for the alpha version of Samba TNG (The Next
Generation). It is at prealpha 0.7 at the moment, but already allows
domain control, NT management tools like User Manager and stuff. It
isn't stable yet, but it's looking great.

You should find that the server tools and latest version of Samba work
OK.

Hope it helps,
Matt
