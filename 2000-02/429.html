I just have a quick question regarding your statisical data gathering and
interpretation method.

It is this, Which do you use? Is it based on a sample population which is
then extrapolated to the general, where the sample is completely random and
taken from a wide and diverse group (usually around 10% is nice and we take
all the Linux users on the planet this is a very big group) or is it based
on "I personally want to get a point across and facts don't matter"
statistics method (generally used by some government agencies to say how
good they are doing/bad some other agency is doing).

This is regarding your statement "I also know that a lot of linux users are
operating dual bootable machines.....".

This is a pretty bold statement, I am not saying this is wrong or right (I
don't have those statistics and am not going to start a survey here).

How do you define the word "lot", as 1) all my friends running Linux are
dual booting, 2) I am dual booting, 3) I know most people on the planet who
run Linux and they are dual booting...

Just wondering???

To everyone else, sorry about the rambling, just had to get this one off of
my chest.

Rob.

Subject: SPAM ?


&gt; Hmmm love SPiced hAM.
&gt; Well I dont consider the information I sent to be spam but then again what
&gt; exactly spam is, is a matter of each persons perception.  I considered
that
&gt; I was supplying some useful information to a group of computer users and
&gt; that information may happen to offset some internet users ISP costs?  I
&gt; agree that alladvantage is not linux compatible and that is a pity but I
&gt; also know that a lot of linux users are operating dual bootable machines
and
&gt; still running Windows and Mac O/S's!  For future reference the
alladvantage
&gt; group is working on a linux compatible version at the moment.
&gt;
&gt; I will gracefully bow out of this mailing list.  I have enjoyed my time on
&gt; the list and wish everyone all the best.
