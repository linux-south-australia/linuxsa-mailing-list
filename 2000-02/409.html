&gt; &gt; if anyone can tell me what this means and what stupid thing I've done to
&gt; &gt; cause it, I'd really appreciate it.
&gt;
&gt; the only thing that came after a quick search on my system was the GNOME
&gt; desktop manager rpm.
&gt;
&gt; are you running this?
&gt; check with rpm -q gdm.
&gt;
&gt; if so, (I'm not) then check out the doco which apparently is in
&gt; /usr/doc/gdm*/
&gt; (do a rpm -qil gdm to find out what files are where)
&gt;
&gt; this may either get you started, or lead you down the garden path. Mind
&gt; the GNOMES :)

Yep, that was it, thanks very much for that. What the problem was I'm not
entirely sure though, I played around with the gdm.conf file for a while but
that didn't seem to have any effect. In the end I just un-installed and
re-installed, that's fixed it. Once again thanks very much for helping with
an annoying little problem.

Cheers,
David Creed.
