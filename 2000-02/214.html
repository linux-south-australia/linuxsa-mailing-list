not me, but a friend (you now who you are, Mr. 28u) has had great
success with 2000 at a client site - especially with thing like
application packegs. Log in, and the software you are entitled to is
installed. Anything not supposed to be there is removed (or at least

but these days I reckon the hardware could take it.

Terms like "tree" and "forest" are funny though.

Lastly, from the MS page:
"Want more facts?
