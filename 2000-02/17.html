&gt; I added the alias line to /etc/conf.modules and printtool detected my
&gt; printer on /dev/lp0 perfectly (as it should!).  It seems that 6.1 deosn't
&gt; add this line automatically, where as 6.0 does somewhere along the line.
&gt; 
&gt; And I would think hard if anyone else here with 6.1 considers upgrading
&gt; the modutils package.  I tried it and it really messed things up (reading
&gt; from different files, and after that was corrected, my sound modules
&gt; failed to load properly at boot time).

Alternatively, do the upgrade anyway, but make sure you read the excellent
documentation on Red Hat's web site in the section called "6.1 upgrade
gotchas".

Upgrading is important if you want access to the latest tools and
improvements in an OS.

Don't be too harsh when an upgrade to a system is a little more
complex than clicking a file and watching a bar graph fill up. It is a
"good thing" (tm) in my opinion if there are caveates and "gotchas"
when performing an upgrade, because it is a good sign that the
underlying technology has been changed and therefore (hopefully)
improved.

Having said this I just realised I'm still using RH 4.2.
