Hi Everyone !

First : My Name is Matt. I live in Port Lincoln. And I'm a linuxholic
(HE HE)

Actually I've just installed Linux for the fist time ( Thanks to the APC
linux pocketbook ) and I have to admit.
I LOVE IT !!!
But there is one small problem I'm having.

When I installed linux (redhat 6.1) I selected to not install lilo & to
use a boot floppy. I figured this was the best way to keep my Win98
fellow computer user (i.e. Girlfriend ) happy. She can happily turn the
computer on and play her solitaire  in Win98 without knowing any
different.

The problem is this . I've compiled a new kernel, one with sound support
for my ensoniq sound card. I've changed the lilo.conf to suit loading
the new kernel, but of coarse, its only installing it to my linux
partition (It does this very well though) I've tried to make a new boot
disk, but I can only seem to make one of my current kernel and I cant
boot my new kernel (therefore being able to make a new boot disk of the
new kernel) until I make a new boot disk. Is this what you call catch 22
?!?

I've tried playing around with my current boot disk (BAD MOVE!!) - a
linux rescue boot from the cd & an fdisk /mbr & sys c: from my Win98
boot disk later I finally got my system back up and going again .

If any of these ramblings make sense to anyone - PLEASE HELP. Basically
I need to make a boot disk for a kernel  I'm not booted into.

TIA
Matt :-)
