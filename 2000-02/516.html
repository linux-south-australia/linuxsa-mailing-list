&gt; &gt; Hi all.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am attempting to compile and install the 2.2.14 kernel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a Western digital 18.2G UDMA2 Hard disk on an intel TX board.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is that the kernel compiles fine, the modules compile and
&gt; &gt; install fine.  I added the kernel to lilo and ran lilo.  Rebooted.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The kernel boots OK.  The problem is that when it gets to the partition
&gt; &gt; check
&gt; &gt; of HDA it fails and complains about reading past the end of the device.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After this, the kernel attempts to mount the root FS and fails because
&gt; &gt; of the error above.  Kernel panics and that is the end of the story.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The RH6.1 kernel (stock off the pocketbook) boots fine, however.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have read all the documentation that I have available, but I cannot
&gt; &gt; find
&gt; &gt; the reason for the problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anybody know the cause of this problem, and can you point me to
&gt; &gt; where I can find more info or a solution.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Adam

&gt; Sounds very much like a disk geometry problem. What is the biggest IDE
&gt; drive supported by your motherboard? Check out the Large-Disk HOWTO.
&gt; Although, I did once have a disk that said it was a certain size, but
&gt; whenever you tried to access within a certain distance from the end of
&gt; the disk, it would do the same. Hmmm. If it's not one of these, I'm
&gt; stumped. You could try booting off the same disk in a different or more
&gt; recent machine. This will help you find out where the problem lies.


but why the problme with different kernels?
I would have thought it could be something like not compiling in ext2 or
something, but then it wouldn't have worked at all - not just the end of
the device.

mmm ponderous
