I tried this.  I -r removed all .gnome* files, but to no avail.

I then tried copying the nsmail and .netscape directory to a new account, but netscape won't find my mail folder, even after chmod / chown -r on all files..

Any ideas?  I'm rather stuck.  At the least, how can I import all my Netscape files into a new account?  This is the second time this has happened.  Are there bugs with the RH6.0 distribution?

Thanks again,

Ian

&gt; Ian,
&gt; have you tried just removing the .gnome directories from that account?                                          Those directories contain the current setup of the account you copied them                                      from (root?) and will be difficult to massage for the new account. The                                          files are created automatically when they don't exist, so when you next                                         login under that account, the default .gnome* directories should be there.                                                                                                                                                      hope this helps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                regards,                                                                                       !
