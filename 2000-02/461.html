Hi all,

First a report. Linux madrake 6.1 loads straight onto a Toshiba
sattelite 1550 cds laptop. Preparation time (scandisk, defrag, backup)
approx 1 hour, load Linux approx 30 mins, configuration... well the rest
of my life probably.

Currently trying to configure sound. I have an ESS module to compile and
try. Not sure if it will work yet, will let you all know. X looks ok at
800x600 at 16bpp. I used 'generic monitor svga multisync' as the monitor
type in Xconfigurator. It works, a bit clunky, but it's a start. Config
seems to have detected the PCMCIA card, with the correct modem and
network card types being reported in /var/log/messages. I have not tried
either yet, will report later.

Boy am I impressed. The level of first-time capability and ease of
set-up (so far) is very cool indeed.

Any clues as to what would be a better monitor type to select in
Xconfigurator (lcd types crash X), or monitor specs to use for a '12.1"
dual-scan supertwist nematic LCD screen?'

The installation hw probe found the S3 ViRGE/MX 2MB card, and selected
the SVGA server. Should it be running an S3 server?

By the way, my 13yo daughter (you remember, the naive one who prefers
Linux to Windows cos Linux doesn't crash and it costs less) still has
her naive preference for Linux. Now I have to buy her an Applixware
licence to make her happy. Has anyone on list seen the new version 5.0
yet?

Thanks for the encouragement and help to those who helped convince me to
give it a go.

Cheers,

Bruce

now how the heck do I raise the dough for a laptop for me??!!
