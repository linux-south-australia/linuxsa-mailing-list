&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     O.K., so you know the security implications of doing
&gt; this, but I am still dying to know WHY? Maybe you have an
&gt; application that the rest of us may not have thought about.
&gt; Maybe you have an application that the rest of us HAVE
&gt; thought about and maybe someone knows of a safer way. I
&gt; can't think of a reason you would want to do this, but that
&gt; doesn't mean there isn't one. TIA.
&gt;     Cheers!

I had one once - real time linux.

Needed the machines to be networked, and they were all running RTlinux,
and so the only usefull user was root - since only root can insert
kernel modules, which is how RTLinux works.

This probably isn't the reason for this thread, but there you go.
