<H1>A quick question about mounting HDD</H1>

I'm trying to mount my 2 Win98 partitions using  fstab. Here's the file

/dev/hdb5                 /                               ext2
defaults                    1 1
/dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom              iso9660
noauto,owner,ro    0 0
/dev/hdb7                swap                        swap
defaults                  0 0
/dev/fd0                   /mnt/floppy              ext2
noauto,owner           0 0
/dev/hdb1                /mnt/cdrive              vfat
defaults                     0 0
/dev/hdb6                /mnt/ddrive              vfat
defaults                     1 2
none                        /proc                         proc
defaults                    0 0
none                       /dev/pts                    devpts
gid=5,mode=620     0 0

Now both partitions mount automatically fine. As root I can save, open &
Delete fine.
But I've been told I shouldn't work In root unless absolutely necessary
I've also been told I shouldn't leave my Win98 boot partition mounted
all the time. In fear of recursive deletes or something. My ddrive
doesn't matter so much as its mostly just non essential data (but it
does have a spare 10 gig on it so i would like to be able to utilize it
)
My problem is this.
As my normal working log on I can't  unmount or mount these drives and i
can only open files on them . I cant save or delete files.
I would like to be able to do this. Is there something I need to do to
the priv's of my user logon(?) or can I set it  up in fstab.

Thanks In Advance .
Matt :-)

BTW : the SAIA Seminar must be at 2:30 (is that what they were trying to
say?)
