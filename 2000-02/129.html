What about putting PIGLET on CD-R's for those that don't have the bandwidth to download it? I would pay for it. Anyone else think its a good idea?

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Red Hat Linux 6.2 Beta (Piglet) has now been released; I've included
&gt; Red Hat's announcement below.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to try it out, you can download it from:
&gt; <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/redhat/redhat-6.2beta/">ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/redhat/redhat-6.2beta/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Geoffrey.

&gt; 
&gt;   Tired of collecting Beanie Babies and Pokemon cards?
&gt; 
&gt;   Christopher Robin called last night complaining about the lack of
&gt; collectibles pertaining to the famous "Pooh" show. Eeyore, of course, said,
&gt; "I dooon't knooow aboouuut this".... But what does Eeyore know anyway?
&gt; 
&gt;   The result:
&gt; 
&gt;                         PIGLET
&gt; 
&gt;   This is no ordinary pig! Stand back folks, he's large and live and ready to
&gt; rumble. This pig is knocking back CPU loads of 99 whilst having tea and
&gt; crumpets with Pooh Bear. This bad boy eats Lizards for breakfast and spits
&gt; out kernel patches. Approach with caution, he could be dangerous!
&gt; 
&gt;   PIGLET: Your once in a lifetime chance to have this rare collection!
&gt; 
&gt;   This is a limited time offer, when we run out of bits, they'll be gone
&gt; forever. Don't miss out folks, the Internet lines are lighting  up, they're
&gt; going like hotcakes, and we can't guarantee availability on this item for very
&gt; long! Similar items we have provided in the past are now going for over a
&gt; ONE MILLION percent gain on the original price tag of $0.
&gt; 
&gt;   PIGLET includes the following new features:
&gt; 
&gt;         - A new and improved Anaconda [tm] installer
&gt;                 - Partitionless installs
&gt;                 - Improved X Configuration
&gt;                 - Additional GUI Partitioning tool
&gt;                 - Software RAID Configuration in Kickstart Installations
&gt;                 - RAID upgrades
&gt;                 - ATAPI Zip and Jaz Drive Recognition
&gt;         - Rescue Disk Improvements
&gt;                 - It works!
&gt;                 - Rescue via the installation CD
&gt;                 - Pico on rescue disk
&gt;                 - mtools on rescue disk
&gt;         - Kernel 2.2.15
&gt;         - Enhanced Software RAID
&gt;         - P III Enhancements
&gt;         - New web based High Availability Configuration Utility
&gt;         - Kerberos Integration
&gt;         - New Window Managers
&gt;         - New desktop backgrounds and themes
&gt;         - Docbook tools
&gt;         - Standard Samba mounts in /etc/fstab
&gt;         - Smaller minimal install
&gt;         - Separate client/server packages for servers:
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;   PIGLET is available now for Intel, Sparc and Alpha architectures. PIGLET is
&gt; ONLY available through the Internet, and ONLY for a limited time!. This is a
&gt; beta release of Red Hat Linux, and we don't encourage using this for mission
&gt; critical applications. However, like most Red Hat beta collectibles, it is
&gt; very usable for:
&gt; 
&gt;         1) Testing those new holographic storage devices
&gt;         2) Installing on all of the machines in your favorite lab
&gt;         3) Seeing what that "Linux thing" is really all about
&gt;         4) Preparing your thesis on "Works in progress"&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   We have created piglet-list for discussion of this beta release. To
&gt; subscribe, merely send a message to <A HREF="mailto:piglet-list-request@redhat.com">piglet-list-request@redhat.com</A> with the
&gt; code word "subscribe" in the subject line, respond to the confirmation message
&gt; request, and enjoy hours upon hours of entertaining and useful messages from
&gt; hackers trying to make this thing fall down go *BOOM*...
&gt; 
&gt;  (With a special thanks to home shopping channels everywhere!)
