Heyas,
I wonder if anyone else has hunted down this configuration file, and can
help me out?

I have two machines, one of which never had gnome, gtk+, or glib
installed on it by redhat, and another that did.
I compiled and installed glib,gtk+ and GNOME on the machine that did not
have them, and installed them, and everything has been fine for ages.
However, on the other machine, that already had the redhat versions, I
removed gtk and glib and compiled and installed a later version.
Everything seems to work, except that I get thousands of messages on the
console that was running X that say "Gtk-warning: cannot find module in
module_path (libpixmap.so)".

Now, I am guessing that this is to do with the fact that the old gtk and
glib were in /usr/... and now they're in /usr/local/...
All I need to do, I presume, is change the module_path to point to the
correct location for GNOME.
However I cannot find where to do this.

Can anyone help?

Toby
