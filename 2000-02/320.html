I have been working with Corel Linux since its release, and supporting the
users of the Corel Discussion Group.

You're right in that there is a lot of work to do on the distro still, and
some of the choices the install makes may not be the best for all
circumstances. I'll answer some of the previous comments:


&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; INSTALATION:- minimal "user" input required - very impressive & quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; fast.. took abt 3 minutes to get to 98% completed then 15-20 minutes
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; do the remaining 2%!
Oddly enough, that's the way it goes (weird, eh?). A problem also exists
that during the 98% period of the install (possibly as it is committing all
the packages and registering them with the DEB manager) some PCs will take
up to 45 minutes, others lock up forever.

	&gt; I forgot to mention that I tried to install it on a 486dx266 with
32Mb
	&gt; ram, 1.2gb hdd Panasonic/SBlaster 2xCDROM, ne2000 network
card.....  it
	&gt; appeared to only support IDE cdrom - the install screen locked 6
times.
	&gt; I could not find a "true" custom install nor was there a "modules
disk"
	&gt; type option.

The install routine avoids detection of a number of devices (like ethernet
cards). Perhaps this was done to limit the chance of hardware conflict, or
maybe just because they wanted it that way... I found it kind of slow on the
486-33 with 32MB RAM, but anything above that is usable. More speed and
responsiveness can be gained by not installing unneeded packages, like
servers, etc.

	&gt;In the partitioning install screens you can select "Take over Disk
	&gt;(erases all exsisting information)" OR "Edit partition table(for
	&gt;advanced Linux Users)" - I chose the latter & was not game to even
see
	&gt;what the first one did cos the last time I said yes to an option
like
	&gt;that on a Linux Install, it wiped my entire hdd without asking!!
	&gt;Interestingly there is another option "Use free disk space(keeps
	&gt;existing information)" which was unavailable to me!! (An M$ type
	&gt;cripple????)

This part also needs work. Some people have reported that Corel Linux finds
only one drive at install time. I usually suggest letting CL take over the
whole drive. Remember, this distro is aimed at the desktop replacement user.
They wouldn't expect you to be running other OSes as well.

One other major thing to watch for: Check your video card against CL's
Hardware Compatability list. The install routine actually runs inside an
XF86SVGA server. If your video card is not compatible with that server (as
it is, with no changes), then you could have problems installing CL. If your
card is not 100% comatible, you will get through the first part of the
install, but when the Xserver runs, it will eject your CD and reboot. I
wonder if using the XF86VGA16 server would have provided better results.
(Once CL is installed, you can change card definitions, color depths,
resolutions, etc no problem)

Not to detract from the other offerings, IMHO CL Linux is overall a great
distro in its own right, with innovations that, even though imperfect, will
probably be picked up and improved upon by the other distros. 

Cool features:
- Bootable CD
- Graphical install
- Corel Update - allows easy package installation and upgrades, even
checking on dependancy packages

Needs work:
- The 98% install bug
- The installation run-time XServer is too fussy
- Netscape Navigator included (not Communicator)
- "ps -A" option not available (unless there is a replacement) I *really*
miss that!

Anyway, if anyone has a spare 500MB HD around, this is well worth the try.
(please let me know if you have any problem installing; I am still tracking
the bug)
