To take this discussion further, we have purchased Windows 2000 
professional and Windows 2000 Server.  You really really need to tip-toe 
around that.  It is quite easy to make it crap itself.

By all means, give Windows 2000 Server a try but don't rely on it for 
anything critical.  You can just about hit Linux with a hammer and it 
doesn't care.

Oh ,before anyone comes out with "That's not the final release, yada yada 
yada", yes it is.  As a school we can get software under the software 
select agreement and the Windows 2000 suite has been released to CPM&S or 
as they are called now Volante` (Does anyone else think that sounds like a 
table wine)?

&gt; &gt; In general, if you put an inadequetly powered SUN server under a heavy
&gt; &gt; load it will fail (example Adelaide Uni Student Email server). If you put
&gt; &gt; a Win NT station under a light load it will run well for a long time (many
&gt; &gt; departmental secretaries reboot their Win NT work stations less than once
&gt; &gt; a month).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think I'd still prefer to have any form of non Win NT server for mission
&gt; &gt; critical applications.
&gt;
&gt;I used to run a few NT servers with heavy loads and varied internet
&gt;applications, and I could always get better than 3 month uptimes out of
&gt;them. The problem was having to always tiptoe around any configuration,
&gt;and needing a reboot whenever something was changed. To expand the
&gt;tiptoe metaphor, I can throw a party in an equivalent linux box, and
&gt;nothing bad will happen, and there's never much need to reboot.
