&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So there you have it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In a serious work environment, where people
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are paying me money to write reports, they
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cannot read my documents correctly, and I have
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to effectively abandon linux.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; For a small report MS WORD kind of does the job, but I was
&gt; &gt; &gt; told to write a larger, manual using MS WORD and it was a nightmare.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is a golden rule which is worth remembering: "He who has the gold
&gt; &gt; makes the rules."  In business, if your customer sends you a document in MS
&gt; &gt; Word format, you must find a way to read that document or find a new
&gt; &gt; customer.  If your customer asks for an electronic document in return, you
&gt; &gt; best make sure your reply can be read by Word without losing important
&gt; &gt; details.  You might not like Word but don't make that obvious to your
&gt; &gt; customer.
&gt; 
&gt; I find that in this situation, education is the key. I hsan't failed
&gt; for me yet.
&gt; 
&gt; The customer is very rarley right, otherwise they wouldn't be a
&gt; customer, they'd be doing your job. This applies to a MacDonalds
&gt; employee or CS Engineer. Just remember that beacuse they are wrong
&gt; doesn't mean you are allowed to be rude.
&gt; 
&gt; Keeping the customer without using word shouldn't be a problem for
&gt; most people.
&gt;

Particularly if you tell them that they need to use Microsoft's new Word
Processor, LyX, On their new Operating System, Linux.

He He He...

Give 'em FVWM95 and the BSOD screen saver and they'll never know the
difference. ;-).
