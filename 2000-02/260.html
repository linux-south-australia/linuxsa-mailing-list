&gt;

Obviously just the pretend corporate world.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Star Office creates real kludge .doc files which
&gt; miss out heaps of stuff and do lots of stuff wrong.

Name a Word Processor that deals with non-standard, propietry formats
perfectly. If you use the Star Office format (heaven forbid), you won't have
such problems. I have found that Word 95 doesn't lack too many Word 97 features
and gets converted quite well. If you export it as Word 95 _when you need to_,
there shouldn't be a problem.

If I recall correctly, there was a problem with the Word 97 export actually
exporting as Word 6. Try Word 95.

&gt;
&gt; EPS file inclusions disappear if the EPSI
&gt; picture preview is not done right (and I don't
&gt; know how to do this -- sometimes it works,
&gt; sometimes not). Also, various line spacing go
&gt; wrong, font sizes are wrong etc. etc. etc.
&gt; I've been told by the recipient of my MS Word-97
&gt; outputs from Star Office that they will organise
&gt; for me to have an up-to-date version of Word 97 (or whatever)
&gt; installed on my machine. But it's linux.
&gt; So I guess that means I have to load up a Windows OS and
&gt; run it in a virtual PC, or else put a windows
&gt; partition on my mere 4GB of over-used disk, or else
&gt; get an external disk (on PC card) to run windows
&gt; as dual boot - or just wipe linux and start again
&gt; with windows 98, which means that I will not be able
&gt; to do all the linux things -- software development,
&gt; X windows, traffic analysis etc. etc.
&gt;

Stop your (excuse the french, but I am really pissed) fucking whinging. It's
comments like that are typical of people who have used Windows forever and
haven't used anything else. I was under the impression that you knew what you
were talking about.

&gt;
&gt; Word Perfect didn't get past the first stage.
&gt; It can't even display its icons correctly
&gt; on either my Toshiba laptop or on my
&gt; nice modern K6-2/400 with modern video card
&gt; and monitor. The incomprehensible results
&gt; on screen make WP useless to me.
&gt;

To you maybe, but it works quite well for the rest of the world.

&gt;
&gt; So there you have it.
&gt; In a serious work environment, where people
&gt; are paying me money to write reports, they
&gt; cannot read my documents correctly, and I have
&gt; to effectively abandon linux.
&gt;
&gt; This is what I feared woud be the case.
&gt;
&gt; It's pointless saying that my OS is the best
&gt; and windows is rubbish when youare told that you
&gt; will be paid lots of money if and _only_ if
&gt; you produce outputs that they can read in
&gt; a "standard" format -- i.e. windows, as far as they're
&gt; concerned.
&gt;
&gt; This is why I continue to say:
&gt; "linux needs another 2 years to make it on the client PS",
&gt; which I think is not a controversial view.
&gt;
&gt; Well, now I'm going to buy an external disk and
&gt; PC card to load windows onto.
&gt; This is a real pain!!!
&gt;

If you keep this up, you will probably go blind (or at least end up with blisters).

I do love Linux, but I am not pissed because you 'bagged my system'. I am really

pissed that you would bitch and moan publically because you can't get a couple of Office Suites working. If this means that you will

be running Windows Full Time now, I personally will not miss you.

Matt
