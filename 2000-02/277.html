Success With Adelaide Bank!
Those who tested it for me that couldn't get it working, could you add:
inetbnkp.adelaidebank.com.au:4646
To the exclusions settings of Netscape & retry.

Here is the email I've just sent to Adelaide Bank:
*****************************************************
For the last 2 months I have been unable to access your, (excellent),
Internet banking service due to bad advice provided by Michael Bell:
The error was:
Applet abls42 class ssa42 got a security violation: method verification
error
session code FIY2VH
Here is Michael's reply to the above error:
----------------------
Dear Daryl

Thank you for your enquiry.
We have comprehensively tested Windows 95/98 and NT with a choice of
Netscape 4.* and Internet Explorer 4.* and greater. We offer our support
for customers who comply with these system requirements. Other
combinations of operating systems and browsers may not experience any
difficulties however they have not been extensively tested.

I believe your problem is with OS2 Warp. Most likely Java JIT compiler
and VM within Browser.

Our troubleshooting section may assist you (clear temp files,etc),
however not a supported OS. Please try the JAVA test under Sys
Requirements. If this is failing then Online Banking definitely won't
work.

Yours faithfully,

Michael Bell

1)
My ISP actually solved this problem, no thanks to Adelaide Bank. Refer
to:
<A HREF="http://www.clove.net.au/support/bank_adel.html">http://www.clove.net.au/support/bank_adel.html</A>
Perhaps you could employ James at Clovelly Internet to redo your
troubleshooting pages?
Note that you "sort-of" have this information under:
Why am I having problems accessing Online Banking from work?
But even here you have less than ideal information.
You would be better off only specifying exclusions of:
inetbnkp.adelaidebank.com.au:4646
As that allows ISP proxies to proxy the other ports, reducing loading on
your Web servers.
The (corrected) information also needs to be under:
Applet Download Errors
2)
It is totally unacceptable that you only essentially support Mac &
Windows. I can't believe Netscape is not supported on Mac!
Netscape is available for over 17 operating systems.
Whilst I can appreciate this may be a large target market, the above
mentality is divisive, disciminatory & anti-competitive.
If you persist with this sort of mentality I will be lodging a formal
complaint with the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman.
3)
Your System Requirements are simply wrong
Using Netscape 4.61, OS/2 Warp 4, FixPak 12 & Java 1.1.8, it says only
Java is working which is simply wrong.
The above combination is *certified* by IBM to y2k compliant & secondly
IBM's OS/2 Java is *certified* Pure Java, so Michael's suggestion that
there is a problem with the JIT compilier is laughable.
4)
I have emailed Michael offering testing on differing distributions of
Linux & OS/2.
Unfortunately I never received a response to this.
I mentioned to Michael in my email that it would be better to test on
well-written systems like Linux & OS/2 & then find-out why it doesn't
work on Windows!
Testing only on Windows is technically sloppy for the above reason.

That all said & done, the actual Internet Banking Site is excellent,
well-done on the side of Sandstone Technology.
I simply cannot fault it:- keep up the good work!
