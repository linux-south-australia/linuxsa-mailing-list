No offence but ...
a) it is SPAM ... standard format.
b) if you chose to leave the list thats your choice
c) I QUOTE YOU DIRECT FROM ALLADVANTAGES ANTI-SPAM PAGE!!!
(IN CASE YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THE URL: IT'S 
<A HREF="http://www.alladvantage.com/antispam.asp?refid">http://www.alladvantage.com/antispam.asp?refid</A>=)

What is spam?In simple terms spam (a.k.a. unsolicited commercial e-mail,
unsolicited bulk e-mail, mass e-mail,junk e-mail) is a message that
advertises goods or services that you send to someone without their
prior consent or in the absence of a previous relationship. In one
respect is the electronic equivalent
of the junk mail you receive in your postal mailbox every day. But
because of the economics of
Internet e-mail, it is much worse. To learn why, see Why is spam bad?
below. 

In more advanced terms there are three main types of spam: Usenet,
message board, and e-mail.
Usenet and message board spam are messages sent or posted which are
unrelated to the topic of
discussion of the particular news group or message board. E-mail spam is
any electronic mail
message that is addressed to a recipient with whom the initiator does
not have an existing business
or personal relationship or is not sent at the request of, or with the
express consent of, the recipient. 

SO, IMHO YOU SPAMMED ME/US/THE LIST.

&gt; Hmmm love SPiced hAM.
&gt; Well I dont consider the information I sent to be spam but then again what
&gt; exactly spam is, is a matter of each persons perception.  I considered that
&gt; I was supplying some useful information to a group of computer users and
&gt; that information may happen to offset some internet users ISP costs?  I
&gt; agree that alladvantage is not linux compatible and that is a pity but I
&gt; also know that a lot of linux users are operating dual bootable machines and
&gt; still running Windows and Mac O/S's!  For future reference the alladvantage
&gt; group is working on a linux compatible version at the moment.
&gt; 
&gt; I will gracefully bow out of this mailing list.  I have enjoyed my time on
&gt; the list and wish everyone all the best.
