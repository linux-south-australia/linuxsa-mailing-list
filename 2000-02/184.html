Hi,

&gt; I'm assuming xisp is trying to create the file .ppprc because I can't
&gt; find it anywhere on my system. As far as I know the permissions are ok
&gt; for /home/Robyn.
&gt; &gt; &gt;               /usr/sbin/pppd: Can't open options
&gt; &gt; &gt;               file /home/Robyn/.ppprc: Operation not permitted.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;       I can su to root and run xisp from there and it works fine.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Check the permissions on /home/Robyn/.ppprc Is it owned by you ? Could you
&gt; &gt; have sued to root at some stage, and have it write that file ?

I caurrently don't use xisp so I'm guessing from similar experiences here.

Program works when root, program doesn't work as user.

options.
1) When su-ed to root, it readds roots ~root/.ppprc file, but
~Robyn/.ppprc does not exist, but needs to be created.
2) When su-ed to root, xisp has permissions to write a file or directory
that it doesn when you are you. Hence check permissions on files. Maybe
also check /tmp and sub dirs. Perhaps create a new account, and see if
that person works. Check the man pages for requirements on what files.
3) xisp's permissions have been changed some how (you didn't do a chmod -r,
anywhere in your file structure?). It may have gone from being a SUID/SGID
program to not. Maybe try a reinstall from the original source (rpm, or
source distribution), it may restore file permissions.

hope this helps.

cya
