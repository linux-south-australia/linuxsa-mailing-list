Hi,

Before you send me hate mail please read on.  I have been using this system
while doing nothing else but surf the net and I have received my first
cheque!  This can cut your internet bill drastically or even earn you a
passive income! Okay - you do have to put up with a little advertising in a
bar on your screen but I just set it running when I am leaving my machine
connected the the net while I do something else.

It's the Internet company I joined that pays its members to surf the Web.
Last month's top members earned several thousands of dollars each!

It's free to join and your privacy is completely protected. Check out these
impressive facts:

They've paid over $10 million to members in the US, UK and Canada in the
last three months alone;
Now they're paying members in France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and
the US territories, too -- more countries coming soon;
Later this month all members will be able to purchase anti-virus software at
a significant discount through their AllAdvantage accounts;
Soon they're releasing Viewbars to Mac users, making AllAdvantage one of the
first Viewbar companies to do so;
They've developed and soon will release an upgraded version of the Viewbar
software that's equipped with instant search capability, convenient
quicklinks to the Web's most popular sites, and of course, pays you to surf!
It takes only minutes to join, download the free AllAdvantage.com Viewbar
software, and start surfing the Web with the Viewbar on your screen. You can
earn even more when you tell your friends about it. Really! It's all about
becoming part of a community that finally recognizes our value as consumers.

Join now (there's no survey to fill out) at
<A HREF="http://www.alladvantage.com/home.asp?refid">http://www.alladvantage.com/home.asp?refid</A>=KBJ-956 and please use my
membership ID (KBJ-956) when asked if you were referred by someone.

Thanks a lot and happy surfing!
