&gt; Hi.                                                              I am having
&gt; problems with trying to send mail out from my
&gt; system. I don't think it is my MUA because I have tried
&gt; sending mail from both pine and mutt, and get the following
&gt; errors:
&gt; The original message was received at Fri, 28 Jan 2000
&gt; 01:51:36 1030 from <A HREF="mailto:aoc@localhost">aoc@localhost</A>                                 ----- The 




hang on, if your sending out from your system, why is your system
"receiving" the message?

following
&gt; addresses had permanent fatal errors -----     <A HREF="mailto:remianke@worldonline.nl">remianke@worldonline.nl</A>
&gt;  ----- Transcript of session follows -----                       550 <A HREF="mailto:remianke@worldonline.nl...">remianke@worldonline.nl...</A>
&gt; Host unknown (Name server: &lt;mail.chariot.net.au: host not found)


here, you have "&lt;mail.chariot.net.au", whats that "&lt;" doing there? 
 .
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; Reporting-MTA: dns; localhost.localdomain
&gt; Action: failed Status: 5.1.2
&gt; Remote-MTA: DNS; &lt;mail.chariot.net.au

there's that "&lt;" again. Check for typos in your orig message, if its not
a typo, then you may have an error in you sendmail.cf file. If this is
true (and you haven;t made too many changes directly to this file) you
can recreate the sendmail.cf file by using the m4 macro file sendmail.mc
by doing 

m4 sendmail.mc &gt; sendmail.cf


&gt; Last-Attempt-Date: Fri, 28 Jan 2000 01:51:37 +1030
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; After reading the sendmail man pages, I added the following lines into my /etc/sendmail.cf
&gt; file. This didn't seem to help.
&gt; 
&gt; # "Smart" relay host (may be null)
&gt; DS&lt;mail.chariot.net.au&gt;
&gt; .

correct me if I'm wrong, but I dont reckon you should be relaying
anything. You are simply sending mail right?

Relaying is where your box is "passing the (message) baton" to another
server. 

&gt; #who I masquerade as (null for no masquerading) (see also $=M)
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:DMandroc@box.net.au">DMandroc@box.net.au</A>

masquerading is where you are hosting more that one mail domain. Again,
not what your trying to do methinks.


I would do as Mat suggested and check your DNS setup. like this

$&gt; nslookup mail.chariot.net.au
