'ello!

My Net connection occasionally grinds to a halt, usually after
downloading a large amount of emails, or for no reason.  Sometimes I
recieve an error message 'connection reset by peer' after which no data
is received and I have to dial in again..

It is bloody annoying.  I am with Primus, which has a the typical 'no,
we don't Linux here' attitude, so they are next to useless as far as
help goes..

Also, someone wrote to me a while back regarding getting the Epson
Stylus 440 set up under Linux.  I can't find the original email, and as
I recall, the printer was listed as supported but I could not figure out
how to get it working.

Lastly, I have installed the SB Live RPM from Dells website, but now I
can't play MP3s and some other things seem a bit strange..

Can I just install the driver from Creative over the top?

Thanks!

Ian
