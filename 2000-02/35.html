The first question you should ask yourself is "What are you trying to do? 
(why do you want either?)"
Is it because you have a need to share password information over a number 
of machines?
Is it because you want to store information which is sharable over a number 
of machines?
Is it because you can?

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;     I have been considering setting up NIS for my home
&gt;network (I also enjoy banging my head against walls). I was
&gt;talking about this to someone the other day and they
&gt;suggested that LDAP might be a better way to go. I have had
&gt;a look at both the HOWTOs for NIS and LDAP and they "seem"
&gt;straight forward enough to set up so basically I am left
&gt;with the decision of which one. O.K. I suppose that my
&gt;question now becomes "Which One?". Which is easier to set up
&gt;and maintain? Which is more secure? Why is one better than
&gt;the other? What other pros and cons are there to worry about
&gt;that I may not have thought of?
&gt;
&gt;     O.K. Gurus (and others) get to it. I look forward to a
&gt;healthy discussion.
&gt;
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
