Matthew,
Take one line, which is a whitespace separated line, change 'defaults'
to the following...

/dev/hdb1   /mnt/cdrive  vfat  noauto,user,exec,sync  0 0
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Where..
noauto - file system will not be automatically mounted
user - a user mount mount the file system
exec - programs may be run from this file sys
sync - flush the disk buffers 
       (this means a performace hit, but minimises chance of corrupt data)  
Have a look at 'man fstab' and particularly 'man mount' for more
options.. 

Does anyone know the specifics on how the 'flush' works on vfat?
Is it similar to ext2 ('cause I don't really know)?  
Also, the owner of the files is probably set to the user who opens the
vfat file system... anyone know offhand?

&gt; I'm trying to mount my 2 Win98 partitions using  fstab. Here's the file
&gt; 
&gt; /dev/hdb5                 /                               ext2
&gt; defaults                    1 1
&gt; /dev/cdrom              /mnt/cdrom              iso9660
&gt; noauto,owner,ro    0 0
&gt; /dev/hdb7                swap                        swap
&gt; defaults                  0 0
&gt; /dev/fd0                   /mnt/floppy              ext2
&gt; noauto,owner           0 0
&gt; /dev/hdb1                /mnt/cdrive              vfat
&gt; defaults                     0 0
&gt; /dev/hdb6                /mnt/ddrive              vfat
&gt; defaults                     1 2
&gt; none                        /proc                         proc
&gt; defaults                    0 0
&gt; none                       /dev/pts                    devpts
&gt; gid=5,mode=620     0 0
&gt; 
&gt; Now both partitions mount automatically fine. As root I can save, open &
&gt; Delete fine.
&gt; But I've been told I shouldn't work In root unless absolutely necessary
&gt; I've also been told I shouldn't leave my Win98 boot partition mounted
&gt; all the time. In fear of recursive deletes or something. My ddrive
&gt; doesn't matter so much as its mostly just non essential data (but it
&gt; does have a spare 10 gig on it so i would like to be able to utilize it
&gt; )
&gt; My problem is this.
&gt; As my normal working log on I can't  unmount or mount these drives and i
&gt; can only open files on them . I cant save or delete files.
&gt; I would like to be able to do this. Is there something I need to do to
&gt; the priv's of my user logon(?) or can I set it  up in fstab.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks In Advance .
&gt; Matt :-)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW : the SAIA Seminar must be at 2:30 (is that what they were trying to
&gt; say?)
