&gt;     I have been considering setting up NIS for my home

&gt; suggested that LDAP might be a better way to go. I have had
&gt; a look at both the HOWTOs for NIS and LDAP and they "seem"
&gt; straight forward enough to set up so basically I am left
&gt; with the decision of which one. O.K. I suppose that my
&gt; question now becomes "Which One?". Which is easier to set up
&gt; and maintain? Which is more secure? Why is one better than
&gt; the other? What other pros and cons are there to worry about
&gt; that I may not have thought of?

LDAP is a directory service.  To use that directory service
you need to be authenticated, and LDAP provides a mechanism
for doing this.  So you authenticate a user by seeing if
you can access one of their private LDAP entries by using the
password they supplied you.

Problem, you need a password to do this.  No application in its
right mind sends plain text passwords across the net.

So its important to look for an LDAP server that supports a wide
range of password authentication types: MD4 (for NT), MD5-digest
(for WWW), CRAM-MD5 (for IMAP), Kerberos and so on.  OpenLDAP
is not yet that server, but it probably will be by the end of the
year.

LDAP also sucks with notebooks.  You need to run a local
LDAP server and replicate the tree containing the user
attributes of the users that will use that machine.
But the important thing is that you can: Kerberos just
doesn't work with notebooks at all.

NIS+ is solid, secure and here now.  But LDAP will replace it
in the longer term.  NIS+ makes all sorts of assumptions
about the operating system that effectively tie it to UNIX.


To see where we are headed, a future corporate desktop machine
will look like this:

Boot

 - gets IP address using DHCP.

 - DHCP response contains the IP address of a Service Location
   Protocol Server.

 - desktop securely updates DNS to reflect the machine's new
   IP address.

Login

 - location of root LDAP server requested from SLP.

 - authenticates user against LDAP.  An LDAP ACL controls the machines,
   times, etc that they can log in.

 - if LDAP says 'yes' but there is no home directory, then one is
   created and the initial files populated from looking up LDAP.
   (or, alternatively, you could use a networked drive).

 - User's preferred settings for "lp" and so on are retrived
   from LDAP, verified against SLP, and set.

Applications

 - when you start an e-mail client, it looks up the address of the
   IMAP server in SLP, and connects you to it.  Your IMAP password is
   chceked against LDAP.

 - you compose a message.  Your private key is fetched from LDAP to
   sign the message.  Your recipient will check the message's veracty
   by following the tree of LDAP servers, eventually asking your
   LDAP server for your public key.

As you can see, LDAP plays a major role in the future IETF corporate
IP networking model.
