Dear Tech Support and Primus,

It appears that I have resolved the problem that Swann Communications
and Primus could not.  For future reference, I sent a 'echo "ATZ" &gt;
/dev/modem" at the command prompt.  My messages log file was leaving a
by-the-minute error regarding a protocol not recognised.  Many have
informed me that they have had this exact problem with Swann modems and
connections to Primus.

The ATZ command apparantly resets the modem.  A shot in the dark for a
person like myself with almost no technical knowledge, but desperately
frustrated.

I thought I should let you know so that Swann doesn't have to inform
consumers after the purchase that the Swannsmart 56k modem (an otherwise
excellent piece of hardware) is not intended for Linux.  And Primus can
keep this incredibly simple solution in their database so Linux users
will not need to switch ISPs.  I was already making inquiries to change
modem and ISP on Linux news and user groups.

This problem has been bothering me for a month or so, and has cost me
quit a bit in local call reconnection fees.  I suppose simple solutions
are often the best!

I wonder why no-one from Swann Communiciations or Primus tell me this.

Ian
