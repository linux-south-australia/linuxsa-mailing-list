Hey.

I'm a new Linux user (since last weekend, Redhat 6.1).

Ok I need some help with something.
I've downloaded linux drivers for my Aureal Vortex sound card (Xitel Storm 
Platinum) from
linux.aureal.com/ .

that was ok, copied them from Windows over to Linux in the root directory.
To install I need to type "make install" which is the problem as I have no 
"make" in /bin.
No big deal I did an upgrade and installed "make" but it's located under 
/usr/bin so in terminal when I type "make install" it still doesn't work. 
So I copied "make" from /usr/bin to /bin but I think I need to do something 
to make it work, this is where I need help as I have no idea what I need to 
type in terminal, or a config file somewhere to get the "make" command to 
work. Someone in deja news (archives) said something about echo $path but I 
dunno they were rather brief and undetailed about the procedure.

If someone could help me out that would be great. Either run me through 
what I need to do or point me toward the relevant Howto to read.

thanks.

Craig..
