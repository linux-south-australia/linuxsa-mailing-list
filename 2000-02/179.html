Okay, I dont know if this is nagging people, but its sure intriguing me ...
!

Box Specs:
- The hard disk is a Samsung 6.5 Gb SV0682D
- There are NO other devices in the box apart from 1 floppy disk drive
- The motherboard is a 02/06/96-i430FX-2A59CF3CC-00 manufactured by Full-Yes
industries at www.fyi.com.tw (which is always down due to DNS
non-resolution)
- box specs are :
    - PCI Cirrus Logic VGA card
    - PCI Ethernet card (NE2000 compat)
    - EISA SB16 card
    - 24 mb RAM
    - 120mhz CPU

Situation:
- hard disk, motherboard and cable are all working since i can write to it
with a dos boot disk (its a primary master and the jumpers are set to
reflect this)
- BIOS detects the hard disk perfectly
- tried partitioning
    - 1 huge partition
    - 1 small partition below 1024 boundary
    - FAT32/16
    - all partitions marked as active
- each time ive made a new partition and set it active, i have done either
    &gt; format c: /s
    &gt; sys a:\ c:
  As far as i am aware, the first is equivalent to the second, minus the
format procedure.
- I went to www.ping.be/bios and got the files required for flashing BIOS
and FLASHED IT!!!
  Unfortunately, I had the latest version it seems (4.50PG), and made no
difference.
    If the damn manufacturers would get their sites up, I could contact them
and download a possibly later version of the BIOS? Or do version numbers
prettey much stop after this version? (since my other box is a 466 and only
has 4.51b or something)

The only other theory is something low-level software/MBR ish ... since it
seems that (*this is just my clairvoyance speaking now*) control is passed
to the HD but it chooses not to respond???!

Im ready to give up.  lol there goes my dedicated linux box :(

&gt; Hmmmm.....
&gt;
&gt; I imagine you have checked that the actual partition is actually marked as
&gt; "bootable" in MS-DOS's fdisk???
&gt; In the status column in the drive info should be the letter "A" if it is
set
&gt; as bootable (and blank if its not).
&gt; If its not set... this is your problem.
&gt;
&gt; If it is set... it sounds like everything should be running ok :(
&gt;
&gt; MWP
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Okay, sorry ... heres more information:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is the only disk on the primary ide channel.
&gt; &gt; There only other drives in it is a floppy (nope no cdrom - network
&gt; install).
&gt; &gt; I gather that everything is properly configured (jumper and all) since:
&gt; &gt; - BIOS detects perfectly
&gt; &gt; - I can read/write to the hard disk
&gt; &gt; And even if you can do those things, I have made sure the jumper is set
to
&gt; &gt; Primary Master.  Whatsmore, i have tried booting the drive on all jumper
&gt; &gt; settings.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have set the BIOS to boot A,C sequence (and yes ive tried the otherway
&gt; &gt; round too),
&gt; &gt; the system summary box comes up and then it just sits there with the
&gt; cursor
&gt; &gt; blinking where
&gt; &gt; 'LILO:' or 'Starting Windows 98 ...' would appear.  It gives no errors,
no
&gt; &gt; beeps, nothing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The confusing part is of course that you would think that if it is
&gt; detected
&gt; &gt; perfectly (which it is),
&gt; &gt; and you can read/write perfectly in dos, then the BIOS would boot it
after
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; format c: /s (or
&gt; &gt; sys a:\ c:) ... which i have tried as FAT16 and FAT32 (just incase).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have also tried setting the entire hard disk up as one partition (as
&gt; prev
&gt; &gt; suggested in another
&gt; &gt; email).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Help!  I am becoming more and more sure its the BIOS every day!
&gt; &gt; So when were FlashROMs being used in motherboards?  Before '96 i hope ?
:)

&gt; &gt; &gt; Andrew,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; More information is needed.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; What does happen?  Does the BIOS tell you that it is trying to boot
&gt; &gt; &gt; from that drive?  I gather you are not sure whether the drive is
&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly configured as a master.  Is there any other device on that
&gt; &gt; &gt; IDE bus?  Are you sure it's on the first IDE bus?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
