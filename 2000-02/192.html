Hey All,

I'll have to appologise for this message being a bit... delayed... as they
case is. I unsubscribed from the LinuxSA list for a while (about a month...)
and I've just resubscribed. Couldn't live without you'll :)

Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone has a copy, and can send me a copy, of Nick
Morrison's script he talks about in the following message?

Dazz

&gt; Hello.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; At 04:54  31/12/1999 +1030, you wrote:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have a small network connected to the Internet via a Linux box
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with IP Masquerading.  I am looking for a good Windows-based client
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that will allow the connection to come up when I need it.
&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm
&gt;
&gt; &gt; A friend of mine wrote a little cgi script that was accessible
&gt; &gt; through any web browser - you need to have apache configured and able to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; reached regardless of whether you're connected to the 'net or not, but
it
&gt; &gt; works a charm.
&gt;
&gt; Ie - an intranet situation is perfect.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; One thing that you do have to be careful of in it's current form is that
&gt; &gt; you don't "enable" the interface twice or you won't be able to
&gt; &gt; disconnect....
&gt;
&gt; If you "connect" twice, you have to "disconnect" twice.  Fix that if you
&gt; want.
&gt; Otherwise just be careful *grin*.  The problem is that the program doesn't
&gt; check to see if the link is already up
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Not a major drama though, but Nick, if you're listening (reading), could
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; something worthwhile looking into *grin* - perhaps I should do it myself
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; well...
&gt;
&gt; It was written very quickly and for a simple and specific purpose.  It's
&gt; easily configurable and works.  If you would like to try it, please feel
&gt; free!
&gt; Can I get you to put it on a server Kirsty?  How about
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.fully.cx/files/linkman-x.x.x.tar.gz">http://www.fully.cx/files/linkman-x.x.x.tar.gz</A> or something ;)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll ask my friend Nick if he minds me making it publicly available and
&gt; get
&gt; &gt; back to you...
&gt;
&gt; Go nuts :)  Just keep my name in it somewhere ;)
&gt;
&gt; Happy New Year everyone!!  I'll stay out of the millenium discussion for
&gt; now..  *grin*
&gt;
&gt; Bye!
&gt;
&gt; Nick.
