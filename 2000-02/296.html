&gt; &gt;From memory (its been a couple of months since I've installed SuSE), there
&gt; is a screen at around the partitioning stage of the install where you format
&gt; the drives. I wiped out my Windows 98 partition once because I selected
&gt; normal by mistake for the windows partition. Took me a while to work out why
&gt; there was still a FAT32 partition, but it was blank.
&gt;

I know the screen you're talking about. it comes up, but only asks about the
Linux partitions. I managed to get it not to kill the Slowaris Partition
because it sees it as a Linux swap partition.

&gt;
&gt; When it asks which partitions you want to format, make sure you choose no to
&gt; the ones you want to keep.

It worked for Slowaris

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If it is killing the partitions at the fdisk stage, try doing a manual fdisk
&gt; (like I said, its been a while since I installed SuSE, and I've installed
&gt; RedHat in the meantime....)
&gt;

There's another type of fdisk? I even tried creating the partitions before
booting off the CD. to no avail.

&gt;

&gt;
&gt; PS. Please don't send HTML email to the mailing list... A lot of the people
&gt; on the list can't read it easily, so you're less likely to get a reply if
&gt; your emails are in HTML.

Yeah, soorry aboot that, I must have accidentally clicked the box.....

Thanks,

Matt
