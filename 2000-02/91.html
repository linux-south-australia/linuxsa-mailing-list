Hi,

&gt; Does anyone have any experience installing a distribution on a machine
&gt; that has been booted over a network?

No, tho I use one, and so have a little experience fiddling with the
config.

&gt; Now that some modern motherboards with 10/100BaseT/TX onbaord also
&gt; have a netboot option in BIOS, the application that I have in mind is
&gt; where a server with the latest distribution has been installed.. 
&gt; a client netboots (getting all its configuration from the server),
&gt; does a hardware scan, and then installs/reinstalls/upgrades a
&gt; distribution (minimal or otherwise) from the network to the local harddrive.

I don't necessarily see that you need to net-boot for this. You can
achieve this with scripts and/or cron jobs.

&gt; The uses for this range from the PC shop that want a really easy way
&gt; to install linux (or another OS);

That's an excelent idea,I don't know if a Redhat or other install can be
automated, but since the net boot happens by tftp, it shouldn't be too
dificult to create a boot image which starts an install. The Diskless
workstation HOWTO should tell you what you need to know here.

 network devices eg.. thin(ish)
&gt; clients; high reliability server farms; and (my favourite) nodes in
&gt; beowulf cluster.  [Imagine being able to get an 'empty' machine, plug
&gt; it into the network, and have a it configure and install itself.]
&gt; Also.. benchmarking labs might find this useful.

And simple to set up I would imagine.

&gt; The following packages have proved useful so far:
&gt; Netboot
&gt; Etherboot
&gt; .. and I can get Linux booted over network with an NFS mounted root
&gt; partition.
&gt; 
&gt; The two things to try next are:
&gt; 1. Using a minimal kernel distribution for the diskless clients.
&gt;    (Ideally, only a differnet config file should be needed for each
&gt;    client)
&gt; 2. (mentioned above) Playing with the local harddrive.. installing,
&gt;    configuring, creating filesystems.

cya
