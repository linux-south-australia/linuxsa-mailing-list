David,
	there are versions of Pick (now called D3) that run on Linux and Unix, but 
R91 is not one of them - it was its own 'native' OS. If you have an R91 
box, and plug a Laser printer onto it, you can control it from a program by 
issuing any escape sequences you want with print statements. Pick/D3/R91 
does not have device specific drivers, as such - it's up to you to do the 
hard work (which actually makes life a whole lot easier).
	For those of you that have not heard of Pick, it is quite a powerful 
database/OS/recall language/programming language thats been around since 
the late 60's. It used to be it's own OS, but now sits on Linux (RedHat), 
Unix and NT.

regards,



Brett Monten

&gt; Pick is nothing like Unix.  Never heard of Pick R91.

OK thanks for the (somewhat terse) coments...
I'm just going by what my customer told me ( "It's kinda like Unix")
I'd never even heard of pick up until yesterday...
The company that sold them the software is no longer in business from
what I've been told...
Any one else?
