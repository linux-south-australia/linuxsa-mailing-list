&gt; Hi everyone, First - Thanks for the help with fstab and permissions. I
&gt; can read, write & exec wherever I want now :-) Second - Re: Andrew &
&gt; the BIOS update Question. The first thing I would try if you don't
&gt; have a good diagnostic programme is put the HDD in another PC(If you
&gt; have one available) just to rule out the HDD as being faulty but
&gt; unfortunately It Sounds a bit like the bios to me. Third - I work for
&gt; a small computer retail/repair company that is also an ISP. All my
&gt; chat about Linux recently has sparked interest in our system
&gt; administrator. He was asking me if there was a Web Based front end for
&gt; our mail server that was available on Linux. So out users can go to a
&gt; web page to check their e-mail. Our mail server is Sendmail  running
&gt; on NT (which he doesn't want to change). We have tried some other
&gt; commercially available packages that do the job but unfortunately the
&gt; pricing has been restrictive. Has anyone heard of or currently using a
&gt; programme that does this. Any suggestions would be greatly
&gt; appreciated. Regards Matt.

Try IMP at <A HREF="http://www.horde.org/">http://www.horde.org/</A> (I think). If it isn't there, you'll be
able to find it with a search engine (maybe freshmeat too).

Matt
