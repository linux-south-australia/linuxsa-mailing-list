Warning! Warning!

Anybody thinking of relying on sshd for remote login
to their home site while overseas in s'Gravenhage
should think again.
Luckily I set up _two_ computers as sshd servers.
Because one of them failed:

====================================================

Feb 12 09:54:42 dog pam_rhosts_auth[3667]: allowed to <A HREF="mailto:akenning@emu.topology.org">akenning@emu.topology.org</A> as akenning
====================================================

The last line is where I sneeked in to the machine
sideways from the other sshd-enabled machine.

It looks like after about 100 successful sshd logins
(order of magnitude only), sshd didn't close all those
pty handles and just reached the system limit.
Unfortunately it just doesn't do anything
that might be called fail-safe.

Part of the problem is that fact that I was in a company
that had N-ISDN link-up to the net - where the
connection was closed whenever the link was idle.
As a result, every 10 minutes or so, my sshd connection
was dropped at my end, but maybe not at the
server end.

When I recognized the problem, I set up a
ping process to keep the link alive (and cost my
emplooyer more in ISDN connection costs), so 
that ssh links didn't fail anymore.

But finally I reached the limit anyway.

to be fail-safe, maybe you need to run
_two_ ssh daemons on different ports independently.

The above log, by the way shows two failed ssh
logins, not one.

Anyway, be warned !!! Or be prawned!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I'm going to miss the linux meeting by 12 hours.
did someone say there's a mystery guest.
I wonder if it's someone famous....
Every time I just miss a meeting, someone famous
shows up!
