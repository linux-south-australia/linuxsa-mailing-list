&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I have been considering setting up NIS for my home
&gt; network (I also enjoy banging my head against walls). I was
&gt; talking about this to someone the other day and they
&gt; suggested that LDAP might be a better way to go. I have had
&gt; a look at both the HOWTOs for NIS and LDAP and they "seem"
&gt; straight forward enough to set up so basically I am left
&gt; with the decision of which one. O.K. I suppose that my
&gt; question now becomes "Which One?". Which is easier to set up
&gt; and maintain? Which is more secure? Why is one better than
&gt; the other? What other pros and cons are there to worry about
&gt; that I may not have thought of?
&gt;
&gt;     O.K. Gurus (and others) get to it. I look forward to a
&gt; healthy discussion.
&gt;

I would personally go with LDAP. NIS is easy to configure, it is also
compatible with a number of flavours of commercial Unix. OpenLDAP
(<A HREF="http://www.openldap.org/">http://www.openldap.org/</A>) is RFC compliant, which means that it is going to
be fairly portable between Novell's Directory Services, Netscape's Directory
services and even Microsoft's ACtive Directory. Obviously these other vendors
have a tendency to "extend" the functionality of the standards, so you won't
get complete compatability.

NIS and NIS+ have had a fair amount of security problems in the past, where
LDAP doesn't appear to have the same. LDAP supports Access Control Lists, so
you can give different users different permissions.

As well as using LDAP for the same stuff you can with NIS, software such as
Samba [bows down to the mighty Samba Team. "For thou hast done some pretty
cool stuff and things"] support LDAP. Netscape and IE as of versions 4 also
support LDAP address books.

A lot of bigger companies are starting to pay attention to LDAP (IBM and
Netscape are very big on it), so we will start to see it used more and more.

My opinions.

Matt
