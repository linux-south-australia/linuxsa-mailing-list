Okay, sorry ... heres more information:

This is the only disk on the primary ide channel.
There only other drives in it is a floppy (nope no cdrom - network install).
I gather that everything is properly configured (jumper and all) since:
- BIOS detects perfectly
- I can read/write to the hard disk
And even if you can do those things, I have made sure the jumper is set to
Primary Master.  Whatsmore, i have tried booting the drive on all jumper
settings.

I have set the BIOS to boot A,C sequence (and yes ive tried the otherway
round too),
the system summary box comes up and then it just sits there with the cursor
blinking where
'LILO:' or 'Starting Windows 98 ...' would appear.  It gives no errors, no
beeps, nothing.

The confusing part is of course that you would think that if it is detected
perfectly (which it is),
and you can read/write perfectly in dos, then the BIOS would boot it after a
format c: /s (or
sys a:\ c:) ... which i have tried as FAT16 and FAT32 (just incase).

I have also tried setting the entire hard disk up as one partition (as prev
suggested in another
email).

Help!  I am becoming more and more sure its the BIOS every day!
So when were FlashROMs being used in motherboards?  Before '96 i hope ? :)

&gt; Andrew,
&gt;
&gt; More information is needed.
&gt;
&gt; What does happen?  Does the BIOS tell you that it is trying to boot
&gt; from that drive?  I gather you are not sure whether the drive is
&gt; correctly configured as a master.  Is there any other device on that
&gt; IDE bus?  Are you sure it's on the first IDE bus?
&gt;
