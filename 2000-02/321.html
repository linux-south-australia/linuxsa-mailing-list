&gt; You're right in that there is a lot of work to do on the distro still, and
&gt; some of the choices the install makes may not be the best for all

--------------snip-------------------------
Adam, I suppose my overall beef is that IF the "full version" is
basically the same as the "demo" then it is seriously "lacking" in quite
a few areas and really isnt ready for full distribution and should
therefore be sent out as a beta and not a $65 dollar distro ; I equate
that philosophy to charging $500 or more for an Operating System with
63,000 bugs!!. 
I also have a real problem with any linux that doesnt handle old
hardware - it was (and still is IMHO) one of the many attractions of
linux... I cannot see windoze users trashing their 95 or 98 partitions
just because Corel says that there linux is wonderful and is will
replace their current desktop... therefore I would guess that quite a
few ppl would opt for installing it on the old 486sx33 or 486dx40 thats
been in the back shed since they got their new pentium, to try it out
first!! Corel is not going to win any new customers when their Linux
wont install or crashes/locks up on old hardware or refuses to detect
sbpcd's and therefore cant install.
It is IMHO, very naive to think that everyone runs Pentiums with the
latest hardware etc etc. From a marketing point of view targetting
"older hardware" is a good thing to include in any distro.
Regarding not detecting network cards etc during the install...
obviously the less problems whilst installing the better, but Corel need
to include a gui and or some instructions to at least allow a user to
easily(relatively) install a network card if they have one, after Linux
has installed (again... creating one's own LAN is another attraction of
linux which Corel have "overlooked" imho).
Anyway, I am not just slagging off at Corel's effort or flaming anyone,
I just think Corel Linux's release as a "functioning" O/S is somewhat
premature! To release an O/S which cannot perform what are pretty much
standard accepted Linux functions, does not do the Linux cause any good.
Corel must be able to stand up in the marketplace & match up against
other linux distro's and in its present form it does not. 
Please accept my comments as they are intended, constructive criticisms.

Phil
