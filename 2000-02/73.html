Hi...

For starters thanks for pointing me to some drivers for my Storm VX

&gt;I've downloaded linux drivers for my Aureal Vortex sound card (Xitel Storm 
&gt;Platinum) from
&gt;linux.aureal.com/ .
&gt;
&gt;that was ok, copied them from Windows over to Linux in the root directory.
&gt;To install I need to type "make install" which is the problem as I have no 
&gt;"make" in /bin.
&gt;No big deal I did an upgrade and installed "make" but it's located under 
&gt;/usr/bin so in terminal when I type "make install" it still doesn't work. 

OK I just did a "which make" on my RH 6.1 and it came up with
/usr/bin/make

I have installed the drivers and all is working well, in fact I am
listening to a CD as we speak

As you are a newbie, I'll say this, you MUST be root to do a "make
install". I think you'll find that this will solve all your problems

If you have any more problems I'll be happy to help...

Regards

Damien
