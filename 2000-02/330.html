Sure they have a D Channel, half of the usefulness of ISDN comes from
the out-of-band signalling using it. What you're probably refering to is
the ability to send data between two ISDN nodes using the D-channel. Try
putting a D-channel analyser on your onramp .. if it's etsi compliant it
should still show activity when you dial or receive a call.

&gt; In answer to the original question, not only will Tharmarajah have to RTFM on
&gt; the modem/TA, but he'll most likely also need to call up the friendly ISP, and
&gt; either get the current number he dials opened up to 128k, or more likely, get a
&gt; _different_ number for the second B-channel to dial.

Again, one of the virtues of ISDN is that you should never need a 2nd
number for the 2nd channel. ISDN channels do not have numbers, they are
a resource allocated after a call has been negotiated on the D channel.
In most configurations 1 number will suffice to reach all channels
(you'll notice that Xpress installations only get one number for their 2
channels now). It is up to your terminal adapter equipment to decide if
it is going to answer a called-number or not. In a scenario involving a
half-decent ISP, they are going to have several hundred ISDN channels
that can answer to the same called number.
