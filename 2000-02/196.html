&gt; &gt; Hi There,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If any one has any experience with restoring/fixing partition tables
&gt; &gt; please read on. I am in a lot of trouble.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have had a very tough couple of days. On thursday night decided to
&gt; &gt; create a partition in some unused space on the hard disk on the server
&gt; &gt; at work. At 9pm on thursday I had noticed that I had completely screwed
&gt; &gt; it up. I had deleted the drives /usr /home. My biggest mistake was the
&gt; &gt; fact that I did not have a backup  of /usr and my most recant backup of
&gt; &gt; /home was 9 days old.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After working a 28 hour day I had restored normal services to the users
&gt; &gt; in the office (bar their 9 days worth of data). To get the users up and
&gt; &gt; running with out changing the contents of the screwed hard drive I
&gt; &gt; booted the server of my crappy 3.2 GB IDE hard drive (some what of a
&gt; &gt; downgrade form their 18gb ultra2 scsi HDD).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is essentially that I have incorrectly partitioned my hard
&gt; &gt; drive. To fix the problem I have tried a program called gpart (guess
&gt; &gt; partition).  Unfortunately it was not all that useful (the program is in
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; its early stages of development). I have also tried writing a file
&gt; &gt; boot.0800 (which had not changed since before my little accident) to my
&gt; &gt; mbr using dd but unfortunately no luck (when I did this the partition
&gt; &gt; table hardly changed.).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have 3 questions:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Can any one recommend any software for automatically rebuilding a
&gt; &gt; partition table?
&gt; &gt; 2. Is there any hope for the lost hard disk? Should I just salvage what
&gt; &gt; I have and start again?
&gt; &gt; 3. Are there any people in melbourne who would be able to help for a
&gt; &gt; fee?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; what dodes partition magic offer? Last I heard, it was aware of ext2
&gt; filesystems, and might even be worth buying the latest version.
&gt;
&gt; the question is, "Does P-magic rebuild partition tables?"

If there is a  slight problem with the Partiton table (even disk geometry
problems) pqmagic won't touch it. I still reckon you will only be able to do
it manually (Norton's Diskedit or the like).
