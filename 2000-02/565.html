&gt; Dear Tech Support and Primus,
&gt; 
&gt; It appears that I have resolved the problem that Swann Communications
&gt; and Primus could not.  For future reference, I sent a 'echo "ATZ" &gt;
&gt; /dev/modem" at the command prompt.  My messages log file was leaving a
&gt; by-the-minute error regarding a protocol not recognised.  Many have
&gt; informed me that they have had this exact problem with Swann modems and
&gt; connections to Primus.
&gt; 
&gt; The ATZ command apparantly resets the modem.  A shot in the dark for a
&gt; person like myself with almost no technical knowledge, but desperately
&gt; frustrated.

ATZ tells the modem to load its stored configuration.  For example if
you were to tell your modem to blind dial with 

ATX3

then you wrote that to the modem storage with

AT&W

next time you did an ATZ it'd load the configuration with the blind dial
option.  This means that ATZ wouldn't be a generic fix as people could
have different configurations on their modem.  I guess your saved
configuration has what ever option set that fixes your problem, but this
would be why its not a published generic fix.

&gt; I thought I should let you know so that Swann doesn't have to inform
&gt; consumers after the purchase that the Swannsmart 56k modem (an otherwise
&gt; excellent piece of hardware) is not intended for Linux.  And Primus can
&gt; keep this incredibly simple solution in their database so Linux users
&gt; will not need to switch ISPs.  I was already making inquiries to change
&gt; modem and ISP on Linux news and user groups.
&gt; 
&gt; This problem has been bothering me for a month or so, and has cost me
&gt; quit a bit in local call reconnection fees.  I suppose simple solutions
&gt; are often the best!
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder why no-one from Swann Communiciations or Primus tell me this.
