You really need to talk the to surveyor people

  <A HREF="http://www.advanced.org/surveyor/">http://www.advanced.org/surveyor/</A>

The stats most people keep have a 1S resolution,
which is far too granular to show MPEG's regular
bursts, or TCP's hunting behaviour.

MPEG does burst, by the way, as do most multimedia
protocols.  The use of compression makes this
inevitable.  If you have lossy compression then
you can calculate a ceiling to the burst.  To
reduce the burstiness, you can buffer.  But this
too has problems.

Internet traffic is self-similar and hosts will
synchronise their behaviour over time.

For example, a network with 100 x 1Mbps MPEG streams
should be able to fit into a tad more than 50Mbps (as
MPEG only sends every second frame in full).  However, router
buffer usage tends to become synchronised by congestion,
and thus the MPEG traffic also becomes synchronised,
and the peak 100Mbps is required during the full frame,
with some measly amount during the partial frame.

So it's important that you don't take a tcpdump
from a single host or traffic type and extrapolate
it.

Internet traffic also doesn't have a normal distribution.
This kisses off a lot of useful statistical tools.

There's no good book on the subject.  Vern Paxson's
PhD dissertation is about all there is that collects
the current state of play into one place.  A search
engine should find it easily enough.
