&gt;  &gt; Part of the problem is that fact that I was in a company
&gt;  &gt; that had N-ISDN link-up to the net - where the
&gt;  &gt; connection was closed whenever the link was idle.
&gt;  &gt; As a result, every 10 minutes or so, my sshd connection
&gt;  &gt; was dropped at my end, but maybe not at the
&gt;  &gt; server end.
&gt;
&gt; That isn't "part" of the problem, that's all of it.  When that company's
&gt; ISDN link drops, it doesn't tell your Linux box anything about it --
&gt; Your home system still thinks you're logged in, so of *course* it doesn't
&gt; free the PTY you were using.

There was a package that came with SuSE which will log you out after a
ceratin amount of idle time. Do you think that would help?
