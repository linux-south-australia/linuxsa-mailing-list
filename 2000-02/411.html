&gt; Hi everyone, just got a strange message that's come up since I've
&gt; re-compiled my kernel, it seems strange because it happens on the new
&gt; kernel and on the original kernel. The message even comes up before I
&gt; log on and seems to keep coming up about every 2 minutes, but it doesn't
&gt; interfere with any of the commands I'm typing even if it appears in the
&gt; middle of a line, it's wierded me out.

Okay, I assume that you are on the a virtual terminal.  Most likely the
first one (available via ALT-F1).

gdm is the GNOME display manager (an alternative to xdm).  It is a program
which manages and controls the X windows display.  The messages are getting
emitted by gdm, which is a user level program (and absolutely nothing to
do with the Linux kernel).

&gt; this is how it goes;
&gt; gdm_config_parse: Can't find the gdm user (gdm). Aborting!
&gt; if anyone can tell me what this means and what stupid thing I've done to
&gt; cause it, I'd really appreciate it.

As has been pointed out, an 'rpm -ql gdm' gives you a list of what 
files are associated with the package.  'rpm -qi gdm' will give you a
little bit of a display about what the package is used for.

But anyway, gdm (once started) relinquishes it's root priveledges by becoming
a non priveledged user.  The useris configured in /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf.

In this file there is a line

	User=gdm

which defines the user that gdm becomes.  Chances are you have deleted this
user (gdm) not knowing what it is used for.  If you want to get things 
going again, do an 'rpm -e gdm' and then a 'rpm -i gdm*' in the directory that
contains your standard redhat RPMS.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Matthew
