Alan!

&gt; Topic: Linux doesn't make it in the real corporate world.

It depends what you want to do. If you're running a server type system,
permanent internet connection, router or such then I've had experience
watching what an NT box does (or doesn't do whichever way you want to
look at it) to that. 

&gt; Well, now I've given both Star Office and Word Perfect
&gt; a go as a word processor compatible with MS Word
&gt; in a serious work context for 5 weeks.

If you're looking for document formatting or such *without*
compatibility with Microsoft's proprietary format then obviously they
would both fail. A statement such as "Microsoft Word renders Microsoft
Word documents the way Microsoft Word does" seems a bit cyclical, but
it's true. If you insist on 100% MS Word compatibility then use MS Word.

If the results are what you are after - and not the compatibility - then
Star Office or Corel's WP work admirably. In addition there's LyX, tex,
latex and other formatting systems that work just as well. To put it
bluntly, I find LyX a lot easier to use to write technical documents
than a WYSIWYG word processor.

&gt; Result: both fail.

On your standards.
 
&gt; So there you have it.
&gt; In a serious work environment, where people
&gt; are paying me money to write reports, they
&gt; cannot read my documents correctly, and I have
&gt; to effectively abandon linux.

In a serious Work Environment, might I suggest from the side, I would
write a report under Windows using a DOCUMENT formatter and not a damned
Word Processor. Personally I like PageMaker, although Quark Express is
just as good. For a small report MS WORD kind of does the job, but I was
told to write a larger, manual using MS WORD and it was a nightmare.

At least, it was a nightmare to write and format. Using Word actually
took me a significantly longer amount of time to write it and because I
was paid on an hourly basis it was good for the wallet. But where did
the word "efficiency" go in this equation?
 
&gt; It's pointless saying that my OS is the best
&gt; and windows is rubbish when youare told that you
&gt; will be paid lots of money if and _only_ if
&gt; you produce outputs that they can read in
&gt; a "standard" format -- i.e. windows, as far as they're
&gt; concerned.

Let then have their Windows. If they want you to do it in Windows but
you could do it more efficiently using Linux, let them PAY for Windows.
Tough titties is my opinion. 

&gt; This is why I continue to say:
&gt; "linux needs another 2 years to make it on the client PS",
&gt; which I think is not a controversial view.

It's coming along. Now, if the Unix companies hadn't had such a
protracted war about what and who owns Unix and actually realised the
(once) niche market that Microsoft did we might not be having this
debate. People don't *want* to administer Unix like systems. They don't
*want* to read man pages or info pages. They do *want* something that
works. Straight away and is easy to use.

They'll pay good money for that and they'll cope with a lot of problems
for that. But if it does the job then it does the job. It's a fact of
life. We all have to live with it. Putting it bluntly we can't all
expect everyone to become "Unix like gurus" and administer their own
systems...I don't expect people to know how to milk cows, pasteurise the
milk, skim the cream, freight it to the super market, fill in the
orders, price it correctly and then sell it to themselves. I do expect
them to know how to pay for a carton/bottle of milk and open it.

Yikes, if we all took time out to actually see what sometimes parts of
the linux community expect of "newbies" it's really quite ridiculous.
Imagine if we were all forced to become experts on the production and
working of every commodity we use!!!!

Anyway, enough from me.
