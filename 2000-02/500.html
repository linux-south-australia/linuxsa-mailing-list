&gt; What gotcha's are then when using NIS or NIS+ for Linux to allow access to
&gt; the various NIS or NIS+ maps.

I haven't played with NIS+ on Linux, but using NIS+ in NIS compatibility
mode for Linux works a treat (in fact RH 6.1 allows NIS as an install
option.

&gt; Automounter gotchas and problems.

Mostly work fine except for the root (-) point.  Basically you need to 
define most of the base mount points for autofs to pick them up.  I haven't
looked too closely at what the autofs/NIS integration give you but it appears
to be there.

&gt; Also, what issues are faced when looking at NFS mounting applications on a
&gt; Linux box rather than, say, simply installing them all on each Linux box. I
&gt; am thinking of issues like shared libraries, and ldconfig and the like.

The main problem with integrating NFS under Linux with Solaris is that 
Linux will talk NFS v2 against a Solaris box (Solaris against Solaris 
will talk NFS v3).  The difference in performance being that NFSv3 allows
asynchronous writes, whilst NFS v2 on Solaris will always write the 
data before completing the RPC call.  In other words, NFS write performace
sux (Linux -&gt; Solaris that is).  The Linux nfs daemon doesn't enforce the
synchronous writes, and so Linux -&gt; Linux (and I would imagine Solaris -&gt;
Linux) work quite snappy.

To mitigate the Linux -&gt; Solaris problem you can by hardware from Sun which
effective give a NVRAM disk which the system writes to first.  This has 
the effect of increase Linux write performance by typically an order of
magnitude.  (IIRC the hardware is called a Prospero server - but I could
be wrong).

Regards,

Matthew
