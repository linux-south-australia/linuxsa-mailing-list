[Tales of Internet Banking deleted]

&lt;vent organ="spleen"&gt;

In one of my (schizophrenic) roles I've been known to do some ISP
work.  One of the biggest gripes I have with Internet Banking is
that the banks' help desks are _very_ quick to put blame on the ISP,
especially if the word "firewall" or "cache" is mentioned.  Quite
often they will say "Oh, yes, we have quite a few customers who have
problems with ISP 'x' because of their firewall", despite the fact
that it appears that:

a)  'x' varies considerably (depending on who the customer uses).
b)  The firewall doesn't exist between the customer and the rest of
    the 'net.

If a customer comes in with problems, I will usually dial them
into another ISP (one with no web caching/proxying on their link)
to see if it clears the problem.  So far, it has yet to do so.

Another bank (which I can't remember who, otherwise I'd name them
on the spot) put up an "Under construction" notice on their entire
site while it was being revamped, then put up new pages with dates
that preceeded the under-construction web pages, so as a consequence
web caches thought (quite correctly) that they had the most recent
pages cached (which was the under construction notices).  Tried as
hard as I could to convince the IT guys that this was a fault of
their doing, to no avail.  They just didn't "get it".  I feverently
hope that these aren't the guys in charge of their computer security
in general.

&lt;/vent&gt;

Must be the curse of the Daryls'.  :-)
