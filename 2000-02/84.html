Hi,

&gt; &gt; Alot of the thin client talk I've heard about M$ opperating systems,
&gt; &gt; involves downloading the App from the internet. It still sounds like alot
&gt; &gt; of processing is done client side.
&gt; 
&gt; If you mean MS Terminal Server, I think you'll find that *all* the work
&gt; is done on the server. I've seen setups with 486 Win311 machines using
&gt; terminal server to run outlook and excel etc...

No thinking more about the talk I've heard of downloadable apps. You wan
to use MS Word say, you go to the M$ site, click the link, it runs some
AciveX or Java or something version of word for a time fee, then charges
your bank account.

The current buzz people are promoting this for cheep PCs, you only need
minimum hardware to run this they say, as everything is transfered from
the internet. The description is still very much processing most stuff
locally tho.

&gt; My question, is this. On MS Terminal Server, I think the recommendation
&gt; is 32meg per user, and a small Cray. For a linux/unix solution, what
&gt; gruntiness factor would the server need? (asuming not running things
&gt; like StarOffice....)

Well the last point is the deciding factor. A linux server running telnet
sessions, and things like pine and emacs, can run quite a number of users
simultaneously. I've seen an alpha 3000 with 16MB of RAM handle 20 users
XDisplaying, and it was slow, but not impossibly slow.

So, if you want 50 people rendering on the one server, put alot of beef
into the maximum hardware you can. If you want 50 people to run XEdit, get
a standard pentium, and put a good SCSI disk into it, and it'll cope fine.

cya
