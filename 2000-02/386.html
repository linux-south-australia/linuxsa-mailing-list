Alan,
    I'm not sure if it's the same on the Linux Acroread, but on my W95
version, there is a button on the toolbar which has a capital 'T' and a
dotted box on it. If you click on this, you can then highlight text and copy
and paste. The resulting paste into Word is a little messy, but it does
work.

cheers,


Brett



&gt;Michael,
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for giving me hope --- but....
&gt;I just tried doing some text selection in
&gt;acroread and gv for a PDF file generated from
&gt;a PS file with ps2pdf, where the PS file came
&gt;from dvi2ps, out of plain TeX.
&gt;Nothing in the way of text selection was possible.
&gt;
&gt;I also asked a friend with wind98/woffice97 to
&gt;try the same thing with my PDF file.
&gt;Also no luck.
&gt;The whole PDF could be read into MS-Word,
&gt;but not any subset.
&gt;And once inside Word, the PDF contents could not be edited
&gt;except with a picture editing program.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;================
&gt;On the slightly positive side, I've now installed the
&gt;Corel Word Perfect 8 that comes with the IDG book
&gt;"Word Perfect for Linux Bible".
&gt;After changing the CD-ROM mount for the disk
&gt;to add the "exec" attribute, I was able to do the
&gt;installation, although the script (Bourne shell)
&gt;warned that it was not guaranteed to work for
&gt;later than 2.0.18 kernel or something. (I use
&gt;2.2.10 on the machine in question.)
&gt;
&gt;After getting it installed, I was able to
&gt;export my Star-Office file to MS-Word 6.0
&gt;format and incorporate it into WP8 -- if I
&gt;removed the PostScript file inclusions first.
&gt;
&gt;It does not seem to be possible to include PS or
&gt;PDF files in a WP8 document. I tried, and it said
&gt;it can't conver the format.
&gt;Maybe it can do .eps or .epsi files -- I'll
&gt;try that some time.
&gt;
&gt;=========================
&gt;My impression of WP8, though, is that it is even worse than
&gt;SO, which is even worse than MS-Word, which is much worse
&gt;than plain TeX (if you happen to know how to write programs).
&gt;
&gt;Since WP8 can't do even PS files (and SO did actually include and
&gt;print them, and they did sort of work in the word97 output),
&gt;I'm beginning to think that SO might be the way to go after all.
&gt;
&gt;=========================
&gt;Here's the way I think may be best for doing the MS .doc format
&gt;in linux -- just keep things simple in the SO editor, and
&gt;then export as MS-Word 6.0.
&gt;This seems to be so basic as to be acceptable to whatever
&gt;runs on the MS OS.
&gt;(I tried *.rtf, but that came up as garbage in WP8.)
&gt;
&gt;========================
&gt;I must say that after suffering yet again with
&gt;the lousy document non-standardization problem,
&gt;the amount of suffering inflicted on the world by
&gt;the refusal of certain corporate entities to
&gt;accept anything that looks like a standard is
&gt;unforgivable.
&gt;I've seen W-Office 97 for sale in Saigon
&gt;for US$13, and think that's a fair price.
&gt;Hopefully the crack-down on software sharing in
&gt;Asia will lead to a mass exodus into linux.
&gt;
&gt;Cheerio,
&gt;Alan Kennington.
