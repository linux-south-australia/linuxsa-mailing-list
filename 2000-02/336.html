&gt; &gt;&gt; So there you have it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; In a serious work environment, where people
&gt; &gt;&gt; are paying me money to write reports, they
&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot read my documents correctly, and I have
&gt; &gt;&gt; to effectively abandon linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For a small report MS WORD kind of does the job, but I was
&gt; &gt; told to write a larger, manual using MS WORD and it was a nightmare.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a golden rule which is worth remembering: "He who has the gold
&gt; makes the rules."  In business, if your customer sends you a document in MS
&gt; Word format, you must find a way to read that document or find a new
&gt; customer.  If your customer asks for an electronic document in return, you
&gt; best make sure your reply can be read by Word without losing important
&gt; details.  You might not like Word but don't make that obvious to your
&gt; customer.

I find that in this situation, education is the key. I hsan't failed
for me yet.

The customer is very rarley right, otherwise they wouldn't be a
customer, they'd be doing your job. This applies to a MacDonalds
employee or CS Engineer. Just remember that beacuse they are wrong
doesn't mean you are allowed to be rude.

Keeping the customer without using word shouldn't be a problem for
most people.
