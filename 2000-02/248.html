One thing to consider when reading such articles is to realize that despite 
criticism, IT WORKS!!!!...

The average person who surfs the net has very VERY little technical 
knowledge..   Therefore, what you and i know for sure is a dose of 
propaganda, the public public will precieve as a dose of reality and get 
drunk with it.
I have to admit that I almost fell for their argument the first moment I 
read it since I didn't have my morning coffee, yet.

But for those of you who may be in that situation, consider an example from 
the Microsoft progaganda:

&gt;Sun claims to be a leader in system reliability and more reliable &gt;than 
&gt;Windows. The Reality: Major customers, such as Quote.com, are switching 
&gt;from Sun to the &gt;Microsoft Windows platform because it offers better 
&gt;reliability.

The above states MS realization of Sun's claims about reliability and could 
not provide a solid sientific proof.  To say that Company1 runs windows so 
does company2 is not a proof of windows reliability over Sun's systems..  I 
have not heard ONE computer science professor complement windows in ANY 
aspect.  I personally will have to admit that Windows have come ways with 
their system to handle networking, but that system IS an incremental model 
from their original MS-DOS operating system.  The same problems they had in 
the past are still a daily challenge to winNT Lan admins.  A reboot on the 
fly has become a sickening philosophy despite the user frienly interface 
strategies for MS.
If you are not sure what to think of such doses of reality, please, show it 
to someone who is a little more achademic than the writer of the article 
itself.

&gt;Subject: Your Daily Dose of Microsoft Reality #3
&gt;Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2000 19:29:20 +1030
&gt;
&gt;From "<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/news/dot-truth.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/news/dot-truth.asp</A>"
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The Hype:
&gt; &gt;=========
&gt; &gt;Sun Microsystems claims to be an industry leader and innovator.
&gt;
&gt;as does Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The Reality:
&gt; &gt;============
&gt; &gt;Sun is trying to resurrect the 1960s-era mainframe paradigm and return 
&gt;computing to &gt;old-style timesharing.
&gt;
&gt;Can we all say Terminal Server?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;The Proof:
&gt; &gt;==========
&gt; &gt;Customers want PCs, not Sun's proprietary thin clients.
&gt;
&gt;I'm guessing this was the servey form:
&gt;What operating system would you prefer to run:
&gt;(1) Windows 95
&gt;(2) Windows 98
&gt;(3) Windows NT 3.5
&gt;(4) Windows NT 4
&gt;(5) Windows 2000
&gt;(6) Other
&gt;
&gt;Would the average Job Blow *know* what a thin client is?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Sun offers no disconnected strategy-there is no way to work offline.
&gt;
&gt;Can we all say Terminal Server?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Little real innovation has occurred with Sun processors. The UltraSPARC 
&gt;family is &gt;falling behind Intel. Typically 50 percent more UltraSPARC 
&gt;processors are needed to &gt;match Intel performance.
&gt;
&gt;What does this mean? Based on what? Megahertz? (My 300MHz PIII is faster
&gt;than your 300MHz SPARC?) Money? (my $1200 PIII is faster than your $1200
&gt;SPARC?)
&gt;
&gt;Where they running the same OS? Really, this isn't even worth going
&gt;into. You can't compare oranges to apples.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Sun's upcoming UltraSPARC III will require replacement of existing 
&gt;customer &gt;equipment.
&gt;
&gt;I actually laughed out loud. Hard. I'd like to see you upgrade from a
&gt;PII to a PIII without replacing anything else. Next they'll be
&gt;complaining that "upgrading to a new UltraSPARC will incure costly
&gt;downtime."
&gt;
&gt;I'm *so* glad I get my "Daily dose of reality"
&gt;
