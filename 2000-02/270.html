You are right.  Word Perfect -- although I wish it was otherwise -- is
crap.  I shan't enter into discussion why; if you disagree with me: fine;
if you don't know why: try it.  Star Office is too buggy, too big and too
slow.

There is a format that reads equally well on Unix, Macintosh and Windows,
and let me say it also works on OS/2 and I suppose VMS, and that is HTML.
It's got next to no page formatting features, so if you need your logo to
be 2.5mm down from top of page, and 4.7mm left of right of page, you are
quite out of luck.  You can get you logo approximately top right of page,
and that probably is good enough.  I would say that the biggest deficiency
in HTML is that you generally need to send multiple files for the one
document.  In particular, you cannot imbed graphics in the text.  On the
bright side, HTML mail readers are quite common, and they do seem to
recognise multi-part documents.

is an example of a real-life, platform neutral business document.
