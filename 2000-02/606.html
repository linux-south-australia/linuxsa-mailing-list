I found the following interesting:

   On the other hand, I was disappointed by a few aspects of the program. 
   Although printing with lpr was touched upon briefly in unit 6, no 
   printer was available in the classroom and no labs touched on printing.
   This could be considered an omission since printing is an important part
   of Linux deployment in corporate environments.

   Likewise, no modems or phone lines were available to experiment with PPP
   (admittedly, this would be a hassle for Red Hat to administer). Another
   missing feature was the availability of a true Windows system to verify
   the Samba configurations used in the labs. We were able to check 
   operation using Samba's native tools and the Linux log files, but for
   Samba there's nothing like having a Windows box around to be sure.

Quoted from:

I found this interesting.  I don't have the resources of Red Hat, but I
have managed to put together a Linux course that covers the same areas as
the RedHat program, and manages to:

  - Provide a printer so delegates get experience setting up printing
  - Provide modems (one per delegate) and a phone elimination device
    so that delegates get experience setting up PPP dial out and dial-in
    servers
  - Windows machines (actually, dual-boot machines) so delegates can check
    out Linux as a Samba server, DHCP server, Web Server, etc.

And I certainly don't find it a hassle to provide the modems etc, except
for the money it cost.
