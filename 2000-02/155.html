At 13:31 11/02/00 +1030, you wrote:
&gt; &gt; Dymocks in Rundle Mall is good too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd also suggest you visit www.netcraft.com.au and check out
&gt; &gt; their online stuff...I'm sure if you spoke to them *nicely* they could
&gt; &gt; arrange a special pick up or something...
&gt;
&gt;...certainly will, but I recommend that you go to Dymocks in Rundle
&gt;Mall before you pop into NetCraft, just so that you can see how much
&gt;some people charge for those o'reilly books!! :o)

Hey
thanks for those suggestions.
I was planning on going to Unibooks, to see what they had, should I waste 
my time?!?
I have been to everythinglinux.com.au I think it was and there was well a 
plethora of material, which is why I really want to see it for myself and 
hear from this group what particular books they have found to be the better 
ones. So far these 2 have been recommended ($20 a piece, which is very 
reasonable considering the cost of those big "M" books):

Linux Unleashed
