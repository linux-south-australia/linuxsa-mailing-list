  Hi. I got some critisism for the letter I wrote before to do with
"facking" email. Which is not realy facking cause u can still check where
email realy came from.

  Just to make things a bit clearer:

  That email that I wrote was the letter that I sent to some of those who
sent me stupid chain letter saying that Microsoft is testing some email
tracking program and offering $1000 to those who forward that crap. The
letter you saw was what I sent to people who send ME chain letter FIRST.

  And it(letter that I made up) wasn't asking to forward it to anybody
else, just reply to Bill Gates, Bill's email was incorrect anyway (I
checked) so if they replied they would get returned email with error.

  Most damage this could've caused was dissappointment to those who
replied to Bill hoping for $1000 and got nothing.

  I sent that email to 3 ppl 2 of whom did not reply and 1 I don't know.

  I don't like chain mail and know better then to start one myself.

  Sorry for inconvinience, but I still think it was a good joke. And it
wan't bad either. There!

&gt; Here is the source of one of our "UniSA" brand chain letters.  Suprising
&gt; that he would tell lots of SA employers that he generates trash to fill
&gt; their mail servers.  
&gt; 
&gt; His letter went around earlier this year.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suspect that the way around your problem is to pipe the output of
&gt; &gt; your command into a file, add the From: header to the top of the file,
&gt; &gt; and then pipe it to sendmail directly, rather than mail. It may work,
&gt; &gt; but then again...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anybody??
&gt; 
&gt; It should work.
&gt; 
&gt; Not sure what you are trying to achive, but I was able to do following:
&gt; 
&gt; I created a file with first lines:
&gt; From: <A HREF="mailto:Name@host">Name@host</A>
&gt; Subject: Something silly
&gt; 
&gt; and piped that into mail
&gt; 
&gt; cat joke.txt | mail <A HREF="mailto:target@email.address">target@email.address</A>
&gt; 
&gt; and guess what? when recipient opens it he/she sees it as from <A HREF="mailto:Name@host">Name@host</A>!
&gt; 
&gt; you can even add Date: field
&gt; 
&gt; I did it to play joke as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; From: Bill Gates &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bgates@microsoft.com">bgates@microsoft.com</A>&gt;
&gt; Subject: We want to give you $1,000
&gt; Date: Jan 13 Fri 1750
&gt; 
&gt;  Here at Microsoft we have just finished testing our email tracking
&gt; program. You are one of the recipients of the trial email that has reached

&gt; I wonder if anyone tried to reply! I just wish I had a real email address
&gt; to Bill Gates :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm going to really really tentatively ask a question.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I need to mail the output of a command to an internet mail address.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; My linux box is called health.ior.org.au.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; When it sends mail, it says it's from "<A HREF="mailto:user@health.ior.org.au">user@health.ior.org.au</A>".  I don't
&gt; &gt; &gt; want it to.  I want to be able to specify who the mail is "From".
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to be able to type a command similar to this:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;    uptime | mail -from <A HREF="mailto:nickm@ior.org.au">nickm@ior.org.au</A> <A HREF="mailto:jimbo@ior.org.au">jimbo@ior.org.au</A>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; ...  but of course, the -from is just guessed.
