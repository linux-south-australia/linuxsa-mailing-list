Swap space represents part of your total memory pool.  There are two types
of memory model, of which the older, swapping, is probably no longer used.
Swapping involves moving a complete image to or from swap space, thus your
image is either completely in swap space or completely in physical memory.
The newer memory model, paging, divides images into small pages, typically
between 4KB and 16KB in size, which are independantly moved to or from swap
space.  A paging system can have part of an image in memory and part in
swap space; indeed an image can be very much larger than physical memory.

Many systems require at least as much swap space as physical memory, or
put another way, the total memory pool is exactly as large as swap space.
If you have more physical memory than swap space, the extra cannot be used.
Some systems allocate swap space before physical memory, reserving it for
when it might be needed, hence, usable physical memory is no greater than
swap space.

Note that the need for at least as much swap space as physical memory is
a feature of pre-allocating swap space, not of swapping.  Modern, high-
performance paging system can have this characteristic.

I don't know if Linux requires at least as much swap space as physical
memory.  If it's important you could test it quite easily (for example,
give yourself 10MB of swap space and write a program which initialises
a 100MB array.)  I've never felt a need to find out because I've always
wanted a bigger swap space than I had RAM.  RAM currently costs about
$1.4020 per MB; disk about $0.0214 per MB; I think you can see why I
don't care about the cost of swap space.
