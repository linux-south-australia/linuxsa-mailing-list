I very much suspect that you will find that it was a corrupt header and not
a virus/trojan horse.

The email was text only (albeit some crap formatting from a cut and paste of
a web page might have been present) so there was no executable present. In
addition it would have had to be pretty clever to persist around until it
finally reached a linux OS to deposit it payload.

Whilst not guaranteed to catch all virii I am running the absolute latest
patch for VET 10, simply because we were badly CIH'd not so long ago.

The bombing nature of that particular email was successfully stopped by Jake
simply by tidying up the header.

I know it did cause to be a real pain in the neck for everyone and I
apologize. For some reason our MS Exchange server here at work messed it up.

Regards

I too had that problem, except my home partition under which my emails are
stored decided to go unclean and crash my system this morning. I have a
sneaking
suspicion it was an (unwitting) virus/trojan-horse because when I convinced
e2fsck to fix my /dev/hdc1 and put the various nodes in lost+found it
contained..you guessed...email headers about winmodems.

Ah well, I guess I'm lucky I'm not using Windows. I don't know what it is
lately
but people keep on either deliberately and/or unwittingly sending me trojan
horses/virii etc.
