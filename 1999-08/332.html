&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just wondering how bad the supposed networking problems in RH6 are. I
&gt; heard (probably on this list) that there are some problem with RH6 and
&gt; networking.

I had AWFUL problems with RedHat 6.0 NFS. When any significant amount of
data was flowing (which was essentially constantly because my home
directories are NFS mounted) NFS would continually stop and restart with a
message along the lines of:

NFS server tardis is not responding
NFS server tardis OK

And something else I think - it's been a while. I seem to remember the PID
being mentioned.

I had upgraded the 'tardis' box from Linux to FreeBSD at a similar time
and at first I blamed that. Also I had upgraded the problem box ('leela')  
to 6.0 from 5.2 - I am highly skeptical of upgrades, so I tried a fresh
install of 6.0 on leela - didn't help.

I was all ready to blame the way I setup FreeBSD on tardis, but as a final
shot I nuked leela and installed Debian - problem disappeared.

I have found many similar reports on the net about this problem, but no
solutions. I think it has something to do with more NFS stuff being built
into the 2.2 kernel..... but now I just don't give a toss, since Debian is
working fine :-)

FWIW I think RedHat are doing the right thing to get themselves lots of
money and newbie users and third-party support - but it's the wrong thing
for users like me. It's definately the MS way.

&gt; I was runing RH6 on a 486DX40 for a while, which was only running
&gt; DHCPD for a network of 4 computers, and it was crashing with a kernel
&gt; panic every 24 hours or so. However, I'm not sure if that was because
&gt; of RH6 or if it was a hardware problem.

To be fair that was probably hardware. RedHat is 'just' Linux - it isn't
special as far as how it runs. I won't start ranting about how it is
'special' though :-)

&gt; I'm going to be taking my server offline sometime in the next month to
&gt; make some changes to the Net setup, and I was wondering if it would be
&gt; worth taking the opportunity to update it from RH5.2 to RH6 ??

I would nuke it and install FreeBSD on it :-)

&lt;ducks and runs&gt;

Seriously if you aren't going to nuke it and install again from scratch I
wouldn't do any OS upgrade. Even if you are prepared to do that, I think
RH 6.0 should be avoided for a while, like 5.0.
