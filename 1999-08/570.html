sound to me as is if pppd is adding a default gateway route when it
dials, but before it dials there is "no way out" :)


type "route" at a prompt, before you dial out. there should be a line
(at the bottom)
destination  gateway         genmask   &lt;stuff&gt;   iface
default      xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 0.0.0.0   &lt;stuff&gt;   eth0

where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of your eth0


if this is not there, then you need to update the file
/etc/sysconfig/network and have a line 
GATEWAY="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
GATEWAYDEV="eth0"

&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I have a minute problem someone may
&gt; have come accross before.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Linux Box(acts as the server) networked to a Windows/Linux box.
&gt; 
&gt; A simple network.
&gt; 
&gt; However, whenever I want to connect to the Linux box from the Win box,
&gt; I have to dial up first. Once dialed up all is ok and I the machines can
&gt; talk.
&gt; 
&gt; Note: I only have to dial up once....then I can disconnect and the
&gt; machines
&gt;            will still talk(ie I can log on and off...all is ok).
&gt; 
&gt; Note again: If I haven't dialed up and I attempt to talk to the Win box,
&gt; the machines
&gt;                       do somewhat talk  but do not give me a login
&gt; prompt etc,
&gt;                       and then time out.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously when I shutdown I have to dial up again to get the machines
&gt; talking.
&gt; 
&gt; However this is an expensive exercise(especially when I only want to
&gt; transfer  a few files
&gt;  accross whilst doing assignments).
&gt; 
&gt; It seems that connecting to the Internet results in addressing being
&gt; resolved......but
&gt; It is annoying(and expensive) dialing up just to talk to a machine 2
&gt; metres away from me.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions, ideas, comments, pointers, would be extremely
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx
&gt; 
&gt; Alex
