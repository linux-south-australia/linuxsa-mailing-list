Reminds me of a story (true, unfortunately) that a vietnamese friend of
mine told me ...

He went back to vietnam a year or so ago, and arrived just in time to
hear & read the notices regarding a particular computer  virus.... ALL
persons owning computers were ordered to turn off & disconnect ALL
computers on a particular day so as to avoid "catching the virus" 
Government officials were quite adamant that the virus could attack any
computer including those which were NOT connected to the internet, if
they were left on during the day in question!!

Anyway, think I better do a mass email out to all the users now :))

&gt; Forwarded message:
&gt; &gt; *** Attention ***
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It's that time again!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As many of you know, each leap year the Internet must be shut down for 24
&gt; &gt; hours in order to allow us to clean it. The cleaning process, which
&gt; &gt; eliminates dead email and inactive ftp, www and gopher sites, allows for a
&gt; &gt; better-working and faster Internet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This year, the cleaning process will take place from 12:01 a.m. GMT on
&gt; &gt; Aug. 30 until 12:01 a.m. GMT on Sept 1. During that 24-hour period, five
&gt; &gt; powerful Internet-crawling robots situated around the world will search
&gt; &gt; the Internet and delete any data that they find.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask that you do
&gt; &gt; the following:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from their Internet
&gt; &gt; connections.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. Shut down all Internet servers, or disconnect them from the Internet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any connections to the
&gt; &gt; Internet.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. Refrain from connecting any computer to the Internet in any way.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some Internet users,
&gt; &gt; and we apologize. However, we are certain that any inconveniences will be
&gt; &gt; more than made up for by the increased speed and efficiency of the
&gt; &gt; Internet, once it has been cleared of electronic flotsam and jetsam.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We thank you for your cooperation.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sysops and others: Since the last Internet cleaning, the number of
&gt; &gt; Internet users has grown dramatically. Please assist us in alerting the
&gt; &gt; public of the upcoming Internet cleaning by posting this message where
&gt; &gt; your users will be able to read it. Please pass this message on to other
&gt; &gt; sysops and Internet users as well. Thank you.
