&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to learn a bit about c++ as it is the main language of linux.
&gt; What would be the best place to start learning about programming in
&gt; linux...?? are there any HOWTO's or any other documentation that comes
&gt; with linux that can help get me started???
&gt; 

I recently started c++ programming, and found Bjarne Stroustrup's book
"The C++ Programming Language" to be very good. However, Bjarne (the
inventor of C++) lives in a world where compilers actually implement the
standard. In the real world, there are a number of inconsistencies
between the various C++ compilers, and AFAIK, none of the major ones are
100% compliant as yet (they are all "aiming" at compliance, but that
means little at the present moment). G++ is one of the better ones, but
I'm pretty sure it is also non-standard in one or two areas. I was using
SunPRO 4.2, and found it to be rather bad... This contrasts to C, Ada
(AFAIK) and Java, (the other languages that I have experience in) in
that they all seem to have fairly well-defined standards, which are
consistently implemented -- ANSI C will compile just about anywhere...

Anyway, if you stick to g++, and get a good book like Bjarne's, and
invent your own workarounds for the missing bits, then you'll be fine.
You just need to remember that code that conforms completely to the
standard will probably compile on very few compilers. This can be
frustrating if portability is an issue...

As for where to find documentation, all the system calls (and many
library calls) are documented to varying degrees in the man pages (or
Texinfo or whatever). This helps if you need to know how to call
function "xyz", but is less useful if you don't know the function
name... (although `man -k` can help). There are also a number of other
Linux/Unix focussed programming books on the market -- hunt through
amazon.com, read the comments, and buy the one that has the best
recommendations. Of course, Linux (and all GNU software) has source code
available, and other people's code is always a good way to learn (good
code is an example, bad code, a counter-example). I have no particular
suggestions as to which programs to look at first, though...  although
modifying something to make it do something else you've always wanted it
to do could be a good start.

PS: I think Nick is right about Linux being mostly C, but C++ is
(almost) a superset of C, and the two languages integrate well, and I'd
be pretty sure that there would be a reasonable quantity of C++ code in
an average Linux distro.

PPS: If you really want somewhere to look for C++ code, try the Qt
toolkit -- the source is available, and there are a number of general
algorithms and data structures in the library, which may or may not be
understandable. I am under the impression that it is a good example of
well-written code (although I haven't looked for myself).
