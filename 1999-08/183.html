&gt;I have a Voodoo3 2000 card in my new system and have tryed everything &gt;to 
&gt;get it working.
&gt;
&gt;I have installed the 3dfx_SVGA servers and the latest version of XF86
&gt;3.3.3_5
&gt;

The best way which I am aware of is to get the latest version of the XFree 
server which was 3.3.4 last time I checked.  The Voodoo Banshee and the 
Voodoo 3 chipsets are supported as of this version.

I have a Voodoo Banshee, and I installed the XFree86 3.3.4 SVGA Xserver this 
week.  It works fine @ (1024,768) 16-bit colour and presumably other video 
modes as well.

If you don't want to edit the configuration file (XF86Setup) by hand,
then you might want to download the latest version of Xconfigurator
as well.  The files you want are XSVGA.tgz and Xset.tgz which can be found 
on any mirror of the XFree86 project (<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org">http://www.xfree86.org</A>).

You could also download only the Voodoo Banshee/Voodoo 3 X server
from the person who wrote the Banshee driver you find included in the
latest XFree.  There is also a sample XF86Config file there for getting a 
Banshee to work.

Also, 3dfx and some other card manufacturers seem to be waking up to the 
Linux community, for instance Creative Labs has produced a Voodoo Banshee 
server for people with their cards.   You could check your board 
manufacturer's website as well as 3dfx's.  If you can't find one in these 
places, mail them and tell them that you want one!

Hope this helps - please tell me if it does.

Yours

Michael Wardle
