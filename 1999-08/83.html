Hi!

MacOS is cute. The whole thing fits together well, it's wonderfully consistent
and easy to use, and Macs're generally incredibly well /engineered/ - I've
found that Apple keyboards, monitors and mice are generally top notch. I don't
trust the iMac mice yet though. &lt;grin&gt;

They've got some technical features (true multihead, video manipulation, etc)
that are very very very good, too, in comparison to other platforms.

It's often said, though, that the OS lets it down. :) MacOS (before MacOS X)
doesn't do preemptive multitasking, memory management is shocking, TCP/IP was
a little dodgy before OpenTransport came along, and it's hampered by trying to
seamlessly support both the PowerPC and M68K architectures. The (old) PowerMac
i have here isn't exactly an incredibly reliable box, but the newer G3 macs
are better. If I can get hold of a spare SCSI drive somewhere, I'm going to
stick MkLinux on the one I have here and see how it fares with Linux on it.

A lot of the perceived problems with MacOS as an OS have apparently been
rectified with MacOS X, which is based on the excellent pedigree of NeXT
technology - I haven't actually played with it, but the core stuff (the
"Darwin" platform you sometimes see talked about) is BSD based, which is
promising. NeXT stuff is almost universally accepted to have been incredibly
cool for its time.

Has anyone got access to a machine running this? What's it like?
