&gt; &gt; Nick:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please inform me what a "true" unix user is? I almost exclusively use 
&gt;RedHat 6.0
&gt; &gt; at home and SunOs 2.6 at University unless they force me to use the 
&gt;Windows NT
&gt; &gt; server.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess if you mean that a nontrue unix user is someone who does not use 
&gt;unix
&gt; &gt; then obviously you're patently wrong. However, if you mean that a 
&gt;nontrue unix
&gt; &gt; user is someone who doesn't use unix like you do then what you're saying 
&gt;is
&gt; &gt; obviously true but only from *your* point of view.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I consider myself a "true" unix user. Having only used it for one year I 
&gt;am
&gt; &gt; still discovering a lot about the operating system, however I don't 
&gt;appear to do
&gt; &gt; anything altogether differently than other users on linuxSA. I would 
&gt;note that a
&gt; &gt; number of other users indicated they used Netscape to cope with their 
&gt;email...I
&gt; &gt; guess they're not true users either.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To be perfectly frank, I'm not altogether convinced that accusing 
&gt;someone of
&gt; &gt; being a nontrue user of unix (or anything else) is either constructive, 
&gt;or for
&gt; &gt; that matter provable. Whilst I am not too slighted by your comments, I 
&gt;do find
&gt; &gt; them a little disturbing and a little elitist.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ah well, so goes the world.
&gt;
&gt;I think what Nick should have said was "You're not a hard core UNIX
&gt;user, unless you have a sense of humour".
&gt;
&gt;Sorry to joke around David, but you do look pretty funny right now.
&gt;
&gt;Tee hee
&gt;

&gt;Alex Garner &lt;<A HREF="mailto:alex@garner.cx">alex@garner.cx</A>&gt;
&gt;
&gt;...I should have taken the blue pill.
Yeah .I agree with Nick.Normally student in the UNIX world is a beginner 
only ( Useless there is someone like our Linux Creator...).
But you shoulf not have any hardfeeling to Nick ,Anyway you're student,In a 
preocess of learning.Give him some face for this kids.We elders should bully 
the kids or shows our fangs to them as if we 're very skilled,expert as 
there are more than meets the eyes.There are a lot more people who are more 
experts than we're although we think we 're.
