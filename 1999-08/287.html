 &gt; Can the authentication given to a user within a WEB browser be used to
 &gt; execute scripts?

Generally speaking, no -- For a start, root privileges are required to
use the setuid() system call, and nobody in their right mind would run
a web server with root privileges (except Microsoft, who don't seem to
see the problem even though IIS has been subjected to several successful
buffer overflow attacks).

I'd suggest not using .htaccess basic authentication: Use a form to
obtain a username and password using CGI and pass back a
cryptographically-generated token based on that username and password
as a short-duration cookie (you can submit the form over HTTPS for
attitional security during the authentication phase).  The cookie
would then be available to any cgi script which needed to know about
it; those scripts should be *VERY* well audited and setuid root so
that they can use setuid() to change their user-id to whatever value
corresponds to the logged-in user.

The actual programming isn't that difficult, and consists mainly of
off-the-shelf components from CPAN.  There are modules which do encryption,
cookies and CGI already, you just tie 'em together.

 &gt; I have tried this on Apache and Netscape, both have the same problem..

I think you'll find that that's by design, not by accident, and that
the designers of Apache and Netscape don't concur with your evaluation
of the "feature" as a "problem".  It's details like that which work
best to illustrate the half-assed attitude that some
vendors-with-two-letter-acrynyms have towards security...
