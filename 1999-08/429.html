&gt; I don't particularly want to repartition (again). However I need to
&gt; somehow giv more space to my / partition on the fly. I'm convinced that
&gt; you can append a directory (say) on /usr to the / partition without
&gt; having to repartition but I'm not certain of the commands to use.

The art of Unix administration.

Balancing disk usage.

There is generally no way to extend a Unix file system, although recent
advances such as JFS, which we Linux users don't get to enjoy (yet) do
permit  it.  When a filesystem fills up, the time honored technique is
to find another filesystem, perhaps on a different (and maybe new) disk,
and to balance your files across them both.  Do this by identifying a
directory tree which can be moved, such as your users' directories, or
perhaps your log files, or your /usr filesystem.  Move all of the files
to the new filesystem and either mount the new filesystem over the old
directory, or else place a symbolic link from the old directory pointing
to the new location.  Remember if you move /usr that during bootup these
files will not be available: Rule: Make sure you can mount filesystems
without /usr being present!
