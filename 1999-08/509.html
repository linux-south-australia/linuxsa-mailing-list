Hello folks,
      Last week, I experienced a nightmare with my hard drive.  All of a 
sudden, my computer started to make a regularly frequent ticking sound 
inside... That kind of sound when you have a key pressed for a long time, 
BUT louder.. and it started producing the following message

       hda: unexpected_intr: status:0x80 {busy}
       hda: status timeout: status:0x80 {busy}
       hda: drive not ready for command

The problem is that I restarted the machine, but it would never go past the 
"AntiVirust Chip check".. it would ask me press F1 to continue and then 
linux would not load...
I entered my emergency Disk and typed "rescue" but still didn't help...
  At the end, I got frustrated and turned off the machine..  When I turned 
it on again, things started to work fine..  Of course, it complained about 
the filesystems not being mounted cleanly and forced me to do a "fsck" 
manually for my hda5 hda6 and hda7 where I have /usr /home /users 
directories mounted to..
I was amazed of the huge number of blocks that got corrected.. I don't seem 
to have that problem anymore.. Or may be because I am being careful... 
However, I don't have the chgrp command there anymore
Any suggestion on what might be the problem..  An overall solution for the 
whole thing that happened and a temporary one for the "chgrp" one.

Sorry for the message being too long.. I wanted to be a little too 
descriptive.
Thanks
Nour
