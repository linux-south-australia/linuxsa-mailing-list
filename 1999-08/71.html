Hi,   I finally got to tinker with the Mac at work which I think is a
fairly new power pc, not one of the new lolly pop variety.  Font
presentation is poor which may be due to the font rasterizer.  I never
took much notice until the boss announced that she was going to see an
opthamologist to find out why she was getting so much eye strain.  Multi
tasking seems to be unreliable so much so that we don't risk doing it.
An instruction I was given was that if it gives a ...fragment error,
'shut down the program, restart it and hope it works'.
  I'm not asking for instructions to correct this, just asking if this
what we are stuck with.  I'm trying to get the boss to look at the setup
or let me have a look or at least get the guy who sold it to fix it
(and she wants to buy another one!).
  I was under the impression that the Macintosh was a better platform
than the pc but this one seems a bit of a disappointment.  Unfortunately
linux doesn't meet our needs at work.

Conrad.
