Have experienced similar issues on a Celeron 400 box.

	In our case it appears to be poorly written drivers (Davicom 9102
based NIC), These are very new and I only have a beta from the manufacturer.

Seems a lot better running an "old" established NIC.

Have just upgraded Kernel from 2.2.5-15 to 2.2.11 and cannot tell if things
have improved (the Davicom driver crashes in minutes rather than hours now).
Only upgrade issue was resolving incoming telnet session problem (no ports
available message) which ended up being fixed by adding /dev/pts entry in
fstab. Am currently running Etherworks 3 NIC and fingers are crossed to see
how it works. 


There were significant changes to PCI IRQ handling etc in changing to RH6.0
(I had to modify my Davicom RH5.2 driver by hand in order to get it to even
work), and I suspect there will be some issues with drivers (especially the
rarer or wierder ones).

Our Dial-in RH6 box does not give any problems and experiences significant
uptime.

My best approach would be to suggest the use of an alternative NIC and
driver and see if things improve. NIC's based on  Realtek chipsets (eg 8912
etc) (really common in Win environments) are often a bit flaky. (super cheap
manufacture being the root cause).

Hey All,

I'm just wondering how bad the supposed networking problems in RH6 are. I
heard (probably on this list) that there are some problem with RH6 and
networking.

I was runing RH6 on a 486DX40 for a while, which was only running DHCPD
for a network of 4 computers, and it was crashing with a kernel panic
every 24 hours or so. However, I'm not sure if that was because of RH6 or
if it was a hardware problem.

I'm going to be taking my server offline sometime in the next month to
make some changes to the Net setup, and I was wondering if it would be
worth taking the opportunity to update it from RH5.2 to RH6 ??


Any thoughts? Ideas? Experiences?

Thanks
Dazz
