&gt; &gt; &gt; I completely disagree: that is the "old way". I agree that you can do

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I'm recruiting I often receive applications from recent Uni
&gt; graduates.
&gt; &gt; It's often been the case that these graduates have seemed very similar,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; when put to the test -- we always give a technical examination -- they
&gt; often
&gt; &gt; are quite incapable of demonstrating understanding.  Even people with
good
&gt; &gt; grades.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think peeople who can program can do so, not because of what they
&gt; learned
&gt; &gt; at university, but because they put in the effort.  If you go to
&gt; university
&gt; &gt; with the expectation that you will magically become a programmer you are
&gt; &gt; going to be disappointed.
&gt;
 I fully agree....
I did "Into to Programming" and "Intro to C" at TAFE as part of my course
(electronic engineering at regency).
Many poeple in the class did the subjects not as part of a course, but for
work or personal intrest.
Even though i didnt know C at the time (but had great experience in asm and
pascal), i breezed through the subject because I generaly know how to
program, well I would like to think so anyway :P
So i picked up C quite easily and i found all i had to do was learn C's
syntax.

 But some people in the class just couldnt pick up what programing consisted
of..... it wasnt C itself whcih they couldnt learn, it was the structure and
logical thinking which they couldnt handle.

 I know many people can learn a language such as C or C++ (or even assembly)
and program in it for years on end... but it still wont mean they are a good
programmer.


&gt; &gt; I don't say, not for one minute, that university will be a waste of
time.
&gt; &gt; You can learn things there.  The question was what is the best way to
&gt; learn;
&gt; &gt; and I still believe the best way to learn is by doing.

Yes... the actuall TAFE programming courses are good and anyone can enroll
in them.
But dont be supprised if you find learing a language difficult, most of the
time its not learning the language which is the problem.... Its getting your
mind around the problem and working out how to solve it.
