I thoroughly agree. 

I went to uni in '92 and it was OK. I learnt some pascal and some COBOL
and while perhaps the languages weren't so useful, the programming
concepts were. OK the COBOL was just junk from start to finish :-)

I went back to uni this year and it has gone to hell (IMO).

I learn much more by buying a couple of books (yes they are expensive, but
if well chosen a good investment) and sitting down and playing.

Also, I've found that O'reilly books make better textbooks than any ever
on a Computer Science subject text list.

If you want some more reasons:

o Do it in your own time
o Set your own interesting assignments (ie something useful to you!)
o Pick the language you want and like

I taught myself enough Perl to make myself useful in my workplace and as a
result I no longer answer phones all day. Perl is only looked at in
passing in any curriculum I've looked at (though that is a small number).

Horses for courses naturally, but it worked for me.

As an aside, there is a temptation (well, there was for me) to think that
you've got the cool free OS, you've got the free development tools, you've
got the 'net, you've got all the learning materials you'll ever need.

I think that there is no substitute for books in learning to program.
Spend some money on a few and you won't regret it. Read them cover to
cover. Take them to bed. Take them on the train. Take them while your SO
visits her mother.
