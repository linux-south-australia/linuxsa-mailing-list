[FROM ORIGINAL MESSSAGE]

Well,

To add fuel to this debate.  IMHO not having automount is one of the
most
primitive aspects of Linux to date.  It's stupid UNIX purist rubbish
like
this that is keeping Linux off desktops.  This, the logon prompt, and to
a
lesser extent a home directory based filesystem.

To become a true desktop GUI Linux needs to pull away from its multiuser
past a little.

&gt;&gt;  It is one of the annoying things about *nix
&gt;&gt; that it cannot get it's act together and automount anything without a big
&gt;&gt; stick and a thump on the keyboard, the whole (un)mount(ing) idea is bl**dy
&gt;&gt; stupid.
&gt;
&gt;I disagree wholeheartedly. One of the things I hate about Windows and
&gt;Microsoft is that they automount everything. I can safely let my friends
&gt;muck around with my machine in the knowledge that they can't even mount
&gt;my own partition (where I keep my private) stuff, destroy it or anything
&gt;silly like that.
&gt;
&gt;Besides, there is support for an automounter in the newer kernels. It
&gt;does exist, it's just that there are good reasons that automojnt doesn't
&gt;exist in most unixen.

[RESENT MESSAGE WITH MY REPLY]

Hal:

&gt; To add fuel to this debate.

I enjoy debates. If this hasn't been noticed before, then one gets used
to it. Please note that my opinions are never humble; they are mine and
I will defend them.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt; not having automount is one of the most
&gt; primitive aspects of Linux to date.

TOMOUNT(8)                                         AUTOMOUNT(8)

NAME
       automount - configure mount points for autofs

SYNOPSIS
       automount   [options]  mount-point  map-type[,format]  map
       [map-options]

DESCRIPTION
       The automount program is used to configure a  mount  point
       for  autofs,  the  inlined  Linux  automounter.  automount
       works by taking a base mount-point and map file, and using
       these (combined with other options) to automatically mount
       file systems within the  base  mount-point  when  they  are
       accessed  in  any  way.   The file systems are then autoun-
       mounted after a period of inactivity.

That is a man page from RedHat 6.0 using kernel 2.2.5-15. In my CORRECT
opinion Linux does have and can be configured to automount. Although I
am not certain how to use this [I don't use automount and I don't
particularly like it], there's no reason why it can't be used or
kickstarted to set up.

Many linux users obviously haven't contacted RedHat or SuSe et al and
asked them to include such an option. Is it such a pity that they, too,
are driven by market forces and don't automatically install items users
don't want?

&gt;  It's stupid UNIX purist rubbish like
&gt; this that is keeping Linux off desktops.

UNIX purist rubbish like what? UNIX has never liked automounting any
particular device. In the past there have been very real reasons for
this practice - imagine the chaos that could occur if anyone
(maliciously or otherwise) unmounted the root partition on a 600 user
UNIX system.

On the other hand, Windows has always used an automount system of sorts.
This makes it easier for users to use and also makes explaining
computers quite easy. Windows has always aimed at making things easy -
if a little dangerous - for all users.

There are benefits in both of these approaches. I don't like to mount
all my partitions automatically, especially my floppy drive and cd
drive. This is primarily to protect me from myself, but it also makes it
very difficult for hackers or my friends as I've stated before to stuff
my system up or accidentally load a virus onto it.

Linux has the best approach. Linux allows one to choose and installs the
SAFEST approach (no automount) first.

&gt;  The logon prompt

Windows NT has a logon prompt and NT users seem to be able to understand
it. Logon prompts are an integral part of any system and once users
understand the extra protection multiple accounts can have they normally
quite agree. In addition, it's added protection against people hacking
into your account. 

&gt; a home directory based filesystem.

There is nothing stopping any user from working out how to avoid the
home directory based file system. You simply make / itself the home
directory and chmod recursively everything to +rwx. Having a home
directory has stopped me from making my drive look like a dogs dinner
(like my old windows partition used to).

This will force all users (desktop or otherwise) to actually think about
how they organise their own directories. It also stops them from prying
into other directories. Recently, I had a trojan horse which essentially
attempted to wipe the first partition it landed on off. It managed to
zap my /home and somehow managed to rearrange /usr a little, but my
system was recoverable.

What is wrong with making order out of chaos?

&gt; To become a true desktop GUI Linux needs to pull away from its multiuser
&gt; past a little.

People need to understand that linux is a much more powerful operating
system (in some respects if not all) than Windows. Complexity is the
trade-off to a certain extent. Nonetheless, tools like
linuxconf/netcfg/suseconfig are now appearing to help users along. GNOME
and KDE (more so KDE) come with a whole suite of GUI tools to ease the
administration of the system.

Nonetheless, using these tools can make one's system a black box.
Something that works but one doesn't understand. It's not necessarily a
good thing to work with. Black box tools can make the system work, but
whether they do that well or efficiently is another question.

Linux offers people a choice Windows does not. I am not prepared to
allow linux become a closed, black box system simply to satisfy the
masses. Linux can still be a fantastically powerful, useful, multi-user
operating system as well as being able to be operated via the black box.

I simply would like to say that Linux is much more configurable via the
text configuration files, but that more and more tools are being made to
help people write these files without having to know how. I think a
balance can be made between the two.

For such balance we need to rely on KDE, GNOME, SusE, RedHat to name a
few. We need to rely on each other as well. UNIX is not hampered by its
multi-user past...this is one of its strengths and as time goes by our
computers may once again become part of a permanent, all the time up
network connection. And this is essentially what UNIX has always
supported.
