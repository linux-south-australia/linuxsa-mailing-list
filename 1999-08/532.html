&gt; [see original message]
&gt; Thank you for the tips, these sound _very_ useful.  When I build a kernel, I
&gt; use make xconfig and select processor type Pentium.  Would this implement
&gt; most of the optimisations which you suggest?
&gt; 
 
To start with I prefer to make my kernels without X running. This was
when I hd less than 64mB of memory; the more memory you can give to gcc
(or any other compiler for that matter) the better. In addition, make
xconfig still walks one through a significant mount of turned off
options and it is easy to miss something. Make menuconfig (it is still a
graphical style interface) is a lot easier and literally hides some of
the totally unselected options.

To do the optimistions I suggested, you actually need to edit the
Makefiles yourself. Depending on what kernel you have, the Makefile in
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386 will set an -mcpu=pentium[or whatever you
select] but not a -march=pentium[same caveat]. The gcc info pages state

`-mcpu=CPU TYPE'
	&lt;SNIP&gt;
     While picking a specific CPU TYPE will schedule
     things appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler will
     not generate any code that does not run on the i386 without the
     `-march=CPU TYPE' option being used.
.
Make sure that when you see the various bits and pieces scrolling by you
see a -march=pentium or you'll get stuck with a kernel not optimised for
the pentium chips. The optimisations I do are not standard but on my
system (at least) they haven't caused a crash.

The only time my system dies is when I manage to break something (!!).

Keeping guard by the stars, you fill our hearts with the hope of love
But love is a mystery to me, my heart now grows old
Though the stars tremble at your sight, how I long to meet you again!
