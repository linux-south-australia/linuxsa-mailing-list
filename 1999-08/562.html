&gt; I have now discovered the tool "bc". It's an excellent tool but, if I

&gt; even a hint of its naem you're tufeed.

[<A HREF="mailto:dt@orac">dt@orac</A> dt]$ man -k calc  
[...pruned...]
bc (1)               - An arbitrary precision calculator language
dc (1)               - an arbitrary precision calculator
ipcalc (1)           - perform simple manipulation of IP addresses
xcalc (1x)           - scientific calculator for X

However, I agree with you, if you don't know what you're looking for
then it's going to be substantially harder to find it (or even know
that it exists).  I found out about e2fs' file attributes by accident
when reading the installation instructions for Cyrus imapd.  Sometimes
I ls /bin (or something other useful directory) and pick on a command
I've never seen before, and probably would never have known otherwise.

_BUT_ this isn't a Unix specific problem, more of a "domain knowledge"
problem.  Having just recently wrestled with Word 8 (and lost) trying
to disable most of its features just to get a simple document typed up,
it strikes me that its help system is no better than Unix's, despite
all of the "intuitiveness" it is purported to have (if I ever meet up
with Bill Gates, I'll have a place to insert that damned paper-clip).
MS' notion of "coddling the user" is very fustrating at times.  And
could you show me where in Microsoft's Help (under NT) it points to
where persistent routing information is stored (both before and after
whichever Service Pack it changed in)?

The solution?  I dunno, but it ain't Microsoft.  Maybe Fred Butzen
could be co-erced into writing some more of his wonderful man pages
that he did for Coherent (I agree whole-heartedly with David Newall
here; info does suck bigtime, and a well written man-page is a thing
of beauty and a (bill) joy forever :-).

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
