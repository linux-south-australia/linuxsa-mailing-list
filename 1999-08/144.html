&gt; Most modems available these days are 56k capable (V90?), BUT it is my
&gt; understanding that you only gain a benefit when one end is a digital modem

&gt; best you can get is 33.6kbps.  Can anyone confirm or deny?

The simple answer is yes.

V90 is an asymetric protocol in more ways than one.  First to note, the
modem that you use at home, called the consumer modem, is completely
different to the one that you use at the server, called the digital modem.
The digital modem must be connected to a digital line, such as ISDN, and
there may be no analogue component in the communication link between the
digital modem and the consumer modem other than the very last link.  The
link between the consumer modem and the exchange may be analogue.  All
other parts must be digital.

V90 (Kflex, X2) works on the basis that modern telephone networks are
almost totally digital.  From handset to exchange is analogue, at which
point the signal is digitised using a codec; and that digital signal is
transported without possibility of error.

Analogue modems work by splitting the audio spectrum into a number of fixed
points, each very loosely described by volume + frequency.  These points
are known as a constellation.  Each point on the constellation represents
a symbol that the modem can transmit or receive.  Due to imperfections in
analogue technology, the signal that is received can be a little different
to the one that was sent--perhaps a little different in volume, perhaps a
little different in frequency--so the receiving modem must decide what
symbol a signal is supposed to represent.

V90 works by "knowing" certain characteristics of the codec used in the
exchange, and only transmitting those symbols "known" to be optimal.
Fortunately modern exchanges "all" use the same codec.  (Hmmm, anyone want
to place bets on how long V90 continues to work?)  Any digital to analogue
conversion causes loss of accuracy and makes V90 unusable.  During initial
handshake, V90 modems test the communications pathway.  If it is not
sufficient, for example if there is more than one analogue component,
they revert to analogue standards such as V.34.  Two consumer modems, even
if one or both are connected to an ISDN line, are guaranteed to revert to
this analogue mode (because consumer modems use analogue signaling.)


&gt; While PPP is capable of compression, most modems also do very good
&gt; compression, and if I enable PPP compression, I may be fighting the
&gt; compression the modems can do.  So, I am better off letting the modems do
&gt; the compression.  Can anyone confirm or deny?

If you permit the modem to do compression ipso facto you permit it to do
error recovery.  This can result in long delays between received bytes
where no long delay ought to be.  Will PPP cope with this elegantly, or
will it request retransmission?  It will almost always cause loss of error
counts, so you'll have no way of telling whether the line is good or bad.

There was a time when I perceived better performance allowing PPP to do
error recovery.  On the other hand perception, unlike scientific
measurement, can be most misleading.  I advise you either to conduct your
own scientific experiments, and please to report back to us; or else toss
a coin.
