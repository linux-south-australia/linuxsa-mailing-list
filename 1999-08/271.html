I fear my memory may be letting me down.  If I said "PSI", how would you
respond?

I am pleased to admit that I was mistaken.  Having been given a reason to
search modern documentation, I discover that, as you said, the Open Group,
who own the Unix brand name, now require something very like the Korn Shell
for the standard /bin/sh.  This is different to the historic standard.
Even when you try to maintain currency, things still slip by.

I don't know what Posix specifies, and I am annoyed that neither IEEE or
the IEEE Computer Society (both of which organisations I am a member)
provide free web access to posix-1003.2-1992, which was the standard you
referred me to.  I think that's quite selfix and unnecessary of them.
Grump.  (Posix 1003.2 used to be almost identical to XPG3; no doubt this
is still the case.)

Obviously I no longer claim anything technically wrong with your suggestion.
I might say, too, that I'd be disappointed if you inferred any criticism
of the utility of $(...).  I have nothing against new features and while
I still usually use the older `...` from force of habit, I agree that
$(...) is superior (particularly if you want nested command substitution.)
