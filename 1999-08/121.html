&gt; Subject: K6-2/400 CPU; MSI mainboard; linux failure?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Problem:
&gt; &gt; I changed my old PC from a P133 on an Intel FX chipset
&gt; &gt; mainboard to a brand new MSI mainboard
&gt; &gt; (Micro-Star MS-5184 baby-AT VI14 mainboard with VIA chipset,
&gt; &gt; 128 MB RAM (2 x 64 MB SDRAM DIMMs) and an AMD K6-2/400 CPU.
&gt; I've had a couple of the AMD k6-2 never had a problem with them., VIA
&gt; chipset and aladin, run redhat 6.0, freebsd number of versions and win98.
I
&gt; use win98 even though its takes up a lot more disk space, for number of
&gt; reason major one being video card support.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Result:
&gt; &gt; My dual-boot wind95 + linux redhat 5.2 machine
&gt; &gt; became unusable, even after about a week of
&gt; &gt; hard work and taking it to a shop to get it "fixed".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The windows bit was interesting. I had windows95 A,
&gt; &gt; which apparently cannot be patched to cope with a
&gt; &gt; 400 MHz K6-2 CPU. So it had to be clocked back to
&gt; &gt; 300 MHz, and a patch had to be applied to remove
&gt; &gt; some sort of "windows access fault" or something.
&gt; &gt; But it still couldn't get the ethernet card working, and
&gt; &gt; the floppy drive A: froze, etc. etc.
&gt;
&gt; As far as i remember windows 95A never had support for USB (you had to get
a
&gt; addon patch to upgrade it to support it), alot of the new graphics cards
&gt; need it to work, maybe your ethernet card and stuff diapearded because
&gt; windows 95 couldnt work out irq's with it not knowing about USB ports
 most
&gt; new motherboards have them onboard and they tend to like stealing lots of
&gt; i/o and irqs).
&gt;
&gt; Most windows 95 machines I ve upgraded i normally always do a total
&gt; resintall, saves problems over time (nealry all of them havent been able
to
&gt; reboot and reconfigure themselves without dying.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The linux failed less seriously -- the ethernet card
&gt; &gt; disappeared (it should have been at address 0x6000
&gt; &gt; or something, PCI), and the com2 port (/dev/cua1) failed
&gt; &gt; - basically seemed to just disappear.
&gt;
&gt; Sounds like hardware fighting for resources and some loosing out especialy
&gt; if the ethernet card was in plug and pray mode, with the new motherboard
it
&gt; would have changed i/o and irq, best thing ive found to do is check where
&gt; they are at with the setup disk for the network card, also tend to set
&gt; ethernet cards to jumperless mode so windows doesnt change the i/o's
arooudn
&gt; on me and i dont have to change confiuration in whatever un*x your using.
I
&gt; dont use any USB devices so I always turn it off in the bios.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cure:
&gt; &gt; Chucked out the new mainboard, CPU and RAM, and put back the
&gt; &gt; old board, cpu and ram.
&gt; &gt; Result: linux went back to normal.
&gt; &gt; The PCI ethernet card reappeared at the correct address,
&gt; &gt; and /dev/cua1 reappeared.
&gt; &gt; But the wind95 didn't come back. The patch to make the
&gt; &gt; OS cope with the K6-2 chip now caused the same
&gt; &gt; windows exception with the P133 as the unpatched
&gt; &gt; version with the K6-2/400.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My point:
&gt; &gt; This is all hideously messy.
&gt; &gt; I've just lost a week out of my life (and learned
&gt; &gt; heaps about the wiring inside a PC) because
&gt; &gt; this AMD hardware and VIA-based mainboard don't seem
&gt; &gt; to work well with either linux or wind95.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Question:
&gt; &gt; I never cared about this before.
&gt; &gt; But now I'd like to know:
&gt; &gt; Should one avoid the AMD chips?
&gt; &gt; Or more precisely, should dabblers like myself
&gt; &gt; avoid AMD chips?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I read an old Computer Shopper article about
&gt; &gt; compatibility problems of AMD chips with video
&gt; &gt; cards, and this starts to make me think that
&gt; &gt; one should just avoid them. I've also heard that their
&gt; &gt; shares are going down because their product is
&gt; &gt; not much good.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Alan Kennington.
