&gt;&gt; I wanted to get a copy of linux but since I am new to linux not sure what

&gt;&gt; here are about "I had RH5.2 and it worked and when I installed RH6.0 I
got
&gt;&gt; .... error"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; RH6.? was $100+ last time I checked!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I only need to compile C programs and do word processing. Maybe go on the
&gt;&gt; net occasionaly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is it worth getting RH6.0 or 5.2 will do for my need

MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
I tried for about a month to get Debian 2 working on my dual O/S system and
eventually gave up due to the lack of documentation supplied in the
distribution and also due to the lack of support I received from linuxpress.
I did get it to work but not very well and I would only recommend it for
experienced users.  (mind you it was only $30)

I then splashed out and paid $118 for Redhat 6 and had it up and running in
less than 1 hour.  The documentation supplied was excellent and as such I
have not had to try out their support system.

RH 6 found all of my hardware during installation and I was very happy with
the install process.  My  system runs much better in linux than in windows
even though my box is designated as "designed for Microsoft Windows 98".  I
am more than happy with using Linux especially now that I have installed RH6
and it is only a matter of time b4 my dos partition will be deleted.

This linuxsa mailing list has been very helpful in my introduction to
linux - thank you.

This is only my personal experience for what it is worth.  I have no
experiences with RH5 at all but I think that a person should buy the latest
stable distribution they can get their hands on.

By the way my system is:
Dos/win98 - RH6
Hewlett Packard AMD K6-2 400 with 3D now
64 mb ram
6.4 gb hdd
integrated sis 3d graphics using shared ram
integrated sis sb16 compat sound card
