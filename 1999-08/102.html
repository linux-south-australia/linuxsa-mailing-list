that sounds like a DNS problem, as all 3 daemons need/use some sort of dns
lookup for their names.... so maybe your localhost is not setup
properly...

Have a look at these, as sendmail's hang is 99% of the time caused by a
DNS problem with localhost, or your hostname failing to convert to an ip
address.. I don't have much knowledge in this area, but when something
like that happens, I would 1st start looking at a DNS problem, although I
odn't know how making a kernel would cause that problem.....

&gt; Hi All
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently experiencing problems when booting my Linux box
&gt; onto which I have just installed kernel version 2.2.10.
&gt; 
&gt; On bootup, most system services initialise correctly, but three of them: 
&gt; sendmail, SMB services, and NMB services spend much time doing nothing.  It 
&gt; appears as though they are simply timing-out after several minutes (perhaps 
&gt; 3-10 minutes).  When shutting down, my system (Red Hat Linux 6.0) announces 
&gt; that shutting down these three services has failed.  After quite a 
&gt; substancial period of time, the system does eventually enter user mode and 
&gt; give me a login prompt.
&gt; 
&gt; Booting with my old kernel 2.2.5-15 (the one shipped with Red Hat 6)
&gt; using LiLo also doesn't fix the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I mistakenly rebooted before doing a "make modules ; make modules_install", 
&gt; although I did do this as soon as I
&gt; received a login.  I assume that this is the source of my problems.
&gt; 
&gt; If all three of these are daemons, then I suppose I could simply turn them 
&gt; of, but this would not really be useful, as I need SMB.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
