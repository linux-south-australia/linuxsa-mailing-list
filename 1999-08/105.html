WARNING WARNING Will Robertson! Here is a stupid fool read to speak!

I am looking for someone that is willing to look over my networking
files. I can not get these working properly for some reason. What they
are for is my LAN and very near future PPP dial-up account. I want all
my machines to be able to go to the net. I want to take this M$DOG
machine offline!

Right now I can ping any of the machines on my network, but that is a
natural with host files installed on each machine. I have installed
RH5.2 and I definately have a problem with my DNS... Sendmail takes
forever to post the mail. NSLOOKUP doesn't seem to work. I haven't
been able to figure out how to get the YPBINDPROC_DOMAIN to bind to
the domain. The DNS server doesn't seem to be working at all...

I have sent all my files to one of the other list members to look over
and he can't find what I have done to make this server not work
properly. I am actually looking for some BIGTIME help here...

The machine is going to be used for serving my LAN and internet needs
for the LAN... At some point I will be getting ADSL here and want it
basically setup for that moment even though I am going through DSL
HELL right now! Is there any takers on this project??? I don't need to
be told to RTFM either! I have and someplace the brain has given up
and turned into gray jello...

ANY TAKERS???

Thanks for atleast reading...
Frank
