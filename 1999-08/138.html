it shoudn't. the DNS problems your having are a system configuration
problem, not a kernel/module problem.

of course, more info is needed to solve the DNS probs. I/We need your
setup info like:
	redhat version
	are you on a corporate LAN (with existing DNS servers & gateways)
	private LAN (where you are going to be the DNS)
	standalone machine
