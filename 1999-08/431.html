Hi.... couple of thoughts....
1. check /dev/cdrom & see if its still linked to /dev/hdc or whatever
2. try modprobe cdrom
3. u haven't rebuilt the kernel have you and left out cdrom support ??? :)
4. Perhaps you may have dislodged a card in one of the slots?? Does the cdrom led come on..is their noise from
the cdrom???
5. Perhaps you accidently dislodged a cable to your cdrom?? As above :)

Anyway, there the things I would be checking..
1 other thing..SOMETIMES, one of my 40x cdroms throws similar errors if I boot up linux without a cd in the
drive!!  I then have to insert a cd & then reboot linux if I want to access the cd!

&gt; I had my CDROM working until 8 AM this morning. All I did was changed my video card and closed the
&gt; box. At bootup time, the CDROM drive did not get mounted.
&gt;
&gt; I tried to manually mount the drive,
&gt;
&gt; $ mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /cdrom
&gt; mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/cdrom as a block device
&gt;        (maybe 'insmod driver'?)
&gt;
&gt; That is the message, I get now.
&gt;
&gt; Then, I inserted a audio CD, and xmcd does not play it. I am using OSS driver ( and did turn on the driver ).
&gt;
&gt; The "eject" command says
&gt; eject: open failed for '/dev/hdc': No such device
&gt;
&gt; Did not know changing video card was so dangerous ;-)
&gt;
&gt; I would appreciate any help. The video card a XFConfig work great, but now I want my CD to work.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you for any help.
