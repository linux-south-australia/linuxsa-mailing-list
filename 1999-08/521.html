DAVID 1					HAL 0

&lt;evil grin&gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  It's stupid UNIX purist rubbish like
&gt; &gt;&gt; this that is keeping Linux off desktops.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;UNIX purist rubbish like what? UNIX has never liked automounting any
&gt; &gt;particular device. In the past there have been very real reasons for
&gt; &gt;this practice - imagine the chaos that could occur if anyone
&gt; &gt;(maliciously or otherwise) unmounted the root partition on a 600 user
&gt; &gt;UNIX system.
&gt; 
&gt; Stupid UNIx purist rubbish like having a CDROM and a floppy drive and
&gt; leaving them unmounted...

There's two ways to debate this point:

1) THE ABSURD

Even Windows doesn't leave them mounted ALL the time. Is Windows such a
wonderful system it automounts floppies BEFORE they're in the drive?

2) THE SENSIBLE

Unix is about choice (as always). And some choose to have an automounter
automount them. See my score above...however for those who don't, here
are the various options:

 a) Mount it in normal place with the default filesystem (ext2 for my
floppy and iso9660 for my CD)

NOTES: Windows does this very well. Most of the time it also gets it
right, except of course it doesn't cope with ext2 at all well.

  b) Mount it somewhere else with the default filesystem...in fact
ANYWHERE in my directory tree

NOTE: Windows is DREADFUL at this. Firstly you can't easily put it into
the directory structure (you can map it using the map command in File
Manager if it exists), and even then it's not altogether obvious how. In
addition, assigning a drive a different (non default) letter isn't
altogether too obvious either.

If some misbehaved program decides that the CD is on drive G: for
example, mapping that in Windows is a nightmare. If a unix program
decides that the CD should be mounted at /halu/halu/nonsensemountpoint
making a symbolic link to the real mount point is a cinch!

  c) Mount it in the normal or somewhere else with whatever filesystem
my kernel / modules support...try that one with 

NOTE: Windows hates most other non-microsoft file systems. Need I say
more? If the Windows automounter doesn't like the file system on the
partition or floppy or cd  you tend to be a lithe stuffed. Linux and
unix aren't like that. Linux at least supports most file systems
especially re: development kernels.

&gt; &gt;On the other hand, Windows has always used an automount system of sorts.
&gt; &gt;This makes it easier for users to use and also makes explaining
&gt; &gt;computers quite easy. Windows has always aimed at making things easy -
&gt; &gt;if a little dangerous - for all users.
&gt; 
&gt; How dangerous is accessing a CDROM?  Never done me any harm!

Well, again two answers:-

1) THE ABSURD

I actually BROKE my CDROM loading one in. I slipped and hit the tray
really hard. Luckily I didn't have to fix it.

2) THE SENSIBLE

I might not WANT people to use the cd drive, or I might WANT them to use
only one particular CD. If they can't unmount what I've mounted this is
impossible. Whilst I acknowledge it's a small overhead, writing scripts
such as:

#! /bin/bash
mount /mnt/cdrom
cd /mnt/cdrom

Can make mounting even easier!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;There are benefits in both of these approaches. I don't like to mount
&gt; &gt;all my partitions automatically, especially my floppy drive and cd
&gt; &gt;drive. This is primarily to protect me from myself, but it also makes it
&gt; &gt;very difficult for hackers or my friends as I've stated before to stuff
&gt; &gt;my system up or accidentally load a virus onto it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd much prefer to save time and be a little less paranoid myself.

Until you've learned what it's like to go through a huge document recall
(I'm on numerous committees and such and lost all my correspondence out
once and had to actually get people to resend it in paper to me) then
you can feel less paranoid.

Now, even if I accidentally do do a rm -rf / I can rearrange and still
get a working system up and DON'T lose my documents.

&gt; 
&gt; In all the years I've been into computing, my PC has never had a virus.
&gt; Personally I think viruses are the least of anyones worries.


YOU have been lucky. There are many users out there who have gotten
them, both corporate and small. They can be VERY damaging.

&gt; Also, I think if someone could hack anything on your system they could
&gt; probably mount a drive too!

This much is true, but why make things easy for them?

&gt; 
&gt; I could probably see the point of doing it with a Windows or other OSes
&gt; partition, which I do (to avoid a rm -rf /* taking out both partitions -
&gt; another stupid UNIX thing), but I still mount read-only!!!

Another stupid Unix thing&gt;? HANG ON.

I have always conceptualised it like this:

Windows lets you do absolutely EVERYTHING. Consequently at every step it
asks you "are you sure this?", "are you sure that?"....additionally you
can very easily bugger a windows system up if you don't know exactly
what you're trying to achieve.

I find all these "what ifs" and stuff [read CRAP] really annoying and
patronising. If I have said empty the trash I expect the computer to
empty the trash without demur. If I'm not supposed to empty the trash I
expect it not even to GIVE me the option. 

UNIX has always had an administrator (root) around. On a big system this
person is a separate entity or even group of people. However, ROOT is
supposed to give the user as much access as needed and that's it. So the
user doesn't need to worry too much about whether he/she can do this, or
that. If the user can't it won't allow the user to do it. 

Consequently, I have set up a second account on my system. I'm very
confident in doing everything very quickly on that account because the
only data I stuff up is my own. I can't wipe systems partitions, I can't
rm -rf /, I can't do a lot of things. I have protected myself totally
because I literally am not capable without su-ing or relogging of
stuffing up.

I personally prefer this approach. It's not patronising, effective and
to me more organised.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Linux has the best approach. Linux allows one to choose and installs the
&gt; &gt;SAFEST approach (no automount) first.
&gt; 
&gt; The SAFEST approach is wearing a helmet down the street in case you get hit
&gt; by a bus!

Your analogy is INVALID. You are comparing something which I consider
quite normal and middle-of-the-road and accepted by the linux community
- reliability above performance tradeoffs - with an extreme from an
unrelated subject.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;  The logon prompt
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Windows NT has a logon prompt and NT users seem to be able to understand
&gt; &gt;it.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence nobody buys NT for their home.  Home users don't want to have to
&gt; logon, when you're not connected to a network, with network resources.
&gt; There's no point in having to logon in that situation.
&gt; 

Tell that to my friends. Any logic text book will say that a category A
proposition (nobody buys x....all y is z) can be destroyed categorically
by one example. I am prepared to sign a statutory declaration pursuant
to the Statutory Declarations Act (Federal) 1959 stating that Mr Paul
O'Brien does use NT for his home use and does use the login prompt.

I also believes that he uses NT's better, although not terribly good,
file protection systems analogously to my use of Linux; i.e. his user
account can't suddenly wipe the c:/windows off the system.

I have already explained the point of having multiple user accounts.
Please take note that I have not said that having only one (presumably
root) account is invalid...

DAVID 2					HAL 0


&gt; &gt;Logon prompts are an integral part of any system and once users
&gt; &gt;understand the extra protection multiple accounts can have they normally
&gt; &gt;quite agree. In addition, it's added protection against people hacking
&gt; &gt;into your account.
&gt; 
&gt; PC == PERSONAL Computer... having multiple accounts on your PC aint very
&gt; personal!  It's pointless!
&gt; 

See above. It is quite normal to think of a person in different roles:
for example you might be a father to your son, prime minister to
Australia. Do you see the analogy? What is appropriate as father may not
be appropriate as PM but they are still both VALID.

&gt; &gt;&gt; a home directory based filesystem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There is nothing stopping any user from working out how to avoid the
&gt; &gt;home directory based file system. You simply make / itself the home
&gt; &gt;directory and chmod recursively everything to +rwx. Having a home
&gt; &gt;directory has stopped me from making my drive look like a dogs dinner
&gt; &gt;(like my old windows partition used to).
&gt; 
&gt; You could get some organisational skills instead.  My Windows partition
&gt; looks fine!

I agree with this to a certain extent but I have another friend who
simply puts EVERYTHING on the desktop. Talk about messy. My point was
that my home directory now looks quite organised...nothing more and
nothing less. I am certainly not going to imply anything about yours or
the equivalent thereof.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;This will force all users (desktop or otherwise) to actually think about
&gt; &gt;how they organise their own directories.
&gt; 
&gt; If they can't keep a drive clean, what makes you think they'll keep a
&gt; directory clean?

They can't suddenly unarrange a whole system underneath someone's feet.
At least one can confine their mess to their directory.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;It also stops them from prying
&gt; &gt;into other directories. Recently, I had a trojan horse which essentially
&gt; &gt;attempted to wipe the first partition it landed on off. It managed to
&gt; &gt;zap my /home and somehow managed to rearrange /usr a little, but my
&gt; &gt;system was recoverable.
&gt; 
&gt; And neither your home dirs, unmounted filesystems or any other paranoia
&gt; stopped it!!!

It did actually stop it. My system still ran, it's just that my /home
superblock was a little crazy. My point is still valid here...it only
affected (and only superficially) what my user account could affect. I
could still relog as root and have a perfectly working system.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;What is wrong with making order out of chaos?
&gt; 
&gt; What's wrong with not creating chaos in the first place?
&gt; 

That is not an answer to my question, now was it implied in my question.
In fact, it's an invalid reply. 

SYNTAX ERROR.

&gt; &gt;&gt; To become a true desktop GUI Linux needs to pull away from its multiuser
&gt; &gt;&gt; past a little.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;People need to understand that linux is a much more powerful operating
&gt; &gt;system (in some respects if not all) than Windows. Complexity is the
&gt; &gt;trade-off to a certain extent.
&gt; 
&gt; That's a first-class cop-out.  Just because it IS like that, it doesn't
&gt; mean it HAS to be...

Your point is quite valid. In fact it is very valid, but it doesn't
refute what I say at all. You have not disproven what I said.

&gt; 
&gt; What people need to understand, is that Linux is young, and needs to be
&gt; helped in the right direction, ie.  Away from the paradigm of an OS built
&gt; decades ago for dumb terminals connecting to a mainframe.  If it want to
&gt; succeed client-side.

To a certain extent I agree. I believe though that the best of both
worlds should be worked into a coherent system.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Nonetheless, tools like
&gt; &gt;linuxconf/netcfg/suseconfig are now appearing to help users along. GNOME
&gt; &gt;and KDE (more so KDE) come with a whole suite of GUI tools to ease the
&gt; &gt;administration of the system.

&gt; &gt;Nonetheless, using these tools can make one's system a black box.
&gt; &gt;Something that works but one doesn't understand. It's not necessarily a
&gt; &gt;good thing to work with. Black box tools can make the system work, but
&gt; &gt;whether they do that well or efficiently is another question.
&gt; 
&gt; A computer is a tool.  I don't need to know how to service my circular saw
&gt; to build a fence!
&gt; 

Yes, a computer is a tool. I did not SAY that you couldn't or it was
invalid to use these tools (that I term black box) for one's system. I
said that they don't necessarily provide one with the most efficient
system and that [in my opinion] this isn't a good thing. Again, you have
singularly failed to refute what I said.

&gt; &gt;Linux offers people a choice Windows does not. I am not prepared to
&gt; &gt;allow linux become a closed, black box system simply to satisfy the
&gt; &gt;masses. Linux can still be a fantastically powerful, useful, multi-user
&gt; &gt;operating system as well as being able to be operated via the black box.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not prepared to let you kill any chances Linux has of becoming a great
&gt; Desktop OS just to satisfy your paranoia!
&gt; 

"LINUX CAN STILL BE A FANTASTICALLY POWERFUL, USEFUL, MULTI-USER,
OPERATING SYSTEM AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO BE OPERATED VIA THE BLACK BOX"

I don't think we disagree with each other here at all. Your statement
does not follow at all or address at all what I am saying. My statement
says that I'm not going to allow linux to become a closed, black box
system simply to satisfy the masses....yours says that you are not
prepared to kill any hances Linux has of becoming a great Desktop OS
just to satisfy your paranoia.

These statements, I argue, can both be true. Simply because it's not a
black box system doesn't mean that there are no chances of linux
becoming a great Desktop OS. Nor does becoming a great desktop OS imply
that it has to be a black box.

&gt; &gt;I simply would like to say that Linux is much more configurable via the
&gt; &gt;text configuration files, but that more and more tools are being made to
&gt; &gt;help people write these files without having to know how. I think a
&gt; &gt;balance can be made between the two.
&gt; 
&gt; As long as the config files remain underneath the GUI tools, there will be!

I am sure that you are correct; your statement supports mine.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;For such balance we need to rely on KDE, GNOME, SusE, RedHat to name a
&gt; &gt;few. We need to rely on each other as well. UNIX is not hampered by its
&gt; &gt;multi-user past...this is one of its strengths and as time goes by our
&gt; &gt;computers may once again become part of a permanent, all the time up
&gt; &gt;network connection. And this is essentially what UNIX has always
&gt; &gt;supported.
&gt; 
&gt; UNIX on the desktop, in the houses of the masses is hampered by every
&gt; obstacle you put in front of them!
&gt; 

SYSTEM X [substitute unix, linux, windows, windows nt, windows CE, Mac
OS, OS/2, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, cp/m ms-dos] in the houses of the masses is
hampered by every obstacle you put in front of them. 

You either imply that what I said in the previous paragraph contains
some definition of an obstacle - I have pointed out a strength (i.e. non
obstacle, something which helps overcome obstacles). If you were to
accept my last paragraph at face value, what you are saying is that an
obstacle hampers the progress of anything.

Obstacles do hamper things....that is their very definition.

However, if you don't accept what I have said, this statement implies
that what I argue for is an obstacle. Throughout this reply I have
indicated a number of fallacies within your argument. Therefore on that
night, I shall send this off!
