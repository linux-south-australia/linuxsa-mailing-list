&gt;Question:
&gt;
&gt;Are there tools to block-wide copy one hard disk to another?

Alan,

dd(1) is one tool that would do what you are asking

eg
	$&gt; dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/dev/hdb1
	# assuming that hdb1 is no smaller than hda1

&gt;Case 1:
&gt;A 2 MB linux disk which I would like to "move" to a 4 or 13 GB disk.
&gt;I imagine a problem here is that I need superblocks (or whatever)
&gt;all the way over the new disk. I.e. it needs to have "fdisk" run over it
&gt;to get the basic file system in there.

"fdisk" is used to set up the partitions.  My I suggest mkfs is what
you meant.  mkfs will lay down the file system including those 
superblocks.  There was an excellent description of filesysetems
on this list a while back.

&gt;I imagine that I need to run lilo over the new disk,
&gt;because the exacty physical locations of boot files
&gt;etc. will change.
Correct!

&gt;Another question:
&gt;Suppose I just use two "tar" processes back-to-back
&gt;over a pipe via "rsh" to copy all files from
&gt;disk 1 to disk 2. Would I lose anything apart
&gt;from the boot sector?
&gt;In other words, if I copy all files by tarring,
&gt;and if I create a new boot sector, should the new
&gt;disk work just the same when I try to boot it?

This method is safer (IMHO).  You would create the file system
with mkfs, then use tar (or cpio) with the options that would
preserve modification times and ownership - very important.

There is something that could be lost if you didn't do the mkfs
step: the lost+found directory.  Although it appears to be
just an empty directory, it acutally contains some unused
i-nodes that fsck can attach lost files to.
