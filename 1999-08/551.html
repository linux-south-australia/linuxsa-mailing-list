Hi all

I have a minute problem someone may
have come accross before.

I have a Linux Box(acts as the server) networked to a Windows/Linux box.

A simple network.

However, whenever I want to connect to the Linux box from the Win box,
I have to dial up first. Once dialed up all is ok and I the machines can
talk.

Note: I only have to dial up once....then I can disconnect and the
machines
           will still talk(ie I can log on and off...all is ok).

Note again: If I haven't dialed up and I attempt to talk to the Win box,
the machines
                      do somewhat talk  but do not give me a login
prompt etc,
                      and then time out.

Obviously when I shutdown I have to dial up again to get the machines
talking.

However this is an expensive exercise(especially when I only want to
transfer  a few files
 accross whilst doing assignments).

It seems that connecting to the Internet results in addressing being
resolved......but
It is annoying(and expensive) dialing up just to talk to a machine 2
metres away from me.

Any suggestions, ideas, comments, pointers, would be extremely
appreciated.

Thanx

Alex
