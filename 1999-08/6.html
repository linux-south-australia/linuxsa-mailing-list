Thanks for you replies to my VMware questions I hadn't realised that there
was a demo available, 
Just a summary of my installation for those interested. 
The software can be downloaded at
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/download/download.html">http://www.vmware.com/download/download.html</A> you are then required to
register then a return email is posted with a licence file that you place
into the directory from which the vmware binary is run. You then start
vmware and create a config file including all your hardware choices
and you can then start the VM and use a dos boot disk in the VM window to
fdisk and format your partition
Which seemed fairly idiot proof as I still have all my existing partitions
phew!
Then you go ahead and install your OS, in my case WIN95, after that I
installed the VMware tools which provided a vmware display driver, It was
then running like a dream I haven't installed any other programs to this
partition as yet, but I am already happy with the results. It almost
seemlessly intergrates into my Gnome/Enlightenment desktop so much so that I
can move my mouse over the edge of the VM window from Gnome to the VM and
hardly notice any difference I can then execute any icon in Windows..

A couple of bad points were; I couldn't work out how to use an already
created Fat16 partition and I also had trouble with the licence file, it had
expired before the first time I used it. I think that this is because the
difference in US mm/dd/yyy format and ours, so 28/7/1999 was read as
7/28/1999 I logged this error with vmware and they soon replied with this.

Hi Neil,

Sorry to hear you are having a problem.  Our records show that you
downloaded the evaluation license 28 June, with an expiration of 28 July.
You can download another license at
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/download/download.html.">http://www.vmware.com/download/download.html.</A>  

I am closing this incident.  If the problem persists, please file a new one,
and reference incident number 4181 in the problem description field.  BTW,
we have not had a single report (other than yours) of date format issues
with the license.

Thank you for your time and interest in VMware.
 
Which I thought was a bit of a brush off, hey but at least they replied.
Anyway to get around the problem till that is resolved I have date -s
1/1/1999. Which is OK for my current system but not an option in a
production environment.

&gt; 
&gt; You can also use VMWare to run windows instaled on an existing partition.
&gt; 
&gt; This allows the following 'problem'..
&gt; If you set VMWare to boot from your Linux/Windows partitioned hadware
&gt; it will loyally start lilo (wow!) and then if not caught in time, will
&gt; start to
&gt; boot the default OS, linux (isn't it for everyone?) which will then crash
&gt; your
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; The documentation warns about trying to run VMWare inside of
&gt; VMWare.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also the lesser problem of getting the screen resolution etc.
&gt; to work in both as you need different drivers.. but thats a windows
&gt; profile problem (and another prompt at the windows boot!)

&gt; &gt; Vmware is very handy Small Office/Business tool. Once set up Win98 will
&gt; &gt; run easily as well as it does on its own Hard Drive. And it runs windows
&gt; &gt; apps just as well. A system with a lot of grunt is needed. My 233mzP11
&gt; &gt; and 128mg ram is very slow. Once you have allocated space on your disk
&gt; &gt; (setup asks for 1 Gig) it will need to be formatted (a bit hairy).
&gt; &gt; Vmware prefer an upgraded X server to be used (available at their web
&gt; &gt; site). Install this first. While running it will use approx half your
&gt; &gt; ram, but this can be adjusted. -Good product.
