<PRE>
I have an Exabyte EXB8200 (8mm, 2.3 Gbyte) tape drive which isn't very
happy (it's been getting serviced somewhere for quite a long time;  last
I heard it was aborting transfers with write errors, which it certainly
wasn't doing when I dropped it off :-/  Unfortunately the servicing of
the unit is part of a contra deal, so I can't really expect them to pay
large gobs of money to fix it even though they're probably the ones who
have broken it...)

Before I work out whether I'm going to pick it up in its not-quite-working
state and take it somewhere else, I want to know whether it's going to
be cheaper to turf it and get a DDS drive than it will be to get the
Exabyte fixed.  Does anyone around here know (a) places in Adelaide
which professionally service and repair Exabyte drives, and (b)
approxmations of how expensive spare parts are likely to be?

Additionally, if anyone knows of "trade-in your old tape drive to get a 
new one for only slightly more than zero dollars" type deals I'd be
interested to hear about that too.

Thanks,

   - mark

       and back his system up on the server at work over his 56k link :-) ]

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
