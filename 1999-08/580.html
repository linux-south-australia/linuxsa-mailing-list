&gt; LinuxSA persons interested in linux distributions:
&gt;
&gt; After some discussions here about "what is the best linux distribution",
&gt; I thought I'd just jot down a couple of notes on my
&gt; first experiences with SuSE 6.2.
&gt; This "jotting" experience has just taken 17 hours out of my life!
&gt; Here's my little first-impressions review.
&gt; (Now I know why people get paid to do this sort of thing!)
&gt;
&gt; My motivations in getting SuSE were:
&gt;
&gt; 1.      To try to break the RedHat monopoly.

What RedHat monopoly, people have _choice_ of which distribution they use.
People _choose_ to use RedHat.
The recent sentiment that RH is becoming the "Microsoft of linux" is
rubbish.
The moment RedHat made a big showing, suddenly, it was not _alternative_
enough.
Perhaps instead of SuSe you could try HURD.
There was a time when many linux people dreamed of linux on every desktop
on every pc. RedHat has done

&gt;
&gt; 2.      To get a better linux distribution, with more stuff on it.

By this logic, for RedHat to be a better distribution it simply needs
to have more stuff packaged with it?

&gt;
&gt; 3.      To get support for my nVidia RIVA TNT2 card (and a
&gt;  cugh. Some of the explanation are very clear though.
&gt;

While I am not sure of the status of support for these cards, it does
serve as a good point for how RedHat develop drivers for linux.
The case of the i740 chipset for which many linux users needed
was looking grim as hardware manufacturers had not released
a linux driver, so, RedHat paid for the development of a driver for it.
The benifits of this flowed to all the linux community, not just redhat.
The job of creating drivers for any sort of hardware is the responsibility
of the manufacturer, not the OS vendor. If  a card is not supported then
do not buy it.

Food for thought

Kevin
