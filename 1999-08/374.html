&gt; &gt; Last night I did a traceroute from my IP, which is a dialup IP, to
&gt; &gt; another guy's dialup IP. Nothing remarkable there. It tooks 15 or 16
&gt; &gt; hops. However, at about hop 13, the IP was reported as 192.168.0.174
&gt; &gt; (with ping times of about ~400-500 ms, which was in keeping with ones
&gt; &gt; either side of it).
&gt; &gt; Now, I was under the impression that 192.168.xx.xx was a 'private' IP
&gt; &gt; range, and as such shouldn't be appearing in internet traceroutes
&gt; &gt; between two commercial ISPs?
&gt; 
&gt; Why waste vailiable IP numbers on interfaces which are never going to
&gt; provide services.
I don't know if that's really valid though - sure, I can understand you
don't want to waste IPs, but if you're a medium sized ISP you could
surely afford to give your routing boxes and gateways a single IP each?
I can understand that if you were an ISP, then maybe you'd give the
office PCs your  staff use for word processing non-internet IPs, but a
machine acting as a router seems rather dangerous.
For instance, some places have internal 192.168.x.x networks, and so
place a rule on their firewall to block any data from or to those IPs
from going in or out of their internet gateway. Thus, that router on
that ISPs network would appear to be unreachable.
Or, what if someone nearby to that router assigned that IP to their box?
ARP tables would get pretty confused, I mean, imagine how you would feel
if you assigned a private IP address to your box, and then started
receiving all the traffic destined for the rest of the ISP?

I guess that it does actually 'work' as seen by the fact I was able to
communicate with someone on the other side of the box, but it still
seems pretty odd. I'm surprised that it did.
