David

The reason I prefer the $(...) form of command substitution is
I find the syntax more explicit, easier to read and consequently likely
to produce more reliable code than the more ubiquitous but
harder to recognise back-quote. Particularly for long or complex scripts.

Perhaps you were more influenced by APL and me by ALGOL!

I agree that portability is a valid concern and scripts using
shell specific features should be explicit about the shell rather than
rely on an appropriate default.

There are things in your message that I disagree with.
1. The $(...) form of command substitution is not inconsistent with
the #!/bin/sh, and
2. I don't think scripts should be confined to lowest common
denominator syntax other than special cases. 

There is as you know a standard for portability in the "Unix" world
IEEE Std 1003.2 Standard for Information technology -- 
Portable Operating Systems Interface (POSIX)

Every document on this I have read states the POSIX shell standard
for command substitution takes the $() form

Virtually every modern unix variant claims POSIX compliance as
either achieved or an almost achieved goal. For POSIX compliance
/bin/sh must be a POSIX compliant shell. The original
Bourne shell is not POSIX compliant and hence can't be used as the
"default shell" (/bin/sh) in a POSIX compliant system.

Many systems have switched to bash as the default shell as it
is FSF/GNU, strives for full POSIX conformance and is now available on
almost all systems. This is a legitimate way to meet the POSIX
objective. Its adoption in linux distributions has been a well debated
intentional decision not a symptom of slackness as you imply.

In summary:
  for me readability, and the knowledge it is the POSIX standard lead 
  me to now prefer the $() form, over the `` form I used to use

  lowest common denominator portability is a legitimate choice but it's
  not the only "technically correct" choice

Adrian
