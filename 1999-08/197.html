&gt; PLEASE NOTE: the venue has changed (just for this month) since Compaq
&gt; need the room they let us usually have.

The venue is:

  Room 2060 (lecture theatre)
  Computer Science
  Level 2
  Plaza Building
  North Terrace Campus
  The University of Adelaide.

The simplest way to find this is to find the Security Office
on the plaza in the centre of the University.  The Security
Office is clearly marked on all the maps at the entrances
to the University.  Walk past BankSA and enter the Plaza Building
(you should see some displays by the architecture department), walk
down the stairs to level 2 and enter the computer science department
doors.

I'll post up some signs on the plaza -- unfortunately the Uni is too
complex for signage from each of the many entrances.

The best place to park is Victoria Drive, then enter the uni opposite the
footbridge and walk up the stairs to the plaza.

Maps can be found at:

  <A HREF="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/campuses.html">http://www.adelaide.edu.au/campuses.html</A>

The Plaza Building has building code H9 and is at North Terrace
Campus Map coordinate G9.  It can only be entered from the western
side (where the arrow is on the map).

Please e-mail me directly if you need a wheelchair friendly route.


&gt; Thanks to Glen Turner for organising a replacement venue on short
&gt; notice!

Wrong person!  The Computer Science department of the University
of Adelaide are being generous.  They usually charge for the
hire of lecture theatres but are letting us have the facility
for free as long as we are out by 9:50pm.

Tea and coffee will be on me.
