I agree - I'd go with a Real modem over a winmodem any day, but bad moves
are afoot. 

Our hardware suppliers ( and we are in contact with a fair number) are
starting to swing exclusively towards Winmodems for internal modems. Bugger
I say. 

This means external (better anyway) modems will whats left.

In addition lin-modem drivers would be very useful to make use of some of
the cheaper motherboards with built in modems.

Pctel have responded that whilst they have publically announced that they
are introducing linux support for winmodems (and mention shipping kits to
OEM's in their news flash) have nothing concrete in the form of drivers as
yet. (Typical - Marketing supplies the hype - nothing but hot air and
nothing to support their claims)

Ps: Lets see if this turns out to be another netscape killer :(

a

Maybe winmodem's aren't taking under windows. It would be nice if they
would run under linux. Then at least we would get a true indication of how
cpu hungry they are.

Also what about the fact they have no buffer ram? They use main memory.
Hence if your cpu & ram is very busy (say rendering a huge scene in 3dsmax
whilst you play quake 3) then the modem will be forced to wait for a space
cpu cycle. 

What if I am just on the edge of needing swap space? A few more bytes come
in from the modem & wham, disk swapping aplenty.

You can try and make them look sweet but the truth remains winmodems are
simply annonying.

Cheers,
