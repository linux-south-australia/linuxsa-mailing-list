<H1>K6-2/400 CPU; MSI mainboard; linux failure?</H1>

Problem:
I changed my old PC from a P133 on an Intel FX chipset
mainboard to a brand new MSI mainboard
(Micro-Star MS-5184 baby-AT VI14 mainboard with VIA chipset,
128 MB RAM (2 x 64 MB SDRAM DIMMs) and an AMD K6-2/400 CPU.
Result:
My dual-boot wind95 + linux redhat 5.2 machine
became unusable, even after about a week of
hard work and taking it to a shop to get it "fixed".

The windows bit was interesting. I had windows95 A,
which apparently cannot be patched to cope with a
400 MHz K6-2 CPU. So it had to be clocked back to 
300 MHz, and a patch had to be applied to remove 
some sort of "windows access fault" or something.
But it still couldn't get the ethernet card working, and
the floppy drive A: froze, etc. etc.

The linux failed less seriously -- the ethernet card
disappeared (it should have been at address 0x6000
or something, PCI), and the com2 port (/dev/cua1) failed
- basically seemed to just disappear.

Cure:
Chucked out the new mainboard, CPU and RAM, and put back the
old board, cpu and ram.
Result: linux went back to normal.
The PCI ethernet card reappeared at the correct address,
and /dev/cua1 reappeared.
But the wind95 didn't come back. The patch to make the
OS cope with the K6-2 chip now caused the same
windows exception with the P133 as the unpatched
version with the K6-2/400.

My point:
This is all hideously messy.
I've just lost a week out of my life (and learned
heaps about the wiring inside a PC) because
this AMD hardware and VIA-based mainboard don't seem
to work well with either linux or wind95.

Question:
I never cared about this before.
But now I'd like to know:
Should one avoid the AMD chips?
Or more precisely, should dabblers like myself
avoid AMD chips?

I read an old Computer Shopper article about
compatibility problems of AMD chips with video
cards, and this starts to make me think that
one should just avoid them. I've also heard that their
shares are going down because their product is
not much good.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
