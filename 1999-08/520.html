Just a quick correction, Solaris and SunOS have automountd and have had it
for quite awhile.

&gt; [FROM ORIGINAL MESSSAGE]
&gt;
&gt; Well,
&gt;
&gt; To add fuel to this debate.  IMHO not having automount is one of the
&gt; most
&gt; primitive aspects of Linux to date.  It's stupid UNIX purist rubbish
&gt; like
&gt; this that is keeping Linux off desktops.  This, the logon prompt, and to
&gt; a
&gt; lesser extent a home directory based filesystem.
&gt;
&gt; To become a true desktop GUI Linux needs to pull away from its multiuser
&gt; past a little.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  It is one of the annoying things about *nix
&gt; &gt;&gt; that it cannot get it's act together and automount anything without a
big
&gt; &gt;&gt; stick and a thump on the keyboard, the whole (un)mount(ing) idea is
bl**dy
&gt; &gt;&gt; stupid.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I disagree wholeheartedly. One of the things I hate about Windows and
&gt; &gt;Microsoft is that they automount everything. I can safely let my friends
&gt; &gt;muck around with my machine in the knowledge that they can't even mount
&gt; &gt;my own partition (where I keep my private) stuff, destroy it or anything
&gt; &gt;silly like that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Besides, there is support for an automounter in the newer kernels. It
&gt; &gt;does exist, it's just that there are good reasons that automojnt doesn't
&gt; &gt;exist in most unixen.

&gt; [RESENT MESSAGE WITH MY REPLY]
&gt;
&gt; Hal:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; To add fuel to this debate.
&gt;
&gt; I enjoy debates. If this hasn't been noticed before, then one gets used
&gt; to it. Please note that my opinions are never humble; they are mine and
&gt; I will defend them.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt; not having automount is one of the most
&gt; &gt; primitive aspects of Linux to date.
&gt;
&gt; TOMOUNT(8)                                         AUTOMOUNT(8)
&gt;
&gt; NAME
&gt;        automount - configure mount points for autofs
&gt;
&gt; SYNOPSIS
&gt;        automount   [options]  mount-point  map-type[,format]  map
&gt;        [map-options]
&gt;
&gt; DESCRIPTION
&gt;        The automount program is used to configure a  mount  point
&gt;        for  autofs,  the  inlined  Linux  automounter.  automount
&gt;        works by taking a base mount-point and map file, and using
&gt;        these (combined with other options) to automatically mount
&gt;        file systems within the  base  mount-point  when  they  are
&gt;        accessed  in  any  way.   The file systems are then autoun-
&gt;        mounted after a period of inactivity.
&gt;
&gt; That is a man page from RedHat 6.0 using kernel 2.2.5-15. In my CORRECT
&gt; opinion Linux does have and can be configured to automount. Although I
&gt; am not certain how to use this [I don't use automount and I don't
&gt; particularly like it], there's no reason why it can't be used or
&gt; kickstarted to set up.
&gt;
&gt; Many linux users obviously haven't contacted RedHat or SuSe et al and
&gt; asked them to include such an option. Is it such a pity that they, too,
&gt; are driven by market forces and don't automatically install items users
&gt; don't want?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  It's stupid UNIX purist rubbish like
&gt; &gt; this that is keeping Linux off desktops.
&gt;
&gt; UNIX purist rubbish like what? UNIX has never liked automounting any
&gt; particular device. In the past there have been very real reasons for
&gt; this practice - imagine the chaos that could occur if anyone
&gt; (maliciously or otherwise) unmounted the root partition on a 600 user
&gt; UNIX system.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, Windows has always used an automount system of sorts.
&gt; This makes it easier for users to use and also makes explaining
&gt; computers quite easy. Windows has always aimed at making things easy -
&gt; if a little dangerous - for all users.
&gt;
&gt; There are benefits in both of these approaches. I don't like to mount
&gt; all my partitions automatically, especially my floppy drive and cd
&gt; drive. This is primarily to protect me from myself, but it also makes it
&gt; very difficult for hackers or my friends as I've stated before to stuff
&gt; my system up or accidentally load a virus onto it.
&gt;
&gt; Linux has the best approach. Linux allows one to choose and installs the
&gt; SAFEST approach (no automount) first.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  The logon prompt
&gt;
&gt; Windows NT has a logon prompt and NT users seem to be able to understand
&gt; it. Logon prompts are an integral part of any system and once users
&gt; understand the extra protection multiple accounts can have they normally
&gt; quite agree. In addition, it's added protection against people hacking
&gt; into your account.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; a home directory based filesystem.
&gt;
&gt; There is nothing stopping any user from working out how to avoid the
&gt; home directory based file system. You simply make / itself the home
&gt; directory and chmod recursively everything to +rwx. Having a home
&gt; directory has stopped me from making my drive look like a dogs dinner
&gt; (like my old windows partition used to).
&gt;
&gt; This will force all users (desktop or otherwise) to actually think about
&gt; how they organise their own directories. It also stops them from prying
&gt; into other directories. Recently, I had a trojan horse which essentially
&gt; attempted to wipe the first partition it landed on off. It managed to
&gt; zap my /home and somehow managed to rearrange /usr a little, but my
&gt; system was recoverable.
&gt;
&gt; What is wrong with making order out of chaos?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; To become a true desktop GUI Linux needs to pull away from its multiuser
&gt; &gt; past a little.
&gt;
&gt; People need to understand that linux is a much more powerful operating
&gt; system (in some respects if not all) than Windows. Complexity is the
&gt; trade-off to a certain extent. Nonetheless, tools like
&gt; linuxconf/netcfg/suseconfig are now appearing to help users along. GNOME
&gt; and KDE (more so KDE) come with a whole suite of GUI tools to ease the
&gt; administration of the system.
&gt;
&gt; Nonetheless, using these tools can make one's system a black box.
&gt; Something that works but one doesn't understand. It's not necessarily a
&gt; good thing to work with. Black box tools can make the system work, but
&gt; whether they do that well or efficiently is another question.
&gt;
&gt; Linux offers people a choice Windows does not. I am not prepared to
&gt; allow linux become a closed, black box system simply to satisfy the
&gt; masses. Linux can still be a fantastically powerful, useful, multi-user
&gt; operating system as well as being able to be operated via the black box.
&gt;
&gt; I simply would like to say that Linux is much more configurable via the
&gt; text configuration files, but that more and more tools are being made to
&gt; help people write these files without having to know how. I think a
&gt; balance can be made between the two.
&gt;
&gt; For such balance we need to rely on KDE, GNOME, SusE, RedHat to name a
&gt; few. We need to rely on each other as well. UNIX is not hampered by its
&gt; multi-user past...this is one of its strengths and as time goes by our
&gt; computers may once again become part of a permanent, all the time up
&gt; network connection. And this is essentially what UNIX has always
&gt; supported.
