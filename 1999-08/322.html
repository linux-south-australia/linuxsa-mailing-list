Recently, perhaps it was 19/8/1999 12:54 PM +0930, e-quoth David Newall:

&gt;Tried it, it was rubbish.  In my considerable experience the best place to
&gt;learn about programming is in your own home, with your own computer.  Get
&gt;a book, read it, and try out each language feature as you go.

I completely disagree: that is the "old way". I agree that you can do all 
of the above, and succeed, but some people actually learn things at Uni. 
:-)

I went back at age 26, and got a lot out of a Comp Sci degree. Surely, to 
disprove such a sweeping statement I need only give one counter-example.
&gt;
&gt;University never struck me as able to provide much more than facilities
&gt;and projects.  Projects, such as "write a quicksort routine", are important
&gt;but honestly, if you need somebody else to tell you what to do then you
&gt;should admit defeat and give up now.  Facilities used to be valuable but
&gt;I think the most of us can probably do better by ourselves.  I think a
&gt;brand new Cyrix 300MX with 32MB RAM, 4GB disk, 17" monitor, good internet
&gt;connectivity, and Linux, at a cost of about $1100 plus internet, is very
&gt;much better than the crappy old gear that the universities can afford.

Which side of bed did you get out of? ;-)

BTW, I learnt heaps from those I *met* at Uni.
&gt;
&gt;The "hard" part of programming, which involves a certain logical bent of
&gt;mind, is not something which anybody can really teach.  You can explain
&gt;it, 

Lots of things can be explained: that is what education is all about. 
Pretending a Uni/TAFE course should be a "be all and end all" is 
unrealistic. But how else could one gain exposure to so many different 
concepts that are at the periphery of "real programming": by staying at 
home with a PC?

Software development is not *only* about *writing* code. Or is that 
different from "Programmimg" (sic) ? ;-)

&gt;but, well it's rather like the Nordic secret agent who was caught
&gt;spying:  They threw him into the fjords, but he just swam out; so they tied
&gt;weights to his body and threw him back; but he floated.  So they pulled
&gt;him out, put concrete around his legs and threw him back in.  He went down,
&gt;hit the bottom, the concrete broke and he swam away.  What they forgot --
&gt;and this is the bit that's relevant to programming -- is that you can lead
&gt;a norse to water but you can't make him sink.

8-)

Cheers,

Keith
