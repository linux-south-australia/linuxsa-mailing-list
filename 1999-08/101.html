Hi All

I am currently experiencing problems when booting my Linux box
onto which I have just installed kernel version 2.2.10.

On bootup, most system services initialise correctly, but three of them: 
sendmail, SMB services, and NMB services spend much time doing nothing.  It 
appears as though they are simply timing-out after several minutes (perhaps 
3-10 minutes).  When shutting down, my system (Red Hat Linux 6.0) announces 
that shutting down these three services has failed.  After quite a 
substancial period of time, the system does eventually enter user mode and 
give me a login prompt.

Booting with my old kernel 2.2.5-15 (the one shipped with Red Hat 6)
using LiLo also doesn't fix the problem.

I mistakenly rebooted before doing a "make modules ; make modules_install", 
although I did do this as soon as I
received a login.  I assume that this is the source of my problems.

If all three of these are daemons, then I suppose I could simply turn them 
of, but this would not really be useful, as I need SMB.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
