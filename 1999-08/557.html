&gt; Hi Brian et. al,

&gt;
&gt; As an aside, I can say that my fellow workers in the business for which I
&gt; work all agree when Linux is considered.  Everything about Linux is
&gt; appealing except for one thing ..... the documentation assumes prior
&gt; knowledge and appears to be nothing more than Linux/Unix geeks writing for
&gt; Linux/Unix geeks.  The inference is also given that Linux is NOT user
&gt; friendly .. it is still a giant leap back to the 70's unless you have lots
&gt; of time & knowledge to do lots of work with it to get to a point of
&gt; userbility for the 'average' user.
&gt; Not my words .... but of those I work with who stick with M$ coz it is a
&gt; lot easier to configure unto a point of user friendliness.

Something that the linux community doesn't seem to have acknowledged yet is
that the general user of computers, not computer experts, but those who use
them as tools for business (outside of programing, I might add) don't give a
damn about operating systems.  They don't care so long as it is easy to use
and ms know this and probably place the highest  priority on this point.
Lets face it, we don't hear screams of anguish from the general computer
community so ms isn't in trouble yet.  I don't mean this to be ms biased.
What is discouraging to me is the blinked view in the linux community.  It
could be damaging to linux in what I now think is a critical stage in its'
development.  It is good but needs polishing which is the most difficult
stage.  It takes a long time and is the phase where it would receive the most
criticism.
  I would like to see if we can promote creative discussion among this users
group and come up with ideas that would be worth suggesting as a project or
presenting to linux international.  There must be very wide views and ideas
among this group and the least experienced users may even have the best of
them. ;-)


regards
Conrad.
