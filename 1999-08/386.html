&gt; I don't know if that's really valid though - sure, I can understand you
&gt; don't want to waste IPs, but if you're a medium sized ISP you could
&gt; surely afford to give your routing boxes and gateways a single IP each?
&gt; I can understand that if you were an ISP, then maybe you'd give the
&gt; office PCs your  staff use for word processing non-internet IPs, but a
&gt; machine acting as a router seems rather dangerous.
&gt; For instance, some places have internal 192.168.x.x networks, and so
&gt; place a rule on their firewall to block any data from or to those IPs
&gt; from going in or out of their internet gateway. Thus, that router on
&gt; that ISPs network would appear to be unreachable.

Like I said.  Provided their routers don't provide any servies it is
OK.

Remember when you send an IP packet you don't care when it goes as long
as it gets to the end destination.  Similarly for packets you recieve.

&gt; Or, what if someone nearby to that router assigned that IP to their box?
&gt; ARP tables would get pretty confused, I mean, imagine how you would feel
&gt; if you assigned a private IP address to your box, and then started
&gt; receiving all the traffic destined for the rest of the ISP?

You have control over the routing.  Not a problem.  If you don't have
control over the routing then you a screwed in more ways then this.

&gt; I guess that it does actually 'work' as seen by the fact I was able to
&gt; communicate with someone on the other side of the box, but it still
&gt; seems pretty odd. I'm surprised that it did.

Exactly.  It works, it saves them resources and they are a company.
Why wouldn't they do it.

Regards,
Michael
