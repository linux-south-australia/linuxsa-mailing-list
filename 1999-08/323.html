Just a brief comment;
I could code in C, C++ and various varieties of basic, and a little bit
of pascal before I went to uni, in both DOS and Linux. (Although not
very well in Linux.)
At university I was brought into contact with all sorts of unix
machines, and I learned that just because I knew Linux, didn't mean I
knew how to use any unix machine. I was forcibly taught how to use
things from the point of view as a user, not a an all-powerful root
user. I also learnt how to code in C 'properly', instead of my
self-taught style. While admitedly both methods would give the same
result, you've got to admit that if you were like me and self-taught
yourself how to program by reading others' (often dodgy) source  code,
then you can pick up some bad habits.
Even if you don't, you will still probably be coding in a way that is
indecipherable to others. When you are forced to work together with
other people, you start commenting your work better, and you realise how
to make things such that they can be intergrated better.

I'd say that doing a proper course is definately a good idea.
I did 90% of my programming from home on a 486 with redhat 4.0 (and then
4.2, etc..) linux on it, but I knew that I had to make good code that
would still compile and work the same on the uni boxes running ultrix
and solaris. People teaching themselves to code from a book, on their
own machine, will never experience this variety.
However, I learn better from source code and books than I do from a
lecturer, but the combination is best of all.

&gt; &gt;Tried it, it was rubbish.  In my considerable experience the best place to
&gt; &gt;learn about programming is in your own home, with your own computer.  Get
&gt; &gt;a book, read it, and try out each language feature as you go.
&gt; 
&gt; I completely disagree: that is the "old way". I agree that you can do all
&gt; of the above, and succeed, but some people actually learn things at Uni.
&gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I went back at age 26, and got a lot out of a Comp Sci degree. Surely, to
&gt; disprove such a sweeping statement I need only give one counter-example.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;University never struck me as able to provide much more than facilities
&gt; &gt;and projects.  Projects, such as "write a quicksort routine", are important
&gt; &gt;but honestly, if you need somebody else to tell you what to do then you
&gt; &gt;should admit defeat and give up now.  Facilities used to be valuable but
&gt; &gt;I think the most of us can probably do better by ourselves.  I think a
&gt; &gt;brand new Cyrix 300MX with 32MB RAM, 4GB disk, 17" monitor, good internet
&gt; &gt;connectivity, and Linux, at a cost of about $1100 plus internet, is very
&gt; &gt;much better than the crappy old gear that the universities can afford.
&gt; 
&gt; Which side of bed did you get out of? ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW, I learnt heaps from those I *met* at Uni.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The "hard" part of programming, which involves a certain logical bent of
&gt; &gt;mind, is not something which anybody can really teach.  You can explain
&gt; &gt;it,
&gt; 
&gt; Lots of things can be explained: that is what education is all about.
&gt; Pretending a Uni/TAFE course should be a "be all and end all" is
&gt; unrealistic. But how else could one gain exposure to so many different
&gt; concepts that are at the periphery of "real programming": by staying at
&gt; home with a PC?
&gt; 
&gt; Software development is not *only* about *writing* code. Or is that
&gt; different from "Programmimg" (sic) ? ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;but, well it's rather like the Nordic secret agent who was caught
&gt; &gt;spying:  They threw him into the fjords, but he just swam out; so they tied
&gt; &gt;weights to his body and threw him back; but he floated.  So they pulled
&gt; &gt;him out, put concrete around his legs and threw him back in.  He went down,
&gt; &gt;hit the bottom, the concrete broke and he swam away.  What they forgot --
&gt; &gt;and this is the bit that's relevant to programming -- is that you can lead
&gt; &gt;a norse to water but you can't make him sink.
&gt; 
&gt; 8-)
