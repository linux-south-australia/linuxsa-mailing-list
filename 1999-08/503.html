This isn't DOS.  Of course all of physical memory is used.  You
wouldn't want to spend money on memory and not have it doing
something at least marginally useful (even if that is simply
keeping the last few disk blocks you read in memory).

The use of swap *is* a problem, as they indicates that all of
physical memory is being used for useful things.

&gt; It reports that X is using 52 MB which is 174% of my physical memory.

Then you have a problem.  I have:

  SIZE  RSS SHARE STAT  LIB %CPU %MEM   TIME COMMAND
 17644  17M  9052 S       0  0.0 13.7   0:33 netscape
 13192  12M  1608 S       0  0.4 10.3   0:46 X11

Which says that my X uses about 13M of memory in the worst case.
My X server is:

  $ ls -l /etc/X11/X
  lrwxrwxrwx root root /etc/X11/X -&gt; ../../usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_Mach64

&gt; I am also running Netscape Communicator, which I believe may have
&gt; something to do with my problem, top reports SIZE 18548 RSS 8368 %MEM 27.2

The Resident Set Size (or the bits of the program worthwhile keeping
in memory) for Netscape Comminucator for you is 8M and for me is 17M,
but I'm in a unconstrained memory environment so your RSS should be
much less than mine.  Our total SIZEs are abou the same.  So Netscape
looks fine (well, ignoring Netscape's bloat issue).


&gt; Also running XFree86 3.3.4 SVGA (Voodoo Banshee).

Given the huge X size, boot with the VGA16 driver and see
if the problem goes away.  The SVGA driver is new and may
have a memory leak.  Memory leaks usually show themselves
by the SIZE reported by `top' increasing over time, try

   top b d 10 | tee fred

You don't have a huge bitmap root image?
