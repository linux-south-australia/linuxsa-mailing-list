Winmodems" will tax your CPU
Not necessarily true. Ed Schulz, who works for Lucent, had this to say in a
newsgroup reply:
&gt; I was told by somebody that LT Win modem requires a Pentium 133 or higher
speed PC but I only have a Pentium 100 and that's why it is slow
Ed Schulz wrote:
Absolutely untrue. I am connected now using our reference LT Win Modem using
recent production drivers at 48k. This is running on a 486 DX2/66. My mother
runs her LT Win Modem on a 75 MHz Pentium with no problem.

In one lab study, the CPU load of our modem host controller was less than
that of the Windows serial driver handling a standard external modem while
downloading identical files at identical DCE rates. The fear that a well
designed "Win Modem" will tax your precious CPU cycles is simply not true.
There are many variations on the design of WMs, and I'm not familiar with
all of them. Personally, I'm still skeptical enough about WMs that I'd tend
to avoid WMs that are not Lucent-based, but the LT product has me convinced
that Ed's statement above is correct - and, that the Lucent-based product is
"well designed". Note though that many companies make WMs based upon the
Lucent chipset, and they probably aren't all the same in terms of quality
and design.

PS I'm trying hard to get a copy of PC-TEL's Linux winmodem drivers to find
out how awful they really are! 
Let you know how I fare?
