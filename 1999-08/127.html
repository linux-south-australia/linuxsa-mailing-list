Hi Alan

There is nothing special about the 400mhz frequency. I've got two
servers running AMD K6-2 400s, and another two running AMD K6-3 400's
as well as plenty of K6's at other frequencies. They all work
flawlessly.

The two K6-2 400's are identical server configs:
 Tekram MVP3 S7 100Mhz board (VIA chipset)
 2 64MB SDRAM PC100 (128 total)
 Advansys PCI Ultra SCSI
 S3 AGP 4MB
 2 Fujustsu 8.4GB IDE in removable canisters
 (both masters one on primary, other on secondary)
 2 10/100 Surecom PCI NICS
 ATX powersupply in rackmount case

In my experience it is no easier or harder to build AMD or INTEL
systems. It is always easier to build your second system than your
first & tends to get easier the more you do. Every now and then though
you strike a troublesome combination - such are the joys of system
building.

Your problem could be lots of things, particularly if this is your first
build. Each board is different but some common build problems are:
 the dual voltage settings for the processor
 the wrong clock frequency combinations, external/multiplier
 not checking the purpose & setting of EVERY jumper on the M/B
 not disabling unwanted onboard devices (bios or jumper)
 the memory voltage and frequency
 memory not in the right slots (not just where they fit!)
 memory not supported by M/B (there are lots of types)
 plugging the floppy cable in back to front
 inadequate anti static/handling precautions
 a dud/marginal component (commonly Memory)
 BIOS settings
 dodgy power supply

Email me off list if you want a practical hand

Regards
Adrian

&gt; Problem:
&gt; I changed my old PC from a P133 on an Intel FX chipset
&gt; mainboard to a brand new MSI mainboard
&gt; (Micro-Star MS-5184 baby-AT VI14 mainboard with VIA chipset,
&gt; 128 MB RAM (2 x 64 MB SDRAM DIMMs) and an AMD K6-2/400 CPU.
&gt; Result:
&gt; My dual-boot wind95 + linux redhat 5.2 machine
&gt; became unusable, even after about a week of
&gt; hard work and taking it to a shop to get it "fixed".
&gt; 
&gt; The windows bit was interesting. I had windows95 A,
&gt; which apparently cannot be patched to cope with a
&gt; 400 MHz K6-2 CPU. So it had to be clocked back to 
&gt; 300 MHz, and a patch had to be applied to remove 
&gt; some sort of "windows access fault" or something.
&gt; But it still couldn't get the ethernet card working, and
&gt; the floppy drive A: froze, etc. etc.
&gt; 
&gt; The linux failed less seriously -- the ethernet card
&gt; disappeared (it should have been at address 0x6000
&gt; or something, PCI), and the com2 port (/dev/cua1) failed
&gt; - basically seemed to just disappear.
&gt; 
&gt; Cure:
&gt; Chucked out the new mainboard, CPU and RAM, and put back the
&gt; old board, cpu and ram.
&gt; Result: linux went back to normal.
&gt; The PCI ethernet card reappeared at the correct address,
&gt; and /dev/cua1 reappeared.
&gt; But the wind95 didn't come back. The patch to make the
&gt; OS cope with the K6-2 chip now caused the same
&gt; windows exception with the P133 as the unpatched
&gt; version with the K6-2/400.
&gt; 
&gt; My point:
&gt; This is all hideously messy.
&gt; I've just lost a week out of my life (and learned
&gt; heaps about the wiring inside a PC) because
&gt; this AMD hardware and VIA-based mainboard don't seem
&gt; to work well with either linux or wind95.
&gt; 
&gt; Question:
&gt; I never cared about this before.
&gt; But now I'd like to know:
&gt; Should one avoid the AMD chips?
&gt; Or more precisely, should dabblers like myself
&gt; avoid AMD chips?
&gt; 
&gt; I read an old Computer Shopper article about
&gt; compatibility problems of AMD chips with video
&gt; cards, and this starts to make me think that
&gt; one should just avoid them. I've also heard that their
&gt; shares are going down because their product is
&gt; not much good.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
