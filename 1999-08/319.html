Tried it, it was rubbish.  In my considerable experience the best place to
learn about programming is in your own home, with your own computer.  Get
a book, read it, and try out each language feature as you go.

University never struck me as able to provide much more than facilities
and projects.  Projects, such as "write a quicksort routine", are important
but honestly, if you need somebody else to tell you what to do then you
should admit defeat and give up now.  Facilities used to be valuable but
I think the most of us can probably do better by ourselves.  I think a
brand new Cyrix 300MX with 32MB RAM, 4GB disk, 17" monitor, good internet
connectivity, and Linux, at a cost of about $1100 plus internet, is very
much better than the crappy old gear that the universities can afford.

The "hard" part of programming, which involves a certain logical bent of
mind, is not something which anybody can really teach.  You can explain
it, but, well it's rather like the Nordic secret agent who was caught
spying:  They threw him into the fjords, but he just swam out; so they tied
weights to his body and threw him back; but he floated.  So they pulled
him out, put concrete around his legs and threw him back in.  He went down,
hit the bottom, the concrete broke and he swam away.  What they forgot --
and this is the bit that's relevant to programming -- is that you can lead
a norse to water but you can't make him sink.
