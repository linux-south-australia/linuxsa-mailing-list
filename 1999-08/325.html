Mike:

&gt; precisely because of all of your remarks, the very first thing i do after
&gt; any redhat installation is immediately re-compile for a pentium (or pro). 

This, I think, one should do under any distribution regardless of whether it is
RedHat or not. Of course, if one hasn't a pentium[pro] then -march it to the
appropriate hardware.

&gt; My experience has been that this alone speeds things up by 30%.

This, too is my own experience. One of my friends has almost given up on Linux
because the installed image on RH 5.2 is even slower than NT on his network.
This is most unfortunate; had I not been able to show him my own system running
extraordinarily quickly he may have given up on Linux completely.

&gt; I think however you are unintentionally critical of redhat's game plan.

To a certain extent I agree with what RedHat is attempting to do. However, they
give you no options in their install process. CDs now contain at least 650mB of
data and there are at least 3 CDs in a normal RedHat distribution. Surely they
could have a number of options with appropriate help such as:

1) Absolutely Everything...[help---best for beginners, warning this particular
image may not be the most efficient and may not give you the performance you may
expect from Linux]
2) Typical Installation...[help--recommended for most users, this particular
image is more efficient than (1) however because it will run on *most* systems
you may not gain the performance you might expect if you chose a higher option]
3) Pentium Installation [help--options same as 2 but optimised for
Pentiums...will  not work on a non pentium machine]
4) PentiumPro Installation...[help--same as above but for PentiumPro]
5) Build your own Kernel Installation...[You get the tCL (python?) menuconfig or
even an Xconfig and build your OWN kernel image]


&gt; The bottom line (for them) is to virtually g[u]arantee a succesful install

I have *never* had RedHat of any description successfully install my X Server.
Although RedHat 6.0 sort of got it working, it was extremely buggy and I still
had to tweak it to get it to work on 800x600.
 
&gt;  and must include everything under the sun, including the possibility
&gt; that the install is on a lowly 386 machine.

This is the lovely Windows paradigm. If you're going to end up with a really
slow, inefficient system you may as well stick with Windows. Although it tends
to crash - to be perfectly honest most of the time my Windows doesn't crash
unless it will cost me 25cents to reconnect to the Internet (hehe) for what I do
with it - there is a vast amount of software out there for it and most other
people, including the unix users, can cope with reading the various files and
formats it has.

&gt; In the end though, Linux users
&gt; are there to fiddle

This is true, but I thought that Linux was an operating system that could
increase productivity as well. It's not just an operating system so people can
play "system admin/root" god and tweak. I think this is an important step and an
important point for all of us to acknowledge. Linux is a very capable operating
system which can run office software such as StarOffice, ApplixWare and other
major software such as Oracle - not to mention Apache - at least as efficiently
as Window 9x/Nt.

&gt;, and one of the greatest appeals of the operating system
&gt; (until now anyway) has been this ability to customise any and everything to
&gt; what suits you.

It's a fine balance. Do you make a system which is bloated and slow, but
guaranteed to work and be stable, or a system which is lean and fast, but not
necessarily stable on all platforms. I think my thoughts about introducing
options could overcome some of this.

I mean, if one really wanted to go mad, one could include the option which
essentially was a "build your own linux from this distribution from SCRATCH".
I.E. You would literally build the various conf files, the kernel and such
yourself. The distribution would basically therefore act as a bootstrap
operation to getting the final installed components up.

I think RedHat need to be careful with what they are doing. I am quite
intentionally critical of them for their slow, bloated kernel..I think it would
be better marketing to market two separate streams...one the archaic work on
everything...two the modern, pentium (at least) stream...rather than make 333mHZ
pentiums run SLOWER than Windows NT.
