I currently have a working system, however I have run into a glitch:

1) I have FreeBSD 2.2.1 installed on my secondary slave on the MBR.
However, neither lilo no BSDLoader (when I turn off my primary ide
interface via bios) will boot it. BSDLoader appears, however BSD panics
because it can't mount the / partition. Is this because it's on
secondary slave or some other sinister reason? I *thought* that if my
BIOS wouldn't support booting off seocndary ide ports it just wouldn't
even come up witht he bsd loader.

2) If I were to switch my CD drive (currently /dev/hdb) with my
secondary slave (currently /dev/hdd), would linux (and for that matter
BSD) automatically work out what I'd done or would I need to make the
/dev/hdb and /dev/hdd devices again. If I needed to remake them can
someone give me pointers as to how?

DAVID.

No one sleeps, oh Principe, god so cold
Keeping guard by the stars, you fill our hearts with the hope of love
But love is a mystery to me, my heart now grows old
Blind in the dwindling light, how I long to meet you again!
