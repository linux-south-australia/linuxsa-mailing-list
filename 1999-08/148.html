&gt;As far as deciding between which is better out of PPP requesting
&gt;retransmission, or letting the modem handle the errors itself, keep in
&gt;mind that the modem is talking to the other modem on a direct link,
&gt;whereas PPP is probably getting warnings from the TCP/IP stack, then
&gt;going via the kernel and the serial port, thru the modem, out the other
&gt;end and thru the kernel, serial port, PPP and the tcp/ip stack again.
&gt;Even if my idea of the flow is completely wrong, the point is that the
&gt;modem-&gt;modem link has a much lower latency. If it detects a wrong bit,
&gt;it can request retransmission, and receive it, in less time than it
&gt;takes PPP to do so.

Hmmm, well it seems to depend on whether or not PPP provides
retransmissions in the Link Control Protocol and or IPCP, or whether or not
it leaves error recovery up to the higher layers.

Since TCP will try to track something like 2 to 4 times the RTT in
calculating the RTO, I suspect that modem error recovery may be the way to go.

Hoever, if PPP does error detection and retransmission at the LCP/IPCP
layer, you may get them fighting with PPP retransmitting while the modems
are trying to recover ...

Hmmm, will have to drag out the standards from those 35MB of compressed RFCs.

&gt;Thus, I'd assume that it makes sense to let the modem keep track of any
&gt;errors induced during the analogue transmission. Any thoughts on this
&gt;logic?
&gt;
&gt;As far as the point about getting info out of your modem re errors -
&gt;well, I know my old 28.8 had a diagnostics mode where you could get all
&gt;kinds of statistics out of it, including a little ascii bar graph and
&gt;stuff like that. THere's no way pppd would support this extension of
&gt;course, but if you really wanted to know about your phone line, the
&gt;possibilities are there.
&gt;
&gt;If anyone has any info on comparisions between the different PPP
&gt;compression modes (bsdcomp, deflate) and the relevant parameters, on
&gt;performance, I'd be interested to see them.
&gt;I tend to select the "best" mode that the other end supports, with the
&gt;largest lookup tables, but I really have no idea what this really
&gt;entails 8)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Most modems available these days are 56k capable (V90?), BUT it is my
&gt;&gt; &gt; understanding that you only gain a benefit when one end is a digital
modem
&gt;&gt; &gt; like in an access server of some sort.  In a modem to modem situation,
the
&gt;&gt; &gt; best you can get is 33.6kbps.  Can anyone confirm or deny?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The simple answer is yes.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; V90 is an asymetric protocol in more ways than one.  First to note, the
&gt;&gt; modem that you use at home, called the consumer modem, is completely
&gt;&gt; different to the one that you use at the server, called the digital modem.
&gt;&gt; The digital modem must be connected to a digital line, such as ISDN, and
&gt;&gt; there may be no analogue component in the communication link between the
&gt;&gt; digital modem and the consumer modem other than the very last link.  The
&gt;&gt; link between the consumer modem and the exchange may be analogue.  All
&gt;&gt; other parts must be digital.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; V90 (Kflex, X2) works on the basis that modern telephone networks are
&gt;&gt; almost totally digital.  From handset to exchange is analogue, at which
&gt;&gt; point the signal is digitised using a codec; and that digital signal is
&gt;&gt; transported without possibility of error.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Analogue modems work by splitting the audio spectrum into a number of fixed
&gt;&gt; points, each very loosely described by volume + frequency.  These points
&gt;&gt; are known as a constellation.  Each point on the constellation represents
&gt;&gt; a symbol that the modem can transmit or receive.  Due to imperfections in
&gt;&gt; analogue technology, the signal that is received can be a little different
&gt;&gt; to the one that was sent--perhaps a little different in volume, perhaps a
&gt;&gt; little different in frequency--so the receiving modem must decide what
&gt;&gt; symbol a signal is supposed to represent.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; V90 works by "knowing" certain characteristics of the codec used in the
&gt;&gt; exchange, and only transmitting those symbols "known" to be optimal.
&gt;&gt; Fortunately modern exchanges "all" use the same codec.  (Hmmm, anyone want
&gt;&gt; to place bets on how long V90 continues to work?)  Any digital to analogue
&gt;&gt; conversion causes loss of accuracy and makes V90 unusable.  During initial
&gt;&gt; handshake, V90 modems test the communications pathway.  If it is not
&gt;&gt; sufficient, for example if there is more than one analogue component,
&gt;&gt; they revert to analogue standards such as V.34.  Two consumer modems, even
&gt;&gt; if one or both are connected to an ISDN line, are guaranteed to revert to
&gt;&gt; this analogue mode (because consumer modems use analogue signaling.)
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt; While PPP is capable of compression, most modems also do very good
&gt;&gt; &gt; compression, and if I enable PPP compression, I may be fighting the
&gt;&gt; &gt; compression the modems can do.  So, I am better off letting the modems do
&gt;&gt; &gt; the compression.  Can anyone confirm or deny?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; If you permit the modem to do compression ipso facto you permit it to do
&gt;&gt; error recovery.  This can result in long delays between received bytes
&gt;&gt; where no long delay ought to be.  Will PPP cope with this elegantly, or
&gt;&gt; will it request retransmission?  It will almost always cause loss of error
&gt;&gt; counts, so you'll have no way of telling whether the line is good or bad.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; There was a time when I perceived better performance allowing PPP to do
&gt;&gt; error recovery.  On the other hand perception, unlike scientific
&gt;&gt; measurement, can be most misleading.  I advise you either to conduct your
&gt;&gt; own scientific experiments, and please to report back to us; or else toss
&gt;&gt; a coin.
