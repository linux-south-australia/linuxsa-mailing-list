&gt; But then again, I guess any software that end-users use can easily do this
&gt; kind of thing.
&gt; 
&gt; But then again again - UNIX security kinda prohibits the worst virii getting
&gt; through.
&gt; 
&gt; So - Windows bites!
&gt; 
&gt; And Unix rocks.
&gt; 
&gt; Biased opinion?  I think not.

I mildly disagree: Unix has been exempt partially because its 
penetration has been low.  As it becomes more prevalent, 
it will be attacked more -- look at the various warnings 
and patches for software noted here and elsewhere in the 
Linux community.  Six months ago, there were daily reports 
of Red Hat installations being hacked.  

Incidents like the Internet Worm show that Unix-aware viruses 
(or worms, or Trojan horses, whatever) certainly are possible.  
System administrators weren't proactive enough in closing 
known security holes that were exploited by the virus.  
At that time (1989), Unix boxes typically had one administrator 
for many users, so there was a fair chance that the 
administration would be reasonably competent.  

But there are now a lot of Unix systems with novice 
administrators out there.  The administration those systems 
receive most obviously isn't up to the level (on average) that 
comparable Unix systems would have received ten years ago, so 
there are certainly growing opportunities for a 
"Unix (Linux?) virus" to appear.  

Incidentally, if you're going to preach the benefit of memory 
managers and kernel protection, then strictly speaking you 
should probably separate Windows into 16-bit and NT streams.  
While I would still strongly prefer Linux over NT (having 
programmed in both environments), most of the basic 
security holes in lesser Windows versions have been addressed
in NT.
