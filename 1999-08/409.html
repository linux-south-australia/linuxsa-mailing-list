Yes I have, mainly for interest's sake.  But you can't answer whether it
is worth it without the context of what you want it for.  Are you
looking for a full time browser?  Something to hack?  Interested in
standards compliant browsers?  Or looking for a way to sap up spare
cycles?

It's not ready for beta testing yet - probably about two months off. 
The windows builds I've seen are better in performance than the linux
builds, but they are all coming along extremely quickly.

It's only really necessary to worry about cvs if you want to help write
features and fix bugs in Mozilla.

&gt; 1) Worth the effort
&gt; 2) Relatavily easy

For the most part getting the source from a cvs server is a matter of
installing cvs and entering a few commands.  Whether it's worth the
effort depends on what you want it for.

Pulling cvs puts you in the whirlpool of a cvs tree with probably about
100 checkins a day.  Although trees that don't compile are pounced upon
very quickly, at any moment, the tree could be in any state. If you're
willing to live with it, feel free.  There are times every day when Moz
is stabilised, so you might try pulling then if you can be bothered
translating timezones and working out when that is (I haven't).

If you just want to run it, report bugs, etc, pick up a nightly or
milestone build.
