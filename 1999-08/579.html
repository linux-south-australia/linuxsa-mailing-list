LinuxSA persons interested in linux distributions:


After some discussions here about "what is the best linux distribution",
I thought I'd just jot down a couple of notes on my
first experiences with SuSE 6.2.
This "jotting" experience has just taken 17 hours out of my life!
Here's my little first-impressions review.
(Now I know why people get paid to do this sort of thing!)

My motivations in getting SuSE were:

1.	To try to break the RedHat monopoly.
2.	To get a better linux distribution, with more stuff on it.
3.	To get support for my nVidia RIVA TNT2 card (and a
	friend's Intel i740.)
4.	To get better internationalization.

All of these (except 1) have succeeded.
Anyway, here are my 2743 words on the matter.

Regards,
Alan Kennington.

First impressions of:
SuSE 6.2 linux distribution (English-language version)
(Written by Alan Kennington, 30/31 August 1999.)

Late on Monday 30 August 1999 I installed the SuSE 6.2 linux distribution
on one of my PCs. I then re-installed it twice in the early hours of
Tuesday 31 August 1999. These are my comments on these experiences.

=======================================================================
Summary/conclusion

I think SuSE 6.2 is a clear generation ahead of the Redhat and
Mandrake distributions, but it still requires courage and stamina.
(I have installed Redhat 5.2 and Mandrake 6.0 before.)
There are some points that should be improved in the
SuSE 6.2 distribution to remove ambiguity for the novice installer.
But the options for getting out of difficult situations
are much wider and more helpful and generous.

The range of software on the 6 CDs is awesome. One can only
gasp as the one-line descriptions of one's chosen subset
of the 2710 packages flash up on the screen.

The cardboard wallet for the 6 CDs can be folded very conveniently to
access the CDs you want to get to. But if you turn it upside down or
something, 6 CDs go flying out of it. (My reactions were quick, though.)

During the installations, CD #2 failed a few times, which is
probably a fault in the disk itself, but the installation script
recovered very well with the failure, despite the lack of clarity
of what the script what actually doing or what it expected me to do.

When the system finally gets going (in KDE) the windows interface
is highly reminiscent, and any windows 95/98 user would feel much more
at home with this system than any other linux set-up I have seen.
In fact, it's downright annoying, because it gives me flash-backs
to the MS interface.

By the way, I tried to get the German-language edition of SuSE 6.2,
but the German company refused to sell it to me, even after I filled
out their form for overseas credit card orders. They required me
to get it from an Australian company, but they only had copies
which were reserved for customers who had ordered them. This was most
peeving. But luckily the SuSE distribution itself is much better than
their sales department.

One thing that worries me greatly is that there is no "rdate" on the
SuSE 6.2 distribution. So how to I synchronize the clock once a day?

All in all, the SuSE general software, administration and management
tools, and installation scripts are so impressive that I think everyone
who has had linux before should get it. A beginner probably should ask
for help to install it, unless they have boundless courage and stamina.
(I should clarify that I think redhat/mandrake are easier to install for
an easy installation, but SuSE is better for anything but a quite
standard PC. And right now, SuSE supports nVidia TNT2 and Intel i740,
whereas Mandrake 6.0 does not.)

Installation time.

The English-language version of SuSE 6.2 was released on 18 August
1999 (in Nurenberg, Germany?), and my copy appeared at the doorstep
(from NetCraft Austr.) at about 16:03 Monday 30 August 1999.

At 16:35, I started installing SuSE on my system, and had my
first installation succeed by 21:59, using the simple
non-expert installation option. That's about 5.5 hours.
My second installation was from 00:38 to 05:20, or 4.7 hours.

The second installation didn't really work out well either.
(TCP/IP/ethernet didn't work, nor did `hostname`, nor did LILO.)
In fact, the result was not as good as the first installation. So
I started the third installation from scratch at 05:25, finishing
at about 07:55, a total of 2.5 hours. It went like clockwork!
It also correctly configured everything. It's on the world net now.
(Hint: Don't use the `expert' mode. It's a mug's mode.)

Page 13 of the user manual says that a simple installation
should take about 30 minutes. That must be if you do a minimal
installation and you've done it 10 times before.

=======================================================================
Steps in SuSE 6.2 installation.

I chose to boot from the CD-ROM. There are 6 CDs. CD #1 is the
boot CD.

Straight away, it is obvious that this distribution is a
clear generation ahead of RedHat and Mandrake.
There are more options and more freedom to go backwards,
sidewards and forwards at every step. Some of the key-strokes
are not documented on-screen, like the space-key, tab-key and
esc-key, and the page-up/down keys. These do something reasonable
most of the time.

The colours are kinder and gentler than with mandrake/redhat.
The choice of language is much wider. You can install in many
languages, including Magyar (Hungarian), Brazilian and normal
Portuguese, Polish, Romanian, Slovene, Russian and Indonesian.
It announces that you will get linux kernel 2.2.10 (which is
marginally ahead of redhat 6.0 and mandrake 6.0, I think)
You are offered a choice of many types of keyboards, including
Danish and Finnish keyboards.

=================================
== System hardware information ==
=================================
While warming up, the boot script records lots of info about
the hardware. It then offers this to the user at a very early stage.
I was told that my CPU was 400.913145 MHz (slightly overclocked),
and it showed me the I/O memory usage, IRQ usage (by each CPU if
more than 1), DMA usage, and the usual `dmesg' output.
At this point, you can load or unload kernel modules, e.g. to
cope with SCSI disks. You get the option to mount the CD as
a live system, or run a rescue system, do a new install, or
and update.

When you choose to install a new system, YaST is run.
This is a bit like 'linuxconf' in some ways, but it doesn't
seem to have an X-windows option. Just `text-windows'.

=======================
== Disk Partitioning ==
=======================
During disk partitioning, there seem to be marginally more options than
in the disk druid or fdisk. The help info provided is much better,
though. You get to choose inode density in an octave range from 1024 up
to 16384. I wanted to know what "inode density" was, and there was,
surprisingly, an entry for this in the user manual, and the explanation
was crystal clear.

I should mention that the standard of English in the user manual and
software are very good indeed, i.e. not the `Deunglish' that you
sometimes get with German software products.

=====================
== Disk Formatting ==
=====================
Disk formatting with error checking always takes a long time. It took 30
minutes (17:00 to 17:30) to format my 13 GB disk. (This is what makes me
sceptical about the claim that SuSE takes only 30 minutes to install.)
[This was a good opportunity to get some coffee. It was a good cup:
50/50 mixture of freshly ground Kilimanjaro double-roast and Lavazza Bar
super crema, 10 grams in a 240 ml cup, wait for 4 minutes and add 22
grams thickened cream. I recommend it. By 1725, the coffee was long
finished. So I had 54 grams of President brie from Central Market at
only A$15 per kilo round. Adelaide has it's good points!]

===================================
== Choice of packages to install ==
===================================
After mounting the file systems, the most perplexing part of the
installation process occurs. Neither the on-screen explanations nor the
user manual seem to explain what to do here. After very numerous repeat
attempts, I finally worked out that the idea here is to somehow tell
YaST which of the 2710 packages one wants to install. What seems to be
completely lacking here is an instruction to the user to add an X server
to the package list. If one is not chosen, then the installation seems
to complete at a much later stage, and one finds that X windows does not
work. A linux box without graphics is not much fun! The insistence that
the user choose a server is done much better by Redhat and Mandrake.

If you want all packages, you can forget it. The package selection
algorithms are programmed with all sorts of rules about why you can't
have all the packages. It chooses a set for you, and if you try to add
more, it comes up continually with a pop-up windows saying that your
choice "makes no sense". It does give reasons for its warnings, but not
nearly enough. (For instance, it says that it makes no sense to install
both the North American and British spelling dictionaries. I decided
that it _did_ make sense, and installed them both.)

This is a fairly serious problem with the SuSE 6.2 installation. You are
mostly not told if the reason you shouldn't add extra packages is
because it really will clobber something else (like install the same
files as other packages), or whether the package would just be
superfluous. Such explanations are attempted, but are not explicit
enough. Some of the explanation are very clear though.

Related to this is the near impossibility of loading up all of the 1000
or so source packages. I wanted to install them all, but the only way to
do this was to type space-bar and down-arrow 1000 times to select them
all. So I'll have to work out how to do that later. (You have to work
out the space-bar action yourself. I didn't see this documented.)
If you thought choosing packages in Redhat was long-winded, choosing SuSE
packages requires you to go through the pain barrier.

==============================
== Installation of packages ==
==============================
An enormously useful feature, in hindsight, is the ability to save your
chosen package list to floppy disk. You should do this, because if you
need to re-install, it saves you clicking on all those packages again.

I chose in my second and third installations to install a mere 1491
packages (6.24 GB) of the 2710 packages available. (This doesn't leave
much spare space on a 13 GB disk. I'll need a new disk now.)

When the installation gets started, the screen display is better and
worse than the redhat/mandrake display. The SuSE installation progress
indicator scrolls the package names one per line up the screen, this
allows you to read the names of those tiny packages which take only 10
msec to install. The total number of packages installed and the number
left to install are shown, but not the progress in terms of percentage
of disk space installed. The progress is also indicated only by "#"
marks, not by nice colour bars as in mandrake/redhat.

A good thing about the package installation is that one script installs
all 5 or 6 CDs. (I think CD #6 is source packages only.) You just have
to change disks when prompted. Disk #5 had only two packages, namely
"arcad" and its libraries (about 720 MB). (This makes me very curious.)

If you want to manage RPM files after the installation is complete, I
found that "kpackage" is just awesomely user-friendly. Much better than
"linuxconf" or whatever redhat uses for this.

=========================
== CD #2 read-failures ==
=========================
You probably won't get this sort of error, but it was useful in showing
how SuSE copes with incomplete installation. The installation script
actually recognizes the failure of a disk-read and gets the installation
status up to date, and then offers do to do other things. I contrast
this with what happens if you try to make a back-up floppy disk on
redhat/mandrake with an LS120 drive. (The script waits forever for a
non-existent FDC drive and you have to re-boot, as far as I know.)

On 7 occasions in 3 full installations from scratch, disk CD #2
failed while reading packages. There were two types of errors - not
finding heaps of packages on the disk, taking 30 seconds to discover
that each package was _apparently_ not there. I waited out 66 packages
like this (33 minutes of wasted youth, so to speak). It turned out later
that a control-C causes the script to exit gracefully and correctly,
although a bit slowly.

The other kinds of error messages for the CD read-failures were like
`invalid: PREIN' or `invalid: POSTIN'.

Re-inserting the CD fixed the problem in each case, but it was necessary
to steer the installation script back to the right point each time,
which could sometimes take 10-15 minutes because of the lack of clarity
of the package installation dialogs.

=======================
== Choosing a kernel ==
=======================
You get a choice of a couple of IDE kernels an a big bunch of
SCSI kernels, one for each kind of adapter. No problems here.
You also get to make a boot disk floppy for rescue etc., as is
usual in all distributions.

========================================
== Configuring network, devices, etc. ==
========================================
If you follow the non-expert installation option, configuring
all the sendmail, ethernet, TCP/IP, domain name stuff, then this all
goes very smoothly and correctly.

After reconfiguration, the script triggers a re-boot to get the benefit
of the configuration values (just like wind95/98!).

When I tried the "expert" mode, so many things were not set up right, I
just decided to do the whole thing again. Also, LILO objected to boot
blocks being outside the 1024 cylinder limit. So it was unbootable. To
fix this, I created a 10MB /boot partition just for the kernel and boot
stuff -- and YaST used it without being told what it was for!

=======================================================================
X Window System configuration.

At this point, the installation is announced as finished. But when you
try to run `startx', it doesn't work. Even if you run xf86config, there
are no X servers to use. Redhat/Mandrake get this right -- they ask you
all the right questions and then get the right server off the disk for
you. The XFree86 3.3.4 source (which I have completely built myself many
times) installs the entire set of all X Servers. But SuSE 6.2 doesn't
install more than just some 16 bit VGA server and a mono server, or
something like that.

The solution to this problem is telepathy. You have to sense that at the
package choice stage, you must go into the `xsrv' package group and
select the right server to install. This choice is not quite obvious.
Once again, telepathy is useful here.

You can use "cd /cdrom/suse/xsrv2; rpm -i xsvga" or something
similar to load up the right server. (This actually works.) But this
then makes your package installation database incorrect. So it's best to
use the YaST facility.

If you have an obscure new card, like an Intel i740 or nVidia RIVA TNT2,
you should use "xf86config" rather than SaX to set up your XF86Config
file. SaX is a very nice tool, but it lacks large numbers of options.
xf86config is user-hostile, but gets the right answer.

Trying to work out how to install the X server cost me many hours of
frustrating, soul-desiccating work. This part of the SuSE installation
software should be improved.

The package-choosing part of YaST is quite dictatorial about X servers,
when actually you can install all of them, and probably should if you
change video cards often. Similarly, the openGL support for video cards
is in packages which YaST tries to stop you from installing together.
The way it says "It makes no sense to install this..." all the time is
particularly annoying.

X server configuration is essential to making use of linux (unless you
really do want an anoymous server box in the corner or a back room). So
SuSE should learn from the superior facitilies for this in the
Redhat/Mandrake distributions.

End of "review".
