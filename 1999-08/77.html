Conrad,

My experience is that Macintosh is a more stable platform that Windows,
which is surprising considering that Windows offers marginally better
protection between tasks.  (Macintosh is totally without protection;
Windows is only almost totally lacking protection.)  Macintosh users
have very high expectations of reliability and ease-of-use, so if a
Macintosh program looks wrong, or if it works badly, it fails in the
market place.  Windows users, of course, accept any old crap and are
happy if the program just installs.  I think this is why Macintosh,
with it's "minimalistic approach," is (in my extensive experience)
more reliable than Windows.

To your problems: "Fragment error" is not a Macintosh error that I've
ever heard about, so I'd say that it's an application specific error.
I think perhaps your application must be crap.  It probably falls into
the category of an application that is going to fail to meet Macintosh
expectations, and thus will fail in the market.  Get off the sinking
ship now.  There are so many high quality solutions for Mac that you
don't need to accept something of the standard that the MS world
accepts.  I should also add, speaking of MS, that a very large Mac
site that I deal with had significant reliability problems which
mysteriously went away with a later release of Microsoft Mail.  Later
still, they upgraded to Office 98, at which time their Macs started
crashing every few hours.  Macintosh provides no inter-program
protection, so one rogue program from Redmond can undo you.  What's
worse, one rogue program can make *another* program look bad; it's
not necessarily the program which crashes that's at fault.

David
