&gt;&gt; I wanted to get a copy of linux but since I am new to linux not sure what

&gt;&gt; here are about "I had RH5.2 and it worked and when I installed RH6.0 I got
&gt;&gt; .... error"
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; RH6.? was $100+ last time I checked!!!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I only need to compile C programs and do word processing. Maybe go on the
&gt;&gt; net occasionaly.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Is it worth getting RH6.0 or 5.2 will do for my needs.

You don't say whether you are a novice (like me) or an experienced *nix
person.
My (new and limited) experience shows:
1. There is an overwhelming amout of Linux documentation, but essential and
simple information is nearly always missing.  Hence -
I purchased the RH5.2 disks and tried to install on the 3rd partition on my
HD.  Doesn't work.  I had to find out why by (repeated) trial and error.
2. RH demanded that I made decisions on the best size of the multiplicity
of partitions it wanted me to set up, when I was simply not in any way
equipped to make them. (In principle, the RH system is prone to huge wasted
of space OR repeated use of Partition Magic (or similar)).

SO ...  I'd recommend SuSE (I have v6.0).  It gives total control over what
you decide to install, and then makes that installation into appropriate
directories automatically.
Why would you need the power of Star Office?
I would suggest you use Lyx, which is as close to WYSIWYG as you would
need, and FREE in the SuSE distro.  You wouldn't need to install any bulky
version of X-windows like KDE or Gnome for C programming and word
processing. This has benefits in speed.

My 2c worth.
