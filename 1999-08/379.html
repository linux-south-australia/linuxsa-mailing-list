David,
I think you need to lighten up a little bit. Maybe you've had too many coffees
today? Perhaps a lie down would help? ;-)

And maybe people not getting defensive about every little taunt that comes their
way would help out on this list as well. My interpretation of the message sent
to you was that Nick was having a bit of fun. Why not treat it like that rather
than some (rather paranoid) perceived attack on your abilities.

regards,
Andrew O'C
&gt;Nick:
&gt;
&gt;Please inform me what a "true" unix user is? I almost exclusively use RedHat
6.0
&gt;at home and SunOs 2.6 at University unless they force me to use the Windows
NT
&gt;server.
&gt;
&gt;I guess if you mean that a nontrue unix user is someone who does not use unix

&gt;then obviously you're patently wrong. However, if you mean that a nontrue unix

&gt;user is someone who doesn't use unix like you do then what you're saying is

&gt;obviously true but only from *your* point of view.
&gt;
&gt;I consider myself a "true" unix user. Having only used it for one year I am

&gt;still discovering a lot about the operating system, however I don't appear
to do
&gt;anything altogether differently than other users on linuxSA. I would note that
a
&gt;number of other users indicated they used Netscape to cope with their email...I

&gt;guess they're not true users either.
&gt;
&gt;To be perfectly frank, I'm not altogether convinced that accusing someone of

&gt;being a nontrue user of unix (or anything else) is either constructive, or
for
&gt;that matter provable. Whilst I am not too slighted by your comments, I do find

&gt;them a little disturbing and a little elitist.
&gt;
&gt;Ah well, so goes the world.
&gt;
&gt;DAVID.
