Hi,

If you know of someone who could be interested in this, please pass it on.

A company that I do work for in Sydney is looking for an instructor to
deliver about 70 days of training and about 30 days of customization of the
course over the next six months.

It is anticipated that the successful applicant will be resident in Sydney
or Melbourne, or can relocate to Sydney or Melbourne for the duration.  No
relocation expenses are available.

The successful applicant must be willing to travel during the assignment.
Travel and accomodation expenses will be re-imbursed at the company's
normal rates.  Training will be delivered in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Perth, and possibly Canberra and Brisbane.

The successful applicant should have experience in computer related
training, and should have knowledge of the Windows platforms and Internet
access.  Macintosh knowledge would be an advantage.

A competitive rate will be paid.

Please respond to me in the first instance, indicating:

  - Relevant training experience
  - Relevant course customization experience
  - Relevant Windows experience
  - Any Macintosh experience

I will pass your interest on to the company in Sydney.

All decisions rest with the company in Sydney.

Regards
