Brian,

Further to that comment, and not wanting to clog up the list
with conversational things, I'd like to just comment that
after meditating on what my next linux will be (for my fourth
active home computer), I've decided finally on
SuSE 6.2 (German version).

[PS. I will clog up the list after all, but please don't anyone else
respond to this item on the list!]
I think that redhat is the new microsoft -- i.e. they are passing
off rushed kludgy software/distributions into a market which wants to
know all the time "who's the leader?", rather than who's the best.
(Several weeks ago, the faulty Perl distribution caused my
great woe and travail when it turned out that the Perl/Tk
can't interwork with it because of bugs in the Perl distribution
incorrectly issued by redhat.)

With the big redhat prices rises, and the fact that I just
did another redhat 5.2 install with those awful inflexible
redhat install scripts, and the fact that now redhat will have to
generate US$billions for their shareholders, and the fact that
SuSE profit figures are higher than for redhat anyway,
I've finally decided that SuSE should be my next linux.
(I just hope I won't need the german keyboard for the german SuSE!)

The reviews of SuSE all seem quite positive -- as a second linux.
It seems that Caldera is supposed to be best for beginners and
SuSE is supposed to be best for experienced users.

A while back, I tried to get redhat to install on drive F or G or something
on a wind95 machine, and just couldn't. I think the Slakware
install-script is able to do this.
Definitely the initial install-script has substantial
weaknesses. The documentation is fullsome on things that don't matter.
The APC linux pocketbook is still the best first linux in my opinion.

So my recommendation (as a non-professional) is:

1.	Beginners get the APC linux pocketbook. (Still $15?)
2.	The second linux should be SuSE 6.2, or whatever is the latest
	by the time you read this.
	(I just ordered the German version to avoid the wait for
	the English-language version, and to increase the thrill of use,
	and in the hope of getting better international support
	for those little markings on top of european alphabets.
	What I'd really like is a unicode linux with unicode keyboard
	with 65,536 keys.....but I digress.)
	Cost seems to be A$63 pre-ordered for English version in
	Australia from a certain Sydney linux mail-order company,
	or DM84.48 + DM29.00 post for the German version from SuSE.
	[Digression: They charge 16% value-added tax on the software
	within Europe. Not payable on exports to us.]
	They also release a French-language version.

Regards,
Alan Kennington.
