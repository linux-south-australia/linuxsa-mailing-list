&gt; Nick:
&gt; 
&gt; Please inform me what a "true" unix user is? I almost exclusively use RedHat 6.0
&gt; at home and SunOs 2.6 at University unless they force me to use the Windows NT
&gt; server.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess if you mean that a nontrue unix user is someone who does not use unix
&gt; then obviously you're patently wrong. However, if you mean that a nontrue unix
&gt; user is someone who doesn't use unix like you do then what you're saying is
&gt; obviously true but only from *your* point of view.
&gt; 
&gt; I consider myself a "true" unix user. Having only used it for one year I am
&gt; still discovering a lot about the operating system, however I don't appear to do
&gt; anything altogether differently than other users on linuxSA. I would note that a
&gt; number of other users indicated they used Netscape to cope with their email...I
&gt; guess they're not true users either.
&gt; 
&gt; To be perfectly frank, I'm not altogether convinced that accusing someone of
&gt; being a nontrue user of unix (or anything else) is either constructive, or for
&gt; that matter provable. Whilst I am not too slighted by your comments, I do find
&gt; them a little disturbing and a little elitist.
&gt; 
&gt; Ah well, so goes the world.

I think what Nick should have said was "You're not a hard core UNIX
user, unless you have a sense of humour".

Sorry to joke around David, but you do look pretty funny right now.

Tee hee
