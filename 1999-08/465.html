&gt; The linux figures were obtained 3 ways: Netscape, ftp & ncftp and all there 
&gt; gave figures consistently below the download perfromance of Netscape in NT.
&gt; I have set up the pppd to use hardware flow control. I figure that some of my
&gt; network/ppp settings must be sub-optimal but can't figure out which ones!

So how long did it take to download the same file from the same
location using these three programmes under the two diffrent OS's? As
Mark mentioned, you can't use what the various programmes tell you,
you must use time as your benchmark. Get a stop watch if you must, but
you can't expect reliable results from these programmes.

Fill this table in:

Programme	OS	DL Time

Netscape	NT
Netscape	Linux
NcFTP		Linux	
WSFTP		NT
ftp		Linux
ftp		NT

Don't forget to bypass your proxy server for these tests, and always
grab the same file from the same location. The best way to do this is
to grab a large file that you know exists somewhere on your Internet
Provider's network. Something at least a Meg or two.  Don't let any
network lag between your provider and the rest of the Internet skew
your results.  Remember that alot of ISP's do transparent proxying.
You don't very often get the actual file you are requesting from the
actual location you are downloading from, even though you think you
are.. 

I'm not doubting that you have a problem, but if you are getting the
data the way you say you are, then you won't know if you do.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; I have found that Linux gives me much slower download speeds using PPP than
&gt; &gt;  &gt; the same computer running Windows NT.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How are you measuring this?  If it's via the indicator at the bottom
&gt; &gt; of your Netscape window, then forget it because the indicator totally
&gt; &gt; fabricates its throughput measurements.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Use the command-line ftp client to transfer a large file under Windows,
&gt; &gt; then the same large file under Linux.  I will be very surprised if you
&gt; &gt; can see any appreciable difference.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you *do* see a difference, check that you're correctly using hardware
&gt; &gt; flow control on your serial port under Linux (crtscts is the pppd option
&gt; &gt; to use, there are checkboxes in graphical PPP configuration clients).
&gt; &gt; Also compare the modem init strings that are being used to make sure
&gt; &gt; the stuff you've set up in Linux is turning on the same compression
&gt; &gt; and error correction options you're using under Windows.
&gt; &gt;
