Subject: LAN Gateway


Ok heres the situation: Having trouble with my LAN.

I have one freeBSD box down in my basement, with a ppp connection.
i have one Linux box upstairs in my comfy room. (with a WINMODEM
unfortunately).
So i set up linux to use the Gateway "172.17.76.2" [SDF]. that is the
internal IP
and hostname of my downstairs box. I couldn't get much info about how else
to go about this.
Is there some extra configuration i need to do in Linux?
Dont know much about the linux side, but.

And as for the freebSD box, i put "gateway_enable = yes" in my rc.conf file.
also i compiled the kernel with IP forwarding and IPfirewall. I type in
"pppd" to connect to the internet. so is there something im missing?

Easy way to get ppp working on a bsd box is use the the program ppp (it uses
the tun0 device to seend stuff in and out of the kernel),

You need to edit the file ppp.conf which is in /etc/ppp
ppp.linkup as well

(You can actully test that ppp is working with out a ppp.conf
Just type ppp
at the ppp command line type term, then type normal commands to suit your
modem to make it dial, logon then when ppp starts at the other end it goes
into ppp mode auto you can then test it =].)

There is section in the FreeBSD handbook on how to do this (its on your
machine if you installed the docs in /usr/share/docs/handbook or on
www.freebsd.org/handbook/ )

Then once the config files are setup all you do is
type
ppp -ddial (and the service name here)
To have ppp without ip aliasing (or or fowarding or what ever yoou wish to
call it )

ppp -ddial -alias (and the service name here)
To have ppp with ip aliasing.
You dont have to setup any ipforwarding rules or stuff)

e.g i type  ppp -ddial rebel  (rebel is the name of the section int he
ppp.conf file that corrsesond with the isp i want to dail)

If you need more help feel free to email me, or somone else on the list
might be able to help you better.

Brad
