&gt;Now I am having problems getting a GUI.  When I use X or startx I get the
&gt;following error:
&gt;x: exec of usr/bin/X11/XF86_NONE failed
&gt;so I ran xf86configure and made sure the config file was written to
&gt;usr/bin/X11/.... and X and startx still did not work properly.
Hi Conrad,

I see two potential problems right away.
Firstly the reference to XF86_NONE suggests that you may not have
installed the server applicable to your VGA card.  For instance, my
machine has a card with the S3 chipset so I installed the xserver-s3.
What type of card do you have? take a look in /usr/doc/xserver-common.

Second, the config file (on Debian systems) lives at
/etc/X11/XF86Config, not /usr/bin/X11 as you indicated, but that
shouldn't be a real problem because both configuration programs have
been built to put their results under /etc.

&gt;So I ran XF86Setup.  I was asked if I wanted to use the existing config file
&gt;or create a new one.  Using the existing config file failed and using the
&gt;existing one took me to a screen asking if I wanted to swap to the graphic
&gt;version and upon hitting enter the screen displayed vertical lines and then
&gt;all white and then half black and half white.  At this point I left it a
&gt;while as instructed by the previous screen - but nothing and eventually I
&gt;had to ctrl-alt-backspace to terminate it.

I had very similar symptoms when I attempted to configure the wrong
server for my previous video card.  Eventually I fell back to using
the SVGA driver which is not hardware specific (later I purchased a
different card).

One thing that I found usefull is to run:

	/usr/X11R6/bin/X -probeonly -verbose

This enables you to see what modes are being selected.  Another way 
to get this info is to switch back to the virtual console on which the 
startx command was given by the key combination Ctrl-leftAlt-F1 (assuming 
that you started on F1), this may be preferable to ctrl-alt-backspace.

BTW, I have found that the X11 configuration programs produce less
than optimal results and I have always finished off by editing the
XF86config file to limit the field of alternative modes then
customising those with the xvidtune program.  

If you post again on this topic, could you please indicate what
chipset your card uses, and the X server that you have selected. It may
also be useful to see the insides of your XF86config file but don't
post the whole thing, just the "Device" and "Monitor" sections
applicable to your hardware.

Hope this helps,
