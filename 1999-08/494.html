 &gt; I did rearrange my hard drives, and although I had a minor glitch

Ok, it sounds like it would have dropped you into single-user mode
after failing to fsck/mount the disk partitions mentioned in your
/etc/fstab.  I'm guessing that your fstab would have mentioned names
like "/dev/wd0s1a";  now that you've moved disks, the FreeBSD root 
partition comes up as "/dev/wd3s1a".  In single user mode, your root
filesystem is read-only (until it's remounted after fsck runs).

You can mount that partition:  "mount -u /dev/wd3s1a /" will "remount"
it in read/write mode.  You could then manually mount your /usr and
/var partitions, set your TERM environment variable to something sane
(if it isn't already) and use vi to edit your /etc/fstab to more
accurately reflect reality.

 &gt; Kaboom...because /dev/cdrom was now on secondary IDE it wouldn't boot a
 &gt; thing.

That'd be a BIOS problem.

 &gt; I therefore dd[ed] a FreeBSD boot image onto a floppy just as the
 &gt; BSD said to do, rebooted and ended up having whatever was on the floppy
 &gt; manage to hard reboot my system. I'm not altogther certain what went
 &gt; wrong.

You had the right image?  There are two of them:  An LS120 image (larger
than 1.44 Mbytes!) and a floppy version.  The floppy version is split into
two 1.44 Mbyte images, one for the boot disk and the other one for the 
root filesystem image.
