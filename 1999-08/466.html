We have seen this happen sometimes even if you just change kernel versions.
(the drive mode/CHS is identified differently during kernel dev probing)

Basically, LILO is not _quite_ finding the bootsector (from what I 
understand anyway) and usually you can get the system to boot 
again either by:

a) Booting from disk (but loading your HDD root system), taking note
of the geometry that your kernel identifies during the dev probing.
Then adding this geometry to your lilo.conf in one of two ways:
(which one works seems to depend on kernel version)
##################################
#eg-1:
disk = /dev/hda
       bios = 0x80
       sectors = 63
       heads = 15
       cylinders = 13446
image = /vmlinuz
  root = /dev/hda1
  label = Linux
#################################
#eg-2:
image = /vmlinuz
	append = "hd=13446,15,63"
  root = /dev/hda1
  label = Linux
#################################

*[must run 'lilo' when finished to run this config into boot sector]


(b) By trying all the available combinations of CMOS HD block modes
with (and without) both types of method (a) drive geometry statements
included in the LILO config.


The only occasions when both of these tricks combined has failed
were when we had to create a 500M hda1 partition to boot from
because the was no other way. However, this has been more to do
with that machine's bios not liking 1024+ cylinder drives, and
has only ever happend once or twice.

Good luck,

Regards
