&gt; I agree - I'd go with a Real modem over a winmodem any day, but bad moves

&gt;
&gt; Our hardware suppliers ( and we are in contact with a fair number) are
&gt; starting to swing exclusively towards Winmodems for internal modems. Bugger
&gt; I say.

Our Company has a strict policy that we will NOT use winmodems or any
other products that require win* to work. We have passed this message onto our

suppliers and have told them if they do not supply us with quality _standard_
hardware we will shop elsewhere.. This includes Mainboards, printers modems
Scanners (scsi) and ANY other hardware

Microsofts marketing has permeated al the way from the manufacturer to the
retailer.
When our customers ask about price we explain to them the concept of using a
Mainboard with out on board modems/sound/video, we use analogies such as
" this is like having your car alternator moulded in to the engine, What
happens
when the alternator dies"?..We try to educate the customers thus reducing
demand for such items as winmodems. We may lose a few sales to the cheaper
onboard everything vendors, but, we rarely have a machine returned for
hardware
failure.

Kind regards
Kevin
