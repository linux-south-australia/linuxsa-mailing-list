&gt;&gt; Anyway, to everyone who replied, thanks heaps, but I was wondering more on
&gt;&gt; the lines of free guides, like docs on my linux system or tutorials on the
&gt;&gt; net, as I am pretty short of cash....
&gt;
&gt;Often the best way to learn is to look at source code; pick your favourite
&gt;open source project (suggest you pick something simple, learning C from the
&gt;linux kernel, sendmail or other large complicated projects is probably not
&gt;recommended :) ) and read through it. Piece it together. C is not unlike
Java,
&gt;certainly in terms of syntax. I think there are probably some decent
textbooks
&gt;in the Barr Smith Library at Adelaide Uni, too; saves you having to buy
&gt;anything, anyway.

Hmmm, I guess I have to disagree here.

One can stare at source all day, and not learn much.  However, by actually
implementing something, once can go so much further.

For example, by implementing things in Ethereal, I have learned so much
more about TCP/IP.

By writing a multithreaded SMB server, I have learned so much more about
SMB and threading code under Linux.

By actualling writing some Perl code that needed AUTOLOAD functionality and
tree structured, dynamic and recursive objects, I have learned so so much
more about Perl than reading heaps of code.

However, having the code as a handy reference when you are programming is
so useful :-)
