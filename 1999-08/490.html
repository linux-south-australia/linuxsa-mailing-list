HI.... look at the HDD(partition) BSD is trying to mount when you get
the boot prompt: souinds like its trying to mount a non "freebsd"
partition david. probably defaulting to 1:wd(0,a) or 1:wd(1,a) or
similar.


If your FreeBSD is on the secondary slave, then you need 1:wd(3,a)  as
the boot parameter 
so,  when you get "boot:" type 

1:wd(3,a)kernel    [and then hit enter!]

I had similar probs here with Linux on /dev/hda, cdrom on /dev/hdb and
freebsd on /dev/hdc

Lilo is the best choice for a boot manager, I reckon!
Set up these lines in lilo.conf and rerun lilo

other = /dev/hdd1
label = FreeBSD
table = /dev/hdd
(optional parameter is   loader = /boot/chain.b)


After booting into FREEBSD go to the  /  directory  and there is a file
called "boot.config"  ....add this line to it

1:wd(3,a)kernel

That will make the correct partition boot.

As a beginner at FreeBSD this works for me, it may not be the "right
way" but its the only way I got around the problems you are seeing.

Cheers, Phil

&gt; I currently have a working system, however I have run into a glitch:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) I have FreeBSD 2.2.1 installed on my secondary slave on the MBR.
&gt; However, neither lilo no BSDLoader (when I turn off my primary ide
&gt; interface via bios) will boot it. BSDLoader appears, however BSD panics
&gt; because it can't mount the / partition. Is this because it's on
&gt; secondary slave or some other sinister reason? I *thought* that if my
&gt; BIOS wouldn't support booting off seocndary ide ports it just wouldn't
&gt; even come up witht he bsd loader.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) If I were to switch my CD drive (currently /dev/hdb) with my
&gt; secondary slave (currently /dev/hdd), would linux (and for that matter
&gt; BSD) automatically work out what I'd done or would I need to make the
&gt; /dev/hdb and /dev/hdd devices again. If I needed to remake them can
&gt; someone give me pointers as to how?
