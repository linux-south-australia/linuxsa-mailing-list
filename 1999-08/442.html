Hi all,

At 22:25 22/08/99 +0930, you wrote:
&gt;I looked quickly at squid's web site, but couldn't find anything on
&gt;filemaps. Since squid worked happily for quite a few weeks/months happily, i
&gt;find this strange. Oh, using cachemgr.cgi, i can see 7874 out of 7874
&gt;filemap bits are being used, but that doesn't help me personally :(
&gt;
&gt;any ideas?
&gt;

I'm not sure about 'filemaps', but it does sound like the same
"not enough file descriptors" problem that we were originally experiencing 
with our squid servers once their usage got up to something sizable.
They basically couldn't open enough files at one time to service 
all the requests it had to serve, and would go into a negative spiral.

The default number of file descriptors under our kernels was 256 
but you can get a patch for your kernel to change this to something
a bit more scalable to squid's requirements (we found 1024 to be sufficient).

Check out:
<A HREF="http://www.avana.net/~ventura/docs/linux/linux-fd-tweak.html">http://www.avana.net/~ventura/docs/linux/linux-fd-tweak.html</A>

And check your status with a "uname -a" output.

*ASIDE
This is actually one of the reasons we eventually changed our proxy 
servers to run under FreeBSD. The file-desc count is bigger by default
and the whole system is better geared for the sheer number of connections
it must serve per day. Having said that, I still fumble around the
interface and building kernels is pretty rigorous compared to Linux, 
so we are definately not converting any other servers, ;-) 
but for large scale proxy machines, it does seem to be a good alternative
(for heavily loaded linux-driven squid boxes that can't keep up).

Hope this helped,
Regards
-Daniel
