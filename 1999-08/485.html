Jake!

I did rearrange my hard drives, and although I had a minor glitch
because /dev/cdrom didn't point to the right device any more everything
went well. Nonetheless, FreeBSD still refused to load properly and would
only allow me to get into a rescue mode without I might add access even
to "vi".

I *think* my problem was that because I had rearranged my drives, the
original install had installed different /dev devices to the /etc/fstab.
Because I couldn't access the /etc/fstab [I tried using pico and ed as
well], I couldn't change the values. So, I thought "reinstall".

Kaboom...because /dev/cdrom was now on secondary IDE it wouldn't boot a
thing. I therefore dd[ed] a FreeBSD boot image onto a floppy just as the
BSD said to do, rebooted and ended up having whatever was on the floppy
manage to hard reboot my system. I'm not altogther certain what went
wrong.

My only option seems to be to somehow rearrange my primary ide drive so
that a small bsd /boot partition will sit below 1024. This, I might say,
is a pain the backside; does anyone know of any utilities which will
resize an ext2 partition live (like fips does for vfat et al but for
ext2)?

Anyway.

DAVID L.

Blind in the dwindling light, how I long to meet you again!
