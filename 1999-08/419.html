Question:

Are there tools to block-wide copy one hard disk to another?

More specifically, I have two disks that I'd like to "move"
to other disks.

Case 1:
A 2 MB linux disk which I would like to "move" to a 4 or 13 GB disk.
I imagine a problem here is that I need superblocks (or whatever)
all the way over the new disk. I.e. it needs to have "fdisk" run over it
to get the basic file system in there.
And then I need to copy everything else.

I imagine that I need to run lilo over the new disk,
because the exacty physical locations of boot files
etc. will change.

Another question:
Suppose I just use two "tar" processes back-to-back
over a pipe via "rsh" to copy all files from
disk 1 to disk 2. Would I lose anything apart
from the boot sector?
In other words, if I copy all files by tarring,
and if I create a new boot sector, should the new
disk work just the same when I try to boot it?

Case 2:
I have a wind95 1.6 GB disk which I'd like to
"move" to a 4.3 GB disk.
Now if I create a vfat file system on the
new, bigger disk, and copy all files with "tar"
via a pipe to the new disk, and if I use lilo
to create a boot sector on the new disk,
will wind95 run just like before?

------------------------------------------------
The way that I imagine that disks are used is:

cylinder 0:	Only one sector used, the boot sector.

cylinders 1-$:  Starts with superblock stuff, then
		inodes, files/directories etc.

I sometimes wonder what the spare space in
cylinder 0 does.

I looked for HOWTOs on this subject and found none.
Is there a good reference for all fo this kind of
thing?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Thanks for all of the help with info on
how to build a linux PC in Adelaide.
After researching the subject enough to
be able to ask for what I wanted in a shop,
I finally decided I knew enough to choose all of
the components myself and build it at home,
thereby saving myself some money, and getting a
system which I may (or may not) understand.
