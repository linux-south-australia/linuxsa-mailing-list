Michael:

&gt; My system in unbearably slow at times as it is constantly swapping to the
&gt; hard disk which is the same drive as my / /usr and /var partitions.

I believe that the actual hard drive speed would be of much more concern
rather than what partitions sat on the particular hard drive. Ensure
that your swap partition is on your FASTEST hard drive.
 
&gt; When I run top, it reports that all of my physical memory (32 MB),
&gt; as well as 100 MB of my 256 MB swap is being used.

KDE and X alone will take at least 90mB of memory. KDE and X are both
highly memory intensive. They are excellent programs and they are
certainly more efficient at using resources tban Windows ever will be.
Nonetheless, don't expect them to run too well on 32mB of memory...just
because we're running linux doesn't automatically make GUIs
non-bloatware.

&gt;  It reports that X is
&gt; using 52 MB which is 174% of my physical memory.

Your X seems to be bigger than mine. However, I'm running an
XFree86-S3_Virge server. If you can find a server more suited to your
card use it.

&gt;  I am also
&gt; running Netscape Communicator

Top reports that Communicator uses more memory than X on my system.
Netscape if *REAL* bloatware. Don't expect Netscape to go too fast on
only 32mB of RAM. Netscape has a lot of features but nothing comes for
nothing.

&gt; I am running Red Hat 6.0, kernel 2.2.11, KDE 1.1.1, Netscape Communicator
&gt; 4.61, physical RAM 32 MB, swap 2x128 MB hard disk.

I seriously doubt whether you need two swap files unless you do
intensive graphics development. I currently run on 192mB and the only
time I needed swap was when I was installing star office - mind you I
had three navigators, messenger, licq, X, GNOME, I was making a kernel
and had a number of xterms up.

The kernel, kde and netscape could easily use abut 160mB of memory.

&gt; Also running XFree86 3.3.4 SVGA (Voodoo Banshee).

Try to find a closer server. It may go faster, but I also understand
that SVGA server is a little more bloated because it is so generic.
 
In addition, when you next rebuild the kernel, do this:

1) Edit the /usr/src/linux Makefile and edit the two cflags options to
further optimise....eg take it up to -O3 at least...take a look at "info
gcc--&gt;invoking--&gt;optimisations" and turn on whatever you want.

2) Edit the /usr/src/linux/arch/i386 Makefile and make sure that the
procesor you've selected has a -march option to it....

3) Rebuild the kernel making sure that virtually everything possible is
a module. If you can make it modular do so...it will free memory and
I've found the slight overhead one gets with module swapping more than
compensates.

I hope this is of assisstance.

Keeping guard by the stars, you fill our hearts with the hope of love
But love is a mystery to me, my heart now grows old
Blind in the dwindling light, how I long to meet you again!
