I agree with Toby.

No further comment from me, most of it has been said.

Rob.

Subject: Re: Programmimg...


&gt; Just a brief comment;
&gt; I could code in C, C++ and various varieties of basic, and a little bit
&gt; of pascal before I went to uni, in both DOS and Linux. (Although not
&gt; very well in Linux.)
&gt; At university I was brought into contact with all sorts of unix
&gt; machines, and I learned that just because I knew Linux, didn't mean I
&gt; knew how to use any unix machine. I was forcibly taught how to use
&gt; things from the point of view as a user, not a an all-powerful root
&gt; user. I also learnt how to code in C 'properly', instead of my
&gt; self-taught style. While admitedly both methods would give the same
&gt; result, you've got to admit that if you were like me and self-taught
&gt; yourself how to program by reading others' (often dodgy) source  code,
&gt; then you can pick up some bad habits.
&gt; Even if you don't, you will still probably be coding in a way that is
&gt; indecipherable to others. When you are forced to work together with
&gt; other people, you start commenting your work better, and you realise how
&gt; to make things such that they can be intergrated better.
&gt;
&gt; I'd say that doing a proper course is definately a good idea.
&gt; I did 90% of my programming from home on a 486 with redhat 4.0 (and then
&gt; 4.2, etc..) linux on it, but I knew that I had to make good code that
&gt; would still compile and work the same on the uni boxes running ultrix
&gt; and solaris. People teaching themselves to code from a book, on their
&gt; own machine, will never experience this variety.
&gt; However, I learn better from source code and books than I do from a
&gt; lecturer, but the combination is best of all.

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Tried it, it was rubbish.  In my considerable experience the best place
to
&gt; &gt; &gt;learn about programming is in your own home, with your own computer.
Get
&gt; &gt; &gt;a book, read it, and try out each language feature as you go.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I completely disagree: that is the "old way". I agree that you can do
all
&gt; &gt; of the above, and succeed, but some people actually learn things at Uni.
&gt; &gt; :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I went back at age 26, and got a lot out of a Comp Sci degree. Surely,
to
&gt; &gt; disprove such a sweeping statement I need only give one counter-example.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;University never struck me as able to provide much more than facilities
&gt; &gt; &gt;and projects.  Projects, such as "write a quicksort routine", are
important
&gt; &gt; &gt;but honestly, if you need somebody else to tell you what to do then you
&gt; &gt; &gt;should admit defeat and give up now.  Facilities used to be valuable
but
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think the most of us can probably do better by ourselves.  I think a
&gt; &gt; &gt;brand new Cyrix 300MX with 32MB RAM, 4GB disk, 17" monitor, good
internet
&gt; &gt; &gt;connectivity, and Linux, at a cost of about $1100 plus internet, is
very
&gt; &gt; &gt;much better than the crappy old gear that the universities can afford.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which side of bed did you get out of? ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; BTW, I learnt heaps from those I *met* at Uni.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;The "hard" part of programming, which involves a certain logical bent
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;mind, is not something which anybody can really teach.  You can explain
&gt; &gt; &gt;it,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lots of things can be explained: that is what education is all about.
&gt; &gt; Pretending a Uni/TAFE course should be a "be all and end all" is
&gt; &gt; unrealistic. But how else could one gain exposure to so many different
&gt; &gt; concepts that are at the periphery of "real programming": by staying at
&gt; &gt; home with a PC?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Software development is not *only* about *writing* code. Or is that
&gt; &gt; different from "Programmimg" (sic) ? ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;but, well it's rather like the Nordic secret agent who was caught
&gt; &gt; &gt;spying:  They threw him into the fjords, but he just swam out; so they
tied
&gt; &gt; &gt;weights to his body and threw him back; but he floated.  So they pulled
&gt; &gt; &gt;him out, put concrete around his legs and threw him back in.  He went
down,
&gt; &gt; &gt;hit the bottom, the concrete broke and he swam away.  What they
forgot --
&gt; &gt; &gt;and this is the bit that's relevant to programming -- is that you can
lead
&gt; &gt; &gt;a norse to water but you can't make him sink.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 8-)

&gt; &gt; Cheers,
