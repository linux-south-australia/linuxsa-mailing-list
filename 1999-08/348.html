&gt; &gt; Tried it, it was rubbish.  In my considerable experience the best place to

&gt; &gt; a book, read it, and try out each language feature as you go.
&gt; 
&gt; I thoroughly agree.
&gt; 
&gt; I went to uni in '92 and it was OK. I learnt some pascal and some COBOL
&gt; and while perhaps the languages weren't so useful, the programming
&gt; concepts were. OK the COBOL was just junk from start to finish :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I went back to uni this year and it has gone to hell (IMO).
&gt; 

The advantage with Uni is that it imposes some structure and discipline
on your learning. Sure, you use languages like Pascal, COBOL and Ada,
but you will learn a lot of the less exciting, more important parts. You
will also lose out on many other important parts, but if you are someone
who wants to learn, you should be able to transfer your skills between
languages fairly easily, and pick up the bits uni misses fairly easily
(not without effort, but certainly Uni will cintribute to your learning
proces in these areas). Some of the major benefits I got from Uni were
the people. I learnt a great deal from people I met there, and I
continue learning from them. I also learnt a lot about where to find
material to teach myself other things -- different languages, paradigms,
and algorithms.

As an aside -- someone on this thread said something to the effect of
"if you can't work quicksort out for yourself, you shouldn't bother
trying". This is stupid. There are large volumes written about
algorithms (Knuth for eg), and people have spent years of their lives
investigating which algorithms work best in what situation. Take
advantage of this work. Saying that you should work all these algorithms
out for yourself is like suggesting that anyone interested in Physics
should discover Newton's laws for themselves. Yes, if you were to do
this, you would benefit greatly in your understanding, but you would be
of very limited use in the real world.

Another point that David Newall made was that many Graduates are
incompetant. Yes, this is true. The reason for this is that the Unis
have to keep lowering their stnadards to get the politically required
quantity of IT graduates. These days, getting a degree is a bit of a
joke. If you go aiming just to get a degree, you'll probably get one,
but you'll be useless. If you aim to learn, and you take it upon
yourself to ensure that you do, you can get a lot out of Uni.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I taught myself enough Perl to make myself useful in my workplace and as a
&gt; result I no longer answer phones all day. Perl is only looked at in
&gt; passing in any curriculum I've looked at (though that is a small number).

I would argue strongly against Uni's teaching Perl. A teaching language
needs to be good for teaching the concepts and stuctures involved in
programming. If it is not used much in the real world, then that is OK,
as it forces people to learn another language for themselves. After
finishing a degree, you should be able to program in almost any
language, with minimal training (you should be able to pick it up
yourself with the aid of a reference...). Basically, if a Uni focusses
on tools and individual languages then it turns into a vocational
education institution, and you miss out on the point of Uni.

&lt;snip&gt;
&gt; I think that there is no substitute for books in learning to program.

There's no substitute for a good education (which is the responsibility
of the student as much as the learning institution), good books, and
programming experience.
