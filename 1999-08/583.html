I took the easy way out!

Am using SuSe (could Suse be a play on words in German - as the english
pronunciation = sweet in German??) X server under Redhat since Suse provides
much better support for some of the newer released vid cards.

I believe this is the real benefit about linux, you can grab bits from just
about anywhere. 

The various linux distributions are basically an exercise (bar a few tweaks)
in window dressing as the core Kernels remain the same. Some are good in
some areas, weak in another. As so many opinions exist no-one distribution
will ever offer the ultimate solution. I don't think there is any such a
thing as the best linux distro.

Alan's discourse is very suitable to highlight this, and it does help put
redhat/Suse etc into perspective.

Whilst I disagree that Redhat is going MS like, my personal opinion is that
a month or so delay in release would have produced a vastly superior product
as the time would have been spent to add  extra polish and remove some of
the quirks. Admittedly, I did experience some MS like frustration for a
while but once problems fixed, this dissipates and doesn't hang around like
a Gates'ian foot odour.

I am running lots of brand new chipsets in my hardware and the crappy
drivers avail will of course lead to more issues than are usual.

I am German by descent so I guess I should be partial to Suse, but to be
honest have not gotten around to trying it as yet. Redhat has to be admired
for the manner it penetrated the linux market. 

Regards
	Tarek

&gt; After some discussions here about "what is the best linux distribution",
&gt; I thought I'd just jot down a couple of notes on my
&gt; first experiences with SuSE 6.2.
&gt; This "jotting" experience has just taken 17 hours out of my life!
&gt; Here's my little first-impressions review.
&gt; (Now I know why people get paid to do this sort of thing!)
&gt;
&gt; My motivations in getting SuSE were:
&gt;
&gt; 1.      To try to break the RedHat monopoly.

What RedHat monopoly, people have _choice_ of which distribution they use.
People _choose_ to use RedHat.
The recent sentiment that RH is becoming the "Microsoft of linux" is
rubbish.
The moment RedHat made a big showing, suddenly, it was not _alternative_
enough.
Perhaps instead of SuSe you could try HURD.
There was a time when many linux people dreamed of linux on every desktop
on every pc. RedHat has done

&gt;
&gt; 2.      To get a better linux distribution, with more stuff on it.

By this logic, for RedHat to be a better distribution it simply needs
to have more stuff packaged with it?

&gt;
&gt; 3.      To get support for my nVidia RIVA TNT2 card (and a
&gt;  cugh. Some of the explanation are very clear though.
&gt;

While I am not sure of the status of support for these cards, it does
serve as a good point for how RedHat develop drivers for linux.
The case of the i740 chipset for which many linux users needed
was looking grim as hardware manufacturers had not released
a linux driver, so, RedHat paid for the development of a driver for it.
The benifits of this flowed to all the linux community, not just redhat.
The job of creating drivers for any sort of hardware is the responsibility
of the manufacturer, not the OS vendor. If  a card is not supported then
do not buy it.

Food for thought
