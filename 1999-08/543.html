&gt;I enjoy debates. If this hasn't been noticed before, then one gets used
&gt;to it. Please note that my opinions are never humble; they are mine and
&gt;I will defend them.

Except, of course, that this stance would be inappropriate if I disagreed
with you!  :-)

As it happens, on this issue, I heartily concur, so you are out of trouble :-)

I came to Linux via the CBM64/Amiga 1000 (still the finest PC ever produced
&lt;sigh&gt;)/XT-AT-486-Pentium route, rather than from Unix.
Frankly, I had no special problems with MS systems until 95.  Since then, I
have become increasingly angered by the monopolistic and paternalistic
demand from M$ that I follow their every whim 'for my own good'.  Even NT
ain't the perfect solution is is supposed to be (we are up to Service Pack
6 bugfix so far).
I'm finding Linux quite difficult to handle, and the documentation
confusingly voluminous while lacking answers to the simplest questions (how
DO you find apsfilter?).  However, it IS a system that will provide me with
the control configurability and reliability I need, and at trivial cost.
I do NOT want a M$ version of Linux, thank you!

&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt; not having automount is one of the most
&gt;&gt; primitive aspects of Linux to date.

Has this person never heard of Mtools?  Or of fstab? A problem with Linux
documentation, perhaps?

&gt; a home directory based filesystem.

What IS supposed to be wrong with this sensible separation of one users
requirements and person files from anothers?

&gt;Nonetheless, using these tools can make one's system a black box.

A good point.  I guess my one area of sympathy with the complainant here is
that I'd like it to be simpler and quicker to be up-and-running and
productive first.  I can (and would want to) learn the intricacies of the
system later - AFTER I've written that note to Auntie Susie.

&gt;Linux offers people a choice Windows does not. 

Precisely.
