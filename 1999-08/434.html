Hi,

I run squid on my machine for only 2 computers on the network. The machine
doesn't have much ram, but I've told quid to only use about 25% of the
memory. it doesn't use my HDD spave either.

Anyway, squid was running happily for a few months, then recently squid just
wouldn't work properly. Form the client's view, i'd go to a web page, but
only part of it loads, and most of the graphics don't load either. Then
today i checked, and all squid processes died. After loading squid and
trying it out, i had the same problems, then I looked in /var/log/messages
and found these entries lots of times (obviously with differnt PIDs and
different times):

Aug 22 20:29:54 zt (squid): file_map_allocate: Exceeded filemap limit
Aug 22 20:29:54 zt squid[12490]: Squid Parent: child process 12657 exited
with s
tatus 1
Aug 22 20:29:57 zt squid[12490]: Squid Parent: child process 12664 started


I looked quickly at squid's web site, but couldn't find anything on
filemaps. Since squid worked happily for quite a few weeks/months happily, i
find this strange. Oh, using cachemgr.cgi, i can see 7874 out of 7874
filemap bits are being used, but that doesn't help me personally :(

any ideas?

thanks,
Andy
