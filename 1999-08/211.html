&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt; 
&gt; I recently installed a super drive on my comp. It's funny, but not
&gt; necessarily right, that it can be used in windows, but can't be used in
&gt; DOS.  Now, the CD-ROM in windows has been allocated as drive E:, but in
&gt; DOS drive D:.
&gt; Linux picked it up straight away, but there are some errors. I will send
&gt; you the info from "dmesg", for those interested and if there is anything
&gt; you can tell us about it, thank you very much!
&gt; 

Windows uses it's own drivers where as dos relies on the bios.
If you have a pentium or lower you bios may not currently support it. (Can
you boot off the drive?). 

I had the same problem you have (ie ls120 is d:). This was fixed
by upgrading the bios with the flash rom utility from my motherboard 
maker.

Perhaps you can do the same.
If your bios does support the drive you should be able to get it as a: or 
b: Needless to say linux did not like the drive entirely before the
upgrade. (data would copy on to the disk but be corrupted when read back).

Cheers,
