Conrad:
 
&gt; Something that the linux community doesn't seem to have acknowledged yet is
&gt; that the general user of computers...don't give a  damn about operating systems.

I agree except when they get landed with an operating system which
either doesn't work or is incomprehensible to them. 

&gt; It [Linux] is good but needs polishing which is the most difficult
&gt; stage.

Part of Linux's polishing is within its manual and help system. I enjoy
using the GNOME help browser using the "whatis" option because it pulls
together the disparate info and man pages into one document browser. It
also presents a rather unwieldy table of contents which I can look
through. It would be really good if someone ported a similar help system
as the Windows help system to Linux. I don't see a problem with this -
in my opinion the Windows standardised help system (not necessarily its
contents) is quite good and easy to use.

Currently I have help documents under:

/usr/doc
/usr/doc/FAQ (with three directories)
/usr/doc/HOWTO
/usr/doc/mini-howto
/usr/man (with more than eight directories)
/usr/info

Trying to find how to do reverse DNS in this jumble of help documents
can be quite difficult. Having all the documents in one place or at
least a tool to extract where things are will make things easier.

&gt;   I would like to see if we can promote creative discussion among this users
&gt; group

We could work with SuSe, RedHat, Caldera and the Linux Documentation
Project to create a standardised help system. I really do feel that we
need to make the manuals so much easier to read for people who don't
know much about computers or operating systems in general. There needs
to be manuals which cater for people who don't even know what "rm"
means....there needs to be a way to get to a manual BEFORE the login:
password: prompt.

In fact if it could be standardised that this particular logon:

  RedHat Linux Release 6.0(HEDWIG)
  Kernel 2.5 on an i586
  (login: as HELP with no password for help)
  (to use the Linux windows system, type "startx" after login)

  login: HELP
  password: [blank]

launched users into a "how to log on and use linux" screen it might go a
little way to stopping people from asking really basic questions and
asking how to start x. A similar, but graphical options could be
presented to those who use xdm (run level 5 on RedHat).

Linux needs to be brought to a stage where you can simply insert the
RedHat/SuSe/OpenLinux (etc) disk into the CD and it will install. It
needs to be able to reliably detect everything and reliably setup
everything with little and preferably no help from the user. To achieve
this one could be presented at the start boot screen with

  Welcome to RedHat/SuSe/OpenLinux (etc) Installation
  

  1. CUSTOM INSTALLATION
  2. STANDARD INSTALLATION 1 (use ALL hard disk space..this will destroy
all data on the hard disk[s])
  3. STANDARD INSTALLATION 2 (use AVAILABLE hard disk space...you need
at least [insert amount] of space)
  4. EXIT INSTALLATION NOW

  Enter (1 2 3 or 4): ____

In addition, I believe that it would be beneficial if KDE and GNOME
defaulted to a Windows 95 or NT style interface. Whilst some may say
that X has traditionally been used with Motif, Motif is considerably
different to what a lot of users switching to Linux on their PCs are
used to. I don't see any point in overwhelming new users with a huge
amount of differences.

I would also suggest to RedHat, SuSe and the other companies that they
produce a relatively standardised automated tutorial such as you might
see in a Windows product. It could be interactive or passive. Again,
these companies could setup a user called "tutorial" with no password.
The moment someone logged as that user a tutorial selection screen could
appear which could have options about "bash", "X Windows", "Networking",
"Setting up PPP" and so on.

Many Linux users don't want to answer really basic questions, hence the
invention of the term RTFM. There is a way we can "molly colly" users
without stressing yourself out. Computer Aided Learning can be applied
to Linux. Why don't we put a once-off effort into writing a system which
will teach new users how to do basic Linux stuff and point them in the
direction of the manuals so we can just say to them "Log in as
tutorial"? If the task is basic, easy, automated and contains relatively
static information and requires an inhumanly patient tutor, why don't we
get the computers to do it for ourselves? That way people can pace
themselves and choose whatever lessons they want to and whatever detail
that the writers of the system care to include in it.

The bigger companies such as SuSe or RedHat or Caldera could sponsor
things which had nothing to do with computing. This sponsorship could
run from the local school fete through to (perhaps) the Olympic Games.
Naturally this sponsorship would need advertising in return as all
sponsorship does. Everyone "knows" who Microsoft are...even Bill Gates
is becoming a household name. We need to make sure that everyone "knows"
what Linux is and who Linus Torvalds is. You need to get the name into
the households if not the operating system. Marketing is what will make
or break Linux; it will not be technical superiority.

Remember that Microsoft sells billions of dollars worth of technically
inferior (to Linux and Unix) products because of its marketing power and
their products ease of use to the users. They may not be easy to
administer by the computer maintenance people - Windows NT's apparent
lack of an effective scripting language is a case in point - but there
are billions more users than maintenance people. These users are willing
to pay to have their systems maintained; they're not interested in
having to adjust the /etc/hosts file manually. Either they want someone
else to do it, the computer to do it or to be able to do it in a way
understandable to them.

Perhaps I might leave it there. I guess one personal example I could use
is the way my ppp is setup. Now I know what I'm doing it's quite easy.
To setup ppp for Windows 95 was easy. I inserted the CD, waited about a
minute, told it my user name and password and it worked. Linux was not
so easy. It actually took me about 5 hours before I found a tool that
could help me (netcfg in my case). It then took me 3 hours more to work
out what to put where. I've been using computers for nearly twenty years
now and I don't consider myself computer illiterate. Even then when I
worked it out and got it going the connection was seriously slow because
by default no compression modules were aliased in /etc/conf.modules no
was compression in my basic /etc/ppp/options file. More tweaking.

I think Windows 95 (and I don't really want to say it) wins for
ease-of-use. I believe that Linux can be configured in such a way as to
be easy to use AND stable AND fast. It is a very large task to undertake
for the linux community but I think it's a task that we're capable of
and that we might even enjoy along the way. Until that time I think the
others market dominance will continue.

No one sleeps, oh Principe, god so cold
Keeping guard by the stars, you fill our hearts with the hope of love
But love is a mystery to me, my heart now grows old
Though the stars tremble at your sight I so long to meet you again!
