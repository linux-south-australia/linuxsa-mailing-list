&gt; Hello everybody
&gt;
&gt; My Linux box is dismally low on system resources, and I would like
&gt; some feedback as to what you think it is.
&gt;
&gt; My system in unbearably slow at times as it is constantly swapping to the
&gt; hard disk which is the same drive as my / /usr and /var partitions.
&gt;
&gt; When I run top, it reports that all of my physical memory (32 MB),
&gt; as well as 100 MB of my 256 MB swap is being used.  It reports that X is
&gt; using 52 MB which is 174% of my physical memory.  I am also
&gt; running Netscape Communicator, which I believe may have something to do with
&gt; my problem, top reports SIZE 18548 RSS 8368 %MEM 27.2
&gt;
&gt; I am running Red Hat 6.0, kernel 2.2.11, KDE 1.1.1, Netscape Communicator
&gt; 4.61, physical RAM 32 MB, swap 2x128 MB hard disk.
&gt; Also running XFree86 3.3.4 SVGA (Voodoo Banshee).
&gt;
&gt; Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Try isolating the problem by running just the Xserver and a window manager and
see what is reported.  Do you run a graphical login screen?  That itself
wouldn't be the problem but if you don't run one (I don't) you can boot to just

the console and start operations step by step.  Netscape isn't likely to be the

problem but X using 52 MB is.  I run a 486 with 24 MB ram (with a fast hard
drive) which tests your patience especially with KDE but it works and with
netscape running also only a total of 40 MB of memory is used.
  Has this problem just started?  Also check cpu usage.  The last time I had
strange memory usage was when I downloaded a .gz file and the computer decided
to unzip it while downloading and 60 MB of swap was used and cpu usage went
high.  That gums up the works.  Incidentally, available hard drive space was
almost nil at the time.  Also check for apps that you have closed but may still

be running.  X gnuchess has a nasty habit of continuing and gobbling cpu time.
  I can't tell you what the actual cause of the problem is but if you try some
of these things and report what you see it may give some more clues and you may

just stumble on the cause as well.

Good luck

Conrad.
