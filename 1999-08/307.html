Personally, I strongly prefer C over C++... not that I've 
really done a lot of C++.  Most people who I've discussed this 
with say "C++ is great, once you learn what works and what 
doesn't, and write your code with suitable discipline."  
To which I respond: What's wrong with writing C with 
suitable discipline?  The result is just as good, and 
there's far less traps and tricks to make you code quite 
mysterious and difficult to comprehend.  

Diving WAY down into a more philosophical discussion: C++'s 
promotion of heirarchies is a DANGEROUS thing.  Defining 
hierarchies is a fun thing to do, and sometimes it works well.  
However, C++ encorurages you to use heirarchy all the time -- 
what class do you want to inherit today? -- and this is a 
bad thing.  

Heirarchy at a very small level is good, e.g. the precedence 
of arithmetic operators, and the structure of an if/then/else 
statement is good.  Heirarchy at a substantially higher level 
is good -- e.g. the division of the various parts of a program 
into modules: the display driver, printing, perhaps save/load.  
But imposing a whole series of heirarchical steps in between 
these obviously worthwhile levels is surprisingly bad!  Yet 
this is exactly what C++ lures you in to -- your next class is 
just an inheritance and an override or two past you last class.  
When arguing this case with people, I liken the lure of the 
C++ architecture to being a bit like living in a house 
where there's a noose hanging down from every door frame!  

The measure of a good jump when choosing which levels to 
model in a heirarchy is to follow the lead of the hardware 
engineers: at each level, the next level down is so much 
less sophisticated that it merely looks like (slightly 
fancy) wires.  Also, when was the last time you saw hardware 
board layered on top of each other like a stack of plates?  
You don't -- instead, you get broad jumps -- motherboard level, 
bus card level, silicon chip on the card, macrocells inside 
the chip.  

Also note that chips are built to work as peers side-by-side 
on a circuit board.  Software designers would do well to think 
more in terms of peer-pluggable modules when designing reusable 
modules.  If you did build a component by deriving it as part 
of a fine-grained series of inheritance steps, chances are 
that the removal of any step renders all derived components 
unusable... not very reusable.  

And one last criticism of a heirarchical approach... which 
is, "WHICH heirarchy?????"  If you're forced to choose 
the heirarchy very early in the piece -- i.e. choose base 
classes and derived objects -- chances are you'll do a 
poor job and have no room to alter the structure later.  

You're better off thinking about the top level or two 
only of the problem at first, and seeing what bottom-level 
components you will obviously need that you don't currently 
have.  Go off and produce those bottom-level components as 
fast, well-documented and reusable components, and keep 
thinking about the top down while you're working.  Some 
more bottom-up components will probably suggest themselves, 
and you'll have more time to bake the top levels while you 
implement those pieces.  

Your thinking about the top levels during this process must 
be sharp-edged and demanding -- if I set the system up this 
way, can I convincingly argue (to myself) that it will cover 
all the things I need at that level?  Am I choosing the 
right amount of detail in the way I'm thinking of splitting 
up this high-level component?  

When you've been in this mode for a while, you'll find that 
your top-down decisions will be far better than if you simply 
slashed all the way down from the top to the bottom at the 
start.  Keep the middle of your problem space as a fuzzy, 
nebulous area for as long as you dare, and only split it up 
into modules when the right rift lines are making themselves 
visible.  

You'll also find that you'll quite quickly build a library 
of reusable components.  

Whew!  There's LOTS there for people to disagree violently 
with!  Fire away!  

Incidentally, if you look at the code on my web site, 
you'll see my attempts to put most of the above 
ranting and raving into practice.  If I may drop any 
pretence of modesty for a moment, I hope you'll find 
my style useful -- I've worked quite hard to write 
all the code in a clean and clear format.  The style 
is basically Modula-2 superimposed on C, with a light 
sprinkling of literate programming thrown in.  

Sadly, the programs are MS-DOS based, although they're 
written mostly in ANSI C.  These programs accompanied 
my article in the November 1997 issue of Dr. Dobb's 
Journal, titled "High-Speed Finite-State Machines".  

For a smallish introductory C file, see my DOS word 
count utility:

and for a much larger slab of code, see my regular 
expression search program, Grouse Grep:

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.grouse.com.au/clients/grouse/ggrep101.zip">ftp://ftp.grouse.com.au/clients/grouse/ggrep101.zip</A>

There's also a table-driven Huffman decoder that 
can decompress a Huffman-coded bitstream (memory/memory 
decompression) for just 14 cycles per output byte -- 
that's 25 million output bytes a second on a 350MHz 
Pentium system.  Huffman compression is quite lousy 
compared to bzip2 and gzip, of course.
