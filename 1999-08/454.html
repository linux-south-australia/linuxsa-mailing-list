1) Make sure that under /lib/net there are some modules called:

  bsd_comp.o
  deflate_comp.o

  ii) Make sure that there's an 
	alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
	alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
	alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate

	These are lines in /etc/

2) Make sure that /etc/ppp/options file contains
  deflate 15
  bsdcomp 15

3) Make sure that under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0
(substitute the right device number) that the MTU settings are high (I
set mine to the maximum of 1500)

4) Make sure that you don't have a monolithicly slow kernel. If you
haven't rebuilt it from scratch (i.e. it's still the same one as under
the distro you first installed) then *everything* not just ppp will be
going slow.

  Tips for fast kernels: 
	Under the [src]/Makefile there are two places that -O2 appear
		i) You can attempt to take this up to -O3 on a gcc only, although I
believe that egcs will go up to at least -O6
		ii) You can read the info pages of gcc under invoking&optimisations
and turn on other bits and pieces
	Mine is currently -O5 -ffast-math -fstrict-aliasing
-fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops
	
	If you do this don't forget you'll have to do it twice (it appears
twice in the one Makefile). Be aware though that your kernel will be
larger and might spill over 1024kB and/or might get a little unstable.
Mine is as stable as a rock.

	In the [src]/arch/i386/Makefile, change the -mcpu=486 or whatever to
something like:
	-march=pentium
	-march=pentiumpro

	This will compile for that particular architecture. What's the point of
having a Pentium Pro when you're compiler's building code for a 386?

***
I take no responsibility whatsoever for the above advice. If you read
the manuals (info gcc is a god send when you get into the intracacies of
tweaking optimisations and architecture specifics) you shouldn't bomb
out. 

Other considerations:

1) I rebuild all my packages by configure & make. This is so I can add
optimisations to the Makefile and again don't end up running my K6-II as
an i386.

2) I don't use Netscape to do ftp. It seems to be ineffecient, slow and
has a nasty tendency to crash about 15kB before EOF. Although it's a CLI
program, wget is very efficient, easy-to-use and copes well with system
crashes, server crashes and virtually all other type of disasters.

3) I have a small number of domain names in my hosts file. These are for
the places I always visit. Not having to use DNS can speed one's
browsing up immensely.

4) Theoretically one could attempt to rebuild pppd with a heap of
optimisations. I have never tried this option.

5) I also read (at www.linux.org somewhere) that one can setup Squid to
squash certain well-known http requests (such as anything starting with
ads....). Dispensing with banner ads certainly reduces bandwidth.

Anyway....
