NTMail isn't a Windows NT software, it's third party, and I didn't find it
very stable when I ran it either, although others may have had different
experiences. 

I prefer Linux to any two other OSs together, but companies can design
crappy code for it, too. (bloatware, as an example)

&gt; Subject: 	Mail woes
&gt; 
&gt; I thought I'd share this with you, in case anyone still needs
&gt; convincing.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't receive emails at the moment, so my daily fix of linuxsa mail is
&gt; going to have to wait. The cause????
&gt; 
&gt; From my ISP homepage:
&gt; 
&gt; "Mail Server temporarily unavailable (updated)
&gt;                           23rd August 1999
&gt; As of 4:00am this morning we have been experiencing a problem with the
&gt; Mail Server. Both SMTP and POP3 services have been effected.
&gt; This problem is currently being investigated and we hope the service
&gt; will resume shortly.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem, which we have now identified as being a fault with NTMail,
&gt; has caused considerable complications.  Administrators will continue
&gt; working until a resolution is reached.
&gt; 
&gt; We apologize for any inconvenience caused, this was however a problem
&gt; that could not be anticipated. In light of the problems we have
&gt; experienced with NTMail we are now looking into a more sophisticated
&gt; and reliable alternative."
&gt; 
&gt; (from the on-line bulletin, 17:40 23/08/1999)
&gt; 
&gt; I wonder if I try to send this will it get out. Ok, here goes nuthing
&gt; (heheh).
