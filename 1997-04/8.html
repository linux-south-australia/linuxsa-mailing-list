Since I am "the man" as some put it, some explanation would probably be useful.

THE LIST

The list address has changed to <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@liz.netcraft.com.au.">linuxsa@liz.netcraft.com.au.</A>  This is mainly
because I am changing company and will no longer be able to support the list
at adl.csc.com.au.  Also the list was beginning to cause problems on our 
machine due to some of our Overseas list members have less than reliable links
for mail.  Geoffrey is now in charge of the list.  Any request to unsubscribe,
subscribe or whatever will be passed directly to me.  Mailing 
<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@adl.csc.com.au">linuxsa@adl.csc.com.au</A> will be automatigically forwarded to 
<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@liz.netcraft.com.au.">linuxsa@liz.netcraft.com.au.</A>

THE WEB PAGES

Although previously the web pages have been hosted generously (sp) by
Michael Lambert at The Net Enterprises (A thankful plug).  The current setup
and maintenance system is less than perfect.  This is mainly due to my time
constraints and the fact I have to set up pages, ftp them to tne.net.au,
test them, make changes, ftp them, ....   Not exactly the easiest way of doing
it.  I also don't have the time at the moment to keep them updated properly.

Some other things that I would like to have is some interactive content, such
as automatically mailing list subscription, because I do not have direct access
to tne.net.au it makes it difficult for me to set things up.  I also understand
that Michael is very busy feel that it would be unfair to bug him to get things
placed in cgi-bin directories and such.

Currently I am in the process of moving (temporarily) the web pages to 
netcraft's server to allow faster updates of the pages.  Most list members 
would be aware that the web pages are getting reorganised so I stress that
this is only temporary.  When we work out what is going to be done with the
web pages then they will re-organise.  

THE DOMAIN NAME

Currently Michael has registered the linuxsa.net.au domain.  Geoffrey has
a pending application for the linuxsa.org.au.  My feelings is that because of 
the nature of the group the org.au domain is preferable.  The group does not
fit nicely into the "Network Services Provider" basket that .net.au is 
intended for.  Technically there is no real difference between what the domain
is, the "owner" of the domain can set up DNS to allow www.linuxsa.org.au to
point to (for example) a machine at tne.net.au and mail.linuxsa.org.au to be
a machine (again for example) at netcraft.com.au.  So if we can't get 
linuxsa.org.au. for whatever reason then linuxsa.net.au it will have to be.



Hope that fills in some gaps for people...
