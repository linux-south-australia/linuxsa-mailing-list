&gt; Since I am "the man" as some put it, some explanation would probably be
useful.

does all this mean u are no longer "The Man" you are now just "A Man"?? :)

&gt; THE WEB PAGES
&gt; 
&gt; Although previously the web pages have been hosted generously (sp) by
&gt; Michael Lambert at The Net Enterprises (A thankful plug).  The current
setup

thankyou thankyou :)

&gt; and maintenance system is less than perfect.  This is mainly due to my
time
&gt; constraints and the fact I have to set up pages, ftp them to tne.net.au,
&gt; test them, make changes, ftp them, ....   Not exactly the easiest way of
doing
&gt; it.  I also don't have the time at the moment to keep them updated
properly.
&gt; 
&gt; Some other things that I would like to have is some interactive content,
such
&gt; as automatically mailing list subscription, because I do not have direct
access
&gt; to tne.net.au it makes it difficult for me to set things up.  I also
understand
&gt; that Michael is very busy feel that it would be unfair to bug him to get
things
&gt; placed in cgi-bin directories and such.

i would be happy to donate an account to LinuxSA for the upkeep of the
pages... if people want..... i feel the 2Mb link i am installing will mean
the pages will be quickly accessible world wide...

&gt; Currently I am in the process of moving (temporarily) the web pages to 
&gt; netcraft's server to allow faster updates of the pages.  Most list
members 
&gt; would be aware that the web pages are getting reorganised so I stress
that
&gt; this is only temporary.  When we work out what is going to be done with
the
&gt; web pages then they will re-organise.  
&gt; 
&gt; THE DOMAIN NAME
&gt; 
&gt; Currently Michael has registered the linuxsa.net.au domain.  Geoffrey has
&gt; a pending application for the linuxsa.org.au.  My feelings is that
because of 
&gt; the nature of the group the org.au domain is preferable.  The group does
not
&gt; fit nicely into the "Network Services Provider" basket that .net.au is 
&gt; intended for.  Technically there is no real difference between what the
domain
&gt; is, the "owner" of the domain can set up DNS to allow www.linuxsa.org.au
to
&gt; point to (for example) a machine at tne.net.au and mail.linuxsa.org.au to
be
&gt; a machine (again for example) at netcraft.com.au.  So if we can't get 
&gt; linuxsa.org.au. for whatever reason then linuxsa.net.au it will have to
be.

if people want i am happy to host any domain names... or i will point it to
another machine if so desired.... may i suggest we spend a bit of time
organising  a list of "comitee members" who can decide who does what and
all that.... it will also mean things are a bit more organised as we all
(myself included) seem to be going over the same things again and
again.....

anyway... thats my bit for the day.
