&gt; To all,
&gt; Does anyone out there have a HDD that the would like to sell, or 
&gt; know where I can get a cheep one (100Mb would be great!),
&gt; or who to get in touch with?

Now would be a good time for me to put in a plug for Nick Stock who
runs Cybernet Systems (a local Linux-friendly computer supplier).
Cybernet is supplying the ftp install server for the InstallFest
(thank you Nick!).

I'm pretty sure that he has a few small HDs available, but you would
need to check with him (he should be hearing this anyway; he's on the
list).

Anyone else who wants to buy memory, network cards, etc. at the 'Fest
should also get in contact with him.  His email address is
<A HREF="mailto:nicks@lynx.net.au.">nicks@lynx.net.au.</A>

&gt; Paul
&gt; - I'm not so keen on taking 'minutes' but I can take photos :-)

Okay!  A photo-journal of the 'Fest :).  Minute-takers are still being
solicited!

&gt; Linux Wish List:
&gt; ---------------
&gt; X11                     - Yay.. finally.  
&gt; PPP                     - Is there a POP emailer for Linux

All mailers for Linux are POP-enabled once you get fetchmail running.

&gt; Browser                 - Netscape?

Or Arena or Grail or Lynx (text) or Red Baron ($, comes with RH4.1
Boxed Set).  Netscape is most people's favourite though.  Arena and
Grail aren't really worth looking at IMO.  A few people seem to like
Red Baron; it's claimed to be faster than Netscape but it only runs in
8-bit and 24-bit graphics modes (not 16-bit) which is a loss for many
people.

&gt; Word Processor          - Anything better than LaTex?

What's wrong with LaTeX?  *offended look*  :).  (I used it all through
Uni for my assignments).  Seriously, there are a few "easy to use"
things available:
- Lyx is a graphical front-end to LaTeX.
- Staroffice is a free-for-noncommercial-use word processor (and other
  stuff too I think) that is in beta last I heard.  Haven't seen it
  myself.
- Caldera sell Wordperfect for Linux (but I think you can only get it
  if you have bought Caldera's distribution of Linux).
- Caldera sell WABI which lets you run MS Office in Linux.
- Ardi sell Executor which lets you run MS Word for Macintosh in Linux
  (free demo version available).
- Red Hat sell Applixware which is Word Processor, Spreadsheet,
  Graphics, Presentation, and Email software for Linux.  We'll have a
  demo of this at the 'Fest.

&gt; Postscript to DotMatrix, Postscript interpretors
&gt;                         - Getting ps files to print!

The Red Hat Printtool makes this quite easy to set up.

&gt; Drawing Package         - better than xfig?

Gee, I really like xfig.  I think it's great, but I use it for
technical drawings.  There is Applix Graphics, but I prefer xfig over
at least the 4.2 version (but then again I prefer xfig over
CorelDRAW... is that comparing bananas and kiwifruit though??).  I
haven't played with Applixware 4.3 enough to pass judgement on it.

&gt; xv                      - Wahoo!
&gt; Running Dos Programs

dosemu

&gt; Running Windows Programs (?)

Wine (free, but is still in development) or WABI.

&gt; Games                   - any good ones out there? xtank still available?

Doom?  Quake?  I dunno, I've got too much "real work" to do :))).
