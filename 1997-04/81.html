&gt; [I'm going to summarize the points I'm replying to 'cause it was
&gt;  getting too long]
&gt; 
&gt; - Meeting places:  central, easy & close parking, vendor neutral.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed.  Vendor neutral in my mind is important.  I'm sure SENET
&gt; or TNE don't really want someone who works for a competitor (eg..
&gt; me) having a close look at their stuff (heck, I have it here at
&gt; Camtech except for that reason).
&gt; 
&gt; Aside from that, if people who run businesses don't have a problem
&gt; with it (yeah, I do and I'm a paranoid git) ISPs are an ideal
&gt; place in many ways (easy access to updates etc).

I agree with this, an ISP or similar is an ideal place 
(commercial considerations notwithstanding).  I also agree 
with the non-vendor policy during normal meetings 
(InstallFests excepted perhaps ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; - Newletters
&gt; 
&gt; Umm, maybe this is an obvious point, but most of the cost of a
&gt; newsletter is distribution and printing.  We've got webspace,
&gt; so maybe we should put it on the web, therefore no distribution
&gt; costs?  Also, we get a wider audience.

This is OF COURSE (IMHO) the obvious answer!  Also a means 
for 'sideliners' to keep an eye on the group meetings to 
see if they should be enthusiasic enough to attend...
Also may prove to be an interface to other Linux User 
Groups if it takes off... e.g. "These guys have a useful 
online newsletter, check it out.."
 
&gt; - Installfest
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I missed it too.  But driving a Lotus Elan Plus 2 around a
&gt; racetrack at 120mph was a better offer ;-).

Ah, a REAL one?? ;-)
