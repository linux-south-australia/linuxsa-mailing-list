Thanks to all you ppl who ran the installfest. Although I didn't do an install myself
(I have a Slackware 96 system that is almost stable :)) I did learn a lot. Well done to
all involved.

How did the installs go onto the laptops/notebooks (whatever they were)?? I left before
they were finished. Hopefully i will be looking to buy another PC soonish, and a laptop
with Linux has a certain appeal. :)

Also, does anyone know if there is a version of Staroffice available with the Motif
libraries statically linked? I would like to get a set off office tools together on my
Linux system, but for the low level of usage I can't justify the (very low) cost of
Applixware. 

Last, if anyone has any experience of a sony cdu31a cdrom driver, and has faced and
fixed the known problems of read errors with these horrible devices, I would be most
grateful for any hard info. Please note though that I have RTFM, as have a group of
us who have been trying to get past this little problem to no avail.

Thx again for Saturday. It was great.

Bruce
