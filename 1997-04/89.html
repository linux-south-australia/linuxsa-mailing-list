&gt; I have a PPP connection up and running, WWW browser and Telnet works
&gt; fine, but I have not got a mail system system working yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone point me to the easiest way to download email from a pop
&gt; account?

fetchmail.  It comes with Red Hat.

The description in the RPM says:

fetchmail is a program that is used to retrieve mail from a remote
mail server.  It can use the Post Office Protocol (POP) or IMAP
(Internet Mail Access Protocol) for this, and delivers the mail
through the local SMTP server (normally sendmail).

&gt; Thanks to those that helped on the day, in particular Chris, (how
&gt; unlucky can you get, two problem machines right next to each other).
&gt; 
&gt; As most of my time was spent trying to get linux to read the CD so
&gt; that we could install it, not much time was spent (in fact not any)
&gt; on the finer points of Linux ie setting up and using the various
&gt; applications.

Everybody is probably getting sick of me saying this, but I am still
soliciting suggestions for future meeting topics!  So, if there are
any various applications in particular that you would like to know
more about, let me know.

&gt; Maybe next time, if there are fewer people requiring a full
&gt; installation then an exploration of the Linux system will be
&gt; possible.

Nope, I hope the next InstallFest will be even bigger and better with
more people!  Explorations would be better done in other non-'Fest
meetings.  Or maybe that's what you meant :).
