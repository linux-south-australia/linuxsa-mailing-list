&gt; I finally get a new job selling computers and guess when they want me to
&gt; start?
&gt; Yes, you guessed it installfest day. And I was so hoping to be able to get
&gt; ppp
&gt; configured so I could access my Internet account.

Don't fret too much.  We didn't do any PPP configuration (not that I
noticed anyway :).  I think there are a few people out there who would
like to have "setting up PPP" as a meeting topic in the future (if
anyone reading this is one of those people, let me know so I know
there is some interest).

&gt; Does any one know what
&gt; the script is to log into a NT server using the network tool in X. I'm
&gt; dialling in OK but just 
&gt; not completing the handshaking phase before losing carrier. I've tried
&gt; picking up the prompts using minicom and other assorted terminals but
&gt; receive nothing in my logs that would offer a script solution if anyone can
&gt; help it would be greatly appreciated.

If the NT box is set up to use CHAP, you may need to recompile pppd
to include support for it.  I don't use NT & haven't had this problem
personally, so I'm not much help here.

Regards,
