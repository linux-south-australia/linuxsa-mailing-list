&gt; &gt; &gt; I learned a lot about IDE CD ROM drives last Saturday... I finally
&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get my CD ROM drive to work off the primary IDE port of my
&gt; &gt; &gt; PC. Many *MANY* thanks to Chris & Horst and especially Nick..
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; OK, after wrestling with that machine for most of the day,
&gt; &gt; I'm intrigued.  HOW did you finally get it to work off the
&gt; &gt; primary IDE port?  That was a very resilient machine I
&gt; &gt; remember ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it really wasn't that complex.
&gt; The system as it was had a PnP SB16 using the ternary IDE port, so to
&gt; avoid
&gt; any problems I removed it and tried to get the drive working on the
&gt; mother-
&gt; boards primary IDE port.
&gt; The drive at first, would not come up, so I went into the CMOS and found
&gt; that
&gt; the primary IDE port was disabled. Once I rectified that I still had no
&gt; success
&gt; so I took a look at the config.sys. This was loading the driver but
&gt; without
&gt; any specific parameters. This driver must scan the ternary IDE port
&gt; automatically but not the primary, so I added the /P:1F0 /I:14 options
&gt; and it
&gt; found it. (and for my next trick I will pull a rabbit out of /proc) :)
&gt; Oh yeah... And then I put the SB16 back.

Don't you hate when someone else does essentially what you 
did and it works for them ;-)  I thought the SBIDE.SYS line 
was odd also, I added /P:1F0,14,368 (or something similar 
for last value) but no such luck.  (So much for the 
readme.txt!)

BTW, did you also see the Win95 system with a similar 
problem, owned by (my apologies if my memory fails me) 
Peter(?).  BTW, the win95 'install disk' that came with my 
Creative Hex spin (and I believe is actually not required 
to detect the IDE CDROM) *only* looked for the CD on the 
Tertiary port!  Anyway, enough Micro$oft talk ;-)
