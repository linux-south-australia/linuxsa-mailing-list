(i had

&gt;
&gt; :(

Double :(       :)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; i had been looking forward to that meeting all year.  boo hoo
&gt; !~).  so when
&gt; &gt; is the next meeting planned?  are we going to have regular
&gt; meetings from
&gt; &gt; now on?  is there any barrier to this that perhaps i can help
&gt; remove?
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully we will have monthly meetings.  All we need is a cheap (or
&gt;
&gt; even free :) meeting place in a centralish location with easy &
&gt; close
&gt; parking!

There is one other (psuedo) requirement that I would like to place on a
meeting place.

That is that it be vendor free.  In that I mean, that the meeting place
should be
away from any stronlgly Linux Oriented company.  Since there will be a
number of people who
are ISP's, Linux Vendors, Hardware vendors it would be fairer to all to
keep away from housing
the meetings at a place of business.   If companies want to "peddle
their wares" then I think it should
be in a way that will not disadvantage (or give an unfair advantage)
anyone.

I am open to discussion on this point.

Although I would prefer to not have a "vendor lock"  the reality might
be that we would need to
use a business' premises due to lack of other suitable meeting place.
Michael Lambert of
The Net Enterprises has had brief discussions on using his business, and
I have heard that there
is an offer for a meeting or to at the premises of SENET.

One good thing about these premises is that there is a direct Internet
connection at both.

But If people can suggest places, it would be great.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; perhaps if there is a good following we could start pooling
&gt; resources,
&gt; &gt; charge something for membership and produce a newsletter, get some
&gt; kind of
&gt; &gt; reference library, i don't quite know, but i would like to see a
&gt; regular
&gt; &gt; group meeting.  (of course i look a bit silly saying this when i
&gt; missed the
&gt; &gt; first one myself :D)
&gt;
&gt; Agreed.  I think it would be good to charge a yearly membership fee
&gt; and produce a newsletter.  Matthew, what do you think?

Unfortunately the moment that money changes hands there is legal
implications.

Although I am no expert, I believe to allow money to change hands there
needs to be a
incorporated body and constitution etc..  Does anyone have information,
experience regarding this?

&gt;
&gt; I am willing to help with a newsletter (write articles & put it
&gt; together).

My thoughts were a bi-monthly newsletter, with overviews of the
meetings, planned meetings, articles of interest, etc.  Depending also
on peoples interest/commitment level we could have things
like door prizes.   ($2 a person,  30 people = 2  $30 gifts - Tshirt or
CD...)

Has anyone on the list been involved in the "official startup of a users
group"?

Matt
