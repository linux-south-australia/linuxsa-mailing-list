&gt;I am wondering if I am able to use a second physical(not a partition) HD

Yep, provided its an IDE drive, the second physical drive will be called
/dev/hdb. It's pretty much the same as using your first drive. (Unix doesn't
differenciate (sp.) between drives like DOS does)
Some non-IDE drives work also - check the Hardware FAQ.

BTW: For all you kernel hackers:
I have installed RedHat 4.1 and then the source that came with it. I rebuilt
the kernel to handle (amongst other things) sound and some modules I plan to
use later on.
The build went smoothly with something roughly equivalent of:

make config ; make clean ; make dep ; make zImage ; make modules ; make
modules_install

However, after using the new kernel to boot with I first get a bunch of
messages (1 for each module I tried to install):

'...Unresolved symbol in module XXXXX'

A bit later I get messages saying that the module version does not match my
kernel, which is wierd because I installed the kerneld component. (To my
knowledge kerneld is supposed to handle version mismatches) Also the version
numbers are *exactly* the same)

I can't really tell if the modules work or not (Like i said - i plan to use
them l8ter,) but they appear to install OK.

My question is: What's going on???!!!

Don't hesitate to e-mail me (<A HREF="mailto:surge@adel.tafe.sa.edu.au">surge@adel.tafe.sa.edu.au</A>) if you need more
info (like the kernel configuration or boot up sequence or whatever) That
stuff's a bit long to include here.

Thanx,
Staf
