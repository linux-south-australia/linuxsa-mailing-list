&gt; &gt; I learned a lot about IDE CD ROM drives last Saturday... I finally
&gt; &gt; managed to get my CD ROM drive to work off the primary IDE port of my

&gt; OK, after wrestling with that machine for most of the day,
&gt; I'm intrigued.  HOW did you finally get it to work off the
&gt; primary IDE port?  That was a very resilient machine I
&gt; remember ;-)

Well, it really wasn't that complex.
The system as it was had a PnP SB16 using the ternary IDE port, so to
avoid
any problems I removed it and tried to get the drive working on the
mother-
boards primary IDE port.
The drive at first, would not come up, so I went into the CMOS and found
that
the primary IDE port was disabled. Once I rectified that I still had no
success
so I took a look at the config.sys. This was loading the driver but
without
any specific parameters. This driver must scan the ternary IDE port
automatically but not the primary, so I added the /P:1F0 /I:14 options
and it
found it. (and for my next trick I will pull a rabbit out of /proc) :)
Oh yeah... And then I put the SB16 back.
