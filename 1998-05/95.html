&gt;&gt; I too would be interested to know how to sort out the AWE from a Linux

&gt;&gt; Config is: i586-200MHz, 64MBSDRAM, RH5-2.0.31-7
&gt;
&gt;there's bound to be away of programming the soundcards epprom, setting it
&gt;to manual software configurable settings instead of plug and play.

I have an AWE32, and some third-party software that lets you change IRQs,
DMA, etc. on the fly, without having to reboot in between...
This is supported by the SB16 as well - unfortunately though, the Plug n
Pray versions of these cards that I have seen no longer support this ;(

However, as far as Linux is concerned, it's all fairly easy. I'm running a
development kernel myself, which includes a specfic AWE32 module, but on
the whole it's not too different to the standard kernels.

The best thing to do is read the Soundblaster-AWE HOWTO, which will guide
you through the whole process, including sorting out the PnP if neccessary.
This can be found in /usr/doc/HOWTO/mini I think if you have RedHat 5.0
installed with extradocumentation, but obviously you should be able to
obtain this howto from the LDP or something similar.

If you really can't find it, email me privately, and I'll send it to you.
