&gt; Can anyone tell me if 420mb dis is sufficient.
It'll do, if you dedicate your puter to linux. If you have win95 on it
too, you'll still be able to run linux, you just wont be able to install
many programs.

&gt; 
&gt; Wil it be better to dedicate the computer to linux (old 486) or is it
&gt; necessary to have win 95 running on the same computer to run the programs?
you need linux to run linux programs. You need win95 to run win95
programs, unless of course you are really good with a windows emulator.
(actually, correction, you don't need linux to run linux programs, but it
helps)

&gt; 
&gt; If I dedicate the computer  do I still nbeed redhat?
most probably, seeing as you can't really just dedicate the computer to a
lone linux kernel with nothing else.

&gt; 
&gt; Will someone at next weeks meeting be selling redhat?
It's fairly easy to get hold of. There's a reseller listed on the linuxsa
page. (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A>)

&gt; 
&gt; There are many versions of redhat, i would really like to talk with someone
&gt; before I chose one?
There's the latest one, 5, which would be your best choice, seeing as it's
the easiest to set up.

&gt; 
&gt; Once I have installed redhat, and have a telstra connection (The $500
&gt; continuous phone line is what I'm thinking of) is it all simply going to
&gt; work for me??
Nope. You're going to need to set up ppp, sendmail, possibly a proxy
unless you want to pay bandwidth charges through the nose...

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt; 
Oh yes, btw, might aswell get something clear. It seems you've
misunderstood. Linux itself is an operating system, which aims for POSIX
compliance. There are various distributions of this operating system. Each
distribution has its strong points and it's weak points. Redhat is one of
these distributions. Personally, I think redhat would be a better choice
because it is easier to install, especially redhat 5.
