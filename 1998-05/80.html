Hiyas
I think i finally have the mailling list accepting my mail, despite the
fact it's been being forwarded to me for the few months though thru a
defunct account.

I have an Adaptec 1542CP fast scsi-2 card, and I'm probably about to
replace it with a friends PCI scsi card.
I've been using this card for a while, and it's been pretty good to me as
far as driver support, etc. goes, and it keeps up, despite being ISA and all.

However, this new card is going to be a 'Symbios Logic' card. Apparently
the chipset onboard reads that it is a NCR53C810A/60. I found what appears
to be a driver for this in the 2.1.101 kernel I am running. It certainly
has a lot more options available than the 1542 did... And i was wondering
if anyone could explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous
transfers with SCSI, and although I understand command queueing, should I
be using it with my scsi cdr and sometimes drives and scsi cdroms?
There is an option to adjust the timing period for the card, which
according to the help changes the transfer speeds accross the SCSI
bus....So can i just run at maximum speed, 10Mb/sec, or will this fail? Is
it a trial & error thing, or is the reccommended 1/2 speed a good idea?


And last of all - Would anyone be interested in buying a second hand
Adaptec 1542CP scsi card? It has an internal 50pin connector, and a
hi-density 50pin external connector. On-card centre termination is
automatic, or manually selectable. It is a plug'n'pray card, but it's
actually been very good. And if you don't like that, you can override those
by using dip switches.

Anyway, thanks, and I hope this works now,
Toby
