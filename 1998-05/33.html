&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm running a 486-DX2-66 with 32mb ram and Slackware 3.1 as the office
&gt;internet proxy and firewall... the proxy software I am using is SQUID,
&gt;which I have found to be a preety good program, in that it is giving us
&gt;good internet access times for 30 users in the office going out over a
&gt;single 33kbps link to our isp... however, I have noticed using the top
&gt;command that the amount of RAM that squid uses gradually increases after
&gt;a reboot - starting out fairly low - around 5% of RAM, and gradually
&gt;increasing until it's using about 33% of available ram... by this time
&gt;there is typically only about 500-800kb RAM left unused, and it is then
&gt;I notice things start slowing down... also, soxified programs (we're
&gt;using socks 5 to get past our own firewall) don't work properly once the
&gt;available ram is &lt; 1mb... this is something of a problem... a 486 with
&gt;32mb ram _should_ be quite sufficient to act as such a gateway/proxy,
&gt;but what this ram problem means is I have to reboot the machine every 4
&gt;days or so... the longest I've been able to go so far is about 14 days
&gt;before a re-boot was necessary... but by then, the internet access was
&gt;crawling along... does anyone know if SQUID has a memory leak problem...
&gt;that's what seems to be suggested by the gradual increase in system
&gt;resources - esp. ram.... but it may be related to the web pages being
&gt;cache'd... (that's my guess anyway)....
&gt;
&gt;thanks in advance for your suggestions....

I assume you're talking about the amount of memory the squid process is
using. We used Squid on a BSDI system at an ISP I used to work at, and we
enountered the same problem. While I cannot recall the exact command that
we used, I believe is was either calloc of malloc or a similar command.
This freed up the memory that squid had tied up, but wasn't actually using.
ON another note, I am presently unemployed and looking for work at an ISP
or similar, in either the systems admin or tech support fields. Can anyone
help me?
Hope this helps.
