I have a number of questions so I'll ask them all in one hit, and maybe
somebody will have the answers, or at least some helpful pointers.

1.  I want to use my Linux box for Internet access, but at present my
ISP has a byte limit of 25mb/week. I would like to know if it is
possible to set up a byte (download and upload) counter in Linux, or
whether I will have to stick with my windoze box (which does have a byte
counter for modem activity) until my account runs out and I get
something else.

2.  I have noticed that Netscape 4 (shipped with Red Hat 5) drops out
seemingly at random. I have seen the same thing on the Unix system at
Uni, where netscape simply disappears from the screen. Is there a
solution, or a patch to stop this from happening?

3.  The screen fonts become "garbled" after about half an hour of
X-Windows activity. Logging out (ctrl-alt-backspace) and back in again
fxes the problem for another half an hour. I am running an S3-Virge with
4mb RAM, Metro-X and FVWM with the Afterstep window manager. To explain
the problem more, the fonts become unreadable and trashed. Any graphics
on the screen remain unaltered.

4.  I am looking for good, and reasonably priced (free, or dirt cheap)
engineering software for Linux. If there are any engineers who know of
good logic design and simulation, or analog electronics type programs,
would you please let me know.

If you need additional information, email me, and I will do my best to
get it to you.

Thanks in advance,

Adam Hawes...

If only the good die young, then I'm gonna live forever.
