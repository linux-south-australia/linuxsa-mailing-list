&gt; After I posted the original message to the list I spent a few hours on the
&gt; net. I finally found references to xclients on a Samba bulletin board
&gt; somewhere. I went to Starnet and downloaded a demo of X-win32. Installed the
&gt; app and spent an hour or so fumbling around with the setup dialogues. I'm
&gt; new to Linux/Unix, and this is all brand new territory for me, but I got the
&gt; xclient working quite easily. In fact I'm constantly suprised at what I've
&gt; been able to achieve with Linux; amazing O/S.

Good to hear!  (BTW, you run the X _server_ on NT, the X clients like
xearth, xfishtank, etc. run on Linux and connect to the X server to
get displayed on your screen)

&gt; Yes we need to use Oracle, it's the corporate database. [SA Government] We
&gt; plan to do some development work with an Oracle database connected to a Web
&gt; server to enable on-line reporting. I'm experimenting with Linux and Apache
&gt; at home [no problems with EDS that way:-)] to see whether they are a viable
&gt; combination, but not yet sure what we might use as middleware.
&gt; 
&gt; The Oracle people will probably recommend a Sun SPARC/Solaris solution
&gt; running Oracle Web server, Designer 2000, and Oracle 8. I'm attending one of
&gt; their courses next week so will find out more then.
&gt; 
&gt; What is SCO and iBSC?

SCO is like Linux, but it isn't open, it isn't free, and it's not half
as good.  iBCS is the Intel Binary Compatibility Standard which lets
you do stuff like run SCO applications under Linux without recompiling
them.
