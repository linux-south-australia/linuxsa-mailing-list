&gt; 1.  I want to use my Linux box for Internet access, but at present my
&gt; ISP has a byte limit of 25mb/week. I would like to know if it is
&gt; possible to set up a byte (download and upload) counter in Linux, or
&gt; whether I will have to stick with my windoze box (which does have a byte
&gt; counter for modem activity) until my account runs out and I get
&gt; something else.

IP Accounting should do the job:
ipfwadm -A in -i -W ppp0

Use "ipfwadm -A -l" to list the rules and counters. There are lots of
other options you can use with ipfwadm.

This alone won't do it however. If you reboot during the week the counters
will be lost so you need to record them in a file everytime you shutdown.
You will either have a write a couple a of scripts to manage the counters,
or find a package which does it for you. Does anyone know of a package
which can do this sort of thing easily? I have some scripts which work for
me but they are very hackish and I doubt they would work in any other
situation :).

"pppstats" and "ifconfig ppp0" will also return link usage. However they
will only work while the ppp link is running, so IP accounting is probably
better.

&gt; 2.  I have noticed that Netscape 4 (shipped with Red Hat 5) drops out
&gt; seemingly at random. I have seen the same thing on the Unix system at
&gt; Uni, where netscape simply disappears from the screen. Is there a
&gt; solution, or a patch to stop this from happening?

Redhat 5 has Netscape 4.04 doesn't it? Netscape 4.05 was released a while
ago. I run Netscape with Java & Javascript turned off. It has never
crashed on me like this. With Java & Javascript turned on it tends to be a
little unstable :(.

You could try telling Netscape to use different libraries instead of the
libc and libxpm that come with Redhat. There are a few pages on the net
which describe how to wrap Netscape in this way. They also provide the
libraries which have been specifically compiled to try to minimize the
bugs in Netscape. It may work for you, it may not..

&gt; 3.  The screen fonts become "garbled" after about half an hour of
&gt; X-Windows activity. Logging out (ctrl-alt-backspace) and back in again
&gt; fxes the problem for another half an hour. I am running an S3-Virge with
&gt; 4mb RAM, Metro-X and FVWM with the Afterstep window manager. To explain
&gt; the problem more, the fonts become unreadable and trashed. Any graphics
&gt; on the screen remain unaltered.

Does the same thing happen under the XFree server? My experience with
the MetroX server distributed with Redhat 4.2 wasn't too good so I went
back to XFree. I have heard that many people were happy with MetroX tho'.

&gt; 4.  I am looking for good, and reasonably priced (free, or dirt cheap)
&gt; engineering software for Linux. If there are any engineers who know of
&gt; good logic design and simulation, or analog electronics type programs,
&gt; would you please let me know.

There is a directory under <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux</A> which has a lot
of engineering related software in it. Also have a look at the SAL pages,
"Scientific Applications on Linux" or something like that. There should be
a link to it from the webwatcher <A HREF="http://webwatcher.org/.">http://webwatcher.org/.</A>

Mark
