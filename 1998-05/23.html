Shane,

The library you are using appears to be line buffering, which is to say
that it appears to be trying to read a complete line before returning
control to your program.  Buffering a Good Thing(tm) and is the reason
for stdio.  It seems the library is reading the next line before returning
the \n from the first line.  This is irritating, to say the least.  I'm
sure it's a bug, and it seems that later version of the library have fixed
it.

On the other hand, fetching character by character using scanf is probably
not the right way to do what you want.  For example, please don't think
that you could use it for single-key menus, because you can't.  Stdio does
not work like that, which I already said.  You can fetch character at a
time, but you must input line at a time.

Character at a time input is better done with termio.

David
