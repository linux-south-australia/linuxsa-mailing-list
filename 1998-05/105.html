Hello to all,
I'm very new to linux so please be gentle with me.....
Can anyone help me with a few things?
Problem 1:
I'm having problems with getting my mouse to work with Linux -Redhat5.
It used to work but for some reason won't work at all 
I can get it to work when linux fires up,ie cursor moves when GPM loads at
boot, but as soon as I go to Xwindows it stops dead...no movement or button
function....
Any Ideas?
Problem 2:
I am trying to get my moden to work under linux...it's a Digicom Connection
144DF internal and I can't seem to make it go under Red Hat 5...
I know it does work under linux as I had it working when I had a
distribution of linux called Minilinux...
The modem is unusal in that it requires a file to be downloaded to it
before it works - this was done when the computer booted from dos in the
usual way via autoexec.bat...
This Minilinux version sat in a C:\Linux directory under Dos, and because
linux worked from this directory I had no problems with it...eg MINICOM
worked a treat...

Now I have Red Hat 5 it is another ballgame...I am assuming that because
I'm booting LILO from the / partition, Dos does not fire up and therefore
no autoexec.bat...!!!!
I tried another method of booting, by using Linuxloader 98 and booting
linux from Win95, the thinking being that I had downloaded the file to the
modem via autoexec.bat in the initial startup of the computer in windoze...

How can I go about downloading the file to tha modem from linux?
Can I put tha DOS file somewhere in the /dev directory of linux?
How exactly would I go about doing this?
Any Ideas?

Hope someon can help
Cheers from Andrew, VK5KAW
