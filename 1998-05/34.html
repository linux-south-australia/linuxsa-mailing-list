Yer, that response to my cry for help was overwhelming! I got it working
at last, the DPT driver was prefixed with something that must have made
me skip past it in my haste. As for donating the old computers to
charity - who in the hell do you know who would want a 486DX33 that's
got not monitor, floppies and the case is graffitied and all? I only
smashed up the cases once they were emptied - we're using ALL the parts
(even the screws - can never have enuff of them) for spares, so there's
no waste. And as for the guy who was babbling on about intranets and
StateNet or something - what the hell are you talking about? Craig, the
pro. admin guy (i'm just a lousy student) says he's never heard of such
a thing. But, the IP for our server is 210.8.25.3, there's no site. Just
FTP access for students and staff.

Once again, thanks for that marvellous help. I think i can work the rest
out from here... =]
