Okay, so i'm a newbie. I love linux, but i don't know much about it. I
guess i'm one of them anti microsoft people with little or no basis for
my hatred of them - even though i use their products - talk about
hippocritical =]

neway, here at willunga we are setting up a small linux box to see how
it will handle all of our internet stuff compared to NT. This week we
acquired 12 new 686/P200+'s to replace our ageing 486DX33's (Shock!
Horror! Gasp!) They've been there for about 6 years now. The good thing
is that i got to pull them apart for spare parts and smash up the
useless parts like the cases and 5 1/4" drives =] I assembled a box to
run linux from a network card here, a video card there and a
motherboard+4GB HDD from a stolen server that was recovered. We want to
use it mainly as a proxy sever for WWW, then later add email to it. It
was all assembled and working well - then came the time to put RH5 on.
Lo and behold it had no support for the DPT SCSI controller that the
CD-ROM and 4GB were hooked up to. The model is PM2044W. I got it on by
borrowing a IDE CD-ROM from another computer. I now want to setup the
SCSI devices so we can use them. I was wondering if anyone knows if any
Linux drivers exist for the specified SCSI card? And if so where can i
obtain them (obviously) and how do I add them to the system?

I'd be EXTREMELY grateful to ANY advice that i can get.
