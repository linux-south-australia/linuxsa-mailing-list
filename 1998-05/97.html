<H1>Sound - MPU401 configuration</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I've had endless problems with my sound configuration.  Every second time I
recompile my kernel it just stops working.  I'm sure that the problems are
my own fault, but I try to go through EVERY option with a fine-toothed comb,
and configure every option perfectly.

The error message I get is "Sound:  IRQ-1 already in use", and catting one
of those info files in /proc (can't remember which one) tells me that the
MPU-401 is trying to use IRQ-1.  But my soundcard isn't configured for
IRQ-1!  It's set at IRQ 7, DMA 5 and 1, IO 220h.  It's a Creative Vibra16
PNP, and window$ loves it.  I'll have to try isapnp.

I'm probably just missing something somewhere.  I'll have a closer look.
But if anyone can solve my problem with a magic wand, please come forth and
do so.

My other major hassles with initial linux setup on my machine was the mouse.
It USED to be a two-or-three-you-decide-there's-a-switch-on-my-butt button
"protech" mouse, and would work perfectly in three button mode under X
(using metro's driver) but GPM hated it.  Two buttons worked fine.  But, of
course, not in X.

I recently upgraded to a "proper" mouse - an
I'll-decide-how-many-buttons-I'll-have-coz-I'm-smarter-than-your-last-mouse
Genious mouse, which works perfectly in windows, and in dos, and in X, but
again I had hassles with GPM.  I've configured it as a Mouse Systems mouse,
but when I boot linux I need to restart gpm with "gpm -k; gpm" before it'll
spring to life.

I dunno.  Life's too hard.
