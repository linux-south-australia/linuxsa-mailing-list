&gt; I have only just installed Redhat 4.2 on my system and I'm pretty sure I
&gt; set everything up correctly but when I go to run sdoom I get a
&gt; mouse_init() failed signal and the whole system locks.  I have gone
&gt; through all the config's that I can find linked to sdoom and disabled
&gt; the mouse in all of them, I have even tried disabling GPM.  
&gt; 
&gt; Now my mouse works fine in X11, and I even get a mouse cursor in shell,
&gt; sdoom just seems to hate it!  

I don't like the way Redhat has doom set up by default.

* Edit /etc/vga/libvga.conf
  - Force your type of mouse
  - Force normal vga. Force your video card only if you know what you are
    doing. Svgalib doesn't have decent support for many cards. More recent
    version of Svgalib are better, but Redhat don't ship them :(.

* Edit ~/.doomrc to your liking. In particular check the mouse setup
  2/3 button etc..

* Redhat uses /dev/cua? for the mouse, change to ttyS?. Do:
  - cd /dev
  - rm mouse
  - ln -s ttyS? mouse

  Change the ? to whatever port you mouse is on.  My mouse, like most
  people is on ttyS0 (COM1). This will break any mouse programs
  (X,gpm,svgalib) that use /dev/cua? instead of /dev/mouse.  All
  distributions I've seen use /dev/mouse.  If a mouse program does break,
  just tell it to use /dev/mouse instead of what it was using before.

  The cua devices will not exist in the v2.2 kernel so you might as well
  start using ttyS? :).

* If the "musserver" doesn't work for you rename it to "musserver-old". It
  is located under /usr/lib/games/doom

* Edit /usr/games/rundoom to your liking. If anyone wants my script mail
  me and I'll send it to you. It does a few simple things like auto detect
  sound, puts save games under ~/.doom instead of ~, and recovers the
  keyboard/screen if doom/svgalib crashes.

Hope this helps..

Regards,
Mark
