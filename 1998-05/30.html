<H1>SQUID using more and more ram...</H1>

Hi all,

I'm running a 486-DX2-66 with 32mb ram and Slackware 3.1 as the office
internet proxy and firewall... the proxy software I am using is SQUID,
which I have found to be a preety good program, in that it is giving us
good internet access times for 30 users in the office going out over a
single 33kbps link to our isp... however, I have noticed using the top
command that the amount of RAM that squid uses gradually increases after
a reboot - starting out fairly low - around 5% of RAM, and gradually
increasing until it's using about 33% of available ram... by this time
there is typically only about 500-800kb RAM left unused, and it is then
I notice things start slowing down... also, soxified programs (we're
using socks 5 to get past our own firewall) don't work properly once the
available ram is &lt; 1mb... this is something of a problem... a 486 with
32mb ram _should_ be quite sufficient to act as such a gateway/proxy,
but what this ram problem means is I have to reboot the machine every 4
days or so... the longest I've been able to go so far is about 14 days
before a re-boot was necessary... but by then, the internet access was
crawling along... does anyone know if SQUID has a memory leak problem...
that's what seems to be suggested by the gradual increase in system
resources - esp. ram.... but it may be related to the web pages being
cache'd... (that's my guess anyway)....

thanks in advance for your suggestions....

regards
