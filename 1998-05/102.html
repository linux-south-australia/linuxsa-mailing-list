hello

&gt; During 'make modules', something like: 
&gt; 		...unused variable..
&gt; flashed across the screen too quickly for me to copy down onto my diary.

that's ok. that's just an unused variable in one of the routines that the
author forgot to delete from the source code. this won't effect anything. 


&gt; During 'make modules_install', I got one line that says:
&gt; 		cp: sound_syms.0 : No such file or directory

did 'make' report an error after this?


&gt; After the usual mv'ing and lilo'ing and then rebooting, I can't get anything 
&gt; out of my soundcard (obviously!) but where did I go wrong??

this is just some general advice, but if you are sure that you did
everything to the letter, and you believe it's the distributions fault (or
due to lack of instructions), then i would do a grep on "sound_syms.0" in
the generated makefiles to find out where it's looking for this file. then
i'd have a look at that install script to determine where this path came
from, and then refer back to the install instructions to see if i had
stuffed up, or if there was any particular instructions to modify this
path. 

It sounds a very easy problem to fix. it's probably just a matter of
configuring something in the distribution.
