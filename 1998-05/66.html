&gt; Can anyone tell me if 420mb dis is sufficient.

Sufficient for what?  420MB is sufficient to run Linux and do lots of
stuff, but it's not sufficient for a bundle of other stuff too.  It
all depends on what _you_ want to do with it.  I live my computing
life on Linux, so I need many gigabytes; someone else might just use
it as an Internet gateway and have it doing what they want in 40MB.

&gt; Wil it be better to dedicate the computer to linux (old 486) or is it
&gt; necessary to have win 95 running on the same computer to run the programs?

It's not necessary to have Win95 running on the same computer.
DOS/Windows and Linux are completely separate operating systems.  You
can have either or both on there -- whatever you want.

&gt; If I dedicate the computer  do I still nbeed redhat?

If you want to run Linux, you'll need some sort of Linux distribution.
Red Hat is one of them, but there are others such as Debian and
Caldera.

&gt; Will someone at next weeks meeting be selling redhat?

The company I work for sells Red Hat Linux, so I'd be happy to sell
you a copy at next weeks meeting if you want one.

&gt; There are many versions of redhat, i would really like to talk with someone
&gt; before I chose one?

I think you're asking about different distributions of Linux, not
different versions of Red Hat?  Anyway, come along to the meeting on
Tuesday and ask away!

&gt; Once I have installed redhat, and have a telstra connection (The $500
&gt; continuous phone line is what I'm thinking of) is it all simply going to
&gt; work for me??

I'll leave this one for someone else.
