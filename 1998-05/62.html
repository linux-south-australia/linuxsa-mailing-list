Subject: Re: Xwindows on an NT client


&gt;&gt; Can I run an Xwindows session on the NT Workstation? My telnet software
&gt;&gt; [KEA] only supports a character based session. If it can be done what
&gt;&gt; software do I need?
&gt;
&gt;You need an X server for NT.  There are a few commercial ones out
&gt;there, but not being an NT user myself, I'm unable to recommend one.


After I posted the original message to the list I spent a few hours on the
net. I finally found references to xclients on a Samba bulletin board
somewhere. I went to Starnet and downloaded a demo of X-win32. Installed the
app and spent an hour or so fumbling around with the setup dialogues. I'm
new to Linux/Unix, and this is all brand new territory for me, but I got the
xclient working quite easily. In fact I'm constantly suprised at what I've
been able to achieve with Linux; amazing O/S.

&gt;&gt; Finally, and completely unrelated to the above; does anybody know if
Oracle
&gt;&gt; 7 - Oracle 8 will run on the Linux O/S. And if it does, do you know
anyone
&gt;&gt; who is actually running such a setup.
&gt;
&gt;The SCO version of Oracle will apparently run on Linux (using iBCS),
&gt;but there is no Linux port (at least not one that has been released).
&gt;Do you require Oracle?  There are a number of databases available
&gt;natively for Linux.

Yes we need to use Oracle, it's the corporate database. [SA Government] We
plan to do some development work with an Oracle database connected to a Web
server to enable on-line reporting. I'm experimenting with Linux and Apache
at home [no problems with EDS that way:-)] to see whether they are a viable
combination, but not yet sure what we might use as middleware.

The Oracle people will probably recommend a Sun SPARC/Solaris solution
running Oracle Web server, Designer 2000, and Oracle 8. I'm attending one of
their courses next week so will find out more then.

What is SCO and iBSC?

Regards, Steve
