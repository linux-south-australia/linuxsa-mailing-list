Just out of curiosity,

Isn't the SA Government's Pathways SA program supposed to do all of this
sort of thing for schools statewide?

If not for your school, perhaps you should look into the way they have
everything set up. Basically a Cisco 2600 series router with the two
ethernet interfaces. One for the curriculum network and one for the
administration network.

At my school I just added a Linux box with Squid to cache everything as we
get charged for downloads.

The Cisco works very well so far (mind you, we had to replace the 1st one
'cause it got fried by a surge or something) and I have no complaints with
its ISDN stuff. Mind you, we have only two small blocks of IP addresses
and no BGP, multihoming etc.

Cheers,
Sam.

&gt; Is there anyone using Linux as an ISDN router happily? I'd like to look
&gt; into it, as we have a single LAN and an ISDN connection to the 'net. We
&gt; may need to buy a new router soon though. What kinds of hardware is
&gt; needed for 128Kb ISDN? I don't know that much about ISDN? any pointers
&gt; to like a Linux-ISDN-HOWTO?
