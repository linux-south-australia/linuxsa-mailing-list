Hi,

Probably the best place to post this to is aus.net.access.

Both carriers have no plans to come to Adelaide, but i do hear that ASDL is
on it's way.... (apparently 8Mbit down/1Mbit up) :)

Subject: [mostly OT] Cable Internet access


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; First off, do people know who provide cable internet access, and wether
it's
&gt; possible use these connections from a linux box?
&gt;
&gt; Optus's cable service's web page says it's only available in the eastern
&gt; states, but doesn't say when/if it'll ever be available in SA (or at least
I
&gt; couldn't find it). Telstra's web site had me believe that's it's available
&gt; in all states (there wasn't any mention of which states it was available),
&gt; but when I called for more info, they told me it's not available here.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any other cable providers? any in SA?
&gt;
&gt; Also, if any cable service does come to SA, will we be able to use it from
&gt; our Linux boxes? I don't see why not, but (as usual), the only 'supported'
&gt; platforms are Windows 9x/NT and the Mac. like I said, I don't see why it
&gt; wouldn't work, since it uses an ethernet interface (I don't know the
correct
&gt; term), but from what I read, there's some software that you need to
install,
&gt; and perhaps they somehow check if you're running it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the info, and sorry that it's off topic. Is there perhaps a
&gt; better e-mail list to post this to? This is the only mailing list I'm
&gt; subscribed to (and that I know of that's Australian) :)
&gt;
&gt; Andy
