Hi Richard,
I have 3 clients that would like to give Sybiz the flick. In fact, one
of my clients recently went to a GST conference put-on by Sybiz for
Sybiz users.
Talking amongst themselves, the users comments were that Elite II /
Vision products were a crock of !@#$#%%^^.
I have 1st hand experience installing, running, using Sybiz products &
can back-up the above statement.
I would be very interested in having a chat with you about this one.

My clients run OS/2 on the desktop, but that's OK, they can run
XWindows, Java, WWW Browser, Telnet.
OS/2 is fully RFC compliant, so a Linux, SCO Unix or BSD, server-based
accounting solution would fit-in beautifully. Run it on its own server,
simple. Anyhow, it is the accounting system, business is about
accounting, without-it you're screwed, so running it with an Internet
gateway / Samba Server / lpd server is just asking for trouble.

The reality is there seems to be a void for a WAN, 10-50 user accounting
system. Sure, 50+ there is plenty, with a price to suit, running on
Solaris, AS/400, RS/6000.
