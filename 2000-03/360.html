PS.
I forgot to mention something very important in that
last note about using linux in the "real world".

"smbclient" was a real dream.
I used it for printer access, which was excellent, and
totally necessary - a sine qua non, for sure.
That worked flawlessly, except that when I changed
from a single-sided printer to a double-sided printer
(and HP 8000 something-or-other), it always waited
5 minutes before printing the last page.
I tried adding control-D at the end of documents,
but it didn't help.
The main point, though, is that it made linux in
that environment _possible_.

The second thing that smbclient did was really remarkable.
It allowed me FTP-like access into their servers,
once I worked out how to turn servers/services/shares
into command-line options.
It was stunningly fast and fully functional.
Without this, I would have had to deliver my
outputs on 20 floppy disks!

Now if only the linux backwards-compatibility
department had as much compatibility in the
documents area as in the SMB protocols area!
Then half the "other" OS users would be on linux
by next Christmas (2001, that is).

Cheerio, must rush...
Alan Kennington.
