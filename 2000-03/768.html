&gt; &gt; Nope. That's a high beep then low beep, indicating it found the card

&gt; 
&gt; Yes you are correct.  Brain now on..... hopefully.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm still little confused as to what is happening.  Is the cardmgr is
&gt; detecting the card correctly (ie. does 'cardctl ident' return the
&gt; correct information)???

Nope. Unknown card. It's the same with any 3c589b I try. I can sometimes
get it to detect (thankfully) and bring up the interface.

&gt; 
&gt; If the cardmgr doesn't know which card it is then how does it know
&gt; which driver to load??  Normally it gets the identity (manfid) info
&gt; once a card is inserted.  Then from the PCMCIA configuration
&gt; determines which type of card it is and from this what module and
&gt; script to run.  If cardmgr cannot detecting what type of card it is
&gt; then why is it loading a driver???

It doesn't leave the manfid in the log it usually does
(/var/log/messages on my redHat systems). This be the question I have
been asking. I really don't get it. It loads the memory_cs driver
instead of the 3c589_cs driver. I have tried commenting bits out of
/etc/pcmcia/*, tried deleting /lib/modules/2.2.xxx/pcmcia/memory_cs.o.
It's looking very much like the

thx for your help. Any ideas?

Matt

P.S. I've also tried unloading any modules and restarting pcmcia card
services in case of conflict.
