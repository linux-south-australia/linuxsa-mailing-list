&gt; Our company is moving office soon, and it looks quite likely that
&gt; we'll be installing a 128k ISDN link to connect ourselves to the
&gt; Internet via Telstra.  I'm thinking of using an old box running
&gt; Linux as a router rather than buying a dedicated router.  We're not
&gt; likely to be routing huge volumes of data (I'm expecting loads to
&gt; average around 30-40kbps and peak at 100kbps occasionally).  Are
&gt; there any serious pitfalls in doing this?  Does the speed of the box
&gt; have any significant impact?  Would I be better off biting the
&gt; bullet and buying a proper router?

SUMMARY: Buy a router.

ISDN = Integrated Services Digital Network (It still does nothing)
SAIX = South Australian Internet Exchange
BGP = Border Gateway Protocol
AS = Autonomous System
FUD = Fear Uncertainty Doubt
TA = Terminal Adapter

Linux router boxes are great in theory, and on spec, there is really
no reason not to use one as they can route, support many routing
protocols (through gated), and have ISDN interfaces which the kernel
supports.

In reality however I have found that there are always problems. ISDN
is an ugly and complex beast at the best of times, and my last Linux
router project involved building a Linux router box to connect to SAIX
and pull down the SAIX BGP mesh. Believe it or not, the setup of gated
and BGP was actually not very hard and worked like a charm. I
connected to an ISDN router that was 3 AS's away from the SAIX switch,
yet after about 10 seconds I had a beautiful working routing table.
(about 150-200 routes from memory?)

It's not big deal to see a large routing table on a router, but to see
the output of a route command on a Linux box produces screen after
screen of text is very very cool. Its also a great example of open
source software doing exactly what it was meant to do, and doing it
efficiently and without fuss or fanfare. The setup was not hard, but
an understanding of BGP was required, as you'd expect. Just another
reason why I believe that a GUI does NOT mean 'easy to use', but I
digress...

The problem with the router box was the ISDN card, and its
reliability.  Once packets were flying around and the kernel was under
load, the system was amazingly unstable. It just wasn't up to the
task. The ISDN code was still quite buggy, as were the ISDN tools. The
documentation and support for the ISDN card and code was poor. This is
why I recomend a router.

As I said before, Linux probably could do the task quite well, it
would just require a bit of effort. The real world experience with
Linux as an ISDN router was vastly different to the theoretical
capabilities of the system. This is the phenomena that so many of us
see every day when we look at Linux systems in the field compared with
NT systems. You can argue all day which one one is better, but
up-times, speed and client satistafction speak louder that some of the
best FUD.

A proper ISDN router is a well honed tool for a specific job. Unless
budgets don't allow it, a Linux box is better put to use elsewhere.
The ISDN router needs to be reliable, and fast. It needs to stay
connected and up for years at a time. With the price of second hand
routers now far less than a PC with an ISDN card, an old router is the
way to go.

Companies like Cisco Systems and 3Com have been 'doing routers' for
years. With ISDN being so complex and buggy, it's a good idea to leave
the development to them and benefit from this by using a router.
Cisco's ISO version 12.0 still had major ISDN bugs right up to release
6. It's a complex and horrible technology to have to become familiar
with, and with a router, then most you need know about the internals
of ISDN is which version of the router code is the most stable.

Another factor to consider is documentation and support. The
documentation that the big companies offer is second to none. There
are sample configs, white papers, tech notes, discussions, sample
topologies, etc. And with some second hand routers you can even get a
maintenance contract so if you DO have a hardware failure or a config
issue, you can get support 24/7.

To conclude, I'm not having a go at Linux. Anyone who knows me knows I
wouldn't do that! It just that age old argument such as the tests and
benchmarks being run on Linux and NT and the flame wars about which
one is better and which one isn't. Of course we all know what happens
when you drop the two machines side by side in the field.

It's the same with routers.

They just work.

 
&gt; If I was to go the Linux router option, can anyone recommend a good,
&gt; locally available and Linux friendly, ISDN Terminal Adapter??

Telstra should supply the TA. I would reccomend a Cisco 1003, since I
have seen them second hand for well under $1000. Check out the
Connect.com second hand ISP hardware page.
