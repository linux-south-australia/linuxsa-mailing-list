Hi Andrew,

&gt; ... or does each member play an active part in developing the standards or something?!

This is not a conference, it is a meeting.  The aims of the two are
very different.  Every attendee at the meeting is expected to pull
their weight; Australians more so than others, since they are the
hosts.

You are expected to have read the lastest Internet Drafts for every Working
Group meeting you attend and to have tracked the e-mail discussions.

What I suggest you do is go and see your networking lecturer and ask them
to arrange for some of the people to give a guest lecture on their field
at the uni.  Meeting attendees are usually happy to do this, but you will
need to fit in with their timetable.

I'm having dinner with some of uni lecturers and IETF meeting attendees
at the Advanced Internet Workshop on Friday, so I'll see what I can arrange.
Are there any particular people or topics that are of great interest?

When is the LinuxSA meeting this month?  And would people sit through
a talk on OS optimisation for video applications?
