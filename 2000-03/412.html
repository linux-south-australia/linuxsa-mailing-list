&gt;do you mean to say that their OS's couldn't edit text files? :)

Remember my experience of clients who could not read a file called
'readme', and said the file was corrupt?  I changed the name of the file to
'readme.txt' and they said 'thank you, the new file you sent was OK'.   Doh!
Problem: Windoze and Mac users are trained into blind dependence - the OS
doesn't even show any extensions, so 'readme' and 'readme.txt' look the
same, most of the time. :-(  The OS looks at the (invisible) extension to
decide what to do.  No extension, or unrecognised extension, error message.
The philsophy thus becomes 'If click doesn't work, the file must be no
good' :-(

BTW, had Applixware 5 (even the beta release) been available to Alan at the
time, he would have had little or no difficulty providing appropriate
output for the ignorants.
