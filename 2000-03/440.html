I have some sympathy for the author's views.  I write
this as someone who as incurred over a million dollars
in international network traffic generated from hacked
Linux and Solaris machines.


&gt; "a similar worm was attacking Redhat 5.0 systems through a well-
&gt; publicized vulnerability in the IMAP server" - Are we seriously expected
&gt; to believe that anyone who is concerned about security is still using
&gt; RH5.0 or if so has not patched the exploit. Are we dragging up 2 year
&gt; old exploits because we can't find any more recent ones?

Oh come on, our network scans are uncovering RH 4 machines.
Users are deeply disinterested in security.  They certinly
aren't interested in upgrading a stable OS :-)

Anyway, there are plenty of more recent exploits.


My problem with the article is that it describes something that
has already happened.  If you look upon DDoS as the modern equivalent
of the virus, then the Linux OS is strewn with virii.

What's needed isn't a virus scanner (except on incoming e-mail),
but better machine management tools.

 - From CDs, the install process should install the Red Hat
   PGP key if it is not already present.

 - RPM should check the PGP signature by default, not optionally.

 - During install you should nominate a source of software
   updates.  RH do seem to be doing some work in that area,
   but there needs to be an element of compulsion.

 - A final update should occur that patches /etc/issue to warn
   that this version of the OS has reached the end of its support
   life.  The xdm/gdm background pixmap should be changed to
   show a tattered hat :-)

Replace RH above with your favorite distro.
