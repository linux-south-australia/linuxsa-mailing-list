&gt;... and Glen Turner has organised.

Any credit should go to Mark Prior of Connect in Adelaide who
has been lobbying for an IETF meeting here since 1992 or so.

The presenters have also gone out of their way to be useful,
especially E Paul Love who used his contacts to line up
some of the other speakers and who stepped in to give the
first presentation at short notice.

I'd like to stress your point that the presenters are experts.
Paul is one of about three people that run, rather than talk
about, a national gigabit network.  Stephen is one of the few
people that have implemented, rather than talked about, voice
over IP.  Matt is the chair of the IETF Internet Performance
Measurement working group -- their standards will set the way
in which we compare ISPs.  Bob is the chair of the Next
Generation Transition working group and an IPv6 god.

This is a once in a lifetime learning opportunity and I'd encourage
people to attend.

I'm still organising Friday.  I had hoped to get the Chair of
the Internet Engineering Task Force to give a "Future of IP"
talk but unfortunately this has fallen through.  The alternatives
are looking very, very good: possibilities are TCP performance
(why do you only get 80Mbps from a 300Mbps NIC card on a 1Gbps
link), directory enabled networking (stopping hackers at the
ethernet wallplug) or large e-mail servers (by an IMAP god).


The Computer Science department at Adelaide Uni also made space
for the lunchtime series by jostling about lectures.  Because
they offered the space for free, I didn't have to levy a cover
charge.

Finally, I'd note the generosity of my employer, AARNet, who
give me the freedom to organise this sort of event and who are
happy to pick up the tab for incidental expenses like taxi fares
and photocopying.


&gt; The only negative comment I would make is that too much time was spent on
&gt; the physical infrastructure of Internet 2.

Paul has a lot of material on advanced applications, but ran out
of time as he's not used to giving lecture-style presentations.
He said afterwards that he would have liked to have covered what
people are using Internet2 for in more depth.

Thank you for your summary of the talk.  Can I pinch it, with
attribution, to put with Paul's slides?

Glen
