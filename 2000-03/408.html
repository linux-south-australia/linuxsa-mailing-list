&gt; We have an ISDN connection to the net, and about 50 machines on the
&gt; network. We plan to increase this to around 80 in the next 3 months.

This probably won't help, but here (at Lincoln College), we have a 2Mb
Microwave connection to Adelaide Uni, about 200 users on 120 machines. We
have a 20GB squid cache, 256MB RAM on a dedicated PIII500. Overkill maybe,
but it'll last us a while... :) We originally planned to get a 9GB cache,
which we thought would be more than big enough, but this config ended up not
being _that_ much more expensive...

Seriously, 200MB is probably a tad on the small side... Check your hit rate.
You're aiming for 20-30% by file size -- significantly lower than this, and
you would probably benefit from a larger cache... Although, it does depend
on the usage patterns -- if your users all look at the same static page all
the time, then you'd probalby be close to 100%, but if they never look at
the same page twice, you''ll probably get close to 0%... An ISP my friend
worked at used to get a 30% hit rate with 700 users...

Of course, Hard drive space is cheap, so a large cache is not particularly
expensive, except in terms of RAM -- but I have no idea what the
relationship between RAM size and Cache size should be...

answer your question -- I haven't read it myself yet, but it looks really
good...)
