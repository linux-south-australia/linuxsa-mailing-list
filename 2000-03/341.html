CV time again. This time I have heard of a number of initially short-term
full-time contracts available, and have been asked to see if I can
informally get some CVs from people wanting to apply. Usual rules, ie no
promises - sending me a copy of your CV might be doing nothing but taking
up your ISP time. Any relationship between doing this and getting a job is
nothing to do with me. I just screen CVs and (with permission) hand them
over to people who seem to think that I have lots of CVs.

No Linux knowledge is required whatsoever and it is a job at the bottom of
the IT ladder, but would be very good experience for beginners wanting
some experience of a corporate LAN environment. To any budding Linux
consultants I'd suggest that it does you good to get a taste of what life
is like on a corporate network containing mostly Windows users. And of
course you get a chance to hand out Linux CDs to said users :-)

General applicant requirements:

   +  Internet-literate
   +  Well-presented
   +  Able to help train staff in the use of Internet applications
   +  Organised and able to handle multiple jobs according to priority

If you think you might fit, send me your CV at the address
"<A HREF="mailto:listes-diffusion@shearer.org">listes-diffusion@shearer.org</A>" and I might pass it along to the people
concerned. Immediate start, or soon anyway.

Regards,
