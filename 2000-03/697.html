Optus won't be supplying cable in SA, ever.

In business you never close a door, which is why their website
elides the question.

&gt; Are there any other cable providers? any in SA?

No, and there won't be.  Cable is designed for TV retriculation and
has high maintenance costs.  It's performance under load is similar
to traditional coax ethernet.

We may get ADSL providers in SA.  ADSL uses your metropolitan phone
line for data.  Both Telstra and Optus have been running trials.
The speeds depend on the average quality of the Telstra exchange-to-home
cabling plant (called the 'local loop').  Thus the trials.  It
is in Telstra's interest to be conservative (so it sends out less
technicans to re-cable customer cable drops).  It could be as
small as 3Mbps download and 0.5Mbps upload.

It's also possible that the electricity company may look at what
the ACT's ACTEW are doing and roll out a fibre network to each
AC powerboard.  The ACTEW trial ran at 10Mbps(?), but unlike cable
or ADSL the data rate is a matter of economics rather than technology.

 
&gt; Also, if any cable service does come to SA, will we be able to use it from
&gt; our Linux boxes?

All these technologies present the same customer interface: 10BaseT
ethernet, IPv4 protocol only, DHCP address allocation, extensive
IP traffic management to limit misuse and keep customers within the
business model.

What they generally don't do is give customer support for operating
systems with low market share.  This applies as much to Windows NT 3.51
as it does to Linux.  In the past, clueful people have written excellent
HOWTOs on attaching to specific networks, such as the Telstra and Optus
cable networks.  In one case, the author was the technical guru behind
the cable rollout and a Linux user himself (as many technical staff
at ISPs are).


&gt; Thanks for the info, and sorry that it's off topic. Is there perhaps a
&gt; better e-mail list to post this to? This is the only mailing list I'm
&gt; subscribed to (and that I know of that's Australian) :)

Better still, check the back-issues of "Australian Communications"
magazine.
