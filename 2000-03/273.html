&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; would anyone like to share their opinions on RedHat 6.0 vs RedHat 6.1.  I
&gt; have heard that 6.1 is slightly buggy and that 6.0 is the one to stick
&gt; with.  Has anyone out there had any experiences they can pass on.

I have RH6.0 installed at work as a general networky servery machine.  It
doesn't (often) run X.  It works beautifully, but I've upgraded a few of
the packages over time.

At home, I run RH6.1.  I like it for a few reasons - it automatically
detects new hardware, for example, when I swap my S3-868 video card for
a Riva TNT2, when I boot, it detects this and installs the correct X
server after prompting me..  nice :)

But - I have had no end of hassles with Gnome.  I'm starting to hate it.
I left it running last night, playing soothing music from a cd, and it
crashed out of X at some stage during the night and the cd didn't loop :(

KDE I can deal with.

But, to be perfectly honest, I prefer using twm...

I digress..

Basically, the X window managers 6.1 installs have not been kind to me.

But, IMHO, it's still worth going for 6.1 - just spend some time
upgrading to the latest version of kde and/or gnome :)  Or use twm.

HTH :)

Nick..
