Matthew,
I don't think what you trying to do is possible.. unless there is a
version of VMWare written for sparc, and Windows ran on the sparc
architechture. (Let me explain..)

VMWare works by emulating the hardware of the motherboard and the
peripherals (but not the CPU), getting information to and from them
where appropriate. 
So, it can execute i386 binaries, and fool them into thinking that
they are actually on a i386.. with whichever peripherals are required.
(As an asside, the programs see whatever processer you computer
actually has in it, and they run at nearly native speed.)

Wine would not work either as it just runs the windows code as native,
just replacing the windows system calls with calls to it's own
libraries.

Unless there is a free, open replacement for winframe, the best bet
might be to have a look at dosemu... and see if you get it to run
on the Sparc, and then install Win 3.11 on to of that, and your
applications on top of that.  It will run slow but.. despirate times..

Does anyone know of any other efforts?
 

  Matthew&gt; Hi I was wondering if anyone has any experience in getting
  Matthew&gt; VMWARE running on a sparc version of Redhat 6.X We are
  Matthew&gt; wanting to evaluate its worth for providing windows
  Matthew&gt; applications to *NIX users as a replacement for winframe
  &gt;&gt; From what I can tell it would be difficult for a sparc machine as
  &gt;&gt; Windows would
  Matthew&gt; not recognise the hardware

  Matthew&gt; Any thoughts?

  Matthew&gt; Matt Mills
