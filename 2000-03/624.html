&gt; No quite correct, Redhat's kernels have all SCSI as modules.

Yes, I didn't say otherwise.  RedHat seem to ship with most of
the modules compiled as modules, which is commendable (even if
it does shield users from building their own kernels, which is
neither a good or bad thing).

&gt; They provide a utility and oprions in lilo to preload SCSI modules
&gt; (having found this out the hard way).

I have seen this (the mkbootdisk command); however, having had zero
experience with it and as it is a RedHat'ism (and I can't remember
if the original poster stated he was on a RedHat box), I wasn't about
to offer that as a solution.  In fact, enough time has passed that
I don't seem to know how to build effective (for my purposes) rescue
disks anymore, so I will have to revisit the whole process soon (the
last time I did this was 1.2.13 - ah, memories).
