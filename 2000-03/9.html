&gt; I've not had any contact with UPS's, but I'd assume with all that power
&gt; that they have pass through/stored in them they'd get pretty hot. That
&gt; would mean the case would need to be redesigned to dissipate much more
&gt; heat.

The UPSs I've seen do not appear to have that much more ventilation than a
PC case... However, I'm sure that if this was an issue, it would be quite
possible from a technical standpoint

&gt; As for putting a switch or hub inside, it removes the modularity at the
&gt; benefit of having everything in one big box (which isn't that much of a
&gt; benefit IMO) What if you don't want the hub there, rather in the middle
&gt; of your network, or perhaps you want to upgrade the computer
&gt; independantly of the network? You're out of luck.

If you have a small network, and you are not a computer person, then having
one box to think about could be a serious advantage. EG: small accounting
firm wanting a server for their five PC network, buys a Linux box with built
in UPS and 8 port switch, and just plugs each PC into the server, and the
server into the power socket, and a phone line into the server, and hey
presto -- instant network. As they grow, the internal switch could be
upgraded when neccessary to a 16 or 24 port, and if they grow beyond what
will fit into one box, they probably need to have a more normal setup
anyway... This would be a simple plug'n'go system...

&gt;
&gt; Linux boxes can be setup to be configured only through a net/web
&gt; interface, with a combination of linuxconf, telnet and cgi ;)

yep... What about setting up a button on the box to shut the server down --
ie pressing this button takes the computer to runlevel 6, and then actually
turns it off. You'd also need an "on" button, which could be the same
button, and a hard off/reset switch for when absolutely neccessary... I
don't know what else you'd need apart from these. Perhaps a one-line LCD
display could be of some use, or maybe just a few LEDs...

Thanks

PS: thanks for the magnumpower link, Adam.... This looks like exactly what I
was looking for...
