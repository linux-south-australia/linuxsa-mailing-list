Thanks for everyone's help.

Unfortunately, the Uni's Computer Science machines are behind a firewall (I
believe. otherwise they just deny all/most connections to the computers), so
the only way I can access them, is by telnetting to another computer within
the Uni's campus, then telnet to the machines I need. For this reason, I
don't believe I can use SSH to get what I wanted working.

Anyway, luckily we have a permanent connection, and as well as the modem's
IP address, we get two more. So, after about 2 hours of stuffing around with
network settings and breaking the rest of the LAN's internet connectivity, I
finally got my computer visible to the rest of the world. I tried running
the program I needed, and like others told me, it was slow. The window did
pop up on my screen after a while, but then immediately closed, and the
program seemed to have segfaulted. :(

Oh well, I guess I really should do a little work at Uni every now and
again.

Back to fixing the network :)

Thanks again,
Andy
