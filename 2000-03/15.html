Glen:

&gt; UPSs use lead-acid batteries, so you have to allow for a hydrogen
&gt; discharge.  PCs are not engineered to be non-igniting.  Adding this
&gt; engineering gets expensive given the physical size of the PC's
&gt; motherboard that has to be enclosed.  You also have to allow
&gt; for leaks -- a gell battery will split and leak if heated.

ahh... makes sense, but what about the built-in UPS at magnumpower.com, as
suggested by Adam Sulis?

&gt;
&gt; Even PABXs with "integrated" UPSs actually have a different
&gt; floor mounted chassis for the UPS.  Just the cladding looks
&gt; the same as the main unit.
&gt;
&gt; Someone suggested using notebook batteries.  This would be fine
&gt; for one machine, but this rapidly becomes uneconomic for a cluster
&gt; of machines.

This would be just to support the server in a single server environment...

&gt;
&gt; I've no idea why you'd want an internal ethernet switch on a computer.
&gt; For small numbers of ports, VLANs make more sense.  For larger port
&gt; counts, attaching it to a PC will force fate-sharing with the PC:
&gt; ie: your network stops when the hard disk on the computer dies.

VLANs? As in Virtual LAN? or something else? My limited understanding of
VLANs tells me that a VLAN is a way to make arbitrary devices on separate
physical ethernet segments act like they are on one segment. I fail to see
the relevance of VLANs to this environment... :) Maybe I didn''t make it
clear that this would be for a very small network of no more than 16 clients
in total, probably more like 5 or maybe 10... In fact, on rethinking, I
think that a hub would do just as good a job as a switch in this situation,
and a switch would be overkill...

The reason for an internal hub is to have everything in the one box, so as
not to intimidate users. All they do is plug clients in here, phone/ISDN/etc
line in here, power in there, and switch on. Perhaps plug printer in
somewhere as well... No keyboard, no separate UPS with multiple power cords
and serial cable, no external hub with cat5 everywhere and power supplies
all over the place. I'm thinking of this for small businesses, like retail
shops, small accounting and law offices, etc etc. Places where people get
nervous when you mention the word "Ethernet", and practically faint if they
have to do any computer-related thinking beyond mail-merges in MS Word.
