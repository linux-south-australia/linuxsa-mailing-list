I am by no means a routing expert, but I have had a little experience
setting up routing on Linux boxes with ISDN TAs for a few businesses with
a LAN and an ISDN connection to an upstram ISP.
&lt;/disclaimer&gt;

I would think that if you goal is simply to connect all the
machines on your office lan to teh 'net then a linux box would be fine,
assuming you can get a decent IDSN TA.

Alex's comments are right, if you are actaully taking about
doins "real" routing, ie havning a multihomed box, BGP, lots of routes,
aggregation etc etc.

But since it looks like you will have only one upstream provider,
probably a single piece of contiguous address space and probably will not
peering, then I would think you would effectively only have one route and
therefore the machine would not be doing a whole lot apart from forwarding
packets from one interface to another.

There really is no difference from a routing perspective from this
scenario and a modem. The only difference is the media, which does not
affect the routing decisions in a scenario such as the one you have
described.

So if you think that the machine could route OK with a modem, then it
should be ok with ISDN(from a routing perspective) as there is no
(routing)difference.

Once again this does assume that you will only have a single upstram
provider, won't be peering at the NAP and that your internal rotuing needs
are not complex which assuming you have an office LAN, I can't imagine
they would be.

As to the cost issue, it is true that a low end isdn router or similar
costs less  than a pc, however you will probably need a pc
anyway to do stuff like hosting  websites, mailserving etc, so the cost
argument is possibly a big bogus, as your isdn rotuer is not going to do
those other tasks, so you will probably need some pc as well as your
router if you choose the router solution.

It also assumes you will be buying a new PC and not useing one you have
already, which odes not sound like the case from your email.

One thing I might suggest is checking out connect.com as your upstream
provider if you dont already have an upstream provider, as last itme I
checked, they were providing differential rates for traffic.

ie national traffic was cheaper than international traffic, local(ie
traffic that does not "leave" the NAP) traffic was free as was any traffic
that came form their cache.

I don't believe Telstra is doing this(well not all of it - I think they
might have cache traffic free now).

&gt; &gt; Our company is moving office soon, and it looks quite likely that
&gt; &gt; we'll be installing a 128k ISDN link to connect ourselves to the
&gt; &gt; Internet via Telstra.  I'm thinking of using an old box running
&gt; &gt; Linux as a router rather than buying a dedicated router.  We're not
&gt; &gt; likely to be routing huge volumes of data (I'm expecting loads to
&gt; &gt; average around 30-40kbps and peak at 100kbps occasionally).  Are
&gt; &gt; there any serious pitfalls in doing this?  Does the speed of the box
&gt; &gt; have any significant impact?  Would I be better off biting the
&gt; &gt; bullet and buying a proper router?
&gt; 
&gt; SUMMARY: Buy a router.
&gt; 

&gt; ISDN = Integrated Services Digital Network (It still does nothing)
&gt; SAIX = South Australian Internet Exchange
&gt; BGP = Border Gateway Protocol
&gt; AS = Autonomous System
&gt; FUD = Fear Uncertainty Doubt
&gt; TA = Terminal Adapter
&gt; 
&gt; Linux router boxes are great in theory, and on spec, there is really
&gt; no reason not to use one as they can route, support many routing
&gt; protocols (through gated), and have ISDN interfaces which the kernel
&gt; supports.

HUGE SNIP.
