I'm reasonably sure this subject has been covered before on the list but I
can't find the thread in the list archive.

I’ve just bought a new computer with the usual gigantic hard drive and would
like to dual boot NT 4 Workstation with Linux. I’ve done it before, but can’
t remember how I did it! I remember having a great deal of trouble getting
Lilo and ntldr to work together, and for a while I had a system that I
couldn’t boot at all until some kind souls at a linuxsa meeting fixed it for
me.

The machine is used to run a small family business; therefore it’s vital
that it’s robust. NT 4 is essential; NT 4 and the related software must
always work. Because NT is so important I would like to take the
conservative root and boot linux from a floppy boot disk.

NT is installed on the first four partitions, which use a total of 12 GB. I
have a spare unformatted 7.5 GB on which I would like to install linux. I
seem to remember having trouble installing Red Hat 5.1 or lilo on an
extended partition. Am I right about that? Is it still a problem?

I thought I wouldn’t be doing this again, so I deleted all my notes from the
previous install a couple of years ago. Can anybody tell me how I should go
about this, point me to the right place in the list archive, or point me to
a Web site with a good howto?

I have the revised edition Linux pocket book with Red Hat 6.1 and Caldera CD
’s. Does it matter which distribution I install?

I should mention that I’m just a reasonably competent amateur, with a very
limited working knowledge of Linux.

Regards, Steve
