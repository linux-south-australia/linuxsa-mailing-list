&gt; Hi all,
&gt; I've been lurking on the list and reading for some time and decided to have
&gt; a go at installing Linux last week.
&gt; The record of events has shattered me and I now definitely need some help.
&gt; Needless to say I did NOT backup my data and I do not need 1.5 million
&gt; emails saying I should have don that before I started - Thanks, but no
&gt; thanks...

Hmmm. The hard way. My favourite. ;-)


&gt; I have 3 partitions on my 13 gig hdd and I have shuffled data around to free
&gt; up one of these partitions and after discovering that LINUX (Red Hat) did
&gt; not like being put in the last 4.5 gig partition (disk druid could not
&gt; recognise anything above about 8 gig), I moved my data again so that the
&gt; middle 4.5 gig partition was available for it.

Your BIOS supports a maximum of 8GB. I would not have thought Disk Druid
would have complained, but LILO will probably have a hissy fit. You
should read the BIG Disk HOWTO (called Large-Drive-HOWTO or something).
It's on the CD I think.

You might find using Linux fdisk better. It will complain, but let you
do 'bad' stuff anyway.

&gt; First I tried to install a version of Red Hat 6.0 (obtained from a PC
&gt; magazine CD) - every time I tried the install using 2gig as root, 2gig as
&gt; /usr and 129meg for swap (just cos I had the space), no matter what packages
&gt; I selected, I'd always be warned that there was insufficient space to
&gt; install them. Disk druid always showed bags of space.

Did you tell it to format the partitions? You should.

&gt; Anyway, by cautiously selecting continue when warned there was enough space
&gt; (i.e. half closed my eyes and selected continue) the install would proceed
&gt; and files would be copied onto the partitions, but when the mouse detection
&gt; phase came, it couldn't find my mouse!!!
&gt; I would abort the install and try again, but still no go even if I tried to
&gt; skip that step, every other step except aborting the install resulted in no
&gt; progress.
&gt; Having wasted about half a day with Red Hat 5.2 and 6.0, I decided to blow
&gt; those partitions away and give it up. I blew away the Linux partitions using
&gt; the Disk Druid application.
&gt; When I rebooted to Winslow98 everything looked fine, I could see my C: and
&gt; D: drives - the Linux partition was not there as is normal - and access
&gt; files from them without any problems.

That's what you think. ;-)

&gt; I recreated another 4.5gig logical drive in the space I had created when I
&gt; blew away the LINUX install and was able to work with it in Winslows98
&gt; I was just swearing my head off and abandoning my attempts to install LINUX
&gt; then as I was getting up I spotted the CD for Caldera Open Linux and instead
&gt; of walking away, I decided to have 'one more go'.
&gt; BIG ERROR...
&gt; The installation went great - lovely monkey see monkey do pictures and
&gt; everything appeared OK.
&gt; I managed to get into the X-Windows environment and everything appeared good
&gt; there too.
&gt; I logged off and shut down using the graphical interface (KDE) and waited
&gt; until I was told everything had been shut down, then I rebooted the PC.
&gt; I was taken straight into Winslow98 and discovered that I'd lost my data
&gt; drive. (Which is the last logical partition in the extended partition).
&gt; In Winslows Explorer, both logical drives appear as D: and E:, but I cannot
&gt; read anything from them, I get an error saying drive not accessible...
&gt; Nothing I do will recover it.
&gt; I've tried Partition Magic - no use, the partition I want comes up as
&gt; unknown and I can't do diddly with it.
&gt; I've tried Ranish Partition Manager - no use, both logical partitions give a
&gt; 'boot record has invalid data' error (I think that's the message)
&gt; If you've made it this far then maybe you might be able to suggest a fix for
&gt; me...
&gt; Otherwise anyone know where I can get hold of 6 feet of rope and a nice tree
&gt; branch or beam???
&gt; 

Linux fdisk time. Be very careful. just boot off the redhat CD
(whichever version) and when you get to the bit about Disk Druid, select
fdisk. You are just looking. Do not change anything. You may end up
killing everything (else). type 'p' to view which partitions you have.
Take down what it tells you. E-Mail the details to the list or myself as
it should help find the problem

Good luck.

Matt

P.S. If you can avoid it, try not to access the drives too much from
Windows, as I have seen it do some nasty stuff when it isn't sure.
