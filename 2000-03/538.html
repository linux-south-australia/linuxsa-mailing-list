Barry, Sam, Nicole, Others,

If indeed Mr Valenti is making a trip to our fine country, he might as
well be coming down here for a holiday on the ever changing always
amazing Gold Coast since distribution of DeCSS isn't something him or his
consortium can touch until the Digital Agenda Bill goes through in about a
month's time at which time 2600 Australia will begin linking to copies of
the software stored offshore.  The reasoning? Under the Digital Agenda
Bill and any changes that may or may not occur as a result of the
Parliamentary Committee that studied the issue, use of DeCSS won't be a
crime - distribution and manufacturing of it will be, however.  And just
as the MPAA failed in New York to get an injunction against 2600 Magazine
from linking to the software, they will fail here too.

As you might imagine, this is all coming to a head, and the only thing I
personally see the MPAA doing is wasting money on lawsuits against
individuals in the USA acting in the interests of the open source
community and sending threatening letters to what it assumes are clueless
individuals and ISPs hosting the software.  What they fail to realise is
that every cent they spend is another cent showing the emerging open
source DVD playback market that they are not worthy as customers.

And if any of this is an indication of how powerful American industry
consortiums have become in the world marketplace, it's only going to get
much much worse.  I mean, who else spends this much money on lobbying for
laws to be passed that prevent consumers from playing back lawfully
acquired material on any device they choose?  Who else goes after a
country of lawful consumers such as Australia while ignoring the
infinitely more damaging markets in Asia where pirates don't bother
decrypting the information on the disc - they just copy the discs
verbatim.  I think we might conclude that it'd be a political vistory for
them to have Australia "on the leash" as it were than any sort of an
actual, financially measurable victory over commercial piracy in Asia.

Welcome to Australia, Mr Valenti.  I hope you enjoy the Gold Coast.

Grant

&gt; jack valenti is the mpaa honcho
&gt; Im not sure if he actually did board a plane
&gt; this morning, but our contacts in the media
&gt; seem to think so. any lawyers out there
&gt; want to do somr pro-bono work ?
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cool. By the way, you made news in the US. The San Hose 
&gt; Mercury has run a
&gt; link to the ComputerWorld story:
&gt; 
&gt; "An irate Jack Valenti seen boarding plane bound for 
&gt; Australia: Hacker
&gt; advocate group 2600 Australia plans to broadcast the 
&gt; DeCSS decryption code
&gt; over national television networks in the coming weeks. 
&gt; Although the code
&gt; contained in the broadcast will not be comprehensible 
&gt; when it appears on
&gt; television, viewers who record the broadcast on video 
&gt; can later uncover the
&gt; information by watching the broadcast frame by frame. 
&gt; Australian Federal
&gt; copyright laws are apparently unable to prevent the 
&gt; distribution of such
&gt; information."
&gt; 
&gt; I'll forward the newsletter to you as well.
&gt; Chers, Barry

Grant writes about Jack Valenti coming to town.

Just for information, Jack was President Johnson's minder and trouble-shooter
during the Vietnam War, and had a big hand in the Bay of Tonkin resolution
that got the Yanks and us involved.

He also spoke about Australia's development of a film industry in the early
1970s (talking to Hollywood moguls) saying that moves by indigenous (ie
Australian) film industries were a threat to Hollywood's export industry and
should be resisted at all costs.  At that time the owned and controlled about
90% of the key cinemas and all the distributors in Australia.

He was a close friend of the Labor Minister for the Media, Doug McLelland
("Dutchess Doug" who's son is now in the Federal Opposition).  The Minister
supported the Americans, saying that the Australian film industry was still in
the kindergarden stages, and we should let the Americans come here to make
their films, so that we could learn from them.  

He also asked Jack to help find a job for his daughter who had just shifted to
the USA, and in the same letter he suggest that the US industry might nominate
a representative to sit on the Australian film production committee advising
government.  Australian film and TV production associations weren't given a
representative on this committee.

Don't under-estimate who you are dealing with here.  He has very strong
political connections on both sides of the Pacific, and an enormous amount of
financial backing.

Jack visited Australia to pay his complements to the Minister for the Media
within days of the election of the Whitlam Labor Government, and we gave him a
big welcome -- quite a big turnout of film and television production people,
all carrying signs.

You might like to consider doing that again.
