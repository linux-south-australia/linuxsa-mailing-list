 &gt; 
 &gt; Mark.. what have you noticed with regard the windowing/error
 &gt; correcting complications with a second TCP layer stacked on top of
 &gt; another?  
 &gt; 
 &gt; There is a HOWTO which has some words of warning regarding the how
 &gt; the various timers interact with each other, ie. if you start to get
 &gt; errors in the low level which causes delays, this will cause packet
 &gt; retransmission at the higher level, and the whole thing will grind to
 &gt; a crawl. 
 &gt; (Sorry.. I can't find the URL)

Yes, that's a problem too.  Think of a retransmit timer operating on
a TCP session running over the tunnel:  If an ACK is not received before
the retransmit timer expires, the TCP session will resend the last window.

Underneath all that is the retransmit timer on the underlying TCP
session carrying the tunnel.

Let's consider what happens when there's some congestion.  Your "top-level"
session transmits some data and sets its retransmit timer.  That data runs
through the network stack until it pops out the PPP interface, which 
is carried over a TCP session, so your data gets transmitted through that
one too, so another retransmit timer is set.  

Now, due to congestion, the ACK coming back gets delayed.  The "top level"'s
TCP retransmit timer will expire first (because it would have sent the 
data a couple of milliseconds before the tunnel sent it), so it'll resend
the data which is outstanding.  

That retransmission will be submitted to the underlying tunnel, which 
will now have some new data to send.  That data won't be able to go 
anywhere yet, though, because the underlying tunnel has an unacknowledged
window of data still outstanding, so it'll sit in the transmit queue
waiting for the interface to become ready.

A couple of milliseconds later, the underlying tunnel, attempting to 
guarantee reliable delivery like TCP is supposed to do, will *also* 
retransmit its *original* window -- And that's before the window has
even advanced to the point where TCP gets to the duplicate tunnelled
packets.

What's happening is that duplicate packets from the tunnel are transformed
into unique packets on the underlying transport, which must be reliably
transmitted, so in the case of congestion you double your traffic over
your physical infrastructure.  Since the congestion is caused by 
excessive traffic in the first place, this only makes the problem worse,
which causes additional duplicate data to be sent, which makes the 
congestion worse, which...

You don't want to go there :-)

That's why it's *FAR* more efficient to tunnel over UDP, which doesn't
attempt to deliver reliably.  If there is congestion, the only layer
which is going to give a rat's arse about it is the original "top-level"
TCP connection, there will be no retransmissions on the underlying 
infrastructure unless that TCP session requires it.

Unfortunately, tunnelling over UDP is often firewall-hostile, so it
isn't particularly well-suited for VPNs.  It also presents the same
MTU issues I raised in my last message, so it isn't all roses.

*BSD provides "tun" network interfaces to do tunnelling, making it simple
to tunnel over anything you want (whether it's RS-232, TCP or UDP makes
little difference).  You "ifconfig" a tun interface in the same way you
can ifconfig a ppp interface;  any packets transmitted through that 
network interface can be read by a user process reading from /dev/tun*,
and any packets written to /dev/tun* are "received" by the kernel's
network protocol stack.  This makes it simple to come up with an 
"ip-over-UDP" tunnelling program in about 30 lines of C code.  I'm not
sure what Linux provides to do the same thing, but I'm sure there's
something.
