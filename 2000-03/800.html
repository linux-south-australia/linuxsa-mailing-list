&gt;  &gt; &gt; Ok, yes, I understnd that you'd take some of the bits of the joke
&gt;  &gt; &gt; a bit personally.  But perhaps we need to get something else straight:
&gt;  &gt; &gt; If everyone who is about to say something in public needs to think
&gt;  &gt; &gt; about whether there's someone else in earshot who might, for reasons
&gt;  &gt; &gt; unknown to anyone else, get offended by what is about to be said, then
&gt;  &gt; &gt; nobody will ever say anything at all about anything.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Exactly, it doesn't matter these days who is in earshot, we should all
&gt;  &gt; be careful of what we are saying.
&gt; 
&gt; So every person gets a heckler's veto over anything said by anyone
&gt; else?
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; I'm not saying that there can't be jokes.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes you are.  There can be no jokes because *all* jokes are offensive
&gt; to *somebody* (if you can't understand that, I challenge you to come
&gt; up with something which is actually FUNNY which doesn't marginalize
&gt; someone else).

No, no, what's offensive is you think it's ok to wage this philosophical
and very personal battle on a Linux mail list. Yes, these things are
important for you to resolve. But please, not here. Fair go guys. I am
getting RSI trying to keep up the deletes. (no offence to RSI sufferers
intended)
