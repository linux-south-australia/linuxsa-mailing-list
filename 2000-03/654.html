 &gt; What is a "local loop" ?
 
The pair of copper wires between your telephone exchange and your house.

"Unbundling" it means that the provision of the local loop is separated
from the provision of local telephone services.  In essence, it means
you can go to someone other than Telstra and say, "Please plug my 
phone line into the exchange equipment you've placed in the third-party
room at my local exchange building instead of leaving it plugged in
to Telstra's exchange equipment."  It's the thing you need to be able to
do if you want to arrive at the situation where you want to terminate
your business relationship with Telstra without losing your phone service.

The most common use of unbundling the local loop is to use it for 
high speed data instead of voice communications.  Instead of running
your copper wires into a telephone exchange, a carrier runs them 
into a "Digital Subscriber Line Aggregation Module", or DSLAM.  The
DSLAM can drive data down your home phone line at speeds up to 
8 megabits per second down and 1 megabit per second up (the disparity
between download and upload speeds is why the "A" is in "ADSL" --
it means "Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line").  Although ideal line
quality conditions can yield 8Mbps/1Mbps speeds, carriers usually
run ADSL at 2 Mbps down and 256k up, or even 512k down and 64k up.
Alternatively, some carriers offer ADSL as a "symmetric" service
by noting that if they throttle the download speed to 1 Mbps, the
download speed is the same as the upload speed.  Below 1 Mbps
both directions can run at the same data rate.

Several hundred local loops can plug into one side of a single DSLAM. 
The other side jacks in to the carrier's ATM network via an aggregator. 
Each ADSL user "owns" an ATM PVC in the carrier's core.

The ADSL modem which sits in the subscriber's house connects to your
computer with an ethernet cable.  You usually use DHCP to establish
the parameters for a "PPP over Ethernet" (pppoe) session with an
ISP affiliated with your carrier, which is how you get your Internet
access.

ADSL modems/DSLAMs also understand that there are certain frequencies
on the line which they aren't supposed to use -- Coincidentally (:-),
these are the same frequencies understood by a normal analogue 
telephone.  That means you can run your phone and your ADSL modem
in parallel on the same line, and make phone calls (or even use an
analogue 56k modem!) without interrupting your ADSL connectivity.  A
voice telephone exchange is muxed in at the DSLAM to provide audio
for telephones on the local loops utilized for ADSL.

Unlike cable modems, ADSL doesn't suffer from the "neighbourhood 
contention" problems which other broadband users sometimes complain
about.  The line bandwidth is yours and *only* yours, you don't share
your local loop with anyone else.

 &gt; &gt;  &gt; I found this on slashdot 
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; Australian TelCo Required To Grant Loop Access

 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; It's nothing particularly new - Telstra was sending press releases saying
 &gt; &gt; that they'd be doing ADSL in August as far back as last November, while
 &gt; &gt; other parts of Telstra were walking into the DSL Forum meetings claiming
 &gt; &gt; that it was technically impossible to open up the local loop.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; It's been well-known that if Telstra was planning to roll-out in August,
 &gt; &gt; the ACCC would go ballistic if they weren't offering other carriers a
 &gt; &gt; bite of the pie as well.  This story just counts as confirmation that 
 &gt; &gt; Telstra's press releases last year weren't very far off the mark.
 &gt; &gt; (and the ACCC announcement was actually about half way through last
 &gt; &gt; week, BTW)
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Of course, what isn't being said is that there's very little benefit 
 &gt; &gt; in offering other carriers access to the copper if you do it at the 
 &gt; &gt; exact same time that you're opening up your ADSL retail service.  
 &gt; &gt; Telstra has had at least five years to sort out all the technical 
 &gt; &gt; difficulties, spec the right equipment, install it in exchanges, survey
 &gt; &gt; lines to work out which service areas are going to be suitable for
 &gt; &gt; ADSL, etc -- It's going to take *months* for competitive carriers to
 &gt; &gt; do the same research before they can offer a quality alternative
 &gt; &gt; service.
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; So, competitive carriers are stuck:  Do they jump like a bull at a gate
 &gt; &gt; as soon as access is opened, gaining market share at the expense of 
 &gt; &gt; reputation as all the customers they manage to get spread bad word-of-mouth
 &gt; &gt; about their quality of service while they're learning the ropes, or do
 &gt; &gt; you hold back, test, build up your skills and expertise, then finally
 &gt; &gt; launch a service which is competitive on price, features and quality
 &gt; &gt; after Telstra has had time to sew-up 80% of the market?
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Sigh.  I didn't vote for 'em.
