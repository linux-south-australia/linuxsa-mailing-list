&gt; A traceroute from outside the firewall to the cisco stops at the external

&gt; can find (if people want to run their own tests I'll supply IPs).
&gt; 
&gt; I therefore conclude that it is the gateway that is the problem, if only
&gt; because this problem didn't occur prior to the RH 6 install, and the
&gt; config is otherwise unchanged.
&gt; 
&gt; The ipchains rules are simple, and just block web and ftp ports.
&gt; (I'll supply these upon request).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm out of ideas as to where to look for solutions to this problem, unless
&gt; it is architecture related, in which case we need to find another router
&gt; (thinking of recent discussions).
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas out there ?

At a pinch you could try running tcpdump to find out what packets 
are being sent between the gw and whatever else. If the packets look
as they should, but aren't being forwarded on by the gw, then at
least you know exactly where the problem lies.
