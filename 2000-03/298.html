Greetings have a routing problem as such...


Linux Alpha box acting as a gateway/firewall (IP Chains). Running RH 6.0
(patched to latest version of bind etc). More details on request). 

It sits in the uni network, ans supports its own subnet behind
it. Multiple machines are there, all working corectly except for the modem
server.

Setup is thus:


                               ----- Various machines
Uni Network ----- Gateway ---- |
                               ----- Cisco Access Server 500 CS ---| 7 modems

The problem is thus...

The Access server can't find the gateway, and thus the uni's network, tho
it can find the outside world. Likewise the modems have the same
problem. We have another Cisco Server identical in configuration except it
is supporting a serial terminal not modems, so no IP's on the outside of
the config.

A traceroute from the server stops at the gateway.
A traceroute from outside the firewall to the cisco stops at the external
interface of the firewall (for both CISCOs), but any other machine it
can find (if people want to run their own tests I'll supply IPs).

I therefore conclude that it is the gateway that is the problem, if only
because this problem didn't occur prior to the RH 6 install, and the
config is otherwise unchanged.

The ipchains rules are simple, and just block web and ftp ports.
(I'll supply these upon request).

I'm out of ideas as to where to look for solutions to this problem, unless
it is architecture related, in which case we need to find another router
(thinking of recent discussions).

Any ideas out there ?

Thanks
