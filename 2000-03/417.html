&gt; But there?s a nasty little trap hidden inside those nice friendly messages,
&gt; the messages are more personal than my colleague realised. Hidden in the
&gt; HTML code is a user ID, a unique identifier that identifies him, and it?s
&gt; passed as a database parameter in every URL that my colleague clicks. Every
&gt; time he visits a Web site listed in the newsletter the spammers are able to
&gt; match all the information that he gave to www.property.com.au when he signed
&gt; up, with sites he visits, and the pages he views.

Hi Steve,

The web site says:

&gt; When our Ladybird finds a property matching your search criteria,
&gt; the listing agent may also be notified of your interest in the
&gt; property.  Expect them to contact you via email.  It is then up
&gt; to you to open dialogue with the agent and arrange to inspect
&gt; the property.

This doesn't seem to be exactly the behaviour you are describing,
so get your mate to write to Consumer Affairs complaining about
their misleading conduct.

Most real estate agents also sign up to the ADMA (direct marketing)
Code of Practice.  Get on their stop-list.  Then when the e-mails
continue, complain again using the escalation procedures in the
Code.

There's a fair chance that neither of these will have a huge effect.
Please keep good notes -- we can use them later on as a case study
the next time the Code is reviewed or there's an inquiry into net
privacy.

Please let me know how it goes,
Glen
