<H1>Friday's IETF presentation speaker is...</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
&gt; I'm still organising Friday.  I had hoped to get the Chair of
&gt; the Internet Engineering Task Force to give a "Future of IP"
&gt; talk but unfortunately this has fallen through.

And Fred Baker, the Chair of the Internet Architecture Board,
has stepped in to give a lecture on IP Quality of Service.
Fred has been working on the QoS standards for the last five
years.  In any other organisation, Fred's title would be
president, so we are incredibly fortunate to have him give
a presentation.

Unlike Fred's presentation at Ngpartji on Thursday, his lecture
on QoS will be more technical than economic, social or political.
You could attend both with little overlap in content.


Just a reminder, tomorrow at 12:00 Matt Zekauskas is presenting
his work on Internet performance measurement -- the Surveyor project.
Matt is Chair of the IETF's IP Performance Measurement working
group.

In case this sounds a tad academic, consider that Matt's working
group is setting the standards that will be used in future years
by government regulators like the ACCC to measure the adequacy of
IP services provided by ISPs.

His work could also be leveraged to provide an accounting system
for those ISPs that are wondering how they will build an accounting
system for the gigabit optical networks that they will be installing
next year.
