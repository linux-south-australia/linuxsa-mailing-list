&gt; There is something called a cobalt cube (Lucent technology), that you just

&gt; you have to do is ftp some pages up or create a share on the web page dirs
&gt; on the machine and dump the files.  It also does email, proxy and a couple
&gt; of other services.  The power switch does exactly what u say above.

Unless you've seen a different Qube to me (the Qube2) then this is
incorrect. The power button is a simple click on/click off style, and is
directly wired to the power supply. Press it and the power goes off, no
questions asked.

However you can shut it down via the panel, press a couple of buttons and
you get the shutdown option. You still need to click the thing off at the
right time though. And if you can't telnet in, you very likely can't use
the button panel - it's all driven from userspace software.

Personally I do not like these things. The system feels very fragile (lots
of specialized CGI's and programs) and I feel very worried about making
changes by hand, things that can't be done with the CGI's.

Also the backup and restore is vile! It will backup /etc/passwd and other
essential related files, but it will not restore them! You need to
recreate users and a lot of your other configuration by hand, and I
suspect order will be important as well (because of UID's and GID's).

Anyway enough ranting on that. :-)
