Greetings!
As we all know, time is multidimensional and our linear simplification is
merely a construct to suit our feeble minds.
In this context, we would expect Windoze to be happy dealing with such
linearity - and it IS!  :-)
(ie my RTC/system clock keeps good time, and WinNT reflects this admirably
under all circumstances I have found so far) 

Linux is a more advanced specie.  If I run RH6.1 unattended and with no
input from me, its clock runs at great speed - two hours later it's
tomorrow (or the day after!) :-(
Odd thing is that the system clock is unaffected - I can cure the wrong
system time with a reboot.  
Another odd thing is that this speeding up seems not to occur if I feed in
keystrokes or mouse clicks.  I say 'seems' because it might just be that my
continuous use is not over a sufficient period to observe the phenomenon.
This problem does not arise on my Cyrix 686P166+ 48MbRAM system; but DOES
arise on my AL440LX Intel MB Celeron 366 128MbRAM system and MIGHT be
connected with the recent addition of 64MB 100ns RAM.

DATE -s= (or whatever) indicates that it has accepted the correct date and
time if I try to correct that way, but then 'date' shows the old incorrect
time (ie the correction hasn't taken).
If I am in Gnome, and use timetool, that appears to work OK but I don't
know whether the speeding up is also corrected, and in any case this action
screws up the RTC setting :-(

Tip, Tricks, or Clues, anyone?

TIA,
Brian
