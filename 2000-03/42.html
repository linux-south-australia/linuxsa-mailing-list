&gt;  &gt; Not quite true Scott, you can USE it outside the states, you can NOT
export
&gt;  &gt; it from the states (unless you do it in source form like pgp does!!).
&gt;
&gt; Whether it's source code or not doesn't matter;  it's whether it's
&gt; *hardcopy*.
&gt;
&gt; The First Amendment to the US constitution is very clear about freedom
&gt; of the presses, and the Supreme Court has a history of interpreting
&gt; that freedom very broadly (even if state and federal congresses haven't).
&gt; So the Government knows it can't legally restrict a book.  So if you
&gt; print your code out on paper and send it by snailmail out of the
&gt; country, that's legal.
&gt;
&gt; If you use the 'net to do the same thing, the Government has historically
&gt; argued that since that doesn't involve a "press", freedom of the press is
&gt; irrelevent.  Programming, they say, is not "speech," so free speech rules
&gt; don't apply.  Some courts have agreed with them, some have concluded that
&gt; the academic discourse between crypto researchers who express their ideas
&gt; in software definitely count as speech, so export should be ok.
&gt;
&gt; PGP 5.0 was exported from the US as a 13-volume book published by
&gt; MIT press, which contained the complete source code in an OCR-friendly
&gt; font with a CRC at the end of each line and the end of each page which
&gt; could be used to error-check the process of scanning it back in.  During
&gt; a hacker festival in the Netherlands, several hundred people took on
&gt; the task of getting the software to compile, whereupon it was published
&gt; on ftp servers in many other countries which don't have fucked-in-the-head
&gt; crypto export laws.  That's how we saw the world's first legally exported
&gt; version of PGP reach world-wide availability.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the US Govt recently relaxed its crypto export regulations.
&gt; You can export any freely-distributable software as source code; you
&gt; do need to send a once-off advisory of the software's URL to the US
&gt; Commerce Dept, though.  Technically, that means software like PGP and
&gt; the upcoming Mozilla M14 (which will have SSL) can now be legally
&gt; exported.
