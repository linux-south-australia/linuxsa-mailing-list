Have you tried Mozilla instead? Netscape is truly buggy software. I have
been told that Mozilla is fairly stable and very slick, even though the idea
of even being up to "beta" level is novel. :)

This might seem like a troll (it ain't...!), but one of the few reasons why
I use a Windows OS at work is to avoid Netscape. Although I resent Microsoft
for their low quality software and shocking business ethics, they make a
nice browser. :)

* Subject: Problem with Netscape Communicator
*
*
* Hello,
* Problem:
* I have noticed since using RH6.1 that Netscape Communicator has the
* irritating nature of crashing out completely when trying to include an
* email URL into a composition from the Address Book. :(
*
* It doesn't seem to matter what I do, when you select a desired URL, by
* clicking any of the To, Cc or Bcc buttons, All of Netscape disappears
* into oblivion. Typing in the URL does not seem to be a problem - just
* all functionality of the Address Book.
*
* At the LinuxSA March meet and while enjoying our pizza, I posed my
* problem. Apparently, there is a bug in the Address Book, and Tim advised
* my just to upgrade.
*
* Steps I took:
* 1)I used Netscape and found the Netcraft ftp site, and went to the
* appropriate subdirectory and downloaded both
* netscape-common-4.72-6.i386.rpm and
* netscape-communicator-4.72-6.i386.rpm and saved to my /tmp directory.
* 2)As Root, I used GnoRPM, found and selected the files to add, then
* pressed upgrade.
* 3)I checked the appropriate directory and the Netscape files had indeed
* installed as the previous numbers were 4.7-1.1
* 4)I went back in as user, fired up Netscape, once again receiving the
* pre-dinner licence matinee, clicked ok, but the problem still with the
* Address Book still persists.
*
* What have I done wrong????
* Is there any steps that I have missed??
*
* This may seem probably too simple for some of you, but it is irritating
* and confusing me on how to rectify the situation.
*
* Please advise,
* Mark:(
