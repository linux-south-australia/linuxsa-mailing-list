Sure smells like one.  :-)

&gt; but one of the few reasons why
&gt; I use a Windows OS at work is to avoid Netscape. Although I resent Microsoft
&gt; for their low quality software and shocking business ethics, they make a
&gt; nice browser. :)

I wouldn't say that :-|.  While they can make an aesthetically pleasing
browser, I've struck issues recently with HTTP and FTP authentication
that have soiled the experience (the FTP one has been an issue since
IE 3).  Microsoft always seem to focus on dancing paperclips to distract
you from fundamental security and design flaws (not that other products
don't have them), but witness things like the latest Active X control
they released which bypasses most of your security to download components,
in order "to provide you with a seamless browsing experience, because our
research showed that people were sick of clicking on OK buttons to
certificate requests" - paraphrased.
