As a new and eager learner of Linux I don't feel that I have anything to
contribute to this forum. I do however read every message to learn the
various methods of problem solving. I also subscribe to the Corel Linux
forum. I experienced a similar confrontation at that forum. To shorten the
long windedness -There are more "listeners" than participants in this forum.
More results will take place if we stick to Linux in a Linux forum, drag
hurtful comments to the recycle bin and not take them personally and most of
all keep up the good work on this marvelous O/S.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Both Adam and Aaron should be publicly vilivied for airing something
as
&gt; &gt;  &gt; distasteful as what was posted (not that I could put any relationship

&gt; &gt;  &gt; an anthropologist on Mars - they must have been sniffing something at
&gt; &gt;  &gt; the time).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh come on.  It was a joke, ferchrissakes (and an old one at that).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; The reason for my angry response -  I HAVE AN AUTISTIC SON !!!!!!!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ok, yes, I understnd that you'd take some of the bits of the joke
&gt; &gt; a bit personally.  But perhaps we need to get something else straight:
&gt; &gt; If everyone who is about to say something in public needs to think
&gt; &gt; about whether there's someone else in earshot who might, for reasons
&gt; &gt; unknown to anyone else, get offended by what is about to be said, then
&gt; &gt; nobody will ever say anything at all about anything.
&gt;
&gt; Exactly, it doesn't matter these days who is in earshot, we should all
&gt; be careful of what we are saying. I'm not saying that there can't be
&gt; jokes. I just believe that we should all start to accept responsibility
&gt; for what we say and when we say it. Personally I didn't find the joke
&gt; funny, and never heard of it before.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 800 opinions there's pretty much ALWAYS going to be at least one who
&gt; &gt; will take any comment on any issue personally; does that mean that
&gt; &gt; any comment on any issue should be kept silent
&gt;
&gt; No. It just means we have to be careful what we say. I see the List as a
&gt; means where people help others where there is a possible forum of 600
&gt; (or how many is on it). I just couldn't see the point of the attachment
&gt; of such nature being made public, they should have kept it off-list and
&gt; to themselves.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; [ inviting public vilification on someone is something else which,
&gt; &gt;   perhaps, should give pause for thought.  Is that *really* the outcome
&gt; &gt;   you want from conversations on a civilized mailing list?
&gt;
&gt; If I was too harsh, then I will be the first to apologise, but, a
&gt; civilised list wouldn't have carried something that may be detrimental
&gt; to someone else.
&gt;
&gt; Have you ever been shopping with an autistic child, tried to receive
&gt; love from an autistic child, get the attention of an autistic child.
&gt; These may be considered simple things in life. I haven't had that
&gt; luxury. When an autistic child plays up, it is like getting 800 replies
&gt; of what you sent me all at once. Just because the child is misbehaving,
&gt; they can't see what the problem is because the child looks normal
&gt; because autism is a hidden disorder. We make allowances for these
&gt; problems.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;   ask you to think about how much you really want to be subscribed to
&gt; &gt;   the list, and whether your needs might be better served elsewhere ]
&gt;
&gt; No thankyou, I'm staying right here where my needs are served. Just
&gt; because there was one issue that hit a raw nerve isn't a means to dispel
&gt; them from a public forum. It's the insesitive issues that have to be
&gt; addressed, not the people they are making fun at. I can have fun and a
&gt; good joke, but not at the expense of others, it's not needed. This is a
&gt; Linux list, keep it that way. End of discussion. End of the matter :)
