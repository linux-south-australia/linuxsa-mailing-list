&gt; hello,
&gt; i have had a mandrake 7 box serving a windows maching with user directories.
&gt; but i can't remember the steps to do this. I have installed and configured
&gt; Samba as best i can but there must be more to it then that. What else do i
&gt; have to set for this linux box to be seen by the win95 box?

Depends on what your definition of 'seen' is. If you are talking about
Windows browsing (Network Neighbourhood), try these in smb.conf:

domain master = yes
local master = yes
preferred master = yes
os level = 33

Unless you already have a deidcated browser on the network (an NT
server). you may also want to turn off browse lists on the Windows box
(Network Control Panel, double click on File and Printer Sharing
Services and set browse lists to never or whatever - I haven't booted 9x
for a while).

If you are talking about mapping drives, you should be able to
automagically when you set samba up (assuming you set up some shares).
If not, it's probably a networking problem.

Are you being prompted for passwords, Denied access or anything else?
It's a security = xxxx line job. Or Unix / Share permissions thing.

If this doesn't solve your problem, let us know the specifics of the
problem

&gt; 
&gt; also can i set the IP address from the command line?

man ifconfig


Hope it helps,
Matt
