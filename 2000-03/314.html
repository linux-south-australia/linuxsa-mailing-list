Another bounce ...

&gt; would anyone like to share their opinions on RedHat 6.0 vs RedHat 6.1.  I
&gt; have heard that 6.1 is slightly buggy and that 6.0 is the one to stick
&gt; with.  Has anyone out there had any experiences they can pass on.

In addition to the other fine arguments that people have expressed here,
I would add the following: "It depends on what you want to do".  If you
are installing 6.0 off of an old RedHat CD (ie, it isn't a freshly burnt
CD), AND you are deploying this box as a router or other Internet
accessible box, THEN it is vitally important that you get updated RPMs
(end rule-based expert system).  Off the top of my head, the earlier
versions of bind (ie, anything other than the latest) have exploitable
security flaws, so if you run a publicly accessible DNS server you're
asking for problems (but then, DNS should be run in a chrooted
environment anyway :-).  Likewise, some of the ftp daemons also have
holes in them, so again these are things you need to check
(www.securityfocus.com, formerly bugtraq, is good for things like this.
Checking RedHat's update page doesn't hurt either, although checking
Bugzilla might :-|).

The only significant problem I've had with 6.1 is the (newer) install
program, but then reverting to the text based install seems to fix
that.
