<H1>The future of Linux</H1>

I'll start by apologizing for the following email's random nature. It
started out as a view on Linux certification, but digressed severely from
that point. I don't mean this as flame bait for anyone, but perhaps this
could be a healthy discussion topic...

&lt;asbestos&gt;
I think that the biggest strength of Linux is also the one thing that is
holding it back the most:
	the Open Source mentality
&lt;/asbestos&gt;

If RedHat, Debian, Caldera, Mandrake, Suse, Corel, LRP, etc ad nauseum all
work on their own distros, how can the Linux community ever agree on one
comprehensive training standard? 

Microsoft, Cisco, Novell, etc all own full rights to their product. as such,
they are the authorities who determine the "certification" testing criteria
for their product. For example, no matter where you take an "MCSE boot
camp", you are not certified until you pass the tests that Microsoft itself
prescribes.

Changes will have to be made before Linux certification holds the full
respect it deserves. Becoming RedHat certified only means something if the
client uses RedHat. I guess the same holds true for HP-UX, SCO, Solaris,
AIX, etc. A SCO certified expert applying for an AIX job will be prejudiced
against if any AIX-certified person applies.

But with Linux evolving and advancing faster than any other operating system
in history, can there ever be one true certification? Would it include KDE
or GNOME? XFree86 or Metro-X? DEB files or RPMs? Would it include all of the
above, and continually expand as new technologies emerge, or freeze the
curriculum for a set period of time?

Linux is decentrallized for its own benefit, but certain representatives do
and should control the most important aspects. Linus controls the kernel,
LDP controls the official knowledge repository, &lt;insert name here&gt; would
control the entire platform training standard. 

I'm not saying that anything should be included or left out of the training
on purpose, but Microsoft certifications do not include 3rd party apps like
Truespace or AutoCad, although no one would argue against their usefullness.
Perhaps Linux certifications would focus on:

	Base Certification/Workstation Certification (likened to an MCP)
	- the two major distro flavours: sysVinit and inittab
		- Command-line functionality (in depth)
		- Configuring all common included daemons and services
(including lpd, of course)
	- XFree86 as a standard (although others are available, they would
be covered by their own vendors)
	- KDE and GNOME as desktops (again, others would be optional diploma
courses?)

	Advanced/Server Certification (sort of an MCSE)
	- Network Server Daemons: Apache (or generalized), Samba, FTP, NFS,
etc
	- Internetworking Daemons: Routing, Firewalls, etc
	- SQL (generalized)
	
To retouch on the Open Source problem again: we started out with Linux,
created by Linus and a few peers. Then the concept of the distro came, and
the distros grew and evolved. Where will this lead; will Linux distros
evolve so far from each other that they actually cease to be the same OS? In
the commercial world of Unix, SCO people and Soraris people are not the
same. Will we someday be so divided that SUSE-certified people won't be
up-to-date on Debian, and so forth?
