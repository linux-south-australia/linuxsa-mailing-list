&gt;
&gt; The Exchange admin needs to install a unix box with Sendmail and LDAP.
&gt;
&gt; ;)
&gt;
&gt; Out of interest - has anyone succesfully set up a near-complete MS
&gt; Exchange replacement using LDAP?  I've heard it's possible, but where-
&gt; ever I look, people just say "yes it's possible" without helping me
&gt; out too much..  is there an LDAP-Exchange-HOWTO?
&gt;
&gt; Have fun, everyone.  I know I am.  Heaps of it.

Nick,

My experience from implementing LDAP with Sendmail and Outlook is that LDAP
is one method of providing a "corporate wide" Address book. One of the
limitations of Outlook Express (and full Outlook w/out an Exchange server)
is the lack of a "Global" address book.

I believe you can have a shared personal address book (eg point the personal
address book path to a server share), but this has fairly obvious, severe
limitations with regard to updating etc.

Although LDAP is much more than a simple address book service, this is
pretty much all Outlook uses it for (I welcome correction on this point).
Netscape seems to use it (optionally) as a more complete information
repository, but I seem to recall that the OpenLDAP server needs to be
patched to work 100% with Netscape clients for profiles etc.

LDAP/Outlook as a global address book has limitations also though. When the
user clicks "Address Book" (all references from here on in for Outlook
Express (OE), but should be similar to Outlook 98/2000 with Internet and
LDAP connectors), this shows them their personal address book. If the LDAP
server and Outlook client are set up correctly they can then click "Search"
and search for a user, which will display the results in a small window.

They can then do two things with the search results.

1 .. Send mail to one of the search results, by right clicking and selecting
"Send Mail" (or similar). This does just that - adds the email address of
the selected search result into the "To:" field of the email address, and
then allows them to compose and send the email.

It does not add the user to the address book, and if at a later stage the
user wishes to send another email to the same person, they must repeat the
above procedure (Address Book-&gt;Search-&gt;Send)


2 .. The user can add the LDAP search results to their address book. This
option fills in the local Address book with all the LDAP attributes that are
applicable to the address book (eg Email, Name, Address, Fax number, Company
etc etc)

The user can then select this person from their address book at any time and
send them an email. The *big* downside with this is that there is no address
book synchronisation. If the LDAP server attributes change (eg the persons
phone number, or worse, email address) the end users Address Book is not
updated, so eventually the information in the local address book may go
stale. An LDAP search and "re-add" will update it, but how often is a user
going to do that.

One solutions to the above problem would be a program that queried the LDAP
server at PC startup for changed entries (based on various criteria, and
with commonsense bandwidth and search minimisation techniques), then updated
the users address book to reflect this.

I personally think this would be a reasonable solution for a small to medium
business, as it would allow a synchronised "global address book" with a
fairly competent (no flames please !) email client - Outlook Express. This
would be a good starting point for a small email system, which could then be
expanded to bigger and better things if and as required.

There is a company that made a windows product called "Address Magic", which
translated a between a whole lot of email address book formats. One
conversion was LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format ?) to OE Address book. I
approached them to see if they would make a non-interactive version of their
software to do what I suggested above.

They were enthusiastic, but would only do it if I could guarantee a minimum
number of purchases. I could not convince my client at the time to proceed
(chicken and egg deal: Client - "We will only pay if it works." Developer -
"We wont make it unless you pay"), so the concept flopped.

Hmmm, where were we after all that ? Yes, LDAP is OK, and part of the
solution, but does not really in my opinion make a "near complete MS
Exchange replacement".

For one thing, (full) Outlook-Exchange provides the following features which
are arguably difficult to emulate with Sendmail/IMAP/LDAP:

1 ..  Multiple global address books with individual and mailing-list (group
entries).

2 .. True shared calendaring, with the ability to look at others free/busy
times.

3 .. Vacation Auto-Reply and email forwarding.

4 .. Delegation of various mail tasks to others (eg open Inbox as read-only,
allow secretary to schedule meetings etc).

5 .. Public shared folders (OK, maybe you can do this with IMAP !)

6 .. GUI Admin tools

7 .. Server based mail routing rules.

I did not mean the above list to be inflammatory, and I will concede that
some of the above points are irrelevant in some situations (6..GUI admin),
or can be done to some extent with other tools (7..procmail). However a lot
of the above features are important in a medium to large user setting.

If this is the case for you, have a look at HP OpenMail. It runs on Linux
and there is a free (although unsupported) license for up to 50 users.
Otherwise it is roughly $US50 per mailbox. It supports full Outlook clients
(via MAPI, fairly well from me experience), CCMail, Lotus Notes clients (no
experience with the last two), plus standard POP/IMAP clients.

Good luck with your project though, and please let the list know how you go,
and what you find.

Regards,

Andrew Speer
