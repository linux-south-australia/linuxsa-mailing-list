AN ANTHROPOLOGIST ON MARS                  E-MAIL FROM BILL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some autistics possess an "excellent       A Microsoft executive is quoted:  "Bill
ability of logical abstract thinking."     is just smarter than everyone else."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Autistics suffer "impairment of social     A former girlfriend is quoted:  "People
interaction with others."                  who know Bill know that you have to
                                           bring him into a group... because he
                                           doesn't have the social skills to do it
                                           on his own."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many autistics show "repetitive or         "While he is working, he rocks... His
auotomatic movements, such as spasms,      upper body rocks down to an almost
tics. rocking."  Some autistic children    45 degree angle, rocks back up, rocks
"rock back and forth"                      down again.  "They claim I started at
                                           an extremely young age," said Gates.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Autistic children sometimes suffer         "If he strongly disagrees with what
"sudden panics or rages, and scream or     you're saying, [Gates] is in the habit
hit out uncontrollably"                    of blurting out, 'That's the stupidest
                                           f...ing thing I've ever heard!'  People
                                           tell stories of Gates spraying saliva
                                           into the face of some hapless employee."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Autistics "do not make eye contact."       "He did not look at me very often but
                                           either looked down as he was talking
                                           or lifted his eyes above my head to
                                           look out the window."

The home of one autistic family had a      "He has planned a full-size trampoline

family, at times, likes to jump and
flap their arms."
