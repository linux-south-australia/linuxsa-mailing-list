<H1>Letter to A-G re DeCSS</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>

Attached is a rough first draft of a proposed letter from
LinuxSA to the federal Attorney-General.

 1) Do we want to send a letter about DeCSS and the
    ability to play DVDs from Linux.

 2) If so, is this approximately right.

If the concensus is that we want to send a letter, I'll
tidy the draft, send it to a few journalists I know for
polishing, and bring it to the next meeting.  At the meeting
we would vote unanimously to send it and add our signatures
after those of the LinuxSA convenors.

Once we've done one letter, it's easy enough to CC: the
state A-G, etc.

To make my life easier, please address responses concerning
(1) to the list, major suggestions on (2) to the list, and
minor typos and proofreads directly to me.

 Earth is a single point of failure

Dear Sir,

LinuxSA is concerned that the Attorney-General may only be hearing the
views of the MPAA about the computer software "DeCSS".

Our concern is prompted by the Attorney-General's extraordinary
attendence at a rapidly-arranged meeting with representatives of the
United States' MPAA.  The Australian Linux community has not yet been
invited to meet with the Attorney-General.

Linux is an operating system for computers.  The most famous operating
system is Microsoft's Windows: Linux currently competes with Windows
on high-end PCs from all the major PC manufacturers.  Linux is an
effort of an Internet-connected community: it has no one owner, it is
free, and all its details are published.  Australians have been
major contributors to the development of Linux.

LinuxSA is a South Australian club of Linux users.  About two
hundred### people attend its monthly meetings.  Similar clubs exist in
every city and most large towns.

DeCSS is software written by the international Linux community that
unscrambles the Content Scrambling System on Digital Video Disks,
allowing DVD movies to be played on computers that run the Linux
operating system.


DE-CSS DISCOVERS A TRADE SECRET

The Content Scrambling System is a trade secret of the DVD CCA.  It is
perfectly legal to fairly seek to uncover a trade secret: people are
allowed to cook as many chickens as they please in an attempt to
determine the nature of KFC's "11 secret herbs and spices".

The Linux community undertook to reverse engineer the Content
Scrambling System so that computers running the Linux operating system
could play DVD movies.

The Linux community chose not to pay a license fee to the DVD CCA to
gain access to the trade secret of the Content Scrambling System.  This
choice is well within their rights.

They chose not to do so as secrecy is directly opposed to the Linux
ethos.  The Linux operating system is written by a large
Internet-connected community sharing their computer source code at no
charge.  A trade secret licensing scheme is simply unworkable in this
environment: each of the thousands of Linux contributors would need
to have access to the trade secret.



DE-CSS IS NOT NEEDED FOR UNAUTHORISED COPYING OF DVDS

We are concerned that the Attorney General may believe public
statements of the US DVD CCA that claim the Linux community developed
DeCSS to allow the unauthorised reproduction of DVDs.  This is not
true.  ###Attach public statement###

Unauthorised copies of DVDs can be made without decoding the
content, just as you can photocopy a newspaper article written
in the Japanese language without decoding it.



DE-CSS MAY REDUCE THE PROFITS OF U.S MOVIE DISTRIBUTORS

DVDs are marked with a "region code".  DVD players are also marked
with a region code.  Most DVD players will only play a movie when the
region codes match.

This coding is an attempt by motion picture manufacturers to prevent
the free international trade of DVDs.  This prevents the resale of
DVDs from a country where they are cheap to a country where they are
expensive.

There are strong parallels to the marketing of CDs, where the
government decided to allow parallel importing to prevent Australian
consumers being ripped off when compared to US consumers.  ###Good
quote from ACCC###

The region coding of DVDs is a technological attempt to prevent
Australian consumers from being able to import DVDs from countries
where DVDs are cheaper.

Region coding also forces Australian movie makers to deal with major
US movie distributors in order to get the Australian movie released in
the US on DVD.  It is designed to prevent the Australian movie maker
from offering their movie on DVD globally through a web site that
avoids the movie distributors entirely, such as through www.amazon.com.

DeCSS can read a DVD with any region coding.  This allows the
free international trade of DVDs.  This free trade has the
potential to reduce the profits of DVD movie distributors.

We believe that preventing the loss of income derived from DVD region
coding is the real motivation of the DVD CCA in its opposition to
DeCSS.

We believe that this income is a transfer of funds from Australian
consumers to US DVD distributors.  We believe that region coding
disadvantages Australian-owned movie distributors.  We note that
only US movie distributors are members of the DVD CCA.###



AUSTRALIAN WEBSITE OWNERS ARE BEING THREATENED

We are concerned that the US MPAA is harassing Australian website
owners to remove the DeCSS program.  Their letters claim that hosting
the DeCSS software is illegal -- essentially stating that the ruling
of a Californian judge applies to Australian web sites.  This claim of
jurisdiction is obvious nonsense.  The only intent of the letters can
be to make unsupportable threats to Australian website operators in
the hope that legally naive people will be scared into removing the
software.  Communications with the MPAA have revealed that these
letters were sent knowing that the websites involved are beyond US
jurisdiction.

We are concerned that the US MPAA are responsible for the arrest and
prosecution of the Norwegian author of the DeCSS code.  We expect
that Amnesty International will list this person as a politcal
prisoner.

We are concerned that the MPAA may be claiming the Norwegian
government's actions as a precedent and may be encouraging the
Australian government to take similar measures agianst the liberty of
Australians that host the DeCSS software on their websites.

To allay these concerns, we ask the Attorney-General to make available
to the Australian public the minutes of his meeting with the
represenatives of the MPAA.


LINUX GIVES AUSTRALIA A NEW INDUSTRY

Australians have contributed to the development of Linux from its
beginning in 19xx.###  Some of these people are now employed by
international companies such as LinuxCare (in Canberra) or Red Hat
Software (in Brisbane).  Many more of these people act as private
consultants, often contracting with US firms.

Australia's geographical position, a hemisphere away from the US,
gives Australia a competitive advantage.  It is an ideal location to
position one of three service centres that are required by companies
that seek to offer around-the-clock service.  Our lifestyle and low
cost of living are attractive when compared to Silicon Valley.

We expect that Linux-related services will be a major earner of net
foreign income for Australia.  Australia is in a strong internationally
competitive position.

This position could be eroded instantly by ill-considered changes to
copyright or patent legislation.  We already have some loss of
international competitiveness due to our high telecommunications
prices and onerous Internet censorship laws.

To date, Australia's copyright and patent laws have allowed Linux to
florish.  It is legal to reverse engineer the function of a product.
Computer programming languages are free from copyright.  Most software
algorithms cannot be patented.  It is possible to export code
containing cyptographic functions.

A change in these laws would could prevent Australians from
participating in the development of Linux and could deny Australia
companies the ability to offer Linux-based services to the world.

In the absense of published minutes from the Attorney-General's
meeting with the MPAA, we believe that the MPAA may have been
suggesting that some or all of these laws be altered to disadvantage
Australian Linux services companies and advantage the US movie
distribution industry.

We encourage the Attorney-General to consider the impact of legislative
changes on Australian Linux services companies and Australian Linux
users, especially changes to the Copyright Act, Patents ###.



REQUEST FOR MEETING


We also ask that the Attorney-General meet with members of the
Australian Linux community.  We assume that the Attorney-General's
meeting with representaives of the MPAA shows that he is deeply
interested in this issue.  We hope that he will not choose to be
briefed only by lobbyists for the US motion piucture industry.
