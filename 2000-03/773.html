 &gt; &gt; Ok, yes, I understnd that you'd take some of the bits of the joke
 &gt; &gt; a bit personally.  But perhaps we need to get something else straight:
 &gt; &gt; If everyone who is about to say something in public needs to think
 &gt; &gt; about whether there's someone else in earshot who might, for reasons
 &gt; &gt; unknown to anyone else, get offended by what is about to be said, then
 &gt; &gt; nobody will ever say anything at all about anything.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Exactly, it doesn't matter these days who is in earshot, we should all
 &gt; be careful of what we are saying.

So every person gets a heckler's veto over anything said by anyone 
else?

 &gt; I'm not saying that there can't be jokes.

Yes you are.  There can be no jokes because *all* jokes are offensive
to *somebody* (if you can't understand that, I challenge you to come 
up with something which is actually FUNNY which doesn't marginalize 
someone else).

 &gt; I just believe that we should all start to accept responsibility
 &gt; for what we say and when we say it.

Which can be loosely translated as, "Never say anything which carries
the merest possibility of offending anyone else, ever."  Which, again,
can be loosely translated as, "We should all live in fear of being 
publically vilified as a hater if we ever dare to say anything at all."

When the politically-correct say, "Take Responsibilty For What You Say,"
they invariably mean, "Don't say it."  That is, after all, your point
in this particular discussion, isn't it?

 &gt; Personally I didn't find the joke funny

Of course you didn't.  But that doesn't mean it wasn't funny (right, 
guys?  Huh?)
 
 &gt; &gt; 800 opinions there's pretty much ALWAYS going to be at least one who
 &gt; &gt; will take any comment on any issue personally; does that mean that
 &gt; &gt; any comment on any issue should be kept silent 
 &gt; 
 &gt; No. It just means we have to be careful what we say. I see the List as a
 &gt; means where people help others where there is a possible forum of 600
 &gt; (or how many is on it). I just couldn't see the point of the attachment
 &gt; of such nature being made public, they should have kept it off-list and
 &gt; to themselves.

Sorry, but I don't quite follow here:  You've made it sound like this:

   "They should have kept it off-list and to themselves"

follows logically from this:

   "I just couldn't see the point of the attachment of such nature being
   made public."

Whether you can see the point at all bears no relation whatsoever to
whether it should be kept off-list.

This list isn't *just* a Linux help list;  it has always carried free
wheeling conversation, comments about Microsoft, jokes, and all kinds
of other things which bear no relation to Linux at all.  

What you are doing now is coming into a pre-existing forum and imposing
your personal view of which topics are ok and topics which are taboo.
Believe it or not, there are some people who find that attitude as offensive
as you found the joke about Bill Gates.

 &gt; &gt; [ inviting public vilification on someone is something else which,
 &gt; &gt;   perhaps, should give pause for thought.  Is that *really* the outcome
 &gt; &gt;   you want from conversations on a civilized mailing list? 
 &gt; 
 &gt; If I was too harsh, then I will be the first to apologise,

... yeeeeaaaas... ?  

 &gt; but,

Ah, that magic word -- The one which means you don't think it's too harsh,
you won't apologies, and it's perfectly ok to invite public vilification
on someone for something said on a mailing list.

That's ok, but bear in mind that you're showing yourself to be rather
*less* tolerant and understanding than the types of people who make fun
of those with disabilities (at least they don't urge other people to make
fun of them too!)

 &gt; a civilised list wouldn't have carried something that may be detrimental
 &gt; to someone else.

Fine, we're uncivilized.  Deal.

 &gt; Have you ever been shopping with an autistic child, tried to receive
 &gt; love from an autistic child, get the attention of an autistic child.

No.  I do, however, sing in a choir with an Autistic man.  During the 
first rehersal for every concert when nobody knows the music he'll 
say, "It doesn't sound very good, does it?  I don't think I'll sing
in this concert because we're not very good at it."  At every rehersal
he'll have the same smalltalk conversation with each of the two or
three people he's "connected" with ("What do you think of the music?
Will you be singing in this concert?  It's hard work, isn't it?").  
Believe me, I completely understand the frustration of dealing with
someone who can't learn from the past, has very little perception of
the difference between past, present and future, and who can't perceive
things from perspectives other than their own.  I can't begin imagine
the difficulties of living it day-in-day-out with it for years.

However, one of the ways that people make sense of difficulties is
by laughing at them;  I found the Bill Gates stuff funny *because* I
spend three hours per week with an autistic man who exhibits many of
the same traits lampooned in the joke.  And, incidentally, that doesn't
mean I enjoy making fun of autistic people, it means I enjoy making fun
of Bill Gates (whether or not he happens to be autistic too).

 &gt; &gt;   ask you to think about how much you really want to be subscribed to
 &gt; &gt;   the list, and whether your needs might be better served elsewhere ]
 &gt; 
 &gt; No thankyou, I'm staying right here where my needs are served. Just
 &gt; because there was one issue that hit a raw nerve isn't a means to dispel
 &gt; them from a public forum. It's the insesitive issues that have to be
 &gt; addressed, not the people they are making fun at.

So who, exactly, was being made fun of by the Bill Gates posting?  
I thought it was Bill Gates, but you seem to think it was the entire 
subset of human beings who suffer from autism.  I find this difference
in perspective interesting, if perplexing, and it seems clear that it
goes a long way towards understanding why the posting "hit a raw nerve."
Can you identify the difference between a slur on an individual, and a 
slur on a group to which that individual belongs?

 &gt; I can have fun and a
 &gt; good joke, but not at the expense of others, it's not needed.

Again, I challenge you to find any joke at all which *isn't* "at the expense
of others".  Perhaps you have your own personal idea of what that phrase
means, but I guarantee that someone, somewhere, will have an opinion about
it that is different enough that they'll be mortally offended by a joke
you think it perfectly innocent, leading them to demand that you "take 
responsibility" for the joke... Or, in other words, "Shut the hell up."

So you're left with two alternatives:  Go through life being terribly,
terribly serious about anything and everything lest you offend someone
(That's called "taking responsibility for your words"), or relaxing,
accepting that you can't please all of the people all of the time, and
saying what you feel good about saying (which is often called "harrassment,"
"vilification," or, in extreme cases, a "hate crime").

 &gt; This is a Linux list,

No, it's more than that.  You'd do well to think about that for a while
before you tell everyone else what they can and can't talk about.
