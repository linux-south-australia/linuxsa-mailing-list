Now, I am not normally the one to complain, and I am the first to admit =
that a third year uni student may not be the most appropriate candidate =
for attendance at such a high-calibre event, but damn when its =
international and when its Internet, im interested.

What am I talking about?

The IETF Conferences being held in Adelaide from March 26 in the =
Convention Center (which i am sure everyone already knows about).  I =
mean, at *least* I just want to satisfy my curiosity as to what goes on =
at such meets ... or does each member play an active part in developing =
the standards or something?!

So what annoys me?

US$475 Annoys me ... thats what...an insurmountable financial gap for a =
uni student like myself.

What do others think?
Am I just an over-ambitious geek or does my idealism of students being =
let into such things for next-to-nothing a stupid idea?

I mean its not like were going to get 35 year old US CEO's faking =
South-Aussie uni ID's :-D
(although that would make one hell of a /. post:)
