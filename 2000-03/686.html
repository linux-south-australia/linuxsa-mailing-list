1. What is the difference between internic and aunic?

Internic is the body that used to assign IP addresses.  Aunic was assigned
a large chunk and sub-assigned those.  I believe both organisations have
closed; Asia Pacific addresses are now assigned by apnic, but I think that
there are none left to be handed out.

2. Why is it that some domains are found with internic and others with
   aunic? ie whilst doing a whois

Probably addresses assigned before aunic was formed, or by peole who went
to internic instead of aunic.

Addresses are handled by separate body to domains.

Control of top level domains has become a political and commercial bunfight.
A single company was given control of the top level domain, but now US wants
to have multiple competing adminstrators.  A single person was given control
of the .au domain, and he delegated control of .com.au to a single company,
but now there is an attempt to have multiple competing .com.au administrators.
Neither US nor Australia has yet proven successful in the attempts to remove
the domain naming monopoly, and the companies involved have become fabulously
wealthy so it's easy to understand why there is such a big bunfight.

I think.
