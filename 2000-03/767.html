Oh come on.  It was a joke, ferchrissakes (and an old one at that).

 &gt; The reason for my angry response -  I HAVE AN AUTISTIC SON !!!!!!!

Ok, yes, I understnd that you'd take some of the bits of the joke
a bit personally.  But perhaps we need to get something else straight:
If everyone who is about to say something in public needs to think
about whether there's someone else in earshot who might, for reasons
unknown to anyone else, get offended by what is about to be said, then
nobody will ever say anything at all about anything.

You're on a mailing list with 600 people, which means that on any 
given issue there is likely to be about 800 opinions.  Out of those
800 opinions there's pretty much ALWAYS going to be at least one who
will take any comment on any issue personally; does that mean that
any comment on any issue should be kept silent let it invite responses
urging the public vilification of the poster?

[ inviting public vilification on someone is something else which,
  perhaps, should give pause for thought.  Is that *really* the outcome
  you want from conversations on a civilized mailing list? If so, I'd
  ask you to think about how much you really want to be subscribed to
  the list, and whether your needs might be better served elsewhere ]
