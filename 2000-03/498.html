&gt; &gt; I have already tried using smix in the past and have changed the volume
&gt; &gt; of the cd off the mute setting (the changes are reflected in both the
&gt; &gt; mp3 progs I use and the cd player I use) - to no avail when i play a cd
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; back to square one
&gt;
&gt; most cards have a cd-in and, an aux connector of same type. Plug
&gt; it into aux,
&gt; just for the hell of it. This problem happened to me on a vibra
&gt; 16 (sheesh, of
&gt; all things). That was the inital cure, the mixer was the final one.
&gt;
&gt; secondly run, set and quit smix, then run it again. Check to see that the
&gt; previous settings remain. ( ican't help you specifically because
&gt; i don't use
&gt; smix, and i don't run suse)


Abhinav,

For the record, on playing with my SuSe installation last night, there
were all sorts of freaky things to do with sound in /etc/conf.modules.

After commenting/uncommenting the bits it told me to comment/uncomment, and,
I'm afraid to say, rebooting (my ignorance of SuSe there)..  it whinged
horribly (horribly) about /etc/conf.modules being newer than
/lib/modules/2.2.13/conf.modules at boot time, then updated itself and
suddenly everything seemed to work.  CDs played A-Ok (HOORAY! ..  remind me
to buy a real cd player one day...  I go crazy every time I have a sound
issue with my PC.. ) and I could `play /usr/somewhere/something.au`.

Now to download mpg123.

Can you 'cat /dev/sndstat'?

On another topic - If anybody wants a nice looking, sleek, smooth, groovy,
small, simple-ish window manager that looks better than twm (a-hem), give
ICEWM a go.  It's niiiiice :)

Have fun!
