&gt; Has anyone heard of such a thing as an internal UPS or an integrated UPS/PC

&gt; some obvious reason why such devices do not exist (if, in fact, they do not
&gt; exist?)... Also, on a similar train of thought, what about an internal
&gt; switch or hub? I'd like to see a server appliance that is UPS protected, and
&gt; provides 8-16 100BaseT ports, has no monitor or keyboard, and is controlled
&gt; entirely by a few buttons on the front and a web interface... sort of
&gt; Cobalt-like (see www.colbalt.com), but with UPS and Switching (and a few
&gt; other things that can wait till later to be discussed)... Any comments?

UPSs use lead-acid batteries, so you have to allow for a hydrogen
discharge.  PCs are not engineered to be non-igniting.  Adding this
engineering gets expensive given the physical size of the PC's
motherboard that has to be enclosed.  You also have to allow
for leaks -- a gell battery will split and leak if heated.

Even PABXs with "integrated" UPSs actually have a different
floor mounted chassis for the UPS.  Just the cladding looks
the same as the main unit.

Someone suggested using notebook batteries.  This would be fine
for one machine, but this rapidly becomes uneconomic for a cluster
of machines.

I've no idea why you'd want an internal ethernet switch on a computer.
For small numbers of ports, VLANs make more sense.  For larger port
counts, attaching it to a PC will force fate-sharing with the PC:
ie: your network stops when the hard disk on the computer dies.
