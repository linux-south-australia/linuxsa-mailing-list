Whether it's source code or not doesn't matter;  it's whether it's 
*hardcopy*.

The First Amendment to the US constitution is very clear about freedom
of the presses, and the Supreme Court has a history of interpreting 
that freedom very broadly (even if state and federal congresses haven't).
So the Government knows it can't legally restrict a book.  So if you 
print your code out on paper and send it by snailmail out of the 
country, that's legal.

If you use the 'net to do the same thing, the Government has historically
argued that since that doesn't involve a "press", freedom of the press is
irrelevent.  Programming, they say, is not "speech," so free speech rules
don't apply.  Some courts have agreed with them, some have concluded that
the academic discourse between crypto researchers who express their ideas
in software definitely count as speech, so export should be ok.  

PGP 5.0 was exported from the US as a 13-volume book published by
MIT press, which contained the complete source code in an OCR-friendly
font with a CRC at the end of each line and the end of each page which
could be used to error-check the process of scanning it back in.  During
a hacker festival in the Netherlands, several hundred people took on
the task of getting the software to compile, whereupon it was published
on ftp servers in many other countries which don't have fucked-in-the-head
crypto export laws.  That's how we saw the world's first legally exported
version of PGP reach world-wide availability.

Anyway, the US Govt recently relaxed its crypto export regulations.
You can export any freely-distributable software as source code; you
do need to send a once-off advisory of the software's URL to the US
Commerce Dept, though.  Technically, that means software like PGP and
the upcoming Mozilla M14 (which will have SSL) can now be legally
exported.
