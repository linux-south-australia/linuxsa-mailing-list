&gt; 
&gt; Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop.  Also known as xDSL because there are
&gt; a number of different DSLs with various characteristics.
&gt; 
&gt; ADSL uses the existing copper between the exchange and your house to send
&gt; high speed data as well as voice.  Data is sent at frequencies outside of
&gt; speech.  The speed of the forward data path need not be the same as the
&gt; reverse path, so for example you can receive data at millions of bits per
&gt; second but only send at thousands of bits per second.
&gt; 
&gt; Everyone is excited about ADSL because your computer is permanently
&gt; connected to the internet (but note that you pay for data) and at very high
&gt; speeds (eg 56k is very slow.)

Well your computer maybe permantly connected to the 'net. It is just like
with modems but faster(if fact it is a modem, just a very quick one). 

Same for data costs this will all depend on what
ISP/telco you use and their policies/acccounts just liek it is with
modems or any other media, I would think that the pricing model would be
simliar to cable access.

This is by the way no reason people can't have dsl now if they live
close enough to their ISP and are willing to buy the endpoint equipment(Ie
a pair of dsl modems). I suspect after that it is about as exspensve as
leasing the line.

In fact I believe many ISPs use this technology to connect to their
upstream providers to some extent or other.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know how slowly Telstra will go over rollout of xDSL.  It might
&gt; well be years before it's available in your home in Adelaide.

Someone told me that Adeliade was going to be a test market(because we
are not liekly to ever get cable I think was the reason).
Although when I asked about it at a Telstra shop on Sunday the guy dialed
their phone ot Bigpiond and handed me the handset(after me tellling him
what DSL was he was as seems to be typical with telco employeesa bit
defieicnt in the area of telecmunictiaons/data technology knowledge).
