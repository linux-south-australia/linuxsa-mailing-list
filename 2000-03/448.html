&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At my school I just added a Linux box with Squid to cache
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything as we get charged for downloads.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; FWIW - the NSW govt doesn't allow a local proxy at the school
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here in Broken Hill - they like to track all web site visits per
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machine.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; They've got a state-wide proxy?
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; Same with SA.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Not surprising - it's the same proxy.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The "sa.edu" network is an extension of the same network used in
&gt; &gt; Vic, NSW and Qld.  And, as list users from schools can probably attest,
&gt; &gt; it sucks ass.  No local servers (because all the schools are NAT'ed,
&gt; &gt; and their addresses are invisible to the outside world), no permanent
&gt; &gt; connectivity (it's dial on demand up to 128k), web pages have to be
&gt; &gt; kept on the sa.edu web server in Victoria at an exorbitant $/Mbyte charge,
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Think for a moment about the "no local servers" requirement:  What happens
&gt; &gt; when student A at a school sends a 10 Mbyte attachment by email to
&gt; &gt; students B, C, D, E and F ?  The school doesn't have a local mail server!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 

Also, It makes life a little difficult when I used to run ssh on the
servers so I could access them from home. The only option now is to use a
modem allowing dial-in. Problem of couse is that this isn't encouraged.

&gt; Students sending large E-Mails? That doesn't happen... Ha Ha Ha Ha. My
&gt; students are on their own seperate mail server. They're limited to 120K
&gt; per e-mail. I am  *not* popular.
&gt; 

We have found a bigger problem in people using the school's bandwidth for
useless downloads like a 60 MB demo of c&c tiberian sun. Of couse, they
used someone else's account not their own in the hope noone would notice.


&gt; Next: Use samba as a file server and
... tada! Instant
Disk Quotas. &gt; Without having to pay a fortune in 3rd party software.
&gt; 

So far, email has been surprisingly controlled. For 500 students, we have
a total of 15 meg of email.
