Having contacted Optus about @Home, there is no short or long term plans to
bring cable to SA.

Telstra are a bit misleading, in that the websites suggest that if you have
foxtel (via cable) then you can have cable modem.

The truth, both are currently only offering Cable to Melbourne, Sydney and
Melbourne. Anywhere else is basically a non entity in the cable modem
stakes.

&gt;From what I can gather there is no other provider, otherwise there would be
big noises being made about it everywhere (they would be making buckets of
money!!).

Good luck..

Rob.

Subject: [mostly OT] Cable Internet access


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; First off, do people know who provide cable internet access, and wether
it's
&gt; possible use these connections from a linux box?
&gt;
&gt; Optus's cable service's web page says it's only available in the eastern
&gt; states, but doesn't say when/if it'll ever be available in SA (or at least
I
&gt; couldn't find it). Telstra's web site had me believe that's it's available
&gt; in all states (there wasn't any mention of which states it was available),
&gt; but when I called for more info, they told me it's not available here.
&gt;
&gt; Are there any other cable providers? any in SA?
&gt;
&gt; Also, if any cable service does come to SA, will we be able to use it from
&gt; our Linux boxes? I don't see why not, but (as usual), the only 'supported'
&gt; platforms are Windows 9x/NT and the Mac. like I said, I don't see why it
&gt; wouldn't work, since it uses an ethernet interface (I don't know the
correct
&gt; term), but from what I read, there's some software that you need to
install,
&gt; and perhaps they somehow check if you're running it?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for the info, and sorry that it's off topic. Is there perhaps a
&gt; better e-mail list to post this to? This is the only mailing list I'm
&gt; subscribed to (and that I know of that's Australian) :)
&gt;
