&gt; I just had a phone call from a friend in Adelaide who needed
&gt; help with a problem that I am sure has been discussed on the
&gt; list - but I don't remember when.  I went to
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/archive-index.html</A>
&gt; and had a look - but, to the casual web-browsing-guy, it
&gt; looks unsearchable.

Well it kind of is unsearchable kind of. The main reason that LinuxSA
is unsearchable is beacuse of the lack of hard drive space. As you know
LinuxSA's web pages are hosted on the NetCraft core web server. Many
years ago when she was commissioned, we often wondered how we'd use
all that space. Now we know.

Anyway, a new web server has been built and is already running. It
will go into production service soon, and with any luck will also mean
the birth of LinuxSA searchable archives.

So to answer your question, yes, there will be a search function.

To borrow Geoffrey Bennett's quote from the 1992 Blackwood High School
Year Book...

      "Real soon now".

&gt; Is this the case?  Is the archive really unsearchable?  Are
&gt; there instructions somewhere on how to search the archive?
&gt; Can I download the whole thing as a single html file?

You could always 'wget' the pages. Personally I'd just wait, but then
I'm lazy like that :o)

Cheers

Alex!
