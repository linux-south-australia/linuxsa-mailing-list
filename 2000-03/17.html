Hi,

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; &gt; I've no idea why you'd want an internal ethernet switch on a computer.
&gt; &gt; For small numbers of ports, VLANs make more sense.  For larger port
&gt; &gt; counts, attaching it to a PC will force fate-sharing with the PC:
&gt; &gt; ie: your network stops when the hard disk on the computer dies.
&gt; 
&gt; VLANs? As in Virtual LAN? or something else? My limited understanding of
&gt; VLANs tells me that a VLAN is a way to make arbitrary devices on separate
&gt; physical ethernet segments act like they are on one segment. I fail to see
&gt; the relevance of VLANs to this environment... :) Maybe I didn''t make it
&gt; clear that this would be for a very small network of no more than 16 clients
&gt; in total, probably more like 5 or maybe 10... In fact, on rethinking, I
&gt; think that a hub would do just as good a job as a switch in this situation,
&gt; and a switch would be overkill...

That then assumes there is some routing done by the linux side then
(atleast on the internal/external side of things). 'given your
description, maybe you assumed this anyway. Even WinNT server's internet
pack (or whatever the software is called), automatically does IP
Masquerading out of the box, tho its a bugger to get it to do it in the
non-default mode.

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; shops, small accounting and law offices, etc etc. Places where people get
&gt; nervous when you mention the word "Ethernet", and practically faint if they
&gt; have to do any computer-related thinking beyond mail-merges in MS Word.

Given personal experience I had in support, mail merge seems to be a
callenge to some people as well.
