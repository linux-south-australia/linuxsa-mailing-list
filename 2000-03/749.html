Subject: RPM for solaris 2.5.1


&gt; hi all :)
&gt; i know this isn't directly a linux question but i am sure you can see
&gt; how it relates.
&gt;
&gt; i am wanting to install RPM (red hat package manager) on a sun box
&gt; running solaris 2.5.1.  i believe that this is very possible.
&gt;
&gt; my question is how do i do so?.  solaris has its own package manage,
&gt; such as pkgadd, i am wondering if there is such a thing as a package for
&gt; solaris that installs RPM?.  i have come across RPM's that installs RPM
&gt; on solaris but i guess this assumes you have RPM already installed and
&gt; are updating the version.


You can find RPM for Solaris (as in a Sun package that installs the RPM
package manager) at:

<A HREF="http://www.rpm.org/solaris.html">http://www.rpm.org/solaris.html</A>


There was a guy who maintained quite a few GNU and other software packages
in RPM format for solaris at:

<A HREF="http://www.solaris.rpm.org/">http://www.solaris.rpm.org/</A>

His site now just points you back to the RPMFIND web site, but there is a
link to his FTP site where there are still a fair few archives of Solaris
RPMS.

I used to use RPM under Solaris, and it was OK (it was easier for me to
build packages than Suns native package manager, as I had used it before),
however if you just want to install some GNU software without actually
building it yourself (which can be quite hard, as Sun do not ship a C
compiler with the OS. So you have to go through the process of downloading
gcc etc), then check out:

<A HREF="http://sunfreeware.com/">http://sunfreeware.com/</A>

 Where you can download muchos GNU and other free software as native Solaris
packages.

BTW you really should try Google (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</A>). I had used, but
forgotten where to find, all of this stuff. Entering "solaris rpm" in Google
gave the RPM site above as the top match, and "solaris gnu package" as the
top match for the freeware site.


 Regards,

 Andrew Speer
