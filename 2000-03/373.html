=================================================
Obviously not.
But even though I am _very_ comfortable indeed with the
unix paradigm of text files and filters (like TeX),
it does mean that you need to have to filters.

In MS OSs, the filters are built in to the editing tools.
I.e. your display/print/import/export functions are
all built in to your proprietary-format document
reader/writer. 
In unix, we use one set of tools (text editors) to
read/write source files, and another set of tools
(like TeX, LaTeX, ghostscript, xdvi, ...) to
convert the source files to other formats or
print/display them.

Therefore, what I meant was that the MS world
can't do the edit/compile/display squence with
them, which we use inthe unix world as a
replacement for WYSIAYG (What you see is all you get)
integrated applications in the MS and Mac worlds.

So now I come conveniently to a question arising:

What is the all-round preferred TeX system for MS users?
When my MS colleagues saw what nice output I got from
TeX under linux, they wanted to know how to run TeX
on their systems.

I found MiKTeX on the net.
Is this the preferred TeX on MS?
[Please, please don't waste time/effort/emotion
to tell me that MS must not be discussed here.
If you must flame, please flame direct, and
spare the innocents.]

On the net, I found resources as indicated in:

<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/tex.html">http://www.topology.org/tex.html</A>

teTeX is clearly the standard for linux.
But what can we offer to MS users to help
them get into the linux way of doing things?

Best Regards,
Alan Kennington.
