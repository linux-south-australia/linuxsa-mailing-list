&gt; Kinda like the SA gov't people who spend all their time trying to attract
&gt; big name organizations to SA and ignore the immense local talent we have
&gt; here :-)

I hear that SA gov't didn't even make a representation to
Red Hat to ask them to locate their Australian operations
here.

Bizarre, especially when you look at the distribution of
Linux programmers.  Canberra and Adelaide really stand
out as the places to be if you want to source good development
people.

SA is also a good site for a service centre: both labour and
real estate prices are low.

Our location outside the east coast isn't the hassle you
might think: it is currently very cheap to fly at corporate
prices and both airlines provide excellent meeting facilties
at their terminals.  The decreasing number of direct flights
is an issue.

Certainly being outside of the east coast wages explosion is
a win.  As is the fact that most people live in Adelaide for
the lifestyle.  This makes them very unlikely to leave your
company if you treat and manage them well.

The downsides are:

 - some negative lifestyle issues: mainly shopping hours

 - a small supply of good executive, management and
   marketing people.  What's worse, there seems to be a
   lack of willingness to measure the performance of this
   class of worker, reward the good ones and fire the bad
   ones.  So the probabilty of you getting a shocking project
   manager seems to be much higher here in SA than elsewhere.

 - an upcoming lack of good cheap optical communications.
