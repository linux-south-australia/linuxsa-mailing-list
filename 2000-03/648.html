The IETF -- The Internet Engineering Task Force, who are the people who
design the internet protocols -- are meeting here in Adelaide this week.
This is a rare occurrence, and Glen Turner, who is one of Adelaide's
network gurus, has organised a real treat for us to enjoy.  He has asked
some of the IETF members -- who are experts in their fields --- to present
a series of lunchtime seminars.

Tuesday's seminar, "Telephony over IP", will be presented by Stephen
Kingham, from CSIRO, in Flentje lecture theatre, between 12pm and 1pm.

......................................................................

The first seminar, on the topic of Internet 2, was presented by E. Paul
Love, who is chair of the Internet2 Topology Working Group.

I gained the understanding that Internet2 is a high speed, IPv6 based
network.  The primary users are USA academic institution, although both
private companies and international organisations are also connected.  The
purpose of the network is to research high speed networks and applications
that can benefit from them.

The network is a series of "gigapops" usually connected by high speed
links.  Some isolated areas have been (or still are) limited by relatively
low links; although since apparently "low speed" is measured in
multi-megabits per second I have little sympathy for them!

Internet 2 exists through the generosity of various commercial and
governmental gifts, for example equipment vendors donate equipment, and
long distance carriers donate bandwidth.  It seems that a very few carriers
provide most of the physical links.  [I wonder if it's a good thing to have
important research infrastructure at the mercy of a telco's good will?]

Latency (the time it takes for data to cross the network) is an important
issue.  In one application a tunnelling microscope (I think) cannot be
controlled from further away than 900 miles: beyond that distance the
commands to control it take so long to traverse the network that the device
can slam into the sample.  An analogy was made to remote-medicine, with a
surgeon "holding" a remote scalple!

Another application that takes advantage of Internet 2 is remote control of
radio telescope.  Scientists traditionally have to book time on large
telescopes, and fly there when their time is scheduled.  Now they can avoid
the expense of travel and control the telescope over Internet 2.

The only negative comment I would make is that too much time was spent on
the physical infrastructure of Internet 2.  Never the less we were presented
with some good insight into future directions of the Internet.

The 47th meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force is occuring in
Adelaide from 26 until 31 March.  The meeting collected togeth the people
that have built the Internet.

Some attendees at the meeting have graciously offered to give one hour free
presentations to computer scientists, students and the public.

The times and locations of the remaining seminars are:

Tuesday 28, 12 - 1pm

   Telephony over IP
   Stgephen Kingham, CSIRO
   Flentje lecture theatre, Plaza Building

Wednesday 29th, 12 - 1pm

   Measuring Internet performance
   Matt Zekauskas, Advanced Network & Services
   Horace Lamb lecture theatre, Horace Lamb Building

Thursday 30th, 12 - 1pm

   IP version 6
   Bob Fink, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
   Horace Lamb lecture theatre, Horace Lamb Building

Friday 31st, 12 - 1pm

   To be announced
   Horace Lamb lecture theatre, Horace Lamb Building

Organised by the Department of Computer Science at The University of
Adelaide and by the Australian Academic and Research Network.  We thank the
presenters and the IETF.
