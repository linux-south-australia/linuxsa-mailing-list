Just a query here - why do you have a DENY on your output rule?

&gt; I can work out most of it (I think), 24.95.230.77 (pinecastle-ubr-c4-77.cfl.rr.com) has tried to gain access on port 2375.

No, they tried to access "139.130.81.81:25" from "24.95.230.77:2375"

&gt;         1. PROTO=6

TCP (from memory).  It's the numeric protocol type.

&gt;         2. L=48 S=0x00 I=53635 F=0x4000 T=107 SYN (#40) ?

Some flags - the only one I guess you'd really care about is SYN, which
means it was the first part of a TCP 3 way handshake (the initial open).

&gt;         3. Port 2375 is used for ? (its not in /etc/services)

That's the source port, not the destination.  Unless otherwise
specified, when making outbound connections you grab the next
free/sequential port number.  It's just an outbound connection
from a remote box - all you really care about here is the IP
address.

&gt;         4. Significance of 139.130.81.81:25 ? (unions.lnk.telstra.net) - is someone trying to e-mail bounce from us?

That would be the IP address of your interface to Telstra, I'd suspect.
Someone (legitimate or otherwise) is trying to connect to your SMTP port.
Do you have sendmail running on this box?  Is it listed in an MX record
somewhere?  If it is, and you've sealed it off, people may have a hard
time mailing you :-).

&gt;         5. Whilst nslookup gives you the FQDN, (apart from the obvious .au etc) is there a way to work out what/where they are?

You can use "whois" to determine (to some extent) the "owners" of
the IP address.

&gt; Should I be concerned?

My opinion is no, these days.  The fact that you have your box tightened
is good, but you will get these sort of probes all the time (one of the
name servers I maintain has port 80 probed many times an hour, despite
the fact that that IP address has never had a web server on it in its
life). With the new culture of "script kiddies" (where wannabe-hackers
run someone else's programs that are designed to probe/break into boxes),
this sort of thing is flourishing, and you'll just lose a lot of hair
trying to track it down.

&gt; PS Did this come through as HTML?

Yes.

&gt; We have an exchange box here

My commiserations.  :-)
