&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;I have recently taken on a project to get a Linux distro of some sort running
&gt;on two SGI "MIPS based" workstations currently running IRIX.

I think that this is going to be a major undertaking :-(

&gt;The worksations are about 4 years old running 133Mhz processors, 1gb SCSI
&gt;drive, 32mb RAM, 19" SYNC on Green monitors etc.

Hmmm, sounds like a MIPS R4000 or better system.  I have a DECstation
5000/240, which was the fastes R3000 based system that DEC made.

SGI ran their MIPS processors in big-endian mode, while Digital ran theirs
in little-endian mode. Legacy of DEC's PDP 11s vs SGI's Moto 68000 based
systems.

If you don't understand the difference between LE and BE, you may be
ill-equiped for the project.

&gt;After doing a bit of browsing over then net I have discovered a number of
&gt;people
&gt;have done it before, and I even stumbled over a dead-link to a RH5.2 for SGI
&gt;MIPS PC's, yet I still haven't found any "HOW-TO" type of articles etc about
&gt;the place.
&gt;
&gt;Is there anybody out there who has done (or attempted) this before, or would
&gt;know any way of doing such a thing.
&gt;Thx in advance for any help.

Well, I think you are going to have to boot strap your way up. Start with
IRIX and GCC and compile Linux up under IRIX.  

You will need to have at least a console driver and SCSI driver built into
the kernel.  You will also need a bootstrap loader.  The console firmware
will probably understand how to read the bootblocks in from the first few
sectors on the disk.  These bootblocks will probably know enough about the
layout of the IRIX file system to be able to load in the boot loader.  You
may well need a different bootloader, and might want to use an approach
similar to what Linux uses with LILO.  But then, NetBSD probably runs on
SGI MIPS boxes so it may have some ideas about how to load things.

So, I would suggest that there are some serious problems to overcome.
