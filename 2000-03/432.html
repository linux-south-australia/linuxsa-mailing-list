I got sent this link from a friend and I wrote him this quick
reply. I thought it may be of some interest/amusement
to people on the list.

&gt;   Your views pls

Just another reporter writing about a topic he thinks he knows
a lot about because he once visited a web site.

Some major problems in his argument.

"Most system administrators are incredibly promiscuous with
the root account" - Then they deserve what they get.

"these days, with more and more Linux programs being distributed
as binary RPMs, many system administrators don't even have the
source-code for the programs that they are installing" - Just because
you have the source code doesn't mean it doesn't have a virus. Who
reads the source code before installing an app? It is all about trusting
your software supplier! RedHat put security in  the RPM spec specifically
so RPMs cannot be tampered with. Therefore if you trust the source
then you can trust the RPM file.

"Since many Linux computers reside on the Internet, there's another
exciting way that a virus could propagated: by exploiting security
holes in network servers and obtaining root remotely." - Can anyone
say Back Orifice.

"a similar worm was attacking Redhat 5.0 systems through a well-
publicized vulnerability in the IMAP server" - Are we seriously expected
to believe that anyone who is concerned about security is still using
RH5.0 or if so has not patched the exploit. Are we dragging up 2 year
old exploits because we can't find any more recent ones?

"No, what's stopped the spread of viruses on the Linux platform isn't
technology, but the lack of interest from the virus writers." - No, what's
stopped the spread of viruses on the Linux platform is the inability
for a reliable means of mass distribution (the only requirement for a
successful virus).

"But if the economy goes south, we're likely to see a suddenly bloom
of viruses from out-of-work overachievers." - Do I really have to dignify
this with a response!

Linux (and the other versions of Unix) desperately needs credible
anti-virus software to stave off the coming epidemic before it happens.
- Anti-virus software works by scanning for the virus files/pattern which
isn't very useful when there aren't any viruses of any note on Linux.
Security
software that monitors network, disk and memory activity is another
whole kettle of fish altogether.

"What's needed instead is an anti-virus package that will intercept and stop
viruses dead in their tracks." - Again can anyone say Firewall. What he is
talking about here is not an anti-virus but security package. They may
achieve the same goal, stopping viruses, but they do it from a very
different
angle. Anti-virus software deals with the problem once you already have it.
Security apps prevent you from getting it in the first place. This is
exactly
why linux doesn't suffer from viruses. Very good network/process/memory/
disk separation-security!

"Such an anti-virus package would detect and stop attempts to modify the
kernel, to modify programs" - RTFM - Tripwire.
<A HREF="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/">http://www.tripwiresecurity.com/</A>

"would detect and stop ... hostile connections to remote systems"
- Detection of network attack sequences is a very specialised and not the
sort of thing that anti-virus software does.

"Let's just hope that this kind of anti-virus software becomes common in
the Linux world before flu season comes." - Let's just hope that this kind
of
FUD journalism becomes less common in the linux world before I hit someone.
