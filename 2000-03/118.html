Hi All...

I'm doing some work for a company who is interested in moving their Sybiz
accounting system to the web, using Linux as a server. (They are pretty
vague on the exact goals, but it suffices to say that they are interested in
using Linux because it's free, stable and cool, and the web because of
remote access considerations... There are other options that they are
looking at too..)

Anyway, a little about the company (who for their own reasons, don't wish to
be identified, so bear with the non-specific nature of some of this
email)... They are a manufacturer (assembler, really) and distributor of
products, and sell to businesses, government departments, and consumers.
They have a head office in Melbourne, with somewhere between 40 and 80
people, and they have about 5 offices around Australia, with 10-20 people
each. In total, I believe they have around 120-150 people. Total turnover
approaches $100Million...

Each of the branch offices is fairly independant, but they all use Melbourne
for sourcing their parts, and the Adelaide office pretty much runs the
Darwin office.

What they are looking for is some sort of system which will enable each
office to do their own accounting, but have this accessible remotely. In
particular, Adelaide needs to see Darwin's accounts, and Melbourne would
like to see all accounts (although Adelaide would rather they didn't... :)
I'm not sure how much access is needed remotely -- whether it's just reports
or full access...

On top of this, they'd really like it if their dealers could place orders
direct on the net. In the future, it is also possible that this would extend
to business/government customers and/or private consumers. The orders should
be able to be tracked by the customer from the web, and so on and so forth.
If I understand what they want correctly, it's basically a fairly
sophisticated e-commerce system, along with an ERP/Accounting system,
preferably integrated, and mostly web-accessible.

So where does Linux come into this? Well, the Adelaide office has heard of
Linux, and is keen on it. Cheaper, more reliable, and cooler. It is also a
market space that isn't saturated -- in fact, I don't know of any Linux
products that really fit this description. This company is possibly willing
to finance some development (eg customisation of existing software,
completing development of unfinished open source software, or writing new
stuff from scratch) and would hope to then sell that expertise (and product)
to other similar businesses.

Of course, this type of thing is quite far from the company's (and my) area
of expertise, and doesn't form part of their core business, but that's what
they are intersted in looking into...

So, does anyone know of any Linux-based, remotely accessible (web or
otherwise) systems that come remotely close to fitting this really vague,
long winded description?
