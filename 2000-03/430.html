&gt;&gt; Well, you know, the government has never claimed to be the smartest people

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Kinda like the SA gov't people who spend all their time trying to attract
&gt;&gt; big name organizations to SA and ignore the immense local talent we have
&gt;&gt; here :-)
&gt;
&gt;I hear that SA gov't didn't even make a representation to
&gt;Red Hat to ask them to locate their Australian operations
&gt;here.

Well, that was driven by people considerations. Mark Whyte, Ex Compaq,
lives near Brisbane :-)

&gt;Bizarre, especially when you look at the distribution of
&gt;Linux programmers.  Canberra and Adelaide really stand
&gt;out as the places to be if you want to source good development
&gt;people.

Rule 1. Don't expect governments or polititions to do the logical or
intelligent thing. If it ain't gonna win votes, it is ain't worth worrying
about.

&gt;SA is also a good site for a service centre: both labour and
&gt;real estate prices are low.
&gt;
&gt;Our location outside the east coast isn't the hassle you
&gt;might think: it is currently very cheap to fly at corporate
&gt;prices and both airlines provide excellent meeting facilties
&gt;at their terminals.  The decreasing number of direct flights
&gt;is an issue.
&gt;
&gt;Certainly being outside of the east coast wages explosion is
&gt;a win.  As is the fact that most people live in Adelaide for
&gt;the lifestyle.  This makes them very unlikely to leave your
&gt;company if you treat and manage them well.
&gt;
&gt;The downsides are:
&gt;
&gt; - some negative lifestyle issues: mainly shopping hours
&gt;
&gt; - a small supply of good executive, management and
&gt;   marketing people.  What's worse, there seems to be a
&gt;   lack of willingness to measure the performance of this
&gt;   class of worker, reward the good ones and fire the bad
&gt;   ones.  So the probabilty of you getting a shocking project
&gt;   manager seems to be much higher here in SA than elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt; - an upcoming lack of good cheap optical communications.
