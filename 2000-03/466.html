Hi,

&gt; At uni, one of my subject's pracs are done with the help of an X
&gt; application. I'd like to be able to do the work for these assignments from
&gt; home, however, I'm not sure how I'd get the app to come up on my computer. I
&gt; know over my LAN I can get X apps on a remote server by doing a 'export
&gt; DISPLAY=a.b.c.d', but the computer I use is behind a masquerading box. The
&gt; computer with the modem (and has a real IP address) has no monitor and I
&gt; don't think it's got enough HDD space left to install everything to get X
&gt; working. :(
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible for me to somehow get this to work?

I don't know about through IP masquerading, there must be some wag of
setenv-ing the display, but not sure, probably the same way you'd tlnet
back to your box.

&gt; Also, the Uni machines use Solaris, I think. If I can get the uni machines
&gt; to communicate with mine, will it work?

This is the beauty of the X-Windows system. All the applications are run
remotly, and only the display data is transfered to your local system. No
CPU load, but a fair ammount of network traffic. Your local machine need
only be capable of X-display. This can either be with Xfree86 (or
similar) under linux, or an emulator from windoze.

Be aware that this can be very slow over a modem, when I did this with
Netscape, it took 4 mins to start, and core dumped after 5. When I last
observed this, Martin Sandiford &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ms@mcdev.com.au">ms@mcdev.com.au</A>&gt; observed there is a
piece of software called lbxproxy which can help here, but I believe there
are specific X-Server requirements.

cya
