&gt; &gt; Companies like Cisco Systems and 3Com have been 'doing routers' for
&gt; &gt; years. With ISDN being so complex and buggy, it's a good idea to leave
&gt; &gt; the development to them and benefit from this by using a router.
&gt; &gt; Cisco's ISO version 12.0 still had major ISDN bugs right up to release
&gt; &gt; 6.

Cisco's ISDN code is so bad that they are currently re-writing
it from scratch.  It's a good example of requirements creep
making for bad code.  I've used the new code in engineering
releases of IOS and it feels a lot more stable.

ISDN itself is a pretty straightforward protocol.  It has many
fewer implmentation traps than TCP/IP and the lower speed allows
for a less tuned implementation.

I'd buy the Cisco router rather than use Linux though.  Mainly
on cost and physical reliability grounds.  One of their 2500
series has a ISDN and two ethernet interfaces.  You can also
get a 2600 with ISDN and fast ethernet.  Choose the 2600 if
you need to have multiple subnets at your site, use the 2500
otherwise.

You could also use a ISDN terminal adapter.  These have an
ISDN connection and a synchronous serial connection.  Even
basic Cisco 2500s come with synchronous interfaces, so if
you can find a cheap TA this can save you cash.  Note that
the popular JTEC 1200 TAs need a Y2K software upgrade, this
costs &gt;$600.

The two ethernet interfaces allow you to have one subnet for
your public services (such as mail and web) and another subnet
for your internal computers.  I would recommend this architecture
whatever platform you use as a router.
