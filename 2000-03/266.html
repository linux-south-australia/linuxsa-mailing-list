&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; would anyone like to share their opinions on RedHat 6.0 vs RedHat 6.1.  I
&gt; have heard that 6.1 is slightly buggy and that 6.0 is the one to stick
&gt; with.  Has anyone out there had any experiences they can pass on.

I prefer 6.0. The GUI install in 6.1 is OK, but fails to select some key
packages by default (things like glibc for example). Which is OK, I
suppose as RPM will take care of that. It still comes with enlightenment
0.15 instead of 0.16, which was an interesting move. I was sure 0.16 was
out for a while before RH 6.1. I haven't seen too many differences
(other than a working pgaccess in 6.1) and It's got a few cool features
(like the interactive startup). Try both. ;-). I'd burn you a CD, but NT
was kind enough to require me to re-install It (and the 4 other 
installs on that machine), Solaris 7, FreeBSD, DOS and Linux. So my
burner is not usable until I get Linux back on (it'll be 6.1 ;-))

Hope this helps.

Matt.
