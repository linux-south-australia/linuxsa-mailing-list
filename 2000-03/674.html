Hi,

First off, do people know who provide cable internet access, and wether it's
possible use these connections from a linux box?

Optus's cable service's web page says it's only available in the eastern
states, but doesn't say when/if it'll ever be available in SA (or at least I
couldn't find it). Telstra's web site had me believe that's it's available
in all states (there wasn't any mention of which states it was available),
but when I called for more info, they told me it's not available here.

Are there any other cable providers? any in SA?

Also, if any cable service does come to SA, will we be able to use it from
our Linux boxes? I don't see why not, but (as usual), the only 'supported'
platforms are Windows 9x/NT and the Mac. like I said, I don't see why it
wouldn't work, since it uses an ethernet interface (I don't know the correct
term), but from what I read, there's some software that you need to install,
and perhaps they somehow check if you're running it?

Thanks for the info, and sorry that it's off topic. Is there perhaps a
better e-mail list to post this to? This is the only mailing list I'm
subscribed to (and that I know of that's Australian) :)

Andy
