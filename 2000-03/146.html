Dieter,

&gt; Given that Glen has pointed out the unportability of David's C code

The program wasn't unportable, it was (very obviously) incomplete.  A
complete program would have included header files, and would have checked
errors, and would have ensured that it ready exactly bytes 51 and 52.
These were uninteresting issues that would have obscured my point, which
was that C is often overlooked for such tasks.  This is a pity because
"standard shell tools" aren't all that standard.  As an example of how
non-portable the shell tools can be, the "-t" flag for od that was used is
peculiar to the GNU od tool.  It would not work with any of the BSD unixes,
nor with any of the Unix(tm) branded unixes, such as Solaris, HPUX, AIX,
Unixware, SVR4 and so on.

The original suggestion was good, and I think Richard was looking for a
shell scriptable solution, but it took my fancy to say, "consider the C
language."
