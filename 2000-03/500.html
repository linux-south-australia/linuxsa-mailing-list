Hi all,
I've been lurking on the list and reading for some time and decided to have
a go at installing Linux last week.
The record of events has shattered me and I now definitely need some help.
Needless to say I did NOT backup my data and I do not need 1.5 million
emails saying I should have don that before I started - Thanks, but no
thanks...
I won't give you a blow by blow account, but this will probably be quite
long.

I have 3 partitions on my 13 gig hdd and I have shuffled data around to free
up one of these partitions and after discovering that LINUX (Red Hat) did
not like being put in the last 4.5 gig partition (disk druid could not
recognise anything above about 8 gig), I moved my data again so that the
middle 4.5 gig partition was available for it.
First I tried to install a version of Red Hat 6.0 (obtained from a PC
magazine CD) - every time I tried the install using 2gig as root, 2gig as
/usr and 129meg for swap (just cos I had the space), no matter what packages
I selected, I'd always be warned that there was insufficient space to
install them. Disk druid always showed bags of space.
Anyway, by cautiously selecting continue when warned there was enough space
(i.e. half closed my eyes and selected continue) the install would proceed
and files would be copied onto the partitions, but when the mouse detection
phase came, it couldn't find my mouse!!!
I would abort the install and try again, but still no go even if I tried to
skip that step, every other step except aborting the install resulted in no
progress.
Having wasted about half a day with Red Hat 5.2 and 6.0, I decided to blow
those partitions away and give it up. I blew away the Linux partitions using
the Disk Druid application.
When I rebooted to Winslow98 everything looked fine, I could see my C: and
D: drives - the Linux partition was not there as is normal - and access
files from them without any problems.
I recreated another 4.5gig logical drive in the space I had created when I
blew away the LINUX install and was able to work with it in Winslows98
I was just swearing my head off and abandoning my attempts to install LINUX
then as I was getting up I spotted the CD for Caldera Open Linux and instead
of walking away, I decided to have 'one more go'.
BIG ERROR...
The installation went great - lovely monkey see monkey do pictures and
everything appeared OK.
I managed to get into the X-Windows environment and everything appeared good
there too.
I logged off and shut down using the graphical interface (KDE) and waited
until I was told everything had been shut down, then I rebooted the PC.
I was taken straight into Winslow98 and discovered that I'd lost my data
drive. (Which is the last logical partition in the extended partition).
In Winslows Explorer, both logical drives appear as D: and E:, but I cannot
read anything from them, I get an error saying drive not accessible...
Nothing I do will recover it.
I've tried Partition Magic - no use, the partition I want comes up as
unknown and I can't do diddly with it.
I've tried Ranish Partition Manager - no use, both logical partitions give a
'boot record has invalid data' error (I think that's the message)
If you've made it this far then maybe you might be able to suggest a fix for
me...
Otherwise anyone know where I can get hold of 6 feet of rope and a nice tree
branch or beam???
