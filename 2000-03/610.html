&gt; I've just been forwarded information on the (infamous) Unisys patent on LZW
&gt; (Lempel Ziv Welch) technology.  It seems to cover both compression and
&gt; decompression, and is used in not only GIF, but also PDF, Postscript-2, TIFF-LZW
&gt; 
&gt; They also explicitly state that "so-called freeware" is not exempt.  This patent
&gt; therefore affects open-source imaging (libungif, ee, gimp etc) and even PDF
&gt; viewers (xpdf).
&gt; 
&gt; This is not a good thing.  Does this mean we should boycott PDFs _as_well_as_
&gt; GIFs?

You can have non-LZW compressed TIFF, PostScript and PDF files.

You cannot have a non-compressed GIF file.

None of Unisys' claims are relevant to Australia.  Our patent laws are
different (in summary, you can only patent programs that control a physical
progress).  The LZW alogrithm is not, and cannot be, patented in Australia.
My discussions with the federal A-Gs suggest that unlise some other
intellectual "property", there is no international move to alter patent
laws or to recognise overseas patents.

It is straightforward to re-insert the LZW code into xpdf, GhostScript
and libtiff, as the programmers deliberately left the structure in place
to do this in place.

Perhaps one of the things we could do as LinuxSA is to maintain
a set of current deb/RPMs of these programs with the LZW code.

Regards,
Glen
