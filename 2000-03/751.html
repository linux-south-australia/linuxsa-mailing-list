Hi people, thnaks for the replies about vmware.. heres another simple question
I am wanting to mount my ntfs volume and have added what I believe to be the
correct fstab entry
guess from memory.....
/dev/hda3   /mnt/winnt  ntfs,  default, 0 0

now this seemed to work ok when done while in X and I mounted and accessed the
volume ok while logged in as root.  While logged in as a user every folder in
winnt was locked and I couldnt change this from the root account.

Now after shutting down and rebooting, I get an error on startup saying
unsupported filesystem type ntfs and when I go into linuxconf from the console
and look at it it doesnt seem to like the ntfs file system type.  What do I use
instead?  Does it make sense that ntfs mounts work under X and not the console?

any help would be greatly appreciated

Matt
