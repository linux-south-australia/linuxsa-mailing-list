&gt; Just out of curiosity,
&gt; 
&gt; Isn't the SA Government's Pathways SA program supposed to do all of this
&gt; sort of thing for schools statewide?

My guess is that they will only look after government schools. I think
the catholic schools are looking at something similar, but that's
another matter.

&gt; 
&gt; If not for your school, perhaps you should look into the way they have
&gt; everything set up. Basically a Cisco 2600 series router with the two
&gt; ethernet interfaces. One for the curriculum network and one for the
&gt; administration network.

We currently have a 2503. It has an ethernet and an ISDN interface. We
are doubling our ISDN link and may need to get a new router. I am
looking into how cost effective a Linux based router is. I have heard
about this physical seperation of networks, but I'm still unsure as to
how the whole thing works. The way it was explained to me, it could be
one of a couple of things. Can anyone confim?

&gt; 
&gt; At my school I just added a Linux box with Squid to cache everything as we
&gt; get charged for downloads.

We have been running a squid based proxy for years. We also do our own
DNS, web serving and mail.

&gt; 
&gt; The Cisco works very well so far (mind you, we had to replace the 1st one
&gt; 'cause it got fried by a surge or something) and I have no complaints with
&gt; its ISDN stuff. Mind you, we have only two small blocks of IP addresses
&gt; and no BGP, multihoming etc.

We have two subnets a private and a public. We have only ever had one or
two minor problems.
