&gt; Can anyone point me in the right direction for this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Netscape starts ok but as soon as a menu is wanted or a button clicked
&gt; it locks up and refuses to respond the anything. Rebooting Windowmaker
&gt; is the only way I can regain the system. I guess it is looking for a PPP
&gt; connection of trying to resolve ip addresses because after a successful
&gt; connection to my ISP it seems to come good.
&gt; 
&gt; However there are times when I wish to look at mail and news without
&gt; logging on to the internet. My configuration has worked ok in the past
&gt; but is now becoming unusable.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone had similar problems?

It appears to be Netscapes DNS resolver (why they couldn't use the
[working] Unix one, we'll never know). You can try deleting your
~/.netscape directory and see if it works. I actually had to uninstall
Netscape and re-install as well as deleting the above-mentioned
directory. Maybe someone can offer a better solution? Upgrading to 4.6
didn't help.
