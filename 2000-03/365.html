Hey All,

I have a PC COM 8 port serial card, made by Decision Computers, that I need
to get working under linux.

Looking in the Serial-HOWTO, it has the card listing in the 'intellegent
card' section, and had an ftp site for the drivers, which I downloaded.
Unfortunatly, it seems that the driver on the website was written for a
2.0.28 (or close) kernel version, but the Mandrake box I'm trying to get it
to work in is using a 2.2.14 kernel, and it rejected 7 out of 14 lines or
something.

I know enough about programming to be able to get it to work when nothing
goes wrong, but I really am a beginner programmer. Can anyone help me out,
by either describing how to patch the kernel, knowing where a later driver
version is, or modifying the patch for me?

I tried to send an email to both people listed in the README file, but both
of them bounced back, user unknown.

The ftp site listed in the Serial-HOWTO is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.signum.se/pub/pccom8/">ftp://ftp.signum.se/pub/pccom8/</A>

Thanks In Advance

Darryl
