I know, I know, you guys are sick of hearing about it by now...

In case this is of use to anyone else, I have made a significant
breakthrough in the last laptop issue. Thanks to Matt G I discovered
that my problem was not to do with my winmodem driver causing conflict
with anything. This freed my mind to look elsewhere for the problem.

RTFM

The PCMCIA HOWTO is a great document. In it is a series of problem
descriptions, explanations and fixes. What seems to be happening is an
interrupt scan failure. Symptoms include locking up the whole system
(yup, that could be it). Possible fixes include restricting the probe to
a list of should-be-ok IRQs to scan, or disabling the interrupt probe
entirely. Hmm the second one sounds brutal, I'll try that! 

I have added the line 
PCIC_OPTS="do_scan=0"
to /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia
This achieves disabling the interrupt scan that was causing me sadness.

So now all the PCMCIA modules are loading ok and all the
/var/log/messages look like the PCMCIA hardware is detected and enabled.
This is good. The modem and everything else seems to work too, this is
also good.

Now I need to try out some PCMCIA stuff to test that it actually does
more than write messages to the logs. I don't have a network to play
with, so that's out, yet I have a Xircom Realport Cardbus Ethernet
10/100 card to play with. Hmm. Who do I know with an ethernet network I
can plug into...

Time for sleep, bye for now.

Bruce
