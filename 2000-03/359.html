Hi all,

Just back from a 9-week contract in Europe,
now I'm fired up to put together a business
based on development of network modules using
linux on PCs with ATM cards.

So now I need to find a suitable el cheapo
office/workshop in Adelaide to set this up.
It would need space for at least 3 work stations
for testing some high speed gear using linux-atm software
for the core "real-time" stuff.
(Of course, the ATM cards will do the real real-time,
and kernel modules will try to keep up with them,
and user processes will try to keep up with the
kernel modules, as is usual in these matters.)

There must be some people out there who know where
I might find real cheap office space, preferably near the
city, but with good parking (difficult, I know).
Please let me know if you know of any "opportunities"
in this regards.

By the way, I can now say how linux onthe laptop
went in the "real world" where people have real
money to spend. I can say that linux in such
an environment is _survivable_, but not much
more. I had to really try hard to stand my ground.

I've been using plain TeX for the last 15 years for
all of my documentation, unless compelled otherwise.
And I still consider it to be state-of-the-art.

They liked the resulting improvement in document style
that can be achieved with TeX, and I was able to
work much, much better with TeX (especially since
I had to do lots of math formulas, and tables, and
graphics using gnuplot and idraw).
But... there was great woe and travail that the
document formats could not be edited on their
machines.

So in summary, I found that I did not lose my
contract for not using the other operating system,
but it could have happened. 
Standing up for linux use in such
an environment still requires much courage.
Hopefully I've made it easier for the next person.

By the way, I had to abandon StarOffice for all except
plain text. Half the PostScript diagrams couldn't
be imported correctly. (I must have turned off some
option which I couldn't find again.) And maths in
SO is too painful.
And SO can't even read Excel properly. It gets all
the text the wrong size and makes bits of
graphics cover each other up, so that it is almost
unreadable.

Basically, in the final analysis, I think that either
SO needs a vast improvement in compatibility, or else
linux users need to go to TeX (if they are willing
to suffer the very long learning curve), or run
dual-boot.

That's my opinion anyway.

Back to my office space....
Any hints on where to look?

Cheerio, and thanks for all the help trying to
get SO/PDF/PS/EPS/etc/etc going in the last
few weeks.

Alan Kennington.
