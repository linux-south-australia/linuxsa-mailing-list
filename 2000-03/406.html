A colleague at work is in the market for a new house, and has started
getting spam from real estate agents. The spam was particularly worrying
because the spammers knew which Web sites he had been visiting. He wanted to
know how the spammers were able to match his visits to their Web sites with
his email address? That was something I thought was impossible, and he was
under the impression he was surfing anonymously.

After a bit of digging I discovered that he had signed up with a company
called www.property.com.au. They had offered to send him a regular email
newsletter listing new properties for sale, which matched his search
criteria. Sounded like a good idea, a nice friendly HTML newsletter arrives
in his inbox on a regular basis, with plenty of hyperlinks to real estate
Web sites.

But there’s a nasty little trap hidden inside those nice friendly messages,
the messages are more personal than my colleague realised. Hidden in the
HTML code is a user ID, a unique identifier that identifies him, and it’s
passed as a database parameter in every URL that my colleague clicks. Every
time he visits a Web site listed in the newsletter the spammers are able to
match all the information that he gave to www.property.com.au when he signed
up, with sites he visits, and the pages he views.

I’m haven’t thought through all the implications of this particular scam,
but one thing is certain, I will always be much more careful about how I
sign up for newsletters, and whether I will click on any hyperlinks sent to
me by email. The trap for the average user is that they have no idea what
information is being passed to databases in a URL’s.

I wonder how widespread this practice is?

Steve
