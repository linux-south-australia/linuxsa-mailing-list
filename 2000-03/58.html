&gt; The intermediate object files were not receiving the ident string

1)  strings -a (whatever the all option is under OSF), or just strings?
2)  grep and vi, unless it's the GNU ones, doesn't handle binary data
    all that well on standard (read: commercial) Unix boxen.  Use
    something like beav to examine the files with.

&gt; Hence, my belief that it is gcc that is no placing them in there. That
&gt; still leaves the preprocessor as well, right?

Maybe.  #ident shouldn't be touched by the preprocessor (it's like
#pragma in this regard), but that doesn't mean that the preprocessor
isn't (illegally) removing the string.

&gt; The DEC cc supports this feature, but I wonder why gcc doesn't seem to
&gt; work with it on this platform.

Might pay to grab the source and recompile; you're trusting someone
else's binaries here, and that may have been a configurable option
when building the compiler.

&gt; Bad COFF support perhaps? Seems unlikely..

I wouldn't discount it;  there's code that I use here that the optimiser
routinely breaks under later versions of gcc.  All things are possible
in an infinite universe.

&gt; 64 bit isnt that erotic...is it?
&gt; Remember, it's not how many you've got, it's how well you use them.
