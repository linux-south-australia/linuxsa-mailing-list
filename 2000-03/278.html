  &gt;&gt; How about including a copy of the DeCSS source code as an
  &gt;&gt; attachment to the letter? :-)

  Glen&gt; It's a tempting idea, but what point would we be making?

Probably not the one we want.. maybe later then.

There was a competition (probably over by now) for getting the source
code distributed as much as possible.. this was when Americans had
their first injuction against websites containing or linking to the
code.  (I'm pretty sure that the case was thrown out but I'm on the
details - apparently the source code was also tabled in court, which
didn't help the case :-)

Some of the ideas suggested were:
- Putting it into DATA records in DNS authority files
- Mailing to archived mailing lists
- Sending it to the Australian A-G to keep in his files.
     (I added this one)

To enter you had to have actually done it.  Anyone know the link?
