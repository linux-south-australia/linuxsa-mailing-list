&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible to require Authentication to access that profile. We are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about mixed Windows/Linux machines all with Netscape 4.x. We
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want users being able to access each other's profiles.....
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; look into roaming profiles.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course. Hence the whole LDAP directory thing. Does the Netscape
&gt; &gt; documentation for the roaming profiles have something about getting the
&gt; &gt; authentication happening? I am assuming that this documentation is on
&gt; &gt; Netscape's site....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Matt
&gt; 
&gt; One would assume that if there has been auth restrictions set up on the
&gt; LDAP server, then netscape will prompt for them.

Yes, well. One would also assume that Corporations wouldn't release a
product which wasn't fit for human consumption, but I still find myself
supporting Windows clients.....

&gt; 
&gt; Just for interest, because I was looking at it over the weekend, it
&gt; appears that netscape roaming does not work with openldap, as it uses
&gt; some non-standard features (that strangely enough the netscape ldap
&gt; server supports).

I was under the impression that it would work (I'm pretty sure that I
saw mention of it somewhere....). What was the problem specifically?

&gt; You might wan't to look at the apache mod_roaming modules...
