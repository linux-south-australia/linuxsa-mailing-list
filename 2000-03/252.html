Sorry for the long email, but I am hoping members may be able to provide
information about OpenLDAP's current capabilities, as well as other
components available to accomplish the following...

I installed OpenLDAP this weekend, and have been able to access the
directory as an address book through Netscape 4.7 (thanks to the
LDAP-HOWTO).

I was quite spoiled by Novell's NDS, and since it is based on the LDAP
concept, I felt quite at home with it, right down to addressing resources
(ie: "cn=sulisa,ou=consult,ou=ottawa,o=rthi")

I am now looking to integrate OpenLDAP into the Linux network much like NDS
has done for the IntraNetware networks. (This is on the "Dev" side, not
"Prod", so mistakes don't matter). I am having trouble finding references to
assist in changing the local login to a network/LDAP login. Ideally, I would
be able to:
	- Power up a Linux workstation,
	- Log in to it using an LDAP user and a password, instead of a local
user account,
	- LDAP would locate the User and read his/her permissions for
mounts, cshrc or Profile, etc
	- LDAP would also control access to the local PC and determine
whether to launch X
	- LDAP would provide a roaming X Profile.

Basically the local users and groups, though possibly still available, would
be set aside in favour of logging in as a "network user", and inheriting the
rights, permissions, profiles, etc no matter where they are.

A couple loftier ideas include:
	- Be able to map a printer using the LDAP naming convention
	- Be able to assign mounts for the user as follows:
		- Their user dir would be on their home server. Whereever
they are, it would be a fixed mapping (obviously)
		- Their Application mount (like a Winapps share) would
seacrh for the closest of the identical servers.

An example of these last two concepts:
	Company XYZ has three locations: Ottawa, Berlin, and Sydney. Each
location has departments, printers, servers, and workstations. The servers
(or mounts) are laid out so that in each location there is a Home for users,
Group for their department, and a corporate common which contains apps, and
other world-wide stuff. User DoeJ in Berlin has mappings to:
	- cn=home,ou=berlin,o=xyz (set by user profile)
	- cn=group,ou=berlin,o=xyz (set by user profile)
	- cn=corpstuff,ou=berlin,o=xyz (set by PC profile)
	- (default printer) cn=HP4Si,ou=berlin,o=xyz (set by PC profile)
If user DoeJ travelled to the Sydney office for a month, he/she would
receive mappings:
	- cn=home,ou=berlin,o=xyz (set by user profile)
	- cn=consult,ou=berlin,o=xyz (set by user profile)
	- cn=corpstuff,ou=sydney,o=xyz (set by PC profile)
	- (default printer) cn=HP8000N,ou=sydney,o=xyz (set by PC profile)
	- and perhaps, if working on a project there,
cn=consult,ou=sydney,o=xyz (manually provided by admin)

&gt; &gt; For LDAP, OpenLDAP looks good on paper (I haven't tried it yet). If
&gt; Sendmail
&gt; &gt; supports LDAP, that might be a good choice, otherwise, I'd look at HP
&gt; &gt; OPENMail. It looks and feels like a replacement for Exchange Server,
&gt; &gt; including web-based client, SMTP, and IMAP (but I don't recall if it
&gt; &gt; supports LDAP)
&gt; 
&gt; OpenLDAP is quite easy to setup (I can do it ;-)). It's also quite small
&gt; and doesn't seem to eat resources much. The thing about OpenLDAP is all
&gt; of the extras that have been written for it. Like the Authentication
&gt; modules for Apache, PAM and squid. Samba can make use of LDAP as another
&gt; database to store accounts in, it can be set up to be an E-Mail address
&gt; book for Various new mail clients. You can even have a different
&gt; database backend (or write your own). The ldbm database is fine for most
&gt; things, but you may find that using a different database is better for
&gt; different things. I like the flexibility.
