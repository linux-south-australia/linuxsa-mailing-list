Darryl,  (just my experiences)

There is EQL, MultilinkPPP and inverse multiplexing.  I haven't been
able to find out anything useful on the web regarding the last
two.. MultilinkPPP just brings up Microsoft references.  Inverse
multiplexing look like the official title for this sort of thing, but
again, I have been able to find any 'definitive works' on this topic...
yet.

EQL, on the other hand, I currently have working between a Linux
Router Project (LRP) machine (2.0.26 kernel) and a Portmaster terminal
server.  If you're setting up two server like machines (rather than
LRP boxes, which would also work well) I would choose Debian over
RedHat, as I thing the ppp scripts are set out better. (LRP is based
on Debian.)  If are interested in using two LRP boxes at each end,
I can help you further.. it's quite easy.

There is an EQL module, which allows a 'eql' network interface to be
brought up. PPP interfaces can then be 'enslaved' to this device,
using a program called 'eql_enslave'.  (The ppp devices can share the
same IP address as the eql interface.)  There was also met to be and
'eql_emancipate', but I don't think it got written.

I had difficulties getting 'eql_enslave' to compile with the 2.2.x
kernels, one I was able to find the source (another problem).

Things to read: 
NET3-4-HOWTO
lrp.c0wz.com         - useful (almost official) LRP site
www.linux-router.org - official LRP site

Also, just annouced today is a 'ipenslave' module for the newest
development kernel which allows you to do the same as above for any IP
interface.  Imagine having a bidirectional 400Mb/s pipe (using a 4x
100BaseTX PCI card) into your machine :-)
