Hi all,
    I am editor of a national newsletter for an association
that I am in, and so I think that I am qualified to answer a
few questions here. There is ALOT of work involved putting
together a newsletter. As editor, if people don't supply
enough articles (this happens after the enthusiasm wears off
the readers) then YOU are the bunny that has to write them
to fill copy. At present I provide a newsletter 4 times a
year of 12 A4 pages. About 4 pages are information that
changes very little, ie contact details for associated clubs
etc., I can usually drum up 1 or two articles for each
edition that takes up another 2-3 pages. This leaves 4-5
pages I write myself because nobody has responded to my
begging and pleading to provide an article. It is not that
there is no information that people want to read out there,
it is just that people cannot be bothered after a while to
do anything about writing about it.

    Secondly, it takes a month to collect together all the
information, including writing articles, and then proof
reading them, and then checking the articles for errors, and
then laying out the newsletter, editing articles to make
them fit, rewriting bad english and grammar, putting it all
together, and then proof reading again.

    I also electronically distribute the newsletter to
various secretaries to distribute to the membership so there
are no publishing costs. I had to actually have 25 copies
published to be sent to China to a sponsor a couple of years
ago, and it was cheaper to have them professionally printed
instead of photocopied on a colour printer. This brought a
12 page colour newsletter to about $8 per copy. If you
printed more then the per copy cost comes down, but the
overall cost doesn't.

    O.K., now that we have had a quick reality check, let me
say that even though it is hard work, I enjoy putting
together the newsletter every quarter. I think it is a good
idea to have such a thing, but please keep in mind that
someone has to be responsible for it and to keep it going.
If people out there want to do these things, by all means go
ahead, but just remember that good ideas require effort and
planning to come to fruition, and anyone who takes on the
project had better have alot of time and patience, otherwise
the project will come to an abrupt halt.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;Without putting a damper on the whole subject does anyone
know how much
&gt;work creating a paper newsletter actually is?
