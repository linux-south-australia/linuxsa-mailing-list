Glen,

Movie publishers have different release schedules for their titles in
different regions, so for example Americans can rent a title on video
before some other regions have even seen them at the cinema.  Without
region coding publishers would obviously lose significant income, and so
I do agree this statement:

&gt; We believe that preventing the loss of income derived from DVD region
&gt; coding is the real motivation of the DVD CCA in its opposition to
&gt; DeCSS.


Never the less I thought that Australians could publish their own movies on
DVD with whatever region code they want, so I find it hard to understand
this:

&gt; We believe that this income is a transfer of funds from Australian
&gt; consumers to US DVD distributors.  We believe that region coding
&gt; disadvantages Australian-owned movie distributors.  We note that
&gt; only US movie distributors are members of the DVD CCA.###

It is the Copyright holder, who controls publication, who determines where
funds are transferred.  Presumably Australian owned movies would cause
transfer of funds from US to Australia.  This sounds fair.

I think your whole argument about importation of CDs (and presumably DVDs)
is dangerous territory that you should keep clear of.  I don't think you
even need to go there.  I think your arguments are just as convincing -- in
fact more so -- without it.


Regards,

David
