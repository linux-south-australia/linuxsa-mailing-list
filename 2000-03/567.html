<H1>Problem with Netscape Communicator</H1>

Hello,
Problem:
I have noticed since using RH6.1 that Netscape Communicator has the
irritating nature of crashing out completely when trying to include an
email URL into a composition from the Address Book. :(

It doesn't seem to matter what I do, when you select a desired URL, by
clicking any of the To, Cc or Bcc buttons, All of Netscape disappears
into oblivion. Typing in the URL does not seem to be a problem - just
all functionality of the Address Book.

At the LinuxSA March meet and while enjoying our pizza, I posed my
problem. Apparently, there is a bug in the Address Book, and Tim advised
my just to upgrade.

Steps I took:
1)I used Netscape and found the Netcraft ftp site, and went to the
appropriate subdirectory and downloaded both
netscape-common-4.72-6.i386.rpm and
netscape-communicator-4.72-6.i386.rpm and saved to my /tmp directory.
2)As Root, I used GnoRPM, found and selected the files to add, then
pressed upgrade.
3)I checked the appropriate directory and the Netscape files had indeed
installed as the previous numbers were 4.7-1.1
4)I went back in as user, fired up Netscape, once again receiving the
pre-dinner licence matinee, clicked ok, but the problem still with the
Address Book still persists.

What have I done wrong????
Is there any steps that I have missed??

This may seem probably too simple for some of you, but it is irritating
and confusing me on how to rectify the situation.

Please advise,
Mark:(
