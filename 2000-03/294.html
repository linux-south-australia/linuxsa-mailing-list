 &gt; Movie publishers have different release schedules for their titles in

I think the point is that this practice sucks the big one;  there is
no justification for releasing a movie at different times in different
locations.

But if, however, they choose to continue that practice, they're also
going to have to put up with the fact that it's going to be possible for
someone in Australia to purchase a DVD of a movie which hasn't been 
released here yet.  Whether they lose money on that or not (when the
DVD is more expensive than a movie ticket, and they're making a sale
anyway regardless of where in the world the product ends up) is really
a problem they have to face up to in a global market.  One thing is 
clear, though -- The customers *aren't* going to wear that problem;  
Any technological means to subvert region codes *will* be used.

 &gt; Without region coding publishers would obviously lose significant
 &gt; income,

"Serves them bloody-well right."

 &gt; Never the less I thought that Australians could publish their own movies on
 &gt; DVD with whatever region code they want, so I find it hard to understand
 &gt; this:
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; We believe that this income is a transfer of funds from Australian
 &gt; &gt; consumers to US DVD distributors.  We believe that region coding
 &gt; &gt; disadvantages Australian-owned movie distributors.  We note that
 &gt; &gt; only US movie distributors are members of the DVD CCA.###

To publish on DVD you need to have one of the DVD unlock codes.  Previous
to the existence of DeCSS, the only way to obtain your unlock code was
to become a member of the DVD CCA.  Since the only members of the DVD
CCA are US film distributors, in practice that meant that Australian 
films would have to get through the US in order to come out on DVD.

Regionalization has almost nothing to do with this;  Access to the 
"trade secret" implemented in the list of unlock codes CSS is the 
bit that's anti-competitive, and forcing Australian filmmakers to go
through US distributors.

 &gt; It is the Copyright holder, who controls publication, who determines where
 &gt; funds are transferred.  Presumably Australian owned movies would cause
 &gt; transfer of funds from US to Australia.  This sounds fair.

It is the distributor who controls distribution, and who negotiates
with the Copyright Holder.  US Distributors have an unfair advantage
in those negotiations because they have access to the DVD format and
Australian distributors don't, so those negotiations are skewed in favour
of the US companies.

 &gt; I think your whole argument about importation of CDs (and presumably DVDs)
 &gt; is dangerous territory that you should keep clear of.  I don't think you
 &gt; even need to go there.  I think your arguments are just as convincing -- in
 &gt; fact more so -- without it.

&lt;shrug&gt;  I dunno -- With the Fringe and the Festival of the Arts on at the 
moment, I couldn't think of a more timely occasion to bring the issues
of Australian film creators to the fore.
