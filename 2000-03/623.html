Apologies, then. :)

* certificate requests" - paraphrased.

Yep. Security in Internet Explorer is shocking. Both in the way that it
handles the integrity of your own machine, and in the way that it negotiates
with other machines (like ftp). I agree with that, and I was waaaaaaay too
open with my comment "they make a nice browser". I should really edit that
and say "they don't miff me off with crashes every ten seconds, and they
make some websites look real purty" :) That strikes out Netscape in part
one, and lynx in part two. :)

If Netscape crashed less (much, much less), then I would throw IE away for
good. Heck, as soon as Netware 4 and 5 boxen can be administered from linux,
I'd dump my Windows PC entirely. Netscape makes a better browser in
principle, but the implementation is a shocker. No other Linux apps I've
seen can make my whole workstation freeze entirely and require a switch off
at the wall. Apart from Star Office, that is, but that was a few versions
ago. :)

So, to sum up: you're completely right; IE is crud in terms of security. But
I evaluate a browser on different criteria, where Netscape falls down in my
experience.
