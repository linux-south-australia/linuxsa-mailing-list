&gt; 
&gt; Oh come on.  It was a joke, ferchrissakes (and an old one at that).
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The reason for my angry response -  I HAVE AN AUTISTIC SON !!!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, yes, I understnd that you'd take some of the bits of the joke
&gt; a bit personally.  But perhaps we need to get something else straight:
&gt; If everyone who is about to say something in public needs to think
&gt; about whether there's someone else in earshot who might, for reasons
&gt; unknown to anyone else, get offended by what is about to be said, then
&gt; nobody will ever say anything at all about anything.

Exactly, it doesn't matter these days who is in earshot, we should all
be careful of what we are saying. I'm not saying that there can't be
jokes. I just believe that we should all start to accept responsibility
for what we say and when we say it. Personally I didn't find the joke
funny, and never heard of it before.

&gt; 800 opinions there's pretty much ALWAYS going to be at least one who
&gt; will take any comment on any issue personally; does that mean that
&gt; any comment on any issue should be kept silent 

No. It just means we have to be careful what we say. I see the List as a
means where people help others where there is a possible forum of 600
(or how many is on it). I just couldn't see the point of the attachment
of such nature being made public, they should have kept it off-list and
to themselves.

&gt; [ inviting public vilification on someone is something else which,
&gt;   perhaps, should give pause for thought.  Is that *really* the outcome
&gt;   you want from conversations on a civilized mailing list? 

If I was too harsh, then I will be the first to apologise, but, a
civilised list wouldn't have carried something that may be detrimental
to someone else.

Have you ever been shopping with an autistic child, tried to receive
love from an autistic child, get the attention of an autistic child.
These may be considered simple things in life. I haven't had that
luxury. When an autistic child plays up, it is like getting 800 replies
of what you sent me all at once. Just because the child is misbehaving,
they can't see what the problem is because the child looks normal
because autism is a hidden disorder. We make allowances for these
problems.

&gt;   ask you to think about how much you really want to be subscribed to
&gt;   the list, and whether your needs might be better served elsewhere ]

No thankyou, I'm staying right here where my needs are served. Just
because there was one issue that hit a raw nerve isn't a means to dispel
them from a public forum. It's the insesitive issues that have to be
addressed, not the people they are making fun at. I can have fun and a
good joke, but not at the expense of others, it's not needed. This is a
Linux list, keep it that way. End of discussion. End of the matter :)
