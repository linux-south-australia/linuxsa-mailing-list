I think this an extremely fine letter and makes clear concise points.

Congratulations

&gt; Attached is a rough first draft of a proposed letter from
&gt; LinuxSA to the federal Attorney-General.
&gt;
&gt;  1) Do we want to send a letter about DeCSS and the
&gt;     ability to play DVDs from Linux.
&gt;
&gt;  2) If so, is this approximately right.
&gt;
&gt; If the concensus is that we want to send a letter, I'll
&gt; tidy the draft, send it to a few journalists I know for
&gt; polishing, and bring it to the next meeting.  At the meeting
&gt; we would vote unanimously to send it and add our signatures
&gt; after those of the LinuxSA convenors.
&gt;
&gt; Once we've done one letter, it's easy enough to CC: the
&gt; state A-G, etc.
&gt;
&gt; To make my life easier, please address responses concerning
&gt; (1) to the list, major suggestions on (2) to the list, and
&gt; minor typos and proofreads directly to me.

&gt;  Earth is a single point of failure
&gt;
&gt;   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
&gt; Dear Sir,
&gt;
&gt; LinuxSA is concerned that the Attorney-General may only be hearing the
&gt; views of the MPAA about the computer software "DeCSS".
&gt;
&gt; Our concern is prompted by the Attorney-General's extraordinary
&gt; attendence at a rapidly-arranged meeting with representatives of the
&gt; United States' MPAA.  The Australian Linux community has not yet been
&gt; invited to meet with the Attorney-General.
&gt;
&gt; Linux is an operating system for computers.  The most famous operating
&gt; system is Microsoft's Windows: Linux currently competes with Windows
&gt; on high-end PCs from all the major PC manufacturers.  Linux is an
&gt; effort of an Internet-connected community: it has no one owner, it is
&gt; free, and all its details are published.  Australians have been
&gt; major contributors to the development of Linux.
&gt;
&gt; LinuxSA is a South Australian club of Linux users.  About two
&gt; hundred### people attend its monthly meetings.  Similar clubs exist in
&gt; every city and most large towns.
&gt;
&gt; DeCSS is software written by the international Linux community that
&gt; unscrambles the Content Scrambling System on Digital Video Disks,
&gt; allowing DVD movies to be played on computers that run the Linux
&gt; operating system.
&gt;
&gt; DE-CSS DISCOVERS A TRADE SECRET
&gt;
&gt; The Content Scrambling System is a trade secret of the DVD CCA.  It is
&gt; perfectly legal to fairly seek to uncover a trade secret: people are
&gt; allowed to cook as many chickens as they please in an attempt to
&gt; determine the nature of KFC's "11 secret herbs and spices".
&gt;
&gt; The Linux community undertook to reverse engineer the Content
&gt; Scrambling System so that computers running the Linux operating system
&gt; could play DVD movies.
&gt;
&gt; The Linux community chose not to pay a license fee to the DVD CCA to
&gt; gain access to the trade secret of the Content Scrambling System.  This
&gt; choice is well within their rights.
&gt;
&gt; They chose not to do so as secrecy is directly opposed to the Linux
&gt; ethos.  The Linux operating system is written by a large
&gt; Internet-connected community sharing their computer source code at no
&gt; charge.  A trade secret licensing scheme is simply unworkable in this
&gt; environment: each of the thousands of Linux contributors would need
&gt; to have access to the trade secret.
&gt;
&gt; DE-CSS IS NOT NEEDED FOR UNAUTHORISED COPYING OF DVDS
&gt;
&gt; We are concerned that the Attorney General may believe public
&gt; statements of the US DVD CCA that claim the Linux community developed
&gt; DeCSS to allow the unauthorised reproduction of DVDs.  This is not
&gt; true.  ###Attach public statement###
&gt;
&gt; Unauthorised copies of DVDs can be made without decoding the
&gt; content, just as you can photocopy a newspaper article written
&gt; in the Japanese language without decoding it.
&gt;
&gt; DE-CSS MAY REDUCE THE PROFITS OF U.S MOVIE DISTRIBUTORS
&gt;
&gt; DVDs are marked with a "region code".  DVD players are also marked
&gt; with a region code.  Most DVD players will only play a movie when the
&gt; region codes match.
&gt;
&gt; This coding is an attempt by motion picture manufacturers to prevent
&gt; the free international trade of DVDs.  This prevents the resale of
&gt; DVDs from a country where they are cheap to a country where they are
&gt; expensive.
&gt;
&gt; There are strong parallels to the marketing of CDs, where the
&gt; government decided to allow parallel importing to prevent Australian
&gt; consumers being ripped off when compared to US consumers.  ###Good
&gt; quote from ACCC###
&gt;
&gt; The region coding of DVDs is a technological attempt to prevent
&gt; Australian consumers from being able to import DVDs from countries
&gt; where DVDs are cheaper.
&gt;
&gt; Region coding also forces Australian movie makers to deal with major
&gt; US movie distributors in order to get the Australian movie released in
&gt; the US on DVD.  It is designed to prevent the Australian movie maker
&gt; from offering their movie on DVD globally through a web site that
&gt; avoids the movie distributors entirely, such as through www.amazon.com.
&gt;
&gt; DeCSS can read a DVD with any region coding.  This allows the
&gt; free international trade of DVDs.  This free trade has the
&gt; potential to reduce the profits of DVD movie distributors.
&gt;
&gt; We believe that preventing the loss of income derived from DVD region
&gt; coding is the real motivation of the DVD CCA in its opposition to
&gt; DeCSS.
&gt;
&gt; We believe that this income is a transfer of funds from Australian
&gt; consumers to US DVD distributors.  We believe that region coding
&gt; disadvantages Australian-owned movie distributors.  We note that
&gt; only US movie distributors are members of the DVD CCA.###
&gt;
&gt; AUSTRALIAN WEBSITE OWNERS ARE BEING THREATENED
&gt;
&gt; We are concerned that the US MPAA is harassing Australian website
&gt; owners to remove the DeCSS program.  Their letters claim that hosting
&gt; the DeCSS software is illegal -- essentially stating that the ruling
&gt; of a Californian judge applies to Australian web sites.  This claim of
&gt; jurisdiction is obvious nonsense.  The only intent of the letters can
&gt; be to make unsupportable threats to Australian website operators in
&gt; the hope that legally naive people will be scared into removing the
&gt; software.  Communications with the MPAA have revealed that these
&gt; letters were sent knowing that the websites involved are beyond US
&gt; jurisdiction.
&gt;
&gt; We are concerned that the US MPAA are responsible for the arrest and
&gt; prosecution of the Norwegian author of the DeCSS code.  We expect
&gt; that Amnesty International will list this person as a politcal
&gt; prisoner.
&gt;
&gt; We are concerned that the MPAA may be claiming the Norwegian
&gt; government's actions as a precedent and may be encouraging the
&gt; Australian government to take similar measures agianst the liberty of
&gt; Australians that host the DeCSS software on their websites.
&gt;
&gt; To allay these concerns, we ask the Attorney-General to make available
&gt; to the Australian public the minutes of his meeting with the
&gt; represenatives of the MPAA.
&gt;
&gt; LINUX GIVES AUSTRALIA A NEW INDUSTRY
&gt;
&gt; Australians have contributed to the development of Linux from its
&gt; beginning in 19xx.###  Some of these people are now employed by
&gt; international companies such as LinuxCare (in Canberra) or Red Hat
&gt; Software (in Brisbane).  Many more of these people act as private
&gt; consultants, often contracting with US firms.
&gt;
&gt; Australia's geographical position, a hemisphere away from the US,
&gt; gives Australia a competitive advantage.  It is an ideal location to
&gt; position one of three service centres that are required by companies
&gt; that seek to offer around-the-clock service.  Our lifestyle and low
&gt; cost of living are attractive when compared to Silicon Valley.
&gt;
&gt; We expect that Linux-related services will be a major earner of net
&gt; foreign income for Australia.  Australia is in a strong internationally
&gt; competitive position.
&gt;
&gt; This position could be eroded instantly by ill-considered changes to
&gt; copyright or patent legislation.  We already have some loss of
&gt; international competitiveness due to our high telecommunications
&gt; prices and onerous Internet censorship laws.
&gt;
&gt; To date, Australia's copyright and patent laws have allowed Linux to
&gt; florish.  It is legal to reverse engineer the function of a product.
&gt; Computer programming languages are free from copyright.  Most software
&gt; algorithms cannot be patented.  It is possible to export code
&gt; containing cyptographic functions.
&gt;
&gt; A change in these laws would could prevent Australians from
&gt; participating in the development of Linux and could deny Australia
&gt; companies the ability to offer Linux-based services to the world.
&gt;
&gt; In the absense of published minutes from the Attorney-General's
&gt; meeting with the MPAA, we believe that the MPAA may have been
&gt; suggesting that some or all of these laws be altered to disadvantage
&gt; Australian Linux services companies and advantage the US movie
&gt; distribution industry.
&gt;
&gt; We encourage the Attorney-General to consider the impact of legislative
&gt; changes on Australian Linux services companies and Australian Linux
&gt; users, especially changes to the Copyright Act, Patents ###.
&gt;
&gt; REQUEST FOR MEETING
&gt;
&gt; We also ask that the Attorney-General meet with members of the
&gt; Australian Linux community.  We assume that the Attorney-General's
&gt; meeting with representaives of the MPAA shows that he is deeply
&gt; interested in this issue.  We hope that he will not choose to be
&gt; briefed only by lobbyists for the US motion piucture industry.
