......................................................................

The IETF -- The Internet Engineering Task Force, who are the people who
design the internet protocols -- are meeting here in Adelaide this week.
This is a rare occurrence that presents an opportunity for a real treat for
us to enjoy.  Some of the IETF members (who are experts in their fields)
have graciously agreed to present a series of free lunchtime seminars.

The seminar today was very interesting.  Too bad if you missed it.

Wednesday's seminar, "Measuring Internet Performance," will be presented by
Matt Zekauskas, from Advanced Network & Services, in Horace Lamb lecture
theatre, between 12pm and 1pm.

......................................................................

The second seminar, on the topic of Telephony over IP, was presented by
Stephen Kingham from CSIRO (apparently, although I thought I saw Don
Robertson written on the blackboard so my humble apologies if I got it
wrong!)

The good news is it's all surprisingly easy!

Normally your telephone is connected to your company PBX, which places the
call using the public telephone network (PSTN).  With VoIP you PABX is
connected to a "Voice over IP" gateway, which looks almost like another
PABX or like a telephone line.  On the PABX side the gateway looks like
ISDN; on the internet side it uses H.323 (the standard for voice over IP.)
When you wish to make a call the PABX passes your call to the VoIP gateway
which connects to a gateway "at the other end", which makes a (presumably)
local call to complete the circuit ( or delivers it to a local extension.)
Calls can also be placed to "IP telephones", for example Microsoft
Netmeeting.

If the gateway cannot place the call the PABX falls back to the usual
(expensive) PSTN.

Software called "Gatekeeper" translates a telephone number into an IP
address.  This is analogous to the DNS which translates a domain name into
an IP address, but unlike the DNS, which must be manually configured, you
can connect to your local Gatekeeper and it knows that's where you are.  I
gathered that Gatekeeper is not quite "production ready", and that static
routes are also used.

Each voice call is sampled at 64Kbps and compressed using G.some number,
which standard describes the compression of speech.  This compresses speech
to a bit rate of 8Kbps.  Allowing for system overheads, each call actually
consumes 26Kbps!  I think the protocol sends 60 bytes of data per packet,
and when you add UDP headers, and IP frames, the overheads greatly exceed
the amount of data!  [It's ironic that the argument against IP on ATM is
the penalty of splitting IP datagrams into lots of little ATM cells.]  On
slow links (less than 2Mbps) further compression is used which brings the
bandwidth down to 13Kbps.  I remember the number 5Kbps being bandied
around, too, but I don't recall how.

VoIP requires data to be delivered quickly and reliably.  If the packets
are delivered in less than 200ms the quality is about the same as for the
normal telephone network.  Delays up to 600ms (I wish I wrote these numbers
down) are like talking over a satelite link; you need to talk, then pause
to let the other person talk.  When you add up how long it takes to convert
speech to data, and to so and so forth, until it gets to the other end, the
total time is about 90ms plus trip time, which just about makes VoIP to USA
workable.

If the packets cannot be delivered quickly, there's no point delivering
them at all.  VoIP uses the IP Type of Service field to identify the voice
data so that routers can give them high priority.  Only authorised hosts
are permitted to set the TOS and the gateways strip these bits from IP
headers from unauthorised hosts.

There are issues relating to network performance, and if the network is
too busy to handle the call it should be rejected (and the PABX should fall
back to the expensive PSTN line.)  This is apparently another "work in
progress" issue, the final solution to which is still being worked out.

AARNet is using this service now.  It supports voice and fax.  Fax works by
using DSP (digital signal processors) to decode the fax signal and turn it
back to data; the data is sent through the network and turned back into
"fax" at the other end.  Modem calls are not support (although there is no
reason why they couldn't be handled the same way fax is) and neither is
ISDN video.  [Pooh!]

One lovely benefit is end-to-end Q.sig, which the government has been
unsuccessfully trying to get carriers to support for years.  Suppose you
try to call somebody and they are on a call.  Q.sig allows you to dial a
code and hang up, and when their call completes your telephone rings.  When
you pick it up their telephone rings and you are thus connected to them.
This feature is available on PABXs, but it's not available over the PSTN.
VoIP gives you this ability end to end.

Billing is really easy.  A billing system was written in Perth, and I we
were told the URL, <A HREF="http://timtam.aarnet.edu.au.">http://timtam.aarnet.edu.au.</A>  The system currently
handles thousands of calls per day.  Long distance calls using VoIP cost
around 1/10th of a cent per minute; much cheaper than the PSTN.

This was a very interesting seminar and you should kick yourself--very
roughly--if you missed it!
