&gt; What do they mean by end user computing? I get a little bit concerned

I usually don't do people's homework, but....

Cast your mind back ten years.  The world has IBM mainframes, DEC VAX
minicomputers, and 8-bit Z80 machines running CP/M.  If you want something
done on a computer, say a stock report, you tell IS your requirements
and a few years later a printout containing their interpretation of your
stock report requirements starts arriving in your in-tray each month.
Of course, it's useless, partly because they don't know your business
and partly because writing specs is hard, so you put in a change request.
They'll get around to it in a few year's time.

You say "bugger that", go and buy a 16-bit IBM PC (it's taken IS that
long), and maintain your stock levels on Lotus 123.  Some IS person
mumbles about End User Computing.

Of course, you never back it up.  And if someone stole it, you'd be
stuffed and your customers would be furious that some unknown person
had a record of all those VD supplies you shipped to them.  That time
you got a virus from a game and it deleted most of the files from
the disk, that was scary.

Meanwhile, all the other warehouses have developed the same sort of
application, and although your stock looks good, the entire company
is overstocked to the hilt.  You'd like to combine the data from
all the warehouses and sort this out, but you use 123 and they use
a new product called Excel.

You'd like to move to Excel, but all those macros that do the magic
are so convoluted that you'd never be able to tell if they worked
after running throught the Excel macro conversion utility.  Your
IS mate says something about regression test sets.  You've also
no clue what some of the macros you wrote even do now.

When you finally finish importing all the data files, it doesn't look
right.  It turns out that you track stock levels in units, and
they track them in boxes.  There's no way to fix this retrospectively:
the data can't be analysed.  You tell a mate in IS about this, be
raves on about things called metadata and data dictionaries.

Last year you visited a competitor.  Their IS department works closely
with their organisation.  Each warehouse had an Internet connection
running a VPN connection back to IS.  A nice little Java applet
was used to enter stock moves, or you could use a battery operated
scanner.  The warehouse had a little analysis application they
had written, with chatted back to the database at IS using ODBC.

Someone from IS helped him write it, although they seemed concerned
about process more than the program.  Who cares about testing and
configuration control?  They're also fussy about storing everything
on the file server, file naming, and procedures manuals.  On
the other hand, they sent him to an Excel training course as a
result of their skills audit and made sure he got a heap of
recognition when IS put the macros on their tools web site
along with a small user guide they had written.

Regards,
Glen

PS: As you can gather, I suspect the questions are out of some dusty
    textbook.  I desperately hope that the instructor is going to
    use them in an innovative way.
