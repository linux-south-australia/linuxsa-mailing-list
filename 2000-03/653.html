It's nothing particularly new - Telstra was sending press releases saying
that they'd be doing ADSL in August as far back as last November, while
other parts of Telstra were walking into the DSL Forum meetings claiming
that it was technically impossible to open up the local loop.

It's been well-known that if Telstra was planning to roll-out in August,
the ACCC would go ballistic if they weren't offering other carriers a
bite of the pie as well.  This story just counts as confirmation that 
Telstra's press releases last year weren't very far off the mark.
(and the ACCC announcement was actually about half way through last
week, BTW)

Of course, what isn't being said is that there's very little benefit 
in offering other carriers access to the copper if you do it at the 
exact same time that you're opening up your ADSL retail service.  
Telstra has had at least five years to sort out all the technical 
difficulties, spec the right equipment, install it in exchanges, survey
lines to work out which service areas are going to be suitable for
ADSL, etc -- It's going to take *months* for competitive carriers to
do the same research before they can offer a quality alternative
service.

So, competitive carriers are stuck:  Do they jump like a bull at a gate
as soon as access is opened, gaining market share at the expense of 
reputation as all the customers they manage to get spread bad word-of-mouth
about their quality of service while they're learning the ropes, or do
you hold back, test, build up your skills and expertise, then finally
launch a service which is competitive on price, features and quality
after Telstra has had time to sew-up 80% of the market?

Sigh.  I didn't vote for 'em.
