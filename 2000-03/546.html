Thanks a lot...

Yeah, my export file i guess is right and its indeed DECism..
I feel its neighther NIS problem nor exports file problem. I hve been
mounting  
directories of my machine to other machines this way..(Whether they are
on NIS or not..).

I tried with Suse kit... it goes in...but so many other probs.. so came
back to redhat.

Here am giving my full exports file & also the man page of exports
file(compaq/DEC!!!)

# The exports file defines remote mount points for NFS mount requests.
#
# Syntax: pathname [-option ...] [name ...]
#
# A whitespace character in the left-most position of a line indicates
# a continuation line.
#
# pathname      Specifies the name of a local file system or directory
#               of a local filesystem.
#
# The following are valid exports options:
#
# -root=0
#         Maps all client superusers to uid 0; by default, superusers
are
#         mapped to user "nobody".  This option overrides -anon=uid for
#         client superusers.
# -root=hostname[:hostname]...
#         Maps client superusers on only the specified hosts to uid 0;
#         overrides the use of -anon=uid for client superusers.
# -ro
#         Exports pathname read-only; default is read-write.
# -rw=hostname[:hostname]...
#         Exports pathname read-write to the specified hosts and
#         read-only to other hosts.
# -public
#         Exported for WebNFS access.   Note that only one exported
#         filesystem can use this option.
# -index
#         Used with -public option. WebNFS optimization that enables the
#         server to look for an index.html file when given a directory
name.
# -anon=uid
#         Maps anonymous users to the specified uid.  Client superusers
#         and NFS requests without UNIX authentication are considered
#         anonymous; setting uid to -1 disables anonymous access.
# -access=name[:name]...
#         Specifies the hosts to grant mount access to.  Use of
#         whitespace separated name list following options is also
#         accepted.  Client can be a host name, IP address, or NIS
#         netgroup.  If a mount access list is not provided, the path
#         is exported to all hosts.

/*****************************/

The only catch is , for redhat, the target machine is intel.. All other
mountings are on alpha
only... Is it a sin????? But again suse succeeds.!!!

Now heres the man page attachemnet for exports.....

Thanks a lot again.

&gt; I'm not surprised, most people dislike HTML e-mail and won't
&gt; reply to it.  You can turn it off under Edit | Preferences |

&gt; "Prefers to recieve HTML e-mail".
&gt; 
&gt; The /etc/export syntax looks odd, but that might be a DECism [1].
&gt; 
&gt; Try the DEC equivalent to:
&gt; 
&gt;   /redhat/path  16.168.64.161(ro,insecure,all_squash)
&gt; 
&gt; The 'credentials reject' message might be from NIS or
&gt; might be because your machine doesn't have a reverse
&gt; IP address mapping.  Check the format to specify an
&gt; IP address in DEC's "man exports", maybe the server
&gt; thinks it's a domain name or a NIS group [2].
&gt; 
&gt; You may also need to find the DEC NFS option to allow public
&gt; access to the export.  I'm also not sure if the DEC portmapper
&gt; honours /etc/hosts.allow or an equivalent file.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I'd run up Apache and share the files that way.
&gt; I've found this to be the most reliable method of doing a
&gt; network install.

NAME

  exports - Defines remote mount points for NFS mount requests

SYNOPSIS

  /etc/exports

DESCRIPTION

  The exports file specifies remote mount points for the NFS mount protocol
  per the NFS server specification (see Network File System Protocol Specifi-
  cation, RFC1094).

  Each entry in the /etc/exports file consists of a filesystem or directory
  name followed by an optional list of options or an optional list of iden-
  tifiers or both. The identifiers define which remote hosts can mount that
  particular filesystem or directory.  The identifiers listed beside the name
  of each filesystem or directory can be either host names, IP addresses, or
  NIS netgroups names.  If no identifiers are listed, the entry is exported
  to all hosts.

  A backslash character (\) in the right-most position of a line indicates
  line continuation.  A number sign (#) either at the beginning of a line or
  at the end of a syntax line marks a comment that extends to the end of that
  line.  You cannot use a number sign at the end of a line containing a
  backslash character because the backslash nullifies the end of line charac-
  ter.

  Note that the mount command will touch the /etc/exports file when issued
  with the -t nfs option.  If you create a new /etc/exports file, you should
  ensure that its ownership is equivalent to that of the default, which is;
  bin:bin (3:4).

  The format of the exports file is as follows:

  pathname [option ...] [identifier ...]

  #comments

  The pathname specifies the name of a mounted local filesystem or a direc-
  tory of a mounted local filesystem.  The pathname must begin in column 1.

  The following are valid export file options:

  -root=0   Maps client superuser access to uid 0 for all hosts mounting this
            path.  If you want to allow client superusers access to the
            filesystem or directory with the same permissions as a local
            superuser, use -root=0.  Use -root=0 only if you trust the
            superuser on the client system.  The default is for client
            superusers to be mapped to uid -2, which maps a client superuser
            to nobody.  This limits access to world accessible files.  If
            both the -root=0 option and the -anon=uid option are used, the
            root option overrides the uid specified in anon for client
            superusers.
-root=hostlist
            Maps the client superusers on the specified hosts only to uid 0.
            The format for the hostlist argument is as follows:

                 client[:client]...

            The client specification can be a host name or IP address.  By
            default, client superusers are mapped to -2.  This option over-
            rides the uid specified in -anon=uid for client superusers in
            hostlist.

  -anon=uid Maps anonymous users to the specified uid.  Client superusers are
            considered anonymous by the NFS server, as are requests that come
            in without UNIX authentication.  By default, anonymous users are
            mapped to uid -2.  Setting anon to -1 disables anonymous access.

  -ro       The filesystem or directory is exported read-only (default is
            read-write).  The -o option is a synonym for -ro for backward
            compatibility.

  -rw=hostlist
            limits read-write access to the hosts specified.  All other hosts
            allowed to mount this path are granted read-only access.  The
            format for the hostlist argument is as follows:

                 client[:client]...

            The client specification can be a host name or IP address.  If
            both the -ro and -rw=hostlist options are specified, -rw pre-
            vails.

  -public   Exports a filesystem or directory for WebNFS public access.  Note
            that only one exported filesystem can have this option set.

                                          Note
       When the -public option is set, the mount access list is ignored by
       the WebNFS server. This means that all hosts using the WebNFS protocol
       have access to this directory.

       After setting the -public option, be sure to send the mountd process a
       HUP signal. See kill(1) for further information.

  -index    Used with -public option. Enables the server to look for an
            index.html file when given a directory name.

  -access=hostlist
            Specifies the hosts to grant mount access to.  The format for the
            hostlist argument is as follows:

                 client[:client]...

            The client specification can be a host name, IP address, or NIS
            network group.  This option is provided for readability and com-
            patibility with certain export file formats.  Alternatively, to
            identify the client systems who are allowed access to this export
            use the whitespace separated identifier list described below.
The options can be applied to both file system and directory entries in
  /etc/exports.

  Alternatively, you can list options using only one leading dash and
  separating them with commas as in -option[,option]....

  You use the identifier field to specify host names, network groups, or
  both, separated by white space that specify the access list for this
  export.  Host names can optionally contain the local BIND domain name.  A
  whitespace character in the left-most position of a line indicates line
  continuation.

                                     Note
       If no hosts or netgroups are specified, the mount daemon exports this
       file system or directory to anyone requesting it.  See the mountd(8)
       reference page for information on how to limit this scope to known
       hosts or to hosts in the same BIND domain.

  For example, suppose you enter:

       /usr -root=0 milan kuan_yin.cis.berkeley.edu
       /usr/local 555.555.55.55
       /u2 -ro
       /u3/dir1 -rw=milan:venice:florence
       /u3/dir2 -root=milan,access=venice:florence
       /u3/dir3 -root=0,access=milan:venice:florence
       /u3/dir4 -root=0 milan venice florence
       /u3/dir5 -root=milan -anon=-1
       /u3/dir6 -ro -public milan venice florence

  If /usr, /u2 and /u3 are local file system mount points, this specifies the
  following:

    +  /usr is exported read-write to hosts milan and
       kuan_yin.cis.berkeley.edu with root mapped to uid=0.

    +  /usr/local is exported read-write to host 555.555.55.55 with root
       mapped to -2.  (For security reasons, this example uses the fictitious
       IP address 555.555.55.55.)

    +  /u2 is exported to all hosts read-only with root mapped to -2.

    +  /u3/dir1 is exported read-write to hosts milan, venice, and florence
       and read-only to all other hosts.  For all hosts, root is mapped to
       -2.

    +  /u3/dir2 is exported with root mapped to 0 to host milan.  Hosts
       milan, venice, and florence are allowed to mount this directory read-
       write.  Root on hosts venice and florence is mapped to -2.

    +  /u3/dir3 is exported read-write and with root mapped to 0 to hosts
       milan, venice, and florence.

    +  /u3/dir4 is exported in the same manner as the previous example.

    +  /u3/dir5 is exported read-write to all hosts.  Anonymous users are not
       allowed to mount this directory, with the exception of the client
       superuser on host milan.  Root is mapped to 0 on host milan and to -2
+  /u3/dir2 is exported with root mapped to 0 to host milan.  Hosts
       milan, venice, and florence are allowed to mount this directory read-
       write.  Root on hosts venice and florence is mapped to -2.

    +  /u3/dir3 is exported read-write and with root mapped to 0 to hosts
       milan, venice, and florence.

    +  /u3/dir4 is exported in the same manner as the previous example.

    +  /u3/dir5 is exported read-write to all hosts.  Anonymous users are not
       allowed to mount this directory, with the exception of the client
       superuser on host milan.  Root is mapped to 0 on host milan and to -2
       on all other hosts.

    +  /u3/dir6 Hosts milan, venice, and florence are allowed to mount this
       directory read-only. All other hosts have read-only WebNFS access, but
       cannot mount this directory.

  Each file system that you want to allow clients to mount must be explicitly
  defined.  Exporting only the root (/) will not allow clients to mount /usr.
  Exporting only /usr will not allow clients to mount /usr/local, if it is a
  file system.

  Duplicate directory entries are not allowed.  The first entry is valid and
  following duplicates are ignored.

  Desired export options must be explicitly specified for each exported
  resource: file system or directory.  If a file system and subdirectories
  within it are exported, the options associated with the file system are not
  ``inherited.''  You do not need to export an entire file system to allow
  clients to mount subdirectories within it.

  The access list associated with each exported resource identifies which
  clients can mount that resource with the specified options.  For example,
  you can export an entire file system read-only, with a subdirectory within
  it exported read-write to a subset of clients.  If a client that is not
  identified in the export access list of a directory attempts to mount it,
  then access is checked against the closest exported ancestor.  If mount
  access is allowed at a higher level in the directory tree of the file sys-
  tem, the export options associated with the successful match will be in
  effect.

  To make a change to the exports file and have it take effect immediately,
  send the mountd process a HUP signal.  Otherwise, the mountd process will
  reread the exports file the next time it receives a mount request from an
  NFS client or a showmount -e request.
