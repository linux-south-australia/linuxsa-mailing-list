I don't think so.

There are other options but they are all pretty expensive. As in generally 
more
expensive than ISDN.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, if any cable service does come to SA, will we be able to use it from
&gt; our Linux boxes? I don't see why not, but (as usual), the only 'supported'
&gt; platforms are Windows 9x/NT and the Mac. like I said, I don't see why it
&gt; wouldn't work, since it uses an ethernet interface (I don't know the correct
&gt; term), but from what I read, there's some software that you need to install,
&gt; and perhaps they somehow check if you're running it?


Well that means that the set up cd is  for MacOs/Win95, since thE majority
of support staff for Optus/Bigpong(atleast the ones mortal users can
get hold of) are trained to say "put the cdrom in your cd rom player. Now
double click this icon -  did it work?"

As you I suspect you can use other OS's just (as usual) don't expect
support.

As you say it is after all only ehthernet and IP.

Would be interesting to know how they do address allocation, ie staic
or DHCP or what?

         Some people have a way about them that seems to say: "If I have
