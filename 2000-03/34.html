&gt; 
&gt; Two things immediately leap to mind.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  If you're using the native OSF linker, it might be stripping the
&gt;     comments section before linking (see 2).
&gt; 2)  COFF, like ELF, has seperate sections for the various segments
&gt;     (code, data, BSS, and others).  There may be a comments section
&gt;     that the #ident string is being placed into.  I can't remember
&gt;     if there are any utilities that come with OSF that will list
&gt;     what sections are contained within a COFF file.  A workaround
&gt;     is to use:
&gt; 
&gt;         static char ident[] = "#IDENT string goes here."
&gt; 
&gt; I'd examine the intermediate object file to see if the string is
&gt; being placed in there; that would then isolate the problem to the
&gt; compiler or the linker.

The intermediate object files were not receiving the ident string
anywhere within them. (Well nowhere that strings, grep or vi could
find.)
Hence, my belief that it is gcc that is no placing them in there. That
still leaves the preprocessor as well, right?
It should rule the linker out though.

The binaries don't appear to contain the string anywhere, either..Again,
verified with vi strings and grep. 

The DEC cc supports this feature, but I wonder why gcc doesn't seem to
work with it on this platform. Bad COFF support perhaps? Seems
unlikely.. Does Tru64 support ELF?
DOes anyone have Alpha/Linux lying around that can test both COFF and
ELF output and see if both recognize #idents, maybe?

Thanks

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; Plenty, but most are of a lewd nature.
64 bit isnt that erotic...is it?
Remember, it's not how many you've got, it's how well you use them.
&gt;
