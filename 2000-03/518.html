&gt; What exactly is the problem?
&gt; 

Boy am I glad you asked. I thought I knew, but when I sat down to do
some definitive system testing, I found out I didn't know at all ;)

It appears that PCMCIA won't happen regardless of whether I use the
modem module or not. I probably confused myself in the rush to get it
all running all at once.

What is happening is that if I enable PCMCIA services to start at boot,
a series of modules are loaded, or actually one in the series isn't
loading. I have not got as far as configuring any of it yet, as it won't
boot that far.

/etc/conf.modules has
pre-install pcmcia_core /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia start

I put set -x in the above script and it shows that pcmcia_core.o loads,
and that it then tries to load i82365.o and completely hangs the
machine, requiring a hardware reset to take control back. i82365 is
defined in /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia which is sourced by the init script.
The last of the modules it would try to load if it got that far is ds.o

/proc/pci has among other things
Bus 0, device 19, function 0:
CardBus Bridge: Toshiba ToPIC97 (rev 7).
Slow devsel. Fast back-to-back capable. Master Capable. No Bursts

I don't know if any of this gives you a clue, but it doesn't to me. I
have looked in the logs for errors that might shed light but nothing
that remotely looks like it.

Any instructions on what/where to look cheerfully received.

Cheers,

Bruce
