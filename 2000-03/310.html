 &gt; Is anyone else having DNS problems with Internode at all?
 
[ fx: mark puts his Internode hat on ]

 &gt; I am currently having the following problems:
 &gt;   I cannot resolve any samba.org addresses via Internode. Eg, www.samba.org
 &gt;   or us1.samba.org, etc.
 
<A HREF="mailto:newton@gizmo">newton@gizmo</A>&gt; nslookup -q=any samba.org.
Server:  ns2.on.net
Address:  192.231.203.2

Non-authoritative answer:
samba.org       nameserver = KONG.BSTC.NET
samba.org       nameserver = SAMBA.ANU.EDU.AU

Authoritative answers can be found from:
samba.org       nameserver = KONG.BSTC.NET
samba.org       nameserver = SAMBA.ANU.EDU.AU
KONG.BSTC.NET   internet address = 63.238.153.11


Ok, so samba.anu.edu.au is one of the official nameservers for samba.org.
Curious, there's no IP address listed for it, so let's find out who it
really is:

<A HREF="mailto:newton@gizmo">newton@gizmo</A>&gt; nslookup -q=any samba.anu.edu.au. ns1.anu.edu.au.
Server:  ns1.anu.edu.au
Address:  150.203.1.10

samba.anu.edu.au        canonical name = samba.org
anu.edu.au      nameserver = ns1.anu.edu.au
anu.edu.au      nameserver = una.anu.edu.au
anu.edu.au      nameserver = ns.adelaide.edu.au
ns1.anu.edu.au  internet address = 150.203.1.10
una.anu.edu.au  internet address = 150.203.22.28
ns.adelaide.edu.au      internet address = 129.127.40.3
<A HREF="mailto:newton@gizmo">newton@gizmo</A>&gt; 

Bloody hell, it's a CNAME -- no wonder it isn't working:  You aren't
supposed to use CNAMEs in NS records.  Bizarre DNS failures caused
by poisoned cache entries will result if you do.  

Funnily enough, it looks like our cache has been poisoned with respect
to "samba.org".  I can only see NS records for it, but other nameservers
I've queried elsewhere in the world return A records when I ask for them.

So, I'm about to restart our nameservers here, which will have the 
effect of clearing the bogus cache data.  Meanwhile, you should do
one of the following:

   (a) talk to the ANU hostmaster;  Get them to change "samba.anu.edu.au"
       from a CNAME record to an A record with IP address 150.203.164.44; or

   (b) talk to the samba.org hostmaster;  Get them to redelegate samba.org
       so that samba.anu.edu.au does not appear as one of the official
       nameservers for the zone (they could use "samba.org" as one of the
       official servers instead; it's supposed to be the same machine, after
       all);  or

Without doing one of those things, the CNAME record will cause wierd 
failures on a subset of nameservers across the net (the exact subset
will probably depend on the version of BIND which is in use, which might
explain why many other ISPs can resolve your queries).  It may work in
99.9% of cases, but a CNAME in an NS record really isn't the right thing
to do.

 &gt; I have spoken to Internode tech support on this,

Who did you call?  A quick straw poll around the office hasn't turned up
anyone who rememered talking to you, and I don't know who would have told
you that samba.org is being moved.

 &gt; and their claim is that
 &gt; the Samba.org domain is being moved and the problems are to be expected.
 &gt; This I find hard to believe for two reasons:
 &gt; 1. As a member of the Samba team I have heard nothing about any such move.
 &gt; 2. I can resolve these names to addresses from another machine in Adelaide 
 &gt;    as well as other machines in Canberra.

I've done a bit more investigation about this last comment, which has 
uncovered a quirk which is also having an effect -- One of the samba.org
nameservers is at 63.238.153.11.  If I trace to that from one of our
networks which is routed via Telstra, the trace stops inside alter.net's
network in the US.  If I do it from one of our networks which is routed
via our satellite connectivity to the US, it goes "all the way".  This 
suggests that either Telstra is incorrectly advertising the routes we're
advertising to them, or alter.net is incorrectly receiving them (unsure
at the moment - I haven't found any other subnets which experience that 
problem so it's a bit harder to test).  In any case, our Australian
nameservers are on terrestrially-routed subnets, so they're affected by
this.

I've logged a fault with Telstra to get them to check-up on those
advertisements;  we'll get this sorted out as soon as possible. 

Note that if samba.org was properly delegated (i.e.: the NS records
pointed to A records instead of CNAMEs) this wouldn't be a problem
because our nameservers would be able to fall-back to the ANU ones
in the event that the overseas ones weren't reachable, but that's sadly
impossible at the moment.

Cheers,

    - mark
