Hi Brian

&gt; Anyone know about Quantum Sirocco 3.5 series HD?  I know Quantum drives
can
&gt; be a bit odd.  So can some bioses.  :-(
&gt; The 2.4G one I have is recognised as 450M, with irrelevant heads;
&gt; cylinders;sectors by the bios in LBA.  I can get the bios to correctly
&gt; identify cyl;hds;sector in NORMAL mode - but then w95 coughs.
&gt; Bios is Award v 4.5 1994  #11/09/94-SIS-85C47IE-2C419C31-00

I have seen this before. Basically your BIOS is too old and can't deal
with such a large HDD. I have never found it to be a problem though.
Just let it run in LBA mode as a 450MB drive and it should work and you
should have full access to all 2.4GB. I have this very situation running at
the mo at my parents place. I two years back I gave them my old AMD
DX4-100 and put in their new Seagate 2.4GB 5400RPM drive (cost an
arm and a leg). This gave that exact problem but it has been working fine
for some time now.

If it doesn't work for you I think your best bet is upgrade the BIOS. There
has to be a newer one for your motherboard. Check out:

You should find yours there somewhere.

PS. I should probably say that the reason it comes up with 450MB is
because one of the settings (I think cyl, off the top of my head) clocks
over. eg; max=1024, actual=1536, therefore 1536-1024=512cyl
