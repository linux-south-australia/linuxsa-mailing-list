Hopefully you're not sharing *the* /tmp directory.  Any Samba
guest user could then remotely exploit a /tmp race bug in an
application.


&gt; First, why does it take so long to boot the linux box. It hangs (for 5
&gt; minutes and more) on OPENMAIL, HTTPD and SMB. i guess i can just stop them
&gt; from loading at start-up, but should this happen?

This is typical of DNS being unavailable as the machine boots.

Assuming you're not using DHCP (because if you do, all this magic
is done for you, that's why network administrators love it so).

Have a look in /etc/resolv.conf and use "dig @" to ensure that
each of the IP addresses listed there is a working nameserver
and are returning consistent results.

  search aarnet.edu.au
  nameserver 126.1.1.10
  nameserver 126.2.2.20

    The exact IP addresses will be provided by your site sysadm.

  dig @126.1.1.10 bush.aarnet.edu.au
  ANSWER
  10.0.0.1 ... bush.aarnet.edu.au

Your machine should be listed in /etc/hosts

  127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
  10.0.0.1  bush.aarnet.edu.au bush

And /etc/nsswitch.conf should say:

  hosts: files dns

Since you're in a corporate environment, you should really
be using DHCP.  Just let your network administrator know that
you are running a server (and they'll than make sure it gets
the same IP address each time you boot).


&gt; Second, Since the win95 boxes aren't logging-on (as such) to the linux box
&gt; (not loggin to NT) should the win95 boxes be able to change their passwords
&gt; to the linux box. eg can fred change his password to access his shares on
&gt; the linux box?

This gets confusing as there are four passwords for one person:
their Windows 95 logon password, their Windows 95 share password,
their Samba password and their Linux password.

The Windows 95 machines are logging onto the Samba share on the
Linux box.

The Windows 95 share password and the Samba password must match.

The Windows 95 share password defaults to the Windows 95 password
[this is certainly true of NT, and I think, of 95]

The Samba password is usually held in the file /etc/smbpasswd and
maintained by the smbpasswd utility.  You can do some tricky stuff
to either use the person's Linux password (but you need to send
cleartext passwords for this) or maintain /etc/smbpasswd in sync
with the person's Linux password (install /lib/security/pam_smbpass.so).
