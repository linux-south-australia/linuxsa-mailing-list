&gt; It appears to be Netscapes DNS resolver (why they couldn't use the
&gt; [working] Unix one, we'll never know).

 - The UNIX DNS resolver is single threaded.  So Netscape wouldn't
   repsond whilst and address was being resolved.  Thus the seperate
   process: it blocks allowing the main process to continue to
   handle user interface events.

 - The UNIX DNS resolver doesn't cache responses.  Web browsers
   resolve a DNS name to an IP address every time a URL is accessed.
   So the Netscape application caches responses because the OS
   doesn't.


&gt; Maybe someone can offer a better solution?

I start up with a home page like:

   <A HREF="file:///home/gdt/">file:///home/gdt/</A>

so that Netscape needn't do any DNS lookups when starting.  I also
make the DNS timeout faster by adding this to /etc/resolv.conf:

  options timeout:10 attempts:1

You might need to have a higher timeout, depending on your ISP's
DNS server and connectivity.

Beyond that I can't help, as I read my e-mail from home using IMAP
whilst online.  That way I can have the same Inbox and folders on
all my machines and only handle each mail message once.

Regards,
Glen

 [1] To forstall the rush of nit-picking, yes multithreaded DNS libraries
     exists and, yes, you can set up a caching-only DNS server.  Neither
     of these are common across the range of UNIX workstations that
     Netscape runs on.
