Me too....

I've had the situation where the mouse didn't work on a computer
that I was installing linux on, and the mouse didn't work,
and the tools (SaX in SuSE) needed a mouse to change the
mouse configuration. Most frstrating!

A similar situation arose when I was using an external mouse
for my laptop.
I found that every time I removed the mouse, both the
internal and external mouse became permanently
ineffective, requiring a re-boot.

Back in the olden days (yawn), I remember that my Atari ST
had alt-arrow commands that could do anything that a mouse 
could do, and that was very useful indeed.
Even the evil OS family (cross fingers to make cross,
vade retro etc.) has such commands, as I have found on
my handheld thingy which worked fine even without
the touch-screen functioning.

So if anyone happens to know where to look for the 
kbd commands to move/activate the cursor, please do tell.
Then we can _all_ get some sleep....


Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Regarding that question I had about 
getting an office/workshop for a start-up
company to do linux-atm development, it looks
like I've settled for the Thebarton incubator.
(I'm lining up to be one of their chickens.)
A very good deal (govt subsidized) - I recommend it.
