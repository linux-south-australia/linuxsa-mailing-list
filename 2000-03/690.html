Taken from primus's website...I think.

===========================================================================


Primus Telecommunications has won the race to become the first Australian
phone company to launch a commercial data service based on
high-speed asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology.
ADSL operates over standard phone lines, theoretically  
allowing data speeds up to 140 times faster than a standard 56kbps modem.
ADSL transfers incoming information at up to 8 megabits
per second (Mbps) and sends data at about 1 Mbps. However, it requires a
special type of modem and operates only as long as a customer is within 5
km of a local telephone exchange.  

Beginning today, Primus is providing high-speed ADSL
connections to CBD customers in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and
Perth, and expects to expand coverage to the rest of those metropolitan
areas by the time rival Telstra begins offering its own ADSL
service in August.

The technology has been hugely popular in countries
such as New Zealand, the US and UK, where it has been commercially
available for more than a year.

ADSL's roll-out in Australia has been delayed, in part,
by a dispute over access to local telephone exchanges which are controlled
by Telstra.

Last year the Australian Competition and Consumer   
Commission forced Telstra to allow
competing phone companies access to local exchanges and
competitors were finally able to install ADSL equipment.

Primus has wasted no time in taking advantage of the 
decision. By beating Telstra to the
punch the company will probably kick off a price war
that will ultimately drive down the
price of high-speed (or "broadband") Internet access.  

Residential subscribers will pay about $75 a month for
ADSL service, which also requires a $400 ADSL modem. This is about the
same price as high-speed cable modem services already offered by Telstra
Big Pond Advance and <A HREF="mailto:Optus@Home.">Optus@Home.</A>

The Primus announcement yesterday appeared to catch
Telstra off guard. "We're in a competitive environment and we understand
that," a Telstra spokesperson said. "We will go into full roll-out from
August and we feel we will still be competitive."

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Probably the best place to post this to is aus.net.access.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Both carriers have no plans to come to Adelaide, but i do hear that ASDL
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; on it's way.... (apparently 8Mbit down/1Mbit up) :)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; First off, do people know who provide cable internet access, and wether
&gt; &gt; it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible use these connections from a linux box?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Optus's cable service's web page says it's only available in the eastern
&gt; &gt; &gt; states, but doesn't say when/if it'll ever be available in SA (or at
&gt; least
&gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't find it). Telstra's web site had me believe that's it's
&gt; available
&gt; &gt; &gt; in all states (there wasn't any mention of which states it was
&gt; available),
&gt; &gt; &gt; but when I called for more info, they told me it's not available here.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Are there any other cable providers? any in SA?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, if any cable service does come to SA, will we be able to use it
&gt; from
&gt; &gt; &gt; our Linux boxes? I don't see why not, but (as usual), the only
&gt; 'supported'
&gt; &gt; &gt; platforms are Windows 9x/NT and the Mac. like I said, I don't see why it
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't work, since it uses an ethernet interface (I don't know the
&gt; &gt; correct
&gt; &gt; &gt; term), but from what I read, there's some software that you need to
&gt; &gt; install,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and perhaps they somehow check if you're running it?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the info, and sorry that it's off topic. Is there perhaps a
&gt; &gt; &gt; better e-mail list to post this to? This is the only mailing list I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; subscribed to (and that I know of that's Australian) :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
