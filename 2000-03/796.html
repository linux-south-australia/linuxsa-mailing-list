Hi all

I've been checking out some of the network traffic monitoring tools f/Linux
out there.  The one which I'm most impressed with is IpTraf, which picks up
all types of traffic & does all the name resolution etc for http addresses (good
for what I want because it picks up websites)
However, it dumps all its data into one huge log file.  Its sorted into C-D
fields obviously but I want to be able to display it in some sort of legible
form for reporting etc.
I've played around with importing into a database (though Access doesnt look
at the file format but Excel will, go figure!) but would prefer not to write
a program to do it myself (I'm not much of a programmer anyway!)
Just wondering if anyone knows of any frontend programs, GUI-based or otherwise
for IpTraf?  Ideally it would be nice to have something looking like the Windoze
app SessionWall, but I dont expect miracles.  And if anyone knows of better
network monitors than IpTraf that would be great too.

TIA
