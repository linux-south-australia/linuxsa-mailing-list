&gt; into it, as we have a single LAN and an ISDN connection to the 'net. We
&gt; may need to buy a new router soon though.

If you are a typical high school then it is very likely that Linux _can_
do everything you want on quite a modest machine, though whether you
_should_ is another matter. I have run dozens of routing rules on such a
setup without any problem including several network cards and NAT on more
than one interface. In a highschool situation if you already have a
computer and are on a low budget then Linux is an obvious choice. FreeBSD
would do equally well.

Beyond questions of budget and existing hardware it is really a matter of
perference. You can do far more with a Linux firewall than you can do with
a low-end router, and the upgrade path is much more expensive for a
router. On the other hand you are more likely to have a plug and play
experience with a low-end router.

&gt; What kinds of hardware is needed for 128Kb ISDN? 

100MHz Pentium would be generous, 32Mb RAM comfortable. With this you
could also run other services on the same machine, such as proxy daemons.
At this sort of level you might be able to afford to have two identical
machines (except for ISDN card, perhaps)
