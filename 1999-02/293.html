firstly, sorry if it's better to send multiple e-mails, but I it's very
slightly easier for me to do it in one e-mail, so I will ;)

anyway, for those who would like to know the subject before reading on, I'll
be asking about ip forwarding/masquerading, missing kernel modules, kppp
(the dial program with KDE), files in /etc/rc.d/init.d (in redhat 5.2) and
cgi scripts. I'll start each topic with a *, so it's easy to find.

firstly,
*ip forwarding/masquerading:
I only just got around to reading the IP-Masquerading HOWTO and set it up on
my home network. A lot easier than i thought, it only took 2 ipfwadm
commands :) Anyway, I would like to use ICQ from the windows machine, but
since it's not connected direct, it's pointless listening to the ports.

I remember reading how to forward all requests sent to the linux box to
redirect them to another machine, but I can't find it in the archives on the
linuxsa site :( BTW, HTML'ed e-mails really do look horrible when viewed in
text :P
Could someone please tell me how to do it? I'd prefer not to run a socks
server (don't ask me why, it's a stupid reason anyway), but I will if i need
to. I quickly looked through the ipfwadm man page, but couldn't see how to
do it, and I havn't had time to look in much detail, because I have to go
soon. I figure it's easier for me to ask now, than give up trying later then
write the e-mail (yes, i'm lazy, i know)

Also, I read that you're supposed to load the masquerading modules manually,
since it "won't work" if kerneld loads it, but I managed to successfully do
a ftp session without loading the ip_masq_ftp module, and even while in the
session, lsmod didn't say it was loaded. are they actually needed?

*missing kernel modules
I decided to try the 2.2.1 kernel, but couldn't be bothered upgrading all
those different packages listed in the Changes file. I then did my own
compile of the 2.0.36 kernel, and noticed one problem I had with the 2.2.1
kernel.

When the computer boots up or shuts down, (when it changes to run level 1, i
think) it says:

modprobe: can't locate module net-pf-4
modprobe: can't locate module net-pf-5

then repeats it 2 more times (i think it was net-pf-4 and 5. I'm sure of
the -pf-4/5, but i think it was net before the end bit). Everything seems to
work with regard to the network (smbmount and ip masquerading), but I find
these messages strange. Will this cause any problems? is there any way to
stop those messages appearing if there won't be any problems?

the modules are installed properly, because the ne2k-pci (plus whatever ones
it uses) and the modules for my SB32 AWE works.

*kppp
I turned off the option of disconnecting when I quit X, for those rare
occasions I need to. I noticed that when i startx again, the kppp icon in
the systray isn't there, and if I load kppp, it won't go to the connected at
xxxxxxx/duration xxxxxxx screen, but where it asks you to connect. Is there
any way to get it to the connect speed/duration screen again? if not, it
doesn't matter.

*files in /etc/rc.d/init/d
I would like to make a script that works the same as the other files in that
directory that will start, stop and give the status of a program I would
like to run at boot time. Is there a program that will write the scripts, or
do I need to do them manually? I noticed that there are all similar files in
/etc/rc.d/rc*.d, so if I need to do them manually, i'll just put the command
in rc.local

*cgi-scripts
My parents really don't know much about computers, and wouldn't want to
telnet/log in to the linux box to connect to the ISP (i doubt I could
convince them, no matter how easy to try to make it). I was thinking if I
could have a CGI script, so they load the browser, and there could be a
button to connect and one to disconnect. Since i don't use apache/httpd
anyway, i could disable access for everyone except my networked computers,
so security is not a problem.

I have absolutly no programming experience (excluding HTML, but this can't
be done purely in HTML), so wouldn't know how or where to start. Could this
be done in bash scripts? if so, how would I get the script to be executed,
instead of just displayed on the browser window?

well, that's it for now ;)
anyone interested in how I went and/or how i did it, just e-mail me, and
I'll fill you in :)

also, thanks to those who got this far. you've no doubt heard it before, but
I love the help you all give to everyone else. It makes using Linux so easy
when you can't figure out how to do what you need to do for yourself.

Thanks again,
Andy
