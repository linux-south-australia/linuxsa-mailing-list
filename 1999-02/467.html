&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my computers. As the
&gt; subject suggests, I'm having problems trying to share via samba.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is as follows:
&gt; On my win98 box, i go to network neighborhood and the Linux box's netbios
&gt; name is listed. I try to open it, but it asks me for a password. I would
&gt; like to make it so you don't need any password and doesn't even ask you for
&gt; any, like sharing via Win98, but I don't know how to do this.
&gt;
&gt; In the smb.conf file, I have the line "guest account = guest". On my Win98
&gt; box, the login name is pii. I added the users pii and guest on the linux
&gt; box, and made the password the same. When i am prompted for the password, I
&gt; first tried just pressing enter, hoping it would be no password (and use the
&gt; guest account), but it told me the password is incorrect. I tried entering
&gt; the password that I set as pii's and guest's password, but that says
&gt; password incorrect. What have I done wrong?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy
&gt;
&gt; PS. I recieved one e-mail from someone asking me to mail them with any
&gt; success from the questions from the e-mail called "a few things". Well, i
&gt; stupidly lost the e-mail address, so I don't know who to reply to. to that
&gt; person and anyone interested: I am keeping a web page (at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~zivkotech/bilisili/linux/">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~zivkotech/bilisili/linux/</A> ) with details of
&gt; everything I achive in linux. You can look at that for how I 'fixed' the
&gt; 'problems', or e-mail me again and I promise not to lose your e-mail address
&gt; again ;)

hi,
make your smb.conf as simple as possible to start with and then make it tighter
as you go. try these settings...
[global]
workgroup = workgroup
security = user
allow hosts = your ip address here
[your share directory name here]
create mode = 0665
path =  /your/share/name
writable = yes
valid users = your login name on the linux box
write list = your login name on the linux box
public = yes

even some of these can be loft off.
restart the smbd
