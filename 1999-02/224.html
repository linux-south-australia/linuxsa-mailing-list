Linux SA people:

If you have a spare moment, could you please help me with
a little survey, the results of which I will publish to this
distribution list, but without info on individuals.

This is for poeple living in South Australia only,
and only if there's some chance that you might come to
the monthly linuxSA meetings this year.
My purpose is to determine what level of knowledge is
out there on Internet protocols and programming.
Then maybe I could put together a 60-90 minute
instant seminar/course on this subject.

Since Internet protocols are fundamental to linux, the
Internet, and life in general, I think it's important for
linux people to know what they are and even how to
program them. Anyway, enough said, here's the test:

=================================================================
Each question is worth 1 point. Total out of 10.
No cheating, no consulting textbooks, correspondence will
not be entered into, and the judge's decision is final.

You get 1 point for answering the specified answer or something
similar. Please assess yourself and send me an integer
in the range 0 to 10. Questions are _not_ in order of difficulty.

I will not reveal any info on
individual scores to anyone else, and info about individuals will
be deleted after the results are collated.

Q1:	What is the length of an IP packet header?
A1:	20 bytes [or more if there are options]

Q2:	What is the length of a TCP packet header?
A2:	20 bytes [or more if there are options]

Q3:	What is the length of a UDP packet header?
A3:	8 bytes

Q4:	What are the two main functions of TCP?
A4:	flow control and retransmission of lost packets

Q5:	Does UDP offer flow control and retransmission?
A5:	no

Q6:	What is the size of TCP port space?
A6:	16-bit [i.e. 65535 roughly]

Q7:	What is the size of UDP port space?
A7:	16-bit [i.e. 65535 roughly]

Q8:	What is the size of the IP address space?
A8:	32-bit [i.e. 4294967295 roughly]

Q9:	What is the Unix API function for writing data to a TCP connection
	called?
A9:	write()

Q10:	What does the Unix select() function do for TCP and UDP sockets?
A10:	It waits for read/write/error events on multiple sockets.

===================================================================

Please send me a rough result, or a precise result if possible.
Please send any flames directly to me.
Please don't send anything to "linuxSA" e-mail list about this,
unless your passions are simply beyond your control
at this time in your life.
If you want to indicate that you've found an error or imprecision
in my questions of answers, please send me mail directly,
not to the distribution list.

Many thanks in advance,

Alan Kennington.
