Upgrading to Linux 2.2 from a Redhat 5.2 base
---------------------------------------------

Synopsis

these notes have been derived after many installation attempts, and
hopefully, will be of use to anybody who wishes to upgrade their RH 5.2
system with as little pain as possible.

Nb/ it took me over a week to acquire, and install all distributions, and
8+ attempts.

I'm not much of a technical writer. I've tried my best to be as detailed
as possible... and i hope that you read ahead before starting the upgrade
so that you know what you're getting yourself into. I'll be happy to clear
up any abiguous areas and i'm sure there are plenty... anyway, without
further adue..


Disclaimer:

To put simply... if you banana your system using my notes, then i will not
be held responsible. in life there are no certainties.

Fully backup any existing fs you decide to upgrade. If you can't do this,
then don't continue.



needed 'things':

- Kernel Modules  2.1.121
- Dynamic Linker  1.9.9
- glibc2          2.0.7pre6
- Procinfo        15
- Net-Tools       1.49
- Util-Linux      2.9h
- ipchains        version ???
- ipmasqadm       version ???
- rescue disks, or another linux system  (with RPM program installed).
- lots of spare time

Files i used:

i got them mostly off sunsite.unc.edu, ftp.funet.fi and www.linuxhq.com

ld.so-1.9.9.tar.gz
glibc-2.0.7pre6.tar.gz
glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz
glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.7pre6.tar.gz
linux-2.2.0.tar.gz
util-linux-2.9h.tar.gz
net-tools-1.50.tar.gz
procinfo-16.tar.gz
modutils-2.1.121.tar.gz
patch-2.2.1.gz
ipchains-1.3.8.tar.gz
ipmasqadm-0.4.2.tar.gz

some of them are very hard to get.


There was some distributions i didn't install as i don't need them (also,
these were a bit hard to get hold of). But if you read the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxhq.com">http://www.linuxhq.com</A> and the Documentation/Changes file in the Linux
kernel dist, then that will give you a full detail of what you need...
infact, i recommend that you read it.


To do:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* back up

backup the following areas:

/bin
/etc
/lib
/sbin
/usr

i found it handly to write a script to do this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Install kernel 2.2, and configure only   (linux-2.2.0.tar.gz)

  - copy linux-2.2.0.tar.gz into /usr/src and extract it.
  - configure it by typing in:
      - make mrproper
      - make menuconfig

        enter in any old settings... it doesn't matter at this point.

      - make dep
      - make clean

the purpose of this is to set of necessary links and header files so that
glibc and other distributions compile without errors. if you don't do
this, then glibc2 and other distributions won't compile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Install Dynamic Linker   (ld.so-1.9.9.tar.gz)

this step is pretty simple. this distribution has all the binaries
pre-compiled, and it's just a matter of running a script:

  - extract and go into distribution

Nb/ from here on in, when i say "extract", i mean

     - gunzip &lt;dist&gt;.tar.gz
     - tar -xf &lt;dist&gt;.tar.gz
     cd &lt;dist&gt;


  - run ./instldso.sh -- force
  - rm /lib/ld-linux.so.1.9.5
  - rm /lib/ld.so.1.9.5
  - rm /lib/libdl.so.1.9.5

Nb/ don't try to remove the ld.so RPM. this linker is live, and killing it
will kill your system. be very careful. (unless you do it offline with
rescue disks).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* backup again


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* install glibc2   (glibc-2.0.7pre.tar.gz)

this is the fun bit.........

you have to be very careful. glibc is live.. and this distribution
replaces files in the /lib directory that are actively loaded with
executables.

 - get

  glibc-2.0.7pre.tar.gz
  glibc-crypt-2.0.6.tar.gz,
  glibc-linuxthreads-2.0.7pre.tar.gz 

  and extract them.


Nb/ i couldn't get hold of matching "addon's", but the crypt-2.0.6 works fine.


 - move crypt and linuxthread directories into the glibc-2.0.7pre6
directory.

 - enter into the glibc-2.0.7pre6 directory.

 - ./configure --with-gnu-binutils --enable-add-ons=crypt,linuxthreads

Nb/ crypt and linuxthreads are the directories you moved into the glibc
directory.

there is another addon called locale (foreign langauge support), but i
didn't bother putting it in. it wasn't mandatory.

 - edit the config.make file  (even, though it says not to).. ammend the
file paths as follows:

     install_root = /root/new
     prefix       = /usr
     exec_prefix  = /usr
     slib_dir     = /lib
     sysconfdir   = /etc
     rootsbindir  = /sbin

 - create a directory called "new".

    mkdir ../new

when you go to make, glibc will build in a nice safe location. by default,
glibc will install the libraries in /lib and /usr/lib hence removing the
live libraries and effectively halting your system..

 - run make

this will take a good hour to do. I noticed when i did it, that the dist.
compiles very cleanly.

 - make dvi   (optional)

if you're a programmer, then you'll want the dvi manual.

 - make install

this will take about the same time as a kernel build..

after it's complete, go into the new directory  (cd ../new) and have a
look at what has been built.



 - Reboot with a rescue disk, and install to live areas

Now we have to reboot the machine on some other fs (ie rescue disk) so
that we can copy the newly created libraries to their respective places.
make sure that your rescue disk has a working copy of RPM tool on it.


Once booted with a rescue disk, mount your main fs and delete the old
glibc2 libraries using the rpm utility. this will ensure that there is no
old files laying around that could upset our new install-

 for example

    mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
    rpm -e --root /mnt glibc-devel-*
    rpm -e --root /mnt glibc-*

Nb/ wildcards are to signify that i've forgotten the names of the RPM
distributions. you will have to find out the exact names by doing an 'rpm
-q -a --root /mnt'.

now we will put the new files in place-

    cd /mnt/root/new
    cp -faR * /mnt


That's it. It's installed. hopefully, correctly...

Now reboot the machine and see if it fires up. If it does, then
log on to a shell, and type in-

ldconfig

if you get no errors, then glibc2 has been installed correctly.

To finish off the glibc2 install, ensure that this link is inplace-

ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Australia/Darwin /etc/localtime

ofcourse, you will have to link it to your correct time zone. the above is
what i did.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Configure/Build/Install new kernel  (linux-2.2.0.tar.gz)

This bit is easy.

 - cd /usr/src/linux
 - make menuconfig

configure as required. Nb/ i have left out frame buffering and Unix98 pty
for now until i learn more about them.

 - make dep
 - make clean
 - make zImage
 - make modules
 - cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /boot

make sure your lilo is configured to read zImage... have a look in the
/etc/lilo.conf file to be sure. here's mine-

boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/zImage            &lt;&lt;------------- check here
        label=linux
        root=/dev/hda2
        read-only


 - lilo
 - rm /boot/System.map
 - cp System.map /boot
 - sync
 - make modules_install

 - cd /lib/modules
 - ln -s 2.2.0 preferred

if you have a 2.2.1 kernel, then link that file instead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
*backup

---------------------------------------------------------------------
*Install Util-Linux (util-linux-2.9h.tar.gz)

this one (like glibc2) is a bit dangerous to install, hence the need to
backup..

 - extract
 - edit the MCONFIG file and make the following ammendments-

       HAVE_PAM=yes
       HAVE_SLN=yes

 - make

/nb refer to "compilication problems" in the INSTALL file

  - make install
  - sync
  - reboot


Nb/ don't remove the existing RPM Util-linux distribution, as it deletes
more than you bargain for (i learnt this the hard way).

If your system boots up, you'll know that you're successful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Install ProcInfo  (procinfo-16.tar.gz)
