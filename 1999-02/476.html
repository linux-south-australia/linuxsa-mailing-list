Hey All,

Just a couple of quick little questions about upgrading the kernel in my
server. I want to know what sort of difficulties I might run into.

After attending the tutorial run last night by Paul, he told me about an
icq_masq module, which I went and downloaded, but found out it needs kernel
2.2.x and my server is only a Redhat 5.2 machine, which runs kernel 2.0.36.
The server only runs DNS, WWW, FTP and email for my domain, as well as
masquerading for my other machines on the LAN behind the server.

Will I run into any problems if I upgrade the kernel to 2.2.1? Will anything
break? I don't use the machine for anything else, only the Internet services
I listed above. The machine sits under one of my desks with no monitor and
no keyboard etc.

Do I have anything to worry about? I do know I'll need to upgrade from
ipfwadm to ipchains for the new kernel, but that's no problem, with all the
help we received last night at the tutorial. By the way, those of you who
didn't go last night missed out on a first class night :)

Cheers, and TIA everyone
Dazz
