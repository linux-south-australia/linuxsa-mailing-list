&gt;Good. EXCEPT, why are you mounting your CDROM in your home directory??
&gt;This may very well be the cause of your problem. Try mounting it either
&gt;in a subdirectory, like /home/pets/cdrom, or else under the /mnt/
&gt;hierachy. (eg /mnt/cdrom).
&gt;Then try installing again.. 
&gt;When you mount a filesystem in a directory, you only get what is on the
&gt;new filesystem - you DONT get both at once!

&gt; 
&gt; In Gnome I have granted "pets" super user equivalence.
&gt;I find that I run as a user who only has normal access like any other,
&gt;with the exception of sound and MSDOS filesystems. For installing
&gt;packages su is good enough for me. However, if you have got superuser
&gt;acess on pets, then I guess you do and that should be okay. You can
&gt;verify by typing 'groups' to see what you are in.
&gt;(including root I presume for superuser access).


Thank you very much Toby for your time and detailed helpful reply.

I have now successfully installed WordPerfect 8.0 according to your
advice. However, when I issue the command in XTerm viz.,
home/pets/wordperfect/wpbin/xwp I get the message "command not found"
(xwp).The manual indicates that I must be in the /wpbin directory to
issue the WP start command (xwp).

The following information has been gleaned re the xwp command, if it is
relevant.

Owner=pets
Group=pets
Access=rwxrwxrwx (I have changed it to that)
Type=ordinary file
Symbolic Link=nil


I must still be doing something wrong. Could I impose on you for a
little more help please.
Also I would really like a shortcut icon to startup with but the manual
seems to refer to that only being possible with a CDE (Common Desktop
Environment) which I am afraid I don't know about. 

Thanks again

Brenton Pettitt
