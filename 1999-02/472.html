Some of you at the same table as me may recall a discussion about
the technology of the future wrt bandwidth, CPU speeds, etc.  The
participants in the conversation fell roughly into groups of people
optimistic about the future wrt CPU speeds and available bandwidth,
people who went "wow!" at the capacities and speeds the first group
was seriously proposing, and people who were sceptical that terabits
per second and tens of gigahertz were even theoretically possible.

Here are some articles to follow up.  They're just a quick pruning
from slashdot, so they might not be spectacularly authorative, but
they serve as a useful illustration for the sceptics.

Russian E2K CPU runs at 1.2 GHz
          <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/19/1543222.shtml">http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/19/1543222.shtml</A>
          [ this is only the most recent gigahertz CPU article
	    I could find;  PowerPC cracked gigahertz clock rates
	    in the lab two years ago (and they've been pacing the
	    release ever since :-( ), and you can bet your arse
	    that Intel will have a gigahertz CPU before the second
	    half of next year.  we can assume gigahertz CPUs are
	    current technology, not tomorrow's technology. ]

Double-gate Transistors:  A technique from IBM produces transistors as
  small as 25 nm, compared to the more typical 250nm produced by today's
  technology.
	  <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/1999/0399issue/0399techbus4.html">http://www.sciam.com/1999/0399issue/0399techbus4.html</A>

The point under discussion at the dinner was "10 GHz CPU available
commercially in 5 years".  Existing commerical technology produces
gigahertz, emerging technology potentially allows die sizes to fall
by a factor of ten; an additional order of magnitude increase in
clock speed within five years isn't particularly unbelievable, IMHO.
Also, given that the capacity is there for an order of magnitude increase,
Moore's Law will continue to double capacities / clock-rates every year
until the next technological jump (at least 3 years:  we can fit three
doublings into an order of magnitude increase, after all).

As a final followup, we also discussed the virtually infinite amounts
of bandwidth now available, and its ubiquity in future once Telcos' 
artificial shortages lapse:

Siemans announces 1.2 terabits per second on a single piece of fibre
          <A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0">http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0</A>,4164,2213740,00.html

There's a nice comment at the bottom of the article about how the
capacity of the fibre is such that other technologies (routers, switches,
etc) will have to catch up before we can use it.  That dovetails nicely
with my effusiveness at the dinner, where I said, "Fibre is the only 
technology man has yet developed whose growth exceeds our capacity to 
use it." (actually referring to a comment from Stuart Fist from one of
his telco reports - URL on request).

Now if we can do something about large corporations leaving dog-turds
in our technological sandpit, the future is going to be a very fast place.
I'll send a chocolate frog to the first person who donates a 10 GHz 
motherboard to me :-)

Cheers,

   - mark
