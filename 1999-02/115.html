Heyas

Has anyone else had trouble mounting SMB shares onto their linux box,
when using late 2.1.x kernels or the 2.2.x kernels?

I've noticed it for quite a while. 
Type smbmount //wintermute/cd /mnt/cd -n -c penfold
(using various names and shares, but take it for granted that a public
share exists on wintermute, and that communications between the two
works.)
and I get an error telling me I need mount version 6.
smbclient -L wintermute or -L penfold works fine, mind you.
the windoze box can mount samba shares, but that's unrelated really.
(except for the nmbd bit)

Anyway, I  hacked the kernel source so that it would print out what
version of mount it thought I had, and it reckoned it was 5. I forced it
to let me use that, but that just caused wierd filesystem things to
happen, because I guess the mount really was too old.
However, mount --version reports 2.6l or something....

Anyway, either way I need a newer version of mount, but sunsite only had
the same version I have now, I think..

Can anyone explain to me what is going on, and where I can obtain newer
mount sources.

Thanks,
Toby
