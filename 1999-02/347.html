Hi Mr Stock

Well, Linux users might be a little different here in Australia [Lot's of
ISP's etc... perhaps not the desktop penetration].  I certainly don't think
we'd have anyone leading the charge dressed as Jedi Knights like they did in
Silicon Valley =).

Personally I'd love to see people rioting in the streets burning Bill Gates
effigies and Microsoft Press books.... but umm.... it's nothing more than an
interesting spectacle.  Since the EULA states that you've got to get the
refund from your OEM it was only worth complaining direct to Microsoft if
you had a spare day and felt like climbing 30 floors to their Adelaide
offices.

[Of course, the message that the O/S should be optional is pretty
important].

&gt; I know that during the whole process I was not "treated with courtesy
&gt; at all times", but maybe that is because I was in the middle.

Yeah, I wondered about this.  Still sell Toshiba products?

How many people have _never_ booted Windows on their machines anyway?  If
refund day had been constructed as a general protest rather than an attempt
to get refunds, then a lot of people would have felt more comfortable
participating.

[Microsoft keep screwing themselves in court anyway].
