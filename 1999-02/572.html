Is Windows a Virus?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-------

No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses (viri?) do:=20

They replicate quickly -- OK Windows does that.=20

Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as =
they do so -- OK Windows does that.=20

Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk -- OK Windows does =
that too.=20

Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable =
programs and systems. Sigh... Windows does that too.=20

Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow =
and the user will buy new hardware. Yup, that's with Windows, too.=20

Until now it seems that Windows might in fact be a virus, but there are =
some differences:=20

Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most =
systems, and are universally compatible. Their program code is fast, =
compact, efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they =
mature.=20

So, Windows is *not* a virus.=20
