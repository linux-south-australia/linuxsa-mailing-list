Thanks, all, for your help with my undermentioned &gt;sound problem. It is
now up and working.

&gt; I have one problem ,though, and that is to get my XPlayCD 2.1 up and
&gt; working as  "user" in Redhat. It works OK at root. Is this a permission
&gt; problem?
&gt; If it is I have a problem knowing which file permission to change. I've
&gt; tried changing permissions for /etc/rc.d/init.d/sound and
&gt; /var/lock/subsys/sound as these were the only two sound files the "Find"
&gt; utility came up with but  without success. I've also tried to su to root
&gt; but I don't know the console command for starting XPlay if in fact that
&gt; is a valid approach.?

Try chmod 666 /dev/cdrom (as root). If you don't want to do this for
some reason, you could do a chmod a+s /usr/X11/bin/XPlaycd (or wherever
it's located: try "whereis Xplaycd"), making the effective user for
everyone running Xplaycd root, though this is probably worse security
wise!

I chmoded /cdrom to 755 to give everyone read and execute permission on
the
device. Try that and see if it works.

chmod 755 /cdrom

Most likely the problem is that users by default don't have access to
the
sound device.

This can be fixed by doing: chmod 666 /dev/dsp
