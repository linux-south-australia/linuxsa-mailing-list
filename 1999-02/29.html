<H1>Installing Glibc 2.0.x for linux 2.2</H1>

hello all,

Last thursday, i started upgrading my machine from linux 2.0 or 2.2..

installing, upgrading linux 2.2 was fine, but i discovered, that some
needed distributions (ppp, net-tools) had difficulty compiling. these
distributions use both glib2 and linux headers.

i discovered that my installed glib2 (2.0.7) tends make the compiler
ignore certain h files in the linux headers, and this is where i'm getting
into grief..

nb/ i could make the glib headers scan these excluded headers for the
necessary definations, but it's this way for a very good reason (plus it's
not good karma to go around doing this). 

anyway, i figure that i must have a incompatable glib2 (even though the
linux Changes says that glibc 2.0.7 is ok)... or, because that this
machine is a redhat 5.1 installation, it could be a broken glib2.0.7
(which wouldn't surprise me)..

so, for the past 5 days, i've tried (and failed) to upgrade my dynamic
linker (to 1.9.9), libc (to 5.4.46), and upgrade glibc to something
greater than 2.0.7.   .. but i give up.

i've been using source code distributions from sunsite-
glibc-2.0.112.tar.gz, libc-5.4.46.tar.gz, ld-so.1.9.9.tar.gz. compiling
these is like pulling teeth... it's as though that the source code is
incompatable with the linux 2.2 headers.. it would take me days and days
to go through the source code of glib2 and libc to make it compile under
my configuration  (infact, i have sort of done this). 

i was wondering if anyone knows where there is a ported glib2 and libc5
around, or even better- compiled libraries?.

i would be most greatful ;).

see ya
