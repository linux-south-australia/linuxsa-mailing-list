&gt;&gt; I was just wondering is it possible to have ftpd mail me daily logs?
&gt; Put the following in a daily cron job.
&gt; [cron job to ftp log files removed]

Not sure, but I think that's an answer to a different question.

Can ftpd mail you daily logs?  No, ftpd logs using syslog, and so
it's syslogd which you might want to mail the log files.  Okay,
can syslogd mail the log files to you?  No, syslogd just writes
the log entries.  (In truth it could, but the answer is absurdly
complicated and simplifies to no.)  Well is there any way you
can have the log files mailed to you?  Of course.  This is Unix. :-)

Before you mail a (syslog) log file you need to ensure that syslog
won't write any new log entries into that file.  You do that by
renaming the file and then sending a signal to syslog; the signal
causes syslog to reopen the log files:

  mv /var/log/messages /var/log/messages.temp
  kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslog.pid`

Then mail the log <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

  mail -s "log file" <A HREF="mailto:xyzzy@advent.rules.ok">xyzzy@advent.rules.ok</A> &lt; /var/log/messages.temp
  rm /var/log/messages.temp

These commands should be executed by cron; or better: look at
logrotate.

Voilla; and aren't you glad you don't use Windows?  ;-)


&gt;&gt; and perhaps make it log to another file other then /var/log/messages for FTP
&gt;&gt; useage only? :)

This I'm not so sure about.  Unfortunately syslog has an overly
simplistic notion of what logging is about.  Log entries comprise
three components: The facility; the log level; and the log text.

The facility is chosen from the fixed set of auth, authpriv, cron,
daemon, kern, lpr, mail, mark, news, syslog, user, uucp and local0
through local7.  There is no restriction on which facility a program
can use, so for example ftpd could, if it's author so chose, log as
cron.  Nothing would stop that.  Note that none of the facilities is
ftp.  (I don't know what facility ftpd uses; the answer is there
somewhere; seek and ye shall find.)

The level is chosen from the fixed set of debug, info, notice, warning,
err, crit, alert and emerg.  There is no restriction on which level
a program can use, so for example ftpd could, if it's author so chose,
log everything as emerg.  Of course the author has done no such thing.
Generally programs log using a number of different levels, depending
on what they are logging.  This permits you to discard boring log
entries (e.g. debug) and to concentrate on those which are important
(e.g. crit, alert or emerg).

You can choose the log file used for any set of facilities and levels.
Suppose ftpd used the daemon facility (it probably does), and suppose
nothing else used it (but I could almost guarantee that lots of other
subsystems also use daemon), then you could put ftpd's log entries
into any file.  E.g., put this in /etc/syslog.conf:

   daemon.*    /var/log/ftp.log

Voilla.  But sadly, not the answer you want.  The simple answer
would have been "no".  This answer is more interesting.

Regards,

David
