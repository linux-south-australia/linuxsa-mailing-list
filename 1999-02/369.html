&gt;Have a look at <A HREF="http://linux.dreamtime.org/decnet">http://linux.dreamtime.org/decnet</A> for info on Linux to
&gt;Decnet. I have great success with this fast growing project. I don't
&gt;know much about VMS bootstrapping or DEC X window. I am interfacing with

VAXstations undoubtedly used that great, non-routable protocol called MOP
(which stands for Maintenance Operations Protocol). 

It seems unlikely that anyone would have written a UNIX/Linux MOP listener
(actually, to clarify that, someone has: DEC/Digital did for ULTRIX and
Digital UNIX :-).

&gt;a VAX mainframe and providing file support to various Unix and Windows
&gt;systems, using a Linux machine as a router.

There are very good versions of TCP/IP for VMS. One such, speaking as an
ex-Digital employee, is Multinet from TGV (which stood for Two Guys and a
Vax), who were swallowed by Cisco, but Multinet was spat out again.
Internode would know something about it. Digital (now Compaq) has one as
well, but it was always running hard to catch up with Multinet.
