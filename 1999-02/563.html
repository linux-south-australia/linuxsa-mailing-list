Its nice for this relative Linux novice to be able to answer a question
(sort of). Hope it helps.
Having set up 2 scsi cd writers under RH Linux, this is what I did. 
Before I scrapped Bill's Finest I took note of what settings the scsi card
had under Windows. Then when installing Linux, it gets to a point where it
asks about scsi support (and probably doesn't detect your card) and asks
about any special commands required for the card. The reason that the card
isn't detected is that (I think) there is no boot rom onboard to tell the
world what it is. You mention aha1520 from the manual so we can assume it is
an Adaptec 1520 compatible device. You will need to enter a command like
'aha152x=0x340,12,7,1'
The exact entries after the equals sign you will have to find out your self
but the irq is probably 10 not 12 as in my example. Refer to the windows
settings if you can.
The scsi howto at <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/help/howto.html">http://www.linux.org/help/howto.html</A> will help. 
If you can find enough info to make this command string up yourself and
don't want to re-install, let me know. I can tell you how to get running (I
think) another way but its getting late this end for my little brain.

Just for interest, just up the road from LinuxSA is ASLUG. Yes a user group
exists in Alice Springs. Kind of puts things in perspective when a town of
27000 in the middle-of-bloody-nowhere has an active LUG.

Hope my rambling makes sense to you.

&gt; &gt; Heyas all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I tried to install RH5.2 on a friends machine today, but I had a few
&gt; &gt; problems with the onboard SCSI controller, it couldn't find it, and I
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; no idea what the options I am meant to put in are. The Machine is an
&gt; Acer
&gt; &gt; 486DX2/66 and I can't see a specific chip mentioned saying "this is the
&gt; SCSI
&gt; &gt; chip" but at the back of the manual it mentions aha1520 which is I
&gt; presume
&gt; &gt; the SCSI chip.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I try an autoprobe in setup, it is looking at irq 12, but it is
&gt; &gt; actually on irq 10. I have no idea about IO port ranges etc. Like I said
&gt; &gt; about, I don't have any idea of the options to tell it not to look at
&gt; irq
&gt; &gt; 12.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can anyone help me with getting this working?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers, and TIA
&gt; &gt; Dazz
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I have an acer 486dx33 with onboard scsi that I am going to put redhat 5.2
&gt; on
&gt; this week, and it has an onboard scsi (probably the same one).  In mine
&gt; there is
&gt; a big adaptec chip right by the scsi connector that says
&gt; 
&gt; adaptec, inc.
&gt; aic-6260al
&gt; zga221
&gt; 623700
&gt; ms251734.
&gt; 
&gt; Presumably the aic-6260al is the name of the chip.  Un fortunatly I dont
&gt; have
&gt; the answer, but I'd be very interested to know it.  This info might help
&gt; someone
&gt; come up with the answer...
