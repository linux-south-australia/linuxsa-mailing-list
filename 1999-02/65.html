Hi, now running almost smoothly on my Linux machine 486 DX4100 machine now
except that I have a problem with my keyboard in that it keeps repeating
characters, mainly v and s and the keys on that side of the keyboard.  I
thought it was a keyboard error so I have tried another keyboard but that
didnt help.  this makes entering commands very difficult.  Is their a way
to slow down the key repeat rate?  and is this a known problem (I guess it
could always be the keyboard controller on my motherboard but I have no
problems with it under windoze95.  Thanks in advance.

regards

   Matthew Mills
