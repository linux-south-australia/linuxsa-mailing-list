Hi Ben,

the first idea that comes into my head is that you could make a
suid-root shell script that changes a symbolic link in /etc/X11/ to make
XF86Config point to, say, ~/.XF86Config, and then run startx.
All users would call this script instead of startx.
The script would check if a ~/.XF86Config existed, and if it doesn't, it
points to a default XF86Config in /etc/X11
This is slightly bodgy, because if two users simultaneously try to do
this to load X, then you've got file locking and race problems, but with
a little work, in perl or C, it'd be easy enough to say
lock the link file
if not able to, wait until you can, then lock it, then wait a couple of
seconds anyway in case something's still loading from it.
then change the link, and unlock it.

if able to lock file, still delay a couple of seconds anyway incase the
last person has already run the script.


A better idea would be to lock the file, and then unlock it with an exec
in the .xinitrc or something....but that's starting to get messy, but
could still be done reasonably. Just the runcustomX script would need to
lock file, change link, then fork off, and let X load. Then the now
background process waits until it receives a signal, (probably sighup or
something), and then unlocks the file and quits.
in the .xinitrc you'd make a command there that sends the appropriate
signal (eg. kill `cat /var/run/$USER_customx.pid` )

Still, it demonstrates that you can get it done if you want it.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;         Does anyone know of a way to let a user have an alternative
&gt; XF86Config file without giving them root privilages?
&gt; 
&gt; For example:
&gt; 
&gt; One user wants a virtual desktop of 1024x768 and the other 800x600. Both
&gt; users log in via the console but one knows what they are doing, the other
&gt; has no idea hence I don't want to give them root permission (indicated
&gt; as one way to have seperate XF86Config files in the man page).
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
