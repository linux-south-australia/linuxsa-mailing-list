&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as Australians are prepared to WATCH
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather than act, the status quo will rule.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You really have a chip on your shoulder about Australians don't you?
&gt; &gt;It comes through in your messages time and time again, and has done
&gt; &gt;so ever since I first encountered you.  You're so obnoxiously racist!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    - mark
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Have your arguments run out again, that
&gt; you must resort to Name-Calling, Mark?
&gt; 
&gt; Your comment does not address the issue...
&gt; ('not the first time that I have observed this)
&gt; 
&gt; By attacking the opponent instead of his arguments,
&gt; you are committing the "ad hominim" fallacy (which,
&gt; I may have been spelled incorrectly for lack of Latin).
&gt; 
&gt; By way of reply, I can say that - if I were in USA and
&gt; wanting to make a comment on the people I would
&gt; then be in a better position of observing - I might
&gt; have used "Americans" instead of "Australians"
&gt; 
&gt; I would accept the label of "editorial license" but
&gt; not the unthinking person's scream of "racist"
&gt; 
&gt; By way of getting you back on track, I now ask you:
&gt; 
&gt; How do we get people here (of any race, nationality,
&gt; gender, etc.) to stand up against such insulting S.A.
&gt; legislation as:
&gt; 
&gt; - trading hours restrictions...?
&gt; - concessional laws for pokie venues...?
&gt; 
&gt; More to the point at hand, how do we get people to
&gt; make more waves when:
&gt; 
&gt; - ACCC "says" the laws it enforces would
&gt;    not preclude OEM's from including a par-
&gt;    ticular operating system with each computer,
&gt;    even when the Buyer has indicated a preference
&gt;    for quite another legitimately licensed replacement?
&gt; 
&gt; (Disabled people - whom I have also encour-
&gt; aged to take a stand against the status quo -
&gt; went further, at a time when busses could not
&gt; carry wheelchairs... result?  Now they can!
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, there was no Mark Newton, there,
&gt; to label my input to that community "Racist" ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Ask yourself:  Do we do enough?
&gt; 
&gt; Compare to:  The Boston Tea Party (long ago),
&gt; California's Referendum (stopping the rise, for
&gt; a while, of what we call rates), Demonstrations
&gt; against Racism/Apartheid, Windows Refund Day
&gt; 
&gt; In Switzerland, a relatively small number of indi-
&gt; viduals can force a referendum that THEY write
&gt; themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; In Sweden, a very strong Freedom of Information
&gt; is written into the Swedish constitution; it QUITE
&gt; RIGHTLY provides easy and cheap (usually free)
&gt; access to government reports, libraries, document
&gt; - even the Prime Minister's official mail!
&gt; 
&gt; The Berlin Wall is down... Swiss banks are return-
&gt; ing money to its original owners... etc. etc. etc. all
&gt; because people would not take No for an answer.
&gt; 
&gt; You want to call one who encourages this kind of
&gt; action (i.e. not taking No) a Racist...?  Why not go
&gt; to work on the killer app - Newton 200x - instead?  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; At the moment, you seem more interested in
&gt; petty name-calling when I point out that *we*
&gt; Australians have room for improvement.
&gt; 
&gt; For my part, I'm free to find & try to transplant
&gt; World Best ideas from where ever I find them
&gt; 
&gt; I intend to continue to do this with or without
&gt; your support.  Either CONVINCE me or JOIN me  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Why accept 2nd best by wallowing in fallacies?
&gt; 
&gt; Who has so much time to waste...?
&gt; 
&gt; PS I have not forgotten your THREAT to publish
&gt; earlier statements which you attribute to me... i.e.
&gt; from private e-mails.
&gt; 
&gt; This name-calling and that kind of threatening
&gt; behavior suggest a person whose arguments
&gt; has run out... your effectiveness will be low -
&gt; except perhaps in the minds of those who may
