On the same subject, maybe you or someone else here could help with
'oversize' CPU and videocard cooling fans?
Pentium 2 and Celeron processors are quite nicely overclockable, except
that they do tend to start heating up.
In summer the ambient air temperature in my room usually gets over 40
degrees due to assorted hardware.. At this temperature not only do the
CPUs start getting pretty hot (as reported by the motherboards onboard
temperature sensors), but so does my video card and semi-obsolete
seperate 3d card.
Supposedly there are various 3rd party pentium 2 & celeron cooling fans
available, but I haven't seen any in SA. Likewise, there are supposed to
be dedicated fans for PCI-slot cards.
I'm a dedicated fan for linux, but it doesn't keep anything cool ;)

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Several things to ask today, but first of all, AMD & Linux
&gt; works perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone tried to run X on a S3 Neon (365). This is a new
&gt; chip from S3 that I picked up the other day from a supplier.
&gt; I haven't had any luck finding any info on it anywhere.
&gt; 
&gt; The next bit only of interest to people with ATX systems and
&gt; is not directly Linux related.
&gt; 
&gt; I know a lot of people out there are using new ATX systems
&gt; with socket seven chips (K6-2 etc) and I was wondering if
&gt; there was any interest in getting in some socket 7 size fans
&gt; that use power off the motherboard as opposed to the old AT style
&gt; that use a 5" type power connector. These fans are better
&gt; because they can be controlled by software via the motherboard,
&gt; neater (short thin cable to MB not power supply) will generate
&gt; an alarm if stops spinning, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; They can also be used without a heatsink as an extra case fan
&gt; if plugged into the case-fan connector on the MB. Use it to
&gt; increase air flow, cool HDD etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I, as a HW supplier have had no luck finding them locally but I
&gt; may be able to get a few from a rather shonky importer interstate.
&gt; I was originally just going to get two in for myself but I though
&gt; that some people in the group may be interested. If anyone is
&gt; they can contact me privately.
&gt; 
&gt; I expect them to cost between $25-30 (this is cost price + shipping)
&gt; so they aren't exactly cheap but just remember, why should Intel
&gt; CPU's have all the fun.
&gt; 
&gt; PS, If anyone knows where they can be bought here in SA could
&gt; they let me know.
