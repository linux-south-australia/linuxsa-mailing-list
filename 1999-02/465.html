Thanks to all who replied to my question about form mail scripts. It was
a bit of an unusual request, especially as I don't run an account on
senet, so if you are interested here's how it came to pass. (The usual
if you don't want to waste your time reading this... use the delete
button, Luke, use the delete button)

I am looking after a web page for a friend while he is away on hols, and
one of the jobs left to me was to add a feedback form. I have it working
now by using a remotely hosted cgi script on freedback.com, but it is
way messy, with advertising all over the place. But at least it will
suffice until next week. I wasn't comfortable emailing <A HREF="mailto:support@senet">support@senet</A> for
an account that isn't mine, so I found a quick and dirty work around. I
never found out the details of running the form mail script hosted by
senet, but as others have posted, they probably do have one up there for
their customers :-)

If you want to know what the fuss was about, look at:

Power to the people

Cheers,
