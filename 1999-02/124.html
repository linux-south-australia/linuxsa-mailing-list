Hi all...

I'm wanting to do some development in Java2 (JDK1.2), but it's not ready
for Linux yet, and there is no indication of when it will be... So, I
thought that I could get Solaris/intel for free from Sun (through the
promotion they have at the moment) in the meantime... But I checked
their hardware compatibility list, and they don't have my video card --
an AGP Viper V330. They didn't have any AGP cards, nor any with the same
chip as the Viper... However, a friend suggested that the card should
work in standard SVGA mode, not using any of the acceleration... I was
under the impression that if the OS is not AGP-aware, the card won't
even work (I seem to remember someone having that problem with Linux on
this list once)...

Anyone know anything about this? (my card works under Linux, but I
believe Linux has AGP support built in -- does it?)

TIA
rr

Microsoft isn't the answer. Microsoft is the question and the answer is
no.
