Hi ya,

Wow, this is like freaky...


WHAT CLASSPATH DOES
From: <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/README">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/README</A>

       The CLASSPATH tells the Java virtual machine and other  
       applications (which are located in the "jdk1.1.7B\bin" 
       directory) where to find the class libraries, such as 
       classes.zip file (which is in the lib directory).  
       By default, the java tools temporarily append the 
       following to whatever CLASSPATH you have explicitly 
       set in your startup <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

       .;[bin]\..\classes;[bin]\..\lib\classes.zip

       where [bin] is substituted by the absolute path to the   
       jdk1.1\bin directory.  Therefore, if you keep the bin and  
       lib directories at the same directory level (that is, if 
       they have a common parent directory), the executables 
       will find the classes.  You need to set the CLASSPATH only 
       if you move classes.zip or want to load a different library 
       (such as one you develop).

Since your issue is with netscape...

Java Applet Support:
From: /usr/doc/netscape-common-4.08/README

          Java Applet support is available for all Unix platforms.

          To run Java applets with the Java-enabled version, Communicator
          needs to be able to load Java class files from a file called
          java40.jar.  This file is included in the distribution, and is
          searched for using the following algorithm:

             if($CLASSPATH environment variable is set)
                 Look at $CLASSPATH, where $CLASSPATH is a
                 colon-delimited list of &lt;path&gt;/&lt;jar-file&gt; entries.
             else
                 Search in order:
                     &lt;program directory&gt;
                     $MOZILLA_HOME/java/classes
                     $HOME/.netscape
                     /usr/local/netscape/java/classes
                     /usr/local/lib/netscape

          If you were running Java with an earlier version of the Netscape
          Navigator, you need to replace your old moz2_0.car file, moz*.zip
          file, or java_3* file with the new java40.jar file supplied in
this
          distribution.  

--------------
It should just go if you installed Netscape from an RPM but
if not just verify your environment variable CLASSPATH and set
it to where ever your java40.jar file is, or move the file to one
of the above.

Subject: CLASSPATH


Hello,

Is anyone able to tell me where to find the "CLASSPATH"?
The file "java40.jar" is needed by the ISP sever and it keeps coming up with
an error!
It appears that it should be somewhere in Netscape, but I was unable to find
where is
supposed to be placed.
Thanks and best wishes,

Nick.
