&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my computers. As the
&gt;&gt; subject suggests, I'm having problems trying to share via samba.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The problem is as follows:
&gt;&gt; On my win98 box, i go to network neighborhood and the Linux box's netbios
&gt;&gt; name is listed. I try to open it, but it asks me for a password. I would
&gt;&gt; like to make it so you don't need any password and doesn't even ask you for
&gt;&gt; any, like sharing via Win98, but I don't know how to do this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the smb.conf file, I have the line "guest account = guest". On my Win98
&gt;&gt; box, the login name is pii. I added the users pii and guest on the linux
&gt;&gt; box, and made the password the same. When i am prompted for the password, I
&gt;&gt; first tried just pressing enter, hoping it would be no password (and use
the
&gt;&gt; guest account), but it told me the password is incorrect. I tried entering
&gt;&gt; the password that I set as pii's and guest's password, but that says
&gt;&gt; password incorrect. What have I done wrong?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Andy
&gt;
&gt;hi,
&gt;make your smb.conf as simple as possible to start with and then make it
tighter
&gt;as you go. try these settings...
&gt;[global]
&gt;workgroup = workgroup
&gt;security = user
&gt;allow hosts = your ip address here

Generally, in a closed network, allow hosts is not needed, and adds clutter.

&gt;[your share directory name here]
&gt;create mode = 0665
&gt;path =  /your/share/name
&gt;writable = yes
&gt;valid users = your login name on the linux box
&gt;write list = your login name on the linux box
&gt;public = yes

This of course deletes the guest account, and Samba uses the guest account
when opening IPC$. IPC$ is used in browsing servers, AFAIK.

It would be interesting to see a log level 5 log from smbd when you try to
browse the server from your Win98 box.  It should do a NetShareEnum, but
before that it should do a TconX to IPC$.

It would seem that authentication is failing. Does your guest account
exist? What username is being sent?

What version of Samba are you using?

&gt;even some of these can be loft off.
&gt;restart the smbd
