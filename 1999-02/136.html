&gt; As those of you know have been sorta noticing my posts over the last few weeks
&gt; will know, I've been slowly converting my system from Windows to Linux. I'm
&gt; gradulely getting there. Just a couple of programs that I still need which I
&gt; haven't got around to setting up under Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; One of these is the camera software. I've got a Kodak DC25 digital camera. It
&gt; comes with Windows software, which, I *think*, operates under Windows 3.1. (I
&gt; say think becuase I've never tried it, I've only used it under 95 and 98).
&gt; 
&gt; My question is this. Does anyone know of a Linux version of the software, or
&gt; has anyone had any experience getting the supplied software to run under wine?
&gt; 
&gt; The camera uses a RS232 interface to download the pictures. And the supplied
&gt; software saves the pictures in jpg format. (I'm guessing that's how the camera
&gt; stores them too...
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I haven't been able to get my DC50 to work under linux.. And I think the
DC25 uses a similar system..

You could probably get the .kdc files off ok, the problem is that the
format that KDC uses, is a super secret proprietary (patented) jpeg like
format.. that Kodak refused to release specs for..

The best we can hope for is a wine that will run the decoder software..
Which I have yet to make happen.

(BTW.. I was able to get a PCMCIA card reader to work under linux, and
using a FLASH card on the DC50.. it was MUCH easier to transfer files out
this way)
