&gt; [Michael Doyle has] now unsubscribed from this list, due to the condescending
&gt; attitude of some of the list members.

I see from the archives that his first post was "newbie", sent on
9 Dec 1998; and his last was "Netscape-Communicator v4.5", posted
today (10 Feb 1999).  In this time he has asked many questions,
most of which were already answered in the extensive documentation.
He is a newbie and so this is to be expected.  What I don't understand
is the "condescending attitude" he apparently complained of.  After
spending a bit of time searching, I could find not one example of
a condescending attitude directed at him; not even from me, and
I'm quick to tell idiots and lazy swine that they are idiots and
lazy swine! :-)  I suppose he must have unsubscribed from the list
because he felt outraged by the condescending attitude directed
towards others?  *shrug*  A bit too sensitive, IMSO.
