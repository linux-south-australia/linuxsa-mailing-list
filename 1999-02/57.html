Hi,
Daniel replied to this email before I got in, and basically I agree with
his views and just would like to add a bit more of my own.

!&gt;their level.

Innocent?? When they ignore repeated emails politely requesting them to
rein in their irresponsible dial-up users. I think they also don't know
what they are doing and couldn't care less (as long as the money rolls
in).

And Daniel replied:
!Hey, don't get me wrong here. I'm not advocating the practice of
!indiscriminate bombing of any/all attempted attackers. I said 
!"possibly" and "the more persistent ones" in that post, meaning the
!bastards who continue to try and try again OR who
!do a 2000-port mscan on your box OR who get annoyed that it didn't work and
!decide to throw Teardrops and DoS attacks your way.

Neither am I. I said I was pushed to the point of contemplating such
actions. But I have never returned any scanning/nuking/flooding....yet.

I mean it's like someone banging on the doors and windows of your house
every night and you're not able to do anything about it.

!Your absolutely, right in that they _usually_ check and move on as soon as 
!they see that you have your security in order.

Yes, that's what they normally do, but I do get a few that run on
Energizer batteries and keep repeating their scans. 
Just this morning, I had a bunny who left a ~300 line 'refused connect'
message in the log file and even more lines in the log file of a web
server.

!I have never bombed a SERVER that was responsible for a scan, just contacted
!the sysadmins about it. However, I have been forced to do it to dialup
!linux boxes or icmp flood the odd Windoze dialup ONLY WHEN it was
!about to cause real problems at my end (mail servers don't perform too
!well during a 2hr mscan).

The real culprits are those using dial-up lines as they think they are
anonymous. This is not helped by lazy sysadmins who don't bother to
trace the culprits and apprehend them. With just about every Tom, Dick
and Harry, (and Jane too) having easy and cheap access to the 'Net and
with scripts easily available, this problems are on the increase. 

!&gt;Just because someone uses linux to do those activities only makes them
!&gt;an intelligent weenie, instead of a windoze weenie. If you are going to
!&gt;hack, at least do it yourself and try and find some new methods....Read
!&gt;source code, look for openings, and experiment. Maybe you'll find a way
!&gt;in. You can enjoy yourself for a while taking advantage of it. Then,

!This is exactly what I would be doing IF I was fulltime security expert.
!But I'm not, I'm just trying to maintain an ISP network with a few thousand
!users on it (who are less than sympathetic to mailserver downtimes).

It saddens me to see some kids installing Linux not to learn about a
great OS but to have a platform to compile kiddie scripts and annoy
others. 

!Anyway, I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything, we're all
!on the same side here. I just didn't want anyone thinking that I'm
!suggesting extreme tactics for low-level attacks, as I'm not.

Agreed. Let's consider this thread closed and get the asbestos suits
off :-)

Cheers,
