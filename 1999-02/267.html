<H1>Redhat 5.2:Sound problem</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
Hi,

First of all thanks to Murray Tippett for his assistance . Thanks to his
help and Powequest Partition Magic 4 I now have both Redhat 5.2 and
Caldera's Open Linux 1.2  up and running in the one partition  for
evaluation purposes. The aforementioned's partitioning  and boot
programs really did make my life a lot easier (for a novice that is !).

I have one problem ,though, and that is to get my XPlayCD 2.1 up and
working as  "user" in Redhat. It works OK at root. Is this a permission
problem?
If it is I have a problem knowing which file permission to change. I've
tried changing permissions for /etc/rc.d/init.d/sound and
/var/lock/subsys/sound as these were the only two sound files the "Find"
utility came up with but  without success. I've also tried to su to root
but I don't know the console command for starting XPlay if in fact that
is a valid approach.?

Could I please have some help on this problem.

Thank You

Brenton Pettitt
