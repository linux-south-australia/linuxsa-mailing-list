&gt; Hi all,

Hi :)


&gt; I know a lot of people out there are using new ATX systems
&gt; with socket seven chips (K6-2 etc) 

I am indeed...

&gt; and I was wondering if

.. yes...

&gt; there was any interest in getting in some socket 7 size fans
&gt; that use power off the motherboard as opposed to the old AT style
&gt; that use a 5" type power connector. These fans are better
&gt; because they can be controlled by software via the motherboard,
&gt; neater (short thin cable to MB not power supply) will generate
&gt; an alarm if stops spinning, etc...

ooooo

I'll have one please.  In this hot weather we've had lately I've actually
had my computer slow to half speed and start beeping at me.. it took me a
while to figure out what was happening, but it turned out to be
overheating.  An extra fan would be -most- helpful.
 
&gt; They can also be used without a heatsink as an extra case fan
&gt; if plugged into the case-fan connector on the MB. Use it to
&gt; increase air flow, cool HDD etc.

Good idea.

&gt; I, as a HW supplier have had no luck finding them locally but I
&gt; may be able to get a few from a rather shonky importer interstate.
&gt; I was originally just going to get two in for myself but I though
&gt; that some people in the group may be interested. If anyone is
&gt; they can contact me privately.

Oh.

Well, the bit about my computer overheating may have been of interest to
the list.

&gt; I expect them to cost between $25-30 (this is cost price + shipping)
&gt; so they aren't exactly cheap but just remember, why should Intel
&gt; CPU's have all the fun.

Hear hear :)
