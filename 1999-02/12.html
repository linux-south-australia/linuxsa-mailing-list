I got one from some little edu server in Turkey last weekend ;-)

&gt;They are almost always similar. I usually post a 
&gt;snip of the log file to the maintainer of the offending server.
&gt;Sometimes I get an apology from him and an assuarance that the
&gt;particular user has been dealt with. But the attacks seem to be
&gt;getting common and it's getting to the point of annoyance. 
&gt;The eg. here is from an academic institution in Korea. Apologies for the
&gt;formatting.

&gt;host=staphy.korea.ac.kr/163.152.40.140 use

&gt;host=staphy.korea.ac.kr/163.152.40.140
&gt; use of gateway (V2.0beta)

It looks enough like an mscan but without quoting the ports
it is hitting, I can't be 100%.

&gt;Jan 26 13:57:13 zx http-gw[13023]: log
&gt;host=staphy.korea.ac.kr/163.152.40.140 pr
&gt;otocol=HTTP cmd=get dest=127.0.0.1:80 path=/cgi-bin/phf

However, this one makes it a little more obvious as I have never
had anyone actually just try a phf* attack (only when mscan does it
for them).

That's almost definately an mscan attack.
Unfortunately, I don't have much to suggest other than to keep
reporting them to their sysadmins and possibly retaliate with the
more persisitent ones (Ping Flood or boink/winnuke them till they stop the
scan,
lose their connection or get a BSOD/crash on their machine).
