Subject: Refund Day: Toshiba bites back.


&gt;Well I think we let ourselves down on this one.


  As long as Australians are prepared to WATCH
  rather than act, the status quo will rule.

  Unless one insists on Value-For-Money,
  there will be less than optimal VFM here.

  By the way, one day - while comparing Toshiba
  offerings in USA to local ones, for equiv. model,
  I could not help but notice that the US deal (from
  Toshiba directly) included LOTS of Software AND
  a 56 Kbps modem for LESS $'s than the .au price.

  Sit and accept... this will continue...

  Let 'em know you'll accept nothing less than world best
  and you'll get more Value-for-Money than you get today

  The choice is still yours:  Buying Power, Use it or Lose It!

  I wish I had purchased a computer recently,
  so that I could be at least ONE other local
  to be in a position to shake MS for a refund.

  I *did* once insist (quite successfully) that a
 Japanese company meet the US spec'n on
 a radio set (whose brochure - even in Aust. -
 depicted it coming with a much better micro-
 phone than I found in the box when I opened it.

 I was quick to inform other hams - e.g. in news-
 groups, et al. - but cannot say how many other
 locals followed my lead.
 
 No long paper-chase, BTW, just a couple of
 brief telephone conversations, leading to a
 letter from the Japanese manufacturer's agency
 (acknowleding their intention to supply the
 better microphone by way of exchange, upon
 receipt from Japan...) and - soon thereafter -
 the promised upgrade.

 I *did* make it quite clear that I fully intended
 to take the matter to consumer affairs, et al.
 i.e. if they did not live up to my (brochure-
 inspired expectations).  But only once...  ;)

 Perhaps Geoffrey's economic position gives
 him more time to haggle, write/send/post
 e-mail & FAX's than I have available to me.

 In any case, I would say that anyone with a
 newly purchased computer that included an
 unwanted operating system would be doing
 us all a big favour by making a formal com-
 plaint to ACCC, i.e. after hearing "no" from
 the supplier and/or Microsoft.

 In fact, I wish our "time-rich" GDB had gone
 this route instead, so all that time & paper-
 chasing would have benefitted more Aussies.

 As it is, the noteriety won by his chase for $110
 served only GDB's personal &/or business aims,
 not the (local) Linux community (to date)...

 (I would like to know the "$ per hour" result of
 his time/effor/cost investment in this project.)

 Don't read this wrong!  I *still* feel good that
 he did this and shared the story in such a com-
 prehensive manner, thus *enabling* others to
 follow his lead.

 Better, however, to apply such time & effort
 in such a way that others don't NEED to do
 this with each and every OEM that play it as
 Toshiba seems to have (i.e. requiring the
 refund-seeked to "escalate" the request all
 the way up the chain-of-command, until
 somebody at that level decides it's costing
 too much time to say No, or - in a place as
 small as Adelaide - perhaps just knows
 GDB's dad, et al. and OK's it...)

 Better if we consider the time EACH and
 EVERY schmuck has to expend to get that
 refund... and - instead - make tracks AT
 THE START - to ACCC (or whoever) to
 get them to chase Microsoft or any OEM's
 that don't want to play ball...

 Remember, kiddies, time spent chasing
 $110, or writing "I hate Micro$oft" on your
 web-site, for that matter... is time that OTHERS
 are using to create (or "Embrace & Extend")
 technologies...

 The choice is yours:  either join the creators
 or the mob that stands outside demonstrating
 against it... fortunately, there are creators in
 the Linux, et al. community... so, there are more
 than one community to be creative in!  ;)

 But I think it is good to get big bad gov't involved
 in the fight, especially now when competition is
 the go (except in SA, where Public Hospitals
 won't have to compete, I understand, between
 themselves in the near future... but SA is not
 the Real World, is it...?  ;)
