&gt; Perhaps you misunderstood what the CD Week CD is about?

I realise that in the _other_ operating system's world things don't come
free like that, but on the cover of CD Week Applixware is nicely tucked
between Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.02 for Linux and astime 1.6 -= both 'full
versions'.  Other titles on the CD include gtkgo and gxTar which are
OSS.  

CD Week is great in that it includes Linux software, what I now realise
and don't like is that Linux demo software is listed amongst 'full
versions'.

Perhaps I was a little gullible to think Applixware might have changed
it's policy and gone free for non-commercial use, but considering
WordPerfect's entry (and StarOffice's) in the market I thought such a
decision would eventually happen.

BTW, APC in _general_ have done marvelous things in the Linux world -
even allowing Geoffrey to write each month :-)  The pocketbook and this
month's APC which contains among other things Samba 2.0, Gnome 0.99.5
and KDE are excellent affordable resources.
