&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; As a new user this is my first attempt to install a package so I'm not
&gt; sure that I have got it right.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm trying to install Corel WorPerfect 8 in Redhat 5.2 but without
&gt; success.
&gt; 
&gt; The following is what I have done.
&gt; 
&gt; At root I have issued the command mount /dev/cdrom_/home/pets (my chosen
&gt; user directory) and get the message "/dev/cdrom is write
&gt; protected-mounting read only"
That's normal. The CDROM is read-only - you can't write data to a normal
CD. (CD recorders are an exception, and work differently anyway.) Thus,
linux marks the mount as readonly, so that you (and your programs) can
see that they will not be able to write to that mountpoint.
Don't worry about that, anyway.

&gt; 
&gt; A "df" indicates the mount to /home/pets is successful.
Good. EXCEPT, why are you mounting your CDROM in your home directory??
This may very well be the cause of your problem. Try mounting it either
in a subdirectory, like /home/pets/cdrom, or else under the /mnt/
hierachy. (eg /mnt/cdrom).
Then try installing again.. 
When you mount a filesystem in a directory, you only get what is on the
new filesystem - you DONT get both at once!

&gt; 
&gt; In Gnome I have granted "pets" super user equivalence.
I find that I run as a user who only has normal access like any other,
with the exception of sound and MSDOS filesystems. For installing
packages su is good enough for me. However, if you have got superuser
acess on pets, then I guess you do and that should be okay. You can
verify by typing 'groups' to see what you are in.
(including root I presume for superuser access).

&gt; Then as user /home/pets (verified with "pwd") I have used the Corel
&gt; command "./install.wp"
Umm. pwd is present working directory...Not current user. Any user could
cd /home/pets, and then pwd would report /home/pets. I think you are
trying to say that you know you are in the right directory when you run
the install program though.
However, see what I said above about not mounting CDS over the top of
your home directory.
&gt; 
&gt; I get the message "Error: The character install has failed"
What happens before this, if anything?
I mean, does it start installing, or ask any questions, or does it bomb
out straight away? 
&gt; 
&gt; Also when I unmount the cdrom I get the messages "umount: /dev/hdc not
&gt; found" and umount /home/pets:not mounted" yet when I "df" the /home/pets
&gt; mount has been removed???
Try doing umount /home/pets (or whereever it's mounted) first, then df.
I  presume that your cdrom is a link to /dev/hdc then? (secondary IDE
master).

&gt; Could I kindly have some help on these problems please.

&gt; Thank you
&gt;
