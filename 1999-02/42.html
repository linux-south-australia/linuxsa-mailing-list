&gt;hi..we have a hdd with / nearly full....(78%) capacity, which is a pain
&gt;when installing staroffice..ie, we cant. we allocated 106 mb to it,
&gt;after reading the red hat install book,
&gt;but now, after installing kde (which we love), it is nearly full, so how
&gt;do i move the kde default dirs,(/opt/kde), to /usr/opt/kde/, without
&gt;having to reinstall?
&gt;
&gt;this is one of the probs i have found with rpm installs..little path
&gt;control...(when done through graphics managers, such as kpackage or
&gt;glint)

You shouldn't change the paths that programmes install to. They are the way
they are becuase many many people have come before you and worked out the
best way to do it.

What I would suggest is not havein /opt off the root. You can either
install a new disk and tar up /opt, move it over to the new disk and edit
/etc/fstab to sho that /opt is now on a new drive, OR you could even move
the stuff to /usr (sounds like you have more space there) and make /opt a
symbolic link to /usr/opt.

&gt;i am starting to look for .tgz files in preference now:)

rpm's are lovely. They're even better if you get into the habit of using
'rpm' and trying a few of the many options.

The best rule I've found is don't change things that aren't broken. /opt
exists for a reason and you're going to break many things by moving it to
/usr. If kDE was meant to go into /usr/something it would be there now!

Cheers

Alex!
