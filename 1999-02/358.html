&gt; The problem there is that 99% of people who buy
&gt; computers with win95 don't know
&gt; a) What an O/S is.
&gt; b) What the difference between an O/S and a computer
&gt; is.
&gt; c) Wouldn't know what to say when asked : 'Do you have
&gt; an O/S of preference?'.

Yeah.... there's this idea that Linux is going to be everyone's O/S one day.  I
don't believe it for a minute.  It's great for servers and technically minded
users, but not really suited to anyone else.  [KDE etc... are turning it into a
quite nice simple GUI though].

The Linux community get's pretty excited that MS thinks of them as a 'potential
threat' in the Halloween documents... but of course... they're trying to look
like they don't have a monopoly at the moment. [Even mighty RedHat is a tiny tiny
company by anyone's standards].

&gt; &gt; How many people have _never_ booted Windows on their machines anyway?  If
&gt; &gt; refund day had been constructed as a general protest rather than an attempt
&gt; &gt; to get refunds, then a lot of people would have felt more comfortable
&gt; &gt; participating.
&gt;
&gt; I would love to take the filth of my machine. I will
&gt; when BeOS comes out. It's going to be multimedia magic.

Yeah, BeOS _might_ be a real option, but they get more and more modest about what
the system can do as time goes on.  [Funky threading model... not much else].
