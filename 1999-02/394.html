&gt; More to the point at hand, how do we get people to
&gt; make more waves when:
&gt; 
&gt; - ACCC "says" the laws it enforces would
&gt;    not preclude OEM's from including a par-
&gt;    ticular operating system with each computer,
&gt;    even when the Buyer has indicated a preference
&gt;    for quite another legitimately licensed replacement?

To demand that OEMs sell computers without Windows would seem like
demanding that the corner deli. sell a flan without custard.  Sure
you might not like custard, and there would be many people who
would agree with you that coconut creme is nicer; but they only
stock flans with custard and if you don't like it you can lump it
(pardon the pun.)  You don't have to buy a flan from them if you
don't want.  How could you expect ACCC to start dictating what
stock computer OEMs and resellers should carry?

As it happens, many corner delis. *do* stock plain flans; and many
computer shops are quite happy to sell you a computer without
Windows.  If you ask they might even sell you one with Linux.


&gt; Ask yourself:  Do we do enough?

I ask myself: Why weren't you demanding a Windows refund?
(What applies to you might apply to others.)


&gt; The Berlin Wall is down... Swiss banks are return-
&gt; ing money to its original owners... etc. etc. etc. all
&gt; because people would not take No for an answer.

I do not think the people who refused No as an answer gathered
support by wailing about the apathy of the masses.  I'm sure
that would be a less than optimum strategy to garner support.
