Darryl,

What is your problem?  You sent a message to the list, complaining
that I make you pay for delivery of crap that most people aren't
interested in.  It's a bit hypocritical to send your (unwarranted)
gripe to the list, don't you agree?  A private message to Mark and
me would have shown consistency.

It irks me that you have the gall to think you can say what people
are or are not interested in.  That is such cheek.  I also observe
that "the others" were talking about posting of a DOS or Windows
binary, and not about toilettes.  I suspect you chose to complain,
not because you had a problem with what I wrote, but because you
have a problem with me in general.  If I'm correct then perhaps
you might show some integrity, as well as courtesy, and conduct
your complaint, in private, and with me.

While obviously a comment about the inventor of the toilette (and
the presumably unanticipated effect it had on his family name) is
totally incongruent with the direct charter of this list, none the
less the hidden charter is to form a community, and as such humour
is entirely appropriate.  If you think one or two messages is too
much, if you don't want to pay for it, nobody is keeping you here;
you're free to go at any time.

David
