&gt; Yeah.... there's this idea that Linux is going to be everyone's O/S one day.  I
&gt; don't believe it for a minute.  It's great for servers and technically minded
&gt; users, but not really suited to anyone else.  [KDE etc... are turning it into a
&gt; quite nice simple GUI though].
&gt; 
I agree. Giving a normal John Smith user (2.3 kids, dog called Bingo)
Linux is like giving somebody a swiss army knife to slice bread. A swiss
army knife that you have to log in to, cope with glibc/libc issues, and
deal with "Don't do that then" and "RTFM" elitism to get help for.

On the other hand, giving John Smith Windows 9x is paramount to saying
"Hi. You're stupid. Windows knows this and will both insult you and make
your look stupider.".

The average user should neither have to deal with Linux issues they know
nothing about or Certain Operating Systems From Redmond which assume that
they are total idiots and crash at unfortunate times. I'm hoping and
praying that BeOS will be the tradeoff between complexity and so called
"User Friendliness".

Linux could be a good solution for secretarial and workstation stuff,
mainly because the tasks being completed are limited and there will
probably be somebody cluey around if something goes wrong. Whereas if
something in Windows goes wrong, even said cluey person will have a hard
time, because Windows has problems actually -telling- you what went wrong,
in the name of User Friendliness (ie, the user has better things to worry
about than technical details). I'd like Windows much more if it had
a --verbose or --debug option :)

Oh well, we can't have everything :)

&lt;/rant&gt;

Michael.
