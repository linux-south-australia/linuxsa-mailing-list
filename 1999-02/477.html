Hi,

&gt;Howdy,
&gt;
&gt;	I have also experienced this problem.  I realise that if browsing with
&gt;SAMBA didn't work with Win98 someone would know by now, so it is probably a
&gt;simple configuration issue somehwere in the smb.conf.  However, I have
&gt;experienced the problem and while I was taking a look at it I found some
&gt;interesting stuff.  The problem was even though you open up all the security
&gt;in your smb.conf your Win98 and NT4 boxes continue to ask for passwords and
&gt;even if you correctly enter the password, still no go.  However on a Win95
&gt;OSR2 machine it works...
&gt;and here is what I found:
&gt;
&gt;I am using a straight off the CD not fiddled with redhat 5.2, I have not
&gt;edited the smb.conf file and am using the '\\server\username' share.
&gt;
&gt;A packet filter between the Win95 OSR2 machine reveals the order of events:
&gt;
&gt;Win95 box sends NBT session request
&gt;Samba sends positive session responce
&gt;Win95 box lists the Dialects it is able to speak (0-5)and says it would like
&gt;NT LM 0.12 (No.5)
&gt;Samba accepts and selects dialect 5 (NT LM 0.12)
&gt;Win95 sends session setup with username and password in CLEARTEXT!
&gt;All sorts of things happen now Tree connects and filsystem info packets..
&gt;and the connection is successful
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The same situation, same untouched server.. but with win98
&gt;
&gt;Win98 box sends NBT session request
&gt;Samba sends positive session responce
&gt;Win98 box lists the Dialects it is able to speak (0-5)and says it would like
&gt;NT LM 0.12 (No.5)
&gt;Samba accepts and selects dialect 5 (NT LM 0.12)
&gt;Win98 sends session setup with username but at the same position where the
&gt;CLEARTEXT PASSWORD was in the Win95 frame now is just "USERNAME DOMAIN"
&gt;
&gt;I assume this so that samba can initiate validating the user's domain
&gt;security token with the PDC.
&gt;Even though the USERNAME and DOMAIN details are correct and the password for
&gt;the account is the same on the PDC as it is on the Linux box the session
&gt;still fails.

By default, Windows NT sp3 (I think) and Win 98 send encrypted passwords,
or don't like plaintext passwords. There is a registry setting to have them
send plaintext passwords again. Look in /usr/doc/samba/docs for some
registry setting files.

Alternatively, implement encrypted passwords on your Samba server.

&gt;Im thinking that you probably need to mess about with the new settings in
&gt;Samba that deal with making validations via a NT PDC, or perhaps turning
&gt;DOMAIN validation off on the Win98 client.
&gt;
&gt;NT4 sessions to samba in this way also fail with a similar packet structure,
&gt;and the error is returned on the NT4 client - "The account is not authorized
&gt;to log in from this station"
&gt;
&gt;The fact that OSR2 sends cleartext to Samba is fairly interesting! But what
&gt;more would you expect.

&gt;&gt; Subject: sharing via samba
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my
&gt;&gt; computers. As the
&gt;&gt; subject suggests, I'm having problems trying to share via samba.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The problem is as follows:
&gt;&gt; On my win98 box, i go to network neighborhood and the Linux
&gt;&gt; box's netbios
&gt;&gt; name is listed. I try to open it, but it asks me for a
&gt;&gt; password. I would
&gt;&gt; like to make it so you don't need any password and doesn't
&gt;&gt; even ask you for
&gt;&gt; any, like sharing via Win98, but I don't know how to do this.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; In the smb.conf file, I have the line "guest account =
&gt;&gt; guest". On my Win98
&gt;&gt; box, the login name is pii. I added the users pii and guest
&gt;&gt; on the linux
&gt;&gt; box, and made the password the same. When i am prompted for
&gt;&gt; the password, I
&gt;&gt; first tried just pressing enter, hoping it would be no
&gt;&gt; password (and use the
&gt;&gt; guest account), but it told me the password is incorrect. I
&gt;&gt; tried entering
&gt;&gt; the password that I set as pii's and guest's password, but that says
&gt;&gt; password incorrect. What have I done wrong?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Thanks,
&gt;&gt; Andy
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; PS. I recieved one e-mail from someone asking me to mail them with any
&gt;&gt; success from the questions from the e-mail called "a few
&gt;&gt; things". Well, i
&gt;&gt; stupidly lost the e-mail address, so I don't know who to
&gt;&gt; reply to. to that
&gt;&gt; person and anyone interested: I am keeping a web page (at
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~zivkotech/bilisili/linux/">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~zivkotech/bilisili/linux/</A> ) with details of
&gt;&gt; everything I achive in linux. You can look at that for how I
&gt;&gt; 'fixed' the
&gt;&gt; 'problems', or e-mail me again and I promise not to lose your
&gt;&gt; e-mail address
&gt;&gt; again ;)
