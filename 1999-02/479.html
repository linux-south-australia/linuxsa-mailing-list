RH 5.2 upgrades to 2.2.x pretty easily I believe.
There are some RPMs to do it for you, I forget the url, but I saw it on
slashdot.org, and if you look back on the LinuxSA list, it's probably
there too.

The only trouble I have had in going from 2.0.x to 2.1.x/2.2.x on my
home machine is that smbmount has been broken. I suspect I need a newer
samba version, and I downloaded samba 2.0.2 last night, and I will see
if the newer smbmount in there fixes anything.
(Has anyone else had this problem, and how did they fix it?)

I started using 2.1.x kernels a while ago, and upgraded various parts of
the system to work with it at the time, so if you can run a late 2.1.x
kernel, a 2.2.x kernel won't really require anything new at all.

The main things that come to mind in upgrading from 2.0.x to 2.1.x/2.2.x
would be the pppd, and ipchains replacing ipfwadm.

&gt; Hey All,
&gt; 
&gt; Just a couple of quick little questions about upgrading the kernel in my
&gt; server. I want to know what sort of difficulties I might run into.
&gt; 
&gt; After attending the tutorial run last night by Paul, he told me about an
&gt; icq_masq module, which I went and downloaded, but found out it needs kernel
&gt; 2.2.x and my server is only a Redhat 5.2 machine, which runs kernel 2.0.36.
&gt; The server only runs DNS, WWW, FTP and email for my domain, as well as
&gt; masquerading for my other machines on the LAN behind the server.
&gt; 
&gt; Will I run into any problems if I upgrade the kernel to 2.2.1? Will anything
&gt; break? I don't use the machine for anything else, only the Internet services
&gt; I listed above. The machine sits under one of my desks with no monitor and
&gt; no keyboard etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have anything to worry about? I do know I'll need to upgrade from
&gt; ipfwadm to ipchains for the new kernel, but that's no problem, with all the
&gt; help we received last night at the tutorial. By the way, those of you who
&gt; didn't go last night missed out on a first class night :)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, and TIA everyone
&gt; Dazz
