&gt; Just for the record, I'd like to say I've had a lot of trouble with some

&gt; Maybe I'm just unlucky, so don't sue me, but I wouldn't reccommend a
&gt; Discovery to anyone. They're very cheap, but there's a reason for
&gt; that....

if you have a look, discovery modems are just a generic modem that has
been put onto the australian market, go and have a look at KTX and
Discovery and Genius internal modems, not to mention some other brands,
they are all identical exactly the same board, chips, everything, u cant
tell them apart (isa internal im refering to) discovery arnt just cheaper
than other brands, its just that some adelaide isps (wantree) recomend
them to their clients so people go for them in preference to the other
cheap brands..
oh and point of note, dont get a pci modem at all, i think it was covered
in earlier emails about that tho, cant rememebr, but they are dodgy even
in windoze..
