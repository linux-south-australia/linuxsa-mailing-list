&gt; Here's a short list of topics which I think would be suitable
&gt; topics for future linuxSA seminars:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.      Electronic commerce (how to set up e-commerce for a web site
&gt;         using linux).
BTDT, but it'd be good to teach more people how, so they don't get
tempted to go n buy an off the shelf NT package. *shudder*

&gt; 2.      Device drivers (how to get started writing device drivers software
&gt;         under linux).
Definately interested.
Anyone want to run a course on reverse engineering drivers from other
(non-open-source) Unices though? ;)

&gt; 
&gt; 3.      Internet API programming (how to write one's own software
&gt;         to communicate with TCP/IP and UDP/IP sockets).

&gt; 
&gt; 4.      X window system programming (summary of styles of X window
&gt;         system available with linux, and APIs, GUIs etc. for
&gt;         programming them).

&gt; 
&gt; 5.      Mini-Perl course, especially for CGI scripts.
&gt; 
&gt; 6.      TCL/TK introduction.

&gt; 
&gt; 7.      ext2 file system intro (i-nodes, hard links, directories etc.)
Yep, I'd like to know how it all fits together. Makes it easier to fix
when it goes wrong, too.
I've got a 2Gb drive that my main Linux box (at home, not at work) runs
off, of which most of the first 1gb has hundreds of bad sectors
scattered over it. (I do mean hundreds!) I originally ran badblocks over
the drive a few times before installing Linux, and since then only one
more block has turned up that has caused anything to go wrong..and it
recovered fine. Running linux on this hdd was originally a 'I wonder if
this'll work' thing, but now it's been there for months and I'd kinda
forgotten about the state the drive was in.

However, I've got a #123456 file in /lost+found now, and it was
originally set ?---------, and I'm wondering what I can do with this
file. I can't cat the file, I get an I/O error. (Even if chmod +r).

So, I'm guessing this file is like a lost cluster in a DOS system, but
how do I explain to the FS that it's a file or a directory or whatever?
How can i view it?
I tried using debugfs, but didnt really know what I was doing, and didnt
want to find out the hard way on a live, unbackedup system.

&gt; 
&gt; Is there a form somewhere where people can submit
&gt; topics for seminars, and view what other people have submitted?
&gt; Could this be done in PHP?
&gt; Will skippy find true love?
Only time will tell.

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
