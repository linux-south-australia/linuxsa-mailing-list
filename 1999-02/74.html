You're taking a comment about a modem personally?

 &gt; I submitted my comment to help with this problem because I had a
 &gt; similar problem  with this type of modem. Your comment does nothing to
 &gt; solve the problem in the terms it is written rather is seems to be "do
 &gt; not dare seek to add anything to solving the problem".

If you've been reading this list for any great period of time, you
will have seen case after case where people have been having modem
problems and the solution has been to junk the cheap-and-nasty $80
special and replace it with a real modem.  Examples that spring to
mind from just the last fortnight are Alan Kennington's PPP link
(which froze unpredictably until he tossed his rotten EISA internal
modem) and a couple of questions about WinModems (which are
bottom-dollar pieces of crap sold by companies which have been
sucked-in by Microsoft's marketting and which only work under
Windows).

During those threads many other people have chimed in with similar
comments: They've bought a modem, something hasn't worked, they've
concluded that if you buy a cheap modem you get what you pay for, they
send it back, and then they get a better one and never worry about the
problem again.  I can say with extreme confidence that the most common
cause of modem problems is cheap-and-nasty equipment, not
configuration or user-error.  Believe it or not, most modem brands are
even less reliable than Win95, it's just that when modem firmware
crashes you don't get a blue screen, you just get a lockup or a dropped
call.

Thus, under the circumstances, I don't think my comment is out of
line.  The problem described is a direct result of the modem
manufacturer using a budget-priced or poorly-programmed DSP instead of
the equivalent equipment from Rockwell or (the now departed) Hayes.
As you point out, ATX3 is a (non-standard) work-around which disables
the DSP routine which fails to detect the dial tone, but even with
that workaround in place it's likely that the modem will exhibit other
problems which have precisely the same cause if you try to use it for
any significant period of time (e.g.: on a permanent net link), or
even for normal dialup use (you're just less likely to notice then).

How do I know this?  Because I've seen it time and time again.  I've 
been diagnosing modem problems since Linus Torvalds was a freshman.

On the other side of the coin, against your assertion that I don't
dare suggest anything which will solve the problem I present the other
messages I've sent over the last 24 hours:

  - How to move /opt using a "tar" and a pipeline to avoid running
    out of disk on congested systems;

  - An addition to another poster's suggestion about a symlink which
    demonstrated how to perform the above action while providing a 
    back-out path in the unlikely event that something doesn't work;

  - Off-list mail to Richard Sharpe re: TCP/UDP port address space
    and interactions (or lack thereof) between TCP and UDP ports;

  - An off-list 8 message long back-and-forth discussion with Alan
    Kennington re: portscan attacks (feel free to verify these last
    two with the people involved if you're small minded enough to 
    cast doubt on my claims);

  - Grabbing X screens with xv (someone else said it isn't possible.
    it is); and

  - Grabbing X screens with xwd, and creating EPS with xwud.

Given the fact that the vast majority of those messages over the last
24 hours have flown right past your eyes, your criticism seems
unfounded.  If out of that list the only thing you can point out is
that I (to use your words) "not dare seek to add anything to solving
the problem" then I must respectfully ask you to reconsider your
position.  If that isn't enough for you, maybe I can resend all the
messages I've sent over the last week instead.  Or the last month.
Or the last year.

Translation:  Pull your head in.  In accusing me of adding nothing
useful you're actually adding nothing useful yourself.

Have a nice day.

    - mark
