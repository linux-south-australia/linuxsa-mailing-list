LINUXWORLD CONFERENCE & EXPO ’99 EXHIBITORS ANNOUNCE EXCITING NEW PRODUCTS

              Exhibit Floor Growing at Unprecedented Numbers


FRAMINGHAM, MA, (February 1, 1999) - -  IDG World Expo announced today that
major industry leaders and key Linux influencers will be making significant
industry news announcements to be unveiled at the upcoming LinuxWorld
Conference & Expo, March 1 – 4, 1999 at the San Jose Convention Center in
San Jose, CA.  Due to the overwhelming demand from exhibitors, attendees,
press, analysts and industry influencers, IDG World Expo has expanded the
exhibit floor!

With over 100 exhibitors demonstrating up-to-date technological and
marketplace information about the industry, LinuxWorld Conference & Expo
offers the Linux community the most comprehensive showcase of real-world
applications and technologies that are scalable, stable, and improve
productivity.

 “Linux is receiving a great amount of attention and enthusiasm. Linux
continues to gain incredible momentum as a popular technology in both the
academic and corporate worlds,” says Charles Greco, president, IDG World
Expo. “We have key Linux industry players exhibiting products, services and
offerings including Linux installation and distribution packages,
commercial and desktop productivity applications, products designed to
resolve Year 2000 limitations and new, definitive books titles on Linux and
other open source software.”

“The rapid commercial growth of Linux during the past six months is
reminiscent of the Internet's “overnight” transformation from an obscure
networking technology into a major industry force. LinuxWorld Conference &
Expo is perfectly timed to help people understand the far-reaching
ramifications of this advancing operating system and the open source
development model that spawned it,” says Dwight Davis, Service Director,
Summit Strategies, Inc.

LinuxWorld Conference & Expo will enable attendees to view products such as
automatic package updating systems, relational SQL databases, network
management software, custom designed rack mount chasses, Linux knowledge
base and mail servers on the Internet. Along with version control systems,
network analysis software, tools for running Linux desktop applications,
mobile database solutions and software configuration management system.

IDG’s LinuxWorld Conference & Expo, sponsored by LinuxWorld Magazine, Linux
Journal, Earthweb’s Developer.com, InfoWorld, Macworld, Network World and
Sys Admin is expected to draw over 8,000 independent and corporate Linux
developers and business professionals. For additional information visit the
show’s Web site at www.linuxworldexpo.com.  Here you will also learn more
