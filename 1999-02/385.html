&gt;  Perhaps Geoffrey's economic position gives
&gt;  him more time to haggle, write/send/post
&gt;  e-mail & FAX's than I have available to me.

I thought it was important to do; I made time for it.

&gt;  In any case, I would say that anyone with a
&gt;  newly purchased computer that included an
&gt;  unwanted operating system would be doing
&gt;  us all a big favour by making a formal com-
&gt;  plaint to ACCC, i.e. after hearing "no" from
&gt;  the supplier and/or Microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt;  In fact, I wish our "time-rich" GDB had gone
&gt;  this route instead, so all that time & paper-
&gt;  chasing would have benefitted more Aussies.

If you read my saga, you'd notice that I did contact the ACCC, and
that they said there was nothing wrong with Toshiba selling a laptop
with Windows pre-loaded.

&gt;  As it is, the noteriety won by his chase for $110
&gt;  served only GDB's personal &/or business aims,
&gt;  not the (local) Linux community (to date)...

Oh??

&gt;&gt; "Since Geoffrey decided to publish all the documents on the Web,
&gt;&gt; Toshiba has internal procedures in place to deal with people
&gt;&gt; seeking such refunds," said Lakin [Toshiba Australia managing
&gt;&gt; director].

I'd like to know what the "internal procedures" for "dealing with
customers" are, but that at first glance sounds like a good thing for
the Linux community, doesn't it?

&gt;  (I would like to know the "$ per hour" result of
&gt;  his time/effor/cost investment in this project.)

$0/hour (minus whatever costs were involved in pursuing the matter)
since I haven't cashed the cheque.  As I've said before, it was the
principle of the thing, not the money.

&gt;  Don't read this wrong!  I *still* feel good that
&gt;  he did this and shared the story in such a com-
&gt;  prehensive manner, thus *enabling* others to
&gt;  follow his lead.

Good :-).

&gt;  Better, however, to apply such time & effort
&gt;  in such a way that others don't NEED to do
&gt;  this with each and every OEM that play it as
&gt;  Toshiba seems to have (i.e. requiring the
&gt;  refund-seeked to "escalate" the request all
&gt;  the way up the chain-of-command, until
&gt;  somebody at that level decides it's costing
&gt;  too much time to say No
[...]

But if the ACCC says that the manufacturers are not doing anything
wrong (at least, until they refuse to honour the contract) then that
means you do need to chase every vendor that doesn't honour their
contract.
