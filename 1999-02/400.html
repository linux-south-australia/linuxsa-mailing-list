I have bought this and the version of KDE is 1.0 which is quite old now and
also it only has Netscape 4.06 for Linux as well as many of the kernel
update goodies being rather old.  Not that I'm moaning about it, It still
is great that APC is catering for us Linux users.

Subject:  march apc





letting everyone know that  march apc has the new kernel, as well as the
new kde, netscape 4.5, and heaps of other linux updates on the front
cover. to save precious bandwidth and dreary d/l times tis a major
help:) (and for $7.95, not bad:)  )

it also has articles on the new kernel, and a look at graphics on linux
(thank geoffrey bennett for that one!)

*rant alert*
also, a great look at women in the IT industry...as one getting her
degree in this field, and one of the seemingly even rarer female
linux/un*x users around, ( and a recent slashdot readers poll on the
gender of the readers had women at 3%), sometimes i feel a bit
outnumbered!
the odd thing is, i am busy converting everyone i know to linux..and a
greater percentage of women are interested, and all of them due to the
control they could have:)))
so many women regard linux as a male hacker o/s..(at least, among my
compatriots at uni, and friends in general), that it is great to
enlighten them!
my daughters prefer linux to windows too:)
*end rant*

back to apc - it is a pretty well mixed magazine for pc users....most of
the other mags have decided evreyone is a micro$loth user

romana:)

ps, and despite shaun's comments in the bg, i dont get a commission..but
hey, geoff, i am willing to discuss it? ;))))
