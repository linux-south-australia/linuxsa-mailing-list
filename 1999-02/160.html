&gt; 
&gt; CERT Advisory CA-99-02-Trojan-Horses
&gt; 
&gt;    Original issue date: February 5, 1999
&gt;    Last Revised:
&gt;    
&gt; Systems Affected
&gt; 
&gt;    Any system can be affected by Trojan horses.
&gt;    
&gt; Overview
&gt; 
&gt;    Over the past few weeks, we have received an increase in the number of
&gt;    incident reports related to Trojan horses. This advisory includes
&gt;    descriptions of some of those incidents (Section II), some general
&gt;    information about Trojan horses (Sections I and V), and advice for
&gt;    system and network administrators, end users, software developers, and
&gt;    distributors (Section III).
&gt;    
&gt;    Few software developers and distributors provide a strong means of
&gt;    authentication for software products. We encourage all software
&gt;    developers and distributors to do so. This means that until strong
&gt;    authentication of software is widely available, the problem of Trojan
&gt;    horses will persist. In the meantime, users and administrators are
&gt;    strongly encouraged to be aware of the risks as described in this
&gt;    document.
&gt;    
&gt; I. Description
&gt; 
&gt;    A Trojan horse is an "apparently useful program containing hidden
&gt;    functions that can exploit the privileges of the user [running the
&gt;    program], with a resulting security threat. A Trojan horse does things
&gt;    that the program user did not intend" [Summers].
&gt;    
&gt;    Trojan horses rely on users to install them, or they can be installed
&gt;    by intruders who have gained unauthorized access by other means. Then,
&gt;    an intruder attempting to subvert a system using a Trojan horse relies
&gt;    on other users running the Trojan horse to be successful.
&gt;    
&gt; II. Recent Incidents
&gt; 
&gt;    Incidents involving Trojan horses include the following:
&gt;    
&gt; False Upgrade to Internet Explorer
&gt; 
&gt;    Recent reports indicate wide distribution of an email message which
&gt;    claims to be a free upgrade to the Microsoft Internet Explorer web
&gt;    browser. However, we have confirmed with Microsoft that they do not
&gt;    provide patches or upgrades via electronic mail, although they do
&gt;    distribute security bulletins by electronic mail.
&gt;    
&gt;    The email message contains an attached executable program called
&gt;    Ie0199.exe. After installation, this program makes several
&gt;    modifications to the system and attempts to contact other remote
&gt;    systems.We have received conflicting information regarding the
&gt;    modifications made by the Trojan horse, which could be explained by
&gt;    the existence of multiple versions of the Trojan horse.
&gt;    
&gt;    At least one version of the Trojan horse is accompanied by a message
&gt;    which reads, in part:
&gt;    
&gt;      As an user of the Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft
&gt;      Corporation provides you with this upgrade for your web browser. It
&gt;      will fix some bugs found in your Internet Explorer. To install the
&gt;      upgrade, please save the attached file (ie0199.exe) in some folder
&gt;      and run it.
&gt;      
&gt;    The above message is not from Microsoft.
&gt;    
&gt;    We encourage you to refer to the Microsoft Internet Explorer web site
&gt;    at the following location:
&gt;    
&gt;      <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/security/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/security/default.asp</A>
&gt;      
&gt;    Please refer to the Section III below for general solutions to Trojan
&gt;    horses.
&gt;    
&gt; Trojan Horse Version of TCP Wrappers
&gt; 
&gt;    We recently published "CA-99-01-Trojan-TCP-Wrappers," which said that
&gt;    some copies of the source code for the TCP Wrappers tool were modified
&gt;    by an intruder and contain a Trojan horse. The advisory is available
&gt;    at the following location:
&gt;    
&gt;      <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-01-Trojan-TCP-Wrappers.html">http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-99-01-Trojan-TCP-Wrappers.html</A>
&gt;      
&gt; Trojan Horse Version of util-linux
&gt; 
&gt;    The util-linux distribution includes several essential utilities for
&gt;    linux systems. We have confirmed with the authors of util-linux that a
&gt;    Trojan horse was placed in the file util-linux-2.9g.tar.gz on at least
&gt;    one ftp server between January 22, 1999, and January 24, 1999. This
&gt;    Trojan horse could have been distributed to mirror FTP sites.
&gt;    
&gt;    Within the Trojan horse util-linux distribution the program /bin/login
&gt;    was modified. The modifications included code to send email to an
&gt;    intruder that contains the host name and uid of users logging in. The
&gt;    code was also modified to provide anyone with access to a login prompt
&gt;    the capability of executing commands based on their input at the login
&gt;    prompt. There were no other functional modifications made to to the
&gt;    Trojan horse util-linux distribution that we are aware of.
&gt;    
&gt;    A quick check to ensure you do not have the Trojan horse installed is
&gt;    to execute the following command
&gt;    
&gt;      $ strings /bin/login | grep "HELO"
&gt;      
&gt;    If that command returns the following output, then your machine has
&gt;    the Trojan horse version of util-linux-2.9g installed.
&gt;    
&gt;      HELO 127.0.0.1
&gt;      
&gt;    If the above command returns nothing, then you do not have this
&gt;    particular Trojan horse installed.
&gt;    
&gt;    You cannot rely on the modification date of the file
&gt;    util-linux-2.9g.tar.gz because the Trojan horse version has the same
&gt;    size and time stamp as the original version.
&gt;    
&gt;    In response to the distribution of this Trojan horse, the authors of
&gt;    util-linux have released util-linux-2.9h.tar.gz. This file is
&gt;    available via anonymous ftp from:
&gt;    
&gt;      <A HREF="ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.9h.tar">ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.9h.tar</A>
&gt;      .gz
&gt;      
&gt;    Be sure to download and verify the PGP signature as well:
&gt;    
&gt;      <A HREF="ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.9h.tar">ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/util-linux-2.9h.tar</A>
&gt;      .gz.sign
&gt;      
&gt;    This package can be verified with the "Linux Kernel Archives" PGP
&gt;    Public Key, available from the following URL:

&gt; Previous Trojan Horses
&gt; 
&gt;    Trojan horses are not new entities. A classic description of a Trojan
&gt;    horse is given in [Thompson]. Additionally, you may wish to review the
&gt;    following documents for background and historical information about
&gt;    Trojan horses.

&gt;      
&gt; III. Impact
&gt; 
&gt;    Trojan horses can do anything that the user executing the program has
&gt;    the privileges to do. This includes
&gt;      * deleting files that the user can delete
&gt;      * transmitting to the intruder any files that the user can read
&gt;      * changing any files the user can modify
&gt;      * installing other programs with the privileges of the user, such as
&gt;        programs that provide unauthorized network access
&gt;      * executing privilege-elevation attacks, that is the Trojan horse
&gt;        can attempt to exploit a vulnerability to increase the level of
&gt;        access beyond that of the user running the Trojan horse. If this
&gt;        is successful, the Trojan horse can operate with the increased
&gt;        privileges.
&gt;      * installing viruses
&gt;      * installing other Trojan horses
&gt;        
&gt;    If the user has administrative access to the operating system, the
&gt;    Trojan horse can do anything that an administrator can. The Unix
&gt;    'root' account, the Microsoft Windows NT 'administrator' account, or
&gt;    any user on a single-user operating system has administrative access
&gt;    to the operating system. If you use one of these accounts, or a
&gt;    single-user operating system (e.g., Windows 95 or MacOS), keep in mind
&gt;    the potential for increased impact of a Trojan horse.
&gt;    
&gt;    A compromise of any system on your network, including a compromise
&gt;    through Trojan horses, may have consequences for the other systems on
&gt;    your network. Particularly vulnerable are systems that transmit
&gt;    authentication material, such as passwords, over shared networks in
&gt;    cleartext or in a trivially encrypted form. This is very common. If a
&gt;    system on such a network is compromised via a Trojan horse (or another
&gt;    method) the intruder may be able to install a network sniffer and
&gt;    record usernames and passwords or other sensitive information as it
&gt;    traverses the network.
&gt;    
&gt;    Additionally, a Trojan horse, depending on the actions it takes, may
&gt;    implicate your site as the source of an attack and may expose your
&gt;    organization to liability.
&gt;    
&gt; IV. How Trojan Horses Are Installed
&gt; 
&gt;    Users can be tricked into installing Trojan horses by being enticed or
&gt;    frightened. For example, a Trojan horse might arrive in email
&gt;    described as a computer game. When the user receives the mail, they
&gt;    may be enticed by the description of the game to install it. Although
&gt;    it may in fact be a game, it may also be taking other action that is
&gt;    not readily apparent to the user, such as deleting files or mailing
&gt;    sensitive information to the attacker. As another example, an intruder
&gt;    may forge an advisory from a security organization, such as the CERT
&gt;    Coordination Center, that instructs system administrators to obtain
&gt;    and install a patch.
&gt;    
&gt;    Other forms of "social engineering" can be used to trick users into
&gt;    installing or running Trojan horses. For example, an intruder might
&gt;    telephone a system administrator and pose as a legitimate user of the
&gt;    system who needs assistance of some kind. The system administrator
&gt;    might then be tricked into running a program of the intruder's design.
&gt;    
&gt;    Software distribution sites can be compromised by intruders who
&gt;    replace legitimate versions of software with Trojan horse versions. If
&gt;    the distribution site is a central distribution site whose contents
&gt;    are mirrored by other distribution sites, the Trojan horse may be
&gt;    downloaded by many sites and spread quickly throughout the Internet
&gt;    community.
&gt;    
&gt;    Because the Domain Name System (DNS) does not provide strong
&gt;    authentication, users may be tricked into connecting to sites
&gt;    different that the ones they intend to connect to. This could be
&gt;    exploited by an intruder to cause users to download a Trojan horse, or
&gt;    to cause users to expose confidential information.
&gt;    
&gt;    Intruders may install Trojan horse versions of system utilities after
&gt;    they have compromised a system. Often, collections of Trojan horses
&gt;    are distributed in toolkits that an intruder can use to compromise a
&gt;    system and conceal their activity after the compromise, e.g., a
&gt;    toolkit might include a Trojan horse version of ls which does not list
&gt;    files owned by the intruder. Once an intruder has gained
&gt;    administrative access to your systems, it is very difficult to
&gt;    establish trust in it again without rebuilding the system from
&gt;    known-good software. For information on recovering after a compromise,
&gt;    please see
&gt;    
&gt;      <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html">http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/root_compromise.html</A>
&gt;      
&gt;    A Trojan horse may be inserted into a program by a compiler that is
&gt;    itself a Trojan horse. For more information about such an attack see
&gt;    [Thompson].
&gt;    
&gt;    Finally, a Trojan horse may simply be placed on a web siteto which the
&gt;    intruder entices victims. The Trojan horse may be in the form of a
&gt;    Java applet, JavaScript, ActiveX control, or other form of executable
&gt;    content.
&gt;    
&gt; V. Solutions
&gt; 
&gt;    The best advice with respect to Trojan horses is to avoid them in the
&gt;    first place.
&gt;      * System administrators (including the users of single-user systems)
&gt;        should take care to verify that every piece of software that is
&gt;        installed is from a trusted source and has not been modified in
&gt;        transit. When digital signatures are provided, users are
&gt;        encouraged to validate the signature (as well as validating the
&gt;        public key of the signer). When digital signatures are not
&gt;        available, you may wish to acquire software on tangible media such
&gt;        as CDs, which bear the manufacturer's logo. Of course, this is not
&gt;        foolproof either. Without a way to authenticate software, you may
&gt;        not be able to tell if a given piece of software is legitimate
&gt;        regardless of the distribution media.
&gt;      * We strongly encourage software developers and software
&gt;        distributors to use cryptographically strong validation for all
&gt;        software they produce or distribute. Any popular technique based
&gt;        on algorithms that are widely believed to be strong will provide
&gt;        users a strong tool to defeat Trojan horses.
&gt;      * Anyone who invests trust in digital signatures must also take care
&gt;        to validate any public keys that may be associated with the
&gt;        signature. It is not enough for code merely to be signed -- it
&gt;        must be signed by a trusted source.
&gt;      * Do not execute anything sent to you via unsolicited electronic
&gt;        mail.
&gt;      * Use caution when executing content such as Java applets,
&gt;        JavaScript, or Active X controls from web pages. You may wish to
&gt;        configure your browser to disable the automatic execution of web
&gt;        page content.
&gt;      * Apply the principle of least privilege in daily activity: do not
&gt;        retain or employ privileges that are not needed to accomplish a
&gt;        given task. For example, do not run with enhanced privilege, such
&gt;        as "root" or "administrator" for ordinary tasks such as reading
&gt;        email.
&gt;      * Install and configure a tool such as Tripwire® that will allow you
&gt;        to detect changes to system files in a cryptographically strong
&gt;        way. For more information about Tripwire®, see
&gt;        <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/ftp/tech_tips/security_tools">http://www.cert.org/ftp/tech_tips/security_tools</A>
&gt;        Note, however, that Tripwire® is not a foolproof guard against
&gt;        Trojan horses. For example, see
&gt;        <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/vul_notes/VN-98.02.kernel_mod.html">http://www.cert.org/vul_notes/VN-98.02.kernel_mod.html</A>
&gt;      * Educate your users regarding the danger of Trojan horses.
&gt;      * Use firewalls and virus products that are aware of popular Trojan
&gt;        horses. Although it is impossible to detect all possible Trojan
&gt;        horses using a firewall or virus product (because a Trojan horse
&gt;        can be arbitrary code), they may aid you in preventing many
&gt;        popular Trojan horses form affecting your systems.
&gt;      * Review the source code to any open source products you choose to
&gt;        install. Open source software has an advantage compared to
&gt;        proprietary software that the source code can be widely reviewed
&gt;        and any obvious Trojan horses will probably be discovered very
&gt;        quickly. However, open source software also tends to be developed
&gt;        by a wide variety of people with little or no central control.
&gt;        This makes it difficult to establish trust in a single entity.
&gt;        Keep in mind that reviewing source code may be impractical at
&gt;        best, and that some Trojan horses may not be evident from a review
&gt;        of the source as described in [Thompson].
&gt;      * Adopt the use of cryptographically strong mutual authentication
&gt;        systems such as ssh for terminal emulation, X.509 public key
&gt;        certificates in web servers, S/MIME or PGP for electronic mail,
&gt;        and kerberos for a variety of services. Avoid the use of systems
&gt;        that trust the domain name system for authentication, such as
&gt;        telnet, ordinary http (as opposed to https), ftp, or smtp unless
&gt;        your network is specifically designed to support that trust.
&gt;      * Do not rely on timestamps, file sizes, or other file attributes
&gt;        when trying to determine if a file contains a Trojan horse.
&gt;      * Exercise caution when downloading unauthenticated software. If you
&gt;        choose to install software that has not been signed by a trusted
&gt;        source, you may wish to wait for a period of time before
&gt;        installing it in order to see if a Trojan horse is discovered.
&gt;      * We encourage all security organizations to digitally sign any
&gt;        advisories or other alerts. We also recommend that users validate
&gt;        any signatures, and to beware of unsigned security advice. The
&gt;        CERT Coordination center signs all ASCII copies of our advisories
&gt;        with our PGP key, available at:
&gt;        <A HREF="http://www.cert.org/pgp/CERT_PGP.key">http://www.cert.org/pgp/CERT_PGP.key</A>
&gt;        
&gt;    If you do fall victim to a Trojan horse, some anti-virus software may
&gt;    also be able to recognize, remove and repair the damage from the
&gt;    Trojan horse. However, if an intruder gains access to your systems via
&gt;    a Trojan horse, it may be difficult or impossible to establish trust
&gt;    in your systems. In this case, we recommend that you disconnect from
&gt;    the network and rebuild your systems from known-good software being
&gt;    careful to apply all relevant patches and updates, to change all
&gt;    passwords, and to check other nearby systems. For information on how
&gt;    to rebuild a Unix system after a compromise, please see
