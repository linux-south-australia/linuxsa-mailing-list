Despite all the calls to arms, verbiage about how nobody ever does
enough, complaints about the status quo, and righteous anger at the
apathy of the common man, you still haven't produced "Chuckie 2000,"
the world's best carbon-fibre, electro-mechanical, computerized,
automatic, user-friendly, self-cleaning and sweet-smelling 450 MHz
toilet.  Companies like Caroma and Royal Doulton have a virtual
monopoly on the supply and production of bathroom plumbing and
sanitary products, and you steadfastly refuse to improve society by
building a better toilet even though it's common knowledge that it's a
Simple Matter of Engineering to produce a prototype toilet with a
built-in Pentium III processor which boots Quake from a FLASH card and
which travels at Mach 3, utilizing the patented "Turbo Vacuum Suck"
method to actually pull excrement out of the user's bowel to leave
them feeling clean, refreshed and hardly suffering from excruciating
pain at all (consumer warning: not suitable for small children or
pregnant women).

Where's "Chuckie 2000," man?  Do you do nought but sit on your laurels
criticizing people for never doing enough?  Are you a man?  Are you
immoral for acknowledging that the ability to improve society is
within your grasp but refusing to use it?  Do you not *want* the kind
of society where we can read our email on the crapper?  Don't you
think Rob Malda would put a net-connected toilet that ran The Gimp on
slashdot quicker than you could say, "My web server is haemorraging"?
Wouldn't it revolutionize the web if you could actually put crap web
sites in a toilet where they belong?  It'd bring a whole new meaning
to "cache flush," not to mention "core dump".

[ and, after all, I need somewhere to put all this shit... ]

I want a new toilet, and I demand that you build it for me!  Even
though you've never told me you'll build one, I'm going to hold you
personally responsible for not owning one and hound you mercilessly
until you release "Chuckie 2000"!

Ahem.  Enough toilet humor.

I'm building the world a better operating system, Chuckie -- See the
CVS commit logs for FreeBSD, particularly the contents of the
src/sys/svr4, src/sys/i386/linux, src/sys/i386/ibcs2, src/sys/kern and
src/sys/i386/svr4 directories (tip: Look for the username "newton" as
the person doing the cvs commits... who might that be?) and the home
page for one of my projects at <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/~newton/svr4">http://www.freebsd.org/~newton/svr4</A>, or
wait for the 4.0 release of the CDs to hit the presses later this
year.  If you think you can score a debating point by decrying my lack
of contribution to Open Source software, all you'll end up doing is
proving just how sadly misguided and misinformed you really are (and
always have been).  I mentioned this to you before, and the facts have
always been available to you, so I can only conclude that you're now
being *wilfully* ignorant.

So, I hope we can permanently put this "Newton 2000" garbage to rest.
On the other hand, what are *you* doing?  Where's my "Chuckie 2000"
killer toilet?

      [ this is the first time I've ever had to run around a building
        looking for brand names on toilets in order to compose an 
        email message... :-) ]
