Hi everyone,

Well I think we let ourselves down on this one.
This is a post that I received from a friend in the ACT.
I think the source of the article is an internal government
electronic newsletter.

I find it very interesting that Toshiba who have remained
silent choose now to get the boot in.

Refund day flops, as Aussie Linux lovers go missing
SYDNEY - "Maintain the rage" does not seem to be the motto of Linux
users, in Australia at least. Yesterday was "Windows Refund Day" for
Linux users round the world who claim they are outraged at having to buy
computers with Windows already installed. In the US, Japan and New
Zealand, plans were afoot to storm Microsoft offices with demands for
refunds.
But the hallowed turf of Microsoft Australia's North Ryde, Sydney
headquarters remained unstormed. Windows product manager Tony Wilkinson
reported a "no show" by Linux lovers demanding their money back.
Equally relieved was PC vendor Toshiba Australia, which set the whole
thing in motion last year by refunding $110 to Adelaide-based Linux user
Geoffrey Bennett. Bruce Lakin, GM of Toshiba's Information Systems
Division, says the company has received only one complaint since, and
that was last month.
He didn't say whether Toshiba paid off again - but he did level a blast
at Bennett for publishing details of his payout on the Internet,
according to APC magazine's Newswire site.
"I think it is the height of discourtesy for someone to publish what was
essentially private correspondence on a Web site for all the world to
see," said Lakin, according to APC. "It shows absolute disrespect for a
vendor which treated him with courtesy at all times. And if I ever met
him eyeball to eyeball, I'd tell him that."
Compaq Australia also reported all quiet on the Linux front.

I know that during the whole process I was not "treated with courtesy
at all times", but maybe that is because I was in the middle.
