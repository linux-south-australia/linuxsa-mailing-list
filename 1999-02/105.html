Hi, being new to linux Im obviously gonna make a few mistakes.  I tried to
follow the instructions for compiling a new kernel  and all seemed to go
well, I had to make bzImage because it said image was too big when i did a
make zImage.  after that i edited my lilo.conf file as per instructions and
got my boot loader to point to my new kernel and renamed the old one.

I rebooted and things looked great until I got this...

Partition Check:
     hda: hda1
     NTFS version 990102
     VFS cannot open root device 16:05
kernel panic: VFS: unable to mount root FS on 16:05



normally they should look Like this

Partition Check:
     hda: hda1
     hdc: [PTBL] 1023/64/63 hdc1 hdc2 &lt;hdc5 hdc6&gt;
and so on

what did I do wrong to get this message?

regards
