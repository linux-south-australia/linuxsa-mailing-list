If it gives you any hope, I think I was running something similar for a
while, only using samba and ncp...So maybe perservere for a while, read
the fine print, etc.
It might be that NFS is trying to lock files in some way that smb doesnt
support.

&gt; Hello everyone :)
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, I'd like to say just how much I enjoyed the dinner last night and
&gt; the Peacock .. place.. (err..) - the food was delicious and plentiful, and
&gt; many an interesting conversation could be heard.  Just like the mailing
&gt; list, but a lot faster :)  (One particular conversation I almost (almost)
&gt; took part in could quite easily have taken up several megabytes of e-mail
&gt; and many weeks to complete, so I am grateful ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Now to my problem...
&gt; 
&gt; Picture this.
&gt; 
&gt;   +----+
&gt;   | :( |  Windows 95 box, shared directories (file server)
&gt;   +----+
&gt; 
&gt;   +----+
&gt;   | :) |  My Linux box
&gt;   +----+
&gt; 
&gt;   +----+
&gt;   | :/ |  SysV UNIX (Supports -export- of SMB but no -import-)
&gt;   +----+
&gt; 
&gt; All are linked up via LAN and TCP/IP.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically:  I need to let SysV mount an SMB share in a directory on its
&gt; filesystem.  Why, you ask?  Backups, I reply.  Backups.
&gt; 
&gt; Easy!  Just mount the SMB shares in SysV using smbmount, because the rest
&gt; of the samba package is there, so why wouldn't smbmount be.
&gt; 
&gt; Well it's not.  There is currently (to my knowledge) no version of
&gt; smbmount for SysV systems.
&gt; 
&gt; SysV -will-, however, import NFS.
&gt; 
&gt; Windows 95 won't export it.
&gt; 
&gt; Bah.
&gt; 
&gt; "Easy, " I thinks to meself, "install Linux, mount the SMB share in
&gt; /mnt/windows or something, and export /mnt/windows as NFS.  Shouldn't be
&gt; a problem."
&gt; 
&gt; so...
&gt; 
&gt; LINUX$ smbmount //health/cdrive /mnt/windows/cdrive -c stubsy -n -I
&gt; 192.168.0.2
&gt; 
&gt; *ping* All done.  Beautiful.  Exciting.
&gt; 
&gt; /etc/exports:
&gt; 
&gt;   /mnt/windows   unixserver(ro)
&gt; 
&gt; Then on Mr SysV:
&gt; 
&gt; SYSV$ mount -F nfs stubsy:/mnt/windows /mnt/windows
&gt; 
&gt; *ping* All done.  Happy.  Skipping about.
&gt; 
&gt; SysV again:
&gt; 
&gt; SYSV$ ls -la /mnt/windows/cdrive
&gt; 
&gt; gives me an error about a stale NFS point when it tries to read "./."
&gt; (sorry - can't give you the exact message - it's at work, I am not - but
&gt; you get the idea).  Everything under LINUX$ /mnt/windows that's actually
&gt; on Linux's physical disk can be read without a hassle.
&gt; 
&gt; I am assuming that this is because stubsy:/mnt/windows is not really -on-
&gt; stubsy, it's sort of being shared twice.  Being highly naiive, I thought
&gt; it would work straight off, and it didn't.  *sobs*
&gt; 
&gt; So can anyone help me?  You'd be saving us about $2000 on a tape drive, or
&gt; me a headache from writing a script to use tar+gz+ftp to make a mess and
&gt; waste valuable disk space.
&gt; 
&gt; If you read this far through this e-mail, you're a beautiful person and
&gt; I'm grateful for your time and thought.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou most kindly :)
