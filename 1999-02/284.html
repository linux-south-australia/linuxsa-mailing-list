Remember that in linux, the shell does not automatically prepend . to
your path.
That is, when you try and run xaudio, the shell searches your path. If
you check, it's probably got /bin/:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin etc in it,
before it gets to ., if it has . in there at all. 
Try running ./xaudio and you may find that will behave more like you
expect.
You can try running 'which xaudio' which may tell you where it WAS
previously trying to execute xaudio from.
My guess is that there is a directory called xaudio that is hanging off
somewhere in your path, prior to your current directory.

The reason . is not automatically at the beginning of your path like it
is in DOS, is for security. Some user could create a program called 'ls'
and put it in his directory. Then, s/he says "if you want this elite
warez i've d/led to my shell, have a look in directory ~hacker/lame/"
You promptly do a cd ~hacker/lame, and run ls.
If you have . at the beginning of your path, then HIS ls will be run,
instead of the standard unix one. His ls will probably be a shell script
to copy /bin/bash to his ~/bin/bash.yourusername, and then make it suid
you. (because his script is running as you, it can do that of course.)
Then, it would run ls itself, and print the output, except neatly
removing the line showing that a program called ls is there!

Thus, as far as you can see, you just get a listing of some latest beta
of ICQ2000, and go back to your own directory and forget about it.
However, that user now has a suid you shell, which he can run and then
pretend he is you, and thus access all the pentagon nuclear missile
launch codes you'd hidden away there.

Anyway, that isnt neccessarily what someone would do, but uni students
got pretty creative at times, with various trojans of system commands,
etc.

&gt; I have recently installed the xaudio mp3 player onto my linux system,
&gt; but am getting a wierd error...
&gt; Linux tells me the executable is a directory when I try to run it, but
&gt; if I try to change to the directory it says it isnt a directory?

&gt; I downloaded it on an M$ 98lite machine and something wierd happened
&gt; with the file names, that is it became (?) a _tar.tar file that was
&gt; really a .tar.gz file.  I used gzip on it, then unpacked it with tar,
&gt; and no errors were reported, so I don't think thats the cause of the
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Its redhat 5.2 from the pocketbook cd, kernal 2.0.36
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
