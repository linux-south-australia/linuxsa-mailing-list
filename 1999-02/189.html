Nick,

I recently bought two Discovery modems, and then a WebExcel
-- all 33.6 k itnernal (EISA) modems.
I checked out the chips on the board and the capacitors etc.
The only difference was that the WebExcel had smaller size
capacitors (not necessarily smaller capacitance),
and had a version code C instead of B written on it.
But the "sticky buffer" problem was identical.
That is, the modem buffered up to 32 kbytes of date for
about 7 seconds out fo every 8.5 seconds.
During the 1.5 seconds of data relese between the modem
and the serial driver, the data rate was about 85-90 kbits/sec,
indicating that the buffer delay was not between the ISP and
my modem.

If anyone can verify that the Discovery/WebExcel modem
(EISA 33.6k) does in fact have 32 kBytes of buffer on the
board, I would most grateful.
This would clinch all of observations and
hypothesis formation.

Obviously, the casual dial-up user would not worry about
a problme that takes 3-10 days after  start-up to
manifest such a problem.
Therefore there is not reason for the average disl-up user
to avoid these modems.
It's only on a permanent connection that you notice
the problem.
The mechanism is probably a coding error on the
modem board, whereby interrupts are not
generated (IRQ 3 in my case), _OR_ the COM2 port
interferes with the IRQ3 somehow -- i.e. an
interrupt sharing problem.
Anyway, I don't have the time to completely diagnose it.
I already wasted about $2000-3000 of my time
on the problem.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
