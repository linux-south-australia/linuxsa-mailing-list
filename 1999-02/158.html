Question: does anyone know how to configure
XBF_i740 (XFree86 accelerated) for a videoExcel card?

I've just had a very frustrating several hours trying to
configure the XBF_i740 version of XFree86 for a friend's
computer.

She has the AGP card as follows:

videoExcel
3D PRO 740
AG 240
(Intel 740).

It all works fine with wind98, and now I want to get
it going with dual boot linux, to show off the virtues 
of linux. Unfortunately, the video card is a major pain
to get going. Not a good ad for linux! (No flames, please.)

With whatever configurations I set up with xf86config
(the new binary found on the site  with
the i740 X-server), or with Xconfigurator, or with manual
adjustments with "vi" to the XF86Config file,
I don't get the mouse to do anything at all.
No cursor appears, and the graphics are lopsided.

The tab-key does move the window focus to an xterm window, and
when I type in text, it does get read and acted upon.
But what is drawn on the screen when I type text is completely
garbled -- as if the bytes in a memory map are reversed
or somehting when the xterm window is scrolled.

Do you have any clues on what might be going wrong here?
What I really need is someone who has actually got linux going
with this brand of intel 740 AGP card.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
