Hi,

I spent some time trying those things from the e-mail thread which I called
"a few things". Firstly thanks to the people who replied, I got those thigns
working :)

BTW, I'm using RedHat 5.2, for the distribution specific things.

Anyway, about apache, Firstly, I tried making it so it wouldn't give web
pages to anyone outside my home LAN, but I had problems. First, I went
through /etc/httpd/conf/access.conf and looked for anything that could
accept or deny use. Under the &lt;directory /home/httpd/html&gt; part, there was
two lines that went as followed:

order allow,deny
allow from all

I changed it to:
order allow,deny
deny from all
allow from 10.0.1.2

Obviously, I use the 10.0.1.* subnet at home, and all worked well, until I
tried to get directory. That's probably not the right term, so what I mean
is, everyone, except 10.0.1.2 was told they don't have permission to view
the page, no matter which page I tried. doing a <A HREF="http://linux/">http://linux/</A> from 10.0.1.2
worked, but then I tried <A HREF="http://linux/manual">http://linux/manual</A> and it told me I didn't have
permission to view it. I couldn't get it to work any better from there.

I had a quick look through the apache documentation, but couldn't find
anything to help me. I also tried putting a line in /etc/inetd.conf and used
comanche to tell it to run from inetd, but it seems my syntax was wrong.
When I did that and tried telnetting to port 80 on the machine, it said
connection refused. I tried the following line in inetd.conf:

http  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/sbin/httpd


Secondly, I am having problems running cgi scripts. I downloaded a few cgi
scripts from apache. I downloaded perl scripts from
<A HREF="http://www.cgi-resources.com/">http://www.cgi-resources.com/</A> andcalled them using &lt;!--#exec
cgi="/cgi-bin/script"&gt; as listed in the readme's in the scripts (i used teh
correct name though). When I tried loading it in the web page, it didn't
load and in the error log it said:

Premature end of script headers

One particular script which I thought was very basic and would definatly
work was the textclock from <A HREF="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts">http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts</A> and it had
teh same error as the other. I tried typing "perl textclock.pl" and it
brougth up the date and time like it should, but it didn't work from in the
web page. I tried the thing listed at
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html</A>#premature-script-headers but either
I did it wrong, or I didn't do it corrently.

thanks again
Andy
