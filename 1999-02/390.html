&gt;You really have a chip on your shoulder about Australians don't you?
&gt;It comes through in your messages time and time again, and has done

Have your arguments run out again, that
you must resort to Name-Calling, Mark?

Your comment does not address the issue...
('not the first time that I have observed this)

By attacking the opponent instead of his arguments,
you are committing the "ad hominim" fallacy (which,
I may have been spelled incorrectly for lack of Latin).

By way of reply, I can say that - if I were in USA and
wanting to make a comment on the people I would
then be in a better position of observing - I might
have used "Americans" instead of "Australians"

I would accept the label of "editorial license" but
not the unthinking person's scream of "racist"

By way of getting you back on track, I now ask you:

How do we get people here (of any race, nationality,
gender, etc.) to stand up against such insulting S.A.
legislation as:

- trading hours restrictions...?
- concessional laws for pokie venues...?

More to the point at hand, how do we get people to
make more waves when:

- ACCC "says" the laws it enforces would
   not preclude OEM's from including a par-
   ticular operating system with each computer,
   even when the Buyer has indicated a preference
   for quite another legitimately licensed replacement?

(Disabled people - whom I have also encour-
aged to take a stand against the status quo -
went further, at a time when busses could not
carry wheelchairs... result?  Now they can!

Of course, there was no Mark Newton, there,
to label my input to that community "Racist" ;)

Ask yourself:  Do we do enough?

Compare to:  The Boston Tea Party (long ago),
California's Referendum (stopping the rise, for
a while, of what we call rates), Demonstrations
against Racism/Apartheid, Windows Refund Day

In Switzerland, a relatively small number of indi-
viduals can force a referendum that THEY write
themselves.

In Sweden, a very strong Freedom of Information
is written into the Swedish constitution; it QUITE
RIGHTLY provides easy and cheap (usually free)
access to government reports, libraries, document
- even the Prime Minister's official mail!

The Berlin Wall is down... Swiss banks are return-
ing money to its original owners... etc. etc. etc. all
because people would not take No for an answer.

You want to call one who encourages this kind of
action (i.e. not taking No) a Racist...?  Why not go
to work on the killer app - Newton 200x - instead?  ;)

At the moment, you seem more interested in
petty name-calling when I point out that *we*
Australians have room for improvement.

For my part, I'm free to find & try to transplant
World Best ideas from where ever I find them

I intend to continue to do this with or without
your support.  Either CONVINCE me or JOIN me  ;)

Why accept 2nd best by wallowing in fallacies?

Who has so much time to waste...?

PS I have not forgotten your THREAT to publish
earlier statements which you attribute to me... i.e.
from private e-mails.

This name-calling and that kind of threatening
behavior suggest a person whose arguments
has run out... your effectiveness will be low -
except perhaps in the minds of those who may
