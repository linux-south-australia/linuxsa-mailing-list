&gt;&gt; However, I am looking for a cleaner setup than that. 
&gt;
&gt;Yeachy, just compile it into the kernel and use the parameters in lilo to
&gt;configure it. This is how we did it when we first started, and used one
&gt;linux box for Everything.
&gt;
&gt;After all, you don't often replace a NIC while the machines still going,
&gt;and need to dynamically reload the modules do you, and if the machines up,
&gt;you want the NIC's configured. My logic anyway ;-)

Thanks for this suggestion.

What I didn't give you was the background.  Last week when I was in Melbourne
I found that I had left my adapters home in Adelaide, and I had to set up
two machines for the next day for a Firewalls and Network Security course.

I hot footed it out and about Melbourne and found two ISA adapters, and had
to get them working with little time.  Indeed, I am often setting up
machines like that. Sometimes I have two of the same type of adapter in the
machine, sometimes different ones.  Sometimes, even 3 adapters.

What I am seeking is a way to allow me to quickly change these things,
especially when I am setting up before courses, that can also be changed
back to the original configuration quickly as well.  Kernel rebuilds are to
be avoided as much as possible.

Perhaps the answer is the Linux Router Project.
