Hi all,

Several things to ask today, but first of all, AMD & Linux
works perfectly.

Has anyone tried to run X on a S3 Neon (365). This is a new
chip from S3 that I picked up the other day from a supplier.
I haven't had any luck finding any info on it anywhere.


The next bit only of interest to people with ATX systems and
is not directly Linux related.

I know a lot of people out there are using new ATX systems
with socket seven chips (K6-2 etc) and I was wondering if
there was any interest in getting in some socket 7 size fans
that use power off the motherboard as opposed to the old AT style
that use a 5" type power connector. These fans are better
because they can be controlled by software via the motherboard,
neater (short thin cable to MB not power supply) will generate
an alarm if stops spinning, etc...

They can also be used without a heatsink as an extra case fan
if plugged into the case-fan connector on the MB. Use it to
increase air flow, cool HDD etc.

I, as a HW supplier have had no luck finding them locally but I
may be able to get a few from a rather shonky importer interstate.
I was originally just going to get two in for myself but I though
that some people in the group may be interested. If anyone is
they can contact me privately.

I expect them to cost between $25-30 (this is cost price + shipping)
so they aren't exactly cheap but just remember, why should Intel
CPU's have all the fun.

PS, If anyone knows where they can be bought here in SA could
they let me know.

Nick Stock
