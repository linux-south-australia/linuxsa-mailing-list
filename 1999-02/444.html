Toby,

			UPDATE! UPDATE!
I just found the answer to my startup problem on the Corel newsgroup.

I was using plain xwp. It should have been ./xwp-I'm still not adjusted
yet from the dos environment  :)
However, if you can help on the shortcut I would appreciate it.

I also noticed in the Corel faq that my Redhat 5.2 should default to
libc6 whereas I apparently need libc-5.3.12-27.i386rpm for wp8. I
haven't done enough yet since I started it up to see if there is a
problem
but I really haven't a clue how to set it up (it will be my first
venture into rpm,s)so that it can live side by side with libc6in
RH5.2-and
where do you get an authorised rpm version of it. 

Maybe I could stretch the friendship a little with a tad more help!.


Thanks again



			OLD STUFF! OLD STUFF!

Thank you very much Toby for your time and detailed helpful reply.

I have now successfully installed WordPerfect 8.0 according to your
advice. However, when I issue the command in XTerm viz.,
home/pets/wordperfect/wpbin/xwp I get the message "command not found"
(xwp).The manual indicates that I must be in the /wpbin directory to
issue the WP start command (xwp).

The following information has been gleaned re the xwp command, if it is
relevant.

Owner=pets
Group=pets
Access=rwxrwxrwx (I have changed it to that)
Type=ordinary file
Symbolic Link=nil


I must still be doing something wrong. Could I impose on you for a
little more help please.
Also I would really like a shortcut icon to startup with but the manual
seems to refer to that only being possible with a CDE (Common Desktop
Environment) which I am afraid I don't know about. 

Thanks again

Brenton Pettitt
