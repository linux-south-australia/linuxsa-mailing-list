&gt;  I downloaded siniffit for Linux 2.0.35 Redhat.
&gt;  But when I execute it, I can see the traffic
&gt;  which is related to my machine alone. i.e.,
&gt;  only "from or to" me. I downloaded
&gt;  the previous version of sniffit also and ther
&gt;  results were the same. I cant sniff the packets
&gt;  generated by other machines in the network.
&gt; 

Hmmm.... 

Sounds very much as though you are on a switched network.  

On a switched network you generally only see traffic that is
known to be on your part of the network.  On a fast switch the
performance is quite high since each ethernet port on the hub 
effectively sees only traffic that is generating (or receiving).
That way the performance is increased because the machine has
effectively free network for it to talk on, where the busy aspect
is taken care of by the hub.

Depending on the hub that you are using you might be able to cause the
hub to send all traffic down your port.  Of course the performance that
you receive from the network may not be as good.

Hope that makes sense...

Regards,

Matt
