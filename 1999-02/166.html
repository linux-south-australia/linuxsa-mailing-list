&gt; Question: does anyone know how to configure
&gt; XBF_i740 (XFree86 accelerated) for a videoExcel card?
&gt; 
&gt; I've just had a very frustrating several hours trying to
&gt; configure the XBF_i740 version of XFree86 for a friend's
&gt; computer.
&gt; 
&gt; She has the AGP card as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; videoExcel
&gt; 3D PRO 740
&gt; AG 240
&gt; (Intel 740).
&gt; 
&gt; It all works fine with wind98, and now I want to get
&gt; it going with dual boot linux, to show off the virtues 
&gt; of linux. Unfortunately, the video card is a major pain
&gt; to get going. Not a good ad for linux! (No flames, please.)
&gt; 
&gt; With whatever configurations I set up with xf86config
&gt; (the new binary found on the site  with
&gt; the i740 X-server), or with Xconfigurator, or with manual
&gt; adjustments with "vi" to the XF86Config file,
&gt; I don't get the mouse to do anything at all.
&gt; No cursor appears, and the graphics are lopsided.
&gt; 
&gt; The tab-key does move the window focus to an xterm window, and
&gt; when I type in text, it does get read and acted upon.
&gt; But what is drawn on the screen when I type text is completely
&gt; garbled -- as if the bytes in a memory map are reversed
&gt; or somehting when the xterm window is scrolled.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have any clues on what might be going wrong here?
&gt; What I really need is someone who has actually got linux going
&gt; with this brand of intel 740 AGP card.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.

I am using a crappy i740 agp 8 meg video excel and I couldn't get it to 
work until I got the later xbfi740 driver.  It isn't working as well as it 
should but it is working ok.  Also you might need to make sure all the 
fonts are installed.  For anything more informative hopefullly someone 
else will have more ideas.
cheers,
Mike
