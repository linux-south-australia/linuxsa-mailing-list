I think I found a similar problem.
However, in my case it was that I could ONLY log in as guest, and
nothing else.
This is because nt4+sp3 and win98 no longer send cleartext passwords.
Samba is quite capable of handling the encrypted passwords, but they are
NOT stored in the same place as the unix passwd's. Instead you need to
use mksmbpasswd or something similar..
And of course enable the 'use encrypted passwords' option.
Theres a text file in the Documentation that comes with samba that
explains all this better than I will.

&gt; Howdy,
&gt; 
&gt;         I have also experienced this problem.  I realise that if browsing with
&gt; SAMBA didn't work with Win98 someone would know by now, so it is probably a
&gt; simple configuration issue somehwere in the smb.conf.  However, I have
&gt; experienced the problem and while I was taking a look at it I found some
&gt; interesting stuff.  The problem was even though you open up all the security
&gt; in your smb.conf your Win98 and NT4 boxes continue to ask for passwords and
&gt; even if you correctly enter the password, still no go.  However on a Win95
&gt; OSR2 machine it works...
&gt; and here is what I found:
&gt; 
&gt; I am using a straight off the CD not fiddled with redhat 5.2, I have not
&gt; edited the smb.conf file and am using the '\\server\username' share.
&gt; 
&gt; A packet filter between the Win95 OSR2 machine reveals the order of events:
&gt; 
&gt; Win95 box sends NBT session request
&gt; Samba sends positive session responce
&gt; Win95 box lists the Dialects it is able to speak (0-5)and says it would like
&gt; NT LM 0.12 (No.5)
&gt; Samba accepts and selects dialect 5 (NT LM 0.12)
&gt; Win95 sends session setup with username and password in CLEARTEXT!
&gt; All sorts of things happen now Tree connects and filsystem info packets..
&gt; and the connection is successful
&gt; 
&gt; The same situation, same untouched server.. but with win98
&gt; 
&gt; Win98 box sends NBT session request
&gt; Samba sends positive session responce
&gt; Win98 box lists the Dialects it is able to speak (0-5)and says it would like
&gt; NT LM 0.12 (No.5)
&gt; Samba accepts and selects dialect 5 (NT LM 0.12)
&gt; Win98 sends session setup with username but at the same position where the
&gt; CLEARTEXT PASSWORD was in the Win95 frame now is just "USERNAME DOMAIN"
&gt; 
&gt; I assume this so that samba can initiate validating the user's domain
&gt; security token with the PDC.
&gt; Even though the USERNAME and DOMAIN details are correct and the password for
&gt; the account is the same on the PDC as it is on the Linux box the session
&gt; still fails.
&gt; 
&gt; Im thinking that you probably need to mess about with the new settings in
&gt; Samba that deal with making validations via a NT PDC, or perhaps turning
&gt; DOMAIN validation off on the Win98 client.
&gt; 
&gt; NT4 sessions to samba in this way also fail with a similar packet structure,
&gt; and the error is returned on the NT4 client - "The account is not authorized
&gt; to log in from this station"
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that OSR2 sends cleartext to Samba is fairly interesting! But what
&gt; more would you expect.

&gt; &gt; Subject: sharing via samba
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my
&gt; &gt; computers. As the
&gt; &gt; subject suggests, I'm having problems trying to share via samba.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is as follows:
&gt; &gt; On my win98 box, i go to network neighborhood and the Linux
&gt; &gt; box's netbios
&gt; &gt; name is listed. I try to open it, but it asks me for a
&gt; &gt; password. I would
&gt; &gt; like to make it so you don't need any password and doesn't
&gt; &gt; even ask you for
&gt; &gt; any, like sharing via Win98, but I don't know how to do this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the smb.conf file, I have the line "guest account =
&gt; &gt; guest". On my Win98
&gt; &gt; box, the login name is pii. I added the users pii and guest
&gt; &gt; on the linux
&gt; &gt; box, and made the password the same. When i am prompted for
&gt; &gt; the password, I
&gt; &gt; first tried just pressing enter, hoping it would be no
&gt; &gt; password (and use the
&gt; &gt; guest account), but it told me the password is incorrect. I
&gt; &gt; tried entering
&gt; &gt; the password that I set as pii's and guest's password, but that says
&gt; &gt; password incorrect. What have I done wrong?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks,
&gt; &gt; Andy
