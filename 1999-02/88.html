For what it's worth, the games machine(s) in our household run 98lite,
which is a 3rd party modification to windows 98. It removes IE4, as well
as someother minor parts, and replaces them with the win95 counterparts.
The difference is amazing! Seriously, you gain about 40 Mb of memory
(well, maybe 'recover' is more the right word.) Windows is noticeably
faster and more stable too.
Everyone I know who has tried it out has agreed that windows runs
better, and plays their games better. (What else would u use windows
for? ;)

There is absolutely no way that is 'decreases performance' at all. Any
real test that hasnt been modified by m$ will show that. And then M$
will have trouble explaining why IE4 'had' to be included... hehehe.
Let's hope this will be the 2nd case that ms loses. And let's hope that
the 3rd they lose is when someone sue's them over breaking their 1980's
agreement not to force manufacturers to sell their product...Because if
they lose that, they'll have to pay a LOT in compensation, given that
they've been breaking it since 1995.....
Microsft's lawyers might be good, but they're facing every increasing
opposition, and they're really having to earn their money now...

My 2 cents worth,
Toby

&gt;                 Government: Microsoft falsified video
&gt; 
&gt; WASHINGTON - Software giant Microsoft suffered what could be a
&gt; stunning blow in its antitrust case Tuesday when the government
&gt; accused it of falsifying a video demonstration shown in court
&gt; Monday. Justice Department lawyer David Boies stopped the video
&gt; demonstration in midframe Tuesday morning to show that a software
&gt; title bar had suddenly changed in the middle of the tape. The video
&gt; purportedly shows how attempts to modify Windows 98 to disable
&gt; Microsoft's Internet browser caused severe performance problems. After
&gt; Boies' dramatic announcement, a Microsoft executive said the company
&gt; had made "mistakes" in producing the tape; meanwhile, Microsoft
&gt; lawyers appeared crestfallen.
