&gt; I must apologise about the happy99.exe file, I honestly had no idea it
&gt;was even on my system anymore! I thought I deleted it ages ago, and how
&gt;it managed to become linked to that email I have no idea. It is
&gt;definately not easy to 'accidentally' select a file to attach to an
&gt;email. Once again, sorry to everyone for having to waste bandwidth
&gt;downloading it.


That is what the virus does. It attaches itself to any email that you send.
I've been watching what people have said it does, and the functions inside
the program itself. If you all want to find out more about it, have a look
at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/3652/SKA.HTM">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/3652/SKA.HTM</A>

That gives a description of what the virus does, as well as how to remove it
from your system.

I was actually going to say that perhaps Sam didn't know that he passed it
along, after reading the info about it. But, he beat me to it :)

Cheers
Dazz
