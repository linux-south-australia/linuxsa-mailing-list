&gt; 
&gt; I've been thinking along those lines lately. Attempts from Uni accounts
&gt; are easily dealt with by reporting to the sysadmins, but it's those from
&gt; dial-up connections of irresponsible ISPs that are causing the
&gt; headaches. Most won't even bother to acknowledge the email.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a way to find out if a machine at the other end is a Windows
&gt; box? Maybe I should booby-trap my tcp-wrappers and boink/nuke/flood
&gt; mscan sources to death.

Be proud that we are running a decent O/S. One that can't be crashed by
a handful of bytes, and one that copes better than some at withstanding
floods. Most people who are scanning or attacking are used to little
opposition - they'll just check to see if you're a manipulateable user,
fail against linux, and then move on. Nuking them back almost certainly
won't do anything, because a modern windoze system has had so many
patches applied that it's impervious until a new nuke comes along.
Flooding them back isn't terribly useful either if you're on a modem
link. It's not really a flood at 4 kb/sec, but it'll still annoy them a
bit I guess if they're on a modem link too. But it'll also annoy all the
innocent sysadmin's along the way, and really, but following the lamer's
example and just return scanning/nuking/flooding, you're sinking down to
your level.
Just because someone uses linux to do those activities only makes them
an intelligent weenie, instead of a windoze weenie. If you are going to
hack, at least do it yourself and try and find some new methods....Read
source code, look for openings, and experiment. Maybe you'll find a way
in. You can enjoy yourself for a while taking advantage of it. Then,
it'll find it's way into a mass-market program for kiddies, and
instantly the hole will be patched everywhere. Thus, by being an
intelligent hacker you are doing us all a favour by discovering security
holes, even if you don't actually do anything about it.
