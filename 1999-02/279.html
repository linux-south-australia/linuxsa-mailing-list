&gt; Hi there.
&gt; 
&gt; I get this message when I log into a couple of my machines just
&gt; before I get my first prompt
&gt; 
&gt;         bash: ulimit: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted
&gt;         [<A HREF="mailto:alex@whisky">alex@whisky</A> alex]$
&gt; 
&gt; Now I've been getting a similar message on another machine, but that's because
&gt; I *thought* I had broken something with disk quotas. (It started happening
&gt; then). I managed to get quotas going fine on one disk, but then I tried a
&gt; second disk and I started getting that message.
&gt; 
&gt; The wierd thing is that the machine I just started getting this error message
&gt; on has never had any disk quotas played with ever! It just started happening
&gt; after I did a restart (by accident I might add).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone had this before?

I think you'll find that ulimit is responsible for many things other
than limits..
Have you checked what option you are passing ulimit?
It'll most probably be called in .bashrc or.bash_profile or /etc/bashrc
or /etc/profile.
Some options passed to ulimit are priveledged and can only be called by
root. Trying to call them as a normal user will result in that error
message. Does this message occur when you log in as root?

My main suggestion is to find where ulimit is being called in your login
scripts, and then to check the relevant documentation to see what that
option is trying to do.

Yours
Toby
