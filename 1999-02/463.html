Hi,

I'm starting to think there's something wrong with my computers. As the
subject suggests, I'm having problems trying to share via samba.

The problem is as follows:
On my win98 box, i go to network neighborhood and the Linux box's netbios
name is listed. I try to open it, but it asks me for a password. I would
like to make it so you don't need any password and doesn't even ask you for
any, like sharing via Win98, but I don't know how to do this.

In the smb.conf file, I have the line "guest account = guest". On my Win98
box, the login name is pii. I added the users pii and guest on the linux
box, and made the password the same. When i am prompted for the password, I
first tried just pressing enter, hoping it would be no password (and use the
guest account), but it told me the password is incorrect. I tried entering
the password that I set as pii's and guest's password, but that says
password incorrect. What have I done wrong?


Thanks,
Andy

PS. I recieved one e-mail from someone asking me to mail them with any
success from the questions from the e-mail called "a few things". Well, i
stupidly lost the e-mail address, so I don't know who to reply to. to that
person and anyone interested: I am keeping a web page (at
<A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~zivkotech/bilisili/linux/">http://www.ozemail.com.au/~zivkotech/bilisili/linux/</A> ) with details of
everything I achive in linux. You can look at that for how I 'fixed' the
'problems', or e-mail me again and I promise not to lose your e-mail address
again ;)
