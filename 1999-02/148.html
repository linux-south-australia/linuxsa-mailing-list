Hi all,

Has anyone here tried to make sense of the free architectural CAD system
called OCTREE??? If so, can you please send me (in English) a synopsis
of how to use it, and an opinion of how good it is. I would be most
grateful.

I found OCTREE from freshmeat, thought it might be a reasonable tool to
use to draw up my house extensions. I have used many CAD systems, but
never anything like this before!!!!

Cheers and goodnight,

Bruce Moffatt

PS if any of you remember the trouble I had with a 'free' email account
a little while back, I think I have figured out the cause. The symptom
was that every time I posted an email to this list from the free
netscape account, someone else bounced a reply to the list from their
free 'hotmail' account, no content, just the spam hotmail signature. I
was fearful of being party to a net-spamming mail-bouncing
bandwidth-clogging fiasco, so closed my netscape account. Now I read in
Computer Choice that hotmail is owned by Microsoft. (Why am I not
suprised???)
