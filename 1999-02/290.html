At 16:36 15/02/99 +0930, you wrote:
&gt;I have 6 phone lines pooled to one number, and if I dial in 7 times they
&gt;rotate properly and the seventh is engaged as it should. However if one
&gt;modem is turned off, and I try dialing in, the call dials out instead of
&gt;rotating to the next modem, "has anyone encountered this problem
&gt;before"?

All day, everyday just about...
(exageration but it it is really common problem for ISPs).

Here are a few Q/A's that should help:

1.Q Simplest way to make a line engaged?
1.A 'short' the line by crossing the wires (anything from nice, neat scotch
plugs
through to twisting bare wires with your fingers will do) with an RJ45 or
whatever kind of plug you are using on the end that goes into the ph socket.
This was what Ben refered to as an X-over plug ;-)
*RJ-plugs: It is always the center two wires that are used for PH lines

2.Q Long and complicated 'remote method' to make line engaged?
2.A If the dialup machine is over 50km away (like some of ours...joy)
you may want to make the line engaged till you can get there in person.
To do this you can _sometimes_ send the modem an "ath1" string to make
it stay "Off-Hook", and put that string in a specific config pattern for
just that modem (so that mgetty respawns it as engaged too)
*Not the best solution but like I said, it can save you complaint calls 
while you are "en-route" to fix the problem.


3.Q Why the hell can't the rotary just move on to the next line? ;-P
3.A Because there are TWO TYPES of rotary available. Query Telstra on
this and they'll tell you which one you are on ("Rotary1" or "Rotary2").

Rotary1 = Dial them in order and only 'step' up to next if busy
	   (That's the one you have)

Rotary2 = Is better for ISP rotaries because it 'steps' up after
	   every call (whether answered, connected or not). It just
	   keeps cycling through the 'step group' till it finds one. But that
	   makes it a bugger to find dead modems that don't even flash
	   their AA light when being rung :-\ (be warned).

&gt;
&gt;My modems are Hayes Optima 336 they are connected to a Cisco Radius
&gt;as2511-rj 2500 series Access Server.
&gt;

Great, let me know how it goes with that Cisco 2500!
(I have to setup a 2nd-hand one pretty soon and might need
some help configuring ;-)

-Daniel
