&gt; Heyas all,
&gt;
&gt; I tried to install RH5.2 on a friends machine today, but I had a few
&gt; problems with the onboard SCSI controller, it couldn't find it, and I have
&gt; no idea what the options I am meant to put in are. The Machine is an  Acer
&gt; 486DX2/66 and I can't see a specific chip mentioned saying "this is the SCSI
&gt; chip" but at the back of the manual it mentions aha1520 which is I presume
&gt; the SCSI chip.

&gt; When I try an autoprobe in setup, it is looking at irq 12, but it is
&gt; actually on irq 10. I have no idea about IO port ranges etc. Like I said
&gt; about, I don't have any idea of the options to tell it not to look at irq
&gt; 12.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone help me with getting this working?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers, and TIA
&gt; Dazz
&gt;

I have an acer 486dx33 with onboard scsi that I am going to put redhat 5.2 on
this week, and it has an onboard scsi (probably the same one).  In mine there is
a big adaptec chip right by the scsi connector that says

adaptec, inc.
aic-6260al
zga221
623700
ms251734.

Presumably the aic-6260al is the name of the chip.  Un fortunatly I dont have
the answer, but I'd be very interested to know it.  This info might help someone
come up with the answer...
