&gt;&gt; [Michael Doyle has] now unsubscribed from this list, due to the
condescending
&gt;&gt; attitude of some of the list members.
&gt;
&gt;I see from the archives that his first post was "newbie", sent on
&gt;9 Dec 1998; and his last was "Netscape-Communicator v4.5", posted
&gt;today (10 Feb 1999).  In this time he has asked many questions,
&gt;most of which were already answered in the extensive documentation.
&gt;He is a newbie and so this is to be expected.  What I don't understand
&gt;is the "condescending attitude" he apparently complained of.  After
&gt;spending a bit of time searching, I could find not one example of
&gt;a condescending attitude directed at him; not even from me, and
&gt;I'm quick to tell idiots and lazy swine that they are idiots and
&gt;lazy swine! :-)
-------------------------8&lt;------------------------
David,
	This is exactly what pisses people off, even suggesting that there are
idiots & lazy people has no place on this list in my opinion.
	Yes people are going to ask questions over and over again, but there are
people out there that get benefit from it, not everyone has extensive
knowledge like yourself, and some need to be led by the hand until they
understand that there is documentation etc.

If you can't cope with that I suggest you unsubscribe from the list yourself.

Alternatively
1. Read email
2. Don't like
3. Delete
4. Next
-------------------------8&lt;------------------------

  I suppose he must have unsubscribed from the list
&gt;because he felt outraged by the condescending attitude directed
&gt;towards others?  *shrug*  A bit too sensitive, IMSO.
