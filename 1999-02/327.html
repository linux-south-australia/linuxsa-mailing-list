NTLM is a _special_ Microsoft protocol.

Essentially it's there own non-kerberos etc... idea of a password encryption
system.  It uses a system of tokens to authenticate people, which is quite a
good idea in a complex network environment...

Being a _special_ Microsoft protocol it can't successfully get through firewalls
... or for that matter their own proxy server.  If you want to talk to the
outside world using NTLM you'll need to poke some holes in your firewall and
wrap the NTLM packets with GRE.  [Which isn't that much fun to sort out].

Of course, you could also (if possible) have the site they're trying to connect
with only use Basic Authentication (clear text) which avoids this problem.
Anyone with a packet sniffer can get your passwords then. [Only good if you have
control of the external sites obviously].

Unfortunately, setting the site up to have both Basic and NTLM Authentication
doesn't seem to work either, as when the server tries to use NTLM, the browser
can spit, and never try the Basic method.

Yes, btw, it is spitting on the hand shake, continually sending the first part
of the negotiation process.

&gt; Question -
&gt;
&gt; Any got any info on the challenge/response security mechanism employed by MS
&gt; Proxy Server and IIS.
&gt;
&gt; If this is turned on, and you try to connect to either IIS or to a site via
&gt; MS Proxy, it uses some non-internet standard way of validating the client
&gt; (via the NT domain login rather than normal method ???).
&gt;
&gt; The result is that anyone trying to view these servers using Netscape / Lynx
&gt; / etc end up in this very tight handshaking loop with the offending server,
&gt; and the contents of the page that you want to look at are never received.
&gt;
&gt; Any clues ?
