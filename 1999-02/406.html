&gt; I remember ages ago under this mailing list a discussion going along =
&gt; that involved the Commonwealth bank netbank running under wine...
&gt; 
&gt; I am eager to get this going...

It does work.

&gt; when I try it though just with the default parameters "wine netbank.exe"
&gt; it just gets up to the validating software part and that is it... It =
&gt; never goes any further apart from an error message saying that there was =
&gt; an error trying to connect check if you are connected to the internet. =
&gt; It is not a problem with a proxy server as I am able to have a direct =
&gt; connection not through the proxy server.=20

Make sure you have the latest versions.  There are some libraries from a 
full win95/98/nt install that *ARE* needed.  It will have a GPF if it doesn't
have them.  I found that a version of the NT MSVCRT.DLL, comctl32.dll,  shell32.dll
are needed for it to run.

When it is trying to connect - use 'netstat -at' to get a list of connections 
from you machine.

There should be a line that looks like 

tcp        0      0 myhost:3499            203.17.185.180:2202     ESTABLISHED 

The important bit is that there should be a connection to 2202 somewhere with
the state being ESTABLISHED.  If you are getting a SYN_SENT state you are not 
getting through your firewall/proxyy.

It does work, and you can transfer funds too!  BTW you can use 
wine -managed netbank.exe to let wine be friendly with you window manager.

Regards,

Matt
