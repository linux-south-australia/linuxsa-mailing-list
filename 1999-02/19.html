&gt; You can actually use the "POWER BUTTON". :)
&gt; 
&gt; In the BIOS there should be an option to specify how the
&gt; power button will work. Usually the default is to turn the
&gt; machine off if held down for 4 seconds but it can be set
&gt; so that it has no effect. Basically RTFM -motherboard manual. :)

oh... er... thanks :)
I'll have a look at it tonight -- every time I've played with it, I
haven't noticed anything like that... but what would be better is
complete software shutdown a'la Evil Empire...

&gt; Redhat5.2]
&gt; 
&gt; I have a PII, with an ATX power supply -- the one that has software off.
&gt; The only way that I can turn my computer off is to reboot into windows
&gt; and choose the shutdown command there. This is irritating, because if I
&gt; was working in windows, I can pretty much stop what I am doing, and tell
&gt; the computer to shut down, and then leave the room. With Linux, I ahve
&gt; to shutdown linux, then reboot to windows, then wait for windows to do
&gt; it's thing for about a minute, then select shutdown there. There has got
&gt; to be a better way -- an option I can set somewhere or something...
&gt; Anyone have a solution?

Many are called, few are chosen.  Fewer still get to do the choosing.
