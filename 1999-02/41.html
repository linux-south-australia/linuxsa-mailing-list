&gt;bit I guess if they're on a modem link too. But it'll also annoy all the
&gt;innocent sysadmin's along the way, and really, but following the lamer's
&gt;example and just return scanning/nuking/flooding, you're sinking down to
&gt;their level.

Hey, don't get me wrong here. I'm not advocating the practice of
indiscriminate
bombing of any/all attempted attackers. I said "possibly" and "the more
persistent ones" in that post, meaning the bastards who continue to try and
try again OR who
do a 2000-port mscan on your box OR who get annoyed that it didn't work and
decide
to throw Teardrops and DoS attacks your way.

Your absolutely, right in that they _usually_ check and move on as soon as 
they see that you have your security in order.

I have never bombed a SERVER that was responsible for a scan, just contacted
the sysadmins about it. However, I have been forced to do it to dialup
linux boxes
or icmp flood the odd Windoze dialup ONLY WHEN it was about to cause real
problems at my end (mail servers don't perform too well during a 2hr mscan).

Furthermore, your also right in saying that it won't necessarily kill their
machine, but it sure slows them down (which eases the attack itself).
Mostly, they think their ppp link went crappy and re-dialin (also requiring
them to cease the attack). 

&gt;Just because someone uses linux to do those activities only makes them
&gt;an intelligent weenie, instead of a windoze weenie. If you are going to
&gt;hack, at least do it yourself and try and find some new methods....Read
&gt;source code, look for openings, and experiment. Maybe you'll find a way
&gt;in. You can enjoy yourself for a while taking advantage of it. Then,
&gt;

This is exactly what I would be doing IF I was fulltime security expert.
But I'm not, I'm just trying to maintain an ISP network with a few thousand
users on it (who are less than sympathetic to mailserver downtimes).

Anyway, I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything, we're all
on the same side here. I just didn't want anyone thinking that I'm
suggesting extreme tactics for low-level attacks, as I'm not.

PS: Most of this debate is academic, as most scans go unnoticed till
afterward 
anyway (and I'm not that vindictive that I would retaliate after-the-fact).
It's way more important to make sure you are safe from scanners than to know
how to incur your vengeful wrath upon those who use them ;-)
