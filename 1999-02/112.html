<H1>partitioning problems</H1>

<PRE>
I recently acquired another hard drive which is exactly the same as my
old one. They're both Maxtor 7850AV's at 813MB each.

One my old one I have: dos partition with win95 (about 413 MBs),
extended dos partition (about 400 MBs). The extended dos partition has
linux on it. Ie it's divided into linux native and swap partitions.

The other disk used to belong to my cousin, and since I installed linux
for him as well, it's divided up quite similarly to mine.

What I want to achieve: allocate about 760 MBs for windows on the first
hard disk, with what's left over for linux swap. On the second hard
disk: about 760 MBs for linux, with what's left over made into a dos
partition so I can shove the windows swap file on it. So far I have
backed up stuff I need onto the windows partition on the second hard
disk (hdc1). This is so that I can re-partition the first disk, install
windows, then shove my backups onto it. Then I'll be able to
re-partition the second disk and install linux.

Problem: dos's fdisk sux. It tells me this about the first disk: primary
and extended partitions exist. I go to delete the extended partiton. It
says no - cannot delete partition while logical drives exist. I go to
delete logical drives - but alas windows does not recognize them
(created by linux), so I can't even do that.

My ideas on a solution: use linux's fdisk to repartition. Since linux
currently resides on the disk which is going to be partitioned first,
this is going to be a bit of a problem. Two (possible) ways to gett
around this: use a linux root or boot disk with fdisk to do this. If
this is the way, could someone please guide me through the necessary
steps, and which disk.
Or, 2.), somehow make the partition on the second hard disk active and
load the other linux (my cousin's) from lilo on that. If that's the
case, could someone guide me through this process.

Also, about linux's fdisk (what I've read from the man pages): if a dos
partition's size is specified by cyls/heads/sectors, I wouldn't have a
clue as to how many to specify for my hard drive - perhaps look in the
cmos settings?
There are two other fdisks in linux: cfdisk and sfdisk. Differences
anyone?
Found out that dos's 6.x fdisk has a bug which requires some long dd
command to overcome. This looks a bit scary. If I could get linux's
fdisk to prepare the first disk for me for both windows and dos, and
then once windows is installed and linux gone, get the other disk
partitoned somehow, that would be just hunky and even dory.

Thanks in advance,

Tom

ps also thanks to everyone who responded to my cdrom link question.
