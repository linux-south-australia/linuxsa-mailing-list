Dear David,

Thank you for contacting VeriSign Customer Service.

Thank you for your feedback on the Site Finder service. It is not 
possible to opt out of the service. The Site Finder response is incurred
when a non-existent domain name query in com/net is directed to us. It 
is not a service in which someone would subscribe to or sign up for.

For more information please refer to our FAQs:
<A HREF="http://www.verisign.com/nds/naming/sitefinder/">http://www.verisign.com/nds/naming/sitefinder/</A>

We remain committed to ensuring that Site Finder improves Web navigation
and the user experience.

Thank you.

If you require further assistance please contact us by replying to this 
email.

Best Regards,

David Reid
