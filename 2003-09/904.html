&gt; There are also forces pushing down the boot time on Linux

There is another very fruitful thing to try for speeding up boot times
and that is to throw out the BIOS. I care about this because some of my
systems are either quite slow or have to be rebooted very frequently,
being part of a simulated systems network.

Anyone that runs an Intel with an expensive SCSI system, will be aware
that minutes of boot time can be consumed by BIOS operations. Most but
not all things that the BIOS sets up are completely ignored by modern
operating systems, which do checking and setup of their own as the
drivers interrogate the PCI/I2O/whatever bus and come to their own
conclusions.

That problem has been addressed by the LinuxBIOS project,
<A HREF="http://linuxbios.org.">http://linuxbios.org.</A>  It is a port of Linux to flashable firmware. Runs
on x86 and x86-64 and PPC, formerly on Alpha but I don't think it works
any more (so much so I don't dare try it on my Alpha at home just in
case... :-) I've seen five or seconds from power-on to the boot sector
being run and people who run clusters and know how to tune it report
even lower numbers.

You can use this to boot Linux, Windows (not sure if it does XP) and at
least OpenBSD. I'd like to know if anyone has booted other BSDs using
this, I've only got so much time to try things out.
