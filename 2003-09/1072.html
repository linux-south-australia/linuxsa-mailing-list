&gt; That doesn't defy logic too much. Optus and Foxtel have a history of
&gt; marketing to those who can least afford to buy their product. Offer them
&gt; 'cheap' deals and rigid contracts and watch the money flow in. he roll-out
&gt; of cable into poorer areas was always going to be moved ahead of everyone
&gt; else because the programs on cable cater so much to the tastes of those from
&gt; lower socio-economic backgounds (Jerry! Jerry!).

lol my teenage daughter loves jerry. its a cartoon freak show of a
program. surreal. 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh and before anyone goes off at me for sounding elist, bear in mind I was
&gt; brought (thrown) up in Mansfield Park in the 80's and early 90's and I'm
&gt; part Aboriginal. If there's a lower socio-economic group than the one I was
&gt; in, I would guess that the next step down would have been living on the
&gt; streets!

hmmm. you win!

but note - i define myself as rich. 
not socio-economically perhaps, but in what counts.

family, friends, and computers, of course!
