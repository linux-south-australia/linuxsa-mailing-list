Hi.

&gt; Poor arguments there. You will have to do better than that.
&gt; 
&gt; We run mixed Win /Linux environment and both server their purpose

Yep, so do we.

&gt; 
&gt; Stability : Contrary to the belief of some people here Windows 
&gt; Servers can be stable depending on what they are running. The 
&gt; only time our Win NT F&P server gets rebooted is after 
&gt; essential security patches. Linux also requires rebooting 
&gt; after Kernels get updated due to security issues. The only 
&gt; Windows servers I have ever had to administer that required 
&gt; rebooting weekly was an Exchange 5.5 Server and an old NT 
&gt; Comms server that had a dicky Eicon Routing card that used to lock
&gt; up.

Generally agree, but point out that the requirements for security
patching and subsequent reboots is constant on Windows, and occasional
on Linux. Windows still requires rebooting for just about any patch,
certainly most of them.

We don't have to reboot our W2k boxen weekly, but we run into memory
problems if we leave it over a month. The boxes don't blue screen at
that point, we just get lowered performance and unexplained session
deaths... These boxes are running DB, Apps, print and WTS or citrix.

The Linux boxen run mail, file, print, fax, monitoring, RAS, etc. The
usually get rebooted at every major power failure exceeding the UPS
time, or on hardware failure. No security related reboots that I can
think of in the recent past (1-2 years)

&gt; 
&gt; Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor : 2 of our Windows servers and none of 
&gt; our Linux servers have KB/Mouse/Monitor. Administration of our 
&gt; Win Servers is done with VNC.

Ours have the kb etc via KVM. Rarely used.

&gt; 
&gt; Hardware : Any New Server is quite capable of running Win or 
&gt; Linux. We still have some production Win NT servers running on 
&gt; Pentium 75 Servers so your argument falls down there also.
&gt; 
&gt; Backup : not much good backing up just your smb.conf file if 
&gt; it is a file and print server is it. Surely you need to back 
&gt; up the data also ?

Bet on it :)

&gt; 
&gt; I would certainly prefer using Linux/SAMBA servers for F&P as 
&gt; overall Linux provides a lot more flexibility, but where it 
&gt; falls down is extended attributes / permissions of files and 
&gt; folders and groups. This is really easy in Windows but can be 
&gt; a pain in Linux.

Fortunately, not a problem for us...

&gt; 
&gt; The second issue we have with not using Linux/SAMBA servers 
&gt; more is most currently also act as BDCs. When SAMBA 3.0 
&gt; finally comes out this point should "hopefuly" be a non-issue.
&gt; 
&gt; I am happy to be corrected on any of these points..so feel free

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; Well, you've got a *n?x/BSD system and all its functionality.
&gt; 
&gt; Not to mention its stability and security :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; including a plain text file for configuration - no clickyclicky
&gt; &gt; interface which drives you crazy when you want to create more than 20
&gt; &gt; shares
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; configuration backup is easier - just backup the smb.conf and when your
&gt; &gt; server has crashed for what reason whatsoever your configuration can
&gt; &gt; easily be restored.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and you don't need a keyboard, mouse and monitor for the server after
&gt; &gt; you've installed it. just put it in your toilet ;)
