&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On the plus side, stating dependencies rather than arbitrary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers helps application authors tremendously.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any prior implementations of this (closed source or otherwise)?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Take a look at the NetBSD rcNG implementation.  FreeBSD has since
&gt;&gt; adopted it as well.
&gt;
&gt; I think that was copied from Mastadon Linux. Or at least, Mastadon Linux
&gt; came first. See <A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/</A>
&gt; for a comprehensive overview of the problems and assorted fixes.

It seems that Richard hasn't paid too much attention to what Luke was
doing.  From that URL:

&gt; For years, Patrick and I have been bitching and moaning about the way
&gt; Unix systems boot. "One day" we were going to figure out a better
&gt; way. That day came on Saturday, 29th January 2000....
&gt; 
&gt; In March, Wichert Akkerman (Debian project leader) was in town for the
&gt; Linux conference and Expo, which was our chance to sell the idea to
&gt; the Debian project. Wichert liked the idea (in fact he'd once tried
&gt; something similar, but never got it fully working), but wanted the
&gt; addition of the provide(8) feature.
&gt; ...
&gt; Finally, in October, sitting on a plane headed for ALS, I had the time
&gt; to get back to boot scripts, and started writing the provide(8)
&gt; implementation. Shortly after my return from this trip I had finished
&gt; this work, and finally had emptied out the ToDo list. Joy of joys!

So it seems that this version came live in October 2000 at the
earliest.  NetBSD's CVS repository shows:

&gt; revision 1.1.1.1
&gt; date: 2000/03/10 11:53:25;  author: lukem;  state: Exp;  lines: +0 -0
&gt; rc.d scripts derived from /etc/rc

It's also surprising that Richard refers to a significantly later
article by Will Andrews, and not to Luke's own work.
