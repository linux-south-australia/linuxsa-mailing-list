&gt; (anyway:  MMU's aren't a strict requirement for UNIX -- Cray Unicos

Although they aren't a strict requirement you've got to
ask why you'd go with the UNIX bloat unless you get the
benefit of protection from Programs Gone Horribly Wrong.

With Unicos the answer is simple -- there's only one
user of the supercomputer at any one time, and those
people will take a 5% improvement in CPU time over
protection from themselves.  The UNIX-like interface
allows program development away from expensive
supercomputer CPU.

&gt;  &gt; I don't think the Intel family had this kind of full-stack-save and
&gt;  &gt; MMU support in the 80186 and 80286, which is why linux requires a 386.
&gt; 
&gt; Xenix seemed to cope with the 286 architecture...

Xenix was a total dog *because* it had to run on a 286.

The 80286 VM scheme uses segmented virtual memory (not
the contiguous address space with pages which is used
by OSs on the 386 and later).  Calling this "virtual memory"
is a bit generous: you can only send 64KB chunks of
memory to swap, the compiler is complex (you have to
split data structures &gt; 64KB into multiple segments),
and the CPU has no instruction restart on a segment
fault (but does provide enough information so that
the instruction can be simulated by the paging code).

You do get user/supervisor access rights, per-process
mapping (and thus the ability to prevent one user
trashing another).

In short, you get virtual memory, but in a horribly
inconvenient way and at shocking cost.

When there were no other alternatives (eg, in the design
era of Xenix) you live with it.  When there are alternatives
(eg, in the design era of Linux) you avoid it like the
bad idea it is.

Cheers,
Glen

PS: I thought it was the Apollo which had a CPU just
    for handling 68000 page faults.
