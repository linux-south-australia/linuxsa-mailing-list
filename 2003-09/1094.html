&gt; If you made your own distribution[1], wouldn't it be nice to be able 
&gt; mass produce .deb or .rpm files in a completely automated way? Well I am 
&gt; trying to figure out if that is possible.....

It certainly is possible, and is happening every tick of the clock :-)

wanna-build and buildd do this over and over and over in order to keep
the sleepless Debian archives up to date. New and modified source
packages keep pouring in, and they are processed into binary debs for
all the architectures continually. See <A HREF="http://buildd.debian.org/.">http://buildd.debian.org/.</A> For
example, <A HREF="http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?arch">http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?arch</A>=&pkg=dpkg says that
the package dpkg has been built 21 times since 19/9.

You can build your own buildd, it takes patience but you certainly can
do it. At the very simplest level that lets you build your own
distribution optimised for, say, the i686 or Alpha Makita architectures
by changing compiler switches.

At a more complicated level you can alter some of the source packages
going in, if you wish.

&gt; But where to find a server that has a bunch of source files on it? 
&gt; Didn't seem like there were any servers that had source repositories at 
&gt; the sites listed in my /etc/apt/sources.list. 

That surprises me. You are in the US, so try
deb-src <A HREF="http://http.us.debian.org/debian">http://http.us.debian.org/debian</A> testing main contrib non-free 

You might also like to consider what is in a source package. See
<A HREF="http://people.debian.org/~walters/files/dpkg-source-v2/c26.html.">http://people.debian.org/~walters/files/dpkg-source-v2/c26.html.</A>

&gt; [1] I don't, probably will not and could not :-)

Maybe this shows that it might not be so improbable after all?
