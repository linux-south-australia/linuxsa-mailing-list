Interesting, but I would guess a lot of attendees would probably already
know plenty about Linux.

Bigger still would be to do the next Adelaide Show or Home Expo and get
the message to the general public.

&gt;  Ok. Random thought processes sometimes throw up ideas that
&gt;  might seem to be stupid but actually contain the kernel of a
&gt;  good idea. I have them all the time. This is just another
&gt;  one. It isn't likely to be either right or wrong but
&gt;  somewhere in between. It is shared with you in case others
&gt;  think there is some merit in the idea.
&gt; 
&gt;  An estimated 9,500 visitors attended the last Wiredup Expo,
&gt;  and this year's event will be held in the newly renovated
&gt;  and enlarged Adelaide Convention Centre. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Held at Adelaide Convention Centre on November 1-2 from 10am-5pm.
&gt; 
&gt;  Wired Up is a big event on the IT calendar. Lots of IT folks
&gt;  visit the show. Lots of companies and groups put on a stand
&gt;  and do demonstrations.
&gt; 
&gt;  Why not a "Linux in SA" stand?
&gt; 
&gt;  We could approach the organisers for cheep rate (free?)
&gt;  stand and there are enough of us to share the load to staff
&gt;  the booth. We could hook in suppliers for stuff to
&gt;  sell/offer/giveaway/support our costs.
&gt; 
&gt;  We could tell people about LCA2004. 
&gt; 
&gt;  We could tell people about the OSS mini conference and the
&gt;  Education and other mini conferences.
&gt; 
&gt;  We could tell people about CSDN and give CDs away/ sell for $2.
&gt; 
&gt;  We could work with ComputerBank SA and tell people what they
&gt;  do and help them seek corporate support for donor computers.
&gt; 
&gt;  We could do a great deal of excellent publicity for
&gt;  ourselves and the Linux / Open Source movement.
&gt; 
&gt;  But ... there is always a but ... we, you and I and all of
&gt;  us ... would need to extract the digit and work together to
&gt;  make it happen ... it wont happen any other way.
&gt; 
&gt;  So there is the idea and the challenge. Now up to each of
&gt;  you to think it through and comment.
&gt; 
&gt;  Again, where and when?
&gt;  Adelaide Convention centre, November 1-2 from 10am-5pm, entry is $10.
