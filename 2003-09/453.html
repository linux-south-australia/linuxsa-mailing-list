Rubbish.

I didn't reject his comments because of his attacks on Linux. I rejected 
them because they were without substance and mostly hyperbole. Did you ask 
Romana why she rejected his statements or are you only responding to me 
because I felt your stance was misled?

&gt; As to the idea that because Open Source is out in the open malapropriation
&gt; couldn't occur
&gt;
I don't recall saying that it didn't occur. I said that it is far less 
likely to occur because of the open source. Anybody that contributes would 
be recognised and could be traced if it was found that code belonged to 
other parties.

The chances of that level of discovery ever occurring in closed source are 
so slim as to be very unlikely.

Cheers,  Ian
