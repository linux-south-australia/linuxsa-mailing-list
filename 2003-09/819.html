&gt; However, boot times are important for many people eg large machines,

I work with some Suns and HPs that can take up to an hour to boot,
including application startup time.  They like to keep those sorts
of machines up continuously (not that it happens, though).  The boot
time of some of these machine without the application is starting
to get excessive (10+ minutes).

&gt; Richard Gooch has had a parallel start service implementation for
&gt; a while - 

Parallel, or dependency start?  The one I'm thinking about is located
at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/&gt">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/&gt</A>;.

&gt; IIRC dependencies are specified by comments in the startup
&gt; scripts.

No, he didn't want to build a parser - there are "need" and
"provide" programs to be embedded in the start scripts.

It is an elegant scheme, though.  I tried to figure out a
way to add in parallelism to the boot process, but couldn't
figure out a method that didn't look like an ugly kludge.
I need to take another crack at it though, because I think
the results would be worthwhile.

&gt; However, service startup time is just one of a few areas
&gt; which could be sped up.

Moving (some of) the RAM check out of the BIOS for large amounts
of RAM would help for starters.  There would be enough for a
kernel and utilities to boot, and as the init process was running
a background task could be validating memory and adding it the
kernel pool to be used.  Such an interface to the kernel could
also support switching off chunks of memory if they failed.  You
could then hot swap memory on systems that support it and re-enable
access without downtime.
