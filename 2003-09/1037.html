Hi Brian,

&gt; I am getting 6 or so of these mails daily.

&gt; This was a recent mail hitting the inbox. I am floundering as 
&gt; I don't really understand how come this Windows virus can 
&gt; affecting Linux PC's as well. Are we restricted to just 
&gt; filtering these out or should I be using another strategy ? Brian

Well, you ARE receiving the virus, but certainly, it is not effecting
your linux system like it would a windows system.

All you can really do is to filter them out of your inbox, or manage
them as they arrive - perhaps your procmail recipe could get a bit more
involved, or you could put a virus scanner in the system.

I use a combination of Postfix, amavisd-new, spamassassin, and clamav on
my mail server. It works well, but there is a bit of configuration to so
to get the whole thing working. The result is that I never see a virus
in an inbox, and 90+% of spams are caught as well. Clamav is looking
quite good now, there are over 9600 viruses being scanned for, and there
is an active community working at tracking the latest viruses as they occur.

The difference between a procmail recipe and a scanner, is that the
scanner inspects the attachments and compares them against a database of
viruses, and removes any virus infected email from the spool. 

I guess it depends on how much time and energy you want to spend on
eliminating the problem. For me, I have some win boxes on my networks,
and I can't imagine allowing email through to them that wasn't scanned.
On-system virus scanning with norton etc. is good, but it relies on the
user updating the definitions frequently (and not disabling the scanner,
etc.)

HTH,

Michael
