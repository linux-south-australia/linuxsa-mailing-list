May I intervene on a comment?
"The future is not always the same as the past"
And also the one where many are starting to lose interest about the net,
AND, "space exploration"

I won't comment on technology side of things,( I am not qualified) but the
human race for some reason we seem to be very short-sighted.
What if there was not the goal to profit and absolute control, and may I add
the idiots with thier other obstacles within political circles for the sake
of "front page news"?
What if these things did not hinder progress and technology?
We would not only be on Mars by now, and have robots do our back breaking
chorse, but I think we would have the respect of other aliens in the
universe to offer THEIR brand of coffeee beans, simply out of respect from
our achievments in technology.

Food for thought !

&gt; &gt; To get from the late 60's to here and only be 9 months behind schedule
&gt; &gt; would have to make processor developement one of the best managed
projects

&gt;
&gt; Mark,
&gt;
&gt; I'm saying that from 1985 to now, Moore' law from then to now if 9 months
late
&gt; per 18 months. For every 18 months of those 18 years, the law has been 9
months
&gt; behind. But I'm sure you knew that....
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps I could just comment also that: The future is not always the same
as
&gt; the past. In the 1960's, people genuinely believed that we would be living
and
&gt; working on the Moon and Mars, and that we would have so much leisure
because of
&gt; robots that we would have serious difficulty working out what to do with a
ll
&gt; our spare time. People talked about "educating for leisure". The problem
was
&gt; that too many people just extrapolated past trends too far into the
future,
&gt; like the recent tech bubble. Right now, I'd predict that manufacturers
might
&gt; not bother much with going much faster on CPUs because the market might
just
&gt; not be there. Already I've been reading that the average civilian is
losing
&gt; interest in the Internet just as they did with the hoola hoop and the
yoyo. We
&gt; might be in a golden age without knowing it, just as the Apollo
moon-landing
&gt; era was a golden age, not the beginning of mass migration to other
planets -
&gt; not yet anyway. (Hmmm, I seem to have run out of coffee beans. I'd better
get
&gt; into my nuclear-powered car and get some at the local store. Or maybe I'll
&gt; just take my personal rocket and visit the orbital hypermarket....)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; ak.
