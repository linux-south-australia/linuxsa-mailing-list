Chris,

TCP will not rate limit your download to the slowest "direction" at all.  As
others have explained, the amount of data uploaded while you are downloading
a file is a tiny fraction of the amount you are downloading, hance the fact
that your upload speed is slower does not have an impact on the download
speed.  Example...

Server &lt;--- 100meg Ethernet ---&gt; ISP &lt;--- 1500/256 ADSL ---&gt; You

In this example you'll be able to download at 1500kbps because the server
has a faster internet connection than you do, and the 256k upload channel
won't be filled up by the small amount of data going back to the server.
You may find some instances where you can't download at 1500kbps though,
because you will however be limited to the maximum speed of the slowest pipe
between you and the data you're downloading.  You can only download at
1500kbps is all of the pipes between you and your data are of at least
1500kbps...  Take this example...

Server &lt;--- 128k ISDN ---&gt; ISP &lt;--- 1500/256 ADSL ---&gt; You

Even though you have a 1500k ADSL connection when you try to download data
from the server you'll only be able to download at 128k because thats the
maximum speed that the server can push data through its ISDN link.  Now for
another example...

Server &lt;--- 1500/256 ADSL ---&gt; ISP &lt;--- 1500/256 ADSL ---&gt; You

In this instance you have 1500kbps download, and 256kbps upload, and so does
the server.  So what speed can you download at?  256k, the reason being that
the server can only upload data to its ISP at 256k, therefore the best speed
you can download at from that server is 256k.

Hope that helps.

Jim.

&gt; &gt; It's like this.  1500 down 256 up.  I don't want to go to some
&gt; &gt; website and start downloading a file expecting to get 1500 when all
&gt; &gt; I would really get is 256 because TCP would rate limit me(flow
&gt; &gt; control) because of mp upload speed.  This is just my preference and
&gt; &gt; I guess if it doesn't do that then I am more than happy to go with
&gt; &gt; ADSL but if TCP does do that then barring the cost go with SDSL.  I
&gt; &gt; do understand about all the myriad of things that can go on between
&gt; &gt; me and this website but in theory if that site and myself had
&gt; &gt; unhampered bandwidth then I want 1500 down and 256 up, and I don't
&gt; &gt; want TCP to control my connection to 256/256.  I don't know if it
&gt; &gt; works like I want it too but that is what I want.  Does that make
&gt; &gt; more sense now?  Is it possible to get 1500/256 not 256/256?  I do
&gt; &gt; serve things but that is purely not the issue here.
&gt; 
&gt; i think your a little confused.
 
&gt; hence running at 1500/256 you will still receive packets at up to 1500
&gt; even if what you are sending in reply is equal to or less than 256.

See this is where some get confused at my question.  I am not talking
about the size of the packets.  I am merely talking about the speed.  I
guess it was a bit confusing giving a file size.  I just wanted to know
if TCP itself will rate limit my download to the slowest direction
(upload 256kbps).  I have been told it will but I can't seem to find any
documentation on it.  So I hope that makes it a bit clearer?
