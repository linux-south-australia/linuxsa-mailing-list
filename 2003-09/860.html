David,

At the time, didn't the intel family of CPUs lack an MMU capability?
Until the 386, unix on the PC would have been very difficult surely.
Around about then must have been the 68010-based Sun-2. (My memory of
this is not very reliable because the earliest Sun I used was the Sun-3.)
The 68010 was just able to do the required full stack-save required for
multitasking with MMU page break interrupts, I believe. 
I don't think the Intel family had this kind of full-stack-save and
MMU support in the 80186 and 80286, which is why linux requires a 386.

If this is right, then the price of an IBM-PC with Unix would have been
pushed up into the Sun-2 price range, which would have made it too
costly for the mass market. Also, Unix at that time required a big heap more
memory than small businesses were prepared to pay for a PC.

So what I'm saying is that probably unix on the IBM-PC could not have gotten
off the ground until more like 1988 or so when the 386 system price
started to become more affordable. (In 1988, in our 100-person IT company, only
very few top people had a 386. The accountant was always complaining to me
that his spreadsheets took too long on the 286 with 640k RAM. But he
couldn't make out the "business case" to get a 386 just for himself.)

It would not have been in IBM's interest to develop hardware which could
run unix because it would have taken business away from the mainframe surely.

Just an amateur comment....

Cheers,
ak.
