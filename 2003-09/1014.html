I am sure many have online friends in the U$ofA !
Ask if they are on cable and how much it costs per month.

I was told by one some, it  ranges around $usd15 - 20 per month ?
That includes everything on some deals, everything means TV and football,
( we want the races,to)

Ok, so U$ofA has millions more population, therefore the turnover is another
story.
But hey, if they are the prices over there, and we are paying sooo much over
here, I would put it down
the bean-counters trying to find a way to equal the profits as if we had the
same population?

Come on, what does it  *realy*  cost to run a cable  ?

&gt; &gt; We have cable going past our door but I am reluctant to go down that
&gt; &gt; path.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anybody got anything good to say about being on bigblonde's cable
&gt; &gt; network?
&gt;
&gt; I can't speak from personal experience - I've declined to tap into that
very
&gt; attractive-looking (from a technical viewpoint) cable I can see dangling
&gt; outside my window because I don't concur with Hell$tra's view on what
&gt; constitutes a "value for money" broadband access plan[1]. Of course,
AirNet
&gt; ADSL might not have been the best alternative for me to choose!
&gt;
&gt; A friend who had it until recently (due to moving to a cable/ADSL-deprived
&gt; location) swears by it and constantly ribs me for shunning cable
broadband.
&gt; But $150-odd per Gig excess is bad enough at ADSL speeds, I don't think
I'd
&gt; ever get to sleep at night knowing that someone could throw a few Gig of
&gt; pings at me and I'd be up for a few hundred dollars with no way of
defending
&gt; myself.
&gt;
&gt; However, it is fast. If you're prone to saying "I want that file and I
want
&gt; it NOW!" cable may be just the ticket, if you can manage your connection
&gt; adequately to avoid the potentially bank-breaking excess fees (e.g. having
a
&gt; household full of teenagers may not be the ideal circumstance under which
to
&gt; subscribe to BigPong cable).

&gt; [1] Actually, the plan is not that badly priced, it's the excess data
&gt; charges that deter me. Very strongly.
