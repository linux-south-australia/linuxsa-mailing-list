&gt; Two questions. Keeping in mind to date I have only used Red Hat & Mandrake
&gt; through their GUIs.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Which Linux Distribution(s) are considered practical if limited to a 56K
&gt; dial up modem at home.  This assumes one has performed the initial installation
&gt; from CD on a single fast machine.

As you can tell from other postings on this thread your choice of
distribution can be critical to your ability to work without problems
with linux. I would recommend to stick with what you know. Redhat would
be fine as would Mandrake. All distributions just use essentially the
same linux kernel anyway, with only a few minor differences for various
reasons best explained on the distro's web site.

Also keeping a redhat system secure and up to date with all the latest
security alert errata bugfixed packages is as simple as running the
command up2date -u regularly and you can even set cron to do that
automatically from time to time.

I assume Mandrake has a similar ability but I have no experience with
Mandrake in that regard.

&gt; 
&gt; 2. At work I can setup a machine with a linux distro for Bioinformatic
&gt; research.  This machine would be on a large fast network, & I need to be
&gt; confident that I wouldn't compromise network security.  This machine would
&gt; exist purely to run certain applications only available in Linux (see link
&gt; below).  An increasing number of bioinformatics researchers have two PCs, one
&gt; M$ to communicate with their employer/organisation & one (RH, etc) for their
&gt; research. I'm guessing it would be RH or Mandrake.
&gt; 
&gt; Any guidance appreciated.

Checking that link shows that most of those programs are in .tgz format
which would present no problems anyway on any linux distribution.
Running redhat (or mandrake) as well as windows in the situation you
describe is probably a good plan for your needs. I can't imagine another
machine running linux, if properly maintained, on your work network
would cause any great security concerns.

There would be definate advantages to using the desktop environment
you're familiar with. That is, you can get on with the real work that
much faster and not have to worry about all the trivial and minor (to
you) details of resolving dependancies, and getting the system to
behave, etc.....

If you need to get iso's for any distribution of linux (or BSD) contact
the Community Software Distribution Network. Many of it's members are on
this list. Their "new" website is at <A HREF="http://csdn.auug.org.au">http://csdn.auug.org.au</A>
