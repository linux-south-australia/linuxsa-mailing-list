Not really. It is a question of how do I set up a Linux server to 
manage a Windows network.

I am using this situation as a learning experience as this is similar 
to many other jobs where a Linux server manages a network of Windows 
computers. I would hope that what I am learning from this might be of 
interest to other LinuxSA users who may be exposed to similar 
situations.

While it would be nice to become a Linux zealot we still have to live 
in the real world where people believe that they must have Windows as 
their OS. If we can provide an open source solution for the server then 
we have had a small win. Maybe that small win can be turned into an 
open source desktop solution in the future. We can hope can't we?

So, back to the question, with all the machines operating XP Pro and 
all needing to run varying MS products, how do I manage these policies 
from the e-Smith 6 server? How do I set up these policies on the XP 
machines?

Cheers,  Ian
