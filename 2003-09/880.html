&gt; 
&gt; Are there any prior implementations of this (closed source or otherwise)?

There are a few implementations of dependencies, as they
are an obvious and good idea.  What is missing to date
is a production-quality reimplementation of init, as
only init is in a reliable position to successfully do
parallel start, re-start on fail (for application
init scripts, not just lines in /etc/inittab) and
useful things (such as an API for application watchdogs).

Init is not something which can be re-written lightly.
Even the current init is too bloated for a process
which, if it dies, halts the system.  So we're
really talking about a set of cooperating processes.

On the plus side, the LSB has been making sure the
infrastructure goes into LSB-compliant application
scripts.

&gt; Surely some OS manufacturer has come up with it...

There's less motivation for closed-source OSs.  You go to
the person in the company that hands these things out and
ask for a boot sequence number.

There are also forces pushing down the boot time on Linux
which don't apply to other UNIX-like operating systems
(use on laptops, telco desire for 99.999% availability,
use in embedded systems).
