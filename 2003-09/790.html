At least you were given the option of not using the service (IE).

I was reading through some ICANN At-Large email archives, and someone
suggested:

"Thinking about specific problems with sitefinder, here's a mail loss
scenario: A site (a.net) is using a server in a different domain
(b.net) as its backup MX. That server's domain expires and goes into
the redemption grace period, or does not have any explicit name
servers listed in the TLD zone for some other reason.

Image a.net's mail server is unreachable for a short period of time,
because of maintenance. In the pre-Sitefinder world, e-mail for
a.net would be queued up, since the backup MX can't be found. In the
world according to Sitefinder, e-mail to a.net is directed to
Verisign's "Snubby Mail Rejector Daemon", and (to the extent that
Snubby works as intended) discarded.

&gt; I don't understand how this is any different to the way Internet

&gt; perspective). I know, the implementation is markedly different and it
&gt; only affected IE users, but the end result is the same and IE makes up
&gt; ~92% of the browser population.  One could argue that MS were also using
&gt; their might and dominance to unfair advantage in wiring up their browser
&gt; this way, so why weren't MS sued in a similar fashion?  
&gt; 
&gt; BTW I'm not arguing, just throwing some more fuel in  :)
