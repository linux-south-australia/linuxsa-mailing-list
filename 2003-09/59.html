&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt;      Does anyone on this list know what the frequency is that plays
&gt; between tracks on a CD?  If you know that what is the name of that
&gt; frequency?  I have this minidisc recorder and it will pick up the
&gt; frequency or whatever it is that plays between tracks when I use a
&gt; normal CD player for it's input.  I have quite a number of music files
&gt; .wav, .mp3, .ogg, ... etc. that I would like to record onto it.  However
&gt; my problem exists when I use xmms to play the music file as the input
&gt; for the minidisc recorder.  It does not pick up that frequency because
&gt; it was most likely never recorded with the song(arguably, as it should
&gt; be).  There is a plugin for xmms that allows me to run something after a
&gt; music file is played.  If I can figure out the frequency then I might be
&gt; able to make it automatically "mark" the tracks on the minidisc
&gt; recorder.  I am hoping that someone will have thoughts on this.  Any
&gt; info on this or relevant links to the info I am looking for will help
&gt; greatly...
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Chris-

A frequency between tracks? not so far as I know. at the start of the disc 
there's a table of contents, that's where any CD player will find out how 
many tracks, when they start, how long they go for, etc.
If there actually is a sound between tracks, I sould suspect that it's a 
'null' sound, when no real signal is going through. Maybe a little line 
noise, if anything.

if you're getting the CD as one single track, then you're using the wrong xmms 
input plugin. any CD player or plugin (except for the ones designed to treat 
is as oneentity) or whatever should be able to give you each track on the CD 
individually

HTH,
Adam
