This came in my mailbox the other day. I thought there might
 be a few here who may be interested in going. Sounds good.

AIIA SA - IT Education Breakfast Forum
Marketing ICT Education and Careers

 During the IT boom period, we had a skills shortage crisis
 and it was NOT difficult to get people interested in
 studying ICT and choosing a career in IT. There were plenty
 of jobs and high salaries. 

 So, how difficult is it now during the current downturn? Can
 we learn anything from how other industries successfully
 market their products? Is marketing Coke any different to
 marketing IT Education or Training? It seems there is a
 generally held view that the inherent 'goodness' (and
 'worth') of education sells itself and there is no need to
 market ICT courses and even if we were to market ICT courses
 it wouldn't improve things.

 Join the AIIA Education and Skills Committee at a special
 Forum that will be led by a panel of expert, experienced,
 marketing professionals who will provide their suggestions
 on how best to market ICT education and careers based on
 their experience marketing well-known retail products like
 Coca-Cola, Fosters, Smiths Crisps, etc.

Speakers:
 Mr Raju Nadaran - Manager Marketing, Foursticks International
 Raju has over 17 years of marketing and general management
 experience in India and Australia. He has shown considerable
 success in the development of new businesses through the
 application of strategic marketing techniques.
 
 Mr Ian Pearson - Principal, Marketing Taskforce
 Ian has some 30 years of experience in the computing and
 telecommunications industries. With international experience
 Ian has provided marketing advice to a number of Australian
 businesses including, Hewlett Packard, Philips, Fujitsu,
 Raytheon, IBM, Xerox, Sperry Univac, National Panasonic,
 Oce, Honeywell, Cincom, MSA and Memorex.
 
 Mr Andrew Robertson - Director, Andrew Robertson Marketing
 and Consulting Pty Ltd
 Andrew has a broad range of marketing experience across a
 number of industries categories including aged care, arts,
 automotive, education, financial services, food, gaming,
 government, hospitality, IT, manufacturing, media, package
 goods, property, retail and wine. Andrew has enjoyed wide
 recognition for his achievements and success in the
