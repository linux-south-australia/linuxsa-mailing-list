&gt; Currently we use Intuit's Quickbooks Pro. 
&gt;If there is some form of Linux app that can do this job of 
&gt;bookkeeping including GST tracking? If so then let the migration begin ;-)

I don't know of any Linux app which can do all of this as well as
Quickbooks,
however if this ends up being the only app which you need to port across to
your new Linux desktop, then have a look at Crossover Office
(www.codeweavers.com).
I currently use it to run Quicken at home, have been for some time and have
been very
happy with it.  (The current release doesn't officially support Quickbooks,
however
if you give it a shot I daresay it will work fine)

The other option you have for something like this is Win4lin or Vmware.
Personally
I'd recommend Win4lin first as Vmware is more hardware hungry and for one or
two
applications is overpriced (though it's superb software for running more
than one
OS concurrently on the same PC should you desire to do so)
