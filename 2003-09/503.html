Oh let me eat my words.

The Samsung external modem went on today. Not a blink of recognition. 
Nothing. All I ever got were 2 lights, CS and MR.

e_Smith would not even discover that a modem was there.

I checked the scripts and spotted that it ran diald.

I ran diald then diald debug 0x0008 (to put it into verbose mode).
Nothing.

I ran diald -daemon (so I could see the transactions.
Nothing.

It didn't matter what I tried or ll I got back was the prompt, nothing 
happened.

I did a new trick for me, I RTFM. First then Second and third and 
fourth times in case there was something there I missed. Nope. I could 
not see why or how diald was failing.

I tried to look at other configs and other man pages but nothing rang 
bells for me.

Hours of fruitless searching later I rang for DSL but he was out. I 
left messages for others but they were unavailable. I switched it all 
off and came home.

This user is begging for help. I have to defeat this problem so I can 
get back to doing my own jobs. HEEEELLLP!!!

Cheers,  Ian
