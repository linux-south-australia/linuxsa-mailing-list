Thanks Andrew

This is the current set-up at home.
I am on a pension due to work injuries, and cannot pratice my trade, so I
now have the time to learn something else.
There is no hurry.

BAGGAGE:
4 pc's,
3 are under a wooden bench made from pine to fit the box's.squarly
and to have access to the cables ( lots of cables)

BOX #1 CPU 400 Mhz,  256 RAM
HDD #1 10 GIG !
 "Officialy" now the  F/WALL with a removable HDD caddy.
(That PC Box used to be the old Box for WINx's.)

That is how bad WINx's became for me, I literaly needed (identical) 2
removable HDD's because of crashes and this caused delays and downtime for
what I wanted to do. I'm actualy 3-4 years behind schedule, thanks to
MS,Script Kiddies and everythhing else that used MS exploitable holes. PLUS,
a stream of USD$49.95's Windows fix it's.
If one crashed, replace with the other HDD, fix the one that crashed, in
time before the other crashed.
Had working to a Tee and perfectly timed ! YES !!!
:-)
Yeah right.

Box # 1 HDD #1  is where I have been experimenting all along with Linux 8.0
install disk sets.
I believe the the PC is too slow for a full install, will do for now till I
sort out the mess.

HDD # 2
BOX #1
  Still has win 98 SE, but has become inaccessable, it will boot up, but
won't go as past the windows welcome message. It's stuck, and most of my
needed files are in there. I have to get to them somehow, one day.

Most importantly, it has a 2 programs where I once had to ring the vendor to
quote the random "new install" 4 digit number, and he would have quoted me
another 4 didgits to enter, so I can use the program. All that is stuck in
there to, and the vendor has left the country ! So I now cannot get another
4 digits if I do another re-install. And by the way, he became very arrogant
the lat time I rang for the numbers, he only gave them to me becuase I
threatened to have his program CRACKED if he refused.
He then gave me the numbers I needed without further question, but that was
the last I heard of him.
It's in VB C++ or something. It's been crakced before but I lost the cracked
version thanks to MS and the "blue screen of virtual re-incarnations"

BOX # 2
486
DOS 6.0
is the prototype for a program I helped develop, but that program was
written in Assembly lingo.
The program is now useless since Sept. 1 2003.
It used to feed from data and the contracts are now ended with the vendors
of the data scource.

BOX # 3
HDD # 1
1.7 CPU
XP PRO
I am still "in business", we knew this was coming to an end with the old
versions.
The XP  has the upgraded version of the  original assembly language version.
CAN ONLY RUN  in XP Pro O.S.
CAN NOT TAMPER WITH THIS. BUT HAS TO HAVE THE F/WALL and  LAN.
All done and working.

BOX # 3
HDD # 2
XP PRO
Current and using it now with LAN
Goal: #1
Partition and install the rest of Linux ,eventualy.

Goal: #2
New Box # 5
for Xmas, need new PC  to continue the project I am working on.

BOX # 4
But I bought the scource code and the obsolete compiler for the proto-type
in assembly lingo.
All that needs doing to get the proto-types up and running again is the
break off the section of the old data feed input, and set it up on LAN and
covert the data feed from the same scource as the new version !!
This is not a urgent thing, it's just hobby stuff to keep it "alive".
By the way, the assembly language version has not missed a beat since 1996
when I first bought the program.
It will be sadly missed.

Pete

&gt; Pete,
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I now need to look at the choice of web browsers and email to eventually
&gt; &gt;replace IE and Outlook
&gt;
&gt; Do you really use outlook at home? (are you talking about your home
&gt; network?) ...Any way, Evolution is a good replacement for outlook. You
might
&gt; consider using the mail agent with Mozilla. Otherwise KMail is good.
&gt;
&gt; Konqueror is a nice browser. It works faster than Mozilla on my laptop (I
&gt; can explain this but can't be bothered right now).
&gt;
&gt; Go nuts and try them all out for your self... Its fun.
&gt;
&gt; AG.
