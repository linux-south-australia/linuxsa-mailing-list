<H1>GPL Project Funding & Speakfree End of Life Announcement</H1>

Once again, I am going to parrot the same old story:

GPL Software needs to be funded, and should be publicly funded as a 
first choice. The best way to do this is to set up a not for profit 
organization, collect donations, and pay developers.

All this stuff has to be funded to be maintained properly, and Linux' 
fundamental design has to be completely revamped to a more intuitive 
design, if Linux is going to be viable on the desktop. But there are 
always too many objections and not enough support, so at times, it feels 
like Linux desktop development is one of the top 10 worst jobs in 
science, due to the futility of it all:

In the meantime, Bill Gates is the richest man in America:

And I have these 
concerns:<A HREF="http://lists.svlug.org/archives/svlug/2003-September/045565.html">http://lists.svlug.org/archives/svlug/2003-September/045565.html</A>

Sorry about the word wrap, sometimes I get stuck on webmail.

So anyway,

Here is the announcement from the speakfree developer: 
<A HREF="http://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/eol/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/speakfree/eol/</A>

Abstracts:

&gt; The fate of most free software projects is "abandonware"--the 
&gt; developer loses interest, burns out, or becomes occupied with other 
&gt; projects and simply leaves the software as-is. In fact, this happened 
&gt; with Speak Freely a few years ago, and the consequences were distasteful.


&gt; To continue development and maintenance of Speak Freely, the program 
&gt; requires a top to bottom rewrite, basing the Unix and Windows version 
&gt; on an identical "engine," and providing an application programming 
&gt; interface (API) which permits other programs to be built upon it. I 
&gt; estimate the work involved in this task, simply to reach the point 
&gt; where a program built with the new architecture is 100% compatible 
&gt; with the existing Speak Freely, would require between 6 and 12 
&gt; man-months. There is no prospect whatsoever that I will have time of 
&gt; that magnitude to devote to Speak Freely in the foreseeable future, 
&gt; and no indication that any other developer qualified to do the job and 
&gt; sufficiently self-motivated and -disciplined to get it done exists. In 
&gt; fact, the history of Speak Freely constitutes what amounts to a 
&gt; non-existence proof of candidate developers.
&gt;
&gt; Even if I had the time to invest in Speak Freely, or another developer 
&gt; or group of developers volunteered to undertake the task, the 
&gt; prospects for such a program would not justify the investment of time.
&gt;
