&gt;I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town.
&gt;Yes, I got a good woman, name of Amber Brown.
&gt;Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher and she weigh 500 pound.
&gt;
&gt;She wanted to go to Nashville, made me go out and buy a car.
&gt;Yes, she wanted to go to Nashville so she made me buy a car.
&gt;She made me buy a Beemer cause she said we had to fly far.
&gt;
&gt;Drove that Sports Utility Vehicle to the local heliport.
&gt;Where our state-sponsored private executive heli-jet, which we had recently bought,
&gt;was waiting on hot standby, or least that's what we thought.
&gt;
&gt;Seems our pilot, who went bald last year, got his-self a broken leg.
&gt;He was skiing out on Lake Geneva when a 'gator bit his peg.
&gt;If only he'd gone to Waikiki he never woulda been dead.
&gt;
&gt;Got to the local heliport, no jet was waiting there.
&gt;Yes, we got to the local heliport and our jet it wasn't there.
&gt;So we went to Tiffany's new gallery opening, at the Yale Law School fair.
&gt;
&gt;The lighting there was wrong.  It made us feel so blue.
&gt;Yes, the lighting was all wrong for us we felt uncool and blue.
&gt;That's why I sip this Chardonnay and tell my tale to you.
