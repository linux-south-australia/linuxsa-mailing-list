I quite agree with this.


&gt; Telstra aren't going to undertake vast infrastructure developments
&gt; continually whilst the competitive framework is untenable, why would you
&gt; invest in infrastructure if you have to give access to the competition
&gt; cheaper than you're allowed to sell it in a retail market

This I don't agree with.  The local loop is a natural monopoly, which
Telstra can run as a separate business unit.  They should be able to sell
access on the same basis to other telcos, as they do to their own carriage
divisions.  Unfortunately they use their privilege position, as owner of
this legacy, to give their other business units a competitive advantage.
Maybe they sell access to the local loop too cheaply to their carriage
divisions; maybe they gouge the competition; either way they can and
must invest in continuous improvement to this singular resource.

I notice Telstra are buying back $1B of their issued stock.  I wonder
if that's a pre-cursor to spinning off the local loop as a separate
corporation.  Here's hoping!
