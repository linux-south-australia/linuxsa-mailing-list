&gt; We have just become the 'help' guys for a community org
&gt; trying to wire up their computer room. The room has 10 boxes
&gt; running XP etc. The server is now running Mandrake 9.1.

&gt;
&gt; Today we upgraded from Manduck 9.0 to 9.1. Now we cant even
&gt; get a successful log in, all we get are validation errors.
&gt;
Are they using PAP authentication ? check your PAP secrets file for 
correct username and password.

&gt; We suspect part of today's errors may be caused by the ISP
&gt; (SENet) but they don't support Linux so we are in a
&gt; desperate search for a soft part of the wall to bang our
&gt; heads against unless we can get this beast online in the
&gt; next few days.
&gt;
&gt; Any clues on what we should be doing/ using/ looking
&gt; for/testing with etc?
&gt;
&gt; Oh, I should add that we have to put up with an infernal
&gt; modem but a quick download corrected that incompatibility
&gt; and it is now dialling fine, just getting nowhere fast...

Wvdial may be helpful in negotiating with the other end and starting 
ppp.  It  got me onto ihug quicker than kppp and you can see the log of 
events.

Suggestion. Log onto the site with another working PC that does "dial 
up" to confirm that it will work. Also you could try ringing the number 
with a handset and confirm that you are getting a modem on the other 
end. Look closely at the files in /etc/ppp and check them against a PC 
that is dialing successfully into that number. Maybe someone who is 
using senet could help with this. Alternatively, borrow a working 
external modem to help in your diagnosis.

Validation of authentication errors imply that you are close. The system 
is wanting to connect. You are absolutely shure about your username and 
password, and that your account has time on it.
