It looks like the SCO invoices are on their way soon.

"SCO prepares to send invoices for Linux"
<A HREF="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,39116080,00.htm">http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,39116080,00.htm</A>

Sample:
=========================================================
The company announced in August that it wants corporations to buy Unix licenses
for using the Linux operating system, asking $699 (about £445) for a
single-processor Linux server. But on Tuesday, SCO spokesman Blake Stowell said
the company will begin the more active approach of sending invoices requesting
payment to commercial Linux users, "probably some time this month."

Sending invoices, while a more-aggressive move, still stops short of the kind
of legal action the company has threatened before. In July, SCO chief executive
Darl McBride described the licensing programme as "a solution that... gets you
square with the use of Linux, without having to go to the courtroom."

SCO will pursue commercial Linux users who have discussed their Linux work
publicly, Stowell said. However, it won't take action until it's done more
research on those businesses, he added.
[...]

Stowell said the invoices mark an intermediate stage in SCO's efforts to get a
company to pay up, before taking it to court.

"We're not planning on... suing some commercial user of Linux from the start,"
he said. "We'll give ample opportunities to get the licence before we do that."

The companies to which SCO sends invoices are likely to be high on its list of
candidates for lawsuits, according to Quandt.

This has a nice linux penguin graphic.
This article seems to be a subset of the zdnet article.

This seems to be a clone of the zdnet article.
