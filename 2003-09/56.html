Hello,

     Does anyone on this list know what the frequency is that plays
between tracks on a CD?  If you know that what is the name of that
frequency?  I have this minidisc recorder and it will pick up the
frequency or whatever it is that plays between tracks when I use a
normal CD player for it's input.  I have quite a number of music files
.wav, .mp3, .ogg, ... etc. that I would like to record onto it.  However
my problem exists when I use xmms to play the music file as the input
for the minidisc recorder.  It does not pick up that frequency because
it was most likely never recorded with the song(arguably, as it should
be).  There is a plugin for xmms that allows me to run something after a
music file is played.  If I can figure out the frequency then I might be
able to make it automatically "mark" the tracks on the minidisc
recorder.  I am hoping that someone will have thoughts on this.  Any
info on this or relevant links to the info I am looking for will help
greatly...

Thanks,

Chris-
