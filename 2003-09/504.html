You've tried the modem on another PC and/or tried with a program like 
minicom, hyperterminal etc to talk to the modem?

Has the modem ever been proven to work?  ditto for the cable?

&gt; Oh let me eat my words.
&gt; 
&gt; The Samsung external modem went on today. Not a blink of recognition. 
&gt; Nothing. All I ever got were 2 lights, CS and MR.
&gt; 
&gt; e_Smith would not even discover that a modem was there.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked the scripts and spotted that it ran diald.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran diald then diald debug 0x0008 (to put it into verbose mode).
&gt; Nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; I ran diald -daemon (so I could see the transactions.
&gt; Nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; It didn't matter what I tried or ll I got back was the prompt, nothing 
&gt; happened.
&gt; 
&gt; I did a new trick for me, I RTFM. First then Second and third and 
&gt; fourth times in case there was something there I missed. Nope. I could 
&gt; not see why or how diald was failing.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to look at other configs and other man pages but nothing rang 
&gt; bells for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Hours of fruitless searching later I rang for DSL but he was out. I 
&gt; left messages for others but they were unavailable. I switched it all 
&gt; off and came home.
&gt; 
&gt; This user is begging for help. I have to defeat this problem so I can 
&gt; get back to doing my own jobs. HEEEELLLP!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
