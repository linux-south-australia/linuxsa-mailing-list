&gt; &gt; There are also forces pushing down the boot time on Linux
&gt; &gt; which don't apply to other UNIX-like operating systems
&gt; &gt; (use on laptops, telco desire for 99.999% availability,
&gt; &gt; use in embedded systems).
&gt; 
&gt; There is another very fruitful thing to try for speeding up boot times
&gt; and that is to throw out the BIOS. I care about this because some of my
&gt; systems are either quite slow or have to be rebooted very frequently,
&gt; being part of a simulated systems network.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone that runs an Intel with an expensive SCSI system, will be aware
&gt; that minutes of boot time can be consumed by BIOS operations. Most but
&gt; not all things that the BIOS sets up are completely ignored by modern
&gt; operating systems, which do checking and setup of their own as the
&gt; drivers interrogate the PCI/I2O/whatever bus and come to their own
&gt; conclusions.
&gt; 
&gt; That problem has been addressed by the LinuxBIOS project,
&gt; <A HREF="http://linuxbios.org.">http://linuxbios.org.</A>  It is a port of Linux to flashable firmware. Runs
&gt; on x86 and x86-64 and PPC, formerly on Alpha but I don't think it works
&gt; any more (so much so I don't dare try it on my Alpha at home just in
&gt; case... :-) I've seen five or seconds from power-on to the boot sector
&gt; being run and people who run clusters and know how to tune it report
&gt; even lower numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; You can use this to boot Linux, Windows (not sure if it does XP) and at
&gt; least OpenBSD. I'd like to know if anyone has booted other BSDs using
&gt; this, I've only got so much time to try things out.

noted - i have a compaq laptop - they have software bios. oops, wiped
that sucker - and speedier boot than a desktop of similar specs:)
