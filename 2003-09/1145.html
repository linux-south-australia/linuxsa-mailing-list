&gt; Exactly.  It's about more than just websites.

I know that.  I realise why people, including myself, are hostile to the
'service', but my question, which was really directed at David Lloyd,
was what is it about their web terms and conditions that he has a problem
with.  I surely hope that they get shut down, but I don't think saying,
"I don't agree with your web T&C yet I can't avoid using it," will get
far because you can avoid using their SiteFinder.  You just don't use it.

Obviously there are a whole raft of other issues, such as them hijacking
private and confidential email, but that's nothing to do with their
SiteFinder T&C, is it?  Before making a public fuss, I think it's a
good idea to ensure that what you plan to say actually makes sense,
and hence my question was, by way of Devil's Advocacy, intended to give
him a chance to test his complaint.

So how about it, David: What is it about their SiteFinder service that
makes you unable to just not use it?
