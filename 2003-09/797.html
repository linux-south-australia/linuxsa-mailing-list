&gt; It's not lawful to force someone to accept these terms and conditions when
that someone has not requested such a service.

In what way is it not lawful, though? I'm not being a troll but I'm curious
as to exactly which laws they're breaking. You may not 'want' to access
their terms and conditions (I wouldn't either) but what law says that you
don't *have* to?

Ben,

&gt; "10. Sole Remedy.
&gt; YOUR USE OF THE VERISIGN SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. IF YOU ARE
&gt; DISSATISFIED WITH ANY OF THE MATERIALS, RESULTS OR OTHER CONTENTS OF THE 
&gt; VERISIGN SERVICES OR WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR PRIVACY 
&gt; STATEMENT, OR OTHER POLICIES, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF 
&gt; THE VERISIGN SERVICES OR OUR SITE."

But I refuse to accept their terms and conditions. It's not lawful to force
someone to accept these terms and conditions when that someone has not
requested such a service. I don't agree with *any* of their terms and
conditions.

I don't agree with it *at all*.

Therefore, I have asked them to take it down. The alternative is that they
come up with a set of terms and conditions that I will agree to, however I
doubt they'd accept the terms and conditions that I would _propose_ to them.
