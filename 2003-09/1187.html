I got a good woman, with the meanest face in town.
Yes, I got a good woman, name of Amber Brown.
Got teeth like Margaret Thatcher and she weigh 500 pound.

She wanted to go to Nashville, made me go out and buy a car.
Yes, she wanted to go to Nashville so she made me buy a car.
She made me buy a Beemer cause she said we had to fly far.

Drove that Sports Utility Vehicle to the local heliport.
Where our state-sponsored private executive heli-jet, which we had recently bought,
was waiting on hot standby, or least that's what we thought.

Seems our pilot, who went bald last year, got his-self a broken leg.
He was skiing out on Lake Geneva when a 'gator bit his peg.
If only he'd gone to Waikiki he never woulda been dead.

Got to the local heliport, no jet was waiting there.
Yes, we got to the local heliport and our jet it wasn't there.
So we went to Tiffany's new gallery opening, at the Yale Law School fair.

The lighting there was wrong.  It made us feel so blue.
Yes, the lighting was all wrong for us we felt uncool and blue.
That's why I sip this Chardonnay and tell my tale to you.
