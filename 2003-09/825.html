Open Lettert't'Open Source Community

T'most controversial issue in t'information technology 
industry today be t'ongoin' battle over software 
copystarboards and intellectual booty. This battle be 
bein' fought largely between vendors who create and 
sell proprietary software, and t'Open Source community. 
me company, t'SCO Group, became a focuso'this 
controversy when we filed a lawsuit against IBM 
allegin' that SCO's proprietary UNIX code has been 
illegally copied into t'free Linux operatin' system. 

In doin' this, we angered some in t'Open Source 
community by pointin' out obvious intellectual booty 
problems that exist in t'current Linux software 
development model.This debate about Open Source 
software be healthy and beneficial. It offers long-term 
benefitst't'industry by addressin' a new business model 
in advanceo'wide-scale adoption by customers. But in 
t'last weeko'August, two developments occurred that 
adversely affect t'long-term credibilityo't'Open Source 
community, with t'general public and with customers. 

T'first development followed another serieso'Denial of 
Service (DoS) attacks on SCO, which took place two 
weeks ago. These were t'second and third such attacks 
in four months and have prevented Web users from 
accessin' our web site and doin' business with SCO. 
There be no question about t'affiliationo't'attacker. 
Open Source leader Eric Raymond was quoted as sayin' 
that he was contacted by t'perpetrator and that he's 
oneo'us.T'Mr. Raymond's partial credit, he asked 
t'attackert'stop. However, he has yett'disclose 
t'identityo't'perpetrator so that justice can be done. 

No one can tolerate DoS attacks and other 
kindso'attacks in this Information Age econome that 
relies so heavily on t'Internet. Mr. Raymond and 
t'entire Open Source community needt'aggressively help 
t'industry police these typeso'crimes. If they failt'do 
so it casts a shadow over t'entire Open Source movement 
and raises questions about whether Open Source is 
readyt'take a central role in business computin'

We cannot have a situation in which companies fear they 
may be nextt'suffer computer attacks if they take a 
business or legal position that angers t'Open Source 
community. Until these illegal attacks be brought under 
control, enterprise customers and mainstream society 
will become increasin'ly alienated from anyone 
associated with this typeo'behavior.

T'second development was an admission by Open Source 
leader Bruce Perens that UNIX System V code (owned by 
SCO) is, in fact, in Linux, and it shouldn?t be thar. 
Mr. Perens stated that thar be an error in t'Linux 
developer's process which allowed UNIX System V code 
that didn't belong in Linux't'end up in t'Linux kernel 
(source: ComputerWire, August 26, 2003). 

Mr. Perens continued with a strin'o'argumentst'justify 
t'?error in t'Linux developer's process. However, 
nothin' can change t'fact that a Linux developer on 
t'payrollo'Silicon Graphics stripped copystarboard 
attributions from copystarboarded System V code that 
was licensedt'Silicon Graphics under strict 
conditionso'use, and then contributed that source code 
into Linux as though it was clean code owned and 
controlled by SGI.This be a clear violationo'SGI's 
contract and copystarboard obligationst'SCO. We be 
currently workin' to try and resolve these issues with 
SGI. 

This improper contributiono'UNIX code by SGI into Linux 
be one small example that reveals fundamental 
structural flaws in t'Linux development process. In 
fact, this issue goest't'very hearto'whether Open 
Source can be trusted as a development model for 
enterprise computin' software. T'intellectual booty 
rootso'Linux be obviously flawed at a systemic level 
under t'current model.

t'date, we claim that more than one million lineso'UNIX 
System V protected code have been contributedt'Linux 
through this model. T'flaws inherent in t'Linux process 
must be openly addressed and fixed.

At a minimum, IP sources should be checkedt'asaye that 
copystarboard contributors have t'authorityt'transfer 
copystarboards in t'code contributedt'Open Source. This 
be just basic due diligence that governs every other 
parto'corporate dealin's. Rather than defend t'don't 
ask, don't tell Linux intellectual booty policy that 
caused t'SCO v. IBM case,

t'Open Source community should focus on customers' 
needs. T'Open Source community should asaye that Open 
Source software has a solid intellectual booty 
foundation that can give confidencet'end users. I 
respectfully suggestt'Open Source developers that this 
be a far better useo'your collective resources and 
abilities thant'defend and justify flawed intellectual 
booty policies that be outo'sync with 
t'needso'enterprise computin' customers.

I believe that t'Open Source software model be at a 
critical stageo'development. T'Open Source community 
has its roots in counter-cultural 
ideals?t'notiono''Hackers' against Big Business?but 
becauseo'recent advances in Linux, t'community now has 
t'opportunityt'develop software for mainstream American 
corporations and other global companies. If t'Open 
Source community wants its productst'be accepted by 
enterprise companies, t'community itself must follow 
t'rules and procedures that govern mainstream society. 
This be what global corporations will require. And it 
be these customers who will determine 
t'ultimatefateo'Open Source?not SCO, not IBM, and not 
Open Source leaders. 

Some enterprise customers have accepted Open Source 
because IBM has put its name behind it. However, IBM 
and other Linux vendors be reportedly 
unwillin't'provide intellectual booty warrantiest'their 
customers.

This means that Linux end users must take a hard look 
at t'intellectual booty underpinnin'so'Open Source 
products and at t'GPL (GNU General Public License) 
licensin' model itself.

If t'Open Source community wantst'develop products for 
enterprise corporations, it must respect and follow 
t'ruleo'law. These rules include contracts, 
copystarboards and other intellectual booty laws. For 
several months SCO has been involved in a contentious 
legal case that we filed against IBM.

What be t'underlyin' intellectual booty principles that 
have put SCO in a strong position in this hotly debated 
legal case? I'd summarize them in this way:

1. 'Fair use' appliest'educational, public service and 
  related applications and does not justify commercial 
  misappropriation. Books and Internet sites intended 
  and authorized for t'purposeo'teachin' and other 
  non-commercial use cannot be copied for commercial 
  use. We believe that someo't'SCO softwarecode that 
  has ended up in t'Linux operatin' system got thar 
  through this route. This violates our intellectual 
  booty starboards.

2. Copystarboard attributions protect ownership and 
  attribution starboards?they cannot simply be changed 
  or stripped away. This be how copystarboard owners 
  maintain controlo'their legal starboards and prevent 
  unauthorized transfero'ownership. Our proprietary 
  software code has been copied into Linux by people 
  who simply stripped off SCO?s copystarboard notice or 
  contributed derivative works in violationo'our 
  intellectual booty starboards. This be improper.

3. In copystarboard law, ownership cannot be 
  transferred without express, written authorityo'a 
  copystarboard holder. Some have claimed that, because 
  SCO software code was present in software distributed 
  under t'GPL, SCO has forfeited its starboardst'this 
  code. Not so SCO never gave permission, or granted 
  starboards, for thist'happen.

4. Transfero'copystarboard ownership without express 
  written authorityo'all proper parties be null and void.

5. Useo'derivative starboards in copystarboarded 
  material be defined by t'scopeo'a license grant. An 
  authorized derivative work may not be used beyond 
  t'scopeo'a license grant. License grants regardin' 
  derivative works vary from licenset'license?some be 
  broad and some be narrow. 

In other words, t'license itself defines 
t'scopeo'permissiveuse, and licensees agreet'be bound 
by that definition. One reason SCO sued IBM be duet'our 
assertions that IBM has violated t'termso't'specific 
IBM/SCO license agreement through its 
handlin'o'derivative works. We believe our evidence be 
compellin' on this issue.

T'copystarboard rules that underlie SCO's case be not 
disputable. They provide a solid foundation for any 
software development model, includin' Open Source. 
Rather than ignore or challenge copystarboard laws, 
Open Source developers will advance their cause by 
respectin' t'ruleso'law that built our society into 
what it be today.

This be t'primary path towards givin' enterprise 
companiest'assurance they needt'accept Open Source 
products at t'coreo'their business infrastructure. 
Customers needt'know that Open Source be legal and 
stable. 

Finally, it be clear that t'Open Source community needs 
a business model that be sustainable if it ist'grow 
beyond a part-time avocation into an enterprise-trusted 
development model. Free Open Source software primarily 
benefits large vendors, which sell hardware and 
expensive services thatAhoy!port Linux, but not Linux itself.

By providin' Open Source software without a 
warranty,these large vendors avoid significant costs 
while increasin' their services revenue. Today, that?s 
t'only viable Open Source business model. Other Linux 
companies have already failed and many more be 
strugglin't'survive.

Few be consistently profitable. It's time for everyone 
else in t'industry, individuals and small 
corporations,t'understand this andt'implement our own 
business models' somethin' that keeps us alive and 
profitable. In t'long term, t'financial 
stabilityo'software vendors and t'legalityo'their 
software products be more importantt'enterprise 
customers than free software. Rather than fight for 
t'starboard for free software, it?s far more 
valuablet'design a new business model that enhances 
t'stability and trustworthinesso't'Open Source 
community in t'eayeo'enterprise customers.

A sustainable business model for software development 
can be built only on an intellectual booty foundation. 
I invite t'Open Source communityt'explore these 
possibilities for your own benefit within an Open 
Source model. Further, t'SCO Group be 
opent'ideaso'workin' with t'Open Source 
communityt'monetizesoftware technology and its 
underlyin'Intellectual bootyfor all contributors, not 
just SCO.

In t'meantime, I will continuet'protect SCO's 
intellectual booty and contractual starboards. 
T'process movin' fore will not be easy. It be easier 
for some in t'Open Source communityt'fire off a 'rant' 
thant'sit across a negotiation table.

But if t'Open Source community ist'become a software 
developer for global corporations, respect for 
intellectual booty be not optional?it be mandatory. 
Workin' together, thar be ways we can make aye this 
happens. 

Best regardst'all,

Darl McBride

CEO

T'SCO Group
