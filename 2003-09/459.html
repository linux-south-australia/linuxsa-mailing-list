&gt; &gt; Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor : 2 of our Windows servers and none of our Linux
&gt; &gt; servers have KB/Mouse/Monitor. Administration of our Win Servers is done
&gt; &gt; with VNC.
&gt; 
&gt; Terminal Services works too... but as a general rule you still need access to 
&gt; a keyboard video and mouse, I don't even use a KVM/or dedicated KB/Monitor to 
&gt; install with on Linux :-)

But on a Windows network, even with Terminal Services, you can't open up
one system to the Internet, and then log onto that, and then log onto other
systems around your internal network.

With SSH, you can open up ssh on one machine, and then move around to
others (assuming of course you structure your firewall rules sensibly :-))

&gt; &gt; Backup : not much good backing up just your smb.conf file if it is a file
&gt; &gt; and print server is it. Surely you need to back up the data also ?
&gt; 
&gt; My guess is yes :-) thats easy too... I can do it in 1 line on the console or 
&gt; in cron or for a more complex environment a small shell script :-) without 
&gt; buying yet another expensive piece of software to do it for me. By the way 
&gt; this was not my argument, but the back up of server config isn't as easy in 
&gt; Windows, which I'm sure was the point.

Or you could use a range of Open Source software to manage your backup
stragegy, such as Amanda.  With a product like that you don't need to rely
on the functionality of a GUI to backup or restore your files, which means
things like this can be easily scripted, too.  You could even develop a
front-end system to a package like this which let your users restore their
own files (assuming they have the correct permissions) or something like
that.

The flexibility of the Unix environment allows you to tell your server what
you can and can't do, unlike Windows which has this functionality only
semi-built in.  Sure Windows has a VBS language which is fairly powerful
and allows you to interact with Windows' componentry, but try getting it to
do something simple, like run a third party program and then do a grep and
an awk and using the results for something productive, without having to
think about things like:

1) Downloading POSIX tools to do the job,
2) Finding a non-standard path for these tools to live in
   (Windows has no /usr/local/bin)
3) Remembering that now these tools don't exist on any other servers in
   your network except this.

Now try putting these values into the Windows Performance Monitor for
graphing.  I'm sure that's easy.

&gt; &gt; I would certainly prefer using Linux/SAMBA servers for F&P as overall Linux
&gt; &gt; provides a lot more flexibility, but where it falls down is extended
&gt; &gt; attributes / permissions of files and folders and groups. This is really
&gt; &gt; easy in Windows but can be a pain in Linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; ACLs would be a nice thing in Linux agreed :-) one of the few things I like 
&gt; about Windows 2000 Server

There are plenty of file systems about with ACL support.  I used Samba
2.2.8 on a system running FreeBSD with an ext3 file system, but you could
use XFS or another choice.  Backup programs are also capable of backing up
these ACLs with your file system, and the ACLs will apply to either Windows
or Unix users, and they're compatible with your owner/group/everyone
permissions.
