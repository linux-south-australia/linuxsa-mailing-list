Hi Steve,

Playing with our local e-Smith box and their web menu lets me set up 
and administer groups, users and what they call i-bays, information 
areas that can have degrees of read and write access. Eg: I can set up 
an i-bay called clipart, load all the clipart into there. I can have 
admin with write rights and everyone as read only. Couple of clicks of 
the mouse. Easy.

I also worked in XP Pro to set up users and permissions and access 
their profiles off the server etc. Works well. Tried with different 
users from different groups and watched as their access changed what 
they could see and read. Interesting stuff. Easy.

I found that XP has a button in Control Panel that lets an admin set 
which programs people can access, but it only includes common stuff 
such as which media player, email program, which IM or which Internet 
browser they can use. That is very handy in itself. Easy.

I did learn a fair bit of this stuff a couple of years back when I did 
the MCP course but that was on 2000 Advanced Server, a very different 
beats to today's XP Pro. Crazy.

How can I set up to control which version of Office a person can use?

Remember also that all this has to be easy enough for others to manage 
once I am not associated with the organisation. I refuse to lock them 
into only dealing with me, that is unethical.

Reminds me. I better set up a system of documenting the changes so 
others can see the why and wherefore behind the choices made. 
Suggestions?

Cheers,  Ian
