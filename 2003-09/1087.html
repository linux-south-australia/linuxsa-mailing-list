&gt;Ian,

&gt; &gt; BTW, do you like this notice at the bottom of each page on
&gt; &gt; the Lindows site?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; " Lindows.com is not endorsed by or affiliated with
&gt; &gt; Microsoft Corporation in any way - in fact, we don't even
&gt; &gt; really like them because they are suing us. "
&gt;
&gt;Last time I looked at Lindows it was a simple rip-off of Debian (I think)
&gt;with a customised KDE3 desktop. Whilst it came with 10 free "click and
&gt;run" licences you'd have to use them ALL to get a semi-useful system.

Lindows is a Debian descendant - however I wouldn't call it a rip-off, 
otherwise that is an adjective which could be used for many distributions. 
It does use KDE3 and there is customisation, mostly to make things simple 
for new users. The 10 apps starter for CNR was for v3.0. With v4.0 they 
have gone for a 14 day trial of CNR and one can install any of the apps in 
CNR. The basic apps are no more than you would get with a windows install - 
just better :-)

&gt;For example, you'd have to get OpenOffice, The Gimp, Abiword, Gnumeric and
&gt;whatever you might need.

The standard install does come light on apps, but at least there is little 
crud clogging up the system. Install whatever apps you want after OS 
install. CNR is only an option, not mandatory. Apps can still be installed 
from source, script, deb package. CNR is just pretty bloody easy!

&gt;The one thing that Lindows is unable to do is send a demonstration
&gt;computer to a client and then send one of the techs to help out the
&gt;client and then modify the distribution slightly to work with the client's
&gt;system.
&gt;
&gt;I'd prefer to buy from a local supplier...

The sales channel is growing, including here in Australia and there are a 
number of techies who are seriously thinking of the use of this distro for 
OS replacement in a business environment. Not to say it can't be done with 
many distributions but at least Lindows.com is making noise out there and 
people are listening. I don't know line you are in David but if you are in 
the sales/tech end of the IT market, maybe YOU should sign up as a 
reseller/builder and be the tech you mentioned above. From what I have seen 
you have the tech skills so go for it :)

BTW, Lindows is the first distribution I have stuck with. I'd briefly tried 
RedHat and Mandrake before but didn't stick with it as I didn't really find 
much support to help me understand the environment. With Lindows, my 
learning curve was a lot shallower. Most of the newcomers to Lindows have 
not tried Linux before (or were turned off before) and on the forums, we 
(yep, newbie me included) are doing our best to keep as many going with the 
OS as possible. My skills and knowledge are growing and I can tell you 
there is a growing body of happy Linux users out there. Aren't you happy 
with that ;-)
