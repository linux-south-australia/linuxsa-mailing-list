&gt;&gt; In <A HREF="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/34007.htm,">http://www.linuxworld.com/story/34007.htm,</A> Darl McBride makes critical
&gt;&gt; comment on a flaw in the Open Source development model.  He says that,
&gt;&gt; "UNIX System V code (owned by SCO) is, in fact, in Linux, and it shouldn't
&gt;&gt; be there."  The source of this assertion is apparently, "Open Source
&gt;&gt; leader Bruce Perens," and goes on to say, "Mr Perens stated that there is
&gt;&gt; ``an error in the Linux developer's process'' which allowed Unix System
&gt;&gt; V code that ``didn't belong in Linux'' to end up in the Linux kernel
&gt;&gt; (source: ComputerWire, August 25, 2003)."
&gt;
&gt; Hmm. Take Darl's assertions as fact at your own peril.
&gt; The full quote from Perens is:
&gt; "In this case, there was an error in the Linux developer's process (at
&gt; SGI), and we lucked out that it wasn't worse. It turns out that we have
&gt; a legal right to use the code in question, but it doesn't belong in
&gt; Linux and has been removed."

Hmm.  The last time I saw it, esr and Perens appeared to be trying to
claim that the code in question was derived from 32V.  That's
completely incorrect.  I'm sure that the code was derived from System
V.  However, a little detail that evaded me:

  The code as it stands contains no System-V specific code.  All the
  AT&T code in the example was also present in the Seventh Edition,
  which Caldera released last year under (effectively) a BSD license.
  There's additional code in both System V and Linux which has a
  similar purpose, but the code isn't the same.  The only clues that
  it was derived from System V are just that, clues.  The biggest
  similarity is in the way the following comments are wrapped:

Seventh Edition:

/*
 * Allocate 'size' units from the given
 * map.  Return the base of the allocated
 * space.

System V, Linux:

    /*
     * Allocate 'size' units from the given map.
     * Return the base of the allocated space.

The only real difference is the way the comments are wrapped (and
indented).  Does anybody believe that a judge would consider this
reformatting a breach of intellectual property?
