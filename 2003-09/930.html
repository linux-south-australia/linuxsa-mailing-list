&gt; &gt; So what I'm saying is that probably unix on the IBM-PC could not
&gt; &gt; have gotten off the ground until more like 1988 or so when the 386
&gt; &gt; system price started to become more affordable. (In 1988, in our
&gt; &gt; 100-person IT company, only very few top people had a 386. The
&gt; &gt; accountant was always complaining to me that his spreadsheets took
&gt; &gt; too long on the 286 with 640k RAM. But he couldn't make out the
&gt; &gt; "business case" to get a 386 just for himself.)
&gt; 
&gt; I believe the earliest version was round 1984.  I've mislaid the copy
&gt; of UNIX Review which describes it, but note SCO's (exceptionally,
&gt; correct) claims to having UNIX on the PC in the early 80s.

the second "Unix" i played with was Xenix on a 286... not sure
of the dates of the sotware, but it was an old and unloved
box of disks and books in 1990. the "unix family tree" puts 
SCO Xenix in the running about 1982-3. must dig that up again. 
but Xenix from then is a very different product to SCO Unix now.

&gt; &gt; It would not have been in IBM's interest to develop hardware which
&gt; &gt; could run unix because it would have taken business away from the
&gt; &gt; mainframe surely.
&gt; That's not the way IBM works.  They didn't expect the PC to be even
&gt; that successful.  It was a last-ditch attempt to save the 5100 line.

IBMs game was to extract (all the) money out of any market.

the first unix i saw was called something like concurrent-unix
on a 286 in 1988, but that was a box that had been running since
1984 or thereabouts... had about 30 users on serial dumb terminals.
it had no "console" of its own, all serial. paper tape and other
wyrd stuff.

cheers,

Kim
