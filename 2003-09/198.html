<H1>Ooops! I deleted my partition table - How to restore.</H1>

I have a partitioned 80 GB hard disk at home that includes Lindows.

10 GB BeOS
10 GB FreeBSD
10BG NetBSD
10 GB SuSE
10 GB Red Hat
10BG Mandrake
10 GB Lindows
500 MB Swap
9.5 GB Storage

I decided to boot into Lindows to test a how to on building .debs, but 
was disappointed to find out that Lindows had overwritten my Master Boot 
Record without asking me. I could tell it did this because I had Grub at 
the bootloader, but I was presented with the telltale "LI."

I used SuSE8.2's CD #1 to boot back into SuSE by first selecting 
install/English/then boot installed system. I tried to go back into SuSE 
8.2 and get its bootloader tool to overwrite my MBR, but no luck on 
reboot, "LI" was still there. I don't have Windows on that hard disk, so 
I searched around for a way to remove the Master Boot Record. I found 
this article: <A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue63/okopnik.html">http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue63/okopnik.html</A>
I had not read the article closely, but picked out this command from the 
article and ran it:

**************************************************************

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1

DON'T run that unless you know what you are doing, it may delete your 
partition table as well!

**************************************************************


I then tried to boot up with SuSE's CD#1, and boot the installed system 
as I did before, SuSE could not detect that I had any partitrions at 
all.  FreeBSD's Fdisk came up empty as well. Looks like the partitions 
are gone! At this point, don't write anything to that hard disk, or you 
could loose everything!

Solution: gpart
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/gpart.html">http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/gpart.html</A>

How to restore:
Boot up with SuSE's CD #1 and select Rescue System.  At the console, type:

gpart /dev/hda /dev/hda -W

After typing the command, gpart displayed my primary partitions 
correctly and showed my extended partition, but misidentified its 
contents. I went ahead and confirmed that gpart should write the new 
master boot record.

I then used SuSE's CD#1 to boot the installed system, and it was there, 
undamaged. In fact all of my partitions remained bootable, with the 
exception of NetBSD's which seemed to repair itself when the reinstall 
failed. All of my partitions are now bootable!
