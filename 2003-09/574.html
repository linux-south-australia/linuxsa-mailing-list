This is probably stating the obvious but 
addressing this
&gt;&gt; hence running at 1500/256 you will still receive packets at up to 1500
&gt;&gt; even if what you are sending in reply is equal to or less than 256.

ADSL is Asymetric
So If you are uploading at full speed your download speed is lower 
consequently it really comes down to how many acks get sent up as to how
fast you download.
Seeing TCP is a sliding window protocol it will maximise itself to attain
full bandwith (in theory)
So I would suggest serial downloads rather than simultaneous ones would be
faster aggregate time wise.

But we're really splitting hairs.

The other thing is variables associated with the respective transfers play
a part.
If Site A is close and Site B isn't 
You have 2 downloads happening
you will be sending acks to Site A at a much faster rate simply because
Site B data takes longer to come down, you then will be using more of your
upload in backchannel for Site A furthur impacting Site Bs data coming down. 

I may be wrong but this is the way I see it. - Correct me if Im wrong please.

Evan

&gt;&gt; &gt; It's like this.  1500 down 256 up.  I don't want to go to some
&gt;&gt; &gt; website and start downloading a file expecting to get 1500 when all
&gt;&gt; &gt; I would really get is 256 because TCP would rate limit me(flow
&gt;&gt; &gt; control) because of mp upload speed.  This is just my preference and
&gt;&gt; &gt; I guess if it doesn't do that then I am more than happy to go with
&gt;&gt; &gt; ADSL but if TCP does do that then barring the cost go with SDSL.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt; do understand about all the myriad of things that can go on between
&gt;&gt; &gt; me and this website but in theory if that site and myself had
&gt;&gt; &gt; unhampered bandwidth then I want 1500 down and 256 up, and I don't
&gt;&gt; &gt; want TCP to control my connection to 256/256.  I don't know if it
&gt;&gt; &gt; works like I want it too but that is what I want.  Does that make
&gt;&gt; &gt; more sense now?  Is it possible to get 1500/256 not 256/256?  I do
&gt;&gt; &gt; serve things but that is purely not the issue here.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; i think your a little confused.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; hence running at 1500/256 you will still receive packets at up to 1500
&gt;&gt; even if what you are sending in reply is equal to or less than 256.
&gt;
&gt;See this is where some get confused at my question.  I am not talking
&gt;about the size of the packets.  I am merely talking about the speed.  I
&gt;guess it was a bit confusing giving a file size.  I just wanted to know
&gt;if TCP itself will rate limit my download to the slowest direction
&gt;(upload 256kbps).  I have been told it will but I can't seem to find any
&gt;documentation on it.  So I hope that makes it a bit clearer?
