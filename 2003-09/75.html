OK... Sorry about lack of info. Thanks for the feedback though
We are developing an instrument which has nearly all of the control done via
a PC104 stack. This is an open standard for fanless PCs, using i486 based
CPU. This one is a standard Prometheus from Diamond Systems which has
integrated A/D, D/A digital I/O, 2 USB ports enabled, 4 Comm ports, Parallel
ports, PS2 Keyboard and Mouse. In addition a VGA card has been added so that
we can do development directly on it. The Linux embedded on the Flash card
takes up only about 5 to 11Mb of RAM when loaded, and has SWAP files
disabled to protect flash RAM in Flash disk from excessive write cycles. It
is based on Linux Kernel 2.4. 
It is connected via LAN to another Linux box (Redhat 9.0) with Xwindows,
GDB, GCC etc and Jedit installed. 
Most of the original programming is complete. However that talented
programmer responsible has found another job, so it is up to me to debug
some aspects of the code and tinker to make it better in the long run. I am
immensely enjoying the enforced learning of Linux and am rapidly becoming
enthused of the underlying philosophy and power. However I am aware that I
need to ramp up my learning curve pronto, in order to satisfy my boss and
more importantly, ... the customer.
I am just using a command line debugger(GDB) on networked Linux box. However
to finish development and debugging it seems that it is necessary to do
debugging in PC104 environment in order to get reasonable values into
program and test outputs.
Is that enough info
Sincerely yours
Bryan C
