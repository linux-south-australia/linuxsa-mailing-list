I wouldn't be too worried by that;  In practical terms that just means
MS's new version of Office will fail in the marketplace.

They've introduced incompatibilities into Office previously, but never
fatal ones:  You've always been able to get at least -some- access to
documents created by the "next" version of Office, even if the formatting
was wrong or some of the stuff in the document looked corrupted.  And
there have been reader applications available so you can at least look
at documents even if you don't have the latest and greatest Office version.

With Office 2003 + DRM, there will be absolutely no access whatsoever
to DRM documents unless you're running the latest version of Office. 
None.

I'm predicting that that'll make Office 2003 fail utterly in the 
marketplace.  Nobody is going to use it when they know they won't be 
able to interchange their documents with anyone who isn't an early-
adopter.

The really interesting thing here is that the training and incompatability
jump to get from Office 2002 to Office 2003 isn't materially different
from the training and incompatibility jump to get from Office 2002 to
OpenOffice.  This should be seen as an opportunity, not a threat.

(let's keep remembering that MS is great at commoditizing other peoples'
successful ideas, but over the last 20 years they've proved time and
time again that they suck utterly at introducing stuff that's genuinely
new.  In this instance they're introducing DRM in a world which has
never seen a successful DRM implementation.  What reason do we have
to believe that it'll be any more successful for MS than Microsoft Bob
was?)
