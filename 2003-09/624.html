Hi.

About 2 years ago, I built a box with a MSI motherboard that had
integrated Promise Fastrack 100 IDE Raid. (It was a 694D-Pro-R)

On Monday morning, the box was off the air, and I rang the locals and
asked them to inspect it for me. There was a terrifying screeching noise
emanating from the case, and I diagnosed a catastrophic disk failure,
and decided to pay it a visit.

Upon boot, the screen was stopping at a screen advising that the Raid
array (Raid1 Mirror) was critical, and gave the option to continue
booting or enter the Fastrack utility. I spent some time in Fastrack to
identify the dead drive, pulled it out and replaced it, rebooted and
re-entered the utility. There is an option there to rebuild the array,
which I did, and all was sweet again.

The process is not as clean as the fancy java apps that come with the
mainstream Raid Controllers, but it did the job, no data was lost, and
the downtime was the length of time it took me to get there and fix it.
Unless you have a hot-spare, someone has to attend to do the physical
swap.

The only downside is that the disk failure took the machine down, where
it really should have stayed online. I don't know if that is normal for
a Promise IDE raid controller, or if something else was going on (maybe
the failing drive was pulling a lot of amps and overloading the power
supply...)

Regards,

Michael
