<H1>Eu passes directive *against* software patents</H1>

At least, as far as I can see that is the case. There seems to be a lot
of confusion in the Anglo media about what happened in Eu parliament
yesterday. 

The patent directive was voted in, but with many ammendments likely to
make the whole very favourable to sensible goals as endlessly discussed
in places like this.  So yes, the directive was passed (to the first
stage, there's another reading to come and a committee or two to pass)
but no, it isn't a US-style law.  Quite the opposite in fact.
Presumably Australia will be considering these issues in due course, and
if the Eu directive gets through unharmed there will probably be a good
model for the local people to study. 

When the reports say "ammendments", it looks like the action was very
hot. It seems the directive was proposed, and then there was a barrage
of "I propose ammendment XX as previously tabled", followed by a vote on
that ammendment. 78 times in 40 minutes, according to See
<A HREF="http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/plen0924/index.en.html.">http://swpat.ffii.org/news/03/plen0924/index.en.html.</A> And so a
potentially nasty law gets turned on its head in less than an hour. I
don't really understand the processes behind this well but it appears to
have worked this time anyway.

Also, in
<A HREF="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/fsfe-france/2003-09/msg00262.html">http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/fsfe-france/2003-09/msg00262.html</A> is
the claim (from a credible source, Loïc Dachary has been a
representative of all the major free software organisations involved)
that the directive is sufficiently clear that the existing thirty
thousand Eu software patents are invalidated. Hopefully that is correct,
there are some real horrors there such as the process of purchasing
something with a single click using a web browser.

This has implications for free projects in a broad sense -- no
programmer could taken to court for creating a single-click shooping
trolley.  But it also has implications in several specific senses,
especially related to rights to continue to implement protocols which
companies in the US and Japan try to tie down with software patents.
Maybe this will signal a return to the days when it wasn't possible to
import some crypto to the US due to the RSA patent.

The directive apparently doesn't properly cover algorithms, but that's
what second readings are for.
