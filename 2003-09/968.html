&gt; Anyoone got any experience with TPG? they seem like the best deal?
&gt; Cheaper by $20 AND you get free modem, only bad thing is 12 month 
&gt; contract..?

Absolutely awful technical support (my god, the three times I've called them
has been hell; they didn't even seem to understand English very well let alone
be even remotely helpful), their routing seems completely up the creek, and
downtime seems damn often.

I recommend keeping very, very clear.

(FYI to Ian; I've got a few clients connected with Airnet DSL (joined them up
when Airnet first started, and they seemed quite decent at the time, and were
very, very helpful on the phone - sadly, that seems to have changed for the
worse), one of them got billed some absolutely insane amount for excess data -
I've got traffic counters on the Linux router there and it doesn't report any
different usage than what he would normally (I first suspected a virus/worm);
when the customer asked if it was a problem with their billing system, Airnet
told them they would have to look into it, but it would cost the customer $150
a hour or something insane, and may take anywhere from a few hours plus.  They
also admitted to some problems with the billing system; so I'd consider it a
risk going with them.)
