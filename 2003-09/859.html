David&gt; I can't imagine IBM would ever have let Microsoft keep the IP for MS-DOS,
David&gt; but they did.

Greg&gt; Well, how could they stop them?  It was their OS.

David&gt; They could have (probably wish they did) insisted that MS assign all
David&gt; rights in the software to IBM as part of the deal.

Greg&gt; This is quite a tangent.  Yes, given their relative sizes they could
Greg&gt; have, but that wouldn't be typical business conduct. 

I think it would have been typical business conduct for IBM, but they were
fighting an anti-trust suit at the time, and so they had to play nicely.
I strongly suspect that's a major reason why Microsoft kept ownership.

Greg&gt; It would be comparable to having SCO assign all rights to UNIX to IBM.

I agree with what you said here, but it doesn't exactly fit the situation
that we're discussing.  If IBM decided they wanted Unix for their PC,
and if SCO had been the owners at the time, then IBM probably would not
have insisted on rights to Unix for the same reason that they didn't
insist on rights to PC-DOS: Not because they didn't want those rights,
but because they were fighting an anti-trust suit and so couldn't afford
to have them.  Of course, at the time Bell owned Unix and I don't think
they would have sold the rights to IBM very cheaply, if at all.

Pity that Bell's own anti-trust suit didn't permit them to commercialise
Unix.  A marriage of Bell (Unix) and IBM (PC) would have made the current
computer climate much more interesting than it otherwise has been.
