&gt; On the contrary, if the web100 guys get their wish of higher MTU's on the

John,

There are two separate issues:

1.	Souping up the TCP stack to send more Mbits/sec.
2.	Increasing the MTU.

Or at least I assume that they are separate.

Your response seems to indicate that CPU speed is the limiting factor in
network congestion. That's the first I heard of this. I thought it was
the physical bit-rate of links.

There's a kind of diminishing returns thing here.

CPU time per packet must be something like a constant K plus some small
linear factor for the packet length.
So if you look at typical file transfers, you have soemthing like

CPU time per byte = K/1500.

For RTP, you might have more like K/100.

So now you are saying that going from, say K/1500 to K/15000 is going
to make a big difference. But the difference is

	K * (1/1500 - 15000) = about K/1650.

This is such a tiny difference compared to K/100 that it is negligeable.
You are improving a ratio which are already low.
You are not going to increase ACK packet size by bundling 10 into one packet,
I suppose.

If you increase file transfer packet size, then you necessarily increase
jitter for RTP. 

It seems like on all counts, your arguments are the reverse to how routers
work. 

Cheers,
ak.
