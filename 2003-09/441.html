I checked out <A HREF="http://www.adelaidecc.com.au/comingevents.cfm">http://www.adelaidecc.com.au/comingevents.cfm</A> and it makes no
mention of this event.
Also this link does not work <A HREF="http://www.wiredup.com.au">http://www.wiredup.com.au</A>
Am I missing something? Probably :)

Still I like Matthew's idea about "linux - free as beer"!

 Ok. Random thought processes sometimes throw up ideas that  might seem to
be stupid but actually contain the kernel of a  good idea. I have them all
the time. This is just another  one. It isn't likely to be either right or
wrong but  somewhere in between. It is shared with you in case others  think
there is some merit in the idea.

 An estimated 9,500 visitors attended the last Wiredup Expo,  and this
year's event will be held in the newly renovated  and enlarged Adelaide
Convention Centre. 

 Held at Adelaide Convention Centre on November 1-2 from 10am-5pm.

 Wired Up is a big event on the IT calendar. Lots of IT folks  visit the
show. Lots of companies and groups put on a stand  and do demonstrations.

 Why not a "Linux in SA" stand?

 We could approach the organisers for cheep rate (free?)
 stand and there are enough of us to share the load to staff  the booth. We
could hook in suppliers for stuff to  sell/offer/giveaway/support our costs.

 We could tell people about LCA2004. 

 We could tell people about the OSS mini conference and the  Education and
other mini conferences.

 We could tell people about CSDN and give CDs away/ sell for $2.

 We could work with ComputerBank SA and tell people what they  do and help
them seek corporate support for donor computers.

 We could do a great deal of excellent publicity for
 ourselves and the Linux / Open Source movement.

 But ... there is always a but ... we, you and I and all of
 us ... would need to extract the digit and work together to  make it happen
... it wont happen any other way.

 So there is the idea and the challenge. Now up to each of
 you to think it through and comment.

 Again, where and when?
 Adelaide Convention centre, November 1-2 from 10am-5pm, entry is $10.
