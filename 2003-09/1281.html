I've tried to get kopete, but it refuses to compile. 8^(. apparently it'll be 
in the next KDE, so I'll just wait for the packages, and put up with gaim 
(there's problems with it, some of which are probably because I didn't 
compile it properly) until then.
but for a working client with a lot of the trimmings, you could look at aMSN. 
it's just for the MSN network, but it does a good job of it. it's in tcl/tk, 
so you need the interpreters installed, but it's designed as a replacement. 
looks remarkably like the 'real' MSN. aMSN had most of the upgrades of MSN6 
within a week or two of MSN6 coming out. it does file sharing (send and 
receive files), and plays sound files, but I haven't seen anything in regards 
to webcam or voice convos. since this computer doesn't have a webcam and the 
soundcard is only half-duplex, neither of these is an issue for me.
there's even plugins for the KDE and gnome panel to simulate the SNA of 
windows (or systray, if you prefer) with the code, you just have to go to the 
directories and build them.
