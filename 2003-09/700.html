&gt; &gt; I'm always surprised by how few people have their mail server at home.
&gt; &gt; I can see advantages in the client-server approach, but there are advantages
&gt; &gt; in the mail server being on your own machine too.
&gt; 
&gt; many people don't want the responsibility of ensuring that their primary
&gt; mail server is up 24/7.
&gt; 
&gt; i do run my own mail server but it is in a data centre and not in my lounge
&gt; room. then it gets redundant connectivity, UPS etc.etc.

Martin,

Those are some of the advantages which I had in mind. And I don't disagree
with them. But people using the ISP's SMTP endpoint are denying themselves
the very considerable advantages of a lounge-based STMP server.
For example, I get only about one spam every 3 months, and if I had
Romana's situation, I'd type a line of code and I'd be laughing. It would
also stop the spam bounces.

You don't need 24/7 for a mail server, of course. SMTP servers will
generally keep trying for 4 days to deliver your mail to you. So you just
have to keep your down time to under 4 days. It might be better to
receive your linuxsa mail on someone else's server though if you don't
have a reliable set-up at home.

If one has the money, the best of all possible worlds might be a
collocated machine with a trusted ISP, as you seem to have.
But that requires both money and trust!!

Cheers,
ak.
