David,

&gt; will get far because you can avoid using their SiteFinder.  You just
&gt; don't use it.

Under the terms and conditions of using SiteFinder, simply viewing it is
using it.

&gt; So how about it, David: What is it about their SiteFinder service that
&gt; makes you unable to just not use it?

Under the terms and conditions it states:

---
You may have accessed the VeriSign Service(s) by initiating a query to
our DNS resolution service for a nonexistent domain name. We are unable to
resolve such queries through the DNS resolution service. You are free to
reformulate your query and retransmit in the manner you transmitted your
initial query or to use the search services of third party providers. The
information provided through the VeriSign Services is not necessarily
complete and may be supplied by VeriSign's commericial licensors,
advertisers or others. The system used to provide the VeriSign Services is
separate and apart from that which is used to provide the DNS resolution
service and may differ substantially in terms of speed, uptime and other
performance parameters. The VeriSign Services complement our DNS
resolution service and provide information that may prove useful to you in
locating the resources you originally intended to access. The VeriSign
Services are provided only for your personal and non-commercial use. You
are not authorized to modify, copy, display, transmit, license, create
derivative works from, transfer, distribute or sell any information,
software, products or services obtained from the services VeriSign
provides through this web site. You may not "meta-search" the VeriSign
Services. If you want to make commercial use of the VeriSign Services, you
must enter into an agreement with us to do so in advance.

David, I don't always type existen domain names. The two main reasonas
are:

 1) I sometimes mistype domain names

  - I'm human

 2) I sometimes follow a URL given to me in good faith and it just 
    happens the URL has changed or is non-existent

Under NEITHER of these circumstances did I *intend* to initiate a query to
a nonexistent domain name.

Despite what I've said, I do not believe it is reasonable for a company to
enforce a set of terms and conditions on me that I cannot possibly comply
with [surely you can see my argument - I argue that Sitefinder DO bind me
to their T&C's if I even just view their site] without an enactment from
the relevant law making authority,

Last time I looked the Australian Parliament has not passed a law allowing
Verisign to force me into a contract with them.
