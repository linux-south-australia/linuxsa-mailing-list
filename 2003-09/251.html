&gt; &gt; you could write a small shell script to execute the program, then grab its
&gt; &gt; process number and 'sleep' for the given time, then check to see if its
&gt; &gt; running with 'ps' and then kill it if it is...
&gt; 
&gt; Yep - Kim's solution is good - you can write a wrapper the forks and execs 
&gt; and then waits.
&gt; 
&gt; If the program goes out of control [ie uses too much cpu time] then try 
&gt; ulimit [inbuilt in bash] the number of seconds of cpu time.

very nice; "ulimit -t seconds"

what he said (from man bash);

"ulimit [-SHacdflmnpstuv [limit]]
       Provides  control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by
       it, on systems that allow such control.  The -H and -S options specify that the hard or
       soft  limit is set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased once it is
       set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.   If  neither  -H
       nor  -S is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set.  The value of limit can be
       a number in the unit specified for the resource or one  of  the  special  values  hard,
       soft, or unlimited, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and
       no limit, respectively.  If limit is omitted, the current value of the  soft  limit  of
       the resource is printed, unless the -H option is given.  When more than one resource is
       specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the  value.   Other  options  are
       interpreted as follows:
       -a     All current limits are reported
       -c     The maximum size of core files created
       -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment
       -f     The maximum size of files created by the shell
       -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
       -m     The maximum resident set size
       -n     The  maximum  number  of  open  file descriptors (most systems do not allow this
              value to be set)
       -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
       -s     The maximum stack size
       -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
       -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user
       -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell

       If limit is given, it is the new value of the specified resource (the -a option is dis-
       play only).  If no option is given, then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte incre-
       ments, except for -t, which is in seconds, -p, which is in units  of  512-byte  blocksI,
       and  -n  and  -u,  which are unscaled values.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid
       option or argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit."

cheers,

Kim
