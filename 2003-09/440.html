My gut feeling is that most users (ie the other 99% of the people on the
network) can't cope with ACLs well. They still think Office is part of
the operating system and explaining how to right click and change
security on a file is inviting disaster.

I think that assigning a group for each department and an accompanying
samba share is very maintainable.

ACLs are really annoying for people accustomed to scripting support of
their file systems.

&gt;&gt;What are these "extended" attributes of which you speak?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The extensions allow metadata in addition to the standard
&gt; UNIX metadata to be stored on the filesystem.  For example,
&gt; you could store ACL names.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;What do you gain from them over the user and groups model in Unix?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Access control lists allow arbitrary rules.  The real world
&gt; doesn't fit into the UNIX group model.  For example, "all
&gt; the people in the Black Helicopter project with Secret or
&gt; better clearances and Fred the cleaner" is difficult to
&gt; implement using UNIX groups without exploding the number
&gt; of UNIX groups (leading to maintainability issues).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Or are other things funky date and time attrs?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They are generic.  So they might store
&gt;   - an ACL.
&gt;   - a reference to where in the tape library the contents
&gt;     of the file can be found.
&gt;   - a thumbprint image for files which are images.
&gt;   - a precomputed keyword vector for faster seaching
&gt;     of documents.
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever. Personally, I'd like a URL for files created
&gt; with a web browser "save to disk" option.
