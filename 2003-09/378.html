hmmm, what with other headlines about more and more people signing up
for broadband in us and uk, and the access in other countries broadening
daily...well, i think thats unlikely. the web isnt a toy or fad. its
also become a necessary study guide, business tool, research centre, and
meeting place. email - try to imagine many businesses without web access
and email availability now!!


&gt; Imminent death of AOL predicted! Internet becomes useful again! 
&gt; Pictures at 11!

meh, dream on!!!;)))

the internet is now becoming as much a part of life as tv.
one of the reasons computerbank exists:)

ahh, all you spoilt lot - i remember when the internet was a frontier
town! when i started online, it was in mosaic - hell, bbs before that!
none of your images - we thought blink was fancy when it came out (ok,
THAT was short lived!) colour, well, we were too poor for any colour but
grey. we thought a 28.8 was a uni/big business high tech type modem -
the likes of 9600 were good enough for such as us. 

and we lived in shoe box in t'middle of t'road, too.;)
