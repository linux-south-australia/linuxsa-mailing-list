&gt;Hello James,
&gt;
Hi :-)

I hope you don't mind if I respond below what you write, it makes it 
easier for me sometimes, and a lot of people do it to, so I am kind of 
used to it.

&gt;The next thing  may I suggest, is the expirienced Linux people, that DO want
&gt;to help, is to have some sort knowledge or some idea on teaching. Again I
&gt;will use the example in trade school, many of the "teachers" there had to
&gt;have a degree AND expience in the world of motor mechanics ( it could be
&gt;carpentry, etc etc) plus to be able to teach, is do a small teaching course.
&gt;However, correct me if I am wrong by all means.
&gt;
Good point! :-)

&gt;So, when I look at my situation, and try to look at what is the next step
&gt;after configuring the firewall ( I used smoothwall 1.0)
&gt;What now?
&gt;
Depends on what you want to do and what equipment you have to work with. 
  :-)  Everybody's goals are different, but here are some general things 
you might want to do:

1. Be able to set up your Linux box to do everything your Windows box does.

If I were going to do this, I would start out by making a list of things 
that you like to do in Windows, and then you can ask people how to do 
the same thing in Linux.

I'm not going to promice that you can do that in smoothwall, but I can 
say that I can tell you where to look instead. A Smoothwall setup makes 
a nice firewall, but probably wouldn't make a good Windows 
replacement...but I could be wrong too.

2. Set up a computer that all your other computers can put files onto so 
documents can be shared and your data can be backed up.

3. Learn how to make your own web page

4. Learn about the other ways people talk to each other over the Internet.

&gt;Well, I have been reading the posts, absorbing the replies for about a week,
&gt;and have noticed the next thing that might be to get to know are the
&gt;commands. What do thay mean, why are they there, how does all this apply to
&gt;me ???
&gt;
I understand where you are coming from, and truth be told, there are a 
lot of commands that I don't know too. Let me tell you what I did, and 
why I would recommend that you do the same.

When I first started out, one of the first goals I had was to be able 
access some files that were on another computer in my office.  There was 
a program in Windows that allowed me to access the files on the server 
if I logged into the machine from my Windows desk.

I wanted to do the same thing in Linux, so I did a lot of research to 
see how it was supposed to work in Linux.  During that process, I 
learned the command ncpmount.  I found a lot of answers using the Google 
search engine, but I was also never shy to ask for help if I couldn't 
find the information I needed.

The same thing will happen to you once you decide what your immediate 
goal is. All you have to do is ask, and someone will probably help you 
get started.

&gt;Do I loose sleep over this ? NO WAY, I went and got myself a beer, watched
&gt;the football, and presto, after the footy, I types in google search, "linux
&gt;comands tutorial"
&gt;There is a list of many ways to get to the next step. What I am looking for
&gt;is a comparitive command list from MS DOS to Linux. For example, if I type a
&gt;MS DOS shell, DIR/W ,then a list of directories appear. If I type in CD
&gt;&lt;name directory&gt; then it goes to that directory, and so on. What is the same
&gt;in a Linux basis shell after boot-up?
&gt;
I found a page you can start with here: 
<A HREF="http://linuxrefresher.com/commands/doscommands.htm">http://linuxrefresher.com/commands/doscommands.htm</A>

Now I was able to find this page with Google, but the way I searched for 
it made a big difference. I used "Linux and dos equivalent" as my search 
parameters because I thought that these commands would be the only 
commonality between the two operating systems.

&gt;But that's me, others may be a different levels and past all this ,from a
&gt;newbies perspective I am sure there are some that can relate.
&gt;  
&gt;
I want to always feel like a new user, so I can help them out.

&gt;  
&gt;
I took a look at these.  You know what I think you should do ? - 
 Practice the shell line commands on the smoothwall box!

That way you won't have to sign up. The smoothwall box will use the same 
commands as the page that wants you to sign up. Just skip the telnet 
part of the lesson.

Enjoy!

:-)
