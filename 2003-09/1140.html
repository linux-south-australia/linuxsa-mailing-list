&gt; so a quote (orig. in german):
&gt; IT-inventions shall only be valid for a patent, when they provide a

I saw that. And I think it is reasonable. The point is, if any physical
device is patentable, then a physical device with a computer stuck in it
should be patentable too. However something which is "pure software" as
it is put cannot be patented. As the second article I linked said, the
mere fact a piece of software makes electrons move and disc heads move
etc does not constitute it somewhich which has a "physical effect". So I
don't think what you observe is in fact a problem.

This has lots of problems for the future as firmware and hardware and
not-quite-eitherware develop. And where does configurable computing fit,
where the computer often doesn't actually exist until the problem has
been defined by another computer? And so forth. But nevertheless it lets
ABS be patentable and CIFS not. Hooray.

&gt; &gt;At least, as far as I can see that is the case. There seems to be a lot
&gt; &gt;of confusion in the Anglo media about what happened in Eu parliament
&gt; &gt;yesterday. 
&gt; 
&gt; yeah. every german/austrian paper writes something different...

Heise has a pretty detailed article. Perhaps you would like to excerpt
some choice bits for us, its too hard for me.

&gt; &gt;[...] Hopefully that is correct,
&gt; &gt;there are some real horrors there such as the process of purchasing
&gt; &gt;something with a single click using a web browser.
&gt; 
&gt; not to mention patents for the progress bar, storing files together with 
&gt; a timestamp, and much more

Yes. Someone created an Eu house of horrors page. But according to what
I read all such Eu patents will be invalidated, including all the ones
granted to US iand Japanese companies who were conducting business as
usual in Europe.
