Mark,

So that means that I can afford to get a 32 GHz machine now for 2 weeks' pay.

Calculation:
In 1985 I bought an 8 MHz machine for 2 weeks' pay.
That was at the highest MHz/dollar end of the spectrum in that year.
The price really stunned the computer market at that time.

2003 - 1985 = 18 years = 12 * 18 months.

So for my 2 weeks of pay, I can go out and buy a machine with a CPU
running at 8 * 2^12 = 32768 MHz = 32.768 GHz.

Nowadays, someone earning a pretty good, above-average income would earn
about A$2400 in 2 weeks in Australia. So I think there's a small
error factor of about 16 which seems to have accumulated along the way.
That sort of fits what I've heard - that Moore's law hasn't been applied
correctly by the engineers for a while now. They've got some catching up to do!

The error looks greater if you consider nominal dollars rather than 
constant-value dollars.

On the above numbers, I make it:

Months to double = 12 * 18 * log(2)/log(250) = 27.

Moore's law is apparently out by 9 months.

Of course, if you can tell me where I can get my 32 GHz machine for A$2400,
that would put a different perspective on things.
I realise the law is supposed to apply to the CPU and not the machine as
a whole, but I think the proportion of the CPU price in the whole PC
price has not change all that much. I could be wrong though.

--------------------
But anyway, that strengthens your argument that silicon processing power is
not keeping up with line rates.

Either way, I still would like to be convinced that enabling some people to
spray 100 Mbits/sec onto the net is going to have no effect or a positive
effect on the rest of the users. I'm not the only one in netland who
is liable to think that increased demand on a service is not going to make
queue sizes and delay go down. That kind of argument sounds more like what you
would hear from a politician or a CEO. And the "magic of the market" sometimes
takes a long time to assert itself. 

Anwyay, since we live in the best of all possible worlds, she'll be right...

Cheers,
ak.
