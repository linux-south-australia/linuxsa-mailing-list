Hi.

Ian, I have to say I'm surprised at you. You are an old-timer on this
list, and your post says _nothing_ about what you have tried to get the
serial port and the modem connected on the original box.

Several of us suggested minicom, but you have not mentioned it. Did you
try it?

Are the serial ports in dmesg?

Do you have setserial?

What do you mean by 'response from the modem'? How are you accessing it?

Not meant to be a flame, just mystified why you didn't check the basics
(or report them) before going to the trouble of swapping hardware all
over the place... To 

Please show us the information... Please... :)

Michael

&gt; Another enthralling episode in the continuing saga of 
&gt; trying to get this community organisation onto the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; I can now confirm:
&gt; 1) the external modem (Samsung Vortec) is detected 
&gt; and communicates with a Windows system.
&gt; 2) the external modem is not detected nor communicated with
&gt; from the e-Smith system.
&gt; 
&gt; To get to this point I have done a load of box-swapping, drive-swapping and 
&gt; modem swapping.
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried the e-Smith drive in 3 machines: 
&gt; 2 with the same components 
&gt; and 1 with a very different specification. 
&gt; 
&gt; At no time did I get any response from the modem.
&gt; It just continued to light up CS and MR LEDs. It lights them up
&gt; even if the serial port is disconnected. I tried this through
&gt; minicom but nothing I could do would trigger any response.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried the modem on 2 different boxes with XP Pro
&gt; and Windows ME and on both boxes the lights came up
&gt; CS, RS, TR and MR. Windows is able to dial with the modem
&gt; and query the internal settings.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I have proven my point to my satisfaction that e-Smith
&gt; wont find or communicate to the modem. 
&gt; 
&gt; What really annoys me is that using a P166 box at home, 
&gt; and the SAME modem, we are happily running our home network
&gt; and connecting to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; WTF?
&gt; 
&gt; Come on folks, give me some clues. Why cant I get this project
&gt; completed and the community group up and running on the Internet?
&gt; 
&gt; We chose e-Smith for ease of use and administration. Should we
&gt; put on RedHat or Manduck just so we can get the modem working?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Ian
