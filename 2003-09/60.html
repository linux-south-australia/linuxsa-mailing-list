&gt; What the story?

MSN is locking down their networks. locking out anyone with an old version of 
MSN messenger, and anyone using aMSN, gaim, kopete, or anything else that 
isn't exactly what they want to be on their server. so now any time you log 
on you'll get their auto-spam about how you have to update to the newest MSN 
(well, maybe if they had a linux version I might 8^) though MSN6 is right 
ugly compared to MSN5... trying to make something look real flashy and 
playing catch-up to other IM networks isn't a good idea...). it probably 
won't be long until anything that doesn't have the MSN6 codes (or encryption, 
or whatever it is) won't be able to get on the network. if aMSN manage to get 
their client working on the MSN network, I'll keep using it, otherwise I'll 
be telling a lot of people how I won't be using MSN because of the way they 
treat customers (I really feel there should be laws against some of the stuff 
they do, but you can't stop them). I have accounts with yahoo and ICQ and AIM 
as well, so I'll be encouraging people to use a freindlier IM carrier
