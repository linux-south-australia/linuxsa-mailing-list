Pete,

For opensource anti virus software, try clamav.. But not sure what is
out there if you require a Gui for it. Have a look as it explains it
better than I can.

Have fun... :-D

&gt; However, I am going thru logistics here like you would not believe,
&gt; but before I started to make any move, I read and ask questions and
&gt; testing out various applications.
&gt; Good on em with openoffice.org, if it were not for that, I still
&gt; probably be searching for another alternative.
&gt; Now I am in the process of checking if there is need for anti-virus
&gt; software on a RedHat install.  Why am I choosing RH ? I don't realy
&gt; know but it will do. Then comes the networking, physical aspect with
&gt; cables, configuring and just doing it. Nose bleeds, boots and all,
&gt; here we come. But there is a level of nettitket I have found to be of
&gt; use to, :-) Trust me.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck fellow "migrants"

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;   I am a Linux newbie so be nice ;-)
&gt; 
&gt;   We are looking at doing a full migration to Linux from Microsoft's
&gt;   Windows
&gt; XP. Over the years we have briefly looked at different distributions
&gt; from Mandrake, Corel & Caldera. What we want to do now is completely
&gt; switch over to Linux permanently without the dual-boot safety net that
&gt; has seen us return to Microsoft on so many occasions in the past. What
&gt; I need to do prior to the migration is enusre that certain areas of
&gt; software are covered by reliable, stable Linux apps. We already have
&gt; some areas of software covered (for instance Open Office instead of
&gt; Office XP, Konqueror instead of IE6 and one of many different e-mail
&gt; handlers instead of outlook express).
&gt; 
&gt;   Is there a Linux equivalent of Microsoft Outlook? We use the
&gt;   calendar &
&gt; task features of it for booking appointments. One other area we need
&gt; to address is our accounting package. Currently we use Intuit's
&gt; Quickbooks Pro. If there is some form of Linux app that can do this
&gt; job of bookkeeping including GST tracking? If so then let the
&gt; migration begin ;-)
&gt; 
&gt;   Thankyou to all who have taken time to read this message and bigger
&gt;   thanks
&gt; in advance to those who post any helpful hints or suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt;   Andy.
