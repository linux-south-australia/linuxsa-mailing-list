Samps,


&gt; Does anyone have any idea what Australian law will say about their 
&gt; (SCOs) liability to repay companies that pay for licenses, once the 
&gt; ruling is that SCO is not entitled to claim that money?

It's not illegal for me to pay you for something stupid--such as a
licence to breathe fresh air--but you are not allowed to represent that
you own the IP to fresh air (because you obviously don't).

The moment SCO sends such a licence a number of open source people will
take them straight to the ACCC. You cannot represent to someone they are
required to provide you consideration under threat of a law suit when
you have no right to do so.

The ACCC knows and they have been told about it. SCO haven't been quite
stupid enough to try anything yet.
