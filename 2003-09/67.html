As far as I know, some MD recorders insert track marks after at least 2
seconds silence (when using line-in recording).There is no special
"frequency", rather, the MD recorder inserts a track mark when it senses
a long silence and then a loud sound, (eg the end of song silence then
the start of a new song)

Many CDs have a 2 second "gap" between tracks which the MD picks up and
inserts track marks. Some don't which means that songs get joined
together when recorded onto an MD. Some songs have long silences in them
or low volume sounds which trigger this mechanism also and you can get
single songs split into multiple tracks when recorded to MD.

I don't know if you could set a pause between songs in xmms or perhaps
play a song of "2 seconds silence" between each song. See how that goes.
Or use the sync recording feature of the MD if it has it?

Subject: xmms playing music files as a CD in linux...


Hello,

     Does anyone on this list know what the frequency is that plays
between tracks on a CD?  If you know that what is the name of that
frequency?  I have this minidisc recorder and it will pick up the
frequency or whatever it is that plays between tracks when I use a
normal CD player for it's input.  I have quite a number of music files
.wav, .mp3, .ogg, ... etc. that I would like to record onto it.  However
my problem exists when I use xmms to play the music file as the input
for the minidisc recorder.  It does not pick up that frequency because
it was most likely never recorded with the song(arguably, as it should
be).  There is a plugin for xmms that allows me to run something after a
music file is played.  If I can figure out the frequency then I might be
able to make it automatically "mark" the tracks on the minidisc
recorder.  I am hoping that someone will have thoughts on this.  Any
info on this or relevant links to the info I am looking for will help
greatly...

Thanks,

Chris-
