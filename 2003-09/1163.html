&lt; migrating,still&gt;

 Big smile on face !
More choices, now I *really* am in diabolocal twist !
Nealy ready to download an OS, but the past few days many have appeared to
try out!
Yesterday I mentioned Lindows, the other day it was suggested another. Today
it's Fedora. I was saddened to lean away from RH when I read about Lindows,
now Fedora has come back in the race, and there was this other one where the
whole OS is on CD.
I would test them all if I had the PC's to do this. Time for me is not much
of an issue for testing.
Overall , this is GREAT !

CHEERS

Pete

&gt; Wow, collaboration in the Linux community; who would've thought? :-)
&gt;
&gt; Good on Red Hat for taking the step that many others should. I get the
&gt; feeling this might be a reaction to the fact that Red Hat is looked upon
as
&gt; an 'easier' Linux and maybe doesn't actually want to go the say way as
&gt; Lykoris, Mdk, Lindows, etc. I think it wants to be in the same 'power
user'
&gt; echelon as Debian but with a prettier interface.
&gt;
&gt; Either way, up2date supporting apt is a great move. As it stands, up2date
&gt; really sucks.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Just in case you hadn't heard, Red Hat is changing the way they develop
&gt; their OS.  The development process will be more Debian-like - more open,
&gt; allowing external contributors etc.  This new hacker-level version is
called
&gt; "fedora" and info is available here (<A HREF="http://fedora.redhat.com/">http://fedora.redhat.com/</A>).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Red Hat won't be providing support for this OS, but will take snapshots of
&gt; it and for their "Advanced Server" product which support can be bought
for.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; An interesting move by them.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What caught my eye, was the latest release of fedora, "Severn r2", which
&gt; includes in it's release notes:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; "The Red Hat Update Agent (up2date) now supports installing packages from
&gt; apt and yum repositories as well as local directories. This includes
&gt; dependency solving and obsoletes handling. Additional repositories can be
&gt; configured in the /etc/sysconfig/rhn/sources file."
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So it appears that RPM and apt are coming together slowly...  A good thing
&gt; IMHO...
