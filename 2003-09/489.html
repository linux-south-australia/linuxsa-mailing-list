John,

It looks like that site has only Unicode software for MS-windows, but
they offer a linux distribution - called vietkey linux.

They say some interesting things about the linux situation in vietnam.
Unfortunately, it's all in vietnamese, and it's a titanic struggle for me
to translate it. But here's my beginner's attempt:
(I've given multiple choices for some words.)

===============================================
When Vietnam joins the WTO, or AFTA [Asean Free Trade Area?] or carry out a
serious Viet-USA trade agreement, then the question of copyright will
really become a serious problem. Vietnam will have to pay for copyright
operating systems and much software on top of that. In order to alleviate the
burden of the expense of copyright and to have the possibility to be much more
the master in a complete set of big systems of government, 22 countries in
the world have made determinations to change over to the illustrious/famous/
renowned/noble operating system Linux. In this region, representatives
are Redflag of China and Hancom of Korea.

Vietkey Linux has its own installation steps, it does not rely on the Redhat
installation steps like some distributions have done. That's why one may say,
Vietkey Linux is the first of many operating systems of commercial firms
in Vietnam to be master of the copyright of our own system, similar to,
and perhaps side-by-side/shoulder-by-sholder/cheek-by-jowl with, Redhat Linux.
===============================================

Now I know why user manuals from some countries are written in such untidy
English - their languages are just too different.

This makes me wonder a bit about how they are dealing with the GPL.
They're giving away the single-disk ISO for free on the net though.

An interesting thing about this Vietkey Linux is that they say they
accounced their linux distribution in November 2003 at a scientific workshop 
and said their project had "5 years of pregnancy and 2 years of production".
Obviously Vietnam has changed a lot since I was last there!

Anyway, this augurs well for the future of linux in Asia. The website
creates the impression that the WTO and various trade agreements are,
as we all expected, forcing businesses in all countries of Asia into
the arms of linux.

Cheers,
ak.
