i've had a little theory for a while about input devices and the 
manufacturers thereof (particularly mice & keyboards, but not limited 
thereto).

this will get some flameage, but: in the mass market, there are two 
producers of high-volume, good quality input devices - microsoft and 
logitech. there are plenty of other manufacturers in the retail channel, 
but these two (seem to, in my experience) hold the good-quality-retail 
market. how many of us are using MS mice and/or keyboards now?

microsoft, it is assumed, will not in the reasonably foreseeable future 
be producing linux drivers for any of their hardware, potential company 
break-up notwithstanding.

thus, there is a market opportunity for logitech to produce good quality 
linux drivers for their hardware. there exists a large slice of the 
open-source community (myself included) who purchase hardware primarily 
due to the company's support of linux; take nvidia for instance with 
their excellent drivers for open source OSes (linux, *bsd).

there are some potential barriers to this idea: logitech's drivers on 
windows have never been great quality (in my opinion, they would need to 
lift their game a little to produce "good quality" linux drivers); and 
the market share of people who buy input devices for their linux/*bsd 
compatibility is probably small.

however, i think it is definitely an opportunity for a manufacturer like 
logitech to increase both reputation and profits.

(and this has nothing at all to do with the fact that logitech make the 
kb and mouse i'm using now and i very much prefer their devices ;-) )

what do you reckon?
