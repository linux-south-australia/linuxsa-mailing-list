If you want the flexibility to install on a bare bones box without rpm, you 
will need to compile these packages yourself. Also, compiling from source 
allows you to specify the target directory. Note that compiling gcc and gdb 
is fairly hairy, you may want to practice with a simpler program first such 
as "GNU Hello", which is a multilingual "hello, world!" program that uses the 
GNU autotools (tools that allow software to be built on multiple flavours of 
Unix/Linux). In general the procedure goes like this:

tar -xzvf someprogram-0.1.tar.gz
cd someprogram-0.1
./configure
make
make install

you can pass a whole heap of options to the configure script to change things, 
this is package independent but all packages have the same base options. To 
see these options do

./configure --help

before the ./configure stage above. One of the common options is specifying a 
prefix directory, i.e.:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local

if you were compiling gcc, the gcc binary would end up in /usr/local/bin after 
the "make install" stage. My friend once compiled gcc up for an embedded 
system (ARM SoC board), it took him 2 weeks to work it out :) But from what 
he said, you need to compile gcc twice. Once with the compiler you already 
have, and then once again with itself. However, he was building a cross 
compiler for the ARM... is that what you want to do? What is the host CPU on 
the embedded device? 

If you are building a cross compiler you need to pass a bunch of options to 
./configure in order to build gcc for the desired architecture you want the 
resultant gcc to be able to build for. The first time you build gcc, you will 
need to build it for a desired arch of x86. Then recompile gcc with the 
recently compiled gcc. Then recompile gcc as a cross compiler for the target 
arch. If you intend to actually install gcc onto the embedded box (I'm 
assuming you have a non-x86 CPU on this box at this point), then you will of 
course need to use the newly built cross compiler to compile gcc for the 
embedded system.

I'm not sure, but I think the reason for building gcc with itself is because 
redhat's version of gcc is non-standard and may introduce errors. So I guess 
building gcc with itself makes a "pure" compiler.

Note that I haven't actually built gcc myself, I am relaying what my friend 
did. I'm sure other people on this list will correct any mistakes I made.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; Please excuse a newbie. I have to install gdb and gcc on an embedded PC
&gt; running a bare bones version of Red Hat 7.3. It does not have rpm, so I
&gt; don't know how to proceed. I have another box that is running RH8.0.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried first installing rpm by downloading
&gt; rpm-build-4.0.4-7x.18.i386.rpm (as well as gcc and gdb) onto the RH8.0 box
&gt;
&gt; When I try
&gt; rpm -i rpm*.rpm, I get an error
&gt; "Failed Dependencies:
&gt; 	rpm = 4.0.4 is needed by...
&gt; 	librpm-4.0.4.so is needed by..
&gt;
&gt; The last time I used Linux was slackware in 1997, so my knowledge is VERY
&gt; rusty and out of date.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on how I can get these packages to run on the embedded version?
&gt; Is there any way of specifying a different install directory, so I could
&gt; run say off a USB flash drive?
&gt;
&gt; Any pointers would be appreciated
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Patrick
