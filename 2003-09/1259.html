&gt; &gt; &gt; How is an SMTP callout different from mailfilter?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Different stage in the process. It stops the mail before it's accepted
&gt; &gt; for delivery to your mailbox. mailfilter examines what's made it into
&gt; &gt; your mailbox and deletes it before you download it to your own system.
&gt; &gt; The SMTP callout method is better but only works if you're running
&gt; &gt; your own internet mail server, which means that you have to have a
&gt; &gt; permanent (more or less) connection and your own DNS MX records. If
&gt; &gt; you're on dialup things like mailfilter are pretty much your only
&gt; &gt; option.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is a school of thought which holds that rather than
&gt; &gt; blocking/rejecting spam, you should filter it into a spambox and
&gt; &gt; report it
&gt; 
&gt; That's a school of thought that doesn't care about bandwidth cost (both
&gt; $$ and utilisation)

...or that judges that the benefit of making the world a harder place
to spam in is worth the additional bandwidth cost.

&gt; or CPU cost (ask an ISP what their malware filters
&gt; cost them in continual upgrades.)

Don't follow you here. If I filter the spam myself, or block it with
an SMTP callout, in neither case are the ISP's malware filters involved.

&gt; &gt; convinced it's worthwhile; it seems that my spam distribution has
&gt; &gt; changed such that 
&gt; 
&gt; Yep. And it will keep on changing. That's why spam/virus filters should
&gt; be the *last* line of defence, not the first. The first line of defence
&gt; should be an application firewall that stops the mail ever being
&gt; received, at all. 

But it's unfortunately not an option on dialup.

And the changing distribution of the spam hasn't affected 
the effectiveness of my filtering, with thanks to the
writers of spambayes. I was speculating that, by reporting spam
through spamcop, I may have on the one hand made myself a more hostile
target for spammers in countries where the ISPs and/or legal systems
tend to keep spammers 'on the run', but on the other hand have merely
confirmed my email address as valid to spammers in countries with
CGARA (unable to donate a rodent's anus) ISPs and legal systems (sure,
spamcop munges the headers, but are the apparently random characters in
spam subject lines etc. actually specific to a recipient's address?)

&gt; An SMTP callout is an application firewall. I'm not aware of any SA ISPs
&gt; that use them, which I find quite surprising.

Perhaps they don't want the cost of doing all those lookups? There are
various comments about the expense of it in Debian's default exim.conf.

(As a somewhat irrelevant aside, your quoted callout rules would
unfortunately fail to reject spam that pretends to be from me, which I
know to exist... I've had complaints about it and even copies of it.)
