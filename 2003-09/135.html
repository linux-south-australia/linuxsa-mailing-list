Not exactly, David. :-) I still use Windows as much as I need to and will
sing it's praises if it deserves any, just like Linux and Unix. I'm also
quite prepared to concede that there are things Windows does better than
*.nix's (albeit, those things are gradually diminishing by the day) so :-P
to you too, buddy! :-) I just wish that people would accept that there
doesn't seem to be the one definative OS which everyone should use (if there
was, why would people use anything else?) and that there are merits and
downfalls inherent in the one they use too. The *.BSD crowd are particularly
guilty of this (not that they're putting me off using FreeBSD myself).

Although, having said that, I will not hear of anything against AmigaDOS. If
GOD were a geek, he/she/it/they would use AmigaDOS. :-)~

Mind you, we're seeing more of this stuff as Linux/Unix takes more of the
desktop market so maybe it's a sign the others are feeling a mite
threatened?

Hmmm...

&gt; (luckily I can avoid it). I mean, you do get sick of hearing from 
&gt; users how fabulous their OS is and how crap everything else is and how 
&gt; idiotic everyone else is for not using what they're using etc. I'm 
&gt; referring to those on most sides of the *.nix and Micro$hizenhou$en 
&gt; fences, too. It's just tiresome watching people lob insults at each 
&gt; other minus any real debate. And this, in fact, seems to affect the 
&gt; atmosphere on the site in terms of progression beyond that sort of 
&gt; thing and in fact, make ./ look like a real techsite turkey.

But you've just bagged slashdot in the same manner...

*bzzz*

Do technical people take the Hypocritical Oath?

;-P
