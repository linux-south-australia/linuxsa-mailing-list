Looks like you weren't the only one who disagreed with Sitefinder, David.

Subject: SiteFinder: Terms and Conditions - Non Agreement




Under your terms and conditions you state:

 * <A HREF="http://sitefinder.verisign.com/terms.jsp">http://sitefinder.verisign.com/terms.jsp</A>

---
#  GOVERNING LAW.
You and VeriSign agree that these Terms of Use and any disputes hereunder
including disputes related to the VeriSign Services shall be governed in all
respects by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, United States of America, excluding its conflict of laws rules.
You and we each agree to submit to exclusive subject matter jurisdiction,
personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of Fairfax County, FairFax,
Virginia for any disputes between us under or arising out of this Agreement.
The parties hereby waive any right to jury trial with respect to any action
brought in connection with these Terms of Use or the VeriSign Services.
---

I DO NOT AGREE to these terms and conditions.

I REFUSE to waive the right to jury trial with respect to any action brought
in connection with these Terms of Use or the VeriSign Services.

Given that you have enabled a wildcard DNS record for the.com domain(and
possibly the.net domain) and I cannot guarantee that I will never mistype a
domain name I hereby request that YOU terminate this agreement and take
whatever measures necessary to NOT SHOW ME the SiteFinder service.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

IF YOU CONTINUE TO REDIRECT ANY MISTYPED DOMAINS THAT YOU HAVE UNDER YOUR
DELEGATED CONTROL THEN *YOU* AGREE THAT THE GOVERNING LAW IS THE AUSTRALIAN
LAW AND THAT ANY DISPUTES WILL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF
THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA.

ALSO I RESERVE THE RIGHT, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO JURY
TRIEL TO ANY ACTION BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE
VERSISIGN SERVICES.

I REFUSE TO ENTER INTO ANY CONTRACT WITH YOU AND YOU MAY NOT FORCE ME TO
ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH YOU.
