Romana, like you, missed the point, which was not that IBM stole from
SCO, but that the open source community needs to be careful about
how it obtains its works.  Even quite innocent actions can be wrong.
For example, at the AUUG conference SCO showed an email from one IBM
engineer to another explaining, very briefly, how he had solved a problem
in AIX.  SCO claim that IBM's UNIX contract assigns all derivative works
back to SCO, and that therefore that idea is owned by SCO.  The point
is not that IBM's UNIX derivations belong to SCO, rather that one IBM
engineer, having had access to AIX source (which undeniably is a UNIX
derivative) gave a hint, in all good faith and probably in ignorance of
the implication, to someone working on Linux.  It's could be that easy
to violate SCO's rights.
