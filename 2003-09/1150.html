&gt; &gt; &gt; Exactly.  It's about more than just websites.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know that.  I realise why people, including myself, are hostile to
&gt; &gt; the'service', but my question, which was really directed at David
&gt; &gt; Lloyd, was what is it about their web terms and conditions that he has
&gt; &gt; a problem with.  I surely hope that they get shut down, but I don't
&gt; &gt; think saying,"I don't agree with your web T&C yet I can't avoid using
&gt; &gt; it," will get far because you can avoid using their SiteFinder.  You
&gt; &gt; just don't use it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Obviously there are a whole raft of other issues, such as them
&gt; &gt; hijacking private and confidential email, but that's nothing to do
&gt; &gt; with their SiteFinder T&C, is it?  Before making a public fuss, I
&gt; &gt; think it's a good idea to ensure that what you plan to say actually
&gt; &gt; makes sense, and hence my question was, by way of Devil's Advocacy,
&gt; &gt; intended to give him a chance to test his complaint.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So how about it, David: What is it about their SiteFinder service that
&gt; &gt; makes you unable to just not use it?
&gt;
&gt; David Newall,
&gt;
&gt; If I may playing devil's advocate for a moment.
&gt;
&gt; I will not use that service but you mistype a domain name into your
&gt; browser and get Versign's sitefinder... Despite that fact that
&gt; you don't intend to using it. Hence you have been
&gt; coerced/seconded/drafted into accepting Sitefinder T&C despite not
&gt; agreeing to it.
&gt;
&gt; No matter how you work it you *can not* opt out, no matter how you
&gt; state the argument.  Domain name typos happen and when they do you are
&gt; "required" to accept the T&C agreement.
&gt;
&gt; Explain a way that the end user can Opt out/recline  or reject the
&gt; Sitefinder service, without using a technical mean (such as iptable/
&gt; ipfilter/ipfw/you_name_it firewall rules, dns hacks, etc). That could
&gt; be an interesting challenge. :-)
&gt;
&gt; George Patterson

technically, even this doesn't stop you using sitefinder, because any queries 
that are sent through it still come back. the best you can do is to disregard 
it when the info is sent back, with iptables/dns hacks/whatever. but even 
_with_ these, you've been sent the IP, which means they've already started 
it.
there is only one way to make sure you don't use it. only one way. and that's 
not to use the Internet. unless you want to have very rigid controls, which 
ensure that nonexistent domain names cannot be queried. if you only ever used 
your ISPs page and software mirror, this might, just might be possible. but 
I'm sure no-one here would accept this as a good solution. basically, the 
only working solution is for verisign to cancel this, and for it to never 
happen again. preferably a legal sentence is placed that ensures no-one tries 
a stunt like this again.

just my $0.022 (w/GST)
