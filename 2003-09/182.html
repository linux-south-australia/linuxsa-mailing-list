&gt;The really interesting thing here is that the training and incompatability
&gt;jump to get from Office 2002 to Office 2003 isn't materially different
&gt;from the training and incompatibility jump to get from Office 2002 to
&gt;OpenOffice.  This should be seen as an opportunity, not a threat.
&gt;  
&gt;
Agreed.

&gt; &gt; This is going to be the showdown in my opinion folks. If we don't team

&gt;
&gt;Huh?  We've survived as a community for over a decade without any realistic
&gt;alternative to MS Office at all. 
&gt;
Good point..

&gt;Why would we suddenly be under threat just because MS decides to change the format of files we've never reliably
&gt;been able to read anyway?
&gt;
To me, the threat is more about the people that do not join the 
community, because of the perception that they won't be able to read 
important documents people send them, etc. These people could well 
become strong contributors to the community.

&gt;....pretend it doesn't have a clause which says that breaking security
&gt;for the purposes of interoperability is a legal circumvention)
&gt;
That's good to know...
