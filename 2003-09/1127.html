the thing which is most frightening - all that stuff wasn't mentioned in 
the media in europe (well - I'm talking about Austria/Germany). finally, 
after only some geek-pages had their daily complaint about that the big 
media companies picked it up...

just like the deep link trial some weeks ago in Germany (there was a 
trial where some media agencies tried to prohibit deep links such as
www.newssite.com/article.html and force the users to link like "go to 
www.newssite.com, click on news, click on the second article, click on 
..." and nobody cared for it - it never appeared somewhere except in a 
few computer magazines. luckily the media agencies lost the trial)

according to some of the Austrian newspapers I read daily it's not over yet

so a quote (orig. in german):
IT-inventions shall only be valid for a patent, when they provide a 
technical contribution - such as computer-aided brakes.


&gt; At least, as far as I can see that is the case. There seems to be a lot
&gt; of confusion in the Anglo media about what happened in Eu parliament
&gt; yesterday. 

yeah. every german/austrian paper writes something different...

&gt; [...] Hopefully that is correct,
&gt; there are some real horrors there such as the process of purchasing
&gt; something with a single click using a web browser.

not to mention patents for the progress bar, storing files together with 
a timestamp, and much more

but nevertheless - it seems as if our polititians finally did something 
at least a little bit NOT wrong...
