&gt; Sounds like you may want to add Samba to your Smoothwall Linux box, so 
&gt; you can store the text file on the Samba/Smoothwall/Linux server. That 
&gt; way you can access it from the program.

(Incidentally, please pardon my shocking grammar in this message - it's 
Friday afternoon and I'm in almost clinical need of a beer)

Err, no...  one of the reasons why Smoothwall's such a tidy little 
product is because it's virtually impenetrable, due to the fact there 
are no extra exploitable services running on it.

I'd have thought that as a security appliance, it would be Bloody Silly 
to then include potentially sensitive data on that machine ?

I've seen it happen a few times where someone says "Oh, you can just 
install {service X} on your Smoothwall", which of course isn't supported 
and it really isn't built for.  The Smoothwall then gets compromised, 
and the person whose network it is/was tears their hair out in 
frustration, goes back to their linux guru friend and asks what to do 
next, and they inevitably say something like "Well you need to learn 
more about linux then", or "Hmm, I'm not really sure how Smoothwall 
works specifically".

I would say NOT to install Samba on your smoothwall Pete, because at the 
present time it's working happily and doing its job, and is independant 
of the rest of your network.  By all means, put another PC on the 
network with linux on it, and fool around with that all you like...  and 
then if you do happen to bugger something up when trying to get samba 
working on it, your firewall won't be compromised, and you'll only have 
one machine to worry about fixing.

Seriously, I reckon you should do some research before giving out advice 
like this - Smoothwall's meant to turn a PC into a firewall 
"appliance"...  just because it's linux based doesn't mean you should 
necessarily just tell everyone to treat it like any other linux box.

Saying that Smoothwall CAN be modified to perform other linux tasks is 
like saying that it's possible to get sexual gratification from a vacuum 
cleaner - i.e. it's best not to bother unless you know exactly what 
you're doing, because you can almost bet that no one wants to know about 
it when things go wrong.
