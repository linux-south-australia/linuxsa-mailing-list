Poor arguments there. You will have to do better than that.

We run mixed Win /Linux environment and both server their purpose

Stability : Contrary to the belief of some people here Windows Servers can
be stable depending on what they are running.
The only time our Win NT F&P server gets rebooted is after essential
security patches. Linux also requires rebooting after Kernels get updated
due to security issues. The only Windows servers I have ever had to
administer that required rebooting weekly was an Exchange 5.5 Server and an
old NT Comms server that had a dicky Eicon Routing card that used to lock
up.

Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor : 2 of our Windows servers and none of our Linux
servers have KB/Mouse/Monitor. Administration of our Win Servers is done
with VNC.

Hardware : Any New Server is quite capable of running Win or Linux. We still
have some production Win NT servers running on Pentium 75 Servers so your
argument falls down there also.

Backup : not much good backing up just your smb.conf file if it is a file
and print server is it. Surely you need to back up the data also ?

I would certainly prefer using Linux/SAMBA servers for F&P as overall Linux
provides a lot more flexibility, but where it falls down is extended
attributes / permissions of files and folders and groups. This is really
easy in Windows but can be a pain in Linux.

The second issue we have with not using Linux/SAMBA servers more is most
currently also act as BDCs. When SAMBA 3.0 finally comes out this point
should "hopefuly" be a non-issue.


I am happy to be corrected on any of these points..so feel free

Not to mention its stability and security :-)

&gt; including a plain text file for configuration - no clickyclicky
&gt; interface which drives you crazy when you want to create more than 20
&gt; shares
&gt;
&gt; configuration backup is easier - just backup the smb.conf and when your
&gt; server has crashed for what reason whatsoever your configuration can
&gt; easily be restored.
&gt;
&gt; and you don't need a keyboard, mouse and monitor for the server after
&gt; you've installed it. just put it in your toilet ;)
