SIPphone, Inc., www.SIPphone.com announces the immediate availability 
of free, worldwide phone calls using the world's first affordable plug 
and play Internet phone. SIPphone is now selling a low cost SIP-based 
phone which plugs into a broadband Internet connection and can send and 
receive voice calls to any other SIP phone. SIP phone users can dial 
friends and co-workers locally or located around the globe with no 
per-minute charges or monthly fees.
"

"
A line of affordable and easy to use SIP phones are being offered for 
the first time exclusively for purchase online at www.sipphone.com. 
Phones are available for immediate order and delivery. Two SIP phones 
can be purchased for just $129 for the pair www.SIPphone/order (limit 
four phones per person). Phones come with an AC adaptor and Ethernet 
cable (RJ45) to plug into a broadband connection. No additional 
configuration is required for most users -- just plug and dial.

Once connected, users can call any other SIP phone or any of the 
thousands of SIP users from around the world on popular SIP 
directories. In addition, toll free 800 and 8xx numbers can be dialed. 
Each SIP phone comes with its own unique SIP number allowing users to 
share their number and receive calls from other SIP users. Unlike a 
landline phone, a SIP phone is fully portable so a SIP phone can be 
moved to any broadband location and all calls to that SIP number will 
ring at this new location.
"

A side benefit. With one of these phones and a 24/7 support service for 
around US$50 a year tech help is available for Lindows users at a very 
low cost.

Cheers,  Ian
