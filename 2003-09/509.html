Kim,

It's even worse than that. With GPL, if someone writes code blob A under GPL
and someone extends this with code blob X to make a combined work A + X, then A
+ X comes under the GPL. But if you have code blob B (under BSD, say) and you
add X to this, then combined work B + X is bound only by the conditions of code
blob B. (Oddly enough, there is no symmetry in this. Even if both A and X are
of the same size, creativity and value, the GPL on A applies to A + X and the
creator of X gets no say in the matter.)

Now with SCO, they are saying that they own blob A and IBM has added blob X.
And IBM wants to combine their X with linux's code blob B.  SCO has claimed
literally that they have an agreement which says that as soon as IBM makes any
addition at all to their code A, then the code X becomes their property. This
is a bit crazy. It might be fair enough that A + X is bound by conditions on A.
But now B + X becomes bound by conditions on A just because at some point in
history, X was combined with A.

The GPL is like a blob which takes ownership of everything which touches it,
but only while it is touching.  The SCO view of its contract with IBM is like a
one-way blob.  It owns whatever touches it, and you can never get it back.
(I'm alluding here of course to the classic film "The Blob".)

Maybe the really crazy thing is that IBM would sign such a ridiculously
one-sided agreement with SCO. Why would their lawyers let that one through?
SCO's licence to IBM was apparently a kind of super-GPL. A GPL++ !!

Cheers,
ak.
