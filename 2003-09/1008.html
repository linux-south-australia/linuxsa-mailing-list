&gt; We have cable going past our door but I am reluctant to go down that
&gt; path.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody got anything good to say about being on bigblonde's cable
&gt; network?

I can't speak from personal experience - I've declined to tap into that very
attractive-looking (from a technical viewpoint) cable I can see dangling
outside my window because I don't concur with Hell$tra's view on what
constitutes a "value for money" broadband access plan[1]. Of course, AirNet
ADSL might not have been the best alternative for me to choose!

A friend who had it until recently (due to moving to a cable/ADSL-deprived
location) swears by it and constantly ribs me for shunning cable broadband.
But $150-odd per Gig excess is bad enough at ADSL speeds, I don't think I'd
ever get to sleep at night knowing that someone could throw a few Gig of
pings at me and I'd be up for a few hundred dollars with no way of defending
myself.

However, it is fast. If you're prone to saying "I want that file and I want
it NOW!" cable may be just the ticket, if you can manage your connection
adequately to avoid the potentially bank-breaking excess fees (e.g. having a
household full of teenagers may not be the ideal circumstance under which to
subscribe to BigPong cable).

[1] Actually, the plan is not that badly priced, it's the excess data
charges that deter me. Very strongly.
