Ryan, feel free to repost this to Linux list because I cant get there.

Looks like AirNet's mail servers have flipped their lids again.

At the moment (yesterday) their phone network was crazy and 
disconnecting at random, at times within a few seconds of reaching a 
voice. 

The other day I tried to get through to their web mail area but it 
knocked back my password. Fair enough but I was already logged into 
that same account using that same password! Seems their web mail system 
went all astray at that time.

After 4 or 5 calls to try to get the email password corrected/checked I 
gave up and emailed them at <A HREF="mailto:support@airnet.com.au.">support@airnet.com.au.</A>

The email came back saying that it could not find 
<A HREF="mailto:support@rt.airnet.com.au.">support@rt.airnet.com.au.</A>

With serious system errors like that I am not too keen to suggest 
others try to join up. Maybe once they get it all working again we can 
reevaluate.

Cheers,  Ian
