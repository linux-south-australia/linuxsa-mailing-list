&gt; Poor arguments there. You will have to do better than that.
&gt;
&gt; We run mixed Win /Linux environment and both server their purpose
&gt;
&gt; Stability : Contrary to the belief of some people here Windows Servers can
&gt; be stable depending on what they are running.
&gt; The only time our Win NT F&P server gets rebooted is after essential
&gt; security patches. 

On several occassions within organisations of several sizes (my last position 
with a windows server role had a few thousand clients connecting to several 
windows NT/2000 servers... a weekly reboot was required otherwise we had 
major stability issues and issues for the users, this was not the case with 
the Unix servers in the same location, which had the same clients connecting)

&gt; Linux also requires rebooting after Kernels get updated due to security 
issues

Yes but not every security update is a kernel update (therefore less reboots), 
whereas in a Windows environment most security updates require a reboot

&gt; The only Windows servers I have ever had to
&gt; administer that required rebooting weekly was an Exchange 5.5 Server and an
&gt; old NT Comms server that had a dicky Eicon Routing card that used to lock
&gt; up.

Hardware issues will take the stability out of all Operating Systems so yes 
thats a valid reason, but I've never had to reboot my clients Lotus Domino 
Server (on Linux) apart from Kernel updates.

&gt;
&gt; Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor : 2 of our Windows servers and none of our Linux
&gt; servers have KB/Mouse/Monitor. Administration of our Win Servers is done
&gt; with VNC.

Terminal Services works too... but as a general rule you still need access to 
a keyboard video and mouse, I don't even use a KVM/or dedicated KB/Monitor to 
install with on Linux :-)

&gt;
&gt; Hardware : Any New Server is quite capable of running Win or Linux. We
&gt; still have some production Win NT servers running on Pentium 75 Servers so
&gt; your argument falls down there also.
&gt;

The same hardware will be more efficient in Linux :-)

&gt; Backup : not much good backing up just your smb.conf file if it is a file
&gt; and print server is it. Surely you need to back up the data also ?
&gt;

My guess is yes :-) thats easy too... I can do it in 1 line on the console or 
in cron or for a more complex environment a small shell script :-) without 
buying yet another expensive piece of software to do it for me. By the way 
this was not my argument, but the back up of server config isn't as easy in 
Windows, which I'm sure was the point.

&gt; I would certainly prefer using Linux/SAMBA servers for F&P as overall Linux
&gt; provides a lot more flexibility, but where it falls down is extended
&gt; attributes / permissions of files and folders and groups. This is really
&gt; easy in Windows but can be a pain in Linux.
&gt;

ACLs would be a nice thing in Linux agreed :-) one of the few things I like 
about Windows 2000 Server

&gt; The second issue we have with not using Linux/SAMBA servers more is most
&gt; currently also act as BDCs. When SAMBA 3.0 finally comes out this point
&gt; should "hopefuly" be a non-issue.
&gt;

Try and see, I haven't used samba for a while ;-)

&gt;
&gt; I am happy to be corrected on any of these points..so feel free
&gt;

I notice you didn't counter the security argument ;-)


I am also happy to be corrected, I am only basing my arguments on personal 
experience, so my circumstances may have been different. I'm just commenting 
on what I have seen.

Regards

Quintin

&gt; &gt; Well, you've got a *n?x/BSD system and all its functionality.
&gt;
&gt; Not to mention its stability and security :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; including a plain text file for configuration - no clickyclicky
&gt; &gt; interface which drives you crazy when you want to create more than 20
&gt; &gt; shares
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; configuration backup is easier - just backup the smb.conf and when your
&gt; &gt; server has crashed for what reason whatsoever your configuration can
&gt; &gt; easily be restored.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and you don't need a keyboard, mouse and monitor for the server after
&gt; &gt; you've installed it. just put it in your toilet ;)
