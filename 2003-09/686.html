&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Apparently Ford also stole the 100-mile carburetor to put in their secret
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Zero Point energy Falcon XR-XXVII ;-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a suspicion that [some] quasars may be the funeral pyres of
&gt;&gt;&gt;alien races who tried to extract zero-point energy and cocked it up.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Not something I really want Ford messing around with...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;As far as Ford goes, the issue is not whether thay can think up such an
&gt;&gt;idea and put it into production, but rather 'will it last 100 miles
&gt;&gt;before the bolts fall out?'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;For linux content, it was reported on groklaw recently that Ford is
&gt;&gt;using linux, so there is hope for the company, as long as it stops
&gt;&gt;taking over ancient marques and turning all the cars into Falcon
&gt;&gt;look-alikes :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; i've got no gripe with Ford. Ford Australia have not actually done
&gt; anything interesting since 1967, but its Ford Europe, that actually
&gt; do interesting things... they have a real challenge as the public
&gt; do actually respond to things like rally results and reasearch into
&gt; new tech, as they car buying public has half a clue[1]. 
&gt; 
&gt; Ford may have baught; Mazda, Volvo, Jaguar and a host of others.
&gt; But they poroduce so much shit that i just doesnt balance out...
&gt; 
&gt; But seriously, wasnt the 100-mile carburetor stolen from the English
&gt; guy[2] who made the Cobra?
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Kim
&gt; [1] from time to time, unlike in australia, as the public still buy falcons =P
&gt; [2] a relative of Lucas wan't it? =P
&gt; 
I beg to differ, current BA Falcon is actually a very nice car, I find 
it very interesting. I don't own one, but I do work in the Automotive 
Industry (not for FORD).
It's very interesting that a company can make such a big pile of poop 
like the AU & AU2 then come back from the dead with a beauty like the BA.

Cheers,
David Creed
