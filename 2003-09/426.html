&gt; Interesting, but I would guess a lot of attendees would probably already
&gt; know plenty about Linux.

Which I don't see as a negative thing; it's not just about making people aware
of Linux, it's making people aware of the Linux COMMUNITIES in Adelaide.

R

&gt; Bigger still would be to do the next Adelaide Show or Home Expo and get
&gt; the message to the general public.

&gt; &gt;  Ok. Random thought processes sometimes throw up ideas that
&gt; &gt;  might seem to be stupid but actually contain the kernel of a
&gt; &gt;  good idea. I have them all the time. This is just another
&gt; &gt;  one. It isn't likely to be either right or wrong but
&gt; &gt;  somewhere in between. It is shared with you in case others
&gt; &gt;  think there is some merit in the idea.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  An estimated 9,500 visitors attended the last Wiredup Expo,
&gt; &gt;  and this year's event will be held in the newly renovated
&gt; &gt;  and enlarged Adelaide Convention Centre. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Held at Adelaide Convention Centre on November 1-2 from 10am-5pm.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Wired Up is a big event on the IT calendar. Lots of IT folks
&gt; &gt;  visit the show. Lots of companies and groups put on a stand
&gt; &gt;  and do demonstrations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Why not a "Linux in SA" stand?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  We could approach the organisers for cheep rate (free?)
&gt; &gt;  stand and there are enough of us to share the load to staff
&gt; &gt;  the booth. We could hook in suppliers for stuff to
&gt; &gt;  sell/offer/giveaway/support our costs.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  We could tell people about LCA2004. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  We could tell people about the OSS mini conference and the
&gt; &gt;  Education and other mini conferences.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  We could tell people about CSDN and give CDs away/ sell for $2.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  We could work with ComputerBank SA and tell people what they
&gt; &gt;  do and help them seek corporate support for donor computers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  We could do a great deal of excellent publicity for
&gt; &gt;  ourselves and the Linux / Open Source movement.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  But ... there is always a but ... we, you and I and all of
&gt; &gt;  us ... would need to extract the digit and work together to
&gt; &gt;  make it happen ... it wont happen any other way.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  So there is the idea and the challenge. Now up to each of
&gt; &gt;  you to think it through and comment.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Again, where and when?
&gt; &gt;  Adelaide Convention centre, November 1-2 from 10am-5pm, entry is $10.
