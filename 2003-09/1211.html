Hi Dan,

* Dan Shearer &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dan@shearer.org">dan@shearer.org</A>&gt; [2003-09-28 00:16]:
&gt; I just had reason to check my reject logs, because people have been
&gt; telling me that this latest Microsoft worm is generating lots of
&gt; messages. My conclusion is that rcpt-time block _really_ works. I
&gt; haven't even bothered to look at my anti-spam checks for months, but I 
&gt; am not vulnerable to the latest auto-spam doing the rounds. And my CPU
&gt; has been bumbling along near zero :-)
&gt; 
&gt; According to the logs I have rejected 400 messages containing the string
&gt; "microsoft.com" in the headers, out of 7000 rejected messages in total.
&gt; And not one of these messages cost me significant data, because I
&gt; dropped the message as soon as the sender was identified as bogus
&gt; (before the SMTP "DATA" command.)
&gt; 
&gt; RCPT-time checking is implemented in Exim in an ACL structure, ie you
&gt; put together a simple ACL statement along the lines of what you might do
&gt; in a Squid or Apache config file. There is also a milter for Sendmail
&gt; that will do something similar.
&gt; 
&gt; The two checks I do which stop huge amounts of spam are:
&gt; 
&gt; 	1. Does "<A HREF="mailto:sender@senderdomain">sender@senderdomain</A>" positively not exist? Spammers
&gt; 	still usually post from spoofed or otherwise unrepliable places.
&gt; 	A callout starts an SMTP delivery but stops before the DATA
&gt; 	statement, unless there was previously an error message (if
&gt; 	there is an MTA at all, or an MX at all, etc.)
&gt; 
&gt; 		==&gt; one line in a config file.
&gt; 
&gt; 	2. Does "<A HREF="mailto:postmaster@senderdomain">postmaster@senderdomain</A>" positively not exist? Would
&gt; 	you believe, neither spammers nor automated virus-generated
&gt; 	addresses tend to survive this test because they don't tend
&gt; 	to have properly-run domains :-)
&gt; 
&gt; 		==&gt; one line in a config file.
&gt; 
&gt; This saves bandwidth and CPU. I simply don't have to process any of that
&gt; junk because it never crossed the border into my network.
&gt; 
&gt; After that, I push the surviving mail through Spam Assassin at DATA
&gt; time, before I accept the message into a queue. So if SA doesn't like it
&gt; I have paid for the bandwidth and the CPU, but at least it hasn't
&gt; clogged my spool areas (and in a site that runs Windows I would then
&gt; need to virusscan the messages, so SA saves that step at least.)
&gt; 
&gt; Exim is so far the only main MTA that has got this facility neatly
&gt; packaged by default. Postfix/qmail require source hacking as far as I
&gt; know and there is an addon for Sendmail that can do something similar,
&gt; but it isn't handled in any kind of integrated way. Interestingly there
&gt; has been a lot of discussion about covering this sort of checking
&gt; behaviour in the RFCs.
&gt; 

That's pretty good. I have managed to get some of what you have (but in postfix)
by using a regex list on header_checks, and keep a largish list of known spam
senders in the sender_access list, and using amavisd-new to pump the email through
SA and AV. I can add whatever to the header_checks list, but I have to admit I
don't plug in every new threat. Generally, consistant spammers usually land up in
there with a custom and personalised reject notice :)

&gt; Wietse lead a discussion on the Postfix development list a while ago
&gt; exploring the cases in which callouts can cause problems, but I think
&gt; practical experience shows that it is a very effective tool with no
&gt; serious side-effects.
&gt; 
&gt; If Exim is out of your experience and you don't have time to investigate
&gt; it, consider putting it in as a skinny application proxy in front of
&gt; your existing mail gateway. It really isn't that hard and your users
&gt; will thank you for it!

Mine don't even realise the gateway is doing this stuff. It just works. They can
get peeved if someone sends a .exe through the system, cause they aren't going to
get it easily :)

Michael
