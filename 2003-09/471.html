<H1>how to edit/generate vietnamese HTML pages in linux?</H1>

Well now I've just spent another several hours trying to work out how to
edit vietnamese-language HTML pages in linux, and just as in the last
6 years (I try this unsuccessfully once a year!), I've become exhausted
before I get the answer.

If anyone out there has experience in this sort of activity, could you
please tell me how it is done? More generally, I'd be interested in
general utf-8 HTML page or PHP script editing. (You never know when you
might need to write up something in Russian, Sanskrit or Runic!)

What I wanted to do was to either 

1. edit a file in VIQR, and get some tool to convert from VIQR to UTF-8, or 

2. get vim to edit UTF-8 files directly. 

Probably method 1 is the more robust way of doing it. But method 2 is
preferable for seeing what's being written. 

There are just heaps of clues everywhere on the net and in the linux help
manuals, but not enough for me to how to do it.

If I type:
fgrep -i vn /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/compose.dir

I get this, which is intriguing.
vi_VN.viscii/Compose            vi_VN.VISCII
vi_VN.tcvn/Compose              vi_VN.TCVN
en_US.UTF-8/Compose             vi_VN.UTF-8
vi_VN.viscii/Compose:           vi_VN.VISCII
vi_VN.tcvn/Compose:             vi_VN.TCVN
en_US.UTF-8/Compose:            vi_VN.UTF-8

When I search on the web, I find at sourceforge some .NET/java/MS-windows
software for conversion. 

I've read in a few places that "vim" is supposed to be able to do UTF-8.  In
fact, I've found commands in vim which do set it up for UTF-8 if I can get my
keyboard to send the right sorts of codes.  Doing ordinary áççêñt§ is easy, but
doing beyond iso-8859-1 is the difficult thing.

In this <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose

there are character composition rules which include the VN characters, but
they all use a keycode or keysym called &lt;dead_acute&gt;. I have no idea
how I make this character. Maybe it's one of those xmodmap things.
I also need keys &lt;dead_belowdot&gt; and &lt;dead_breve&gt; etc. Pretty soon I'm going
to run out of modifier keys.

The Unicode HOWTO has clues, but they seem to be about 2.5 years out of date.
They talk about downloading and installing lots of stuff, but I'm pretty sure
it must be possible to do everything with the most up-to-date vim, X-window
system, xterm etc. without patching.

Can anyone tell me the answer? My Mozilla browser crashed under the weight of
all the weird font encodings while reading VN sites and unicode fonts etc.
So now I've even lost all my promising links.
 
CHeers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. The immediate application of the above VN encoding is going to be
commentating my holiday pictures from vietnam a few years ago.
But being able to encode IPA for pronunciation keys would be neat too.
