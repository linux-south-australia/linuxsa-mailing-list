&gt; AK, I'd almost agree with you except that:
&gt; 
&gt; SCO don't quite seem to know what they want to do.  They are sueing/they 
&gt; aren't.  They are requiring people to have licenses/they aren't.  They 
&gt; seem all over the place.  They seem like amateurs in all this who're 
&gt; just bouncing around the place without clear sense of things.
&gt; 
&gt; If it really was MS behind this (and I'm not entirely convinced they 
&gt; don't have at least some hand in it) then I'd have thought the strategy 
&gt; would have been much better thought out.  Let's face MS really stands 
&gt; for Marketing Supremcy.

MMC,

Yes, but....

If SCO behaved in a professional MS-like manner, that would give the game away.
So I think the amateurism is a cloak, a disguise, a feint to cover the origins
of the actions. The changes of posture are exactly what you would get if you
were being masterminded by someone else but kept getting your instructions
mixed up. After all, MS marketing people speak in a manner which people like me
just can't understand. I would say it's just a matter of misinterpretation of
instructions from their controllers. If the commands from MS HQ are as clear as
their help manuals, it's no wonder SCO's behaviour is erratic.

So that's what it must be: mixed-up commands from MS, plus an intentional added
randomness to confuse observors. It's a bit like those moles in British
intelligence pretending to be drunken, womanizing party-goers to cover their
true activities.

The faux-amateurism of SCO also makes MS look stately and serene above it all.
It all has the appearance of a perfect marketing campaign to me.
That's how I would have organised it if I had an evil mind.

Cheers,
ak.
