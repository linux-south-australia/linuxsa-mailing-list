 &gt; I notice Telstra are buying back $1B of their issued stock.  I wonder
 &gt; if that's a pre-cursor to spinning off the local loop as a separate

Highly unlikely.

Shares are commodities.  One of the major factors that influences 
commodity pricing is supply and demand.  All other factors being
equal, if everyone wants to sell (i.e., supply is high) then the
price drops.

The Government wants to sell.  Indeed, they want to dilute the 
market place by means of a short-term (managed) dumping of over
half of Telstra's value.  We're talking billions of dollars here.

(The Government may sell substantially less than this - Politically
they'd only need to sell their controlling interest to appease the
economic whackos who think a telco can't be successful if it's half
Government owned -- In ignorance of the financial state of most of
the successful telcos in the world!  That may mean the Government 
only needs to sell 10% to get rid of their controlling interest and
obtain a reasonable cash influx for pork-barrelling)

Anyway, that means the marketplace is about to be awash with Telstra
shares.  Supply is about to increase by 100% (in the event of a full
sale).  Unless demand also increases by 100% (which is highly unlikely),
that means the Telstra share price is about to take a nose-dive.  The
pre-sale publicity won't draw any attention to that, but it's bound to
happen, especially if the price is pumped artificially by layoffs and
cap-ex freezes in the 12 months leading up to the sale.

You'll note that the second tranche of Telstra yeilded exactly that
result:  The shares came onto the market at nearly twice their real
value, and very shortly after the sale the market corrected itself
by making Telstra's price drop off a sheer wall.

In that context, a buy-back scheme is totally expected as a means of
restricting supply.  Remember that Telstra's directors are legally obligated
to maximize returns for shareholder investments, so the prudent thing for
them to do is to minimize the negative impact which T3 will predictably
have.  The less shares there are in circulation when the full sale happens,
the lower the chance that Telstra's price will nosedive again.  The buyback
makes even more sense if Ziggy and Co know that the Govt is only going
to sell a few percent -- that means they only need to buy back a few
percent to maintain supply at its present level.
