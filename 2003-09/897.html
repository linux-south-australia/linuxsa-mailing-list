Andy,

If you are after a nice business orientated desktop then take a look at
Dropline (<A HREF="http://www.dropline.net/gnome">http://www.dropline.net/gnome</A>) built upon Slackware 9.0.   Its
very easy to get going and maintain.   It based around gnome 2.2 (new
version 2.4) and has been customised to present quite a nice looking
desktop.  Did I also mention is is capable of self updating ?

It has alot of very good applications already installed that will cover a
majority of your XP desktop requirements, web/mail/office tools etc.   I
would seriously check it out as a possible XP replacement.

I would recomend having Nvidia based video cards and installing the
relevant Nvidia drivers.   This gives you better desktop performance with
multimedia applications like Xine.

In all I've found Dropline to be a very tidy desktop, there are a few
quirks in gnome that are being ironed out.  I'm yet to install the new
desktop based around gnome 2.4 (released on Thursday last week ~300Mb
download).

Not familiar enough with GnuCash to offer any assitance with book keeping.

If you want any of the files/CD's for Slackware or Dropline then hollar.

Cheers

Matthew

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt;   I am a Linux newbie so be nice  ;-)
&gt;
&gt;   We are looking at doing a full migration to  Linux from
&gt; Microsoft's Windows XP. Over the years we have briefly looked at
&gt; different distributions from Mandrake, Corel & Caldera. What we want
&gt; to do  now is completely switch over to Linux permanently without
&gt; the dual-boot safety  net that has seen us return to Microsoft on so
&gt; many occasions in the past. What  I need to do prior to the
&gt; migration is enusre that certain areas of software are  covered by
&gt; reliable, stable Linux apps. We already have some areas of software
&gt; covered (for instance Open Office instead of Office XP, Konqueror
&gt; instead of IE6  and one of many different e-mail handlers instead of
&gt; outlook  express).
&gt;
&gt;   Is there a Linux equivalent of  Microsoft Outlook? We use the
&gt; calendar & task features of it for booking  appointments. One other
&gt; area we need to address is our accounting package.  Currently we use
&gt; Intuit's Quickbooks Pro. If there is some form of Linux app  that
&gt; can do this job of bookkeeping including GST tracking? If so then
&gt; let the migration begin ;-)
&gt;
&gt;   Thankyou to all who have taken time to read this  message and
&gt; bigger thanks in advance to those who post any helpful hints or
suggestions.
&gt;
&gt;   Andy.
