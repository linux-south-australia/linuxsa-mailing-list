&gt;  &gt; I must admit that I'm confused what you will say.  I think it's about
&gt;  &gt; your refusal to agree to their terms and conditions, at least that's
&gt;  &gt; what it was about when you first brought this up here.  I just can't
&gt;  &gt; see what the problem is.  If you type a missing .com or .net address
&gt;  &gt; then VeriSign's SiteFinder will appear.  If you don't accept their
&gt;  &gt; terms and conditions then you don't click any of the links, or use the
&gt;  &gt; search button.  Where's the problem? 
&gt; 
&gt; Email correspondents who mistype your address will end up accidentally
&gt; sending private, personal, confidential communications intended solely
&gt; for your eyes into Verisign's mail server.

Exactly.  It's about more than just websites.

Any DNS query that doesn't resolve will currently resolve to 64.94.110.11.
That means any email you send to <A HREF="mailto:yourfriend@ozemil.com">yourfriend@ozemil.com</A> (note the typo) will
go successfully through to any mail server that could be running on that
IP, all because ozemil.com "doesn't exist."  Under the new system
introduced by Verisign, it now resolves to the above IP, meaning that
Verisign potentially have the means to accept any mis-addressed
email and do what they wish with it.

It means now that if you type 'nslookup any-site-that-doesnt-exist.com' you
will be getting Verisign's sitefinder IP address.  This is wrong.  It may
"help" users who have little idea of what they are doing -- the kind of
users who get concerned when their NineMSN home page is suddenly changed to
something else -- but for anyone with a clue, this is a most irritating
problem.

At least with something like Internet Explorer's inbuilt system which pops
up a "helpful" page whenever you type in a site that doesn't exist, you can
use a different web browser.  Here, because Verisign are controlling the
top level .net and .com domains, there is nothing we can do to prevent
resolving the domains in this manner (except patching bind as may have been
mentioned previously.)

It's monopolisation, and it's not fair.  There is no way to compete with
something like this.

Do you think Microsoft will release a patch for Windows, because this takes
away functionality of their own search finder tool? ;)
