&gt;     becoming many times worse than web performance in the USA.
&gt; 
&gt;   - Steps which can be taken by users to increase the limits on TCP
&gt;     performance.  Including:
&gt; 
&gt;     - new purchasing criteria for PCs and network equipment.
&gt; 
&gt;     - tuning the Linux kernel's TCP implementation and other wizard
&gt;       stuff.

The idea of modifying TCP stacks so as to increase end-to-end bitrate from 10
Mbps to 100 Mbps sounds somewhat bizarre to me.  That sounds fine if there is
only one user on the net. But suppose everyone on the net wants to use their
100 Mbps. Now you have a network which is so congested that you're back to
where you started from, with the difference that the inequality between
privileged users and ordinary users is much increased.

Are users going to use the 100 Mbps to watch HDTV over the net or something?
What is going to be done to stop the elite 100 Mbps TCP stack owners from
swamping the net to make it unusable for the rest of us?  Until there are
serious mechanisms in place to fairly share bandwidth on the net, tuning up
some users to use all the bandwidth sounds like a recipe for network misery.
Is there fair queueing in place throughout the Australian internet?

&gt;   - The Web100 project -- automating TCP tuning wizardry for the
&gt;     masses

I take it this is the website:
<A HREF="http://www.web100.org/">http://www.web100.org/</A>
This PDF document seems to give some sort of technical background:
<A HREF="http://www.web100.org/docs/pam_paper_final.pdf">http://www.web100.org/docs/pam_paper_final.pdf</A>
Like many, many papers I've read in the teletraffic area, this one considers
just one user on one network path - ignoring global objectives and global
constraints because these are more difficult to analyse.

I would like to suggest (perhaps a little provocatively, but in all seriousness)
that tuning up TCP stacks to do 100 Mbps on the open Internet is about as
socially responsible as optimising spam software to send 10 times faster.

The motivations I can think of for tuning TCP stacks in this way include:
-	proving that it can be done, as a kind of technical exercise,
-	improving things for a small number of users who really need
	the bandwidth, like maybe some medical uses, although medical
	uses probably shouldn't be subject to the vaguaries of the open
	internet anyway. (And real-time applications probably should be
	using UDP.)

Cheers,
ak.
