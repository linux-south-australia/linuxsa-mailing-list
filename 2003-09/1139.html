John,

&gt; Yes please :) Were they the Symbol ones, or something else?

Something else, AFAIK; this was when I was working in Sydney on contract for
Southern Cross Cables at Comdex or CeBIT or something; the guy was a salesman
representing some new company from Japan or something, although he was very
tech knowledgable (explained in quite a bit of detail how the phones worked
behind NAT; can't remember what exactly was said, though).

The units didn't have a digital display or anything fancy like that - they
were basic units, but they were incredibly clear (as always, I was skeptical),
and (as he demonstrated) you could throw the device (USB based reciever
thingy) into a new computer, feed its drivers to it, and you'd be away - they
even had this ICQ-like application where you'd see all your known contacts,
and each phone would have its own roaming number, although it was a
subscription based thing (presumably why the phones were so cheap, but there
was no obligation to join the service).  The phones were also protocol
compliant or something though, which meant it'd work with other applications too.

This was two years ago though; the company might not even be around anymore.

I'll post back to the list if I find the documentation.
