&gt; &gt;That's why it was a major lost opportunity when the US govt tried
&gt; &gt;to break up MS instead of doing the really sensible thing and insisting
&gt; &gt;that all of MS's file formats and protocols should be published in full.
&gt; &gt;Now we have the crazy situation where reverse engineering MS file
&gt; &gt;formats and protocols will be actually _against_ the law, not
&gt; &gt;required by law. So the DMCA is very substantially reinforcing and
&gt; &gt;protecting a monopoly.

an illegal monopoly, is it not?

&gt; &gt;Looking more broadly, US-aligned govts in the last 10 years have
&gt; &gt;acted to sell of monopolies to private companies,

this is a requirement of the WTO.
the WTO seems to be quite firmly against State run monolpolies...

&gt; &gt;bring in laws to
&gt; &gt;reinforce intellectual monopolies (patents, copyrights), and free up
&gt; &gt;markets so that big fish can eat little fish more easily, thereby
&gt; &gt;creating more monopolies. Seen against that background, linux is
&gt; &gt;going against the cultural and political trend in US-aligned countries
&gt; &gt;towards monopoly economics. I.e. We don't have a chance.....
&gt; &gt;MS will maintain its monopoly and linux will remain a little fish.
&gt; That was a well thought out and convincing read too. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; If a "better" tool were developed by the Open Source Community, that the 
&gt; population has more of a desire to use, do you think we then have a 
&gt; chance ? Do you still think we don't have a chance unless some sort of 
&gt; open formats law passed ?

I imagine that Linux/GNU/BSD/OSS communities will slowly educate more
of the Joe [Six Pack|Public] and will, step by step grow where MS dont
want them, in the homes of Joe Public. Is this not where the DRM is
supposed to be King? DRM is kinda implemented in the corporate end,
and that is already feeling the heat from Linux/GNU/BSD/OSS software.
And DRM == "profit"

Think about it from a small business point of view.
there is nothing wrong with slow growth. its maintainable.
it has shown to be self supporting in the Linux community at
least. for example, in London seven years ago there was one
Linux users group, now there are more than ten. there seems
to be a locality and social scale/size limitation where user
groups can work and grow, then split reorganise then repeat
and "spread the word" or "infect new users" =)

cheers,

Kim
