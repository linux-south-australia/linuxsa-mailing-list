&gt; It's like this.  1500 down 256 up.  I don't want to go to some website
&gt; and start downloading a file expecting to get 1500 when all I would
&gt; really get is 256 because TCP would rate limit me(flow control) because
&gt; of mp upload speed.  This is just my preference and I guess if it
&gt; doesn't do that then I am more than happy to go with ADSL but if TCP
&gt; does do that then barring the cost go with SDSL.  I do understand about
&gt; all the myriad of things that can go on between me and this website but
&gt; in theory if that site and myself had unhampered bandwidth then I want
&gt; 1500 down and 256 up, and I don't want TCP to control my connection to
&gt; 256/256.  I don't know if it works like I want it too but that is what I
&gt; want.  Does that make more sense now?  Is it possible to get 1500/256
&gt; not 256/256?  I do serve things but that is purely not the issue here.

i think your a little confused.

if i'm downloading a 100MB file, the packets coming in bring 100MB worth of
data (plus some overhead for packet headers). the packets going out are
very small with the data consisting of the next expected TCP sequence
number.

(if that still isn't clear, have a read of
<A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/ip.htm">http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/cisintwk/ito_doc/ip.htm</A>)

hence running at 1500/256 you will still receive packets at up to 1500 even
if what you are sending in reply is equal to or less than 256.
