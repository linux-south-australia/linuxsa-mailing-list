&gt; Ben,

&gt;&gt;;-) )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;what do you reckon?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see /why/ you need drivers?

Things like:
  - multimedia buttons (8 on my current keyboard) and alternate 
navigation buttons (there's 10 on my current keyboard, plus a scroll 
wheel on the side of it that i use constantly now)
  - making X to realise that there's more than 101 keys on standard PC 
keyboards nowadays.
  - making the real peripheral names show up during an install (or 
hardware browse) - it looks better from a user's point of view to have 
the OS recognise "Logitech Internet Navigator keyboard" and "Logitech 
MX500 Optical Mouse" than "standard 101-key keyboard" and "generic wheel 
mouse".
  - supporting extra buttons on mice (a lot of higher-end mice have more 
than 3 buttons now).
  - i'm sure there's more i haven't thought of

or, merely for the kudos of being known to support open source. to use 
the same example as in my first email, nvidia's graphics cards currently 
don't have much going for them over ATI's cards; yet their support of 
open source (which i believe is better so far than ATI) keeps me buying 
(and recommending for linux use) nvidia cards.

there's plenty of reasons. they're all desktop-related (no-one cares 
what kind of keyboard might be attached to a server when you're SSHed 
in), but The Desktop is supposed to be the Next Big Thing and all ;-)
