Hello,

I am relatively new to Linux, yet it has taken me about 12 months of
reading, trying things out, installs, re-installs, mostly experimentation in
my own time. I never knew what it all meant until recently.

Finaly I am now able to install and configure the real need in my case, the
firewall,  connects to my internet account and to LAN's and sending this
email !
Hooray.

Having said this, I think it is time to start the next phase and how better
else to start is by askng questions then doing it.
Perhaps my questions have been asked before. I do not know. I have read many
many questions and their answers, kept files on some of them, but still not
sure on many what seems to be simple things.
So if I ask some of the most seemingly simplest of questions, rest assured,
I have already tried to read up on the particular issue, but simply may not
comprehend the authors reply or the answers are by now out of date.
 That is not to say we are all illiterate, I think it has something to do
with the learning phase level of where one is currently at.

May I start with a few ideas of my own. These are not demands or something I
need to have done RIGHT NOW.
Just ideas and possibly an opinion here or there.

This is my final bash on MS.
Firstly, my opinion on MS, I do not regard the MS OS to be of much value for
stability, BUT, I must admit, the XP Pro version has allowed me to offer MS
a "2nd chance", for now. I am getting my work done with less "disturbances".
The "restore system" function has saved me much time with format c:\  (
averaged 1 every 3-6 months since 95)
But why all this extra stuff during install I will never actualy use ?!! But
if deleted or uninstalled, it can compromise the rest of the OS.
What does MS care? on and on it goes, these issues have been thrashed and
still you cannot halt the Goliath of MS.

Fortunately there are alterantives.
I got my Linux firewall, I can "see" the light now and it's time to move on.

Thank you Open Scource Community
I hope to contribute back the same help in good time.

This is just great !

cheers

Pete B
