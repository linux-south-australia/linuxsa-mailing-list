Hello,

     I have been wondering recently which S/ADSL service to purchase and
well I have a few questions that I figured might be answered here.  Take
for example 6 files each 100MB in size.  The upstream all the way can
handle this and congestion is not a factor at this point.  My ADSL
connection is 1500/256 as offered by a couple of ISPs in town.  Now I
would like to download all 6 files as quick as possible.  I have been
told that downloading each file one at a time is just as quick as
downloading all 6 at the same time.  Now as far as I know there are ways
to control your "flow control" in TCP so would that allow me to download
faster all 6 at one time or would that not matter?  Well I hope I
haven't been too vague but I'd like to know if ADSL is for me or if SDSL
is for me on that problem alone.  I understand the basic differences
between the two.  If I can download all 6 at the same time faster than 1
at a time then I'd go with ADSL, but if not then I'd have to go with
SDSL.  Any thoughts on this?

Chris-
