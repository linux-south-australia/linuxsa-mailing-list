&gt; &gt; Hi All   Am looking for some input on these OS, Redhat / SuSE, would 
&gt; &gt; like to find out what people think about it and what is the most

&gt; 
&gt; Well personally I prefer SuSE over RedHat. But it's really just personal 
&gt; opinion. Either distrobution will be fairly stable, both have graphical 
&gt; and easy to follow installers (although if you do a graphical install 
&gt; with RedHat, and don't have a mouse, don't expect to finish it).
&gt; 

Way back around Redhat 5.2, I changed over to SuSE, and at that time it
was arguably significantly better than Redhat. Since SuSE 6.2, I have
noticed accelerating deterioration of SuSE, even though I've stuck with it.
It's installation scripts get worse and worse - less functional, less
comprehensible, less reliable etc. etc.

But at times when an exploit need to be patched against, that's where you
lose with SuSE. They have been very, very slow to release RPMs in the 
last couple of years. Emergency security fixes have to be done by
downloading source and rebuilding if you use SuSE. Here's their current list
of advisories:
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/en/private/support/security/index.html">http://www.suse.de/en/private/support/security/index.html</A>

Sometimes these advisories appear months after the Redhat or Debian
or Gentoo advisories.

In the current OpenSSH emergency, Gentoo has this on OpenSSH 3.7.
(Nothing on 3.7.1 yet.)
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/gentoo_advisory-3629.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/gentoo_advisory-3629.html</A>

Redhat has this:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/redhat_advisory-3628.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/redhat_advisory-3628.html</A>
They seem to have back-ported the patch to earlier OpenSSH versions.

Whoops. This time SuSE is as quick as the others:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/suse_advisory-3632.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/suse_advisory-3632.html</A>

Oh well, this time they're all pretty much equivalent, although I can't
find the SuSE OpenSSH fix on their site yet.

Anyway.....

CHeers,
ak.
