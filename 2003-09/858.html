I didn't write this, I have no idea who did,
there may be places where my views and their's coincide,
there are other places where we disagree.
Enjoy it anyway.

 Ian,
 from Adelaide, South Australia

 WE ARE AUSTRALIANS! (Australia Explained) 

 WE, the people of a free nation of blokes, sheilas and the
 occasional wanker. We come from many lands (although a few
 too many of us come from New Zealand) and although we live
 in the best country in the world, we reserve the right to
 bitch and moan about it whenever we bloody like. 

 We are One Nation but we're divided into many States: 

 First, there's Victoria, named after a queen who didn't
 believe in lesbians. Victoria is the realm of Mossimo
 turtlenecks, cafe latte, grand-final day and big horse
 races. Its capital is Melbourne, whose chief marketing pitch
 is that "it's livable". At least that's what they think. The
 rest of us think it is too bloody cold and wet. 

 Next, there's NSW, the realm of pastel shorts, macchiato
 with sugar, thin books read quickly and millions of dancing
 queens. Its capital, Sydney, has more queens than any other
 city in the world and is proud of it. Its mascots are Bondi
 lifesavers who pull their Speedos up their cracks to keep
 the left and right sides of their brains separate. 

 Down south we have Tasmania, a state based on the notion
 that the family that bonks together stays together. In
 Tassie, everyone gets an extra chromosome at conception.
 Maps of the State bring smiles to the sternest faces. It
 holds the world record for a single mass shooting, which the
 Yanks can't seem to beat no matter how often they try. 

 South Australia is the province of half-decent reds, a
 festival of foreigners and bizarre axe murders. SA is the
 state of innovation. Where else can you so effectively reuse
 country bank vaults and barrels as in Snowtown, just out of
 Adelaide (also named after a queen). They had the Grand
 Prix, but lost it when the views of Adelaide sent the
 Formula One drivers to sleep at the wheel. 

 Western Australia is too far from anywhere to be relevant.
 It's main claim to fame is that it doesn't have daylight
 saving because if it did all the men would get erections on
 the bus on the way to work. WA was the last state to stop
 importing convicts and many of them still work there in the
 government and business. 

 The Northern Territory is the red heart of our land. Outback
 plains, sheep stations the size of Europe, Kangaroos,
 Jackeroos, Emus, Uluru and dusty kids with big smiles. It
 also has the highest beer consumption of anywhere on the
 planet and its creek beds have the highest aluminium content
 of anywhere too. Although the Territory is the centre piece
 of our national culture, few of us live there and the rest
 prefer to fly over it on our way to Bali. 

 And there's Queensland... While any mention of God seems
 silly in a document defining a nation of half-arsed
 sceptics, it is worth noting that God probably made
 Queensland - it's beautiful one day and perfect the next.
 Why he filled it with dickheads remains a mystery. 

 Oh yes, and there's the ACT (Canberra). The least said the
 better. 

 We, the citizens of Oz, are united by Highways, whose
 treacherous twists and turns kill more of us each year than
 murderers. We are united in our lust for international
 recognition. 

 Not that we're whingeing; we leave that to our Pommie
 immigrants. We want to make "no worries mate" our national
 phrase, "she'll be right mate" our national attitude and
 "Waltzing Matilda" our national anthem. 

 (So what if it's about a sheep-stealing crim who commits
 suicide??) 

 We love sport so much our news readers can read the death
 toll from a sailing race and still tell us who's winning.
 And we're the best in the world at all the sports that
 count, like cricket, netball, rugby,AFL, roo-shooting, two-
 up and horse racing. We also have the biggest rock, the
 tastiest pies, the blackest aborigines and the worst-dressed
 Olympians in the known universe. 

 We shoot, we root, we vote. We are girt by sea and pissed by
 lunchtime. Even though we might seem a racist, closed-
 minded, sports-obsessed little people, at least we feel
 better for it. 

 I am, you are, we are Australian.
