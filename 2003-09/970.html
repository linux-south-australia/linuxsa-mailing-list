DSL,

&gt; You could also track Debian Sarge quite nicely.

Sarge is designed to throw working packages from unstable all together nicely
for the next stable release; as a result, there's often weeks of broken
packages where things AREN'T fixed, and the entire system is in a broken mess,
until an appropriate fix is made in unstable, and successfuly migrated over.

I strongly DON'T recommend using sarge; I've already had issues this week
where somebody 'upgraded' a stable server to testing, and all sorts of things
broke, including mysqld.  I remember, amongst other things, a year or so ago a
broken fsck made its way into testing; it worked fine in unstable, but there
was some dependency that wasn't checked properly; so anybody who upgraded
their system, rebooted, and had the appropriate filesystem (ReiserFS? Can't
remember...) would find everything would be corrupted.  Lovely.

Use stable with third party trusted repositries, or build your own packages -
it's incredibly easy to backport stuff from sid (usually as simple as adding a
deb-src line in sources.conf for unstable, apt-get source &lt;package&gt;,
dpkg-buildpackage, then dpkg -i &lt;package&gt;).
