&lt;quote who="Barney Wrightson"&gt;
&gt; I was just browsing the site, and have a query about the key signing.
&gt; How many people do you think will have 2 photo IDs? I personally have 2
&gt;  but the passport photo is a little old (I was 4) so I don't think that
&gt;  will cut it. Student ids, passports and drivers licences are the 3
&gt; majors I can think of, and I would guess there are a significant number
&gt;  of people that don't have either of the first 2.

It's really up to you how much ID you bring.

If people don't know you personally, they won't sign your keys unless you
can prove to them who you are.  Photo ID is usually the best bet.
At last year's LCA I only had a drivers licence, a medicare card, and (I
think) a credit card.  Consequently only about 10 or so people signed my
key - I wasn't able to establish trust.  I'm sure I would have faired
better with more ID.  Some people brought student IDs, passports, drivers
licences, company badges etc.
The morale - bring what ID you can - it's up to each person whose keys
they sign, it's your job to convince them.--
