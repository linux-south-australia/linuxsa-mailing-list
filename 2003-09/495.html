&gt; Well, there were two snippets highlighted at SCO forum.  The first one
&gt; came from the Third Edition of UNIX (1973), the second came from BSD.
&gt; Given those facts, it's not surprising that they have to admit they
&gt; don't know where it comes from.  What I want to know is when they will
&gt; admit that their version doesn't have the BSD license at the
&gt; beginning.  See <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html</A>
&gt; (yet again).
&gt;

When I first heard SCO claiming that the BPF code sample was not supposed
to be evidence of real System V code in Linux, just a demonstration of the
techniques involved. I thought is was a good recovery from a bad mistake by
SCO but as I though about it some more I realised that it was not a good
recovery and nothing could cover up a crucial mistake by SCO.

If the SCO BPF code was merely a demonstration of the techniques involved
why on earth would they want to obfuscate the SCO BPF code with the Greek
letters?  There was no SCO intellectual property to protect and using the
obfuscated SCO BPF code weakened the "claimed" technique demonstration.

In other words the reason SCO obfuscated the BPF code is because they
thought it was their own code. Which adds more weight to Gregs question
about the lack of the BSD license in SCO's BPF source file.
