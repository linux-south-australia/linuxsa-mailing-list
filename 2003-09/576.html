Hi There,
    Basically what you are paying for when you buy one of these packages is
a fancy printed up manual, a pretty box, a bunch of disks, technical support
for a time, and the convienience of not having to download the ISOs, buy and
burn your own CDs, and print up the excellent free documentation available
on the net.

    There is a certain amount of trying to recoup some of the development
costs of giving away all of this stuff. The package that you have mentioned
is also not really aimed at the personal user, it is a professional package.
It does have a few more software packages, but the main thing you are paying
for is tech support.

    RedHat certainly are not leaching or trying to rip off the community by
any means, they make most of their money by selling Enterprise Servers to
run large corporations. The development they put back into the Open Source
community pays them back many times.

    My recommendatiom to you is that if you are looking at getting started
in Linux, RedHat is a good place to start, it is relatively newbie friendly.
As a beginner, you probably don't need RH9.0 Pro, just plain old ordinary
RH9.0 Standard would be fine. When you are comfortable with Linux and know
what you want to do, then look for a more tailored distribution. A quick
word on distributions, Debian, RedHat, Mandrake, Slackware, Suse, they are
all 98% the same under the bonnet - they are all Linux. The difference is
mainly the market they aim at, and the bells and whistles that come with
them. RedHat 9.0 Standard is more than enough for a beginner user. It comes
with a good desktop, a good office suite, is relatively easy to configure,
and the documentation is pretty good.

    On actually obtaining a copy of Linux to install, there are several
methods available to you. One - buy the Professional Pack you have already
mentioned with more than everything you need. Two - borrow someone elses
disks and just install it (legal in every way with Linux and you can copy
them too). Three - contact Netcraft in Adelaide or someone and get them to
burn you copies and pick them up from the monthly meeting. Four - go to your
local newsagent and buy the Standard RH9.0 for about $35 which comes with
disks and a simple manual to get you started (I would recommend this
option).

    I would also get hold of the Australian Personal Computer Linux
Pocketbook and Advanced Linux Pocketbook. You should be able to download
copies from the APC website - they are a great help for beginners. Another
great book is "A Practical Guide to Linux" by Mark G. Sobell, and also "The
Linux Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition" by Paul Sheer (which is
downloadable from the internet for free BTW).

    Anyhow, I hope this has helped, and good luck with your project.
        Cheers!
            Andrew.

Subject: please explain





Hello everyone,
Whilst still in the process of "migrating", there has been much much reading
and getting ready for the day to install the OS, eventualy. I want to do
install it right the first time and be aware of what else is around on the
"smorgasboard" of choices.
One of the postings shows places/shops which favours Linux/Open Scource etc,
and I am now confused.

A "packaged" deal with the following details sells the OS. Can someone
please explain to me, why this cost?
I thought the OS was "free", or are these the "free_loaders" taking
advantage of whatever there is to take advantage of ?
I will certainly not pay this amount if we are told Linux is free OS
software. ( understand there are CD costs etc)
With all due respect, I will make apologies if I cannot "see" something
here, but hey ! Can someome please explain to me, either on the post or a
personal reply will be ok, basicaly, why pay for this package at
$273.90-$249.95 ?

Thanks
