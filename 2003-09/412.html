&gt; Poor arguments there. You will have to do better than that.
&gt; 
&gt; We run mixed Win /Linux environment and both server their purpose
&gt; 
&gt; Stability : Contrary to the belief of some people here Windows 
&gt; Servers can be stable depending on what they are running.

I agree, I've got a few clients deployed with Windows 2000 servers (mainly due
to the fact they bought those $500 Microsoft packs, and insisted they use the
software).

They're fine if you set them up, then DON'T TOUCH THEM.  One problem I've had
with Windows machines is that occasionally you get clients that think they
don't need you, because "Wow, it looks just like my workstation, easy!" and
they get the impression they can administer it theirselves, and as a result,
they often stuff the server up completely - the Windows Server wizards are evil.

A few weeks ago one client was having issues with their Win2K server, which
has been running beautifully, and I found out that the guy's nephew "computer
genius" had told his uncle all about KaZaA and such, and the entire server was
covered with spyware, new IE toolbars - you name it, and many files on the
hard drive were corrupt - and the little shit had somehow killed the ASPI
layer in 2K, so the guy hadn't been doing his backups nightly onto CD.  He
lost a few weeks worth of work - wasn't happy :(

Which I guess is good to some people when you're charging by the hour, which
most Microsoft-guys are solely out to do (it seems, sigh), but I prefer to
have to have happy clients; most don't *care* how or what the server does,
just as long as it keeps on working.

And I've had no issues at all with Samba, minus one hard drive dying; but
everything was backed up the night before via rsync, so it only took a hour to
get the client back up again. :)

The only 
&gt; time our Win NT F&P server gets rebooted is after essential security 
&gt; patches. Linux also requires rebooting after Kernels get updated due 
&gt; to security issues. The only Windows servers I have ever had to 
&gt; administer that required rebooting weekly was an Exchange 5.5 Server 
&gt; and an old NT Comms server that had a dicky Eicon Routing card that 
&gt; used to lock up.
&gt; 
&gt; Keyboard/Mouse/Monitor : 2 of our Windows servers and none of our Linux
&gt; servers have KB/Mouse/Monitor. Administration of our Win Servers is done
&gt; with VNC.
&gt; 
&gt; Hardware : Any New Server is quite capable of running Win or Linux. 
&gt; We still have some production Win NT servers running on Pentium 75 
&gt; Servers so your argument falls down there also.
&gt; 
&gt; Backup : not much good backing up just your smb.conf file if it is a 
&gt; file and print server is it. Surely you need to back up the data 
&gt; also ?
&gt; 
&gt; I would certainly prefer using Linux/SAMBA servers for F&P as 
&gt; overall Linux provides a lot more flexibility, but where it falls 
&gt; down is extended attributes / permissions of files and folders and 
&gt; groups. This is really easy in Windows but can be a pain in Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; The second issue we have with not using Linux/SAMBA servers more is most
&gt; currently also act as BDCs. When SAMBA 3.0 finally comes out this point
&gt; should "hopefuly" be a non-issue.
&gt; 
&gt; I am happy to be corrected on any of these points..so feel free

&gt; &gt; Well, you've got a *n?x/BSD system and all its functionality.
&gt; 
&gt; Not to mention its stability and security :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; including a plain text file for configuration - no clickyclicky
&gt; &gt; interface which drives you crazy when you want to create more than 20
&gt; &gt; shares
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; configuration backup is easier - just backup the smb.conf and when your
&gt; &gt; server has crashed for what reason whatsoever your configuration can
&gt; &gt; easily be restored.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and you don't need a keyboard, mouse and monitor for the server after
&gt; &gt; you've installed it. just put it in your toilet ;)
