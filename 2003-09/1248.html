&gt; &gt; How is an SMTP callout different from mailfilter?
&gt; 
&gt; Different stage in the process. It stops the mail before it's accepted
&gt; for delivery to your mailbox. mailfilter examines what's made it into
&gt; your mailbox and deletes it before you download it to your own system.
&gt; The SMTP callout method is better but only works if you're running
&gt; your own internet mail server, which means that you have to have a
&gt; permanent (more or less) connection and your own DNS MX records. If
&gt; you're on dialup things like mailfilter are pretty much your only
&gt; option.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a school of thought which holds that rather than
&gt; blocking/rejecting spam, you should filter it into a spambox and
&gt; report it

That's a school of thought that doesn't care about bandwidth cost (both
$$ and utilisation) or CPU cost (ask an ISP what their malware filters
cost them in continual upgrades.)

&gt; convinced it's worthwhile; it seems that my spam distribution has
&gt; changed such that 

Yep. And it will keep on changing. That's why spam/virus filters should
be the *last* line of defence, not the first. The first line of defence
should be an application firewall that stops the mail ever being
received, at all. 

An SMTP callout is an application firewall. I'm not aware of any SA ISPs
that use them, which I find quite surprising.
