&gt;The slashdot replies to the verisign type hijack caper don't seem to give
&gt;many really good workarounds for the problem.
&gt;Does anyone have some bright ideas on how to mitigate the harm?
&gt;
&gt;The first thing I thought of was:
&gt;-	Use iptables to block input from 64.94.110.11.
&gt;
&gt;Then I thought that this just means that if I make a type, I'll
&gt;have to wait for 30 seconds for my browser to tell me that there is
&gt;no response.
&gt;
&gt;The second thing I thought of is:
&gt;-	Use iptables to reject (-j REJECT) _output_ to 64.94.110.11.
&gt;
&gt;This should give me an instant message saying that the server doesn't respond.
&gt;But this is still not ideal.
&gt;
&gt;The third thing I though of is:
&gt;-	Patch my local copy of BIND to interpret 64.94.110.11 as "not in DNS".
&gt;
&gt;That seems to do the right thing almost. But it's very untidy. Then I'll
&gt;have to re-patch this IP address into BIND every time they move the
&gt;number 64.94.110.11 to something else. And what's to stop them replacing
&gt;a fixed IP address with a rolling set of 10 or 20 IP addresses and selling
&gt;the locations in their table?
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure there are people on this list who must have stormbrained this already.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;ak.

Ehrm... Yell at them for the short-sighted idiots they are? I would 
laugh my a** off if this cost them their TLD licenses... They are after 
all hindering normal RFC behavior this way *and* may - inadvertedly or 
not, doesn't matter - be hijacking email that ios meant for others that 
would otherwise be returned as invalid domain email...

I think they did not quite think through all the consequences of this 
move, and this may cost them dearly from the side of the tech community, 
which AFAIK have always been the largest number of customers for 
domains... I know *I* would never purchase a domain name from them again 
after this stunt! And in the end such a boycot would be the best 
solution to prevent others from doing the same in the future...

(At least in Internet Exploder I can turn that search feature off, and 
Mozilla has the same possibility... In DNS there is no such option)

Just my € 0,02
