Hi Everyone,

Hmm... Normally controlled through a domain wide Group Policy..  However in
theory there would be no probs with using Policies on the local machines
using policy editor to establish permissions and desktop environments.

Also there was a kit from MS called the Zero Administration Kit which allow
very strict lockdowns using policies.  I know ther was a 9x / NT version -
perhaps there is a XP vers?

Here is the google search for Group Policy / System Policy Editor for XP:

<A HREF="http://www.google.com.au/search?q">http://www.google.com.au/search?q</A>=Policy+Editor+Windows+XP&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
&hl=en&meta=

Anyhow good luck and I am watching the thread with interest....

Thanks

Scott

Not really. It is a question of how do I set up a Linux server to
manage a Windows network.

I am using this situation as a learning experience as this is similar
to many other jobs where a Linux server manages a network of Windows
computers. I would hope that what I am learning from this might be of
interest to other LinuxSA users who may be exposed to similar
situations.

While it would be nice to become a Linux zealot we still have to live
in the real world where people believe that they must have Windows as
their OS. If we can provide an open source solution for the server then
we have had a small win. Maybe that small win can be turned into an
open source desktop solution in the future. We can hope can't we?

So, back to the question, with all the machines operating XP Pro and
all needing to run varying MS products, how do I manage these policies
from the e-Smith 6 server? How do I set up these policies on the XP
machines?

Cheers,  Ian
