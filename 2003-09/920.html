(This is an in progress concept, I am having trouble using the ports, 
but have not had trouble installing the system, keep that in mind before 
diving in...)

I. Mass production of .debs whilst sleeping

If you made your own distribution[1], wouldn't it be nice to be able 
mass produce .deb or .rpm files in a completely automated way? Well I am 
trying to figure out if that is possible.....

 From what I understand, apt-get can be used to download source files to 
build .debs of primary and dependent packages with this command:  

apt-get -b source packagename

For example, if I wanted to create a .deb called ports, I would run

apt-get -b source ports

Also, from what I understand, if you have source files, I believe that 
you would unzip the tarballs, and go into the package's main directory 
and run:

dpkg-build rfakeroot.

But where to find a server that has a bunch of source files on it? 
Didn't seem like there were any servers that had source repositories at 
the sites listed in my /etc/apt/sources.list.   Perhaps FreeBSD's ports 
system can provide an answer.  From what I understand, the FreeBSD ports 
system tends to use source code to build packages. To install Open 
Office using the ports in FreeBSD, I would:

cd /usr/ports/editors/Openoffice
make install clean

Also, from what I understand about the ports, is that Source Code for 
packages are and saved in /usr/ports/distfiles.  You could set up an FTP 
server with /usr/ports/distfiles as FTP root on an internal server or.....

.....you could install the ports system the Linux server that you use to 
make .deb packages.


Installing NetBSD's Packages System on Linux


NetBSD has a page on the pkgsrc system at <A HREF="http://www.pkgsrc.org/,">http://www.pkgsrc.org/,</A> but 
here is a summary of the process:

A. Install the pkgsrc application
B. Configure the behavior of the pkgsrc application
C. Download the files pkgsrc uses to build applications with


A. Install the pkgsrc application

1. Download pkgsrc from here: 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/bootstrap-pkgsrc.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/bootstrap-pkgsrc.tar.gz</A>
2. run shell command: gzip -dc bootstrap-pkgsrc.tar.gz | tar xvf -
3. run shell command: cd bootstrap-pkgsrc
4. run shell command: ./bootstrap
5. Edit your $PATH (Note, only tested in SuSE Linux 8.2)---&gt; Use a text 
editor to add this line to or edit the exisiting $PATH line in  .bashrc 
to read: PATH=/usr/pkg/bin:/usr/pkg/sbin


B. Configure the behavior of the pkgsrc application

1. Log in as root---&gt; run shell command: su----&gt;supply password
2. run shell command: cd bootstrap-pkgsrc
3. run shell command: cp mk.conf.example /etc/mk.conf
4. I kept the default settings, but you can edit as necessary

C. Download the files pkgsrc uses to build applications with

1. run shell command: ftp ftp.netbsd.org
2. supply user name: anonymous
3. supply password: anonymous
4. run shell command: get pub/NetBSD-current/tar-files/pkgsrc.tar.gz
5. run shell command: gzip -dc pkgsrc.tar.gz | tar xvf -
6. Log in as root---&gt; run shell command: su----&gt;supply password
7. mv /pkgsrc /usr/ports

Ok, we have installed the ports system in Linux, so if they work, we can 
build the deb packages in /usr/ports/distfiles.


*  Problems I have had so far with the ports:

Ok, lets try to build Hercules....

cd /usr/ports/emulators/hercules

I get a stop error saying that I am missing the /bin/unzip file. I run 
which unzip, it tells me /usr/bin/unzip, so I make a symbolic link by 
running this shell command:

ln -s /usr/bin/unzip /bin/unzip

The next stop error shows I am missing a marker. I edit the 
/usr/ports/emulators/hercules/makefile by merely adding a tab to the 
last line, and that error goes away.

My last stop error said that I was missing /share/examples/hercules...so I:

mkdir /share
mkdir /share/examples
mkdir /share/examples/hercules

The last stop error I had showed a permission denied error in 
/share/examples/hercules. That is where I had to stop.

Hope this is helpful and/or interesting
