&gt; I need more info/details on what papers will be presented
&gt; at the linux conf.  I'm trying to convince my company to
&gt; pay to send me and need something to show it's at least
&gt; vaguely related to work...
&gt;


Hi David,


The list of papers and speakers, and an initial conference programme, will
be made available hopefully next week - at worst the week following.

Right now, we've had over 120 paper and tutorial submissions, the Call for
Papers (CFP) panel have completed judging, and we're now contacting the
various authors to communicate acceptance/rejection.

So while I can't show you details yet, I can say that it's very likely
that both Linux and BSD kernels will feature; perl, python and php will be
there; Gnome, KDE and Xfree86 will shine; MySQL and PostgreSQL will
relate; and there will also be papers on compilers, libraries, MTAs,
enterprise management, advocacy, education, case studies, and general
networking.

We'll be offering 3 keynotes, 6 miniconfs, LPI exams, 8 tutorials, 40
papers, FIXITs (BOFs with a purpose), Keysigning, free Linux Australia
membership, a Question and Answer session, a Linux Australian AGM, a
"Works in Progress" session, a Professional Networking Session, and a
formal sit down conference dinner - over a 6 day period.

Registrations have been open for 23 days and we're at about 20% of our
target conference size.  We have representation from 8 countries.

Is that enough to convince you to come, and your employer to pay? :-)


[Disclaimer: what is said above has been said in good faith -
substitutions in conference programme may still occur (but none are known
of at this time).  This information is provided for illustrative purposes
only.]
