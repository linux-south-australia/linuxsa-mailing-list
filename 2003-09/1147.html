&gt; &gt; Exactly.  It's about more than just websites.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that.  I realise why people, including myself, are hostile to
&gt; the'service', but my question, which was really directed at David
&gt; Lloyd, was what is it about their web terms and conditions that he has
&gt; a problem with.  I surely hope that they get shut down, but I don't
&gt; think saying,"I don't agree with your web T&C yet I can't avoid using
&gt; it," will get far because you can avoid using their SiteFinder.  You
&gt; just don't use it.
&gt; 


&gt; Obviously there are a whole raft of other issues, such as them
&gt; hijacking private and confidential email, but that's nothing to do
&gt; with their SiteFinder T&C, is it?  Before making a public fuss, I
&gt; think it's a good idea to ensure that what you plan to say actually
&gt; makes sense, and hence my question was, by way of Devil's Advocacy,
&gt; intended to give him a chance to test his complaint.
&gt; 
&gt; So how about it, David: What is it about their SiteFinder service that
&gt; makes you unable to just not use it?
&gt; 
David Newall,

If I may playing devil's advocate for a moment.

I will not use that service but you mistype a domain name into your
browser and get Versign's sitefinder... Despite that fact that
you don't intend to using it. Hence you have been
coerced/seconded/drafted into accepting Sitefinder T&C despite not
agreeing to it.

No matter how you work it you *can not* opt out, no matter how you
state the argument.  Domain name typos happen and when they do you are
"required" to accept the T&C agreement.

Explain a way that the end user can Opt out/recline  or reject the
Sitefinder service, without using a technical mean (such as iptable/
ipfilter/ipfw/you_name_it firewall rules, dns hacks, etc). That could
be an interesting challenge. :-)
