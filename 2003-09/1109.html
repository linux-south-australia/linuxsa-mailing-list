&gt; Let's say I purchase a Lindows enabled hard drive. And I decide I want it
&gt; to authenticate my customised LDAP with a totally nonstard schema. Yeah,
&gt; right.

I'd put it to you that this isn't exactly the target market.

&gt; Lindows will come out to Australia and help me?

Would Microsoft?  Would Sun?  No, most likely it'd be a local reseller 
and/or consulting company who would.  Or you'd do it via email just like 
most products.

&gt; But a local supplier might.

Sure - but to do wierd stuff like that you'd be paying for consulting time 
anyway and thus would purchase that capability locally.  This is often very 
separate to purchasing the kit/sw in the first place.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd prefer to buy from a local supplier...

...

&gt; However I am providing reasonable advice.

I disagree you seem to have found a very narrow, spurious example.  Which 
seems to damn a product when really it's no different to purchasing 
anything in Oz.

&gt; "You work for someone with a competing product set [don't you]?"
&gt; 
&gt; I just happen to believe that Lindows isn't necessarily the best solution
&gt; in all cases. 

Derr.  

&gt; I do have technical reasons to believe this; I'm not a sales person and
&gt; I'm not a marketing person.

You work for Microbits, you are developing a series of machines to provide a 
desktop environment and are claiming that you'd prefer to buy from a local 
supplier, without stating your conflicting interest.  

There's a certain quote "Everyone's a sales person".  This is very true.  
Even if you don't feel it is.  You've posted Microbits pricing here before 
(USB Drives) which makes you a marketing/salesperson just like everyone 
else.  


&gt; You're arguing ad hominem (to the person) here. I tender that your
&gt; concerns are invalid and that you have decided to associate me with a
&gt; competitor to Lindows simply because you have no better (or more valid)
&gt; claim that what I am saying is not true.

Crap.  You've said nothing useful, made claims about a competitor with a 
spurious example (hence my "eh?" as I couldn't figure out why this was 
different to pretty much any product).

I would have prefered you to state your bias upfront and compared the 
products and approaches in an upfront and honest way.  But making spurious 
claims like you have smacks of the FUD.
