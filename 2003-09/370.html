I will post the letter in full for those who wish to just read it asap -
after all, Im sure its Open Source;)
(And yes, ive commented yet again at Newsforge. Its habit forming I
suspect).


Dear Darl, 

Thank you so much for your letter. 

We are happy that you agree that customers need to know that Open Source
is legal and stable, and we heartily agree with that sentence of your
letter. The others don't seem to make as much sense, but we find the
dialogue refreshing.

However, we have to sadly decline taking business model advice from a
company that seems to have squandered all its money (that it made off a
Linux IPO, I might add, since there's a nice bit of irony there), and
now seems to play the U.S. legal system as a lottery. We in the Open
Source group continue to believe in technology as a way of driving
customer interest and demand. 

Also, we find your references to a negotiating table somewhat confusing,
since there doesn't seem to be anything to negotiate about. SCO has yet
to show any infringing IP in the Open Source domain, but we wait with
bated breath for when you will actually care to inform us about what you
are blathering about. 

All of our source code is out in the open, and we welcome you to point
to any particular piece you might disagree with. 

Until then, please accept our gratitude for your submission, 

Yours truly, 

Linus Torvalds
