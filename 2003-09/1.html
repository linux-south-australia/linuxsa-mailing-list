1. A follow up on my earlier posts:

I want to thank Alex Wilkinson for helping me with these two items:

&gt;&gt;:It didn't work for me. It is set up to install Netscape 7.02 and it will
&gt;&gt;	:leave a message that its forbidden.
&gt;&gt;	:Same thing, Open Office will not download, and ymessenger will install
&gt;&gt;	:but has an error.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Update your ports tree:
&gt;
&gt;shell&gt; grep -i portver /usr/ports/www/netscape7/Makefile
&gt;PORTVERSION?=   7.1
&gt;
&gt;I tried and it started building fine.


I just want to verify that it worked fine for me as well, after I fixed my supfile and reran cvsup.

Thanks again to Alex for this help:


&gt;:*default release=cvs tag=RELENG_4
&gt;
&gt;Aren't you tracking the head of the tree ? ie -CURRENT ? If so, you are using the wrong tag.
&gt;


I looked up the tag for current, and it appears that it is:


:*default release=cvs tag=.

2. New Stuff:


A. Open Office

The open Office port used to sleep and then eventually return an error 
on my desk, but that was fixed after I ran cvsup. However, the port 
still has one problem, and I broke my system trying to work around it.

After I ran cvsup, the port sucessfully downloaded Open Office. However, 
it seems that the port has a very large laundry list of dependencies, 
long enough to keep the port running for over two hours, on a broadband 
connection.  At the end of the port, there was an error message that read:

&gt; Checking if devel/gettext already installed
&gt; ===&gt;   An older version of devel/gettext is already installed 
&gt; (gettext-0.11.5_1)
&gt;       You may wish to ``make deinstall'' and install this port again
&gt;       by ``make reinstall'' to upgrade it properly.
&gt;       If you really wish to overwrite the old port of devel/gettext
&gt;       without deleting it first, set the variable "FORCE_PKG_REGISTER"
&gt;       in your environment or the "make install" command line.
&gt; *** Error code 1

Last time I used pkg_delete to get rid of gettext, and that was the kiss 
of death.  When I tried to reinstall gettext or Open Office, I fell into 
an endless loop, the same compilation messages came up over and over 
again, and after about two hours of waiting, I hit ctrl-c and went on to 
other things. After I rebooted ,was unable to log into KDE 3.1 after 
that, and Mutt would not start, with an error showing that elf could not 
find libslang.  Kdeinit would not start, and DCOP was broken.


B. pkg_info

Before I formatted the parttion for a reinstall, I obtained a list of 
all of the applications installed in FreeBSD 5.1 Current by running the 
pkg_info command at the console, redirecting the output to a text file 
called packages.txt. I opened up LyX and imported the file so I could 
print the list.

pkg_info &gt; packages.txt

Between having that list and my trusty floppy with configgies, I was 
able to completely restore my system to its previous state in two hours.


C.  The Gettext problem:

I found that LyX would not install, as it had the same gettext error as 
open Office. I was at stalemeate and had to do something. So I bit the 
bullet again and upgraded gettext this way:

localhost# make FORCE_PKG_REGISTER=yes install clean

Note that the message that suggests that I "set the variable 
'FORCE_PKG_REGISTER'" does not provide enough information to help the 
new user.  I had to guess that "make FORCE_PKG_REGISTER=yes install 
clean" was the proper command to use. After running that command, the 
gettext port seemed to work, and I was able to continue running the Open 
Office port.  It seems to be carrying on far too long however.


D. Konqueror file permission weirdness.

This is really odd.  I can access all of my Fat formatted partitions or 
disks, but when I use Konqueror to enter the directories inside the 
mount point by clicking on them, I get an error that reads:

"You do not have enough permissions to read <A HREF="file:/storage/Network">file:/storage/Network</A> 
Operating Systems"

However, if I merely right click and say open in new Window, it opens as 
normal and without a problem.


E. Finding out what drivers are loaded in FreeBSD

To do this, I just opened up the console ant typed:

kldstat

Here is what I have now: I have IPX compiled into the kernel.

&gt; localhost# kldstat
&gt; Id Refs Address    Size     Name
&gt;  1   10 0xc0100000 622f74   kernel
&gt;  2    1 0xc0723000 4c1d0    acpi.ko
&gt;  3    1 0xc2871000 18000    linux.ko
&gt;  4    1 0xc28ed000 1f000    smbfs.ko
&gt;  5    2 0xc2918000 3000     libiconv.ko
&gt;  6    2 0xc2914000 3000     libmchain.ko



F.  LyX

The best way to install LyX is to use the ports system and run this command:

make WITH_QT=yes WITH_ISPELL=yes install clean


3. I have some new ports:

I have made no code changes to any of the following applications, but 
was able to get these installed in FreeBSD 5.1-Current. I don't know if 
that means I have a port or not, but it seems like I do, so I should 
mention them.

A. Antiword:

Good program, I tested it and it was able to extract the text from a 
MSword document without a problem. Here is what I did to get it to work 
in FreeBSD 5.1- Current:

I downloaded it from  
<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/redir/antiword/286/url_tgz/antiword-0.33.tar.gz">http://freshmeat.net/redir/antiword/286/url_tgz/antiword-0.33.tar.gz</A>

Then opened up the console and uncompressed the <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

gzip -dc antiword-0.33.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Wen into the directory so I could compile it:

cd antiword-0.33

Compiled the progam without incident:

make
make install

&gt; localhost# antiword
&gt;         Name: antiword
&gt;         Purpose: Display MS-Word files
&gt;         Author: (C) 1998-2002 Adri van Os
&gt;         Version: 0.33  (05 Jul 2002)
&gt;         Status: GNU General Public License
&gt;         Usage: antiword [switches] wordfile1 [wordfile2 ...]
&gt;         Switches: [-t|-p papersize][-m mapping][-w #][-i #][-Ls]
&gt;                 -t text output (default)
&gt;                 -p &lt;paper size name&gt; PostScript output
&gt;                    like: a4, letter or legal
&gt;                 -m &lt;mapping&gt; character mapping file
&gt;                 -w &lt;width&gt; in characters of text output
&gt;                 -i &lt;level&gt; image level (PostScript only)
&gt;                 -L use landscape mode (PostScript only)
&gt;                 -s Show hidden (by Word) text


B. Real One Player:

Obtain the Real One Player as I describe in this post:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2002-07/725.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2002-07/725.html</A>

But to install the program without error, run these commands:

mkdir ~/.kde/share/mimelnk
mkdir ~/.kde/share/mimelnk/application
mkdir ~/.kde/share/mimelnk/audio
mkdir ~/.kde/share/mimelnk/image
mkdir ~/.kde/share/mimelnk/text
mkdir ~/.kde/share/mimelnk/video

It works this way with the same error on sound found with the Real 
Player 8 port:

For the ports:

The download can be automated with:
lynx scopes.real.com/real/player/unix/unix.html


Hope this helps,

James Leone
