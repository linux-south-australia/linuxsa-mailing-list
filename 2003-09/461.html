&gt; My gut feeling is that most users (ie the other 99% of the people on the
&gt; network) can't cope with ACLs well. They still think Office is part of
&gt; the operating system and explaining how to right click and change
&gt; security on a file is inviting disaster.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that assigning a group for each department and an accompanying
&gt; samba share is very maintainable.

I don't remember any of my users right clicking on files and changing their
permissions.  That was my job.  Sure they can do what they like in their
own home directory, but when it came to the network-wide file system, that
was my job.

ACLs were not a nightmare.  Once they were set up they did not require any
changing unless I added a new file area.  Why not?  Because I thought about
my file system structure and designed it logically and heirachically.

The file server I set up had many read-only areas, which were available to
certain users only.  Let's think about Unix permissions versus ACLs.

Unix permissions:

The group 'marketing' has access to the /marketing directory with the
following permissions:

drw-r-----	root  marketing			marketing/

The people in the 'marketing' group have read access to marketing.  Our
accounts department need read access to the marketing directory, but nobody
else should be able to access the directory.  How do we allow people to
modify the files in marketing?  Log them in as root.  No, wait!  I have a
better idea!  Assign an ACL:

ACLs:

marketing/
	-&gt; marketing  : rw
	-&gt; accounts   : r
	-&gt; ??????     : -

What simple logic.

&gt; ACLs are really annoying for people accustomed to scripting support of
&gt; their file systems.

Why?  ACLs on the command line are just as flexible to use as Unix
permissions.
