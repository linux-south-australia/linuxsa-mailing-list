&gt; Your response seems to indicate that CPU speed is the limiting factor in

Not at 1Gbps and above.

The host IP implementation and the design of TCP/IP
itself are the new constraints.

To use a horrid management phrase, making the host CPU
do six times less work to transfer the same amount of
data is "low-hanging fruit".  See

  <A HREF="http://www.aarnet.edu.au/engineering/networkdesign/mtu/">http://www.aarnet.edu.au/engineering/networkdesign/mtu/</A>

&gt; CPU time per packet must be something like a constant K
&gt; plus some small linear factor for the packet length.

Yep, it's a linear win.  We really want a MTU of 64KB
(ie, maximum for IPv4).  But in the real world, the
biggest widely deployable MTU is 9000 bytes.  Even that
has real-world problems (eg, can't run AppleTalk and
IPX in the same subnet).

On the plus side, that 6x increase in MTU puts us beyond
the 1Gbps sweet spot.

Getting over the next sweet spot, 10Gbps, isn't going to
be nearly as easy, probably requiring a rip-and-replace
of a fair whack of TCP, not to mention a fair whack of
people's multi-million dollar campus networks.

&gt; If you increase file transfer packet size, then you necessarily increase
&gt; jitter for RTP. 

Yeah, but the proposal is 9000 byte MTUs for 1Gbps links.
So jitter cannot be worse than for 1500 bytes MTUs at
10/100Mbps.

Again, the major source of jitter is moving from the
network to the hosts.  Routers can forward 10Gbps
today using ASICs, the jitter being dominated by the
size of the previously-sent packet.  Hosts do stupid
things like disk I/O, the PCI bus occupancy for disk
access leading to jitter for packets on their way
to/from the network interface.


Alan, we think about the stuff we do.  Long and hard.
After all, we regularly need to justify it to rooms of
computer scientists :-)
