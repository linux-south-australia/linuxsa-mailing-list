&gt; We Have Met the Enemy, and He is Us

Abstracts:

&gt; [1] So what's the solution? How about adopting a single word-command – 
&gt; I suggest "install" to compile and set-up a package. This could be 
&gt; done through a Bash script.
&gt;
&gt; [2] Then the installation routine should launch a graphical 
&gt; configuration utility that will help you connect all the parts 
&gt; necessary to make the thing work.
&gt;
&gt; Finally, this installer will tell you where it put the damned 
&gt; executables. Some apps put the bits in /usr/local/. Others put them 
&gt; elsewhere. But there's little consistency on this point, and dammit, 
&gt; there needs to be a lot more. Windows may be the devil, but at least 
&gt; you can easily figure out where an application installs itself.
&gt;
&gt; Lindows Gets It Right: Companies like Lindows have had some success 
&gt; leveraging Debian's apt-get to address these problems. Many Linux pros 
&gt; scoff at Lindows, calling it "Linux for the AOL set," but the company 
&gt; is actually making some headway.
&gt;
&gt; Still, more work still needs to be done. It begins with a fairly 
&gt; simple definition: an application is NOT installed unless it works as 
&gt; advertised. And the installer should ensure that that all the 
&gt; dependent modules are installed and actually configured correctly. The 
&gt; whole thing should just work after the installation is done.
&gt;
...

&gt; We need 'Finishers'
&gt;
&gt; [3] The Linux community -- package developers, distribution makers and 
&gt; driver writers --need to understand that that theirs is a symbiotic 
&gt; relationship. They need each other to be successful.

...

&gt; Not Dumbed Down, But Smartened Up: I'm not proposing that we dumb down 
&gt; Linux. I'm not proposing that we bury code behind some curtain that no 
&gt; one can see. I'm just asking that Linux application developers think 
&gt; their projects through from A to Z, with Z representing a polished 
&gt; product that installs successfully with minimal fuss.
&gt;
...

&gt; We're part-way there, but like many Linux packages themselves, the 
&gt; most sweat-equity goes into getting that last 10% right. If developers 
&gt; don't feel compelled to finish their applications, then we need a new 
&gt; group of developers – I'll call them "finishers" – to get the job 
&gt; done. [4]
&gt;
&gt; I enjoy a good puzzle as much as the next guy, but that's what a 
&gt; Rubik's Cube is for (they're making a comeback, you know). My Rubik's 
&gt; Cube should be puzzling. My Linux application installation should just 
&gt; work.
&gt;

Thoughts ?

Some of mine are:

[1] That's as silly as saying everyone should eat the same meal at 
breakfast, lunch and dinner...

[2] I can hear it now...from the other room...

[3] I try to test and document, I like that stuff...

[4] Who's role should this be ? I think the users have an obligation to 
help create documentation, to honor the work of the programmers.
