&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi All   Am looking for some input on these OS, Redhat / SuSE, would 
&gt;&gt;&gt;like to find out what people think about it and what is the most 
&gt;&gt;&gt;robust,  installation/configuration  ect..ect...   Cheers   Trevor
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well personally I prefer SuSE over RedHat. But it's really just personal 
&gt;&gt;opinion. Either distrobution will be fairly stable, both have graphical 
&gt;&gt;and easy to follow installers (although if you do a graphical install 
&gt;&gt;with RedHat, and don't have a mouse, don't expect to finish it).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Way back around Redhat 5.2, I changed over to SuSE, and at that time it
&gt;was arguably significantly better than Redhat. Since SuSE 6.2, I have
&gt;noticed accelerating deterioration of SuSE, even though I've stuck with it.
&gt;It's installation scripts get worse and worse - less functional, less
&gt;comprehensible, less reliable etc. etc.
&gt;  
&gt;
I am just curious....if you have time...could you go into specifics?  
Seems ok to me, but I probably "know no better"  :-)

&gt;But at times when an exploit need to be patched against, that's where you
&gt;lose with SuSE. They have been very, very slow to release RPMs in the 
&gt;last couple of years. Emergency security fixes have to be done by
&gt;downloading source and rebuilding if you use SuSE. Here's their current list
&gt;of advisories:
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/en/private/support/security/index.html">http://www.suse.de/en/private/support/security/index.html</A>
&gt;  
&gt;
On the 8.2 release, I have had patches available through SuSE watcher, 
seems like there are a good amount of them, and enough to apply about 
once a week.

But I don't watch these things close enough to know how late the patches 
are.....

...if you have time....

Thanks for the info, time to do an update here.   :-)
