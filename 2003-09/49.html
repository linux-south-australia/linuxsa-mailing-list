Corran,

&gt; I am looking at implementing a new mail server using Postfix under
&gt; FreeBSD very soon. I need to know what people would recommend for the
&gt; hardware specs of this server. We are looking at about...120
&gt; users/mailboxes running on this server, in the future implementing
&gt; content checking with MimeDefang and we will be running SAMBA for web
&gt; serving (only for intranet though).
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, that gives you some idea on the workload of this server. Could
&gt; someone please give some me ideas on hardware configurations to suit our
&gt; needs.

to give you an idea, you will prolly need about 2GB of disk space per person.
we run 60 users and our celeron 600 copes ok. 
it has 128MB ram and an IDE disk. 

it also runs a majordomo list, IMAP and an awful[1] webmail base thingy on apache

if i had the cash right now, i would spring for another disk and stripe,
but on the machine its on the performance still would suck quite a lot.

i put together a spec for a new server to do exactly what you have in mind;
 - dual 2.4G P4 on an intel server mainboard
 - intel SATA IDE RAID controller w/64MB cache
 - 2 GB RAM
 - 4 x 120GB SATA IDE
 - 2 x 1Gb NICs
which came to about AU$5-6K, the idea that we would get 3-5 years out of it
for 75-100 users.

but you could just run a 1GHz PIII with 1GB RAM and however much disk space you
need, striped across a bunch of IDE disks[2] and a good 100Mb NIC[3] and run
cyrus and qmail[4] =) but i plan to run exim and cyrus or uw-imap this time.
but as you mentioned postfix, there is good courier and LDAP/PAM integration so ...

cheers,

Kim

[1] this will change soon.
[2] with software RAID on .*BSD or .* Linux
[3] go the intel eepro100's, they have solid drivers on .*BSD and Linux =)
[4] seemed to be a good combination at the time...
