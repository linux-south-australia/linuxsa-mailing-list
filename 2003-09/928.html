&gt; Pity that Bell's own anti-trust suit didn't permit them to commercialise
&gt; Unix.  A marriage of Bell (Unix) and IBM (PC) would have made the current
&gt; computer climate much more interesting than it otherwise has been.

its a shame that IBM did never really have the balls to Push AIX into OS/2
and push OS/2 as hard as MS pushed WIndows...

now with OS/2 being a very strong server platform, even Linux would
have a hard time in the market place if IBM was really serious...

its a shame to see OS/2 die the way it has. MS has a lot to answer for
in that arena and forcing IBM to develop it for the 286 when MS was 
busy pushing Windows 386 Executive on the market kinda screwed IBMs
chance of being taken seriously... at least in the '80s. however,
in the '90s, it was a different matter. but IBM pulled development
on OS/2 because it was bad for NT !?!?! part of the reason
appeared to be because it was hurting their PC desktop + NT sales...
strange world this. it would be a very different one if IBM dropped
NT and pushed OS/2 ... more diverse and prolly far more competitive.

cheers,

Kim
