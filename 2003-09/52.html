&gt; reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally necessary to use a Java engine for the interface, even
&gt; if Java is supposedly platform-independent ?

I think BankSA's java application was born out of their original stand
alone .exe style program they used to make you download and run under
Windows, in order to access internet banking.  

I know it sounds like a crap idea now, but BankSA were one of the first
banks I know of to offer internet banking of any description (back in
1998) and I think their custom app was to provide a level of security
that the browsers could not, at the time.  However I agree that the Java
app is now a little over the top and it must give their support team
headaches!

I have another account with Australian Central Credit Union.  Their
internet banking system is very simply and straightforward with no
requirement for Java.  However it does lack a lot of the functionality
of the BankSA system.

Cheers,
Graham
