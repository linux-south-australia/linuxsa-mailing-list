&gt;  &gt; I must admit that I'm confused what you will say.  I think it's about
&gt;  &gt; your refusal to agree to their terms and conditions, at least that's
&gt;  &gt; what it was about when you first brought this up here.  I just can't
&gt;  &gt; see what the problem is.  If you type a missing .com or .net address
&gt;  &gt; then VeriSign's SiteFinder will appear.  If you don't accept their
&gt;  &gt; terms and conditions then you don't click any of the links, or use the
&gt;  &gt; search button.  Where's the problem? 
&gt; 
&gt; Email correspondents who mistype your address will end up accidentally
&gt; sending private, personal, confidential communications intended solely
&gt; for your eyes into Verisign's mail server.
&gt; 
&gt; Verisign has a Privacy Policy attached to their Terms of Use which,
&gt; with your consent, authorizes the collection and use of any personal
&gt; information they collect.
&gt; 
&gt; If you don't consent to that privacy policy, the Terms of Use specify
&gt; that your "Sole Remedy" is to cease using SiteFinder.
&gt; 
&gt; Given that the manner in which you have "used" SiteFinder in that
&gt; situation is by means of some third party misaddressing your personal
&gt; communications, the only way you can cease to use SiteFinder is by
&gt; having Verisign withdraw the, uh, "service".
&gt; 
&gt; My belief is that what Verisign have done is illegal in Australia.  They're
&gt; a corporation who have forced an opt-out privacy policy on Australian
&gt; citizens.  Opt-out privacy policies have been illegal in Australia since
&gt; December 2001 when the latest amendments to the Privacy Act came into effect.
&gt; 
&gt; Through their Verisign Limited Australian subsidiary, they carry out their
&gt; business in Australia, under Australian jurisdiction, according to Australian 
&gt; law.  Through their Australian subsidiary they should be called to account for
&gt; those actions;  Or they should arrange to have SiteFinder turned into an opt-
&gt; in service in Australian territory.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a similar case to David's weaving its way through a formal
&gt; investigation by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.  If the case comes
&gt; out the way I intend it to come out, one of two things will happen:
&gt; 
&gt;   - Verisign will withdraw the service;  or
&gt; 
&gt;   - The Privacy Commissioner will launch action on my behalf in Federal
&gt;     Court against Verisign Limited.  If that action is successful, Verisign
&gt;     will either withdraw the service, pay debilitating fines, shut down their
&gt;     Australian subsidiary, or find themselves in contempt of court -- Until
&gt;     they withdraw the service.
&gt; 
&gt; Either way, I don't intend to let them get away with offering me a 
&gt; fraudulent privacy policy.  If they tell me that my "Sole Remedy" is to
&gt; cease using their "service", I expect them to provide a way in which I 
&gt; can cease using it!
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; (I mean, aside that you don't want
&gt;  &gt; their page displayed, but that's surely a separate issue.)
&gt; 
&gt; You've just made the mistake that Verisign wants you to make:  You've 
&gt; confused what they've done with the Web.
&gt; 
&gt; Their actions have affected far, far more than the web.  Saying that 
&gt; this is about what web pages you see when you mistype a URL is unduly 
&gt; simplifying the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; They've broken a *LOT* of stuff.  They're in breach of their contract with
&gt; ICANN.  They're receiving unauthorized private communications from countless
&gt; millions of people across the globe.  They're anticompetitively leveraging
&gt; their monopoly to cut the legs out from under other organizations who have
&gt; made successful businesses out of providing similar services to their own.
&gt; They're violating established standards by cybersquatting on IETF's reserved
&gt; domain names.  They need to be smacked down.
&gt; 
&gt; And I'm playing my part to make it happen.

On behalf of atleast me and probably lots of internet users, I would
like to thank you very much for doing this. Please let me know if you
could do with some extra research or similar.

Congratulations on being pro-active and making a stand.
