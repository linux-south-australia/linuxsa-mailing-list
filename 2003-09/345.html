Thanks very much for your help. Looks like GNU hello is a good place to
start.

I am still considering my options. Gdbserver as a remote debugger also looks
promising. I found a nice link for this at
<A HREF="http://www.kegel.com/linux/gdbserver.html">http://www.kegel.com/linux/gdbserver.html</A> . One issue I have come across is
the library version differences between the dev system and the embedded
system. Looks like I have to pull them out of the distribution somehow.

Does ldd show the entire dependency tree, or only the first level, i.e. if a
library is shown using ldd, does this in turn depend on another library
which is not shown?

Thanks again
Patrick

If you want the flexibility to install on a bare bones box without rpm, you 
will need to compile these packages yourself. Also, compiling from source 
allows you to specify the target directory. Note that compiling gcc and gdb 
is fairly hairy, you may want to practice with a simpler program first such 
as "GNU Hello", which is a multilingual "hello, world!" program that uses
the 
GNU autotools (tools that allow software to be built on multiple flavours of

Unix/Linux). In general the procedure goes like this:

tar -xzvf someprogram-0.1.tar.gz
cd someprogram-0.1
./configure
make
make install

you can pass a whole heap of options to the configure script to change
things, 
this is package independent but all packages have the same base options. To 
see these options do

./configure --help

before the ./configure stage above. One of the common options is specifying
a 
prefix directory, i.e.:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local

if you were compiling gcc, the gcc binary would end up in /usr/local/bin
after 
the "make install" stage. My friend once compiled gcc up for an embedded 
system (ARM SoC board), it took him 2 weeks to work it out :) But from what 
he said, you need to compile gcc twice. Once with the compiler you already 
have, and then once again with itself. However, he was building a cross 
compiler for the ARM... is that what you want to do? What is the host CPU on

the embedded device? 

If you are building a cross compiler you need to pass a bunch of options to 
./configure in order to build gcc for the desired architecture you want the 
resultant gcc to be able to build for. The first time you build gcc, you
will 
need to build it for a desired arch of x86. Then recompile gcc with the 
recently compiled gcc. Then recompile gcc as a cross compiler for the target

arch. If you intend to actually install gcc onto the embedded box (I'm 
assuming you have a non-x86 CPU on this box at this point), then you will of

course need to use the newly built cross compiler to compile gcc for the 
embedded system.

I'm not sure, but I think the reason for building gcc with itself is because

redhat's version of gcc is non-standard and may introduce errors. So I guess

building gcc with itself makes a "pure" compiler.

Note that I haven't actually built gcc myself, I am relaying what my friend 
did. I'm sure other people on this list will correct any mistakes I made.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; Please excuse a newbie. I have to install gdb and gcc on an embedded 
&gt; PC running a bare bones version of Red Hat 7.3. It does not have rpm, 
&gt; so I don't know how to proceed. I have another box that is running 
&gt; RH8.0.
&gt;
&gt; I have tried first installing rpm by downloading 
&gt; rpm-build-4.0.4-7x.18.i386.rpm (as well as gcc and gdb) onto the RH8.0 
&gt; box
&gt;
&gt; When I try
&gt; rpm -i rpm*.rpm, I get an error
&gt; "Failed Dependencies:
&gt; 	rpm = 4.0.4 is needed by...
&gt; 	librpm-4.0.4.so is needed by..
&gt;
&gt; The last time I used Linux was slackware in 1997, so my knowledge is 
&gt; VERY rusty and out of date.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas on how I can get these packages to run on the embedded 
&gt; version? Is there any way of specifying a different install directory, 
&gt; so I could run say off a USB flash drive?
&gt;
&gt; Any pointers would be appreciated
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Patrick
