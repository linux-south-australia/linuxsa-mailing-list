&gt;&gt; because I felt your stance was misled?
&gt;
&gt; Romana, like you, missed the point, which was not that IBM stole from
&gt; SCO, but that the open source community needs to be careful about
&gt; how it obtains its works.  Even quite innocent actions can be wrong.
&gt; For example, at the AUUG conference SCO showed an email from one IBM
&gt; engineer to another explaining, very briefly, how he had solved a problem
&gt; in AIX. 

A number of people were concerned about this.  I don't know why.
First, it has nothing to do with SCO, and secondly the content was a
brief summary of basic SMP principles, something that I knew in my
very first job, a little over 30 years ago, and which is described in
much more detail in books such as Schimmel and Vahalia.

&gt; SCO claim that IBM's UNIX contract assigns all derivative works back
&gt; to SCO, and that therefore that idea is owned by SCO.

They claim lots of unsubstantiated things.  If you look at the IBM
countersuit, you'll see the voice of reason.

&gt; The point is not that IBM's UNIX derivations belong to SCO, rather
&gt; that one IBM engineer, having had access to AIX source (which
&gt; undeniably is a UNIX derivative) gave a hint, in all good faith and
&gt; probably in ignorance of the implication, to someone working on
&gt; Linux.  It's could be that easy to violate SCO's rights.

No, this is a red herring.  It shows SCOs (and apparently your)
misunderstanding of the material.  If SCO claims that they invented
the computer, do all hardware vendors have to get worried?
