&gt;RH 7.2/3 had a couple of minor problems at setup time.  You definitely

&gt;problem whereby the initrd file created in the /boot filesystem does
&gt;*not* include the installed RAID driver module - so the system won't
&gt;boot up.  It is a known bug and there are various convoluted workarounds
&gt;available, but my simple workaround was to make a boot disk during Linux
&gt;install and copy the initrd from the boot disk to /boot.  Worked a
&gt;treat.

There are plenty of known bugs in the Intel Linux support .. my 
favourite is the motherboard that requires an updated kernel for the 
onboard RAID driver to work (model SRCZCR), yet the motherboard 
management software for the same software requires the default kernel 
[1]. Incompatability between components from different vendors is one 
thing, but features made mutually exclusive by driver issues on the same 
motherboard are a bit much.

Contacting Intel support about this issue invariably results in someone 
telling you to visit the web site, or reading from the web site, and 
telling you to check back later.

Without the motherboard management software, I can't control the blue 
identity LED's on the chassis from remote!

[1] Checking the web site, it looks like there is newer software for 
this now, maybe it can work..
