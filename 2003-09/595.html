Good thanks.
The point you made on a choice, if it's open, then everyone gets a crack at
improvements, or it stay' the way it is.

Subject: Re: my next question


&gt; This is a complicated question. You can write closed source software for
&gt; Linux as long as it doesn't include code or link to code that precludes
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt; For instance you can include BSD licensed code, but you can't include
&gt; GPL licensed code. You can link in LPGL libraries but not GPL ones.
&gt;
&gt; If all the code is written from scratch and does not link in anyone
&gt; elses libraries you can closed source, no problems.
&gt;
&gt; I would be very careful about creating closed source for Linux. You have
&gt; to offer significant value for people to choose closed source over open
&gt; source.
&gt;
&gt; Open source software really is about providing the source when
&gt; distributing. If you are developing the program for inhouse use only,
&gt; then you can keep the source closed and use open source components.
&gt; However then you don't get the benefit of having a development community
&gt; helping you.
&gt;
&gt; Be careful about developing the next big idea in software. One of the
&gt; advantages of open source is that somebody has probably already done it
&gt; or something close. You may be better off building on their work if you
&gt; are happy to leave the source open.
&gt;
&gt; BTW, the scheduled bell ringing can be done by cron and ntp will get the
&gt; exact time for you.

&gt; &gt; My next question is probably a "walk the fine line" type of question.
&gt; &gt; Let's say, hypotheticaly, I now have the OS installed, I am on the net,
&gt; &gt; I can do my bookeeping and get on with work from home.
&gt; &gt; The next thing is, specific programs, to do specific tasks and run under
&gt; &gt; a Linux OS.
&gt; &gt; For example, let's say I need to know the exact time, every hour. So I
&gt; &gt; contract a programer, show him/her my reason and what it's suppose to
&gt; &gt; do, then he/she writes a program and every hour on the hour and it
&gt; &gt; checks the time for me, then rings a bell.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If in principle this was to be developed because I have reason to use it
&gt; &gt; as part of my overall operations, then is that "tell the time" program
&gt; &gt; an open scource ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The answer to this question may seem trivial to some, but I have a
reason.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers
