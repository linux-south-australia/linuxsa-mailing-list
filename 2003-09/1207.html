To find out more about the product I am describing, go here:

www.konicabt.com/Products/Workgroup/7022/
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.konicabt.com/Products/Workgroup/7022/&gt">http://www.konicabt.com/Products/Workgroup/7022/&gt</A>;

There are three services that we will want to be able to use from our
Linux or FreeBSD desktops.

1. Printing - Set up the network printing on the web interface as
Konica's reps will show you. Make sure that you set up a direct TCP
connection and make note of the port number you assign to it.

You should set up the URL in cups to read:

lpd://192.168.x.x:9999

Note that the network administrator will assign an ip number to the
Konica 7022, that's the 192.168.x.x part. He will also assign a port
number, that's the 9999.

You have to place the print driver in the appropriate folder before
setting up the printer on the Linux desptops. Its just a matter of
placing the driver in the appropriate location in your system. For SuSE
8.2, placing the drivers in equivalent locations will do fine.


2. Scanning

Basically the konica can be configured to deliver scans to specific ip
addresses via FTP, but an FTP server that allows anonymous access must
be set up at the other end. Obviously, if you take this out of the LAN,
its a security risk.

3. Faxing out

I will work on this later.



Setting this up:

1. Install pureftpd on your desktop

2. Use the print driver and set up the printer

3. Place the configuration files in equivalent locations.

4. Set your permissions, but adjust them to fit your needs:

A. - /srv/ftp or equivalent, Anonymous user must be able to have write
privilages.

B. - Give your users owndership of the scans directory and the
scanner.sh shell script.

***** That part of the package was written by Daryl Tester, - - Thank
you DT! *****


You have to take all of the files I zipped up and manually place them in
an equivalent location in your linux box.

NOTE: Open up the /var/spool/cron/tabs/root & $home/scanner.sh files and
change the word "username" to the name of the user you want to be able
to receive scans from the Konica.

$home is a variable.All that means is, is that if you are set up as user
Joe, you would put the files in the $home folder in /home/joe. If you
were running as root, put the files in the $home folder in /root.

For FreeBSD, the /var/spool/cron/tabs/root file goes in /var/cron/tabs.
You also have to get CUPS set up, and you have to follow this post, or
it won't work:

docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=535819+0+archive/2003/freebsd-ports-bugs/20030629.freebsd-ports-bugs 

&lt;<A HREF="http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch">http://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch</A>=535819+0+archive/2003/freebsd-ports-bugs/20030629.freebsd-ports-bugs&gt; 



I have released the necessary configuration files as well as the print
driver that I made for Konica IP421 type machines here:

prdownloads.sourceforge.net/automagic/Konica.tar.gz?download
&lt;<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/automagic/Konica.tar.gz?download&gt">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/automagic/Konica.tar.gz?download&gt</A>;

Use Arc to unzip the package. I have not yet made a script, I don't know
if I will...

I have tested this and it will work nicely in SuSE Linux 8.2, but I
would bet that it will work in Lindows. The same method works for
FreeBSD as well, but it may need some tweaking.
