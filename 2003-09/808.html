Okay I understand the arguments but I'm just wondering if anything other
than consumer pressure could compel them to change their T&C's. I mean, you
and I could lobby them all we want but is there a legal argument which means
they'd HAVE to change them? Has this sort of thing even had a test case?
Precedent? I have no idea. I'm not a lawyer, only a chemist. :-)

Their actions are certainly anti-competitive but that would need to be
proven in court. Right now, I have my doubts as to whether there is a law in
place that would mean they MUST stop right now.

Corey,

&gt; In what way is it not lawful, though? I'm not being a troll but I'm 
&gt; curious as to exactly which laws they're breaking. You may not 'want' 
&gt; to access their terms and conditions (I wouldn't either) but what law 
&gt; says that you don't *have* to?

They're asking me to accept a set of terms and conditions. Clearly that is
some form of contract or agreement between two parties. One of the parties
is refusing to accept the terms and conditions [1].

It's simply common law ;-)
