Thanks,
I am still in the XP Pro OS, but that was not a choice, it's becuse of my
project/work I guess.
But, that is as far it is going to go as far anymore upgrades is concerned
with MS.
Imagine going to the current "off the shelf computer package" stores, and
telling the sales Rep, you want THAT pc with Linux OS ! What will the sales
gurus do when demand grows as users  realize there are choices, and no
choice for the sales rep. but to supply the demand?
I hope it really does get to that point. ( I make no apologies to the MS
crowd,it has costed me enough in lost time and personal grief with their
stuff ups and still give not much away for free at least to compensate, when
after all, who has been doing the "bench testing" in the real world? Many
were, are, and many more will fall for the hype.
I am under no illusion  that MS will never really go away, but neither is
this growing community I have noticed, is going to go away either.
As I write this, I'm on ICQ just chatting with some friends. One asked me
what am I doing, I told them I am getting ready for a big change to Linux.
The reply was, "yeah, when is it due to come out"?!!
So ya see, I know I have to do my bit, and if it comes to a point of  "have
MS OS or can not communicate to friends",
well, I think I need to be ready for my freinds to offer an altrnative. But
an alternative solution that is as easy as simply instaling a fully
operational CD without the fuss. Cos there are people that simply will  not
bother with change.
To me it's a "war" in my own right. I have programs I cannot use anymore,
and none of these programs really needed any change. They worked fine as
they were, for what I want to do. Everytime MS upgraded, my programs became
obsolete, or "too simple" to care about.  I do not want to deal with this
type of thing anymore, so I hope this choice of migrating and starting fresh
with what I know by now will stay stable. I don't mind upgrades or newer
versions of things, but when the cost is to ditch my old programs because MS
says I "have to", to "keep up"etc...... well, ....NO ! ....enough !

But for now I am still in the "window shopping" ( NOT for ms windows) but
looking around and checking out what is out there, I hope I can test these
in the XP Pro system for now.
Soon I will have a new HDD in the caddy and it will be purely open S

Am I the only one doing this, or is this a general concensus? Is there many
out there that are simply fed up with MS and are doing  big changes, or is
it just a few who seem give rats razzoo about it?


Cheers

Pete

&gt; I recommend kmail if you are using the KDE environment, I haven't really
&gt; played with many others (except for mozilla mail which is what I use at
&gt; work)... currently I'm filtering my mail though spamassassin, you may want
to
&gt; do the same at some stage. I'm investigating signing my emails with gpg
too.
&gt;
&gt; The filtering capabilities of Linux email clients is waaay more powerful
than
&gt; outlook. For example, in kmail, I can filter on X-Spam-Flag=YES. But my
&gt; friend (who uses outlook) could not find a way to filter on any of the
tags
&gt; embedded in the email. I could also filter on the number of *'s
spamassassin
&gt; gives an email, e.g. &gt; 10 points I just delete it instead of moving it to
the
&gt; trash folder.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; &gt; I now need to look at the choice of web browsers and email to eventualy
&gt; &gt; replace IE and Outlook
&gt; &gt; The main system I use on LAN  is XP Pro with a caddy to remove the
HDD's.
&gt; &gt; The goal is to eventualy not have to rely on XP Pro for general usage
and
&gt; &gt; replace it with a pure Linux OS
&gt; &gt; No real hurry to do this, but plenty of time.
&gt; &gt; Any ideas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Much appreciated

&gt; &gt; &gt; Howdy Pete,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Perhaps my questions have been asked before. I do not know. I
