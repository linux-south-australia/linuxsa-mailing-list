Chris, it isn't so much that we are getting confused at your question,
what you seem to be missing is that if you are downloading a file from
the Internet at 1500k/sec, then you aren't SENDING data back out to the
Internet at 1500k/sec as well!

Think of it as two separate lanes - if one gets congested, then it will
slow down. It doesn't affect the lane going in the other direction!
(Well, it does a bit but for the purposes of understanding this concept
assume it doesn't)

So in answer to your question, tcp won't slow the download to the speed
of your upload.

If you really want to understand this, you'll need to find a decent book
or site how how tcp works. Cisco books work well for this I've found...

Cheers,

Sam.

&gt; &gt; It's like this.  1500 down 256 up.  I don't want to go to some 
&gt; &gt; website and start downloading a file expecting to get 1500 when all 
&gt; &gt; I would really get is 256 because TCP would rate limit me(flow
&gt; &gt; control) because of mp upload speed.  This is just my preference and

&gt; &gt; I guess if it doesn't do that then I am more than happy to go with 
&gt; &gt; ADSL but if TCP does do that then barring the cost go with SDSL.  I 
&gt; &gt; do understand about all the myriad of things that can go on between 
&gt; &gt; me and this website but in theory if that site and myself had 
&gt; &gt; unhampered bandwidth then I want 1500 down and 256 up, and I don't 
&gt; &gt; want TCP to control my connection to 256/256.  I don't know if it 
&gt; &gt; works like I want it too but that is what I want.  Does that make 
&gt; &gt; more sense now?  Is it possible to get 1500/256 not 256/256?  I do 
&gt; &gt; serve things but that is purely not the issue here.
&gt; 
&gt; i think your a little confused.
 
&gt; hence running at 1500/256 you will still receive packets at up to 1500

&gt; even if what you are sending in reply is equal to or less than 256.

See this is where some get confused at my question.  I am not talking
about the size of the packets.  I am merely talking about the speed.  I
guess it was a bit confusing giving a file size.  I just wanted to know
if TCP itself will rate limit my download to the slowest direction
(upload 256kbps).  I have been told it will but I can't seem to find any
documentation on it.  So I hope that makes it a bit clearer?
