&gt;&gt; Well, there were two snippets highlighted at SCO forum.  The first one
&gt;&gt; came from the Third Edition of UNIX (1973), the second came from BSD.
&gt;&gt; Given those facts, it's not surprising that they have to admit they
&gt;&gt; don't know where it comes from.  What I want to know is when they will
&gt;&gt; admit that their version doesn't have the BSD license at the
&gt;&gt; beginning.  See <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html</A>
&gt;&gt; (yet again).
&gt;
&gt; When I first heard SCO claiming that the BPF code sample was not supposed
&gt; to be evidence of real System V code in Linux, just a demonstration of the
&gt; techniques involved. I thought is was a good recovery from a bad mistake by
&gt; SCO but as I though about it some more I realised that it was not a good
&gt; recovery and nothing could cover up a crucial mistake by SCO.

More to the point, in the original presentation
(<A HREF="http://www.vangennip.nl/perens/SCOsource">http://www.vangennip.nl/perens/SCOsource</A> Briefing II.2.pdf, slide 15)
they clearly state that this is System V code.  Admittedly, the graphs
suggest that they are, indeed, talking about techniques as well, but
it's pretty clear that they're also claiming ownership of code which,
in all probability, they have misappropriated.

&gt; In other words the reason SCO obfuscated the BPF code is because
&gt; they thought it was their own code. Which adds more weight to Gregs
&gt; question about the lack of the BSD license in SCO's BPF source file.

Indeed.
