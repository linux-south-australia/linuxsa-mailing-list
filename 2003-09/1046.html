Ian,

If their Internal phone network was crazy... It doesn't give me faith in
their standard network. Their phone system is VoIP....... 

Michael

PS.. I remembered to turn off HTML this time... Excellent :P
Dam outlook, and my confounded brain.

At the moment (yesterday) their phone network was crazy and disconnecting at
random, at times within a few seconds of reaching a voice. 

The other day I tried to get through to their web mail area but it knocked
back my password. Fair enough but I was already logged into that same
account using that same password! Seems their web mail system went all
astray at that time.

After 4 or 5 calls to try to get the email password corrected/checked I gave
up and emailed them at <A HREF="mailto:support@airnet.com.au.">support@airnet.com.au.</A>

The email came back saying that it could not find <A HREF="mailto:support@rt.airnet.com.au.">support@rt.airnet.com.au.</A>

With serious system errors like that I am not too keen to suggest others try
to join up. Maybe once they get it all working again we can reevaluate.

Cheers,  Ian
