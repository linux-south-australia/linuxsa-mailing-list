&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am relatively new to Linux, yet it has taken me about 12 months of
&gt; &gt; reading, trying things out, installs, re-installs, mostly
experimentation in
&gt; &gt; my own time. I never knew what it all meant until recently.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Finaly I am now able to install and configure the real need in my case,
the
&gt; &gt; firewall,  connects to my internet account and to LAN's and sending this
&gt; &gt; email !
&gt; &gt; Hooray.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Having said this, I think it is time to start the next phase and how
better
&gt; &gt; else to start is by askng questions then doing it.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps my questions have been asked before. I do not know. I have read
many
&gt; &gt; many questions and their answers, kept files on some of them, but still
not
&gt; &gt; sure on many what seems to be simple things.
&gt; &gt; So if I ask some of the most seemingly simplest of questions, rest
assured,
&gt; &gt; I have already tried to read up on the particular issue, but simply may
not
&gt; &gt; comprehend the authors reply or the answers are by now out of date.
&gt; &gt;  That is not to say we are all illiterate, I think it has something to
do
&gt; &gt; with the learning phase level of where one is currently at.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; May I start with a few ideas of my own. These are not demands or
something I
&gt; &gt; need to have done RIGHT NOW.
&gt; &gt; Just ideas and possibly an opinion here or there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is my final bash on MS.
&gt; &gt; Firstly, my opinion on MS, I do not regard the MS OS to be of much value
for
&gt; &gt; stability, BUT, I must admit, the XP Pro version has allowed me to offer
MS
&gt; &gt; a "2nd chance", for now. I am getting my work done with less
"disturbances".
&gt; &gt; The "restore system" function has saved me much time with format c:\  (
&gt; &gt; averaged 1 every 3-6 months since 95)
&gt; &gt; But why all this extra stuff during install I will never actualy use ?!!
But
&gt; &gt; if deleted or uninstalled, it can compromise the rest of the OS.
&gt; &gt; What does MS care? on and on it goes, these issues have been thrashed
and
&gt; &gt; still you cannot halt the Goliath of MS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Fortunately there are alterantives.
&gt; &gt; I got my Linux firewall, I can "see" the light now and it's time to move
on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you Open Scource Community
&gt; &gt; I hope to contribute back the same help in good time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is just great !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; cheers
