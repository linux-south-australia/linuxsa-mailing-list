&gt; FYI, Gentoo already has dependencies built in as part of its package

&gt; The response isn't overly enthusiastic since booting is a critical

&gt; commands that don't work... then works a bit later. This especially

I first saw this behaviour with Windows NT 3.1 and its betas (the first
version) where you could log in and start to do things and gradually the
various services would start up. I imagine it was decided that this was
a bug. However if you knew what you were doing it could be useful. Let's
hope things like firewalls start quite early :-)
