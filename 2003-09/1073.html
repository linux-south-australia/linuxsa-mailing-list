Hi.
* Taylor, Corey (AHA) &lt;<A HREF="mailto:corey.taylor@dhs.sa.gov.au">corey.taylor@dhs.sa.gov.au</A>&gt; [2003-09-2415:58]:
&gt; &gt; Maybe the figures are population and not area coverage, cant remember 
&gt; &gt; now. but cable was very well represented especially in poorer areas 
&gt; &gt; ... go figure.
&gt; 
&gt; That doesn't defy logic too much. Optus and Foxtel have a history of
&gt; marketing to those who can least afford to buy their product. Offer them
&gt; 'cheap' deals and rigid contracts and watch the money flow in. he roll-out
&gt; of cable into poorer areas was always going to be moved ahead of everyone
&gt; else because the programs on cable cater so much to the tastes of those from
&gt; lower socio-economic backgounds (Jerry! Jerry!).
&gt; 
Oh yes! Have a look in the letterboxes too. You will find 10:1
pizza/macdonalds/whatever fast-food furniture etc etc flooding their
snail-mail 'inboxes' versus what you find in higher socio-economic
areas. These people have low income, and they are more likely to spend
all of it than those on better pay, making them prey for the marketing
machines.

&gt; Oh and before anyone goes off at me for sounding elist, bear in mind I was
&gt; brought (thrown) up in Mansfield Park in the 80's and early 90's and I'm
&gt; part Aboriginal. If there's a lower socio-economic group than the one I was
&gt; in, I would guess that the next step down would have been living on the
&gt; streets!

Not at all. Describing what you see is not elitist.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; i think there is also the issue of 60% of households in Adeliade can
&gt; &gt; &gt; not get ADSL. nearly 80% can get cable...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Adelaide.  Not Adeliade.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Nup.  Not 80% - Tel$tra stopped their roll out WAAAAY before that. 
&gt; &gt; There are huge areas of Adelaide uncabled.   I'd suspect you've got 
&gt; &gt; those figures arse about.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe the figures are population and not area coverage, cant remember now.
&gt; but cable was very well represented especially in poorer areas ... go
&gt; figure.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Whereas ADSL has quite a penetration.  You can get ADSL in Mt Barker,
&gt; &gt; but not Cable. Heck, I'm 5km from the CBD and there ain't no cable 
&gt; &gt; here, but ADSL no worries.
&gt; 
&gt; there are parts of the CBD that cant get cable or ADSL...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; if they can see the cable hanging in the street, then they can get
&gt; &gt; &gt; get it... much easier than the traumor[1] that ADSL can be.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hmm, for most ADSL much less trauma - just buy an ADSL CPE, filters
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; plug it in.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cable internet usually involves a telstra tech.
&gt; 
&gt; yes but its a preceived thing. think about Joe [Public|Sixpack]. technical
&gt; thugs like those that hangout on LinuxSA prolly know more about ADSL tech
&gt; than most the store-bound Telstra sales folks... you want any info, go see
&gt; the webpage.
&gt; 
&gt; for those that know Telstra techs, avoid Telstra techs. those that don't,
&gt; get sold on what they want to hear.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Kim
