To get from the late 60's to here and only be 9 months behind schedule
would have to make processor developement one of the best managed projects
in the history of computing. :-)

 &gt; But anyway, that strengthens your argument that silicon processing power is
 &gt; not keeping up with line rates.

It's not an "argument", Alan!  It's real life.  I can't buy a router fast
enough to run an OC-192 interface at full capacity.  Yet OC-192 exists.
Now if I can't run that link at full line rate without any special processing,
how the hell am I going to run it at anything approaching full line rate
with your queueing algorithms?

Whatever interface you come up with, I can go a factor of ten faster 
by turning off QoS.  That tells me that in any situation where congestion
is at the level which justifies QoS, it's just as effective to improve
bandwidth supply.  Since it's also almost always cheaper to improve bandwidth
supply too, the answer to the question, "How do I deal with this congestion
issue?" is usually pretty obvious.

 &gt; Either way, I still would like to be convinced that enabling some people to
 &gt; spray 100 Mbits/sec onto the net is going to have no effect or a positive
 &gt; effect on the rest of the users.

That's a bullshit argument though, Alan.  We're using the same TCP we've
been using for decades.  If you go back far enough, you can say, "Either
way, I still would like to be convinced that enabling some people to spray
64 kbits/sec onto the net is going to have no effect or a positive effect
on the rest of the users" back when we were using 2 Mbit/sec circuits in
our national backbones and serialization delays were a factor of 100 longer.

... except that TCP *DOES* allow users to spray 64 kbits/sec onto the net,
and it always has.  With the slower line rates of days gone by, the impact
on the net was just as large as 100 mbit/sec TCP sessions on the modern
Internet (if not worse).  But the Internet didn't fall over, did it?

The other thing you're not even considering (perhaps you've forgotten it
exists) is TCP's built-in congestion control mechanism.  Nobody is talking
about "enabling some people to spray 100 Mbits/sec" when there's less than
100 Mbits/sec of available capacity.

The problem we have today is that if we run a 10 Gbit/sec bearer between
Adelaide and Los Angeles, and if you are the only user on that network, and
if you're only running one application, you will have grave difficulty
running TCP at more than 100 Mbit/sec.

Why shouldn't you be able to run TCP at 10 Gbit/sec in that scenario? Why
limit a single user to 1/100th of the available line rate when there are
no other demands on bandwidth?

Frankly I have difficulty understanding why you would be attempting to raise 
arguments against solving that problem.  When I think about it I can't help
concluding that it's a pretty serious defect;  But you appear to be arguing
that designing-in a 1% efficiency limit is such a good idea that simply
researching ways to turn it into 100% efficiency should be discouraged...
