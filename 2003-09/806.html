&gt; 
&gt; Whether or not you accept their terms and conditions is not in dispute - 
&gt; obviously you don't. What I'm asking is, is there an easy way you could 
&gt; opt out at your end, rather than requiring them to stop providing the 
&gt; service to you?

there is a patch for bind9. a paste from my post to 2600au:

----
&gt; Anyone got any ideas on a hosts style trick (all oses) that says all
&gt; 64.94.110.11 addresses = www.google.com?
                                                                                                                            
there is a patch for bind9 that allows you to set "delegation only" for
particular zones. setting it for "com" and "net" means that when you query a
*.gtld-servers.net name server you only want a referral and your patched
version of bind will ignore anything else. hence, if the domain does not
exist and the name server returns a A record for sitefinder.verisign.com,
bind will ignore the A record and return NXDOMAIN.
                                                                                                                            
this way of approaching the problem means that you circumvent the current
implementation no matter which IP address verisign is using.
                                                                                                                            
on the other hand, they could start returning referrals to their own name
servers which would then offer the A record for sitefinder.verisign.com
which would make the patch for bind9 useless.
----


&gt; The question I asked about removing them from your hints file was 
&gt; directed at stopping it at your end, not theirs. Because, really, they 
&gt; are providing a service to you by providing a root name server; i would 
&gt; have thought if you don't want to accept their service, simply don't use 
&gt; it. the thing is, i'm not DNS-competent enough to know if that is even 
&gt; possible. given that none of the gurus have come up with this solution, 
&gt; i'm guessing it's probably not possible.

it's not about the root (".") servers, it's about the gtld-servers.net servers
which are authorative for "com." and "net." and are all run by Verisign.
