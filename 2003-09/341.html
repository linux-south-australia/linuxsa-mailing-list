Alan,

I agree with your points below, BUT - while I agree MS is cackling
gleefully and rubbing hands together in a manner reminiscent of the
Emperor in the Return of the Jedi, I suspect they would be merely
'assisting' SCO in as open a manner as possible, being seen to be
keeping hands clean. 

Groklaw <A HREF="http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/">http://radio.weblogs.com/0120124/</A>
has some interesting info about shares bought by a company of which
Melinda Gates is biggest shareholder. Little things like that *HELP* SCO
without being directly involved - MS can plead ignorance of Melinda's
investment strategy - hell, she could claim her advisors just invest in
likely prospects;)

SCO's erratic behaviour merely heightens the FUD factor for big
business, where Linux has made the strongest gains (& areas like German
Gvt, etc) .And where MS is seeking an increased toehold/reclaim lost
ground.....

&gt; Yes, but....
&gt; 
&gt; If SCO behaved in a professional MS-like manner, that would give the game away.
&gt; So I think the amateurism is a cloak, a disguise, a feint to cover the origins
&gt; of the actions. The changes of posture are exactly what you would get if you
&gt; were being masterminded by someone else but kept getting your instructions
&gt; mixed up. After all, MS marketing people speak in a manner which people like me
&gt; just can't understand. I would say it's just a matter of misinterpretation of
&gt; instructions from their controllers. If the commands from MS HQ are as clear as
&gt; their help manuals, it's no wonder SCO's behaviour is erratic.
&gt; 
&gt; So that's what it must be: mixed-up commands from MS, plus an intentional added
&gt; randomness to confuse observors. It's a bit like those moles in British
&gt; intelligence pretending to be drunken, womanizing party-goers to cover their
&gt; true activities.
&gt; 
&gt; The faux-amateurism of SCO also makes MS look stately and serene above it all.
&gt; It all has the appearance of a perfect marketing campaign to me.
&gt; That's how I would have organised it if I had an evil mind.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; ak.
