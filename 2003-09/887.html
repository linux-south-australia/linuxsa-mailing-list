Ian,
I havent played with E-Smith myself but..

start from the beginning..
- confirm BIOS settings for com ports
- confirm that nothing else is conflicting with these settings
- If an AT Mainboard open up the case and check the port extender is 
correctly connected to the board (checking pin 1 is the right way round)
- confirm E-Smith is recognising and configuring the ports on boot (dmesg)
- then check simple things like typo's (a common error is trying to use 
/dev/ttys0 instead of /dev/ttyS0 and it just aint gonna work :)
- Are you checking your logs? I havent seen you post any output as yet.

I know most of this is basic stuff, but it pays to start from the 
beginning and work your way through. sometimes its the most simple of 
problems, and it can save a lot of shin kicking later!

Also, got this from the E-smith FAQ

How do I set the modem initialization string for my modem or ISDN 
terminal adapter?

It is better to store the modem init in the profile of the modem, rather 
than specifying an initstring at dial time. You can store init strings 
in the modem with AT&W by accessing the modem via minicom, or any other 
serial communication program. For example:

    AT&F   AT&C1&D2&Q0%C0   AT&W

This resets to factory condition, sets the required settings (in this 
case &C1&D2&Q0%C0), then stores the current settings as the reset 
setting of the modem. (You might need/want AT&F0 and AT&W0 - refer to 
your modem manual for modem specific AT commands).

The standard reset of ATZ will then restore that condition - no need to 
change/customize the SME Server setting.

For more instructions on using minicom and other help on modem commands, 
see <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html</A>

If you really must use a dial time initstring, you can provide it when 
configuring the dial up settings during the console configuration

&gt; Another enthralling episode in the continuing saga of 
&gt; trying to get this community organisation onto the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; I can now confirm:
&gt; 1) the external modem (Samsung Vortec) is detected 
&gt; and communicates with a Windows system.
&gt; 2) the external modem is not detected nor communicated with
&gt; from the e-Smith system.
&gt; 
&gt; To get to this point I have done a load of box-swapping, drive-swapping and 
&gt; modem swapping.
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried the e-Smith drive in 3 machines: 
&gt; 2 with the same components 
&gt; and 1 with a very different specification. 
&gt; 
&gt; At no time did I get any response from the modem.
&gt; It just continued to light up CS and MR LEDs. It lights them up
&gt; even if the serial port is disconnected. I tried this through
&gt; minicom but nothing I could do would trigger any response.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried the modem on 2 different boxes with XP Pro
&gt; and Windows ME and on both boxes the lights came up
&gt; CS, RS, TR and MR. Windows is able to dial with the modem
&gt; and query the internal settings.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I have proven my point to my satisfaction that e-Smith
&gt; wont find or communicate to the modem. 
&gt; 
&gt; What really annoys me is that using a P166 box at home, 
&gt; and the SAME modem, we are happily running our home network
&gt; and connecting to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; WTF?
&gt; 
&gt; Come on folks, give me some clues. Why cant I get this project
&gt; completed and the community group up and running on the Internet?
&gt; 
&gt; We chose e-Smith for ease of use and administration. Should we
&gt; put on RedHat or Manduck just so we can get the modem working?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Ian
