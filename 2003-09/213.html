<H1>New not Syn packets from websites.</H1>

<PRE>

Hi all,
I am running iptables 1.2.5-3 on Redhat 7.3 and have used a script 
generated from one of the many online script generators. 
&lt;<A HREF="http://morizot.net/firewall/gen/&gt">http://morizot.net/firewall/gen/&gt</A>;
see attached script for complete firewall details.

the problem I am having, is that some webpages, mainly e-commerce sites 
are trying to create connections as either bad packets or connections 
which are new, but not flagged as SYN. From what I understand, this is 
basically the same as a port scanner, so the firewall rejects them.
one such site is the transport SA rego site.
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ecom.transport.sa.gov.au/&gt">http://www.ecom.transport.sa.gov.au/&gt</A>;

not really sure how I can get around this? or really the details as to 
why these sites do this. I dont really want to open the firewall up to 
portscans either.

does anyone have any workarounds? or suggestions or anything else which 
may help?? I havent found much about it googling around. or am I missing 
something simple? and could anyone explain in more detail why this is 
happeneing?

here is the log of one the drops (some of the info is over my head);
Sep  4 15:56:35 tmserver kernel: fp=bad tcp packets:1 a=DROP IN=ppp0 
OUT= MAC= SRC=207.169.245.11 DST=150.101.77.207 LEN=1420 TOS=0x00 
PREC=0x00 TTL=52 ID=22076 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=443 DPT=3616 WINDOW=24840 
RES=0x00 ACK PSH URGP=0

and here is the relevant part of the firewall;
# bad packets chain
#
# Drop INVALID packets immediately

$IPT -A bad packets -p ALL -m state --state INVALID -j LOG \
     --log-prefix "fp=bad packets:1 a=DROP "

$IPT -A bad packets -p ALL -m state --state INVALID -j DROP

# Then check the tcp packets for additional problems
$IPT -A bad packets -p tcp -j bad tcp packets

# All good, so return
$IPT -A bad packets -p ALL -j RETURN

# bad tcp packets chain
#
# All tcp packets will traverse this chain.
# Every new connection attempt should begin with
# a syn packet.  If it doesn't, it is likely a
# port scan.  This drops packets in state
# NEW that are not flagged as syn packets.

# Return to the calling chain if the bad packets originate
# from the local interface. This maintains the approach
# throughout this firewall of a largely trusted internal
# network.
$IPT -A bad tcp packets -p tcp -i $LOCAL IFACE -j RETURN

# However, I originally did apply this filter to the forward chain
# for packets originating from the internal network.  While I have
# not conclusively determined its effect, it appears to have the
# interesting side effect of blocking some of the ad systems.
# Apparently some ad systems have the browser initiate a NEW
# connection that is not flagged as a syn packet to retrieve
# the ad image.  If you wish to experiment further comment the
# rule above. If you try it, you may also wish to uncomment the
# rule below.  It will keep those packets from being logged.
# There are a lot of them.
# $IPT -A bad tcp packets -p tcp -i $LOCAL IFACE ! --syn -m state \
#     --state NEW -j DROP

$IPT -A bad tcp packets -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j LOG \
     --log-prefix "fp=bad tcp packets:1 a=DROP "
$IPT -A bad tcp packets -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j DROP

# All good, so return
$IPT -A bad tcp packets -p tcp -j RETURN

Thanks for any help offered

# Generated iptables firewall script for the Linux 2.4 kernel
# Script generated by Easy Firewall Generator for IPTables
# copyright 2002 Timothy Scott Morizot
# 
# Redhat chkconfig comments - firewall applied early,
#                             removed late
# chkconfig: 2345 08 92
# description: This script applies or removes iptables firewall rules
# 
# This generator is primarily designed for RedHat installations,
# although it should be adaptable for others.
#
# It can be executed with the typical start and stop arguments.
# If used with stop, it will stop after flushing the firewall.
# The save and restore arguments will save or restore the rules
# from the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file.  The save and restore
# arguments are included to preserve compatibility with
# Redhat's init.d script (at least in 7.x) if you prefer to use it.

# Redhat installation instructions
#
# 1. Ensure that ipchains will not automatically start.
#    chkconfig --level 0123456 ipchains off
#    This will make sure that the ipchains init.d script
#    is not linked to an S file in any of the rc directories.
#
# 2. Stop ipchains if it's running.
#    service ipchains stop
#
# 3. Execute lsmod to see if the ipchains kernel module is still loaded.
#    If it is, use rmmod to unload it. -- rmmod ipchains
#
# 4. Have the system link the iptables init.d startup script into run states
#    2, 3, and 5.
#    chkconfig --level 235 iptables on
#
# 5. Save this script and execute it to load the ruleset from this file.
#    You may need to run the dos2unix command on it to remove carraige returns.
#
# 6. To have it applied at startup, copy this script to
#    /etc/init.d/iptables.  It accepts stop, start, save, and restore
#    arguments.  (You may wish to save the existing one first.)
#
# 7. For non-Redhat systems (or Redhat systems if you have a problem), you
#    may want to append the command to execute this script to rc.local.
#    rc.local is typically located in /etc and /etc/rc.d and is usually
#    the last thing executed on startup.  Simply add /path/to/script/script_name
#    on its own line in the rc.local file.

# nat table
#
###############################################################################

# The nat table is where network address translation occurs if there
# is a private network.  If the gateway is connected to the Internet
# with a static IP, snat is used.  If the gateway has a dynamic address,
# masquerade must be used instead.  There is more overhead associated
# with masquerade, so snat is better when it can be used.
# The nat table has a builtin chain, PREROUTING, for dnat and redirects.
# Another, POSTROUTING, handles snat and masquerade.

# mangle table
#
###############################################################################

# The mangle table is used to alter packets.  It can alter or mangle them in
# several ways.  For the purposes of this generator, we only use its ability
# to alter the TTL in packets.  However, it can be used to set netfilter
# mark values on specific packets.  Those marks could then be used in another
# table like filter, to limit activities associated with a specific host, for
# instance.  The TOS target can be used to set the Type of Service field in
# the IP header.  Note that the TTL target might not be included in the
# distribution on your system.  If it is not and you require it, you will
# have to add it.  That may require that you build from source.
