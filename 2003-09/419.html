On the low end. If you just want file and print, you can argue that it
is such a basic task even Netware would cope so just put the cheapest in.

If you want to add fries...

Well imagine a directory for all your users replicated seemlessly and
securely to offices in several states. Imagine mail being routed to the
correct office based on directory lookup. Imagine mail, proxy cache and
file serving all using the same directory for authentication.

So far sounds like Active Directory and Windows 2000?

Then add VPN, packet filtering, a database of your choice, mysql,
postgresql, Oracle, whatever. Web server, secure web server, DNS and
DHCP. Secure lightweight admin via ssh. Spamfiltering and webmail.
Portable tape backup software. A remote monitoring tool to alert low
disk space etc. Web based tools to update user accounts. Snapshots of
the last 21 days of shared file online courtesy of an rsync script.
Throw in a Wiki.

Now starts to sound like Debian, OpenLdap, Spamassasin, Exim4, Samba 3,
Cyrus Imap....

The Windows 2000 solution is very good as far as it goes. Even if you
put a Windows server in, you know you are going to have to add *nix
servers to handle all the things Windows can't do well. You might as
well go all Linux/*BSD from day one.

I am glad you said money is not an issue. Decent techs cost money and
clients need to be prepared to pay if they want something better than
W2k setup by some clueless retailer.

&gt; What would be the benefit, therefore, of running a Samba file server as
&gt; opposed to a native Win2K file server?
