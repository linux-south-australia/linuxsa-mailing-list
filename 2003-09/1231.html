&gt; I recently solved a personal spam problem involving the stupid MS spam 
&gt; mail.  My method was mailfilter.  I enjoy the simplicity of it; runs nicely 
&gt; with fetchmail, matter-of-factly.
&gt; 
&gt; My .mailfilterrc file consists of rules that delete mail that is not 
&gt; addressed to any of the three pop accounts it checks.  Also, it deletes 
&gt; mail from *microsoft, *ms, and *patch, and from likewise. What kills 90% of 
&gt; the garbage is the "&lt;&gt;^(To|Cc):.*<A HREF="mailto:naota@tampabay">naota@tampabay</A>\.rr\.com" rule (deletes 
&gt; mail that isn't addressed to me).

Don't you also need an ALLOW rule to whitelist list traffic? Otherwise
you'll never see this message :-)

&gt; How is an SMTP callout different from mailfilter?

Different stage in the process. It stops the mail before it's accepted
for delivery to your mailbox. mailfilter examines what's made it into
your mailbox and deletes it before you download it to your own system.
The SMTP callout method is better but only works if you're running
your own internet mail server, which means that you have to have a
permanent (more or less) connection and your own DNS MX records. If
you're on dialup things like mailfilter are pretty much your only
option.

There is a school of thought which holds that rather than
blocking/rejecting spam, you should filter it into a spambox and
report it, eg. via spamcop; this is what I do. I'm not entirely
convinced it's worthwhile; it seems that my spam distribution has
changed such that more of it comes from .cn and .pk domains of which
spamcop says "this lot won't listen to us". It's also a PITA on
dialup, because each individual spam mail reported involves
downloading a mail from spamcop, clicking a link in it, downloading a
web page and clicking a button at the bottom, so it takes ages.
