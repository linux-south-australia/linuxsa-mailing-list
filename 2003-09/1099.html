 &gt; I must admit that I'm confused what you will say.  I think it's about
 &gt; your refusal to agree to their terms and conditions, at least that's
 &gt; what it was about when you first brought this up here.  I just can't
 &gt; see what the problem is.  If you type a missing .com or .net address
 &gt; then VeriSign's SiteFinder will appear.  If you don't accept their
 &gt; terms and conditions then you don't click any of the links, or use the
 &gt; search button.  Where's the problem? 

Email correspondents who mistype your address will end up accidentally
sending private, personal, confidential communications intended solely
for your eyes into Verisign's mail server.

Verisign has a Privacy Policy attached to their Terms of Use which,
with your consent, authorizes the collection and use of any personal
information they collect.

If you don't consent to that privacy policy, the Terms of Use specify
that your "Sole Remedy" is to cease using SiteFinder.

Given that the manner in which you have "used" SiteFinder in that
situation is by means of some third party misaddressing your personal
communications, the only way you can cease to use SiteFinder is by
having Verisign withdraw the, uh, "service".

My belief is that what Verisign have done is illegal in Australia.  They're
a corporation who have forced an opt-out privacy policy on Australian
citizens.  Opt-out privacy policies have been illegal in Australia since
December 2001 when the latest amendments to the Privacy Act came into effect.

Through their Verisign Limited Australian subsidiary, they carry out their
business in Australia, under Australian jurisdiction, according to Australian 
law.  Through their Australian subsidiary they should be called to account for
those actions;  Or they should arrange to have SiteFinder turned into an opt-
in service in Australian territory.

I have a similar case to David's weaving its way through a formal
investigation by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.  If the case comes
out the way I intend it to come out, one of two things will happen:

  - Verisign will withdraw the service;  or

  - The Privacy Commissioner will launch action on my behalf in Federal
    Court against Verisign Limited.  If that action is successful, Verisign
    will either withdraw the service, pay debilitating fines, shut down their
    Australian subsidiary, or find themselves in contempt of court -- Until
    they withdraw the service.

Either way, I don't intend to let them get away with offering me a 
fraudulent privacy policy.  If they tell me that my "Sole Remedy" is to
cease using their "service", I expect them to provide a way in which I 
can cease using it!

 &gt; (I mean, aside that you don't want
 &gt; their page displayed, but that's surely a separate issue.)

You've just made the mistake that Verisign wants you to make:  You've 
confused what they've done with the Web.

Their actions have affected far, far more than the web.  Saying that 
this is about what web pages you see when you mistype a URL is unduly 
simplifying the issue.

They've broken a *LOT* of stuff.  They're in breach of their contract with
ICANN.  They're receiving unauthorized private communications from countless
millions of people across the globe.  They're anticompetitively leveraging
their monopoly to cut the legs out from under other organizations who have
made successful businesses out of providing similar services to their own.
They're violating established standards by cybersquatting on IETF's reserved
domain names.  They need to be smacked down.

And I'm playing my part to make it happen.
