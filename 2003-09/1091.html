Matthew,

&gt; &gt; The one thing that Lindows is unable to do is send a demonstration
&gt; &gt; computer to a client and then send one of the techs to help out the
&gt; &gt; client and then modify the distribution slightly to work with the
&gt; &gt; client's system.
&gt; 
&gt; Eh?

Ok.

Let's say I purchase a Lindows enabled hard drive. And I decide I want it
to authenticate my customised LDAP with a totally nonstard schema. Yeah,
right.

Lindows will come out to Australia and help me?

*BUZZ*

But a local supplier might.

&gt; &gt; I'd prefer to buy from a local supplier...
&gt; 
&gt; You wouldn't be biased or work for someone with a competing product set 
&gt; would you?   Someone who sells a modified version of Debian ... ?

I will split your questions up into the proper parts:

"You wouldn't be biased would you?"

 1) Your use of the word biased strikes me as being negative
 2) In a negative sense, "no"

However I am providing reasonable advice.

"You work for someone with a competing product set [don't you]?"

I just happen to believe that Lindows isn't necessarily the best solution
in all cases. I do have technical reasons to believe this; I'm not a sales
person and I'm not a marketing person.

"Someone who sells a modified version of Debian..."

/me sigh

You're arguing ad hominem (to the person) here. I tender that your
concerns are invalid and that you have decided to associate me with a
competitor to Lindows simply because you have no better (or more valid)
claim that what I am saying is not true.

*discuss*
