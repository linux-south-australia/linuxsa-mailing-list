hehehehe
asimov's FOURTH law of robotics:
Zeroth law: A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow
humanity to come to harm. 

(the other three are:
A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a
human being to come to harm. 
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such
orders would conflict with the First Law. 
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
not conflict with the First or Second Law.)

then theres zeroth law of thermodynamics:
 Two bodies that are in thermodynamic equilibrium with a third  are also
 in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other.

of course, foldoc says:
zeroth
 &lt;jargon&gt; First. 

 Since zero is the lowest value of an unsigned binary integer, which is
 one of the most fundamental types in programming and hardware design,
 it is often natural to count from zero rather than one, especially when
 the integer is actually an index, as in hardware addressing or C and
 Lisp's 0-based indexing of arrays. 

 Hackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter of
 a publication "Chapter 0", especially if it is of an introductory
 nature (one of the classic instances was in the First Edition of K&R).
 In recent years this trait has also been observed among many pure
 mathematicians (who have an independent tradition of numbering from 0). 

 Zero-based numbering tends to reduce fencepost errors, though it cannot
 eliminate them entirely. 

 Logically, the next item after the zeroth should be the "oneth" but
 this is never used.
