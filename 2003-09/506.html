So lets turn this into a practical exercise (because I need the help 
and this thread is right on the topic of where I need assistance).

There is a community organisation which have a computer room with 10 
standalones running XP Pro on an ethernet network. We have a server in 
another room. AT present it is running e-Smith 6.

I have been asked if we can run profiles off the server and a printer 
off the server. Printer serving is self-explanatory and I am not aware 
that there would be any problems setting that up.

The profiles are a different matter. Seems they want to divide their 
clients up into ranges of access needs and limit their access yo 
Windows programs based on those needs.

Example: We teach ICDL so two computers have Office 2K on them. All 
computers have Office 97 on them. Can we have a profile that allows our 
ICDL students to log in and get access to Office 2K and the other 
learners only get Office 97 but on all 10 machines?

Cheers,  Ian
