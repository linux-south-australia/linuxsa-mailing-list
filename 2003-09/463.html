&gt; &gt; &gt; There are plenty of file systems about with ACL support.  I used Samba
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.2.8 on a system running FreeBSD with an ext3 file system, but you
&gt; &gt; &gt; could use XFS or another choice.  Backup programs are also capable of
&gt; &gt; &gt; backing up these ACLs with your file system, and the ACLs will apply to
&gt; &gt; &gt; either Windows or Unix users, and they're compatible with your
&gt; &gt; &gt; owner/group/everyone permissions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ACL Support in Samba is an addon, ACL support in Windows is at the
&gt; &gt; filesystem level, there is a significant difference.  A unix user logging
&gt; &gt; in locally or via nfs doesn't get ACL support, which is more of what I
&gt; &gt; was refering to.
&gt;
&gt; But how many things out there can Unix do (or be scripted to do)
&gt; out-of-the-box that a Windows system can't? :)

If you remembered my first post on ACLs, it was the fact that it was one of 
the only thinks I like about windows. Of my 11 PCs only 4 are capable of 
running Windows and none of them are.  I have several Sparcstations and an 
Ultra 5, a couple of Apples and 4 Intel PCs of which 10 are running debian 
and 1 is running SuSE. 1 of the Apples is getting an OpenBSD installation 
next week.
