Hi.

* Pete &lt;<A HREF="mailto:foundationz@internode.on.net">foundationz@internode.on.net</A>&gt; [2003-09-12 12:42]:
&gt; OK
&gt; 
&gt; This will be my first ever attempt to network a pc, apart from the f/wall.
&gt; 
&gt; The pc is:
&gt; 486, on DOS 6.22 ( has windows 3.11 installed, but not needed)
&gt; 
&gt; Just got a 2nd hand ethernet card for $5.00. so what the heck?
&gt; 
&gt; The cards details are:
&gt; Physical apearance of ethernet card :
&gt; 2 external conection slots. one is for blue cable
&gt; other is for coax cable.
&gt; 
&gt; Internal:
&gt; Central square has "N" and "Yes" and "Netware" ( logos)
&gt; 
&gt; Chip spec: NC NF -5001
&gt; Chip spec: MYSON  MT0392N, 9751 ER
&gt; Chip spec: NC PX-5004, 9750 HK
&gt; Chip spec: NC DM-1001, 5-9V
&gt; 
&gt; CIRCUIT BOARD: Pulg and Play Etherbet Card ( print)
&gt; Complies with FCC Class A ( print)
&gt; 
&gt; led description:
&gt; GREEN : LINK  ( on chrome frame)
&gt; RED: ACTVITY ( on chrome frame)
&gt; 
&gt; JP 1 : 8 OPEN JUMPER LESS/PnP MODE
&gt;          CLOSE: JUMPER MODE

Possibly one of the many ISA ne2000 clones.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; THE REASON:
&gt; 
&gt; Becuase I have a old program I still use in that box, and that program is
&gt; the basis of everything I do on the other pc's. The basics serves a
&gt; purpose,without it, it's like "loss of a limb"
&gt; 
&gt; The program saves data on a txt file it creates this as it's doing it's
&gt; processes. It is these txt files I wish to get to, and the data
&gt; then goes through another process in another pc.
&gt; Currently, to get to those files, I have to turn of the program, go into DOS
&gt; and get from there.

Probably you could junk some of those computers if you installed ONE
good OS on one of them that would do all you need. Bit hard to comment
further without more information on the nature of the 'program'

&gt; I think it would be easier to network the 486 up to the hub, and from there
&gt; the work pc have access to those files, while the program is still running?

y'know, this is a linux list? You might be able to do this using MS
software, and in fact I did something similar to link a dos-box to samba
many eons ago. You could try searching the linuxsa archives...

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions ?
&gt; 

a) Load the sexiest linux distro you can lay your hands on, on a spare
box. load dosemu and see if your DOS program will run on it.

b) Run your program in real dos running over bochs or vmware on your
linux box

c) If you have the source, convert it to linux. 

d) If you don't have the source, consider recreating it in something
portable and open-source.

d) Network the dosbox to a samba server, map the samba share as a drive
and get your DOS program to save it's stuff to the samba box.

e) keep rebooting :)

That's all from me until you include some linux content in your
questions :)


Michael

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks much apprreciated
