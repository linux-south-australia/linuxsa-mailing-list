&gt; Maybe the figures are population and not area coverage, cant remember 
&gt; now. but cable was very well represented especially in poorer areas 
&gt; ... go figure.

That doesn't defy logic too much. Optus and Foxtel have a history of
marketing to those who can least afford to buy their product. Offer them
'cheap' deals and rigid contracts and watch the money flow in. he roll-out
of cable into poorer areas was always going to be moved ahead of everyone
else because the programs on cable cater so much to the tastes of those from
lower socio-economic backgounds (Jerry! Jerry!).

Oh and before anyone goes off at me for sounding elist, bear in mind I was
brought (thrown) up in Mansfield Park in the 80's and early 90's and I'm
part Aboriginal. If there's a lower socio-economic group than the one I was
in, I would guess that the next step down would have been living on the
streets!

&gt; &gt; i think there is also the issue of 60% of households in Adeliade can
&gt; &gt; not get ADSL. nearly 80% can get cable...
&gt; 
&gt; Adelaide.  Not Adeliade.
 
&gt; Nup.  Not 80% - Tel$tra stopped their roll out WAAAAY before that. 
&gt; There are huge areas of Adelaide uncabled.   I'd suspect you've got 
&gt; those figures arse about.

Maybe the figures are population and not area coverage, cant remember now.
but cable was very well represented especially in poorer areas ... go
figure.

&gt; Whereas ADSL has quite a penetration.  You can get ADSL in Mt Barker,
&gt; but not Cable. Heck, I'm 5km from the CBD and there ain't no cable 
&gt; here, but ADSL no worries.

there are parts of the CBD that cant get cable or ADSL...

&gt; &gt; if they can see the cable hanging in the street, then they can get
&gt; &gt; get it... much easier than the traumor[1] that ADSL can be.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, for most ADSL much less trauma - just buy an ADSL CPE, filters
&gt; and
&gt; plug it in.
&gt; 
&gt; Cable internet usually involves a telstra tech.

yes but its a preceived thing. think about Joe [Public|Sixpack]. technical
thugs like those that hangout on LinuxSA prolly know more about ADSL tech
than most the store-bound Telstra sales folks... you want any info, go see
the webpage.

for those that know Telstra techs, avoid Telstra techs. those that don't,
get sold on what they want to hear.

cheers,

Kim
