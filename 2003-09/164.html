A group of economists from around Europe has issued a scathing critique of
the European Parliament's proposed law on software patents, arguing it would
damage Europe's software industry, while benefiting almost no one except
patent lawyers.

$$THE MORAL IS$$ :
"while benefiting almost no one except patent lawyers."

And I bet my bottom dollar, a patent lawyer may not even know where the
on/off switch is on PC !

&gt;
&gt; Samps,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any idea what Australian law will say about their
&gt; &gt; (SCOs) liability to repay companies that pay for licenses, once the
&gt; &gt; ruling is that SCO is not entitled to claim that money?
&gt;
&gt; It's not illegal for me to pay you for something stupid--such as a
&gt; licence to breathe fresh air--but you are not allowed to represent that
&gt; you own the IP to fresh air (because you obviously don't).
&gt;
&gt; The moment SCO sends such a licence a number of open source people will
&gt; take them straight to the ACCC. You cannot represent to someone they are
&gt; required to provide you consideration under threat of a law suit when
&gt; you have no right to do so.
&gt;
&gt; The ACCC knows and they have been told about it. SCO haven't been quite
&gt; stupid enough to try anything yet.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; DSL
