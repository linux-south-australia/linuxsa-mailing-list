Hi Pete,

Thank you for writing. I am going to try to explain why I think things are the 
way they are, and hopefully in a very friendly way.  :)

I think your post was well thought out, and helped me form a framework to 
explain the situation.

Thank You.

&gt; This topic has merit. About 8 months ago when I started the first serious
&gt; attempt in the Linux world, I started to ask questions newbies always ask
&gt; in the forums. The response from some was apathy and the response form
&gt; other was helpfull, but the there was something missing. 

My experience exactly, until this yank stumbled accross Linuxsa. 

&gt;I still did not undertand what they all said. In one of my responses I told  
&gt; it like this:
&gt; If, you had a car and it needed a service or repairs, do you take it to a
&gt; mechanic, or do you fix it yourself?
&gt;
&gt; If you take to a mechanic, all you want to do is pick the car up and drive
&gt; it away, get to your destination and it could be work. If the car broke
&gt; down again soon after it's repairs, what then? Do you learn to be a
&gt; mechanic right on the spot, or call the mechanic that fixed it, the options
&gt; are many. But liken it with people that are encouraged by the old school of
&gt; expirieced Linux users, do you expect the newbie to know it all? Do the
&gt; expieienced Linux community know everything about cars and how to strip an
&gt; engine apart? For me, I happen to be in the middle. I AM a qualified motor
&gt; mechanic. When the workings of Linux system are explained to me, I know
&gt; it's technicaly the same as motor car engine, but in program lingo, yet the
&gt; explanations,if I was to explain to a client, "madam, your car is fixed,
&gt; here's how to fix next time yourself, with all due respect", and then I
&gt; explain the finer deatils.
&gt; "emm, madam, the dwell angel is set a 43o, the timing is 6o BTDC, remember
&gt; to set you tappets clearance for the inlet at 8 and the exhaust at 12,
&gt; unless you choose to convert to hydraulic lifters, there is no need to
&gt; adjust the valve clearance, and during the run in period, do  not go over
&gt; 60 mph.
&gt; And finaly, " madam, when you can get back here next week, as part of our
&gt; ongoing service, we will show you how to adjust your own breaks, so to as
&gt; avoid a crash !"

There are several reasons why the software is the way it is:

Firstly, we have to make our own cars. :) No company alone, except for 
Microsoft, has the resources to build a car the way most people want it. 
However, if a community is able to work as a group and partner together, it 
has a chance to build a car just like the one you want. 

Secondly, the community is working together as a group to break Microsoft's 
monopoly, as we are the last hope to do so. We need everybody's help because, 
as you know, a lot of complicated issues go into enabling a driver to merely 
turn a key to start his car.

Collaboration helps pay for our car, but we need people to learn about how the 
car works to help us.  Just like building a car, developing and maintaining 
an operating system, is a very complicated task, and our experience has shown 
us that it takes a certain amount of stubborness and curiosity to be an 
effective helper. 

In addition to collaboration, an understanding of the system allows people to 
actively participate in the community by forming solutions to problems that 
arise, which makes the software more useful for everybody.

Thirdly, we sometimes have to build our own pieces of the car, so we have to 
leave certain parts of our projects unfinished such as not to prevent other 
parts of the car from being developed. 


&gt; But can you see my point? People just want to get in their cars, turn the
&gt; key, and drive to work.
&gt; The same with an operating system especialy when the community is trying to
&gt; get something happening, please consider there ARE many that are just sick
&gt; and tired of M$ way of manipulating the OS, they try a different solution,
&gt; only to find the "mechanics" of the good solution expect everyomne else to
&gt; become a "mechanic" to !

Unfortunately,  we still have more work to do to get to that state, but we 
would very much like to have your help.


&gt; If I could engineer the installs, the layouts etc etc, it would be just
&gt; that, turn the key, drive away and get to work, or play.
&gt; Fortunately, I am in a good position to be in the middle of all this. I
&gt; said recently I am new, but when I say "new", by that I mean I am ready to
&gt; strat my "aprenticeship" from the smorgasboard of the open scource
&gt; concept.

Welcome aboard!

&gt; ((My actual motor mechanic days are over in a practical sense, but
&gt; by all means, ask me for advice on your own cars, I don't mind. Fix it ya
&gt; self, the spare tyre is usualy in the boot, thats the rear end of some
&gt; cars.))
&gt;
&gt; :-)

:-)

&gt;
&gt; It's the least I can do for all the help many have given me so far.
&gt; What I will choose from the smorgasboard of open scource I have not decided
&gt; yet, it's still a mess here and sorting out my pc's. BUT, I have started to
&gt; read, and practice and ready to get my hands a bit dirty for a start.

Looking forward to working with you.

James Leone
