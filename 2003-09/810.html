Ben,

By now, heaps of people who have control over their own DNS servers have
downloaded and activated the "delegation only" patch to the BIND DNS server.
This is a case of "lucky for some!". Unfortunately, not every user
has their own DNS server under their very own control (like I have in
my "living" room). 

There are also issues of whether tens or hundreds of thousands of people
worldwide should be required to spend their valuable sys admin time and
energy opting out of something evil like this. It really is the worst kind of
spam. The verisign wildcard hijack is not anything other than pure spam.

So...

-	Some people can't opt out because they don't control their own
	DNS server or their ISP won't fix it, or their DNS server runs
	something other than BIND.

-	There's that huge heap of lost productivity to get rid of the problem.

-	Then there's the worst thing of all --- the very real fear that
	Verisign will do a simple workaround of the "delegation only"
	BIND patch. So far, I don't think anyone knows how they're going to
	create a new patch to thwart the next step in Verisign's escalation,
	which is only likely to happen when a significant proportion of
	DNS servers have the delegation-only opt-out implemented.

It's the last point that is _really_ worrying people right now.
What will Verisign do next?

As to the necessity to use Verisign's root servers...

-	The DNS is the white pages of the Internet. (The search engines
	are the "yellow pages".) Doing without DNS is like doing
	without the white pages phone book. 

-	Some people have tried creating alternative root servers. But the
	problem is that you need to integrate that with the domain name
	registration service. The DNS is a very dynamic database which
	needs to interface to the Registrars. That's the difficult bit.

Cheers,
ak.

PS.  Just in the unlikely case that anyone didn't know what I meant when
earlier I said "other services apart from the web", what I meant was
the entire contents of the /etc/services file, and much more besides.
E.g. you ping a host to see if it's up. Yep, it's up if you misspelled
the domain name or the domain name has expired!!
