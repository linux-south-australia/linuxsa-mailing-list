&gt; Moore's law never meant to be a guide on price just on performance, this
&gt; from Webopeadia.
&gt;
&gt; The observation made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, that
the
&gt; number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled
&gt; every year since the integrated circuit was invented. Moore predicted that
&gt; this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. In subsequent years,
&gt; the pace slowed down a bit, but data density has doubled approximately
every
&gt; 18 months, and this is the current definition of Moore's Law, which Moore
&gt; himself has blessed. Most experts, including Moore himself, expect Moore's
&gt; Law to hold for at least another two decades.
&gt;
&gt;
however, when you're talking about GPUs instead of CPUs, the rate of
performance growth seems much higher. Some estimates being 6 months in the
articles I've been reading of late. (APC, PC Authority, Atomic, PC User).
How accurate that is, I couldn't say
