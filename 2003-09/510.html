&gt; &gt; I didn't reject his comments because of his attacks on Linux. I rejected

&gt; &gt; because I felt your stance was misled?
&gt; 
&gt; Romana, like you, missed the point, which was not that IBM stole from
&gt; SCO, but that the open source community needs to be careful about
&gt; how it obtains its works.  Even quite innocent actions can be wrong.
&gt; For example, at the AUUG conference SCO showed an email from one IBM
&gt; engineer to another explaining, very briefly, how he had solved a problem
&gt; in AIX.  SCO claim that IBM's UNIX contract assigns all derivative works
&gt; back to SCO, and that therefore that idea is owned by SCO.  The point
&gt; is not that IBM's UNIX derivations belong to SCO, rather that one IBM
&gt; engineer, having had access to AIX source (which undeniably is a UNIX
&gt; derivative) gave a hint, in all good faith and probably in ignorance of
&gt; the implication, to someone working on Linux.  It's could be that easy
&gt; to violate SCO's rights.

I find this rather irritating, back in 1994 a couple of mates and I discussed
an idea about using a car airconditioning unit to cool the air going into the
inlet manifold of a "performance" car. one of those guys built one on an EFI engine,
and it works well enough. now in 1999 Ford patented this same technique...

so, none of us can actually continue any of this work for non-academic purposes.
nor an myriad of other funky tech that we partially developed for passive
stability[4] (anti-roll & anti-dive etc) ... but the one avenue left seems not
to be patented, but im going to have to check first. then develop it 
very quitely, then patent it or a large company will take it away from me, etc, etc...

why do people bother? its the same with computer tech too[2]. its so much easier to
work for the man, etc[1]..

cheers,

Kim
[1] its still Monday, can you tell.
[2] except with computer tech you dont need to actually have a working one to get a patent[3].
[3] it seems.
[4] thank you citroen
