even then... how sure can anyone be that any Internet app (IM, browser, 
download client, file sharing, email, whatever) they use will only ever look 
at existing locations on their own? (ad-ware is a great case of this, or any 
connect-out trojan, or spy-ware, or whatever). you may not be doing it 
yourself, but your computer, generally under your control, is. so the only 
way to work this is to have your local DNS refuse to lookup anything that's 
not white-listed, and to know that the things white-listed will _never_ 
change. and Joe/Jane [sixpack|public] who has a heap of apps that connects to 
some point on the net without him/her knowing or realizing (ever think that 
MSN has to find its server location? probably not for Joe/Jane), who is going 
to be the biggest cause of bad lookups (bad meaning it goes to site finder), 
would rarely have the ability (knowledge or permission or a number of other 
pre-reqs) to have all their DNS go through a local daemon, nor would they 
think to ask their ISP to do so. lets face it, the unwashed (eww, dirty 
email) masses probably don't care, or even realize that something is wrong. 
(oh good, this odd web-site name doesn't fail anymore. I like it when things 
work. if more sites work, that means the Internet is growing, which means I 
should spend more time exploring it)

without white-list-only DNS with a list you can rely on (and that just might 
possibly work where you have situations like telecommuting, where all the 
person does is connect to a work computer, and not do anything else on the 
net... shyeah, that's not so likely after all), all you can do to opt-out is 
to not use the net. unless you follow through with legal cases until verisign 
stops.

realizing that more than just the web was affected added to this... realizing 
that even if the user only ever enters valid names, other apps they use could 
come up with sitefinder adds to how deep a problem this is even more.

fancy a domain name expiring, and your jabber connection (jabber being an 
example other than email, which is the biggest one here), which you have 
connecting with a saved password when you start your computer, say, connects 
to something on the jabber port on sitefinder? revealing your password, and 
maybe other info, to verisign, who collects your information?

imagine just how much info they could collect from email, dns, what site you 
were trying to get, all the other protocols which could land there about 
you... if it were stored and indexed well, it wouldn't take long for them to 
be able to connect one piece to another, and eventually have a whole mess of 
information about anyone that they shouldn't have.
scary thought

The more we see about this, the worse it turns out to be
