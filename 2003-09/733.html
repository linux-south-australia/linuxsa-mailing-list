Alan,

I concur totally, the advantages of having a home mail server are
enormous & it's not really that difficult to set up.

We started administering our own postfix/fetchmail/procmail/spamassassin
server at home during the great *@adelaide.on.net spammage of 2002 when
our ISP based e-mail addresses were flooded & the ISP refused to lift a
finger.

We've never looked back.

Have even been running our email server on dial-up the past few weeks
with no problems, (recently moved house & no DSL re-connected yet).
We put the link up for half an hour or so every couple of days to let
all those queued messages on remote servers come streaming in.
Hell we don't even have a domain as such, just some scripted DNS
forwarding that updates when the link is put up.

Gotta luv the internet 8^)

Regards,
Rick

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm always surprised by how few people have their mail server at home.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I can see advantages in the client-server approach, but there are advantages
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the mail server being on your own machine too.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; many people don't want the responsibility of ensuring that their primary
&gt; &gt; mail server is up 24/7.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; i do run my own mail server but it is in a data centre and not in my lounge
&gt; &gt; room. then it gets redundant connectivity, UPS etc.etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Martin,
&gt; 
&gt; Those are some of the advantages which I had in mind. And I don't disagree
&gt; with them. But people using the ISP's SMTP endpoint are denying themselves
&gt; the very considerable advantages of a lounge-based STMP server.
&gt; For example, I get only about one spam every 3 months, and if I had
&gt; Romana's situation, I'd type a line of code and I'd be laughing. It would
&gt; also stop the spam bounces.
&gt; 
&gt; You don't need 24/7 for a mail server, of course. SMTP servers will
&gt; generally keep trying for 4 days to deliver your mail to you. So you just
&gt; have to keep your down time to under 4 days. It might be better to
&gt; receive your linuxsa mail on someone else's server though if you don't
&gt; have a reliable set-up at home.
&gt; 
&gt; If one has the money, the best of all possible worlds might be a
&gt; collocated machine with a trusted ISP, as you seem to have.
&gt; But that requires both money and trust!!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; ak.
