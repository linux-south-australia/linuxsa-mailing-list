I have been using 3ware controllers. I have replaced a couple of drives
on running systems. The users kept on using database, file, print email
etc like nothing happened. They have a fancy web based interface that I
don't use and a neat little command line app. I can tell it has a new
drive and then add it to the RAID and it will do a rebuild.

The debian rescue disk works with 3ware which is a nice bonus.

Also it is nice to have your RAID called /dev/sda instead of /dev/hda ;-)

I am sure the Promise is unbeatable for the price.

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; About 2 years ago, I built a box with a MSI motherboard that had
&gt; integrated Promise Fastrack 100 IDE Raid. (It was a 694D-Pro-R)
&gt; 
&gt; On Monday morning, the box was off the air, and I rang the locals and
&gt; asked them to inspect it for me. There was a terrifying screeching noise
&gt; emanating from the case, and I diagnosed a catastrophic disk failure,
&gt; and decided to pay it a visit.
&gt; 
&gt; Upon boot, the screen was stopping at a screen advising that the Raid
&gt; array (Raid1 Mirror) was critical, and gave the option to continue
&gt; booting or enter the Fastrack utility. I spent some time in Fastrack to
&gt; identify the dead drive, pulled it out and replaced it, rebooted and
&gt; re-entered the utility. There is an option there to rebuild the array,
&gt; which I did, and all was sweet again.
&gt; 
&gt; The process is not as clean as the fancy java apps that come with the
&gt; mainstream Raid Controllers, but it did the job, no data was lost, and
&gt; the downtime was the length of time it took me to get there and fix it.
&gt; Unless you have a hot-spare, someone has to attend to do the physical
&gt; swap.
&gt; 
&gt; The only downside is that the disk failure took the machine down, where
&gt; it really should have stayed online. I don't know if that is normal for
&gt; a Promise IDE raid controller, or if something else was going on (maybe
&gt; the failing drive was pulling a lot of amps and overloading the power
&gt; supply...)
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
