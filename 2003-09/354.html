&gt; Yeah, I think you're right, Alan.  I think we should definitely make sure
&gt; that as technology and capitalization improves, and the Internet evolves
&gt; into something based on 10 or 100 or, let's face it, 1000 gigabit per
&gt; second wide-area bearers, we should make sure that the users of the 
&gt; network are constrained to the same throughput rates they were able to
&gt; achieve when the standards were laid down in the 1970s.

Mark,

Both you and Glen would be in a good position to say if the Australian
network architecture has serious provision for some notion of fairness
- which _I_ would call fairness anyway.

Specifically, I would call network queueing fair if, for example, all traffic
in network nodes was queued with a separate FIFO (real or virtual) for each IP
host source/destination pair, with round robin (per-byte, not per-packet)
service for all FIFOs. (I know the situation is much more complex than this,
but this is a linuxSA post, not a research paper...) I've read from time to
time that Cisco do do some sorts of attempts at application-level
classification and fair queueing -- in fact, I think they've got big heaps of
patents on their own proprietary queueing algorithms.

If such one-FIFO-per-IP-src-dst-pair round robin queueing were in place, then
there would be no harm at all (roughly speaking) in permitting any old bit-rate
to any user.  But with naive single-FIFO queueing, letting some users have
super-high bitrate will just swamp the innocent non-greedy users.

I'm sure you've read your history books about the bad old days of TCP
malperformance before the slow start was introduced. Just "going for it"
results in the network being swamped by greedy users. The current limitations
on TCP tend to balance usage to a great extent. If you take out that sensible
self-restraint, you end up with "greediest takes all". So isn't it a danger that
Web100 could take us back to the bad old days before the slow-start algorithm?
That's my question. I don't know the answer.

What do you think Web100 will do to VoIP performance if Web100 becomes
widespread? Are you really quite sure that VoIP will do fine against a
background of Web100 users? As you know, VoIP RTP traffic has no positive
indication in UDP/IP headers to indicate application protocol, and there is no
fixed single port to indicate RTP.  A kludge-fix could be to split TCP and UDP
into separate FIFOs and do them round robin or some such fair queueing idea.
But that would be too simple.

On the face of it, unless you can tell me something contrary, it looks like
Web100 will clobber VoIP.

Cheers,
ak.
