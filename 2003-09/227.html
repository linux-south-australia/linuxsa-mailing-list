&gt; I'm confused, is this a bad thing?

dump can run as a non-root user to backup up file-systems
because it accesses the raw disk partitions.  It's one step
up from a "dd", because it's intimately familiar with how
a file system is constructed.  Some people will tell you this
is a bad thing, because you can't restore the files onto file
systems of other types.  However, because of this there are
other areas where dump excels, such as the ability to accurately
record a sparse file system, and the ability to restore a file
system to all intents exactly as it was saved (even to the
extent of same inode number for a particular file, and if you've
ever used a proprietary application that ties itself to its
inode number, and they exist, then this is an asset).

tar and cpio, because they go through the traditional file system
interface, require root privileges to be able to access all files.

&gt; hmmm ... tis a shame, he cans it for all the reasons that
&gt; make it good, like backing up a give filesystem etc...

For all of Linus' super powers, I don't think system administration
is one of them.

&gt; well then, dump will have to be made more upto date...

The problem can't be fixed in dump.  It's "broken" in the kernel.

&gt; i wonder when this will happen? sounds like a good idea, why
&gt; isn't it part of the current design framework?

That's my beef.  Because its considered "brain dead", it's been
broken without a working substitute.  There is probably a way
around it (I'm wondering if Sistina's LVM has snapshot capability
yet), but that requires a complete rebuild of a working (and
production) environment.
