This is a complicated question. You can write closed source software for
Linux as long as it doesn't include code or link to code that precludes
that.

For instance you can include BSD licensed code, but you can't include
GPL licensed code. You can link in LPGL libraries but not GPL ones.

If all the code is written from scratch and does not link in anyone
elses libraries you can closed source, no problems.

I would be very careful about creating closed source for Linux. You have
to offer significant value for people to choose closed source over open
source.

Open source software really is about providing the source when
distributing. If you are developing the program for inhouse use only,
then you can keep the source closed and use open source components.
However then you don't get the benefit of having a development community
helping you.

Be careful about developing the next big idea in software. One of the
advantages of open source is that somebody has probably already done it
or something close. You may be better off building on their work if you
are happy to leave the source open.

BTW, the scheduled bell ringing can be done by cron and ntp will get the
exact time for you.

&gt; Let's say, hypotheticaly, I now have the OS installed, I am on the net,
&gt; I can do my bookeeping and get on with work from home.
&gt; The next thing is, specific programs, to do specific tasks and run under
&gt; a Linux OS.
&gt; For example, let's say I need to know the exact time, every hour. So I
&gt; contract a programer, show him/her my reason and what it's suppose to
&gt; do, then he/she writes a program and every hour on the hour and it
&gt; checks the time for me, then rings a bell.
&gt;  
&gt; If in principle this was to be developed because I have reason to use it
&gt; as part of my overall operations, then is that "tell the time" program
&gt; an open scource ?
&gt;  
&gt; The answer to this question may seem trivial to some, but I have a reason.
&gt;
