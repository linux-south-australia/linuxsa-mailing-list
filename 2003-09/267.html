Hello Ian,

With your experience with E-Smith I'm surprised you didn't go with that
considering the ease of setup and ongoing management.

&gt;  We have just become the 'help' guys for a community org
&gt;  trying to wire up their computer room. The room has 10 boxes
&gt;  running XP etc. The server is now running Mandrake 9.1.
&gt; 
&gt;  We have played around with the beast for days but just don't
&gt;  seem to be lucking on the right combo to get the darn thing
&gt;  online so the terminals can connect to the net when needed
&gt;  for training etc.
&gt; 
&gt;  Oh, we did have it online one day 2 weeks ago. It worked a
&gt;  treat and all the terminals picked up the net. The machine
&gt;  got shut down that night by a cleaner and we have had no
&gt;  luck connecting since then.
&gt; 
&gt;  It used to dial into the ISP and then sit there doing
&gt;  nothing. 16 packets in 3 minutes...you know the problem.
&gt; 
&gt;  Today we upgraded from Manduck 9.0 to 9.1. Now we cant even
&gt;  get a successful log in, all we get are validation errors.
&gt;  We suspect part of today's errors may be caused by the ISP
&gt;  (SENet) but they don't support Linux so we are in a
&gt;  desperate search for a soft part of the wall to bang our
&gt;  heads against unless we can get this beast online in the
&gt;  next few days.
&gt; 
&gt;  Any clues on what we should be doing/ using/ looking
&gt;  for/testing with etc?
&gt; 
&gt;  Oh, I should add that we have to put up with an infernal
&gt;  modem but a quick download corrected that incompatibility
&gt;  and it is now dialling fine, just getting nowhere fast...
