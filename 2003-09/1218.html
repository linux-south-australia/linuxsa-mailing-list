 On President Bush:

 "Well, we're all excited because President Bush has started
 his 35-day vacation. He's down there in Crawford, Texas and
 on the first day of his vacation he went fishing. He didn't
 find any fish, he didn't find any lakes, but he believes
 they're there and that his intelligence is accurate."
 -David Letterman

 The White House released a videotape of President Bush
 meeting with his cabinet and today Iraqi officials say they
 believe the tape is authentic."
 -Jay Leno

 "The United States is putting together a Constitution now
 for Iraq. Why don't we just give them ours? It's served us
 well for 200 years, and we don't appear to be using it
 anymore, so what the hell?"
 - Jay Leno

 President Bush held his first full press conference in over
 five months this week. He announced that the war on
 terrorism is continuing, much more work needs to be done on
 the economy, and Saddam Hussein has not yet been captured.
 And then he said, 'I'm going on vacation for a month.'"
 - Jay Leno

 "President Bush is leaving to go to Crawford, Texas, for a
 35-day working vacation. This should go over big with all
 the people who're taking a can't-get-work vacation."
 - David Letterman

 "The White House says that the vacation in Texas will give
 President Bush the chance to unwind. My question is, when
 does the guy wind?"
 - David Letterman

 "If you add up all the time he's spent on the ranch, he's
 spent more time in hiding than Bin Laden and Hussein put
 together."
 - Bill Maher

 President Bush's economic team is now on their "Jobs and
 Growth" bus tour all across America. I think the only job
 they've created so far is for the guy driving the bus."
 - Jay Leno

 President Bush has refused to declassify portions of the
 congressional 9/11 reports about the Saudis, because he says
 it will help the enemy. Not Al Qaeda, the Democrats."
 - Jay Leno
