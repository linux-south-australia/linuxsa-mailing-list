Another enthralling episode in the continuing saga of 
trying to get this community organisation onto the Internet.

I can now confirm:
1) the external modem (Samsung Vortec) is detected 
and communicates with a Windows system.
2) the external modem is not detected nor communicated with
from the e-Smith system.

To get to this point I have done a load of box-swapping, drive-swapping and 
modem swapping.

I have tried the e-Smith drive in 3 machines: 
2 with the same components 
and 1 with a very different specification. 

At no time did I get any response from the modem.
It just continued to light up CS and MR LEDs. It lights them up
even if the serial port is disconnected. I tried this through
minicom but nothing I could do would trigger any response.

I tried the modem on 2 different boxes with XP Pro
and Windows ME and on both boxes the lights came up
CS, RS, TR and MR. Windows is able to dial with the modem
and query the internal settings.

OK, I have proven my point to my satisfaction that e-Smith
wont find or communicate to the modem. 

What really annoys me is that using a P166 box at home, 
and the SAME modem, we are happily running our home network
and connecting to the Internet.

WTF?

Come on folks, give me some clues. Why cant I get this project
completed and the community group up and running on the Internet?

We chose e-Smith for ease of use and administration. Should we
put on RedHat or Manduck just so we can get the modem working?

Cheers,

Ian
