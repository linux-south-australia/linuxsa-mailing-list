&gt; So what you are saying is that it should take longer to download 6 100MB
&gt; files 1 at a time from one site versus downloading them all at the same
&gt; time from one site, and provided that the upstream and the other end and
&gt; points in between is not a limiting factor?  Sorry if I am not getting
&gt; it but that is what I thought in the first place (:

Nope, because in that case you would have 6 downloads taking 250kbps
each for the download/inbound with a backchannel/outbound usage of say 6
x 25kbps (150 total, so still 100 free), or 1 download, using 1500/150
(assuming 10% backchannel again).

Basically, their should be little difference, except that when doing
them one after the other, you will leave a gap between them due to going
to make coffee, watching tv or something ;-), unless you are using a
download accellerator, like prozilla for linux.

I find that if I dont really care if things arrive _now_, then I'll
schedule/start a few downloads at once, and leave them. However, if you
really want it NOW, then you do a single download to get it as quickly
as possible.

To Summarize:

No matter whether its a single download at a time, or 6, you should not
be limited by the asynchronous nature of ADSL because the ack's that TCP
traffic uses are only about 10%-15% of whatever the inbound data is.
