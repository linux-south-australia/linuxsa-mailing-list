&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; Whilst still in the process of "migrating", there has been much much 
&gt; reading and getting ready for the day to install the OS, eventualy. I 
&gt; want to do install it right the first time and be aware of what else 
&gt; is around on the "smorgasboard" of choices.
&gt; One of the postings shows places/shops which favours Linux/Open 
&gt; Scource etc, and I am now confused.
&gt;  
&gt; A "packaged" deal with the following details sells the OS. Can someone 
&gt; please explain to me, why this cost?
&gt; I thought the OS was "free", or are these the "free_loaders" taking 
&gt; advantage of whatever there is to take advantage of ?
&gt; I will certainly not pay this amount if we are told Linux is free OS 
&gt; software. ( understand there are CD costs etc)
&gt; With all due respect, I will make apologies if I cannot "see" 
&gt; something here, but hey ! Can someome please explain to me, either on 
&gt; the post or a personal reply will be ok, basicaly, why pay for this 
&gt; package at $273.90-$249.95 ?

There are two things going on. One is that Red Hat sells another version 
for probably 1/4 of that price, which is a pretty good deal. SuSE sells 
one that is a little cheaper than that.

The second is that you are paying for them to gather software for you. 
They go out and about and get the software together for you, and make it 
easy to install, which is what the money is for. The high priced 
products are for setting up servers, etc.

&gt; Thanks


:)
