&gt;&gt; Pity that Bell's own anti-trust suit didn't permit them to commercialise
&gt;&gt; Unix.  A marriage of Bell (Unix) and IBM (PC) would have made the current
&gt;&gt; computer climate much more interesting than it otherwise has been.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; David,
&gt;
&gt; At the time, didn't the intel family of CPUs lack an MMU capability?

Yes, but so did early PDP-11s.

&gt; Until the 386, unix on the PC would have been very difficult surely.

It was not that difficult on the 286, but nobody loved the 286.  There
*were* implementations of UNIX on the 808[68].

&gt; Around about then must have been the 68010-based Sun-2. (My memory of
&gt; this is not very reliable because the earliest Sun I used was the Sun-3.)
&gt; The 68010 was just able to do the required full stack-save required for
&gt; multitasking with MMU page break interrupts, I believe.
&gt; I don't think the Intel family had this kind of full-stack-save and
&gt; MMU support in the 80186 and 80286, which is why linux requires a 386.

I'm not sure what you mean by "full-stack-save".  Saving context
wasn't a problem with any processors you mention, nor with the 68000.

&gt; If this is right, then the price of an IBM-PC with Unix would have
&gt; been pushed up into the Sun-2 price range, which would have made it
&gt; too costly for the mass market. Also, Unix at that time required a
&gt; big heap more memory than small businesses were prepared to pay for
&gt; a PC.

No, the prices are dictated more by market volume than complexity.

&gt; So what I'm saying is that probably unix on the IBM-PC could not
&gt; have gotten off the ground until more like 1988 or so when the 386
&gt; system price started to become more affordable. (In 1988, in our
&gt; 100-person IT company, only very few top people had a 386. The
&gt; accountant was always complaining to me that his spreadsheets took
&gt; too long on the 286 with 640k RAM. But he couldn't make out the
&gt; "business case" to get a 386 just for himself.)

I believe the earliest version was round 1984.  I've mislaid the copy
of UNIX Review which describes it, but note SCO's (exceptionally,
correct) claims to having UNIX on the PC in the early 80s.

&gt; It would not have been in IBM's interest to develop hardware which
&gt; could run unix because it would have taken business away from the
&gt; mainframe surely.

That's not the way IBM works.  They didn't expect the PC to be even
that successful.  It was a last-ditch attempt to save the 5100 line.
