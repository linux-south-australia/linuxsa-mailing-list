Hi,

Running the new version of Clark Connect 2.0 which is based on Redhat 9.0
It uses Roaring Penguin PPPOE for connection/authentication.

When the Server is first started it runs fine but then at some stage in the
future it gets out of shape ( See /var/log/messages ) below.

At this stage I can only assume that when the connection drops for whatever
reason it is trying to start a new ppp session even though the other one is
still running ??
Does anyone have any other ideas as to the cause for this behavious ?
I have checked the Clark Connect forums but have yet to find an answer.
I am also running ddclient for update of Dynamic IPs. Could something there
be triggering these new ppp1 and ppp2 sessions

Thanks

Michael
