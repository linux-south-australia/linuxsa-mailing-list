&gt; Your response seems to indicate that CPU speed is the limiting factor in
&gt; network congestion. That's the first I heard of this. I thought it was
&gt; the physical bit-rate of links.

That hasn't been the case for at least the last five years on
commercially available networks, and a lot longer on research networks.

Think about the implications of my opening comment in my last message:
Bandwidth increases at a rate which exceeds Moore's Law.

CPUs have been doubling in speed for the same number of dollars every
18 months.

Available capacity in a piece of fibre has been doubling around about
every 9 - 12 months.

Plot a few curves to work out the inevitable.

Now think about that in terms of queueing strategies, and the fact that
they must be implemented in software or on ASICs which switch electrons
rather than photons.  The queueing technology which you've been telling
me is the answer to network congestion simply isn't fast enough to run
serious networks today, and it'll become even more inappropriate in
the future as the gulf between achievable bandwidth and achievable MIPS
expands.

Modern routers cope with high speed network interfaces by putting as
much packet switching functionality into hardware as possible.  The
ideal is to have a packet enter a network interface into high speed
SRAM, then get switched out through its destination interface, without
the CPU ever getting a look at it.  Even then the ASICs are the
performance limiters;  You can put a square wave in one end of a
fibre and pull an identical square wave out the other end at a frequency
many times greater than any achievable signalling rate available today.

Other techniques like DWDM split a fibre into lambdas, where each
wavelength carries data slowly enough for the silicon to keep up with.

None of this is theoretical;  you buy systems which work like this today
off the shelf.  That's why Linux boxes (and anything else which involves
a PC) is a toy router.

How, precisely, can queueing algorithms keep up with that?
