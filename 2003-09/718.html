Peter,

&gt; Go to Hell David !

I thought that you had put this into private discussion for a reason;
ostensibly to protect the kids you are trying to help.

&gt; I am asking specific questions for specific reasons.

Yes.

&gt; If you have nothing bettter to say, especialy when you change the subject
&gt; headings with crap like such, and when we have kids and others trying to
&gt; beat problems associated with your subject heading propaganda, the better
&gt; off we may be with less screwballs such as you !

If you are wholly unable to create subjects that even pertain to what you
are asking about--and waste my time arguing with me when I indicate that you
really should use meaningful subjects--then I would tender that I may not be
what you accuse me of.

In fact, let's take a look at the facts:

 1) I have answered both/all of your questions
    - and quite reasonably

 2) You have heaped a torrent abuse on me

If you can tell me that my technical answers were wrong then maybe you might
have a good chance of flaming me about the various subject changes that I
have made.

Until such time--and this isn't one of them--I'd suggest you quite writing
torrents of abuse (unwanted and unearned) at me ;-)
