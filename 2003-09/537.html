$author = "Chris" ;
&gt; 
&gt;      I have been wondering recently which S/ADSL service to purchase and
&gt; well I have a few questions that I figured might be answered here.  Take
&gt; for example 6 files each 100MB in size.  The upstream all the way can
&gt; handle this and congestion is not a factor at this point.  My ADSL
&gt; connection is 1500/256 as offered by a couple of ISPs in town.  Now I
&gt; would like to download all 6 files as quick as possible.  I have been
&gt; told that downloading each file one at a time is just as quick as
&gt; downloading all 6 at the same time.  

in theory that is true. in reality there are numerous variables that could
affect which way would be quicker.


&gt; Now as far as I know there are ways to control your "flow control" in TCP
&gt; so would that allow me to download faster all 6 at one time or would that
&gt; not matter?  

tcp does "flow control" itself, it's part of the protocol. tweaking it is
possible but at the network stack level which really requires a thorough
understanding of tcp/ip, the underlaying transport layer and kernel
performance.


&gt; Well I hope I haven't been too vague but I'd like to know if ADSL is for
&gt; me or if SDSL is for me on that problem alone.  I understand the basic
&gt; differences between the two.  If I can download all 6 at the same time
&gt; faster than 1 at a time then I'd go with ADSL, but if not then I'd have to
&gt; go with SDSL.  Any thoughts on this?

i think the real issue is "what is your upstream / downstream ratio?" ie.
are you a content consumer, content provider or both?

ADSL makes more sense for consumers, SDSL for providers.
