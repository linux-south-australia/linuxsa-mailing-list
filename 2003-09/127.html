I can't believe this !! here I am now "advising" an option !
But I tell you why to.
I did the same thing not long ago, bought the latest release of Linux, ( 6
CD set, and took the plunge)
All I wanted was to set up MY firewall, and failed.
No Problem, it was expected.
However, as time did not permit then, I had a firewall set up for me and was
shown  how to burn it on CD
It was from here,
<A HREF="http://www.smoothwall.org">http://www.smoothwall.org</A>

The only thing the dude wrote on the CD was:
SMOOTHWALL FIREWALL :VERSION 1.0
DO NOT USE, IT WILL ERASE YOUR HARD DRIVE.

And it did!  All is configured, I may as well exit Zone Alarm, it has not
had much work to do since this firewall set-up.
But I still have it on till I get used to everything. I don't mind the
interface ZA has actualy.

I think, if I was to go thru this phase again, that is where I would start.
Simply to connect to the net without too much fuss.
The rest can fall into place as I go.

But that's my piece, others may have a different story to tell.

Please get some expirienced advise first.

cheers

Pete

&gt; &gt; &gt; *chuckles* sounds like my goal. Using 98SE with 5Gb put aside for

&gt; &gt; &gt; decided if I'll go with Debian or Mandrake. Then as time and money
&gt; allow,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll make the other computer pure Linux (I'll have to replace the 20Gb
&gt; &gt; &gt; drive - for some reason it isn't responding as a boot drive)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As a long time debian user, the learning curve is steeper with debian.
&gt; &gt; mandrake is a great starting point, with its tools and guis. debian is
&gt; &gt; really cmd line time. i love it - its powerful and glorious, imho:)
&gt;
&gt; heh, I'm rather badly out of practice at using command line. Haven't
really
&gt; used it much since we replaced the old 386DX40 with our first
&gt; internet-capable computer (Win98, Packard Bell that later blew up when I
&gt; plugged a burner into it - no one told me Packard Bells only have 90W
power
&gt; supplies!)
&gt; Before that was a rather old Amstrad IBM clone - NEC version of the 8086
&gt; chip(V30 IIRC), DOS 3.2, CGA mono monitor, two floppies, no hard drive
(but
&gt; it had a mouse!)
