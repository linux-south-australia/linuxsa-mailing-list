Hi guys,

An update:

The spammer is advertising "generic viagra" which is probably not illegal
to sell in China, where the website is hosted. They have a few domains
registered but they all point to the same IP owned by China Telecom.
We've tracked down the owner of the domains but the details are most
probably fake.

I have contact details and even an email address to report spam and
abuse. My only concern is that they say "we cannot do anything as selling
viagra is legal here". Even if spamming and/or forging email is illegal,
it's probably unlikely that they are doing so from their web host.

I could track down the relay they are using, but even if that was shut
down they would just find another. Any ideas for the next course of
action?

Cheers,
Daniel Mundy

&gt; We are having a situation where someone has decided to use our domain
&gt; name for spamming. When they spam an account that doesn't exist,
&gt; we receive a bounce. The spammers are going at it pretty hard and as a
&gt; result our email servers are getting bogged down, and mail taking too
&gt; long to reach us.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure this has been discussed before but I haven't been able to turn
&gt; up much on google or the mailing list archives.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone offer some advice or give me a lead to some info? Cheers,
