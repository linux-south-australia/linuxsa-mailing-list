&gt; SCO don't quite seem to know what they want to do.  They are sueing/they

&gt; just bouncing around the place without clear sense of things.

The theory that best explains this is that SCO expected to be
purchased by IBM by now.  Aiming at "Linux" was another stick to hurry
IBM along by threatening one of their major new strategies.

&gt; If it really was MS behind this (and I'm not entirely convinced they 
&gt; don't have at least some hand in it)

The people that went through SCO's quarterly government paperwork say
that SCO contracted about 20% in the past three months.  If it weren't
for the purchase of the license by MS then SCO would have been in the
red for the past quarter.  So at least that sense MS has a big hand
in things.

The US stock market seems to have come to a similar conclusion.  The
price looks high, but trading volume is very low (ie, only the
suckers).  But right now in the interests of institutional investors
to keep the price high (their fees are based on funds under management
on 30 Sep).

&gt; ...then I'd have thought the strategy would have been much
&gt; better thought out.

You should probably look to the Canopy Group [1] for the source of
SCO's strategy.  At least, that's what IBM think because they've asked
for a truck-load of documents from Canopy Group.

Cheers,
Glen


[1] As far as I can figure: Ray Noorda made $$$ with Novell.  Set up
his own investment vehicle, the Canopy Group.  One of the speculative
investments was Caldera.  Caldera bought SCO, dot-bomb happened and
all Linux stocks tanked, Caldera renamed SCO and fashioned into Ye Olde
Fashioned but Stable UNIX Company.  Didn't help, as SCO's UNIX always
sucked and now that there were alternatives on i386 SCO's UNIX
business was dying.

There's a lot of back-and-forth between Canopy Group companies,
presumably adjustments to maximise Group profit.  Similarly with
management (all of which seem to be BYU alumni and God-fearing
Mormons, as is Noorda.  Of course, being based in Utah may offer no
broader choices).

&gt; Let's face MS really stands for Marketing Supremcy.

Nah, for true marketing genius look at how much OS/2
IBM managed to sell.  Astonishing for an OS that was
dead in the water the moment MS Windows 3.0 appeared.

And IBM haven't forgotten how to sell stuff.  How's
this for a strategy?  You can get Apache for free off
the net.  But IBM will re-badge it and sell it to you.

Or, we'll port this free operating system to our old
mainframes.  We'll promote that with a case study on
using mainframes for web hosting.  The company in the
case study abandons its web hosting because of its high
cost base.  But everyone still thinks Linux server
consolidation a mainframe is a good idea, such was the
force of the initial marketing.

[And yes, there's a fair bit of stretching the truth
 to fit above, but hey, we're in The Marketing Zone.]
