 &gt; Whether or not you accept their terms and conditions is not in dispute - 
 &gt; obviously you don't. What I'm asking is, is there an easy way you could 
 &gt; opt out at your end, rather than requiring them to stop providing the 
 &gt; service to you?
 
No there isn't.

 &gt; The question I asked about removing them from your hints file was 
 &gt; directed at stopping it at your end, not theirs.

The hints file is the wrong place.  They have made a change to the .com
zone, the hints file controls the root zone.  You can't fix what they've
done by changing the root zone, unless you point to a different .com 
nameserver.

There are no .com nameservers which aren't controlled by Verisign.

 &gt; Because, really, they 
 &gt; are providing a service to you by providing a root name server;

No, they provide .com and .net.  The root nameservers are controlled by
ICANN by about 16 organizations (Verisign happens to be one of those
organizations, but the business unit which runs their root NS isn't
the same as the GRS business unit which has committed this abortion)

 &gt; i would 
 &gt; have thought if you don't want to accept their service, simply don't use 
 &gt; it.

Sorry, doesn't work.

 &gt; just for reference, i am on your side; this seems like a textbook 
 &gt; abuse-of-monopoly case, ethically if not legally. it's a very slimy move 
 &gt; by verisign. i'm just playing devil's advocate.

I've been running a similar argument with their Privacy Policy (and
have lodged a formal complaint with the Privacy Commissioner -- Verisign
Limited are in Australian jurisdiction).

I've been through quite a lot more iterations than DSL with mine so
far.  I think I'm up to my fourth escalation.
