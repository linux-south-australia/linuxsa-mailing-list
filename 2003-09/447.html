&gt; Please don't fall for the trap that Darl has anything of
&gt; value to tell the OpenSource community. He doesn't have a
&gt; clue nor do his claims have anything other than a certain
&gt; curiosity value.

See, that's exactly what I meant.  You don't like his attacks on Linux and
so you reject everything he said.  What I referred to, which I summarise
as, "respect IP laws," is so clearly important and yet so unclearly
followed.  Look at Perens and Lehey to see how unclear the matter is.

My opinion: If SCO are correct in their claims, which is by no means
certain, then they positively, absolutely must defend their rights.
Obviously I hope they are wrong, or that if they are right then the matter
can be resolved without damaging Open Source too badly, but I certainly
oppose intellectual theft just as strongly as I oppose physical theft.

As to the idea that because Open Source is out in the open malapropriation
couldn't occur, well that's so naive I'll limit myself to one word:
Rubbish.
