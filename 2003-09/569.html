Hi Pete,

Go and buy the Red Hat 9 available from most city newsagents for $35. Or
go and buy any other cheap Linux distro, quite a few end up in newsagents
these days. I got Mandrake 9.1 from the front of Linux Format magazine.

Red Hat put stuff in the Professional Edition which they think is worth
the extra money. If you don't know what the extra stuff is, then you
probably don't need it.

If you want to find out what the extra stuff is then visit redhat.com.

The news agent editions work fine. If you really object to $35 then
download a copy from Internode. And since Internode is your ISP, they
won't even charge you bandwidth.

Cheers,
Geoff Russell

P.S. If after a while you come to appreciate Linux, then you might even
buy a crisp new boxed edition for no other reason than to support the
companies that let you download it for nothing. I have a nice little
collection from various companies which I think deserve support. That way,
the companies stay in business, the people who can't afford $275 for
an OS to run on their 2nd hand PC can still get it for $35 or less --- all
of which is nice.
