It wasn't quite like that.  IBM and Microsoft married over DOS and
divorced over Windows.

Everybody, which is to say, Microsoft and IBM, who were everybody who
counted, loved PC-DOS; however in 1984, Apple Computer showed the world
why 1984 wasn't going to be like "1984": They introduced Macintosh, and
it was truly a revolution to the market.  (Not revolutionary technology,
because they didn't introduce anything really new, but they did bring
it to the market.)  Microsoft started tinkering with their own GUI,
Windows, and later IBM wanted a new operating system for their new
computer.  They paid Microsoft to develop OS/2 for the PS/2, and one
of the components of that was a windowing system.  It wasn't a huge
success in the market ("Half an operating system for half a computer")
but it was a good base on which to build.  Unlike DOS, which Microsoft
kept ownership to, IBM insisted on rights to OS/2.

Unfortunately for IBM, Microsoft was, by about that time, up to the
third version of Windows, and it had gotten quite good, at least the PC
market, which was used to crashes and interrupt diddles, thought it was
quite good.  At that time people started buying it without really knowing
why.  This was really hnard to understand.  I worked for a name-brand
computer manufacturer at that time, and the sales force kept saying,
time and again, that the customer insisted on Windows.  When asked why
they wanted Windows the common reply was, "I don't know, I just know I
have to have Windows."  IBM found Windows to be OS/2's main competitor,
and indeed too much competition, so they instructed Microsoft to kill it.
Microsoft refused; IBM divorced Microsoft; and Microsoft took the desktop
market in the settlement.

IBM did continue developing and peddling OS/2, but it was a hopeless case.
The operating system was technically superior to Windows but couldn't
compete against a product that people wanted for no particular reasons.

IBM were wise to kill OS/2.  By that time they could never succeed for
the same reason that MacOS on i386 wouldn't have succeeded, which is the
same reason Linux is having a hard time on the desktop: All the software
is developed for Windows because that's the OS that everyone has; and
everyone has Windows because that's the one that has all of the software.
A circular argument, true, but it works.
