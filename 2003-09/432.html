&gt;OK

&gt;This will be my first ever attempt to network a pc, apart from the f/wall.
&gt;
Cool! :-)  Linux can help you with that I think, but it could get 
tricky, and it might take a while, so if you are ready for some 
adventure....

&gt;The pc is: 486, on DOS 6.22 ( has windows 3.11 installed, but not needed)
&gt;
I have a  286 PC as well, circa 1989. Its the first PC I ever owned.  

&gt;
&gt;Just got a 2nd hand ethernet card for $5.00. so what the heck?
&gt;
&gt;The cards details are:
&gt;Physical apearance of ethernet card :
&gt;2 external conection slots. one is for blue cable
&gt;other is for coax cable.
&gt;
&gt;Internal:
&gt;Central square has "N" and "Yes" and "Netware" ( logos)
&gt;
&gt;Chip spec: NC NF -5001
&gt;Chip spec: MYSON  MT0392N, 9751 ER
&gt;Chip spec: NC PX-5004, 9750 HK
&gt;Chip spec: NC DM-1001, 5-9V
&gt;
&gt;CIRCUIT BOARD: Pulg and Play Etherbet Card ( print)
&gt;Complies with FCC Class A ( print)
&gt;
&gt;led description:
&gt;GREEN : LINK  ( on chrome frame)
&gt;RED: ACTVITY ( on chrome frame)
&gt;
&gt;JP 1 : 8 OPEN JUMPER LESS/PnP MODE
&gt;         CLOSE: JUMPER MODE
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;THE REASON:
&gt;
&gt;Becuase I have a old program I still use in that box, and that program is
&gt;the basis of everything I do on the other pc's. The basics serves a
&gt;purpose,without it, it's like "loss of a limb"
&gt;  
&gt;
Sounds like you may want to add Samba to your Smoothwall Linux box, so 
you can store the text file on the Samba/Smoothwall/Linux server. That 
way you can access it from the program.

You will probably want to move a copy of the text file to the Smoothwall 
box. After you install Samba on the Smoothwall box, you will be able to 
map the Smoothwall box as another hard drive in your work box.  Just 
save the text from your program to the text file.

Now if the work box cannot run the program on the 486, a Linux program 
called DOSEMU can, at least that's what I do. I am able to save the text 
file on the server running Samba and Linux from my Linux work box.

This can be tough to do however, so the very first thing I would do is 
set up a Windows networking client on the 486, and Samba on the 
Smoothwall box. The firewall may be tricky, so ask questions if you need 
help.

Here is a guide I wrote when I learned how to network. You already have 
Linux installed, but I am not sure if it will be as easy to set up Samba 
as it would in Mandrake, but Mandrake may be harder to set up a 
firewall.  Anyway here it is:

<A HREF="http://arcom.com.au/~gossner/curriculum/docs/easysamba/easysambaweb.html">http://arcom.com.au/~gossner/curriculum/docs/easysamba/easysambaweb.html</A>

If you run the Samba client from the 486, you will have to set up a 
network drive on that box.

&gt;The program saves data on a txt file it creates this as it's doing it's
&gt;processes. It is these txt files I wish to get to, and the data
&gt;then goes through another process in another pc.
&gt;Currently, to get to those files, I have to turn of the program, go into DOS
&gt;and get from there.
&gt;I think it would be easier to network the 486 up to the hub, and from there
&gt;the work pc have access to those files, while the program is still running?
&gt;
Good Luck!
