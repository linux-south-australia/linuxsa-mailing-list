James,

Consider this example: AIDS drugs patents.
While millions of people died in poor countries, the rich countries
maintained that IP law required those millions of people to die
rather than reduce in any way the income to the companies which held
the patents. The governments and the companies were in agreement that
maintaining the monopolies of the drugs companies was essential - even though
many of the drugs were actually developed through research by US govt
funded bodies rather than the drugs companies.

Now finally, after millions of people have died a slow agonizing death,
and there has been a massive outcry from morally minded persons in the
rich countries, the rich govts and companies have seen that it is no
longer in their interests to rigidly enforce their monopolies in all areas.
Therefore they have allowed some relaxation of licensing requirements so that
poor countries can make their own drugs and sell them cheaply.
(This is a very rough outline of the situation. There are many complexities
which don't matter in this discussion.)

In the software business, there are monopolies on file formats, effectively
maintained until now by MS through the mechanism of "trade secrets".
I.e. they just don't tell you the formats. (As a side-track, I once
enquired whether I could write my own software to read GIS info in
mapinfo format, and was told that I would be sued if I wrote software
that could read it. Therefore all of my geographical info that I wanted
to use for my work required costly software running under.... MS OS.
All of my GIS disks are still unused 7 years later.)

Now that the MS protocols (e.g. SMB) and formats (e.g. word) are being
liberated from trade secret status, various technical and legal
mechanisms are being proposed to protect MS's control over user data.

Now here's the point:
If it took the deaths of millions to budge the drug companies and
western govts to permit more liberal licensing of life-saving drugs,
then what would it take to make our govts take the side of the people
against the monopolist MS? We would need at least a million deaths,
I would estimate. 

So that's my opinion on the likelihood that open formats laws get passed.

------------------------------------
Now whether we could develop software that is so good that people feel
they would rather be in the OSS camp rather than the MS camp, the linux
offering would have to be significantly better to justify conversions
of all the data in the MS formats. 

The cost of an operating system and MS Office is a minsicule percentage of
the value of people's stored data. The OSS tools would have to be significantly
better than what MS is offering.

But now consider the drugs analogy. Consider a poor country saying "We must
invent drugs which are much better than the rich countries' drugs. Then
we can patent these and own them ourselves." Well, there are two problems
with this:

1.	It will take too long to develop superior drugs in the poor countries,
	and the rich countries will just beat them to any invention
	and patent it first anyway.

2.	The best ideas are already locked up in patents. The "low hanging
	fruit" has been picked already.

What I'm saying is that MS software is like low-hanging fruit.
MS has done the easy things - the word processors, the spreadsheets,
some database software, an operating system, etc.

The areas left for linux innovation are the difficult things which
require major investment - not just small informal groups of programmers
writing stuff in their spare time.

The Chinese have the right idea. They're making major investment in
their own hardware and software developments. You can't do that in a
laissez-faire country like Australia or the USA where the govt is regarded
as evil and the capitalists are regarded as sacred.
The Chinese are developing their own OS and office software which will
be exactly what the _nation_ needs. 
Since the notion of the "common good" is reviled as communist thinking in
the capitalist nations, linux is powerless.

Probably everyone remembers the inspirational letter from the Peruvian govt
to MS stating that it was not in the Peruvian _people's_ interest to have
all of the _publicly_ owned data made accessible only through MS formats.

Quotation:

===========================================
It is also necessary to make it clear that the aim of the Bill we are
discussing is not directly related to the amount of direct savings that can by
made by using free software in state institutions. That is in any case a
marginal aggregate value, but in no way is it the chief focus of the Bill. The
basic principles which inspire the Bill are linked to the basic guarantees of a
state of law, such as:

Free access to public information by the citizen.
Permanence of public data.
Security of the State and citizens.

To guarantee the free access of citizens to public information, it is
indespensable that the encoding of data is not tied to a single provider. The
use of standard and open formats gives a guarantee of this free access, if
necessary through the creation of compatible free software.

To guarantee the permanence of public data, it is necessary that the usability
and maintenance of the software does not depend on the goodwill of the
suppliers, or on the monopoly conditions imposed by them. For this reason the
State needs systems the development of which can be guaranteed due to the
availability of the source code. 
===========================================

That letter seriously made me feel like packing my bags for Peru.
And Spanish is a _very_ easy language to learn too.
Here's the letter in Spanish:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org.pe/rescon.html">http://www.gnu.org.pe/rescon.html</A>
Here's the MS letter which provoked the Peruvian response.
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org.pe/carta1.html">http://www.gnu.org.pe/carta1.html</A>

Linux would rule the world if we had a Peruvian-style government in every 
country.

--------------------
So my short answer:
-	Linux cannot prevail on the basis of superior software concepts
	because the low-hanging fruit has been picked already.
	That's why linux is mostly clones and marginal improvements of
	the commercial products.
-	Open format laws are the only chance, but we will need changes
	of govts to achieve this. Or a million deaths....

Cheers,
ak.
