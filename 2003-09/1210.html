I just had reason to check my reject logs, because people have been
telling me that this latest Microsoft worm is generating lots of
messages. My conclusion is that rcpt-time block _really_ works. I
haven't even bothered to look at my anti-spam checks for months, but I 
am not vulnerable to the latest auto-spam doing the rounds. And my CPU
has been bumbling along near zero :-)

According to the logs I have rejected 400 messages containing the string
"microsoft.com" in the headers, out of 7000 rejected messages in total.
And not one of these messages cost me significant data, because I
dropped the message as soon as the sender was identified as bogus
(before the SMTP "DATA" command.)

RCPT-time checking is implemented in Exim in an ACL structure, ie you
put together a simple ACL statement along the lines of what you might do
in a Squid or Apache config file. There is also a milter for Sendmail
that will do something similar.

The two checks I do which stop huge amounts of spam are:

	1. Does "<A HREF="mailto:sender@senderdomain">sender@senderdomain</A>" positively not exist? Spammers
	still usually post from spoofed or otherwise unrepliable places.
	A callout starts an SMTP delivery but stops before the DATA
	statement, unless there was previously an error message (if
	there is an MTA at all, or an MX at all, etc.)

		==&gt; one line in a config file.

	2. Does "<A HREF="mailto:postmaster@senderdomain">postmaster@senderdomain</A>" positively not exist? Would
	you believe, neither spammers nor automated virus-generated
	addresses tend to survive this test because they don't tend
	to have properly-run domains :-)

		==&gt; one line in a config file.

This saves bandwidth and CPU. I simply don't have to process any of that
junk because it never crossed the border into my network.

After that, I push the surviving mail through Spam Assassin at DATA
time, before I accept the message into a queue. So if SA doesn't like it
I have paid for the bandwidth and the CPU, but at least it hasn't
clogged my spool areas (and in a site that runs Windows I would then
need to virusscan the messages, so SA saves that step at least.)

Exim is so far the only main MTA that has got this facility neatly
packaged by default. Postfix/qmail require source hacking as far as I
know and there is an addon for Sendmail that can do something similar,
but it isn't handled in any kind of integrated way. Interestingly there
has been a lot of discussion about covering this sort of checking
behaviour in the RFCs.

Wietse lead a discussion on the Postfix development list a while ago
exploring the cases in which callouts can cause problems, but I think
practical experience shows that it is a very effective tool with no
serious side-effects.

If Exim is out of your experience and you don't have time to investigate
it, consider putting it in as a skinny application proxy in front of
your existing mail gateway. It really isn't that hard and your users
will thank you for it!
