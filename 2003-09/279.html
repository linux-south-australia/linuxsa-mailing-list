&gt; Hello James,
&gt;
&gt; I have been thinking a bit more about this, and I guess rather than assume
&gt; or "idea_it" and just keep writing and writing, if one is really
concerned,
&gt; then I suppose we could try to adopt the next ideas in "pro-active"
mindset.
&gt; Example is, whenever I respond to my programer on glitches ( private
program
&gt; development), I don't just winge about it. In the end of my text, it's
&gt; finsied with a paragraph heading;
&gt; "Probable soultion" ........
&gt; And the solution could be rada rada.......? or !
&gt;
&gt; Even if it's not the solution, it gives the person in "control" :-), an
idea
&gt; of where I  am at, and therefore correct or use the suggestions.
&gt; This was taught to a classroom one day in tradeschool, that if we had a
&gt; question, have an answer, even if it's wrong. What could be worse than
&gt; "wrong" is to not have attemted to think what the answer might be.
&gt; It lessens the dilema of question questions questions, soner or later the
&gt; mind starts to roll through the logic, and presto, in many cases the
answer
&gt; is soon worked out. Not always, but I guess 50/50.
&gt; The next thing  may I suggest, is the expirienced Linux people, that DO
want
&gt; to help, is to have some sort knowledge or some idea on teaching. Again I
&gt; will use the example in trade school, many of the "teachers" there had to
&gt; have a degree AND expience in the world of motor mechanics ( it could be
&gt; carpentry, etc etc) plus to be able to teach, is do a small teaching
course.
&gt; However, correct me if I am wrong by all means.
&gt;
&gt; So, when I look at my situation, and try to look at what is the next step
&gt; after configuring the firewall ( I used smoothwall 1.0)
&gt; What now?
&gt; Well, I have been reading the posts, absorbing the replies for about a
week,
&gt; and have noticed the next thing that might be to get to know are the
&gt; commands. What do thay mean, why are they there, how does all this apply
to
&gt; me ???
&gt; Do I loose sleep over this ? NO WAY, I went and got myself a beer, watched
&gt; the football, and presto, after the footy, I types in google search,
"linux
&gt; comands tutorial"
&gt; There is a list of many ways to get to the next step. What I am looking
for
&gt; is a comparitive command list from MS DOS to Linux. For example, if I type
a
&gt; MS DOS shell, DIR/W ,then a list of directories appear. If I type in CD
&gt; &lt;name directory&gt; then it goes to that directory, and so on. What is the
same
&gt; in a Linux basis shell after boot-up?
&gt;
&gt; But that's me, others may be a different levels and past all this ,from a
&gt; newbies perspective I am sure there are some that can relate.

&gt; &gt; Hi Pete,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you for writing. I am going to try to explain why I think things
are
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; way they are, and hopefully in a very friendly way.  :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think your post was well thought out, and helped me form a framework
to
&gt; &gt; explain the situation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank You.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On Friday 05 September 2003 17:54, Pete shared:
&gt; &gt; &gt; This topic has merit. About 8 months ago when I started the first
&gt; serious
&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt in the Linux world, I started to ask questions newbies always
&gt; ask
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the forums. The response from some was apathy and the response form
&gt; &gt; &gt; other was helpfull, but the there was something missing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My experience exactly, until this yank stumbled accross Linuxsa.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;I still did not undertand what they all said. In one of my responses I
&gt; told
&gt; &gt; &gt; it like this:
&gt; &gt; &gt; If, you had a car and it needed a service or repairs, do you take it
to
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanic, or do you fix it yourself?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you take to a mechanic, all you want to do is pick the car up and
&gt; drive
&gt; &gt; &gt; it away, get to your destination and it could be work. If the car
broke
&gt; &gt; &gt; down again soon after it's repairs, what then? Do you learn to be a
&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanic right on the spot, or call the mechanic that fixed it, the
&gt; options
&gt; &gt; &gt; are many. But liken it with people that are encouraged by the old
school
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; expirieced Linux users, do you expect the newbie to know it all? Do
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; expieienced Linux community know everything about cars and how to
strip
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine apart? For me, I happen to be in the middle. I AM a qualified
&gt; motor
&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanic. When the workings of Linux system are explained to me, I
know
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's technicaly the same as motor car engine, but in program lingo,
yet
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; explanations,if I was to explain to a client, "madam, your car is
fixed,
&gt; &gt; &gt; here's how to fix next time yourself, with all due respect", and then
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain the finer deatils.
&gt; &gt; &gt; "emm, madam, the dwell angel is set a 43o, the timing is 6o BTDC,
&gt; remember
&gt; &gt; &gt; to set you tappets clearance for the inlet at 8 and the exhaust at 12,
&gt; &gt; &gt; unless you choose to convert to hydraulic lifters, there is no need to
&gt; &gt; &gt; adjust the valve clearance, and during the run in period, do  not go
&gt; over
&gt; &gt; &gt; 60 mph.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And finaly, " madam, when you can get back here next week, as part of
&gt; our
&gt; &gt; &gt; ongoing service, we will show you how to adjust your own breaks, so to
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; avoid a crash !"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are several reasons why the software is the way it is:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Firstly, we have to make our own cars. :) No company alone, except for
&gt; &gt; Microsoft, has the resources to build a car the way most people want it.
&gt; &gt; However, if a community is able to work as a group and partner together,
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; has a chance to build a car just like the one you want.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Secondly, the community is working together as a group to break
&gt; Microsoft's
&gt; &gt; monopoly, as we are the last hope to do so. We need everybody's help
&gt; because,
&gt; &gt; as you know, a lot of complicated issues go into enabling a driver to
&gt; merely
&gt; &gt; turn a key to start his car.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Collaboration helps pay for our car, but we need people to learn about
how
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; car works to help us.  Just like building a car, developing and
&gt; maintaining
&gt; &gt; an operating system, is a very complicated task, and our experience has
&gt; shown
&gt; &gt; us that it takes a certain amount of stubborness and curiosity to be an
&gt; &gt; effective helper.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In addition to collaboration, an understanding of the system allows
people
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; actively participate in the community by forming solutions to problems
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; arise, which makes the software more useful for everybody.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thirdly, we sometimes have to build our own pieces of the car, so we
have
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; leave certain parts of our projects unfinished such as not to prevent
&gt; other
&gt; &gt; parts of the car from being developed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But can you see my point? People just want to get in their cars, turn
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; key, and drive to work.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The same with an operating system especialy when the community is
trying
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; get something happening, please consider there ARE many that are just
&gt; sick
&gt; &gt; &gt; and tired of M$ way of manipulating the OS, they try a different
&gt; solution,
&gt; &gt; &gt; only to find the "mechanics" of the good solution expect everyomne
else
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; become a "mechanic" to !
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately,  we still have more work to do to get to that state, but
we
&gt; &gt; would very much like to have your help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I could engineer the installs, the layouts etc etc, it would be
just
&gt; &gt; &gt; that, turn the key, drive away and get to work, or play.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fortunately, I am in a good position to be in the middle of all this.
I
&gt; &gt; &gt; said recently I am new, but when I say "new", by that I mean I am
ready
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; strat my "aprenticeship" from the smorgasboard of the open scource
&gt; &gt; &gt; concept.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Welcome aboard!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; ((My actual motor mechanic days are over in a practical sense, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; by all means, ask me for advice on your own cars, I don't mind. Fix it
&gt; ya
&gt; &gt; &gt; self, the spare tyre is usualy in the boot, thats the rear end of some
&gt; &gt; &gt; cars.))
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's the least I can do for all the help many have given me so far.
&gt; &gt; &gt; What I will choose from the smorgasboard of open scource I have not
&gt; decided
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet, it's still a mess here and sorting out my pc's. BUT, I have
started
&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; read, and practice and ready to get my hands a bit dirty for a start.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to working with you.
&gt; &gt;
