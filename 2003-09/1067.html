&gt; &gt; i think there is also the issue of 60% of households in Adeliade can not get ADSL.
&gt; &gt; nearly 80% can get cable...
&gt; 
&gt; Adelaide.  Not Adeliade.
 
&gt; Nup.  Not 80% - Tel$tra stopped their roll out WAAAAY before that. 
&gt; There are huge areas of Adelaide uncabled.   I'd suspect you've got 
&gt; those figures arse about. 

Maybe the figures are population and not area coverage, cant remember now.
but cable was very well represented especially in poorer areas ... go figure.

&gt; Whereas ADSL has quite a penetration.  You can get ADSL in Mt Barker, but not Cable.
&gt; Heck, I'm 5km from the CBD and there ain't no cable here, but ADSL no worries.

there are parts of the CBD that cant get cable or ADSL...

&gt; &gt; if they can see the cable hanging in the street, then they can get get it...
&gt; &gt; much easier than the traumor[1] that ADSL can be.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm, for most ADSL much less trauma - just buy an ADSL CPE, filters and 
&gt; plug it in.
&gt; 
&gt; Cable internet usually involves a telstra tech.

yes but its a preceived thing. think about Joe [Public|Sixpack]. technical thugs
like those that hangout on LinuxSA prolly know more about ADSL tech than
most the store-bound Telstra sales folks... you want any info, go see the webpage.

for those that know Telstra techs, avoid Telstra techs. those that don't,
get sold on what they want to hear.

cheers,

Kim
