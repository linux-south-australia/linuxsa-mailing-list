 We have just become the 'help' guys for a community org
 trying to wire up their computer room. The room has 10 boxes
 running XP etc. The server is now running Mandrake 9.1.

 We have played around with the beast for days but just don't
 seem to be lucking on the right combo to get the darn thing
 online so the terminals can connect to the net when needed
 for training etc.

 Oh, we did have it online one day 2 weeks ago. It worked a
 treat and all the terminals picked up the net. The machine
 got shut down that night by a cleaner and we have had no
 luck connecting since then.

 It used to dial into the ISP and then sit there doing
 nothing. 16 packets in 3 minutes...you know the problem.

 Today we upgraded from Manduck 9.0 to 9.1. Now we cant even
 get a successful log in, all we get are validation errors.
 We suspect part of today's errors may be caused by the ISP
 (SENet) but they don't support Linux so we are in a
 desperate search for a soft part of the wall to bang our
 heads against unless we can get this beast online in the
 next few days.

 Any clues on what we should be doing/ using/ looking
 for/testing with etc?

 Oh, I should add that we have to put up with an infernal
 modem but a quick download corrected that incompatibility
 and it is now dialling fine, just getting nowhere fast...

 Ian
