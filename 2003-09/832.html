You neglect to add "and how much of it they are running". For light use
in the Microsoft-approved way a Windows server can indeed be stable.
Remember that Microsoft recommend (and teach their MSCEs) that there be
only one service per server. And that isn't just for extreme sites
(where it is a good idea no matter what OS) but for perfectly ordinary
ones with a few hundred users.

So ordinary companies -- I mean, companies with the usual sort of
infrastructure mix -- who report a reliable, multi-purpose Windows
server almost certainly have no room for an increase in load. And people
who report a reliable, reasonable-load Windows server most likely have
no options for adding to the range of services.

Finally, I should add that I believe a Windows server can be tuned and
tweaked and protected to perform fairly well. It takes a lot of money to
do so, and you can't just replicate the results simply, and frequently
you have to start again with a new service pack and always with a new
version of the OS, but it is possible. You can push an elephant through
a hosepipe if you chop the elephant into little pieces.  It is usually a
pretty stupid thing to want to do unless you can sell minced elephant.
Likewise there are companies who invest enormous amounts of money making
Windows relatively stable and buying large numbers of expensive servers
to make up for its relatively low efficiency, and writing short-lived
code to get around Windows design faults. These are the companies that
are brought out as success stories. 

Even more finally, there are certain applications that have been
developed on Windows that are extremely good at what they do and don't
have a neat equivalent on Linux. Don't disagree with me until you have
run Netstumber :-) So if you want that app then you might be willing to
things that otherwise look like a waste of money to do so.
