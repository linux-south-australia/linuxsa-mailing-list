But, perseverance and logic is the key !

Not in the dictionary,sorry.

&gt; Hi there...
&gt; 
&gt; I was going to let the LinuxSA people answer your question for you, but 
&gt; seeing as they're not being oparticularly useful or friendly,, I thought 
&gt; I'd see if there was anything I could do personally.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, did you say you were trying to get Smoothwall setup to act as a 
&gt; firewall/gateway ?
&gt; 
&gt; I've got some experience doing this, and would be happy to give you a 
&gt; hand with it, depending on your location.
&gt; 
&gt; Lemme know what suburb you're in, if ya still need a hand, and I'll work 
&gt; out if I can get there.  It's possible to give instructions over email, 
&gt; but I've found it's usually easier just to do it in person, cos that way 
&gt; questions can be answered on the spot, etc. etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Jason =)
