&gt; 
&gt; What the story?

<A HREF="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/msn.php">http://gaim.sourceforge.net/msn.php</A>

In a nutshell:

"
MS has decided that everyone should upgrade to MSN version 5.0 or
higher. MSN v5 is the first to use their MSN Protocol v8, which is the
first to use SSL for login. Now, we know how to login over this. This is
not hard, and we will be supporting MSNP9, the latest version of the
protocol, soon.

However, upgrading to this does not guarantee us anything. Whereas
previously, Microsoft has let third party clients connect, they now
require a license for doing so. They still encourage clients to connect
to their network, so with any luck, we can work something out. If not,
people may find a way to connect anyway, but the legalities of this are
pretty obvious. Key words: "Intellectual Property" and "DMCA."

We cannot give a yes or a no to the question, "Will Gaim continue to
work after October 15th?" (Which, btw, is the day that third party
clients not using MSNP8 or higher will be unable to connect). We will do
our best, but if it comes down to it, we will drop MSN support. If you
have a lot of friends on MSN, perhaps it's the time to migrate them. Get
them to install Gaim ;) Then they can continue to talk to their MSN
friends, but move to Jabber or another protocol.
"

Cheers,
Graham
