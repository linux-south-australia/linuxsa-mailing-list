I've never been a Slashdot fan at all in terms of the forums and users. The
artiles are usually quite good (with a heavy American bent) but most posters
there I simply can't stand to read what they say (luckily I can avoid it). I
mean, you do get sick of hearing from users how fabulous their OS is and how
crap everything else is and how idiotic everyone else is for not using what
they're using etc. I'm referring to those on most sides of the *.nix and
Micro$hizenhou$en fences, too. It's just tiresome watching people lob
insults at each other minus any real debate. And this, in fact, seems to
affect the atmosphere on the site in terms of progression beyond that sort
of thing and in fact, make ./ look like a real techsite turkey.

&gt; I wonder about Slashdot sometimes, and how relevant it is to Open 
&gt; Source.
Is
&gt; it still geeky to browse Slashdot? or under its current owners does 
&gt; mediocrity rule? A lot of Microsoft pundits seem to hang around the 
&gt; site,
that
&gt; cut its teeth on the techie, nurdy, alternative, not your average open 
&gt; source type.
&gt;
&gt; Certainly they admit to being America focussed. Hmmmm not sure.
&gt;
&gt; Are there other sites that do a similar job ?

I tend to think Slashdot has too many Linux/*insert Unix here*/ users,
judging by the amount of vitriol dished out to Microsoft on a regular basis
(and consistently modded up).  The site needs more balance and (gasp)
intelligent debate, but sometimes that appears to be above and beyond what a
reasonable proportion of slashdotters can muster.

In my opinion Slashdot has more than its fair share of the tin-foil-hat
brigade too.

Also there are too many people expecting something for nothing (be it
software, music or movies).  All sorts of creative excuses receive +5
Insightful.

Anyway, that's my /. rant ;-)
