Francesco,

Unfortunately I can't remove my 17 domain names from the clutches of Verisign
because I already moved them out a few years ago when they did a series of very
bad things. The final straw was when their scripts kept going in vicious
circles - effectively making it impossible for me to change any details at all
of my domain names. (I had to make a few costly phone calls to the US of A,
waiting ages in their robot queue and then getting totally hopeless naive
instructions.) It's just so sad that even though I use a different registrar,
Verisign still gets a cut of the action for each domain renewal fee.

At one stage, a few years ago, there was a mass exodus out of Network 
Solutions because of some very bad change they made. I don't recall right
now what that was. These people seem to really know how to annoy everyone!

By the way, when I tried a random URL like dsjfkdsflsa.com a few hours ago, I
couldn't get a web page up. I reckon their server would be saturated.  That is
_not_ good news though, because they can just enter in a couple of dozen
round-robin style IP addresses of paying advertisers and they're laughing!

CHeers,
ak.
