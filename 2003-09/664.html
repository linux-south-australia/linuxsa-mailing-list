&gt;&gt; No, this is a red herring.  It shows SCOs (and apparently your)

&gt;
&gt; You're missing the point.  SCO claim to have a contact with IBM that
&gt; assigns rights to UNIX derivations back to SCO.

I haven't missed that point.  I'll get back to it.  IIRC the part of
the message which you excised showed prior art.  Even if SCO's claims
were true (which I strongly doubt), they have nothing to do with the
matter at hand.

&gt; Do they have such a contract?

I'll bet you a slab of Coopers' they don't.

&gt; I don't know, and I'm pretty sure you don't, either.

Of course I don't.  This kind of contract is a private matter between
two companies.  Nobody else finds out about it unless it's revealed in
court.  But I'm pretty sure SCO doesn't, either.

&gt; SCO claimed to have a contract with Novel, which Novel claimed
&gt; didn't exist but SCO did have it and produced it, so at least some
&gt; of their claims are factual.  SCO claim the clause in the IBM
&gt; contract is standard in all of their contracts; if they're right it
&gt; may make work done by any such licensee unusable.

IBM is not Novell.  I can't imagine they would have ever entered into
such a contract.

In any case, all of this hinges on the definition of derivative works.
None of what we're talking about now could come close to being a
derivative work.  *ALL* multiprocessor work of any significance, and I
really mean *ALL*, has nothing to do with SCO.  That includes NUMA,
which SCO seems to see as something completely unrelated to SMP.
