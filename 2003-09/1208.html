<H1>Mandrake installation issue/Lindows</H1>

Had a few spare gig lying around so installed Mandrake 9.0 for the hell of 
it the other day. (for dual boot with NT)

The one error that came up on installation was on installation of 
libaudiofile0-0.2.3etc or something like that (have it written down elsewhere)

Anyone know what this is and if it is important? :)  (no, I am no expert, 
obviously)

Only other problem was with X.

install detected the graphics (S3 Trio 386) and the correct 
horizontal/vertical for the monitor (but not the type of monitor - LG 
Studioworks 775N)

However, any amount of screwing around with X config and XFdrake etc. would 
get it to work.  Score one for Lindows here - had one of this lightbulb 
things and thought - hey, Lindows had no problem with running - so booted 
that LindowsCD, saved the XFree 4 config file, copied it to Mandrake, and 
Bob's your uncle, so to speak.

Interestingly, Lindows used the S3Virge driver, not the exactly correct 
one.  Also lowered Horizontal rate to 50-61 rather than the actual full 
monitor spec one (which is quite a bit higher).

Lindows XConfig-4 gave vendor type unknown for monitor but called it a 
"75N" for reference, how important that is, good question.

Anyone else ever had a problem with this sort of monitor/Mandrake?

Richard
