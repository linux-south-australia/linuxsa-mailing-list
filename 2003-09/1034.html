Well that didn't happen for one reason or another, maybe Wednesday we 
can get there and beat this into submission.



BTW, trivia time for folks wondering just what this community centre is 
all about. 

Bagster Community House was the first Neighbourhood house of its kind 
in South Australia. Originally set up in 1979 it was located (cramped 
into) in a Housing Trust duplex until a few years ago. The new complex 
took in an underused church hall and now sports good community 
facilities including several meeting rooms, event hall, tool library, 
men's workroom (fitted with a Triton!), Op shop, well fitted kitchen 
and excellent childcare rooms. Final cost was around $900k. 

City of Salisbury pays for the Coordinator (@20 hours/week) and 
maintains the building and lands. Other than the Coordinator the 
management and operation of the building is entirely by volunteers. 

They would welcome visitors wanting to take a tour of the house and its 
facilities. 17 Bagster Road, Salisbury North. Their hours are Monday to 
Thursday 9 to 3. 

Cheers,  Ian
