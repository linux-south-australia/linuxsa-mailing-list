&gt; Parallel, or dependency start?  The one I'm thinking about is located
&gt; at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/&gt">http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/rgooch/linux/boot-scripts/&gt</A>;.

Ah, yes thats the one. I think he mentioned that you can start all of
the scripts in parallel, because they'll block if a service the script
needs isn't up yet, and its smart enough not to start the same service
twice. As Glen said you have to be kind of careful about how many you
start at once as it may slow things down.

&gt; kernel and utilities to boot, and as the init process was running
&gt; a background task could be validating memory and adding it the
&gt; kernel pool to be used.  Such an interface to the kernel could
&gt; also support switching off chunks of memory if they failed.  You
&gt; could then hot swap memory on systems that support it and re-enable
&gt; access without downtime.

Yep, hot-add memory is relatively easy. Removing is much harder,
though some OS's do it. Having several hundred disks can also really
slow down the Linux boot process as they're probed serially.
