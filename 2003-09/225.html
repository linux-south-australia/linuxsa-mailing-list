Quoting Alan Kennington &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ak1.linuxsa@topology.org">ak1.linuxsa@topology.org</A>&gt;:

&gt; Consider this example: AIDS drugs patents.
&gt; While millions of people died in poor countries, the rich countries
&gt; maintained that IP law required those millions of people to die
&gt; rather than reduce in any way the income to the companies which held
&gt; the patents. The governments and the companies were in agreement that
&gt; maintaining the monopolies of the drugs companies was essential - even
&gt; though
&gt; many of the drugs were actually developed through research by US govt
&gt; funded bodies rather than the drugs companies.

I'm not a pharmacologist, but you don't have to be one to work out that drugs
companies are only interested in developing technologies that they can hold
patents on. Just because someone holds a patent, it doesn't mean that it's the
only way to solve a problem. A doctor once told me something along the lines
of: only drugs that block or enhance receptors can be claimed as intellectual
property.

This means that many treatments that fall under the banner of 'alternative
medicine' may never get the development, testing and political lobbying that
big name drugs receive because no-one has the motivation to fund them. Does that
sound familiar?

On the other hand, millions are spent on testing and development because
people's well being is at stake (along laws and approval processes to match).
With software it's done whenever you feel like it, and I doubt there are any
laws worldwide specifying any kind of quality requirement beyond the usually
inapplicable 'fit for purpose' trade practices.

I don't think many western governments would be happy with you giving away your
homemade 'Aids Cure v0.9alpha' to the public if it has anything to do with
drugs manufacture.
