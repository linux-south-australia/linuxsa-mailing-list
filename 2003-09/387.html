In <A HREF="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/34007.htm,">http://www.linuxworld.com/story/34007.htm,</A> Darl McBride makes critical
comment on a flaw in the Open Source development model.  He says that,
"UNIX System V code (owned by SCO) is, in fact, in Linux, and it shouldn't
be there."  The source of this assertion is apparently, "Open Source
leader Bruce Perens," and goes on to say, "Mr Perens stated that there is
``an error in the Linux developer's process'' which allowed Unix System
V code that ``didn't belong in Linux'' to end up in the Linux kernel
(source: ComputerWire, August 25, 2003)."

These are serious matters, and it does us no good to ignore them.
Whether or not you approve of the concept of intellectual property, the
fact is that these are valid concerns under our current legal framework,
and while we can strive to change that framework, we cannot and must
not ignore or flout it.

I hold that we should fully embrace the framework.  All of the
disgruntlement and disdain expressed over software patents ignores that,
were the open source community to seek patents and licence them under
similar terms to the GPL, or say under reciprocal licences, then freedom
would be enhanced through yet another mechanism.

However, and to get back to the main point, and in the words of McBride,
"if the Open Source community wants to develop products for enterprise
corporations, it must respect and follow the rule of law."  This is
correct.  We ignore the law at our own peril.
