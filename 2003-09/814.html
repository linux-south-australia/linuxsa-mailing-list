&gt; I think what intrigued me about the article was the,
&gt; to my interpretation, implied necessity to boot daily,
&gt; or at least frequently.

pah! rebooting is overrated!

&gt; I personally have not noticed long boot times compared
&gt; to os's such as W2000.

i have a 386, 486, p200, P133P133 and a sparc ipx, 
so i try to reboot as little as possible as rebooting takes ages... 
i had a PDP11[1] once, that took nearly half an hour to boot, 
but that was from paper tape so i dont think that counts[2].

&gt; "bring the thermos, pinic lunch etc ... 
&gt; nothing like externally planned downtime."
&gt; sounds good to me!!

earlier this year i had to shutdown my whole server room, for
a planned building wide power outage to upgrade "the system".
im assuming power system, they didnt specify.

so i shut each server down in turn, waited, powered em all 
back up again. i took about two hours to bring everything up
one system at a time, large filesystems and all, that hadn't
been checked in almost six months. 
nothing worse than boucing a cold fusebox =(

cheers,

Kim
[1] it used to swap to tape, we made it swap to an eight 
    inch floppy and it faster =)
[2] just image loading win2k from paper tape =)
