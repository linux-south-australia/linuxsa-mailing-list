&gt; I must confess that I find it difficult to keep my eyes open when reading
&gt; the SCO/linux thing now. 

Gawd yes.  That letter was tedious.

 &gt; It has not been in SCO's interest to behave as they have.
&gt; So that's why another explanation must be sought. That letter is a lecture
&gt; direct from MS, apparently.

AK, I'd almost agree with you except that:

SCO don't quite seem to know what they want to do.  They are sueing/they 
aren't.  They are requiring people to have licenses/they aren't.  They 
seem all over the place.  They seem like amateurs in all this who're 
just bouncing around the place without clear sense of things.

If it really was MS behind this (and I'm not entirely convinced they 
don't have at least some hand in it) then I'd have thought the strategy 
would have been much better thought out.  Let's face MS really stands 
for Marketing Supremcy.
