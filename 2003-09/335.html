Damien,

I must confess that I find it difficult to keep my eyes open when reading
the SCO/linux thing now. However, I did stay awake through that little
item (now linked on slashdot too) just long enough to see something
interesting. The guy's attacking linux, not defending SCO. That might not
seem very important, but when you're dealing with bad people, the very first
thing you want to know is their motivation. 

Now if they were protecting or trying to benefit SCO, then surely they
would want linux to thrive so that they can parasitise it? If you had a patent
on, say, GIF files, you would want GIF files to thrive so that you can
get a cut of the action. You wouldn't go around saying that GIF files are
a heap of garbage. So if SCO wanted to make money from licensing, surely
they would say how wonderful linux is - and please send us a cut of the action.

The tone of the letter is like the most annoying right-wing fascist high
school teacher telling kids off. The message seems to be written by
MS staff, in my opinion. I say this not because other people have said
similar things, but because the statements don't seem to fit the stated
motivation of SCO. It has not been in SCO's interest to behave as they have.
So that's why another explanation must be sought. That letter is a lecture
direct from MS, apparently.

Just a thought....

Cheers,
ak.
