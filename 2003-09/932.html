&gt;&gt;&gt; So what I'm saying is that probably unix on the IBM-PC could not
&gt;&gt;&gt; have gotten off the ground until more like 1988 or so when the 386
&gt;&gt;&gt; system price started to become more affordable. (In 1988, in our
&gt;&gt;&gt; 100-person IT company, only very few top people had a 386. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; accountant was always complaining to me that his spreadsheets took
&gt;&gt;&gt; too long on the 286 with 640k RAM. But he couldn't make out the
&gt;&gt;&gt; "business case" to get a 386 just for himself.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I believe the earliest version was round 1984.  I've mislaid the copy
&gt;&gt; of UNIX Review which describes it, but note SCO's (exceptionally,
&gt;&gt; correct) claims to having UNIX on the PC in the early 80s.
&gt;
&gt; the second "Unix" i played with was Xenix on a 286... not sure
&gt; of the dates of the sotware, but it was an old and unloved
&gt; box of disks and books in 1990. the "unix family tree" puts
&gt; SCO Xenix in the running about 1982-3. must dig that up again.
&gt; but Xenix from then is a very different product to SCO Unix now.

Not nearly as different as it should be.  SCO UNIX is still very
strongly XENIX.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It would not have been in IBM's interest to develop hardware which
&gt;&gt;&gt; could run unix because it would have taken business away from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainframe surely.
&gt;&gt; That's not the way IBM works.  They didn't expect the PC to be even
&gt;&gt; that successful.  It was a last-ditch attempt to save the 5100 line.
&gt;
&gt; IBMs game was to extract (all the) money out of any market.
&gt;
&gt; the first unix i saw was called something like concurrent-unix
&gt; on a 286 in 1988, but that was a box that had been running since
&gt; 1984 or thereabouts... had about 30 users on serial dumb terminals.
&gt; it had no "console" of its own, all serial. paper tape and other
&gt; wyrd stuff.

Yup, that's the way UNIX machines were in those days.
