&gt; ok i have a question for you, by putting every thing on a seperate paration
&gt; is there any benifit, downside in doing this

There was a reason to use multiple filesystems 20 years ago or so, which
was that disks didn't come big enough to have just one.  There was also
some idea that you could gain performance advantages from having multiple
heads, the logic roughly being that head seek time is the slow part of
transfer, so multiple heads gives you extra probability that the head
is near what you want.  I don't believe that argument, and in fact Greg
Lehey recently explained that splitting a filesystem across multiple
spindles can decrease performance.

However you were asking about partitions, not about hard disks.  My take
is that one big partition is best.  Multiple filesystems wastes space:
you might have a lot of unused space across all filsystems, but still
not have enough in one place to install the new package you want.
With all the free space in one filesystem that won't happen.

Some people like to separate system files from user files, and if you
keep the system files on a read-only filesystem then that argument makes
good sense (I mean good sense aside from the obvious reason.)
