Neither do I.  So I sent them this message this morning.

Subject: SiteFinder: Non-compliance with Terms of Service

Verisign's new SiteFinder service features some Terms of Service, 
detailed at <A HREF="http://sitefinder.verisign.com/terms.jsp">http://sitefinder.verisign.com/terms.jsp</A> , and a Privacy
Policy, detailed at <A HREF="http://sitefinder.verisign.com/privacy.jsp">http://sitefinder.verisign.com/privacy.jsp</A>

I hereby inform you that I do not accept those terms of service or
the terms of the Privacy Policy.

According to the SiteFinder TOS, if I am "... dissatisified with any of
the... terms and conditions, our privacy policy, or other policies, [my]
sole remedy is to discontinue use of the Verisign services or our site."

As such, I wish to discontinue use of the Verisign services and your
site.

Since your site is presented to me without my consent whenever I perform
a DNS lookup for a non-existant name, and since my job as a Network
Engineer has a frequent requirement for me to perform said lookups, the
only way I can discontinue use of the Verisign servers and your site is
if you cease to present them to me.  Thus the onus is on you, not I, to
ensure that the "SOLE REMEDY" clause of your Terms of Service is upheld.

I therefore require you to make whatever configuration changes are
necessary to ensure that the wildcard A record for the .com and .net
DNS zones is no longer returned to me when I make DNS lookups for
non-existant names.  You can do that by causing the Verisign-controlled
gTLD servers to return EXDOMAIN instead of a wildcard-A record for
any queries originating from BGP AS4739.

Furthermore, this email should be construed as explicit notice that
I absolutely refuse to accept your privacy policy, and that I will 
view any and all attempts to collect, use, store or distribute information
about me, my Internet browsing habits, cookies, my misaddressed email, or
any other data pertaining to me whatsoever as a breach of the Australian
Commonwealth Privacy Act 2001, and that I am fully prepared to take
private civil legal action and/or action through the Commonwealth Privacy
Commissioner to ensure that Verisign, which is conducting business in 
Australia under Australian jurisdiction, meets its obligations under the
Act.

If you cannot personally act on this demand, I require you to escalate
it to someone who can.  I am recording details of correspondence for
the purpose of an evidentary trail if required, and it is in your best
interests to comply as soon as possible.

Yours Sincerely,

   - Mark Newton
