Brad,

&gt; I don't understand how this is any different to the way Internet
&gt; Explorer previously worked when it encountered a hostname that it
&gt; couldn't resolve. 

You agreed to that behaviour by purchasing Microsoft Windows or clicking on
an agreement when installing Internet Explorer.

&gt; It redirected the user to the NineMSN search page in &gt; effectively the
&gt; same way that Verisign is doing so (from the user's perspective).

*sigh*

&gt; I know, the implementation is markedly different and it only affected IE
&gt; users, but the end result is the same and IE makes up~92% of the browser
&gt; population.

You miss the point.

*I* don't agree to the terms and conditions and in a vain attempt to be a
law abiding citizen I have decided to inform them of this. Given the method
of implementation THEY are the only party who can fix this.

Alternatively, THEY can let me use Sitefinder under my own terms and
conditions (which will include a monthly deposit into my bank account).

Furthermore their implementation could easily be construed as an invasion of
privacy. See Mark Newton's post.

&gt; One could argue that MS were also using their might and
&gt; dominance to unfair advantage in wiring up their browser this way, so why
&gt; weren't MS sued in a similar fashion?  

Because the users agreed to purchasing I.E. I think Microsoft may be in
breach of various anti-trust legislations but that is not for me to decide.
