Or dirtier still, Slackware. :-)

I know it's been said but open source != free software. It just happens to
go that way. There's nothing which says that anything to do with Linux has
to be free.

Mind you, there IS tons of free software which is pretty good and you can
usually find a free alternative to commercial software which does the job,
I've found.

On another topic, I've been playing around with Vector Linux SOHO 3.2 (as a
few of you may be aware) and need the kernel sources for it to compile an
interface to get my NVIDIA drivers to work. Now, the kernel for VL SOHO
comes in two type; pent-ide and pent-SCSI. From what I can gather, these are
just optimised version of the 2.4.20 kernel. If I grab the source for that
one (on the front of a Linux Format DVD I have), that should do the job,
right?

Red Hat are certainly not freeloaders. They have contributed a lot of R&D to
linux. SuSe and Red Hat sometimes bundle commercial linux software with
their products for added value, hence the Professional label. This package
probably isn't appropriate for the average person.

Red Hat and SuSe are clearly looking more towards enterprise than hobbyists
these days.

If you want a desktop then there are Lindows or Mandrake or something like
that.

For a simple server you can look at something like e-smith.

If you want to get your hands dirty try debian ;-)

&gt;  
&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; Whilst still in the process of "migrating", there has been much much 
&gt; reading and getting ready for the day to install the OS, eventualy. I 
&gt; want to do install it right the first time and be aware of what else 
&gt; is around on the "smorgasboard" of choices. One of the postings shows 
&gt; places/shops which favours Linux/Open Scource etc, and I am now 
&gt; confused.
&gt;  
&gt; A "packaged" deal with the following details sells the OS. Can someone 
&gt; please explain to me, why this cost? I thought the OS was "free", or 
&gt; are these the "free_loaders" taking advantage of whatever there is to 
&gt; take advantage of ? I will certainly not pay this amount if we are 
&gt; told Linux is free OS software. ( understand there are CD costs etc)
&gt; With all due respect, I will make apologies if I cannot "see" something
&gt; here, but hey ! Can someome please explain to me, either on the post or
&gt; a personal reply will be ok, basicaly, why pay for this package at
&gt; $273.90-$249.95 ?
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
