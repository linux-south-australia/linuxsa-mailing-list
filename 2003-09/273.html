&gt;&gt; We Have Met the Enemy, and He is Us
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Abstracts:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [1] So what's the solution? How about adopting a single word-command 
&gt;&gt; – I suggest "install" to compile and set-up a package. This could be 
&gt;&gt; done through a Bash script.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; [2] Then the installation routine should launch a graphical 
&gt;&gt; configuration utility that will help you connect all the parts 
&gt;&gt; necessary to make the thing work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Finally, this installer will tell you where it put the damned 
&gt;&gt; executables. Some apps put the bits in /usr/local/. Others put them 
&gt;&gt; elsewhere. But there's little consistency on this point, and dammit, 
&gt;&gt; there needs to be a lot more. Windows may be the devil, but at least 
&gt;&gt; you can easily figure out where an application installs itself.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Lindows Gets It Right: Companies like Lindows have had some success 
&gt;&gt; leveraging Debian's apt-get to address these problems. Many Linux 
&gt;&gt; pros scoff at Lindows, calling it "Linux for the AOL set," but the 
&gt;&gt; company is actually making some headway.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Still, more work still needs to be done. It begins with a fairly 
&gt;&gt; simple definition: an application is NOT installed unless it works as 
&gt;&gt; advertised. And the installer should ensure that that all the 
&gt;&gt; dependent modules are installed and actually configured correctly. 
&gt;&gt; The whole thing should just work after the installation is done.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; We need 'Finishers'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; [3] The Linux community -- package developers, distribution makers 
&gt;&gt; and driver writers --need to understand that that theirs is a 
&gt;&gt; symbiotic relationship. They need each other to be successful.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not Dumbed Down, But Smartened Up: I'm not proposing that we dumb 
&gt;&gt; down Linux. I'm not proposing that we bury code behind some curtain 
&gt;&gt; that no one can see. I'm just asking that Linux application 
&gt;&gt; developers think their projects through from A to Z, with Z 
&gt;&gt; representing a polished product that installs successfully with 
&gt;&gt; minimal fuss.
&gt;&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; We're part-way there, but like many Linux packages themselves, the 
&gt;&gt; most sweat-equity goes into getting that last 10% right. If 
&gt;&gt; developers don't feel compelled to finish their applications, then we 
&gt;&gt; need a new group of developers – I'll call them "finishers" – to get 
&gt;&gt; the job done. [4]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I enjoy a good puzzle as much as the next guy, but that's what a 
&gt;&gt; Rubik's Cube is for (they're making a comeback, you know). My Rubik's 
&gt;&gt; Cube should be puzzling. My Linux application installation should 
&gt;&gt; just work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thoughts ?
&gt;
&gt; Some of mine are:
&gt;
&gt; [1] That's as silly as saying everyone should eat the same meal at 
&gt; breakfast, lunch and dinner...
&gt;
&gt; [2] I can hear it now...from the other room...
&gt;
&gt; [3] I try to test and document, I like that stuff...
&gt;
&gt; [4] Who's role should this be ? I think the users have an obligation 
&gt; to help create documentation, to honor the work of the programmers.

There are already gui interfaces available simplify compiling of software.
