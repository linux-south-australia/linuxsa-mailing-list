&gt; My opinion: If SCO are correct in their claims, which is by no means
&gt; certain, then they positively, absolutely must defend their rights.
&gt; Obviously I hope they are wrong, or that if they are right then the matter
&gt; can be resolved without damaging Open Source too badly, but I certainly
&gt; oppose intellectual theft just as strongly as I oppose physical theft.

Ok, let's assume that there is some code in the kernel which someone has
misappropriated at some point from SCOs intellectual property. Where does
everyone stand?

1) The offending code has to be removed as it is incompatible with the GPL.

2) Whoever submitted the code for inclusion violated SCOs IP and could
   therefore be chased for damages.


I don't think you could argue that SCOs attempt to wrest licence fees for
the Linux userbase is anything but absurd because:

a) We can't continue to use the infringing code.

b) We weren't the party that misappropriated the code.

I'm not sure how SCO sees the whole licencing issue panning out.


In my opinion SCO hasn't got a leg to stand on. There are doubts that there
is any infringing code, but even if it exists there are further doubts that
SCO owns all the IP it claims. Beyond that, their idea of "licencing" Linux
is absurd and they should only be aiming to recoup damages from the
infringing party (supposedly IBM).

This is the first time I've been out
In what feels like so long, I've been let down.
It feels like a landslide has taken a part of me out,
That I've never found
