&gt;I will post the letter in full for those who wish to just read it asap -
&gt;after all, Im sure its Open Source;)
&gt;(And yes, ive commented yet again at Newsforge. Its habit forming I
&gt;suspect).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dear Darl, 
&gt;
&gt;Thank you so much for your letter. 
&gt;
&gt;We are happy that you agree that customers need to know that Open Source
&gt;is legal and stable, and we heartily agree with that sentence of your
&gt;letter. The others don't seem to make as much sense, but we find the
&gt;dialogue refreshing.
&gt;
&gt;However, we have to sadly decline taking business model advice from a
&gt;company that seems to have squandered all its money (that it made off a
&gt;Linux IPO, I might add, since there's a nice bit of irony there), and
&gt;now seems to play the U.S. legal system as a lottery. We in the Open
&gt;Source group continue to believe in technology as a way of driving
&gt;customer interest and demand. 
&gt;
&gt;Also, we find your references to a negotiating table somewhat confusing,
&gt;since there doesn't seem to be anything to negotiate about. SCO has yet
&gt;to show any infringing IP in the Open Source domain, but we wait with
&gt;bated breath for when you will actually care to inform us about what you
&gt;are blathering about. 
&gt;
&gt;All of our source code is out in the open, and we welcome you to point
&gt;to any particular piece you might disagree with. 
&gt;
&gt;Until then, please accept our gratitude for your submission, 
&gt;
&gt;Yours truly, 
&gt;
&gt;Linus Torvalds
&gt;
That's Daryl deserves!

JL
