Hello,
Firstly, sorry if I am replying direct and not via the list, I'm  new on here and as I go I'll work how out to reply to the questions correctly.

The  irony with your questiuon, is the very similar reasons I am phasing out much that has anything to do with MS.
It may never be 100 % free of MS, maybe because the ULTRA Ettiquetes, who knows ?
:-))

However
I don't even use their free hotmail services anymore.

I have found  more safer and secure free email service providers, and no ads !

There are a few around, the 1 I use primarily is from:

https://SAFe-mail.net

the other one, but seems to work much slower is from:

https://ziplip.com


I just simply refuse to bend to Microsoft's ways of manipulationg how one should have THEIR "security settings" for the sake of the all mighty  advertising $$dollar$$. It's a PC;  ( PERSONAL COMPUTER ! )
Or is this too logical to understand ?

That is my perception, I may be silghtly off-key, but that's one avenue to follow, if the choice remains to keep haggling with settings, or phase away onto something else.

Thanks
============================================================

  I keep seeing messages from MSN Messenger telling me that I need a
  "Security Update" or I can't continue to access any MSN contacts.
  
  What the story?
 ============================================================
 <A HREF="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/msn.php">http://gaim.sourceforge.net/msn.php</A>
 
 In a nutshell:
 
 "
 MS has decided that everyone should upgrade to MSN version 5.0 or
 higher. MSN v5 is the first to use their MSN Protocol v8, which is the
 first to use SSL for login. Now, we know how to login over this. This is
 not hard, and we will be supporting MSNP9, the latest version of the
 protocol, soon.
 
 However, upgrading to this does not guarantee us anything. Whereas
 previously, Microsoft has let third party clients connect, they now
 require a license for doing so. They still encourage clients to connect
 to their network, so with any luck, we can work something out. If not,
 people may find a way to connect anyway, but the legalities of this are
 pretty obvious. Key words: "Intellectual Property" and "DMCA."
 
 We cannot give a yes or a no to the question, "Will Gaim continue to
 work after October 15th?" (Which, btw, is the day that third party
 clients not using MSNP8 or higher will be unable to connect). We will do
 our best, but if it comes down to it, we will drop MSN support. If you
 have a lot of friends on MSN, perhaps it's the time to migrate them. Get
 them to install Gaim ;) Then they can continue to talk to their MSN
 friends, but move to Jabber or another protocol.
 "
 
 Cheers,
 Graham

&gt; Sorry if this has been mentioned ( have not seen it so far) but I have
&gt; been out of the loop for several days thanks to a SoBig.F attack on my
&gt; XP Drive &lt;GGGRRRRR&gt; but working from my SuSE box with gAIM and Kopete
&gt; I keep seeing messages from MSN Messenger telling me that I need a
&gt; "Security Update" or I can't continue to access any MSN contacts.
&gt; 
&gt; What the story?
