&gt;&gt; Sounds like you may want to add Samba to your Smoothwall Linux box, 
&gt;&gt; so you can store the text file on the Samba/Smoothwall/Linux server. 
&gt;&gt; That way you can access it from the program.
&gt;

&gt; (Incidentally, please pardon my shocking grammar in this message - 
&gt; it's Friday afternoon and I'm in almost clinical need of a beer)

Linux, free as in beer! :-)

&gt; Err, no...  one of the reasons why Smoothwall's such a tidy little 
&gt; product is because it's virtually impenetrable, due to the fact there 
&gt; are no extra exploitable services running on it.
&gt;
&gt; I'd have thought that as a security appliance, it would be Bloody 
&gt; Silly to then include potentially sensitive data on that machine ?

He's just learning at home, but my mistake was that I couldn't find a 
graceful way to tell him that he might want to try out another 
distribution.... :-[

&gt; I've seen it happen a few times where someone says "Oh, you can just 
&gt; install {service X} on your Smoothwall", which of course isn't 
&gt; supported and it really isn't built for. 

Agreed.

&gt; The Smoothwall then gets compromised, and the person whose network it 
&gt; is/was tears their hair out in frustration, goes back to their linux 
&gt; guru friend and asks what to do next, and they inevitably say 
&gt; something like "Well you need to learn more about linux then", or 
&gt; "Hmm, I'm not really sure how Smoothwall works specifically".
&gt;
&gt; I would say NOT to install Samba on your smoothwall Pete, because at 
&gt; the present time it's working happily and doing its job, and is 
&gt; independant of the rest of your network.  By all means, put another PC 
&gt; on the network with linux on it, and fool around with that all you 
&gt; like...  and then if you do happen to bugger something up when trying 
&gt; to get samba working on it, your firewall won't be compromised, and 
&gt; you'll only have one machine to worry about fixing.
&gt;
&gt; Seriously, I reckon you should do some research before giving out 
&gt; advice like this - Smoothwall's meant to turn a PC into a firewall 
&gt; "appliance"...  just because it's linux based doesn't mean you should 
&gt; necessarily just tell everyone to treat it like any other linux box.
&gt;
&gt; Saying that Smoothwall CAN be modified to perform other linux tasks is 
&gt; like saying that it's possible to get sexual gratification from a 
&gt; vacuum cleaner - i.e. it's best not to bother unless you know exactly 
&gt; what you're doing, because you can almost bet that no one wants to 
&gt; know about it when things go wrong. 

LOL
