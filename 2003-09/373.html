Also fundamentally I never understood Moore to have made a Law, it was only
ever an observation with regard to transistor density. It turned out to be
useful for road maps. Also you should use MIPS as a metric rather than MHz,
as processing power has increased faster than clocking frequency.
Nonetheless  I don't know if it was ever expected to apply to consumer
prices. After all producers only improve efficiency because they wish to
tempt more money from customers. It is principally about greed not
technology. They are happy to give you more functionality(whether it is
needed or not), if you pay a little more. So no surprise that Moore's "Law"
does not apply to pricing. However it is still amazing how much you can get
for $2000 .

Mark,

I'm saying that from 1985 to now, Moore' law from then to now if 9 months
late
per 18 months. For every 18 months of those 18 years, the law has been 9
months
behind. But I'm sure you knew that....

Perhaps I could just comment also that: The future is not always the same as
the past. In the 1960's, people genuinely believed that we would be living
and
working on the Moon and Mars, and that we would have so much leisure because
of
robots that we would have serious difficulty working out what to do with all
our spare time. People talked about "educating for leisure". The problem was
that too many people just extrapolated past trends too far into the future,
like the recent tech bubble. Right now, I'd predict that manufacturers might
not bother much with going much faster on CPUs because the market might just
not be there. Already I've been reading that the average civilian is losing
interest in the Internet just as they did with the hoola hoop and the yoyo.
We
might be in a golden age without knowing it, just as the Apollo moon-landing
era was a golden age, not the beginning of mass migration to other planets -
not yet anyway. (Hmmm, I seem to have run out of coffee beans. I'd better
get
into my nuclear-powered car and get some at the local store. Or maybe I'll
just take my personal rocket and visit the orbital hypermarket....)

Cheers,
ak.
