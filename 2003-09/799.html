Brad,

Assuming that that is a genuine query, here are some possibilities:

1.	There's the question of free choice. Verisign are not letting
	anyone on the Internet opt out.

2.	The web (i.e. HTTP, FTP etc.) is not the only thing that the
	Internet is used for. The web is used for zillions of other
	services too, and the Verisign domain name wildcard affects
	absolutely all services, not just your web "experience".

3.	Domain name resolution failure is also used for purposes
	that are not related to locating services on the net. It is also
	used for diagnosing various faults - like during the set-up of
	a new domain, or modifying a domain. The Verisign rort mucks up
	all of that too.

4.	Monopoly considerations:  Verisign ahs the monopoly over the
	.net and .com domain name resolution (at the lowest level)
worldwide.
	People generally hate it when a private monopoly is abused in 
	this way. This would be a bit like Telstra being fully sold off
	and finding that every time you dial a wrong number, you get
	someone responding on the phone trying to sell you
penis-expanders
	- or perhaps something slightly more useful than that.

I'm sure that other people can give other categories of reasons why the
Verisign caper is a very bad thing.

CHeers,
ak.
