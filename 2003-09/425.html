&gt;What the hell is AD good for anyway[3]?

An AD environment is beneficial in an enterprise/corporate Windows 
network in that all network objects are managed/stored in a directory
structure, or tree structure if you talk NDS language.

Basically it's similar to what NDS was with Novell, several years
before MS came up with AD, awww, MS reinventing the wheel, who'd have
thought :)

The other benefit in an enterprise environment is the ability to use
group policies to manage your (&gt;Windows 2k) workstations.  Everything
from application rollouts, desktop lockdowns, software updates can be
managed at the server level.

For small business, AD is overkill, use Samba.  For larger businesses
with Windows workstations, AD should be considered at the very least,
based on the pros & cons.  Quite often the benefits won't outweigh the
costs, sometimes they will [1].


[1] I have to own up here and say that we don't operate AD here, but are
looking into it as an option, along with *nix/LDAP.  I know a number
of people who have implemented AD from the ground up and speak highly
of the end result, but not the process in between :)
