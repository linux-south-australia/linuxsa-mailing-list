&gt; Agreed.

It's about 99% threat and 1% opportunity, in my opinion.  You have to see it
from the total population point of view - population dynamics.

If DRM becomes a normal, or opt-out or opt-in practice on all documents,
and if MS sues anyone who publishes software which reads/writes such
"protected" documents, then the world will be split into two camps --
those who use the MS software, and those who use the OpenOffice/StarOffice
software which cannot do the same DRM as the MS software.

If you're in the MS camp, you get to read and write all files - including
reading everything produced by the non-MS camp. The non-MS users will have
the problem that non-MS has had up until now already -- the inability to
read stuff from others. (I currently receive regular e-mails from a
politically active group which largely hates MS and other such monopolies.
But every single one of them sends out e-mails containing MS-word attachments
which I can't read because my OpenOffice is only version 1.0.1. So even
MS-haters are firmly in the MS camp.)

Now look at the migration rates between the two populations.
The MS users will now be prevented from moving into the non-MS camp because
they will lose the ability to read stuff from the people they work with,
and from most of the people they socialise with. The non-MS camp will
be sorely tempted to go back to MS. 

When you divide the population into two, which has always been a major MS
objective -- to keep "loyality" (i.e. servility) amongst their customers
no matter what the other 5-10% do -- then the advantage goes very strongly
to the larger population. Therefore the DRM idea will be 10 or 20 times
worse for the non-MS people than for the MS people. 

Over the last couple of years, the non-MS people have (too) slowly worked
out how to exchange documents with the MS people, and now MS is taking the
very logical step of cutting that off, because file format compatibility
is the number 1 threat to the MS monopoly, not the prettiness or usability
or stability of the desktop. The real intellectual property in the IT world
is the sum total of all documents and databases which people create.
By locking those into MS software, the MS users can't escape.

That's why it was a major lost opportunity when the US govt tried
to break up MS instead of doing the really sensible thing and insisting
that all of MS's file formats and protocols should be published in full.
Now we have the crazy situation where reverse engineering MS file
formats and protocols will be actually _against_ the law, not
required by law. So the DMCA is very substantially reinforcing and
protecting a monopoly.

Looking more broadly, US-aligned govts in the last 10 years have
acted to sell of monopolies to private companies, bring in laws to
reinforce intellectual monopolies (patents, copyrights), and free up
markets so that big fish can eat little fish more easily, thereby
creating more monopolies. Seen against that background, linux is
going against the cultural and political trend in US-aligned countries
towards monopoly economics. I.e. We don't have a chance.....
MS will maintain its monopoly and linux will remain a little fish.

Cheers,
ak.
