Hi all,
Lately I have been trying to get any version of linux to run on the compaq
evo n800v that I have.
The problems I have under redhat 9 to mount the pcmica to compact flash
adaptor, I have to boot up as ROOT, any user just can not mount the
device.
I managied to get the acpi working well sort off , did have power charging
indication and the battery status.
Net work performance was very low, transferring large files or lots of
little ones it seems to have a problem, packets being dropied.
After spending a long time trying to get the video card to work under
opengl, well I never got it working correctly, redhat just would not allow
any accelleration, screen savers (waste of time) or even tux racier just
didnot work correctly.

After talking to a friend that is many levels higher in to linux than
myself, stated that when I had SuSe 8.2 on the laptop 90% of the problems
are fixied and work.
The problem I am having with SuSe at the moment is getting the acpi working.
Does anybody know how to fix this, I have tryied to complie kernals and
just keep getting errors.
Does any body know the way that the kernal is to be installied, I only
know how to get kernals working under lilo, suse 8.2 uses grub and this is
a little confusing to me.

normally I would do
/usr/src/linux
make xconfig

blar blar in the kernal stuff.

make dep&& make bzImage&& make modules&& make modules_install

this would normally do it

and then in a redhat machine make install which will do all the hard stuff.

now with suse 8.2 I just get a problem write permision error unable to
write to reiserfs.

What I am asking is for the correct way to fix my problems, getting the
kernal to work under suse is different.

Thanks

Paul
