&gt; Hi All,
&gt; I'm chasing a cable so that I can console into an old cisco router that 
&gt; I have picked up. Also chasing one of the COM port to RJ45 adapters for 
&gt; connecting to same router.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone recommend a vendor (in Adelaide) that sells these? I have 
&gt; tried both MIMP (referred me to Cisco) and the Cisco office. No luck so 
&gt; far.

The specs are

Parts:
   For cable assembly
     2 of RJ-45 unshielded plugs, suitable for category of cable
     &lt;15m of Category 3 or better stranded UTP cable
   For PC adapter assembly
     1 of 9 pin DB socket/RJ-45 socket adapter
     3 of machine socket pins for DB-series
     0.05m of Category 3 stranded patch wire (remove from phone patch cable)
Tools:
   RJ-45 crimper
   DB-series machined pin crimper


CABLE DESCRIPTION

A "rolled" RJ-45 patch lead.

These are used to connect from the DB-9/RJ-45 Adapter to a Cisco DCE,
such as a Console port.


CABLE ASSEMBLY
   A-end: RJ-45 plug
   B-end: RJ-45 plug

   A-end
  -------
   1 Grey
   2 Orange
   3 Black
   4 Red
   5 Green
   6 Yellow
   7 Blue
   8 Brown

   B-end
  -------
   1 Brown
   2 Blue
   3 Yellow
   4 Green
   5 Red
   6 Black
   7 Orange
   8 Grey

Simplest way to make this is to take a patch cable, cut
off one end.  Turn the new RJ-45 plug upside down (ie,
tab to top) and cable with the same colour order as the
old RJ-45 plug held right-side up (ie, pins facing you,
cable running away from you, tab to bottom, pins are
numbered 1 to 8 from right to left).


ADAPTER DESCRIPTION

The PC is a RS-232 "data terminal equipment".
The PC pinout on DB9 plug is

   Pin   RS-232 function
   ---   ---------------
    1    Data carrier detect (DCD)
    2    Receive data (RxD)
    3    Transmit data (TxD)
    4    Data terminal ready (DTR)
    5    Signal ground (SGnd)
    6    Data set ready (DSR)
    7    Ready to send (RTS)
    8    Clear to send (CTS)
    9    Ring indicator (RI)

The Cisco "Console" is a RS-232 "data communications equipment"
on a RJ-45 socket with pinout

   Pin  RS-232 DTE function
   ---  -------------------
    1   not connected
    2   DTR
    3   TxD
    4   TxSGnd
    5   RxSGnd
    6   RxD
    7   DSR
    8   not connected

Note that the actual assignments are "reversed", as the Console
is a DCE but RS-232 signals are always desribed from the DTE's
point of view.

This trick allows
  - DCE-DTE (Console-PC) insterconnection using a "rolled" cable
  - DTE-DTE (Async-PC) interconnection using a "patch" cable

The Cisco "Auxillary" is a RS-232 "data terminal equipment"
on a RJ-45 socket with pinout

   Pin  RS-232 DTE function
   ---  -------------------
    1   RTS
    2   DTR
    3   TxD
    4   TxSGnd
    5   RxSGnd
    6   RxD
    7   DSR
    8   CTS

Note that the Console port does not have hadnshaking
(as console messages should go to the bit bucket)
but the Auxillary port does have handshaking (as
it is designed to connect a modem).

The Console port is configured at clean system start
for 9600bps, 8 data bits, no parity, 2 stop bits.
The Auxillary port is not configured at clean system
start.

Note: connecting to the Console port implies that
large cut-and-paste of router configs fails. Connecting
to the Aux port implies no connectivity if configuration
clears.

Colour wire to RJ-45 pin assignment on the adapter is

   Pin   Wire colour
   ---   -----------
    1    Blue
    2    Orange
    3    Black
    4    Red
    5    Green
    6    Yellow
    7    Brown
    8    White

The adapter has wiring

  IBM PC/AT COM  Cisco DTE (or DCE via rolled cable)
   DB-9 socket        RJ-45 socket

    RTS 7----------blue---1 CTS

    DTR 4----------orange-2 DCD

    TxD 3----------black--3 RxD

   SGnd 5-------+--red----4 RxSGnd
                |
                +--green--5 TxSGnd

    RxD 2----------yellow-6 TxD

    DCD 1--+-------brown--7 DTR
           |
    DSR 6--+

    CTS 8----------white--8 RTS

     RI 9-- not connected

"Cisco DTE" are Auxillary port and Async ports of Cisco 2511.
These can use a standard "patch" cable.

"Cisco DCE" is Console port.  These use the "rolled" cable
described above.


ADAPTER ASSEMBLY

Remove pins from Red and Green.  Crimp socket pin #1 to Red and
Green, joining the wires at the pin.

Crimp socket pin #2 to jumper wire.

Remove pin from Brown. Crimp socket pin #3 to jumper wire
and Brown, joining the wires at the pin.

Insert pins into DB-9 socket following diagram above.

Insert DB9 socket into adapter chassis.


NOTE

All of this is derived from public Cisco-published documentation.
No reverse-engineering or inspection of Cisco parts was
involved.  (So, I.P-wise, go for it).
