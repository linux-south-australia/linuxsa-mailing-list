&gt; &gt; Well I hope I haven't been too vague but I'd like to know if ADSL is
&gt; &gt; for me or if SDSL is for me on that problem alone.  I understand the
&gt; &gt; basic differences between the two.  If I can download all 6 at the
&gt; &gt; same time faster than 1 at a time then I'd go with ADSL, but if not
&gt; &gt; then I'd have to go with SDSL.  Any thoughts on this?
&gt; 
&gt; i think the real issue is "what is your upstream / downstream ratio?"
&gt; ie. are you a content consumer, content provider or both?

It's like this.  1500 down 256 up.  I don't want to go to some website
and start downloading a file expecting to get 1500 when all I would
really get is 256 because TCP would rate limit me(flow control) because
of mp upload speed.  This is just my preference and I guess if it
doesn't do that then I am more than happy to go with ADSL but if TCP
does do that then barring the cost go with SDSL.  I do understand about
all the myriad of things that can go on between me and this website but
in theory if that site and myself had unhampered bandwidth then I want
1500 down and 256 up, and I don't want TCP to control my connection to
256/256.  I don't know if it works like I want it too but that is what I
want.  Does that make more sense now?  Is it possible to get 1500/256
not 256/256?  I do serve things but that is purely not the issue here.
