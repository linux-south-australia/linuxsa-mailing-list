VeriSign sued over redirect
Anick Jesdanun
SEPTEMBER 23, 2003

VERISIGN'S service to redirect web surfers who mistype addresses has become
the subject of a $US100 million ($147 million) antitrust lawsuit filed by a
rival.

The US federal lawsuit was the latest attack on the Site Finder offering
from VeriSign, a company that directs much of the internet's traffic through
its control of directories for two of the most popular domains, ".com" and
".net."
Popular Enterprises, which has a similar service it says got superseded by
Site Finder, said it was losing revenue from directing traffic to web sites
that pay for search listings.

A spokesman for VeriSign said the company would not comment on pending
litigation, filed in the US District Court in Florida.

VeriSign has defended the service it launched Monday, saying it gave
internet users help finding what they were hunting instead of a generic
error message. The company estimates that people mistype ".com" and ".net"
names some 20 million times daily.

Now, when someone types a ".com" or ".net" address for which no web site
exists, VeriSign's directories pass on the request to Site Finder, which
returns a list of likely alternatives. A search box is also provided, and
VeriSign gets unspecified revenues for its use.

"As the emotion and the fiction passes away, the reality we'll all be left
with is: You'll be getting to where you're looking for quicker," VeriSign
spokesman Brian O'Shaughnessy said.

Critics complain that the new service gives a private company too much
control over online commerce and lets it profit from an essential monopoly
over ".com" and ".net" names. They say the service could disrupt internet
standards and rival services.

VeriSign's Site Finder is similar to the referrals offered to users of
America Online, the Internet Explorer browser from Microsoft and the free
SmartBrowse toolbar from Popular.

What is different is VeriSign's status as master-keeper of ".com" and ".net"
directories. In that position, it can intercept mistyped addresses before
services from AOL, Microsoft or Popular kick in.

"Site Finder has completely stopped our core functionality," said Robert
Hart, Popular's marketing director. "It has taken away well over half of the
revenue that's generated from the applications. It's making our distribution
of our toolbar hard to justify."

Mr Hart, who refused to disclose the company's revenue, said SmartBrowse has
1.4 million users, a base that grows by thousands daily.

Site Finder does not affect referrals that Popular gets when internet users
type misspellings already registered by the company. Many companies seek to
capture traffic by registering common misspellings of popular sites.

Although the lawsuit does not specify an amount, company officials estimated
damages at $US100 million. The lawsuit also seeks an injunction against
VeriSign, which Popular accuses of antitrust violations and unfair
competition.

Earlier this week, the creators of software used to run most internet
directories distributed an optional update for network operators to
neutralise Site Finder and return users to an error message or other
service. However, the update does not restore all such services.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), which
oversees domain names, has asked a committee to review VeriSign's actions,
chairman Vint Cerf said. He also asked VeriSign to suspend the service
pending review by technical experts.

Mr O'Shaughnessy said VeriSign has been in touch with both ICANN and the US
Department of Commerce, which has ultimate oversight over the internet's
core.

VeriSign already has partly responded to some of the complaints. Mr
O'Shaughnessy said the company was seeking recommendations on adjusting its
service to accommodate junk email filters that had depended on the error
messages to work properly.
