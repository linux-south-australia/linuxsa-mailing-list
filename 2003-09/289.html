Ian,

I might have just had good luck with E-Smith so far but both internal
modems I have used worked straight up. One was a Discovery PCI hardware
(obviously) modem and the other an ISA Rockwell based modem that also
presented no problems. I can only suggest you try a test installation
with a spare hard disk drive using E-Smith and see how you go.

&gt; We were very tempted but they asked for and got Manduck.
&gt; Not our decision but boy were we tempted to do it anyway.
&gt; Biggest prob could have been recognising the infernal modem &lt;sigh&gt;
