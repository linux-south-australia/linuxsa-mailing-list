&gt;&gt;YOUR USE OF THE VERISIGN SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. IF YOU ARE 
&gt;&gt;DISSATISFIED WITH ANY OF THE MATERIALS, RESULTS OR OTHER CONTENTS OF THE 
&gt;&gt;VERISIGN SERVICES OR WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR PRIVACY

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But I refuse to accept their terms and conditions. It's not lawful to force
&gt; someone to accept these terms and conditions when that someone has not
&gt; requested such a service. I don't agree with *any* of their terms and
&gt; conditions.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't agree with it *at all*.
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, I have asked them to take it down. The alternative is that they
&gt; come up with a set of terms and conditions that I will agree to, however I
&gt; doubt they'd accept the terms and conditions that I would _propose_ to them.

Whether or not you accept their terms and conditions is not in dispute - 
obviously you don't. What I'm asking is, is there an easy way you could 
opt out at your end, rather than requiring them to stop providing the 
service to you?

The question I asked about removing them from your hints file was 
directed at stopping it at your end, not theirs. Because, really, they 
are providing a service to you by providing a root name server; i would 
have thought if you don't want to accept their service, simply don't use 
it. the thing is, i'm not DNS-competent enough to know if that is even 
possible. given that none of the gurus have come up with this solution, 
i'm guessing it's probably not possible.

just for reference, i am on your side; this seems like a textbook 
abuse-of-monopoly case, ethically if not legally. it's a very slimy move 
by verisign. i'm just playing devil's advocate.
