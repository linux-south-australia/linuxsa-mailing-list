 David, read and work through the responses and you will see
 that much of Darl's diatribe has been refuted.

 You will find that the kernel maintainers follow strict
 control standards before allowing code to be included. You
 will find that following the law is the practise not just
 the creed of Linux developers. It is all out in the open so
 any copying or wrongful use is going to be found out. Closed
 source on the other hand has a very black past because once
 locked up nobody has any idea what has been cobbled together
 and where the bits have all come from.

 What you also might read is that Darl and his cronies in SCO
 are not standing in the clear as far as the law goes. They
 are simply mouthing buzz words in the hope that other
 equally ill-informed folk might believe them.

 Please don't fall for the trap that Darl has anything of
 value to tell the OpenSource community. He doesn't have a
 clue nor do his claims have anything other than a certain
 curiosity value.

 Lets just look at your opening sentence. Instead of quoting
 from Darl's mis-truths, do like many others have done and find
 the facts. Linux did have a right to use the code. The code
 was legally there. It didn't belong for reasons other than
 legality. Darl did a snow job on that point. 

 Darl and SCO are not following the law, they are gambling
 that they can bluff a court to let them get away with their
 blackmail. Lets hope that the court becomes informed enough
 to see through the smokescreen on the manipulation and lies
 that so far make up the SCO case.

 As Linus says
 (and I will take his word before anything that Darl might say),
 
 "SCO has yet to show any infringing IP in the Open Source
 domain, but we wait with bated breath for when you will
 actually care to inform us about what you are blathering about. 

 All of our source code is out in the open, and we welcome
 you to point to any particular piece you might disagree with.
 "

Cheers,  Ian
