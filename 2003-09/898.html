&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;   I am a Linux newbie so be nice ;-)
&gt; 
&gt;   We are looking at doing a full migration to Linux from Microsoft's
&gt; Windows XP. Over the years we have briefly looked at different
&gt; distributions from Mandrake, Corel & Caldera. What we want to do now
&gt; is completely switch over to Linux permanently without the dual-boot
&gt; safety net that has seen us return to Microsoft on so many occasions
&gt; in the past. What I need to do prior to the migration is enusre that
&gt; certain areas of software are covered by reliable, stable Linux apps.
&gt; We already have some areas of software covered (for instance Open
&gt; Office instead of Office XP, Konqueror instead of IE6 and one of many
&gt; different e-mail handlers instead of outlook express).
&gt; 
&gt;   Is there a Linux equivalent of Microsoft Outlook? We use the
&gt; calendar & task features of it for booking appointments. One other
&gt; area we need to address is our accounting package. Currently we use
&gt; Intuit's Quickbooks Pro. If there is some form of Linux app that can
&gt; do this job of bookkeeping including GST tracking? If so then let the
&gt; migration begin ;-)
&gt; 
&gt;   Thankyou to all who have taken time to read this message and bigger
&gt; thanks in advance to those who post any helpful hints or suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt;   Andy.

As others already have answered all your questions, I merely wish to add
that the latest Redhat 9.0 has all of those "replacement" apps mentioned
and they will all work straight out of the box and should be relatively
painless to learn to use. Redhat is also a rather good choice for
newcomers to the linux operating system.

Welcome to the wonderful world of linux!  :)

Alex
