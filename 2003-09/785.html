I don't understand how this is any different to the way Internet
Explorer previously worked when it encountered a hostname that it
couldn't resolve.  It redirected the user to the NineMSN search  page in
effectively the same way that Verisign is doing so (from the user's
perspective). I know, the implementation is markedly different and it
only affected IE users, but the end result is the same and IE makes up
~92% of the browser population.  One could argue that MS were also using
their might and dominance to unfair advantage in wiring up their browser
this way, so why weren't MS sued in a similar fashion?  

BTW I'm not arguing, just throwing some more fuel in  :)

Looks like you weren't the only one who disagreed with Sitefinder,

Under your terms and conditions you state:

 * <A HREF="http://sitefinder.verisign.com/terms.jsp">http://sitefinder.verisign.com/terms.jsp</A>

---
#  GOVERNING LAW.
You and VeriSign agree that these Terms of Use and any disputes
hereunder including disputes related to the VeriSign Services shall be
governed in all respects by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the Commonwealth of Virginia, United States of America, excluding its
conflict of laws rules. You and we each agree to submit to exclusive
subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction and venue of the
courts of Fairfax County, FairFax, Virginia for any disputes between us
under or arising out of this Agreement. The parties hereby waive any
right to jury trial with respect to any action brought in connection
with these Terms of Use or the VeriSign Services.
---

I DO NOT AGREE to these terms and conditions.

I REFUSE to waive the right to jury trial with respect to any action
brought in connection with these Terms of Use or the VeriSign Services.

Given that you have enabled a wildcard DNS record for the.com domain(and
possibly the.net domain) and I cannot guarantee that I will never
mistype a domain name I hereby request that YOU terminate this agreement
and take whatever measures necessary to NOT SHOW ME the SiteFinder
service.

PLEASE TAKE NOTE:

IF YOU CONTINUE TO REDIRECT ANY MISTYPED DOMAINS THAT YOU HAVE UNDER
YOUR DELEGATED CONTROL THEN *YOU* AGREE THAT THE GOVERNING LAW IS THE
AUSTRALIAN LAW AND THAT ANY DISPUTES WILL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA.

ALSO I RESERVE THE RIGHT, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO JURY
TRIEL TO ANY ACTION BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE
VERSISIGN SERVICES.

I REFUSE TO ENTER INTO ANY CONTRACT WITH YOU AND YOU MAY NOT FORCE ME TO
ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH YOU.
