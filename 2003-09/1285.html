&gt; i've had a little theory for a while about input devices and the

&gt; this will get some flameage, but: in the mass market, there are two 
&gt; producers of high-volume, good quality input devices - microsoft and 
&gt; logitech. there are plenty of other manufacturers in the retail channel, 
&gt; but these two (seem to, in my experience) hold the good-quality-retail 
&gt; market. how many of us are using MS mice and/or keyboards now?

here's some flamage :-)

MS and Logitech trackballs are all for right-handed-only use (Hey
guys, do you REALLY want to throw away 10% of the market?)

NOBODY makes a good keyboard these days, since IBM clicky keyboards
went out of production (one of my favourite rants).

&gt; microsoft, it is assumed, will not in the reasonably foreseeable future 
&gt; be producing linux drivers for any of their hardware, potential company 
&gt; break-up notwithstanding.

Several people have said "this doesn't matter because keyboards and
mice don't need drivers". This is true of the standard PS/2 versions,
but will it continue to be true of newer USB devices? Using as complex
an interface as USB for as dumb a device as a keyboard or mouse is
completely dead and chewed in my opinion, but that doesn't stop them
doing it, and it tends to open the door to greater complexity in the
device as you have to put a more powerful microcontroller in it to
handle the USB. I would not be surprised to see in a few years' time
that many simple input devices won't work without a driver.
