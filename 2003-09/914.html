I' doing the same "trip", been at it for a couple of weeks. This is  good
place as as any to start, I suppose.
:-)
However, I am going thru logistics here like you would not believe, but
before I started to make any move, I read and ask questions and testing out
various applications.
Good on em with openoffice.org, if it were not for that, I still probably be
searching for another alternative.
Now I am in the process of checking if there is need for anti-virus software
on a RedHat install.  Why am I choosing RH ? I don't realy know but it will
do. Then comes the networking, physical aspect with cables, configuring and
just doing it. Nose bleeds, boots and all, here we come. But there is a
level of nettitket I have found to be of use to, :-)
Trust me.

Good luck fellow "migrants"

Subject: Linux newbie looking to migrate to this OS...


Hi everyone,

  I am a Linux newbie so be nice ;-)

  We are looking at doing a full migration to Linux from Microsoft's Windows
XP. Over the years we have briefly looked at different distributions from
Mandrake, Corel & Caldera. What we want to do now is completely switch over
to Linux permanently without the dual-boot safety net that has seen us
return to Microsoft on so many occasions in the past. What I need to do
prior to the migration is enusre that certain areas of software are covered
by reliable, stable Linux apps. We already have some areas of software
covered (for instance Open Office instead of Office XP, Konqueror instead of
IE6 and one of many different e-mail handlers instead of outlook express).

  Is there a Linux equivalent of Microsoft Outlook? We use the calendar &
task features of it for booking appointments. One other area we need to
address is our accounting package. Currently we use Intuit's Quickbooks Pro.
If there is some form of Linux app that can do this job of bookkeeping
including GST tracking? If so then let the migration begin ;-)

  Thankyou to all who have taken time to read this message and bigger thanks
in advance to those who post any helpful hints or suggestions.

  Andy.
