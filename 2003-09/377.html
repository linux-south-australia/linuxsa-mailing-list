[Combining a few messages, I don't want to spend all day on this]

&gt; The idea of modifying TCP stacks so as to increase end-to-end bitrate from 10
&gt; Mbps to 100 Mbps sounds somewhat bizarre to me.  That sounds fine if there is
&gt; only one user on the net. But suppose everyone on the net wants to use their
&gt; 100 Mbps. Now you have a network which is so congested that you're back to
&gt; where you started from, with the difference that the inequality between
&gt; privileged users and ordinary users is much increased.

If you read the Web100 web site at <A HREF="http://www.web100.org/">http://www.web100.org/</A> you
see that the Web100 Project retains the "fairness" goal of
TCP.  Web100 technologies are designed for wide deployment
in the academic and commercial internet.  It's the very
opposite of "...a kind of technical exercise, improving things
for a small number of users...".

It's actually more likely that non-Web100 IP implementations
will be unfair to Web100-tuned stacks.  If you've got a TB to
shift and you're only getting 30Mbps on a 100Mbps path then
that user will in all likelyhood cut the file into parts and
open multiple connections.  The Web100 user will use a single
100Mbps connection and thus be penalised by most router
queuing mechanisms.

There is a related project, Net100, which discards fairness.
The sponsors of that project run "mission-centric" networks
where unfairness is fine (eg: if the data coming from the space
probe is unfair to PoepleSoft users, then who gives a stuff as
the network was built primarily to support space activities).

Your concerns would be much better applied to Voice and Video
traffic.  This UDP traffic, unlike TCP or Web100-tuned TCP,
does not implement congestion control.  So it is unfair to
TCP traffic.  Voice isn't a huge concern, as the bandwidths
are small.  But we've already experienced episodes of video
streams denying service to TCP traffic.  It's concerning
that these applications have moved from experimental
systems into deployment in Microsoft operating systems
without the protocols being made TCP friendly.

&gt; On the face of it, unless you can tell me something
&gt; contrary, it looks like Web100 will clobber VoIP.

It's the other way around.  VoIP traffic doesn't
have congestion control and clobbers TCP traffic
(regardless if it is Web100-tuned or not).

&gt; A kludge-fix could be to split TCP and UDP into separate
&gt; FIFOs and do them round robin or some such fair queueing
&gt; idea. But that would be too simple.

I think a better idea is at
  <A HREF="http://www.aarnet.edu.au/engineering/networkdesign/qos/">http://www.aarnet.edu.au/engineering/networkdesign/qos/</A>
(this is still a discussion-based site at the moment, a
formal freeze of the AARNet3 QoS offering will occur in a
few weeks).

By getting members to mark TCP-unfriendly video traffic at
source we can offer video a higher level of service compared
to best effort but a worse level of service when the traffic
starts to threaten congestion-controlled traffic.

The technologies are DiffServ and Class Based Queuing.  Both
have been around for a while and now have sufficient deployment
to give them a burl.

&gt; I would like to suggest (perhaps a little provocatively, but in all seriousness)
&gt; that tuning up TCP stacks to do 100 Mbps on the open Internet is about as
&gt; socially responsible as optimising spam software to send 10 times faster.

Actually, spam won't be sent faster :-)  One of the points in
my talk is that application protocols need to be redesigned to
avoid unnecessary round-trips.  SMTP has too many query/response
transactions to allow a lot of short messages to be sent at
anywhere near line rate.

Some other points:

&gt; Specifically, I would call network queueing fair if, for example,
&gt; all traffic in network nodes was queued with a separate FIFO (real
&gt; or virtual) for each IP host source/destination pair, with round
&gt; robin (per-byte, not per-packet) service for all FIFOs.

That definition fails for multi-user machines.  Fairness
considers competing connections (or "flows").  Queuing
is "fair" if the lower bound on egress bandwidth for
each flow is proportional to the number of flows.
Achieving that doesn't require per-flow queues if you
are willing to have a statistically-defined lower
bound (ie, fine if the link has &gt;20 flows).

&gt; I've read from time to time that Cisco do do some sorts
&gt; of attempts at application-level classification and fair
&gt; queueing -- in fact, I think they've got big heaps of patents
&gt; on their own proprietary queueing algorithms.

Classification and queuing are different functions.  Usually
when you classify something it's because you intend to apply
horribly unfair queuing to it (eg, classify VoIP to place it
in a priority queue, or classify some likely denial of service
traffic to place it in a bit-bucket).  Then you fairly queue
the remaining traffic.

Cisco thought long and hard about it's patent policy.  The
outcome is surprisingly good.  From their web site:

  Does Cisco use its patents as a source of revenue? 

  Robert Barr: Cisco makes money by selling products
  and services, not by licensing its patents. We use
  our patents to support and protect our business, not
  as a business in itself.

  Does Cisco encourage the incorporation of its patents
  into Industry Standards?

  Robert Barr: Cisco is in a unique position because so
  many of our inventions apply to networking interoperability.
  Customers want interoperability between network products.
  We support the standards-setting processes of the IEEE, ITU,
  IETF and other standards organizations and consortiums and we
  are gratified that our intellectual property is used in many
  industry standards. While Cisco reserves the right to use its
  patents defensively if necessary, we do not demand royalties
  for patents that are used in industry standards.

This makes Cisco amazingly easy for people like myself to
deal with.
