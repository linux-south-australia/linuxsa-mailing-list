Hi.

Senet. Search the archives and recommend a proper and competant ISP. In
SA, that's Internode or Adam IMO.

Make sure the username for authentication with senet is
&lt;username&gt;@senet.com.au, not just &lt;username&gt;. They do this because
MCI/OzEmail who own senet and are slowly killing it need to be able to
figure out which network this user _was_ connected to so they can
retrieve the auth details etc.

Talking to the helpdesk is very painful unless you are very patient. The
tech department has a MINIMUM 4 hour response time for urgent problems.
I have never had a problem fixed inside 4 hours, and the record is
nearly a month.

Good luck, you'll need it :)

Michael

&gt; Yep, PAP and CHAP. Checked them out.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Log onto the site with another working PC that does "dial 
&gt; &gt; up" to confirm that it will work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Just to the end of the day we tried that with a Windoze 
&gt; machine. No connection. We suspect that we may actually have a 
&gt; working config, just that SENet had a failure in their 
&gt; verification.
&gt; 
&gt; We tried to ring their helpless desk. Were on for over 15 
&gt; minutes, got a dial tone which meant we should be connected to 
&gt; a worker drone. No such luck. Line dropped out after 4 rings.
&gt; 
&gt; Good time as any to go home &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; You are absolutely shure about your username and 
&gt; &gt; password, and that your account has time on it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Yep, double checked that earlier on in the day.
&gt; Confirmed all the DNS, etc stuff too.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
