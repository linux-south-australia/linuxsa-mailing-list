&gt; I have an IDE cdrom (/dev/hdc) and a soundblaster cdrom running on the
&gt; soundblaster card IDE port (/dev/sbpcd). I have both running happily in the
&gt; same machine, one for data cds, and one for audio cds.
&gt; 
&gt; Both cdroms work fine for both data discs and audio discs, even in X.
X doesn't affect your modules. It's just another userspace program like
anything else. Only with graphics.
M$ Windows uses different device drivers to M$ DOS, but under Linux the
GUI is not part of the O/S.

&gt; 
&gt; The soundblaster cdrom is accessed via a loadable module. When a system
&gt; call for the drive occurs (eg `mount /dev/sbpcd /mnt/cdrom`) the module
&gt; starts to look for the drive with it's built-in auto probing sequence. Once
&gt; it finds it (after about 2 minutes) everything is fine. If I want to I can
&gt; pre-load the module and specify parameters manually `insmod
&gt; /lib/modules/preferred/cdrom/sbpcd.o sbpcd=0x230,1` and this works fine
&gt; without having to autoprobe, thus saving lots of time.
You should be able to type merely
insmod sbpcd sbpcd=0x230,1
insmod usually does not require a path, since your modules should always
be in the same place.
If you can't, however, then I suspect either your modules path is odd,
or your module probing on startup is not running and/or working.

&gt; 
&gt; A simple fix for this would be to compile the module as a driver into the
&gt; kernel, and specify the options at compile time OR pass the parameters
&gt; through lilo. However I would prefer to leave it as a module.
If it's a module, you don't pass options thru lilo/loadlin - that's just
for non-modular code.
(I believe? Or does that still work?)

&gt; 
&gt; I want to know how to specify parameters so that when kerneld load the
&gt; module automatically, it looks for the soundblaster at 0x230 straight away.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried a few variations on "options sbpcd io=0x230 type=1" etc etc in
&gt; /etc/conf.modules, but this just causes the module to dump out saying that
&gt; it couldn't locate the module.
You're using the right file.
Above you said you needed to do insmod ..blah.. sbpcd=0x230,1
So, enter into conf.modules:
options sbpcd sbpcd=0x230,1
since modprobe will just pass the rest of the line onto insmod, and
apparently sbpcd=0x230,1 is the correct option.
However, the error that it cannot find the module is suspicious. This is
not due to your options being valid or invalid. Coupled with your
requiring a full pathname for your module suggests that something is
astray. Check that depmod -a is being run on start up. Thats the line
that says "Generating module dependancies" or something similar, on boot
in redhat linux.
Try typing depmod -a manually, and see if there are any error messages.

I am always a bit suspicious of the /lib/modules/preferred link that
redhat creates. Try removing the link and rerunning depmod -a, then
modprobe sbpcd.
Out of interest, can you modprobe anything else without putting a full
path in?
Have you recompiled your kernel using newer sources than the
alan-cox-special-edition kernel that comes with rh5.2? I'm pretty sure
you want to remove the 'preferred' link if so.

Can anyone else explain the nature of that link?
The kernel's are smart enough to work out their version number, and
change into that directory to access modules, so why the preferred link?
I guess you could create multiple zimages and multiple corresponding
sets of modules - but anyone who's likely to do that would be capable of
making and breaking links on their own.
Is it redhat specific, or in all recent kernels?

Yours,
Toby

&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Alex!
