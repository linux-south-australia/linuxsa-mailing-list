I must agree with Alex on the "play as yourself and not root concept". I
have seen some Unix boxes (or what is left of them) after people have played
as root. The worst problem was causing the root file system to become
corrupt by running certain DiskSuite commands (okay this is Solaris, but the
point is the same for Linux, NT, VMS, or whatever OS you are using with the
notion of a super user), which play with mirrors.

Remember fsck is just 5 keystrokes away from destroying your installation...

&gt;&gt; &gt; make sure you are root.
&gt;&gt; &gt; most system commands (like route, ifup, ifconfig, ipfwadm etcetcetc)
&gt;&gt; &gt; do not "exist" in your path unless you are root. extra security i
guess.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Security?  Bah.  Nothing of the sort.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;You can modify your path with impunity no matter what your user-id is.
&gt;&gt;Change the contents of your "PATH" environment variable (method varies
&gt;&gt;according to your shell).
&gt;
&gt;This is a much good plan. Much better than logging in as root. See below.
&gt;
&gt;However, I think what 'hawjd001' meant here was that the lack of the /sbin/
&gt;from a regular user path is to 'secure' your system from one's own
&gt;stupidity. We've all rm'ed something we shouldn't have I'm sure!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Depending on your local security policy and a risk assessment, you can
&gt;&gt;turn on the setuid flag on privileged commands so that you can run them
&gt;&gt;as unprivileged users.
&gt;
&gt;I always say to new users of linux who do almost everything as root,
&gt;'don't!'. Get into the habit of logging in as yourself and don't run your x
&gt;session as root either. Even if your the only person using the computer,
&gt;get into the habit of using it as just another uid. Edit your paths, and
&gt;permissions on devices so that you are not inconvenienced, but habits
&gt;formed now, will not have to be relearned when you get your first sysadmin
job!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
&gt;
&gt;Alex!
