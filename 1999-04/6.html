&gt; We've seen a bit of hysteria about the Melissa word macro virus lately,
&gt; but here's an article I've seen which talks about using another 'hidden
&gt; feature' in Word, the global identifier, which is based on your ethernet
&gt; MAC address. (Supposedly completely unique.)
&gt; Unless the author of the original document spoofed his identifier, the
&gt; FBI would be able to find the given netcard that was in the PC at the
&gt; time the document was first saved.
&gt; (I'd be interested to know the web site that it WAS originally posted
&gt; on, and how these people found the website, given the millions of them
&gt; around. That might be more interesting than the story of just extracting
&gt; the ID number)
&gt; 
&gt; Toby

If it is based on MAC address then it might be useful.  Unfortunately 
MAC addresses can be 

	a Changed on some chipsets
		I beleive the LANCE chipset can change it's MAC address.
	b Not assigned from the appropriate authority.  
		Cheap network cards do-not alway map to a 
		vendor who has paid?? for their identifiers.

So it would be interesting to see what it turns out to be.

One story I heard is that it got posted to alt.sex, which fairly closely
matches the content of the document.

Regards,

Matt
