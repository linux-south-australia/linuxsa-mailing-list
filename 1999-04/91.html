&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; A Pentium Pro is a RISC chip (as opposed to the X86 line which were CISC
&gt;&gt; &gt; chips, check a jargon list for defns) emulating a 486, and optimised for
&gt;&gt; &gt; 32 bit code. This means, Windows NT, Linux and other 32 Bit OS's (W95
to a
&gt;&gt; &gt; lesser extent) run faster on this, DOS and W3.X don't really go much
&gt;&gt; &gt; faster.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; does this require a different motherboard from the pentium classic range?
&gt;&gt; Currenly I'm running a 133 (overclocked to 188 - and very stable). My mb
&gt;&gt; takes upto a 200 and if the ppro doesn't require another mb then I know
&gt;&gt; what I'm looking for :)
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunatley yes, most major chip changes, and then some require a
&gt;different motherboard, so 486-486/Pentium Upgrade-Pentium-Pentium
&gt;Pro-Pentium II all require different motherboards, with different sockets.

Ummm, the Pentium, Cyrix and AMD chips use socket 7, Pentium Pro used
socket 8, Pentium II and III use Slot 1, early Celerons used Slot 1 as
well, but later Celerons seem to use socket 370. E&OE.

&gt;Particularly different are the Pentium Pro to Pentium II change, the
&gt;socket was changed on its side. You not only require a different
&gt;Motherboard, but also a different Case probably to accomodate a thing
&gt;about 5 cm high above the motherboard.
&gt;
&gt;Another thing I forgot to mention, you can do Dual Processors with the
&gt;Pentium Pro, and the Pentium II.
&gt;
&gt;The best Upgrade I can think of is look around for some Cirux and AMD
&gt;chips, you can still get some socket 7 200 (and maybe even 233) MHz chips
&gt;around, but these are getting rare.

Ummm, I was kind of under the impression that AMD K6-2s were socket 7
chips, and they go up to 400MHz, when you can get them.

&gt;Best recomendation (tho more costly) buy a new motherboard, and chip.
&gt;Transfer everything else across (you'll probably find Sound and Video
&gt;onboard most motherboards these days). Cost about $300-$400. Even to add
&gt;in a new case, and good video and sound card would be around $600, cheaper
&gt;than a new PC, and considering you might be looking at $200 for a new
&gt;chip, not hideously over priced.

Watch out for the newer motherboards. Things like the TekRam MVP3 ith FSB
100MHz support (actually will clock at 112 MHz) only support DIMMS. So you
get to throw away your SIMS as well.
