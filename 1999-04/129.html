&gt; Hi all,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; heh, yeah. The Cyrix processors are really chip, and stable too, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when it comes to running 32 bit apps, and floating point applications,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; they slow down to a crawl.
&gt; &gt;&gt; sorry - but I beg to differ.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I differ with your differ ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;32bit and floating point - I had a p200 for ages, playing quake2 (heavy
&gt; &gt;floating point), and thought it was ok, until I saw an Pentium 200
&gt; &gt;running quake2.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll admit that the p200+'s were pretty poor
&gt; (they were actually 150Mhz in speed anyway).
&gt; Furthermore, the 75Mhz bus-speed p200+s were absolute
&gt; rubbish (extremely unstable) and they had some major
&gt; overheating problems. In fact, we have already cooked,
&gt; sold or disposed of any that we did have.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the earlier 686's (p120,p166) are quite reliable,
&gt; quick enough on the maths side and really only lacking in
&gt; "cool gameplay" aspects (which worries me little if I get good
&gt; uptimes on servers). At the very least, they were worth the
&gt; [1/3 cost of Pentium] prices we paid for them at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; And more recently, I have found the 300s and 333s to be a great
&gt; improvement on the 200 range and haven't had a problem with them
&gt; so far. (Once again, they're quick(er), they're stable and
&gt; they're cheap)
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't yet had the chance to work with a K6 chip, but
&gt; they seem to have a good rep with most of the sysadmins
&gt; I know who have used them.
For what it's worth, for a while I used to have a 486-dx2-66, p120+
6x86, a p200+ 6x86, a p133 pentium, a p200 pentium, and a K6-200
available to me. (I didn't actually own 'em all, but worked with em
all.)
I tried out linux on all of, and compared kernel compiling on them.
The Cyrixs went significantly faster than the 486, but this wasn't a
terrible surprise, given their much higher CPU speed. Interestingly
though, a friend compared a Cyrix 586-100 and a 486dx4-100, and found
they were almost exactly the same. Comparing a 586-100 and a 686-120+
(actually 100Mhz) showed the 686 to be faster than the 586 in integer
math, but the same (slow) speed in FP math.
The genuine pentium 133 actually blew both Cyrixs out of the water.
Maybe not in windoze, but under linux where it's 32bit, the real pentium
ran everything faster, integer and FP. At the time the p133 was my
machine and the p200+ was a brothers, so serious testing when on between
the two.
The k6-200 was definately faster than the pentium 200 in most things,
way faster in integer math, and a bit faster in FP math. Interestingly
though, while rc5 benchmarked faster on the K6, Quake benchmarked a
little slower on the K6 compared to a p200. I never figured this out.
However, a good K6 or K6-2 is still pretty cheap compared to buying the
Slot1 board and pentium2 stuff, and they do put up very good results in
your system. if you want hardcore FPU abilities, still go with the
celeron or pentium2, but otherwise the K6 is certainly worth looking at
for the price.

Anyway, just my second 2c worth for the day(for a total of 4c, rounded
up to 5c), and back to work.

&gt; 
&gt; Just my $0.02 :-)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Same with building kernel images I was amazed at the speed increase whrn
&gt; &gt;using a K6-233 over A P200. Yes it should be faster, but "damn!"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;IMHO The K6 or pentium whups serious cyrix butt, Especially under Linux
&gt; &gt;and after all, that is what this group is about ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;We still use all three though. No point throwing out a working chip.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Now if I can find a m/b that actually supports the voltage for the new
&gt; &gt;K6-2/475 Beasty I'll be happy ;-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hmmm. damn, got dragged into a "mines better than yours" didn't I.
