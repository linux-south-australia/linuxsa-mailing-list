&gt; Hi All.
&gt; 
&gt; I am interested in using the Automounter (autofs package) that ships
&gt; with redhat 5.2. I have installed the package and configured the files
&gt; to suit my system (see below) and started the daemon by issuing
&gt; "/etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs start" as root. This starts the daemon and
&gt; no errors are detected. All is good :-)
&gt; 
&gt; However, the point is that I can cd to /misc/floppy (for example) and
&gt; ask for a listing (ls) and nothing happens. How do I get the autofs
&gt; daemon to actually mount the filesystem? I have tried making the
&gt; appropriate directories within the /misc tree as well, and it
&gt; fails me.
&gt; 
&gt; A simple explanation of HOW to get this to work would be very much
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, to save an email, does anyone know of an FTP program that supports
&gt; batch uploading of an entire directory structure and only uploads the
&gt; files within the structure that have changes since last upload??

Adam, 
	Automount can be a beast until you figure it out. The solution,
you DONT make the directories! Unlike solaris Linux does not
show the directory until it is mounted. In your case just do:

cd /misc/cdrom

Even though the cdrom directory doesn't exist, it will mount it and create
it (provided you have autofs support in your kernel).

As for your ftp question, lftp is great as it can mirror directory
structures. It is also very nice to use as it treats the remote filesystem
as if it was on the current. 

Cheers,
