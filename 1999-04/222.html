Subject: Two quick questions about bash


&gt;I have two questions about substitution in bash.
&gt;
&gt;1. Firstly, with a for loop can you use arithmetic substitution for the
loop
&gt;index?
&gt;
&gt;I thinking of something like:
&gt;    for i in "1 to 3"
&gt;    do
&gt;      # whatever
&gt;    done
&gt;
&gt;instead of:
&gt;    for i in 1 2 3
&gt;    do
&gt;      # whatever
&gt;    done
&gt;
&gt;The second way is fine for short lists, but not for longer ones.  I could
&gt;use a while, but I'm curious.
&gt;

You would have to generate the list somehow, I haven't seen a for like that
in shell scripting, this doesn't mean somebody has re-written bash to handle
something like this. It would be possible to call a function to build the
list, you would probably assing the result of the function to a variable and
use that in the for loop.

&gt;2. Secondly, can you simulate arrays by using substitution in variable
names?
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking of something like:
&gt;   for i in 1 2 3
&gt;   do
&gt;     A$i=whatever
&gt;   done
&gt;
&gt;instead of:
&gt;  A1=whatever; A2=whatever; A3=whatever
&gt;
&gt;I realise there are lots of references out there, but I'm being lazy.  I
&gt;would welcome anyone directing me to reference that has some examples.
&gt;

Seeing as you have a basic script, replace the whatever with "Hello World"
or something, and give it a try. This is not a cop out, it's just you seem
to have an idea, so try it, if it fails, you will have answered your own
question.


&gt;Thanks

Sorry Josh, if this doesn't help, I would give you something better, but I
have no Linux box in front of me to check the scripts properly and give you
an answer.
