Hi,
&gt; Can someone please tell me the difference between the pentium classic,
&gt; pentium pro & p2
&gt; 
&gt; I just can't ever remember the pentium pro ever being advertised but I
&gt; hear about it all the time.

Some of this is memory, and some of this is from the BIOS Guide (dard
where's that URL, it'll show up in an internet search),

A Pentium is to a simple degree two 486's working in parallel with some
extra instructions, and some cache, and some other stuff thrown in for
good measure.

A Pentium Pro is a RISC chip (as opposed to the X86 line which were CISC
chips, check a jargon list for defns) emulating a 486, and optimised for
32 bit code. This means, Windows NT, Linux and other 32 Bit OS's (W95 to a
lesser extent) run faster on this, DOS and W3.X don't really go much
faster.

A Pentium II is a souped up Pentium Pro with more Cache, the MMX
instruction set, and faster again (more clock speed).

A Pentium III is a Pentium II with a faster clock speed, and more
instructions again (graphics, the Katmi Instruction Set), ie you need a
program written to use them to gain their advantage.

A Cerelon is a Pentium II without the onboard Cache.

A Cerelon 333a and faster has the onboard cache, and generally benchmarks
faster than the equivalent Pentium II

AMD, and Cirux have chips which emulate the Pentium instruction sets in
their own way.

In essence, since a 486 is a better 386, there really hasn't been a major
advance in the PC chip line since the 386 replaced the 286. However this
is a broad generalisation, and there are specific things that made each
chip unique.

Hope this helps.

cya
