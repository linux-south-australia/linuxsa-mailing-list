Hi Paul,
	The Project was for a Flinders Uni Computer Science Software Engineering
Course, so it was quite low level. The specific topic we did in our group
was Security and Common Interface to the rest of the world, and the C-Bus
system was offered as basically something that didn't fit into anyone
else's project. I actually found that some of the claims of the MFP were a
little unrealistic at the time and wondered if they were really going to do
some of the stuff that they claimed, eg. one security concern we had was
that Personal Medical records would be available on the System so that in
an Emergency a person would be identified in the Hospital and quick access
would be available to those that needed them. We decided that a simple palm
scanner or fingerprint scanner would be fine for emergency use, but the MFP
knocked it on the head and said go for a retina scanner, since by the time
that you put 1500 of them in the estate they would be cheap.

	Originally the idea of the Project was to send it to the MFP as case
studies for incorporation into the system that Telstra was going to
install, but the MFP died about 2 weeks after we handed up. I don't know if
any of the information is still available, but you may try contacting Chris
Marlin at Flinders University. He is the vice Chancellor now, but he was
running Software Engineering about 2 years ago. I still recommend the C-Bus
System though, it was great, perfect for smart home applications.

	Cheers!
		Andrew.

&gt; Andrew,
&gt; 
&gt; I've bought a property at Mawson Lakes but while the sales people are
still
&gt; raving about
&gt; this sort of stuff and the encombrances include a vary dubious clause
about a
&gt; home
&gt; management system, there is very little in the way of 'facts' on the
ground.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a report available on the work that you did?
&gt; 
&gt; I intend on going to the meeting,, mainly to see how open Clipsal is
about
&gt; it's technology..
&gt; In the end I hope to install a Clipsal Cbus system (of some form) and
have it
&gt; controlled
&gt; via a Linux box...
&gt; (I want to use the Linux box to so the home monitoring
(water/gas/electricity)
&gt; as
&gt; well)
&gt; 
&gt; This is a personal project, so I'm more than happy to share all the
specs..
&gt; Viva la Free Software
&gt;
