Alan,

I suggest you stop getting personal or making assumptions about my character
based on the fact that I am new to Linux and to the list. I never professed
to have an indepth knowledge about Linux and quite frankly it is people like
you who are not open to any "old" argument even if it has value because you
obviously know everything.  Excuse me, but it would appear that the founder
of Linux still seems to think you can make money out of free software as he
encourages it all the time. That's what I based my argument on and it's
certainly not "old" or "naive" or "hippie" like.

Yippie that you work at DSTO.  I've worked for Defence although not in that
field for 10 years.  It would appear you think you are the only one who
believes they have any real value to add to this list based on your tone
with others.  Good luck to you buddy.  I could sue you for character
deformation quicker than a flash if ever you owned up to the fact that the
tears thing and the lack of knowledge about "the other list" is because I'm
female.  I'm sorry that this is a public forum but you can bet your bottom
dollar I will never, ever when I have the indepth level of knowledge you
apparently believe to have, I will never find what you have to say
interesting.  Thank you others for pointing me in the right Direction.  

I do believe saying "making money out of complementary goods such as manuals
and on-line help" is both micro-economics and real info which has been
applied to other mediums such as the Internet for which all of the
information is free (somewhat parallel to the code in linux).  Yet it makes
money left right and centre.

	Will stay clear of this list from now on.  

&gt; Natalie,
&gt; 
&gt; To be even more patronising, as you put it,
&gt; the ideas you raised have been hacked to death a thousand
&gt; times over the last 5 years or so, in many different
&gt; mail lists etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Accusing someone of being patronising is a very low form of argument.
&gt; If someone takes a patronising attitude towards you, then you
&gt; should ask why. Maybe you said something naive.
&gt; 
&gt; If you were concerned by the tone of my e-mail, you will
&gt; be in tears if you come across the really tough people in the
&gt; linuxsa group. 
&gt; 
&gt; By the way, I've been working at dsto for the last 3.5 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The subject of "open source" software is vastly too deep to
&gt; be valuably discussed in the linuxsa list.
&gt; I was only throwing in a few comments because of the upcoming
&gt; Playford Centre thing. 
&gt; 
&gt; There are socio-economic forces that are behind linux which are
&gt; very similar to the 60s/70s hippie movement actually,
&gt; relating to unemployment levels. But I was trying to inject a 
&gt; little micro-economic reality into the discussion.
&gt; But then again, it's not actually a discussion group.
&gt; It's really meant for imparting real info.
&gt; The "open source" philosophical discussions are happening
&gt; elsewhere, and most people in the list know this.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
	Natalia.
