Have a look at netscape for what is probably the simplest solution.
The most functional is to look at fetchmail, and then your mail client
of choice. (pine is nice.)
fetchmail+procmail+pine = able to do pretty much anything.
fetchmail+procmail+emacs = able to do the rest, with a lisp.

&gt; I dont suppose I can call myself a newbie still, I have been
&gt; blundering around in Linux for over 3 weeks now, but I still think I
&gt; know less than 1% ;-). But everything I have been doing is via &lt;root&gt;,
&gt; which I understand is dangerous, but I have been having difficulty
&gt; doing things under my user account.
&gt; 
&gt; I now wish to be able to use email on my Linux box (Toshiba 440)
&gt; rather than my 'bloatware' desktop. I have tried to use elm and the
&gt; others that come with RedHat but must confess failure. Either this is
&gt; from ignornace or stupidity. I have started reading the doco for
&gt; sendmail but I am afraid I am sinking fast.
&gt; 
&gt; I require an email client to be able to access three email accounts on
&gt; two different ISP's. Can anyone offer some suggestions on where I
&gt; should direct my efforts?, currently I seem to be overwhelmed with
&gt; documentation to read, and whilst I am sure all of it is very
&gt; important, reading the relevant things now would be more beneficial.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
&gt; 
&gt; Mike
