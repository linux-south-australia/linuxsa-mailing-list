On the subject of how linux could progress in the future,
I've just had a brainwave (or at least I think I have).

Why not just use software usage meters.

I.e. each copy of linux comes with one compulsory piece of software which
runs all day measuring how much each "piece" of software is used.
It could be embedded in the kernel, and it could be excised.
But the reward for keeping the software usage meter (SUM) in place
would be that the user gets _all_ software on their computer
for free at time of acquisition (i.e. purchase for 0 dollars),
and then after that the SUM sends charging info to a central point
once a week or month, detailing how much each "piece" of
software is used.
Then the user is charged some nominal sum of money (or else the
government pays it on behalf of all users), and this money is
distributed to the software developers in proportion to usage.

I'm aware of the various details which are potentially
difficulties in this development, but they are not important.
Only "show-stoppers" are important when developing this sort of
idea. 


The main point here is that an author who wants software to be public domain
and free can nominate 0 dollars per hour as the cost.
Someone who invests $10m to create a program could nominate
a large cost for usage. The user should be able to determine the
usage cost before using the software.

This idea is similar to the network computer software rental concept,
but the difference is that it is much more viable due to the
fact that the user gets their own independent computer (which users
do seem to want), you don't have to be on the net, and 
you get to see the source of the software if available. etc. etc. etc.

I've summarised the idea at
