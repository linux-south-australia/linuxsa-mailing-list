&gt; &gt; &gt; Today Newscorp's Net News service carried the following snippet of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; story:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Reads a lot like slashdot a lot of the times now :).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The 'white paper' from this article is free, if you give up your Email
&gt; &gt; &gt; address etc, while the full report is $995 US. [Buy now and receive a

&gt; &gt; &gt; LINUX DOESN'T DO EVERYTHING
&gt;
&gt; "So it begins..."
&gt;
&gt; Looks like people are starting to play hard ball politics with linux
&gt; now.  This
&gt; is not the first article, nor will it be the last, to start the campaign
&gt; against
&gt; linux.
&gt;
&gt; However, to help people understand the complexities of good and poor
&gt; reviews, I'd like to explain some basicv concepts when identifying a
&gt; Quality product!
&gt;
&gt; Imagine your target group of current and new linux users! How do we make
&gt; linux
&gt; suitable for continuous and new users?
&gt;
&gt; Not as easy as you imagine as we all make different choices when it
&gt; comes to
&gt; quality.
&gt;
&gt; Basic fact- there are defining dimensions that we address prior to using
&gt; a
&gt; product.
&gt;
&gt; Aesthetics
&gt; Performance
&gt; Reliability
&gt; Features
&gt; Conformance
&gt; Perceived Quality
&gt; Serviceability
&gt; Reliability
&gt;
&gt; Mind boggling is it not!
&gt;
&gt; Like it or not, we do address and prioritise these dimensions
&gt; consciously or
&gt; unconsciously. We decide which is the most important to us (read self)
&gt; and make
&gt; our chioces.  So when we... oops, (some people) fail miserably to
&gt; understand why
&gt; someone wants a GUI or he/she won't use linux, remember DIMENSIONS and
&gt; choice.
&gt;
&gt; And it is this fact which makes the 'White Paper' you have all been
&gt; notified
&gt; about quite useless when applied in our usage context.
&gt;
&gt; Phew... so read the article, yes, but take heed of just what makes US
&gt; decide what
&gt; is good and what is poor.
&gt;
&gt; So when  Alan Farrely gives his point of view, it is based on HIS
&gt; perceptions of
&gt; what makes a quality product based on the dimensions I have mentioned
&gt; above.
&gt;
&gt; That is why we are making good progress, the linux community is
&gt; strengthening the
&gt; dimensions above so that it is attracting new users who may have decided
&gt; previous, consciously or unconsciously, to reject the product because of
&gt; one or
&gt; more of failings applied to the dimensions above.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this is not too inappropriate for this mailing list.
&gt;
&gt; Kind Regards
&gt;
&gt; Steve
