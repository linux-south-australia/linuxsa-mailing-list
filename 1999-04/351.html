                                Title:
	       GNU/Linux and the Free Software Movement

                               Speaker:
	      Richard Stallman, Free Software Foundation


                               ABSTRACT

Richard Stallman will speak about the goals, history, method, current
status and future plans of the GNU Project, which has developed the
free operating system GNU/Linux.


			      BIOGRAPHY

Richard Stallman is the founder of the GNU project, launched in 1984
to develop the free operating system GNU (an acronym for "GNU's Not
Unix"), and thereby give computer users the freedom that most of them
have lost.  GNU is free software: everyone is free to copy it and
redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small.

Today, Linux-based variants of the GNU system, based on the kernel
Linux developed by Linus Torvalds, are in widespread use.  There are
estimated to be over 10 million users of GNU/Linux systems today.

Richard Stallman is the principal author of the GNU C Compiler, a
portable optimizing compiler which was designed to support diverse
architectures and multiple languages.  The compiler now supports over
30 different architectures and 7 programming languages.

Stallman also wrote the GNU symbolic debugger (GDB), GNU Emacs, and
various other GNU programs.

Stallman received the Grace Hopper Award from the Association for
Computing Machinery for 1991 for his development of the first Emacs
editor in the 1970s.  In 1990 he was awarded a MacArthur Foundation
fellowship, and in 1996 an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute
of Technology in Sweden.  In 1998 he received the Electronic Frontier
Foundation's Pioneer award along with Linus Torvalds.


                     All interested are welcome.
