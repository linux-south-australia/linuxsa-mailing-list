Dear penguin people,
ASLUG (Alice Springs Linux User Group) have decided to have a display at our
local show in a couple of months time. We will have various systems running
stuff like Staroffice, Povray, Wine, email etc and anything else we can
think of. I was thinking of setting up an old 386 I had collecting dust just
to show that with Linux all things are possible.

Stupid Question      Are all things still possible? Does RH5.2 still run on
an i386? According to Redhat it does but I know this is not something that
one usually bothers to try. Has anyone done it lately? Can anyone think of
any pitfalls, warnings etc?
Equally can anyone think of an application that is eyecatching enough to
amaze the square-eyed majority? I don't think a login prompt will start a
revolution.
The system will probably have 4 - 8 meg of ram, approx 100 - 200 meg hdd,
network card, old vga card (can it run on an ega card?? I have one ),
nicotine stains, lots of dust and definitely not be y2k compatible.
And, no I wasn't considering running X.

Many thanks from north of the border.
