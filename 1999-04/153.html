Hi,

I worked as one of the service tech's on this system..
It's worth a look, we at that stage, were toying with the idea of a java
interface, running on Linux.
Putting houses on the net to be controlled via a WEB browser, I don't think
Clipsal continued with this idea.

The system is very dynamic and programmable, allowing firmware upgrades of
the modules via the external client program.
The system is relatively easy to install and configure, based on low voltage
communications between modules, utilising ordinary twisted pair cable.

The system allows , via a serial connection, full control of lighting, fans,
switches, IR sensors, Light dimming, security, Light sensors , etc.
All this has the ability to be controlled / scheduled via a client on a PC.
It has the ability to connect multiple building together via modems, so you
can control multiple buildings from the location.

Think of it, press a button in the US and turn on a light in your lounge
room in Australia.
This can be done now, this doesn't need the interaction of any dedicated
computer after it has been set up.
The Web activation idea was an extension to this..

The programming of the modules is very open and flexible, but I understand
this is under licence by Clipsal.

Overall a very cool product.

Derek...

&gt;
&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt; 	I was working on a Software Engineering Project through Flinders
&gt; University a couple of years ago on Smart Houses that were going
&gt; to be used
&gt; in Mawson Lakes Estate when it was run by the MFP. We looked at exactly
&gt; this product and decided that it was great. If you might be interested in
&gt; smart houses or stuff like that, I well recommend going to this meeting.
&gt; Unfortunately I am working 4pm-Midnight tonight, otherwise I would be
&gt; there. &lt;sniff&gt;
&gt;
&gt; 	Cheers!
&gt; 		Andrew.

&gt; &gt; I recieved this, if anyone is interested then feel free to go.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not sure how programmable the programmable is, but if we can
&gt; &gt; control it simply then we could all have 'smart' houses with large
&gt; &gt; amounts of uptime :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards,

&gt; &gt; &gt; The April SAMG meeting will be held tomorrow night Friday 9/4/99. If
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; think any LinuxSA members may be interested you may wish to advise
&gt; them.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The meeting will be held at 8pm, Burnside Community Centre, Corner
&gt; Greenhill
&gt; &gt; &gt; an Portrush Roads. A description of the meeting is below.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Clipsal C-Bus Automation system.
&gt; &gt; &gt; TIME: 8:00 p.m.
&gt; &gt; &gt; DATE: Friday April 9, 1999
&gt; &gt; &gt; PLACE: Burnside Council Community Centre cnr of Portrush and Greenhill
&gt; &gt; &gt; Roads, Burnside
&gt; &gt; &gt; SUBJECT: Clipsal C-Bus Automation system.
&gt; &gt; &gt; PRESENTER: Mr. Barry Walker
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The April meeting will be on the Clipsal C-Bus Automation System.
&gt; Please
&gt; &gt; &gt; note the change of venue, now at the Burnside Council
&gt; Community Centre,
&gt; &gt; &gt; corner of Portrush and Greenhill Roads Burnside.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The C-Bus system is a fully programmable control system designed
&gt; primarily
&gt; &gt; &gt; to optimise lighting arrangements to save electricity cost. It also
&gt; provides
&gt; &gt; &gt; more flexible and efficient lighting operations compared to
&gt; conventional
&gt; &gt; &gt; lighting systems in multistorey buildings, offices and hotels. It also
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; &gt; application in the home, our talk last year on Mawson Lakes
&gt; demonstrated the
&gt; &gt; &gt; level of automation that may become standard in the near future.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The system is reliable and less expensive than comparable energy
&gt; management
&gt; &gt; &gt; systems and will radically simplify electrical installation practices.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Microprocessors are built into push button light switches which send
&gt; &gt; &gt; commands to the distributed load controllers to use only the lights
&gt; that are
&gt; &gt; &gt; needed. In its basic mode, C-Bus provides clever switching flexibility
&gt; &gt; &gt; compared to a conventional switch installation. When linked to a
&gt; personal
&gt; &gt; &gt; computer, C-Bus can monitor all lighting arrangements within a
&gt; multistorey
&gt; &gt; &gt; building and stop wasteful use of electricity. If utilised with
&gt; particular
&gt; &gt; &gt; C-Bus products, lighting arrangements can be adjusted to the degree of
&gt; &gt; &gt; natural light. Alternatively, lights can be programmed to
&gt; function only
&gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt; a person is in a room to a far more sophisticated level than with
&gt; &gt; &gt; conventional people sensors. Once installed, C-Bus offers enormous
&gt; potential
&gt; &gt; &gt; and possibilities in the future to link in security, climate control,
&gt; fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; alarms and irrigation control arrangements.
&gt; &gt; &gt; This should be a fascinating presentation on a locally developed
&gt; technology.
