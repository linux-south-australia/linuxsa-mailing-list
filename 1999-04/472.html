    I am a new comer to Linux and have Red hat 5.2 up and running OK but =
am having a few problems with access accross a network. The main problem =
is that when I try and Telnet or use a unix client to connect to the =
Linux box the login prompt will take at least 30 sec to appear on the =
screen, I can then log in ok and do what every I like. I have =
reinstalled Linux several times tryed two different NIC one a NE2000 PCI =
clone and an EtherExpress Pro. I can always ping the Linux box from NT =
or win95 and the web page from Apache comes up straight away. FTP also =
times out from NT and also has a lot of trouble connecting from a SCO =
box to Linux, yet the Linux box can FTP to the SCO OK.=20
    I am also trying to setup Samba and found that the server name =
appears when browsing from NT but when I try and look at the shares it =
comes back with Network path not found, not sure if all this is related =
or not. Has anyone else had this touble.
