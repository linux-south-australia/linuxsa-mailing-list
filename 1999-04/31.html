&gt; If it is based on MAC address then it might be useful.  Unfortunately
&gt; MAC addresses can be
&gt;
&gt; a Changed on some chipsets
&gt; I beleive the LANCE chipset can change it's MAC address.

All chipsets can change their MAC address, although some
will only let you do so during an initialisation sequence.

It has to be this way -- it is desirable for some applications
for the MAC address to belong to the machine and interface,
not the NIC.  An example is redundant chipsets.  Another
example is DECnet hosts, where changing the MAC address
changes the DECnet address (and DECnet addresses should
be static).

These are unusual applications, but no chipset designer
is going to forego a part of a market, as it is impossible
to predict how important that market component might become
during the chipset's lifetime.

A good example if the handling of an obscure ethernet
feature called multicast.  The DEC Tulip chipset
handles this well, the LANCE chipset middlingly,
and the earlier Intel chipsets poorly.  So what
chipset will you find in the multimedia-oriented
computers?


&gt; b Not assigned from the appropriate authority.
&gt; Cheap network cards do-not alway map to a
&gt; vendor who has paid?? for their identifiers.

Unlikely.  Most manufacturers of cheap cards purchase
the ID ROMs from a third party.  The first three octets
of the MAC address may belong to that third party.
So cheap cards often look as if they pinched address
space from, say, Intel.


&gt; So it would be interesting to see what it turns out to be.

Given that it is a virus, there is every chance that the
MAC address is that of the sender, not of the originator of
the document.
