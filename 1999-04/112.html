One of my clients got hacked over the weekend from a crew in Brazil.  Here
is the entertaining story of the tracking and patching of the problem :

Here are the symptoms: (in order of discovery)

- on login as root, you get a banner saying 'ACCESS GRANTED' flashing red,
sleep 2, clear, echo 'Welcome to HXRave' ... 

I thought What ?  .. next step, check to see who has logged in recently, and
who might have changed /etc/motd or something

- /etc/motd not changed

- grep /etc/everything for the string 'GRANTED' ... nothing found

Check log files

- /var/log/messages contained entries about a login from a user called
'rewt' uid=0
- /var/log/[messages, security, xferlog, maillog, etc, etc] truncated as of
the date of the hack

check /etc/passwd - no entry for rewt, sure enough

- /bin/login had a new timestamp

vi /bin/login - found the string 'ACCESS GRANTED' along with all the other
stuff .. Resist tempation to replace hacked /bin/login with 
real /bin/login for now.

Check networking:
- ifconfig showed a whole pile (eth0:5 - eth0:15) of new aliased interfaces
- netstat -a shows an IRC server running on port 6667

My client definately does not use IRC ... whats all this ?

- run irc, connect to local server
- connection made OK ! - list channels - there are a whole pile of IRC
channels all coming up in Spanish ! This is getting bizarre !

Now to clean up a bit ...

Check log files .. an oldish imapd is the blame ... comment out imapd from
/etc/inetd.conf, and mv /usr/bin/imapd to /usr/bin/imapd_old .. dont need it
anyway.

Now, where do those extra aliases come from ?

- /etc/rc.d/rc.local has new ifconfig and route entries - vi
/etc/rc.d/rc.local and comment them out
- /etc/rc.d/rc.local calls a couple of weird programs, namely
   /dev/.chips/hx/hx &
   /dev//.chips/bnc &

Hmm...  cd /dev/.chips; ls -R ... good, source code and all buried away in
there. Have a look in the source code ..
nothing malignant in there, which is lucky. It is just some very slick IRC
server that looks like it is using IP multicasting
to broadcast music in MP3 format to whoever is attached.

Various log files indicate that a number of other hacked sites are also
hooked together into some sort of mp3-broadcast-ring

Checking more log files shows lots of connections from many different
addresses in the .com.br domain.

What to do next ?  Having a certain respect for the opponent, I dont want to
act like a PHB and just slam the door shut, these people might be
script-kiddies for all I know, but they also are people that you can learn
something from if you play your cards right.

- download source code to /bin/login
- Change the code around a bit so that it accepts a login from 'rewt', and
displays the exact same banner as they got before
- add a 'fake_shell()' routine to /bin/login that looks and smells like a
real shell, lets you cd and ls and things, but does not run
any real commands. Instead all commands are appended to /Rewt.log for later
viewing
- Replace their hacked /bin/login with my double-hacked /bin/login

- Write a replacement for imapd that simply accepts connections on port 143,
does nothing with them, and exits. This is so that when they next try to
'fix' the system using imapd, it looks like the attempt succeeded.

Take down the IRC server: killall -9 hx; killall -9 bnc

tail -f /var/log/messages shows a growing stream of  identd queries on port
6667 on this machine ...

I have left the little mousetrap running for a while, will report back with
any results that I find later on.

Anyone else had any fun playing with the boys from Brazil ?
