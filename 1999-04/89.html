Hi,

&gt; &gt; A Pentium Pro is a RISC chip (as opposed to the X86 line which were CISC
&gt; &gt; chips, check a jargon list for defns) emulating a 486, and optimised for
&gt; &gt; 32 bit code. This means, Windows NT, Linux and other 32 Bit OS's (W95 to a
&gt; &gt; lesser extent) run faster on this, DOS and W3.X don't really go much
&gt; &gt; faster.
&gt; 
&gt; does this require a different motherboard from the pentium classic range?
&gt; Currenly I'm running a 133 (overclocked to 188 - and very stable). My mb
&gt; takes upto a 200 and if the ppro doesn't require another mb then I know
&gt; what I'm looking for :)

Unfortunatley yes, most major chip changes, and then some require a
different motherboard, so 486-486/Pentium Upgrade-Pentium-Pentium
Pro-Pentium II all require different motherboards, with different sockets.

Particularly different are the Pentium Pro to Pentium II change, the
socket was changed on its side. You not only require a different
Motherboard, but also a different Case probably to accomodate a thing
about 5 cm high above the motherboard.

Another thing I forgot to mention, you can do Dual Processors with the
Pentium Pro, and the Pentium II.

The best Upgrade I can think of is look around for some Cirux and AMD
chips, you can still get some socket 7 200 (and maybe even 233) MHz chips
around, but these are getting rare.

Best recomendation (tho more costly) buy a new motherboard, and chip.
Transfer everything else across (you'll probably find Sound and Video
onboard most motherboards these days). Cost about $300-$400. Even to add
in a new case, and good video and sound card would be around $600, cheaper
than a new PC, and considering you might be looking at $200 for a new
chip, not hideously over priced.

cya
