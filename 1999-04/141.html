Yes, it is ISO9660 format, but using rock ridge extentions.
A direct disk-to-disk or ISO image of the original CD should produce a
working CD.
If you are trying to produce your own personalised CD, with updates and
extras n stuff, then you need to do the following:
make up a tree on a harddrive that contains everything you want on the
CD, and make sure everything has correct permissions. Unlike iso9660 and
joliet, rockridge keeps permissions.
If you want a bootable CD, you need to have a floppy disk image on file
ready too (the floppy image should be a kickstart-style one, that is
bootable, of course!)
For the floppy image, i have more success making a DOS boot disk that
has a CD driver, mscdex, loadlin, etc. but for a true linux distrib you
should make a nice linux bootdisk. ;)
Anyway, then you use mkisofs to create you ISO image.
Remember to pass it options the make the root of the directory you pass,
the root of the CD. Remember to do -r or -R (I think, i havent got it
handy) for the rock ridge extensions.
And the options for a boot disk image.

The redhat default boot cd images dont have joliet support, so DONT make
the cds joliet for them. Of course, then the cd is next to useless in
windoze. If you are compiling your own distrib and you have included
joliet support, then I believe you can have joliet and rockridge
simultaneously, although possibly with some mounting options. I cant
remember trying it myself.
Anyone else?

Anyway, that should give you an idea about whats going on.
If you're burning CDs for 'common' distribution among windoze and linux
machines, joliet is probably the way to go, since windoze doesnt support
rockridge at all! If I knew more about it, I might try and make a new
cdfs.vxd for win95, but although i could do it if I had the original
source code, somehow I doubt M$ would send it to me. ;(

&gt; &gt; does anyone know of a place that sells burns of the redhat-contrib

&gt; &gt; preferably in adelaide, and preferably cheap. (obviously!)
