Hi,

I am looking for a program that will keep up a ppp link 24 hours a day and
keep track of bytes received/transmitted.

Currently, I'm trying to use diald, but have had a few problems. I got all
the diald rpms from contrib.redhat.com, but didn't really know which to
install. I tried one of them, but it didn't work, so I ended up installing
diald16-0.16.5a-2.rpm, but the /etc/rc.d/init.d/diald script doesn't work
(so I just shoved a line in rc.local though, so it loads). I'm just a little
curious if anything else doesn't work.

Anyway, I can use the dctl program to see the bytes transmitted, but every
time I quit the program (eg. every time I log out), the bytes are reset and
I don't particularly want to keep a user logged in 24/7. I don't really know
enough about programming (ok, I know almost nothing) to do anything, so much
for trying to write a program that will look at the diald FIFO. I didn't see
any programs that claimed to look at the diald FIFO, (I didn't really look
very hard) not that I would know where to look (the diald homepage(s) didn't
have anything, neither did linuxberg, and I can't remember seeing anything
at freshmeat.net).

If possible, I would like the program to be able to have the data
transferred reset at the end of the month (manually, or automatically) and
possibly even write the information about data transferred into a file, so I
can put it on a web page. I'm pretty sure this is just wishful thinking
though ;)

at least at the moment diald seems to keep the connection up all the time.
:)
Took me ages to find a program that claimed it could do that. I bet I
haven't even set it up properly ;)

thanks,
Andy
