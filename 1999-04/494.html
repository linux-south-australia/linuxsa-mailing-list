I have just installed RedHat Linux 5.2 in an attempt to escape the =
clutches of Bill Gates. However, I've some trouble with X. First my =
mouse wouldn't work, but I got some advice from your mail arhives and =
fixed by changing the mouse protocol. I still have a problem with my =
keyboard key mappings. Some characters such as ~# | don't work or are =
mapped to the wrong key. They all seem to be symbols requiring the shift =
key being simultaneously depressed. This happens in straight linux and =
in X. Does anyone have any suggestions?=20
