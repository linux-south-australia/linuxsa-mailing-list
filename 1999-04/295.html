Hi Mike,
I dont realy have an answer, but may I suggest that you bring you box to
the next meeting where many people may be able to help you out.
Back to the problem, try compiling a kernel from a console, and see if
that compiles ok, then we can rule out a memory problem causing your
lockups.
Ben.

&gt; 
&gt; I am a novice !, amply demonstrated by stating that XFree wont run on AGP cards, when what I meant was the AGP card with my chipset. I could get it to run in VGA mode and no more, this was pointed out by knowledgeable person and backed up by XFree FAQ. Apologies to all for any confusion.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT, I still have a problem. Now I have changed to a Cirrus Logic 546x card. Ran Xconfigurator, selected the appropriate driver, generic multisync, probed and selected default (1024x???).
&gt; 
&gt; I can start X no problems (either root or user). But approximately 5 mins into use the system locks up. CTRL-ALT-BKSP does not shut X down, can not ALT-F1 etc to another terminal. Only way I can get out is cold boot.
&gt; 
&gt; I am up to my ears in doco at the moment, and appreciate the very steep learning curve for Linux, but why would this X hang be so?
&gt; 
&gt; I am running XFree86-SVGA-3.3.2.3-25 (does this indicate an unstable version?) on RedHat 5.2 (the APC mag one ... 2.0.3 ??) on an Intel P2, generic mainbrd, 128Mb RAM ....
&gt; 
&gt; I have downloaded an newer version of XFree, but tha is on my Internet (able) puter and I have to figure out how to transfer from one to the other yet .... may have to resort to DOS and ARJ (please dont laugh) ... as it is 1.9Mb and I have not figured networking in Linux out yet, still reading the HOWTO.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA, Mike
