To all ( short summary of what I got out of the meeting)

Somebody was taking notes, so a summary will soon appear on the SAMG web
page
<A HREF="http://www.adelaide.net.au/~samg/">http://www.adelaide.net.au/~samg/</A>

Disclaimer: These are my own thoughts and impressions.

The meeting was attended by about 12 SAMG'ers and three visitors.
I have rung Gerard Industries.. and am getting further price, feature
and availability information sent in the post. Please email me if you
interested.

(Discussion at the end)

Physical/Data Links Layers
--------------------------

The C-Bus is a 2 wire bus, which consists of a 4 kHz signal pulse,
between which bit's are transmitted, biased to 32 V DC
eg.

+32.5V        +--+           +::+            +--+
              |  |           .  .            |  |
              |  |        Data? .            |  |
 30V  ---+  +-+  +------+--+-+--+-------+  +-+  +--
         |  |           .  .            |  |
         |  |           .  .            |  |
 27.5V   +--+           +::+            +--+

         |&lt;----------- 250 us ---------&gt;|


This allows for
1. An arbitary topology for the network. Because of the low frequency
   there is no need for termination. The physical layer can be viewed
   as an instantanious medium.  Loops in network don't cause any
   problems.

2. Unshielded Twisted Pair (Cat 5) is typically used in the system,
   and can be purchased from Clipsal in a range of colours (pink or
pink)

3. Restriction on total length of wire in network given by total
   capacitence.  Cat 5 allows for 1000m (that's 3 1/3 boxes of 305 m)
   Maximum of 100 devices. (Clipsal have obtained 110 devices in
workshop.)

Data representation:  1 - signal pulue,  0 - no pulse
[I'm guessing this.  It seem to me that a better protocol would
have an inverse pulse for 0, otherwise why have the clock pulse like
it is... now where's my CRO]

It was also mentioned that it was polarity sensitive.. I don't
understand why. Also.. I don't understand how it is 'collision
avoidence'. (see below)

Network Layer
-------------
The network is
Carrier Sense Multiple Access, Carrier Detect-Collision Avoidance
(CSMA/CD-CA)

Each device on the bus has a unique 8 bit address.
(Unlike IP, there is no broadcast address or default router address)

'Packet' Message format is of the following forms:

Header   (? bits)             Header   (? bits)
Control  (? bits)       Control  (? bits)
Data     (8 bits)       Data     (8 bits)
Checksum (? bits)       Checksum (? bits)
Dummy  (? bits)       Dummy    (? bits)
Ack  (? bits)       Ack      (? bits)
                Dummy    (? bits)

There is also a time division multiplexing mode, where the 256 devices
transmit bytes in a sequential repeating manner. (Called an MMI
request.)

Several busses can be connected together via 'bridges'.
These look like they can only connect two busses a single point,
as there doesn't seem to be any 'smarts' in the routing.

eg.   AA1  AA2   AA3  AA4  AA/BB  BB1  BB2  BB3  BB/CC  CC1  CC2  CC3
       +----+-----+----+---+   +---+----+----+---+   +---+----+----+

I'm assuming that you couldn't connect AA to CC as an alternative, as
messages to  CC from AA would be transmitted on both paths.
(Another question to ask.)

An example of a 'highrise' system was with a C-bus network on each
floor, with a TCP/IP backbone and interface connecting all the floors.

Devices
-------
These contain the Motorola HC05-B6 microprocessor with a 256k EEPROM
Each device contains:
- Type of unit (Key input, Relay, Dimmer, Clock etc.)
  (pre-programmed at Clipsal)
- Address (Group Address and Unit Address)
- Description (8 character, eg. 'bedroom')

Powered by 32V DC on bus, drawing 15 mA.

The Power supply/Sync signal unit supplies 300 mA -&gt; 20 units
Additional power supply/Sync signal units are required for more devices.

Switches
--------
The switch (push button) units can be programmed to send several
different messages depending on how they are activated.
eg.  Short on, Short off, Long on, Long off

Relays/Dimmers
--------------
Messages able to be transmitted across the network include:
Swith on, Swith off, Ramp up and ramp down (in t sec)


===========
Personal plans:

In order for the C-Bus network to work, it requires a sync signal
source (of which there may be more than one, on master with several
listening, able to switch on if needed)
This source is also the PC interface (RS232) which allows the various
devices to be individually programmed.

Using the real-time functions of Linux (available in the RTLinux
modules) and the parallel port, I would like to
1) Generate this sync signal  - relatively easy
2) Monitor the bus            - need to get interupt handler working
3) Talk to the bus            - decode C-bus protocol

This will enable me to avoid the $$ of this particular piece of
equipment, and allow me to talk to the bus directly.  Further
experimentation is then possible. (Ahh.. the possibilites
TCP/IP over C-Bus  :-)

Needed.. a 32V powersupply and the circuits to put signals on and off
of the bus.
===========

Some notes:
The C-bus system is relatively insecure.. anyone with access to the
bus can control all the devices on the it.  As C0buc is installed in
the Olympic Stadium for instance, this could give rise to an
interesting hack.

There are no plans for control of standard power points, or
controllers that could be plugged into power points to control
appliances like 'standard lamps' etc.

Units are expensive: ~$100 for the units.
