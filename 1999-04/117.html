&gt; Hypothesis:
&gt; - That Intellectual Property in the context of software, should be
&gt; regarded
&gt; as a liability rather than an asset.
&gt; 
&gt; Huh ?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Everything on balance, I would hypothesize that by running your commercial
&gt; project as open sourced, you are significantly reducing your costs without
&gt; compromising your income stream. That makes good business sense to me.
&gt; 
	Isn't that what Bill does?  He lets any old hacker, student etc get
hold of the Play Station source code - lets them play with it, they come up
with ideas, particularly new game ideas.  They lodge an appliation of
approval from Bill to have their idea recognised.  Bill pays them a slice of
the pie, he's happy because he doesn't have to look for ideas/code, they
come to him.  Of course no one can actually write a game and use in on play
station without the right bits (ha,ha) - otherwise known as IP because he
doesn't give that out or he'd sue if anyone tried to use it because he has
right to the actual play station.  So he controls part of the code - the
really important part and lets all else play with the rest.  That makes good
business sense to me.

	  To me, that's probably the fundamental difference between free
source code and open source code. 

	Natalia.
