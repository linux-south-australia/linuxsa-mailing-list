I get this inside of netscape too!
Try going to websites (tomshardware.com, theregister.co.uk come to mind)
which are created using MS stuff, and netscape in windows works fine,
but netscape 4.51 in linux shows up quote marks (",',`,those things) as
? instead.
I believe this is because non-standard html extensions are being used. 
you know, &amd; prints &, for instance. That's normal though.

MS "defined" a whole lot more though, and so lynx, netscape, mozilla,
etc. don't really like it, because they use real standards.

Does anyone know where Microsoft publish all their variations on
standards?

I mean, If I was to write a word processor or web browser, and I wanted
to make it load MS Word documents or MS Frontpage web pages, how would I
go about it?

I'm also interested in making a convertor for work, as manually editting
frontpage htms isn't very productive usage of time!

&gt; I have just noticed that a lot of simple text files are being stuffed up by
&gt; certain MS applications.
&gt; 
&gt; With the apostrophe character (0x27), things like Outlook, notepad, write,
&gt; word, etc are writing a 0x92 into the output stream rather than a 0x27.
&gt; 
&gt; Any reasonable program (Netscape, vi, emacs, old DOS edit) has no idea how
&gt; to deal with a 0x92.
&gt; 
&gt; Outlook, word, etc render the 0x92 exactly the same as a 0x27, and therefore
&gt; I cannot see that this 'MS-enhancement' adds any value to the 'enhanced'
&gt; document (except of course to stuff up the viewing of that document inside
&gt; Netscape).
&gt; 
&gt; Question:
&gt; - Are there any other stupid characters like this that you are aware of   ?
