Hi all,

Just to skew the argument some more.... ;-P

&gt;&gt; &gt; heh, yeah. The Cyrix processors are really chip, and stable too, but

&gt;&gt; sorry - but I beg to differ.
&gt;
&gt;I differ with your differ ;-)
&gt;
&gt;32bit and floating point - I had a p200 for ages, playing quake2 (heavy
&gt;floating point), and thought it was ok, until I saw an Pentium 200
&gt;running quake2.

I'll admit that the p200+'s were pretty poor 
(they were actually 150Mhz in speed anyway).
Furthermore, the 75Mhz bus-speed p200+s were absolute
rubbish (extremely unstable) and they had some major
overheating problems. In fact, we have already cooked, 
sold or disposed of any that we did have.

However, the earlier 686's (p120,p166) are quite reliable,
quick enough on the maths side and really only lacking in
"cool gameplay" aspects (which worries me little if I get good
uptimes on servers). At the very least, they were worth the
[1/3 cost of Pentium] prices we paid for them at the time.

And more recently, I have found the 300s and 333s to be a great
improvement on the 200 range and haven't had a problem with them
so far. (Once again, they're quick(er), they're stable and 
they're cheap)

I haven't yet had the chance to work with a K6 chip, but
they seem to have a good rep with most of the sysadmins
I know who have used them.

Just my $0.02 :-)

&gt;
&gt;Same with building kernel images I was amazed at the speed increase whrn
&gt;using a K6-233 over A P200. Yes it should be faster, but "damn!"
&gt;
&gt;IMHO The K6 or pentium whups serious cyrix butt, Especially under Linux
&gt;and after all, that is what this group is about ;-)
&gt;
&gt;We still use all three though. No point throwing out a working chip.
&gt;
&gt;Now if I can find a m/b that actually supports the voltage for the new
&gt;K6-2/475 Beasty I'll be happy ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm. damn, got dragged into a "mines better than yours" didn't I.
