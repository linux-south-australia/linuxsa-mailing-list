This was posted to me, and is perhaps as amusing as it is informative...
It provides an explanation for the reports we saw earlier, anyway.

&gt;   Linux camp slashes out at 'NT beats Linux' survey
&gt; 
&gt;   A Microsoft-sponsored test has 'proved' that the combination of Windows NT and Microsoft Internet
&gt;   Information Server outperform Linux and Apache as a Web server, and Linux and Samba as an SMB
&gt;   file server. Unsurprisingly the survey has come under withering (and, it appears, justified) fire from the
&gt;   Linux camp. 
&gt; 
&gt;   The test was carried out by Mindcraft, Inc., whose previous greatest hits include providing evidence
&gt;   that supported Microsoft's claims that it was all Apple's fault that Quicktime didn't work with Internet
&gt;   Explorer. The outfit concludes that NT 4.0 is 2.5 times faster than Linux as a file server and 3.7 times
&gt;   faster as a Web server. Presumably this means that an awful lot of customers out there are just plain stupid.
&gt;   NT isn't exactly the world's Web server of choice, whereas Apache is. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Mindcraft's results somewhat cheekily suggest that NT is more scalable than Linux, and show NT's
&gt;   NetBench throughput starting to climb above Linux at 32 users. We could note here that even on
&gt;   Microsoft's figures this indicates that Linux is a more appropriate fileserver for most small businesses
&gt;   than NT, but the Linux people are already pointing out that Mindcraft's Linux installation was maimed.
&gt;   We'd be the last to suggest this was deliberate of course. 
&gt; 
&gt;   If it wasn't the case that the installation was effectively crippled, then the results are still difficult to
&gt;   credit. NT is repeatedly criticised for scalability limitations, and Microsoft itself has repeatedly
&gt;   promised scalability improvements for the product. Steve Ballmer himself did so again, just last week,
&gt;   at WinHEC. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Here's another little bit of cheek from Mindcraft: "The Linux 2.2.x kernel is not well supported and is
&gt;   still changing rapidly? We started the tests using Red Hat Linux 5.2 but had to upgrade it to the Linux
&gt;   2.2.2 kernel because its Linux 2.0.36 kernel does not support hardware RAID controllers and SMP at
&gt;   the same time. In addition, there are comments in the Red Hat Linux 5.2 source code noting that the
&gt;   SMP code is effectively Beta-level code and should not be used at the same time as the RAID driver.
&gt;   For this reason, we upgraded to the Linux 2.2.2 kernel, which has full support for both hardware RAID
&gt;   controllers and SMP to be used simultaneously. As of the date this report was written, Red Hat did
&gt;   not ship or support a product based on the Linux 2.2.x kernel." 
&gt; 
&gt;   There's certainly some justification for this, but look who's talking. For inexperienced users it's
&gt;   probably reasonable to say that the installation of a large-scale Linux server system supporting both
&gt;   RAID and SMP is non-trivial, and this isn't helped by the fact that Linux is very much a moving target.
&gt;   But an inexperienced user who tries to do this, rather than hiring experienced Linux support that
&gt;   knows what it's doing, is a maniac. A user without serious NT experience trying to do so is the same. 
&gt;   In support of its case, Mindcraft lists six Linux kernel updates so far this year. We know from the
&gt;   Halloween papers that Microsoft really sees this development momentum as a massive advantage for
&gt;   Linux, so flipping it on its head in this way is cynicism of heroic proportions. There is of course
&gt;   absolutely no danger that NT users will be threatened by anything like this rate of change - mind you,
&gt;   those NT service packs just seem to keep coming. 
&gt; 
&gt;   The main challenge to the Mindcraft report however comes at the technical level. According to the
&gt;   Linux Weekly News critique: "no adjustments were made to the 'bdflush' and 'file system cache size'
&gt;   parameters supported by the 2.2 kernel," possibly accounting for a factor of two performance
&gt;   improvement in Samba, which was used for the fileserver test, when these are set correctly. The
&gt;   survey also used Windows clients rather than NT - Windows clients will tend to drive the results in
&gt;   favour of NT, while NT clients go better with Samba. 
&gt; 
&gt;   LWN continues: "Their Samba configuration sets the widelinks parameter to 'no'. This setting
&gt;   increases the system call overhead for file name lookups considerably. The penalty is especially
&gt;   severe on SMP systems. 
&gt; 
&gt;   "Their Apache configuration disables KeepAlive, an important real-world optimisation. (It has been
&gt;   pointed out that the tests do not use KeepAlive in any case). The Apache configuration is also not
&gt;   suited to large loads. It initially starts 10 servers, and MinSpareServers is set to 1. In particular, quick
&gt;   response to sudden, heavy loads will be reduced by this configuration. It is not an 'enterprise'
&gt;   configuration." 
&gt; 
&gt;   Eric Green at Slashdot meanwhile points out that the system was probably running out of file handles,
&gt;   and that increasing them would improve performance, while there's also a possibility that running both
&gt;   systems on the same disk (which was the case with the test) would give whichever system was on
&gt;   the outer part of the disk a 1.5-2 times transfer rate advantage. 
&gt; 
&gt;   Mindcraft's claims that it searched for support in newsgroups have also been questioned. According to
&gt;   Samba project member Jeremy Allison: "I just did searches on DejaNews in comp.protocols.smb, the
&gt;   samba mailing lists and also in the samba-bugs Jitterbug database (isn't it nice that we keep records
&gt;   of all email we get :-) looking for a request for help from Mindcraft with respect to their benchmark
&gt;   tests. Or even *any* email from Mindcraft. The only Mindcraft references I found were discussions of
&gt;   their previous benchmark trashing Syntax running on Solaris when benchmarked against Windows
&gt;   NT."
