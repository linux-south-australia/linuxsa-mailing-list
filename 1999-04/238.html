Hang on.  I can buy a machine with Linux pre-installed.

It is actually easier to install RedHat Linux than to install
Windows.  The difference being that most users never install
Windows.

And isn't RPM a shrink-wrap installation tool?

Installing StarOffice was no more difficult for the
average user than installing MS Office.  Installing
WordPerfect wasn't a big ask either.

&gt; Large IT departments expect to be able to insert
&gt; a half-dozen CDs in rapid succession to build a machine containing the
&gt; standard operating environment, which will almost certainly include
&gt; operating system, email, word processor, spreadsheet, terminal emulator
&gt; nodding our head in agreement that this is easy under Windows...

Actually it is not.  It takes two weeeks for our
staff to build an Window NT "image" that is then
distributed onto the machines.  Beacuse of Windows'
registry, it is difficult to remotely upgrade the
OS or applications -- it is much simpler to reinstall
the lot, discarding any data the user may have had
on the hard disk.

In contrast, it took us one week to build the RedHat
install procedure -- and this was our first go at
it, so it will be less next year.  OS and application
upgrades can be safely remotely installed using ssh
and RPM.  Most of the week was spent converting
non-RPM packages.

We were surprised by the difference in administration
costs.  Our theory is that the UNIX command line
environment is a drawback for a single machine
install of a single package, but is powerfully
useful when installing multiple packages or on
multiple machines.

We also expect the RedHat machines to be more
stable, as their is little a user can do that
will effect subsequent users of the machine.
This isn't true of Windows95, and is barely true
of WindowsNT.


The real problems for Linux are:

 - each application differs in user interface
   detail.

 - lack of mindshare.
