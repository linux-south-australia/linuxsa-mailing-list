 &gt; If I invent a machine and patent it, and you come along and improve it. Your

 &gt; original and sell it, incorporating your ideas, without compensating you in
 &gt; any way. The same holds true for music. You improve my song and release it,
 &gt; you pay me royalties, but I can release your new version/interpretation
 &gt; without paying you royalties.
 &gt; I wonder if the same could apply to software.

Software patents are legal in the US (and only the US, thankfully).  They're
one of the worst blights on innovation and free competition imaginable.

Software patents lead to companies doing stupid things like patenting
a method of using color to highlight importance in lists of objects
(IBM has that one and has a string of litigation behind it to defend
it;  piss off IBM and they'll sue you for violating that one if they
can't sue you for anything else) or patenting the idea of proxy servers.

Software patents can cover an entire class of applications, so that
any third party attempting to compete with you by designing their own
software which does the same thing as yours (and hence infringes your
patent) can be sued.

They are a huge danger for open-source software;  Example:  KDE and Gnome
try to do things that MS Windows does, so they probably infringe on 
some of Microsoft's software patents.  It is probable that MS can choose
to enforce those patents at any time and collect retrospective damages
(from whom?  Who knows.  Whoever they name as a defendant, probably one
or a number of developers).  Wherever an open-source package competes
with a commercial package, software patents have the potential to let
the air out of the open-source tyres.

They're unimaginably evil;  Even Silicon Valley is slowly coming around
to that.  The rest of the world thinks the US's software patents are a
complete joke.  The "idea" and the "expression of the idea" are too close
together in software for patents to work.
