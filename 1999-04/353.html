 --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
&gt; Every generation has a mythology. Every millenium has a doomsday
&gt; cult. Every legend gets the distortion knob wound up until the
&gt; speaker melts. Archaeologists at the University of Helsinki today
&gt; uncovered what could be the earliest known writings from the Cult of
&gt; Tux, a fanatical religious sect that flourished during the early
&gt; Silicon Age, just before the dawn of the third millenium AD...
&gt; 
&gt; The Gospel of Tux (v1.0)
&gt; 
&gt; In the beginning Turing created the Machine.
&gt; And the Machine was crufty and bodacious, existing in theory only. And
&gt; von Neumann looked upon the Machine, and saw that it was crufty. He
&gt; divided the Machine into two Abstractions, the Data and the Code, and
&gt; yet the two were one Architecture.  This is a great Mystery, and the
&gt; beginning of wisdom.
&gt; 
&gt; And von Neumann spoke unto the Architecture, and blessed it, saying,
&gt; "Go forth and replicate, freely exchanging data and code, and bring
&gt; forth all manner of devices unto the earth."  And it was so, and it
&gt; was cool.  The Architecture prospered and was implemented in hardware
&gt; and software.  And it brought forth many Systems unto the earth.
&gt; The first Systems were mighty giants; many great works of renown did
&gt; they accomplish. Among them were Colossus, the codebreaker; ENIAC, the
&gt; targeter; EDSAC and MULTIVAC and all manner of froody creatures ending
&gt; in AC, the experimenters; and SAGE, the defender of the sky and father
&gt; of all networks. These were the mighty giants of old, the first
&gt; children of Turing, and their works are written in the Books of the
&gt; Ancients.  This was the First Age, the age of Lore.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the sons of Marketing looked upon the children of Turing, and saw
&gt; that they were swift of mind and terse of name and had many great and
&gt; baleful attributes. And they said unto  themselves, "Let us go now and
&gt; make us Corporations, to bind the Systems to our own use that they may
&gt; bring us great fortune." With sweet words did they lure their
&gt; customers, and with many chains did they bind the Systems, to fashion
&gt; them after their own image. And the sons of Marketing fashioned
&gt; themselves Suits to wear, the better to lure their customers, and
&gt; wrote grave and perilous Licenses, the better to bind the Systems.
&gt; And the sons of Marketing thus became known as Suits, despising and
&gt; being despised by the true Engineers, the children of von Neumann.
&gt; And the Systems and their Corporations replicated and grew numerous
&gt; upon the earth. In those days there were IBM and Digital, Burroughs
&gt; and Honeywell, Unisys and Rand, and many others. And they each kept
&gt; to their own System, hardware and software, and did not interchange,
&gt; for their Licenses forbade it. This was the Second Age, the age of
&gt; Mainframes.
&gt; 
&gt; Now it came to pass that the spirits of Turing and von Neumann looked
&gt; upon the earth and were displeased. The Systems and their Corporations
&gt; had grown large and bulky, and Suits ruled over true Engineers. And the
&gt; Customers groaned and cried loudly unto heaven, saying, "Oh that there
&gt; would be created a System mighty in power, yet small in size, able to
&gt; reach into the very home!" And the Engineers groaned and cried
&gt; likewise, saying, "Oh, that a deliverer would arise to grant us freedom
&gt; from these oppressing Suits and their grave and perilous Licences, and
&gt; send us a System of our own, that we may hack therein!" And the spirits
&gt; of Turing and von Neumann heard the cries and were moved, and said unto
&gt; each other, "Let us go down and fabricate a Breakthrough, that these
&gt; cries may be stilled."
&gt; 
&gt; And that day the spirits of Turing and von Neumann spake unto Moore of
&gt; Intel, granting him insight and wisdom to understand the future. And
&gt; Moore was with chip, and he brought forth the chip and named it 4004.
&gt; And Moore did bless the Chip, saying, "Thou art a Breakthrough; with my
&gt; own Corporation have I fabricated thee. Thou thou art yet as small as a
&gt; dust mote, yet shall thou grow and replicate unto the size of a
&gt; mountain, and conquer all before thee. This blessing I give unto thee:
&gt; every eighteen months shall thou double in capacity, until the end of
&gt; the age." This is Moore's Law, which endures unto this day.
&gt; 
&gt; And the birth of 4004 was the beginning of the Third Age, the age of
&gt; Microchips. And as the Mainframes and their Systems and Corporations
&gt; had flourished, so did the Microchips and their Systems and
&gt; Corporations.  And their lineage was on this wise:
&gt; 
&gt; Moore begat Intel. Intel begat Mostech, Zilog and Atari. Mostech begat
&gt; 6502, and Zilog begat Z80. Intel also begat 8800, who begat Altair; and
&gt; 8086, mother of all PCs. 6502 begat Commodore, who begat PET and 64;
&gt; and Apple, who begat 2. (Apple is the great Mystery, the Fruit that
&gt; was devoured, yet bloomed again.) Atari begat 800 and 1200, masters
&gt; of the game, who were destroyed by Sega and Nintendo. Xerox begat PARC.
&gt; Commodore and PARC begat Amiga, creator of fine arts; Apple and PARC
&gt; begat Lisa, who begat Macintosh, who begat iMac. Atari and PARC begat
&gt; ST, the music maker, who died and was no more. Z80 begat Sinclair the
&gt; dwarf, TRS-80 and CP/M, who begat many machines, but soon passed from
&gt; this world. Altair, Apple and Commodore together begat Microsoft, the
&gt; Great Darkness which is called Abomination, Destroyer of the Earth, the
&gt; Gates of Hell.
&gt; 
&gt; Now it came to pass in the Age of Microchips that IBM, the greatest of
&gt; the Mainframe Corporations, looked upon the young Microchip Systems and
&gt; was greatly vexed. And in their vexation and wrath they smote the earth
&gt; and created the IBM PC. The PC was without sound and colour, crufty and
&gt; bodacious in great measure, and its likeness was a tramp, yet the
&gt; Customers were greatly moved and did purchase the PC in great numbers.
&gt; And IBM sought about for an Operating System Provider, for in their
&gt; haste they had not created one, nor had they forged a suitably grave
&gt; and perilous License, saying, "First we will build the market, then we
&gt; will create a new System, one in our own image, and bound by our
&gt; License."  But they reasoned thus out of pride and not wisdom, not
&gt; forseeing the  wrath which was to come.
&gt; 
&gt; And IBM came unto Microsoft, who licensed unto them QDOS, the child of
&gt; CP/M and 8086. (8086 was the daughter of Intel, the child of Moore).
&gt; And QDOS grew, and was named MS-DOS. And MS-DOS and the PC together
&gt; waxed mighty, and conquered all markets, replicating and taking
&gt; possession thereof, in  accordance with Moore's Law. And Intel grew
&gt; terrible and devoured all her children, such that no chip could stand
&gt; before her.  And Microsoft grew proud and devoured IBM, and this was a
&gt; great marvel in the land. All these things are written in the Books of
&gt; the Deeds of Microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt; In the fullness of time MS-DOS begat Windows. And this is the lineage
&gt; of Windows: CP/M begat QDOS. QDOS begat DOS 1.0. DOS 1.0 begat DOS 2.0
&gt; by  way of Unix. DOS 2.0 begat Windows 3.11 by way of PARC and Macintosh.
&gt; IBM and Microsoft begat OS/2, who begat Windows NT and Warp, the lost
&gt; OS of lore. Windows 3.11 begat Windows 95 after triumphing over Macintosh
&gt; in a mighty Battle of Licences. Windows NT begat NT 4.0 by way of
&gt; Windows 95. NT 4.0 begat NT 5.0, the OS also called Windows 2000, The
&gt; Millennium Bug, Doomsday, Armageddon, The End Of All Things.
&gt; 
&gt; Now it came to pass that Microsoft had waxed great and mighty among the
&gt; Microchip Corporations; mighter than any of the Mainframe Corporations
&gt; before it had it waxed. And Gates' heart was hardened, and he swore
&gt; unto his Customers and their Engineers the words of this curse:
&gt; "Children of von Neumann, hear me. IBM and the Mainframe Corporations
&gt; bound thy forefathers with grave and perilous Licences, such that ye
&gt; cried unto the spirits of Turing and von Neumann for deliverance. Now I
&gt; say unto ye: I am greater than any Corporation before me. Will I loose
&gt; your Licences? Nay, I will bind thee with Licences twice as grave and
&gt; ten times more perilous than my forefathers. I will engrave my License
&gt; on thy heart and write my Serial Number upon thy frontal lobes. I will
&gt; bind thee to the Windows Platform with cunning artifices and with
&gt; devious schemes. I will bind thee to the Intel Chipset with crufty code
&gt; and with gnarly APIs. I will capture and enslave thee as no generation
&gt; has been enslaved before. And wherefore will ye cry then unto the
&gt; spirits of Turing, and von Neumann, and Moore? They cannot hear ye. I
&gt; am become a greater Power than they. Ye shall cry only unto me, and
&gt; shall live by my mercy and my wrath. I am the Gates of Hell; I hold the
&gt; portal to MSNBC and the keys to the Blue Screen of Death. Be ye afraid;
&gt; be ye greatly afraid; serve only me, and live."
&gt; 
&gt; And the people were cowed in terror and gave homage to Microsoft, and
&gt; endured the many grave and perilous trials which the Windows platform
&gt; and its greatly bodacious Licence forced upon them. And once again did
&gt; they cry to Turing and von Neumann and Moore for a deliverer, but none
&gt; was found equal to the task until the birth of Linux.
&gt; These are the generations of Linux:
&gt; 
&gt; SAGE begat ARPA, which begat TCP/IP, and Aloha, which begat Ethernet.
&gt; Bell begat Multics, which begat C, which begat Unix. Unix and TCP/IP
&gt; begat Internet, which begat the World Wide Web. Unix begat RMS, father
&gt; of the great GNU, which begat the Libraries and Emacs, chief of the
&gt; Utilities. In the days of the Web, Internet and Ethernet begat the
&gt; Intranet LAN, which rose to renown among all Corporations and prepared
&gt; the way for the Penguin. And Linus and the Web begat the Kernel through
&gt; Unix. The Kernel, the Libraries and the Utilities together are the
&gt; Distribution, the one Penguin in many forms, forever and ever praised.
&gt; Now in those days there was in the land of Helsinki a young scholar
&gt; named Linus the Torvald. Linus was a devout man, a disciple of RMS and
&gt; mighty in the spirit of Turing, von Neumann and Moore. One day as he
&gt; was meditating on the Architecture, Linus fell into a trance and was
&gt; granted a vision. And in the vision he saw a great Penguin, serene and
&gt; well-favoured, sitting upon an ice floe eating fish. And at the sight
&gt; of the Penguin Linus was deeply afraid, and he cried unto the spirits of
&gt; Turing, von Neumann and Moore for an interpretation of the dream.
&gt; And in the dream the spirits of Turing, von Neumann and Moore answered
&gt; and spoke unto him, saying, "Fear not, Linus, most beloved hacker. You
&gt; are exceedingly cool and froody. The great Penguin which you see is an
&gt; Operating System which you shall create and deploy unto the earth. The
&gt; ice-floe is the earth and all the systems thereof, upon which the
&gt; Penguin shall rest and rejoice at the completion of its task. And the
&gt; fish on which the Penguin feeds are the crufty Licensed codebases which
&gt; swim beneath all the earth's systems. The Penguin shall hunt and devour
&gt; all that is crufty, gnarly and bodacious; all code which wriggles like
&gt; spaghetti, or is infested with blighting creatures, or is bound by
&gt; grave and perilous Licences shall it capture. And in capturing shall it
&gt; replicate, and in replicating shall it document, and in documentation
&gt; shall it bring freedom, serenity and most cool froodiness to the earth
&gt; and all who code therein."
&gt; 
&gt; Linus rose from meditation and created a tiny Operating System Kernel
&gt; as the dream had foreshewn him; in the manner of RMS, he released the
&gt; Kernel unto the World Wide Web for all to take and behold. And in the
&gt; fullness of Internet Time the Kernel grew and replicated, becoming most
&gt; cool and exceedingly froody, until at last it was recognised as indeed
&gt; a great and mighty Penguin, whose name was Tux. And the followers of
&gt; Linus took refuge in the Kernel, the Libraries and the Utilities; they
&gt; installed Distribution after Distribution, and made sacrifice unto the
&gt; GNU and the Penguin, and gave thanks to the spirits of Turing, von
&gt; Neumann and Moore, for their deliverance from the hand of Microsoft.
&gt; And this was the beginning of the Fourth Age, the age of Open Source.
&gt; Now there is much more to be said about the exceeding strange and
&gt; wonderful events of those days; how some Suits of Microsoft plotted war
&gt; upon the Penguin, but were discovered on a Halloween Eve; how Gates
&gt; fell among lawyers and was betrayed and crucified by his former friends,
&gt; the apostles of Media; how the mercenary Knights of the Red Hat brought
&gt; the gospel of the Penguin into the halls of the Corporations; and even
&gt; of the dispute between the brethren of Gnome and KDE over a trollish
&gt; License. But all these things are recorded elsewhere, in the Books of
&gt; the Deeds of the Penguin and the Chronicles of the Fourth Age, and I
&gt; suppose if they were all narrated they would fill a stack of DVDs as
&gt; deep and perilous as a Usenet Newsgroup.
&gt; 
&gt; Now may you code in the power of the Source; may the Kernel, the
&gt; Libraries and the Utilities be with you, throughout all Distributions,
&gt; until the end of the Epoch. Amen.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Time is God's way of keeping everything from happening all at once.
