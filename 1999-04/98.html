 &gt; However, having said that, how unique do MAC addresses need to be?

ARP is all about "direct" connectivity -- theoretically, the hosts you
can receive ARP information about consist of that set of hosts which
will fall off their desks if you pull your ethernet cable hard enough.

Don't try that at home.  It should be ok at work, but not at home.
:-)

If you have more than one ethernet cable, yanking different cables
will cause different sets of machines to get pulled from their desks.
The machines are in different "physical address spaces", and those
physical address spaces are non-overlapping.

 &gt; I had asserted that they only need to be locally unique.
 &gt; There are three situations I can think of:
 &gt; 1. Duplicate MAC addresses on the same segment. Danger Will Robinson.

Indeed - This will not work. Related:  Duplicate MAC addresses on 
both sides of a bridge won't work either.

 &gt; 2. Duplicate MAC addresses on different segments separated by a router:
 &gt; 
 &gt;     11:22:33:44:55:66                      11:22:33:44:55:66
 &gt;            -----------------[Router]------------------ 
 &gt; 
 &gt;    Here, whether or not this will work depends on how ARP is implemented,
 &gt;    it seems. A check on a Linux 2.0.3x system I have access to shows that
 &gt;    ARP keeps the interface with the MAC address and IP in the ARP table.
 &gt;    So, it suggests that this situation will work, but without looking at
 &gt;    the code, I cannot be sure.

It's important to note how the ARP table is used before working out
whether this will be happy or not.  It's useful to go through the 
motions of transmitting a network packet to illustrate why the case
you've provided above should work fine.

Whe you want to transmit an IP packet, the kernel starts by consulting
its routing table.  The routing table contains two main subdivisions of
information:  Stuff which says, "To reach this network, go via that router
over there," and stuff which says, "To reach this host, use this network
interface."  The former are called network routes, the latter are host
routes.  When your system wants to send to a foreign network it notionally
works out which router to use then does another lookup to work out which
network interface that router can be reached through (although sane
implementations of IP routing merge the two together by noting that the
only difference between a host route and a network route is the route's
netmask, so you only really need one lookup -- But I'm talking about 
concepts here, not hard implementations).

If the routing table says that a given destination is directly reachable
via an ethernet (or ATM, or FDDI, or whatever) interface, the next step
is to work out the network access layer address of the station you're
trying to reach.  IP addresses are only useful when hosts are communicating
with IP, but IP packets need to be sent using lower-level protocols like
Ethernet 802.3, so you need Ethernet 802.3 addresses to send datagrams.

The ARP table acts as a translation table between internet layer addresses
and network access layer addresses (e.g.: IP -&gt; Ethernet, Appletalk -&gt; ATM,
whatever).  By the time the ARP table is consulted, the transmitting host
already knows which destination IP address it wants to reach (duh!) and
the interface it needs to use to reach it (due to info from the routing
table).

When you pop those two bits of info into the ARP table, you should
only get back one answer (i.e.: one hardware address) even if the
hardware address exists on multiple local networks.  The reason for this
is that ARP lookups are made on the tuple of (dst-ip-address, interface),
so if a MAC address exists on more than one interface different answers
will come back depending on which interface you're asking about.

The result of the ARP lookup is, of course, a network access layer address,
such as an ethernet MAC address.  That's what you need to send the packet,
so the world can continue :-)

The only part of the story left is the question of how the ARP table
is populated in the first place.  Again, this is done in an
interface-sensitive fashion: 

  1)  If an ARP query comes in for an (ip, interface) pair which isn't
      currently in the ARP table, an "ARP WHOHAS" broadcast will be
      transmitted on the nominated interface (not all interfaces, just
      the one we know we want to talk through).

  2)  The ARP reply arrives on the same interface the WHOHAS query was
      transmitted on;  the info in that reply is used to construct an
      (ip-address, interface, mac-address) tuple for insertion into the
      ARP table.

So entries are inserted into the table in a way which preserves the
mapping between network interface and MAC address;  So you should be
able to put the same MAC address into the same table more than once.

Anyway, that was the long answer.  The short answer is that scenario
(2) should work. :-)

 &gt; 3. Duplicate MAC addresses with two or more routers between them:
 &gt; 
 &gt;   11:22:33:44:55:66                                        11:22:33:44:55:66
 &gt;    ------------------[Router1]---------------------[Router2]----------------
 &gt; 	Segment1 		     Segment2				Segment3
 &gt; 
 &gt;    This should work, but I would not suggest trying it.

&lt;shrug&gt;  No skin off anyone's nose;  it'll work fine. You'd probably
want to be careful moving hosts around from network to network, though :-)

Throughout these discussions, keep in mind the fact that MAC addresses
aren't really unique at all.  As has been previously noted, they're 
settable in software with the vast majority of ethernet NICs, but even
without that fact duplicates *have* slipped through.

Things which complicate these pictures:  Proxy ARP (whereby you can 
receive ARP info about a host which isn't actually on your ethernet
at all) and VLANs (where the MAC address takes on a whole new importance).

 &gt; So, my question is, can anyone state that 2 above will not work (in some
 &gt; cases)?

Nope. :-)  Only with broken ARP implementations.  There are probably
quite a lot of them, though.
