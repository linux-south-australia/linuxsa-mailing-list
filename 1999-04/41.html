&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So it would be interesting to see what it turns out to be.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Given that it is a virus, there is every chance that the
&gt; &gt; &gt;MAC address is that of the sender, not of the originator of
&gt; &gt; &gt;the document.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hmmmm, sure makes sense: Word is open and can re-save the offending doc 
&gt; &gt; (and macro) with a new GUID (I suppose), or the virus could add the info 
&gt; &gt; itself.
&gt;
&gt;But the virus doesn't re-save itself before passing itself on, so that
&gt;isn't really relevent.  

In this case, maybe (hence the "I suppose"), but we were talking 
theoretically. That's why I went on with "However, ...", and gave the URL 
of an article which contained interesting information WRT the GUID in the 
offending doc.

A _future_ variant may well force a re-save to change the GUID (if 
possible: I don't "do" M$ ;), _or_ change the GUID itself. That was the 
point being made: don't jump to conclusions re the GUID.

The creator(s)/transmitter(s) may have out-smarted themselves this time, 
and then again, they might not have.
