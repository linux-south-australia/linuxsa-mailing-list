Just an update on the situation. Still nothing definite, but looks good.

Sounds like people are interested, so I spoke to our IT guy in
Melbourne. He said that the preferred option was for them to go into the
big green bin out the back. When I told him that people from LinuxSA
were interested in them, he liked the idea that they would go to someone
who could make use of them. He has to get approval from management in
Canberra and his only concern is that when management hear that they
could be useful to someone that they will want to sell them. We'll have
to wait a little longer.

BTW, for those that need more info, I did a quick search and found this:

&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; At work we are getting rid of the last of our old Digital VT-220 and
&gt; VT-320 terminals. After it actually cost work to dispose of them last
&gt; time I may be able to get hold of some or all of them, but this is not
&gt; definite. Are people interested in them (maybe free, maybe a nominal $
&gt; amount)?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course they are all old, some have burnt-in screens and discoloured
&gt; cases, but all work. If anyone is interested I will do some more
&gt; enquiring. Please email me if you are interested. There is no obligation
&gt; at this time (including on my part).
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Peter.
