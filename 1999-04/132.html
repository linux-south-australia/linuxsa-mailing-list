&gt;Try www.netcraft.com.au.


 I'm not aware that the above company offers any "cheap burns"
 like the questioner was seeking... last time I checked it's price
 list, they had only the more expensive shrink-wrap boxed items,
 as well as a "take it or leave it" attitude vis a vis subdistribution
 (buy at least "n" to get any wholesale pricing at all, and the mar-
 gins offered were very modest, at best).

 Surely, there are people around that are buring CD-ROM's for
 much less than you'd pay for "shrink wrap" in Adelaide...

 I think the asker will have to take his business interstate, if not
 overseas, for the kind of pricing he's looking for.

 Adelaide is *not* the place to seek Value-for-Money IHMO,
 (except in housing, perhaps...)

 If interstate people are the only ones willing to organise their
 businesses for "mass" markets (i.e. the ones that move boxes
 out the door in such quanitities that the unit cost drops), then
 that's where to buy "cheap burns"

 In fairness to the GDB's of this world, there seems to be a
 clear service -vs- price trade-off at work here... but, again,
 our asker did not seem to be seeking service, just now.

&gt;&gt; does anyone know of a place that sells burns of the redhat-contrib
&gt;&gt; stuff? particularly glibc, gimp, gnome, kde, etc.
&gt;&gt; preferably in adelaide, and preferably cheap. (obviously!)
