&gt; There are already standards in the arena of home automation. One of those
&gt; is X-10 (I think), which has the disadvantage that it is based around using
&gt; power lines for signalling. Another standard is in the works as well. Both
&gt; of these standards are from the US.

Hi.

I don't know much about this, but I've read an article some time ago that
talked about it.

I think presently there are 2 stable standards on home automation, one that
uses power lines for signaling and another that requires dedicated cabling.

The one that uses power lines is X-10 and, I think, that is it's main
advantage, because it doesn't require the user to spend the money on new
cables. Besides it's easiest to install, because you already have power lines
all over.

The other is called, maybe, ERC (???) and I don't know much about it.

What I've read is: nothing is closed yet. Both of the standards have their
advantages and their disadvantages, and X-10 is pretty old now, so, I think
everyone is looking for something that can boost the integration of several
things in out home. Is that a new standard that their looking for? I think so,
but it has to avoid the inconveniences of both standards already available.

Why can't that new standard be from Australia? I'm not Australian, don't ask
me! But I don't see any particular reason . . .
