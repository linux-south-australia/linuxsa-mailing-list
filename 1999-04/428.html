Y'all !!,

 ...  Have got a problem with configuring network printer.
 It is a HP laserjet 4000, having an ethernet interface. TCP/IP
 stack is installed. IP address 192.134.115.199. The printer
 can be configured thru' win 95 machine and is printing via
 network. But when I tried to configure it from my linux box 
 using control-panel, it gave 3 options. 

 Local, Remote unix queue, or SMB. I am not aware of SMB at all
 but can easily say that this is not one of the first 2. This  
 printer is not connected to any local/remote Unix machine.  But I know nothing
 about this SMB. I can see that SMB client as well as SMBD are running
 in my linux box. But shd there be a SMBD running somewhere too? The
 SMB thing asks for the server name, IPaddress and the printer name.
 If a printer is connected to the network, where is this hostname for
 printserver coming into picture?? Also it asks for username and
 password. I understand that I have to give the netware username/password to
 print to a netware printer. But where shd I create the username
 and passwd in this case???

         |___|          |  B  | 
           |            |_____|
 ----------|---------------|-------------


 For eg. A is my linux box and B is the network printer,
 how can I print to B is my question simply put.
 If what I understand is wrong, (missing something)
 please educate me if you have time.

 Still worse is after configuration, my linux box allows me to
 print without any objection . But the material goes into
 some black hole.


Thanks and Rgds,
Sai.
