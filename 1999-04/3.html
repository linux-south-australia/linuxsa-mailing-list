	Hi all, I'm new to Linux and new to the list. Have used UNIX though.
&gt;   
&gt; No money from free software:
&gt; ---------------------------
&gt; I think that the linux software cluster survives mostly on
&gt; students who work for free, and hobbyists.
&gt; 
	I thought that's what Linux was intended for - hobbyists and
students in that it is an experiment in "evolution" of software without
restrictions placed on it by anyone other than the people who use it.  An
exercise in user-guided development without the involvement of capitalists?

	Sounds good anyway.
&gt;  
&gt; Open software, not free software:
&gt; --------------------------------
&gt; On the other hand, I would agree with you if you said that
&gt; the software was open but _not_ free.
&gt; 
	Linux code is officially "free".  The software package is made up of
more than the code eg. ideas, concepts.  It shouldn't be looked at as a form
money making anyway.  That's totally against the concept of Linux.  I paid
for the book so it tells me how to get the best out of Linux as an O/S and
as it develops there will be more and more need for a "user-manual".  Book
doesn't tell me much about how to develop the code which as far as I
understand it is the part of Linux which is "free".  The fact I got Linux
with the book is irrelevant, anyway.  Just saved me dowloading it.  Then
again, I may be too simplistic in my thinking of Linux at this stage.

	Cheers,
	Natalia Ford
