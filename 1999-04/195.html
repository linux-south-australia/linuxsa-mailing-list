&gt; Today Newscorp's Net News service carried the following snippet of a
&gt; story:

Reads a lot like slashdot a lot of the times now :).

&gt; 
&gt; LINUX DOESN'T DO EVERYTHING
&gt; 
&gt; Despite what its fans say, Linux isn't good for everything. A study by
&gt; D.H. Brown Associates says Linux is great for file and print servers,
&gt; Web servers, some number crunching and the low end of "thin" client
&gt; computers. It's not so good for large operations where robust
&gt; reliability is essential. The study is at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.dhbrown.com/dhbrown/linux.html">http://www.dhbrown.com/dhbrown/linux.html</A>

I have seen a couple of reports surrounding this.

It sites things like lack of SMP, HA options, etc...  Now we all know that
the Linux has 'kick-butt support for things like this.  So where did the 
report go wrong?

Looking at the scoring technique that they use, they are looking at 
'shrink-wrapped' products, penalising heavily if the end user has to source
product enhancements from external or non-shipped sources..   Hence RH 5.2,
and Caldera OpenLinux where based on their *out-of-the-box* statistics.
Consequently they scored low *against this scoring technique*.  The low score
that RH and Caldera got is fair for those products, unfair for the OSS 
community that builds the products.

I am sure an enterprise targetted system (which at this point in time 
would be needed to be hand built) would score *a lot* higher.

So unfortunately in the current Linux marketplace, the distributions are
more aimed at the user.  In time the enterprise targeted distributions will 
begin to map very closely what is expected - SMP, HA, and all that ilk.

In the marketplace that Linux is beginning to make inroads the mindset has
to change.  The report penalises against third-party products needed to be
included to achieve a particular feature-set.  In an environment where
companies like Red Hat and Caldera *package* existing OSS products (although
the do add some value themselves) the notion of 3rd party begins to be very
hard to define.

The OSS community consists of many third parties, but they are all working
together as effectively one vendor (which isn't really a vendor... Hmmm that
bends the mind doesn't it :).  I like to think (from an OSS point of view) 
that for a lot of OSS products...

	'The Community is The Vendor'

It is a pity, however, that Alan Farrely doesn't believe in giving the whole
picture, or applying a bit more depth to his summaries.  The comment he made
is very negative, and hides the particular points on which the comparison was
made.

Anyway, it will be interesting to see what the report cards say about the 
next versions of these products, where we *have* stable SMP, HA options 
all built into the kernel and the distributions.  Maybe RH 6.0 or whatever
distributions is pushing the OSS communities wares.

Regards,

Matt
