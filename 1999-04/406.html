Can you get a soundcard working?

Ideas:

Text Demo - Have a look at 'BB', a text mode demo that uses 'AA' the ASCII art
library
     (This made quite an impact at the lastLinuxSA installfest as I recall.)
[Has sound!]
Packet Sniffer - run 'tcpdump' and display the network traffic..
Kernel Compilation - demo how this works
Compilation Demo - 'Hello World' program
Countdown Clock to Y2K -  Have a program counting down the time till the
machine
  crashes :-)
Virtual Terminals (Alt-F1, Alt-F2, etc) - OK, everybody knows about this, but's
it's
   something uniquie to Linux.

Blinking Lights Demo - let me know if you're interested and I can post you
(snail mail)
   something.

Pitfalls:
RedHat won't install on a machine 4 Mb, although 8 Mb is enough.
Once install, the extra 4 Mb, can be removed (when off) and the machine will
still run quite happily.

Hope this helps,
Paul Schulz

&gt; Dear penguin people,
&gt; ASLUG (Alice Springs Linux User Group) have decided to have a display at our
&gt; local show in a couple of months time. We will have various systems running
&gt; stuff like Staroffice, Povray, Wine, email etc and anything else we can
&gt; think of. I was thinking of setting up an old 386 I had collecting dust just
&gt; to show that with Linux all things are possible.
&gt;
&gt; Stupid Question      Are all things still possible? Does RH5.2 still run on
&gt; an i386? According to Redhat it does but I know this is not something that
&gt; one usually bothers to try. Has anyone done it lately? Can anyone think of
&gt; any pitfalls, warnings etc?
&gt; Equally can anyone think of an application that is eyecatching enough to
&gt; amaze the square-eyed majority? I don't think a login prompt will start a
&gt; revolution.
&gt; The system will probably have 4 - 8 meg of ram, approx 100 - 200 meg hdd,
&gt; network card, old vga card (can it run on an ega card?? I have one ),
&gt; nicotine stains, lots of dust and definitely not be y2k compatible.
&gt; And, no I wasn't considering running X.
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks from north of the border.
