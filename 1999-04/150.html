Hi Guys,
	I was working on a Software Engineering Project through Flinders
University a couple of years ago on Smart Houses that were going to be used
in Mawson Lakes Estate when it was run by the MFP. We looked at exactly
this product and decided that it was great. If you might be interested in
smart houses or stuff like that, I well recommend going to this meeting.
Unfortunately I am working 4pm-Midnight tonight, otherwise I would be
there. &lt;sniff&gt;

	Cheers!
		Andrew.

&gt; 
&gt; I recieved this, if anyone is interested then feel free to go.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure how programmable the programmable is, but if we can
&gt; control it simply then we could all have 'smart' houses with large
&gt; amounts of uptime :)
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The April SAMG meeting will be held tomorrow night Friday 9/4/99. If
you
&gt; &gt; think any LinuxSA members may be interested you may wish to advise
them.
&gt; &gt; The meeting will be held at 8pm, Burnside Community Centre, Corner
Greenhill
&gt; &gt; an Portrush Roads. A description of the meeting is below.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The Clipsal C-Bus Automation system.
&gt; &gt; TIME: 8:00 p.m.
&gt; &gt; DATE: Friday April 9, 1999
&gt; &gt; PLACE: Burnside Council Community Centre cnr of Portrush and Greenhill
&gt; &gt; Roads, Burnside
&gt; &gt; SUBJECT: Clipsal C-Bus Automation system.
&gt; &gt; PRESENTER: Mr. Barry Walker
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The April meeting will be on the Clipsal C-Bus Automation System.
Please
&gt; &gt; note the change of venue, now at the Burnside Council Community Centre,
&gt; &gt; corner of Portrush and Greenhill Roads Burnside.
&gt; &gt; The C-Bus system is a fully programmable control system designed
primarily
&gt; &gt; to optimise lighting arrangements to save electricity cost. It also
provides
&gt; &gt; more flexible and efficient lighting operations compared to
conventional
&gt; &gt; lighting systems in multistorey buildings, offices and hotels. It also
has
&gt; &gt; application in the home, our talk last year on Mawson Lakes
demonstrated the
&gt; &gt; level of automation that may become standard in the near future.
&gt; &gt; The system is reliable and less expensive than comparable energy
management
&gt; &gt; systems and will radically simplify electrical installation practices.
&gt; &gt; Microprocessors are built into push button light switches which send
&gt; &gt; commands to the distributed load controllers to use only the lights
that are
&gt; &gt; needed. In its basic mode, C-Bus provides clever switching flexibility
&gt; &gt; compared to a conventional switch installation. When linked to a
personal
&gt; &gt; computer, C-Bus can monitor all lighting arrangements within a
multistorey
&gt; &gt; building and stop wasteful use of electricity. If utilised with
particular
&gt; &gt; C-Bus products, lighting arrangements can be adjusted to the degree of
&gt; &gt; natural light. Alternatively, lights can be programmed to function only
when
&gt; &gt; a person is in a room to a far more sophisticated level than with
&gt; &gt; conventional people sensors. Once installed, C-Bus offers enormous
potential
&gt; &gt; and possibilities in the future to link in security, climate control,
fire
&gt; &gt; alarms and irrigation control arrangements.
&gt; &gt; This should be a fascinating presentation on a locally developed
technology.
