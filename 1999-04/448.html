Solution = kernel level module loader.
Situations like this are why it was made.
Read the docs in /usr/src/linux/Documentation, and the help in the
kernel cfg, and make sure it's compiled in and enabled.
Then, the kernel will load modules (via modprobe and /etc/conf.modules)
whenever a call is going to be made.

I use this to load everything now. configure the netcard, and the
modules get loaded. play an mp3, and the soundcard gets loaded, etc. 
On machines with low ram, just make almost everything (except the
obvious things like ext2, etc.) a module, and let it load em and unload
em itself.
One note though - ip forwarding modules are excluded from this. You'll
need to do insmod ip_masq_icq manually still.

&gt; OK, an update to this...
&gt; 
&gt; I thought I my problem was the fact that I didn't have rarp compiled into
&gt; my kernel. I recompiled, making sure that I had the rarp module, and then I
&gt; realised that I already had the rarp module. (When I typed `rarp -av` it
&gt; said 'not supported by kernel' with both the original kernel and my new
&gt; one.) I realised that the rarp module wasn't being loaded, so I manually
&gt; set the rarp entry with tha `rarp -s` command and behold, it worked. The
&gt; rarp module loaded and the sun 3/60 booted, found it's IP via bootpd and
&gt; tftpd'ed it's kernel across the network.
&gt; 
&gt; Question. How can I get the rarp requests to load the module? Without the
&gt; module loaded, inetd doesn't even bother starting bootpd. It only works
&gt; when the rarp command prods kerneld to load the module. I'd prefer not to
&gt; kludge a solutions by getting a script calling insmod or some other hack,
&gt; I'd just like it to work properly.
&gt; 
&gt; I could always compile the code into a kernel, but that's the last resort!
&gt; 
&gt; (A solution I've thought of that I don't like, is to call insmod from
&gt; inetd, but I don't even know if inetd will call anything, cause it's not
&gt; supported by the kernel. Catch 22!)
&gt; 
&gt; Suggestions?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Has anyone come across some documentation for getting a Sun 3/60 to boot
&gt; &gt;&gt; off a linux Xserver.
&gt; &gt;Yeah, I used to have one. Or it might have been a sun 3/50, I really
&gt; &gt;don't remember any more.
&gt; &gt;But it worked fine, and I sold it to Nick and set up his linux machine
&gt; &gt;to handle it.
&gt; &gt;When I get home I'll dig out the stuff I used.
&gt; &gt;There's a package on the web to do it, but it's extremely outdated now,
&gt; &gt;and I don't really reccommend using most of it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Has anyone got it working?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I can see the rarp requests from the sun, but my bootps server (running
&gt; &gt;&gt; through inet) isn't responding. Probably buggered a config somewhere.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheers
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Alex!
