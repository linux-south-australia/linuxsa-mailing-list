Steven,

A very provoking thesis, however I refute an early assumption, that
software needs to be "_maintained_ by ever increasing amounts of
programming work." Perpaps in a highly competitive market, such as
word processors and web browsers, you need to keep upgrading your
product, but I don't think that was what you meant by "maintain",
and obviously such additional development would come with a
corresponding income.

I think you meant "to support users and correct defects."  In a
rush to get to market, businesses sometimes skimp on quality, but
not everyone does this.  Those who do skimp suffer a substantial
maintenance cost to fix their software, and frankly, that is their
own fault.  I hope that open source is never used to justify lower
quality standards!  

I think you painted a very negative picture of the experience of
owning IP.  Certainly all the costs that you described do mount
up, however if your product is worth protecting then it's also
worth selling.  The ongoing licence fees quickly consume all that
debt.  :-)

A competitive market encourages you to sell regular upgrades.  Open
source does provide a multitude of new upgrades at "no development
cost," but for the product to remain cohesive the standard source
tree must still be maintained by it's owner, and this requires
people who commit ongoing time.  Time is money and the cost of
maintaining open source software cannot be offset against a guaranteed
income stream.  It's a hard decision for a business to swap that
generous, ongoing income stream for the unpaid privilege of
maintaining open source software.

Some products aren't worth protecting, perhaps because they have
too narrow a market.  In this case open source gives the customers
a degree of insurance on their investment in software, and it gives
the author a shot of fame.  Basically everybody wins.

I am amazed at the large volume of software which is open source,
however the businesses turning mega-profit do so on the back of
their IP.  I am sure Microsoft makes much more from Word than it
does from Internet Explorer.  The latter must surely be a loss
leader intended to maintain theirpresence in the internet industry.

Regards,

David
