Which reminds me, our team's job ad appeared in today's Australian.

The position may interest some readers of this list.  If not,
I apologise for the noise.  Being a public organisation, the
uni has a strict appointment procedure, so please contact
the person listed in the ad for more information - do not
e-mail me.

Cheers,
Glen

PS: Our team is not responsible for the rather low quality of
    English expression in the ad.  The ad we submitted got
    hacked about to meet space and financial requirements.
