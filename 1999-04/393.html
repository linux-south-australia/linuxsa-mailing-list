What version of windows are you running a, b, oem2 or c.?
If you are running a or b there is a ms service pack available that lists it
fixes problems with SAMBA UNIX  servers.
If this is not situation there are different fixes depending on wether you
are using DNS ,DHCP or lmhosts.

Subject:	Very slow login on a Win95 machine

Hi,

this problem is driving me nuts.

I have a site where one, and only one, Win95 machine is taking 10 minutes
to log onto the network.

The logon server is a Windows NT 3.51 system. All other Windows 95 and
Windows 98 servers log onto the network very quickly.  They all run logon
scripts with a bunch of dos commands in them.

On the machine that is taking 10 minutes to log in, I have taken a network
trace (actually, many) and I see the following:

Time(s)   Command or response
--------------------------
1.0       SMB Open File command (from client to server)
1.001     SMB Open File response (from server to client)
2.002     SMB Read File command (from client to server)

The whole trace is like this. The server responds to the clients request
with a mS or two, while the client takes a second of more to send its next
command.

I have checked the adapter (a PCMCIA Xircom PS2CE) in another machine, and
it works fine.

I have moved the machine to a different network point, and I have tried a
know working Xircom from another machine in the offending system. All to no
avail.

The system now has only one protocol in use: TCP/IP. Perviously, it had
TCP/IP and NetBEUI and IPX (with NetBIOS over IPX).

It has the feel of a timeout going on inside Win95, perhaps mediated by a
registry setting.

Has anyone seen this problem? Can anyone suggest the next step to resolve
it?

Regards
