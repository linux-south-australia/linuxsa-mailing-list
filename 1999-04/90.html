&gt; Microsoft Announces MS-Linux
&gt; 
&gt; The flexible "grassroots" operating system, now with the quality and
&gt; enterprise-level service and support customers expect from Microsoft
&gt; 
&gt; REDMOND, Wash., April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Microsoft Corp. today announced
&gt; the forthcoming release of MS-Linux(R), a new version of the well-known
&gt; Linux(R) operating system designed for the enterprise.
&gt; 
&gt; "Prior to the development of MS-Linux, enterprise customers wouldn't dream
&gt; of deploying mission-critical applications on an unsupported operating
&gt; system," said Jim Allchin, senior vice president of Microsoft's personal
&gt; and business systems group. "All that has now changed."
&gt; 
&gt; Maximum compatibility and performance
&gt; 
&gt; While other versions of Linux offer a variety of immature and largely
&gt; incompatible windowing environments, MS-Linux includes an implementation
&gt; of the familiar Microsoft(R) Windows(R) desktop, minimizing corporate
&gt; training costs and allowing the hundreds of millions of Windows users
&gt; worldwide to be productive right away.
&gt; 
&gt; MS-Linux provides a complete implementation of the Win32(R) API, enabling
&gt; many of the thousands of applications written for the Microsoft Windows
&gt; 95, Windows 98, Windows NT(R), and Windows 2000 operating systems to run
&gt; unchanged on MS-Linux. Microsoft will offer support for future releases of
&gt; the Microsoft Office suite of productivity applications and the BackOffice
&gt; family of server products running on MS-Linux. In addition, many existing
&gt; MS-DOS(R) and SCO Unix programs will run on MS-Linux without modification.
&gt; Benchmark tests performed by independent laboratories have shown that
&gt; MS-Linux is the world's fastest Windows file server.
&gt; 
&gt; A groundswell of support from industry
&gt; 
&gt; A number of leading development tool vendors will announce support for
&gt; MS-Linux, including Bristol Technology Inc., Compuware Corp., Cygnus
&gt; Solutions, Fujitsu Microelectronics Inc., Intel Corp., Metrowerks Inc.,
&gt; Rational Software Corp., Sybase Inc., and Tower Technology.
&gt; 
&gt; "The new Linux distribution from Microsoft gives the operating system the
&gt; credibility it needs to gain a foothold in organizations where it has
&gt; never gone before," said Jon Hall, Executive Director of Linux
&gt; International, a non-profit Linux advocacy organization. Microsoft will
&gt; become a corporate member of Linux International, and will make a
&gt; substantial donation of funds and equipment to the organization. "Linux
&gt; International looks forward to working with Microsoft for the benefit of
&gt; current and future Linux users," added Hall.
&gt; 
&gt; According to VA Research President and CEO Larry Augustin, "VA Research is
&gt; delighted that Microsoft is entering the fast-growing market for computers
&gt; powered by Linux." VA Research has announced plans to bundle MS-Linux and
&gt; selected Microsoft Office and BackOffice products with its powerful
&gt; server, workstation, and laptop computers. VA Research has also agreed to
&gt; make Microsoft its exclusive supplier of Linux-based operating systems
&gt; going forward. "Having the Office and BackOffice suites running on
&gt; computers from VA Research will give us a huge advantage in the
&gt; marketplace," said Augustin.
&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft has engaged well-known author and programmer Eric S. Raymond to
&gt; advise the company on certain intellectual property issues related to
&gt; Linux. Raymond's paper "The Cathedral of the Bizarre" was a key factor in
&gt; Microsoft's decision to develop a Linux product. "While Microsoft will not
&gt; immediately release the source code for its version of Linux, the company
&gt; has promised to do so eventually," said Raymond. "That's good enough for
&gt; me."
&gt; 
&gt; "The Linux community and Microsoft are a great fit," says Linus Torvalds,
&gt; creator of Linux. "After all, we both have the same goal, which is total
&gt; world domination."
&gt; 
&gt; Separately, Microsoft has announced the opening of a new recruiting center
&gt; in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. "Microsoft is always looking
&gt; for talented individuals to join our team," said Mike Murray, Microsoft's
&gt; vice president of human resources and administration. "We often recruit in
&gt; communities that are expected to have significant numbers of folks looking
&gt; for work in the near future."
&gt; 
&gt; Pricing and availability
&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft expects to release English and international versions of
&gt; MS-Linux Version 3.1 for Intel- and RISC-based computers on or before
&gt; April 1, 2000. Pricing has not been announced.
&gt; 
&gt; About Microsoft

&gt; software for personal computers. The company offers a wide range of
&gt; products and services, each designed with the mission of making it easier
