G'day,
 
&gt; Does anyone know where in Adelaide, if at all I can get a Linux stuffed
&gt; Penguin or any such merchandise?  I love that penguin.  I know it is a
&gt; highly technical question which may perplex even seasoned users of Linux.
&gt; It is however crucial to my personal development as a Linux user.

:-)   Agreed 100%  

My mother-in-law has been caught up in our Penguin-mania and has knit
several small penguins with hats and scarves of different colours.
She'd like $7 each to cover her time and materials. I wish I could
provide the pattern (so they'd be Open Source), but alas, she used a
book and the pattern is copyright.   

I've been meaning to do a web page about them for awhile now but needed
a nice picture of them.  Rod's doing a screen capture as I type, and
we'll be bringing a few of them to the next Linuxsa meeting.

Currently there's 8 of them, and I have to admit they have taken on
their own life... I made a cute box for them for display and they've
been guarding a couple chocolate Easter eggs.  I must say, even though
I'm a chocolate addict, I'm very reluctant to take the eggs away from
them.  They are extremely good Easter egg guards.  !!   :-)

Cheers,
Gaelyne
