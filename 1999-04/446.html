OK, an update to this...

I thought I my problem was the fact that I didn't have rarp compiled into
my kernel. I recompiled, making sure that I had the rarp module, and then I
realised that I already had the rarp module. (When I typed `rarp -av` it
said 'not supported by kernel' with both the original kernel and my new
one.) I realised that the rarp module wasn't being loaded, so I manually
set the rarp entry with tha `rarp -s` command and behold, it worked. The
rarp module loaded and the sun 3/60 booted, found it's IP via bootpd and
tftpd'ed it's kernel across the network.

Question. How can I get the rarp requests to load the module? Without the
module loaded, inetd doesn't even bother starting bootpd. It only works
when the rarp command prods kerneld to load the module. I'd prefer not to
kludge a solutions by getting a script calling insmod or some other hack,
I'd just like it to work properly.

I could always compile the code into a kernel, but that's the last resort!

(A solution I've thought of that I don't like, is to call insmod from
inetd, but I don't even know if inetd will call anything, cause it's not
supported by the kernel. Catch 22!)

Suggestions?

&gt;Yeah, I used to have one. Or it might have been a sun 3/50, I really
&gt;don't remember any more.
&gt;But it worked fine, and I sold it to Nick and set up his linux machine
&gt;to handle it.
&gt;When I get home I'll dig out the stuff I used.
&gt;There's a package on the web to do it, but it's extremely outdated now,
&gt;and I don't really reccommend using most of it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Has anyone got it working?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I can see the rarp requests from the sun, but my bootps server (running
&gt;&gt; through inet) isn't responding. Probably buggered a config somewhere.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Cheers
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Alex!
