<H1>Setting up Intranet</H1>

Hello,

I'm helping with setting up my schools (Glenunga International High
School) Internet / Intranet network.
The current network is 10baseT Fast Ethernet with lots of hubs.
We recently acquired a large sum of money to upgrade to optic fiber
network, 100baseT, switches and 2 network ports in every classroom.
We have around 200 computer and over 1000 users. (We are a public school

:)
With a little persuasion I have managed to get the Network Admin to
agree to set up a Linux server (He has no previous experience with UNIX
or Linux, the main reason was because it was free :).
Getting Linux into our school would be a big step because it will
(hopefully) become the local "hub" for all the surrounding schools in
the area. :)

There are 2 things I would like help on

1. We have 3 servers,
    A Novell server - This runs all the admin stuff like DHCP, and user
logins
            This is all set up and running perfectly, users are assigned

a certain IP address, so no matter where a person is on the network he
always has the same IP address.

    A Novell file server - This has all the files on it ;)

    A Linux firewall / web server - This is the gate to the Internet and

holds the entire Intranet and all external services. This is connected
to a router - dual idsn lines.
        Because of the dual idsn line being quite small for 200
computers, which are constantly using the Internet, I need an efficient
way to balance the load over them.
            The internal web based e-mail, people should be able to
check their e-mail from outside the network but no "sign up" for an
account from outside. (We are doing this because the current stats show
over 60% of our traffic is to Hotmail! That’s around $500 a month!)
            Local DNS server, I would like to set up virtual internal
demains, which when a person request internal.technology it send them to

the correct place on the internal network. The Intranet is also on
shared as a network drive called Intranet.
            The proxy server, squid proxy with 8 gig scsi cache, set to
block all sites on a list.
            The web server, Apache, virtual domains, 9 in all. 8 with
the format internal.curriculum_area, only accessible from internally, 1
accessible from outside. Some areas not available to certain IP groups
(users)
            No other Internet services should be able to be accessed.

This is the server we are currently setting up, I have be using Linux as

home for about 2 years but i little knowledge of setting up a server to
do most of the things above under Linux. I would like to know where i
can get information on all of the above, with name of appropriate
software and web addresses would be nice. Has anyone set-up a similar
design? If so could you fore see any major problems / areas of
difficulty? We are a school so can't pay you anything and would love it
if one of you expericened Linux users could some in and help up set it
up.

2. I'm setting up a web based e-mail system for the people on our
internal network. The web base part of it works. What I want to do is
because of our large amount of e-mails leaving the network I would like
them to all be put on a queue so that they can all be sent when amount
of data passing through the line reaches below a certain point. The
sender and the place it is getting sent to should determine weather the
e-mail is put on this queue or sent right away. Of course if the e-mail
is to one of the people on the internal network it should be "move" into

the correct mailbox. If an admin sends a piece of mail is should be sent

right away. There will be about 700 users.

Thanks for any help in advance.

Tim
