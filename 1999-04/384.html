IDE drives suck rhinoceros' through drinking straws.  

The problem is that they don't use DMA to access memory buffers, to the
poor CPU has to copy every block of data out of a buffer on your IDE
controller (which is essentially the bit bolted underneath the disk)
into RAM.  As a result, the CPU has to stop whatever it's doing every
time the IDE controller hits it with an interrupt, with the ultimate
result of slowing down your entire machine whenever one pesky user
decides to get all disk-intensive on you.  The problem is even worse
when you have more than one IDE drive on the same bus, because IDE drives
have a nasty habit of hogging the bus until they're finished with each
transaction, which makes it kinda difficult to have multiple transactions
outstanding or talk to more than one drive at a time.

EIDE drives with DMA suck slightly less, but they still suck.  They use
DMA but are still plagued with half-hearted design compromises.  Also,
not everyone has them -- It's probably fair to say that despite the
existance of EIDE's DMA functionality, the vast majority of PC users
are stuck with non-DMA IDE crud.

The bottom line is that you *can* get underflows if you're trying to
talk to a SCSI CD-burner and an IDE disk at the same time.  You can also
get similar effects if you have a CD-burner and an IDE disk on the same
controller and wish to use them both at the same time.
