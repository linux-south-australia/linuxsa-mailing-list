Could somebody then tell me how DHCP or BOOTP can work if the mac address of
a NIC can change. The IP address is bound to the TCP/IP stack of the
computer, not the MAC address, this is used at the Data Link Layer (on the
NIC itself). DHCP and BOOTP require that the MAC address be sent to them via
a broadcast packet, which returns a packet via to the broadcasting MAC
address for configuring the TCP/IP stack. Woe behold a network admin that
has a person who decides, "Hmm let's change the MAC address on this card"
and they use the MAC address of another machine currently existing on this
network, where does the DHCP/BOOTP response go to ? Does it configure both
machines to the same address, name, etc ??

This makes no sense. The MAC is supposedly unique across the planet, exactly
for this purpose. Image two machines on the internet with the same MAC
address. Note that packets travelling across a network are based on the MAC
address. Remember an IP address identifies a machine not a NIC, to prove
this 127.0.0.1 is loopback, there is no physical NIC, the data link layer
reads the MAC address from the packet, this is unwrapped for the ip address
and then this is unwrapped for the protocol port that the packet is bound
for. The IP address is convenient for us to read, ie 32 bit, the mac address
is significantly bigger (can remember exactly, I think it's 48 bits).

I have never heard of an application talking directly to the network using
the MAC address, come-on even IP (generally considered the lowest layer you
can program on) uses IP addresses (hmmm, hence the name I suppose). The only
thing that I know of that uses MAC addresses is DHCP and BOOTP.

&gt;&gt; If it is based on MAC address then it might be useful.  Unfortunately
&gt;&gt; MAC addresses can be
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a Changed on some chipsets
&gt;&gt; I beleive the LANCE chipset can change it's MAC address.
&gt;
&gt;All chipsets can change their MAC address, although some
&gt;will only let you do so during an initialisation sequence.
&gt;
&gt;It has to be this way -- it is desirable for some applications
&gt;for the MAC address to belong to the machine and interface,
&gt;not the NIC.  An example is redundant chipsets.  Another
&gt;example is DECnet hosts, where changing the MAC address
&gt;changes the DECnet address (and DECnet addresses should
&gt;be static).
&gt;
&gt;These are unusual applications, but no chipset designer
&gt;is going to forego a part of a market, as it is impossible
&gt;to predict how important that market component might become
&gt;during the chipset's lifetime.
&gt;
&gt;A good example if the handling of an obscure ethernet
&gt;feature called multicast.  The DEC Tulip chipset
&gt;handles this well, the LANCE chipset middlingly,
&gt;and the earlier Intel chipsets poorly.  So what
&gt;chipset will you find in the multimedia-oriented
&gt;computers?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; b Not assigned from the appropriate authority.
&gt;&gt; Cheap network cards do-not alway map to a
&gt;&gt; vendor who has paid?? for their identifiers.
&gt;
&gt;Unlikely.  Most manufacturers of cheap cards purchase
&gt;the ID ROMs from a third party.  The first three octets
&gt;of the MAC address may belong to that third party.
&gt;So cheap cards often look as if they pinched address
&gt;space from, say, Intel.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; So it would be interesting to see what it turns out to be.
&gt;
&gt;Given that it is a virus, there is every chance that the
&gt;MAC address is that of the sender, not of the originator of
&gt;the document.
