&gt; G'Day list,
&gt; 
&gt; Just trying to come to grips with Linux after I finally managed to
&gt; break out of the M$ mind trance .... unfortunately all my command line
&gt; skills disappeared about the same time as CPM ....
&gt; 
&gt; I now have Linux up and running, after it was pointed out to me that X
&gt; wont run on AGP cards yet, so I now have a bog standard PCI in. (Dont
&gt; throw rocks at me just yet, this window thing is going to take time to
&gt; get out of my system :-)
Heyas, umm, where was it pointed out to you that X doesnt support AGP?
Because, you might want to point out to them that they don't know what
they're talking about.
This system is running a Rage 3d pro2 AGP card, my system at home runs a
i740 AGP card, and I've seen Milleniums, Riva's, Tridents, all in AGP
form, running X fine!
There's absolutely no reason why it shouldnt be able to work.

&gt; 
&gt; Question is, how to I stop the "virtual" scrolling bit. I want to be
&gt; able to see all the info on one physical screen but also at high
&gt; resolution (using RedHat 5.2).
look at /etc/XF86Config. `man XF86Config` will explain the format and
options, but basically find the right set of server options for your
server (probably accel or svga), which should something look like this:
Section "Screen"
    Driver      "accel"
    Device      "Mach64 GD (Rage Pro)"
    Monitor     "Samsung SyncMaster 17GLi"
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       32
        Modes       "1024x768"
        ViewPort    0 0
        Virtual     1024 768
    EndSubsection
{etc}

The Virtual line is the size of your virtual desktop - set it to the
same size as your resolution you run at, and voila! no more scrolling
around. You might have several modes listed - eg "640x480" "800x600"
"1024x768", if so you can change res in X by pressing ctrl-alt-+ (on
keypad) and ctrl-alt--.
