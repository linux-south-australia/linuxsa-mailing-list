<H1>Melissa ID creator?</H1>

We've seen a bit of hysteria about the Melissa word macro virus lately,
but here's an article I've seen which talks about using another 'hidden
feature' in Word, the global identifier, which is based on your ethernet
MAC address. (Supposedly completely unique.)
Unless the author of the original document spoofed his identifier, the
FBI would be able to find the given netcard that was in the PC at the
time the document was first saved.
(I'd be interested to know the web site that it WAS originally posted
on, and how these people found the website, given the millions of them
around. That might be more interesting than the story of just extracting
the ID number)

------------------------
Serial numbers may not be so good for your privacy, but they come pretty
damn useful when tracking down virus authors. Using Microsoft's highly
contentious Global Unique Identifier, two bug hunters have unmasked the
web
site where -- they claim -- the Melissa email virus originated. 

  Bug hunter Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, has passed
this
information onto the FBI. He says the virus bears the hallmarks of a
virus
unleashed on an unsuspecting planet two years ago. 

  Let's hope he's right. The FBI will be trampling all over this unnamed
web site with a less than fine tooth comb. The Melissa author could
always
have framed the web site. 

  We wonder how Microsoft will deal with this unexpected plug for serial
numbers. 

  Smith and fellow virus chaser, Swedish PhD student Fredrik Bjorck,
used the
electronic fingerprint contained in the the Melissa-infected Word Macro.
This fingerprint is identical to documents posted on the "guilty" web
site. ®
