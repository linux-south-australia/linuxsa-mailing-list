Along a similar thread..

I've been using StarOffice on and off for a while, and there's something
that -annoys- me greatly, that I'd loooove to know how to fix..

Fonts.  When the font gets big, it gets chunky.  This happens in all apps,
of course, like Netscape, text editors, etc etc etc.  I believe it's to do
with Antialiasing of Fonts, which is in the X server's department.  I also
believe that until XFree86 v3.somethingbig.0 is released, server font
antialiasing won't be supported natively, so you have to recompile the
server, patched with code written by ? != XFree86.

Can someone please either confirm or destroy the above theory?  And, if
anyone's managed to get a 127-point courier font to look acceptable under
XFree86, tell us how you did it!!

Cheers all..

&gt; &gt; I need a FREE Linux program which will talk to Microsoft Office
&gt; 97 and 95
&gt; &gt; (specifically Word and Excel). I would also like it to use some sort of
&gt; &gt; GUI, WYSIWYG interface and not come up with annoying
&gt; registration screens,
&gt; &gt; or die after X days.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Preferable I'd prefer on a CD ROM, rather than ftp because I'm not
&gt; &gt; actually connected to the Net.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone know of anything?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Your choices are:
&gt;
&gt;  1. WordPerfect 8
&gt;       WP only.
&gt;       Limited version for free personal use.
&gt;       Stable.
&gt;       Full version comes on a CD, for money.
&gt;       Yet to repsond with site licensing info (amazing, you get
&gt;        to use it for 45(?) days for free, then you e-mail them
&gt;        saying `I want to pay' and they haven't decided how much).
&gt;
&gt;  2. StarOffice
&gt;       WP, SS, slides
&gt;       Full version for free personal use.
&gt;       Stability and resource issues, possibly related more to the
&gt;        Wind/U portkit than StarOffice itself.
&gt;       Site license for US$1000, unlimited seats, eternal.
&gt;
&gt;  3. Applix
&gt;       WP, SS, slide, e-mail
&gt;       Pay money, lots of.  Site license by seat, with LM, by version.
&gt;       Stable.
&gt;
&gt; Their ability to import Word documents varies.  This is Microsoft's
&gt; fault: there is no docuementation for most versions, and the doco
&gt; for 97 versions is wrong.
&gt;
&gt; There are also viewer programs, of varying quality.  A GNU project
&gt; for filters wioth MS products has finally kicked off.  Give it
&gt; a year or two.
&gt;
&gt; If you are willing to do without total WYSIWYG, then LaTeX and
&gt; Xemacs/AuCTeX is your friend.  And seriously, TeX is a godsend
&gt; for any document bigger than a chapter.  Can produce PDF output.
&gt;
&gt; The missing product is, of course, FrameMaker.  Does anyone know
&gt; what Adobe are doing about Linux ports?
&gt;
&gt; If you are writing *for* MS users, then you could use HTML.
&gt;
&gt; I write most of my doco in HTML nowdays, and the result is
&gt; both impressive and sets a good example for MS users (they
&gt; want to know what program I use).
