I don't know about your first problem, but the second one sounds
suspiciously like X is no longer SUID root. I'm not sure where the suid
root is supposed to be though, but maybe someone else will.
I don't see how this could really have occured though. But it's just a
thought that X DOES need to be suid root to access the video card
directly, and so if a user can't run it, it looks like it doesnt have
it's root priveleges.

&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt;     Couple of problems, unrelated on two different machines.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem 1.
&gt; 
&gt;     Machine running Redhat 5.2, has been running perfectly
&gt; no problems. Just upgraded video card to a Diamond Viper550
&gt; AGP card. Was running XFree86 3.1 or whatever was default
&gt; with the APC disk, and this didn't like the new Video card
&gt; so I downloaded  the latest X 3.3 and it now runs fine, no
&gt; problems. Now here is the strange bit, the Printer, an HP
&gt; DeskJet 670C, was running fine, but now it will only print
&gt; Postscript. It will NOT print standard output or a text
&gt; file. Went to the printer tool in X, printed PS, ascii to
&gt; the port, ie dev/lpt0, this worked fine. Tried to print
&gt; ascii test page and the error light on the printer started
&gt; flashing and no output. Cannot pipe cat text to lp, ie.
&gt;         cat .bashrc | lpr -lp
&gt; weird. Can print PS through Ghostview. I just don't
&gt; understand how this can happen when I have not changed
&gt; anything remotely to do with the printer. The same symptoms
&gt; occur if I am running X or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Problem 2.
&gt; 
&gt;     Machine is completely isolated from machine 1. Machine 2
&gt; is an Intel Celeron 333, 128Mb RAM, Diamond Viper 330 AGP
&gt; Video card. Installed a virgin copy of Redhat 5.2 from the
&gt; APC disk. Machine appeared to set up fine, appeared to be
&gt; working fine. X runs perfectly under root. Strange
&gt; occurrence number 2 - created 1 user in the normal fashion,
&gt; gave him a passwd etc. Logged in as that user, no problems.
&gt; That user CANNOT run X. runs startx command and gets the
&gt; initial grey screen with a cursor, and then it appears to
&gt; hang. Fire off a trusty Ctrl-Alt-F1 and get the following
&gt; message :
&gt; 
&gt; The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports :
&gt; &gt; Error    bad length in Geometry
&gt; &gt;            Output File "var/temp/Server-0.xkm" removed
&gt; Errors from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server
&gt; Couldn't load XKB keymap, falling back to pre-XKB keymap
&gt; xinit : unexpected error 2
&gt; 
&gt; Waiting for X server to shutdown
&gt; 
&gt; O.K. now I expect the last 2 lines were me when I Ctrl-C to
&gt; kill the process. But how can it work fine for root but not
&gt; a user in this case. The setup was a virgin install onto a
&gt; virgin hard disk and was done in exactly the same way as I
&gt; setup other machines that have no problems. I am a bit out
&gt; of my depth here so basically help guys.
&gt; 
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew
