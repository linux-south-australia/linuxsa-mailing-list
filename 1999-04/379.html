The CPU being cold can only be a good thing.

You probably don't remember, but when you set up your kernel before
compiling, you probably set "CPU halt during idle" under the APM options.
This means that when linux isn't doing anything, it basically turns the CPU
off. That would be the only explanation as to why its running so cold.
You'll find that if you start doing some CPU intensive stuff, your CPU will
heat up.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have just set up an AMD K6-2/400, and the board is jumpered for 400MHz,
&gt; and the BIOS claims it is 400MHz as well.
&gt;
&gt; I touched the great big ball-bearing fan/heat-sink unit that I added, and,
&gt; to my surprise, it was cold. You could almost chill a beer on it.
&gt;
&gt; The CPU core voltage is 2.2 V, but, even so, I would have expected the HS
&gt; to heat up. It concerns me.
&gt;
&gt; It has been running for about 6 hours continuously without any problems
&gt; now, and is currently compiling a 2.2.x kernel. It claims 799 bogo-MIPS.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else had any experience with such a beast. Do they really run
cool?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
