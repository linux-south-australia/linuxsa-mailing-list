&gt; Looking at the scoring technique that they use, they are looking at 
&gt; 'shrink-wrapped' products, penalising heavily if the end user has to source
&gt; product enhancements from external or non-shipped sources..

Personally I have little time for anybody who refuses to even slightly
hold their own hand, never the less the vast majority of computer users
seem to be in this category.  Consequently the availability of "everything"
in shrink-wrapped form is a fair and valid method of comparing different
operating systems.  Obviously Windows scores a perfect 10 for availability
of everything, and indeed most of that everything is shrink-wrapped; sadly
Unix in scores quite poorly for availability, shrink-wrapped or otherwise,
and if you make shrink-wrap be a required condition then Unix scores even
worse.  Linux is a subset of Unix and can necessarily score no better than
the generic "unix".  So Linux is at best a poor scorer, and more likely
not even that good.

As Matthew says, in an enterprise targetted environment, where perhaps
the IT department might be willing to do their own system integration,
shrink-wrap might be less important.  My own experience with large
business (our public record shows this includes AWA, Boeing, Cable &
Wireless Optus, Intel, Hewlett Packard, Honda and many others) suggests
that shrink-wrap is just as important for them as it is for home and
small business users.  Large IT departments expect to be able to insert
a half-dozen CDs in rapid succession to build a machine containing the
standard operating environment, which will almost certainly include
operating system, email, word processor, spreadsheet, terminal emulator
and web browser.  I think I'm safe in assuming that we all, here, will
be nodding our head in agreement that this is easy under Windows (you
don't have to like Windows, but it's hard to deny that these are easy
applications to source and install.)  The industry has become so damned
Windows-centric that it no longer is easy to find the complete solution
for Unix.

Software producers are building Windows code with lemming-like eagerness,
and having addressed 80 - 90% of the market seem willing to ignore the
remainder.  This, I submit, is the true danger of the Windows monopoly.

If I can head off the cries of dismay: Obviously Unix has a good range
of solutions, maybe almost as many as Windows, and so an enterprise which
is willing to invest some time up front will no-doubt get a sterling
solution.  That solution won't include Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel,
which will be a barrier in electronic dissemination of documents with
almost everybody else.  It's sad that import filters do an imperfect job.

Sorry; I'm starting to preach.

Regards,

David
