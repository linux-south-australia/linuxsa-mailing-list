Hi Guys,
    Couple of problems, unrelated on two different machines.

Problem 1.

    Machine running Redhat 5.2, has been running perfectly
no problems. Just upgraded video card to a Diamond Viper550
AGP card. Was running XFree86 3.1 or whatever was default
with the APC disk, and this didn't like the new Video card
so I downloaded  the latest X 3.3 and it now runs fine, no
problems. Now here is the strange bit, the Printer, an HP
DeskJet 670C, was running fine, but now it will only print
Postscript. It will NOT print standard output or a text
file. Went to the printer tool in X, printed PS, ascii to
the port, ie dev/lpt0, this worked fine. Tried to print
ascii test page and the error light on the printer started
flashing and no output. Cannot pipe cat text to lp, ie.
        cat .bashrc | lpr -lp
weird. Can print PS through Ghostview. I just don't
understand how this can happen when I have not changed
anything remotely to do with the printer. The same symptoms
occur if I am running X or not.


Problem 2.

    Machine is completely isolated from machine 1. Machine 2
is an Intel Celeron 333, 128Mb RAM, Diamond Viper 330 AGP
Video card. Installed a virgin copy of Redhat 5.2 from the
APC disk. Machine appeared to set up fine, appeared to be
working fine. X runs perfectly under root. Strange
occurrence number 2 - created 1 user in the normal fashion,
gave him a passwd etc. Logged in as that user, no problems.
That user CANNOT run X. runs startx command and gets the
initial grey screen with a cursor, and then it appears to
hang. Fire off a trusty Ctrl-Alt-F1 and get the following
message :

The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports :
&gt; Error    bad length in Geometry
&gt;            Output File "var/temp/Server-0.xkm" removed
Errors from xkbcomp are not fatal to the X server
Couldn't load XKB keymap, falling back to pre-XKB keymap
xinit : unexpected error 2

Waiting for X server to shutdown

O.K. now I expect the last 2 lines were me when I Ctrl-C to
kill the process. But how can it work fine for root but not
a user in this case. The setup was a virgin install onto a
virgin hard disk and was done in exactly the same way as I
setup other machines that have no problems. I am a bit out
of my depth here so basically help guys.

    Cheers!
        Andrew
