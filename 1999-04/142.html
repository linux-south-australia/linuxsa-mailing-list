I recieved this, if anyone is interested then feel free to go.

I am not sure how programmable the programmable is, but if we can
control it simply then we could all have 'smart' houses with large
amounts of uptime :)

Regards,

Matt

&gt; 
&gt; The April SAMG meeting will be held tomorrow night Friday 9/4/99. If you
&gt; think any LinuxSA members may be interested you may wish to advise them.
&gt; The meeting will be held at 8pm, Burnside Community Centre, Corner Greenhill
&gt; an Portrush Roads. A description of the meeting is below.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The Clipsal C-Bus Automation system.
&gt; TIME: 8:00 p.m.
&gt; DATE: Friday April 9, 1999
&gt; PLACE: Burnside Council Community Centre cnr of Portrush and Greenhill
&gt; Roads, Burnside
&gt; SUBJECT: Clipsal C-Bus Automation system.
&gt; PRESENTER: Mr. Barry Walker
&gt; 
&gt; The April meeting will be on the Clipsal C-Bus Automation System. Please
&gt; note the change of venue, now at the Burnside Council Community Centre,
&gt; corner of Portrush and Greenhill Roads Burnside.
&gt; The C-Bus system is a fully programmable control system designed primarily
&gt; to optimise lighting arrangements to save electricity cost. It also provides
&gt; more flexible and efficient lighting operations compared to conventional
&gt; lighting systems in multistorey buildings, offices and hotels. It also has
&gt; application in the home, our talk last year on Mawson Lakes demonstrated the
&gt; level of automation that may become standard in the near future.
&gt; The system is reliable and less expensive than comparable energy management
&gt; systems and will radically simplify electrical installation practices.
&gt; Microprocessors are built into push button light switches which send
&gt; commands to the distributed load controllers to use only the lights that are
&gt; needed. In its basic mode, C-Bus provides clever switching flexibility
&gt; compared to a conventional switch installation. When linked to a personal
&gt; computer, C-Bus can monitor all lighting arrangements within a multistorey
&gt; building and stop wasteful use of electricity. If utilised with particular
&gt; C-Bus products, lighting arrangements can be adjusted to the degree of
&gt; natural light. Alternatively, lights can be programmed to function only when
&gt; a person is in a room to a far more sophisticated level than with
&gt; conventional people sensors. Once installed, C-Bus offers enormous potential
&gt; and possibilities in the future to link in security, climate control, fire
&gt; alarms and irrigation control arrangements.
&gt; This should be a fascinating presentation on a locally developed technology.
