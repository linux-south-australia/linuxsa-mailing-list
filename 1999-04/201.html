&gt; &gt; Looks like people are starting to play hard ball politics with linux
&gt; &gt; now.  This
&gt; &gt; is not the first article, nor will it be the last, to start the campaign
&gt; &gt; against
&gt; &gt; linux.

Hmmmm? Campaigns against Linux, Aliens at Roswell.  I thought the article was
quite good.  It merely said that Linux isn't a good choice for an Enterprise
level OS at the moment.  The technical limitations on file-size etc... on Linux
are quite valid problems for people deploying an OS, in the Enterprise at least.

It's hardly your usual Linux vs NT analysis... in fact NT is only slightly
better than Linux as far as DH Brown is concerned.  [All other Unix varieties
come out on top].  Of course they should make the full report freely available
=).

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; &gt; And it is this fact which makes the 'White Paper' you have all been
&gt; &gt; notified
&gt; &gt; about quite useless when applied in our usage context.

That's true.  It's quite a specific set of problems it points out.  The paper is
meant to be an Overall Rating of Enterprise Server OS's after all.

&gt; &gt; Phew... so read the article, yes, but take heed of just what makes US
&gt; &gt; decide what
&gt; &gt; is good and what is poor.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So when  Alan Farrely gives his point of view, it is based on HIS
&gt; &gt; perceptions of
&gt; &gt; what makes a quality product based on the dimensions I have mentioned
&gt; &gt; above.

It's not Alan Farrely at all.  DH Brown is an IT Research and Information
company in the US that advises a lot of Fortune 500 type companies on IT
strategy.

&gt; &gt; That is why we are making good progress, the linux community is
&gt; &gt; strengthening the
&gt; &gt; dimensions above so that it is attracting new users who may have decided
&gt; &gt; previous, consciously or unconsciously, to reject the product because of
&gt; &gt; one or
&gt; &gt; more of failings applied to the dimensions above.

I found the article interesting becuase it pointed out something that we all
really know but try to ignore:  NT isn't a real threat to Linux, other Unix
varieties are.

&gt; &gt; Hope this is not too inappropriate for this mailing list.

Probably no worse than my original post =)

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Kind Regards
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve
