Intellectual Property is an asset ...

.. if you are living in the 1890's

Hypothesis:
- That Intellectual Property in the context of software, should be regarded
as a liability rather than an asset.

Huh ?

Sure, software does not wear out, or break all the time. However, if the
software is not _maintained_ by ever increasing amounts of programming work
being poured into it, then it becomes obsolete and hence worthless.

If you claim to hold the IP rights to a peice of software, and account for
this IP as an asset, then what are you going to do with the software ?  You
could try putting the source code into a bank vault for long term safe
storage ... dont touch a line of it, and see how much your 'asset' has grown
in value over the next 10 years.

If you want to simply maintain the book value of the IP asset, then how much
maintenance work has to be put into simply keeping the software up to date
with the latest 'technologies'. How many companies who put the IP asset down
in their balance sheets realistically account for the provision of a
maintenance liability, just to keep the IP asset 'current'.

Dont also forget to account for the provision for spening money 'defending'
your IP. How much additional money needs to be 'invested' paying lawyers to
draft complex patent applications. Dont forget that your patent licences
have to be renewed on a regular basis.

Also, these additional costs that you are wearing on behalf of your IP have
to come out of some bank account. Dont forget to add to the liability ledger
a provision for the cost of financing all of these expenses. If you borrow
money, there are interest charges to be accounted for. If you take on a VC
to partner, and use their seed money to pay for these things, then there is
a percentage of your gross takings that are no longer yours. - All in the
name of your IP Asset.

As the rate of change in the industry increases, then there is a
cooresponding increase in the maintenance cost of the IP. There has to come
a point where the real value of a peice of IP dips into the red.

At which point, it makes sense to discount the book value of the IP down to
a sensible amount, that more represents the sum of the value of your
companies staff & their ideas, and open the source code to your product.
That way, your 'product' can continue to have a positive book value that
represents goodwill and knowledge, and the maintenance burden of keeping the
product in sync with every crazy new idea and industry direction is lifted
from you.

If you follow this route, you end up with a product that is self-maintaining
at very low cost, and you get a very low-cost PR machine plugging your
solution behind every closed door. Your sales prospects are improved because
your customers face a reduced risk - if you go out of business, at least the
products will live on and be maintained. This reduces your cost to make each
sale.

Everything on balance, I would hypothesize that by running your commercial
project as open sourced, you are significantly reducing your costs without
compromising your income stream. That makes good business sense to me.

Discuss .....


------------------------------------------------------------------


If Venture Capital experts cannot see the good business sense in this, then
as far as I am concerned, that is their loss. 

I find it suspicious that some of the companies backing some VC schemes in
Adelaide are the same people who have a very big agenda in seeing the
continuation of their own IP monopoly, and would delight at the destruction
of the OpenSource movement.

In a way, I reckon that the whole concept of the 'Incredibly valuable IP
asset' is a huge scam. It is a notion put about by lawyers and their kin
simply to make up new ways of convincing people that their services are
needed.

At the end of the day, your IP asset, or any other asset, is only worth what
someone is really willing to pay for it. In this industry, there is only
really one big purchaser in the market, and they seem to have an odd track
record of picking up 'Incredibly valuable IP assets' for next to nothing.
.....  

.... dont believe half of what they tell you.
