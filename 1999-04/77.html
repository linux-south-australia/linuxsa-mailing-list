Hi,

I downloaded the socks5 source code from www.socks.nec.com and tried
compiling it. the configure part worked great, but when i did the make, it
got upto the clients/telnet/libtelnet directory, then spat the dummy. It
said:

telnet.o: In function 'setupterm':
telnet.o(.text+0xd39): undefined reference to 'tgetent'

I went back and looked at the output from the configure stage. When it
checked for tgetent, it said no. I would have thought that it would work
around it, since it continued searching for all the other parts and so on. I
did a locate tgetent and it wasn't found, so I did a query (using -qipl) of
all the RedHat 5.2 rpms, and that didn't have a file called tgetent either.

The output above was copied from when i tried to make the v1.0r8 source, and
I tried the v1.0r9 source, but that had the same error (to do with tgetent)

Does someone know what I need to do, to make this work? I tried getting the
socks5-server rpm from contrib.redhat.com, but it didn't seem to work using
the script in /etc/rc.d/init.d and when I tried a socks5 -b 1080 it seg
faulted and dumped the core :(

thanks,
Andy
