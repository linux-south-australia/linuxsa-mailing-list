I think you will find that any sort of software licensing
software is very high on the typical system adminsitrator's
hate list.

These systems usually at least double the amount of
effort required in installing and maintaining a
particular package.

In the example given, corporate firewalls suddenly
become a lot more difficult to maintain.  Time-
charged links will open in the evening for no good
reason (as the bill client send data to the bill
server).

All of the software licensing programs I have used
have needed to be overly machine-aware to prevent
fraud.  This makes them very fragile to unusual
or changing hardware environments.  One popular
license server stops if: you move the /etc partition
off the install disk, you restore any system files,
you change the ethernet card, you change the IP
address, you upgrade the kernel.  Arrrgh.

One of the reasons unlicenced software is popular
is that these issues leading to increased system
administration difficulty don't exist.

When we are trying to make Linux easier to use, why
unecessarily introduce these problems.  Adding
fragility just to gain information on market
penetration is exactly the sort of technical v.
marketing question on which Linux has traditionally
chosen "technical" and another OS manufacturer
has traditionally chosen "marketing".

Cheers,
Glen

  one could write a simulation program to see
  how these models would compete against each other,
  and to what extent they achieve objectives of
  efficiency, productivity, just reward, and so on. 

In a past life I worked in the econometrics area of
the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  Attractive
as your idea is -- it would kill a lot of tiresome
threads -- it isn't possible.

Models have to attach `weights' to represent demand
and supply forces for the differing attributes of
the differing licenses.

These weights are usually established through careful
analysis of consumer and supplier behavior.  But the
user awareness of the differing licenses so low that
merely asking the questions will distort the answers,
as the questioner will have to educate the respondent,
thus distorting the answer.

This problem is usually avoided by using market price
information to establish the weights -- unfortunately
this isn't really possible with an unpriced product.
You can ask what people *would* pay, but my gut feel
is that the variability of the answers would make it
impossible to prove hypotheses about the fine distinctions
between the license types.
