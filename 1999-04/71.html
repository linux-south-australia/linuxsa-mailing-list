Alan!

&gt;We need less theory and meditation (especially from rms),
&gt;and more facts on the ground.

All right. Take Lynx Internet (my company). We use free[dom] software
almost exclusively. It also happens to have cost us nothing to acquire and
use. Some of my clients have free[dom] software on their server machines
that connect to my network. It's Linux. They pay me to take the free[dom]
OS and install AND MODIFY IT on their server, maintain their network and
give them Internet access. It's an integral part of the business plan and
the freedom the software gives me is usually the reason I get the business
(plus it doesn't cost). I can make it affordable. I'm charging them for
support. I also maintain the free[dom] model by making my alteration
accessible to others. It might not be wonderful new hack of source code, it
could just be imparting what I've learned in setting up an ISP with only
free software, to others.

People write free software because it's a freedom. The fact that they don't
get paid for it is not the point and irrelevant.

&gt;When we see large numbers of companies hiring people to
&gt;write free software, then we will know that the theory is correct.

You missed the point completely. You are talking about people being paid to
write free software. _we-are-not-talking-about-money_. RMS advocates that
free software is good. I agree with him. You can't charge him with not
being useful if you understand that his viewpoint is based on freedom, not
lack-of-cost. It's the freedom he advocates that puts bread on my table.

Many people make money from free software by selling it or supporting it.
Some people make money out of writing it. (Linus does) The fundamental
difference with free[dom] software is that the mere nature of the
development of it is making it more and more attractive as a stable
product. In fact it is often a superior product (NT v Linux). You must try
to get out of the mind set that if you don't get paid it won't happen. This
is wrong. It's happening as we speak. I make lots of money out of free
software and people keep on writing it. As long as you are waiting for
companies to hire people to write free software you are missing the point.

I would love to talk about this some more over a pizza at the next meeting!

Cheers

Alex!
