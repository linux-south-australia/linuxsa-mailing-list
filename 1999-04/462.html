The Great Samba Tshirt and Book Offer ...

Please forward this message to anyone you think may be interested.

My apologies if you receive multiple copies of this email.

The following items are available for sale to people in Australia:

1. Samba T-shirts

   Australian made and printed in Australia. They have the Samba logon
   on the front and the words "opening windows to a wider world" on the
   back along with the web-site location.

   See www.samba.org and follow the tshirt link for more details.

   Sizes: Medium, Large, Extra Large, XXL
   Price: AUD $20.00 plus AUD $2.95 postage within OZ (if applicable)

   Sizes: XXXL and XXXXL
   Price: AUD $22.00 plus AUD $2.95 postage within OZ (if applicable)

2. SAMS Teach Yourself Samba in 24 Hours by Gerry Carter with
   Richard Sharpe

   This 470+ page book covers Samba up to 2.0.3 and leads you through
   a range of subjects including obtaining Samba, installing it, and
   using it.  See further below for the chapter outline.

   Price: AUD $39.95 plus AUD $4.95 postage within OZ (if applicable)

3. Both the Tshirt and the book

   Price: AUD $57.00 plus AUD $4.95 postage within OZ (if applicable)
   (You save in postage, if applicable, and you get a discount.)

WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THESE ITEMS FROM ME?

Both the Samba Tshirt and the book are available from the US. You can
purchase the Tshirts from a Samba team member in the US and you can buy the
book from Amazon (www.amazon.com) or FatBrain (www.fatbrain.com).

By buying them from me, you are doing several things:

1. You are helping Australian members of the Samba team to attend 
   US conferences on CIFS.

   There is a once yearly conference on CIFS in the US, and the proceeds
   from the sale of the Tshirts will be directed towards the expenses of 
   Australian Samba team members who do not get their expenses paid.
   Andrew is about the only person who gets his expenses paid.

2. You are helping me to continue to work on Samba and to work on the
   next Samba book.

   I have to have an income and at the moment, I find increasingly 
   difficult to find time to work on Samba. Indeed, when
   I was working on the SAMS Teach Yourself Samba book, I spent a lot of
   time working on Samba. (For example, I had to fix the SSL support in 
   Samba 2.0.x as well as fix divergences between the documentation and
   the code.)

   Proceeds from the sale of the book will help me find time to work
   on Samba and to work on the next book.

3. You will help to keep more money in Australia, rather than it going
   straight out of the country to Amazon or Fatbrain. 

   In addition, if you buy from Amazon you may end up paying more
   than the above prices after freight is added in.

4. You can be among the first people in Australia to get these Tshirts and
   the book.

HOW TO PURCHASE THESE ITEMS?

Either, physically catch up with me somewhere, like LinuxSA meetings or the
SAGE-AU conference in July or other venues, or

Somehow get the following into your favourite editor (notepad, vi, emacs,
pico, jove, whatever), fill in the relevant details, print it off and send
it along with cheque or money order for the relevant amount to:

    NS Computer Software & Services P/L
    PO Box 86
    Ingle Farm
    SA 5098

Please make cheques payable to NS Computer Software & Services P/L.

Your order will be posted out within about two weeks (our first order for
shirts has just been placed and they take about two and a half weeks to be
processed).  Similarly, the book will be available in about two weeks.

Errors and Omissions Excepted. This offer is made in good faith in the
expectation that suppliers will supply our initial order. All cheques
promptly returned if we cannot supply the goods.
