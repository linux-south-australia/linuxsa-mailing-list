SNIP

Hi Nick,

Good news and bad news ;-)
I don't have the onboard version, but I do have the CMI8330 sound
card working under linux (just). However, it is an ugly beast of
a Plug and Pray sound card, and due to its brainless PnP chipset
I have to boot the machine with a MSDOS bootdisk with the DOS drivers
for the card loaded onto it, then CTRL+ALT+DEL without the disk
into Linux. This initialises the CMI8330 (until poweroff) into
knowing its recources so that the standard SB16 modules can find
the device when they probe for it on kernel startup.

All that done and working, and I still can't get the damn MPU401
MIDI device to work (nor can I get audio from the CDROM).
Unless you're feeling like a challenge, I really would recomend
sticking with the SB16 (the onboard cmi8330 might be slightly 
better, but I doubt the PnP problem will go away ;-).

There was another option I read about where you can try and
find the WSS (Windows Sound System) device on the card to
drive the sound. This option sounded even more dubious to
me than the kludge I settled for, so I can neither confirm
nor deny its viability. I'm getting rid of mine as soon
I get an old AWE32 off a friend that is upgrading.

There are also a few docs out there for these kinds of cards
on the LDP I think. 

Good Luck,
-Daniel
