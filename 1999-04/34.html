Another ity bity protocol called "ARP" or the address resolution
protocol uses the MAC address of your ethercard - it is just a bit more
important than DHCP and BOOTP. It is used to resolve a destination IP
address on the "current" subnet to its corresponding ethernet address.
Without ARP, IP would not work over ethernet, unless you specified
static mappings between IP address and MAC addresses.

You are right though, playing with the MAC address of a network card can
cause havic on the network.

Every single layer three (network layer) protocol, such as IP, IPX, DDP
(Appletalk), Xerox XNS, DECNET, IPv6 that can run over IEEE 802.3 /
Ethernet uses the MAC address, in various different ways to deliver a
packet from one node to another node on the current (possibly bridged /
switched) ethernet segment.

The 48 bit address of a ethernet card should be world wide unique,
however, this does not mean we could use it instead of the IP address
for a few reasons (if I understand your question) :

* Ethernet is a LAN technology - it cannot be used in a WAN. Other
technologies are more appropriate for WAN connections (although I was
just reading today about a new standard called 1000BaseZX - Gigabit
ethernet running over fibre with a maximum distance of 90Km (Thats right
90 000 meters !))

* There are other datalink layer technologies which do not use IEEE MAC
addresses eg Apple Local Talk, ATM etc.

* The IP layer is used to "abstract" the differences between all the
varied and different network layer protocols. IP hides the differences
between all the data link layer technologies, and presents single
unreliable datagram service to the Transport layer protocols eg.
TCP/UDP. The IP address represents a location, independent of the
datalink layer technology used to communicate with it. eg. You can't
look at an IP address and guess whether the device it is allocated to is
using ATM, Ethernet, Token Ring, sneaker net, local talk, HDLC, PPP etc.

* The MAC address space is "flat" and is also issued randomly (by any
body off the street buying a NIC) ie. just like mobile phone numbers.
You cannot look at the first digit(s) of a MAC address, and say where it
is located. Therefore, you cannot get the benefits of grouping together
devices and summarising them. If MAC addresses were used instead of Ip
addresses, all the routers in the Internet would have to know where the
MAC address was located (ie. in what direction) so that it could send
packets to it. We group IP addresses together in the route tables by
using Network and subnet addresses. Also, IP addresses are allocated in
an orderly, controlled manner to ensure optimal routing occurs.

* Actually, as long as the MAC address is unique on the datalink layer
segment it is operating on, it doesn't have to be unique world wide. It
is just convenient to have the MAC address identify the vendor, and a
unique number, so that you can buy and ethernet card, and not have to
worry whether you have another ether card on your datalink layer segment
with the same MAC address.

Interestingly, it would appear that the 48 bits allocated for MAC
addresses hasn't been big enough, and IEEE have created a new 64 bit
long version called EUI-64. This will (in general) be used in IPv6 to
identify hosts. For devices which do not have either an EUI-64 or a IEEE
MAC address which can be converted to EUI-64, a sys admin can assign a
EUI-64 compatible identifier. 

Just because you can change the MAC address of your card, doesn't mean
that it changes all the time. You are right that DHCP and BOOTP do use
the MAC address of the card to identify the node and allocate the
address. You can stuff up the IP address allocation process by changing
your MAC address during the allocation process. Suprising how much we
trust people not to change their MAC address and cause trouble (and most
of the time they either don't know how, or don't bother). If you are
really interested in how BOOTP works, which would then also show how
changing the MAC address would affect it, read RFC951 (found on
www.ietf.org), which is the official protocol specification (you could
read the RFC for DHCP, but it is "just" an extension of BOOTP, but a lot
more complicated).

Have a look at
<A HREF="http://www.rootshell.com/archive-j457nxiqi3gq59dv/199711/arp_fun.txt">http://www.rootshell.com/archive-j457nxiqi3gq59dv/199711/arp_fun.txt</A> to
see what "fun" you can have by playing with MAC addresses and ARPs.

Mark.

&gt; Could somebody then tell me how DHCP or BOOTP can work if the mac address of
&gt; a NIC can change. The IP address is bound to the TCP/IP stack of the
&gt; computer, not the MAC address, this is used at the Data Link Layer (on the
&gt; NIC itself). DHCP and BOOTP require that the MAC address be sent to them via
&gt; a broadcast packet, which returns a packet via to the broadcasting MAC
&gt; address for configuring the TCP/IP stack. Woe behold a network admin that
&gt; has a person who decides, "Hmm let's change the MAC address on this card"
&gt; and they use the MAC address of another machine currently existing on this
&gt; network, where does the DHCP/BOOTP response go to ? Does it configure both
&gt; machines to the same address, name, etc ??
&gt; 
&gt; This makes no sense. The MAC is supposedly unique across the planet, exactly
&gt; for this purpose. Image two machines on the internet with the same MAC
&gt; address. Note that packets travelling across a network are based on the MAC
&gt; address. Remember an IP address identifies a machine not a NIC, to prove
&gt; this 127.0.0.1 is loopback, there is no physical NIC, the data link layer
&gt; reads the MAC address from the packet, this is unwrapped for the ip address
&gt; and then this is unwrapped for the protocol port that the packet is bound
&gt; for. The IP address is convenient for us to read, ie 32 bit, the mac address
&gt; is significantly bigger (can remember exactly, I think it's 48 bits).
&gt; 
&gt; I have never heard of an application talking directly to the network using
&gt; the MAC address, come-on even IP (generally considered the lowest layer you
&gt; can program on) uses IP addresses (hmmm, hence the name I suppose). The only
&gt; thing that I know of that uses MAC addresses is DHCP and BOOTP.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If it is based on MAC address then it might be useful.  Unfortunately
&gt; &gt;&gt; MAC addresses can be
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; a Changed on some chipsets
&gt; &gt;&gt; I beleive the LANCE chipset can change it's MAC address.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;All chipsets can change their MAC address, although some
&gt; &gt;will only let you do so during an initialisation sequence.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It has to be this way -- it is desirable for some applications
&gt; &gt;for the MAC address to belong to the machine and interface,
&gt; &gt;not the NIC.  An example is redundant chipsets.  Another
&gt; &gt;example is DECnet hosts, where changing the MAC address
&gt; &gt;changes the DECnet address (and DECnet addresses should
&gt; &gt;be static).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;These are unusual applications, but no chipset designer
&gt; &gt;is going to forego a part of a market, as it is impossible
&gt; &gt;to predict how important that market component might become
&gt; &gt;during the chipset's lifetime.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A good example if the handling of an obscure ethernet
&gt; &gt;feature called multicast.  The DEC Tulip chipset
&gt; &gt;handles this well, the LANCE chipset middlingly,
&gt; &gt;and the earlier Intel chipsets poorly.  So what
&gt; &gt;chipset will you find in the multimedia-oriented
&gt; &gt;computers?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Cheap network cards do-not alway map to a
&gt; &gt;&gt; vendor who has paid?? for their identifiers.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Unlikely.  Most manufacturers of cheap cards purchase
&gt; &gt;the ID ROMs from a third party.  The first three octets
&gt; &gt;of the MAC address may belong to that third party.
&gt; &gt;So cheap cards often look as if they pinched address
&gt; &gt;space from, say, Intel.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; So it would be interesting to see what it turns out to be.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Given that it is a virus, there is every chance that the
&gt; &gt;MAC address is that of the sender, not of the originator of
&gt; &gt;the document.
