Hi All,
    I am having a very strange problem with a server at the
moment. It will boot up and work fine for a period of time
(doesn't seem to be long short or any other), and then will
just apparently stop working. The server is the connection
to the world for a small Windoze 98 network and is running
RH 7.0. It is used for normal E-Mail, surfing, and serves
the company's WebPages (at present a single, simple were
here webpage). It also has a single modem dialin for users
to get after hours access.

    The problems is that the server is still running, and
still connected to the net through the modem, but for no
apparent reason it suddenly will stop serving mail to users,
allowing surfers through or outside users to dial in. I have
checked the server while on site and it appears to work
normally apart from these things. I can ping the network and
the outside, but the outside cannot ping the server or
retrieve mail or view the webpage. The machines on the
network can ping the server but not get through to the
dialup router through the server, and they can ping each
other.

    I have also checked the logs and there are no unusual
entries, except that there are no mail requests or pings or
any thing else logged while the machine is not serving
properly.

    Can anyone suggest how I might go about further
diagnosing this problem. It clears up if the server is
rebooted for another period of time and then goes again. At
present this machine is being rebooted almost as often as a
Windoze box. There are no obvious things wrong in server
config, it is almost a standard "out of the box" install
with some security measures added. When the entire system is
working, it works perfectly apart from this "hang"
situation, until it is rebooted.
    Thanks in advance,
        Andrew.
