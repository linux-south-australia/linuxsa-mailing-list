   CERT is also reporting on the sadmind/Microsoft-IIS vulnerability
   which is being actively exploited despite patches being available from
   Microsoft since October last year.

[... snip apache.org/sourceforge.net compromise ...]

   The Microsoft-IIS and apache.org attacks raise the possibility of very
   large numbers of machines falling under the control of a single person,
   or group of people acting in concert, as Microsoft and Apache between
   them account for the great majority of Internet web sites. Indeed,
   there is a chance that this may have already happened.

   Netcraft believes that it is more likely that the number of compromised
   Microsoft-IIS sites is in the order of hundreds of thousands rather
   than the 9000 figure widely reported in secondary coverage of
   attrition.org. In our own network security testing business,  around
   a third of the 41 Microsoft-IIS servers we have tested for the first
   time since the attrition.org posting have been vulnerable, while 4 had
   already been exploited, and taken control of by an attacker without the
   knowledge of the site owner. Around half of the internet's ecommerce
   sites run on Microsoft-IIS, and there is the potential for a great deal
   of economic damage.

So, how many people out there _don't_ keep their IIS servers patched up
with all current fixes?
