&gt; Firstly, I can't get my BSD box to dial up my ISP because the "tun"
&gt; device, which I apparently need, wasn't compiled for my default 4.2
&gt; install, or I did something wrong. Now, I've got the documentation to
&gt; fix it, but I don't have the time.

Hrmm.. Can't comment on 4.2 -- I've been using 4.3. For me, all I did was 
edit /etc/ppp.conf to my values (and made a backup, of course :-) and ran 
'ppp -auto papchap'.[1]

&gt; I managed to configure ALL my RedHat 7.1 stuff in about 15 minutes,
&gt; except for Sendmail which I accidentally blew up. To get the BSD stuff
&gt; up and running would take me hours of reading (not that I mind reading)
&gt; and buggering around.

Wowzers. Does that include the installation time? I didn't realise it could 
be so quick. Evidently I was wrong.[2]

&gt; My point is that I am much more "au fait" with a RedHat configuration
&gt; than BSD regardless of whether RedHat or BSD are superior to each other
&gt; or not. I'd have to do a heap more reading and I'll get around to it
&gt; _eventually_, and yes I know how to install stuff onto my BSD box (not
&gt; that I can convince the ports collection to do anything, but that's
&gt; because I haven't configured my RedHat 7.1 box to masquerade ftp through
&gt; correctly)...

I found that for the first few hours, but the documentation is -very- good, 
IMHO. The Handbook covers nearly everything I needed to know -- and more.

Most things are a more or less the same. There are differences -- some 
throwing you completely out of wack, but you get over them and move on. 
They're not showstoppers.[3]

[1] 'papchap' was the name of the default "account" or "service. I forget 
what they like to call it.

[2] Tounge in Cheek :-)

[3] All apart from my Xircom Modem/Ethernet card which I'm yet to get to 
function. If anyone could offer some advice I'd be ever so greatful to hear 
from you.
