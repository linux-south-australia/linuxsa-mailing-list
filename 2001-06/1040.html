&gt; Apple, on the other hand, is /not/ a software company:  Their bread
&gt; and butter is hardware -- They sell Macintoshes.  How do they convince
&gt; people to buy Macintoshes?  By also throwing-in the OS software which
&gt; permits application vendors to produce the apps which people love to use,
&gt; and formulating that OS software in a way which the same people also love
&gt; to use.

This was the classic model used by computer companies in the early days
of computing.  They made hardware, and valued the software only as a
tool to sell their boxes.  Initially the software was so tied to the
hardware that the manufacturers didn't really see any need to keep the
code secret.  Then manufacturers started cloning each other's hardware
(okay, manufacturers started cloning IBM's 360 hardware) and consequently
it became important to protect the software, which suddenly took on a
much more important roles as a distinguishing feature.

Fast forward 20 years, and real hardware manufacturers gather around
standards-based software, perhaps with some proprietary wrinkles, but
not a lot.  Hardware manufacturers have learned that those proprietary
wrinkles are a double-edged sword.  On the one hand they lock the
customer in; on the other hand customer's don't like being locked in,
and shy away from vendors who won't follow the standards.  Real hardware
manufacturers put full-page spreads on three or four consecutive odd
pages of The Australian, shouting their message of Linux to the world.
Real hardware manufacturers compete on the basis of their hardware,
not on the basis of their software.

I think Apple make great hardware.  I'm truly disappointed that the G4
cube was a run-away success -- as the most sexy computer ever built, it
deserved success.  But I don't think Apple are a real hardware company.
They write great software and only sell it on a limited platform.

Apple Computer should spin off their software assets (again), and call
the new company Macintosh Software (or maybe Taligent, or maybe Claris.)
Macinotsh Software would surely then port their beautiful creations
to Sparc, Intel, and Alpha, and would continue owning 8 - 15% of the
market share.  Apple Computer would probably go broke, but that would
be no tragedy.  They make nice hardware but so does IBM, Sun and a host
of other real hardware manufacturers.

They may make the computer for the rest of us, but their business model
is stuck in the 1970's.
