&gt; Hmmm. That's an interesting comment if you're reffering to Cisco. From my
&gt; research, a router that would be capable of sustaining 30 simultanious
&gt; connections at a maximum of 64Kbps wouldn't leave a lot of change from
&gt; $35-40K.

I wasn't refering to dialup access servers, or ADSL DSLAMs, but the
routers that connect such devices to the rest of the Internet. It makes
a network easier to control if you can have a border router distinct to
the edge router you connect customers to. In the case of Telstra's ADSL
system, you're paying for them to manage the edge, and then again for an
ATM concentrator at the ISP end, and then possibly again for the router
that connects said ISP to the Internet.

Just because a router has a 100Mb interface, that doesn't mean it can
route 100Mb/s of data. The 2600 and 3600 routers that are within reach
of most average ISP's can only push around 10Mb/s of bytes around at a
time, which is more than adequate in a non-broadband environment.

ADSL also attracts game players, who require approximately 6x more
packets/sec in throughput than regular downloaders. Routers are built to
move a certain number of packets in a certain amount of time while
performing a certain number of operations on them, rather than for a
specific bandwidth throughput.
