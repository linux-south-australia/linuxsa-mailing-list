&gt; While the following suggestions are sound, i think that a new comer will

&gt; see what all the fuss was about. Now they want me using a unix mail
&gt; client.", and then decides to leave the list and looses interest in
&gt; Linux/Unix. The fact that this was an administrator from a major collage
&gt; or school has set Linux acceptence back.

"If at all possible, use a UNIX mailer" NOT "Only use a UNIX mailer when
posting to this list.

&gt; It is almost like Microsoft saying that samba is buggy because the Windows
&gt; 95 client can't handle unkown SMB (I am sure Richard will correct me
&gt; here or expand on this).

Eh?

&gt; On a different note, sure, educate the user, but the server side needs to
&gt; be robust as well. For example intercepting HTML.

No. That's not the solution. Let them know about it and answer their
question rather than making them wait for the news that it's in HTML and
have them resend it. Just get on with it.

&gt; Of all the HTML posts I have seen to the list, none of them have seemed to
&gt; be deliberate or overly careless.

Does that get their problem solved? Nope. Let them know they've used
HTML (and we don't like it) and get on with answering their question.
