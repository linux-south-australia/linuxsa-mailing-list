&gt; Or you could put the read-only files onto a separate hard drive and set

Which would result in a system halt everytime someone wished to change
their password. Not a good move.

&gt; If the machine has a static load (eg, a dedicated server) or you're not
&gt; too worried about speed, you can use the CDROM for this instead.

Maybe, but again, too much stuffing around when you want to make a
change. The CDROM principle can be used when you want to create a "Quick
Restore" CD for when the server room melts. That's a little more
involved, though.

&gt; The mounts on the read/write media can be set to noexec, nodev, nosuid
&gt; to make life a little bit harder for anyone breaking in, but this is not
&gt; adequate in itself as root can remount.

No, it's not. I think Phil Hutton's suggesetion of LIDS combined with
David Lloyd's suggestion of FreeVeracity is a good start to a security
strategy that'll keep unwanted people out.

It needs to be combined with some alert mechanism so that you actually
know what's going on when it happens. An SMS message would suffice.

&gt; The same sort of thing can be used to create master images. Update the
&gt; configurations on the 'backup' machine, then make read-only copies to
&gt; put onto the main servers on a regular basis.

Yeah, but it becomes hard to do this if your employer doesn't want to
give you a box which is damn near identical to the original. Most of the
time the "original" will be a more beefy server. I can't see me being
given $8K to duplicate our webserver for when we want to make changes
:-)

&gt; Using another machine is such a reliable and low stress method of testing
&gt; changes without causing disruptions, that one of my questions at job
&gt; interviews is "Will I have the budget to purchase spare machines?".

It also can create headaches. It depends on the type of testing your
doing. For example, when I wanted to find out how FreeBSDs IP
Firewalling and NAT facilities worked, I didn't go installing it on the
Firewall. I've got a couple of dedicated "Development Servers" which I
use for just that.

Simple things like testing an Apache configuration change I don't bother
duplicating. There's 'apachectl configtest' to check the configuration
of the server, so I generally feel confident that the change I'm about
to make will work.

&gt; If the answer is "no", then I'm not really interested in working there
&gt; as this is a fair indication that the company treats its IT department
&gt; like crap.

Don't work in a State School then. Most of the State-owned/operated
schools aren't even given a decent Internet connection. Those that get
themselves a decent Internet connection and a bit of infrastructure get
treated like shit anyway. They've gone against the grain and uncover the
fact that their schemes are stupid. I know. I've been there.
