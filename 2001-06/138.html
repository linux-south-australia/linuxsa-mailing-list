Toby!

&gt; David, you've never heard of the ftape driver? it's been in linux for as
&gt; long as i can remember.. Version 2 is dated 1994, but i guess version 1 was
&gt; around a few years before that. I'm pretty sure if you did a search for
&gt; 'floppy drive' and 'tape drive' and 'linux', you'd get ftape in the first
&gt; page of results.

I don't have a floppy tape drive :-) I knew there just had to be an
easier way, and coming to think of it I may have noticed the ftape
driver in my kernel rebuild journeys.

&gt; If your home is larger than the size of your tapes, you'll need to
&gt; investigate the other tar options; there's quite a lot about tapes in there.
&gt; --tape-length xxx is how you specify the amount of data you want to write to
&gt; tape before you are prompted to change tapes. i guess thats the main thing
&gt; you'd need to know? Its been quite a while since i've used it myself.

If you use cpio or afio, I think they're able to complain to you that
they want a new volume if they suddenly run out of space.
