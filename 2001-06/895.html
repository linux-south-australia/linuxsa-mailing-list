You do this at your own risk, but I've resurrected a lot of dead RAIDs
with this technique.

First, I would recommend you do a raw block-by-block dump of the RAID
drives. This ensures that no matter what you do, you will not make the
existing situation any worse.

Now blow away the RAID configuration and re-make it. Be absolutely sure
to precisely replicate every single aspect of the original config, block
sizes, arrangements, and all.

Don't scrub the disks or wipe any blocks - just make the RAID software
put its structure in place and nothing else. It should hopefully put in
just the blocks it needs for its own view of the disks.

Now try and start the RAID. It should fire up OK, no matter how badly
you stuffed up the preceding steps. The acid test is whether the original
data is there or not. Since your RAID superblock got hammered, there's a
reasonable chance that some other blocks got hammered too.

If there's something there, you're in the clear. If there's nothing
there, don't give up straight away. Check that you re-made the RAID
properly, and try visually examining some raw blocks on the drive to
see if you can find anything recognisable, like text files, log files
or some other indication the disks weren't wiped.

Good luck.
