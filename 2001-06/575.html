Computing at Adelaide Uni is administered on a
departmental basis, so approach whomever supports
the computing environment in your department.

Certainly the printing systems in CompSci and
Engineering and Linux-friendly.

The odds of getting the Linux NCP packages to print
to the printers is quite low.  I used to do this
from the networks administered by IT Services
(Admin, etc) but now they use NDS for all authentication
and the 'guest' printing account no longer works.
This isn't unreasonable from a business point of
view -- some printers are loaded with cheque-printing
stationary and allowing access to all printers from
authentication-less protocols such as LPD is simply
unacceptable in that environment.

Your best bet would be to approach your departmental
computing officer and get them to activate the LPD
server on the printer in question.  I do this for
printing to a HP LaserJet 5M PS and it works just
fine.

A better alternative would be to acticate LPD
queuing on the Novell server for that printer
but this has some operational issues (it isn't
stable for all versions of NetWare).

NetWare have made statements about support for IPP,
I'm not sure if this is yet supported in their
products.  IPP is supported by CUPS under Linux.
