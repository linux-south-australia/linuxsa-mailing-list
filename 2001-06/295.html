Hi.

Forgive me for pointing out something ambiguous with this whole hardware
versus software raid argument.

On one hand I am told that software raid is better cause the hardware
cards have a low spec cpu on them, and spare cycles on the system cpu are
a much better resource for doing the raid calculations.

On the other hand, when Mike says that software raid loaded up his box,
the response is that he must be mistaken, because 'they're not nearly as
cpu intensive as you would think'

Which is it?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmm.  Do you have a source for this information?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Regardless of where Glen got his information, what do you think sounds
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; a more plausible version of his statement?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It's from testing I did on an old Sun box, now that
&gt; &gt;&gt; I think about it almost a decade ago.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; The "file manager" approach was a lot less common then,
&gt; &gt;&gt; so I take Greg's point about directory traversal.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You question was where did I think the bottle neck was ? right. Well
&gt; &gt; the only difference was the software raid 5 calculations so that
&gt; &gt; must have been the bottle neck.
&gt; 
&gt; I consider that unlikely.  They're not nearly as CPU intensive as you
&gt; would think.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I could see in top that the 'user' load have not increase much but
&gt; &gt; 'system' load had increased dramatically. This would also indicate
&gt; &gt; that the load was in the kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; Correct.  But you'd need to profile it to find where the real issue
&gt; was.  Vinum RAID-5 calculations make almost no difference.
