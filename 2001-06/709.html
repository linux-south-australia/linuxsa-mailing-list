You should CC this to the redhat install maker people ?
I mean, after all, that really is quite stupid (the fstab thing).

Subject: Getting Killed by XMMS and RedHat Installer Stupidity


&gt;
&gt; Grrrr!
&gt;
&gt; I decided that XFS is a good thing and to put it into production on my
&gt; main computer. Reasons:
&gt;
&gt; 1) reliability
&gt;
&gt; It's a journaling file system and it's been in production under IRIX for
&gt; years. This doesn't mean there's no bugs in the Linux incarnation, just
&gt; that the concepts it uses are sound.
&gt;
&gt; 2) speed
&gt;
&gt; It's most definitely faster than ext2 even though I can't get bonnie++
&gt; to say so on my test machine. Let's just say that I know how fast my
&gt; machines went under ext2 and XFS "feels" faster
&gt;
&gt; However, that's not the point of this story.
&gt;
&gt; To install it, I used SGI's pre-made RedHat 7.1 installer disc. This was
&gt; all very well, and my install chugged along quite nicely. Furthermore,
&gt; I'd made sure that I stacked my "X-Capable" monitor onto the machine
&gt; because under a RedHat Install - even if you force it into text - having
&gt; an X setup crash with my oldest monitor sends it into a spin and I can't
&gt; recover.
&gt;
&gt; Lo and behold!
&gt;
&gt; My media is damaged on xmms-devel-some numbers.rpm.
&gt;
&gt; And I can't convince the STUPID installer to continue.
&gt;
&gt; Eventually I think "F!@#$K this" and decide to do a reboot and a linux
&gt; rescue (because it was literally about 2 SECONDS away from the end of
&gt; package install).
&gt;
&gt; Wonders beyond belief! NO linux installations are detected AT ALL :-(
&gt;
&gt; So I fdisk, work out what should be what and start mounting things. It
&gt; didn't help that I'd mixed up /home and /var but I got the system KIND
&gt; OF working...
&gt;
&gt; However, I discovered that RedHat sets up /etc/fstab AFTER (yes AFTER)
&gt; package install and the system came down in one great heap (for the
&gt; second time - by this time I'd thrown my FreeBSD 4.2 disc against the
&gt; wall, thereby breaking it, not because BSD is crap but because it
&gt; happened to be the least expensive breakable things around me).
&gt;
&gt; Nonetheless, after 6 hours of gettting my production system back into
&gt; production it's working. And thankfully, this time I had multiple cpio
&gt; and tar backups of all file systems but /usr which went on without a
&gt; glitch.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;sigh&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Moral of the story: If you're writing an installer make sure that the
&gt; install does the most important things FIRST.
&gt;
&gt; :-(
