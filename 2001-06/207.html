Hi all,

Time for another something that is kind of off topic :)

I have to do a small presentation as part of the graduate training at
the company that I work. The topic is somewhat open except for the fact
that it has to deal with University life and so I have decided to talk
about the benifits that uni students can gain from contibuting to
opensource software.

Personally I think it can be a benefit as it allows students to produce
something a little more productive than yet another console based "print
out some calculated results" type thing that is usually done at uni's.
Also, it allows them to come into contact with other coders and end
users and deal with all aspects of software.... well thats what I think
anyway :)

Anyway, I was just wondering how many students are on here, and how many
of them are contibuting to projects, whether they be thier own, or
someone elses.

To keep unwanted replies from the mailing list, reply to my address with
any details you would like to give reguaring to whether or not you
contribute.

Also, for anyone else who has a view on reasons that students
should/should contribute to opensource software, send them on.

Cheers
