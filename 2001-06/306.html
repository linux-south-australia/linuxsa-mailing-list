&gt; It's also interesting that in the US, they tend to use single

I believe that this is incorrect spelling even in the US.

&gt; UK spelling rules say that if the vowel is "open" or "long" (i.e. a
&gt; diphthong), then you use a single letter before the
&gt; consonant-vowel sequence, whereas if it is "closed" or "short"
&gt; (i.e. a simple vowel), then the consonant must be doubled to
&gt; protect it from the following vowel. Thus "programmed",
&gt; "programming", but "gamed", "gaming".

This probably applies in the US as well.

&gt; In the case of "disk", it seems that the US usage is "disk",
&gt; and UK is "disc".

The SOED has 'disk'.

&gt; They both come from Latin "discus" or French "disque".

Which in turn came from the Greek 'diskos'.

&gt; Once again, UK usage tends to be more traditional whereas US
&gt; spelling is more logical.  Similarly they tend to use "z" where we
&gt; use a voiced "s".

The famous -ize suffix.  Again, this came from Greek (-izein).  The
spelling with -ise come from French.  SOED prefers -ize.  Macquarie
does not allow -ize.

&gt; It's always very interesting to see how all of these spelling
&gt; differences play out in Australia, particularly in computing, where
&gt; the US influence is strong. Since WW2, Australian governments have
&gt; tried to progressively remove UK influence and welcome US influence
&gt; (because the UK couldn't protect Australia from the Japanese and the
&gt; US had to be called in).  Hence we got a dollar instead of a decimal
&gt; pound in 1966.

This analogy is stretched.  As the examples above show, Australian
spelling is typically to the other side of British from American.

&gt; Thankfully we don't have two different words for everything in
&gt; computing as they have in the French language!

They do?
