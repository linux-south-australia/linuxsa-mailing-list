Wow, a time traveller :-)

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what people's experience with RH7.1 was?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have just spent a week in a room with 11 PCs all running Rh7.1, and we 
&gt;&gt; saw almost all of the have file system damage.  Some several times.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; This seems unusual.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I tried installing 7.1 on a VIA chipset system, and found that 
&gt; while the install would be fine, major corruption of partitions 
&gt; would occur later when two IDE disks were accessed together 
&gt; (i.e. copying files from one disk to another).  

No VIA chip set here. Good ol' Intel PIIX4 or whatever.

&gt; 7.1 has the 2.4.2 kernel.  Looking at the kernel change logs, 
&gt; I noticed that 2.4.3 had a workaround and 2.4.4 had an "official" 
&gt; fix from VIA for the kernel to fix disk corruption problems... 
&gt; so I've upgraded to 2.4.5, and all has since been well (running 
&gt; for about 10 days, and file copies that previously guaranteed 
&gt; a failure have executed without a hitch).  
&gt; 
&gt; The ability to change a major component like the kernel without 
&gt; having to change the entire system is one place where GNU/Linux 
&gt; really shines.  

What's with this GUN/Linux shit? Has RMS been browbeating you as well :-)
