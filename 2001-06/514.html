When you created the file system, which version did you pass?

I think it creates ver 1 FSs by default, but you need ver 2 to get the large
file support, etc..

Also, have you tried later kernel versions? reiser still seems to be getting
bugs ironed out of it.. the version that came with 2.4.2 had a few bugs, it
seems, and even 2.4.5 still needs an extra patch for reiser.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I was doing some testing of a 53GB reiserfs file system on a machine I am
&gt; building to see what the performance was like, and I stumbled across a
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; If I try to create a file larger than 4,294,967,295 bytes (2^32-1), it
&gt; simply stops at that point and the copy command (cat, dd, whatever) hangs.
&gt; The system keeps going, just the command you are using hangs.
&gt;
&gt; This does not occur with an EXT2 file system, only a ReiserFS on RedHat 7.1
&gt; with Linux 2.4.2 ...
&gt;
&gt; I have also tried it with a smaller ReiserFS partition, like 18GB, but the
&gt; same results.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else seen this?
&gt;
&gt; Regards
