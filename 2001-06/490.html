&gt; My Xircom Eth/Modem autodetects under RH7.1, I guess it should under Debian in 
&gt; about a year :-)

I think this is exactly the point. The Debian installer is not very good
at all compared to Red Hat and others.

But people who use Debian don't really need a good installer, even if
they'd quite like it. They mostly put a minimal system on and type
"apt-get" every time they come across something they need. Connectiva
users have the same convenience. I'm running both systems, and also
FreeBSD which can be used in a similar way. Absolutely ideal for servers,
gateways, nicely-tuned systems for developers, etc. I'm typing this from a
Debian machine with a bit under 20k files on it installed from packages,
and I know there is a good reason for every one of those files to be
present. I can find out what the reason is pretty quickly too.

But I'm also running Mandrake and Red Hat systems, and I find that the
care put into their installation and administration systems mean that they
are suitable for a completely different kind of user, or even me with a
different hat on. Mandrake 8.0 in particular, which has the best installer
I have seen anywhere, and a consistent set of administration tools. There
is a very good chance that if you have a modern machine with a few
accessories, that Mandrake 8.0 will install something that gives the
Windows-like experience of mostly knowing about your video, sound and
networking hardware most of the time within 15 minutes or so.  Not only
that, but Xfree86 4.0 will be running with a late version of whatever
Window manager you like, or all of them. And the administration tools are
consistent and very slick. (If you like Debian and want this experience
then you can try Progeny.) I don't have the very latest SuSE, but until
the latest-but-one I've found it comparable to Red Hat.
