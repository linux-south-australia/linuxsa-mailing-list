Steve,

Have you tried tracing packets on port 53?

I did this and found that the BigPond secondary has been ignoring
all notify messages for many months now - maybe years.
They told me they just ignore the notify messages.
I was also told that they update of their own accord on a regular
basis.
Well, that doesn't fit the facts either.
I have about 16 domains, and they just seem to
miss out on some of these altogether, and the others are patchy
adn less frequent than they should be.

In a check over 12 days in April, various domains names were
queried by the BPD secondary machine this often:

 2
12
11
 6
 7
 5
 6
 5
 5
 6
 6
 6
 0     &lt;- not checked at all! (topology.org)
 5
 8
 2
 9          

When I contacted them, I was told that if it doesn't work,
you have to update manually.

In the "custdata" pages:
<A HREF="http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/manage.htm">http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/manage.htm</A>
there's a page somewhere to initiate an update query
by the secondary from your primary.
That seems to work most of the time.

All in all, it is not satistfactory!
I woudln't bet your business on it.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
 
PS. This seems to have nothing to do with the BIND version number.
