Hmmm!

I see you want a flame war. This is not a flame war...but...

&gt;     I was serious, but I wasn't targeting anybody specific.

Crap. I was the one who wrote the mail. If you don't have the guts to
mention my name, that's fine. I've mentioned my name. You were
targetting me.

Do I make myself VERY clear?

Let's bring the facts here.

I posted the SUPPOSED flame. I was the ONLY person who commented on the
HTML e-mail. I am not a total idiot or absolutely stupid and - I hope
the others on this list don't take umbrage - neither are they.

Might I point out that under the law of libel you don't have to
specifically name the party you refer to. You just need to create the
impression.

&gt; However, I still believe that If I was an absolute newbie
&gt; who hadn't posted to this list before and received a reply
&gt; to my innocent request for help that could be seen by some
&gt; as a personal attack, over a crime I didn't even know I had
&gt; committed, I would certainly have second thoughts about
&gt; posting again.

Perhaps. Maybe you would be like "Pegasus" (I can't think of a better
name to call him/her/them apart from their official RFC name) and read
e-mails until you understood them. Perhaps you're just too lazy.

Incidentally, that may be classified as flame material but I think it's
painfully obvious that YOU are taking umbrage to what I, that is David
Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@rebel.net.au">lloy0076@rebel.net.au</A>&gt;, wrote. Not "Pegasus".

&gt; If I received an answer to my question and a
&gt; polite reminder that I had sinned, then I would be much more
&gt; likely to fix the error of my ways and continue to become a
&gt; member of the community, and encourage others to do so.

If you received a slap around the ear you would too. Funny that.

&gt; Please remember that a newbie probably hasn't been on the
&gt; list long enough to know your posting habits or likely
&gt; responses.

I don't care. A newbie to this list is probably more than 15 years of
age, and the last 15 year old I managed to upset because of HTML e-mail
is still on this list and does, occasionally, speak to me DIRECTLY for
help.

Funny thing is, I do help him, if only to put him onto the right
documents that will tell him the answer.

Totally unhelpful then, aren't I? [maybe I should be green and look like
Yoda....maybe then I'd have an excuse for people (I would have said
dimwits but that's RUDE) to misunderstand me]

&gt; then nobody else has offered to help either. I would suggest
&gt; that this implies that it isn't that big an issue for those
&gt; others subscribed to the list because they cannot be
&gt; bothered to fix the problem. 

It isn't? Then why are YOU making such an issue of it eh? If you don't
care then, basically, stay silent.

&gt; If this is the case, then why
&gt; are people still complaining about it.

<A HREF="http://grog.lemis.com/email.html">http://grog.lemis.com/email.html</A>

And besides, Microsoft TFNET Craplook HTML is not interpratable by my
mail reader.

&gt; If you are too lazy
&gt; to fix something that annoys you, then you are obviously not
&gt; annoyed by it that much.

No, suprising that. Had I been annoyed I would have written:

"YOU ARE A TOTAL DUMB TWAT WITH A BUGGERED UP MIND AND I THINK YOU
SHOULD GO TO HELL BECAUSE YOU WROTE HTML EMAIL TO A LINUXSA LIST".

In fact, what I wrote was rather OBVIOUS and OUTRIGHT satirical
bitchiness between MARKUP that said it was.

How much more do I have to belabour that point?

&gt; As far as I know, this list runs on
&gt; an open source list server software (major-domo I think)

You think.

&lt;sigh&gt;

Whatever list software it's running under isn't majordomo.

AT ALL.

It doesn't even reek of majordomo.

Try getting your facts right.

[the Cornelia "you are the weakest link" is being resisted...I shall not
be assimilated]

&gt; the point I tried to make was that if someone doesn't like
&gt; HTML mail that much, then modify the software to fix it (ie
&gt; scratch that "I don't like HTML mail and the list software
&gt; doesn't filter it" itch).

The point is that I help people and I will tell them to stop sending
HTML e-mail. I generally don't frighten people off and if I think I have
I take steps to make sure they don't go wander. Yes, I have done that
before, and yes they have come back.

I can actually clear up misunderstandings with people, well, apparently
at least until now.

And this misunderstanding is NOT between Pegasus, LinuxSA and me. It's
between you and me.

&gt;     If you went to a new group of people instead of an
&gt; anonymous newsgroup, and you asked a simple question to
&gt; someone, and that person's response was to berate you
&gt; because members of the group all wear bow ties and you were
&gt; wearing a bandanna, even if all the other members knew from
&gt; experience that this person would react that way, how do you
&gt; as the new person find out if nobody tells you? If someone
&gt; you didn't know got stuck into you because of your standard

Why don't you go to the local FreeMasons and gate crash them with a
bandana and see what reaction you get...and don't even dare say I
wouldn't know. If you're a FreeMason, I'll prove you up until the second
degree.? That is just GIBBERISH.

I've seen some members of that order who will correct initiates in a
polite formal manner, and others who will beat you over the head with a
great stick. You'll learn from both types of teaching...but you'll be
prepared more for the real world if you learn to accept that the guy who
beats you over the head with a stick happens to know a lot and happens
to beat you over the head for a reason.

Tell me that you would like all newbies to post to this list with
Microsoft TNEF Outlook HTML e-mail and I'll just shut up.

Have I made my point yet?
