Hi Guys,

A BIG thanks for the users who offered suggestions regarding the RPM
software.

For those who may not remember, I tried doing an upgrade on the RPM
installer after downloading it but found that there where just too many
dependencies, I downloaded upgrades to try and satisfy those dependancies,
but within those there were more dependancies. So I pulled out the Redhat
7.0 cd and done a complete upgrade (from 6.2).

Cheers

Wayne

&gt; &gt;  Hello All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I have Redhat 6.2 on my PC, which includes RPM 3.0.4
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Whenever I try to install a package which has a major version number of
4,
&gt; &gt;  RPM spits back with the following message.
&gt; &gt;  'only packages with major numbers &lt;= 3 are supported by this version of
&gt; &gt; RPM'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Which is OK, so I downloaded RPM version 4, which is also an rpm
package,
&gt; &gt; but it cannot be installed by the current RPM  ah-la same problem as
above,
&gt; &gt; RPM version 3 cannot extract packages which are version 4's.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  I could possibly down load the source for RPM version 4, but I don't
think
&gt; &gt; I have the source/libraries installed to compile it. Other than
upgrading my
&gt; &gt; whole machine  to Redhat 7, what should I do to get around this problem
?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Thanks
&gt; &gt;

&gt; Hi Wayne,
&gt; Don't know if you still need help....
&gt; Your best off either upgrading to RH7.1
&gt; (unless you have a cyrix chip - but that is a long story)
&gt; Or  build from source but note thet you will need to upgrade your DB stuff
to DB3.
&gt; The RPM site has the appropriate links (or did months ago).
&gt; BTW that may be why it's quicker and easier to go for 7.1..
&gt; Australian Personal Computer have another of those stickons out this month
. The install process is very good though I had problems with the Kernel
version and my CPU.
&gt; (HINT; don't leave linear mode (the default) selected when you get to the
LILO bit.)
