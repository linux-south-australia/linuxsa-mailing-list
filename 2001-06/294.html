&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if it is possible to send an encryted print job via LPD to
&gt; a Win32 box.

This is in a general class of problem that says: "how do I get protocol X
encrypted if I'm using a Windows box at one or even both ends of a
connection and the Windows software has, of course, no clue about
encyption?"

The answer is much the same as it is on Unix, where you wrap the protocol
with ssh. Go to <A HREF="http://www.openssh.org/windows.html">http://www.openssh.org/windows.html</A> and pick a Windows
client you like and which does port forwarding (the -L switch, under
openssh and copycat implementations.) Not Windows versions do forwarding.

The setup is as simple as this:

   Run sshd on the Unix box

   Run ssh with -L (or equivalent switch, depending which implementation
   you choose) on the Windows box, redirecting the
   [lpr/imap/pop/smtp/whatever] port to a remote server

   Run your application, pointing it at the forwarded local port. In your
   case, tell the lpr client software that the lpd daemon is on the local
   computer (because it is!)

This seems like black magic, but it is very simple. If I were to do this
for telnet (for instance) on a Windows computer, I could open up Windows
terminal and connect to localhost port 23, and I would see a login prompt
for the remote Unix machine. And the entire connection would be secure,
even though telnet does plain text passwords and other insecure things.

You get a bonus as well in a lot of cases from the fact that ssh does
compression too.
