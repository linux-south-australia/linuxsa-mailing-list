Michael!

&gt; Versions of software?  Sheesh.  Before you start bagging, let us know what your
&gt; h/w setup is, and what versions you're running.

Hardware Setup:

The X Server:
* an ubiquitous floppy drive
* ancient 4Gb Caviar 5400 RPM WDC drive
* 50X CDROM
* Riva TNT2 Ultra32Mb
* 160Mb of SDRAM (100MHZ)
* AMD-K6-III 450
* MSI(something) board

(Some) of the X Clients:
* ubiquitous floppy drive
* resonably modern 18.2Gb WDB drive (about 5 times as fast as the
Caviar)
* 32X SCSI Cdrom
* 4x2x32 (W, RW, R) IDE CDROM
* Titan Graphics Reactor AGP Video Card 32Mb
* AMD-ATHLON (an original one) @ 650MHZ
* MSI6167 Irongate Board

Software:

* an SGI XFS Patched kernel
* RedHat 7.1, no updates, no customisation except for things like
appearance etc
* XFree86 4.0.2, Sawfish et al

Now, I run X remotely, so it gets more interesting. I either run on a
crossover cable network or coax (depending on what mood I'm in) and
neither of them used to be anywhere near capacity even when running
multiple copies of Netscape.

Futhermore, this implies that there may be memory leaks in Netscape 4.76
or OpenOffice 625 or 627 rather than X/GNOME, although if I leave them
running long enough even local programs look "relatively" sluggish. By
"relatively" they display slower than they should.

Restarting X fixes the problem.

Furthermore, I also run a default FreeBSD 4.2 on an even more ancient
1.2Gb hard drive that is prone to have DMA failures and fall back to PIO
mode and this behaviour has never occured before no matter what. My
point is that I strongly suspect that it's something to do with Linux
and not my hardware per se.

Admittedly I run a patched kernel, but it's an official SGI Open Source
release and noone else is complaining of such behaviour. Furthermore if
the kernel itself was playing up I'd expect that everything and not just
X would misbehave.

I should stress, strongly, that the only thing that goes slow is the
display; the clients seem to run at normal speed once I can activate
them with some dialog or whatever.

Mozilla 0.7 - running locally on the K6-III - as installed by RH 7.1
runs a charm provided the other behaviour hasn't occured or is not
occuring.

&gt; My laptop (PIII 600MHz) with RH7.1 with the latest Ximian GNOME has only
&gt; *improved* with speed over time :-)

I've always found X painful to use; it's becoming less painful but more
bloated. I'm not sure whether there really was/is something wrong with
fvwm or twm :-(
