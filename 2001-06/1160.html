&gt;ISPs who use Telstra's wholesale ADSL offering purchase access in
&gt;geographical regions.
&gt;
&gt;So what I should have said was, "If that says you can get ADSL, you can
&gt;actually get it through any provider who is servicing your geographical
&gt;region, not just Telstra."  Apologies for the lack of specicifity, I was
&gt;lulled by the fact that most of the active participants on this list are
&gt;in the Adelaide metro area.
&gt;
&gt;The regions are pretty large - Metropolitan Adelaide is one, for example.

So in the country how big are the regions, ie. say if you wanted it in the 
region of whyalla, how far would that get you, would that cover the entire 
iron triangle....

What I am getting at here is that I know some businesses in whyalla that 
want business grade ADSL connections, the main whyalla exchange is now ADSL 
capable, the sh*t thing is is that Bigpond direct ADSL is absolutely 
stupidly expensive, and is not available in Whyalla yet but is 'being 
considered' by telstra... the users that we want to sign up are people that 
want something faster than a modem connection but ISDN is too expensive, 
otherwise I just would have used BPD modem connections...

So what is the likelyhood in the future of other ISPs (yes.... IPA) of 
extending into the secondary cities. I have already heard that it is rather 
expensive, thats why I wanted to know how big the regions are, are there any 
webpages on telstras site which show the region borders?? so for example if 
the region covers the iron triangle it might prove profitable, 3 large 
cities that are bandwidth hungry all in one zone.... hmmm... somehow I don't 
think telstra would be that stupid though.

Cheers,


Michael
