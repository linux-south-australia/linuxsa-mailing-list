 &gt; I was under the impression that only telstra have DSLAMs in the exchanges,

 &gt; can't get it with *anyone* ?
 
If the exchange is full, Telstra *WILL* upgrade it...

... but not without customer orders.

So if you want it, and the exchange capacity is exceeded, order it and
expect that it might take a few months for your order to be satisfied.
In the meantime you can continue to use other connectivity methods.

At work we have a handful of orders on-hold right now, because we're 
waiting for exchanges to be upgraded.  I don't think we've had an order
refused due to a full exchange, only delayed.

 &gt; Apparently the 3 gb cap is total transfers - ie. upload + download.
 
Yeah?  Wow!  I'm speechless.

 &gt; So, 1 Gb per person, and then minus a chunk due to uploads and general
 &gt; backtraffic. Bloody hell. What next, a 0 byte cap? You just pay for the
 &gt; priveledge of giving Telstra money.

So use someone else, Toby.  Like I said, Telstra almost always offer
the worst deal on the market.  They're a dominant infrastructure provider,
with almost zero competitive pricing pressure and very little incentive
to offer good customer service, and it shows in almost every facet of
the way they do business.  So use someone else.  *Anyone* else. 

As far as exchange upgrading is concerned, an order from one of Bigpond's
competitors is just as likely to get the process moving as an order from
Bigpond.
