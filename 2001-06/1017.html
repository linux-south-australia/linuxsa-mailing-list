 &gt; Isn't Aqua another competitor for GNOME/KDE?  Why have another group
 &gt; of people expending great effort to produce a really nice UI on top
 &gt; of a *nix?  Imagine if that innovation could be pooled.  **boggle**

&lt;shrug&gt;  Take the same argument to the GNOME and KDE people and see how
far you get.

Diversity is a strength, really, don't you think?

 &gt; &gt; Apple, on the other hand, is /not/ a software company:  Their bread
 &gt; &gt; and butter is hardware -- They sell Macintoshes.  How do they convince
 &gt; &gt; people to buy Macintoshes?  By also throwing-in the OS software which
 &gt; &gt; permits application vendors to produce the apps which people love to use,
 &gt; &gt; and formulating that OS software in a way which the same people also love
 &gt; &gt; to use.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So Apple, being a hardware company, is not primarily focussed on selling 
 &gt; software?  Why then is the software such an asset which could not be open 
 &gt; sourced? 

Obviously people want the software;  it's one of the levers which convinces
them to buy the hardware.  If you could run the software without buying the
hardware, nobody would buy the hardware, and Apple would cease to exist.

 &gt; I think Apple are more of a software company which makes money from 
 &gt; selling it's hardware that people have no choice in buying if they
 &gt; want MacOS - ie. no-one cares about their hardware except to run MacOS
 &gt; on it.

&lt;shrug&gt;  That's really nothing more than a difference in perspective.
Again, I put it to you that if you didn't need their hardware to run 
MacOS, they would disappear overnight.

 &gt; &gt; What happens if that operating system software gets ported to Intel? 
 &gt; &gt; People stop buying Macintoshes.  Period.  Would a graphical designer
 &gt; &gt; buy a Mac to run Photoshop if the same software, with the same look and
 &gt; &gt; feel, on the same OS, was available on a $2000 kick-ass PC?  Of course
 &gt; &gt; not, that'd be stupid.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I understand that this is the case.  The economic survival of Apple
 &gt; is tied to selling Macintoshes.  But the UI is still closed.  You and
 &gt; I can't tinker.  And that will affect it's potential uptake and community.
 &gt; What if Apple decided to GPL all but a very small layer of software, so
 &gt; that their UI was tied to Mac hardware, but was mostly open;

What, you mean the same way that AT&T approved the release of all but
a very small layer of BSD kernel code, so that it couldn't actually 
be built into a viable operating system?  How long do you think it took
for volunteers to reverse-engineer the missing bits?

It's a bit naive to think that a company can release 90% of a product to
the public, without the public building the remaining 10% for themselves.

 &gt; or open all of 
 &gt; it and perhaps licence the software that it cannot be ported to another 
 &gt; processor?

It has already been ported to another processor:  The machine-dependent
bits of the MacOS (the Darwin kernel) were ported to Intel by Apple, where
they are officially supported to this day.  They can't release the rest
of MacOS without it running on Intel as a fait accomplis.

 &gt; &gt; To say it's in Apple's best interests to keep the MacOS away from Intel
 &gt; &gt; is a bizarre understatement.  Keeping MacOS on Mac hardware is 100% 
 &gt; &gt; *essential* to Apple's survival.  So why, pray tell, do they have any
 &gt; &gt; reason at all to open-source the OS?
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; Enquiring minds what to know.
 &gt; 
 &gt; With all due respect, I am not primarily concerned for Apple's survival.  
 &gt; Apple's shareholders are. 

... and Apple is, because it has a legal obligation to those shareholders.
Do you think the directors of Apple want to open themselves to the kind
of legal action which will land them in jail by carrying out an action 
which will result in the almost immediate total demise of the company?

 &gt; I have no desire for Apple's demise, but that is not 
 &gt; my primary concern here.  I'm concerned about having the best computing 
 &gt; platform available for use - and that use includes the ability to make 
 &gt; modifications, fix bugs and develop further. 

Interesting perspective, but I'm not sure that it's shared by Apple.  
They're not concerned with "having the best computing platform available
for use," they're more worried about selling Macs.
