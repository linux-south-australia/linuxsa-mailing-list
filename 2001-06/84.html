&gt; I shall turn my modem off tonight and tomorrow and see if it happens
&gt; again...

ok... I've turned the modem off at night and during the day for a few days
running, and my computer has not powered itself up... The theory that I
presently have is that it's WoL. After doing some research, it seems that
WoL requires some knowledge of the MAC address of the network card. However,
contrary to what some think, the packet certainly can be encapsulated within
IP...

My understanding is that you could send a UDP datagram to my IP address,
containing:

a string of F's
my MAC address repeated at least 8 times.

and some other stuff


and my computer would turn on, despite the fact that there is no TCP/IP
stack running. I think what could be happenning is someone is sending these
packets from the internet somewhere, to my IP address, which comes to my
ADSL-Ethernet bridge, which addresses it to my MAC address, which goes to my
switch, which goes to my PC, which switches it on... hence, to get a packet
to my machine, you don't need to know my MAC address, but to actually turn
my machine on, you would need to know it for the content of the datagram.
Does this theory make sense? Is there any way to get hold of my MAC address
from the outside world? (10 points to anyone who can tell me mine :)

Bear in mind that I am not on a modem, I'm on an ADSL-Ethernet bridge....
