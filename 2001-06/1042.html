&gt; Subject: [OT] Digital cameras
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If there's anywhere to ask for an opinion, this seems to be the place. :)
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking at getting a digital camera. I'd like to be able to take a lot
&gt; of photos while flying or travelling on holidays. It should be small, easy
&gt; to use and robust. It should also be a sexy little gadget. :)
&gt;
&gt; Currently I'm looking at a Canon IXUSv, which is 2.1Mp, 2x optical zoom,
&gt; can record video with audio in 30 second snippets, comes with 8MB memory
&gt; card and costs about $1k. This isn't enough memory for what I want so I'd
&gt; have to go buy a 128MB flash card as well.
&gt;
&gt; Any other recommendations? I was thinking if I got a camera with plenty
&gt; of battery power and could plug in a 1GB microdrive, I would be able to
&gt; record a lot of images as well as using it as a video camera. Is there
&gt; any feasibility to this idea?
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, is 2x zoom as useless as I think it is?
&gt;
&gt; I've looked around at a lot of web sites, but I can't find anywhere that
&gt; is willing to give an opinion or recommendation.
