&gt; &gt; Once again, UK usage tends to be more traditional whereas US

&gt; The famous -ize suffix.  Again, this came from Greek (-izein).  The
&gt; spelling with -ise come from French.  SOED prefers -ize.  Macquarie
&gt; does not allow -ize.

My History of English Language teacher said it is more complicated than
that. Before the 1900s careful English users had "ize" for words of many
derivations, and "ise" for those of more recent French derivation. The
American usage tended to have "ise", apparently. Then around the time of
WWII this swopped around, and the Americans went "ize" and the UK went
mostly "ise" except for certain specific words. Australia went its own
cheerful way, which we have now.

On a similarly irrelvant note, I have seen a difference in US usage
compared to UK/Australian usage in terms of word choices - the US seems to
prefer words of German origin and UK/Australian French. This might be
relevant to spellings, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to make any
conclusions.

&gt; &gt; Thankfully we don't have two different words for everything in
&gt; &gt; computing as they have in the French language!
&gt; 
&gt; They do?

They do not (although many French computing professionals understand of
the key English nouns as well the French terms.)
