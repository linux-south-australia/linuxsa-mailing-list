&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I was wondering what people's experience with RH7.1 was?
&gt; 
&gt; I have just spent a week in a room with 11 PCs all running Rh7.1, and we 
&gt; saw almost all of the have file system damage.  Some several times.
&gt; 
&gt; This seems unusual.

I tried installing 7.1 on a VIA chipset system, and found that 
while the install would be fine, major corruption of partitions 
would occur later when two IDE disks were accessed together 
(i.e. copying files from one disk to another).  

7.1 has the 2.4.2 kernel.  Looking at the kernel change logs, 
I noticed that 2.4.3 had a workaround and 2.4.4 had an "official" 
fix from VIA for the kernel to fix disk corruption problems... 
so I've upgraded to 2.4.5, and all has since been well (running 
for about 10 days, and file copies that previously guaranteed 
a failure have executed without a hitch).  

The ability to change a major component like the kernel without 
having to change the entire system is one place where GNU/Linux 
really shines.  

So if the systems had a VIA chipset, this might have been 
the problem.  

cheers,
