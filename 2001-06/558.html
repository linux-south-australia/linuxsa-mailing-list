&gt;
&gt; Curiosity has got the better of me.

I believe the limitation is an intel one. Remeber the old days in dos
where there was only 640K ram to play with? (hmm it's not that long ago)
Well the kernel is forced to stick with this model (architecture
bug/feature).

If the kernel is bigger than this then it won't be able to load. A zImage
will fit in this region. bzImage is for bigger kernels. It uses the 640K
and some of the high memory area. That is the spot between the 640K and
the extended memory. 640K&lt; x &lt; 1M. This is normally memory reserved for
various different cards, bios shadowing and the like.

bzImage has a different mechanism to actually load the kernel. One which
knows that it's split across the 640K & 1M memory region and hence boots.

Recent additions have meant that a kernel larger than 1.2M can stil lbe
booted. There is some real magic in this one. But they kept with the name
and bzImage still boots these.

Cheers,
