&gt; couldn't fix a computer to save their lives. It just proves that learning
&gt; somthing out a book doesn't teach you much at all....

I agree. When I did my MCSE course a few years ago, there were people
doing the course who had not touched a PC other than perhaps using word.
Those same people were MCSEs in no time and still know very little.

It reminds me of the best Dilbert Comic ever. I can't find the actual
picture, but I'll explain it anyway (and hope nothing gets lost in the
translation).


1st frame:
Dilbert is at a server console and a guy steps up behind him and yells
"Step away from that network server! I'm certified!".

2nd frame:
Certified guy is standing where Dilbert was and holds his arms up and
yells "I SUMMON THE VAST POWER OF CERTIFICATION!"

3rd frame:
Certified guy looks disappointed and says "Well, this is embarrassing.
That's all I remember from the classes."

I found it funny.
