Joshua,

where do you this statement from ??

&gt;as opposed to WinICS, which only likes microsoft boxen and is illogical to
setup)

As I said earlier, I have WinICS happily working with RH7.0 (my modem is a
crappy
WinModem with NO Linux Support, it really is crappy anyway!).

I did not find it illogical to setup! I installed it, and said which devices
it was to use,
and that was pretty much it. The biggest trick, was reading the readme.txt
file to find
out why it died on startup and the answer was simple, it acts as a DHCP
server, run the
.reg file mentioned in said readme.txt file and up it came with no problems.

After setting the gateway on the linux box, I was surfing quite happily.

Really easy actually. Did this the first time I tried actually.

It's actually more of a pain to network other Win boxes, you have to boot
with floppy
or some such nonsense to get things working.

Rob.
