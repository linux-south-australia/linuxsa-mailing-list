I have recently bought a new ibook for the sole purpose of running linux and
darwin, iv had no success with linux yet though :(
But in regards to mouse emulation there is info here

1 huge factor in getting the ibook V an X86 one was price i got airport
256mb ram dvd for quite a lot less than equiv X86
and it looks so damn cool! :)

They are, but by the time it's had "Andrew's Enhancements" it's going to
cost me that much.

I agree with you on the competitive nature of their pricing. The last HP
OmniBook 6000 with similar spec to the Powerbook cost us about $6,500.

&gt; Genrally speaking, I think they are better specced for  the money too, if
&gt; you exclude the nefarious CPU speed measure - ie things like networks
&gt; cards, modems, fireware, big screens and DVD are standard, not extras

Wide Screen is ever so cool :-) And slot-loading DVD! That's just
genius!

&gt; I think you can get cheaper PC laptops, even brand name ones, but they
&gt; arent as well specced I suspect.

No, they're not. 

&gt; And they're Ti.

Not to mention the fact that they're so incredibly light. They've packed
in a trillion cool features and kept the weight right down. 2.6cm thick
and 2.4kg heavy :-)

&gt; My thoughts are the days where Mac hardware is clearly more expensive
&gt; than Intel based are over.

I think that generic "Leader PCs" are still better value in a situation
where the bells and whistles aren't required. They're good, though.

&gt; Still for a variety of reasons(easy access to pre compiles binaries,
&gt; greater knowledge available, avaialbility of comeercial software), I think
&gt; Intel is easier for running linux, form a user perspective.

That said, their is Linux for PPC which has a fair amount of coverage on
RPMFind.Net.
