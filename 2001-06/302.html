&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmm.  Do you have a source for this information?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regardless of where Glen got his information, what do you think sounds
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a more plausible version of his statement?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's from testing I did on an old Sun box, now that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think about it almost a decade ago.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The "file manager" approach was a lot less common then,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I take Greg's point about directory traversal.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; You question was where did I think the bottle neck was ? right. Well
&gt;&gt;&gt; the only difference was the software raid 5 calculations so that
&gt;&gt;&gt; must have been the bottle neck.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I consider that unlikely.  They're not nearly as CPU intensive as you
&gt;&gt; would think.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I could see in top that the 'user' load have not increase much but
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'system' load had increased dramatically. This would also indicate
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the load was in the kernel.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Correct.  But you'd need to profile it to find where the real issue
&gt;&gt; was.  Vinum RAID-5 calculations make almost no difference.
&gt;
&gt; Forgive me for pointing out something ambiguous with this whole hardware
&gt; versus software raid argument.
&gt;
&gt; On one hand I am told that software raid is better cause the hardware
&gt; cards have a low spec cpu on them, and spare cycles on the system cpu are
&gt; a much better resource for doing the raid calculations.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, when Mike says that software raid loaded up his box,
&gt; the response is that he must be mistaken, because 'they're not nearly as
&gt; cpu intensive as you would think'
&gt;
&gt; Which is it?

Neither.  It's your misassumption that there can't be a third reason.
Of course, until we have more details, we can't know what the real
problem is.
