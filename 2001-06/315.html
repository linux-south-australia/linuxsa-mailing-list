Alan!

&gt; I think it's difficult for people who live and breathe
&gt; programming to even imagine what it is like to start programming
&gt; from scratch, and maybe this is why you didn't get many
&gt; serious replies.

I have to agree with you there.

&gt; If you really don't want to buy a book, then your principal option
&gt; has to be Perl, because it is fairly comprehensive, and the
&gt; man-manuals are fairly comprehensive.

Actually, I've taken a look at Python and the O'Reilly book and it's
probably a viable option as well. I haven't come across a distribution
that doesn't have Python as a package although I'm not sure whether it
is installed by default.

&gt; But in my experience, after about 2000 lines, Perl programs
&gt; become clumsy and incomprehensible. And they definitely lack
&gt; speed for serious applications.

What version of PERL are you talking about? A badly written [C | PERL |
Python | C++ | LISP] program that is 2000 lines long is still a badly
written program. You can subtitute badly for well in the last sentence.

&gt; Perl is not really a programming language. It's an
&gt; interpreter language. I.e. it's just a script language.

I don't distinguish programming languages by how they are executed.
Java, for example, is widely considered a programming language yet it's
executed in much the same fashion as PERL. That is to say, the Java is
compiled at run time and then run on the host machine.

Java, of course, adds the virtual machine in between the real host
machine and the programming language but that is not really part of this
discussion.

[Side Note:

PERL is compiled and optimised by the Perl Interpreter into an internal,
tokenised representation. The PERL interpreter interprets that
representation. 

]

PERL 5.6.0 displays:

1) Control structures (for, while, if)
2) A method to work with complex structures (through references)
3) Functions/Procedures (called "subs" in PERL)
4) Support for Objects
5) Support for Modularised code

Furthermore it can do all processing without calling a "helper program"
such as "ls", "cat" or "ls". It does (eventually) speak system calls to
the system. I think this qualifies PERL as a programming language; that
it is also an excellent scripting language is true but not, in my
opinion, mutually exclusive.

Also, speed of execution is only one variable amongst many. Try writing:

#! /usr/bin/perl

while(&lt;&gt;) {
	print "Found Him!\n" if m/lloy0076/;
	print "$_\n";
}

With just the C standard libraries. Much more code, more code to go
wrong and you could easily fall into portability dramas.

&gt; Once you learn C, everything else starts to make sense.

LOL. But do pointers ever make sense?

&gt; brain teaser really. I don't know of any really books on
&gt; plain Perl.

What's that? There's so many ways to do one thing in PERL it's mind
boggling. And refreshing too :-)

&gt; Then if you want to go further than this, you can extend C
&gt; by using C++, which permits you to go from 10,000 line programs
&gt; to 500,000 line programs without losing complete track of
&gt; what you're doing,

I thought C++ was emphatically NOT C nor an EXTENSION of C.

&gt; language because it is so extremely reliable and easy.
