To add another suggestion to the possibilities, I have had a few (three or four)
complete freeze-ups over the past year and all of them have been when X has been
running. I even had RH 7.1  freeze after being up with X for a few days.  No
hard evidence to point to, just observations. You don't leave X running on your
server, do you?

My own workhorse, a server/gateway from e-smith  (very cool) based on RH7.0 and
has been up now since last upgrade for 51 days and is a samba files and print
server with DHCP and NFS running.  It also streams MP3's for the kids, so it is
worked a bit.

&gt; This probably isn't your problem, but I once saw a very similar problem.
&gt; The network was on 10mbit co-ax, and it turned out to be a dodgy
&gt; connector. This was really weird because only some protocols were
&gt; effected. You think it'd be all or nothing, but the co-ax must have been
&gt; so on the boundry of failing that the actual data streams made a
&gt; difference!. In the end, one of the T pieces was replaced and all was
&gt; well! Still, I the chances of this scenareo would be one in a million,
&gt; I'd think!

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt;     I am having a very strange problem with a server at the
&gt; &gt; moment. It will boot up and work fine for a period of time
&gt; &gt; (doesn't seem to be long short or any other), and then will
&gt; &gt; just apparently stop working. The server is the connection
&gt; &gt; to the world for a small Windoze 98 network and is running
&gt; &gt; RH 7.0. It is used for normal E-Mail, surfing, and serves
&gt; &gt; the company's WebPages (at present a single, simple were
&gt; &gt; here webpage). It also has a single modem dialin for users
&gt; &gt; to get after hours access.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     The problems is that the server is still running, and
&gt; &gt; still connected to the net through the modem, but for no
&gt; &gt; apparent reason it suddenly will stop serving mail to users,
&gt; &gt; allowing surfers through or outside users to dial in. I have
&gt; &gt; checked the server while on site and it appears to work
&gt; &gt; normally apart from these things. I can ping the network and
&gt; &gt; the outside, but the outside cannot ping the server or
&gt; &gt; retrieve mail or view the webpage. The machines on the
&gt; &gt; network can ping the server but not get through to the
&gt; &gt; dialup router through the server, and they can ping each
&gt; &gt; other.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     I have also checked the logs and there are no unusual
&gt; &gt; entries, except that there are no mail requests or pings or
&gt; &gt; any thing else logged while the machine is not serving
&gt; &gt; properly.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;     Can anyone suggest how I might go about further
&gt; &gt; diagnosing this problem. It clears up if the server is
&gt; &gt; rebooted for another period of time and then goes again. At
&gt; &gt; present this machine is being rebooted almost as often as a
&gt; &gt; Windoze box. There are no obvious things wrong in server
&gt; &gt; config, it is almost a standard "out of the box" install
&gt; &gt; with some security measures added. When the entire system is
&gt; &gt; working, it works perfectly apart from this "hang"
&gt; &gt; situation, until it is rebooted.
&gt; &gt;     Thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt;         Andrew.
