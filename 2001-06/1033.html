&gt; Since I am the guilty party, ok I confess my first post to the group
&gt; was in
&gt; dare I say it HTML. To be honest I was taken aback a little by David
&gt; Llloyd's ferocity of his first paragraph - ouch I guess I must have
&gt; unknowingly stepped on a few wrong toes. I had to read it a few times to
&gt; make sure that I understood the context of what David wrote. But the rest of
&gt; David's email was helpful - thanks.

That's the point. It's evident that you now understand quite clearly the
this list's disapproval of HTML mail. You've had your problem addressed
and you're now posting in plain-text. I'm glad that you didn't get up on
your horse (or whatever the expression means in english) and get all
upset about it.

You're not going to be regarded any less for sending in HTML mail if
you're prepared to send in plain-text once you've been corrected.

&gt; Subsequent emails were sent in plain text format via the tools/options/send
&gt; in the OE menu bar. The only question I have left is do we use the indent
&gt; symbols of &gt; when resending or not?

I think it's better. Some like to use other more obscure indicators, but
I think the '&gt;' looks better and is easer to read. I particularly
dislike tabs, which often make the email hard to read.

&gt; And thanks to Andrew Pullin, good on you mate for stickin up for the
&gt; newbies. I nearly ran away, but I don't scare easy. lol

I think Andrew Pullin got the wrong end of the stick. You weren't being
flamed, just being told in typical David Lloyd fashion. You had your
problem solved, didn't you? I can't see any tangible evidence that would
suggest that David has crossed the line.

&gt; OK here's my two cents on how this Linux group comes across both to newbies
&gt; and the quality and professional attitude that you display between
&gt; yourselves. If you have ever been in a Visual Basic newsgroup, who come
&gt; across as an arrogant bunch and to the other extreme the Delphi programming
&gt; newsgroup who absolutely go way out of their way top help anybody and treat
&gt; newbies with courtesy etc, then Linux falls somewhere in between.

I've not been in a Visual Basic newsgroup and never intend to. I didn't
realise that VB was still considered a language :-)

Linux lists are particularly renound for being a little more fierce than
what's necessary. That said, you do learn how to 'behave' after a little
while. It comes with the OS. The very little ferocity on this list is
not hard to get used to.

&gt; C'mon guys, you're suppose to have something unique. An OS to show the world
&gt; and halt MS domination.

We -do- have something unique. Don't forget that. It's something that
many people in our world have turned a blind eye to. It's not just Linux
either, it's the greater world of OpenSource.
