&gt;When you created the file system, which version did you pass?

I didn't pass any version ...

&gt;I think it creates ver 1 FSs by default, but you need ver 2 to get the large
&gt;file support, etc..

Hmmm, well, I just went back and explicitely created a V 2 reiserfs and I
still have the problem.

I was a bit skeptical that this was the problem, because I would have
expected it to stop at 2GB with that problem. The problem I have is that it
is going all the way to 4GB (2^32-1) and then stopping.

&gt;Also, have you tried later kernel versions? reiser still seems to be getting
&gt;bugs ironed out of it.. the version that came with 2.4.2 had a few bugs, it
&gt;seems, and even 2.4.5 still needs an extra patch for reiser.

I actually have 2.4.5 on the machine, so I will try that next.

&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I was doing some testing of a 53GB reiserfs file system on a machine I am
&gt;&gt; building to see what the performance was like, and I stumbled across a
&gt;&gt; problem.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If I try to create a file larger than 4,294,967,295 bytes (2^32-1), it
&gt;&gt; simply stops at that point and the copy command (cat, dd, whatever) hangs.
&gt;&gt; The system keeps going, just the command you are using hangs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This does not occur with an EXT2 file system, only a ReiserFS on RedHat 7.1
&gt;&gt; with Linux 2.4.2 ...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also tried it with a smaller ReiserFS partition, like 18GB, but the
&gt;&gt; same results.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Has anyone else seen this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Regards
