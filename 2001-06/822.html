Hi...

&gt; &gt; Sorry, I think that's a lot of crap.  ;-)  It is never appropriate to
&gt; &gt; consider Netscape to be the operating system.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are a web kiosk operator (or user), or a website designer looking at
&gt; consumers, then the browser choice is often more important than the
&gt; particular OS, hence, effectively, the browser IS the OS. Technically,

No, it is not.

&gt; that's a load of tripe, but it's just a (slightly) extreme example of where

Yes, it is.

&gt; you can choose to draw lines (Kernel, Kernel+Utils, User Interface, Whole
&gt; Distribution, Application Software, etc)... Practically, this kind of thing
&gt; may happen more as time goes on... Remember that the people calling Netscape
&gt; the OS are the people who wouldn't know a kernel from a shell (indeed, often
&gt; they struggle to tell the mouse from the keyboard), and it's simply
&gt; unrealistic to educate them all, particularly when there is no one clear
&gt; accepted unargued position...

Oh no, a Richard Debate.  ;-)

I understood your point - I just think it's wrong.  What you are
suggesting is that in some cases it's appropriate to consider the
browser to be the operating system.  It's not - that's like
considering the windscreen to be the whole car.  It's just wrong.

And I don't think that any users actually think that their browser is
their operating system - they just don't know the answer to the
question (what OS are you using?) and say the first thing that comes
into their head.  They might as well have said "Knickers...
Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak."

Phil.
