Yeah, I must say that the 'leaky bucket' approach is starting to grow on me.

One nice aspect of it is that (correct if me I'm wrong, Alan), its 
worst case is no less permissive of extra-fee downloading that not 
having it.

I've been thinking about this in the context of my own notion that 
customers dislike getting surprises, including those generated by 
billing algorithms that they can't understand easily. However, 
perhaps the leaky bucket algorithm could be described for the 
'average punter' in simple terms (i.e. never charging more than not 
having this approach engaged, and rewarding customers for usage that 
is allowing 'space' for others to live in, or something similar)

in other words, am I right, Alan, in presuming that (b) above has a 
worst case of no more cost to the customer than (a) (in other words, 
(b) is already the (c) that Dan is suggesting above - confused yet?)
