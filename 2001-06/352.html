&gt; If this were 10MB/s Ethernet, we have 6 hops over Ethernet plus the fiber

I used to run two way links over satellite (twin 2Mbit carriers), with a
350ms round trip time on average. FTPs and other file transfers were full
speed since DEC Alphas have TCP large windows enabled by default.

The latency was VERY noticable when running an X session over the
link, or telnet, or anything that involved back and forth packets
but streaming was fine.

By contrast, the landlines I ran (again, twin 2Mbit carriers) were much
quicker with X and telnet, but were no quicker with the FTPs.

So I don't really see any reason why Ethernet over Fibre would be slow.

Incidentally, a good switch will give 95% of Ethernet's stated speed.
