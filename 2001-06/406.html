&gt; Including how to get their customers to understand what (to them) may

&gt; Again, I'm saying -to them- - not to me or to you - because they're 
&gt; the ones that'll be racing off to the TIO to hit up on what might 
&gt; seem difficult for them to understand.

Both you and Alan have some background in this area, but I have none. I
simply can't assess what would be better.

But if you offered a service where:

   a) I could choose to have a conventional charging scheme, or

   b) I could choose Alan's leaky bucket, with loads of parameters tunable
      by me, but

   c) Amid all the complication there was a guarantee that I cannot
      tune my plan to be worse than XYZ, where XYZ is some basic 
      conventional charging scheme, but

   d) With the exception of (c) above the ISP could specify that the
      charging was never any worse for them than some set of parameters

Then I could tune the account to suit my particular pattens of use without
fearing that I might inadvertently sent myself broke.

This would be one way of acknowledging that not only do customers like me
have no idea how to parameterise what they are looking for but ISPs seem
to be equally uncertain about what they are doing.
