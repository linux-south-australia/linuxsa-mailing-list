Tim,

I agree with you.
Despite the huge amount said on this subject in too many forums,
including a response I got from RMS in about 1995 about this
to an e-mail I sent him on a related subject, I'll say this:

Does RMS think that he lives in a country called England/USA?
After all, the USA takes its language and many of its
institutions and people from England.
And do we live in Britain/Australia?
I don't think so.
I wrote a little essayette on this subject here:
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/linux/lingl.html">http://www.topology.org/linux/lingl.html</A>

In summary, it all comes down to what you define an
operating system to be.

Even back in about 1985, I remember a comp sci lecturer
(in Kentucky) telling me that one of the terms projects for
his students that year was to write a compiler. I think this
might have been second-year uni.
So writing a compiler, even at the time when rms was writing
gcc, was not any more the onerous task it ws 10 years earlier.

I'd propose this as the "correct name" for linux:

Linux/minix/Unix/X/GNU/TeX/Postscript/Perl/C/C++

I seem to remember reading somewhere that the device drivers make up
the majority of the linux kernel, and I don't think that rms would
ever have found intellectual satisfaction in writing device drivers.

Here's what a recent kernel consists of:

==============================================

2335    scripts
2780    vmlinux   
<A HREF="mailto:akenning@dog">akenning@dog</A>&gt; du -s
173069  .
=============================================


If you split up the "include" directory between drivers
and other stuff, it probably brings the total for
drivers up to at least 50%.

I think that the drivers area is where the real hard hack
work goes in.
But certainly writing a portable kernel to the POSIX spec
with support for all the junk that manufacturers put on
their expansion boards is of a totally different order
to writing a compiler and an editor and the basic
system utilities.
Typical linux distributions have been estimated by various
people as being about 3% to 5% GNU code.

I seem to recall that someone once proposed rewriting the 
linux utilities to create a GNU-free linux.

But it doesn't really matter, because it's looking at the
moment as if Microsoft may convince the US government to
declare open source (especially GPL) software illegal anyway...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
