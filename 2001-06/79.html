&gt; A good test, in my opinion, would be to ask someone to understand what
&gt; one of the more complex scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d/  under a sysvinit
&gt; style sytem. You'd get someone more proficient at making questions to
&gt; test for understanding than me to actually test whether the knowledge
&gt; exists.

sounds good to me -- however, when one does this, one must be careful to
allow for people not to know. In fact, I think that being asked to explain
something that the person doesn't know would be a great way to find out
about their potential as a sysadmin...

Assuming they know _something_ about shells and unix (`man` would be good),
asking them "are you familar with init scripts? "no". shell scripts in
general? "no", ok, here's a simple init script, written in sh, can you
attempt to explain to me what it does ... here's a console, with man pages
installed... take your time, experiment, and tell me what you know in 10
minutes time...

I had a similar experience once at a Motorola interveiw. They asked me to
draw my understanding of a simple CPU on the board. I knew a reasonable
amount, but certainly was no expert... Then they asked me to name the bits
and pieces, and tell them what they all do... Then to explain, with my
diagram, how a simple load, add, store would work... Particularly as I
wasn't expert in that field, this showed them that I could talk sensibly
about things I wasn't expert in, could think on my feet, and wasn't afraid
to admit lack of knowledge, but take a chance anyway.

I'd be doing something similar if I was interveiwing...
