HI all,

On the note of buzz words and the like, the term "software engineer" is being used
to hype up the "code monkey", not that there's anything wrong with that!!

Still, such a title sounds "impressive", but i don't think _soft_ ware will ever
be a chick magnet, unless your name is bill :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I havent done any programming before (apart from some basic HTML, and some
&gt; &gt; &gt; basic visual Basic) but i've become interested in programming because i
&gt; &gt; &gt; beleive you wont go very far in the IT industry or earn big bucks if you
&gt; &gt; &gt; dont have any (at all) experience with programming.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; not true -- you cna earn money as a manager type, or a web developer, or a
&gt; &gt; sysadm (although programming helps here, I know people without a lot of
&gt; &gt; programming who earn a lot) or sales, or hardware, or etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you're thinking career-wise, find something you like, and do it well and
&gt; &gt; with commitment. You'll make the money if that's what you want... One
&gt; &gt; interesting thing to note is that the money you make is less dependant on
&gt; &gt; your technical knowledge than on your other skills -- people, time
&gt; &gt; management, attitude, etc... Of course, if you are technically brilliant,
&gt; &gt; you'll probably be worth a fair bit, but it's not the only way to make money
&gt; &gt; in IT (and it isn't the only way to be of value, either -- making money and
&gt; &gt; being of value are linked, but not the same...)
&gt;
&gt; [Note: when I say "you" in this item, I mostly mean people in general.]
&gt;
&gt; Very well put. But you could go further.
&gt; I've found that software developers are held in very low regard
&gt; in the IT industry, hence such terms as "hacker", "code monkey",
&gt; and other negative terms.
&gt; There are very few star programmers who are held in high regard.
&gt; But like rock stars, these few programming stars draw people
&gt; into the industry, only to find that they are always at the
&gt; bottom of the organisational tree.
&gt;
&gt; A good rule is to look at the job title.
&gt; If you can work out what someone's job title means, then they
&gt; are probably at the bottom of the tree.
&gt; What one needs to do is to get the most obscure description
&gt; possible, like system analyst, systems engineer, network engineer,
&gt; network architect, network consultant.
&gt; If you are called "programmer" or "software developer", you need
&gt; to stop writing code and get a different title if you want
&gt; to get further up the tree.
&gt;
&gt; The only reason you would learn good coding is for personal
&gt; satisfaction, and so that you know what the "coders" are doing
&gt; and telling you.
&gt; Coders usually are packed 2-3 per office and do not get
&gt; business cards - what would they use them for?
&gt; The people with inscrutible job titles get their own
&gt; office with plush chairs and a nice business card - and
&gt; a bigger salary, and several people "underneath them".
&gt;
&gt; One step up from a coder is to be a developer using
&gt; "authoring tools", which were designed so that illiterate
&gt; people can create code. These tools cost an amount of money
&gt; to indicate the importance of the person doing the work.
&gt; When you boss buys you some "authoring tools", you know
&gt; you're on the way up. When you're asked to give up all coding
&gt; and leave it to "the code monkeys", you know you're in the
&gt; money. Then you get your own office, a nice comfortable
&gt; leather arm-chair, a meaningless job title, a pay rise,
&gt; and your "job" turns into a "career". You also get to do
&gt; more travel, and you get invited to important meetings.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore learn coding if you wish, get into a job or two,
&gt; and work out how to stop coding as soon as possible,
&gt; if you want to get yourself a nice car and house.
&gt;
&gt; Someone explained to me that the reason the high school graduates
&gt; in the sales department make twice as much as the uni graduates
&gt; hacking out code is that the sales people make money, and
&gt; programmers are a dime a dozen.
&gt; Sales is where the money is!!
&gt; The more people you deal with outside your organisation, the
&gt; more important and indispensable you are judged to be.
&gt;
&gt; A conclusion from all of this is that linux, being a prime
&gt; software development environment, is _not_ the best route to
&gt; riches and a comfortable life.
&gt;
&gt; Learning how to code is a prerequisite for understanding
&gt; the IT industry, as learning to count is essential for life,
&gt; but just as arithmetic is done by calculators in practice,
&gt; so coding is almost always done by the developers
&gt; of off-the-shelf products. No organisation in their right mind
&gt; does their own coding. 99.999% of all software has already
&gt; been done by someone else and is available on a CD-ROM for
&gt; 1% of the cost that you can create it yourself.
&gt;
&gt; -------------------------------------------------
&gt; Now getting a little less contentious, C++ is indeed an
&gt; extension of C, although a little bit rough in a few
&gt; minor points.
&gt; If your header files are correctly ported to C++, as most
&gt; linux header files are, then you should be able to
&gt; compile C programs with a C++ compiler without change.
&gt; I'd call that an "extension"!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
