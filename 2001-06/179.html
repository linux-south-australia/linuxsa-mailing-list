&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I would not use software raid, because Linux just does not have enough
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tools, there is not an easy way to remove hard drives and add new ones in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is not slow compared to good hardware, but it does load the CPU
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; unacceptable and this IS true because I had done extensive testing. If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; want the machine doing the software raid to do real work, forget about it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It would be good to get some objective measurements on this. We're running
&gt;&gt;&gt; software RAID on a number of Linux systems without performance
&gt;&gt;&gt; problems. What measurements would make sense? I imagine the following:
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;   - an indication of raw hardware speed
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This is very misleading.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;   - performance doing some large copy and write ops
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The real issue here is that large copy and write ops are not typical
&gt;&gt; usage of a file system, especially if you're doing only a single
&gt;&gt; thread.  You end up with something approaching sequential transfers,
&gt;&gt; which on modern IDE disks can be up to 35 MB/s.  In real life, you'll
&gt;&gt; probably not see more than a tenth of this value.
&gt;
&gt; Well, horses for courses, and all that.. It depends very much on
&gt; what you're doing. People should determine what usage patterns they
&gt; have, and then build a system around their needs. RAID exists for
&gt; both performance increases (eg.  striping), or preventing downtime
&gt; due to hdd failure (eg. mirroring or parity), or both (eg striping
&gt; with parity), and so on..

You're probably missing the point.  Almost the only time people do
single sequential transfers is when measuring "performance".  The only
real-life applications I know are for journalling and for streaming
video.  Even they frequently performs multiple accesses for different
applications.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you're using IDE drives have you used hdparm? The speedup factor
&gt;&gt;&gt; can be huge.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't really understand the use of hdparm.  I played with it a few
&gt;&gt; months back when testing a Linux box, but it seems to me that the
&gt;&gt; drivers should DTRT without it.  In particular, you should be running
&gt;&gt; in the fastest possible DMA mode by default.
&gt;
&gt; umm... biggest difference is enabling DMA - you really, really, want this
&gt; enabled. It usually is, in the more recent distros.. there's an auto
&gt; optimise option you can pass to the kernel frmo your boot manager, or set on
&gt; by default in the kernel.. but turning on 32bit transfers is a good move
&gt; too.

Isn't that implicit in UDMA?  I suspect that a lot of the "individual"
knobs on hdparm are really constrained to work together by the
hardware.

&gt; Turning the block reads up to the maximum is a good move, since the
&gt; harddrive has to read that much anyway, really.. may as well get it
&gt; into the disk cache at the same time.

Not necessarily.  If you have a random access pattern, you're just
tying up disk I/O bandwidth and memory for stuff you'll never need.
