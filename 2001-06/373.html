Hi Alan,

Just tryed a manual load from Cust data, not sure how long that is going to
take.

Just out of interest when I restart Bind 9 I get the following in the log

Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5801]: starting BIND 9.1.0 -u named
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5801]: using 1 CPU
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named: named startup succeeded
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: loading configuration from '/etc/named.conf'
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: the default for the 'auth-nxdomain' option
is now 'no'
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: no IPv6 interfaces found
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: listening on IPv4 interface lo, 127.0.0.1#53
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: listening on IPv4 interface eth0,
x.x.x.x1#53
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: listening on IPv4 interface ppp0, x.x.x.x#53
Jun  9 17:17:03 fs named[5803]: running

But when I restart bind 8 on my own box I get messages about the secondary
being notified and then a transfer so I know it is all working.

Is this normal for Bind 9 or should I be seeing some more messages.

I also would like to try a manual transfer except they have taken the
transfer program away. Is there another way of doing a manual transfer?

Steve

&gt; &gt; I am trying to get Bind 9 on RH7.1 to transfer a primary zone to a
secondary
&gt; &gt; on BPD,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The log tells me that there are no errors but it doesn't even appear to
try
&gt; &gt; and do a transfer,
&gt; &gt; I have tryed adding options like notify and also-notify in the
named.conf
&gt; &gt; file but still no go.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Steve,
&gt;
&gt; Have you tried tracing packets on port 53?
&gt;
&gt; I did this and found that the BigPond secondary has been ignoring
&gt; all notify messages for many months now - maybe years.
&gt; They told me they just ignore the notify messages.
&gt; I was also told that they update of their own accord on a regular
&gt; basis.
&gt; Well, that doesn't fit the facts either.
&gt; I have about 16 domains, and they just seem to
&gt; miss out on some of these altogether, and the others are patchy
&gt; adn less frequent than they should be.
&gt;
&gt; In a check over 12 days in April, various domains names were
&gt; queried by the BPD secondary machine this often:
&gt;
&gt;  2
&gt; 12
&gt; 11
&gt;  6
&gt;  7
&gt;  5
&gt;  6
&gt;  5
&gt;  5
&gt;  6
&gt;  6
&gt;  6
&gt;  0     &lt;- not checked at all! (topology.org)
&gt;  5
&gt;  8
&gt;  2
&gt;  9
&gt;
&gt; When I contacted them, I was told that if it doesn't work,
&gt; you have to update manually.
&gt;
&gt; In the "custdata" pages:
&gt; <A HREF="http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/manage.htm">http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/manage.htm</A>
&gt; there's a page somewhere to initiate an update query
&gt; by the secondary from your primary.
&gt; That seems to work most of the time.
&gt;
&gt; All in all, it is not satistfactory!
&gt; I woudln't bet your business on it.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt; PS. This seems to have nothing to do with the BIND version number.
