Why not send the (100-R)% ? If the author's not sending you a receipt, he's probably not claiming the income. 

You feel good and The author gets to buy another jar of coffee. 

cheers,

Brett

Subject: tax deductions for non-compulsary software payments


&gt; This is a question about a method of doing
&gt; open software business. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an example.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone writes some really neat software.
&gt; I use the software and feel grateful and want to
&gt; help fund the continued development of that software.
&gt; I voluntarily send X dollars to the author.
&gt; At the end of the year I think about how much
&gt; I've paid for software in the year, for the purposes
&gt; of tax deductions.
&gt; But... there's no invoice or receipt for the X dollars.
&gt; Pretty clearly, I can't claim a deduction.
&gt; So at a marginal tax rate of R%, I have really paid
&gt; the equivalent of X/((100-R)%) for the software payment.
&gt; If the author had put a price on the software, I would
&gt; have received a tax deduction of X * R%.
&gt; So the author has actually done me a bad turn by making
&gt; the software free!
&gt; 
&gt; Question 1:
&gt; Looking at it from the point of view of the software
&gt; user, how can I get a tax deduction without hassling
&gt; the author too much?
&gt; 
&gt; Question 2:
&gt; If I were an author, how could I make software free,
&gt; and yet also put a price on it so that people could
&gt; send me "donations" and get their tax deduction?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems to me that the way tax deductions are worked out
&gt; is on the assumption of _compulsary_ payment.
&gt; If I should ever be audited, how could explain that
&gt; the payment was optional? That would mean that I was paying
&gt; more than the market price for the item, which was 0 dollars.
&gt; If the payment is optional, then the payment could be
&gt; seen as a gift, especially if the amount of the payment is
&gt; at the whim of the payer.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone claimed a tax deduction on a gift to, say,
&gt; the Free Software Foundation?
&gt; I once wanted to send them some money, but their web pages are
&gt; so horribly organised, I just gave up after about 1 hour of
&gt; trying to understand how to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; Most software authors would not be registered charities, I assume.
&gt; 
&gt; The issue must arise in the case of shareware, which first appeared
&gt; on the scene around about 1985, I think.
&gt; 
&gt; The kinds of things I'd like to know are:
&gt; 
&gt; Should the payer send the number X to the author, and the author
&gt; sends an invoice for X dollars, and the payer sends off X dollars?
&gt; 
&gt; Or should the payer send X dollars, and the author sends receipt
&gt; (and possibly an invoice) for X dollars?
&gt; 
&gt; It's difficult to see how to do this without hassle to the author.
&gt; 
&gt; If there was a standard modus operandi for these things, I think
&gt; that it would help the open source movement along a bit.
&gt; That's my opinion anyway....
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
