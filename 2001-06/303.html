Thanks Dan

I guess I could do the same thing for some of the Telnet cleints that handle
printing as well then I only have to worry about one client app on the client
Windows box.

&gt; &gt; Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if it is possible to send an encryted print job via
&gt; LPD to
&gt; &gt; a Win32 box.
&gt;
&gt; This is in a general class of problem that says: "how do I get protocol
&gt; X
&gt; encrypted if I'm using a Windows box at one or even both ends of a
&gt; connection and the Windows software has, of course, no clue about
&gt; encyption?"
&gt;
&gt; The answer is much the same as it is on Unix, where you wrap the
&gt; protocol
&gt; with ssh. Go to <A HREF="http://www.openssh.org/windows.html">http://www.openssh.org/windows.html</A> and pick a Windows
&gt; client you like and which does port forwarding (the -L switch, under
&gt; openssh and copycat implementations.) Not Windows versions do
&gt; forwarding.
&gt;
&gt; The setup is as simple as this:
&gt;
&gt;    Run sshd on the Unix box
&gt;
&gt;    Run ssh with -L (or equivalent switch, depending which implementation
&gt;    you choose) on the Windows box, redirecting the
&gt;    [lpr/imap/pop/smtp/whatever] port to a remote server
&gt;
&gt;    Run your application, pointing it at the forwarded local port. In
&gt; your
&gt;    case, tell the lpr client software that the lpd daemon is on the
&gt; local
&gt;    computer (because it is!)
&gt;
&gt; This seems like black magic, but it is very simple. If I were to do this
&gt; for telnet (for instance) on a Windows computer, I could open up Windows
&gt; terminal and connect to localhost port 23, and I would see a login
&gt; prompt
&gt; for the remote Unix machine. And the entire connection would be secure,
&gt; even though telnet does plain text passwords and other insecure things.
&gt;
&gt; You get a bonus as well in a lot of cases from the fact that ssh does
&gt; compression too.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From man ssh:
&gt;
&gt;  -L port:host:hostport
&gt;              Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is
&gt; to be
&gt;              forwarded to the given host and port on the remote  side.
&gt; This
&gt;              works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local
&gt; side,
&gt;              and whenever a connection is made to this port, the
&gt; connection is
&gt;              forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made
&gt; to
&gt;              host port hostport from the remote machine.  Port
&gt; forwardings can
&gt;              also be specified in the configuration file.  Only root can
&gt; for­
&gt;              ward privileged ports.  IPv6 addresses can be specified
&gt; with an
&gt;              alternative syntax: port/host/hostport
&gt;
&gt; Read the "Secure POP via SSH mini-HOWTO" at linux.senet.com.au,
&gt; replacing
&gt; all occurances of "110" (the POP port) with the result of
&gt; "grep print /etc/services". This is a technique that works with most
&gt; protocols.
