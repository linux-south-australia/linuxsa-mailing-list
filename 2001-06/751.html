Laptops, being usually LCD, have different ways of dealing with
resolutions that are smaller than 1:1 screen pixel size. Some just use
the pixels they get fed (like what you discribe) and leave the others
blank and others try to stretch the picture to fit the screen which
results in an ugly picture due to doubling some scan lines which makes
strange parts of letters look blocky. Often there is a bios option to
toggle between the two. I guess you have a couple of options:

1) ignore it, and take it that it'll look blockyer/dodgyer if you 'fix'
it
2) find the bios option and get it to strech and accept the blockyness
3) use a framebuffer text mode on boot so that your screen is in the
best res for the LCD

I can't off the top of my head explain how to set up #3 but Im sure
someone can (some distros have easily setable options eg mandrake 8).

Incidentally, I have noticed on LCD screens often lower refresh rates
look clearer (have stopped some people complaining about blury lap top
screens buy setting them back to 60hz, and my projector at home is rated
to 85hz but looks best at 60hz too).

Hope this helps,
Ant

&gt; I have installed RH7.1 on a compaq armada E500. (15" screen) all went
&gt; well except that in CL mode the screen is locked into a small box about
&gt; 150mm x 100mmlocated in the centre of the screen.
&gt; 
&gt; So during boot it's tiny, if I boot to init3 its tiny, but in X its fine
&gt; it uses the whole screen.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked the X11/XF86config file but did not see anything unusual.  My
&gt; laptop experience is limited so any ideas or suggestion is welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA
