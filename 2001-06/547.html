&gt; i installed linux red hat 7.1 alongside win ME so
&gt; that i could have a dual boot system but all i could 
&gt; get to work was linux and not win ME.

Troy,

A few issues to consider here:

 - Windows is selfish, and wants an entire hard disk for itself. And it 
won't play nicely with non-MS operating systems unless it's beaten into 
submission first. Don't accept its defaults blindly. In particular, it 
will replace any pre-existing boot sector with its own; so if this is a 
bare-disk install then install Windows first.

 - I've not actually installed WinME on a bare disk yet, but if it's like 
its predecessors it will run FDISK very early in the install. One of the 
questions FDISK will ask you reads something like "do you want to use the 
entire hard disk for your primary partition?". Just say NO, then it 
should ask you for the size you really want.

An alternative is to let it run FDISK as usual, then cancel the install 
and use a partition resizing program to shrink the Win partition. Then 
start the Windows install again. This time it should detect there's a 
partition already prepared for its use; and not gobble the entire disk.

 - Practically all the recent Linuxes will check for the "installation 
onto a single hard disk that already contains Windows" scenario. Leaving 
the Win partition(s) alone, and then installing Linux into the free 
space. In this scenario they also install lilo (or grub) to offer a 
dual-boot capability.

 - I've got a vague recollection that the WinME filesystem includes a few 
extra tweaks over the FAT32 used by its predecessors. Some of these were 
enough to break disk utilities that worked fine with Win 95/98/NT; and 
they may upset Linux too if you're trying to mount your Win partitions 
later on.

If the WinME install offers an option to use the Win 9x FAT32, then 
select it. Try to avoid using "enhanced filesystem" or whatever the WinME 
install may call it.

 - If you have a second hard drive its use is highly recommended. Let 
WinME install onto the first drive, then install Linux onto the second. 
Linux installs will check for this scenario too.


cheers,
Fraser Farrell
