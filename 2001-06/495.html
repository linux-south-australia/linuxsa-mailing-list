&gt;   &gt;&gt; 
&gt;   &gt;&gt; My Xircom Eth/Modem autodetects under RH7.1, I guess it should under 
Debian in 
&gt;   &gt;&gt; about a year :-)
&gt; 
&gt;   DS&gt; I think this is exactly the point. The Debian installer is not very 
good
&gt;   DS&gt; at all compared to Red Hat and others.
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I think you make some very good points, Dan.
&gt; 
&gt; But, (to be pedantic) I'm not sure it was the point at all...  Wasn't
&gt; Andrew Reid talking about his BSD system when michaeld turned it into
&gt; a RH/Debian comparison?  (It's a bit hard to tell, since michaeld's
&gt; mailer does not seem to support news-group threads.)

The point was that I was commenting on his Xircom problems, not on the rest of 
his email.  I'm not interested in debating RH/Debian too heavily - both have 
their uses and target audiences.  I was just simply saying that RH7.1 out of 
the box solves his problem and that debian will eventually get there.

As for my mailers ability to handle threads, what else can you expect from a 
web mailer which is all I have access to during daylight hours.  If I wait 
until I get home, find that "round tuit" and use my well-behaved MUA you won't 
see replies for at least a week :-)
 
&gt; For linux PCMCIA information, check out the page at sourceforge: 
&gt;   <A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/SUPPORTED.CARDS">http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/SUPPORTED.CARDS</A>
&gt; (For example, it says there that the Xircom CEM II Ethernet/Modem is
&gt; NOT supported.) 

Earlier versions are supported though.  There have been no models mentioned in 
this thread.
