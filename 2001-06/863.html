&gt; a security issue, ie two passwords on one account, two
&gt; possible combinations to crack. If you believe how "easy" it

&gt; seems to me that you half the time it takes to crack the

I haven't been following this thread much.
But with remote ssh logins, of course, you can
have as many "passwords" as you like.
You just stick them all in the authorized keys file.

If you're doing things locally on terminals or monitors
(a bit old fashioned), then you could have multiple accounts with
one console password each, but which each start up in a
shell which makes an ssh login (with or without pass-phrase challenge)
directly to the single account that you want to be accessible with
multiple passwords.

So user 1 logs in as user "u1", gives password "p1",
and the loging activates an "ssh" command through to the
main account "u".

Working remotely, you just get each user to send you a
public key that they have the private key to.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
