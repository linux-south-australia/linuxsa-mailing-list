If you're really bothered, change your ethernet address to a different
random value at regular intervals.

#!/usr/bin/perl

  [do some stuff to generate $addr]

`ifconfig $iface hw ether $addr`;

But in any case ethernet address is lost once you're off the local subnet,
even if it is ethernet all the way (unless there are multiple subnets on
one wire, which while rare, is possible.) But there are some ways to track
it down, some of which follow. None of them sound very likely in your
case.

Running MS Word and sending out Word documents is a good way to broadcast
your ethernet address, with unpatched Word97.

Registering Windows with the Registration Wizard did a good job of sending
your ethernet address to Microsoft, too.

I think some browsers can report your MAC address, but no browsers on
Linux that I know of :-) I seem to recall that IE was caught at it with
some combination of ActiveX controls loaded.

If you ever posted to a list anywhere about your ethernet driver then half
of the 48-bit ethernet address is either given or trivially guessable,
leaving at most 16777215 possibilities that could be guessed over time, if
you didn't notice the traffic (which you wouldn't, on a 100/1000 LAN). But
it seems a little unlikely.

Then there is the Alcatel modem. Maybe there is yet another bug lurking in
it that unexpectly breaks security policies.
