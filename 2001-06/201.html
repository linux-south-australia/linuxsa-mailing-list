Huh?  When these customers signed up, they would have been presented with
a contract which permitted their provider to change the terms without
notice.  Far from being given the opportunity to "opt-out", they've already
"opted-in".

If you don't like the terms and conditions your service is provided under,
surely that's a good reason to shop around for other providers?  It is
a legally enforcible contract, you know?

 &gt; I got a stack load of emails from friends
 &gt; saying they were going to the TIO and their fathers were gonna talk to
 &gt; their lawyers, it appears they have all signed up recently for 18 month
 &gt; contracts and now feel constrained by the NEW conditions.

&lt;shrug&gt;  They should have read the fine print.  It was common knowledge
that "unlimited" conditions weren't going to last, so anyone who 
signs a long-term contract which permits the provider to unilaterally 
change the terms and conditions without affecting the contract term
deserves what they get.
