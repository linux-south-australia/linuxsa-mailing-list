Hi There,
    I was serious, but I wasn't targeting anybody specific.
I have been reading this list long enough to know that you
can and do go on quite passionately about certain topics.
However, I still believe that If I was an absolute newbie
who hadn't posted to this list before and received a reply
to my innocent request for help that could be seen by some
as a personal attack, over a crime I didn't even know I had
committed, I would certainly have second thoughts about
posting again. If I received an answer to my question and a
polite reminder that I had sinned, then I would be much more
likely to fix the error of my ways and continue to become a
member of the community, and encourage others to do so.
Please remember that a newbie probably hasn't been on the
list long enough to know your posting habits or likely
responses.

    Finally, you point out that previously the people
running this list offered to fix the HTML problem, but were
not concerned enough about it themselves to do it. Since
then nobody else has offered to help either. I would suggest
that this implies that it isn't that big an issue for those
others subscribed to the list because they cannot be
bothered to fix the problem. If this is the case, then why
are people still complaining about it. If you are too lazy
to fix something that annoys you, then you are obviously not
annoyed by it that much. As far as I know, this list runs on
an open source list server software (major-domo I think),
the point I tried to make was that if someone doesn't like
HTML mail that much, then modify the software to fix it (ie
scratch that "I don't like HTML mail and the list software
doesn't filter it" itch).
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; Now, down to the personal. I have a tendency to speak in
hyperbole and
&gt; most everyone on this list probably realises that.
Furthermore, if you
&gt; are incapable of understanding that I do actually make
some valid and on
&gt; topic points and statements as well as the SUPPOSED flame
then I am
&gt; willing to translate anything I write into German, French
or Italian and
&gt; send them to you in about 24 hours (yes, I can understand
all three but
&gt; it takes me longer to actually speak or write them). This
would be in
&gt; the off chance that you would read ALL of the e-mail.
