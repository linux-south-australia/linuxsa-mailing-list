Tux is an accomplishment, but the article is hopeless.

Benchmarking is about capacity planning, not dick size.  So
tps numbers are essentially meaningless to all but marketdroids.

The question benchmarking has to answer is something like "given
2Mbps into my web server how small a PC can I use and what else
can I run on it".  Rephasing that
 - for a given transaction rate
    - how much of constraining system resources (CPU, disk,
      system calls, virtual memory) are used?
    - how fair to competing processes is this use?

It's quite possible that Tux uses few system resources, but is
unfair.  This might be something like "you can service 2Mbps from
a 486 with 32MB but better not run anything else on the machine
no matter how big the CPU".  Now that would be valuable benchmarking
information.

Some further points:

 1.  Tux is difficult to deploy right now as it is essentially
     released only for benchmark tests.  I'm surpised that a
     quality magazine wouldn't warn its readers about the
     availability, otherwise it's readers may make incorrect
     capacity planning decisions.

 2.  In previous tests, some of TuX's performance comes from
     dubious network settings that would be inadvisable to use
     on a real web site, for example, disabling SYN flood protection
     and not using iptables.  Again this misleads people
     making capacity planning decisions.

 3.  Tux only serves static content, so the 'Apache versus
     Tux' tone of the review misses the point.  Real web
     sites have a mix of static and dymanically-generated
     content.

Also interesting would be to test Tux's stability.  The
downside of a kernel-space web server is that when it breaks
the entire machine dies.  Running a regression test of the
user input that has broken Apache and IIS in the past
would have been a good start.
