&gt; I guess the question is, would you want to?  ReiserFS' advantage is when
&gt; you do lots of writing and changes to files/directories on a file system,
&gt; something that happens pretty infrequently on a boot partition.  Of
&gt; course, that's presuming that you have/use a separate boot partition
&gt; (I do, whether I need to or not, because I usually winding up with the
&gt; need ...).

Sorry for the lack of clarity. What I was wondering was whether I could have 
a system with just / and /home, or perhaps /, /usr and /home, and have them 
as reiserfs - or whether I would need a ext2 /boot partition for this to 
work...

Well, in answer, I created a single reiserfs / and installed mdk8.0, but even 
when I boot this from lilo on another mdk install I get a kernel panic and it 
can't find the drive, So I'm guessing I would need a kernel with reiserfs 
builtt in... But even then I have a feeling I will need a ext2 /boot or have 
the kernel on another linux install as I have now. Or does lilo handle reiser 
okay... Not sure on that one.

So at this stage I'm thinking of just putting /home on reiserfs as I had 
before, then later putting /usr and some other stuff on reiserfs... But first 
I need a heap of backing up and cleaning up to do... I have 28gig in drives 
and I'm out of space, which is kind of ridiculous... Much is duplications and 
just plain crap.  

Oh, well there is some space on the win game drives, but I rarely boot win... 
Linux is getting more games all the time and the kids love bzflag :-)

thanks,

tim
