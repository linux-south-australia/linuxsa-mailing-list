"
Microsoft: We messed up

By Robert Lemos
ZDNet News
June 13, 2001


System administrators who rely on Microsoft's Exchange e-mail server 
software are hoping the third time's a charm for the software giant.

Microsoft contritely acknowledged Wednesday that its second attempt to fix 
an Exchange security hole went awry. Rather than fix the problem--and the 
security hole--the company's second attempt at a software patch included a 
catastrophic bug that caused many servers to hang....
"



The article mentions the timing of this incident is "tough" as Microsoft 
tries to hold onto its share of the server market, "partly by attacking 
Linux and other open-source software competitors."

Other quotables include:

- "Microsoft has been getting paid for software for a long time, and it's 
not that much better," said Gartner analyst John Pescatore.

- Portuguese security consultant Joao Gouveia likened the effect of the 
patch to a denial-of-service attack that overwhelms a Web server by 
flooding it with page requests. "If you install the patch, you can cause a 
self denial-of-service on the system," said Gouveia.

- Gartner's Pescatore said incidents like the Exchange fumble are not that 
rare.  "If you look through the mailing lists and the bug lists, you'll see 
that one time out of five, a new patch is replacing an older one that 
didn't work right," he said.

and the punch-line:

- "This will not happen again," said a Microsoft spokesperson. "Period."
