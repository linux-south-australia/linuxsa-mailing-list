I checked with Mail.com as I too have an iName account and the problem is
not that they only store it, its that it takes a long time to send through.

I send a test and it took about 4 hours to get back to me, so worry not that
your mail is lost.. its just a little slow

also of interest, this is a part of the automated response to support
requests which has some details of the problem;

&gt; You should receive a response within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime,
&gt; below you will find information that may answer your questions before
&gt; then.

&gt; Where are your messages and Address Book entries?

&gt; If your e-mail or Address Book entries appear to be missing, it is only
&gt; a temporary situation. None of your information has been lost.
&gt; Although there may be a delay in transferring all of your information to
&gt; the new system, it should be restored to your account within a few days.
&gt; If you do find that your messages or Address Book entries are missing
&gt; for more than a few days, you may contact Member Services at
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:migration@staff.mail.com.">migration@staff.mail.com.</A> Please include the case number listed above
&gt; in the subject line of your e-mail.

&gt; Why doesn't your password work?

&gt; We have not changed your password, however, on the new system, passwords
&gt; are case sensitive, which means aBc is NOT the same as abc. Please be
&gt; sure you are entering your password exactly as you typed in when you
&gt; signed up for your account.

&gt; Why is the service so slow?

&gt; In an effort to bring you a higher level of e-mail and other services,
&gt; we are upgrading all e-mail accounts to an entirely new system.
&gt; Unfortunately, this process is very slow, as we need to move all e-mail
&gt; messages and Address Book entries for all members. We appreciate your
&gt; patience while we complete this process.

&gt; Why are we upgrading our systems?

&gt; While the existing e-mail service was more than adequate for our
&gt; existing members, we decided to upgrade to a new system in order to be
&gt; able to grow our user base while providing our existing members with the
&gt; same level of service they have come to expect from Mail.com.
&gt; Additionally, when we are on the new system, we will be able to begin
offering &gt; &gt; you additional
&gt; services never before offered as part of your e-mail account. We are
&gt; very confident that you will enjoy these services in the near future.

&gt; Why is there a delay in receiving new messages?

&gt; This is a symptom of the heavy traffic going through our mail systems
&gt; while we upgrade all accounts to the new version. This is a temporary
&gt; problem and will be resolved as soon as possible. It is a top priority.

hope this eases your mind...

&gt; Damn! I've been using them since the days of iname (my address is still
&gt; @iname.com) and havnt _noticed_ any probs. I hope my mail isn't being
&gt; stored! Anyway, Excluding this (if I am affected) I havnt had any probs.
&gt; The only thing to watch out for is they have spammed me, but I looked at
&gt; the headers and busted them. I dont know if they still spam other
&gt; people, but at least they leave me alone now. The forwarding is good.
&gt; It'll let me change isps one day without chainging my email. (providing
&gt; they stay in busness, and keep working - I hope this isnt an impossible
&gt; ask!)

&gt; &gt; OK, I just need to whinge:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I use mail.com as a mail forwarding service. It blows. For at least a
week
&gt; &gt; now, it's been eating my mail. There are no notifications sent back to
&gt; &gt; senders, and I see no sign of any mail. They tell me that they are aware
of
&gt; &gt; problems (their front page has a link to an explanation of sorts), and
that
&gt; &gt; no-one's mail is actually being lost, it's all being stored. Has anyone
else
&gt; &gt; had this problem? What on earth can I do about it? I'm in the process of
&gt; &gt; setting up my mail server, but that is taking some time, and besides,
people
&gt; &gt; who send mail to my old address will think I'm ignoring them. At least
they
&gt; &gt; could reject the mail!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, to anyone out there who needs to send me mail, please use either
my
&gt; &gt; present home address (<A HREF="mailto:richardrussell@internode.on.net">richardrussell@internode.on.net</A>) or my work
address
