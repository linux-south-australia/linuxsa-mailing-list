Heh.  Or other more subtle ones.

I watched sysadmins on a UNIX box puzzle themselves for months over
why non-root users couldn't login to the system -- Attempts always
yielded complaints about the inaccessibility of the users' home directories,
immediately followed by a "No such file or directory" error on locating
their shell.  But their home directories were clearly there, and their
shells were also present, and perfectly executable:  You could login as
root and see for yourself.

As it happens, the problem turned out to be suprisingly simple:  The
permissions on / were drw-r--r--.  Someone had been a bit over-aggressive
with a recursive chmod at some stage in the past, and not noticed (because
they were root, so it didn't affect them)!

Not that I think this has anything to do with Alan's problem;  It's just
a funny story from way-back-when... :-)
