Richard,

&gt; not nipicking, just wondering -- what is the accepted australian spelling
&gt; for program? I would say "program", but I have seen a number of instances 
of
&gt; "programme" recently... is one UK, one US?

Programme is the original English spelling, and the one that was taught 
to my generation before the American cultural steamroller really got 
going here.

Program is the usual American spelling; unfortunately proliferated here 
by the default installation of US English for spellcheckers. Older 
readers may recall a well-known south coast town used to be spelled 
"Victor Harbour", until someone in the Dept of Lands carelessly pressed 
spellcheck in their shiny new wordprocessor, and the "corrected" spelling 
got into the Government Gazette. Thereby becoming the new legal name of 
that town.

I now use "program" specifically to mean "instructions for a computer". I 
use "programme" to mean "a schedule or planned sequence of events". 
Similarly there's "disk" – the storage things we stick into computers – 
and "disc", which is generic for a circular object.

Of course my children regard this and similar examples of multiple 
spellings as a bit wierd and pointless. Perhaps they're right.



cheers,
Fraser Farrell
