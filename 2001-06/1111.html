&gt; If your phone number is in the following ranges, you might be
&gt; surprised:
&gt;
&gt; PROSPECT        08 82691000-82697999
&gt; PROSPECT        08 83420000-83426999
&gt; PROSPECT        08 83429000-83429999
&gt; PROSPECT        08 83441000-83449999

Yep, we're in the range..

&gt;
&gt; If that says you can get ADSL, you can actually get it through any
&gt; provider, not just Telstra.
&gt;
&gt; So use a different provider.  Be aware that in almost every conceivable
&gt; aspect of telecommunications, Telstra probably have the worst deal on the
&gt; market.  ADSL is absolutely no exception.

I was under the impression that only telstra have DSLAMs in the exchanges,
and they just rent ports out to other people. So if we can't get it with
Telstra because the exchange is full (and they're not upgrading it), then we
can't get it with *anyone* ?


&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Does anyone think this is unfair as well?
&gt;  &gt; Does anyone have the TIO/ACCC's email addy handy, because I'd like to post
&gt;  &gt; this off to them as well.
&gt;
&gt; You won't get anywhere with that.  Telstra are required to offer services
&gt; on terms which are consistent with their terms and conditions, not on terms
&gt; which people who aren't even their customers think are "fair".  They can
&gt; make their terms and conditions as draconian as they like, and as long as
&gt; they stick to them religiously the TIO won't give a damn.
&gt;

Yeah, I know ;(

Apparently the 3 gb cap is total transfers - ie. upload + download.

So, 1 Gb per person, and then minus a chunk due to uploads and general
backtraffic. Bloody hell. What next, a 0 byte cap? You just pay for the
priveledge of giving Telstra money.


*grumble*
