&gt; &gt; Dan, you could write the software and offer it to ISPs to do exactly what

&gt; 
&gt; And you could do a great deal more than this too.
&gt; 
&gt; But something else occurs to me: cost isn't always the issue, although
&gt; attemps are made to make everything have a cost. Bandwidth is finite and
&gt; no user or supplier ever wants to see it all used up. So quite aside from
&gt; charging for usage, what incentives can be built in that encourage frugal
&gt; use of this resource? 

Dan,

That then brings you to the next level - token bucket arrays.
But I won't foist the details on this list here.
I did that recently here:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2001-06/196.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/2001-06/196.html</A>

In short, the way you get incentives to be frugal is to
run down the user's credit (and decrease their priority) when
they use too much. E.g. the ISP says "you get 100 kbits/sec
average over any hour, and the user thinks "if I use up my hourly
allocation, then my bit-rate response from the net will get poorer.
So I'll minimise the useless demand on the network so that I can
get a good response speed (high priority) later".

Currently, there are no negative consequences for high demand apart
from charging - and flat rate charging takes that incentive away.
So you can replace the charging incentive with the QoS incentive.
"The more you use the net, the lower your priority will be relative
to other users when the net gets congested."

We've all known about this from OS task scheduling for the last
20 years or so. Well, why not apply this to the Internet.
Every internet link is a task scheduler. Every packet is a task.
But here the idea is to identify the common ownership of sequences
of packets (e.g. static IP address) and apply a dynamic priority
to each user, so that their packet scheduling priority depends on
how well they fit their SLA. This is the "SLA comparator" concept where
you modulate priority etc. according to SLA adherence.

Every packet is analogous to a CPU time quantum.

Every OS now gives priority to interactive I/O-bound processes
as opposed to CPU-bound processes. The internet should do the same
thing. I know that Cisco routers etc. give priority to telnet
as opposed to file transfer protocols on a TCP port basis.
But that's very crude indeed.

&gt; Some data has a known, low cost to bandwidth
&gt; saturation (incoming newsfeeds.) Other kinds are either rsync-cacheable or
&gt; rsync-able if you know what you are doing. If all bandwidth consumers in
&gt; Adelaide that these technologies were relevant to were able to use them, I
&gt; think it is intuitive that the bandwidth requirements curve would flatten
&gt; out a lot.
[....]

There are a zillion applications layer strategies for economizing on
bandwidth, like compression, proxies, caches, mirrors, and all the
other tricks that other people know more about than I do.
I prefer the IP layer approach because it attacks the problem
where it occurs - it can be applied throughout the internet
in principle, on all IP routing points.
If you can build in the _incentive_ in terms of prioritising
SLA conformant traffic, then the user will _want_ to use
compression, caches etc. etc. - and most important of all,
if they don't really need to use the Internet, they won't.

Remember that in companies and other big organisations, it's
usually the Finance Officer who deals with the monthly bill,
and they like to have fixed costs which are known (or limited)
in advance. Hence they prefer flat rates.
The employee who generates the Internet usage has no real
cost incentive to minimize usage.
But they user at the workstation _does_ have the incentive
to get good QoS (i.e. bit-rate) by frugal usage of the net.

And if you have 10 people using the same link, the ideas
I propose will pinch off the bit-rate of all 10 users if
one user is wasteful. Then it's up to the other 9 users to
put pressure on each other to not run down their
access priority.

[Technical note: If you're using a Weighted Fair queueing
(round robin) queueing algorithm, the SLA comparator
modulates the queueing "weights". If you're using 
token bucket style queueing, the SLA comparator modulates
the bucket rates which limit the user bit-rate.]

Once again, the linux relevance here is the fact that every
linux 2.4.x box is a free, sophisticated router, shaper 
and general bandwidth manager already,
and you even get a free development environment into the
bargain. Who could ask for anything more?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
