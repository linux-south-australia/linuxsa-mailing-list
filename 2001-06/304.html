There's lots of languages. A modern langauge that is presented in a way
that often suits busy people is python, www.python.org. A lot of money and
time has been spent over the last couple of years producing nice
documentation in many forms, so it is easy to get going. It is unlikely
that Python will suddenly become unpopular, so the skill is probably going
to be marketable for some time to come.

But thousands of people start off programming with C, Java, Perl, Pascal
(not so common on Linux, but Kylix from Borland might change that,
<A HREF="http://www.borland.com/kylix">http://www.borland.com/kylix</A>), C++, PHP, sh, awk, ruby, eiffel, rexx,
assembler and BASIC (not so common on Linux, and nothing is likely to
change that) - I even came across someone who first programmed in Erlang,
which I thought was brave.

All of the above apply to BSD (I've never tried Kylix, but it seems
unlikely that it won't work.)
