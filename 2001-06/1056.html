 &gt; I think I see a subtle difference between your and my opinion here.
 &gt; Whereas I was saying that you can't revoke a licence, you seem to be
 &gt; saying that you can.

That's not what I said at all.  In fact, I explicitly began my statement
with "as long as the original license doesn't expire...".

Hypothetical:  You've published some software, and you've written a
license which permits me to use it.  I don't care if it's GPL, BSD, 
or Microsoft EULA, it doesn't matter.

I've agreed to be bound by the terms of that license.  Happiness reigns.

You decide that you want to change the license terms, so you write 
another license, and you put it in front of me and say, "You'll need
to agree to this now."

So the question is, "What am I required to do about this new license?"

The answer depends on whether the original license is still valid.
I'm not actually forced to change to your new terms unless the old 
license is somehow revoked -- Either by an explicit clause which says
you're allowed to revoke it, or by an expiry, or by some other thing
which is described therein.  As long as the old license is still binding,
I'm not actually *required* to switch to your new terms.

Nevertheless, I can choose to be bound by those new terms if I wish.
I can, if I wish, terminate the contract we've struck in the form of
the old license, and agree to the new one.  Then the old license terms
won't cover me anymore.

This is why commercial licenses usually have some kind of clause in them
which permits the licensor to terminate the license -- It's so they can
introduce new license terms and then terminate the old ones:  If your 
old license has evaporated out from under you, the choice you get is 
different:  You can either accept the new license or stop using the 
software -- the software publisher has total control over that process.

The situation with the GPL is different, though, because it's a perpetual
license.  Once you, as a licensee, have agreed to its terms, you can 
never be forced into different terms.

For people who *aren't* licensees, though, the situation is different
again.  If a piece of software which used to be published under the GPL
is now published under different terms, new users can't fall-back onto 
the GPL because they never agreed to use the software under those terms
in the first place.

So:  If you publish software under the GPL, and then change your mind
and use a different license, you create three classes of people:

   (a) people using your software under GPL terms, who chose not to adopt
       the new license terms;

   (b) people using the new license terms because they decided to terminate
       their agreement under the GPL;  and

   (c) people using the new license terms because they've never had the
       option of agreeing to use the software under the GPL, because they
       received it after the date when you decided that you weren't going
       to offer GPL terms anymore.

If that looks like a minefield, that's probably why software publishers
who send something out under the GPL don't often change their mind.

 &gt; You also spell licence in the US fashion.

I don't care.

 &gt; Is it maybe that US licenses can be revoked whereas Australian
 &gt; and UK licences cannot?

Or maybe it's that you didn't understand the language I used :-)

 &gt; Or is it more complex than that?
 &gt; Or do you mean that the authors could get together and
 &gt; decide to release _future_ distributions under a new licence?

A single distribution can be licensed under more than one set of terms.
There is no need to introduce a new version just to put it under a 
new license.
