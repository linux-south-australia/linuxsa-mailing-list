Hi There,
    Please in future post in text only format as many people
don't like html mail and will ruthlessly flame you or worse
for it, some even reject it out of hand and send it straight
to /dev/nul. Now that this friendly reminder is over, to
your question.

    As far as I know NOT YET, however the hard drive
manufacturers have been talking about changing a standard to
help with pirating software with the software manufacturers,
that could mean that writing software to a drive without the
proper permissions and authorisations that the manufacturers
and software distributors give you would be impossible. If
this were to be the case, there would be some sort of
verifying system in place on the drive that you had
permission to write to it which would probably be a hardware
and software system. This system would also have to be
common enough so that it worked with many different drives
and software.

    O.K. now that the background is laid, if there is a
software component to the write permission of the drive, and
it is a common standard, then it is possible that this could
be cracked and a drive lockout could occur. It would depend
on how it was implemented as to if it was permanent or not.
Low level formating, not usually done by users any more, MAY
be able to fix the problem, maybe not. It would depend
entirely on how and if it was implemented.

    Last year on Slashdot there were several articles on
hard drive manufacturers and software companies working to
get this kind of standard implemented, but it was shouted
down, however this doesn't mean that they are not going
ahead with it anyhow. So the short answer is that somebody
may have found a way to do it now, but most people hope not.
But it could happen in the future. Virus writers are
ingenious people (many are sick ingenious people) but
ingenious never the less. I would say that if it can be
done, it will be done by somebody sometime.
    Pray it CAN'T be done.
        Cheers!
            Andrew.

Hi all,

Having a discussion and thought the list could verify this.

Can a virus contain code that could write to your hard drive
and permanently disable the drive?

Cheers,

Antony
