LMAO

&lt;big snip&gt;
&gt; Good, I try to get them back too :-)
&gt; Did you know that when newbies first post here, it's classed in business talk, as a
&gt; "Moment of Truth", it's when they gain an impression of the list, it's members and
&gt; it's culture.  If new people experience a Moment of Truth that is to them
&gt; unpleasant, they will take with them an impression that reflects on all of us.
&lt;/big snip&gt;

Perhaps I should complain about shoddily formatted e-mail too ;-P

WARNING WILL ROBINSON

The next two paragraphs are intended for fun and sample purposes only.
They are not intended to be any hotter than an ice cube in the freezer.
If it offends you, it's only because you don't have a sense of humour.
If you don't have a sense of humour, then delete RIGHT NOW...

Maybe something to the effect of

&lt;bitch mode="on"&gt;
If you silly, little QUAL, don't format your e-mail sensibly next time,
I shall remove the CYBER and roast you alive. After, of course, causing
you to suffer the first cardinal sin, GREED, because QUALs are just far
too thin and have no meat on their puny bodies in the first place and I
hate being hungry after a roast meal.
&lt;/bitch&gt;

END WARNING

Now, really, are we going to take that ridiculous example (READ
__EXAMPLE__ FOR THOSE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL LOWER CASE) as serious?
It's just as ultimately ridiculous as asking somebody whose RFC name is
"pegasus" to make my computer fly but it does make a point.

Oh this is so droll and it's so way out of proportion to what actually
happened that even I am having difficulty working out how to exceed its
being out of proportion without mentioning Adolf Hitler...the Nazis...or
anything to do with fascism ;-P
