It's not hard to mail your logs to a local user. 

'cat /var/log/messages | mail <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>'

or even for Postfix, I can grep for errors, warnings etc. and mail only
those results.

The question still remains, though. Why on earth do you want to see a
copy of boot.log on the web? I mean, if something's seriously wrong with
the box, going to a web page served from the box in question isn't going
to work.

If you really want bits of your server logfiles on a web page, try to
make it intelligent information that is of use to someone. Don't put it
there just for the sake of it.

Ask yourself, "What do I need to know from my server at any given point
in time?". Write them down somewhere and -then- work out ways to get
that information to you.

It may turn out that the web isn't the most appropriate way of
delivering that information. A SMS message may prove to be much more
fitting in your situation.

Lastly, Mr Karthikeyan, for future posts, please add a bit more detail
as to what it is that you are trying to achieve. "can any 1 help me out
int telling me the utilities for the foll. log files in linux" isn't
descriptive at all.

Try using something like:

"What is the best way to check my /var/log/maillog (MTA: Sendmail)
logfiles for errors, attempted relays etc"

instead of:

"What utilities do I use for the mail log file?". What do you want to do
to the log file? For all I know you want to print it and feet it to a
soon-to-be-sacrificed Goat.
