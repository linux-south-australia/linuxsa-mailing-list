Andrew,

I'm having trouble understanding your problem.  I think you described a
machine with an ethernet for an internal network, and a modem with ppp
for an external network, and this machine routes packets between these
two networks.  I think you explained that packet delivery over the PPP
link stops, even though the modems maintain carrier.  Is that right?

I used a pair of RH7.0 machines for a link to a remote office.
Each machine had an ethernet and a modem with ppp, and one did NAT plus
packet firewalling to implement a security policy.  These worked fine
during testing, but were unreliable in production.  Eventually, and at
random times, they stopped delivering packets: Pings would go unanswered,
and so on.  I could see ping packets go to the remote end and back, but
would not exit from the local machine (because RX/TX lights flickered
on the modems at the appropriate times), and PPPD reported that it sent
control packets (I think they were IPCP), and received acknowledgements.
Ultimately I rebuilt the machines using FreeBSD.

Subsequently I needed a similar setup for another remote site, which had
an existing RH6.2 machine setup for inbound PPP.  I used a FreeBSD at the
local end, and we have a similar problem, that is, packet delivery stops.
Sometimes flood pinging from one end or the other helps restore service;
in fact I think that's the normal work-around.  I've modified pppd to
permit me to turn the various levels of kernel and pppd logging on and off
by signal, and I'm waiting for the problem to recurr so that I can attempt
to trace where the problem lies.  My gut instinct is that it's a fault
at the Linux end, but I can't yet justify that, and won't even try to.

How much of this sounds familiar?

David
