&gt;&gt; Hi All
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would not use software raid, because Linux just does not have enough
&gt;&gt; tools, there is not an easy way to remove hard drives and add new ones in.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is not slow compared to good hardware, but it does load the CPU
&gt;&gt; unacceptable and this IS true because I had done extensive testing. If you
&gt;&gt; want the machine doing the software raid to do real work, forget about it.
&gt;
&gt; It would be good to get some objective measurements on this. We're running
&gt; software RAID on a number of Linux systems without performance
&gt; problems. What measurements would make sense? I imagine the following:
&gt;
&gt;   - an indication of raw hardware speed

This is very misleading.

&gt;   - performance doing some large copy and write ops

The real issue here is that large copy and write ops are not typical
usage of a file system, especially if you're doing only a single
thread.  You end up with something approaching sequential transfers,
which on modern IDE disks can be up to 35 MB/s.  In real life, you'll
probably not see more than a tenth of this value.

Take a look at rawio (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.lemis.com/pub/rawio-1.2.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.lemis.com/pub/rawio-1.2.tar.gz</A> for one
approach to the testing.  Note that it bypasses buffer cache by using
raw devices.  Last time I looked, Linux (as opposed to UNIX) didn't
have raw disk devices; you'd need to find a way around that to get any
meaningful data.

&gt; If you're using IDE drives have you used hdparm? The speedup factor
&gt; can be huge.

I don't really understand the use of hdparm.  I played with it a few
months back when testing a Linux box, but it seems to me that the
drivers should DTRT without it.  In particular, you should be running
in the fastest possible DMA mode by default.

&gt; If you're not using Intel-type systems with high clock rates then
&gt; you might be right. Greg, how does Vinum do as far as overhead goes
&gt; on !Intel hardware?

The only other platform on which it runs is Alpha.  I don't have any
figures on that platform, but I doubt it would be very different from
Intel.
