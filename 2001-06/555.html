&gt;During 'make' my kernel usually needs bzimage. I understand it's too

&gt;What can the bzimage fit into (scratches head)  that prevents the zimage
&gt;working .

In the same way that a donkey is too big to mate with a rabbit, an
oversized zImage is too big for the space reserved for it.

&gt;I mean, can someone explain what determines too big?

512kB!

In the early days, we used to build plain old Images, which had to be less
that 512kB because the amount of space that you could be sure was available
the way things were loaded in the early days was 512kB. Then, when kernels
started getting too big, the Linux gods introduced the zImage format. This
compresses the kernel image. However, it was loaded the same way as before,
so it had to remain under 512kB.

After a while, this too became a problem because of the mondo kernels
people were building, and a new way was found. This uses bzip2 to compress
the kernel, getting a little extra compression, but loads it in a different
way, which allows bzImages to be larger that 512kB. 

Indeed, the standard kernel installed by Slackware is an obscene 1047kB or
larger, which prevents you from copying it directly onto a floppy and using
it that way as an emergency boot kernel.

&gt;Curiosity has got the better of me.

Many a cat as lost its life that way :-)

&gt;TIA
