.... except when you sign a contract for a particular product, such as
the "freedom" bigpond adsl. We joined because it was unlimited
downloads. Now they've changed the contract, and we're stuck in a
contract allowing us 100mb per day downloads. Maybe they should be
changing the name to the Bigpond Imprisonment plan.

If they're making a loss they should change the rules, but they should
change it for new clients. Telstra should cut the loss of the existing
unlimited bandwidth clients and accept if they offer a contract which
they know from the beginning is going to incur losses, the client should
not be the one to suffer.

We are in a position where we have signed a contract for 18 months, for
a particular product, and three months after we've signed it, Telstra
change the product, we're stuck in the contract for 15 more months and
they send us a lovely letter via email basically saying "we're screwing
you over, and there is nothing you can do about it".

You can get an unlimited amount of downloads if you are willing to pay
an unlimited amount of money. In that sense, the word "unlimited" is
quite reasonable...if you believe that what is being advertised is
misleading then I would suggest that you talk to the advertising
watchdog rather than the LinuxSA list.

In my humble opinion, I shop for a "fair go" and that includes the
businesses I buy from too. If I suddenly find the bussinesses I buy from
have changed prices or policy to what I believe is my detriment then I
start shopping around.

There's nothing unfair about shopping around for a "fair go"; just
remember that the other side is looking for a "fair go" too :-)
