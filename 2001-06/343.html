and now I read the original request and realise that despite my copious
text, I didn't answer the questions :)

&gt; I havent done any programming before (apart from some basic HTML, and some
&gt; basic visual Basic) but i've become interested in programming because i
&gt; beleive you wont go very far in the IT industry or earn big bucks if you
&gt; dont have any (at all) experience with programming.

not true -- you cna earn money as a manager type, or a web developer, or a
sysadm (although programming helps here, I know people without a lot of
programming who earn a lot) or sales, or hardware, or etc.

If you're thinking career-wise, find something you like, and do it well and
with commitment. You'll make the money if that's what you want... One
interesting thing to note is that the money you make is less dependant on
your technical knowledge than on your other skills -- people, time
management, attitude, etc... Of course, if you are technically brilliant,
you'll probably be worth a fair bit, but it's not the only way to make money
in IT (and it isn't the only way to be of value, either -- making money and
being of value are linked, but not the same...)

&gt; I have a couple of questions.
&gt;
&gt; Where do i start?

generally, I'd suggest C, but see my other rant. shell and perl are also
good. Java is acceptable. Lisp etc is an "alternative".

&gt; Where can i get info about starting?

what sort of info? documentation? teach-me books etc?

&gt; Is linux c/c++ similar to that of windows c/c++ programming?

I'm no guru...

however, the languages (particularly C) are the same. The libraries you use
(the functions that you are able to call) can differ somewhat. C++ seemed to
me to be different everywhere. If you do GUIs, the main issue is learnign
the library and the "model" they use. MS windows has a differnt model to
GTk, which is different to Qt, which is different to Swing. If you're not
doing GUIs, they are similar, but windows tends to be less
programming-oriented. RAD environments like VB are great for their purpose,
and if you really want to work for a bank, that's fine, but if you want to
understand programming, and get into the serious stuff (not neccessarily any
more money), then these are not the tools for you, at least, not to start
on...
