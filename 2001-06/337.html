I understand well business models, indeed there is a great deal to be said for
sustainable business practices. However, it seems that on this list it is
tantamount to Heresy to criticize businesses for... shall we say 'screwing their
customers'? Companies like my own make money, Internode does the same, indeed
your company is entitled to make a profit. What some people can't differentiate
(with clarity anyway) is that Monopolies need to be controlled in their business
activities for the sake of other smaller businesses.  Is that concept really so
difficult to understand, I hope not, because unchecked Monopolies are a quite
simply a death sentence to competition.
I'm supportive of profitable companies, not unchecked profitable monopolies
Monopolies are quite different to normal businesses

As for 'almost free', take it up with Simon Hackett of Internode, I was quoting
from his posting (prior to mines) and he knows a great deal more about costs and
Telstra than me.

&gt; I have no idea what it costs to lay a cable from Australia to USA, but
&gt; I'm pretty sure it's not "almost free."  I'm equally sure that it is limited
&gt; in capacity.  Why is it so difficult to comprehend that unlimited use of a
&gt; limited and expensive resource is not sustainable?
