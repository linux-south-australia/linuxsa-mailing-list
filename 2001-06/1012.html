&gt; &gt;I think what Apple is doing is great - afterall, as Jordan's 
&gt; &gt;announcement says,
&gt; &gt;the power of unix with "real" applications on top.  But the problem (as far as
&gt; &gt;I see it) is that these wonderful things on top of the FreeBSD core aren't
&gt; &gt;available to me unless I purchase Apple hardware.  I'm not even talking about
&gt; &gt;cost, I'm talking about running all this stuff on the (Intel) laptop I own
&gt; &gt;now - there is no Intel port of the Mac OS X graphical shell.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You're viewing this whole thing bass-ackward.

I don't think I am.  Open source software is darn near close to
replacing the proprietry desktop, and here comes Apple, doing something
that is perfectly legal, and puts their great graphical shell on top of
FreeBSD and produces a great box.  But of course it's closed source.  I
can't improve, debug, port, except the underlying bit which is probably
the least value-add, especially from users point of view.
 
&gt; If you want FreeBSD on Intel, run FreeBSD on Intel.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want near-as-dammit FreeBSD (plus other nice stuff) on Mac 
&gt; hardware, buy Mac hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; We both win. Its only Microsoft users that loose. Remember which side 
&gt; of the fence Apple is on, whether you feel like buying their hardware 
&gt; or not

So how is Microsoft and Apple different in this scenario?  Both are
producing a proprietry platform.  One is half open.  One is half closed.
Both suffer that talented people like you can't get in and improve them.
 
&gt; [personally, I -like- their hardware - unlike the Intel clone soup 
&gt; [*] the hardware benefits from consistently designed architecture and 
&gt; a corresponding stunningly high degree of compatibility with 
&gt; additional peripherals of almost any persuasion. For people who want 
&gt; to actually -use- a computer, not fiddle with its innards as a 
&gt; profession, Apple have created 'Unix for the rest of us'. They 
&gt; absolutely should be applauded for leading the consumer market in 
&gt; client desktops - again. And now I get a highly useable system that 
&gt; also has gcc, perl, real unix, apache etc etc pre-installed out of 
&gt; the box. It's heaven on a stick]

That's great.  But why should the desktop be excluded from the other
great software you list?  Why should we have to suffer closed source
there?  If Apple gains market monopoly share on the desktop do you think
they will continue to be well-behaved members of the open-source
community?  or do you think we'll have another Microsoft?

Apple _have_ done a good thing and produced a very good platform.
Unfortunately they are limiting the scope of how great Mac OS X can be
by keeping the top half of their software closed off to those who would
want to make it even better.

I think the box is great.  I'd like one.  I'm glad you like yours.  But
it could be sooooooo much better, if only open-sourced!
