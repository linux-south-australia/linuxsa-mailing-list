[Re: 500 Mb per month 'limit' accounts]

&gt;
&gt;So far, admittedly not tested over many months, my only problems with this
&gt;limit are:
&gt;
&gt;   - it isn't intelligently managed. So if I am to get maximum benefit
&gt;     out of the limit I have to write download scripts which know about
&gt;     the date of the next traffic billing period. I'm hopeful that this
&gt;     can be changed over time. The trick is finding an equitable way of
&gt;     doing this. Simon has already mooted a kind of credit arrangement,
&gt;     whereby what you didn't use this month you can use next month. I
&gt;     am experimenting with formulae and will ask Internode about them
&gt;     when I know a bit more.

The trouble with 'intelligent' management is that the definition of 
'intelligent' in this context is somewhat debatable :)

There is in fact no -technical- limit. So calling it a limit is not 
strictly fair.

What there is, however, is a billing algorithm which provides for a 
flat-rate service, including both cross-Adelaide broadband transport, 
and global Internet access, and also including your first 500 mb's 
downloaded, in the name of providing some predictability to monthly 
bills, with charging in arrears monthly for usage beyond the included 
flat rate allowance. The correct industry term for this is indeed 
'flat rate' charging - a fixed cost for an finite bundled outcome.

If it was a 'limit' then the tap would turn off at 500 Mb - and it 
does not. Whether you think this is meaningless semantics is up to 
you, but I wanted to make that clear in case it wasn't. The tap just 
turns into 'pay as you go' at that point :)

Our aim is that people who plan to routinely exceed 500 mb's per 
month might move to the 1500 mb per month flat rate plan, effectively 
buying another flat rated chunk of up to 1000 Mb per month of flat 
rate access for an additional $110 per month in expenditure. If you'd 
prefer a variable cost bill, you'd say on the 500 Mb/mth plan.

The reason that this additional number works out to $0.11 per Mb 
rather than a somewhat higher 'normal' retail level is that it -does- 
include a generous allowance for the fact that some of the content 
inside that first 1500 mb's will tend to come from 'local' (i.e. 
lower than $0.11 cost to Internode) sources.

As one moves above that sort of monthly level, the truth is that most 
of the content in excess of that level is likely to be external, i.e. 
more costly, traffic (which is the reason the excess rate is not 
$0.11 as well). [Habitual downloaders of linux updates might well be 
an exception to that typical situation, and I appreciate that]

The excess rate is $0.18 per Mb, however we do actually have volume 
discounts which start to kick in at 2 gigs per month (on a sliding 
tier system which runs up at various step points all the way up to 
250 gb per month+). So the aggregate rate starts to trend down again 
for very large users, as a volume discount.

The -aim- of the flat rate pricing is that one selects a level at 
which excess bills are rare, -or- (for business or ISP customers) one 
alternatively expects that there will routinely be excess bills, 
because the expected download totals are well over the included 
(charging, not access) caps.

While this charging mechanism is certainly not perfect, it is 
unambiguous, and has served us pretty well for the last six years or 
so in the dialup and 'permanent' link spaces. It tends to avoid 
arguments - 'this is what we find'.

It seems to me that being assessed on a calendar monthly anniversary 
is at least, again, a clear and unambiguous way to work. I accept 
that its not perfect.

The issue with changing the algorithm in the future is a 
multi-faceted one. One of the primary drivers related to any change 
is a need to ensure that the charging algorithm is clear, and fair, 
and easy for customers to verify and understand. The current system 
is, in my view, all of those things, and I'd like to preserve that if 
possible.

I've been musing this morning about what 'fair' ways might exist to 
smooth the charging assessment process, so you aren't in the 
situation you describe, where a download might cost you $80 today, 
but 'nothing' (extra) tomorrow, if tomorrow is the start of the new 
charging cycle. However, it -should- still wind up costing you money 
if you keep doing it way beyond the 'included' sum over a 'typical' 
charging period.

What I've been toying with this morning is the notion of a single 
month carry-forward of 'unused' download allowance into the next 
month. Simple to describe, less trivial to cover the edge cases 
properly, but do-able. The aim being simply to address that 
'smoothing' issue somehow.

So in that (potential) world, if you had a 500 mb per month 'included 
allowance', and this month you've downloaded 300 Mb, then next month 
we'd carry forward the 'remaining' 200 Mb, meaning you could download 
700 mb next month without running up an 'excess water' bill.

However, if your downloads exceed both the intrinsic cap and the 
residual from last month, then you'd get an excess water bill - and 
(obviously) zero carry-forward into the following month.

It means that on our 1500 Mb per month plans, if you went on holidays 
for one month, you'd get a 3000 Mb allocation for the following 
month. But it would -not- keep climbing if unused - the mathematical 
limit point in a given month would be 2 x the intrinsic allocation, 
based only on the previous months' usage, not on any 'memory' beyond 
that.

This seems to me to be still (relatively) easy to understand, and 
(relatively) fair, without getting into the complexities of (for 
instance) moving averages of the last n months' usage, or any other 
more complex scheme.

The nett effect of such a system would be that a 'light' month gives 
you some forward credit against a lump of heavier usage in the 
following month. It means that if you didn't download the latest 
complete copy of Red Hat this month, you could probably do so in the 
next month with a reduced cost effect on your next bill.

It would be one approach to addressing the notion some of us 
discussed in this list a while back, of allowing you to avoid an 
excess bill if that excess bill was an exception to your own personal 
version of 'normal' (and providing that wasn't so exceptional as to 
be twice the normal cap).

Comments welcome - bear in mind that this is all 'thought experiment' 
stuff and doesn't represent any commitment of any sort at this point. 
I also find, even in trying to describe it here, that I'm thinking of 
wrinkles and complications, and (more importantly) to ways in which 
this could be mis-interpreted and hence misunderstood.

Long experience convinces me that a small amount of 'injustice' is 
better than a large amount of unhappiness caused by misunderstanding. 
So that needs to temper how we might ever approach this, going 
forward.

&gt;   - it counts bytes within Internode's own network. As I understand
&gt;     things there is a per-Mb cost for the tail into the exchange, but it
&gt;     is very low. Therefore it would be very nice to see this taken into
&gt;     account. Internode has already said that they will consider at this.
&gt;     Bytes within Internode's network aren't free (someone has to care for
&gt;     the links that supply them, after all) but I think this should be
&gt;     covered in the fixed-price component. So far I've got around this by
&gt;     physically transporting a hard drive full of OSs and root filesystems
&gt;     and then using rsync over the network thereafter. Clearly, the
&gt;     Internode limit would be prohibitively expensive if I had to install
&gt;     an operating system from scratch.

A few things apply to the above.

- The per-Mb cost for the tail into the exchange is not actually 
'very low'. We're still on the wrong side of break-even for ADSL 
service provision, and treading the difficult territory in terms of 
ensuring that we keep upgrading the access tail to keep up with 
customer growth, while also wanting to (eventually) reach break even 
on the overall costs of providing ADSL services.

So 'taking this into account' would indeed be nice, if it were true. 
But it isn't. ADSL is in fact the only carrier service we supply in 
which there is an internal form of 'double taxation' from Telstra on 
volume shifted in this manner. So the per Mb economics are in fact 
worse than any other manner in which we deliver them to customers. 
Period.

- Fixed price components; You might not appreciate (but the above 
hints at it) that the fixed price component of the ADSL offering 
comprises nearly all of the costs we charge at the 500 Mb per month 
'bronze' plan level.

The 500 Mb's included are basically not funded by the plan fee at all 
- we're giving it away, hoping that you might happen to download most 
stuff from somewhere local, to avoid driving your circuit into 
running at a loss for us. We hope to make it up in the $0.18 per Mb 
rate if you consistently were to exceed the cap.

When you download from external locations, you're costing us more 
than we're charging you in that base 'flat rate' fee. When you 
download from Internode or SAIX locations, you're costing us less and 
improving the projected break-even on ADSL service provision.  That 
tradeoff is already inherent in the price we charge. What does that 
mean? Read on:

&gt;
&gt;   - it counts SAIX bytes. This is a pain. It would be less of a pain if
&gt;     SAIX content providers such as Senet operated rsync servers (and had
&gt;     more rsyunc-able content.) Most of the previous point could be
&gt;     repeated here.
&gt;

Lets turn this around and define it properly. The service counts the 
bytes we deliver -to you-, over a reasonably high speed bearer, 
irrespective of their source. This is clear, and subject to less 
argument, than differential charging. What we do to improve our own 
internal economics is essentially up to us (as it is up to, and 
available to, anyone else who wants to join SAIX and improve their 
own internal economics by doing so, if they are large enough to 
justify the fixed costs inherent in a SAIX link - and there are 
several).

If this gives you an incentive to find ways to work with senet (or 
anyone else) to reduce the volume transfers needed to get your work 
done, that's just fine, and probably good - though I wish you luck 
with managing it with senet (as they seem to be turning more and more 
into ozemail).

This reduces argument - you can add up the bytes delivered and 
compare them to your bill if you wanted to. If we were ever to have 
an argument, it'd be about how much water you drank, not which 
aquifer it was sourced from.

Differential charging is technically feasible, but difficult. What 
happens when you download 10 gb from somewhere you -think- is 
'local', but it turns out that it isn't? Do you get (financially) 
shafted and leave us in disgust, or do we get (financially) shafted 
to make you feel better and stay? In a world full of virtual servers 
and geographically sensitive magic domain name servers, how sure are 
you about the 'locality' of content? [see footnote 1]

The thing to appreciate is that it would not necessarily lower your 
monthly bill at all - because (again) the local access discount 
(albeit in average terms, not customer specific ones) is already 
inherent in the monthly fees. A differential charging model would 
probably raise the base fee (to guarantee a margin for us so we can 
actually stay in business), reduce the per Mb rate for SAIX/local 
bytes, and apply a per Mb rate for 'non-local' which started from the 
very first non-local byte you downloaded (no 500 mb included 
allowance at all).

That would be 'fair' on all of us, while being more complicated to 
administer and charge, more prone to misunderstanding, and more 
likely to wind up with us all in dispute. All for what might be a few 
dollars a month of delta (and I'm not sure which way).

There is another option available here, actually. It isn't on the 
price list at our place officially as yet (because the paint's not 
yet dry on the pricing), but we've got another ADSL option, called an 
ADSL VPN. In this option, the other end of your ADSL service isn't 
'the internet', it is your office LAN. No volume fees at all (but a 
higher, fixed, monthly base price, and tail costs to reach your 
office in addition, but aggregated over all of your ADSL VPN users)

Then you can feel free to join SAIX in your own right as an 
organisation, and peer with it directly, while also enjoying 
'unlimited' traffic flow to and from your own office network, and a 
link which gives you 'internal' office resource access without 
needing a more complex firewall.

This moves the true costs of the SAIX data path back to you, so we're 
all being completely 'fair'. You might not have enough SAIX data flow 
from home to justify all of those expenses (including network 
managment costs to make it all work), however - and now we go back, 
again, to just how 'free' those SAIX bytes really were in the first 
place.

As always, reality is a bit more complicated than the way it plays 
out in the movies :)

Thanks again for the thoughts and I'll keep chewing on them. ADSL is 
a work in progress for us. We think we're doing well with it so far, 
that it's shown itself to be more reliable than the Telstra offering, 
more useful (fixed IP, and customer support that has clue), and it 
certainly runs like the devil at my place... happy to keep improving 
the offering, providing the improvements are done in sustainable and 
reasonable ways. Conversations on this list continue to contribute 
well to that evolution.

Cheers,
   Simon
