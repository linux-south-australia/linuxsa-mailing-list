I have often wondered and I know this is a real hot potatoes, do the BSD's
hold up better in small business servers than the current Linux's.  I don't
want to start a flame war, but would those who have had dealings, in line with
David's be willing to let us know what their experiences have been?

Has anyone had production BSD boxes replaced by Linux and vice versa?

&gt; Andrew,

&gt; I'm having trouble understanding your problem.  I think you described a
&gt; machine with an ethernet for an internal network, and a modem with ppp
&gt; for an external network, and this machine routes packets between these
&gt; two networks.  I think you explained that packet delivery over the PPP
&gt; link stops, even though the modems maintain carrier.  Is that right?
&gt;
&gt; I used a pair of RH7.0 machines for a link to a remote office.
&gt; Each machine had an ethernet and a modem with ppp, and one did NAT plus
&gt; packet firewalling to implement a security policy.  These worked fine
&gt; during testing, but were unreliable in production.  Eventually, and at
&gt; random times, they stopped delivering packets: Pings would go unanswered,
&gt; and so on.  I could see ping packets go to the remote end and back, but
&gt; would not exit from the local machine (because RX/TX lights flickered
&gt; on the modems at the appropriate times), and PPPD reported that it sent
&gt; control packets (I think they were IPCP), and received acknowledgements.
&gt; Ultimately I rebuilt the machines using FreeBSD.
&gt;
&gt; Subsequently I needed a similar setup for another remote site, which had
&gt; an existing RH6.2 machine setup for inbound PPP.  I used a FreeBSD at the
&gt; local end, and we have a similar problem, that is, packet delivery stops.
&gt; Sometimes flood pinging from one end or the other helps restore service;
&gt; in fact I think that's the normal work-around.  I've modified pppd to
&gt; permit me to turn the various levels of kernel and pppd logging on and off
&gt; by signal, and I'm waiting for the problem to recurr so that I can attempt
&gt; to trace where the problem lies.  My gut instinct is that it's a fault
&gt; at the Linux end, but I can't yet justify that, and won't even try to.
&gt;
&gt; How much of this sounds familiar?
