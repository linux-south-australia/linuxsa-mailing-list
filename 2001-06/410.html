&gt; Yeah, I must say that the 'leaky bucket' approach is starting to grow on me.
&gt; 
&gt; One nice aspect of it is that (correct if me I'm wrong, Alan), its 
&gt; worst case is no less permissive of extra-fee downloading that not 
&gt; having it.

Correct. The leaky bucket approach [technically referred to more
correctly as a token bucket, but very few people care about the
difference] gives more benefit to the user.
Ultimately it is better to the ISP too. Here's why:

1. Better for the user.
The leaky bucket approach carries over unused bandwidth on any
time-scale you like. I used the 1-day carry-over to make it
easier to explain to non-technical customers. But the simplest way 
to implement it is on a per packet basis. The algorithm is very simple
even for per-packet accounting. I use it all the time for 155 Mbit/sec
ATM traffic at full line rate, and it takes up less than 1% of the
total CPU time.

The 1-month accounting method where you throw away the
unused portion every month is obviously the same thing, except that
you throw away the unused portion. 

The leaky bucket method gives the user the same amount every day
(e.g. 100 MBytes/day)  - in actual fact you would give them
10 kbits/sec. (In my software, I dole it out in units of milli-bits
per microsecond. I'll leave it to you to work out why this might
be a good idea. Something to do with 32-bit number ranges and resolution.)

2. Better for the ISP.
The ISP with a fixed bit-rate link to the core Internet must
dimension the link according to the peak usage times in order to
keep subscribers happy. At peak times, you ahve the most users
active, and so you get a lot of unhappy congested users.

But if you have a marginal cost of 0 dollars per MByte in the
last day fo the month, users will tend to look at their
limit at the end of the month and rush to make use of that
"free" unused portion of bandwidth. That's when I do my
linux kernel and star office downloads!

Therefore it is in the interest of the ISP to keep demand
variability within each month as low as possible.
E.g. you might dimension according to the 90th percentile
of hourly demand. In that case, you really don't want
that end-of-month rush.

-------------------------------------------------------
So clearly everyone should be happier with rational pricing.

Now if you compare daily leaky bucket algorithms with
monthly leaky-bucket algorithms (i.e. just carry over
up to some limit at the end of the month), the difference
is more subtle. Now what you get is (probably) a slight benefit
to the ISP (i.e. reduction in permissiveness to the subscriber)
if you use the daily leaky-bucket, because now the user can
go way over budget for a single day, and then send nothing for
the rest of the month when using the monthly leaky bucket.

Personally, I think that the calendar-independent algorithms
are much better. 
These will smooth out the traffic nicely,
while allowing surges to any amount you like on a single day.

&gt; I've been thinking about this in the context of my own notion that 
&gt; customers dislike getting surprises, including those generated by 
&gt; billing algorithms that they can't understand easily. However, 
&gt; perhaps the leaky bucket algorithm could be described for the 
&gt; 'average punter' in simple terms (i.e. never charging more than not 
&gt; having this approach engaged, and rewarding customers for usage that 
&gt; is allowing 'space' for others to live in, or something similar)


I've spent a lot of time working out how to "market" 
advanced SLAs, shaping, charging etc.
I can give you much more info for particular technologies,
market sectors etc. etc.
But to put it simply, for this token bucket idea, I think it's
simplest to explain it as just a credit thing per day.
You say:

1.	You get 100 MBytes allocation per day.
2.	You may accumulate unused bandwidth up to a 
	maximum of 1 GByte.
3.	You may use all of your current bandwidth credit
	at any time you like, but when it runs out:
	plan A:	you will be cut off
	plan B: you will be charged 20 cents/MByte.

The numbers are whatever you like.
That's simple enough, I think!

And you should give the punters a web page where they can look
up their current credit too.
Easy!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
