&gt; i'll prove it - i use outlook, and woah! you see this in PLAIN text.
&gt; 
&gt; for the record - tools|options|mail format|PLAIN TEXT
&gt; 
&gt; it takes only about 5 seconds max!	

Except for Outlook's annoying habit of changing the format on you when
it's replying to an already formatted email.
And then it puts that disgusting blue line in and changes your text to
suit

And then you start to clean it up by deleting the extra lines it puts in
only to realize that it's decided to move the text out of the quoted
section into the section you're about to type in, which makes no sense
at all.

And then having that annoying "Double Space" line thing where it inserts
a blank space between two lines -- looks fine but you can't edit it.
The only way to clear it is to go to the line above, hit delete and then
press Shift-Enter.

If this were part of a bulleted number system it will then remove the
first bullet meaning you have to re-edit the entire section.

Then if you're game enough you just reply in HTML because you don't want
to change your text format -- you've preconfigured it, and you shouldn't
have to.  But if you do try, and reply in something like, say VERDANA
because it looks better than Times New Roman, you complete your email
and then go to insert your signature.  Alas!  Your signature appears in
Times New Roman, size 10.

So you think screw it, and go Format | Plain Text.

Then you think it's all better when you realize that because Outlook
quotes HTML with a blue quoting line, it has failed to insert those
lovely greater than symbols in the sender's original message.

Then you scream.




Have a nice day.
