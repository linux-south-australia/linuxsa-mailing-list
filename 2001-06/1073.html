&gt; I have an old Pentium 166mhz with 64mb ram in which I am performing a

&gt; being done while in multiuser mode, I suspect that there would also 
&gt; be a small amount of network activity, e-mails coming and going would 
&gt; be about the limit though.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been slugging away now for at least three hours, this seems a 
&gt; bit long, but on the other hand being ide and only a P166 it could be 
&gt; on track, I am not sure. There is nothing in any log files to 
&gt; indicate and problems.

I am not an expert, but... I think the chances that you get a 
self-consistent file system out of "dd" used over 3 hours with
a machine that's in use are rather low.
"dd" makes a linear scan, which would, I think, probably read in
the inodes first, and then the data blocks etc.
You're going to end up with all kinds of inconsistencies - probably
much worse than if you turned off your machine's power
during some serious activity.

The dump/restore programs seem to be remarkably resilient in the
face of continuing activity because of the way the dump program
organises its copying.
But if you want a precise file system snapshot, not just getting
all the files correct, then you will have to mount the file
system to be copied in read-only mode.
Anything else, as I say, should give you something at least
as nasty, if not worse, than a sudden loss of power would give you.
It woudl be more like 3 hours of power losses.

I hope the experts will correct me if I'm wrong.

&gt; Does anyone think there is a problem and that I should kill it and 
&gt; redo this is single user mode ?

Personally, I'd kill the job and try something that has a
reasonable probability of success.

&gt; I have looked at the man pages for verbose output, but there doesn't 
&gt; seem to be an option for it. Am I overlooking it or is there another 
&gt; way ?

I don't think you'll get anything useful from "dd" output.
It's just a block copier. As long as there are blocks to be copied,
it won't care less what's in them.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
