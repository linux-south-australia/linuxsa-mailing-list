David,

I did think of some of those things.
Here are a couple of lines from my /etc/rc.config <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

START_YPBIND="no"   
START_LDAP=no  

I gather that kerberos has something to do with ldap.
(One of these days, I'm going to read up on ldap and
kerberos, but my brain has a capacity of somewhere between
1 and 10 GBytes, and every time I learn something new,
some memory has to be deleted to make way for it.
So I'm trying to not learn anything that isn't essential.)

Anyway, whenever I see anything with the letters YP in it,
and a yes/no next to it, I always say no, because of
bitter experiences with Suns many, many years ago.

In fact, the delayed shell-change behaviour reminded me so
much of the YP/NIS behaviour that I made a dobule-check just
to maek sure. There's definitely nothing there.

It's just another of those wierd quirky things that I don't
have to the time to investigate.
I'm sure it will all be fixed in SuSE 8.1.
Besides, SuSE 7.2 has been out for a few days now.

Another of the dozen quirky things I've seen in the last week
is that I can start gnome from the KDE GUI login screen
you get when you boot, but not from the console with
"startx gnome" or "startx /usr/X11/bin/gnome" or anything.
All of the logs give no comprehensible clues.
I won't list the other 11 quirky things.....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I said in another e-mail that in the story about the
computer store owner, the customer asked for "a Unix computer".
In fact, I remember now that he asked to buy "a Unix".
That seems much more amusing to me.
I'd like to go in disguise to a computer store in Adelaide
some day and ask to buy "a linux". 
I wouldn't be surprised if they offer to sell me one with
a straight face!
