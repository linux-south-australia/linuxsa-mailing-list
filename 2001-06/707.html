Grrrr!

I decided that XFS is a good thing and to put it into production on my
main computer. Reasons:

1) reliability

It's a journaling file system and it's been in production under IRIX for
years. This doesn't mean there's no bugs in the Linux incarnation, just
that the concepts it uses are sound.

2) speed

It's most definitely faster than ext2 even though I can't get bonnie++
to say so on my test machine. Let's just say that I know how fast my
machines went under ext2 and XFS "feels" faster

However, that's not the point of this story.

To install it, I used SGI's pre-made RedHat 7.1 installer disc. This was
all very well, and my install chugged along quite nicely. Furthermore,
I'd made sure that I stacked my "X-Capable" monitor onto the machine
because under a RedHat Install - even if you force it into text - having
an X setup crash with my oldest monitor sends it into a spin and I can't
recover.

Lo and behold!

My media is damaged on xmms-devel-some numbers.rpm.

And I can't convince the STUPID installer to continue.

Eventually I think "F!@#$K this" and decide to do a reboot and a linux
rescue (because it was literally about 2 SECONDS away from the end of
package install).

Wonders beyond belief! NO linux installations are detected AT ALL :-(

So I fdisk, work out what should be what and start mounting things. It
didn't help that I'd mixed up /home and /var but I got the system KIND
OF working...

However, I discovered that RedHat sets up /etc/fstab AFTER (yes AFTER)
package install and the system came down in one great heap (for the
second time - by this time I'd thrown my FreeBSD 4.2 disc against the
wall, thereby breaking it, not because BSD is crap but because it
happened to be the least expensive breakable things around me).

Nonetheless, after 6 hours of gettting my production system back into
production it's working. And thankfully, this time I had multiple cpio
and tar backups of all file systems but /usr which went on without a
glitch.

&lt;sigh&gt;

Moral of the story: If you're writing an installer make sure that the
install does the most important things FIRST.
