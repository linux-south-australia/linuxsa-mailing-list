&gt; That's fine for you - but Red Hat is a general purpose distribution, 
probably 
&gt; most suited to people who just want to throw in a CD and see everything 
&gt; working.  If you want the latest experimental XYZ that requires a beta 
version 
&gt; of the ABC library, sure, go on and use something which requires a little 
more 
&gt; effort.  Red Hat is huge, because for most people it provides most things, 
with 
&gt; the least amount of thinking required.

I don't require the latest experimental XYZ requiring beta version of ABC -- 
I "just" want a nice, easy to use, non-bloated OS to use as my workstation. 
It's something the Linux world is rapidly forgetting about providing. 
RedHat, Mandrake and OpenLinux really are beasts.

It's something the BSD world seems to have got a strong grip on. Looking at 
my FreeBSD installation which includes X, Netscape, KDE2, Compiler Tools and 
a myriad of other stuff, I'm only using about 350MB. I tried to do the same 
the other night with RH7.1 and couldn't get it any lower than 700MB.

&gt; I use Red Hat becuase I don't care for fiddling with ISP dialers, firewall 
&gt; settings, or spending hours configuring the latest windowmaker - I just 
want 
&gt; something that works.  I'd rather spend my time _developing_ rather than 
&gt; _configuring_ software - Red Hat allows me to do what I want to do, 
without 
&gt; making me spend time fixing other things that may be fun, but get in the 
way 
&gt; of what I'm trying to achieve.

The thing is, getting what you've outlined above was actually easier (for 
me) under FreeBSD than it was under RH7.1. It took a good 90 Minutes to get 
RH7.1 upto the standard that I'd call "workable" (including Install, 
PPP configuration etc). The same setup under FreeBSD took me about 60 
minutes. I found the documentation under FreeBSD a lot clearer and more 
concise making many tasks a lot simpler.

&gt; That doesn't mean _your_ choice is any less valid.  If I had lots of spare 
time 
&gt; I would "./configure; make; make install" everything myself, but I don't, 
so I 
&gt; don't.

That's the misconception. I -didn't- have to do this. The fact that I'm 
spending too much time trying to get GNOME 1.4 to compile was something that 
I'd decided to do myself. GNOME 1.2 has already been ported. Wanting the 
nice Ximian touches, I thought I'd compile it myself. It is proving a little 
difficult, however. KDE2 is a perfectly usable desktop in the mean time.
