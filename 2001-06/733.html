Found this on LinuxToday.  Interesting.  You can't use OpenSource[1] tools to
produce software that works with this SDK, and you can't release your developed
software under an OpenSource licence.  (I'll ignore the question of why you
would want to).

How legal is this crap?

Michael...
[1] where I mean most of the common open source licences with the exception of
the BSD and Artistic licences.

This is an interesting enough development: the SDK license agreement for
Microsoft's Mobile Internet Toolkit (Beta 2) reiterates Microsoft's opposition
to open source/Free Software (with the notable exception of the BSD license),
claiming that they'll "create, or purport to create, obligations for Microsoft
with respect to the Software or (y) grant, or purport to grant, to any third
party any rights to or immunities under Microsoft's intellectual property or
proprietary rights in the Software. " This includes not being allowed to use
open source/Free Software development tools in conjunction with the SDK,
according to this EULA.

The license for Microsoft Mobile Internet Toolkit Beta 2 contains the following
section:

    "(c) Open Source. Recipient's license rights to the Software are conditioned
upon Recipient (i) not distributing such Software, in whole or in part, in
conjunction with Potentially Viral Software (as defined below); and (ii) not
using Potentially Viral Software (e.g. tools) to develop Recipient software
which includes the Software, in whole or in part. For purposes of the foregoing,
"Potentially Viral Software" means software which is licensed pursuant to terms
that: (x) create, or purport to create, obligations for Microsoft with respect
to the Software or (y) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights
to or immunities under Microsoft's intellectual property or proprietary rights
in the Software.

    By way of example but not limitation of the foregoing, Recipient shall not
distribute the Software, in whole or in part, in conjunction with any Publicly
Available Software.
    "Publicly Available Software" means each of (i) any software that contains,
or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software that is
distributed as free software, open source software (e.g. Linux) or similar
licensing or distribution models; and (ii) any software that requires as a
condition of use, modification and/or distribution of such software that other
software distributed with such software (A) be disclosed or distributed in
source code form; (B) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or
(C) be redistributable at no charge. Publicly Available Software includes,
without limitation, software licensed or distributed under any of the following
licenses or distribution models, or licenses or distribution models similar to
any of the following: (A) GNU's General Public License (GPL) or Lesser/Library
GPL (LGPL), (B) The Artistic License (e.g., PERL), (C) the Mozilla Public
License, (D) the Netscape Public License, (E) the Sun Community Source License
(SCSL), and (F) the Sun Industry Standards License (SISL)."
