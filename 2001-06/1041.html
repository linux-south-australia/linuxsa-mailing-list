If there's anywhere to ask for an opinion, this seems to be the place. :)

I'm looking at getting a digital camera. I'd like to be able to take a lot
of photos while flying or travelling on holidays. It should be small, easy
to use and robust. It should also be a sexy little gadget. :)

Currently I'm looking at a Canon IXUSv, which is 2.1Mp, 2x optical zoom,
can record video with audio in 30 second snippets, comes with 8MB memory
card and costs about $1k. This isn't enough memory for what I want so I'd
have to go buy a 128MB flash card as well.

Any other recommendations? I was thinking if I got a camera with plenty
of battery power and could plug in a 1GB microdrive, I would be able to
record a lot of images as well as using it as a video camera. Is there
any feasibility to this idea?

Incidentally, is 2x zoom as useless as I think it is?

I've looked around at a lot of web sites, but I can't find anywhere that
is willing to give an opinion or recommendation.
