&gt;  &gt; Apple _have_ done a good thing and produced a very good platform.
&gt;  &gt; Unfortunately they are limiting the scope of how great Mac OS X can be
&gt;  &gt; by keeping the top half of their software closed off to those who would
&gt;  &gt; want to make it even better.
&gt; 
&gt; But the instant Apple provided enough bits to permit someone to port
&gt; the MacOS to Intel, they would cease to exist.  Overnight.
&gt; 
&gt; People are making comparisons between Apple and Microsoft.  Those
&gt; comparisons are wrong.  Microsoft's bread and butter is software;
&gt; it competes directly with Open-Source software in that sense, and 
&gt; comparisons between Windows and {insert favorite open-source OS here}
&gt; are perfectly valid.

Isn't Aqua another competitor for GNOME/KDE?  Why have another group of people 
expending great effort to produce a really nice UI on top of a *nix?  Imagine 
if that innovation could be pooled.  **boggle**
 
&gt; Apple, on the other hand, is /not/ a software company:  Their bread
&gt; and butter is hardware -- They sell Macintoshes.  How do they convince
&gt; people to buy Macintoshes?  By also throwing-in the OS software which
&gt; permits application vendors to produce the apps which people love to use,
&gt; and formulating that OS software in a way which the same people also love
&gt; to use.

So Apple, being a hardware company, is not primarily focussed on selling 
software?  Why then is the software such an asset which could not be open 
sourced?  I think Apple are more of a software company which makes money from 
selling it's hardware that people have no choice in buying if they want MacOS 
- ie. no-one cares about their hardware except to run MacOS on it.

&gt; What happens if that operating system software gets ported to Intel? 
&gt; People stop buying Macintoshes.  Period.  Would a graphical designer
&gt; buy a Mac to run Photoshop if the same software, with the same look and
&gt; feel, on the same OS, was available on a $2000 kick-ass PC?  Of course
&gt; not, that'd be stupid.

I understand that this is the case.  The economic survival of Apple is tied to 
selling Macintoshes.  But the UI is still closed.  You and I can't tinker.  And 
that will affect it's potential uptake and community.

What if Apple decided to GPL all but a very small layer of software, so that 
their UI was tied to Mac hardware, but was mostly open; or open all of 
it and perhaps licence the software that it cannot be ported to another 
processor?
 
&gt; To say it's in Apple's best interests to keep the MacOS away from Intel
&gt; is a bizarre understatement.  Keeping MacOS on Mac hardware is 100% 
&gt; *essential* to Apple's survival.  So why, pray tell, do they have any
&gt; reason at all to open-source the OS?
&gt; 
&gt; Enquiring minds what to know.

With all due respect, I am not primarily concerned for Apple's survival.  
Apple's shareholders are.  I have no desire for Apple's demise, but that is not 
my primary concern here.  I'm concerned about having the best computing 
platform available for use - and that use includes the ability to make 
modifications, fix bugs and develop further.  A MacOS X box could be that 
platform, except for the freedom bit.  If Apple can make a truck-load of cash 
doing that then that's great.
