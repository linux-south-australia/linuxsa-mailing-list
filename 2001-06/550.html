&gt; &gt; However, I am wondering why they are still at 0.0.6 ... to me, the tool
&gt; &gt; seems quite mature.
&gt;
&gt; Netsaint is mature. The functionality Tellurian added (the embedded perl
&gt; interpreter) got in to version 0.0.7b1, and was in production at several
&gt; quite large sites by version 0.0.7b3. Sorry if you don't like the number
&gt; zero but that's how it is :-)

the question is why? why have _such_ a low version number? If it's mature,
why not go to 1.0? I'm hoping someone on this list actually knows
specifically the reason why netsaint has such a low numbering scheme...
(BTW: I thought the _general_ consensus on version numbers (or at least, the
most often used scheme) is major.feature.bugfixes -- ie major, fundamental
changes for major version numbers, added features for the minor version
number, and bugfixes for the last number... yes, I know many egs differ...)
...

if they used a more conventional scheme, they (netsaint) could be at say
0.7.3 rather than having to have a 3rd beta of an alpha version...

sigh...

&gt; If you really want a bad day, look at the output of this:

I don't mind software at 0.0.x if it's buggy and incomplete... I just have
issues with produciton-ready software staying at low numbers...

maybe someone could fork netsaint, and re-release it as NetSaint Gold 1.7.0
...
