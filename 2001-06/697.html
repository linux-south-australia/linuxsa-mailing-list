&gt; Actually, to elaborate on this, it would seem to me that you want something
&gt; like:

&gt;   exec /path/to/some/program "$@"

Ah, I did - the first argument in the argument list was the program name.
The script was a wrapper around other programs, and the reason the above
come into it was because I was told it wouldn't work because I couldn't
pass in an option like -s "Subject heading goes here" without it breaking.
As David Newall pointed out, that's exactly what "$@" lives for.

&gt; However, in any other place they seem not to be of much use. Even in echo
&gt; they don't seem to make any difference.

echo might be masking the effects.  Consider the difference between
echo hi there, echo "hi there" and echo "hi      there".
