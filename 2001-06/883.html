&gt; I had ximian gnome on my machine the other day, it was so poor, i kept it

&gt; running on its own! Incidently, i run Debian 2.2, but ximian was still a
&gt; dog.

The fact that you run Debian probably has nothing to do with your
apparent speed problems.

I'd say that the reason for this unbearable slowness is Nautilus. It
uses Mozilla for way to much stuff and sucks up heaps of RAM (something
you forgot to tell us how much you have).

Try "ps xa | grep -i 'nautilus'" and kill them. GMC still works (Ximian
Doorman would have asked you this during installation) fine and is less
memory hungry than Nautilus.

Incidently, I think that Enlightenment is probably going to suck up more
than its fair share of memory too. The bizarre graphics and effects that
Enlightenment likes to show off suck up a tone of memory and CPU time.

As a footnote, I'd like to mention that my notebook (only a PII233
w/196MB RAM) runs XFree86-4.0.3, Ximian GNOME 1.4 (GMC not Nautilus),
Evolution 0.10.99 (CVS Snapshot), XEmacs, Netscape Navigator, VNC with
TWM,a dozen terminals as well as several open SSH sessions. I notice to
lag and I can't find any reason to complain.
