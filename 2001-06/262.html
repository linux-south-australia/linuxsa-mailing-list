Damn! I've been using them since the days of iname (my address is still
@iname.com) and havnt _noticed_ any probs. I hope my mail isn't being
stored! Anyway, Excluding this (if I am affected) I havnt had any probs.
The only thing to watch out for is they have spammed me, but I looked at
the headers and busted them. I dont know if they still spam other
people, but at least they leave me alone now. The forwarding is good.
It'll let me change isps one day without chainging my email. (providing
they stay in busness, and keep working - I hope this isnt an impossible
ask!)

&gt; OK, I just need to whinge:
&gt; 
&gt; I use mail.com as a mail forwarding service. It blows. For at least a week
&gt; now, it's been eating my mail. There are no notifications sent back to
&gt; senders, and I see no sign of any mail. They tell me that they are aware of
&gt; problems (their front page has a link to an explanation of sorts), and that
&gt; no-one's mail is actually being lost, it's all being stored. Has anyone else
&gt; had this problem? What on earth can I do about it? I'm in the process of
&gt; setting up my mail server, but that is taking some time, and besides, people
&gt; who send mail to my old address will think I'm ignoring them. At least they
&gt; could reject the mail!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, to anyone out there who needs to send me mail, please use either my
&gt; present home address (<A HREF="mailto:richardrussell@internode.on.net">richardrussell@internode.on.net</A>) or my work address
&gt; (<A HREF="mailto:russell.richard@saugov.sa.gov.au">russell.richard@saugov.sa.gov.au</A>)...
&gt; 
&gt; Dammit I hate computers :)
