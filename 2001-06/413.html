&gt; Dan, you could write the software and offer it to ISPs to do exactly what
&gt; you want to be done with controlling/bounding your traffic.

And you could do a great deal more than this too.

But something else occurs to me: cost isn't always the issue, although
attemps are made to make everything have a cost. Bandwidth is finite and
no user or supplier ever wants to see it all used up. So quite aside from
charging for usage, what incentives can be built in that encourage frugal
use of this resource? Some data has a known, low cost to bandwidth
saturation (incoming newsfeeds.) Other kinds are either rsync-cacheable or
rsync-able if you know what you are doing. If all bandwidth consumers in
Adelaide that these technologies were relevant to were able to use them, I
think it is intuitive that the bandwidth requirements curve would flatten
out a lot.

Of course most people can't. There is no rsync-able zip and it isn't that
easy for Win32 users to use any kind of rsync (well, rproxy might compile
with Win32 Apache maybe, but how many Windows web surfers run Win32
Apache? :-) It would not be at all hard to get this going from a technical
point of view.
