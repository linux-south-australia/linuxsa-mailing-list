&gt; I asked this question around 6 months ago, Have a look in the archives mabey. I 
&gt; remember being told to stick to bash scripts...

I would prefer Perl over any kind of shell script due to the debugging and
syntax checking features of Perl. I hate finding a bug (missing space
etc...) in a shell script (any of them) that shows itself only when a
rarely encountered condition (if statement etc...) comes up. How far can
one reasonably regression test a small script? A tool should work for the
user and not against them.

Are there any tools available that can do that kind of sysntax/context
checking for errors in shell scripts That are similar to Perl with or
without the -w option?

PHP is very much optimised for server-side work. PHP grew out of what was
initially a wrapper for Perl and moved on from there.
