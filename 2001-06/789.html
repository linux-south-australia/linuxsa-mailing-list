&gt; I agree with you.
&gt; Despite the huge amount said on this subject in too many forums,
&gt; including a response I got from RMS in about 1995 about this
&gt; to an e-mail I sent him on a related subject, I'll say this:
&gt;
&gt; Does RMS think that he lives in a country called England/USA?
&gt; After all, the USA takes its language and many of its
&gt; institutions and people from England.
&gt; And do we live in Britain/Australia?
&gt; I don't think so.
&gt; I wrote a little essayette on this subject here:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/linux/lingl.html">http://www.topology.org/linux/lingl.html</A>
&gt;

I have not followed this thread at all, but I did read your link.

I am curious about dsoem of your descriptions/defintions as to what
consitutes an OS.

I infer that part of your definitionis if the program runs in user or kernal
space.

If this is correct, then how woudl you calsify the OS "servers" that run on
top of the mach kenral (in userlnd) and provide what are noramlly OS
services to other programs/libraries?

Are such servers OS's?

What about ppp? I bleive in some OS's it runs in userspace, not kernal
space, and I suspect it doesnt provide access to hardware devices, i suspect
it just wraps and unrwraps data, before wrting it to hardware via drivers.

Is PPP part of the an OS?


On the subject of the GNU/Linux debate, I think rms usualy says that linux
systems are not Linux, they are GNU/Linux, ie if you have aPC with Linux
loaded, you probably have a whoel lot of otehr stuff on there too, to make
it actually sueful, and a very large portionof that softwar,e specially the
basic stuff that users interact with, is GNU software.

In other words my gbelief from what I recall having read some of rms's
papers ont eh matter nad having heard hmim speak a few times, is he is quite
ahpy for the linux kernal to be known as the linux kernal, but he thinks
that things like redhat distribution,s or debian distributions, oie packages
of software that inlcue more than the os, shoudl be called GNU/linux.
