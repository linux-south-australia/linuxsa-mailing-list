Hi All,
    I don't think I have missed the point at all. My point
is a NEWBIE, ie someone who probably HASN'T posted before,
who DOESN'T know David LLoyd or any others, and who DOESN'T
know the normal rules of etiquette.

    If you went to a new group of people instead of an
anonymous newsgroup, and you asked a simple question to
someone, and that person's response was to berate you
because members of the group all wear bow ties and you were
wearing a bandanna, even if all the other members knew from
experience that this person would react that way, how do you
as the new person find out if nobody tells you? If someone
you didn't know got stuck into you because of your standard
of dress for 5 mins, even if they answered your question,
most people's response would be to switch off or just walk
away, and most of them wouldn't come back. If however there
was a sign at the door that said you should wear a bowtie
and here is a simple quick fix if you don't have one, and
some members get quite annoyed at non-conformists, AND
someone pointed it out to you BEFORE you went in, then you
would be far more likely to stay in the group (or at least
deliberately non-conform and expect to be berated).

    Some people are thick skinned and can take "constructive
criticism" others are not. I don't have problem with people
flaming others, I like a good argument sometimes, but if you
take a minute to see where some of the posts to this group
come from, there is a wide geographical area involved. We
have had some people from Malaysia, Singapore, Canada and
Europe that I have seen from time to time in the about four
years I have subscribed to this group. These people are from
wide and varied cultural groups and it isn't hard for
misunderstandings to occur in message postings (I have seen
a few of those too). All I am saying here is, why not treat
the absolute new person in a manner that is less likely to
offend, regularly post the "Rules" of the list and as part
of the subscriber notices and encourage people on the list
to stay.

    As a final point, I will not point the finger at anyone
in particular, but some of the threads on this list become
some what "passionate" over certain topics, and some threads
degenerate into personal slanging matches. Now I know
usually we don't know who specifically subscribes and
unsubscribes, but some slip through onto the list for
whatever reason. I have noticed on more than one occasion
that often after one of these afore mentioned debates, there
are several people who unsubscribe from the list. This may
be unrelated to the content of the list, but I am willing to
say it is likely that some do unsubscribe because of these
threads.

    All I am saying is think about the person trying to
enter the group before you scare them away.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; &gt; And thanks to Andrew Pullin, good on you mate for
stickin up for the
&gt; &gt; newbies. I nearly ran away, but I don't scare easy. lol
&gt;
&gt; I think Andrew Pullin got the wrong end of the stick. You
weren't being
&gt; flamed, just being told in typical David Lloyd fashion.
You had your
&gt; problem solved, didn't you? I can't see any tangible
evidence that would
&gt; suggest that David has crossed the line.
