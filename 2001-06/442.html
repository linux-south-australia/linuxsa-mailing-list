&gt; The issue with changing the algorithm in the future is a multi-faceted

OK, you asked... :)

I think a business naturally wants to sell products and/or services at
cost price plus a percentage profit. All the juggling around with bills
is trying to achieve is "this is what it cost us, now add a bit on top".

The problem here is that precisely matching customer billing to actual
costs incurred has the problem of sharing too much information... much
like closely coupled objects in an OO program.

So if the customer had a simple interface to the billing system, it
wouldn't matter how complicated you made the billing calculations.

So how about a very tiny, self-refreshing, web page that puts up the
following very simple information:

   ------------------------------------
  |   Your next bill will be: $34.56   |
   ------------------------------------

which gets updated in real time. Then I can shrink that browser window
down into a small box that sits in the corner... or I could write a
little program (in Ruby!) to put that information into a pretty icon on
my task bar.

Some additional information about current charges can be included, but
the bottom line is what I have no trouble understanding, even if you're
using sunspot activities to calculate your costs.

That frees you up to put billing computers onto the local LAN, the
SAIX exchange, your outside links, anywhere you like. You can even
charge different rates for peak or idle periods of the day.

The downside is not being able to use Radius logfiles or whatever
"dump to file and analyse later" scheme that may be in place. Still,
it's definitely do-able, depending on how your networks are set up.

On another, related, topic... I agree with Alan that customers need
to be able to set up their ISP connections with bandwidth throttling,
customised port filters and other firewall parameters.

It would be great to be able to do things like:

  "Full bandwidth up to $40, half bandwidth to $60 then email only"

It would also allow blocking DoS attacks at the ISP end. Though the
ISP still pays for the traffic, hopefully the 5cr1ptzK1dd1ez will
give up earlier when they see their attack isn't working.
