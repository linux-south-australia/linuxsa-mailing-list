I've got an ADSL account, but not with Telstra (Internode, in fact - you
may have heard of them.) Internode have a 500Mb/month limit. I do not
download music or movies, but I do run a large number of free operating
systems, and I do operating systems simulations which involve large
filesystems in strange formats. On the other hand I do know how to run
rsync and web proxies.

So far, admittedly not tested over many months, my only problems with this
limit are:

  - it isn't intelligently managed. So if I am to get maximum benefit
    out of the limit I have to write download scripts which know about
    the date of the next traffic billing period. I'm hopeful that this
    can be changed over time. The trick is finding an equitable way of
    doing this. Simon has already mooted a kind of credit arrangement,
    whereby what you didn't use this month you can use next month. I
    am experimenting with formulae and will ask Internode about them
    when I know a bit more.

  - it counts bytes within Internode's own network. As I understand 
    things there is a per-Mb cost for the tail into the exchange, but it
    is very low. Therefore it would be very nice to see this taken into
    account. Internode has already said that they will consider at this.
    Bytes within Internode's network aren't free (someone has to care for
    the links that supply them, after all) but I think this should be
    covered in the fixed-price component. So far I've got around this by
    physically transporting a hard drive full of OSs and root filesystems
    and then using rsync over the network thereafter. Clearly, the 
    Internode limit would be prohibitively expensive if I had to install
    an operating system from scratch.

  - it counts SAIX bytes. This is a pain. It would be less of a pain if
    SAIX content providers such as Senet operated rsync servers (and had
    more rsyunc-able content.) Most of the previous point could be 
    repeated here.
