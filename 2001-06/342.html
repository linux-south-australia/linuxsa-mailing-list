Rants ahead! (that's _R_ants, not Pants)

how learn programming depends on what you want to do with it. It's a wide,
wide field.

If you want to be a better sysadmin, learn bourne shell (not the bash parts,
just the bourne stuff), perl, and C.

If you want to do system programming, learn C and assembler.

If you want to do large scale app developement, learn C initially (with
small apps), then move on to C++ or Java.

If you want to do GUI stuff, learn Java/Swing, C++/Qt, C/GTk or Perl/Tk.
There are other combinations of lang and toolkit, but these are the main
ones I know of. You could also try OpenGL or Java3D if you are into that
kind of thing.

If you want to do web development, learn Java/JSP/EJB/Corba or Perl/PHP.
Definitely learn at least one of HTML and SQL (depending on if you want to
do backend or frontend).

If you want to do RAD, Borland JBuilder/Delphi/Kylix, or, really, any of
those types of tools... However, it's recommended not to start with these.

If you want to do academic stuff (or have some particularly niche or unusual
skills), try lisp/elisp, prolog, fortran (if you like maths), MPI, PVM and
so on. Note that some people find these (particularly lisp) to be
extraordinarily useful in the real world... I recall a /. article on a major
project or web application written in lisp, and they were convinced that
lisp _was_ there competitive advantage...

If you like mainframes, COBOL is it. :)

For general use, I'd recommend C... as someone said below, C makes
everything else make sense. It's close to assembly, it is primative but
effective, and it helps you think like a computer (whehter you want that or
not is another story)...


As for how to go about it... You need a reference. I'd look for a good book,
man pages, online doco (be careful not to buy a reference book where the
contents are also online, unless you really want/need a book -- this is
often the case with Java stuff... many people just rehash the Javadoc from
java.sun.com), and/or a knowledgable friend. I'd say this part is essential.

The actual learning can be book-directed, but be careful of the
24hour/21day/for dummies etc varieties... they tend to be shallower than
they look. (not always, but just be careful of them). O'Reilly are reliable,
as are Addison-Wesley. Generally, the less exciting, smaller books are
better. If you decide to go non-book directed, try experimenting with small
existing programs. You could even look at an old version of something like
'cat', and try adding features from a newer version. Try interfacing with
things like shell, mail, etc... Try doing the same, simple thing in a few
differnt languages...

Finally, the biggest piece of advice I can give you is to plan. Don't just
get into the code. Decide approximately what you want to acheive (eg I want
a program that prints prime numbers in a tight loop as it calculates them,
terminated by any key), then plan it -- design your algorithm and program
structure with the computer off. You can do this in pseudocode, you _don't_
need to know any language to know how to do this... just pretend you're a
computer and write your algorithm in a way that someone who doesn't know
what you are trying to do could do it (eg someone who doesn't know about
prime numbers, but can write and has and can use a calculator). _then_ try
writing it in your language of choice. BTW: this will really only work for
small program in a procedural language, but it's a good start.

If you want to start with OO, it's a slower process to see results, but
(depending on philosophy/religion/etc), you can end up with a better
product.

....

&gt; &gt; Once you learn C, everything else starts to make sense.
&gt;
&gt; LOL. But do pointers ever make sense?

pointers are "everything else" ...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; Then if you want to go further than this, you can extend C
&gt; &gt; by using C++, which permits you to go from 10,000 line programs
&gt; &gt; to 500,000 line programs without losing complete track of
&gt; &gt; what you're doing,
&gt;
&gt; I thought C++ was emphatically NOT C nor an EXTENSION of C.

news to me -- the language is a superset, I think...

of course, if you are writing C++, it's best to lose your C idioms, and go
with the OO way properly... IMHO, this is what makes Java so much better
than C++ -- there's no legacy of confusion. If you choose OO, don't go half
way.
