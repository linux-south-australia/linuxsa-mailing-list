 &gt; &gt; So:  If you publish software under the GPL, and then change your mind
 &gt; &gt; and use a different license, you create three classes of people:
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;    (a) people using your software under GPL terms, who chose not to adopt
 &gt; &gt;        the new license terms;
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;    (b) people using the new license terms because they decided to terminate
 &gt; &gt;        their agreement under the GPL;  and
 &gt; &gt; 
 &gt; &gt;    (c) people using the new license terms because they've never had the
 &gt; &gt;        option of agreeing to use the software under the GPL, because they
 &gt; &gt;        received it after the date when you decided that you weren't going
 &gt; &gt;        to offer GPL terms anymore.
 &gt; 
 &gt; There's a real difficulty here because of the way the Internet
 &gt; works. Because you don't go to the premises of the author
 &gt; and obtain your copy of the software personally and shake hands
 &gt; on it or sign a licence personally, it's difficult to know just
 &gt; when the licensee has actually received the software - before or
 &gt; after the stop of issuing of the old licence.

It has nothing to do with the Internet;  Shrink-wrap commercial 
software has exactly the same issues.  If you purchase software
with a particular license offered to you, you may accept the license
as a condition of sale, and be bound by it -- Even if the vendor is
now offering the software under a different license.

Once again, that's why commercial software licenses permit the vendor
to revoke a license, vary the terms, etc, after you've agreed with it.
Commercial vendors also deal with the issue by removing old software
with old licenses from the shelves and replacing them with new versions
with new copies of same.

 &gt; Suppose I get hold of a an old linux distribution disk and
 &gt; click to accept the licence a year after that licence has
 &gt; been superseded. Is that still a valid licence?

Of course it is.  Whether or not you're dealing with Linux is immaterial.

 &gt; If not, then clicking to accept the licence has no meaning.
 &gt; You really have to phone up and ask if the licence is
 &gt; still on offer.

Have you ever phoned up and asked if the license accompanying your
copy of Word is valid before installing it?  That's nonsense, Alan.
If software is distributed under a certain license, then that's that.

Your copyright gives you the ability to dictate distribution terms, 
however.  You can choose which license software is distributed under.
But if you pick a license which permits third-parties to redistribute
without consulting with you, you have effectively set up a situation
where anyone may receive new copies of software from third parties 
under old license terms, even though you might be offering the same
software under new license terms direct from the source.  Why?  Because
the third-parties are redistributing under the old license terms, which
you and they have both agreed to, which grant them a perpetual right
of redistribution.

That isn't hard to understand, is it?

Now, if you want to release software under a license which permits
redistribution, but requires licensees to phone you up to work out
whether the license is still valid before they use the software, then
that's your right as a copyright owner too.

 &gt; Once the software+licence is out there in the wild, surely
 &gt; anyone who accepts the licence may use the software as
 &gt; indicated. I.e. licensing is nowadays an asynchronous process.

Yes.  But most "indications" in licenses permit more or less unfettered
use.  They usually only control redistribution.  If you don't limit 
redistribution, then you've effectively released software with an 
irrevocable license which can spread forever, even if you later change
your mind.

 &gt; If you wrote a song and put it in the public domain, you wouldn't
 &gt; expect that the people who haven't seen the sheet music yet
 &gt; woudl be forbidden from using it for free just because you
 &gt; have issued a new (or same) version with a licence fee
 &gt; indicated on it.

You would expect that, actually.  Copyright is automatic;  Anyone performing
any music must be licensed to use it.  You can get such a license by 
talking to the music publisher, or you can get it by performing it from
sheet music which contains an explicit dedication to the public domain.
But you can't perform it for free from sheet music which doesn't say you
can perform it for free.

The situation you think is implausible is actually the situation which
the law dictates.

 &gt; They could still get a public domain
 &gt; copy from someone else and copy it.

Yes, they could.  But then they'd be performing from the public domain 
copy, not from the unlicensed copyrighted copy.

 &gt; The GPL does say that you can distribute the software
 &gt; in perpetuity - even to people who had not accepted the licence
 &gt; before the issuing of the new licence terms.

See above.  This is pretty straightforward.

 &gt; As long as I get my copy of the software from someone who _did_
 &gt; accept the terms, I should be fine.

Yes.  You aren't necessarily "fine" if you get your copy from the 
author, though.
