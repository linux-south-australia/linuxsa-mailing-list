&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I really don't see the fuss about people who want
&gt; unlimited downloads. Remember when BBSs were common? They

nor do I. I can't see why people can't just find an ISP who gives them
unlimited downloads, buy the service and live with the AUP. If you don't
like it, lump it. Some of us choose to buy a 'limited' account, and are
happy with that. I wouldn't really want an account with an ISP who also
offered 'unlimited' accounts, at least, not if I have to share network
infrastructure with them.

&gt; had this problem too with people who were usually referred
&gt; to as "leaches". The idea was that if you downloaded
&gt; something, then you had to upload something sometime. Many
&gt; BBSs had a Download Ratio that people had to maintain and
&gt; this usually ended up with the leaches just uploading 5
&gt; copies of virus scan or something and didn't really solve
&gt; the problem at all. In the end as BBSs became multi line
&gt; they solved the problem by either charging by data or just
&gt; flat rating. A flat rate works the same as a salad bar at a
&gt; restraunt in that some people eat the entire offering and
&gt; you roll them out at the end of the night, whereas others
&gt; nibble a piece of lettuce and give up. Surely if some ISP

The lettuce nibblers are the profitable ones, so you want to attract them.
The eat-till-they-drop people are margninally profitable or loss-making, so
you want to discourage them. Why encourage lossmakers if there's no upside?
Think about it.

&gt; offered this facility it would work. Most restraunt that
&gt; offer this don't go broke (O.K. some do). What is the
&gt; problem here? Very few modern leaches have enough disk space
&gt; to download wuarchive or any other large file database, and
&gt; not everybody who has the facility would use it either. It
&gt; is just a simple fact of life that there will always be
&gt; people who play the system whatever it is, and in a user
&gt; pays system, some users will always pay some part of their
&gt; share of the minimum transaction fee in supporting those
&gt; others. ISPs just need to price themselves into the market
&gt; to cover it. If someone is serious about downloading every
&gt; version of every linux distro every day or the Dallas porn
&gt; archive, let them, just charge them an appropriate fee. Some

I'm sure most ISPs would be happy to charge you an appropriate fee for
downloading that amount of data if you wanted.

&gt; people will do so on such a plan, others won't. If it is
&gt; properly priced, then the ISP won't go broke, and the
&gt; punters will stop complaining because you have given them
&gt; what they want.

Pretend you're a business.

You have customers who cost you more than they give you. You don't want
them. You change a policy and either get rid of them or turn them into
profitable customers (at the least, you limit what they cost you). Why would
it matter if these customers complained? They are unprofitable anyway! Even
more so, if they weren't your customers, you'd go out of your way to keep it
that way -- why attract loss making customers?
