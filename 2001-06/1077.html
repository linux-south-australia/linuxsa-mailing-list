I have had my say on this list before on stuff like this, needless to say I'm
in agreement with you Andrew. Some people on this list think it's ok to be
rude, personally I think they need help.  I sort of cringe when after the
install-fest comes and goes, there is usually a posting about welcoming the
'new linux users'. What we should do is 'warn' new list members about the
'politically correct' zealots and hope we don't lose too many :-)

This is supposed to be a list for all, unfortunately some people, for reasons
unfathomable can't help making new members feel,  emm...-uncomfortable?

Nice to see you working to make things better too :-)

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I don't think I have missed the point at all. My point
&gt; is a NEWBIE, ie someone who probably HASN'T posted before,
&gt; who DOESN'T know David LLoyd or any others, and who DOESN'T
&gt; know the normal rules of etiquette.
&gt;
&gt;     If you went to a new group of people instead of an
&gt; anonymous newsgroup, and you asked a simple question to
&gt; someone, and that person's response was to berate you
&gt; because members of the group all wear bow ties and you were
&gt; wearing a bandanna, even if all the other members knew from
&gt; experience that this person would react that way, how do you
&gt; as the new person find out if nobody tells you? If someone
&gt; you didn't know got stuck into you because of your standard
&gt; of dress for 5 mins, even if they answered your question,
&gt; most people's response would be to switch off or just walk
&gt; away, and most of them wouldn't come back. If however there
&gt; was a sign at the door that said you should wear a bowtie
&gt; and here is a simple quick fix if you don't have one, and
&gt; some members get quite annoyed at non-conformists, AND
&gt; someone pointed it out to you BEFORE you went in, then you
&gt; would be far more likely to stay in the group (or at least
&gt; deliberately non-conform and expect to be berated).
&gt;
&gt;     Some people are thick skinned and can take "constructive
&gt; criticism" others are not. I don't have problem with people
&gt; flaming others, I like a good argument sometimes, but if you
&gt; take a minute to see where some of the posts to this group
&gt; come from, there is a wide geographical area involved. We
&gt; have had some people from Malaysia, Singapore, Canada and
&gt; Europe that I have seen from time to time in the about four
&gt; years I have subscribed to this group. These people are from
&gt; wide and varied cultural groups and it isn't hard for
&gt; misunderstandings to occur in message postings (I have seen
&gt; a few of those too). All I am saying here is, why not treat
&gt; the absolute new person in a manner that is less likely to
&gt; offend, regularly post the "Rules" of the list and as part
&gt; of the subscriber notices and encourage people on the list
&gt; to stay.
&gt;
&gt;     As a final point, I will not point the finger at anyone
&gt; in particular, but some of the threads on this list become
&gt; some what "passionate" over certain topics, and some threads
&gt; degenerate into personal slanging matches. Now I know
&gt; usually we don't know who specifically subscribes and
&gt; unsubscribes, but some slip through onto the list for
&gt; whatever reason. I have noticed on more than one occasion
&gt; that often after one of these afore mentioned debates, there
&gt; are several people who unsubscribe from the list. This may
&gt; be unrelated to the content of the list, but I am willing to
&gt; say it is likely that some do unsubscribe because of these
&gt; threads.
&gt;
&gt;     All I am saying is think about the person trying to
&gt; enter the group before you scare them away.
&gt;
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; And thanks to Andrew Pullin, good on you mate for
&gt; stickin up for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; newbies. I nearly ran away, but I don't scare easy. lol
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think Andrew Pullin got the wrong end of the stick. You
&gt; weren't being
&gt; &gt; flamed, just being told in typical David Lloyd fashion.
&gt; You had your
&gt; &gt; problem solved, didn't you? I can't see any tangible
&gt; evidence that would
&gt; &gt; suggest that David has crossed the line.
