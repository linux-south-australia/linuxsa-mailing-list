I'm doing a bit of a study at the moment comparing various (not
necessarily free, but affordable) database systems. At the moment I'm just
wanting to eliminate those that are clearly not for me. After that I plan
to do some performance testing.

The options I'm looking at are postgresql 6, postgresql 7, openbase,
frontbase and interbase. Mysql has been dropped because it doesn't support
transactions. I'm including postgresql 6 as a base, because it's the only
one I've worked with before, and it's part of debian stable (I wish debian
stable would make an attempt to catch up sometimes..). An alpha of
openbase/linux has just been released. I'm a little concerned about it,
because in the installation instructions it says stuff like..

"3.  Add the following line to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file.  This will
make the OpenBase processes startup at runtime.

/Library/OpenBase/bin/openexec
[...]
5. Reboot."

Nevertheless, I've heard good things about the tools that come with
openbase..

I've got a list of requirements, and a couple of queries about a few
entries. Firstly, postgres7 claims to be SQL99 compliant, and yet
everybody else talks about SQL92. Is 99 largely insignificant, or is it
unrelated to 92?

I'm also interested to hear anything which would lend sharply against or
in favour of any of these platforms.  Important stuff that it's difficult
to get onto a spreadsheet include factors like "will I discover the db to
have certain features mysteriously absent when I come to use them?" (eg:
alter table delete column in postgresql 6); "does it scale?"; and "is it a
bastard to install and admin?" (has anybody ever seen oracle for linux
work?). Links to any particularly helpful articles on the web would be
appreciated also. I've done some searching, and found plenty of free
database comparissons, but not many on commercial products. (And when it
is on commercial, it will talk about db2, sybase and oracle, which are
quite pricey :) )

So far, I've only used postgresql6, which was unpleasant. It doesn't
support one of outer or inner joins (can't rememeber which.. inner?
whichever isn't the really basic one :) ), and a whole lot of other stuff.
Performance is also nothing special :) However, an article on
phpbuilder.com gives me the impression that 7 is a huge improvement over
6.

On the archive, there's a post from Alan Kennington asking a similar
question in May 1999 at
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/1999-05/41.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/mailing-list/1999-05/41.html</A>, but when I clicked
on thread.. the thread could not be found :) Nick Lothian also wrote
something encouraging about interbase, but I couldn't get back to the
thread.. is it possible there's something wrong with the [thread] links on
the archive? [subject] was more helpful, but again, the focus was on
freedbs only.


One other thing, I notice that email addresses are put up on the archive.
I'm under the impression that that's bad because spammers use webcrawlers
to harvest email addresses. Am I being paranoid, or are there plans to
change the email mask of people to something like "name at domain.dmn" ?
