Hi.

Well, maybe. Not misassumption - just analysis of the arguments proposed.
If there is a third then roll it in. The proposition that:

CPU + Raid Software + system Load

Results in a better solution than:

Cpu + system Load with off-cpu Raid software running on dedicated CPU

Still needs proving. Like I have said before, I'm happy to take it on
board, and I don't wish to downplay the marvel of being able to do this in
software on the system CPU or anything like that. I just want to know 'Is
it really better' My questioning is not based on can I do it cheaper (or
dearer), but is this a better solution?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmm.  Do you have a source for this information?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Regardless of where Glen got his information, what do you think sounds
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a more plausible version of his statement?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's from testing I did on an old Sun box, now that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think about it almost a decade ago.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The "file manager" approach was a lot less common then,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I take Greg's point about directory traversal.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; You question was where did I think the bottle neck was ? right. Well
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the only difference was the software raid 5 calculations so that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; must have been the bottle neck.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I consider that unlikely.  They're not nearly as CPU intensive as you
&gt; &gt;&gt; would think.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I could see in top that the 'user' load have not increase much but
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 'system' load had increased dramatically. This would also indicate
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that the load was in the kernel.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Correct.  But you'd need to profile it to find where the real issue
&gt; &gt;&gt; was.  Vinum RAID-5 calculations make almost no difference.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Forgive me for pointing out something ambiguous with this whole hardware
&gt; &gt; versus software raid argument.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On one hand I am told that software raid is better cause the hardware
&gt; &gt; cards have a low spec cpu on them, and spare cycles on the system cpu are
&gt; &gt; a much better resource for doing the raid calculations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On the other hand, when Mike says that software raid loaded up his box,
&gt; &gt; the response is that he must be mistaken, because 'they're not nearly as
&gt; &gt; cpu intensive as you would think'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Which is it?
&gt; 
&gt; Neither.  It's your misassumption that there can't be a third reason.
&gt; Of course, until we have more details, we can't know what the real
&gt; problem is.
