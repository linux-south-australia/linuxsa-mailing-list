 From a little reading via google, it seems some cable and adsl 
companies keep mac addressess to ensure only they know (to some degree) 
what equipment is on their network.  Also hackers seem quite adept at 
getting hold of mac addresses from isp's.

I searched "IP+mac address+hack"  and there was a great deal of 
information onhow to do it.

It looks as if it's not too dificult to get hold of a mac address if 
your persistent & knowledgeable

&gt; How is your power management setup?  I mean, the specific BIOS settings.
&gt; No guessing, now; you have to reboot and enter BIOS to answer this one.
&gt; I ask because last time I looked it seemed that you could wake up on
&gt; all sorts of different interrupts.  Working with the WOL idea, I suppose
&gt; the ADSL modem must know your computer's MAC address (from last time they
&gt; spoke.)
