&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But they have to do a bit of forward thinking first!!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Including how to get their customers to understand what (to them) may 
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to be a very complicated approach to what their 'limit' is. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Again, I'm saying -to them- - not to me or to you - because they're 
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ones that'll be racing off to the TIO to hit up on what might 
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem difficult for them to understand.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Both you and Alan have some background in this area, but I have none. I
&gt; &gt; simply can't assess what would be better.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But if you offered a service where:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    a) I could choose to have a conventional charging scheme, or
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    b) I could choose Alan's leaky bucket, with loads of parameters tunable
&gt; &gt;       by me, but
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    c) Amid all the complication there was a guarantee that I cannot
&gt; &gt;       tune my plan to be worse than XYZ, where XYZ is some basic 
&gt; &gt;       conventional charging scheme, but
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;    d) With the exception of (c) above the ISP could specify that the
&gt; &gt;       charging was never any worse for them than some set of parameters
&gt; 
&gt; Dan,
&gt; 
&gt; I am always so perplexed when people use the word "complicated"
&gt; to describe any service level spec or pricing spec that is more
&gt; complicated than a single multiplication and addition.

Well, I did say in point (b) "with loads of parameters tunable by me". In
other words, take the leaky bucket as you described it in pserldo code and
put in as much of the benfit of your research as you can, and stick that
behind a cgi that talks to the billing database. I think the only
innovation (if it is that) which I'm proposing is that both the ISP and
the customer have a known worst-case.

If I was faced with a web form that offered me "TB (token bucket) arrays,
TB trees, TB array-trees, sustained bit-rate profiles (max bit-rate as a
continuous function of time-scale), probabilistic sustained bit-rate
profiles (total traffic distribution as a function of time-scale), trees
of PBRSs" and more, I would

   i)   read the help pages until I roughly understood the parameters
   ii)  satisfy myself that I wasn't going to go broke by fiddling
   iii) make sure there was a way to measure the effect of any changes
        without me having to construct my own graphs etc
   iv)  start fiddling

But no way would I understand what was going to happen before I did it.
Over time, I would start to get a users-side feel of how your 12 years of
research bears on my desired and essential usage patterns.

I also think the data from this exercise (ie what charging regime I
eventually feel happy with) should be valuable feedback for the ISP in
creating packages for users who are scared by the concept of user-fiddles
charging schemes.

Maybe some local ISP should employ you to write a test rig to run over
historical data to see how these algorithms would have impacted customers
and end-users in the past.

&gt; The service/charging scheme I was suggesting was arithmetically
&gt; identical to the monthly carry-over concept, except that I was
&gt; proposing a daily carry-over.

Quite so. Thankfully I don't yet find this too difficult to follow,
despite my approaching dotage.

&gt; &gt; Then I could tune the account to suit my particular pattens of use without
&gt; &gt; fearing that I might inadvertently sent myself broke.
&gt; 
&gt; This is what I've been saying for well over a year now to various
&gt; ISPs. But ISPs think that if their customers use too much bandwidth,
&gt; so much the better.
