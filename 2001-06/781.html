True. It is, however, hard to assume what Mr Sekar is and isn't trying
to say. We could go on for ages suggesting all the possible thoughts
that are floating around in his head, but that'd be pointless.

Technically, you're right. It would make installing a root-kit harder.
What's important to note however is that by mounting / as read-only,
you're not eliminating the possibility of being attacked.

If you're really paranoid, you could build a database containing the
MD5SUM of all the files on the / filesystem. Syncronise that database
with a server outside of your network and run a script that compares the
two. If they're the same, you can be reasonably certain that your data
is secure and authentic. This does have issues that you need consider,
but I'm not about to go into them now.

Again, it's not going to -prevent- people from installing root-kits or
doing other nasty things to your machine. It does let you know (often
several hours) after the event, however.

&gt; If you want to make a file system read-only, you can either do that in
&gt; fstab, or you could use LIDS (<A HREF="http://www.lids.org">http://www.lids.org</A>).

I've not used LIDS. Seems like an interesting topic (that could possibly
be explored further at a meeting) that may prove invaluable in many
situations.

Tripwire is also rather groovy when it comes to intrusion detection.

&gt; If you specify that the file system is read-only in /etc/fstab, it can
&gt; usually be remounted (by root) as writable.

Seems an aweful lot of stuffing around to edit '/etc/inetd.conf'.
Changing a password would also present a significant hassle using this
method.

&gt; Lids lets you specify files, directories, and filesystems that are
&gt; read-only (not even root can modify them) as well as providing heaps
&gt; of other cool security features.  These security features can be
&gt; enabled and disabled on the fly by entering a password.

This is great from a remote-exploit protection point-of-view, but isn't
going to save you when 'Special Governmen Agent Nasty Guy' removes your
hard drive and steals all your secrets. That's a rather 'out there'
scenario, but the point is that there's more than one aspect to system
security.

&gt; Of course you'll want stuff like /tmp and /var to be writable - you
&gt; could either put these on unprotected partitions, or configure LIDS to
&gt; allow files in the appropriate places to be modified.

LIDS seems like a more reasonable solution to Mr Sekar's problem.
Mounting the / filesystem as read-only seems an awefully painful way of
preventing one aspect of your system.
