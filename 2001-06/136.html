&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where I can get some qic-80 type tapes.
&gt;
&gt; I have no idea about that.

Try as I might to suggest a man page for me to say 'RTFM blah', I can't.. ;)
How about RTFTP, or RTFE for the trading post and ebay, respectively?


&gt; &gt; I have 2 tape drives
&gt; &gt; here that I think take them and I'd like to try it out. The drives are the
&gt; &gt; sort that connect to the floppy cable and both were setup fine in Windows.
&gt;
&gt; I'd get their exact model number and start searching on google to see if
&gt; they have any drivers. If they were pure SCSI tape drives I'd say
&gt; without doubt they work with Linux but I've never seen anything about
&gt; tapes that connect to floppy drives. Perhaps a more specific model
&gt; number and brand would be helpful...

David, you've never heard of the ftape driver? it's been in linux for as
long as i can remember.. Version 2 is dated 1994, but i guess version 1 was
around a few years before that. I'm pretty sure if you did a search for
'floppy drive' and 'tape drive' and 'linux', you'd get ftape in the first
page of results.

Anyway, its the floppy-tape driver, and works with the popular and
well-known range of tape backup units using the horribly slow floppy
interface. Amazingly, the various tape drives that use
the floppy interface have some sort of standard they adhere to, because
everyone i tried worked. Your mileage may vary.

Its pretty easy to use, once the module is loaded just use /dev/ftape as the
argument to tar..

eg, to backup your home directory

tar -clpzf /dev/ftape ~

If your home is larger than the size of your tapes, you'll need to
investigate the other tar options; there's quite a lot about tapes in there.
--tape-length xxx is how you specify the amount of data you want to write to
tape before you are prompted to change tapes. i guess thats the main thing
you'd need to know? Its been quite a while since i've used it myself.

Have fun. They make good streamers, in the party sense, once you realise
you can burn a 650mb (or 1.2mb compressed, to compare to tape sizes) cdrom
in around 8 to 9 minutes, and take a 40/80 mb tape takes bloody ages, and
that the tape costs about 10x as much as a blank cd.
 ;)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; The only tapes I have are some 40MB 205feet and these wont work in these
&gt; &gt; drives. I'm a newbie when it comes to tape drives. Can't I just specify the
&gt; &gt; type and length of tape I'm using?
&gt;
&gt; When you can get Linux to speak to the device you probably don't need to
&gt; specify that at all. Supposing that your tape drives will eventually
&gt; behave like SCSI tape drives (DLT's, DAT's), my understanding is this:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Data on a tape is just a stream of bits
&gt;
&gt; File separators are either recognisable by the hardware, or might
&gt; consist of some predetermined sequence. Whichever, the hardware or the
&gt; driver will just "know" this so you don't have to worry.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Writing to a tape
&gt;
&gt; You just throw bits at the tape device and the tape will work. With SCSI
&gt; tapes you have devices that will rewind after a command (/dev/st0 for
&gt; example) and devices that will not rewind after a command (/dev/nst0). A
&gt; non-rewindable device is useful if you just want to keep on adding stuff
&gt; to the tape without having to worry about clobbering what's already on
&gt; there.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Reading from a tape
&gt;
&gt; You get bits out of the tape device. You can use something like dd
&gt; if=/dev/nst0 of=tape.dd with all the options that dd takes (man dd). It
&gt; won't read past the file mark if it finds one, or the end of tape (for
&gt; obvious reasons).
&gt;
&gt; 4) How do you determine end of tape?
&gt;
&gt; Well, according to the amanda distribution the most sane way is to
&gt; assume that any EOF or error is actually the end of tape (that's a
&gt; paraphrase by the way so don't quote me). In other words, you don't
&gt; necessarily know. In addition because tape drives have the nasty of
&gt; performing hardware compression you may not actually know either.
&gt;
&gt; Hence, you may not KNOW how large your tape is.
&gt;
&gt; 5) Sending commands to the tape drive
&gt;
&gt; Using the mt command with -f, eg:
&gt;
&gt; mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
&gt; mt -f /dev/nst0 status
&gt; mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf
&gt;
&gt; Look up man mt.
&gt;
&gt; CAVEAT:
&gt; Because your tape drives are _not_ SCSI tape drives and what I've said
&gt; broadly applies to the SCSI tape drives I work with, they may have
&gt; different characteristics; they're almost certainly not going to be
&gt; called "/dev/st0 or /dev/nst0" but I may be proven wrong. I hope that
&gt; what I've said will help you a little in understanding how tapes work.
