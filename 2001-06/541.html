&gt; &gt; I am looking to set up a text messaging system on a linux machine so any
&gt; &gt; failures on other servers can be indicated via text message on a mobile
&gt; &gt; phone to whoever is on call. Does anyone have any experience of doing
&gt; &gt; this.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; If so, how did you go about it. I am interested in any methods that are
&gt; &gt; available.
&gt;
&gt; NetSaint (<A HREF="http://www.netsaint.org/">http://www.netsaint.org/</A>) is an excellent product for Network
&gt; services monitoring. It even generates graphical maps of your Network
&gt; devices and their status.

NetSaint rocks. We use it at work, and have written some plugins for it that
monitor logs of applications etc...

However, I am wondering why they are still at 0.0.6 ... to me, the tool
seems quite mature. We have been using it since 0.0.5 (or earlier), and it
seems pretty much feature-complete. There have been few (if any) problems
with it, and as far as we can tell, it's at what we would have thought would
be 1.0 level. I can't find any reason why it's not at 1.0 on the website,
and an email to the author remains unanswered... Anyone know why this would
be the case? I can understand not wanting to release anything until it's
right (so maybe it should be 0.9 or 0.8 or something -- at _least_ 0.1), but
I feel bad(ish) using software at 0.0.6 in a production environment...

Can anyone shed any light?
