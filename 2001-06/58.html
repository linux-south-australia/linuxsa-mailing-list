David!

&gt; Of course you didn't.  You implied that you prefer to ask the list instead
&gt; of reading the manual if you would otherwise have to spend more than a
&gt; certain period of time reading.

If you have all the required tomes of knowledge to build a car, the
tools and the base materials, you could probably build a car by reading
the tomes of knowledge and using the tools available. However, you might
judge that it would be more economical to pay someone else to build the
car; furthermore even if you decided to build the car you still might
find it easier to ask other people to explain some point in the tomes of
knowledge.

Now, every particular person is going to understand the tomes of
knowledge in a different way. One person may find Section One very easy
to understand but be completely at a loss to understand Section Two.
Another separate person may find things the other way.

I have a set of Linux/Unix/GNU manuals in my man pages. Given enough
time we could probably set an auto reply on this list and say read the
man pages and other documentation. I explained already that I ran across
a situation which I believed was outside of the man pages; that I hadn't
actually read the specific man pages is not part of this argument.

I had supposed that bash was similar enough to the default shell for
FreeBSD that I could simply port my knowledge to Linux.

&gt; That's reasonable rhetoric.

Yes, I thought so too.

&gt; By all means recant, or explain if I misunderstood you; otherwise you've
&gt; been caught out!

We are all practical people. Sometimes it's more efficient to ask others
than to read the documentation because they might know more than you.
Last time I looked, <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A> was a place where you could
ask questions...
