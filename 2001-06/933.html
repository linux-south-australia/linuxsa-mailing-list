LIBRARY BOOK DONATION PROPOSAL
------------------------------

Approximately two months ago, the idea of a "library repository" donated
by the Open Source Community in SA was discussed. The idea was to raise
funds to provide set of reference books to place in an easily accessible
library so people who didn't have the funds, or didn't really need to
buy a book, had access to quality, book documentaiton.

The local chapter of AUUG Inc, AUUG-SA (<A HREF="http://www.sa.auug.org.au/">http://www.sa.auug.org.au/</A>) is
willing to help raise funds to purchase the books for actual donation.

Furthermore, AUUG-SA is willing to manage the actual funds raised in an
account created for this purpose; we'll absorb the fees that the banks
inevitably charge and provide a formal framework for approaching
potential sponsors or corporate donors for this project.

I expect that our formal title for this project would include "AUUG-SA
and LinuxSA" or "LinuxSA and AUUG-SA". Naturally, someone else could
probably come up with a better title than me, but they are just
suggestions.

Brian Astil has kindly offered to contact the State Library to find out
how they would view this particular project, however you should send any
e-mails about it directly to me (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@rebel.net.au">lloy0076@rebel.net.au</A>) or to the
AUUG-SA Executive list (mailto:<A HREF="mailto:sa-exec@auug.org.au">sa-exec@auug.org.au</A>) because I don't want
to make him the "volunteer proejct coordinator" army style ;-P

Please consider thinking of ways you could help this project because it
would be of immense use to the South Australian community and an
excellent way for AUUG and LinuxSA to work well together.

David Lloyd
(AUUG-SA Secretary)
