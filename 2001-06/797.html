&gt; What's important to note however is that by mounting / as read-only,

Or you could put the read-only files onto a separate hard drive and set
the jumpers to make the drive hardware read-only.

If the machine has a static load (eg, a dedicated server) or you're not
too worried about speed, you can use the CDROM for this instead.

The mounts on the read/write media can be set to noexec, nodev, nosuid
to make life a little bit harder for anyone breaking in, but this is not
adequate in itself as root can remount.

&gt; Seems an aweful lot of stuffing around to edit '/etc/inetd.conf'. Changing
&gt; a password would also present a significant hassle using this method.

Security is always a hassle.

A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned backing up to a live filesystem to be
able to chroot into it and test changes without affecting the servers.

The same sort of thing can be used to create master images. Update the
configurations on the 'backup' machine, then make read-only copies to
put onto the main servers on a regular basis.

Using another machine is such a reliable and low stress method of testing
changes without causing disruptions, that one of my questions at job
interviews is "Will I have the budget to purchase spare machines?".

If the answer is "no", then I'm not really interested in working there
as this is a fair indication that the company treats its IT department
like crap.
