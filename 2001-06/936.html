David!

&gt; &gt;     I can see reasons why someone would want to have two
&gt; &gt; passwords on one account
&gt; 
&gt; I must admit that I can't.

I think he meant "can't"...let's give him the benefit of the doubt.

&gt; Is that right?  If it takes n time on average to search the keyspace for
&gt; a single key, and you have two independent keys, does it really take n/2
&gt; time to find either key?  That's one for the cryptographers amongst us,
&gt; but somehow it doesn't quite sound right to me.

I think it would be fair to say that it gives a cracker two times the
chance of grabbing the key if the cracker had the resources to crack the
key simultaneously. Naturally, if the cracker didn't, waiting 1000 years
(figure out of my head) to crack one key before cracking the next one
isn't really going to improve chances if you can only live to 72 years
on average.

But, back to the point, I have multiple passwords and one name. On my
local machines I would like any of my passwords to work for any of my
accounts. I'm thinking, now, that I should play with pam_ldap and an
ldap server :-)
