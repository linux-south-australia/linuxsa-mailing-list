Out of luck, in the case of the GPL licence.  See [1].

&gt; &gt; As long as the original license doesn't expire, the original licensees
&gt; &gt; would be able to make a choice between continuing under the terms of the
&gt; &gt; valid, legal, and non-expired original license, or revoking that license
&gt; &gt; and accepting the new (non-)distribution terms.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Each licensee would be able to make their own decision.
&gt;
&gt; I think I see a subtle difference between your and my opinion here.
&gt; Whereas I was saying that you can't revoke a licence, you seem to be
&gt; saying that you can. You also spell licence in the US fashion.
&gt; Is it maybe that US licenses can be revoked whereas Australian
&gt; and UK licences cannot?
&gt; Or is it more complex than that?
&gt; Or do you mean that the authors could get together and
&gt; decide to release _future_ distributions under a new licence?

It's not the authors, it's the licensees that can change which licence the 
licensee accepts on a product.  I can accept XYZ 1.0 under the GPL and then 
accept XYZ 2.0 under the Artistic licence if the author provides licences on 
different versions.

Indeed you can licence the same chunk of software under multiple licences, and 
the licensee can choose which one they would like to accept.  eg. Perl is 
licneced under both the Artistic Licence and the GPL.  Take your pick.

You as the author cannot revoke a licence once it has been accepted by someone 
(unless the licence says that), but you can withdraw software from distribution 
so that future users can't get a hold of it.  Of course if the licence permits 
it, existing licence holders could redistribute and the author couldn't stop 
them.

The other area of some confusion is GPL'd software and the provision of source 
code.  Once you GPL software, you either need to provide source with the 
(pre-built binary) software, or you need to provide a way for the person 
accepting the licence on the software to obtain the source code - even if that 
is 5 years later.  So the best bet is to include src with the binary so you 
won't be in violation of the licence you choose for your software :-)

Of course you need to equate this difficulty with the *benefit* that the GPL 
offers, that is, no-one can (legally) build upon your software without making 
their changes also available under the GPL and therefore available back to you.

[1] Of course I am no lawyer, so you will need to check these things out with 
someone suitably qualified.
