&gt; converted it appropriately. Thanks goes to Greg for his efforts in

&gt; 
&gt; This is still has a few holes the need patching up (in the form of

&gt; =========================================
&gt; 
&gt; Last update 30 June 2001
&gt; 
&gt; This is a regular posting to the LinuxSA mailing list. If you received
&gt; it in reply to a message you sent, it probably means the sender thinks
&gt; that at least one of the following things was wrong with your message:
&gt; 
&gt; - You left out a subject line, or the subject line was not appropriate.
&gt; - You formatted it in such a way that it was difficult to read.
&gt; - You asked more than one unrelated question in one message.
&gt; - You sent out a message with an incorrect date, time or time zone.
&gt; - You sent out the same message more than once.
&gt; - You sent an 'unsubscribe' message to LinuxSA.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have done more than one of these things, there is a good chance
&gt; that you will receive more than one copy of this message from different
&gt; people. Read on, and your next message will be more successful.

&gt; III: How to submit a question to LinuxSA
&gt; IV: How to follow up a question to LinuxSA
&gt; IV: How to answer a question to LinuxSA
&gt; 
&gt; I: Introduction
&gt; ===============
&gt; 
&gt; This is a regular posting aimed to help both those seeking advice from
&gt; LinuxSA (the "newcommers"), and also those who answer the questions (the
&gt; "hackers").
&gt; 
&gt; Note that the term hacker has nothing to do with breaking into
&gt; other people's computers.  The correct term for the latter
&gt; activity is "cracker", but the popular press hasn't found out
&gt; yet.  The LinuxSA hackers disapprove strongly of cracking 
&gt; security, and have nothing to do with it.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, there has been some friction which stems from the different
&gt; viewpoints of the two groups.  The newcommers accused the hackers of
&gt; being arrogant, stuck-up, and unhelpful, while the hackers accused the
&gt; newcommers of being stupid, unable to read plain English, and expecting
&gt; everything to be handed to them on a silver platter. Of course, there's
&gt; an element of truth in both of these claims, but for the most part these
&gt; viewpoints come from a sense of frustration.
&gt; 
&gt; In this document, I'd like to do something to relieve this frustration
&gt; and help everyone get better results from LinuxSA. In the following
&gt; section, I recommend how to submit a question; after that, we'll look at
&gt; how to answer one.
&gt; 
&gt; II: How to unsubscribe from LinuxSA
&gt; ===================================
&gt; 
&gt; When you subscribed to LinuxSA, you got a welcome message from
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au.">linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au.</A>  In this message, amongst other things,
&gt; it told you how to unsubscribe.  Here's a typical message:
&gt; 
&gt; FIXME: Find a subscription message and copy the appropriate bits
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally, unsubscribing from LinuxSA is a trivial task and takes only a
&gt; few seconds of your time. In fact, the process is so short and simple,
&gt; the instructions are included at the bottom of each message sent to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>:
&gt; 
&gt; To unsubscribe from the LinuxSA list:
&gt;  mail <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa-request@linuxsa.org.au</A> with "unsubscribe" as the
&gt;  subject
&gt; 
&gt; If SmartList replies and tells you (incorrectly) that you're not on the
&gt; list, this may mean one of two things:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. You have changed your mail ID since you subscribed.  That's
&gt; where keeping the original message from SmartList comes in
&gt; handy. For example, the sample message above shows my mail ID as
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx.">andrew@plug.cx.</A> Since then, I have changed it to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx.">andrew.reid@plug.cx.</A> Mail for <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx">andrew@plug.cx</A> gets shunted to
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>, so asking SmartList to remove
&gt; "<A HREF="mailto:andrew.reid@plug.cx">andrew.reid@plug.cx</A>" from the list is going to fail, seeing as
&gt; it is not subscribed. By changing your "From" address in my mail
&gt; client's configuration to " <A HREF="mailto:andrew@plug.cx">andrew@plug.cx</A>" and sending the
&gt; unsubscribe request again, you should be more successful.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. You're subscribed to a mailing list which is subscribed to
&gt; LinuxSA. If that's the case, you'll have to figure out which one
&gt; it is and get your name taken off that one. If you're not sure
&gt; which one it might be, check the headers of the messages you
&gt; receive from LinuxSA: maybe there's a clue there.
&gt; 
&gt; If you've done all this, and you still can't figure out what's going on,
&gt; send a message to <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@linuxsa.org.au">postmaster@linuxsa.org.au</A>, and he will sort things out
&gt; for you. Don't send a message to LinuxSA: they can't help you.
&gt; 
&gt; III: How to submit a question to LinuxSA
&gt; ========================================
&gt; 
&gt; When submitting a question to LinuxSA, consider the following points:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Remember that nobody gets paid for answering a Linux question.
&gt; They do it of their own free will. You can influence this free
&gt; will positively by submitting a well-formulated question
&gt; supplying as much relevant information as possible. You can
&gt; influence this free will negatively by submitting an incomplete,
&gt; illegible, or rude question. It's perfectly possible to send a
&gt; message to LinuxSA and not get an answer even if you follow
&gt; these rules. It's much more possible not to get an answer if you
&gt; don't. In the rest of this document, we'll look at how to get
&gt; the most out of your question to LinuxSA.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Not everybody who answers Linux questions reads every message:
&gt; they look at the subject line and decide whether it interests
&gt; them. Clearly, it's in your interest to specify a subject.
&gt; "Linux problem" or "Help" aren't enough. If you provide no
&gt; subject at all, many people won't bother reading it. If your
&gt; subject isn't specific enough, the people who can answer it may
&gt; not read it.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Format your message so that it is legible, and PLEASE DON'T
&gt; SHOUT!!!!!. We appreciate that a lot of people don't speak
&gt; English as their first language, and we try to make allowances
&gt; for that, but it is really painful to try and read a message
&gt; written full of typos or without line breaks. A lot of badly
&gt; formatted messages come from bad mailers of badly configured
&gt; mailers. The following mailers are known to send out badly
&gt; formatted messages without you finding out about them:
&gt; 
&gt; Eudora
&gt; exmh
&gt; Microsoft Exchange
&gt; Microsoft Internet Mail
&gt; Microsoft Outlook
&gt; Netscape
&gt; 
&gt; As you can see, the mailers in the Microsoft world are frequent
&gt; offenders. If at all possible, use a UNIX mailer. If you must
&gt; use a mailer under Microsoft environments, make sure its set up 
&gt; correctly. Correctly can be defined as:
&gt; 
&gt;  - Set to send in PLAIN TEXT and NOT HTML or RICH TEXT.
&gt;  - Set to wrap outgoing text at 72 characters.
&gt;  - Set NOT to use MIME: a lot of people use mailers which don't
&gt;    get on very well with MIME.
&gt; 
&gt; For further information on this subject, check out
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/email.html.">http://www.lemis.com/email.html.</A>
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Make sure your time and time zone are set correctly. This may
&gt; seem a little silly, since your message still gets there, but
&gt; many of the people who you are trying to reach get several
&gt; hundred messages a day. They frequently sort the incomming
&gt; messages by subject and date, and if your message doesn't come
&gt; before the first answer, they may assume they missed it and not
&gt; bother to look.
&gt; 
&gt;  5. Don't include unrelated questions in the same message. Firstly,
&gt; a long message tends to scare people off, and secondly, it's
&gt; more difficuly to get all the people who can answer all the
&gt; questions to read the message.
&gt; 
&gt;  6. Specify as much information as possible. This is a difficult 
&gt; area, and we need to expand on what information you need to
&gt; submit, but here's a start:
&gt; 
&gt;  If you get error messages, don't say "I get error messages",
&gt;  say (for example), "I get the error message 'No route to
&gt;  host'".
&gt; 
&gt;  If your system panics, don't say "My system panicked", say
&gt;  (for example) "My system panicked with the message "free vnode
&gt;  isn't".
&gt; 
&gt;  If you have difficulty installing Linux, please be sure to
&gt;  tell us the following things:
&gt; 
&gt;    - The distribution (ie, RedHat) and the version (ie, 7.1).
&gt;    - The hardware you have. In particular, it's important to
&gt;      know the IRQs and I/O addresses of the boards installed in
&gt;      your machine.
&gt; 
&gt;  If you have difficulty getting PPP to run, describe the
&gt;  configuration. Which version of PPP do you use? What kind of
&gt;  authentication do you have? Do you have a static or dynamic IP
&gt;  address? What kind of messages do you get in the log file?
&gt;  What is the version of the kernel you are running (the command
&gt;  'uname -a' (without the quotes) will give you that
&gt;  information.
&gt; 
&gt;  7. If you don't get an answer immediately, or if you don't even see
&gt; your own message appear on the list immediately, don't resend
&gt; the message. Wait at least 24 hours. The LinuxSA mailer takes a
&gt; little while to distribute the emails to the subscribees. Once
&gt; the message does get through, the person who might know the
&gt; answer may not be at his desk and not able to answer the email.
&gt; 
&gt;  8. If you do all this, and you still get no answer, there could be
&gt; other reasons. For example, the problem is so compilcated that
&gt; nobody knows the answer, or the person who does know the answer
&gt; is offline. If you don't get an answer after, say, a week, it
&gt; might help to resend the message. If you don't get an answer to
&gt; your second message, though, your're probably not going to get
&gt; one from this forum. Resending the same message again and again
&gt; will only make you unpopular.
&gt; 
&gt;  9. Keep your question on-topic. This is a Linux list, so don't go
&gt; asking people what breed of dog you should buy, what mobile
&gt; phone is best or where the cheapeset fuel is today. It's not
&gt; appropriate here. That said, if it can somehow be related to
&gt; Linux, it's probably going to be received well.
&gt; 
&gt; Examples of questions that aren't directly Linux-related but are
&gt; generally accepted as "OK" are:
&gt; 
&gt;  - "What hardware should I buy for my Linux machine?"
&gt;  - "Telstra have tried to screw us again, can they do that?"
&gt;  - "XYZ Unix Application isn't working. &lt;!-- Necessary details
&gt;    ommitted --&gt;. Can someone suggest a way to get it working?"
&gt;  - "Microsoft is saying evil things about the way the Linux
&gt;     world works. Do they have any factual basis for such
&gt;     comments?"
&gt; 
&gt; To summarize, let's assume you know the answer to the following question
&gt; (yes, it's the same on in each case :-). You choose which of these two
&gt; questions you would be more prepared to answer:
&gt; 
&gt; Message 1:
&gt; Subject: (none)
&gt; 
&gt; I just can't get hits damn silly Kinxu system to workd, amd Im really
&gt; good at tsis stuff, but i have never seen antyhing sho difficult to
&gt; intsll, it jsut wont owrk whateer I try so whty dont y9ou guts tell me
&gt; what i doing wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; Message 2:
&gt; Subject: Problems installing RedHat Linux 7.2
&gt; 
&gt; I've just got the RedHat Linux 7.2 CD-ROM from NetCraft, and I'm having
&gt; a lot of difficulty installing it. I have a 66 MHz 486 with 16MB of
&gt; memory and an Adaptec 1540A SCSI board, a 1.2GB Quantum Fireball disk
&gt; and a Toshiba 3501XA CD-ROM drive. The installation works just fine, but
&gt; when I try to reboot the system, I get the message "Missing Operating
&gt; System".
&gt; 
&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; IV: How to follow up a question to LinuxSA
&gt; ==========================================
&gt; 
&gt; Often you will want to send in additional information to a question you
&gt; have already sent. The best way to do this is to reply to your original
&gt; message. This has three advantages:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. You include the original message text, so people will know what
&gt; you're talking about. Don't forget to trim the unnecessary text
&gt; out though.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. The text in the subject line stays the same (you did remember to
&gt; put one in, didn't you?). Many mailers will sort messages by
&gt; subject. This helps group messages together.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. The message reference numbers in the header will refer to the
&gt; previous message. Some mailers, such as mutt, can thread
&gt; messages, showing the exact relationships between the messages.
&gt; 
&gt; V: How to answer a quetsion to LinuxSA
&gt; ======================================
&gt; 
&gt; Before you answer a question to LinuxSA, consider:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. A lot of the points on submitting questions also apply to
&gt; answering questions. Read them.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Has somebody already answered the question? The easiest way to
&gt; check this is to sort your incomming mail by subject: then
&gt; (hopefully) you'll see the question followed by any answers, all
&gt; together.
&gt; 
&gt; If somebody has already answered it, it doesn't automatically
&gt; mean that you shouldn't send another answer. But it makes sense
&gt; to read all the other answers first.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Do you have something to contribute beyond what has already
&gt; been said? In general, "Yeah, me too" answers don't help much,
&gt; although there are exceptions, like when somebody is describing
&gt; a problem he's having, and he doesn't know whether there's
&gt; something wrong with the hardware or software.  If you do send a
&gt; "me too" answer, you should also include any further relevant
&gt; information.
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Are you sure you understand the question? Very frequently, the
&gt; person who asks the question is confused and doesn't express
&gt; himself very well. Even with the best understanding of the
&gt; system, it's easy to send a reply which doesn't answer the
&gt; question. This doesn't help: you'll heave the person who
&gt; submitted the question more frustrated or confused than ever. If
&gt; nobody else answers, and your not too sure either, you can
&gt; always ask for more information.
&gt; 
&gt;  5. Are you sure you answer is correct? If not, wait a day or so. If
&gt; nobody else comes up with a better answer, you can still reply
&gt; and say, for example, "I don't know if this is correct, but
&gt; since nobody else has replied, why don't you try replacing your
&gt; ATAPI CD-ROM with a frog?".
&gt; 
&gt;  6. Unless there's a good reason to do otherwise, reply to the
&gt; sender and LinuxSA. Many people on the LinuxSA list are
&gt; "lurkers": they learn by reading messages sent and replied to by
&gt; others. If you take a message which is of general interest off
&gt; the list, you're depriving these people of their information. Be
&gt; careful with hundreds of CCs. If this is the case, be sure to
&gt; trim the Cc: lines appropriately.
&gt; 
&gt;  7. Include relevant text from the original message. Trim it to the
&gt; minimum, but don't overdo it. It should still be possible for
&gt; somebody who didn't read the original message to understand what
&gt; your're talking about.
&gt; 
&gt;  8. Use some technique to identify which text came from the original
&gt; message, and which text you add. I personally find that
&gt; prepending "&gt; " to the original message works best. Leaving
&gt; whitespace after the "&gt; " and leave empty lines between your
&gt; text and the original text both make the result more readable.
&gt; 
&gt;  9. Put your response in the correct place (after the text to which
&gt; it replies). It's very difficult to read a thread of responses
&gt; where each reply comes before the text to which it replies.
&gt; 
&gt;  10. Most mailers change the subject line on a reply by prepending a
&gt; text such as "Re: ". If you're mailer doesn't do it
&gt; automatically, you should do it manually.
&gt; 
&gt;  11. If the submitter didn't abide by formatting conventions (lines
&gt; too long, HTML/RTF, innapropriate subject line), please fix it.
&gt; In the case of an incorrect subject line (such as "HELP!!??"),
&gt; change the subject line to (say) "Re: Difficulties with sync PPP
&gt; (was: HELP!!??)". That way other people trying to follow the
&gt; thread will have less difficulty following it.
&gt; 
&gt; In such cases, it's appropriate to say what you did and why you
&gt; did it, but try not to be rude. If you find you can't answer
&gt; without being rude, don't answer.
&gt; 
&gt; If you just want to reply to a message because of its bad
&gt; format, just reply to the submitter, not to the list. You can
&gt; just send him this message in reply, if you like.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;---- Snip here.
&gt; 
&gt; Please let me know what you think. If there are no objections to the
&gt; principle in general, I'll set a deadline of Wednesday, 5 July 2001 for
&gt; submissions for changes.
&gt; 
&gt; As of Thursday, 6 July 2001, this email (in its current or modified
&gt; form) will be sent out on a monthly basis to <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A> by a
&gt; CRON job on one of my servers.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, rather than attaching this message (or its successors) to the
&gt; welcome message, I think a link to <A HREF="http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.txt">http://www.plug.cx/linuxsa.txt</A> would
&gt; be more fitting. People with differing opinions are encouraged to "put
&gt; their case forward".
