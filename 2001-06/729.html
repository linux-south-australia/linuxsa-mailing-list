&gt; &gt; And then I thought - now I'll just collapse this minix
&gt; &gt; file system that I've mounted and modified back into
&gt; &gt; a file. But... how on earth do you turn a minix file system
&gt; &gt; into a file?
&gt; 
&gt; Correct me if im missing something, but if you mount the file on a
&gt; loopback, and then write to it, dont you just unmount it, and your done?
&gt; 
&gt; Ant


Since I "knew" that that was impossible, I didn't even try it.
Now I've tried it. And for some explicable reason, it works!
Life is wierder than I thought.
Thanks for that.

Strangely, though, the "frozen" file system file still has the
same modification-date and size. 
I had thought that the files system was copied into RAM or something,
and only modified there. 
It seems now like all of the kernel buffering layer is
where the read/writing occurs, and that this must
actually be written through to the real file, just like a
normal file system.

Now I can stick the new module onto a modules-disk for the
boot disk to read in.

On a related topic, do you happen to know how to _create_ a
minix file system as a file?
I can see how to use mkfs.minix to create a minix file
system in a disk partition and then copy it to a file with "dd".

I've created iso9660 file systems as files before, of course,
for CD writing. But there seems to be a paucity of tools for
_creating_ file systems - in the SuSE distributions at least.

I guess I could make copies of existing minix file-system files,
and just clear them out and put my own files in.
But that's very clumsy indeed.
And I don't really want to re-partition a hard disk every time
I want to create a minix file-system file.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
