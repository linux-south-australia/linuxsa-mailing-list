&gt; I have had my say on this list before on stuff like this, needless to
&gt; say I'm
&gt; in agreement with you Andrew. Some people on this list think it's ok to be
&gt; rude, personally I think they need help.  I sort of cringe when after the
&gt; install-fest comes and goes, there is usually a posting about welcoming the
&gt; 'new linux users'. What we should do is 'warn' new list members about the
&gt; 'politically correct' zealots and hope we don't lose too many :-)

I think the person in question has NOT been at all rude, just blunt.
That's him. Deal with it.

Secondly, these people ARE getting help. Pegasus' question was answered
and everything seemed happy. Why the big fuss? Don't know. Apparently
Andrew Pullin has taken offense to something that David Lloyd said to
Pegasus which Pegasus isn't offended by. Hmmm...

&gt; This is supposed to be a list for all, unfortunately some people, for reasons
&gt; unfathomable can't help making new members feel,  emm...-uncomfortable?

To quote a David Lloyd's most recent post on the topic:

"I can actually clear up misunderstandings with people, well, apparently
at least until now."

Which says to me:

"It's all been running quite OK until one individual decided that it
wasn't"

To be completely blunt, Andrew (Pullin), you've taken the whole issue
way out of proportion. The newbies that David is apparently scaring away
by the thousand seem to be comming back. If David has offended them,
David's got the skills (and nouse) to patch it up. If said newbie posts
to the list in disgust, I'm sure there'll be plenty of people (me
included) explaining to them that they took it the wrong way and to sit
back down.

&gt; Nice to see you working to make things better too :-)

Better? That's really quite interesting. I'd have said that we've just
wasted a tone of bandwidth unecessarily. 

You can get stuffed if you try to tell me that "We shouldn't have
replied", as the original post was fairly close to an "attack" on
David's personality. 

You don't just sit back and be quiet when that sort of thing happens.
You let them know they're wrong.
