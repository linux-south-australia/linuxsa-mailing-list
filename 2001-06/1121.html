David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:lloy0076@rebel.net.au">lloy0076@rebel.net.au</A>&gt; trumpted:
&gt; Crap. I was the one who wrote the mail. If you don't have the guts to
&gt; mention my name, that's fine. I've mentioned my name. You were
&gt; targetting me.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I make myself VERY clear?

Perhaps we should view Andrew's comments as something that was triggered
by a long running sequence of events that merely happened to culiminate
in David's satirical flambe.  It shouldn't be taken personally by anyone,
because it was meant, in general, to almost all of us.  (Except me.)

He's right, without any real argument, that abusing an absolute newbie
for breach of etiquette is not useful, excepting perhaps when the newbie
has been an obvious dweeb, or willfully lazy, or some other such flaying
offense.  Making a maiden post in HTML certainly shows a total lack
of understanding of our culture, but is it deserving of harsh words?
Probably not.

Of course there is an argument that goes: Unix is not a cuddly
environment, a fact which goes to the core of our culture.  Anybody who
can't handle this harsh, reality of the world has no business using Unix,
and a quick roasting is the best way to quickly separate the wheat from
the boys.  Hmmm.  Nah.
