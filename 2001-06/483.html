:&gt; &gt; I have installed all the bits and pieces from the RedHat CD's and I

Until they are needed and then they are either out of date or broken (because in frustration about some "obscure app" conflicting in library requirements ... you went .. --force) :) (of course &lt;emphasis&gt;I&lt;/emphasis&gt;would never do that.. well almost never..)
:&gt; 
:&gt; Yes, it can be handy. But that's not the point, IMHO.
:&gt; 
:&gt; One of the reasons that I started with UNIX was that it wasn't full of
:&gt; useless bloat. A default install of RedHat these days is huge. Most people
:&gt; aren't going to use the majority of the stuff that RedHat

One of the reasons that I started with UNIX was that it wasn't full of useless bloat. 
Debian have found a gracefull and flexible balance through a few simple rules.

The awesome Redhat install process (even when you choose packages) installs things you didn't ask for (though invariably do need).Using Debian with the same End User apps  I have used much less than 25% of a beat up old 6gig hard drive.  (given I have given most of Gnome the big heave) the "same" configuration on Redhat was easily twice this size. I also have fewer problems with fonts and boot-up configuration.
 Last but by no means least this system is almost intuitive to configure and use, more secure,quicker, even MORE stable and, perhaps strangly, &lt;i&gt; feels &lt;/i&gt; it. (probably the Kernel / xserver versions).
 In short I am a happy little vegemite.
:&gt; 
:&gt; RedHat's PPP configurator is nice (albeit temperamental), and the new
:&gt; Printconf system is great -- just huge.
Both excellent tools. Though as I become more/less proficient on the command line I try to aviod such things and have become wary of where they write stuff.

:&gt; 
:&gt; I don't like RedHat's bloat. That's why I choose not to use it anymore. If I
:&gt; need some software, I grab it from a server or download it.

Once set up and Databased it is stunning how quickly this can be done on Debian (at least) and easily kept up to date (without all that broken redcarpet helix stuff.)
