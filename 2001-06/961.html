Hi All,
    I notice in my last batch of mail from this list that
another newbie has posted in HTML, and once again someone
has flamed him for it. I am getting a little tired of this
happening as it doesn't really go with the spirit of this
list. If I was a newbie and posted an innocent request on a
help list, and being a newbie and not knowing any better
posted in HTML, and then instead of getting help, received a
rather venomous flame that didn't even address the problem,
I would think basically "what a pack of arrogant arseholes,
maybe I won't bother with this Linux thing". We are trying
to encourage new users to join Linux, not scare them away.
Here is a possible solution to this ongoing problem that I
hope the list will accept in the spirit it was intended.

    For newbies:

        A newbie, being new, CANNOT know the rules of this
list, unless they are told. Some newbies post a day or two
after their first meeting or an installfest, and some just
follow links to the LinuxSA page and join, usually they just
don't know because nobody told them. Also bear in mind that
most of them are still configuring a dual boot configuration
and the windoze part works, but the Linux bit doesn't. This
probably means using outlook express as a mailer which
defaults to HTML mail. If you want to change uncle Bill's
mind into turning off this unpleasant feature go right
ahead, but you won't get anywhere. So this means that
something must be done from the list side of things to fix
our problem. Here goes:
    It has been a long time since I subscribed, but if it
isn't already done, when the message saying you are
subscribed to the list is sent to you it should contain a
brief run down of the rules (it may do this already, but as
I said, it has been a while).
    Also, why can't the list filter out HTML messages before
they are distributed and post it back to the poster saying
this is HTML mail and will not be posted unless it is plain
text. If this is done in a polite way, most newbies will
swear a bit and fix the problem and all will then be fine.
We are smart people here so this shouldn't be too hard to
fix, and if it isn't straight forward then - "use the
source" and "scratch that itch".

    For experienced users:

        You have no excuses what so ever. You know what you
are doing already, so if it bothers you so much to receive
HTML mail - FILTER IT OUT. In the time it has taken me to
write this post, I would guess that it would be a similar
time that some people take to write flames to newbies. This
is also the amount of time it would have taken you to apply
the filter to your favourite Linux mailer. There are some
very experienced people on this list who also don't like
HTML mail and they have already applied the filter, or just
plain don't answer it.

    In the interests of HELPING people, which this list is
all about, why not do what I do when I answer an HTML post
and politely point out the fact, and then answer the
question. It isn't very hard guys (and girls).

    One last thing, many people "lurk" around this list
without actually posting and fix their problems from what
others post. If you don't know how to filter from your
preferred mailer (then RTFM dummy), why not post a message
asking some more experienced person how to do it? That way
the lurkers may fix your problems because the penny drops
"why does he want to filter HTML mail?". Also other lists
regularly post the Rules of the list monthly so lurkers can
read them before they post. These are all simple suggestions
so maybe we can act like a community we are and look after
the new members and not scare them away.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
