Hi All,
    I have a copy of "Sys Admin" magazine at home, and in
the July 1998 edition they had an article on 10 steps to
becoming a Unix Administrator. In it they quoted these job
descriptions:

    <A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/sage/jobs/jobs-descriptions.html">http://www.usenix.org/sage/jobs/jobs-descriptions.html</A>

In addition, they suggested the following:
1. Learn Unix basics
    At least 80 basic commands, the file system and where
things are and basic interface customisation. Learn
vi/emacs. A 40 hour intro to unix course covers this.

2. Go beyond the Basics
    Learn more basic commands (inc df, more and rm). Learn
bash and ksh and how to customise them. Know boot and
shutdown procedures, backup and restore and basic sys admin
tools. A 40 hour intermediate unix course covers this.

3.Learn shell and shell language programming
    Learn how to write shell scripts. More commands (awk,
sed, ed cat and grep)

4. Become one with your Unix System
    Install and configure a system from scratch. Make and
mount file systems. Use cron to execute program or shell
scripts. Permissions. Daemons.

5. Learn DNS and BIND

6. Become a Mail Master
    Configure a Modem Dial Out. Learn Sendmail, mail and
UUCP.

7. Learn Networking
    TCP/IP Layers and OSI model. telnet and ftp, and SNMP
SNTP. Learn about Routers and Bridges and subnet masking.

8. Learn NFS and NIS

9. System Tuning and Accounting
    Learn about System performance tuning and how to change
and rebuild the kernel. Learn the accounting packages that
come with Unix.

10. C the Light
    Learn C. Learn make. Port programs between Unix systems.

O.K., now this is a fairly extensive list, and I haven't
listed everything, however you may get some more info from:

    <A HREF="http://www.samag.com">http://www.samag.com</A>

    This is what the industry expects a Unix Sysadmin to
know, and funly enough the average Linux user would be well
advanced in many of these areas already. I hope this has
helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; Hmmmm
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am having trouble linking sysadmin with 120 hours. The
ability to find out
&gt; &gt; information and to think carefully before hitting enter
is more
&gt; &gt; important than if they know the difference between
commands, etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As far as console skills, this should do: man [-k]
&gt;
&gt; I think the original poster wants to develop a set of
questions that
&gt; will determine whether a person would be a good systems
administrator,
&gt; and that part of this is questions on using bash. I don't
see anything
&gt; particularly wrong with this approach as many
universities/other
&gt; learning institutions do this anyway (it's called
curriculum).
&gt;
&gt; A good test, in my opinion, would be to ask someone to
understand what
&gt; one of the more complex scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d/
under a sysvinit
&gt; style sytem. You'd get someone more proficient at making
questions to
&gt; test for understanding than me to actually test whether
the knowledge
&gt; exists.
