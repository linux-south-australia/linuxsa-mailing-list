Pegasus, if my memory server me correctly, was the horse that flies.
Note the word FLY. Not the horse that could write CrapLook MicroCRAP
Encoded HTML. I will NOT accept any further HTML e-mails unless you can
make one or more of my machines FLY. And that is like a PLANE, not go
fast. I don't care how fast my machines fly - I want to see you make
them levitate off the ground and go to Africa...
&lt;/bitch&gt;

Seriously, though, a normal B.(something to do with computers) degree
should be enough to get you a job at the moment. If you're looking for
something that is Linux specific that is also auspiced under something
like a University or TAFE, I'm not sure. What I am certain of, though,
is that such courses will (eventually) appear.

In my opinion, employers should look at what you can DO and how you
LEARN, not at what confounded currciculum you know. For example, I could
employ someone who has a B.SC(Comp Science) from a University that does
not have SA or Adelaide in its name and it would be highly unlikely they
knew much more than how to login at a command prompt and run a C
compiler.

But they'll still get the graduate salary despite the fact they know
sweet deodorants about what they're doing.

More important, in my NOT humble opinion, to know how to learn from
manuals and from others. In the real world you DO ask others with
expertise how to do things, but you need to know when it is appropriate
to and when it is more appropriate to search the manuals/docs yourself. 

Nonetheless, there are a few training options out there and you probably
should choose the one you think you'll learn the most from. It may not
pay in the short term but I'm sure if you work your cards right (so to
speak), it will in the long term.
