&gt; I've got an ADSL account, but not with Telstra (Internode, in fact - you
&gt; may have heard of them.) Internode have a 500Mb/month limit.

Something which seemed to get drowned out in all the interesting followups
to this message is the basic fact: I'm a free OS user and I find 500Mb
ample to keep my existing systems running and do most of the work I need
at very reasonable cost. Some of the suggested improvements to the billing
scheme will make a good thing better if they happen.

My running needs for bulk data are nearly all free code or binaries from
large public archives, and then comes email and web. (Office VPN-type
access is something I can't measure yet.) 500Mb has been enough for me to
do quite a lot of Debian, Mandrake, Connectiva and FreeBSD updates on
existing systems as I construct a new mini-network, plus get some large
collections of unpackaged sources. 

As well as my running needs I have some bulk project start-up needs, which
is what this posting was originally about. These needs can't be met
without paying a fair bit of money, since they run into hundreds of Mb a
time. Now that ISP people from multiple companies have educated me about
things like Telstra double-dipping on the ADSL tail I can see that it
isn't reasonable for me to expect these sart-up needs met solely via
convential access over ADSL. However with some CD ROMs, rsync and some
careful thought I hope to be able to do something there.
