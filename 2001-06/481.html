&gt; I wasn't refering to dialup access servers, or ADSL DSLAMs, but the
&gt; routers that connect such devices to the rest of the Internet. It makes
&gt; a network easier to control if you can have a border router distinct to
&gt; the edge router you connect customers to. In the case of Telstra's ADSL
&gt; system, you're paying for them to manage the edge, and then again for an
&gt; ATM concentrator at the ISP end, and then possibly again for the router
&gt; that connects said ISP to the Internet.

Not all small/backyard ISPs have their primary (and often only) upstream 
connection running into a router. Running it into the back of a UNIX box and 
routing all traffic from the dialup access servers through it seems quite 
common.

Obviously the bigger you get, the more you start wondering "Should I use a 
router?". But even still, you'd not want to put all your upstream 
connections on the one router. You'd look pretty silly when the router's 
powersupply fried and left you with no Internet connection :-)

&gt; Just because a router has a 100Mb interface, that doesn't mean it can
&gt; route 100Mb/s of data. The 2600 and 3600 routers that are within reach
&gt; of most average ISP's can only push around 10Mb/s of bytes around at a
&gt; time, which is more than adequate in a non-broadband environment.

Indeed. But again, for the small/backyard ISPs, even a 2600 is not worth the 
effort. Assuming they only have 1 or 2 upstream connections, there are more 
economical (and sensible) ways of doing it.

&gt; ADSL also attracts game players, who require approximately 6x more
&gt; packets/sec in throughput than regular downloaders. Routers are built to
&gt; move a certain number of packets in a certain amount of time while
&gt; performing a certain number of operations on them, rather than for a
&gt; specific bandwidth throughput.

One of the things I love about running the Internet connection right into 
the firewall is the fact that they're a hell of a lot easier and cheaper to 
upgrade. If my 3600 is being slow and needs more memory it becomes an 
expensive exercise. With a PC, you can pickup 128MB RAM for ~$50.

It's not always ideal, however. You can make quite decent routers out of 
Free UNIX machines. With multiple interface NICs[1] you could achieve a 
completely unreasonable amount of upstream connections :-)

[1] I've heard that there have been some reliability issues with the cheap-o 
D-Link multiple interface cards. I believe Sun make a quad-interface card 
(qfe?) which holds a better reputation (and is apparently supported by 
Linux).
