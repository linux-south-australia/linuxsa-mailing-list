&gt;  &gt; what do you all think?
&gt; 
&gt; As long as the original license doesn't expire, the original licensees
&gt; would be able to make a choice between continuing under the terms of the
&gt; valid, legal, and non-expired original license, or revoking that license
&gt; and accepting the new (non-)distribution terms.
&gt; 
&gt; Each licensee would be able to make their own decision.


Mark,

I think I see a subtle difference between your and my opinion here.
Whereas I was saying that you can't revoke a licence, you seem to be
saying that you can. You also spell licence in the US fashion.
Is it maybe that US licenses can be revoked whereas Australian
and UK licences cannot?
Or is it more complex than that?
Or do you mean that the authors could get together and
decide to release _future_ distributions under a new licence?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
