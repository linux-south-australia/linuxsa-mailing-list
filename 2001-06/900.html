I'm no expert by far so please double check what I say.

having said that I've just finished setting up a raid 5 array using linux 
software raid. correct me if I'm wrong but raid 1 is mirroring right? the 
reason for the super block problem is as anthony said, they weren't synced 
correctly when the array went down. now assuming you are using the software 
raid that is in the 2.4 kernel (or a patched 2.2 with the same raid 
versions) you could try a mkraid /dev/md0 to resync the superblocks but this 
can be VERY DANGEROUS unless the raidtab exactly represents the array you 
are using. Even still, it's not guaranteed to work A possibly safer but more 
expensive and time consuming method would be to completely replace one of 
the drives with a new one. this would possibly cause the machine to start a 
resync of the two drives.

These are just some ideas but would need to be confirmed by someone with 
more experience.

&gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity, what sort of raid was it? We got hit by the
&gt;same
&gt; &gt; thing here (you must be in the same area!), and we had 2 servers that
&gt; &gt; hadn't come up this morning, but an e2fsk and a few mins and all was
&gt; &gt; sweet (mylex hardware raid dac960 and accelraid 352). The array was OK,
&gt; &gt; but there was minor damage to the superblock due to not being syncd
&gt; &gt; and/or unmounted properly. Also please not that I dont mean to imply
&gt; &gt; that your raid array is dead!
&gt;
&gt;Software RAID. I didn't set this one up, but I've got to fix it :-( I
&gt;certainly hope that my RAID array isn't dead. There's going to be a lot
&gt;of unhappy people, otherwise.
&gt;
&gt;I think I'll just stare at my shoes until I think the world's gone away
