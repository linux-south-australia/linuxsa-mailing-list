&gt;     I notice in my last batch of mail from this list that
&gt; another newbie has posted in HTML, and once again someone
&gt; has flamed him for it. I am getting a little tired of this
&gt; happening as it doesn't really go with the spirit of this
&gt; list. If I was a newbie and posted an innocent request on a
&gt; help list, and being a newbie and not knowing any better
&gt; posted in HTML, and then instead of getting help, received a
&gt; rather venomous flame that didn't even address the problem,
&gt; I would think basically "what a pack of arrogant arseholes,
&gt; maybe I won't bother with this Linux thing". We are trying
&gt; to encourage new users to join Linux, not scare them away.
&gt; Here is a possible solution to this ongoing problem that I
&gt; hope the list will accept in the spirit it was intended.

People aren't flaming. There's generally nothing in the comments made by
the people I think you're refering to. There's no use beating around the
bush. "This is the way it is, mate. Deal with it."

&gt;         A newbie, being new, CANNOT know the rules of this
&gt; list, unless they are told. Some newbies post a day or two
&gt; after their first meeting or an installfest, and some just
&gt; follow links to the LinuxSA page and join, usually they just
&gt; don't know because nobody told them. Also bear in mind that
&gt; most of them are still configuring a dual boot configuration
&gt; and the windoze part works, but the Linux bit doesn't. This
&gt; probably means using outlook express as a mailer which
&gt; defaults to HTML mail. If you want to change uncle Bill's
&gt; mind into turning off this unpleasant feature go right
&gt; ahead, but you won't get anywhere. So this means that
&gt; something must be done from the list side of things to fix
&gt; our problem. Here goes:

Outlook Express, as you said doesn't send messages in plain text by
default. It uses it's own wierd incarnation of HTML which -does not-
display in many mail clients.

These people need to be informed that the use of HTML mail isn't
appreciated around here. Perhaps it would be good if we had some sort of
regular mailings regarding 'Mailing List Etiquette' as FreeBSD Questions
has, thanks to Greg Lehey (<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/questions.html">http://www.lemis.com/questions.html</A>).

&gt;     It has been a long time since I subscribed, but if it
&gt; isn't already done, when the message saying you are
&gt; subscribed to the list is sent to you it should contain a
&gt; brief run down of the rules (it may do this already, but as
&gt; I said, it has been a while).

Good suggestion. Perhaps you'd write something down and put it on the
web for us to look at?

&gt;     Also, why can't the list filter out HTML messages before
&gt; they are distributed and post it back to the poster saying
&gt; this is HTML mail and will not be posted unless it is plain
&gt; text. If this is done in a polite way, most newbies will
&gt; swear a bit and fix the problem and all will then be fine.
&gt; We are smart people here so this shouldn't be too hard to
&gt; fix, and if it isn't straight forward then - "use the
&gt; source" and "scratch that itch".

The mailing list could filter out HTML messages, I'm sure. Why not just
teach those who send it not to. At least the current way of informing
people that HTML mail isn't appreciated here (David Lloyd :-) generally
gets their question answered. Having an automatic filter wont.

&gt;         You have no excuses what so ever. You know what you
&gt; are doing already, so if it bothers you so much to receive
&gt; HTML mail - FILTER IT OUT. In the time it has taken me to
&gt; write this post, I would guess that it would be a similar
&gt; time that some people take to write flames to newbies. This
&gt; is also the amount of time it would have taken you to apply
&gt; the filter to your favourite Linux mailer. There are some
&gt; very experienced people on this list who also don't like
&gt; HTML mail and they have already applied the filter, or just
&gt; plain don't answer it.

Their not flames as far as I'm concerned. If you want to take the "If
you don't like, delete it" approach, why can't you just delete these
so-called "flames" which you find so offensive.

It'd take me about 30 seconds to setup my mailer to filter out HTML
mail. Then, all those people who -don't- know the 'rules' can have their
questions left there. These "newbies" might get frustrated and say
"Stuff this, I'm using Windows".

No Thankyou! Our world has enough of the Windows-using type. If we've
got the chance to encourage others to use Free UNIX (or more
specifically Linux) why not take it. I like the current filtering
process, people get the message and [generally] get their question
answered.

&gt;     In the interests of HELPING people, which this list is
&gt; all about, why not do what I do when I answer an HTML post
&gt; and politely point out the fact, and then answer the
&gt; question. It isn't very hard guys (and girls).

"Politely" is a word that means different things to different people.
Yes, some people are more blunt about it than others, but that's just
them. Live with it. If you can't, well...

&gt;     One last thing, many people "lurk" around this list
&gt; without actually posting and fix their problems from what
&gt; others post. If you don't know how to filter from your
&gt; preferred mailer (then RTFM dummy), why not post a message
&gt; asking some more experienced person how to do it? That way
&gt; the lurkers may fix your problems because the penny drops
&gt; "why does he want to filter HTML mail?". Also other lists
&gt; regularly post the Rules of the list monthly so lurkers can
&gt; read them before they post. These are all simple suggestions
&gt; so maybe we can act like a community we are and look after
&gt; the new members and not scare them away.

I agree with the suggestion of having some ground rules or suggestions
(as per FreeBSD Questions example), but I think you're being grosly
unfar to certain individuals who you feel flamed newbies. I think you're
wrong. Period.
