Hi,

In was in MIMP today getting some more Aviator 24 cards and so forth, and I
made the mistake of casually remarking that I have heard that some Telcos
are offering Ethernet over fiber ...

There ensued a confusing discussion where the two people behind the counter
trotted out some rules of thumb (Ethernet will only give you 80% of its
stated bandwidth) and a statement that some ISP was trying to use Ethernet
over Fiber and was only getting 3 or so Mb/s. They mumbled about repeater
latency, etc ...

It seemed that there might be something to what they were saying, so I
thought some more about it, and got out some scrap paper, and came up with
an explanation.

Assuming TCP, and given that some Windows clients (NT SP1 at least, and
maybe more) use a window size of 8192 bytes or thereabouts, and there are
often a lot of ethernet hops, they could be right. Eg,


[Node]----[Hub]----[Router]----[Enet to fiber]---[router]---[hub]---[Node]
                                link frm telco

If this were 10MB/s Ethernet, we have 6 hops over Ethernet plus the fiber
link from end-to-end, for a min of at least 8mS end to end latency and a
round-trip-time of at least 12mS (ack's can be smaller).

But, a window of 8192 bytes will take about 6.6mS to fill up, after which
we have to wait for ACKs to come back before we can send any more. Thus we
waste almost 50% of the available throughput, and can only achieve about
5Mb/s. If the latency is any worse, then the throughput for any TCP
connection going over the link above would be worse as well. Simple
solution is to increase the window size. Linux uses a window of 32k, and we
could go up to 64k without using the window scale option. 100Mb/s operation
makes it worse. (We can use the delay-bandwidth product to estimate the
minimum window size we need.)

Of course, the link could still be kept full, if you had multiple
communicating parties between the two sides of the fiber link, this
discussion is limited to what two communicating parties on either side of
the link could achieve.

So, on to some questions:

1. Does this sound reasonable.

2. What are the latencies of hubs and switches (in store-and-forward mode)
and routers. Experience suggest that Cisco 3600s add very little, and that
switch latency should be lower than link latency.

3. On the surface, NetBEUI might seem to escape this problem, using LLC as
it does, with it's MOD 128 sequence numbers. However, since NetBEUI is
mostly used for file accesses, and many current Windows clients copy/access
files in chunks of 2920 (Win9X) or 4096 (WinNT) bytes, they would seem to
be actually worse. Does that make sense?
