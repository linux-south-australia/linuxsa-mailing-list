I presume you have 32bit transfers and DMA enabled on both interfaces?
I hope you were using the bs option to dd to transfer with, say, 64kb blocks
instead of a byte at a time?

&gt; Hi
&gt;
&gt; I have an old Pentium 166mhz with 64mb ram in which I am performing a
&gt; dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdc  between 2 x 30gb IDE hard drives. This is
&gt; being done while in multiuser mode, I suspect that there would also
&gt; be a small amount of network activity, e-mails coming and going would
&gt; be about the limit though.
&gt;
&gt; It's been slugging away now for at least three hours, this seems a
&gt; bit long, but on the other hand being ide and only a P166 it could be
&gt; on track, I am not sure. There is nothing in any log files to
&gt; indicate and problems.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone think there is a problem and that I should kill it and
&gt; redo this is single user mode ?
&gt;
&gt; I have looked at the man pages for verbose output, but there doesn't
&gt; seem to be an option for it. Am I overlooking it or is there another
&gt; way ?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; Wayne
