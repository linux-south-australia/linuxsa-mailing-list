I've not noticed a long running sequence of events. I've noticed that
you're consistent in asking people not to post HTML to the list. I can't
see ANYTHING wrong with the way you've conducted yourself.

Whatsmore, I think it's got nothing to do with a long sequence of events
at all. It's more specifically one of the most recent newbie posts to
the list.

&gt; Hang on a moment. I did not abuse the newbie. I pointed out that I
&gt; wouldn't read any further HTML e-mail from him unless he could make my
&gt; computer levitate and fly all the way to Africa. Personally I don't
&gt; think that's too much to ask. The choices are stark:

Abuse of the newbie would have looked very different. I can't see how
anyone could class what you wrote as "abuse".

&gt; 1) Cause my computer to levitate (using some means) and send it to
&gt; Africa
&gt;  - very difficult
&gt;  - probably impossible
&gt;  - not really a wonderful choice

"Pegasus" has obviously got the point from the rather vivid picture that
you painted. That's the desired outcome for all of us, right?

&gt; 2) Determine how to send e-mail in plain text
&gt;  - extremely easy

Which he did. He was still on the list to participate in this thread.
Your message mustn't have been too terrible for him to deal with.

&gt; Incidentally, that's exactly what happened. It appears that the new user
&gt; also appreciated the comments beginning with seriously. I will continue
&gt; to argue that a marked up &lt;bitch mode="on"&gt;&lt;/bitch&gt; block, followed by a
&gt; paragraph starting with "seriously" made it so obvious that I wasn't
&gt; flaming anyone at all that you'd have to be blind to fail to understand
&gt; it with one or two re-reads at most.

Exactly! When are other people around here going to realise that?
Whatsmore, you addressed the problem. What's to complain about?

&gt; Do I ever use harsh words...unfortunately it's been all of our
&gt; experiences that politely saying "no" doesn't work (trust me, they keep
&gt; on reoffending). Also, throwing them into the effective life
&gt; imprisonment (i.e. automatically ignoring them or dumping html email)
&gt; doesn't, in my opinion work either.

Using a rather extreme example means that they get the point. Sarcasm is
good at that.

&gt; Let's put it this way. If you were to run into a bank in Australia, push
&gt; into the queue and hold up the teller (because that's what you do in the
&gt; culture that you came from), noone is going to treat you with kid
&gt; gloves.

Agreed.

&gt; Might I remind people that JavaScript and other idiotic things bundled
&gt; in Microsoft Outlooks crappy TFNET MIME encoded tripe has generally been
&gt; responsible for a significant amount of Exchange servers simply falling
&gt; over.

Not to mention the completely evil things that Outlook does with
distributing mail through the addressbook. Why on earth would you want
to use Microsoft mail clients, though?

&gt; In ancient Egyptian mythology there were generally two types of
&gt; Gods/Goddesses. One type would say, "You did that wrong. I suggest you
&gt; do it this way the next time. I forgive you." The other type would say,
&gt; after hitting you over the head with a great stick, "You stuffed up. I
&gt; expected better. This is what I expect. Do it right next time. Oh, and I
&gt; forgive you.".
&gt; 
&gt; I prefer the latter approach.

Which is what it all boils down to. Some prefer the "softly, softly"
approach whereas you prefer to be a tad more blunt. I'd be inclined to
say that being blunt and up-front about it is more effective, too.

&gt; Both get there in the end; the latter tends to be more spectacular.

No one's asking the rest of the list to adopt your methods. It's not
unreasonable to want to do things "your way".
