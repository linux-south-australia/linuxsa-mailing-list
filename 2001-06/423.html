<H1>What is FreeBSD/Darwin?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I have been doing some reading about Apple's Darwin project and the free
software angle to that. There's lots I don't understand and can't easily
investigate (we have a MacOS X machine but not under my fingers.) Maybe
there's some experts here who can help me. www.darwinfo.org is a good
resource.

Darwin has a heavily-modified Mach kernel that knows about the boot-time
hardware specifics and memory management microkernel design. Mach talks to
a (rather old) FreeBSD 3.2 kernel, which handles processes and just about
everything else except for drivers. Drivers are handled by something
called IOKit, which sounds extremely NeXT-like to me from what I remember
of them. I suspect that FreeBSD drivers would have to be wrapped in a C++
layer to work with IOKit.

All of the above runs on PowerPC Macs, and is being ported to Intel but
not by Apple.  MacOS X consists of all of the above, with a big GUI put on
top of everything else.

I think if I knew the answers to the following questions I would
understand what is going on a bit better:

  - would it be possible to replace the Mach kernel with a PPC FreeBSD VM
    and bootloader code, and have everything else work perfectly including
    the MacOS X binaries on top? (I know that there isn't a PPC port
    of FreeBSD. But you see what I mean.)

  - Is it true that MacOS X knows the details of how IOKit works?

  - How hard is it to unport an IOKit driver? There must be an hfs
    driver, for example - does this mean that FreeBSD has now got
    an Apple-developed hfs driver?

  - I can't see that this is a true microkernel design, the way that
    Mach works (and Hurd might work one day.) Am I wrong, and in fact
    multiple OSs or multiple instances of FreeBSD can be loaded and
    run by the Mach core? Is this how the MacOS classic
    environment is done? (Interestingly, Windows NT started off with
    lofty goals of being very Mach-like. That soon wore off :-)

Puzzled and confused,
