The third Australian Open Source Symposium
------------------------------------------

The third Australian Open Source Symposium (AOSS 3) will be held in
Canberra on Saturday, 16 June 2001.  The purpose of this event is to
bring together the Australian Open Source community on an annual
basis.

AOSS is run by developers, for developers, but other members of the IT
community are welcome and will benefit from the ``hands-on''
atmosphere.  Our goals are to promote the sharing of information and
experience, to give the community a place to interact, and to nurture
and harness synergies between Open Source projects.

Just as Open Source is a little different, so is AOSS.  The majority
of the presenters are actively involved in Open Source development.
With few exceptions, they talk about work that they have done, or work
which is currently in progress.

Registration forms are available on the web at
<A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au/aoss/.">http://www.auug.org.au/aoss/.</A>  Please print them out and fax them to
AUUG at (02) 8824 9522.  Alternatively email the AUUG Business manager
at <A HREF="mailto:busmgr@auug.org.au">busmgr@auug.org.au</A>, or call AUUG at 1800 625 655.  Registration
will also be possible from 8:30 am on the day, but to ensure your
place at this event, we recommend that you register as soon as
possible.

Previous AOSS events were resounding successes.  We expect this one to
be even better.

Preliminary programme

8:30 - 9:00	Registration

9:00 - 9:30     Welcome and Introduction.

9:30 - 10:00    Through the looking glass: open source, Microsoft, Sun
                and public perceptions.

                Robert Hart, RedHat

10:00 - 10:30   Linux Standards Base 1.0
		Chris Yeoh, IBM LTC Ozlabs

10:30 - 11:00   Morning Tea

11:00 - 12:30   Hacking the Tivo.

		Andrew Tridgell, VA Linux.

		The Tivo is a Linux-based video recorder.  Tridge
		bought one last year, and he and his friends spent
		some months adapting it to Australian conditions.
		This masterpiece of hackery includes an Ethernet
		adaptor.

12:30 - 13:15   Lunch

13:15 - 13:45   Making Closed Source UNIX Open Again
		Warren Toomey, ANU

		This paper describes the work done to free old
		versions of UNIX from their closed source licenses,
		and examines the construction of the Apout simulator
		which can be used to run old UNIX executables.

13:45 - 14:15   J2WAP

		Scott Campbell

		J2WAP is a Wireless Markup Language (WML) micro
		browser which adheres to version 1.2 of the WAP Forums
		Wireless Markup Language (WML) and Wireless
		Application Environment (WAE) specifications.  It was
		developed for the 2000 Final Year engineering project
		at the University of Canberra.

14:15 - 14:45   Reverse Engineering 101
		Hugh Blemings, IBM LTC Ozlabs

		Hugh describes how he reverse engineered the serial
		protocols used in communicating between computers and
		mobile phones.

14:45 - 15:15   Debugging gcc problems
		Alan Modra, IBM LTC Ozlabs

15:15 - 15:45   Afternoon Tea

15:45 - 16:45   NFS Version 4
		Martin Pool, VA Linux.

16:45 - 17:15   Evacs

		David Gibson

		As the first Australian State or Territory, the ACT
		Electoral commission is introducing electronic voting
		for the October 2001 election.  The winning tender for
		the software is based on Open Source, which is
		particularly attractive in this environment because
		all aspects of the software can be made public, thus
		precluding any abuse.

17:15 - 17:45   Open Source Imaging, a status report

		Michael Still

		This talk covers recent development work on Panda, a
		PDF generator.  It will also cover work on the
		scripting front end to Panda, the PDF parser that is
		under way as well, and PNGTools, a suite of tools for
		PNG images that is similar to the libtiff tiff
		utilities.
