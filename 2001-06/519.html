Are you a graphic designer?
Have you got a talent to make things look good?
If the answer to EITHER of these questions is yes, then we want YOU!

Yep, it's that time of the year again; where all you budding artists out
there are needed to create the ultimate design for the
"Australian National Installfest (by Auug)", set to be held on August the
25th

We need posters & tshirts. We need banners and logos - We need your help!
To the winner of the competition, a tshirt of their creation & the
distribution of thier choice will be awarded.

In order to enter your design, the following rules/guidelines must be
adhered to:

    1. A maximum of three colours plus the colour of the TShirt can
       be used. This includes the using black and white.
    2. The words "Australian National Installfest (by AUUG)"
       must appear on the design. The "(by AUUG)" bit need only be small.
       (AUUG has gratiously offered to provide insurance to any user group
       participating in the installfest but to do this it must be
       an AUUG event) Other slogans/names may be added by a particular
       user group later.
    3. The design must work well on two different colour tshirts
    4. No copyrighted images should be used without permission.
       (Permission has been obtained to use the BSD Daemon for designs)
    5. Designs should ideally be created using vector based tools
       to prevent any hassles when getting the design printed

Judging will be based on the above rules/guidelines and on how well the
winning design presents a cute'n'cuddly, professional, alternative and
funky image helping promote the national event.

All entries should be emailed to <A HREF="mailto:linux@senet.com.au">linux@senet.com.au</A>
and will be judged on 9th July 2001

Good Luck!
