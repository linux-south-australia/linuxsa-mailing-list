If your phone number is in the following ranges, you might be
surprised:

PROSPECT        08 82691000-82697999   
PROSPECT        08 83420000-83426999  
PROSPECT        08 83429000-83429999 
PROSPECT        08 83441000-83449999

Note that that's from a list from last month;  there might be more
number ranges covered by now.

Check the Telstra ADSL qualification page:
<A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/bigpond/adslsq/">http://www.telstra.com.au/bigpond/adslsq/</A>

If that says you can get ADSL, you can actually get it through any
provider, not just Telstra.

 &gt; Now, I would have gone with it anyway, except that there are 3 people living
 &gt; in the house. This equates to a 0.953 Gb limit per person.
 &gt; I think most of you will agree this is a little annoying.
 &gt; I contacted Telstra to ask them about their "$11 per extra user" part of the
 &gt; clause. You see, if you have extra people networked up in your house, you
 &gt; are supposed to pay an $11 per user.
 &gt; I wanted to know if this amount gave you an extra 3 Gb per user.
 &gt; As it turns out, No. You get 3 Gb per ADSL account - so if you share it
 &gt; among 3 people, thats, yes, less than 1 Gb each.
 &gt; I asked what the $11 gave you, but as far as they can tell me, the answer is
 &gt; nada. zilch. Its just another one of those fees that Telstra impose "because
 &gt; they can".

So use a different provider.  Be aware that in almost every conceivable
aspect of telecommunications, Telstra probably have the worst deal on the
market.  ADSL is absolutely no exception.

 &gt; Does anyone think this is unfair as well?
 &gt; Does anyone have the TIO/ACCC's email addy handy, because I'd like to post
 &gt; this off to them as well.

You won't get anywhere with that.  Telstra are required to offer services
on terms which are consistent with their terms and conditions, not on terms
which people who aren't even their customers think are "fair".  They can 
make their terms and conditions as draconian as they like, and as long as
they stick to them religiously the TIO won't give a damn.
