&gt;Not all small/backyard ISPs have their primary (and often only) upstream
&gt;connection running into a router. Running it into the back of a UNIX box
and
&gt;routing all traffic from the dialup access servers through it seems quite
&gt;common.

Is it really? I havn't seen this much since it was acceptable to run an ISP
with a dialup modem to a backbone. Perhaps it will come back into fashion
now that more and more services are being presented as ethernet.

&gt;Obviously the bigger you get, the more you start wondering "Should I use a
&gt;router?". But even still, you'd not want to put all your upstream
&gt;connections on the one router. You'd look pretty silly when the router's
&gt;powersupply fried and left you with no Internet connection :-)

There are reasons why you do want your multiple upstream connections on one
router .. all of the hosts on your network are going to need a default
route, or otherwise need to learn routes (a lot of them!) for at least a
part of the internet from your multiple gateways. You could have a seperate
router on each upstream link, but they're expensive enough as it is without
having to duplicate routing tables on expensive router ram. Unless you're
using something like HSRP, the packets are going to be needlessly routed by
one of the routers anyway, only so the data can go out the other router.

Also, the cheap PC is much more likely to blow a power supply than a router,
but just in case, I use redundant power supply systems :)

&gt;Indeed. But again, for the small/backyard ISPs, even a 2600 is not worth
the
&gt;effort. Assuming they only have 1 or 2 upstream connections, there are more
&gt;economical (and sensible) ways of doing it.

Unless you're doing tricks with proxies, having multiple upstreams announce
for you or running 2 distinct networks with your 2 upstream links, you're
going to want to run BGP. In Australia, that means getting a Cisco. I don't
know of anyone running gated or zebra as part of a commercial backbone.

&gt;One of the things I love about running the Internet connection right into
&gt;the firewall is the fact that they're a hell of a lot easier and cheaper to
&gt;upgrade. If my 3600 is being slow and needs more memory it becomes an
&gt;expensive exercise. With a PC, you can pickup 128MB RAM for ~$50.

Definately, although some of the newer routers can take standard SDRAM now
:)

&gt;It's not always ideal, however. You can make quite decent routers out of
&gt;Free UNIX machines. With multiple interface NICs[1] you could achieve a
&gt;completely unreasonable amount of upstream connections :-)

For &lt;100mb/s links, VLANS with a decent switch will be easier to manage and
probably cheaper than multiple interface nics.
