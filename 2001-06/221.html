Yep. We sell one as an optional part of our ADSL service (and happy 
to sell them separately). We sell them for $400 tax paid. See the 
price list @ <A HREF="http://adsl.internode.on.net">http://adsl.internode.on.net</A>

Its solid state (no moving parts), managed with a web browser, does 
what you want and quite a bit more besides (DHCP server, configurable 
port filters, configurable 'port forwarding' in just the sense you 
mean it, and several other things). The unit is from Alloy and it's 
called an IP5020. It's about the size of two packets of fags, has a 
plugpack and two ethernet jacks. Brilliant, and seriously beats 
working.

More info on the device itself is at 
<A HREF="http://www.alloy.com.au/products/ip5020.htm">http://www.alloy.com.au/products/ip5020.htm</A> for a bit more info. 
I've tried a number of these, and this one is brilliant in terms of 
price/performance - $400 is cheaper than even most linux boxes, 
unless you value your own time at $0.

If you want a happy learning curve, build a new linux box up however 
- its great practice :)

However, if you just need to get a firewall/NAT/PAT/DHCP job done and 
get on with something else, the Alloy box is brilliant, and seriously 
beats working.  No extra mini-tower to clutter the bench, no hard 
drive to fail and need replacing.

Cheers,
Simon Hackett

&gt;Howdy all,
&gt;
&gt;is there such a device which supports port forwarding. Other then a Linux
&gt;machine. I am looking to purchase an ADSL modem (or whatever they are
&gt;called) but i would like to have one that supports port forwarding.
&gt;
&gt;my reason: i have a linux machine (which is broken down) which i want to use
&gt;as a mail server. the ADSL device needs to be able to forward packets
&gt;destern for port 110, 25 and 80 to the linux machine when its up and
&gt;running. however, i still want my win machine to surf the net as normal.
&gt;
&gt;If there is such a device, whats the cost involved. im only doing this for
&gt;self learning reasons and dont want to spend any large amount of money. a
&gt;second hand device would be good.
&gt;
&gt;if this can't be done then i geuss i will just use the linux machine with
&gt;another ethernet card.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
