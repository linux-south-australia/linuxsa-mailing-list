 &gt; Apple _have_ done a good thing and produced a very good platform.
 &gt; Unfortunately they are limiting the scope of how great Mac OS X can be

But the instant Apple provided enough bits to permit someone to port
the MacOS to Intel, they would cease to exist.  Overnight.

People are making comparisons between Apple and Microsoft.  Those
comparisons are wrong.  Microsoft's bread and butter is software;
it competes directly with Open-Source software in that sense, and 
comparisons between Windows and {insert favorite open-source OS here}
are perfectly valid.

Apple, on the other hand, is /not/ a software company:  Their bread
and butter is hardware -- They sell Macintoshes.  How do they convince
people to buy Macintoshes?  By also throwing-in the OS software which
permits application vendors to produce the apps which people love to use,
and formulating that OS software in a way which the same people also love
to use.

What happens if that operating system software gets ported to Intel? 
People stop buying Macintoshes.  Period.  Would a graphical designer
buy a Mac to run Photoshop if the same software, with the same look and
feel, on the same OS, was available on a $2000 kick-ass PC?  Of course
not, that'd be stupid.

To say it's in Apple's best interests to keep the MacOS away from Intel
is a bizarre understatement.  Keeping MacOS on Mac hardware is 100% 
*essential* to Apple's survival.  So why, pray tell, do they have any
reason at all to open-source the OS?

Enquiring minds what to know.
