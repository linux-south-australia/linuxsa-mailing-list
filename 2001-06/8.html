Richard Russell quoted some Slashdot poster complaining about RMS:

&gt; Simply put, his arguments are not balanced or flexible enough to safely
&gt; engage in a debate with Microsoft in a public forum - he would lose solely
&gt; on the basis that normal people would get freaked out at the intensity and
&gt; seriousness of his thoughts and actions. I mean, after all, this guy needs
&gt; his speech encoded in OGG cause he hates MP3s... how does he expect normal
&gt; people to relate to him on any level if he wants them to discard MP3s as
&gt; well? He may be a very accomplished man in his own belief system, but most
&gt; people don't think on his level.

Ignoring the RMS bashing, I don't think there is anything unexpected 
about this. It fits pretty much exactly alongside the FSF's "no GIF 
images" policy regarding software patents. I really would be surprised 
if they had any other attitude towards MP3.

Ogg Vorbis (<A HREF="http://www.vorbis.com/">http://www.vorbis.com/</A> <A HREF="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/">http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/</A>) is 
pretty cool. The free-software community (and the world!) is lucky to 
have this open, patent-free, royalty-free, quality compressed audio 
format at its disposal.

There are plugins available for XMMS and Winamp... and Vorbis streaming 
will be in the next release of Icecast.

Plus it has a cool name. :)

       Let me go back in there and face the peril!
               No, it's too perilous!
