Subject: Re: [Fwd: What is FreeBSD/Darwin?]

Hi Dan,

David [Lloyd] forwarded your e-mail to me because he knows that I have a
G4 running OSX.

Regrettably, I haven't every looked at the innards of OSX or Darwin, so
cannot answer developer oriented questions.

Interestingly, one thing I did many years ago is work at Adelaide
University on a software project which was looking at porting Mach to
multiprocessor hardware they were developing.

At that stage, Mach was much younger, and the development strategy of
CMU (the university which originally developed it) was to start with BSD 
UNIX and gradually "microkernelize" it.  Thus, the Mach kernel and the
BSD kernel were very tightly bound.  They were planning to reduce the
coupling over time.

If that is still the case, it might explain why the version of the BSD
kernel currently in use is so old.

We ended up dropping Mach in favour of Chorus, an OS developed in France 
which starte with a microkernel and then added a flavour of System V
unix as a programming layer on top of it.

David Lloyd writes:
&gt;  - I can't see that this is a true microkernel design, the way that
&gt;    Mach works (and Hurd might work one day.) Am I wrong, and in fact
&gt;    multiple OSs or multiple instances of FreeBSD can be loaded and
&gt;    run by the Mach core?

There is no requirement for a microkernel to be able to support more
than one user-level OS.  Perhaps you are confusing it with the concept
of a virtual machine?

The thing that makes a micro-kernel "micro" is that the kernel of the OS 
(the bit which is precompiled and runs in kernel mode) only provides
very basic thread and MMU control.  Things which other OS kernels
traditionally do in kernel space, such as I/O drivers and virtual memory 
support, are pushed out to the user mode space, and typically execute as 
ordinary programs which are given privilege in some way by the kernel in 
order to access things like device registers.

The benefit is a kernel which takes a much smaller memory footprint, and 
which is easier to configure dynamically since it does so little.  The
cost is typically efficiency (extra context switches, the need for
another API layer for user programs, etc).

Linux, while not a microkernel, provides some of the benefits of a
microkernel through the use of loadable modules.

BTW, there is a variant of Linux called MkLinux (Micro-kernel Linux)
which also uses Mach to provide a virtual machine, so it is certainly
possible to run a different user-level OS on top of Mach nowadays.

Cheers,
	-jeremy
