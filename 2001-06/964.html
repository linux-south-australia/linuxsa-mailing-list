Heh!

&gt;     I notice in my last batch of mail from this list that
&gt; another newbie has posted in HTML, and once again someone
&gt; has flamed him for it.

Incidentally, someone also pointed out some reasonably valid points, and
also marked the supposed flame up. If others don't recognise the markup
(because their mailer removes things between &lt; and &gt; or &lt; and &gt;
for example) or understand it then noone on this list can help those
others.

&gt; I am getting a little tired of this
&gt; happening as it doesn't really go with the spirit of this
&gt; list.

Oh?

&gt; If I was a newbie and posted an innocent request on a
&gt; help list, and being a newbie and not knowing any better
&gt; posted in HTML, and then instead of getting help, received a
&gt; rather venomous flame that didn't even address the problem,
&gt; I would think basically "what a pack of arrogant arseholes,
&gt; maybe I won't bother with this Linux thing".

Someone did address the problem. Incidentally, the person who should
have taken offence at the flame, indeed if it were a flame at all,
actually recognised that. Apparently, someone else (we won't mention
names will we Andrew) didn't bother to read the rest of the e-mail.

It reminds me of a test sheet where the last instruction is to disregard
the other 20 or so instructions.

&gt; We are trying
&gt; to encourage new users to join Linux, not scare them away.

Scare them away? Oh seriously. If you can't cope with obvious hyperbole
on a mailing list, then I suggest that you sit in your house, turn the
lights, TV etc off and not make contact with anyone. In the _real_ world
people are a lot nastier and a lot more devious than what I write.

&gt; Here is a possible solution to this ongoing problem that I
&gt; hope the list will accept in the spirit it was intended.

I see.

&gt; and the windoze part works, but the Linux bit doesn't. This
&gt; probably means using outlook express as a mailer which
&gt; defaults to HTML mail.

So does Netscape and some other mailers. And it's easy enough to turn it
off...Greg Lehey (if my mind serves me correctly) has a page on e-mail
formatting and bugger me, I can't remember it's URL :-(

&gt; If you want to change uncle Bill's
&gt; mind into turning off this unpleasant feature go right
&gt; ahead, but you won't get anywhere.

Actually, you will. When I reboot into Windows (not that often), I might
take the time to find out how in Outlook Express just to prove it.

You could, of course, use "help".

&gt; So this means that
&gt; something must be done from the list side of things to fix
&gt; our problem. 

The list organisers have basically said that it would take a reasonable
amount of time and testing (to paraphrase, and they said it publicly and
it's in the archives so I'm not inventing things here). Dale Long (I
think) or Daryl Tester (maybe) have both or individually offered to
write the relevant filter.

To my knowledge noone has taken up their offer.

&gt;     It has been a long time since I subscribed, but if it
&gt; isn't already done, when the message saying you are
&gt; subscribed to the list is sent to you it should contain a
&gt; brief run down of the rules (it may do this already, but as
&gt; I said, it has been a while).

Well, it doesn't.

&gt;     Also, why can't the list filter out HTML messages before
&gt; they are distributed and post it back to the poster saying
&gt; this is HTML mail and will not be posted unless it is plain
&gt; text. 

See above.

&gt; If this is done in a polite way, most newbies will
&gt; swear a bit and fix the problem and all will then be fine.
&gt; We are smart people here so this shouldn't be too hard to
&gt; fix, and if it isn't straight forward then - "use the
&gt; source" and "scratch that itch".

See above. There doesn't appear to be an itch.

&gt;         You have no excuses what so ever. You know what you
&gt; are doing already, so if it bothers you so much to receive
&gt; HTML mail - FILTER IT OUT.

Which, of course, implies that the newbies will help the newbies and the
experienced users won't actually see the mail. Now, that strikes me as
really helpful.

&gt; In the time it has taken me to
&gt; write this post, I would guess that it would be a similar
&gt; time that some people take to write flames to newbies.

At about 80 WPM, I doubt it. Some of us think and type faster than
others.

&gt; This
&gt; is also the amount of time it would have taken you to apply
&gt; the filter to your favourite Linux mailer. There are some
&gt; very experienced people on this list who also don't like
&gt; HTML mail and they have already applied the filter, or just
&gt; plain don't answer it.

That is true. That's their choice.
 
&gt;     In the interests of HELPING people, which this list is
&gt; all about, why not do what I do when I answer an HTML post
&gt; and politely point out the fact, and then answer the
&gt; question. It isn't very hard guys (and girls).

I've seen other people do that. Others don't _always_
&lt;bitch&gt;bitch&lt;/bitch&gt; about HTML. In fact, some newbies obviously
understand what &lt;bitch mode="on"&gt;&lt;/bitch&gt; means even though it's not
part of the W3C HTML standard although it's obviously valid XML or SGML.

&gt;     One last thing, many people "lurk" around this list
&gt; without actually posting and fix their problems from what
&gt; others post. If you don't know how to filter from your
&gt; preferred mailer (then RTFM dummy), why not post a message
&gt; asking some more experienced person how to do it?

Some people could roll a procmail called script that de-HTML-ises their
mail. Some people can't be bothered doing so.

&gt; That way
&gt; the lurkers may fix your problems because the penny drops
&gt; "why does he want to filter HTML mail?". Also other lists
&gt; regularly post the Rules of the list monthly so lurkers can
&gt; read them before they post. These are all simple suggestions
&gt; so maybe we can act like a community we are and look after
&gt; the new members and not scare them away.

Now, down to the personal. I have a tendency to speak in hyperbole and
most everyone on this list probably realises that. Furthermore, if you
are incapable of understanding that I do actually make some valid and on
topic points and statements as well as the SUPPOSED flame then I am
willing to translate anything I write into German, French or Italian and
send them to you in about 24 hours (yes, I can understand all three but
it takes me longer to actually speak or write them). This would be in
the off chance that you would read ALL of the e-mail.

Naturally, if you run a filter that extracts flames (or supposed flames)
and dumps the rest that also understands one of these languages you're
stuffed. You'd just get flamed in a different language.

I'll leave it up to you to determine whether the previous two (2)
paragraphs are (a) totally serious (b) partially serious (c) sarcastic
(d) a flame [ooerrr] (e) hyperbole (f) some combination of (a-e) ;-P
