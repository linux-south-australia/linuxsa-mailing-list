&gt;As well as my running needs I have some bulk project start-up needs, which
&gt;is what this posting was originally about. These needs can't be met
&gt;without paying a fair bit of money, since they run into hundreds of Mb a
&gt;time. Now that ISP people from multiple companies have educated me about
&gt;things like Telstra double-dipping on the ADSL tail I can see that it
&gt;isn't reasonable for me to expect these sart-up needs met solely via
&gt;convential access over ADSL. However with some CD ROMs, rsync and some
&gt;careful thought I hope to be able to do something there.

Well, those needs -can be- met technically via ADSL. But what you're 
talking about is a different 'need', that being a wish not to receive 
an excess traffic bill.

So the issue is economic, not technical, of course... and my issue is 
not that I can't afford to soak up a (say) single big excess bill for 
your individual link, its constructing a pricing model that ensures 
that we can automatically and reliably avoid being swamped by people 
eager to spend 24x7 downloading porn, mp3's or videos, just to see 
how many times they can fill up and empty their disks again (I've 
actually heard of people doing this in competition with each other - 
argh).

The collateral damage inherent in a pricing model which doesn't 
suffer from the above (our current plans don't - for us) is that some 
legitimate and reasonable users, who (as noted) we'd be perfectly 
happy to cut some slack, need to have that slack cut in a manner 
that's able to be automated (as 'reasonable use' is hard to automate 
- very hard indeed, as even Telstra have discovered)

I think this thread must be approaching the 'thrashed to death' stage 
at this point :)

Cheers,
Simon
