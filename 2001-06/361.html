The comment I'll  make is that the core issue here is indeed Telstra 
and its monopoly position.

It would be legally allowed to charge anything it likes, and offer, 
or not offer, wholesale access to its network at any price point it 
felt like, *except* that its monopoly position and its bottleneck 
infrastructure control make it different to any other company.

You need to be clear that the illegality that occurs is related to 
abuse of market power, not to whether they are, or are not, making a 
profit internally from their chosen price points. A lot of people 
don't appreciate this.

The trade practices act, which is what the ACCC enforce, contains a 
lot of elements related to abuse of monopoly power, to the effects of 
the deliberate misuse of 'bottleneck' infrastructure, etc etc.

In other words, &lt;random small ISP&gt; can legally charge what it likes, 
and can make a profit or a loss as a result, but Telstra cannot, 
because when Telstra charges for access at a wholesale rate which is 
higher than the Telstra retail rate for ADSL, and where no 
alternative exists, and they consequently drive others down the 
plughole with them, that's when the trade practices act starts to hit 
its straps.

The ACCC -are- the 'check' against the monopoly position. I'm glad to 
note they've recently got a small increase in their financial 
resources specifically to help them to deal with the escalation in 
cases and issues in the telecommunications space - i.e. essentially 
to help them to keep dealing with Telstra.

Industry gravevines are suggesting that we're not far away from a 
'Competition Notice' (another one) being issued to Telstra in respect 
to their conduct in the ADSL space in particular. The C-notice is the 
legislative equivalent of a tactical nuclear device.

&gt;I understand well business models, indeed there is a great deal to be said for

&gt;tantamount to Heresy to criticize businesses for... shall we say

&gt;customers'? Companies like my own make money, Internode does the same, indeed
&gt;your company is entitled to make a profit. What some people can't 
&gt;differentiate
&gt;(with clarity anyway) is that Monopolies need to be controlled in 
&gt;their business
&gt;activities for the sake of other smaller businesses.  Is that 
&gt;concept really so
&gt;difficult to understand, I hope not, because unchecked Monopolies are a quite
&gt;simply a death sentence to competition.
&gt;I'm supportive of profitable companies, not unchecked profitable monopolies
&gt;Monopolies are quite different to normal businesses
&gt;
&gt;As for 'almost free', take it up with Simon Hackett of Internode, I 
&gt;was quoting
&gt;from his posting (prior to mines) and he knows a great deal more 
&gt;about costs and
&gt;Telstra than me.

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I have no idea what it costs to lay a cable from Australia to USA, but
&gt;  &gt; I'm pretty sure it's not "almost free."  I'm equally sure that it 
&gt;is limited
&gt;  &gt; in capacity.  Why is it so difficult to comprehend that unlimited use of a
&gt;  &gt; limited and expensive resource is not sustainable?
