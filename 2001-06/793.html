Hi...

&gt; True. It is, however, hard to assume what Mr Sekar is and isn't trying
&gt; to say. We could go on for ages suggesting all the possible thoughts
&gt; that are floating around in his head, but that'd be pointless.

Of course.

&gt; If you're really paranoid, you could build a database containing the
&gt; MD5SUM of all the files on the / filesystem. Syncronise that database
&gt; with a server outside of your network and run a script that compares the
&gt; two. If they're the same, you can be reasonably certain that your data
&gt; is secure and authentic. This does have issues that you need consider,
&gt; but I'm not about to go into them now.

Yes, that would allow you to react to break-ins.  A combination of the
two would be even better.

&gt; &gt; If you specify that the file system is read-only in /etc/fstab, it can
&gt; &gt; usually be remounted (by root) as writable.
&gt; 
&gt; Seems an aweful lot of stuffing around to edit '/etc/inetd.conf'.
&gt; Changing a password would also present a significant hassle using this
&gt; method.

Yes, having to remount your partitions all the time would be a real
pain.  But (more importantly) there's a security aspect too: if an
attacker can execute commands as root, they can remount the partition
themselves.  But with LIDS, they can't make the partition or files
writable without knowing the password.

&gt; &gt; Lids lets you specify files, directories, and filesystems that are
&gt; &gt; read-only (not even root can modify them) as well as providing heaps
&gt; &gt; of other cool security features.  These security features can be
&gt; &gt; enabled and disabled on the fly by entering a password.
&gt; 
&gt; This is great from a remote-exploit protection point-of-view, but isn't
&gt; going to save you when 'Special Governmen Agent Nasty Guy' removes your
&gt; hard drive and steals all your secrets. That's a rather 'out there'
&gt; scenario, but the point is that there's more than one aspect to system
&gt; security.

Hehe... of course you can never have a perfectly secure system, and no
single measure will ever constitute a complete security system.  But
if you want to hide & encrypt your data, you can always use StegFS
(assuming you'd rather lose your data than have someone else find it).

Phil.
