&gt;  &gt; That's easy. We'd charge a base number to cover fixed costs and then
&gt;  &gt; charge a per-mb rate thereafter.
&gt;
&gt;Do you charge the per-mb rate differently dependent on whether it's local
&gt;or overseas?

We don't do so at Internode at this time. Very few ISP's do, in fact. 
Its the source of so much potential (and often actual) dispute, and 
requires such heavy duty traffic analysis, that its a matter of 
balancing those issues against whatever 'gain' might result for the 
customer (as opposed to just charging a fair overall rate per Mb or 
rate per fixed chunk of bandwidth per month - both of which we offer).

None of our upstreams differentiate. The only major backbone that 
does, really, is Optus - who can provide distinct virtual circuits 
over ATM for Australian National and for International traffic on 
request (all of which costs more because of a need to pay them for 
two pipes rather than one), or they can (and prefer to) provide a 
single aggregated link, like 'everyone else' [*]

&gt;
&gt;  &gt; However, a large number of customers do not -want- to be charged
&gt;  &gt; 'what it costs the ISP plus a margin', they want to be charged 'a
&gt;  &gt; fixed amount for access to a resource which, when fully utilised,
&gt;  &gt; costs more than the fixed cost they are prepared to pay'.
&gt;
&gt;Why do you want to attract these customers at all?

I don't. The trick is that if you offer a 'simple' pricing model 
(say, for example, the One.Tel price point of $21.95 unlimited hours, 
unlimited megabyte downloads dialup), you will collect users of that 
sort along with the ones that don't cost you more than $21.95 to 
service, and that costs-you-more category will both (a) flock to you 
in droves after being tossed out from their previous ISP and (b) be 
the ones that give you grief unceasingly, directly and via the TIO, 
if you try to do something as horrible as telling them to go away 
because you can't afford to service  them).

The issue isn't trying to attract the more expensive customers - its 
in making sure your pricing plans are equitable and aren't setting 
you up to be swamped by them - such people find the ISP, they don't 
need to be marketed to, they're roaming the streets in packs, looking 
for the next well meaning ISP without a working knowledge of how to 
drive Excel, so they can drive that one broke as well :)

[*] and before someone points out that connect.com.au offer 
differentiated pricing, I'll note that they're not a national 
backbone, they're a value-added integrator of Telstra traffic, and it 
took them two and a half years of utter unmitigated grief to get the 
bugs out of their billing system as a result of deciding to do fine 
grained differential charging. When one averages up what they wind up 
charging for traffic, it works out cheaper to buy it at a single rate 
from us for almost all situations. So where was the advantage again?
