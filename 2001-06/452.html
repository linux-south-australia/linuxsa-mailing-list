Hello everyone who is interested,
My problem was solved. Thank for the quick responses.
<A HREF="mailto:Steve@lansol.com.au">Steve@lansol.com.au</A> gave me the Redhat 6.2 CD from the PC WORLD June 2000 
which was the 2.2.14-5.0 kernel and worked first time. The one I was trying to 
use was the one from the APC Mag July 2000.

I got the following response from Adaptec this morning:
Create-date : 06/11/01 19:24:30
OS : Linux - Redhat version 6.x
Problem : 06/11/01 19:24:30 ardev1
   The install worked as described in the manual but when the system 
   rebooted. The system died with the following messages.
   VFS: cannot open root device
   Kernel panic: VFS: unable to mount root fs on 08:07
   We have tried an install again but with the same effects.
   The Kernel is 2.2.14-12 an is Redhat Linux 6.2.

   Greetings from Adaptec,
   
   The problem you are having is a relatively common and generic error 
   caused by any of a number of things.  I am assuming that this is a 
   fresh install of Red Hat.  
   
   We recently updated the driver for the card you are using.  I would 
   recommend downloading the most recent BTLD image and using "dd" to 
   build the BTLD disk.  The file you are looking for on linux.adaptec.com
   is linked from Linux Downloads as "RedHat Linux 7.0 Driver" and is 
   called asr_rhat7_v221_drv.img.  Please don't be alarmed if you are 
   using a previous version of RedHat as the driver is backwards 
   compatable.  You could also flash the controller up to the newest 
   firmware, but I don't believe you will need to in order to resolve your
   problem.  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you continue to have 
   problems.
   
   Sincerely,
   Adaptec Technical Support
   
I hope this is useful to someone else.

regards,
Brian
