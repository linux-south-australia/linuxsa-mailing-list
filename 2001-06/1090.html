&gt;&gt;Currently I'm looking at a Canon IXUSv, which is 2.1Mp, 2x optical zoom,

&gt;&gt;have to go buy a 128MB flash card as well.
&gt; 
&gt; I know of at least one reader that works with Linux. The IXUS is nice. I

&gt; believe Andrew Hill owns one.

Indeed I do! Well, at least an IXUS - not sure about an IXUSv. I don't
think that mine can record video, and I know that there isn't a mic. on
mine. Oh well. It's still nice with a 96 MB flash card.

My only comments about it would be:
   Pity it didn't come with a case - I had to buy that separately.
   Extra battery is essential - buy one.
   Avoid using the LCD screen when possibly - it will add so much
     more time to your battery life.
   Buy it from the camera house on Hindley St - all those camera
     stores on Rundle St. are rude and severely lacking in the
     level of service they will give to someone in jeans and a T.
     The one on Hindley St. will match the price of any other
     store....

Well, it's not "useless", and mine has a 4x digital zoom, which isn't
"useless" either. But it's not the same as a nice SLR camera with a
telephoto lens, if that's what you're asking.

But what do you expect? At least it's small and way sexy. :-)

(Even more OT, I also recently bought a Canon Elph 2, and that's a damn
nice small, sexy, sturdy camera, if you are looking for something in the
APS film arena :-)

Cheers,
