Hiya

I contacted Telstra in regard to their 3Gb cap for "unlimited" broadband
accounts.

I don't actually have any broadband at home, and cannot get ADSL in
Prospect. We were going to get BigPond Cable, but then they brought in the 3
Gb cap. (actually, 2.86 Gb, because telstra say 1 Gb == 1,000 ^ 3, although
the rest of the internet says 1 Gb == 1024 ^ 3)

Now, I would have gone with it anyway, except that there are 3 people living
in the house. This equates to a 0.953 Gb limit per person.

I think most of you will agree this is a little annoying.

I contacted Telstra to ask them about their "$11 per extra user" part of the
clause. You see, if you have extra people networked up in your house, you
are supposed to pay an $11 per user.

I wanted to know if this amount gave you an extra 3 Gb per user.

As it turns out, No. You get 3 Gb per ADSL account - so if you share it
among 3 people, thats, yes, less than 1 Gb each.

I asked what the $11 gave you, but as far as they can tell me, the answer is
nada. zilch. Its just another one of those fees that Telstra impose "because
they can".


Does anyone think this is unfair as well?

Does anyone have the TIO/ACCC's email addy handy, because I'd like to post
this off to them as well.

Thanks


Toby
