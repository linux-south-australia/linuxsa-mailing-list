Hi All,
    I really don't see the fuss about people who want
unlimited downloads. Remember when BBSs were common? They
had this problem too with people who were usually referred
to as "leaches". The idea was that if you downloaded
something, then you had to upload something sometime. Many
BBSs had a Download Ratio that people had to maintain and
this usually ended up with the leaches just uploading 5
copies of virus scan or something and didn't really solve
the problem at all. In the end as BBSs became multi line
they solved the problem by either charging by data or just
flat rating. A flat rate works the same as a salad bar at a
restraunt in that some people eat the entire offering and
you roll them out at the end of the night, whereas others
nibble a piece of lettuce and give up. Surely if some ISP
offered this facility it would work. Most restraunt that
offer this don't go broke (O.K. some do). What is the
problem here? Very few modern leaches have enough disk space
to download wuarchive or any other large file database, and
not everybody who has the facility would use it either. It
is just a simple fact of life that there will always be
people who play the system whatever it is, and in a user
pays system, some users will always pay some part of their
share of the minimum transaction fee in supporting those
others. ISPs just need to price themselves into the market
to cover it. If someone is serious about downloading every
version of every linux distro every day or the Dallas porn
archive, let them, just charge them an appropriate fee. Some
people will do so on such a plan, others won't. If it is
properly priced, then the ISP won't go broke, and the
punters will stop complaining because you have given them
what they want.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Limit


&gt; 'Unlimited' now means as much as you want as long as it's
not more than
&gt; 3 Gigabytes a month.
&gt;
&gt; Still a bargain, but at least now ISP's don't have to
endure the
&gt; fantasies of compulsive downloaders, and we don't have to
hear the
&gt; stupid "I demand unlimited downloads" thread again.
