&gt; &gt; Good, I try to get them back too :-)
&gt; &gt; Did you know that when newbies first post here, it's classed in business talk, as a
&gt; &gt; "Moment of Truth", it's when they gain an impression of the list, it's members and
&gt; &gt; it's culture.  If new people experience a Moment of Truth that is to them
&gt; &gt; unpleasant, they will take with them an impression that reflects on all of us.
&gt; &lt;/big snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps I should complain about shoddily formatted e-mail too ;-P

&gt;
&gt; The next two paragraphs are intended for fun and sample purposes only.
&gt; They are not intended to be any hotter than an ice cube in the freezer.
&gt; If it offends you, it's only because you don't have a sense of humour.
&gt; If you don't have a sense of humour, then delete RIGHT NOW...

&gt;
&gt; Maybe something to the effect of
&gt;
&gt; &lt;bitch mode="on"&gt;
&gt; If you silly, little QUAL, don't format your e-mail sensibly next time,
&gt; I shall remove the CYBER and roast you alive. After, of course, causing
&gt; you to suffer the first cardinal sin, GREED, because QUALs are just far
&gt; too thin and have no meat on their puny bodies in the first place and I
&gt; hate being hungry after a roast meal.
&gt; &lt;/bitch&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **
&gt; END WARNING

&gt;
&gt; Now, really, are we going to take that ridiculous example (READ
&gt; __EXAMPLE__ FOR THOSE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL LOWER CASE) as serious?
&gt; It's just as ultimately ridiculous as asking somebody whose RFC name is
&gt; "pegasus" to make my computer fly but it does make a point.
&gt;
&gt; Oh this is so droll and it's so way out of proportion to what actually
&gt; happened that even I am having difficulty working out how to exceed its
&gt; being out of proportion without mentioning Adolf Hitler...the Nazis...or
&gt; anything to do with fascism ;-P
