Robyn!

&gt; Does anyone know where I can get some qic-80 type tapes. 

I have no idea about that.

&gt; I have 2 tape drives
&gt; here that I think take them and I'd like to try it out. The drives are the
&gt; sort that connect to the floppy cable and both were setup fine in Windows.

I'd get their exact model number and start searching on google to see if
they have any drivers. If they were pure SCSI tape drives I'd say
without doubt they work with Linux but I've never seen anything about
tapes that connect to floppy drives. Perhaps a more specific model
number and brand would be helpful...

&gt; The only tapes I have are some 40MB 205feet and these wont work in these
&gt; drives. I'm a newbie when it comes to tape drives. Can't I just specify the
&gt; type and length of tape I'm using?

When you can get Linux to speak to the device you probably don't need to
specify that at all. Supposing that your tape drives will eventually
behave like SCSI tape drives (DLT's, DAT's), my understanding is this:

1) Data on a tape is just a stream of bits

File separators are either recognisable by the hardware, or might
consist of some predetermined sequence. Whichever, the hardware or the
driver will just "know" this so you don't have to worry.

2) Writing to a tape

You just throw bits at the tape device and the tape will work. With SCSI
tapes you have devices that will rewind after a command (/dev/st0 for
example) and devices that will not rewind after a command (/dev/nst0). A
non-rewindable device is useful if you just want to keep on adding stuff
to the tape without having to worry about clobbering what's already on
there.

3) Reading from a tape

You get bits out of the tape device. You can use something like dd
if=/dev/nst0 of=tape.dd with all the options that dd takes (man dd). It
won't read past the file mark if it finds one, or the end of tape (for
obvious reasons).

4) How do you determine end of tape?

Well, according to the amanda distribution the most sane way is to
assume that any EOF or error is actually the end of tape (that's a
paraphrase by the way so don't quote me). In other words, you don't
necessarily know. In addition because tape drives have the nasty of
performing hardware compression you may not actually know either.

Hence, you may not KNOW how large your tape is.

5) Sending commands to the tape drive

Using the mt command with -f, eg:

mt -f /dev/nst0 rewind
mt -f /dev/nst0 status
mt -f /dev/nst0 fsf

Look up man mt.

CAVEAT:
Because your tape drives are _not_ SCSI tape drives and what I've said
broadly applies to the SCSI tape drives I work with, they may have
different characteristics; they're almost certainly not going to be
called "/dev/st0 or /dev/nst0" but I may be proven wrong. I hope that
what I've said will help you a little in understanding how tapes work.
