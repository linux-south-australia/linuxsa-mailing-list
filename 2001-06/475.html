Yikes!

&gt; The thing is, getting what you've outlined above was actually easier (for
&gt; me) under FreeBSD than it was under RH7.1.

Firstly, I can't get my BSD box to dial up my ISP because the "tun"
device, which I apparently need, wasn't compiled for my default 4.2
install, or I did something wrong. Now, I've got the documentation to
fix it, but I don't have the time.

&gt; It took a good 90 Minutes to get
&gt; RH7.1 upto the standard that I'd call "workable" (including Install,
&gt; PPP configuration etc). The same setup under FreeBSD took me about 60
&gt; minutes. I found the documentation under FreeBSD a lot clearer and more
&gt; concise making many tasks a lot simpler.

I managed to configure ALL my RedHat 7.1 stuff in about 15 minutes,
except for Sendmail which I accidentally blew up. To get the BSD stuff
up and running would take me hours of reading (not that I mind reading)
and buggering around.

My point is that I am much more "au fait" with a RedHat configuration
than BSD regardless of whether RedHat or BSD are superior to each other
or not. I'd have to do a heap more reading and I'll get around to it
_eventually_, and yes I know how to install stuff onto my BSD box (not
that I can convince the ports collection to do anything, but that's
because I haven't configured my RedHat 7.1 box to masquerade ftp through
correctly)...

:-(
