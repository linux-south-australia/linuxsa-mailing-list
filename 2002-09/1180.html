  NOIE to hold Linux briefing for govt executives

  September 25 2002

  The National Office of the Information Economy plans to organise a
  briefing on the use of Linux at the enterprise level for chief
  information officers and chief technology officers in the public
  sector.

  NOIE Business Strategies Branch general manager Steve Alford said the
  organisation had been thinking of a briefing for agencies on Linux and
  other Open Source software for some time. "The proposal for a briefing
  on this issue was tested with public sector IT managers and they were
  supportive. The briefing will be held later this year or early in
  2003."

  Alford said the idea had originated with the NOIE which had then
  canvassed IBM's interest in participating. IBM had been helpful in
  providing information on Open Source Software issues to date, he
  added.

  It is relevant to note that two government agencies, Veterans' Affairs
  and Centrelink, have started using Linux.

  The CIOs of all Commonwealth agencies would be invited to the
  briefing, Alford said, adding that there was no compulsion to attend;
  it depended on the individual's interest.

  The NOIE has talked to the Australian Unix and Open Systems User Group
  about the briefing.

  AUUG treasurer Gordon Hubbard said the government was starting to see
  Linux and other Open Computing platforms as a way to control IT
  costs. "The NOIE is clearly responding to the needs of government CIOs
  to learn as much as possible about the financial advantages for their
  organisations," Hubbard said.

  Active lobbying by vendors and AUUG had played some role in this move,
  Hubbard said. "The AUUG board has recently formed a six-person
  subcommittee called Open Computing for Government. I'm chairing the
  subcommittee and Greg Lehey (AUUG President) is deputy chair."

Gordon and I met Steve Alford in Melbourne earlier this month.  He
made a much better impression on us than we expected, and we realise
that we still need to find our feet in this material.  If anybody has
interesting opinions or ideas, we'd welcome them.  Note that we're
talking about solid business reasons why the Government should use
BSD, not ideological ones.
