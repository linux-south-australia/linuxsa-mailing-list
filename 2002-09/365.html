Hi.

Do you have an automount system running?

I have found them to be quite dd unfriendly, to the point of turning them
off, especially on the floppy. You dont say what happens if you browse the
cd with it mounted rather than cp or dd it, does it work?

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been trying to get my cdrom working for quite some time now, and
&gt; am almost ready to give up... thought I'd try a post to the list as a
&gt; last resort.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems whenever I try to use dd or cp to copy a cd, it gives me an i/o
&gt; error. This is my setup:
&gt; 
&gt; Debian Woody, 2.4.18 kernel, using xfs.
&gt; hda: / on xfs
&gt; hdb: currently unmounted xfs drive
&gt; hdc: ide cdrw, is /dev/scd0
&gt; hdd: ide cdrom
&gt; (Both cd drives are made by Sony)
&gt; 
&gt; The problem could be a number of things, but (as far as I know) I've
&gt; elimenated most of these...
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Hardware problem
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried both of the currently installed drives, with the same
&gt; errors (although weirdly (?) the filesizes I get with a dd if=/dev/hdd 
&gt; and dd if=/dev/scd0 give different filesizes...). The cdrom drive is
&gt; quite new (I bought it maybe half a year ago because my previous drive
&gt; had the same problem, and I was trying to rule out faulty cdrom) but has
&gt; not had a lot of use since I got the i/o errors the very first time I
&gt; tried it after plugging it in.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, this new drive was bought before my latest hardware upgrade, and
&gt; so I have got the error with both a Pentium-1 200MHz and a Pentium-II
&gt; 400MHz, both naturally using different motherboards.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. IDE bus itself
&gt; 
&gt; I have plugged the cdrom into both hdb and hdd, so I am guessing that it
&gt; is not a matter of one of my IDE channels being faulty. I also tried
&gt; using a different IDE cable I had lying around.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Faulty media
&gt; 
&gt; I have so far tried 11 of the CD's in my collection for testing, most of
&gt; them being normal data CD's of varying ages/condition, and one being a
&gt; VCD that was burned only a few days ago on a TDK CD (reliable brand?)
&gt; with no scratches or dust to be seen. Of these, only one (fairly old) cd
&gt; copied without error.
&gt; 
&gt; I have so far been pretty much avoiding the use of my cdrom drive, but I
&gt; am getting rather annoyed with it.. My friends come around and when I
&gt; tell them it's not working I get "why don't you read it in Windows it
&gt; worked in my computer..." as you can imagine it's really annoying.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone knows anything that could help, I really would love to hear
&gt; from you. Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; Daniel Mundy
