Hi,

&gt;&gt; To be honest, the ONLY reason to have secondary MXs these days is if you 
&gt;&gt; experience very high loads or you have an unreliable link.
&gt;
&gt;It'd have to be *really* unreliable.
&gt;
&gt;SMTP has built in resilience. It doesn't really matter if your mail
&gt;server is down a few hours. Or even a few more.

This is true, but for intermittently connected systems it does help.  Most
of our customers run Exchange servers on a dialup link.  The link is a "dial
on demand" arrangement, and rarely stays up for more than 10-15 minutes,
then goes offline for another couple of hours...  Without a secondary MX,
the sending mail server has a pretty small "window" in which it can deliver
mail, and if the sender is only retrying (say) once an hour its possible
that it won't deliver in a sensible time period.  

The solution: A secondary MX.  Mail is delivered to us, customer comes
online and sends the secondary MX an ETRN and we deliver all of their mail.
Customer waits until mail delivery is finished, and drops off the air for a
few more hours.

&gt;Also, having a secondary MX is a good way to get more spam and cost
&gt;yourself more traffic. Since the secondary MX can't make a decision on
&gt;whether an email address exists or not, it'll typically accept
&gt;everything. The canny spammer uses this to full advantage.

True, we've been bitten by this a couple of times...  In the last couple of
weeks we've had lots of attempts to relay spam through our secondary MX to
non-existent email addresses on domains we MX for.  The solution was to use
/etc/mail/access in sendmail to block those addresses...  Ie.

&lt;company&gt;.com.au	RELAY
&lt;nonexistent-user&gt;@&lt;company&gt;.com.au	REJECT

Would have preferred to...

&lt;valid-user&gt;@&lt;company&gt;.com.au	RELAY

... for the users that are valid, but it doesn't seem to work.  The solution
here I guess is to keep an eye on your postmaster accounts for NDR's and if
the same address pops up often, then block it.

Jim.
