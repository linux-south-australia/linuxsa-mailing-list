/me sighs

we need to runs david's emails through babelfish - david filter:)
david MEANS well, and can be very very sweet. he can also be offhand, 
flippant,and has a biting wit which can be very painful to people who arent 
used to him....david, be nicer dear:)

rob, welcome, and glad you are enjoying it all so much - its a helluva journey 
you have started on. despite the somewhat ineteresting start on it, welcome 
to linuxsa:) ask away, ignore the side grumbles and stuff, and gain from the 
immense knowledge available on this list - i learn daily:)

&gt; David, you need to get some sleep or something. I had recently been
&gt; thinking you had improved on your childish whining when people asked for
&gt; help in a manner that wasn't exactly following your template of how the
&gt; peasants must ask for your almighty assistance, but it appears it was
&gt; only a passing phase and you are back to your old, vitriolic, annoying,
&gt; _unhelpful_ self.
&gt;
&gt; Rob, don't let him discourage you, he believes just because he may have
&gt; a valid point it entitles him to point it out in the rudest, least
&gt; compassionate way possible. Let me paraphrase for you, as I wouldn't
&gt; blame you for entirely ignoring his tirade...
