Brandon!

&gt; Sounds like some kind of justification post. ;-)

I wouldn't attempt to justify myself, would I?

&gt; The premise of the text you posted in your email suggests you are trying to
&gt; help the person understand something partaining to what your supposed to be
&gt; an expert on.... now if thats english spelling, grammer etc etc perhaps
&gt; your on the wrong list .....

I am wholly unwilling to accept that people shouldn't attempt to post
their messages in a format that is readable and understandable. Whilst
it may be all very well to say "But the person might have a disability"
if we get too politically correct we'll end up saying nothing at all. I
don't see a problem with pointing out obvious spelling errors or
rewording dreadful English...to paraphrase a line from Don Watson's
memoirs I'm no bleedin' liberal and spades get called spades, shovels
are shovels.

How can we possibly bleat our heads off about Microsoft not conforming
to standards when we can't correct each other for our spelling?

How can we possibly even contemplate complaining that another company's
implementation of a standard is a pack of non-standard rubbish when we
will gladly accept ill-formed, gramatically woeful postings without
comment? We may find reasons to support that other company just as we
may find reasons to understand why a message might have been posted full
of grammatical and spelling errors. But it doesn't mean we sit down and
say nothing -- we find out the reasons and make a judgment about whether
to accept them or not.

&gt; IF, however, you are correcting a misnomer about Linux or Free Unix (xBSD)
&gt; etc then feel free to unlease the beast inside you.

My misnomer about Linux and Free Unix (xBSD) is quite obviously that
many of its users can write well with good grammar and impeccable
spelling. I know -- I should get over it -- but then again I do actually
care about the open source community and it would be nice if we
portrayed ourselves using standard spelling and standard grammar.

And note the two letter As in grammar ;-P
