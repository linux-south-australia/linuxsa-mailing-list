Michael,

&gt; Is anyone keeping a count of the long running 'DSL vs the Internet'
&gt; campaign?

Now you portray me as being against the Internet? Define what you mean
and provide supporting evidence.

&gt; What bothers me most about the grammer tirades (and yes, bad grammer does
&gt; make a question way harder to understand), is that there is no space given
&gt; to the poor individual involved to accomodate what may in fact be a major
&gt; disability. (Ron, I am not suggesting you are suffering from a disabilty,
&gt; only that you could be, and we wouldn't know)

Possibly true.

&gt; When I went to Communications 101, I learnt that the core of communication
&gt; is a 2 way exchange where receivers of communication process it and then
&gt; ask verifying questions back to the other party for any part of the
&gt; communication not understood.

Have you actually read the original message that started this off? 

&gt; Various things get in the way of this open
&gt; communication, and that is what has happened here.

Own that. It's your opinion, not mine.
 
&gt; It's a pity that a new linuxsa'er gets treated this way, and like someone
&gt; else has already mentioned, there are probably plenty of other lists that
&gt; will also critisize his grammer rather than help him with his question.

And sometimes he'll find people who will criticise grammar and point out
the answer, or many answers, to his question.

&gt; Perhaps in dealing with the question without gross critisism, we could
&gt; have had a better outcome for Rob's grammer and his linux box?

If you are so certain then why have you asked that as a question and
started with "perhaps"?

&gt; &lt;steps down from soapbox&gt;

:-)
