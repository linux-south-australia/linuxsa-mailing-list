Andrew,

&gt; Thanks to David Lloyd and Richard Sharpe for time and helpfull information
&gt; regarding Samba. I recently gave a talk to some managers and techies about
&gt; Linux/Samba as a printer/file server and it's capabilities.

It is always our aim to help implement solutions appropriate to business
and I am very pleased it went so successfully. Once large companies,
such as the company you work for, start to adopt and deploy Linux and
other open source operating systems, then Microsoft will have to improve
their product ranges or they will start to lose market share.

There is a limit, I believe, to the power of marketing and at some point
even the Board of Directors will take notice of the technical ineptness
of their current IT solutions. They'll either demand Microsoft improve
or they'll take their business elsewhere -- to Sun, perhaps, if they
like paying proprietary licences or to FreeBSD if they think they can
work in the open source/open support model.

&gt; The live demos went very well and even the windows machines worked.

Keep up the good work -- I think that we could do a talk to the next
AUUG Conference about deploying Samba in the workplace.
