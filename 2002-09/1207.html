&gt; Maybe someone can enlighten me as to how a large outsourcing company can

UNIX teams can handle Linux technology in their sleep.  They
already deal with multiple UNIX variants and in many ways Linux
is just another variant.

The larger number of Linux machines means that the UNIX team
should adopt a number of desktop startegies to get economies
of scale.  Springing to mind are standard configuration
enviroments, centralised software update, single authentication
reference.  This probably means limiting support to one Linux
distribution, just as you'd limit support to a subset of the
Windows operating systems.

Unlike Windows, none of the 'enterprise management' software
carries outrageous pricing.  Compare centralised software
update can using autoupdate against ZenWorks.

Supporting Linux also means that the composition of the
UNIX team will alter.  The addition of staff with lesser
understanding to handle level 1/2 helpdesk calls can
severely upset the 'elite' perception that some UNIX
teams have of themselves.

There is also a requirement for the Windows design people
to change tactics as there are some Windows technologies
which are hostile to Linux.  For example, the Exchange mail
protocol versus IMAP, or providing trivial applications as
executables versus web pages.

If the Windows team work with the UNIX team well you should
be able to acheive a single Windows/Linux authentication
environment.  This is work doing and might have spin-offs
in other areas (for example, dial-in authentication or
making it easy to use authentication for IMAP+SSL/SMTP+TLS
and thus incredibly simplifying travelling notebook support).

Some other integration activities aren't worth the trouble.
For example, you can probably afford to run parallel backup
and restore environments.

You may need to alter pricing methodologies.  For example,
support costs for a corporate mail server costs no less on
Linux than on any other UNIX.  But you need to be careful
not to charge-out trivial sendmail changes for Linux desktops
at the 'change to corporate e-mail server' rate, despite the
fact that the software used for the corporate e-mail service
might also be sendmail.

All in all, I expect EDS could offer a higher level of
support for Linux than it does for Windows.  And at a lower
cost to EDS.  This is because Linux levereges the UNIX features
that are designed for rollouts of thousands of identical
workstations in university computing labs.

Achieving this requires some careful politics to standardise
the Linux installed base (eg, making all machines authenticate
via LDAP).
