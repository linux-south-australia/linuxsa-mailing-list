&gt; Benjamin,
&gt;
&gt; I think that is specific to Flinders I too have my Bsc From there and
&gt; when I did some postgrad stuff I was stunned as to the lack of
&gt; compulsory maths but their focus is industry centric and they feel the
&gt; higher maths should be optional. Don't forget there are a number of IT
&gt; degrees on offer which have the core CS in all of them but the optional
&gt; subjects vary widely including the ability to do higher maths like the
&gt; degree I got.

I understand the university's need to offer industry centric IT degrees
but I don't think they should be butchering their BSc Comp Sci course to
do that.

My point of view is that the Bachelor of Information Technology degree is
a more industry centric IT course and students who want a more industry
focused course should choose that one. To me, BSc Comp Sci means something
specific and if Flinders Uni are handing them out without maths, I don't
think that is a BSc Comp Sci. They should call it something else. It
dilutes what BSc Comp Sci really is.

Again, this is just my point of view.


Cheers.
