&gt; &gt; It is also not third line forcing where all the goods or services in question
&gt; &gt; are being sold by the one company.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, I would think that this line is applicable in this case.
&gt; Toshiba is sourcing Windows from MS, and onselling it as part of its
&gt; package, it is _not_ forcing you to buy it from microsoft.

You are being sold a licence in this instance.

The licence is not valid until you have agreed to the Eula, so the sale
may not be considered complete until you do so. As such, you have
'bought' the laptop, but not the OS until you agree to it. This is what
third line forcing is all about.

If you had 'bought' the OS, then you'd be entitled to resell it. MS
would like to tell you that this isn't the case, but they can't have it
both ways.
