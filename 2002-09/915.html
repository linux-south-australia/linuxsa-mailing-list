Hello all,

I have a friend who connects to iprimus with a Red Hat 6.2 linux box and 
he's having a few problems with the reliability of his internet 
connection. pppd (ppp-2.3.11-4) will often spout messages like the 
following:

Protocol-Reject for unsupported protocol 0xa83b

This doesn't occur during the negotiation period, but whilst the 
connection has already been made (at random times)... this doesn't 
always cause problems, but more often than not it will result in his 
connection behaving flakily, e.g. he wont be able to connect to webpages 
or connect to icq...

On another note, his net connection is really unreliable and he will 
often get disconnected right away, or things just wont work. Could this 
be a problem with his modem not liking the iprimus modems?  My suspicion 
is that the protocol-reject messages are a symptom of a bigger problem 
(however, they don't always coincide with disconnections).

his chatscript is:

connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/iprimus'
-detach crtscts modem defaultroute user billybob usepeerdns
/dev/modem 57600

His modem is an old 33.6k of some description... (it's an external modem)


Thanks for the help,

Damien Uern.
