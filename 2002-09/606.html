&gt; It is also not third line forcing where all the goods or services in question

Unfortunately, I would think that this line is applicable in this case. 
Toshiba is sourcing Windows from MS, and onselling it as part of its 
package, it is _not_ forcing you to buy it from microsoft. This is no 
different to them sourcing the IBM (or whatever brand) HDD they use in 
the laptop, and not allowing you to buy the laptop without it because 
you would prefer a Seagate in it.

NB. I don't agree with Toshiba in the slightest in this case, but I 
think that is how this would be interpreted if used as an argument 
against them.
