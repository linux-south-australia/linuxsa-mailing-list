&gt; I understand where Gregg and David N are coming from and agree we
&gt; must not get into a war over this, but like it or not, OSS is making
&gt; inroads into public minds and government run departments. I have a
&gt; preference for GPL licensing (like many others) and am wondering if
&gt; AUUG would prefer it to stay well tucked up in the background.

I think there's a place for both licenses.  Ultimately, it's up to the
government what they choose to do.  Don't overestimate our influence.
We can explain the issues to NOIE and other interested bodies to the
best of our ability, but we can't make decisions for them.  Note also
that the six man AUUG OCG committee contains three BSD people and
three Linux people:

  Gordon Hubbard (chairman)	Caldera Linux
  Greg Lehey (deputy chair)	FreeBSD
  David Purdue (sec)		OpenBSD
  Mark White			Red Hat Linux
  Andrew Macrae			FreeBSD
  Con Zymaris			Linux (sorry, don't know which)

We didn't explicitly choose things that way: we have more important
criteria.  But I think it should be clear that we're not biased in the
one or other direction.

&gt; Gregg is correct in saying that Apache and Samba are key drivers in
&gt; the adoption of OSS, but I do think it is also a bit of a red
&gt; herring.

No, the license issue is a red herring.  The availability of
applications is real.

&gt; Linux (GNU/Linux) under a GPL license was really what made me take
&gt; take notice of alternatives. I'm not sure why people use Linux but
&gt; for me personally Linux and GPL go hand in hand.

Fine, everybody has his reasons.  When I started using Linux, it
wasn't under the GPL.  That came later.  And note that Apache is also
not under GPL; the Apache license is closer to BSD than GPL.

&gt; Without the GPL license would Linux/OSS be in the position we are
&gt; now?

Undoubtedly yes.

&gt; Would Apache and Samba, the key utils, be little more than a shadow
&gt; of what they are now without Linux?

No.

In March 2000 I was at a Linux conference in Sydney with Dan Shearer,
amongst others, representing Linuxcare.  A potential customer came
along and wanted to see Linux in operation.  Unfortunately, we had no
Linux machine free, so Dan took my FreeBSD laptop and showed the
customer the things that interested him under FreeBSD.  The customer
never knew the difference between FreeBSD and Linux, and it wasn't
important to the demonstration.  He certainly didn't ask about the
license, beyond the fact that the software was free, and I'm sure he
didn't want to know any more detail.

I contend that most people who use open source software don't even
know the differences between the licenses: after all, the only real
difference is what you are allowed to do with the source code, and
most people don't do anything with the source code.  BSD has done very
well with the "disadvantage" that people can take the sources and do
whatever they want with them (except claim they wrote them).

There's an obvious reason why the freer license doesn't make much
difference: incorporating other people's code into your own is very
painful.  I did it a couple of years back when I incorporated kernel
code from BSD/OS into FreeBSD.  It was like pulling teeth: the kernel
interfaces had changed, and it took me over a month just to understand
what I had to do.  This was with two operating systems that had forked
ten years earlier.  If I had been asked to incorporate it into Linux
(and yes, I have written significant Linux kernel code), I would not
even have tried.  It would have been easier to read the code,
understand it, and use this understanding to write completely new
code.

Now consider the opposite direction: what if I see a nice piece of
code in Linux and want to incorporate it into FreeBSD?  I've looked at
this, too, while considering porting FreeBSD to the IBM PowerPC
architecture.  I'm not allowed to just copy it (well, I am, but the
requirement of changing the entire license to GPL makes it
impractical).  But it's not practical anyway: it's easier to rewrite
it.  About the only sources which would be useful would be
hardware-related structure definitions.  The GPL makes me have to
rewrite them too, but compared to the overall job, that's trivial.

&gt; IMHO Apache and Samba followed the driving force of Linux. Apache
&gt; and Samba are great partners but should not be held up in front of
&gt; Linux as if they were responsible for where we are now.

Without applications, Linux would be nowhere.  The same goes for BSD.
Linux gained momentum ahead of BSD not because of its technical
superiority, nor because of its license, but because of its untainted
background.  BSD was threatened by AT&T litigation in the early 90s,
and that scared people.

Hmm, that was longer than I planned.  But it's also not very relevant
to the original thread.  We need to be united, not divided, in
presenting open source to the government.
