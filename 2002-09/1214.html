Thanks glen,

it seems that you were dead on the money!

doing a, 

find /var/log -name '*.[0-9]' -print &gt; tempfile

produced an 11MB file !! with 267000 entries !!! now I just need to work out a 
way to delete them all :)

I'll try your fix, delete the offending files and then let you know how it 
goes on monday.

regards

Jarrad

&gt; &gt; Hi list,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a P2-450 with 128mb ram running RH7.3.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Every morning I find that there is a process called logrotate that is
&gt; &gt; hogging 35MB or more of ram and using a high percentage of the CPU load.
&gt; &gt; From the name I can guess what it is supposed to be doing but does it
&gt; &gt; really need that much ram and CPU time to swap a few files around? Is
&gt; &gt; this a bug or does this process really use that much?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Because it is using a good percentage of my system ram, it makes
&gt; &gt; everything else run really slow as the system needs to swap things in and
&gt; &gt; out of disk. I can kill the process off (which I don't really like doing
&gt; &gt; but is the only way to get a usable system) and everything comes good but
&gt; &gt; soon after, another process called updatedb starts. this uses alot of IO
&gt; &gt; time on the disk and also slows things down. is it safe stop updatedb
&gt; &gt; from running and if so, how?
&gt;
&gt; We've seen this.  Basically if logrotate has to rotate tens
&gt; of thousands of files it slows to a crawl and becomes a resource
&gt; hog.
&gt;
&gt; Try
&gt;
&gt;    find /var/log -name '*.[0-9]' -print
&gt;
&gt; to see if this has happened.
&gt;
&gt; The bug is usually in the configuration files.  For example
&gt; if /etc/logrotate.d/example it says
&gt;
&gt;    /var/log/example/* {  ... }
&gt;
&gt; then logrotate tries to rotate the example.log file and the
&gt; already-rotated files example.log.1 and so on.  The result
&gt; is thousands of log files over time.
&gt;
&gt; The correct regular expression
&gt;
&gt;    /var/log/example/*.log { ... }
&gt;
&gt; fixes this problem
&gt;
&gt; To clean up the mess you probably need to delete all the
&gt; multiply-rotated files.
