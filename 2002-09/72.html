&gt; They may swap your laptop for explosives?

It's probably the best way to sabotage a plane.. get a job as a security guard
and start planting things in peoples gear. I guess Matthew just made a
Freudian slip? :)

I hear in the USA they're so desperate for extra security wardens that they've
been taking on drunks, drug addicts, criminals, and otherwise generally people
completely unsuitable for the job... under the guise of 'increasing' security.
So, maybe it has happened already?

&gt; 
&gt; *shakes da head*
&gt; 
&gt; What is the world coming to...

As someone else once said, "Who guards the guards?"

Or in a modern-day sense -- if america is the (self proclaimed) "world's
policeman" and "guardian of freedom", then who is their anto-corruption
watchdog?

Remember, this is the same country which once came up with a plan to hijack
and crash a jet into one of their own skyscrapers, and pretend it was
terrorists, so as to get public support to invade Cuba. (Plan was released under
USA freedom of information act - its not a conspiracy theory).
