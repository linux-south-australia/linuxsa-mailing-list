Hi,

I have been trying to get my cdrom working for quite some time now, and
am almost ready to give up... thought I'd try a post to the list as a
last resort.

It seems whenever I try to use dd or cp to copy a cd, it gives me an i/o
error. This is my setup:

Debian Woody, 2.4.18 kernel, using xfs.
hda: / on xfs
hdb: currently unmounted xfs drive
hdc: ide cdrw, is /dev/scd0
hdd: ide cdrom
(Both cd drives are made by Sony)

The problem could be a number of things, but (as far as I know) I've
elimenated most of these...

1. Hardware problem

I have tried both of the currently installed drives, with the same
errors (although weirdly (?) the filesizes I get with a dd if=/dev/hdd 
and dd if=/dev/scd0 give different filesizes...). The cdrom drive is
quite new (I bought it maybe half a year ago because my previous drive
had the same problem, and I was trying to rule out faulty cdrom) but has
not had a lot of use since I got the i/o errors the very first time I
tried it after plugging it in.

Also, this new drive was bought before my latest hardware upgrade, and
so I have got the error with both a Pentium-1 200MHz and a Pentium-II
400MHz, both naturally using different motherboards.

2. IDE bus itself

I have plugged the cdrom into both hdb and hdd, so I am guessing that it
is not a matter of one of my IDE channels being faulty. I also tried
using a different IDE cable I had lying around.

3. Faulty media

I have so far tried 11 of the CD's in my collection for testing, most of
them being normal data CD's of varying ages/condition, and one being a
VCD that was burned only a few days ago on a TDK CD (reliable brand?)
with no scratches or dust to be seen. Of these, only one (fairly old) cd
copied without error.

I have so far been pretty much avoiding the use of my cdrom drive, but I
am getting rather annoyed with it.. My friends come around and when I
tell them it's not working I get "why don't you read it in Windows it
worked in my computer..." as you can imagine it's really annoying.

If anyone knows anything that could help, I really would love to hear
from you. Thanks,

Daniel Mundy
