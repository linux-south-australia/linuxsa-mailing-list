&gt; &gt; The licence is not valid until you have agreed to the Eula, so the sale

&gt; &gt; third line forcing is all about.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see the connection to the third line forcing.
&gt; 
&gt; Toshiba (apparently) have offered a refund on the product, but using
&gt; their definition of product, not the one that Microsoft use in their
&gt; subsidiary licence.

If I go into a shop and exchange cash for a box with 'toshiba laptop'
printed on it, have or have I not purchased the 'product'?

There is no doubt that I have received goods in exchange for my money,
but if the licence is arguably a service, how can I have received it
without agreeing to the contract (in the form of a EULA)? It would
appear that you are forced to purchase it as a part of the 'product'.

It seems a little too easy to just bundle 2 items together and label
them as a 'product' to negate third-line-forcing laws. To use the
previous metaphor, what if Ford bundled a contract with Mobil into their
cars, and said it was a 'product'?

There is some suggestion that the trade practices act also requires a
manufacturer to make sure spare parts are available for repairs. Can
Toshiba refuse to sell someone an entire laptop as spare parts? If the
OS is part of the product, should it too be available as a spare part?
