&gt;&gt;On this list there has been little distinction between, Linux and the
&gt;&gt;BSD's.  For all intents and purposes, we have been treating them as one
&gt;&gt;(mostly).
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;[deletia]
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;And do I really want BSD being funded for improvement by government
&gt;&gt;departments,(public money)  so that corporations can take the best bits
&gt;&gt;and make them propriety?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;(The following might be worth a read: 
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html">http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html</A>)
&gt;
&gt;The problems with the above statement are manifold.
&gt;
&gt;1. Most government departments are unlikely to be funding real ground 
&gt;breaking work that no one else is doing and so forth. That is just not how 
&gt;the development work happens and they are not that forward thinking.
&gt;
&gt;2. There will always be a need for private companies, I believe. Some 
&gt;software will never get written unless there is a company willing to write 
&gt;it, and these people have a much right to use publically funded software 
&gt;as anyone else.
&gt;
&gt;3. What we really need to avoid, as Lawrence Lessig says, is having a 
&gt;bunch of people constrain our future flexibility by taking good ideas 
&gt;developed with public funding and then patenting or applying copyright to 
&gt;simple extensions of those ideas so we can't make the same obvious 
&gt;improvements ourselves.
&gt;
&gt;4. Governments should insist on and mandate open standards. They should 
&gt;not be in the business of mandating one software development philosophy 
&gt;over another, just as they should not be in the business of mandating one 
&gt;religion or race or etc. They should be able to choose the best tool for 
&gt;the job, but they should apply some fundamental rules, such as the tools 
&gt;should implement open standards. No exceptions.
&gt;
&gt;Regards
