Wayne,

&gt; I screwed up the configuration on my linux box for a commercial application
&gt; that I have been running successfully for about  3 years.

Sounds like some good uptime there :-)

&gt; When I created
&gt; the error I just left the application running, didn't think it would create
&gt; any problems other than just no work, so I left it.

In the future become a cynic!

&gt; Trying to execute anoything results in the message 'Resouce temporarily
&gt; unavailable'.
&gt; 
&gt; Anything that I try to do, I end up getting the same message.

Try using something less light-weight than SSH. This might sound like
strange advice, but if you've got resource problems then telnet or rsh
might be light weight enough to get through to the system. Only attempt
to use telnet (if it's running at all) as a last resort...

How are you logging into it? 

You could use killall5:

NAME
       killall5 -- send a signal to all processes.

SYNOPSIS
       killall5 -signalnumber

...eg:

# killall5 -TERM

...HOWEVER this would also lose your network connection.

&gt; I am about 150 km's away from where this box is located so pressing the
&gt; reset button is a little difficult at the moment.

For you, but is there anyone *at all* whom you would trust to:

a) know the root password
b) understand what you're talking about if you have to walk them through
an fsck at the start
c) execute the commands on the console

&gt; How should I try to reboot it, or alternatively free up some memory so I
&gt; can shutdown the offending program ?

I'm not sure whether there's much you can do in your situation; it
sounds like the type of nightmare where you have to have hands on the
console.
