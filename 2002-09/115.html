&gt; &gt; that's always my problem.  As far as the best customs/security people,

&gt; Really?  Last time I was in KL (admittedly a while ago) they seemed a bit 
&gt; edgy to me.

no, efficient and above all very polite.
This was around the time of the Commonwealth games (so 98 I guess?
jeeze that long, must be time to go again!) there so maybe they had 
all been told to be on their best behaviour.  But even in East 
Malaysia (Sarawak) which is like another country, it was the same.
(mind you I found all the officials to be polite and friendly,
including police (I was pulled over and asked to put my seatbelt 
on) and some security mob guarding a satellite
earthstation facility - we drove up this hill in the middle of
the night looking for a lookout and discovered this place, the
guards stopped us, I said what we were doing here and they showed
us about the place.)

&gt;  Australian Customs have always been pleasant and friendly to 
&gt; me.

they were ok but only just, not polite, not rude either though.
And inefficient, it took much longer to pass through than Malaysia.

Dave.
