That's certainly what's needed for the attributes.  I'm not sure how
to handle the issue of sparse files, not without delving into inode
structure, which would ruin the abstraction, and then you're straight
back into the trawling through the raw devices again.

&gt; "In Reiser4 (but not ReiserFS 3) an object can be both a file and a
&gt; directory at the same time. If you access it as a file, you obtain the
&gt; named sequence of bytes.

Hmm, what goes around comes around.  A lot of the early Unices could
access directories as files.  HP-UX 11i still allows it (od -x /tmp
produces a lovely dump of filenames and pointers to inodes).

&gt; There was a lengthy discussion on the Linux kernel about whether
&gt; this was technically feasible to do.

???  I couldn't really understand the logic of removing it in the
first place, to be honest (not that Linux probably supported it
ever).

&gt; This doesn't help with current problems like backing up sparse files under
&gt; JFS though.

The last time I thought seriously about this problem was to have the
kernel provide an "alternate" view of the file, which displayed either
a bitmap of blocks in use, or a list of ranges of blocks in use.  Then
a backup program would know that certain parts are empty and could
fseek over those parts with gay abandon, and restoring them, well,
heck, it's easy to create them in the first place.  :-)

&gt; How's this for a start?

It's getting there.  I wonder if Plan 9 supports sparse files?
