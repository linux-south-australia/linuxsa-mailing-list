Don't get too warm and fuzzy with your 'l33t skills', All TAFE computers
are balanced with the needs of user needs and ease of maintenance. Thats
why they are ghosted often.Students bust them all the time, they are
just ghosted to fix. If they were locked down securely, it would have
too big an impact on leaning.

&gt; hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; the subject of learning institute security came up, someone suggested it was
&gt; easy... well it really is that easy.
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that there are some admin staff from Tea Tree Gully TAFE on this
&gt; list and would probably be very interested to hear about their network
&gt; holes. I will approach you personally after my exams tomorrow if it helps.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I connected from my workstation to the network printer via ftp. opened
&gt; MSword and printed to a file, then 'moved' the file to the ftp connection
&gt; and YIPPEE ...FREE PRINTING. and the best part was that I wasn't put into
&gt; any print queue.
&gt; 
&gt; That said... I am a Diploma student finishing this year and am wanting
&gt; workexperience in networking and help desk (I come pre packed with my own
&gt; sponsor and work cover insurance). I would very much like the opportunity to
&gt; experience the 'hands-on' IT environment. ANYONE ?
&gt; 
&gt; I do not want to get expelled so I stopped there... but... I would be most
&gt; happy to tell you that I also accessed the local control panel, registry and
&gt; administrative tools even though they are blocked to students. Yes I just
&gt; typed "control" in the 'run' menu and there it was.
&gt; 
&gt; Pity Linux is not installed on the workstations.
&gt;
