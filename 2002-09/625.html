There is doubt over what you bought.  You think you bought goods,
but I think you bought goods and a right-to-use licence, the terms of
which you must agree to.  Shrink-wrap licences are enforcable, and one
of these is prominently (we're told) displayed on the outside of the
package (the baggie.)  If you wont agree to the terms of the licence,
which forms a component of what you are buying, then Toshiba will refund
your money in full.

&gt; There is some suggestion that the trade practices act also requires a
&gt; manufacturer to make sure spare parts are available for repairs.

Yes, and if you re-read what I wrote you'll see I made specific mention
of this.  I'm sure that anybody can build a Toshiba laptop from spares,
without contributing a single cent to MS, but the cost of spares is not
(and does not have to be) cheap.  You'd pay a fortune for it.
