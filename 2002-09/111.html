Definately! Although the cheap indonesian mob i'm going with might only be

&gt; that's always my problem.  As far as the best customs/security people,
&gt; I nominate Malaysia.  Very polite and helpful and efficient searchers.
&gt; Their customs mob made us despair of Aust Customs when we came back
&gt; into Sydney Intl airport.

grrr.... I was intending to wear them, just because they take up lots of space
in your bag otherwise. I got away with it last time, but that was years ago.
Hopefully it'll be OK flying to England and Germany, rather than the US.
