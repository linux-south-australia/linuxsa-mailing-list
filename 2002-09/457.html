Nik,

Wednesday, September 11, 2002, 11:55:48 PM, you wrote:

nt&gt; its probably /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/mouse is more likely just pointing at 
nt&gt; the serial port /dev/ttyS0 = 'com1'  /ttys1 = 'com2' and so on..

The mouse IS connected to /ttyS0 (I mistyped it last time).  I am
aware of the correlation between DOS ports and Linux ports.

nt&gt; check which port its physically connected to and that they are setup
nt&gt; 'setserial -a /dev/ttySx'

setserial -a /ttyS0       gives

/dev/ttyS0, Line 0, UART: 16550A, Port: 0x03f8, IRQ:4
Baud_base: 115200, close_delay: 50, divisor:0
Closing_wait: 3000
Flags: spd_normal skip_test

I think this is fairly standard

nt&gt; is this a gui login?
Yes, it is a GUI login, but GUI is NOT the problem.  The mouse is
frozen.  I might add that I have been bitten by this particular
problem before about 5 times with different installations of RH, but
my lamentable memory keeps me from remembering the solution I had last
time.  Thanks to Malcolm Campbell for his excellent description of
equivalents for mouse commands via the keyboard.  I knew they existed,
but my lamentable memory had forgotten the details.

/dev/mouse is a file in its own right, by the way, not a pointer.  I
have solved this problem before, and I can't remember how I did it.  I
apologise for the Windows program The Bat that I am forced to use
until I can get back to Linux.  The fix is simple, I just can't
remember it.

Cheers,  Rick

&gt;&gt;            I have a minor problem with mouse configuration, which I
&gt;&gt;            would be grateful if someone could help me with.  I wanted
&gt;&gt;            to install RH 7.3, on my dual booter.  I discover that my
&gt;&gt;            mouse is frozen once I get to the login stage.  Going into
&gt;&gt;            CLI, and using vi /etc/sysconfig/mouse I get:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;            MOUSETYPE="Microsoft"
&gt;&gt;            XMOUSETYPE="Microsoft"
&gt;&gt;            FULLNAME="Generic Mouse (serial)"
&gt;&gt;            XEMU3=yes
&gt;&gt;            DEVICE=/dev/mouse
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;            I suspect the problem lies in the last line.  My mouse is
&gt;&gt;            attached to /tty0.  man mouse is singularly unhelpful.  Can someone
&gt;&gt;            please tell me how to configure my serial mouse properly.  It is
&gt;&gt;            indeed a Microsoft serial mouse.
&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt; Many thanks,  Rick McQueen-Thomson
&gt;&gt;
