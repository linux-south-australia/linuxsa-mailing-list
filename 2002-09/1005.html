&gt; Will VMWare run under a basic Window Manager like IceWm or Black Box?

You''ll find[1] that you probably don't even need a window manager to run 
VMWare or indeed any X application[2].  You may not find it very user
friendly 
though :-)

Oh God - you aren't going to tell me that console only MS Windows is the
only way to go - that the GUI is just a waste anyway as well are you?  I
think the whole point of running windows is to actually have windows.

Or are you suggesting VMWare can run without X as it's own 'window manager'?
That would be a VERY interesting concept but I don't see how that would
happen.  How funny would it be though if XP ran faster under Linux (better
filesystem or memory / cache management or something) than under the naked
box itself?  "Linux accelerates XP better than XP" - ha ha


Ciao,

Michael...

[1] I've never run VMWare without a WM.  Should be boring.
[2] At your ?dm login window go in via "safe mode" and start up your app.
Or 
exec an xterm in your .xinitrc/.xsession instead of a WM and start it from 
there.
