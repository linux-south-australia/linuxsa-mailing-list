Ian,

&gt; David - I never liked the chunky screen fonts in X and Star Office - KDE
&gt; fixed that with KWrite which has beautiful screen fonts - it is very
&gt; pleasant and user friendly but still developing in my opinion.

You can get your Windows True Type Fonts to work under X. I believe
Gnome 2.0 has font anti-aliasing (or is it aliasing). I don't know how
to convince Star Office to use the X Server Fonts; it seems to have its
own.

&gt; Has Star Office done anything about chunky screen fonts?  I think it is
&gt; getting better.

I can burn you a copy of Star Office 6.0 if you like and you could see
for yourself.

&gt; But Star Office is a excellent suggestion - I should have already thought of
&gt; that (I forget he is a nurse - not an IT guy who needs a familiar MS Windows
&gt; environment like most people I know).  I just hope they have done something
&gt; with the screen fonts and generally clunky slow code (it will be running on
&gt; a PIII 450)

Once it starts it's fine; it's the startup that takes time.

&gt; As this guy has hardly ever used a computer in his life - I would like him
&gt; to have a pleasant experience with Linux - be nice to look at - easy to use
&gt; - etc.

If he's used Windows then provided you explain that "The foot is the
same as the `Start'" button he'll be fine. Set him up a Window Manager
theme that looks like Windows but show him how to customize it (i.e.
play around) as well. Lots of Windows users, once they discover how
configurable X and the various Window Managers are, waste oodles of
hours playing around with their new found freedom...

And then they tell their friends how good Linux can be which is the
result we want, eh?
