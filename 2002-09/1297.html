&gt; Ben,

&gt; &gt; What's the True Status (TM) of this stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; Because GCC 3.X is a _MAJOR_ version number change I wouldn't trust any
&gt; binaries precompiled against GCC &lt; 3.0 regardless of whether they're
&gt; purported to work. When a _MAJOR_ version number changes it's allowed to
&gt; break binary compatibility and possibly even some source code
&gt; compatibility.

Hmmm, there seems to be a major disconnect with reality here. Binary files 
from versions prior to GCC 3.0 should still link against stuff compiled 
with GCC 3.0 and beyond. I doubt that they [GCC developers] will have 
changed that.

Secondly, code that compiled under versions of GCC earlier than 3.0 should 
still compile, albeit with more warnings or the need to add extra flags to 
relax checks that are now done.
 
&gt; I wouldn't trust a GCC &lt; 3.0 binary on a GCC 3.X system in production
&gt; unless:
&gt; 
&gt; a) I had to (eg it was closed source and the company who build it are
&gt; being obstropolous)

I think the word you were searching for is obstreperous. However, I might 
be wrong.

&gt; b) I had tested it thoroughly

I would agree that you want to test stuff that goes into production.
