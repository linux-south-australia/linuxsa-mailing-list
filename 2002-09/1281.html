The subject came up on Slashdot while talking about the next kernel release 

"The choices: 2.6 or 3.0. Evidently there's been enough improvements, most 
notably the VM, that they're leaning towards calling it 3.0..."

&gt; &gt; Can someone explain what the VM is inside the Linux Kernel - what it does
&gt; &gt; ?
&gt;
&gt; Do you mean the Virtual Memory?
&gt;
&gt; If you do then it's the amount of memory the system thinks it has. It
&gt; can be comprised of:
&gt;
&gt; * RAM
&gt; * Swap Partitions
&gt; * Swap Files
&gt;
&gt; There's probably other types of memory but these are the most common.
&gt; The kernel tries to use the fastest type of memory which is the RAM (1).
&gt; If you use a certain amount of RAM (2) then the kernel will start
&gt; swapping memory pages (3) if it is able. This "swapping" is done to your
&gt; swap partitions or files and you will notice in the documentation for
&gt; swapon (4) that partitions and files can have priorities. You probably
&gt; want your fastest swap to be used first. Swap partitions are faster than
&gt; swap files (5).
&gt;
&gt; Once you've used all of your RAM and swap partitions and files you've
&gt; run out of memory; you will notice this long before you do run out of
&gt; memory because what will happen is your virtual memory manager(6) will
&gt; start to "thrash" -- it will spend more time swapping memory pages to
&gt; swap partitions and/or files than actually using the memory.
&gt;
&gt; DSL
&gt;
&gt; (1) Currently at least; I wonder whether we'll ever see the day when
&gt; mass storage is faster than current RAM
&gt;
&gt; (2) The kernel doesn't let you use all the RAM and then start swapping
&gt; to disk. Reason? The kernel needs a little bit of RAM to manage the swap
&gt; to disk efficiently.
&gt;
&gt; (3) Memory is organised into pages. Onboard, hardware chips know about
&gt; these pages and assist the kernel by providing hardware signals )eg,
&gt; page faults) to the main processor. Currently I think the pages are
&gt; about 4Kb but don't quote me.
&gt;
&gt; (4) man swapon
&gt;
&gt; (5) Reason? File systems generally use memory themselves because they
&gt; assume that storing your most recent requests in RAM will be faster than
&gt; requesting it from disk. Also they can do all sorts of things like
&gt; journal buffering, require permission tests and so forth. Now, if your
&gt; aim is to get some memory pages ONTO DISK then having your file system
&gt; keeping those pages IN RAM is a rather silly exercise.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know the details of a swap partition but I suspect it would be
&gt; designed to be much more efficient for memory pages than any current
&gt; file system.
&gt;
&gt; (6) Deciding what pages to swap in and what pages to swap out and when
&gt; is, at best, a black art. It can get highly mathematical (queuing
&gt; theory, operations research) and not all methods will work for all
&gt; situations. Let's say I have 128Mb of RAM and a process that takes 95%
&gt; of RAM but that's the only process. I don't want any of those pages
&gt; swapped to disk but some algorithms might. However, if I also ran lots
&gt; of other processes than having only 5% of RAM available could be a total
&gt; pain.
&gt;
&gt; Ones mileage definitely varies.
