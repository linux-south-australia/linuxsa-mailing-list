Just a note that my friend has not been able to get iHUG to work at all 
on his mandrake 8.2 distribution (whereas others have worked fine), 
anyone else running linux and connecting to ihug? They seem to have a 
weird setup (they're supposedly a pretty poor ISP anyway).

This may be of interest to u, i connect to ozonline, my ppp config file 
looks as follows:

connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/ozonline'
-detach crtscts modem defaultroute user XXX usepeerdns
/dev/ttyS1 57600

where XXX is the username for the account.. this username has entries in 
the chap and pap secrets files... the chat script just dials the number 
and waits for ppp to start, nothing special.  And I am running 
 2.2.14-5.0 on red hat linux 6.2 (hey it's a 486 firewall box)..

my chat script is

ABORT "NO CARRIER"
ABORT "NO DIALTONE"
ABORT "ERROR"
ABORT "NO ANSWER"
ABORT "BUSY"
ABORT "Username/Password Incorrect"
"" "at"
OK "at&f"
OK "atdt81223431"
"~-^Uppp-~"

my chap and pap secrets files look the same:

# client        server  secret                  IP addresses

XXX       *            PASSWORD           *

obviously XXX and PASSWORD are my username and password (not the real 
ones! :) )... i start ppp by calling "pppd call isp-ozonline" from a 
script...

if u cant get it to work with ihug, just change ISP's... when I joined 
with ozonline, some dood even talked to me about setting linux up to 
connect to their service, which was pretty cool :) (he had no idea what 
he was talking about and was no help, but nice try tho! )


Good luck,

Damien Uern.

&gt;  
&gt; I used pppconfig to enter all the details to set up the account, 
&gt; pretty straight forward.
&gt;  
&gt; I type pon iHUG and after a couple of minutes it dials out, making all 
&gt; the correct noises, everything sounds ok.
&gt;  
&gt; I check the extension of the phone and get dial tone, so it hasn't worked.
&gt;  
&gt; I do not know linux very well so I am not sure how to check any logs 
&gt; etc to find out what has happend but I typed pppd and got this message;
&gt;  
&gt; pppd: The remote system is required to authenticate itself
&gt; pppd: but I couldn't find any suitable secret (password) for its use 
&gt; to do so.
&gt; pppd: (None of the available passwords would let it use an IP address.)
&gt;  
&gt; I have triple and quad-triple checked the password and it works under 
&gt; windows to log in.
&gt;  
&gt; ifconfig returns only the lo device.
&gt;  
&gt; less /etc/ppp/peers/iHUG
&gt;  
&gt; # This optionfile was generated by pppconfig 2.0.10

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; I do not know what other pertinent files I could attach.  I find it 
&gt; interesting that I my password is not in there anywhere so there must 
&gt; be another file used but I can find no reference to it.
&gt;  
&gt; I have retyped all these config files manually and double checked them.
&gt;  
&gt; Where do go from here?  How do I get my laptop to dial into the 
&gt; internet please?
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks in advance for all help, and I have tried my best to use 
&gt; correct grammer (DSL) to make the question clear (I hope).
