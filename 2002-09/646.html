Hi Michael, the ~/.gnome/sound/system file is what I have been playing
with - the state of the file does reflect the options checked in the
control centre and if I make changes manually in the file they are
reflected in the options checked in the control centre, however, neither
are reflected in the audible state of the box - it still makes event
sounds.

The other option I tried was individually removing the names of the event
sound wav files, but doing this doesn't stick and I don't know where that
information is kept.

cheers
Dan

&gt; Ok, looks pretty much like a stock GNOME 1.4 install (I don't have a
&gt; debian install handy - not until I get a bigger hard drive on my laptop
&gt; :-P
&gt;
&gt; The software for configuring the sound properties is "sound-properties"
&gt; (to find this out right click on the menu item and select 'Properties' -
&gt; on Red Hat 7.3 it's found at GNOME Foot / Programs / Settings /
&gt; Multimedia / Sound).
&gt;
&gt; strings `which sound-properties` tells me that the gconf location for
&gt; enabling sound events is "/sound/system/settings/event_sounds=true".
&gt;
&gt; So looking in ~/.gnome/sound/system you'll find an ini file with a
&gt; "settings" section which has 2 fields - start_esd and event_sounds.  The
&gt; second one is the one you want to change to "false".
&gt;
&gt; I don't have 1.4 source lying round, so give that a try and see how you
&gt; go.
&gt;
&gt; HTH,
&gt;
