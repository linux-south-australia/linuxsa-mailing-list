AUUG SA Chapter, September Meeting

The South Australian chapter of the Australian Unix User Group (AUUG)
invites you to attend their monthly meeting.


DETAILS

This is the first time we are using this venue, and many thanks
to Internode for providing it.

DATE  : 18th September 2002
TIME  : 7pm Onwards
VENUE : Internode

	Level 3/132 Grenfell St
	ADELAIDE

     aka 'the old AAMI building'

It is very close to Hindmarsh Square, which is your best bet for
parking.

Note that we usually meet on the second Wednesday of the month, but
owing partly to the AUUG conference it has been moved for this month
to the 3rd Wednesday.  Apologies for the short notice.



WHO CAN COME

Anyone is welcome to attend the meeting.  We will pester you to
join up if you come too often :-)

Please feel free to invite anyone who is interested.



AGENDA

* Luke Schapel will be talking about the practical aspects
   of wireless computing: in his own words:

    "a talk on wireless issues not already covered
     ie Antennae - card power - cable loss - EIRP [Equivalent
     Isotropically Radiated Power]- Statutary requirements etc"

   For those of you who haven't yet seen Luke's home made 'ex-Galaxy'
   hand-held antenna, this talk is a must ;-)


* At the conclusion of the meeting many members of the group
   ajourn for a drink and a meal at a restaurant or cafe nearby
   (Rundle St is just around the corner).




COMING UP

* October:  Glen Turner from AARnet talks about IPv6.

* November: Allan Packer from Sun Microsystems talks about database
             performance on Unix platforms.
