Hi,

You know this just occured to me...

I completely forgot until you brought it up again....

Here at my small company we have a Netgear Firewall Router that provides

1. # of web site hits in a time period
2. Bandwidth use by ip address
3. Bandwidth useage by service

It doesn't say exactly who did what, however.

It cost around $250 US, if I remember correctly.

It has NAT, but I only use it to put my routers on different subnets...

It is a Netgear FR 314, and can be found at: <A HREF="http://www.netgear.com">http://www.netgear.com</A>

We also have a DSL router/modem.

Nice web interface.

Obvious downside is that it can't be customized to the extent Linux or
Free BSD is.

Hope this helps....

James Leone

 &gt;Hello ya'all.
 &gt;
 &gt;I've posted about this topic before, but I am continually frustrated
 &gt;with not being able to easily report on Internet usage around my
 &gt;network.
 &gt;
 &gt;I've used before and mentioned a program called "NTOP,"
 &gt;<A HREF="http://www.ntop.org/,">http://www.ntop.org/,</A> however I've found its results to be a pain in the
 &gt;ass or unreliable.
 &gt;
 &gt;I have an ADSL router at the edge of my LAN, and a FreeBSD system
 &gt;running natd.  I'd love to be able to view a port-by-port analysis,
 &gt;which I could look at and would be able to work out for example "In the
 &gt;last month, we did 5Gb of TCP traffic over port 80, but we did 3GB on
 &gt;port 1214 [KaZaA or something.]"  Then it could do a host-by-host
 &gt;analysis, or whatever is required.
 &gt;
 &gt;NTOP Did that, kind of, but it sucks at it because it's not a good
 &gt;reporting tool.  I just don't like it much.  It told me what I wanted to
 &gt;know, but it didn't do it nicely.  How do other businesses monitor their
 &gt;usage by stats and per user without restricting users to using a proxy?
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;We've had some problems lately I'd really like to get on top of, you
 &gt;know, like 900Mb in one day, and then 900Mb the next on a
 &gt;Saturday/Sunday, when normally on a Sat/Sun we'd get about 100Mb/30Mb
 &gt;for the two days.  I could use MRTG to graph and follow spikes, but I
 &gt;need better hardware before I can trace very far.  This also doesn't
 &gt;tell me the REAL stuff I want to know, like which ports were used, etc.
 &gt;
 &gt;What sits on the server, and rips all this stuff apart into an easy to
 &gt;read report?
 &gt;
 &gt;Should I change to WinNT and install Microsoft Internet Acceleration
 &gt;Server, because it includes reporting I might be able to use? ;)
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
