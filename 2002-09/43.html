Hmmmm...

&gt; Hello everyone , any newbies out there don,t be discouraged,

I'll lend you a grammar book if you want.

&gt; the KDE one,really gets me ,absolutely amazing ,I wish I new it inside out .\

(You can make it new. It's open source; you get the source for nothing.)

&gt; Got the floppy drive going at last ,and will not have to get rid of all the
&gt; stuff I saved,and can open lots of windows 98 stuff on Linux.

Windows 98 Stuff? Define stuff. Be more specific.

&gt; Down to
&gt; buisness now folks ---- When using the Gnome desk top I have in the task bar
&gt; ,the icon for Red Hat network monitor ,I use that for my dial up  (I Primus )
&gt; no problems . If I use the KDE desk top ,there is a dial up tool that has to
&gt; be configured ,and I can,t find the one I use in Gnome ,so where can I find
&gt; it when I use KDE withuot compromising what I have already got set up .
&gt; I hope that all you linux buffs can understand me .

I will translate your rather ungrammatical, impossible to understand
(well, almost) English into this:

"Down to business folks. When I use the GNOME Desktop I have setup an
applet which contains the Redhat Netowork monitor. This can start up my
dialup connection to IPrimus. When I switch desktops to KDE [this is
blurry here btw] I think there are a number of dialup tools that can be
configured. I can't work out how I did it in GNOME. Where can I find
[the dialup configuration tool] in KDE without overwriting what I have
setup in GNOME. I hope you [computer geeks and people who can understand
really bad English] can understand me]".

NOTE: I have interpolated the stuff between square brackets (i.e. your
grammar is really, really not understandable) is my observation rather
than what you actually wrote).

If you can't get a graphical one to work use:

* log into an X terminal as root
  (or, heaven forbid, log into a REAL console as root
   shock
   horror)

* type "ifup ppp0"

...if you have a modem link otherwise I'm not sure what command you
should type for ADSL/Cable Modem links etc etc.

* Use the KDE menus to find something that might like like an Internet
dialer (you found the Gnome ones...what is so difficult in finding the
KDE ones? Hmmmm....)

Do a man command on:

kppp
wvdial
pppd
chat
expect

If you're an X system user and don't know how to use the man command,
try xman.

If you can't use xman well:

a) either convince me to help you in person
b) work out how to use the man pages

BOTH are possible.

If you can't have the man pages installed (*sigh*) try looking up the
man pages at <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A>


DSL

(1) If you think I've gone right off , I can't understand your English.
PERIOD. Don't blame me --- I'll interpret it as I so choose. If you want
any of us to answer your queries try to speak English. I can clearly see
your enthusiasm but it is VERY difficult to understand what you are
saying.

(2) If English isn't your first language, you can speak to me (or the
list) in French, German or Italian. I think I can translate them better
than...oh let's not get personal...[read: the crap I attempted to
translate above]

(3) If I seem a little, ummm, unhelpful I'm not your employee and I'm
not your employer. I don't NEED to respond to what you said; I could
just trash it [and I probably should have] rather than attempted to
understand what you wanted to find out.

(4) Everyone else who wants to spit the dummy at me for being
unfriendly: carefully ask yourself whether I have answered the question,
or asked questions that will clarify the questions being asked. And
don't even dare send any dummies my way unless you have more oil than
Iraq...and if you think I have't answered the question -- answer it
yourself as well as flaming me for being unhelpful

[WARNING: I have received a huge shipment of oil from Iraq. And I've
started on the Qu'Ran again ;-)]
