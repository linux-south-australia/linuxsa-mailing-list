&gt; The question should have been "Did FreeBSD hurt BSD/OS?", and the
&gt; answer to that one is definitely "yes".

In fact it's not even that simple.  I think BSD/OS was hurt for much
the same reasons as all of the proprietary unixes are hurting.  It is
hard to sell something that other's are giving away, by which I do
mean that the free unixes are the same as the ones you have to pay for.
That's been my contention (and your's, I believe) all along.


&gt; BSD[Ii]'s leading technical people have very little to do with FreeBSD's
&gt; people, though it's true that, for about a year, some FreeBSD people
&gt; worked for Wind River Systems after they bought the software assets of BSDi.

Other than that the chief architect at BSDi was also one of the leading
(maybe chief?) architect of FreeBSD, and long before Wind River came into
that picture.  No?
