Past Labour Minister John Dawk-head introduced HECS in ~1987 which was followed
by converting any tertiary institution they could into a uni.  This was done so
nursing, childcare & many other courses outside of the uni. became HECS (higher
education contribution scheme) liable.  This is were the vocational institutes
& the research universities were forcibly merged and everything became blured.

Now, during the last ten years the public perception of universities
has changed:  They're now seen as teaching institutions, which is a 
shame, because universities have -never- been teaching institutions,
they've been research institutions which did a bit of teaching on 
the side to inspire more researchers to enter the field.

Now they're just job-shops:  "Enhanced TAFE", and for the first time 
in history people are expecting universities to be "industry relevent",
as if universities are supposed to care about industry.  And with the
Government shrinking funding, this tendancy is being reinforced by
the fact that universities actually do need to care about industry
to get money (again, for the first time in our history).

So they offer industry-focussed courses.  And because industry doesn't
give a damn about science, and very few companies have ever advertised
a vacancy for a "computer scientist" (they'd hire B.Sc graduates and
then spend a couple of years retraining the employee to turn them from
a scientist into an engineer).  So the universities find themselves
teaching about Visual Basic and Excel macros instead of doing actual
*computer science*.

So anyway, that's the critical difference between a Bachelor of Information
Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science:  The former
degree gives you a job qualification, and the latter degree teaches you
to be a scientist (which is almost useless in the commercial world).

 &gt; If you want a BSc in "maths _and_ comp sci" then do that

No -- if you want a degree in Comp Sci, then you need to accept that
Mathematics is essential for just about every aspect of science that you
can think of.  Computer Science != Computing.

Biology is just applied chemistry;  Chemistry and Engineering are just
applied physics.  Physics and computer science are just applied
mathematics.  Maths is at the root of all the sciences.  

Designing algorithms is an aspect of applied mathematics;  that's
what Computer Scientists do.  Writing software to efficiently and
correctly implement algorithms which someone else has designed is
what Bachelor of IT graduates do :-)
