&gt; Cyrus is unsuitable for some purposes. Here are some possible problems
&gt; depending on your particular constraints:
&gt; 
&gt;    1) it uses a closed black-box model for data storage, as far as MUA
&gt;       software is concerned. The only way an MUA can get to mail data is
&gt;       if it can talk IMAP. There are many situations where this is not
&gt;       helpful. I can provide examples if required. (In some situations this
&gt;       is an excellent idea, because it enforces a standard.)

As you say, it's a black box approach; one can either intercept the
data on the way in (I wrote some procmail type stuff using Python
and LMTP), or once it's in the message store (e.g. have an
"administrative" type account that has appropriate access to all
mailboxes, such as a post-updated virus check, then recurse across
that).

&gt;    2) it implements this black-box using the well-known Berkeley DB
&gt;       database (instead of the Maildir-like system it used to use.)

I never had the chance to use the Sleepycat DB on a highend server, but
did see that there were "ironing out" problems on the mailing list for
a while.  Mind you, they get to give it a good thrashing at a University
site.

&gt;    3) You can't avoid SASL for authentication. I think this is still a
&gt;       restriction (should check to make sure it is still true.) SASL is
&gt;       not one of the big standards around, meaning you have to write and
&gt;       maintain glue.

Sendmail has been running SASL for a while, so it's becoming common
glue (of course, that's if sendmail is your thang, which knowing Dan,
it ain't :-).  When I last looked (which was over 6 months ago) they
were trying to build PAM shims into SASL.  When I build my new home
firewall I'll have to see what's state of the art for Cyrus.

On the plus side, the ACL's on the mailboxes are cool.
