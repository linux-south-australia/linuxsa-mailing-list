Ian,

&gt; I think the distinction needs to be made between 'desktop' and 'server'
&gt; which many LinuxSA'ers assume all desktop machines should be run as.

I'm almost certain that even if you had 20 instances of X running then
only one copy of the X code would actually be referenced. That is to
say, as much of the memory that could be shared will be shared. 

&gt; Who cares about RAM, resource use, etc - only one person will be physically
&gt; using the machine at a time - 512 or even 384MB RAM seems to do the trick
&gt; for me.  512MB leaves plenty of RAM left over.

Use the spare RAM to tune your system then :-)

I find that if "vmstat" is reporting about 10Mb free then I don't see
any performance decreases due to pages swapping in and out from disk.
The only program that is capable of doing that is StarOffice 6.0, but
that is true bloatware.

&gt; I am sure Linux is smart enough to swap out what is not being used anyhow -
&gt; so only the active session (correct me if I am mistaken) will actually
&gt; reside in RAM.

To a certain extent, yes. But it doesn't just swap stuff out "because it
can". So, it may keep a lot of stuff lying about, then suddenly see it
needs some more space and then swap it out.

&gt; I want to get Windows XP and Linux running on two screens on my laptop -
&gt; that would be a cool party trick.  Be a good learning experience too..

Shouldn't be too hard :-)

And then you could give a talk at LinuxSA about it...
