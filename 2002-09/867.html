Quoting Dean Gawler &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dgawler@ihug.com.au">dgawler@ihug.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; Which prompts the question: is there such thing as a good quality, open
&gt; source GUI or curses based tool for sys admins that is reasonable cross
&gt; platform (i.e. Linux, Solaris, and maybe one other *NIX)?? I know it's a
&gt; big ask, but it would be Nirvana for busy admins in big IT shops.

The Gnome System Tools (gst) (which were the Ximian Setup Tools[xst]) are by no 
means complete, but allows user, group, date, time, network (including mounts 
and shares), X Server, bootloader, runlevel configuration.  

AFAICR, all major Linux distros were supported, along with Solaris and FreeBSD.

Last time I looked[1] they were aiming for a cute concept of snapshotting your 
systems configuration at a point in time, so if you know something was working 
say 1 week ago, you can move a slider and revert your configuration back.

But I'd have to say that it's definately not stable yet :)

[1] ...which was 6 months ago at least
