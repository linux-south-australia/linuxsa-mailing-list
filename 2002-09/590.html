&gt; &gt;&gt; What you are asserting is that it is wrong for you to be forced to buy
&gt; &gt;&gt; a  car from Ford, and be forced to pay for a Ford engine in it. You
&gt; &gt;&gt; should be  allowed to buy the car, minus engine, and then buy a reco
&gt; &gt;&gt; Jap engine and  add it in your self.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it can be more likened to buying a car from Ford and having
&gt; &gt; Ford put Mobil petrol & oil in it on the yard.  Ford won't sell you a
&gt; &gt; car without petrol & oil because you can't start it to drive it away,
&gt; &gt; but Ford have a contract with Mobil.  Too bad if I have decided that BP
&gt; &gt; products help the car run for much longer before requiring a major
&gt; &gt; engine overhaul.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (Note, I know nothing about Ford and Mobil or BP; it was just an
&gt; &gt; example).

After I sent the response, I realized that the analogy fails because Ford 
makes the engine (usually), while Toshiba simply buys in the OS from MS 
(who has a monopoly position, the DoJ proved that in court :-).

It is perhaps more like the tyres on the new car that you buy. Ford buys 
them from Bridgestone or whoever, and gives you no choice with a 
particular model.
 
&gt; Perhaps not, but it is the best analogy I've heard :)
