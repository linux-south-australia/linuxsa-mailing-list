&gt; real world use for dump.  And while people may that sparse files
&gt; are no longer used, it looks like tcpflow still uses them.

Sparse files have several really interesting uses. One I saw at the AUUG
conference was by Peter Chubb, he's simulating multiterrabyte filesystems
by loopback mounting a sparse file. This lets him mkfs a 2 Tb filesystem
without having that much hardware (after having fixed the many things in
Linux that prevented filesystems this large.)

Nevertheless, the notion of a utility having to understand intimate
filesystem implementation details in order to fully back it up runs
counter to Unix architecture, and counter to many modern
filesystem ideas.

For now, and with older Linux and BSD filesystems, that's what you have to
use. Linux users have choices of modern filesystems and BSD users have at
least one choice, and none of these new choices have a dump except for
XFS. All of them have ways of doing the same thing (I'm sure that includes
sparse files but I don't know how on JFS, reiser and friends.)
