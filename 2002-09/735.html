I think using Squid and a caching name server is a good idea - would this
cut down bandwidth use by much on a ADSL connection?

Ian,

[ You have receipt required turn on -- do you really need to? ]

&gt; For the benefit of us all - would you mind explaining how to allocate RAM
to
&gt; a process?  That sounds like a good idea - throw it at Mozilla, X, etc -
the
&gt; ones that can really benefit.  I never considered that.

Programs will take as much RAM as they need, no more and no less. I was
being a little fuzzy in my English -- I generally don't stuff my
spelling up but I can lose the meaning in my sentences sometimes -- if
there's something in a program that can improve performance but takes
RAM and you've got RAM then use it...

For example, Netscape and Mozilla both have in memory caches. I set mine
high.

You can instruct Gnome to keep menus in memory. I do because I don't
care about the RAM it takes.

Under Windows there is an option to sort of preload Star Office
partially, I don't know if there is under Linux. I don't use StarOffice
that much so I don't bother but if you were a heave user it could help
you.

I have Squid's cache memory options turned up high.

I run a local caching only name server.

It's a case of fidget with the programs you always use and fiddle with
them.
