Hi Evan,

As far as management is concerned Linux is inferior.  Their
computing world view is: e-mail client, word processing,
spreadsheets and presentations.  Microsoft have best-in-class
products in all of these areas.  Linux options are comparable
or worse (eg: compare Excel and Scalc).

So I totally understand a manager that might view MS favourably,
because from where they sit MS is the better platform.

It's up to IT staff that want to run Linux to make reasonable
arguments if they want to run Linux across an enterprsise.  This
is easiest where Linux is used for infrastructure applications.

For desktop applications the "technical superiority" argument
isn't true, so appeals need to be made to value for money.
Linux may not even compete on value for money -- the inconsistency
of the user interface adds significantly to training and support
costs.  One day's additional training for a Linux-based application
is enough to pay for a Windows OS+Office license.

For enterprises looking to save money there is another desktop
alternative: Windows OS + StarOffice.  Unless Linux makes some
significant user interface improvements I wouldn't expect to see
Linux + StarOffice deployments beyond what used to be the OS/2
market (banks, etc).

Regards,
Glen (who uses desktop Linux and OpenOffice extensively)
