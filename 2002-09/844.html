&gt; JFS2 has little to do with JFS1 except for the name. JFS2 came to Linux

&gt; the longer pedigree and much better credibility (SGI has made a lot of
&gt; storage sales on the basis of their fs, not their OS.)

Didn't know that myself! However, logging in to IBM's developerWorks
proved what you said. I presume that at the time IBM didn't want to give
away all of their tricks by opensourcing the AIX code.
 
&gt; I imagine most LinuxSA users can use any of the journalling filesystems
&gt; for small-scale use and find them all good. Unix pedigree doesn't count
&gt; for much if you're a casual home user.

Fair point. Horses for courses, etc... I tend to look at things from the
large end of town when it comes to *NIX solutions. It's that enterprise
IT background I guess :-)

For those with an interest in IBM/Linux, IBM announced today that they
will be shipping a line of pSeries highend servers with only Linux, and
AIX 5.1L won't be available for them! The writing is on the wall....

Dean
