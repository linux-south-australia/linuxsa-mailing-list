I came across this info on the net and used it to configure an isa scsi card. 
I  wonder if it may help. Ignore the references to Corel.

Q: How do I configure my ISA- PnP network card?

Corel LINUX OS 1.0 Users:
A: Issue the following command from a console screen as root :

/sbin/pnpdump &gt; /etc/isapnp.conf &lt;ENTER&gt;

This command scans your system for ISA-PnP devices and writes their resources 
into the /etc/isapnp.conf file. Open this file using the Text Editor 
(Application Starter | Applications | Utilities | Text Editor).

Look for lines similar to the following:

# Card 1: serial identifier 91 00 00 81 87 23 21 b0 4e
# VendorId SUP2123, Serial Number 33159, checksum 0x91
# Version 1.0, Vendor version 0.0
# ANSI string --&gt;3COM 3C509&lt;--

Each time you see the Card 1: heading, an ISA-PnP card has been found on the 
system. The ANSI string line should give you a good indication as to what 
card it is. Below these lines, you'll have some resources available for the 
device, similar to the following:

# (IO 0 (BASE 0x03f8))
# IRQ 4.
# High true, edge sensitive interrupt
# (INT 0 (IRQ 4 (MODE +E))) 

Remove the "#" symbols from the first and fourth lines. For example, if you 
wanted the system to use the values it lists above, you'd change the lines to 
match this: 

(IO 0 (BASE 0x03f8))
# IRQ 4.
# High true, edge sensitive interrupt
(INT 0 (IRQ 4 (MODE +E)))

This makes ISAPNPTOOLS configure the card using IRQ 4 and IO 0x3f8. Now search 
for the following lines at the end of this Card: section: 

# End dependent functions
# (ACT Y)

Remove the ‘#' symbols to make the settings take effect:

# End dependent functions
(ACT Y)

Save the file. Now see if this configuration is correct and ensure that it 
doesn't conflict with other hardware devices on the system. Type the 
following as root from a console screen:

/sbin/isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf &lt;ENTER&gt;

If you receive any errors, you'll need to go back into the file and change 
IRQ, IO or both. Then, save the file and try running this command again. You 
can use the Control Center to get an indication of what resources are 
currently being used on your system as a guideline. Repeat the above 
procedure until you find a combination that works.

&gt; Wow!
&gt;
&gt; First off, thanks for the deluge of help!
&gt;
&gt; Second off, I've tried the things mentioned by all.  I did exist during the
&gt; Dark Ages of Win3.1, (actually somewhat before that...I blush to admit that
&gt; I have coded in 8-bit 6502 code) so I was worried that the spectre of IRQ
&gt; conflicts was raising its ugly head once more.  And you lot seem to think
&gt; that is the case as well.
&gt;
&gt; What I did was:
&gt;
&gt; 1)  Pulled the bloody serial mouse out of the computer, just to simply
&gt; matters.  Don't know why I didn't beforehand ;P  I figure if I can make the
&gt; modem work, I can probably find a PS/2 mouse.  Budget be damned!  :)
&gt;
&gt; 2)  Turned on PNP.  Turned off PNP.  Shouted obscenities.  Tried once PNP
&gt; more.
&gt;
&gt; 3)  Disabled the second serial port in BIOS.
&gt;
&gt; 4)  Looked at "/sbin/lspci -v -b" (and cat /proc/pci).  Output seemed
&gt; identical and sadly "microelectronics" was not present.
&gt;
&gt; 5)  Did I mention the obscenities?
&gt;
&gt; 6)  Tried pnpdump.  Interestingly enough information about the modem does
&gt; indeed appear.  I am instructed to edit and uncomment the entries below to
&gt; achieve the correct configuration.  As I am unaware which of the three
&gt; different (?) configurations might be appropriate, this isn't too helpful.
&gt; I may as well admit that I am even unaware of how to edit out said
&gt; comments.
&gt;
&gt; 7)  "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create" once again.  Say...it seems to be pinging
&gt; the modem at ttyS1, which is comforting as the jumpers are set at COM2 and
&gt; I disabled ttyS1 through BIOS earlier.  However, it is time for obscenities
&gt; as three tries of ATQ0 V1 E1 yield nothing.  However, it does mention
&gt; setserial again, so I try "/bin/setserial /dev/ttyS1 uart 16550A port
&gt; 0x02f8 irq 3". I used IRQ 3 since that is where the jumpers on the modem
&gt; are set, and 02f8 since the boot messages seemed to indicate that was where
&gt; it found the 16550A at ttyS01.  But running "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create"
&gt; after trying that setserial string still got no modem response to the query
&gt; string.
&gt;
&gt; Odds and Sods Answered:
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it is an internal PCI modem.  I heartily agree with Romana's "internal
&gt; modems can be the devil in Linux:)".
&gt;
&gt; I have the usual two serial ports on the board and now have only the one
&gt; serial device (the modem) present.  It is a standalone linux system, but
&gt; the PNP enabled or disabled does not seem to make much of a difference.
&gt;
&gt; Oh - not once did kudzu admit that anything new was in the box.
&gt;
&gt; Random (and Probably Wrong) Thoughts:
&gt;
&gt; Would a more modern MB help?  It's actually 1997, not '99 as I originally
&gt; mentioned.  I thought modems had been pretty stable as hayes compatible for
&gt; awhile now, so should an older BIOS matter?
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I've worn off the gold on the contact constantly pulling it out and
&gt; fiddling with jumpers...
&gt;
&gt; Still appearing foolish, but am REALLY appreciating the kind time people
&gt; are sparing to hold my hand,
&gt; Tony
&gt;
&gt; :)
&gt;
&gt; PS - I did not try all the different COM jumper settings, as there should
&gt; no longer be a conflict since there is only ONE serial device present (and
&gt; port for the that matter...and PCI card actually).  Right?  Theoretically?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Tony,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; you have having the clasic IRQ conflicts. You said you have a serial
&gt;
&gt; mouse, which I take is on COM1 (/dev/ttyS0). Here is what you should do:
&gt; &gt; Disable COM2 in the bios of your MB.
&gt; &gt; Change the modem jumpers to COM2.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That should fix your problem, and you should see the modem on /dev/ttyS1.
&gt; &gt; If you dont see the modem, but the serial port does appear, then I would
&gt;
&gt; sugest that that scrounged part is no good !
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ben.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all!  I am both new to the list and to linux in general, so
&gt; &gt; &gt; please forgive me any particularly ignorant questions.  :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Both for the fun of it and because I'm a freelance web developer (who's
&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously been working in Windows lo these last few years), but since
&gt;
&gt; most
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; sites are deployed to linux servers I thought I'd build a linux box
&gt; &gt; &gt; with
&gt;
&gt; all
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the odds and sods of computers parts I've scrounged over the years.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, everything (RH 7.2) seems to be running smoothly...except for
&gt;
&gt; the
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; bloody modem.  I cannot get a response from it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The facts:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.  It is indeed a hardware modem, specifically Multi-Tech Systems
&gt;
&gt; Inc. -
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; MT5634ZPX-PCI.  According to the RedHat site
&gt; &gt; &gt; (<A HREF="http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename">http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename</A>=details&hid=422)
&gt;
&gt; it is
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; dead easy to install.  Which is somewhat humbling...and perhaps why I
&gt;
&gt; like
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the software end of things. :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.  Linux seems to recognize that it is installed, but just doesn't
&gt;
&gt; quite
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; admit that it is a modem and sticks it under "unknown" when I do a
&gt;
&gt; hardware
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; probe through KDE.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.  As per RH's instructions I tried "/sbin/lspci -v -b" to little
&gt;
&gt; comfort
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; as nothing resembling Microelectronics appeared.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.  Continuing onward into the fog, I then tried "/bin/setserial device
&gt;
&gt; uart
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 16550A port 0x02e8 irq 3" (I got the port and irq values from examining
&gt;
&gt; the
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; boot sequence messages) and promptly got an error.  To wit:  "device:
&gt; &gt; &gt; No such file or directory".  I then dropped out the word "device" from
&gt; &gt; &gt; the line, tried adding /dev/ttyS3 (again, as the boot messages seemed
&gt; &gt; &gt; to indicate that a device 16550A existed at ttyS3) and things seems to
&gt;
&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; At least I got no error messages at any rate.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5.  Sadly, despite the seeming progress, I still cannot get a modem
&gt; &gt; &gt; response.  Using KPPP I cannot get a response from /dev/ttyS3, nor
&gt; &gt; &gt; /dev/modem for that matter.  From the CLI, "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create"
&gt; &gt; &gt; merrily searches but cannot find a modem.   Yet, and this may actually
&gt;
&gt; be a
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; clue to those less clue-less than I, it ignores ttyS3 as it claims that
&gt; &gt; &gt; /dev/mouse/ points to that port.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Other interesting bits:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've got a serial mouse hooked up too, and in fact originally had some
&gt; &gt; &gt; trouble having a mouse and the modem in the computer at the same time.
&gt;
&gt; I
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; played with my BIOS (ancient BTW...1999, Pentium 200 board...told you I
&gt;
&gt; made
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; this thing from leftovers), and made serial2 02e8 rather than auto, and
&gt;
&gt; set
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; PNP OS to "no".  That seemed to allow both modem and mouse.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The modem jumpers are configured for IRQ3 and COM4.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Discussion:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Am I wrong in assuming that a 16650A device is a modem?  I admit that I
&gt;
&gt; am
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; blindly guessing that from the instructions on the Redhat site.  I am
&gt;
&gt; dimly
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; starting to suspect that it might actually just be a serial device...ie
&gt;
&gt; my
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; mouse.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have read through the HOW-TOs at
&gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.</A>  Sadly to little avail it
&gt;
&gt; would
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem.  Although the answer is probably buried in there, I am too
&gt;
&gt; ignorant to
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; spot it.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Any help that anyone can give this linux fledgling would be gratefully
&gt; &gt; &gt; received!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tony
