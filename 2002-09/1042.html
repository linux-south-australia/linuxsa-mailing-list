Jason,

&gt; That said... I am a Diploma student finishing this year and am wanting
&gt; workexperience in networking and help desk (I come pre packed with my own
&gt; sponsor and work cover insurance). I would very much like the opportunity to
&gt; experience the 'hands-on' IT environment. ANYONE ?

I can't guarantee you anything in the short term, but it's possible I
may need some assistance soon. I'll keep you in mind :-)

&gt; I do not want to get expelled so I stopped there... but... I would be most
&gt; happy to tell you that I also accessed the local control panel, registry and
&gt; administrative tools even though they are blocked to students. Yes I just
&gt; typed "control" in the 'run' menu and there it was.

Most of the students at TV-TAFE wouldn't bother about attempting to
crack the systems, but would rather study towards their course or play
FreeCiv because the materials being presented was too easy. Steve
Donaldson has already pointed out getting too strict with security could
impact learning, or "leaning" as he put it.

We need to remember that a system is NOT secure if it's NOT useable. If
it's so SECURE it's UNUSABLE then people WILL find a way to use the
system which often exposes them to more security flaws. If they can't
find a way around the security then your system is UNUSABLE which is a
wholly different concept to NOT SECURE.

&gt; Pity Linux is not installed on the workstations.

Providing there are no classes in the Linux Room (next to the
Cisco/Netware room) you're welcome to use the Linux computers there,
although you won't have Internet access. Today I was attempting to get
FreeBSD 4.3 to look like RedHat 7.1 just to trip up one of the other
PTI's (because I was feeling devious) but thought better of it and
reinstalled RedHat 7.1 ;-P
