It sounds like it could be a Right Path.

&gt; Can anyone with experience in this type of setup comment on any 
&gt; issues they struck while migrating from smbpasswd based systems
&gt; to central LDAP authentication.

These days I don't have many problems.

&gt; What version of OpenLDAP would you recommend?  2.0.x or 2.1.x? 
&gt; Pros/cons for either version?  I notice the schema file packaged with
&gt; Samba has support for 2.1.x.

I haven't noticed any problems with either myself. Typically, I'd install the
later version if I didn't have an existing install. I usually try to keep
everything on the same OpenLDAP major version (eg, 1.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x).

&gt; Were there any issues in migrating existing users, ie: file permissions,
&gt; profiles, etc?

It should be a straight migration from your old config to the new, with the
exception of the additions to the config file to do with ldap and the config
file options that can be moved into the LDAP directory (login script, home
directory, profile path, etc)

&gt; What is the speed like over a WAN environment for a local Samba box
&gt; to authenticate against a remote LDAP server, over say a 64k link?

I'd personally have a Samba / LDAP box at each end of the link where
possible. LDAP can take care of the replication for you, which is handy. You
may want to have a look at the Samba-BDC HOWTO in the samba source tree for
ideas along this line.

&gt; Any other comments?

Sorry, this mail's fairly brief. Got plenty to do before I fly to Sydney in a
few hours. If you'd like more info or whatever, feel free to e-mail me on or
off list and I'll try to get back to you later this week when I'm back.

thx,
Matt
