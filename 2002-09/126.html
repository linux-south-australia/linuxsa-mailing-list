Since David is fond of getting on his high horse and lavishing his own
peculiar wit in the form of criticism upon others, I thought "turn about
was fair play" in this case.

&gt; Well, well...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks to everyone ,who tried to help me
&gt; 
&gt; Our pleasure.

Smug!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; If I can help you in any way at all
&gt; &gt; in wood or glass ,please let me know.
&gt; 
&gt; I assume you are implying you can make goods out of wood and/or glass.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I did not join Linux SA to be insulted
&gt; &gt; by some one on an ego trip.
&gt; 
&gt; I should hope you never join the work force. I've come across
&gt; managers/superiors much more insulting than what was posted. And in the
&gt; real world you don't get a second chance.

Condescending!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, I can speak English ,my mother tongue.
&gt; &gt; Where I come from it is spoken in the local dialect . The BBC have given up
&gt; &gt; the quest to standardise the language spoken by over 55 million in the UK ,
&gt; &gt; English is a predator language ,it takes in anything it can get ,French
&gt; &gt; ,Indian ,and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; English, despite its shortcomings has survived for the reasons you
&gt; state. The ability to adapt is paramount to surivival.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is no so called correct way to pronounce or speak
&gt; &gt; English.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree. But unintelligble garbage will always be unintelligble garbage.
&gt; I didn't join LinuxSA to read intelligble garbage. Did you?

Petty!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The person that insulted me
&gt; 
&gt; DSL is a turing machine, and a good one at that. What person are you
&gt; talking about?

Egocentric! (and a liar!)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; should learn English, and maybe he
&gt; &gt; would be asking ,does such and such a word come from the Norse, or Saxon ,or
&gt; &gt; German ,which of course lots of English words do ,especially where I come
&gt; &gt; from ,and they are used in different ways and meanings now.
&gt; 
&gt; Surprisingly enough he does. He doesn't appear to see your point. He
&gt; pointed out that the original question was not well put, stated his
&gt; understanding of it and answered it. No amount of etymology will help
&gt; him understand unintelligble garbage.

Pedantic!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well after saying
&gt; &gt; that I wish to resign from Linux SA ,I will seek help from some one else .
&gt; 
&gt; See the very bottom of this message ;-P
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once again, thanks from those that didn,t have an axe to grind (english?)
&gt; 
&gt; I don't believe that we have to cater for the lowest common denominator.
&gt; I don't have a problem with people paying Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Sun
&gt; Microsystems for operating systems that are inferior to the free one I
&gt; happen to use most. I don't care if they pay hundreds of dollar for
&gt; support. In fact, in my opinion, if we start to make "Linux easier for
&gt; the masses" we'll end up with an technically superior product whose only
&gt; difference will be it costs nothing.

We already have that.

&gt; 
&gt; And then it's up to the marketing people to make the product successful.
&gt; And marketing requires MONEY not the GPL...
&gt; 

This next paragraph makes no sense!

&gt; I don't have an axe to grind. I am disappointed that there are people
&gt; [seeing you have avoided naming me specifically, I have decided to take
&gt; the tar off your brush] who seem to think posting difficult to
&gt; understand e-mails for help will actually receive a "polite" (for some
&gt; definition) answer. I have worked in kitchens before and what's been
&gt; said to me by head chefs and other mangers absolutely pales BIG TIME
&gt; compared to what I've said. It bemuses me, and amuses me, that there are
&gt; people who can write confusing material and EXPECT others to actually
&gt; understand it.

Are you saying that you flame people far more effectively than a grill
cook or front barman?

&gt; 
&gt; I set everyone a this subject for debate: That LinuxSA supports members
&gt; who are unable to express themselves clearly.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm quite happy to open the affirmative...I am very, very happy to open
&gt; the affirmative.
&gt; 
&gt; DSL
&gt; 

Now like DSL, I don't particularly care what others may think. I state
my own opinions and stand by them. I do however spend a great deal of
time on an irc #linuxhelp channel offering advice and support for our
much beloved operating system, and I'm aware of the many and varying
levels some newbies have of expressing their frustration and
difficulties at coming to terms with it. Sometimes the biggest obstacle
to resolving a linux problem is understanding what the question actually
is.

Now had DSL been paying attention to the list, (for his main focus
appears to be his own wit), he may have noticed Rob's apparent
trepidation at becoming a new computer user at the ripe old age of 60.
An age in fact I'm sure David would likely one day wish to achieve, but
his own conduct sometimes places in doubt.

The problem with David's answer was not his desire to help, but his
intention to consolidate his own position of superiority. Hoist him on
his own petard? I think David already has a far too elevated view of the
world. He needs to come down off his pedestal imho and see how "the
little people" live.

Now finally, I'm sure DSL will respond with some more of his witticisms,
but before you do, I don't care! You have your opinions which you feel
compelled to share with this list. So be it. I merely wished to say,
this is a open forum, where anyone may express their views, however
distasteful those views may be for some. It would be much nicer though
if we all tried to refrain from being deliberately hostile and
antagonistic. At times I think this list is more like an unruly irc
channel than a helpful forum where newbies can get the assistance they
so desperately require. No wonder so many decide they've had enough of
the crap. I've felt that way myself many many times.

So let's all get back to business shall we? Enough said.

Alex
