&gt; &gt; Although I lament Toshiba's stated position, I can't really find legal
&gt; &gt; fault.  They have offered a full refund, but not for the software alone.
&gt; &gt; They say that they are selling a product comprised of both hardware
&gt; &gt; and software, and that they can't (or won't) sell their product in
&gt; &gt; separate parts.  That's surely their right.
&gt; 
&gt; But at the end of the day, Toshiba sell computers.  The software that
&gt; you run on said computer is your own business.  So, why should I be
&gt; forced to pay for software (that Toshiba don't even make, they just sell
&gt; it because the evil empire is forcing them) that I'll never use.  They
&gt; surely can't justify that.

You are not forced to pay for software ... You are required to pay for a 
package that Toshiba sell. There are other machines you can buy out there 
that don't come with an OS. Let's face it, Toshiba don't sell the only 
laptops, or even the best laptops!

What you are asserting is that it is wrong for you to be forced to buy a 
car from Ford, and be forced to pay for a Ford engine in it. You should be 
allowed to buy the car, minus engine, and then buy a reco Jap engine and 
add it in your self.
 
&gt; They give you options on the same computer for screen, hard disk,
&gt; memory, etc, but they don't give you an option for what software you
&gt; have to run... "you can have any combination of hardware known to man
&gt; but you WILL run Windows on this machine".
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose you could liken it to saying that you want to buy the product
&gt; &gt; sans keyboard, and in which case probably they would sell you, not a
&gt; &gt; single product (laptop without keyboard), but a bunch of spare parts:
&gt; 
&gt; It may be their right not to sell you the product sans keyboard.  It
&gt; would be difficult, but how difficult is it _NOT_ to install Windows on
&gt; the computer before it's shipped? I rekon they save money there because
&gt; someone has to get windows into the machine before you get it!
&gt; 
&gt; 'scuse my rant.  It just fscks me right off that we are being forced to
&gt; pay for Windows with computers.  It's just going to get worse with the
&gt; new DRM (and Intel supposedly building it into hardware).  We'll be
&gt; forced to buy Windows just to turn the damn computer on.  

The answer is simple. Vote with your money. Don't buy from Toshiba. There 
are LapTops you can get that come sans an OS.
