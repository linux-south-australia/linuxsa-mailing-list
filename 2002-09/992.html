Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; 	The window manager is just the bit of software which "paints"
&gt; borders
&gt; 	around windows and lets you move, resize, iconify, etc your windows.
&gt; 	Basically it gives you "look and feel".
&gt; 
&gt; So why are the others so much faster?  For the first time I actually felt I
&gt; was running a fast computer..  It's just so damn quick - like you can see
&gt; those GHz ticking over.  Other Window managers (MS Windows included) never
&gt; seem to behave as though one is actually running a faster machine.

The window manager *just* does the "decorations" and window manipulation 
functions as Mark says.  Some are faster that others because they do less, or 
are because they're written in C instead of Lisp.  

*Desktop* environments run seperately, but often interact with WMs, making the 
whole experience appear to be a single entity, consistent but often slower 
(ie. "eye candy").  You can run KDE's window manager (kwm still?) without 
running KDE if you like.  Or you can run metacity or sawfish (from GNOME) 
without GNOME - they're just WMs.  Or you can run "e" or "BlackBox" or whatever 
under GNOME or KDE or none.

[snip]

&gt; Will VMWare run under a basic Window Manager like IceWm or Black Box?

You''ll find[1] that you probably don't even need a window manager to run 
VMWare or indeed any X application[2].  You may not find it very user friendly 
though :-)

Ciao,

Michael...

[1] I've never run VMWare without a WM.  Should be boring.
[2] At your ?dm login window go in via "safe mode" and start up your app.  Or 
exec an xterm in your .xinitrc/.xsession instead of a WM and start it from 
there.
