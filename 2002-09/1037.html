Computing Science historically was a degree in maths majoring in CS, I believe.
The problems with universities now are due to the enormous pressure they have
been put under.  As a consequence the quality of all degrees are dropping. 

Students are paying customers, the customer is always right.  Undergraduates
used to be humble & accept staff decisions.  

A four year degree now costs ~$20,000 which is indexed with the CPI until paid
off.  Now students front up with lawyers because thought they should have got
60% and not 55% for a subject they passed anyway.  The lawyer could be cheaper
than the extra HECs incurred repeating a subject, extra time to complete & loss
of income.

The current mercenary culture results in more students chasing the bit of paper
to earn a salary & pay off debt, not because they had any interest in what they
are studying. They can choose to study elsewhere or do a course externally.
This includes overseas students whom can easily change to Singapore, NZ or HK.
The tertiary institutions compete fairly aggressively for student numbers to
maintain funding  (another pressure not to fail students), and escape Minister
Brendon Nelson's hatchet. 

This suits the Liberal and Labour because it lowers unemployment of youth,
which pay HECS instead, for compromised qualifications. Tertiary students are
getting a rough deal however the spin-doctors disguise it. 

Australia the clever country - The knowledge nation - The media marketing era.

&gt;&gt;I think that is specific to Flinders I too have my Bsc From there and
&gt;&gt;when I did some postgrad stuff I was stunned as to the lack of
&gt;&gt;compulsory maths but their focus is industry centric and they feel the
&gt;&gt;higher maths should be optional. Don't forget there are a number of IT
&gt;&gt;degrees on offer which have the core CS in all of them but the optional
&gt;&gt;subjects vary widely including the ability to do higher maths like the
&gt;&gt;degree I got.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I understand the university's need to offer industry centric IT degrees
&gt; but I don't think they should be butchering their BSc Comp Sci course to
&gt; do that.
&gt; 
&gt; My point of view is that the Bachelor of Information Technology degree is
&gt; a more industry centric IT course and students who want a more industry
&gt; focused course should choose that one. To me, BSc Comp Sci means something
&gt; specific and if Flinders Uni are handing them out without maths, I don't
&gt; think that is a BSc Comp Sci. They should call it something else. It
&gt; dilutes what BSc Comp Sci really is.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, this is just my point of view.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers.

I'm not sure of the historical significance of BSc Comp Sci but I would 
have thought it should be focussed on "comp sci". If you want a BSc in 
"maths _and_ comp sci" then do that (isn't that what they call it ad 
Adelaide uni?). I would think that having taken all available CS topics 
would do the opposite of diluting a CS major.
I personally chose a BSc initially, because I still wasn't sure what I 
wanted to do (Phys/Chem/Comp Sci). I refused to do the pretend Comp Sci 
yr 11/12 subjects that were on offer (remember Hypertext on Mac? :p). 
But once I had done Maths, Phys, Chem and CS in first year, I realised 
that Comp Sci was what I wanted. (I never wanted a Maths degree, and 
only did maths subjects because most majors required it, at least at 1st 
year level.)
