&gt;&gt;I personally hate advanced maths (even more so because I was forced to 
&gt;&gt;do it at uni), and by the time I got to uni I had had enough of it, 
&gt;&gt;luckilly 1st year Maths was just a repeat of Maths 1&2 at yr 12. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hey, I don't claim to have _liked_ doing Maths.  I did Ma&CompSc at UofA so 
&gt; I _did_ a _lot_ of Maths as part of my degree.
&gt; 
&gt; However, that aside, I did put some effort into it (admittedly only a Credit 
&gt; average effort).   
&gt; 
&gt; The benefit of this was that I did some subjects with very relevant topics:
&gt; - set theory
&gt; - dynamic modeling 
&gt; - various things relating to crypto.
&gt; - logic (eg. turing machines)
&gt; - numerical analysis/methods.
&gt; 
&gt; All of these made me better at CS.  (Actually NA/NM are/were CS subjects - 
&gt; and they fricking hurt my head).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;_I_ am sick of being told to study something I find boring, and that I 
&gt;&gt;can see no immediate use for. If I can't use it I wont remember it. I 
&gt;&gt;would much rather hone my problem solving skills solving problems I have 
&gt;&gt;some interest in.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that:
&gt; - the areas you're interested in may not expand your problem solving skills 
&gt; in the way that will really help you.

They will help more that SVC did - I learned _nothing_ from doing that 
subject.

&gt; - Immediate use is a crock.  There are many things I learnt at Uni in 
&gt; subjects that I did NOT enjoy that many years later became very relevant.  

This is a matter of how I learn. The biggest thing I learned at Uni is 
how to cram and forget things I had no interest in. Things I enjoyed and 
used I retained, things I crammed I didn't retain. My company often gets 
people to do courses. This works for some, for me - I learn something 
when I need to use it, not before. YMMV.

&gt; - As a student doing a degree you may not be in the best position to 
&gt; decide what's really worth doing, because you do not have the benefit of 
&gt; hindsight after having completed your degree.
&gt; 

I have the benefit of hindsight now, and my observation is that it was 
pointless me doing things that I couldn't apply in any way to what 
interested me. If particular mathematics are a benefit to computing then 
they should be taught in that context, as Numerical Methods and Binary 
Logic already are.

&gt; As an example, some of the things I did in Maths helped me understand and 
&gt; therefore provide a better solution for a customer at DSTO, not because I 
&gt; really need to know it, but merely because by understanding his problem 
&gt; better the solution fitted it more closely.  How the heck would I have known 
&gt; if this was relevant 6 year prior when I was doing the subject?  Having done 
&gt; Chemistry at uni (at a 1st year level) helped me understand customers trying 
&gt; to run big simulations for deriving molecular shapes.  I didn't need to, but 
&gt; it helped me provide a better solutions. etc etc.
&gt; 

I did Physics and Chem also, because I wanted to. And so they may also 
help me in jobs I do, but again, they are not required elements of a CS 
degree, in fact I also have been useful to a DSTO client because, of all 
things, I could handle complex numbers.
Anything you do has the possiblity of being useful in a different 
context, but I still dont see why Maths should be chosen over any other 
discipline to be forced on those who want to do CS (apart from Maths 
that is relevant to CS). If you don't know it is relevant at the time 
there is no justification to enforce it. Would you object to a 
requirement that you speak Japanese, that you play the Violin at some 
arbitrary standard, and that you be able to brew your own beer - before 
you can complete a degree in computer science? I can invent situations 
where these would be relevant to a future job in CS, but that is not a 
justification to including it in a CS course.

&gt; If you would rather skip boring things altogether then I'm not sure how you 
&gt; cope with life.  I often do boring things just so I can do the interesting 
&gt; things later.  
&gt; 
I do boring things that lead to interesting things, or are necessary. My 
point is that no one has ever given me any indication of how SVC helps 
me in my CS interests. If you spend all of your time doing boring things 
that don't interest you and have no obvious benefit to things you _do_ 
want to do than I can't see how _you_ cope with life.
I spend my time trying to decrease the drugery and improve the 
enjoyment. I have learned my lesson - if I see no use for something, and 
it doesn't interest me, then I know studying it will be a waste of my 
time. When I discover I need it - then I learn it, because then it will 
stick.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Precisely, let me do a CS major. This implies I want to do CS subjects 
&gt;&gt;as the core and then I can choose what else I do to fill out the 
&gt;&gt;remaining units. (If I wanted Ma&CS I would have done what you did :) )
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; See above.
