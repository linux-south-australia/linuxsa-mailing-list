If it makes you happy you can GPL it if you like.

Actually I think you'll find that you don't know the licenses you write of
terribly well either (which is true of most free software people.) If I
understood you correctly you said Apache was under the GPL, whereas the
authors have tried as hard as they can to make sure that it is not! But it
hasn't hindered progress as far as I can see because the momentum in the
public project is just too big. Ditto Perl, which is under a completely
non-GPL-like license.

Please do continue to be enthusiastic about free software and free
licenses, but I caution against getting too excited about how the clarity
of the GPL has made good things happen. One very important (and completely
non-technical) thing that the GPL has done is provoke Microsoft into
making some really public attacks, including revealing the personal anger
of top executives. I'm not referring to the Halloween documents which had
little to do with licensing differences, but rather the history of FUD so
overdone that non-computing people easily saw it was FUD. This did a great
deal for Linux marketing. The days of unreasoning attacks from Microsoft
may be over now, more's the pity :-)

For what its worth, here's some other little-known random facts about
licensing:

1) Pine and its stablemate software is not open or free by any definition
(you can't redistribute modified versions, nor can you distribute it for
profit)

2) Qmail is not free software by any definition (source code distribution
is forbidden without permission from one person. You can't only distribute
patches.)

3) There is non-GPL code in the Linux kernel tree (see Bdale's challenge
to kernel hackers at the last Ottowa summit. Nobody seems to have a
solution for this yet.)

4) Linus has given his personal interpretation of the GPL that he
considers governs how people can use the Linux source code with
closed-source kernel code.

5) The much-maligned QPL that the Qt toolkit used to be distributed under
was intended by TrollTech to be superceded by the GPL3 (once the Trolls
decided to release under something other than the QPL at all, which was a
long and messy story.) However the GPL3 became late by many years, and
there was so much flamage, largely uninformed, that they went with the
GPL2 instead.

6) The original BSD license with an advertising clause is well known but
not many people seem to know about the BSD2 license, which is about three
years old. BSD2 removes the advertising clause. I _think_ that all BSD1
code can be rebranded as BSD2, but I haven't heard anyone with legal
credentials say that is the case for sure. In fact I have never met anyone
who can tell me how all the dozens of licenses in a BSD distribution
interact. (Nor anyone that really cares.)

7) There are drivers in the FreeBSD kernel source tree under the GPL
license.

8) There are kernel drivers which are common to both Linux and FreeBSD
(such as the tun module I demonstrated at the last LinuxSA meeting.)

9) The author of a piece of GPL code can release that code under as many
licenses as he wants including utterly closed-source commercial. See the
README for reiserfs (GPL'd and in the Linux kernel tree) to see the
logical conclusion of this. It pokes fun at the people who are silly
enough to pay Hans for closed-source versions of Reiserfs but also
preserves the right for him to do so even with contributions by third
parties (who can of course circumvent Hans according to the GPl but then
their code will be something other than Reiserfs, which has momentum,
marketing and funding.)

10) According to source code surveys the percentage of [L]GPL'd code in
distributions is increasing over time fairly rapidly.

11) GPL software can be sold for lots of money, and the people who wrote
the GPL encourage the price to be as high as you can possibly make it.
Lots of people erroneously think that the GPL encourages software to be
sold on a cost-recovery basis or even given away.

12) If you really want to conduct such a pointless exercise, you can
relicense an entire BSD-licensed source tree under the GPL without asking
anyone's permission

13) The Wine project recently changed from a BSD license to the LGPL
license based on a vote by developers, originally prompted by
strongly-justifiable commercial reasons. (see next point)

14) The Wine project recently had a minor fork (ie, many people didn't
join the forked version) to attempt to maintain a Wine tree under the BSD
license, prompted by strongly-justifiable commercial reasons.  (see
previous point.)

&gt; Fine, everybody has his reasons.  When I started using Linux, it
&gt; wasn't under the GPL.  That came later. 

Yep. Back in those days it compiled as C++ as well as C. Lots of people
were sad when that got broken.

Linus sometimes describes GPLing the kernel as the best thing he ever did
to it. I suggest that the strongest supporting facts for this have to do
with perception, marketing and ideological things including the support of
the FSF.

&gt; I contend that most people who use open source software don't even
&gt; know the differences between the licenses:

Lots of people who write code under open source licenses don't really know
the differences either. And of those that do, many don't know about the
bigger implications of the international legal framework, copyright
registration for example (which most have never done and many cannot
afford to do... its a long ugly story.)
