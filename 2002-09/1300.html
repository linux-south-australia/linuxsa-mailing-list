&gt; It should be a straight migration from your old config to the new, with the
&gt; exception of the additions to the config file to do with ldap and the config
&gt; file options that can be moved into the LDAP directory (login script, home
&gt; directory, profile path, etc)

If you are planning to merge what are currently separate domains, with 
different SIDs, into one domain, then you might have some problems with 
profiles.

Secondly, there is no support yet in the 2.2.x stream for changing your 
domain SID, and since the SID is stored in the secrets.tdb file, this 
might create problems (they need the same DOMAIN SID) as you might have to 
use a binary editor on those files.

Were you planning to create one domain with one Samba server as a PDC and 
the others as BDCs? This is possible. However, a number of things have to 
be right and have to be set up. Profiles are one issue in this case, but 
there is code in Wine that might be usable to rummage through the 
NTUSER.dat and change the security descriptor so that the SID of the user 
matches the new domain.

Under the soon to be released Samba 3.0.0 (Nov/Dec looks good at the 
moment), you will be able to do:

  net setlocalsid S-1-5-21-x-y-z 

to set the SID on a machine, and 

  net getlocalsid [NAME] 

to retrieve the SID of the current name or any past name of the server 
(which is handy in those cases where you needed to change the name of your 
PDC, but don't want to have to rejoin the domain on all your clients).
