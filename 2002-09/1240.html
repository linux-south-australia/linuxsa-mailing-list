That was, arguably, the most important point I was trying to make.

&gt; Without the GPL license would Linux/OSS be in the position we are now?
&gt; Would Apache and Samba, the key utils, be little more than a shadow of
&gt; what they are now without Linux? IMHO Apache and Samba followed the
&gt; driving force of Linux. Apache and Samba are great partners but should
&gt; not be held up in front of Linux as if they were responsible for where
&gt; we are now. That is IMO a disservice.

What happens these days is cross fertilization and amplification. As an 
example, a few weeks ago now there was some intense work on getting GSSAPI 
and SPNEGO and NTLMSSP support into Ethereal. That then lead us to add 
such client support to Samba. Similarly, work done by Volker on allowing 
Samba to migrate domains off of NT, which was based on work done by Andrew 
Tridgell in pulling the SAM with samsync was then extended to allow people 
to figure out their SIDs if they changed the name of their Samba server, 
and work done on sendfile lead the Samba team to add sendfile support and 
so on.

We all see what each other are doing, and can try new things based on the 
new code, and we do it very quickly. 

I think that they have had a circular influence on each other. Without 
Linux and FreeBSD, Samba and Apache and so forth would not be where they 
are today, and without Samba and Apache and so fort, I think that Linux 
and FreeBSD would not be where they are today.
 
&gt; So, Linux people, care to tell the list what attracts you to Linux?

I was first attracted to Linux, around 91/92 because I thought that it was 
neat that it was neat that this guy in Finland had started developing an 
OS and we could all contribute. I spent a lot of time working with Linux 
but never did any kernel work in that time. 

I started working with FreeBSD because my current employer uses it (we 
also do Linux kernel work as well, because a very important set of 
potential customers use Linux clusters), and I find the Linux kernel 
source much easier to understand. However, I still use Linux as well.
