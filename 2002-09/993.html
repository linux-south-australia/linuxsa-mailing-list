Some are better-written than others.

 &gt; It's just so damn quick - like you can see
 &gt; those GHz ticking over.  Other Window managers (MS Windows included) never
 &gt; seem to behave as though one is actually running a faster machine.

There's a basic architectural difference between UNIX GUIs and Microsoft
GUIs.

Under UNIX, the GUI is essentially an application.  You run the X server
program to start up X-windows, then you run other applications to provide
look-and-feel services, iconic interfaces, etc.  The applications all
communicate with the GUI over socket connections, so it's second nature
for an app to be running on one side of the world with all its GUI
interaction coming from the other side of the world.

Under MS operating systems, the GUI is part of the kernel, built-in to 
the operating system.  This tends to obliterate a lot of flexibility:
Under UNIX, if you want a better, stronger, faster GUI you just run a
different "GUI application".  Under Windows, you're pretty much stuck
with whatever Uncle Bill has decided to give you.  And since the GUI is
built in to the low-level innards of the kernel, you can't communicate
it unless you also have access to the low-level innards of the kernel 
(i.e., talking to it over a network is needlessly difficult).  And finally,
because the Windows GUI is in the low-level innards of the kernel, 
GUI security issues expose the entire machine to vulnerabilities.

That said, most people don't (a) understand, or (b) use the flexibility
which UNIX windowing systems provide, so the architectural differences
don't generally mean much in the real world until you reach "turbogeek"
status.

Finally:  Take out your stopwatch and time how long it takes for your
applications to do various things under different desktop environments.
You'll probably find no difference at all;  You're just believing that
one is faster than the other because its response time is shorter
(that's why the Mac uses GUI tricks like "exploding windows" when
you launch an application:  By doing something to the GUI -immediately-
when you ask for an action, it provides the perception of being faster
even if it's doing something which takes a long time to happen).

IBM did some human-factors research back in the '70s which concluded
that users will conclude that a computer is slow if it takes more than
one third of a second to react on the screen after they've pressed a 
key, regardless of how fast the computer actually is;  and, conversely,
you can make a slow computer "feel" faster by using GUI tricks like
"Please Wait" screens and hourglass cursors even if it's extremely slow.

 &gt; 	startx /usr/X11R6/bin/windowmaker -- :1  (for example) will work.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Brilliant!

That's starting another instance of the X-Windows application and
the window manager application.

FWIW, you can run a second instance of GNOME by replacing the 
"/usr/X11R6/bin/windowmaker" bit with, say, "/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session".
Or you can run another instance of whatever desktop you usually run by
replacing it with "sh $HOME/.xsession"

 &gt; Nothing extreme about two OS's running in tandem - today's desktop machines
 &gt; with a good chunk of RAM seem to be able to handle that kind of thing no
 &gt; problem.
 &gt; Will VMWare run under a basic Window Manager like IceWm or Black Box?

UNIX GUI-based programs don't care what window managaer is running
(there are a handful of exceptions, but you need to go to special effort
to make an application give a damn about the window manager;  usually
the WM is pretty invisible to the application developer).

So there's no reason why you can't run VMWare under any WM you like.
What's more, you can probably even run it with no window manager at
all :-)
