Richard,

&gt; Hmmm, there seems to be a major disconnect with reality here. Binary files
&gt; from versions prior to GCC 3.0 should still link against stuff compiled
&gt; with GCC 3.0 and beyond. I doubt that they [GCC developers] will have
&gt; changed that.

Yes, but if one is ultra-paranoid and if one's data is worth, say, $5000
per hour of uptime, then I wouldn't trust a binary built with a GCC with
a different major number. It would be begging for trouble in my opinion.

&gt; Secondly, code that compiled under versions of GCC earlier than 3.0 should
&gt; still compile, albeit with more warnings or the need to add extra flags to
&gt; relax checks that are now done.

The XFS development team have fallen over a few potholes. I can't name
which ones but I've seen that it has caused a little bit of grief. MySQL
can do funnies when built under GCC 3.X as well.

&gt; &gt; a) I had to (eg it was closed source and the company who build it are
&gt; &gt; being obstropolous)
&gt; 
&gt; I think the word you were searching for is obstreperous. However, I might
&gt; be wrong.

...however I have heard it used in Australian colloquialism to mean
"being difficult and loud about something. I'm often described as
obstreperous ;-P
