 &gt; &gt; My point of view is that the Bachelor of Information Technology degree is
 &gt; &gt; a more industry centric IT course and students who want a more industry
 &gt; &gt; focused course should choose that one. To me, BSc Comp Sci means something
 &gt; &gt; specific and if Flinders Uni are handing them out without maths, I don't
 &gt; &gt; think that is a BSc Comp Sci. They should call it something else. It
 &gt; &gt; dilutes what BSc Comp Sci really is.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I'm not sure of the historical significance of BSc Comp Sci but I would 
 &gt; have thought it should be focussed on "comp sci".

The problem is that without the mathematical background you tend to
end up with "comp" rather than "comp sci".

I hated doing maths as much as anyone, but I can see why they included 
it.

Now, during the last ten years the public perception of universities
has changed:  They're now seen as teaching institutions, which is a 
shame, because universities have -never- been teaching institutions,
they've been research institutions which did a bit of teaching on 
the side to inspire more researchers to enter the field.

Now they're just job-shops:  "Enhanced TAFE", and for the first time 
in history people are expecting universities to be "industry relevent",
as if universities are supposed to care about industry.  And with the
Government shrinking funding, this tendancy is being reinforced by
the fact that universities actually do need to care about industry
to get money (again, for the first time in our history).

So they offer industry-focussed courses.  And because industry doesn't
give a damn about science, and very few companies have ever advertised
a vacancy for a "computer scientist" (they'd hire B.Sc graduates and
then spend a couple of years retraining the employee to turn them from
a scientist into an engineer).  So the universities find themselves
teaching about Visual Basic and Excel macros instead of doing actual
*computer science*.

So anyway, that's the critical difference between a Bachelor of Information
Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science:  The former
degree gives you a job qualification, and the latter degree teaches you
to be a scientist (which is almost useless in the commercial world).

 &gt; If you want a BSc in "maths _and_ comp sci" then do that

No -- if you want a degree in Comp Sci, then you need to accept that
Mathematics is essential for just about every aspect of science that you
can think of.  Computer Science != Computing.

Biology is just applied chemistry;  Chemistry and Engineering are just
applied physics.  Physics and computer science are just applied
mathematics.  Maths is at the root of all the sciences.  

Designing algorithms is an aspect of applied mathematics;  that's
what Computer Scientists do.  Writing software to efficiently and
correctly implement algorithms which someone else has designed is
what Bachelor of IT graduates do :-)
