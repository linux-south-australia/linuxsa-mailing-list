List,
I don't think people really expected the uni had become a sub-branch of MS. 

If you look at it rationally though the management of the
network/services/support in an organisation of this size is not something
that can or will change overnight about the only thing that can is the
location of the respective boxes. 

In all instances and I think at some point someone will stand up and say we
need to standardise our setup for economies of scale. The CS and
Engineeering will probably be exempt being allowed to run their own setups
providing variety for teaching purposes whereas the users with PCs whose
sole purpose is WP/Spreadsheets/Calender will benefit from one common
approach. Be it MS or Linux or (insert flavour here) for those of us in the
'business world' we have all seen this. 

The choice of an individual to use an alternative O/S setup will probably
be at their discretion and if they are cluey enough to say I need to use an
open source based system then they are probably in a better position to
look after themselves than the person who wants to use the office based
software.

I also feel no matter how much we hate/like MS there is a degree of comfort
for management chosing MS rather than a technically superior alternative
(similar to the IBM mentality 20 years ago - no one got fired buying IBM)

&gt;A little knowledge and a touch of gossip adds up to pure crap.
&gt;
&gt;Firstly i am not affiliated with ITS ( the central university It service ) 
&gt;I work for a department.
&gt;
&gt;This is absolutely rubbish. Yes some servers are being moved to ITS. But 
&gt;they are remaining the same platform as they are now. ie MS re remaining MS 
&gt;and Linux etc is remaining Linux etc.
&gt;
&gt;Yes we have some MS servers ( not me personally - rather chew my own arm 
&gt;off ) but this is because the programs needed for course work is only 
&gt;available  under a MS platform. eg the language labs, and the business
school.
&gt;
&gt;As for the Cs Dept there has been no change at all. There is at least half 
&gt;a dozen different platforms for students to work from. Not to mention some 
&gt;very large clusters ( one of which is ours ) ALL RUNNING *NIX
&gt;
&gt;So lets not listen to rumours.
&gt;

&gt;&gt;I have been asked to clarify my previous comment;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; from what I have heard from the inside Uni of Adelaide is no great 
&gt;&gt; example &gt; with their 'destroy Linux/Macs at all costs' program.
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now that the ITS people have taken over the Uni networking, many Linux and
&gt;&gt;Mac Servers have been pulled out and networks migrated across the road so
&gt;&gt;it is all in the 'one shop' and running on MS servers. The word I get is
&gt;&gt;that ITS wants all servers to be running MS and all based in ITS across the
&gt;&gt;road from the Uni itself. That all the traffic has to run through the
&gt;&gt;'pipe' under the road now instead of happily working inside/alongside the
&gt;&gt;area that the servers used to serve is just another way to put all the IT
&gt;&gt;eggs into the one basket. Heavy users may have their own servers due to
&gt;&gt;bandwidth problems in the ITS pipe but this will be the exception to the
&gt;&gt;rule and they still wont be allowed to run Linux. Fancy that, a University
&gt;&gt;without a Linux/UN*X Server, who would have thought that day might come?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have heard that ITS will not be supporting any Mac applications nor any
&gt;&gt;Linux/Unix applications. If you want ITS support then run MS. If your
&gt;&gt;Department has stacks of $$s and you want to control your own destiny then
&gt;&gt;buy in your own servers and buy in your own support.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The effect of the 'kill Mac' attitude on the Mac-sensitive Departments such
&gt;&gt;as Architecture and Multimedia is to say the least disheartening. The story
&gt;&gt;is that they are scrambling to find equivalent PC - MS based applications
&gt;&gt;because they have been told to get rid of their Macs.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Maybe ITS could promote themselves as "ITS - an EDS Clone". This is the
&gt;&gt;price of progress.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I may be wrong, or just mistaken on some of this, I am not as closely
&gt;&gt;linked to Uni of Adelaide anymore.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Cheers,  Ian
