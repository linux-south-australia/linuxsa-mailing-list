&gt; Just a note that my friend has not been able to get iHUG to work at all 
&gt; on his mandrake 8.2 distribution (whereas others have worked fine), 
&gt; anyone else running linux and connecting to ihug? They seem to have a 
&gt; weird setup (they're supposedly a pretty poor ISP anyway).

Hi,

I got my Suse7.3 to connect to IHUG first try.  It's not a Linux issue
with the modem not reporting connect.  Windows has the same problem a
lot of the time when I try connect under that.

I've narrowed it down to either IHUG having a dodgy setup, or my modem
being dodgy.  That said, I now have a dialup account to work and have
not had any problems with that so far.

I suggest complaining to IHUG about it and seeing what they say.  They
claim to be Linux friendly, but I'd sugggest avoiding that issue and
just working under Windows while you prove to them that it's their
setup.

Cheers,
Adam
