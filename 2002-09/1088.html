David,

You hit the nail on the head there:

"If he's used Windows then provided you explain that "The foot is the
same as the `Start'" button he'll be fine. Set him up a Window Manager
theme that looks like Windows but show him how to customize it (i.e.
play around) as well. Lots of Windows users, once they discover how
configurable X and the various Window Managers are, waste oodles of
hours playing around with their new found freedom... And then they tell 
their friends how good Linux can be which is the result we want, eh?"

Getting true type fonts to work under Mandrake is dead easy - just press the
'use Windows fonts button' under the font configuration screen. But the
issue is font smoothing (anti-aliasing) which unfortunately Windows XP
EXCELS at (largely because of the proprietary code MS has access too that
Linux developers do not) - it's like looking at paper it is so clear on my
laptop screen.  Font smoothing is for some reason incredibly hard to do with
open source coding (hence why it has taken so long to make an appearance in
LinuxLand).

But if all he wants to do is write his life story and have the computer
ready and waiting 24x7 (so I can run my stuff in the background) I am not
sure he will give a flying rat as long as it works.  At least it won't crash
and lose everything and get annoying viruses and the like.  I do have Word
XP which is very nice - but perhaps the simplicity of Star Office is
actually preferably for many users?  MS Word is great - but a bit
complicated at times.

Yeah - I would like a copy of Star Office (which is better than open office?
I have heard they are not terribly different - just in support, etc).  I
will see if my housemate will be happy using that over MS Word (which I
suspect he will be).

If this works - I will eventually set up thin clients for family,
housemates, whatever for internet and word processing..

Ian,

You can get your Windows True Type Fonts to work under X. I believe
Gnome 2.0 has font anti-aliasing (or is it aliasing). I don't know how
to convince Star Office to use the X Server Fonts; it seems to have its
own.

Once it starts it's fine; it's the startup that takes time.
