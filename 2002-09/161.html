Wei.

I'm not exactly sure what you're asking.  I think this describes your
network:

   +---+
   | A 1---+
   +---+   |
           |
   +---+   |   +---+   +---+
   | B 2---+---4 D 5---6 E |---&lt;telephone line&gt;---
   +---+   |   +---+   +---+
           |
   +---+   |
   | C 3---+
   +---+

A, B and C are internal clients and servers, with interfaces 1, 2 an
3 respectively.  D is your external server, with internal interface
4 and external interface 5.  E is your ADSL modem, with interface 6.
I think you are asking if (say) A can find the address of 5.

I gather that D is a "closed appliance", that you can configure using
HTTP, and therefore you can see the address you seek using a browser but
you want to discover it using C.  There is no "standard" way, not even a
"right" way, to do this, but a couple of ideas spring to mind.

One fun way, which sadly is more likely to give you 6's address than 5's,
is to discover it using a traceroute like program.  You send a packet
with a small ttl to a distant address and see what address sends you
back an ICMP TTL EXCEEDED error.  A ttl of 1 or 2 is likely to do the
trick, but you could send multiple packets, starting with a ttl of 1 and
increasing for subsequent packets (as traceroute does), and stop when
you see a change of network.  If any of this idea is gibberish to you
then don't even bother with it.  It's a fun idea but somewhat esoteric,
and as I said, likely to yield the address of 6.  Close but no cigar.

Which brings us back to the other idea that springs immediately to mind.
Open a connection to D's HTTP port, send down the appropriate sequence
necessary to retrieve the address you seek, and parse the output from D.

Regards,

David
