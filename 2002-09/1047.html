Red Hat is more secure too right?  My housemate also wants to use my old
computer - so I was thinking of setting it up running VMWare permanently in
one console for MS Word, etc - I know it is not a good idea (until I can get
another machine I can dedicate to firewall tasks) but would an old PIII 450
with 512MB RAM handle firewall / caching and running VMWare through IceWM?

I think I will do it with Red Hat - that is more stable than Mandrake too I
hear - and I keep Mandrake for the desktop / GUI stuff.

Ian, it is really worth it to install without a GUI. Redhat has really
good DOCS and after becoming comfortable with command line, nothin beats
it.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; I think you are right that I should build it myself from scratch - and
maybe
&gt; put a small window manager like Ice or something on instead of KDE - just
&gt; for quick and easy graphical representation and for screen layout (fit
more
&gt; info on the screen at any one time).
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a good distribution for this?  Would Gentoo suffice?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Ian,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I want to set up a dedicated firewall / proxy - cache on an old machine
to
&gt; &gt; run via wireless to my laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds good.
&gt; 
&gt; Did you know that the InstallFest 2002 Unplugges (1) has an emphasis on
&gt; wireless networking?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Any ideas on the best way to go about this?  What is Smoothwall like?
Can
&gt; &gt; it produce pretty graphs and lots of statistics?  I want to take the
&gt; &gt; opportunity to learn more about networking.
&gt; 
&gt; Then don't use Smoothwall or IPCop; if your objective is to learn about
&gt; something, don't use a tool that does it for you. Get a base
&gt; distribution -- and contrary to popular opinion they will all be just as
&gt; good as each other at the end of the day -- and get your fingers dirty.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I know Mandrake firewall can
&gt; &gt; produce a lot of graphs and statistics and looks quite good but it is
also
&gt; &gt; quite dated.
&gt; 
&gt; And what does putting a CD into the CDROM drive and clicking a few
&gt; buttons teach you?
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; Is there much difference (as far as the desktop is concerned) between
&gt; &gt; Smoothwall GPL and Smoothwall retail (corporate)?)
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think so -- and you still get the same, ever so polite
&gt; maintainer.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone have any ideas for good reporting software for Squid?  I
have
&gt; &gt; Calimaris installed and this works great (if it were not for Squid
&gt; emptying
&gt; &gt; my access.log upon reboot) but it is all in text - how can I produce a
&gt; &gt; graphical representation of all this?
&gt; 
&gt; Visit:
&gt; 
&gt; * <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; ...I'm sure I saw some fancy graphics hooha there.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In Mandrake 8.2 - Portsentry seems to have disappeared to be replaced
with
&gt; &gt; Prelude?  Anyone have any ideas how to set this up properly?  I am also
&gt; &gt; trying to work out what Snort is for (I have it compile and installed) -
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; this like Portsentry but better?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Prelude? I went to their home page (no I can't remember where) and it
&gt; seemed to have good HOWTOs and guides. As to Snort, that has a good home
&gt; page too. Again, I can't remember the URL.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think I should just wait for Mandrake 9.0 - maybe that has better
&gt; &gt; configuration tools for firewall / proxy and caching name server..
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, what is wrong with:
&gt; 
&gt; * a few HOWTOs
&gt; * a few BEERs
&gt; * vi
&gt; * a Mandrake XYZ distribution
&gt; 
&gt; ???
&gt; 
&gt; You will, trust me, learn a lot more by doing all of this by hand and in
&gt; text. Unless you've been to a well designed and presented course, and
&gt; actually understood it, you won't learn the concepts you are looking for
&gt; simply by knowing what a few point-and-click buttons do.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to sound harsh, but consider that most people whom I know
&gt; who setup firewalls as their living generally don't install nice GUI's
&gt; to administer them. Why?
&gt; 
&gt; * bloat
&gt; * X can be seen as a security issue
&gt; 
&gt; You might want to start out with the "Iptables HOWTO" (whose URL again I
&gt; forget, but it's been mentioned on fresheat and I'm sure it's part of
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A> -- <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A> if I've stuffed the
&gt; first address up). I'm almost certain that will be a little confusing
&gt; because it's more of a reference than a tutorial but it will get you
&gt; asking questions.
