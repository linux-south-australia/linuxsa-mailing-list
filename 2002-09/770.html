&gt; As one poster pointed out:

&gt; 
&gt; XFS has been around since 1994 and is the most mature of the journalling
&gt; filesystems.
&gt; ***

Well, technically IBM's JFS is far more mature. It was included with AIX
3.0 which was released in 1990, and has been steadily improved ever
since. AFAIK, it was the first journalling file system on a UNIX
platform.

I also don't know why more people don't give it a go on Linux for this
very reason; it's had 12 years in the field to mature, the Linux port is
at least 2 years old now, and it's been supported in Mandrake since 8.0.
I've been using it reliably for about a year now.

Regards,
Dean
