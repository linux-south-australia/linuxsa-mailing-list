<H1>Modem install HELP! :)</H1>

Hello all!  I am both new to the list and to linux in general, so please
forgive me any particularly ignorant questions.  :)

Both for the fun of it and because I'm a freelance web developer (who's
obviously been working in Windows lo these last few years), but since most
sites are deployed to linux servers I thought I'd build a linux box with all
the odds and sods of computers parts I've scrounged over the years.

Anyway, everything (RH 7.2) seems to be running smoothly...except for the
bloody modem.  I cannot get a response from it.

The facts:

1.  It is indeed a hardware modem, specifically Multi-Tech Systems Inc. -
MT5634ZPX-PCI.  According to the RedHat site
(<A HREF="http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename">http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename</A>=details&hid=422) it is
dead easy to install.  Which is somewhat humbling...and perhaps why I like
the software end of things. :)

2.  Linux seems to recognize that it is installed, but just doesn't quite
admit that it is a modem and sticks it under "unknown" when I do a hardware
probe through KDE.

3.  As per RH's instructions I tried "/sbin/lspci -v -b" to little comfort
as nothing resembling Microelectronics appeared.

4.  Continuing onward into the fog, I then tried "/bin/setserial device uart
16550A port 0x02e8 irq 3" (I got the port and irq values from examining the
boot sequence messages) and promptly got an error.  To wit:  "device: No
such file or directory".  I then dropped out the word "device" from the
line, tried adding /dev/ttyS3 (again, as the boot messages seemed to
indicate that a device 16550A existed at ttyS3) and things seems to work.
At least I got no error messages at any rate.

5.  Sadly, despite the seeming progress, I still cannot get a modem
response.  Using KPPP I cannot get a response from /dev/ttyS3, nor
/dev/modem for that matter.  From the CLI, "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create"
merrily searches but cannot find a modem.   Yet, and this may actually be a
clue to those less clue-less than I, it ignores ttyS3 as it claims that
/dev/mouse/ points to that port.

Other interesting bits:

I've got a serial mouse hooked up too, and in fact originally had some
trouble having a mouse and the modem in the computer at the same time.  I
played with my BIOS (ancient BTW...1999, Pentium 200 board...told you I made
this thing from leftovers), and made serial2 02e8 rather than auto, and set
PNP OS to "no".  That seemed to allow both modem and mouse.

The modem jumpers are configured for IRQ3 and COM4.

Discussion:

Am I wrong in assuming that a 16650A device is a modem?  I admit that I am
blindly guessing that from the instructions on the Redhat site.  I am dimly
starting to suspect that it might actually just be a serial device...ie my
mouse.

I have read through the HOW-TOs at
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.</A>  Sadly to little avail it would
seem.  Although the answer is probably buried in there, I am too ignorant to
spot it.

Any help that anyone can give this linux fledgling would be gratefully
received!

Thanks in advance,
Tony
