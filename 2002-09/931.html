I want to set up a dedicated firewall / proxy - cache on an old machine to
run via wireless to my laptop.

Any ideas on the best way to go about this?  What is Smoothwall like?  Can
it produce pretty graphs and lots of statistics?  I want to take the
opportunity to learn more about networking.  I know Mandrake firewall can
produce a lot of graphs and statistics and looks quite good but it is also
quite dated.

Is there much difference (as far as the desktop is concerned) between
Smoothwall GPL and Smoothwall retail (corporate)?)

Does anyone have any ideas for good reporting software for Squid?  I have
Calimaris installed and this works great (if it were not for Squid emptying
my access.log upon reboot) but it is all in text - how can I produce a
graphical representation of all this?

In Mandrake 8.2 - Portsentry seems to have disappeared to be replaced with
Prelude?  Anyone have any ideas how to set this up properly?  I am also
trying to work out what Snort is for (I have it compile and installed) - is
this like Portsentry but better?

I think I should just wait for Mandrake 9.0 - maybe that has better
configuration tools for firewall / proxy and caching name server..
