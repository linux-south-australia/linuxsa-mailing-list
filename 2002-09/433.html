&gt; low-level". :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas?

Two, one already implemented and the other the subject of much debate and
some code.

First, stop these things being low-level by implementing features like
extended attributes as Posix standards. For example, the getfacl and
setfacl utilities work for ext2, xfs and jfs and presumably one day by all
full-featured filesystems supported by Linux and BSD. These are extended
attributes yet can be handled by the OS. So, no longer any need to have
fs-specific tools to do clever things like extended attributes (which
makes Samba people somewhat happier, because NT ACLs cannot be
encapsulated with standard Unix permission bits and yet they don't wish to
have special code for every filesystem type Samba might be used with.
There are however problems Samba has to address beyond attributes.)

Second, where the clever facilities you are talking about are specific to
a filesystem, implement them in such a way that they are extensions to
known access objects such as files and directories. An example is streams.
This is currently more theory than practice. I remember Linus saying years
ago that he wished filesystem permissions were done with standard metadata
accessible to ordinary utilities, so that for example you could do a tar
of particular directory on a filesystem and end up with just the
permissions and attributes. Now Reiserfs is implementing things that look
rather like this, but not in production. Quote from the latest Reiser4
doc, complete with avant garde piccies:

"In Reiser4 (but not ReiserFS 3) an object can be both a file and a
directory at the same time. If you access it as a file, you obtain the
named sequence of bytes. If you use it as a directory you can obtain files
within it, directory listings, etc. There was a lengthy discussion on the
Linux kernel about whether this was technically feasible to do. I won't
reproduce it here except to summarize that Linus showed that this was
feasible. Allowing an object to be both a file and a directory is one of
the features necessary to to compose the functionality present in streams
and attributes using files and directories."

It looks like this is how at least the Linux kernel community sees
implementing complex objects using just file and directory
primitives.

If you combine my two points you can see that the basic primitives are
getting much more powerful as Posix includes new functionality, and then
that hopefully these primitives can be combined in new ways in new
filesystems.

This doesn't help with current problems like backing up sparse files under
JFS though. This remains the domain of specialist programs like Daryl
pointed out, which can do this across multiple filesystems but only
because the authors have put in a lot of lowlevel work to make it do so.

How's this for a start?
