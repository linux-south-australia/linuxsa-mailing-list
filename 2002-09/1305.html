&gt; &gt;just need to work out a way to delete them all :)
&gt;
&gt; See below.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I'll try your fix, delete the offending files and
&gt; &gt;then let you know how it goes on monday.
&gt;
&gt; Looking at this example and working through it logically
&gt; I would think that the following command would delete all
&gt; the files listed in the file 'tempfile'. If the find could
&gt; find them all then the same selection criteria will delete
&gt; them (someone please correct me if I am wrong).
&gt;
&gt; rm /var/log/*.[0-9]

logically that would be correct but unfortunately there is a catch. rm (or 
maybe it's bash I'm not sure which) only supports a limited number of 
arguments and so gives an error indicating as such when I try that command. 
As far as I can tell, it's in the order of thousands not hundreds of 
thousands (Mmmm sprinkles). this means that I had to try to delete only a 
small subset of the files such as "rm /var/log/error.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.*" 
and then repeat for every combination of [1-4]. I managed it but it took 
about an hour and a half to delete 250'000 empty files. not fun at all.




&gt; If you only wanted to delete a subset of the list then
&gt; some modification to this would be needed.
&gt;
&gt; HTH
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
