The default mode (passive or normal) is usually defined by your ftp
client. You need to look for an option in your ftp client, or get
another one. Most recent ftp clients use passive by default.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; After sending my earlier message, I happened to find the following message,
&gt; written by ant, in the archive.  On typing passive after login, as he
&gt; suggested, server starts to work.
&gt; 
&gt; My interpretation that the server was in passive mode, and server had not
&gt; fulfilled its requirements, turned out to be wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, how can I make passive mode as my default in my ftp server?
&gt; 
&gt; Any pointers would be higly appreciated.

&gt; 
&gt; ftp&gt; passive
&gt; Passive mode on.
&gt; 
&gt; then try again....
&gt; 
&gt; Passive mode uses the existing connection rather than trying to open a
&gt; second one which is where it usually trips up. A good lot of ftp
&gt; programs use passive by default these days, but I suspect yours doesnt.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My RH7.1 server, with internal IP address, accesses Internet through
&gt; &gt; adsl router.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am setting http and ftp server on the above machine.  Necessary
&gt; &gt; mapping in router is done, and http server is doing fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As for the ftp server, I can log in, but  on entering 'ls' command, the
&gt; &gt; server responds with '227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,1,80,74,20)' ,
&gt; &gt; and it stucks there.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; As per the article (very nicely illustrated) at
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html,">http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html,</A> for PASSIVE MODE following ports
&gt; &gt; have to be opened:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.    FTP server's port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates connection)
&gt; &gt; 2.    FTP server's port 21 to ports &gt; 1024 (Server responds to client's
&gt; &gt; control port)
&gt; &gt; 3.    FTP server's ports &gt; 1024 from anywhere (Client initiates data
&gt; &gt; connection to random port specified by server)
&gt; &gt; 4.    FTP server's ports &gt; 1024 to remote ports &gt; 1024 (Server sends
&gt; &gt; ACKs (and data) to client's data port)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me write a bit what I have interpreted from the above  4 points
&gt; &gt; first.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In 1, server's port 21 should be opened so that any clients can connect
&gt; &gt; to it (in my case, it is doing fine, I guess).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In 2, Server should be able to connect to clients' any ports higher than
&gt; &gt; 1024, using its port 21.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In 3, Server's all ports higher than 1024 should be opened, so that
&gt; &gt; clients can connect to them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In 4, once data transfer starts, servers' higher than 1024 port should
&gt; &gt; be able to communicate with clients' higher than 1024 ports.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I would appreciate if some one on the list can clarify, (1) if my above
&gt; &gt; interpretation is right? and (2) how I can ensure  (check/set etc.) all
&gt; &gt; above conditions  are fulfilled in Redhat 7.1 ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks.
&gt; &gt;
