Hmmm, there was/is a VM in VMS, which is regarded as some as the "Vomit 
Making System," but others regard it as the finest example of Baroque 
software around. It was, as I recal, very expensive to create processes 
under VMS, but you could make system calls in any language, even COBOL, if 
you were sufficiently perverse to do so.

VM stands for virtual memory, which is the concept that you will make it 
look like you have more memory than you actually have. This leads to the 
concept of pages and page slots. Each page of virtual memory can be, 
conceptually at least, either in a physical memory slot, or on the 
page/swap file somewhere. It is actually more complex than that, and I 
suggest you read one of the many books that have been written that include 
something on that. 

Andrew Tannembaum (sp) has the distinction of having written 
an operating system that pissed Linus Torvalds off sufficiently that he 
wrote a replacement, as well as having writen text book on computer 
architecture. He deals with it.
