&gt; Hi
&gt; i am trying to make NIS server in turbo linux 6.0 and it gives me an error

&gt; solution.

Aw,
I cant speak for everyone, but IMHO I would suggest you learn to search 
for stuff in google groups..
you are throwing problems into the list without any useful information 
or seemingly no effort to find the problem and kind of expect an answer.
I guess we may all do it from time to time, but RTFM is used for a reason!!!

the subject 'hi urgent' reminds me of spam or virus email.. you are 
going on about NIS problems..
sorry, dont know where NIS and 'hi urgent' come together? is it in a man 
page? let me check.
surprisingly, no

try to find the problem first, put a bit of effort into it, we are not 
here to help you cos you cant be bothered to find the problem, we are 
here as we all have a common interest in *nix

in the last week, you have posted 3 different problems, without one hint 
of trying to find the problem anywhere else..
this is not what I was taught about linux and LuG's
Nick Morrison from Internode has hinted this to you, so maybe take it on 
board and see how you go

(this resulted in nearly 1000 results at google)

ps. and yes, I am not in the best of moods so would expect some flaming 
for this, ala DSL.

got someone working on the latin translation - 'God, I hate wankers who
