Well,

I finally managed to get FreeBSD V4.6 up onto the Internet (thanks to
Ben Close who leant me the CD with XFree86 packages). It feels almost
like home except I can't mount most of my Linux stuff because I use
XFS and that's not part of FreeBSD to my knowledge.

A few "newbie" and maybe some "advanced" questions:

1) Are there any known comparisons between FreeBSD's handling of
   TCP/IP networking between Linux and FreeBSD? Specifically, comparisons
   on speed, efficiency and reasonably unbiased?

2) Just how compatible is the compatibility binary layer? I've got
   Netscape 4.79 running under it quite nicely, but I am sort of
   wondering whether I could port some of the XFS material into
   FreeBSD and at the same time document XFS while I go at it.

3) Is there anyone local such as Netcraft who sells prepackaged
   FreeBSD stuff? My ISP is just too slow to cope with the ports
   collection, which incidentallly, is why I'm not a debian user.

4) If one were to choose between a Linux 2.4.X (latest stable) and
   a FreeBSD 4.X-STABLE for a firewall assuming that I were to have
   all the time in the world to set one up, read documentation and 
   so forth, what reasons would favour one over the other?

And these are all my questionst at the moment.
