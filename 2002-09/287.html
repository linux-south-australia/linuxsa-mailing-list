Wow!

First off, thanks for the deluge of help!

Second off, I've tried the things mentioned by all.  I did exist during the
Dark Ages of Win3.1, (actually somewhat before that...I blush to admit that
I have coded in 8-bit 6502 code) so I was worried that the spectre of IRQ
conflicts was raising its ugly head once more.  And you lot seem to think
that is the case as well.

What I did was:

1)  Pulled the bloody serial mouse out of the computer, just to simply
matters.  Don't know why I didn't beforehand ;P  I figure if I can make the
modem work, I can probably find a PS/2 mouse.  Budget be damned!  :)

2)  Turned on PNP.  Turned off PNP.  Shouted obscenities.  Tried once PNP
more.

3)  Disabled the second serial port in BIOS.

4)  Looked at "/sbin/lspci -v -b" (and cat /proc/pci).  Output seemed
identical and sadly "microelectronics" was not present.

5)  Did I mention the obscenities?

6)  Tried pnpdump.  Interestingly enough information about the modem does
indeed appear.  I am instructed to edit and uncomment the entries below to
achieve the correct configuration.  As I am unaware which of the three
different (?) configurations might be appropriate, this isn't too helpful.
I may as well admit that I am even unaware of how to edit out said comments.

7)  "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create" once again.  Say...it seems to be pinging
the modem at ttyS1, which is comforting as the jumpers are set at COM2 and I
disabled ttyS1 through BIOS earlier.  However, it is time for obscenities as
three tries of ATQ0 V1 E1 yield nothing.  However, it does mention setserial
again, so I try "/bin/setserial /dev/ttyS1 uart 16550A port 0x02f8 irq 3".
I used IRQ 3 since that is where the jumpers on the modem are set, and 02f8
since the boot messages seemed to indicate that was where it found the
16550A at ttyS01.  But running "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create" after trying
that setserial string still got no modem response to the query string.

Odds and Sods Answered:

Yes, it is an internal PCI modem.  I heartily agree with Romana's "internal
modems can be the devil in Linux:)".

I have the usual two serial ports on the board and now have only the one
serial device (the modem) present.  It is a standalone linux system, but the
PNP enabled or disabled does not seem to make much of a difference.

Oh - not once did kudzu admit that anything new was in the box.

Random (and Probably Wrong) Thoughts:

Would a more modern MB help?  It's actually 1997, not '99 as I originally
mentioned.  I thought modems had been pretty stable as hayes compatible for
awhile now, so should an older BIOS matter?

Maybe I've worn off the gold on the contact constantly pulling it out and
fiddling with jumpers...

Still appearing foolish, but am REALLY appreciating the kind time people are
sparing to hold my hand,
Tony

:)

PS - I did not try all the different COM jumper settings, as there should no
longer be a conflict since there is only ONE serial device present (and port
for the that matter...and PCI card actually).  Right?  Theoretically?



&gt;
&gt; Hi Tony,
&gt;
&gt; you have having the clasic IRQ conflicts. You said you have a serial
mouse, which I take is on COM1 (/dev/ttyS0). Here is what you should do:
&gt;
&gt; Disable COM2 in the bios of your MB.
&gt; Change the modem jumpers to COM2.
&gt;
&gt; That should fix your problem, and you should see the modem on /dev/ttyS1.
&gt; If you dont see the modem, but the serial port does appear, then I would
sugest that that scrounged part is no good !
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Ben.

&gt; &gt; Hello all!  I am both new to the list and to linux in general, so please
&gt; &gt; forgive me any particularly ignorant questions.  :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Both for the fun of it and because I'm a freelance web developer (who's
&gt; &gt; obviously been working in Windows lo these last few years), but since
most
&gt; &gt; sites are deployed to linux servers I thought I'd build a linux box with
all
&gt; &gt; the odds and sods of computers parts I've scrounged over the years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, everything (RH 7.2) seems to be running smoothly...except for
the
&gt; &gt; bloody modem.  I cannot get a response from it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The facts:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1.  It is indeed a hardware modem, specifically Multi-Tech Systems
Inc. -
&gt; &gt; MT5634ZPX-PCI.  According to the RedHat site
&gt; &gt; (<A HREF="http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename">http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename</A>=details&hid=422)
it is
&gt; &gt; dead easy to install.  Which is somewhat humbling...and perhaps why I
like
&gt; &gt; the software end of things. :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2.  Linux seems to recognize that it is installed, but just doesn't
quite
&gt; &gt; admit that it is a modem and sticks it under "unknown" when I do a
hardware
&gt; &gt; probe through KDE.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3.  As per RH's instructions I tried "/sbin/lspci -v -b" to little
comfort
&gt; &gt; as nothing resembling Microelectronics appeared.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4.  Continuing onward into the fog, I then tried "/bin/setserial device
uart
&gt; &gt; 16550A port 0x02e8 irq 3" (I got the port and irq values from examining
the
&gt; &gt; boot sequence messages) and promptly got an error.  To wit:  "device: No
&gt; &gt; such file or directory".  I then dropped out the word "device" from the
&gt; &gt; line, tried adding /dev/ttyS3 (again, as the boot messages seemed to
&gt; &gt; indicate that a device 16550A existed at ttyS3) and things seems to
work.
&gt; &gt; At least I got no error messages at any rate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5.  Sadly, despite the seeming progress, I still cannot get a modem
&gt; &gt; response.  Using KPPP I cannot get a response from /dev/ttyS3, nor
&gt; &gt; /dev/modem for that matter.  From the CLI, "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create"
&gt; &gt; merrily searches but cannot find a modem.   Yet, and this may actually
be a
&gt; &gt; clue to those less clue-less than I, it ignores ttyS3 as it claims that
&gt; &gt; /dev/mouse/ points to that port.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Other interesting bits:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've got a serial mouse hooked up too, and in fact originally had some
&gt; &gt; trouble having a mouse and the modem in the computer at the same time.
I
&gt; &gt; played with my BIOS (ancient BTW...1999, Pentium 200 board...told you I
made
&gt; &gt; this thing from leftovers), and made serial2 02e8 rather than auto, and
set
&gt; &gt; PNP OS to "no".  That seemed to allow both modem and mouse.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The modem jumpers are configured for IRQ3 and COM4.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Discussion:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Am I wrong in assuming that a 16650A device is a modem?  I admit that I
am
&gt; &gt; blindly guessing that from the instructions on the Redhat site.  I am
dimly
&gt; &gt; starting to suspect that it might actually just be a serial device...ie
my
&gt; &gt; mouse.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have read through the HOW-TOs at
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.</A>  Sadly to little avail it
would
&gt; &gt; seem.  Although the answer is probably buried in there, I am too
ignorant to
&gt; &gt; spot it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any help that anyone can give this linux fledgling would be gratefully
&gt; &gt; received!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt; Tony
