Bah Humbug

What really sucks is the situation when you apply for ADSL
and are _NOT_ told that you can not get this service because
you have been pair gained.

When my neighbour decided to get ADSL and was refused service
on _two_ separate lines I recalled him complaining about 14400 max
connections. Since one of his lines had the same prefix as mine
and I have ADSL I told him to challenge Tel$tra (armed with a
Kate Lundy is your friend article) regarding "pair sharing"
(their term). It turns out that he was pair gained, Tel$tra
took it off and now he can get ADSL.

I think that is b@#$dy disgusting!

&gt;&gt;I just added my story to her database. Pair gain is sabotaging our
&gt;&gt;efforts to bring the Internet to the public. Both our public computers
&gt;&gt;happen to be hooked to pair gain systems and so we are trying to
&gt;&gt;demonstrate the wonders of the Internet on a max 28.8 connection. This
&gt;&gt;sucks when within a few hundred metres we can get 49k connects on
&gt;&gt;exactly the same systems.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Telstra's ISDN Home might help....  That'll give you two good (capable
&gt; of 64k digital, or 50k'ish analogue) lines =)  Same price as two normal
&gt; lines, and it gives you two lines.  However, it has the connection fee. 
&gt; Although IMHO, you shouldn't have to pay the connection fee just because
&gt; they can't provide a decent service (pair-gain is not a decent service,
&gt; surely!).
