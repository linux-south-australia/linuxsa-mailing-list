Mmm!
    A few more details are in order I suppose, Apologies for my unclear, 
phrasing and thoughts earlier but I was so involved in my own thought 
path, that I thought you must all know where I was coming from too ;-)

I am running KDE therefore most of the files your talking about are in
.kde/share/config
I checked sysv level 5 which nominates /etc/rc.d/rc.local as the rc file
then I checked all the files possibly related to these eg anything with 
rc in the name
which I did find using grep which is how I found the ~.kde/share/config 
files

I suspect that the error in the PATH variable is probably from a poor 
Additive ie PATH=/usr$PATH , type error but I thought I'd try to confirm 
this, negatively by doing a thorough system search for the error first.

I tried altering a few of the PATH variable settings I found, by adding 
the Java path but they did not show up , when I called $PATH in Konsole 
at the bash prompt.
(Which as pointed out, should be called by echo $PATH and I do tend to 
be slack in this reguard)

My next step was to search for the instances of PATH to find all the 
places where it has been set and find if an error has been generated in 
one of them this would then indicate, I think where I need to place my 
own alterations.

dcd

ps the results searching so far (it's still running) using the find.. 
provided by Richard are listed below 
 
 find / -type f -exec grep -l /usr//bin {} \;
grep: memory exhausted
find: /mnt/floppy/resume.txt: No such file or directory
find: /mnt/cdrom: Input/output error
find: /mnt/cdrom2: Input/output error

/home/dcd/.mozilla/default/jvu8doan.slt/Mail/Local Folders/Sent
/root/.bash_history
grep: /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/flush: Invalid argument

&gt;&gt;I'm trying to find the file where the PATH was set to /usr//bin
&gt;&gt;to both correct it and set my Java path
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Usually that's partially set in your profile.  If you're running
&gt;bash, check ~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc (the
&gt;~ gets expanded to your home directory).  Following the
&gt;bash motif, PATH may also be set globally in the file
&gt;/etc/profile or directory /etc/profile.d/ .
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;currently $PATH in  the  konsole returns
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;bash: /usr//bin:/bin:/usr/bin::/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/games: 
&gt;&gt;No such file or directory
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;You're not just typing "$PATH" and hitting return here, are you?
&gt;PATH is actually a variable; if you are doing the above, you
&gt;should be typing in "echo $PATH", otherwise you may strike
&gt;a variable one day that isn't as friendly, or is pointing to a
&gt;bonafide executable.
