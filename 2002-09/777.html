Multiple sessions doesn't use that much ram really, most of it is shared. I 
think i counted an extra 15mb of active memory or something when i started a 
second kde desktop.

And it is a pretty cool trick to start up multiple sessions. Once I had Unreal 
Tournament running in one session, a desktop + web browsing in another 
session, and quake 3 arena in a third session. Trouble was when switching 
between games u press cltr-alt-f? and the weapon fires in the game 
continuously, so when i'd switch to UT say, i'd hear my rounds get emptied in 
q3a at the same time... was cool though..

i'd only get 50fps in q3a while UT was running, when I usually get 130-200fps, 
but i was surprised i got that much :) 

To see if it could take more load, i started SO6 + mp3 playing, etc in the 
desktop session.. and it still coped fine. The only time i've seen linux get 
really slow was when i had a runaway process running under kdevelop.. it was 
using 1gig of ram before i noticed that my mouse had major lag. :)
