As someone who is employed by ITS, I can tell you Ian that you couldn't 
be more wrong. There are far more Linux, Solaris and Tru64 servers in 
ITS than Windows (there is less than 5 Windows servers in total, while 
we have over 40 Solaris/Tru64/Linux servers). All of the University's 
major central infrastructure bar file and print sharing (where we use 
Netware, not Windows) is running on Unix/Linux. ITS even has several 
Linux-certified staff (LPIC-1), including myself. And I'm typing this up 
on my Linux desktop, which apparently according to you I'm not allowed 
to be using. That's news to me.

It's always interesting however to see the kinds of misinformation 
spread around the place, masquerading as fact.

Regards,
Lachlan

 &gt;I have been asked to clarify my previous comment;
 &gt;
 &gt; &gt; from what I have heard from the inside Uni of Adelaide is no great
 &gt; example &gt; with their 'destroy Linux/Macs at all costs' program.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;Now that the ITS people have taken over the Uni networking, many Linux and
 &gt;Mac Servers have been pulled out and networks migrated across the road so
 &gt;it is all in the 'one shop' and running on MS servers. The word I get is
 &gt;that ITS wants all servers to be running MS and all based in ITS 
across the
 &gt;road from the Uni itself. That all the traffic has to run through the
 &gt;'pipe' under the road now instead of happily working inside/alongside the
 &gt;area that the servers used to serve is just another way to put all the IT
 &gt;eggs into the one basket. Heavy users may have their own servers due to
 &gt;bandwidth problems in the ITS pipe but this will be the exception to the
 &gt;rule and they still wont be allowed to run Linux. Fancy that, a University
 &gt;without a Linux/UN*X Server, who would have thought that day might come?
 &gt;
 &gt;I have heard that ITS will not be supporting any Mac applications nor any
 &gt;Linux/Unix applications. If you want ITS support then run MS. If your
 &gt;Department has stacks of $$s and you want to control your own destiny then
 &gt;buy in your own servers and buy in your own support.
 &gt;
 &gt;The effect of the 'kill Mac' attitude on the Mac-sensitive Departments 
such
 &gt;as Architecture and Multimedia is to say the least disheartening. The 
story
 &gt;is that they are scrambling to find equivalent PC - MS based applications
 &gt;because they have been told to get rid of their Macs.
 &gt;
 &gt;Maybe ITS could promote themselves as "ITS - an EDS Clone". This is the
 &gt;price of progress.
 &gt;
 &gt;I may be wrong, or just mistaken on some of this, I am not as closely
 &gt;linked to Uni of Adelaide anymore.
 &gt;
 &gt;Cheers,  Ian
