&gt;&gt;The question should have been "Did FreeBSD hurt BSD/OS?", and the
&gt;&gt;answer to that one is definitely "yes".
&gt; 
&gt; In fact it's not even that simple.  I think BSD/OS was hurt for much
&gt; the same reasons as all of the proprietary unixes are hurting.  It is
&gt; hard to sell something that other's are giving away, by which I do
&gt; mean that the free unixes are the same as the ones you have to pay for.
&gt; That's been my contention (and your's, I believe) all along.

I also found that that systems such as SCO (Open Server) were dropping 
behind technically and loosing touch with the real world. Especially as 
xBSD and Linux grew in capability and consistency.
