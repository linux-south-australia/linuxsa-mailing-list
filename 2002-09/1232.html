&gt; I understand where Gregg and David N are coming from and agree we must

Another irrelevancy.  GPL is a licence that precludes you from turning
the product into something proprietary, whereas the BSD licence permits
you to do that.  However products licenced under BSD are just as free
as those licenced under GPL.  The difference lies in what you do with
the product.  For example, BSD/OS, a proprietary product of BSDi, was
derived from BSD4.4.  There are people who like the product, just as
there are people who like, say, SCO Open Server, and they are quite
pleased to be able to pay real money for the product, and to get the
support that comes attendant thereon.  Likewise there are those who
prefer a free product and they choose FreeBSD.  Did BSD/OS hurt FreeBSD?
No-one can really say what might have been if things were different, but
FreeBSD is clearly an excellent product, and by the way it has directly
benefitted from BSDi's largess (probably because, at the time, BSDi's
leading technical people were also FreeBSD's leading technical people.)

Bottom line: software under either licence permits *you* free and
unfettered use of the system.  Or put another way, a difference that
makes no difference is no difference.  On the other hand, if we take
issue over the difference then we divide our community.  I think I might
have said that before, and quite recently, too.
