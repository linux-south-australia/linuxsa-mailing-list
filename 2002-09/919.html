Ian,

&gt; It is too much political and not enough technical expertise that brings
&gt; many similar departments down. Don't know why but it is not uncommon. It
&gt; should not be this way but the unwritten lesson from the MS courses seems
&gt; to be 'if it ain't Microsoft then it deserved to be broken'.

Our current way of managing organisations is that the managers know all.
Now, whilst managers claim they consult everyone there are really only
two groups they will consistently listen to:

a) The Accountants
b) Any other manager able to affect their salaries, or worse, fire them

Now, I'm going to ignore (b) for the sake of this argument.

Accountants in today's fiscal climate -- far right wing, market
uncertainty and the constant threat of war (1) -- tend to think in short
term gains rather than short term losses followed by an exponentially
larger gain. We can't really get too upset with them, let's take a look
at the world:

a) We have many nations capable of war being led by terrorists
 - and I define a "terrorist" as someone who is willing to use
unjustified military [i.e. it will sabotage you or somehow affect the
most basic of human needs such as food, survival and a sense of
security] force either to dominate you or destroy you
 - I'll leave it up to you to decide whether the President of the USA is
a terrorist under that definition

b) We have multi-national companies falling around our ears, not to
mention local ones
 - and the executives walk away with millions but the people can't even
get their accrued leave which is some 500% or more LESS than an
executives yearly bonus

c) We have a market economy
 - people can't look forward to future gains any more
 - once we lost our ability to believe by faith, we lost our ability to
look long sighted as a whole
 - (2)

Now, whilst I think most of us would agree a wholesale shift to
Linux/FreeBSd or even a proprietary Unix will show cost benefits in the
long run it will cost in the short term. That short term may be a very
short, short term but it will be a blimp in the books.

And if Telstra reports a loss..down go the shares (because the masses
are morons) and voila...the accountants say "the profits will go down
for this term but increase next term", the managers say "too risky".

*hmmm*

DSL

(1) The spectre of war now is worse than when the nuclear arms race was
on
(2) Science. I blame it on science. We've lost our ability to have faith
and just to believe. Science, in my opinion, is simply the evolution of
religion and it hasn't evolved yet. One day we might realise that
believing solely in Science is just as stupid as believing solely in the
Spirit world.
