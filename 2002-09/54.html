Toby,

&gt;I'm about to embark on a bit of a trek, taking with me my laptop and an
&gt;external harddrive. (ok, and some clothes, a camera, a few passports, and
so
&gt;on ;)
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, along the way I think i'll be asked to put my gear thru X-ray
machines
&gt;in airports numerous times. Probably 4 times just on the way over.

I did a fair bit of travelling a couple of years ago (shuttling between
Adelaide and Melbourne once a week for about 4 months), and the x-ray
machines had no effect on the laptop of the digital camera I was carrying at
the time.  Over the years I've also had desktop PC's, tape drives and tapes,
zip drives and disks, hard disks, network cards, cabling, and most other
computer bits in my carry on luggage and put them through these things with
no problems.  

The only drama I had was in Alice Springs one day when I was carrying a
particularly full briefcase containing 25 metres of coax, an external tape
drive, some tapes, a book and various other bits of paperwork...  I had to
open my briefcase to let the security people see what was inside, obviously
they couldn't figure it out from the screen :)

Based on my experience, I'd say you'll be fine :)

Jim.
