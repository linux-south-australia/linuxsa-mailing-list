Dear SuSE Linux customers and friends,

SuSE Linux 8.1 will be available on October 7th!

SuSE Linux 8.1 extends an unprecedented level of user-friendliness and
functionality for professional and private users, offering the stability
and security of the Linux operating system on their PCs.

Founded in 1992, SuSE has grown to be the leading provider of products and
solutions based on the Open Source operating system Linux. This year, SuSE
celebrates its 10th anniversary spearheading development of Linux and
being a strategic and trustworthy partner of corporate business.

Blending operating system and applications, SuSE's system assistant, YaST2
(Yet another Setup Tool), is the core element and administration center of
this comprehensive package for first-time and experienced Linux users.
With YaST2, even new Linux users can complete the installation in less
than 30 minutes. The updated hardware detection automatically integrates
even the latest USB2.0 devices and Firewire devices. Only a mouse click is
necessary to set up printers, sound cards, and TV cards. YaST2 now
provides a module for the configuration of special hardware components
such as joysticks. Even output devices such as touch screens, vertical
LCDs, 3D solutions, and multi-head systems can be configured easily with
SaX2 (SuSE advanced X configuration). Linux professionals will appreciate
the expanded YaST2 text mode.

*** Practical, Valuable Helpers for Everyday Tasks

The new system profile manager, SCPM (SuSE Configuration Profile
Management), facilitates the easy management of multiple system
configurations. SuSE Linux users who commute between different locations,
can now use local peripherals such as printers or scanners with a single
click. Laptop users will also value the improved wireless LAN support that
can be easily configured with YaST2. Data encryption with WEP (Wired
Equivalent Privacy) provides maximum security in wireless LANs. CUPS
(Common Unix Printing System) is implemented as the default printing
system, since its wide range of drivers enables the flexible and precise
utilization of all common printers. The expanded SuSE Firewall 2, a crypto
file system that protects laptop and hard disk data even in the event of
theft, GNU Privacy Guard (GPG encryption) as well as proven security
technologies such as OpenSSH, PAM, and IPsec are part of the standard
equipment of SuSE Linux 8.1.

*** Office Package Without Surcharge

OpenOffice.org 1.0.1 offers TrueType support and improved import filters.
Thus, mature utilities for text processing, spreadsheets, and
presentations are available to users without any licensing fees. Once
again, SuSE offers the latest version of the superb KDE desktop
environment, KDE 3.0.3, that appears in the innovative "ceramics style".
Users can customize the look and feel of the desktop environment according
to their personal preferences. The new GNOME 2.0 desktop is also included.
Major highlights for multimedia fans include GPhoto 2.1, an application
that transfers images from the digital camera directly to the hard disk,
where they can be comfortably edited with the image processing application
Gimp. The Ogg Vorbis 1.0 encoder and player provides today's most advanced
audio compression tool that even exceeds the quality of the common MP3 and
MP3 Pro technology. In addition, simple, reliable and rapid CD burning is
possible with the new tool K3b. The improved Windows emulator "wine"
enables the utilization of countless Windows applications in Linux.

*** SuSE YOU - Always Up-to-Date, Always Secure

SuSE YOU (YaST Online Update) is the SuSE unique system maintenance and
system optimization service. Users can download a list of all security
updates from the SuSE server and decide which ones to install. Only the
modifications will be transmitted, not the entire program.

*** State-of-the-Art Linux Technology

In addition to common media such as CD-ROM or DVD, SuSE's new "Software
Installer" allows installation based on ftp- and http-servers, local
directories, or network drives. Software Installer checks and controls
complex dependencies of different program packages before their
installation, thus ensuring maximum system stability.

SuSE delivers the SuSE Linux 8.1 operating system with kernel 2.4.19 and
gcc 3.2, representing the latest Linux technology. Optimized Linux kernels
provide maximum performance for Pentium 4 processors and AMD processors.
The powerful boot manager, GRUB (Grand Unified Boot Loader), substitutes
the Linux-Loader, Lilo, as default boot manager. Powertweak allows Linux
professionals to modify kernel parameters comfortably in order to maximize
the performance of their systems. The latest versions of central Linux
tools such as the web server Apache 2.0.39 and Samba 2.2.5, the file and
print server for Windows networks, are also included. Moreover, with
ReiserFS, JFS, XFS, and Ext3, four journaling file systems are available.

*** In Stores from October 7th on

cameras, the printing system CUPS, and the GNOME desktop environment. SuSE
