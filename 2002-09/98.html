Well, well...

&gt; Thanks to everyone ,who tried to help me

Our pleasure.

&gt; If I can help you in any way at all
&gt; in wood or glass ,please let me know.

I assume you are implying you can make goods out of wood and/or glass.

&gt; I did not join Linux SA to be insulted
&gt; by some one on an ego trip.

I should hope you never join the work force. I've come across
managers/superiors much more insulting than what was posted. And in the
real world you don't get a second chance.

&gt; Yes, I can speak English ,my mother tongue.
&gt; Where I come from it is spoken in the local dialect . The BBC have given up
&gt; the quest to standardise the language spoken by over 55 million in the UK ,
&gt; English is a predator language ,it takes in anything it can get ,French
&gt; ,Indian ,and so on.

English, despite its shortcomings has survived for the reasons you
state. The ability to adapt is paramount to surivival.

&gt; There is no so called correct way to pronounce or speak
&gt; English.

I agree. But unintelligble garbage will always be unintelligble garbage.
I didn't join LinuxSA to read intelligble garbage. Did you?

&gt; The person that insulted me

DSL is a turing machine, and a good one at that. What person are you
talking about?

&gt; should learn English, and maybe he
&gt; would be asking ,does such and such a word come from the Norse, or Saxon ,or
&gt; German ,which of course lots of English words do ,especially where I come
&gt; from ,and they are used in different ways and meanings now.

Surprisingly enough he does. He doesn't appear to see your point. He
pointed out that the original question was not well put, stated his
understanding of it and answered it. No amount of etymology will help
him understand unintelligble garbage.

&gt; Well after saying
&gt; that I wish to resign from Linux SA ,I will seek help from some one else .

See the very bottom of this message ;-P

&gt; Once again, thanks from those that didn,t have an axe to grind (english?)

I don't believe that we have to cater for the lowest common denominator.
I don't have a problem with people paying Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Sun
Microsystems for operating systems that are inferior to the free one I
happen to use most. I don't care if they pay hundreds of dollar for
support. In fact, in my opinion, if we start to make "Linux easier for
the masses" we'll end up with an technically superior product whose only
difference will be it costs nothing.

And then it's up to the marketing people to make the product successful.
And marketing requires MONEY not the GPL...

I don't have an axe to grind. I am disappointed that there are people
[seeing you have avoided naming me specifically, I have decided to take
the tar off your brush] who seem to think posting difficult to
understand e-mails for help will actually receive a "polite" (for some
definition) answer. I have worked in kitchens before and what's been
said to me by head chefs and other mangers absolutely pales BIG TIME
compared to what I've said. It bemuses me, and amuses me, that there are
people who can write confusing material and EXPECT others to actually
understand it.

I set everyone a this subject for debate: That LinuxSA supports members
who are unable to express themselves clearly.

I'm quite happy to open the affirmative...I am very, very happy to open
the affirmative.

DSL
