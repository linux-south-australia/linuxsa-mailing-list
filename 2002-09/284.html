Hi Tony,

you have having the clasic IRQ conflicts. You said you have a serial mouse, which I take is on COM1 (/dev/ttyS0). Here is what you should do:

Disable COM2 in the bios of your MB.
Change the modem jumpers to COM2.

That should fix your problem, and you should see the modem on /dev/ttyS1.
If you dont see the modem, but the serial port does appear, then I would sugest that that scrounged part is no good !

Cheers,

Ben.

&gt; Hello all!  I am both new to the list and to linux in general, so please
&gt; forgive me any particularly ignorant questions.  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Both for the fun of it and because I'm a freelance web developer (who's
&gt; obviously been working in Windows lo these last few years), but since most
&gt; sites are deployed to linux servers I thought I'd build a linux box with all
&gt; the odds and sods of computers parts I've scrounged over the years.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, everything (RH 7.2) seems to be running smoothly...except for the
&gt; bloody modem.  I cannot get a response from it.
&gt; 
&gt; The facts:
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  It is indeed a hardware modem, specifically Multi-Tech Systems Inc. -
&gt; MT5634ZPX-PCI.  According to the RedHat site
&gt; (<A HREF="http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename">http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl/genpage2.cgi?pagename</A>=details&hid=422) it is
&gt; dead easy to install.  Which is somewhat humbling...and perhaps why I like
&gt; the software end of things. :)
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Linux seems to recognize that it is installed, but just doesn't quite
&gt; admit that it is a modem and sticks it under "unknown" when I do a hardware
&gt; probe through KDE.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.  As per RH's instructions I tried "/sbin/lspci -v -b" to little comfort
&gt; as nothing resembling Microelectronics appeared.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.  Continuing onward into the fog, I then tried "/bin/setserial device uart
&gt; 16550A port 0x02e8 irq 3" (I got the port and irq values from examining the
&gt; boot sequence messages) and promptly got an error.  To wit:  "device: No
&gt; such file or directory".  I then dropped out the word "device" from the
&gt; line, tried adding /dev/ttyS3 (again, as the boot messages seemed to
&gt; indicate that a device 16550A existed at ttyS3) and things seems to work.
&gt; At least I got no error messages at any rate.
&gt; 
&gt; 5.  Sadly, despite the seeming progress, I still cannot get a modem
&gt; response.  Using KPPP I cannot get a response from /dev/ttyS3, nor
&gt; /dev/modem for that matter.  From the CLI, "/usr/bin/wvdialconf create"
&gt; merrily searches but cannot find a modem.   Yet, and this may actually be a
&gt; clue to those less clue-less than I, it ignores ttyS3 as it claims that
&gt; /dev/mouse/ points to that port.
&gt; 
&gt; Other interesting bits:
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a serial mouse hooked up too, and in fact originally had some
&gt; trouble having a mouse and the modem in the computer at the same time.  I
&gt; played with my BIOS (ancient BTW...1999, Pentium 200 board...told you I made
&gt; this thing from leftovers), and made serial2 02e8 rather than auto, and set
&gt; PNP OS to "no".  That seemed to allow both modem and mouse.
&gt; 
&gt; The modem jumpers are configured for IRQ3 and COM4.
&gt; 
&gt; Discussion:
&gt; 
&gt; Am I wrong in assuming that a 16650A device is a modem?  I admit that I am
&gt; blindly guessing that from the instructions on the Redhat site.  I am dimly
&gt; starting to suspect that it might actually just be a serial device...ie my
&gt; mouse.
&gt; 
&gt; I have read through the HOW-TOs at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Modem-HOWTO.html.</A>  Sadly to little avail it would
&gt; seem.  Although the answer is probably buried in there, I am too ignorant to
&gt; spot it.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help that anyone can give this linux fledgling would be gratefully
&gt; received!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; Tony
