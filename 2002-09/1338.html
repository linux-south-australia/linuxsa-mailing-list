Daniel!

&gt; that's the webmail service I'm using, for some reason the 
&gt; text-wrapping is really weird.

Webmail eh? It can do strange things.

&gt; Also, that does remind me, does anyone know the limitations of 
&gt; using those programs through telnet?

I don't think you quite understand how the applications work. PHP is a scripting
language and is commonly used to embed its scripting capabilities in web pages.
Hence you require something that will edit your web pages and then upload it
onto your development Linux box (i.e. this new machine you've got).

Therefore you could:

a) edit the pages using Microsoft FrontPage and then publish them to the linux box
b) use vi or emacs [I'd say vi ;-P] to edit the pages over a telnet session

MySQL is implemented as a server that is able to accept connections over a
network if setup to. A basic little program called "mysql" is included with it
which allows you to type raw SQL statements to the server. It's available for
Windows, MacOS (don't know about &lt; X but I think, not sure) and the free OS's.

You can also do things like connect to it using ODBC on a Mac OS box and then
connecting to it using Microsoft Access. In other words it uses a client server
model. You generally eventually end up typing text SQL to it through some
programming medium such as Perl and hence of course, you can operate it through
telnet.

&gt; I'll be borrowing a monitor 
&gt; for the installation, but if I can get away with not buying one for it in 
&gt; the short-term, I'll be happier (My computer budget extends to 
&gt; buying new ink cartridges and paper for my printer).

Yuck. It's almost cheaper to buy new PRINTERS :-(
