I've already tried following some instructions I got off the Squid and other
sites - but each distributions seems to have something unique in it's set
up.  I tried the listed commands for ipchains (translated to iptables) to
set up transparent caching but I just get it to work.

But I want it to be as fun to use as reliable - I won't be motivated to
learn if I don't enjoy using it (I'm just an innocent non-techie trying to
make sense of it all)..

I think you are right that I should build it myself from scratch - and maybe
put a small window manager like Ice or something on instead of KDE - just
for quick and easy graphical representation and for screen layout (fit more
info on the screen at any one time).

Is there a good distribution for this?  Would Gentoo suffice?

Ian,

&gt; I want to set up a dedicated firewall / proxy - cache on an old machine to
&gt; run via wireless to my laptop.

That sounds good.

Did you know that the InstallFest 2002 Unplugges (1) has an emphasis on
wireless networking?

&gt; Any ideas on the best way to go about this?  What is Smoothwall like?  Can
&gt; it produce pretty graphs and lots of statistics?  I want to take the
&gt; opportunity to learn more about networking.

Then don't use Smoothwall or IPCop; if your objective is to learn about
something, don't use a tool that does it for you. Get a base
distribution -- and contrary to popular opinion they will all be just as
good as each other at the end of the day -- and get your fingers dirty.

&gt; I know Mandrake firewall can
&gt; produce a lot of graphs and statistics and looks quite good but it is also
&gt; quite dated.

And what does putting a CD into the CDROM drive and clicking a few
buttons teach you?
 
&gt; Is there much difference (as far as the desktop is concerned) between
&gt; Smoothwall GPL and Smoothwall retail (corporate)?)

I don't think so -- and you still get the same, ever so polite
maintainer.

&gt; Does anyone have any ideas for good reporting software for Squid?  I have
&gt; Calimaris installed and this works great (if it were not for Squid
emptying
&gt; my access.log upon reboot) but it is all in text - how can I produce a
&gt; graphical representation of all this?

Visit:

* <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</A>

...I'm sure I saw some fancy graphics hooha there.

&gt; In Mandrake 8.2 - Portsentry seems to have disappeared to be replaced with
&gt; Prelude?  Anyone have any ideas how to set this up properly?  I am also
&gt; trying to work out what Snort is for (I have it compile and installed) -
is
&gt; this like Portsentry but better?


Prelude? I went to their home page (no I can't remember where) and it
seemed to have good HOWTOs and guides. As to Snort, that has a good home
page too. Again, I can't remember the URL.

&gt; I think I should just wait for Mandrake 9.0 - maybe that has better
&gt; configuration tools for firewall / proxy and caching name server..

Ok, what is wrong with:

* a few HOWTOs
* a few BEERs
* vi
* a Mandrake XYZ distribution

???

You will, trust me, learn a lot more by doing all of this by hand and in
text. Unless you've been to a well designed and presented course, and
actually understood it, you won't learn the concepts you are looking for
simply by knowing what a few point-and-click buttons do.

I don't want to sound harsh, but consider that most people whom I know
who setup firewalls as their living generally don't install nice GUI's
to administer them. Why?

* bloat
* X can be seen as a security issue

You might want to start out with the "Iptables HOWTO" (whose URL again I
forget, but it's been mentioned on fresheat and I'm sure it's part of
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A> -- <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A> if I've stuffed the
first address up). I'm almost certain that will be a little confusing
because it's more of a reference than a tutorial but it will get you
asking questions.
