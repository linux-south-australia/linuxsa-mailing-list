Just out of interest here's a couple interesting things I found
installing Mandrake 9 as part of our network here.
(I've installed it under Vmware, using bridged networking to 
our LAN, which is run by an NT based PDC.)

During install when you set the root password you have the 
option to change your authentication type, from Local password,
to LDAP or NIS or Windows Domain.
When choosing Windows Domain you are then prompted for a domain
name, a valid admin user/password to join the domain when your
networking is setup.

Just to be sure, I didn't create any other users apart from root,
rebooted after install, and voila, I could log on with my NT user
and password, it generates your home dir on the fly and logs in like
you'd expect (using winbind of course).  Very nice feature...

The other thing I liked with the install was printer setup.  Basically
the same as 8.2, you get an option to browse for network printers,
upon doing so I was presented with a list of all the network printers
on our LAN, right down to the model (apart from one Epson, it was listed as
unknown).  Again, very nice feature....

The only hassle I've had is the mount SMB shares feature in the Control
Centre, it browses the network fine, picks up all Windows machines that
have available shares, but it doesn't mount them properly when asked, 
no doubt I've overlooked something there, I haven't revisited it since, but
anyway...

So far it seems very solid, no annoying glitches like 8.2, and a whole lot
of nice new packages in the form of Gnome 2 & KDE 3 as standard.
