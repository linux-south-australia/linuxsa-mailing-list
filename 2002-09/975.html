All,

A little knowledge and a touch of gossip adds up to pure crap.

Firstly i am not affiliated with ITS ( the central university It service ) 
I work for a department.

This is absolutely rubbish. Yes some servers are being moved to ITS. But 
they are remaining the same platform as they are now. ie MS re remaining MS 
and Linux etc is remaining Linux etc.

Yes we have some MS servers ( not me personally - rather chew my own arm 
off ) but this is because the programs needed for course work is only 
available  under a MS platform. eg the language labs, and the business school.

As for the Cs Dept there has been no change at all. There is at least half 
a dozen different platforms for students to work from. Not to mention some 
very large clusters ( one of which is ours ) ALL RUNNING *NIX

So lets not listen to rumours.

Cheers

&gt;I have been asked to clarify my previous comment;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; from what I have heard from the inside Uni of Adelaide is no great 
&gt; example &gt; with their 'destroy Linux/Macs at all costs' program.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Now that the ITS people have taken over the Uni networking, many Linux and
&gt;Mac Servers have been pulled out and networks migrated across the road so
&gt;it is all in the 'one shop' and running on MS servers. The word I get is
&gt;that ITS wants all servers to be running MS and all based in ITS across the
&gt;road from the Uni itself. That all the traffic has to run through the
&gt;'pipe' under the road now instead of happily working inside/alongside the
&gt;area that the servers used to serve is just another way to put all the IT
&gt;eggs into the one basket. Heavy users may have their own servers due to
&gt;bandwidth problems in the ITS pipe but this will be the exception to the
&gt;rule and they still wont be allowed to run Linux. Fancy that, a University
&gt;without a Linux/UN*X Server, who would have thought that day might come?
&gt;
&gt;I have heard that ITS will not be supporting any Mac applications nor any
&gt;Linux/Unix applications. If you want ITS support then run MS. If your
&gt;Department has stacks of $$s and you want to control your own destiny then
&gt;buy in your own servers and buy in your own support.
&gt;
&gt;The effect of the 'kill Mac' attitude on the Mac-sensitive Departments such
&gt;as Architecture and Multimedia is to say the least disheartening. The story
&gt;is that they are scrambling to find equivalent PC - MS based applications
&gt;because they have been told to get rid of their Macs.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe ITS could promote themselves as "ITS - an EDS Clone". This is the
&gt;price of progress.
&gt;
&gt;I may be wrong, or just mistaken on some of this, I am not as closely
&gt;linked to Uni of Adelaide anymore.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,  Ian
