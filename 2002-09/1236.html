Hi,
    I'm preparing my system gradually for when I'll be able to get adsl 
and finish networking the computers together.

My current use is as follows

Two seperate computers, networked in both linux and winblows for the 
kids games and homework.
My computer, connected to the internet, with seperate logons for the 
kids. (This is what is described below)

What I have done,
    Set up the dialup internet connection to only work from my logon
    When the kids need the internet I logon, connect, open a new 
terminal logon one of the kids, startx-- :1 and change to the new 
xsession (learn't this from a previous thread) and leave them to it.
Whenever they need the web they simply open a browser and search.
    The bonus for me from this, is that i can set NT to download, in my 
logon set to use half the bandwidth.
If I need something quickly I can switch back quickly, without either of 
us losing anything.

What I want to do, 
    Initially, Set up a program (I'm thinking squid),on my system. Which 
could later be replaced with a purpose built box to run just this 
program. The purpose of this is to reduce the pages retrieved from the 
net, and so the kids can get their often used pages without having to 
connect. By using, this program, to control the access for each user, 
when I network to their other computers I will already have the controls 
setup. I'm also thinking that when I get adsl, this will minimise the 
changes I need to make to our usage.

What I'm interested in is, the options. Is squid the right way to go, 
are there simpler/better ways. And the drawbacks if any of each option.

dcd
ps I use mandrake cooker
(and Iv'e found the only way to keep it uptodate, is constant small 
downloads, hence the background downloads)
