Doesn't one of the BSDs have a JFS port or something? That might be a suitable alternative for those that prefer filesystems from commercial flavours of unix over the Linux and BSD filesystems.

That'll never happen! :-) LOL

&gt; I get the feeling that there are many more all-in-one-box firewall
&gt; solutions available based on BSD than the relative popularity of the two
&gt; OSs might indicate. Firewalling is a particular BSD strength. The
&gt; allegedly most popular commercial firewall in the world (Nokia) ran for
&gt; most of its life on BSD before erlatively recently changing to Linux for
&gt; reasons not related to its firewalling abilities.

Licensing is a big reason for companies picking one over the other. A lot of companies like the BSD license for "black box" firewalls, as it means that they can make changes and not have to share.

Also (like I said earlier), the BSD networking code used to be significantly better than what was found in the Linux kernel. That has changed fairly recently (depending on who you talk to).
