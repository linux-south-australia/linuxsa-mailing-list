I sorta had it going a while ago (6 months - a year?), but these days
have resorted to windows[1], as it works more reliably for dv video :( 

You could try dvgrab/kino to rip, and main actor with the mpeg 2 encoder
plugin (not free) to make the mpeg (it supports mpeg 1 out of the box,
so that might be ok too). The really cool thing about main actor is that
it can inteligently de-interlace and get excellent quality 720x567
video. Ive not found any program that can do this as well, for unix, or
windows!. Im not sure about the (s)video cd mastering, but once you get
that far it shouldnt be too hard. 

The thing I found so annoying was having to recompile the kernel
ieee1394 support, _and_ all the associated libs every week! That was
some time ago though, and it may have stabilised since. When I next
re-install my box, I might give it another shot. Its getting a bit dated
(mandrake 8.1).

Ant

[1] XP. Every other version either didnt support it, or crashed within 5
mins. Plus you need all the patches for premiere 6, if thats your
editor, or else that'll crash as well!

&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Getting desperate here, so I hope someone has "been there, done that"
&gt; and can assist.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone put together a decent way of:
&gt; a) recording video from a TV card, DV over firewire device, etc..
&gt; b) converting it to VCD format (or SVCD)
&gt; c) burning it to a CD (as a VCD/SVCD) that is playable in a DVD
&gt; 
&gt; on a PC running any recent Linux distro. If you have, then I've very
&gt; keen to know EXACTLY what software you used, what versions, and how you
&gt; made it all fly. I've spent a fair bit of time trying to get
&gt; combinations of transcode, avifile, vcr, MPEG tools (from Berkley),
&gt; etc... working with very average, crappy results. 
&gt; 
&gt; I would HATE to have to resort to Windows just to do video capture and
&gt; processing!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dean
