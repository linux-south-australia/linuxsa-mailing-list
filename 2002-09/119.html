&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Really?  Last time I was in KL (admittedly a while ago) they seemed
&gt; &gt; a bit edgy to me.
&gt; 
&gt; no, efficient and above all very polite.
&gt; This was around the time of the Commonwealth games (so 98 I guess?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Australian Customs have always been pleasant and friendly to 
&gt; &gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; they were ok but only just, not polite, not rude either though.
&gt; And inefficient, it took much longer to pass through than Malaysia.

If you want inefficency (sp??) at an airport, try Bangkok, Airport. The
local (Bangkok Post) paper has had countless articles on it. The Thai
Government have proposed a higher Air Traffic Control tower as a
solution for the new airport. :P I don't think so... When i last went
though Bangkok, the official took my passport, thumbed through it quickly,
then went over looking at every stamp in it.!!! then again and
again!!... Sheeesh... I won't mention the time that it takes at the
Vientiane Airport in Laos.

Asia in general is inefficent and corrupt.

Back to the bit and bytes,

George
