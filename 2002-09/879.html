If you want an access point, you want a board that uses the Prism 2.5 chipset - these have a driver developed for it in linux called 'hostap', and its brilliant - I'm emailing right now over wireless, with one of my boxes acting as an AP.

I've found the best/cheapest cards I can find are the Dlink DWL-520's - not the 520+, this has a completely different chipset, by Texas Instruments, and they're being rather anal by not releasing any information about the chip, so there's currently no linux/bsd drivers for them, unfortunately.  The 520's retail for around ~$180, you can get them even cheaper if you can whoresale them.

Pagedata did stock the 520's - but yesterday when we went to grab a bunch they no longer stock them, only the 520+'s - anybody know of any other wholesalers in SA that sell PCI based prism cards?

I'm in the middle of a wireless rollout, but it seems halted for the moment until I locate some AP-capable cards :(

R

(PS. Anybody got teritary/access point firmware for the orinoco/cabletron/enterasys cards?)

| 
| 
| I am receiving a LOT of conflicting views on wireless NIC's - I have found
| Surecom pretty cheap - D-Link from around $180 - some guy I just called at a
| shop told me there is a big difference which is why they only sell $300 3COM
| PCI wireless cards.
| 
| What IS the difference?  Can I get away with a cheap wireless NIC - or will
| it be another non-Linux happy appliance that is a pain to set up and will
| leave me wishing I got a d-link or linksys card or whatever?
| 
| Maybe I am just better off getting a wireless access point and plugging that
| in to my old desktop machine rather than a el-cheapo surecom wireless NIC?
| 
| I'm just trying to work out why there is such wild variation on wireless
| prices and if I can get away with cheap stuff (ie - am I just paying for
| brand name?)
| 
| Boost computers say Surecom is fine - they keep rolling them out - but
| another vendor said they suck (in a nice way) while this other guy at a shop
| tells me 3COM is the way to go for $300 - that I get what I pay for?
| 
| Arrrgghhh - any views?
