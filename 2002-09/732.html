For the benefit of us all - would you mind explaining how to allocate RAM to
a process?  That sounds like a good idea - throw it at Mozilla, X, etc - the
ones that can really benefit.  I never considered that.

Ian,

&gt; Or would it be best to run VMWare under BSD (is that possible?) and then
run
&gt; Linux and Win2K under that on two virtual terminals.  You could have some
&gt; sort of log in manager that lets you select operating system as well as
&gt; session type.

It's possible.

&gt; I've always wondered how to use spare physical RAM to boost the system
&gt; further - I thought Linux does that by default - the RAM is listed as free
&gt; but it is being taken up by buffers, caches, etc.

Give it to user space programs. Linux does increase buffers and such.
However, just as an example, I throw an absolute heap of RAM at my squid
process because my ISP is slow but I tend to be connected for extended
periods of time. Hence, I get memory hits more often than not.

It may not sound much different but it is.

I also throw a lot of memory at Netscape Navigator and Mozilla's caches.
