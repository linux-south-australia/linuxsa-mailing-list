David, you need to get some sleep or something. I had recently been
thinking you had improved on your childish whining when people asked for
help in a manner that wasn't exactly following your template of how the
peasants must ask for your almighty assistance, but it appears it was
only a passing phase and you are back to your old, vitriolic, annoying,
_unhelpful_ self.

Rob, don't let him discourage you, he believes just because he may have
a valid point it entitles him to point it out in the rudest, least
compassionate way possible. Let me paraphrase for you, as I wouldn't
blame you for entirely ignoring his tirade...

David Lloyd wrote:

 &gt; (1) If you think I've gone right off , I can't understand your English.
 &gt; PERIOD. Don't blame me --- I'll interpret it as I so choose. If you want
 &gt; any of us to answer your queries try to speak English. I can clearly see
 &gt; your enthusiasm but it is VERY difficult to understand what you are
 &gt; saying.

It would be easier for the list to help you, if you added a little more
punctuation etc.

 &gt; (2) If English isn't your first language, you can speak to me (or the
 &gt; list) in French, German or Italian. I think I can translate them better
 &gt; than...oh let's not get personal...[read: the crap I attempted to
 &gt; translate above]

David is just pointing out that he is a grumpy prick.

 &gt; (3) If I seem a little, ummm, unhelpful I'm not your employee and I'm
 &gt; not your employer. I don't NEED to respond to what you said; I could
 &gt; just trash it [and I probably should have] rather than attempted to
 &gt; understand what you wanted to find out.

David is trying to justify rudeness by saying he didn't _have_ to reply,
and hoping you will feel indebted to him regardless of his insulting
behavior.

David, remember the old adage, "If you can't find something nice to
say...". You may find it annoying to read mail that isn't up to your
standards, but ripping into them DOES NOT HELP!

 &gt; (4) Everyone else who wants to spit the dummy at me for being
 &gt; unfriendly: carefully ask yourself whether I have answered the question,
 &gt; or asked questions that will clarify the questions being asked. And
 &gt; don't even dare send any dummies my way unless you have more oil than
 &gt; Iraq...and if you think I have't answered the question -- answer it
 &gt; yourself as well as flaming me for being unhelpful

Rob, if I remember correctly, there is a similar tool in KDE called kppp
to what you would be using in Gnome. Setting it up should not effect the
setup of the gnome tool.

David, regardless of whether you answered the question or not, the
manner in which you did so probably means that it didn't get through to
Rob anyway. I know I struggled to read your whole spiel, and it wasn't
even directed at me. That said I think it is debatable whether you
answered the questions with a solution that is suitable for Rob's level
of expertise anyway. Rob is, I believe, in his 60's and so I doubt he
grew up with computers like you probably did. Giving him 20 different
options might not be the best way about helping, I would have thought
pointing him at the KDE equivalent of the gnome tool he is using, with
reassurances that using one won't screw up the other, would have been
sufficient. Follow this with extra reading if you must, but don't
overwhelm him with sarcastic comments about the command line etc. He can
get to that in his own time, if he feels he needs to.

We should be encouraging Rob to stick at it, not trying to scare him off.

 &gt; [WARNING: I have received a huge shipment of oil from Iraq. And I've
 &gt; started on the Qu'Ran again ;-)]

Whatever. If you think people might flame you for your comments, maybe
this is an indication that you should temper them a little, don't you think?

Barney.

PS. I'm not in this for a flame session, unlike you obviously are David.
I am doing this only so that Rob understands that others on the list
will help him without trying to make him feel small, obligated, or that
he is wasting our time. (We can choose to ignore people if we think they
are wasting our time - as I suggest Rob does with you.) I just hope you
aren't this rude when you meet people to help them out.
