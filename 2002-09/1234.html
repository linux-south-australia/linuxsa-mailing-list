No.  The question should have been "Did FreeBSD hurt BSD/OS?", and the
answer to that one is definitely "yes".

&gt; No-one can really say what might have been if things were different,
&gt; but FreeBSD is clearly an excellent product, and by the way it has
&gt; directly benefitted from BSDi's largess (probably because, at the
&gt; time, BSDi's leading technical people were also FreeBSD's leading
&gt; technical people.)

No, it wasn't as simple as that.  BSD[Ii]'s leading technical people
have very little to do with FreeBSD's people, though it's true that,
for about a year, some FreeBSD people worked for Wind River Systems
after they bought the software assets of BSDi.

The real problem is that it's difficult to sell software when somebody
is giving away something which is effectively the same.
