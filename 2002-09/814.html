&gt; What is a "typical workstation"?
&gt; 

At a guess? PentiumI 200 up to PIII/K7 running at around a gig or so. 
64M up to 256M or memory. 4 to 12Gb of 5700RPM disk. Note that none of 
my machines match this "spec", nor do any other other Linux boxes that I 
work with, but hey, I'm a hardware junkie. :)

&gt; 
&gt; I would disagree -- attempting to open any of the documentation
&gt; directories, viewing a huge gallery of images using something like
&gt; gqview

Okay, good point, but still they is a fairly specific, and not a *very* 
common use cases, not like typing some code or a letter or checking your 
email. It still is not worth going to more effort to use a more advanced 
FS for.

&gt; But you say that IDE hard drives are slow. If ReiserFS can unpack these
&gt; blocks more quickly than jumping all over the filesystem then ReiserFS
&gt; will go faster.

True, true. But as drives get faster, Reiser's advantage will be less 
noticable, if it was noticable at all in the first place. I don't think 
it is on a workstation.

&gt; 
&gt; Because you used a module that mattered to her?
&gt; 

Got a useful example?

&gt; 
&gt; What's a "workstation app"?
&gt; 

GQView.

Don't get me wrong about EA's and advanced FS features in general - I 
love them! Bring them on! But very few apps are going to support more 
than the lowest common denominator when it comes to filesystems features.

Look at HPFS - a very cool filesystem for a desktop OS at the time, but 
because OS/2 could also be installed FAT partitions, no OS/2 developer 
could *depend* on HPFS's features being present, so no one bothered to 
use them. Look at Apple - they're busilly lobotomizing their OS by 
reverting to using filename extensions for file-type metadata. 
Ugggghhhh! For the love of $DEITY.. why?!? In the end, Mac apps are just 
going to use filename extensions rather than the creator and type 
metadata, if it's present at all.

And in the end, if nothing supports these more advanced features, why 
bother with a more advanced FS that requires more effort?

&gt; 
&gt; Extra effort?
&gt; 

Take an existing ext2 volume. Do:
   "tune2fs -j /dev/hdaX && mount -t ext3 /dev/hdaX /mnt/somewhere"
Lather, rince, repeat.

vs:

  - Backup that 10Gb parition(s) somewhere, somehow.
  - Make new FooFS partitions
  - Restore old data.

And then you still need to find that mature toolchain for FooFS (if it 
exists).

&gt; So, because "cp", "rm", "mv" and such 

No no! I was talking about mkfs, fsck, etc, etc. Undelete utilities. 
Backup apps. Disaster recovery apps. Software that deals directly with 
the FS's structure on disk, not that which goes via the kernel.

&gt; So, then, why don't YOU have ext3 installed seeing it's so wonderful for
&gt; you?

I do on every one of my workstations, but I can't on my servers: FreeBSD 
doesn't support ext3. But hey, UFS/FFS+soft-updates rocks my world, so 
it doesn't bother me. :p
