&gt; If they're reducing the number of platforms available to students in

&gt; pro-M$crosoft by any means, but the reality of the business world is
&gt; that Windows dominates, so that's what the vast majority of non-Comp Sci
&gt; graduates will be exposed to.

One of the issues here is that the primary role of universities is not to
provide the executive version of factory fodder. The whole point of a
university is diversity of thought and persuit. M$ _will not_ provide all
of the necessary infrastructure for all applications in a university (even
outside CS - I started using Linux for this very reason in gentics and mol
biol) and the bean counters in admin should not decide what people are
likely to need and then stick to that decision if shown to be wrong.
