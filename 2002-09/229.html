Hi All,
    Unless you can get some sort of useful information from
the device, what do you need a net enabled refrigerator for?
I know that a large American soft drink manufacturer has
many of it's vending machines online to gather info about
when they have to be refilled, but this provides actual
sales data from how many cans of what type were sold etc.
This particular idea came originally from MIT (bless 'em) in
the 70's when the students wanted to know if the MIT machine
had their favourite drink in it before they trudged down the
hall to get one. To be honest, why would the average home
need a net enabled fridge? What possible use could the
number of times the door is opened and for how long be of
use to a manufacturer after the initial data collection
period to allow for design of later models. The same with
how many ice cubes are dispensed.

    Lets move on to other household devices: Toasters. Don't
laugh I have heard of some manufacturer wishing to build
such a device. Why! If the average household has two adults
and 2.3 kids and each eats 1.4 slices of toast per day this
is about 6 slices of toast per day. O.K. the average family
sets the toaster between level 2 (light) to level 7 (dark).
This useless data (probably wrong anyhow as I am making it
up) could be collected using other methods quite easily over
a lesser period of time (by survey perhaps). I ask again,
after an initial data collection period, what possible use
is it to have these devices connected to the net?

    After my initial bitch about why, I will move onto how.
How are these devices connected to the net anyhow. O.K. they
have some kind of network interface, but what is it
connected to? If it is some kind of wireless interface, will
it:
    a. Irradiate my food?
    b. Irradiate me?
    c. Leave my fridge open to a cyber criminal attack? This
really does bring a whole new meaning to the word SPAM!

    O.K. jokes aside, If you don't own a computer but buy
one of these hi tech devices what DO you hook it up to. Will
it use IPv4 or IPv6? Another interesting question with the
diminishing number of IP addresses in the world. I really
can't see any use for this stuff realistically. Just because
you CAN do something, why do for the sake of it. I don't
think I will bother spending the extra for a net interface
on my next microwave oven. Anyhow, I leave it up to you guys
to chat about.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; &gt;&gt;(i.e. you can't sell refrigerators... unless they run
Linux)
&gt; &gt; Dont laugh... LG are working on this :-)
&gt;
&gt; I saw the LG web-enabled refrigerator in KL in July.
Pretty stupid,
&gt; in my opinion.  I'd much rather sit when on-line (and the
screen on
&gt; the 'fridge is at standing height.)
