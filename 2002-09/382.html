&gt; Getting the burner part working is best left to last (IMHO).  The SCSI

&gt; are OK.  If you agree, just undo the SCSI related steps described below.  

I currently have the burner working fine, it burns CD's with, as far as
I can tell, no errors. Actually, most of the testing I have done (though
not all) had been through the IDE cdrom, and not using SCSI emulation.

&gt; According to your drive allocation, you appear to have put both CDs on the 
&gt; same ide channel.  This is discouraged in one of the HOWTO's - reason given 
&gt; is that CDs are slow yet demand attention at critical times so it is best to 
&gt; pair them with a fast HDD.  May I suggest that you disconnect one of your CDs 
&gt; at least during fault finding to eliminate this potential problem.  Better 
&gt; that you find out AFTER the individual drives are sorted.  While you are at 
&gt; it, double check the master/slave settings on both devices connected to each 
&gt; IDE channel.  I had a problem with an older HDD that wouldn't be a slave to a 
&gt; CD yet it was OK with another HDD (some sort of snobbery perhaps? ;-)

At the moment I do have both drives on the second IDE channel. I knew
this might be a problem, so I also tried the cdrom on the same channel
as my primary IDE hard drive. Unfortunately this did not help.

I will try fiddeling with the master/slave settings on the device,
although they do get detected properly (not sure if this setting does
anything after the actual detection of drives..?)

Daniel Mundy
