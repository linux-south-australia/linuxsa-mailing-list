Hmmm.

Most databases use raw partitions, so in many important ways
are filesystems themselves.

There are three major distinctions: Firstly filesystems support one
access path -- filename -- whereas databases can have multiple
access paths -- that is, you can have multiple keys.  You pay a
price for each additional access path.

Secondly, database indexes are tree-structured whereas filesystem
diretories are list-structured.  Write 100,000 files to a directory
and 100,000 records to a database and you'll see that the filesystem
performance better with small numbers of files but considerably worse
with large numbers of files.

Thirdly, databases are designed for transaction support.  That is,
to have a consistent user response time.  You can see this by
deleting those 100,000 files/records.  The filesystem will delay
other transactions, the database will deliver other transactions
with only a small performance hit.

For the IMAP application, as long as users don't drop huge
numbers of messages into single folders then the filesystem
has less overhead to carry about.  As long as there's only
one or two IMAP daemons accessing each folder then the
transaction advantage of databases doesn't matter either.

Maildir++ has one other significant advantage over databases
for enterprise applications -- writing each message into a
distinct file allows heirarchical storage management (HSM)
systems to archive old unaccessed messages to near-line storage.
Filesystems like XFS are significantly more HSM-friendly than
databases.  Using a HSM gives a neat solution to disk space
implications of the use of e-mail folders as a corporate archive.
