&gt; &gt; Cyrus works well and is a very nice piece of work. I use it.
&gt; 
&gt; I've dallied with it, on a home machine.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;    1) it uses a closed black-box model for data storage, as far as MUA
&gt; &gt;       software is concerned. The only way an MUA can get to mail data is
&gt; &gt;       if it can talk IMAP. There are many situations where this is not
&gt; &gt;       helpful. I can provide examples if required. (In some situations this
&gt; &gt;       is an excellent idea, because it enforces a standard.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    2) it implements this black-box using the well-known Berkeley DB
&gt; &gt;       database (instead of the Maildir-like system it used to use.) The
&gt; &gt;       trouble is, database performance drops off much faster than
&gt; &gt;       filesystem performance when you get to large sizes, especially for
&gt; &gt;       objects that databases aren't very good at handling such as BLOBs.
&gt; &gt;       Most people don't hit this limit. But if you are after maximum
&gt; &gt;       speed, a DB won't give it to you compared to a filesystem
&gt; &gt;       especially for uncomplicated access patterns. Modern hardware often
&gt; &gt;       makes this a non-issue for all but very big or very heavy-use setups.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    3) You can't avoid SASL for authentication. I think this is still a
&gt; &gt;       restriction (should check to make sure it is still true.) SASL is
&gt; &gt;       not one of the big standards around, meaning you have to write and
&gt; &gt;       maintain glue.
&gt; 
&gt; Ditto these. Number 1 extends a bit further than might be immediately
&gt; obvious. For instance, forget using procmail anymore (at least, in any
&gt; easy fashion) - cyrus 'wants' you to be using sieve. I never could get
&gt; sieve going.

SASL and Sieve (and IMSP before them) illustrate that the Cyrus group are
big enough to afford to solve their problems their own way. They often
then throw the results back into the community and hope that they'll
become adopted as standards. From the point of view of CMU this is
perfectly reasonable. However it explains why there isn't much takeup
relatively speaking. 

If you want to become a Cyrus admin be prepared to learn a lot of very
Cyrus-specific skills. If you run Courier you will be plugging
together much better-understood standards.

I now recommend Courier over Cyrus for all circumstances that I've
met in the last year or so (even though I'm still using Cyrus - I'll
kill it off soon I promise.)

SCO Volution Mail manager is based on Cyrus. Volution is meant to be this
thing that pretty GUI tools just handle and the admin never has to see
inside. But pity help the admin whose first introduction to Cyrus details
is trying to fix a broken server, with all these non-standard bits.
Courier doesn't have this problem to such a degree.
