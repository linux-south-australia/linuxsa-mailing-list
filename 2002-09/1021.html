&gt; I personally hate advanced maths (even more so because I was forced to 
&gt; do it at uni), and by the time I got to uni I had had enough of it, 
&gt; luckilly 1st year Maths was just a repeat of Maths 1&2 at yr 12. 

Hey, I don't claim to have _liked_ doing Maths.  I did Ma&CompSc at UofA so 
I _did_ a _lot_ of Maths as part of my degree.

However, that aside, I did put some effort into it (admittedly only a Credit 
average effort).   

The benefit of this was that I did some subjects with very relevant topics:
- set theory
- dynamic modeling 
- various things relating to crypto.
- logic (eg. turing machines)
- numerical analysis/methods.

All of these made me better at CS.  (Actually NA/NM are/were CS subjects - 
and they fricking hurt my head).

&gt; _I_ am sick of being told to study something I find boring, and that I 
&gt; can see no immediate use for. If I can't use it I wont remember it. I 
&gt; would much rather hone my problem solving skills solving problems I have 
&gt; some interest in.

The problem is that:
- the areas you're interested in may not expand your problem solving skills 
in the way that will really help you.
- Immediate use is a crock.  There are many things I learnt at Uni in 
subjects that I did NOT enjoy that many years later became very relevant.  
- As a student doing a degree you may not be in the best position to 
decide what's really worth doing, because you do not have the benefit of 
hindsight after having completed your degree.

As an example, some of the things I did in Maths helped me understand and 
therefore provide a better solution for a customer at DSTO, not because I 
really need to know it, but merely because by understanding his problem 
better the solution fitted it more closely.  How the heck would I have known 
if this was relevant 6 year prior when I was doing the subject?  Having done 
Chemistry at uni (at a 1st year level) helped me understand customers trying 
to run big simulations for deriving molecular shapes.  I didn't need to, but 
it helped me provide a better solutions. etc etc.

If you would rather skip boring things altogether then I'm not sure how you 
cope with life.  I often do boring things just so I can do the interesting 
things later.  

&gt; Precisely, let me do a CS major. This implies I want to do CS subjects 
&gt; as the core and then I can choose what else I do to fill out the 
&gt; remaining units. (If I wanted Ma&CS I would have done what you did :) )

See above.
