Ian,

&gt; yeah Mandrake seems better all round as a family grade, fun and easy to use
&gt; distribution that is only 10 times more stable than Windows which is not too
&gt; high on the *nix scale of things ;-) on a scale from Windows to BSD???

Agreed.

&gt; I am even considering breaking out of my comfort zone and maybe giving BSD a
&gt; bash - I keep hearing stories of it's incredibly stability and tight code -
&gt; surely BSD could handle VMWare, Squid, firewalling, etc?  What about Debian?
&gt; Is that better for all of the above?

It's different but not necessarily better.

I could burn you a copy of FreeBSD 4.6 if you want...

&gt; dedicated Windows 2000 running on VMWare with MS Word, etc permanently
&gt; running for him (he just wants to use word processing).

Then what's wrong with Star Office or Open Office Writer?

&gt; I presume VMWare can be set up to use a printer no problem?

Never set it up but I know others have done it quite successfully.

&gt; BTW - did anyone read yesterdays Australian IT section?  There was mention
&gt; of a secure laptop that runs Windows 2000 on top of Debian for added
&gt; security and stability.  How BIZARRE is that - that I was just talking about
&gt; it the other day?  Seems I am not the first to suspect that *nix could
&gt; actually HELP windows function better - I find that totally ironic - it must
&gt; upset Uncle Bill.

OMG
