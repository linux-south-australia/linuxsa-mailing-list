&gt;What you are asserting is that it is wrong for you to be forced to buy a

More like a ford car with a Mitsubishi engine, but that engine came with 
a separate licence to the car which stated that you could return the 
engine to the place of purchase if you didn't agree with the licence.

Anyway, the software issue is different to the hardware components. 
AFAIK the hard drive, CPU or whatever don't come with separate licences 
that you can accept or reject. What toshiba is doing is they are saying 
"screw the windows licence, we'll override it with our own master 
licence that you agree to simply by opening the package!"...

Wow, nice contract that one... Imagine you get a mystery parcel one day, 
and you open it to find a note "By opening this package you agree to pay 
us $100". What a scam that would be! Not unlike the Winblows scam 
currently in place.

Personally I think he will have to return the entire product, which 
seems fair enough.

On a side note: any shops in Adelaide that sell laptops with no OS?
