There is a port for VMware (which astonished me when I first saw it, but I
tried it and it works.) This is because there is a pretty good
implementation of Linux syscalls and a Linux environment. VMware includes
all sorts of tricks that it does behind the kernel's back in welded-shut
binary code but still manages to work. The /proc filesystem emulation
isn't complete, and some packages that get too x86-specific don't work,
especially virtual 86 mode (which is why VMware surprised me.)

&gt; Given that most of the XFS stuff is implemented in kernel land,

Filesystems are different. If you want a Linux filesystem on BSD, you have
to port it to the BSD kernel. I gather the Linux VFS is regarded as wild
and hairy by FreeBSD developers, although since we have one of the few
FreeBSD core developers here who has written to the Linux VFS I should
probably stop spouting. Greg?

&gt; It all depends on what your firewall needs to do, how much time you've
&gt; got and what you know. I would think that for most people's
&gt; firewalling needs, both are roughly equal. OpenBSD's becoming more
&gt; popular in this field too. It might be worth looking at that too (but
&gt; don't tell Theo I said that :-)).

Magic graphical we-do-all-the-thinking-for-you firewall writing tools tend
to be implemented more for Linux (chains and tables) than BSD. That
matter to a lot of people who aren't too sure about developing their own
firewall from scratch. 

I get the feeling that there are many more all-in-one-box firewall
solutions available based on BSD than the relative popularity of the two
OSs might indicate. Firewalling is a particular BSD strength. The
allegedly most popular commercial firewall in the world (Nokia) ran for
most of its life on BSD before erlatively recently changing to Linux for
reasons not related to its firewalling abilities.
