&gt; 6) The original BSD license with an advertising clause is well known

Well, I'd like to don my FreeBSD Core Team hat, but then the mailing
list would reject my message :-(

The FreeBSD Core Team believes that it is not possible to update the
four-clause license to a three or two clause license without the
permission of the original authors.  There are very few licenses which
you can't change with the permission of the original authors, so we
take this as a "no".  Note that such an update would effectively
remove clauses with no replacement, which is generally not
permissible.

&gt; In fact I have never met anyone who can tell me how all the dozens
&gt; of licenses in a BSD distribution interact. (Nor anyone that really
&gt; cares.)

Oh, we have a few flamers on the FreeBSD lists who care beyond any
reason.  Ever heard of Brett Glass?  He's just found an inaccuracy in
some statement in <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</A>#bsd.  Can
anybody spot what Brett thinks is wrong?

Seriously, though, our approach is:

1.  Code which can be freely redistributed with no strings attached
    can coexist in the same trees.
2.  GNU code gets put in a separate tree, /usr/src/gnu.
3.  Other code maintained outside the FreeBSD project gets put in the
    directory /usr/src/contrib.

You may ask about the advertising clauses.  Well, we mention the fact
in various places, but the total number of contributors has been too
large to state on the installation media.  Effectively clauses 3 and 4
are dead.
