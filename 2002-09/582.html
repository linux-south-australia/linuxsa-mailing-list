&gt; &gt; But at the end of the day, Toshiba sell computers.  The software that
&gt; &gt; you run on said computer is your own business.  So, why should I be
&gt; &gt; forced to pay for software (that Toshiba don't even make, they just sell
&gt; &gt; it because the evil empire is forcing them) that I'll never use.  They
&gt; &gt; surely can't justify that.
&gt;
&gt; You are not forced to pay for software ... You are required to pay for a
&gt; package that Toshiba sell. There are other machines you can buy out there
&gt; that don't come with an OS. Let's face it, Toshiba don't sell the only
&gt; laptops, or even the best laptops!

That's very true and on the one hand it seems only fair that Toshiba have
the right to package their hardware with whatever software they like. But is
it right or fair that the industry, if it were to so choose, could
completely remove the option for the consumer (to buy their computer
hardware without OS). Should that right (to have that choice) rest with the
manufacturers/sellers or with the consumer?

&gt; What you are asserting is that it is wrong for you to be forced to buy a
&gt; car from Ford, and be forced to pay for a Ford engine in it. You should be
&gt; allowed to buy the car, minus engine, and then buy a reco Jap engine and
&gt; add it in your self.

Hmmm, not sure I agree with the analogy and I think it's hard to actually
find one that correlates well. It's more like being forced to pay a licence
fee to MS for the right to use computer hardware. While it seems highly
improbable that the entire industry would conspire (or submit to MS'
coercion) to only package systems with MS Windows, there is definitely a
principle at stake that warrants consideration. If I was an economist I
could probably even tell you a name for it!
