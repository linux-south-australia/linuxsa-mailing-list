I don't know about the hardware issues, but I have an older Compaq 
Proliant I got at an auction for 75 bucks US.

It has 8 gigs, and I think is a 486. I was only able to get Windows NT 
3.51 on there. LInux wouldn't boot, and when I booted from a floppy, I 
couldn't read my cd, even with a Windoze start up disk.

Compaq has these "Smart Start" CD's that I used on the server to set it 
up in a basic way.  When I used the CD's I didn't know what the heck I 
was doing, but I remember that it asked me which operating system I 
wanted to install....I think. Anyway, I can check.

The smart start cd's booted...

The machine can also be used as a lamp stand. It is about as tall as my 
waist, and as wide as my leg. I think it may have as much power as my 
solar calculator. Well, actually a lot more than that, but I had to 
endure a few ribbings for buying that thing.... :-D  It is kinda noisy too.

I am *sure* that yours is a lot better than mine. :-D

Sometimes I will imagine carring that thing to a very difficult client's 
place of business, all the while telling them: "we are going to have to 
audit your computer now..."

&gt;Ok,

&gt;It's here and I've managhed to get it working although I've got this
&gt;weird setup where I have an IDE cable extending over and through one of
&gt;my boxes to another box. It has:
&gt;
&gt;* 1, 180Mhz Pentium Pro
&gt;* 8 Gb of storage (2 x 4Gb)
&gt;* Floppy Disk
&gt;* IDE interface to the CD drive
&gt;
&gt;The problem?
&gt;
&gt;* it won't recognise a:
&gt; o Windows NT 4 Startup Floppy
&gt; o RedHat 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 Startup Floppy (bootnet.img)
&gt; o SCO Unix i386 Startup Floppy (it gets to E and then hangs big time
&gt;for those who remember what SCO is like)
&gt; o a RedHat 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 startup CD
&gt;
&gt;* it will recognise a:
&gt; o FreeBSD 4.3 CD1
&gt; o FreeBSD 4.6 CD1
&gt;
&gt;This is weird. My CDROM can be cantankerous (it's an older, IDE CDROM
&gt;and I'm not sure how reliable it can be) but it's strange that FreeBSD
&gt;will behave itself whereas RedHat won't. This isn't a major concern --
&gt;this box is about to become my "Play with FreeBSD box". I'd give that
&gt;honour to my faster, more modern K6III-450 but I like my games.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone got any ideas about this odd behaviour?
&gt;
&gt;By the way, anyone happen to have a "Power Module" for the processor on
&gt;one of these beasts. I don't seem to need any fantabulous "riser cards"
&gt;(whatever they are) but a "Power Module", yes...
