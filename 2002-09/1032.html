That's definitely a post for the archives - I think you answered quite a few
questions!

You are right about the power output.  If I use a mast - I *may* look at a
*small* amplifier to compensate for coax loss - but you appear to be saying
that all this is completely un-necessary with a good card, good cable (and
short distance) and good aerial - preferably directional for community
networking.

Theoretically - if one can get a decent bit rate up to say 2kms - that
should be fine.  What if a dish is used?  No different to a directional
antennae I suppose.  2.4GHz is approaching microwave frequencies right?  So
some sort of dish should be possible to make it ultra-directional and less
likely to interfere with other nearby networks.

It's a novel concept that one even needs to consider that their antennae is
not *so* good that it exceeds legal restrictions..  I better keep those
Pringles cans under control..

On a side note - is it worth experimenting with lasers?  Theoretically - it
would be like open fibre - but extremely prone to the beam being blocked by
birds, low lying cloud, humidity, etc (well 2.4GHz microwaves would also be
affected by humidity I would think).

I was thinking that lasers are obviously good for directionality and for bit
rate.  I am not sure how expensive or hard it would be to set up.  I don't
know if there are some fault tolerant media converters out there - and plug
in a laser instead of a fibre cable.  I imagine one could get some really
good distances like this too.  Would be REAL pain to set up and align
correctly though..

How much higher in frequency is low infra-red compared to a 5GHz anyway?  It
seems radio technology is approaching the frequencies of light?  Could be
bad news if it takes on the properties of light - having to yell at the kids
for standing in the way of the wireless NIC.

&gt; &gt;From Surecom - someone told me to get cards of at least 100mw - I am not
&gt; sure if this makes much of a difference - or if 30mw is just the standard
&gt; output and 100mw is the exception?

Ive seen comparison tables around, that showed that in general the prism
II cards did ~100mw and the lucent ones did less. There is no real
standard (AFAIK).

&gt; Apparently Cisco products are all 100mw?  Something to consider for
wireless
&gt; community networking - every mw counts!  But perhaps in-house a smaller
&gt; power output is more secure (and hence more wise) anyway.

Power doesnt usually make as much difference as good co-ax and height,
but at such low powers maybe it does.
 
&gt; Is it possible to rig up a 2.4GHz RF amplifier with directional dish to
&gt; create substantially higher bit rates over larger distances?  The up and
&gt; coming 54Mbit/s cards are looking good - but they operate in the 5GHz
range
&gt; - so it will be even more important to look at RF power, using a dish, and
&gt; so on.

Yes, but not necissarily legally. I think the ACA have attempted to keep
the power down so that if you want range you need to keep your RF beam
focused and thus are less likely to interfear with others networks on
the side. You could amp up the power massively, put a huge DB aerial on
it and boot out massively, but you'd be an inconsiderate bastard who
will probably have the aca knocking on your door when they get the
complaints from all the other smaller local operators whos networks you
just stuffed up. :) 
 

Some quotes from the wireless list:

&gt; I have just been talking to a HAM which I know about wireless 
&gt; and using
&gt; power amps to extend range. He seems to think that the use of 
&gt; poweramps
&gt; (like the 250mw and 400mw that some company who recently advertised on
&gt; this list have) are illegal to use in Australia. Unfortunatly 
&gt; where I am

If the power amps are designed for wireless service and are type
approved,
they are legal... BUT, only as long as the total effected radiated power
(EIRP) is less than 4 watts.  So, if you have a 24dBi dish fed from one
of these amps, you're well into illegal territory, but if instead,
you're feeding a 10dBi omnidirectional, a 400mW amp would put you at
maximum legal power.



.....and a later post ......



EIRP (dBW) = Tx power (dBW) + antenna gain (dBi) - coax losses (dB)

Simple as that


So, if you have a 1 watt transmitter into a 20dBi gain antenna and 3dB
of antenna loss, then the EIRP is...

0 + 20 - 3, = 17 dBW, or 50W.
FYP, 4W = +6 dBW, to save having to convert back to linear values.

Also, if antenna gain happens to be expressed in dBd, add 2.14 to get
dBi (doubt you'll see this, but it can happen).
