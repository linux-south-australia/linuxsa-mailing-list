&gt; Most databases use raw partitions, so in many important ways

True (but not in the special case of Cyrus, as mentioned earlier I don't
think there is any version of DB that uses raw partitions or devices.)

&gt; There are three major distinctions: Firstly filesystems support one
&gt; access path -- filename -- whereas databases can have multiple
&gt; access paths -- that is, you can have multiple keys.  You pay a
&gt; price for each additional access path.

This is true (until Reiser4 comes out)

&gt; Secondly, database indexes are tree-structured whereas filesystem
&gt; diretories are list-structured. 

Reiser3 is tree-structured. Reiser3 doesn't scale to large sizes (some
simple limits are still in there) but it is most definitely designed to be
viewed as a database if you choose. It does well with large numbers of
small files.

&gt; Write 100,000 files to a directory and 100,000 records to a database
&gt; and you'll see that the filesystem performance better with small
&gt; numbers of files but considerably worse with large numbers of files.

In the case of traditional filesystems (either list or log-structured)
this is true, including XFS. But I'm not sure that the IMAP problem is
always like this. Some kinds of company can have nearly all of their
emails with attachments. I know it sounds strange, but it is true. BASE64
encoding of M$ attachments frequently runs to multi-megabytes, which takes
the problem out of the "many small files" category.

A seeming advantage of a database of storing the different components in
separate tables and exploiting common properties to deliver better
performance or functionality is just not possible. Digital signatures and
shortcomings in MIME specifications mean that the entire message has to be
stored as one blob. This could really tip the scales in favour of
databases but an IMAP server designed to break many digital signatures
would not be regarded as a good thing.

&gt; Thirdly, databases are designed for transaction support.  That is,
&gt; to have a consistent user response time.  You can see this by
&gt; deleting those 100,000 files/records.  The filesystem will delay
&gt; other transactions, the database will deliver other transactions
&gt; with only a small performance hit.

This is a definite advantage of a database in the case of small files,
which is afterall true in many cases with IMAP.

&gt; Maildir++ has one other significant advantage over databases
&gt; for enterprise applications -- writing each message into a
&gt; distinct file allows heirarchical storage management (HSM)
&gt; systems to archive old unaccessed messages to near-line storage.
&gt; Filesystems like XFS are significantly more HSM-friendly than
&gt; databases.  Using a HSM gives a neat solution to disk space
&gt; implications of the use of e-mail folders as a corporate archive.

Not forgetting the storage expansion, synchronisation and non-IMAP 
access arguments, which all favour filesystems. The last one is slightly
circular though :-)

I think in summary its a bit like this:

  - with modern hardware and moderate load/size, any decent IMAP store is
    going to work. If you're thinking of a small workgroup load even the
    most inefficent common IMAP system around is probably going to work
    well enough to keep people happy

  - with high load/size, the specific characteristics of the problem will
    dictate which kind of underlying access mechanism makes the most sense
