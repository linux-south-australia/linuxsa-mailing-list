Hello ya'all.

I've posted about this topic before, but I am continually frustrated
with not being able to easily report on Internet usage around my
network.

I've used before and mentioned a program called "NTOP,"
<A HREF="http://www.ntop.org/,">http://www.ntop.org/,</A> however I've found its results to be a pain in the
ass or unreliable.

I have an ADSL router at the edge of my LAN, and a FreeBSD system
running natd.  I'd love to be able to view a port-by-port analysis,
which I could look at and would be able to work out for example "In the
last month, we did 5Gb of TCP traffic over port 80, but we did 3GB on
port 1214 [KaZaA or something.]"  Then it could do a host-by-host
analysis, or whatever is required.

NTOP Did that, kind of, but it sucks at it because it's not a good
reporting tool.  I just don't like it much.  It told me what I wanted to
know, but it didn't do it nicely.  How do other businesses monitor their
usage by stats and per user without restricting users to using a proxy?


We've had some problems lately I'd really like to get on top of, you
know, like 900Mb in one day, and then 900Mb the next on a
Saturday/Sunday, when normally on a Sat/Sun we'd get about 100Mb/30Mb
for the two days.  I could use MRTG to graph and follow spikes, but I
need better hardware before I can trace very far.  This also doesn't
tell me the REAL stuff I want to know, like which ports were used, etc.

What sits on the server, and rips all this stuff apart into an easy to
read report?

Should I change to WinNT and install Microsoft Internet Acceleration
Server, because it includes reporting I might be able to use? ;)
