(The following might be worth a read:

The problems with the above statement are manifold.

1. Most government departments are unlikely to be funding real ground 
breaking work that no one else is doing and so forth. That is just not how 
the development work happens and they are not that forward thinking.

2. There will always be a need for private companies, I believe. Some 
software will never get written unless there is a company willing to write 
it, and these people have a much right to use publically funded software 
as anyone else.

3. What we really need to avoid, as Lawrence Lessig says, is having a 
bunch of people constrain our future flexibility by taking good ideas 
developed with public funding and then patenting or applying copyright to 
simple extensions of those ideas so we can't make the same obvious 
improvements ourselves.

4. Governments should insist on and mandate open standards. They should 
not be in the business of mandating one software development philosophy 
over another, just as they should not be in the business of mandating one 
religion or race or etc. They should be able to choose the best tool for 
the job, but they should apply some fundamental rules, such as the tools 
should implement open standards. No exceptions.
