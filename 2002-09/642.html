&gt; Well,
&gt; 
&gt; I finally managed to get FreeBSD V4.6 up onto the Internet (thanks to
&gt; Ben Close who leant me the CD with XFree86 packages). It feels almost
&gt; like home except I can't mount most of my Linux stuff because I use
&gt; XFS and that's not part of FreeBSD to my knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; A few "newbie" and maybe some "advanced" questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Are there any known comparisons between FreeBSD's handling of
&gt;    TCP/IP networking between Linux and FreeBSD? Specifically, comparisons
&gt;    on speed, efficiency and reasonably unbiased?

They appear comparible. I notice that FreeBSD 4.3, which I currently use, 
does not seem to coalesce ACKs, while Linux will, but apart from that, 
they both seem to do a similarly good job of getting packets onto the 
wire.

Oh, and I have never seen FreeBSD nor Linux have a bad word to say about 
other operating systems, so I guess they are unbiased.
 
&gt; 2) Just how compatible is the compatibility binary layer? I've got
&gt;    Netscape 4.79 running under it quite nicely, but I am sort of
&gt;    wondering whether I could port some of the XFS material into
&gt;    FreeBSD and at the same time document XFS while I go at it.

I believe you want the Linux compaibility stuff for FreeBSD.

&gt; 3) Is there anyone local such as Netcraft who sells prepackaged
&gt;    FreeBSD stuff? My ISP is just too slow to cope with the ports
&gt;    collection, which incidentallly, is why I'm not a debian user.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) If one were to choose between a Linux 2.4.X (latest stable) and
&gt;    a FreeBSD 4.X-STABLE for a firewall assuming that I were to have
&gt;    all the time in the world to set one up, read documentation and 
&gt;    so forth, what reasons would favour one over the other?

I don't think one is intrinsically better than the other in that regard. 
They are just different. FreeBSD has ipfilter, which seems very good, 
while Linux 2.4 has iptables.
