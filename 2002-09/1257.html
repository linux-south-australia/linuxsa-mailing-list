How to use a Compusa PC Camera (SKU# 285905) in Linux [AKA XIRLINK; IBM 
NET CAMERA] [9-28-2002] [2.4.18] [SuSE 8]

September 28, 2002

My system is SuSE Linux 8 Professional, Kernel 2.4.18.

*The Compusa PC Camera (SKU# 285905) is currently being sold by Compusa 
(www.compusa.com) for $19.99 US.  The address on the box reads:

Compusa
Dallas, Texas 75420
USA.

(I am considering buying about 10 of these puppies and selling them for 
cost to anyone that was even 1/2 as frustrated as I was. If you are 
really desparate email me. I won't take advantage of you.)

If you are frustrated, skip down to the section labeled:      Shut up 
and just tell me what to do to get this running!


So, what's the big deal?

It is very difficult to obtain a new webcam that will work in Linux. 
This is because most, if not all, of the manufacturers will not make 
video capturing software for your new camera for Linux.  So that leaves 
it up to you to find someone that, by chance, has made a driver for your 
camera. Since it takes a long time for someone with the skills, time and 
inclination to put together his own software for a video camera with a 
one to two year life cycle, the camera is usually not available any more 
by the time the driver is ready.

So you might think that you could print out a list of cameras and then 
simply go to your local computer store and buy a camera that's on a list 
of Linux compatable cameras, but that is not really the case. At least 
it wasn't as of September of 2002. Instead, I found that most of the 
cameras that were listed as being Linux compatable were either: not sold 
anymore, rare, or no longer supported because of a design change.

Prior to today, I had already bought THREE web cams:

Labtech
Logitech Quickcam Express
IBM Net Camera Pro

I had spent hours searching and then attempting to install the camera, 
but the darn things just wouldn't work. I even went as far as to 
subscribe to the kernel mailing list as "berthabrains" (&lt;----just so 
someone would notice me amongst the flood of emails that come through 
every day) but all I got was RTF'nM!

I finally went back to Compusa hoping to buy a VEO Stingray, which was 
supposedly the exact camera as a circa 2001 IBM Net Camera. According to 
the guy that makes the driver for these cameras, my camera, the Net 
Camera Pro was the only camera his driver did not support. Accordingly, 
I was only able to get the camera's green light to come on.

When I arrived at Compusa, I found a Compusa brand camera for $19.99, 
that had the exact same design as my IBM Net Camera. So, I took a chance 
and bought the camera hoping that it was indeed the same Xirlink 
manufactured IBM Net Camera that Dimitri talked about on his web page. 
And from my accounting background, I know that generic brand items are 
just the left over unsold brand name items with a vanilla look. I also 
felt it unlikely that the basic design would have been modified, as this 
was clearly the end of the product's life cycle. So I bought it and the 
rest is history.

On a personal level, I wrote these instructions because I don't want 
anyone to have to struggle as much as I did to use a stinkin' webcam.

In all honesty, the biggest obsticle to getting a webcam to work in 
LInux is having enough correct information so you will obtain the proper 
equipment, use the proper tools and follow the proper procedure.

If you would like to see how surprised I was when the the camera worked, 
click here. Be warned it is a big file and it is in avi format,

Junk!


Shut up and just tell me what to do to get this running!



Alright! :-)

Here are the step by step instructions to get a camera working in Linux:

First, a caveat, I got this to work under the conditions oulined above. 
Any differences could make a difference in the outcome. Please keep that 
in mind. You can deviate, I am just letting you know what worked for me.

1. Install SuSE Linux 8
2. Make sure xawtv is installed. I am using version 3.72.
3. Obtain your webcam. Make sure it is the exact webcam I listed above.*
4. Log in as root
5. Go to the shell
6. Type "modprobe ibmcam" in the shell. When you type the command, don't 
use the quotes! :)
7. Type "xawtv -noxr"

That's it.

P.S. Now I have to learn CVS.
