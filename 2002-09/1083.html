&gt; Cyrus works well and is a very nice piece of work. I use it.

I've dallied with it, on a home machine.

&gt;    1) it uses a closed black-box model for data storage, as far as MUA
&gt;       software is concerned. The only way an MUA can get to mail data is
&gt;       if it can talk IMAP. There are many situations where this is not
&gt;       helpful. I can provide examples if required. (In some situations this
&gt;       is an excellent idea, because it enforces a standard.)
&gt;
&gt;    2) it implements this black-box using the well-known Berkeley DB
&gt;       database (instead of the Maildir-like system it used to use.) The
&gt;       trouble is, database performance drops off much faster than
&gt;       filesystem performance when you get to large sizes, especially for
&gt;       objects that databases aren't very good at handling such as BLOBs.
&gt;       Most people don't hit this limit. But if you are after maximum
&gt;       speed, a DB won't give it to you compared to a filesystem
&gt;       especially for uncomplicated access patterns. Modern hardware often
&gt;       makes this a non-issue for all but very big or very heavy-use setups.
&gt;
&gt;    3) You can't avoid SASL for authentication. I think this is still a
&gt;       restriction (should check to make sure it is still true.) SASL is
&gt;       not one of the big standards around, meaning you have to write and
&gt;       maintain glue.

Ditto these. Number 1 extends a bit further than might be immediately
obvious. For instance, forget using procmail anymore (at least, in any
easy fashion) - cyrus 'wants' you to be using sieve. I never could get
sieve going.

I also could never get cyrus to authenticate from /etc/passwd either,
and mailbox setup, while versatile, again needs lots of glue.

I tried Courier IMAP and was pleasantly surprised at the ease of setup
and management. So pleased that I did a LinuxSA talk
(<A HREF="http://hawkins.id.au/Software/Mail_Filtering/Presentation/">http://hawkins.id.au/Software/Mail_Filtering/Presentation/</A>) on the
topic of mail filtering, with a Courier IMAP component, and wrote a
bunch of web pages (<A HREF="http://hawkins.id.au/Software/Mail_Filtering/">http://hawkins.id.au/Software/Mail_Filtering/</A>) on
how to put it all together.

[ What a shameless plug! ]

Courier IMAP setup has a whole two paragraphs devoted to it - which
indicates how easy it is to setup.
