&gt; &gt;&gt;Stay.  Go.  Your choice.  But don't cut off your nose.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; FWIW this is the most constructive and sensible post I have ever seen
&gt; &gt; from David N (who has been known to suffer from SOL in past postings).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can only suggest that Rob and any other offended person read, mark and
&gt; &gt; inwardly digest.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, insisting that people grow thicker skin and learn to
&gt; deal with abuse should by no means justify that it is okay to
&gt; intentionally and repeatedly insult people.

Who said it did?

&gt; It also does not exempt such
&gt; abuse from critisism. Nor does it make such abuse socially acceptable on
&gt; or off LinuxSA.

Ditto.

Your post is just what David N was on about.
Why MUST you look for trouble and read into a post something not there about 
which you can be offended and make unconstructive comment?
BACK OFF!.
