Thanks Michael

Log rotate is set to run daily under RH7.3. by this I mean there is a file 
/etc/cron.daily/logrotate, meaning it is called daily but seems to be hanging 
around rather than running and then exiting. the /etc/logrotate.conf file 
specifies to rotate the logs weekly.

I'm still stumped as to why it takes so much memory and CPU time though.


I've moved /etc/cron.daily/slocate.cron to monthly as I don't use locate very 
often.

&gt; &gt; Every morning I find that there is a process called logrotate that is
&gt; &gt; hogging 35MB or more of ram and using a high percentage of the CPU load.
&gt; &gt; From the name I can guess what it is supposed to be doing but does it
&gt; &gt; really need that much ram and CPU time to swap a few files around? Is
&gt; &gt; this a bug or does this process really use that much?
&gt;
&gt; Hi Jarrad,
&gt;
&gt; I only have a RH7.0 box in front of me, so I can only speak about that
&gt; version, but logrotate appears to do it's stuff on a monthly, not daily
&gt; basis.  Have a look at /etc/logrotate.conf
&gt;
&gt; There's no reported errata for logrotate in RH7.3 (see
&gt; <A HREF="http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh73-errata.html">http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh73-errata.html</A>)
&gt;
&gt; Do you watch the X files?  If it's not that I'm not sure what else it could
&gt; be.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Because it is using a good percentage of my system ram, it makes
&gt; &gt; everything else run really slow as the system needs to swap things in and
&gt; &gt; out of disk. I can kill the process off (which I don't really like doing
&gt; &gt; but is the only way to get a usable system) and everything comes good but
&gt; &gt; soon after, another process called updatedb starts. this uses alot of IO
&gt; &gt; time on the disk and also slows things down. is it safe stop updatedb
&gt; &gt; from running and if so, how?
&gt;
&gt; rpm -qfi `which updatedb` will tell you all about what updatedb is all
&gt; about. If you add an 'l' to the rpm switches you'll see
&gt; that /etc/cron.daily/slocate.cron is part of the suite.  Taking this file
&gt; out of /etc/cron.daily will stop it running daily.  You can probably guess
&gt; that moving it to cron.weekly or cron.monthly will delay the updates, but
&gt; still do it occasionally.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt;
&gt; Michael...
