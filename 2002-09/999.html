Evan nods :D
I agree with Glen.

I think that what makes Linux so attractive to us is what restricts its
wide acceptance by Joe Bloggs. The lack of a consistant UI. Don't give me
CUI over GUI arguments our users want GUI so GUI they shall have.

The fact we have so many flavours is good, people dont necessarily see that
though and view RH/Suse et al as 'LINUX' - The step we need to take in
trying to have an Enterprise desktop solution is to choose
KDE/GNOME/&lt;whatever&gt; and go from there, the closer the match to windows the
more people like it I guess, I was being nagged by my son to put Linux back
on his system (he prefers the games) but he also wants his win32 based
games, so I got a copy of WinLinux wich is a RH variant with umsdos based
FS and went through the setup on my machine before giving him the CD to
install it (he's 9). The KDE (3.0) looks so nice and with an appropriate
theme looks far better than ANY Win32 UI I have seen. 

So it isnt hard to offer a better looking/performing OS but if only MS
would offer their office products on this platform (they do for OSX) so it
surely cant be that hard and just think how much happier the world would be :P

&gt;
&gt;Hi Evan,
&gt;
&gt;As far as management is concerned Linux is inferior.  Their
&gt;computing world view is: e-mail client, word processing,
&gt;spreadsheets and presentations.  Microsoft have best-in-class
&gt;products in all of these areas.  Linux options are comparable
&gt;or worse (eg: compare Excel and Scalc).
&gt;
&gt;So I totally understand a manager that might view MS favourably,
&gt;because from where they sit MS is the better platform.
&gt;
&gt;It's up to IT staff that want to run Linux to make reasonable
&gt;arguments if they want to run Linux across an enterprsise.  This
&gt;is easiest where Linux is used for infrastructure applications.
&gt;
&gt;For desktop applications the "technical superiority" argument
&gt;isn't true, so appeals need to be made to value for money.
&gt;Linux may not even compete on value for money -- the inconsistency
&gt;of the user interface adds significantly to training and support
&gt;costs.  One day's additional training for a Linux-based application
&gt;is enough to pay for a Windows OS+Office license.
&gt;
&gt;For enterprises looking to save money there is another desktop
&gt;alternative: Windows OS + StarOffice.  Unless Linux makes some
&gt;significant user interface improvements I wouldn't expect to see
&gt;Linux + StarOffice deployments beyond what used to be the OS/2
&gt;market (banks, etc).
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Glen (who uses desktop Linux and OpenOffice extensively)
&gt;
