Hi list,

I am not surprised that there is some email weirdness going on. It seems 
to be all over the place.

I check a _lot_ of mail, of which, about 50% is addressed to elected 
City Council Members, including my boss.

I have recently noticed an increase of virus mails, which were getting 
past the City's Microsoft Exchange mail server as frequently as once a 
month, even though the City's server had Norton Antivirus installed.

The ones that got through looked to have no message contents or 
attachments, with a message subject with a tad of jibberish. Typically, 
these virii would be embedded in the message source, desguising itself 
as a some sort of MIME type. The recipient would receive what would 
appear to be a blank message.

**

I have also seen a number of posts about the Klez virus on Lindows.com.

Here is an interesting one from Lindows.com:

&gt; To dispell any myths, or misunderstood information about klez, I refer 
&gt; any one interested to a link 
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.klez.e</A>@mm.html&gt; 
&gt; which will provide all the facts about the virus. Here are some 
&gt; excepts form that page:
&gt;
&gt; The worm searches the Windows address book, the ICQ database, and 
&gt; local files (such as .html and text files) for email addresses. The 
&gt; worm sends an email message to these addresses with itself as an 
&gt; attachment. The worm contains its own SMTP engine and attempts to 
&gt; guess at available SMTP servers.
&gt;
&gt; The subject line, message bodies, and attachment file names are 
&gt; random. The from address is randomly chosen from email addresses that 
&gt; the worm finds on the infected computer.
&gt;
&gt; Then in notes it adds:
&gt; Because this worm does use a randomly chosen address that it finds on 
&gt; an infected computer as the "From:" address, numerous cases have been 
&gt; reported in which users of uninfected computers receive complaints 
&gt; that they have sent an infected message to someone else.
&gt;
&gt; So in effect, the worm can harvest e-mails addresses stored locally, 
&gt; ie browser cache, text documents, databases. And picks them randomnly
&gt;
&gt; It further adds:
&gt;
&gt; There have been several reports that, in some cases, if you receive a 
&gt; message that the virus has sent using its own SMTP engine, the message 
&gt; appears to be a "postmaster bounce message" from your own domain
&gt;
&gt; On last note, I have cleaned it from over fifty computers, the latest 
&gt; variant seems to quite robust, and in most cases the removal tool 
&gt; fails. I have to put the infected drives into my system to clean them. 
&gt; Hope this helps someone.
&gt;
&gt; Addendum: Someone asked about checking headers, and so when a recent 
&gt; rash hit my wifes PC from her aunt, I checked the headers and they 
&gt; were all return path to her aunt, but the from field was from someone 
&gt; else, so it looks like it may be possible to narrow it down from the 
&gt; e-mail headers.
