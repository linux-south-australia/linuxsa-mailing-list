&gt; I want to copy a file between two servers every night.
&gt; Of course, I want this to be done automatically and in a secure manner.

Automatically implies cron, although there are many other ways you can
automate a task.  But cron is intended to run commands on a regular basis,
so that's probably what you should use.

Secure is not a very well defined word.  It means different things to
different people.  For example, some people might understand that to
mean that the contents of the file should be encrypted during transit,
whereas other people might understand it to mean that you should have to
type a password before the command runs.  Obviously since you want this
to be automatic, you don't mean the latter.  You probably mean that you
don't want the facility to be able to be abused.

I'd suggest using ssh, because you can configure it so that it doesn't
require a password, and can only be used to copy receive the file.  You do
that by creating a public/private key pair, which stands in place of a
password, and setting th receiving machine so that it only permits you to
save to the one file.  You do still need to keep the private certificate
secure on the sending machine, otherwise anybody who obtains it might
be able to send their own arbitrary garbage in place of your file.

I've done this (sort of thing) using SSH2.  First you need to construct
the key pair.  On the sending machine, use ssh-keygen2.  There are many
options that you can tweak, so read the man page, but as a minimum you
should use a command like this to generate your key pair:

   ssh-keygen2 -P -o server1

This will generate a key pair, with a NULL passphrase, and store it in
the two files, server1 and server1.pub.  There's no point in having a
passphrase, since you won't be around to type it anyway.

The file, sendtoserver2.pub, contains no really vital information, so
keeping its content secret is not hugely vital.  Transfer that file to
the receiving machine, and store it in the .ssh2 directory of the
account that will receive the file.  If you were really paranoice you
might create a new account just to receive the file, but I do think
that's a little over the top.

Next you need to create an authorization file on the receiving machine,
to limit what can be done with the key.  A file like this will do:

   server1:
   Host server1.my.domain.au
   Key server1.pub
   Command /home/martin/bin/receivefile
   *:

This will ensure that the command, /home/martin/bin/receivefile, is
the *only* command that can be run when server1 authenticates using the
matching private key.

You also need to create the command, /home/martin/bin/receivefile.
It doesn't need to be fancy:

   #!/bin/sh
   cat &gt; /home/martin/incoming/file

Finally, your cron entry, on server1, should invoke ssh to copy the file.
You need to make sure that ssh won't ask any questions (because you
aren't there to answer them!)  To send the file, say every Sunday at 2
minutes past midnight:

   2 0 * * 0 ssh2 -i /home/martin/etc/server1 -q -e none <A HREF="mailto:martin@server2">martin@server2</A> &lt; /home/martin/outgoing/file

(Beware possible line wrapping on the above line.)

This specifies that your private key is in /home/martin/etc/server1, and
assumes that you want to transfer the file, /home/martin/outgoing/file.
