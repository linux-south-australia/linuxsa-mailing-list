Barney,

&gt; David, you need to get some sleep or something.

Do I?

&gt; I had recently been
&gt; thinking you had improved on your childish whining when people asked for
&gt; help in a manner that wasn't exactly following your template of how the
&gt; peasants must ask for your almighty assistance

It is you who are calling me almighty; I've never said anything to that
point.

&gt; but it appears it was
&gt; only a passing phase and you are back to your old, vitriolic, annoying,
&gt; _unhelpful_ self.

It would be unwise to accuse me of being unhelpful. My suggestion would
be for you to concentrate on "vitriolic" and "annoying". I would kindly
suggest you make a clearer definition of "helpful" before you start on
that one.
 
&gt; Rob, don't let him discourage you, he believes just because he may have
&gt; a valid point it entitles him to point it out in the rudest, least
&gt; compassionate way possible.

I interpreted what I think Rob was saying and I then proceeded to answer
it.

&gt;  &gt; (2) If English isn't your first language, you can speak to me (or the
&gt;  &gt; list) in French, German or Italian. I think I can translate them better
&gt;  &gt; than...oh let's not get personal...[read: the crap I attempted to
&gt;  &gt; translate above]
&gt; 
&gt; David is just pointing out that he is a grumpy prick.

Am I now? Why don't you post a signed letter to that effect to the
Advertiser?

&gt; David is trying to justify rudeness by saying he didn't _have_ to reply,
&gt; and hoping you will feel indebted to him regardless of his insulting
&gt; behavior.

I was not justifying anything at all. I was pointing out that noone
around here actually needs to answer anything...

&gt; David, remember the old adage, "If you can't find something nice to
&gt; say...". You may find it annoying to read mail that isn't up to your
&gt; standards, but ripping into them DOES NOT HELP!

You should own that statement; I'm going to interpret your last point as
"in my opinion, ripping into them DOES NOT HELP!". Note that I've added
"in my opinion". 

In mythology there are the nice, mother goddesses (but not all mother
goddesses are what we would call nice [eg Kali]) who will say "maybe you
should have done things a different way. Isis and Athena are both good
examples of this type of goddess. There are also the other type of
goddesses. They say "you stuffed up badly, go fix it, here's how and
I'll help you if you get into too much trouble BUT if your ship sinks
then too bad - it was your fault anyway". Bast and Hecate are both these
types.

&gt; Rob, if I remember correctly, there is a similar tool in KDE called kppp
&gt; to what you would be using in Gnome. Setting it up should not effect the
&gt; setup of the gnome tool.

:-)

&gt; David, regardless of whether you answered the question or not, the
&gt; manner in which you did so probably means that it didn't get through to
&gt; Rob anyway.

I quote myself:

---
* Use the KDE menus to find something that might like like an Internet
dialer (you found the Gnome ones...what is so difficult in finding the
KDE ones? Hmmmm....)
---
In brackets I pointed out that Rob has found the Gnome ones and had a
guess at how he found them. I've indicated that using the same
methodology he may be able to stumble across the KDE one. There aren't
too many KDE menus I could be referring to and I'm sure he'd understand
what an Internet dialer is.

&gt; That said I think it is debatable whether you
&gt; answered the questions with a solution that is suitable for Rob's level
&gt; of expertise anyway.

It is not debatable at all. How about this solution that I proposed:

---
If you can't use xman well:

a) either convince me to help you in person
b) work out how to use the man pages
---

Whilst I may have issues with difficult to understand writing [I can
talk -- I tend to string a huge amount of subordinate clauses onto my
main clause but I stay grammatical] there's a number of people on this
list still who've actually found (a) to be quite possible.

&gt; Giving him 20 different
&gt; options might not be the best way about helping

Linux is about choice; I didn't assume simply because his grammar was up
the creek that he wouldn't understand how to open up a terminal, become
root and type commands. I've also not assumed that he likes GUIs. There
are people of his age who, because they are familiar with DOS, are more
comfortable with bash even though they could just as easily use KDE or
GNOME.

If he is, indeed, as old as you claim then I'm sure he's quite capable
of not doing what he can't do.

&gt; I would have thought
&gt; pointing him at the KDE equivalent of the gnome tool he is using, with
&gt; reassurances that using one won't screw up the other, would have been
&gt; sufficient.

I don't spoon feed newbies, students or anyone. I prefer them to have to
some work so they can understand.

&gt; Follow this with extra reading if you must, but don't
&gt; overwhelm him with sarcastic comments about the command line etc. He can
&gt; get to that in his own time, if he feels he needs to.

Communitites are made up of different people, with different
personalities, with different objectives and different agendas. Some
people in the LinuxSA community see LinuxSA as a dry, technical forum
where people can post for help, perhaps find out a little bit of
information and generally talk about Linux. Other people see LinuxSA as
a dynamic forum where people can talk about open source, but especially
Linux, and where people can find help to help themselves.

&gt;  &gt; [WARNING: I have received a huge shipment of oil from Iraq. And I've
&gt;  &gt; started on the Qu'Ran again ;-)]
&gt; 
&gt; Whatever. If you think people might flame you for your comments, maybe
&gt; this is an indication that you should temper them a little, don't you think?

You are making assumptions about my objectives, aren't you?

&gt; PS. I'm not in this for a flame session, unlike you obviously are David.

Am I?

&gt; I just hope you
&gt; aren't this rude when you meet people to help them out.

My sense of humour is biting and sarcastic, both in e-mail and in
person, and it's not something I'm going to change. Also, I decline to
call a spade a heart. Awful grammar is just that: awful grammar ;-)

[at least last time I looked it was - we could get into a philosophical
debate about what is real and what is not]
