<H1>Will AUUG represent Linux with equal validity?</H1>

On this list there has been little distinction between, Linux and the
BSD's.  For all intents and purposes, we have been treating them as one
(mostly).

I have to wonder though, is AUUG, the most appropriate body to be
representing a combination a OS software when negotiating with the
government. Take Greg's mail below for instance. The thrust of the
article was Linux based, and more than likely the Linux phenomenon is
making waves in all government departments and hence rational thinking
people will evaluate its effectiveness for their needs.

Yet at the end Greg clearly indicates that his push is for BSD and
making it an attractive option for filling government roles, which I
must say is great in itself, but will AUUG, work for The "Australian
Unix Users Group" commercial Unix's included, to the detriment of Linux.

Will Linux, considering it is Linux that has turned the world on its
head get fair representation from AUUG?

Lastly, my reason for this post comes from my attendance at the AUUG
security symposium last year. It was quite apparent from vendors and
AUUG attendees, that Linux was seen as tolerable, but in many aspects  
not what was wanted. They would much rather have seen one of the BSD
going great guns, rather than Linux.

And do I really want BSD being funded for improvement by government
departments,(public money)  so that corporations can take the best bits
and make them propriety?

Have Linux groups dropped the ball on this, should we have Incorporated
across the country?

Just my rambling thoughts

&gt;   The National Office of the Information Economy plans to organise a
&gt;   briefing on the use of Linux at the enterprise level for chief
&gt;   information officers and chief technology officers in the public
&gt;   sector.
&gt; 
&gt;   NOIE Business Strategies Branch general manager Steve Alford said the
&gt;   organisation had been thinking of a briefing for agencies on Linux and
&gt;   other Open Source software for some time. "The proposal for a briefing
&gt;   on this issue was tested with public sector IT managers and they were
&gt;   supportive. The briefing will be held later this year or early in
&gt;   2003."
&gt; 
&gt;   Alford said the idea had originated with the NOIE which had then
&gt;   canvassed IBM's interest in participating. IBM had been helpful in
&gt;   providing information on Open Source Software issues to date, he
&gt;   added.
&gt; 
&gt;   It is relevant to note that two government agencies, Veterans' Affairs
&gt;   and Centrelink, have started using Linux.
&gt; 
&gt;   The CIOs of all Commonwealth agencies would be invited to the
&gt;   briefing, Alford said, adding that there was no compulsion to attend;
&gt;   it depended on the individual's interest.
&gt; 
&gt;   The NOIE has talked to the Australian Unix and Open Systems User Group
&gt;   about the briefing.
&gt; 
&gt;   AUUG treasurer Gordon Hubbard said the government was starting to see
&gt;   Linux and other Open Computing platforms as a way to control IT
&gt;   costs. "The NOIE is clearly responding to the needs of government CIOs
&gt;   to learn as much as possible about the financial advantages for their
&gt;   organisations," Hubbard said.
&gt; 
&gt;   Active lobbying by vendors and AUUG had played some role in this move,
&gt;   Hubbard said. "The AUUG board has recently formed a six-person
&gt;   subcommittee called Open Computing for Government. I'm chairing the
&gt;   subcommittee and Greg Lehey (AUUG President) is deputy chair."
&gt; 
&gt; Gordon and I met Steve Alford in Melbourne earlier this month.  He
&gt; made a much better impression on us than we expected, and we realise
&gt; that we still need to find our feet in this material.  If anybody has
&gt; interesting opinions or ideas, we'd welcome them.  Note that we're
&gt; talking about solid business reasons why the Government should use
&gt; BSD, not ideological ones.
