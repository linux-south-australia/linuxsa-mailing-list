I read the digest.  I dont have the origional message. Sorry.

Some dude was wondering why he could get to www.mysite.org but not www.mysite.org/some/directory

I think you should check this out: <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html</A>#set-servername

&lt;--quote--&gt;
When you access a directory without a trailing "/", Apache needs to send what is called a redirect
to the client to tell it to add the trailing slash. If it did not do so, relative URLs would not
work properly. When it sends the redirect, it needs to know the name of the server so that it can
include it in the redirect. There are two ways for Apache to find this out; either it can guess,
or you can tell it. If your DNS is configured correctly, it can normally guess without any
problems. If it is not, however, then you need to tell it.

Add a ServerName directive to the config file to tell it what the domain name of the server is.
&lt;--quote--&gt;



And even more helpfule IMHO is from the http.conf file itself:
&lt;--quote--&gt;
#
# ServerName allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e., use
# "www" instead of the host's real name).
#
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you 
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address (e.g., <A HREF="http://123.45.67.89/">http://123.45.67.89/</A>)
# anyway, and this will make redirections work in a sensible way.
#
# 127.0.0.1 is the TCP/IP local loop-back address, often named localhost. Your 
# machine always knows itself by this address. If you use Apache strictly for 
# local testing and development, you may use 127.0.0.1 as the server name.
#
ServerName 127.0.0.1
