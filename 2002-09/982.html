&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; Getting desperate here, so I hope someone has "been there, done that"
&gt; and can assist.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone put together a decent way of:
&gt; a) recording video from a TV card, DV over firewire device, etc..
&gt; b) converting it to VCD format (or SVCD)
&gt; c) burning it to a CD (as a VCD/SVCD) that is playable in a DVD

I've been doing some research on this, though I don't yet have the
hardware to do any real tests.

All the pieces of the puzzle are out there. In particular, (b) and (c)
is simple, VCDimager (<A HREF="http://www.vcdimager.org/">http://www.vcdimager.org/</A>).

(a) is probably also easy - you can use the encoder portion of mplayer
(mencoder) to record from any V4L device, be it AV in or even a TV
transmission, with the appropriate card. See <A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/.">http://www.mplayerhq.hu/.</A>

Between (a) and (b) is kind of tricky. MPlayer only seems to want to
write AVI files.  Even if you tell it to use the libavcodec set of
codecs, and use the mpeg1video codec in that, you still get an AVI file.
I beleive it's MPEG-1 within that, it's simply encapsulated. But it
won't do.

However, the TOOLS subdirectory of the MPlayer distribution has some
nice scripts, one of which is called 'mencvcd'. It uses a bunch of other
tools, results in the DVD in your DVD drive becoming a standard VCD (or
SVCD if you like) in your burner.

So obviously it is possible to coax (with the application of other
tools) straight MPEG with mencoder.

I converted my Shrek DVD to VCD with the script, and through I didn't go
through and burn it, the resultant MPEG file was pretty good quality,
though I doubt I'm a good judge of these things :-)
