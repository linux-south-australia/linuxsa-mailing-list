Hi friends,

I have previously talked to you about the community project I support, 
especially about the Web Design Training I provide to unemployed young 
people.

We are working through the second course and the plan was that on 
October 30 we would launch the second web site. The first group 
completed their site, <A HREF="http://www.youthitproject.org">http://www.youthitproject.org</A> as part of their 
course.

I have just tonight received a message telling me that we will be 
required to include Style Sheets as part of the site we are presently 
building. As it is a Community related course I had not included 
anything about CSS other than mention that it is an enhancement that 
will gradually become part of the future web design scene once the 
browsers are able to provide consistent results.

Now I need to very quickly introduce CSS into the course content and 
re-plan how to design the pages to include CSS elements. 

What do I do? 
How do I bring in this CSS stuff in a very short time? 
How do I get myself up to scratch in just as short a time? 
Any hints on retrofitting CSS onto the first site?

Oh, there isn't, at this stage, any extra funding to cover any tools or 
extra training resources other than our present HomeSite 4 Editors. 
Anything we use would have to be freeware/shareware/free to non-profit 
orgs.

 Ian,
 from Adelaide, South Australia
