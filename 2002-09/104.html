Hi all,

Is anyone keeping a count of the long running 'DSL vs the Internet'
campaign?

What bothers me most about the grammer tirades (and yes, bad grammer does
make a question way harder to understand), is that there is no space given
to the poor individual involved to accomodate what may in fact be a major
disability. (Ron, I am not suggesting you are suffering from a disabilty,
only that you could be, and we wouldn't know)

When I went to Communications 101, I learnt that the core of communication
is a 2 way exchange where receivers of communication process it and then
ask verifying questions back to the other party for any part of the
communication not understood. Various things get in the way of this open
communication, and that is what has happened here.

It's a pity that a new linuxsa'er gets treated this way, and like someone
else has already mentioned, there are probably plenty of other lists that
will also critisize his grammer rather than help him with his question.

Perhaps in dealing with the question without gross critisism, we could
have had a better outcome for Rob's grammer and his linux box?

&lt;steps down from soapbox&gt;

Back to Linux!

Michael
