Icons? Did somebody say Icons?

Unfortunately I don't know much about gnome...but I can help you out if 
you were going to use KDE.

(I use icons all of the time, so my next comment is tounge and cheek, 
nothing personal.)

Just think of it this way, some people think that icons, or a "My 
Computer" folder are somewhat sinful, why not go for the full herecy and 
use KDE?
:-D  Anyway, that's what Lindows did to Debian.

Ok, back to the sireous stuff.

Icons in KDE:

Right click, create link to application.

You can copy the icons, just rename them when pasting, you will be 
asked. Change execute tab syntax and icon.

Execute tab is most important here are the contents  of some:

    Crossover Office Wine applications:

            The following opens Microsoft Excel under cxoffice 1.2:

            "/home/james/cxoffice/bin/wine" "C:/Program Files/Microsoft 
Office/Office/EXCEL.EXE" --

            (I was less experienced when I set this thing up. I probably 
should have used "$HOME/cxoffice/bin/wine" instead of 
"/home/james/cxoffice/bin/wine" so I could copy the icon to any other 
desk without having to edit the contents of the execute line.


       Linux native:

                The following opens up Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.05:

                        acroread

Shell scripts:
   
            These are easy and fun.

               Here's one:
                    The first line says, I want to use the shell. (well 
kind of..)
                    The second line is anything I would have typed in 
the shell.

                        #!/bin/bash
                        /usr/local/bin/gtaxestimator

        To make it executible, just save the text file and call it 
whatever-you-want-to-call-this-script.sh. Just right click on it, go to 
properties, and click on executible. You can copy and rename the file so 
you don't have to make it executible.

The execute line of the icon reads:

sh $HOME/guesstimate.sh

Because I saved the file in my home directory and named it guestimate.sh


Network share links in KDE:


            In my computer folder with computer like png attached:

                    Right click,  link to URL. Right click, properties. 
Rename so it doesn't say "F:\.desktop" for network share. Click on URL 
tab, click on                         folder to browse for mount point.



Hope this helps.

&gt;I need to customise a redhat 7.3 gnome desktop. Ive discovered that the
&gt;default icons of home, trash, and "starthere" are defined in
&gt;~/.gnome-desktop/home etc.. but when I delete them, nautilus (I think)
&gt;puts them straight back. If I delete the contents and take away write
&gt;access, I just get a couple of while icons that do nothing. However, It
&gt;is a requirement that I remove them. 
&gt;
&gt;I also need to show a non linux user how to make "shortcuts" to URLs and
&gt;drop them on the desktop as well. I cant see a simple way of doing this
&gt;(eg right click/"add item" or anything like that). Can someone provide a
&gt;pointer in the right direction? There must be a simple enough way! The
&gt;best I could do was tell nautilus not to handle the desktop, which
&gt;removed all the icons, but I cant put any back :( The "redhat
&gt;customization guide" doesnt even mention the desktop either.
