Nice explanation Mark.

There's more on nearly every available window manager at

P.S. I use <A HREF="http://fvwm-themes.sf.net">http://fvwm-themes.sf.net</A> myself, which has some nice
imitations of various desktops like blackbox, OSX, and WinXP to name a
few, and is both gnome & KDE compliant with xinerama for my 3 monitors.

&gt;  &gt; So why are the others so much faster?  For the first time I actually felt I
&gt;  &gt; was running a fast computer..
&gt; 
&gt; Some are better-written than others.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; It's just so damn quick - like you can see
&gt;  &gt; those GHz ticking over.  Other Window managers (MS Windows included) never
&gt;  &gt; seem to behave as though one is actually running a faster machine.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a basic architectural difference between UNIX GUIs and Microsoft
&gt; GUIs.
&gt; 
&gt; Under UNIX, the GUI is essentially an application.  You run the X server
&gt; program to start up X-windows, then you run other applications to provide
&gt; look-and-feel services, iconic interfaces, etc.  The applications all
&gt; communicate with the GUI over socket connections, so it's second nature
&gt; for an app to be running on one side of the world with all its GUI
&gt; interaction coming from the other side of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; Under MS operating systems, the GUI is part of the kernel, built-in to
&gt; the operating system.  This tends to obliterate a lot of flexibility:
&gt; Under UNIX, if you want a better, stronger, faster GUI you just run a
&gt; different "GUI application".  Under Windows, you're pretty much stuck
&gt; with whatever Uncle Bill has decided to give you.  And since the GUI is
&gt; built in to the low-level innards of the kernel, you can't communicate
&gt; it unless you also have access to the low-level innards of the kernel
&gt; (i.e., talking to it over a network is needlessly difficult).  And finally,
&gt; because the Windows GUI is in the low-level innards of the kernel,
&gt; GUI security issues expose the entire machine to vulnerabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; That said, most people don't (a) understand, or (b) use the flexibility
&gt; which UNIX windowing systems provide, so the architectural differences
&gt; don't generally mean much in the real world until you reach "turbogeek"
&gt; status.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally:  Take out your stopwatch and time how long it takes for your
&gt; applications to do various things under different desktop environments.
&gt; You'll probably find no difference at all;  You're just believing that
&gt; one is faster than the other because its response time is shorter
&gt; (that's why the Mac uses GUI tricks like "exploding windows" when
&gt; you launch an application:  By doing something to the GUI -immediately-
&gt; when you ask for an action, it provides the perception of being faster
&gt; even if it's doing something which takes a long time to happen).
&gt; 
&gt; IBM did some human-factors research back in the '70s which concluded
&gt; that users will conclude that a computer is slow if it takes more than
&gt; one third of a second to react on the screen after they've pressed a
&gt; key, regardless of how fast the computer actually is;  and, conversely,
&gt; you can make a slow computer "feel" faster by using GUI tricks like
&gt; "Please Wait" screens and hourglass cursors even if it's extremely slow.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;      startx /usr/X11R6/bin/windowmaker -- :1  (for example) will work.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Brilliant!
&gt; 
&gt; That's starting another instance of the X-Windows application and
&gt; the window manager application.
&gt; 
&gt; FWIW, you can run a second instance of GNOME by replacing the
&gt; "/usr/X11R6/bin/windowmaker" bit with, say, "/usr/X11R6/bin/gnome-session".
&gt; Or you can run another instance of whatever desktop you usually run by
&gt; replacing it with "sh $HOME/.xsession"
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Nothing extreme about two OS's running in tandem - today's desktop machines
&gt;  &gt; with a good chunk of RAM seem to be able to handle that kind of thing no
&gt;  &gt; problem.
&gt;  &gt; Will VMWare run under a basic Window Manager like IceWm or Black Box?
&gt; 
&gt; UNIX GUI-based programs don't care what window managaer is running
&gt; (there are a handful of exceptions, but you need to go to special effort
&gt; to make an application give a damn about the window manager;  usually
&gt; the WM is pretty invisible to the application developer).
&gt; 
&gt; So there's no reason why you can't run VMWare under any WM you like.
&gt; What's more, you can probably even run it with no window manager at
&gt; all :-)
&gt; 
&gt;   - mark
&gt; 

Running any windows under vmware on a linux desktop is OK for office
applications. It sucks for games though.
