Fortunately most 4WDs aren't taken off road.  If they did there would be no off
road left.  Most vans & people movers have a reason for a large vehicle.  Most
4WD owners don't have a valid reason for owning such a vehicle.  If only those
that owned them for the right reason (like Matthew) did so, they wouldn't have
such a bad reputation.

Martin.

P.S. Is there a GPS with Linux on it?



&gt;&gt; actually people do, well about Toyota and Nissan and Dunlop
&gt;&gt; (especially Grand Treks) anyway.  I'm talking about 4WDs and
&gt;&gt; that most of them come with useless tyres for offroad stuff.
&gt;&gt; If you find the right dealer they will sell you the vehicle
&gt;&gt; with your choice of tyres on it.

&gt;On a side note, how many people actually take theor 4WD offroad?  It's
&gt;the same with PCs.  There's a small few of us who use our PCs for more
&gt;than email, writing letters and web browsing.  It makes sense for
&gt;Toshiba to bundle Windows to suit the uneducated (about Linux) masses;
&gt;it's installed, it works and Toshiba doesn't have to worry about tech
&gt;support calls "I'm installing SomeOS (TM) and hardware X isn't
&gt;supported, what can I do?"

Depends on what you do for a living and if you explore Australia in liu of
heading overseas.  My Hilux in its 150,000kms of travel has spend
100,000kms of that off road ie not on the bitumen and I am only on my
second pair of tyres ;-) ...

I totally agree that a vast majority of 4WD's never make it off the
bitumen.   If you think that 4WD's block the view then take a long hard
look at the "workman's" vans (eg Mitsubishi l300) and the Mercedes Benz
A-&gt;B carry vehicles, they even block the view of the "big and nasty" 4WD's
!

Then again my Toshiba laptop sports RH7.3 so maybe by these too analogies
that makes me weird ?
