I think that there's the standard list of reasons that are offered to most
commercial companies. The documentation on Linux and BSD advocacy are
probably a good place to check for things you may have missed.

Here's a couple of thoughts that have come from my own personal experience:

Most gov. depts. tend to spend a huge amount on IT - a significant amount of
that would be on software licensing. IT departments are having funding cut
(like everyone else), but instead of trying to save money on software
ransom^H^H^H^H^H^Hlicensing, these departments are forced to "save" money
elsewhere. This includes less support staff and extending the life of
hardware (even in mission-critical applications in hospitals). (Note: I'm not
saying hardware should be upgraded every week, just that it should work).

For those that absolutely, positively have to run some flavour of Windows
application, for the cost of a beefy Windows 2000 server and a number of
Terminal Services Client Access Licenses, rdesktop (<A HREF="http://www.rdesktop.org/">http://www.rdesktop.org/</A>)
is a godsend. It's a lot easier to manage a set number of TS CALs than it is
to manage a bunch of OEM, upgrade, client and application licenses across a
1500+ user network.

It's probably also worth mentioning that there's no real need for someone to
pull The Big Switch and all will be free. It's a migration, so you start of
testing and trialling, then migrate some of your less critical applications /
departments and then one day you let your software vendors know that you
won't be requiring the software licenses or support contracts you've had in
the past :-).

Hope it helps,
Matt
