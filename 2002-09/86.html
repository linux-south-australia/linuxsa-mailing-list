Hi - This is my understanding from a biological perspective.

Electromagnetic radiation is a spectrum from 
harmless radio waves to very high energy gamma rays.

radio/ TV waves have a low frequency (KHz-GHz) & long waves (metres),
microwaves (1mm to 30cm), 
infrared (1-100 microns),
visible light (~700-400nm) visible to humans,
UV light (400-200nm, several eV), divided into UV-A, UV-B & UV-C
	UV-C is blocked by the ozone, 
	UV-B partly blocked but causes sun burn & skin cancer & cataracts,
	UV-A causes wrinkles, ruins outdoor paint & plastics, insects can see
UV-A,
X-rays (10^16 Hz to 10^20Hz) (100eV to 100,000eV).
Gamma-rays (10^18.5 Hz to 10^27 Hz, Energy &gt;100keV) produced by 
	radioactive atoms, & explosions. Used for radio-therapy. 


Radiation is divided into non-ionising radiation (radio to visible) and
ionising radiation (UV to gamma rays).  The latter refering to unstable atoms
that give off excess energy or mass.  Radiation is only a problem when it is
slowed down enough to loose some of it's energy in the wrong place.  That is if
radiation passes through you and continues on it's way you will not be
effected.  If for example, you stop UV radiation with the DNA in your skin the
energy from the UV will cause a change at a molecular level.  If an X-ray is
stopped by the metal lid of your laptop or case of your hard-drive, it merely
produces a shadow for the airport security person to see what's in your bag.
If the X-ray released some of it's energy on some magnetic tape, what ever the
result of 100eV+ of photons applied to your tape would result. If the X-ray
slows down after passing through your storage material or photographic film no
harm is done.  The question to ask is which parts of your belongings are going
to slow down the X-ray and cop some of it's energy and is that energy enough to
cause a problem.  Probability comes into the equation.  
X-rays are used because they are energetic enough to enter your bag, but not so
energetic they pass straight through all of your bags contents.  The darkest
part of an x-ray are the shadows of the densest objects, like bones and
internal organs.  


Small amounts of ionising radiation are emitted from smoke detectors & the
string mantles you place into your gas lamp while camping.  The amount of
radiation falls off with the square root of distance.  So the best way to
minimise exposure is to move further away from the source.

A long haul flight in the day is the equivalent of a chest X-ray in terms of
exposure.  Newer X-ray machines in hospitals, however, give much lower doses
than the older models.  I suspect the different ages of the airport security
x-ray machines similarly will vary in the x-ray doses emitted.  X-rays are
stopped with lead or with water in the case of nuclear reactor gamma rays.

Forgive me for any repetition.

Subject: X-ray machines and high-tech hardware


Hi all,

I'm about to embark on a bit of a trek, taking with me my laptop and an
external harddrive. (ok, and some clothes, a camera, a few passports, and so
on ;)

Anyway, along the way I think i'll be asked to put my gear thru X-ray machines
in airports numerous times. Probably 4 times just on the way over.

Does anyone have solid evidence about what this does to your hardware?

The harddrive says on it that it'll withstand up to 350 G of shock, so it'll
probably survive if the planes crash - but it doesn't mention anything about
EMR. How about the controller board on it, or the laptop plasma display,
etc..?


Thanks,

Toby
