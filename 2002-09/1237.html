&gt;&gt; The question should have been "Did FreeBSD hurt BSD/OS?", and the

&gt;
&gt; In fact it's not even that simple.  I think BSD/OS was hurt for much
&gt; the same reasons as all of the proprietary unixes are hurting.  It is
&gt; hard to sell something that other's are giving away, by which I do
&gt; mean that the free unixes are the same as the ones you have to pay for.
&gt; That's been my contention (and your's, I believe) all along.

Yes.  That's what I said:

&gt; The real problem is that it's difficult to sell software when
&gt; somebody is giving away something which is effectively the same.

&gt;&gt; BSD[Ii]'s leading technical people have very little to do with
&gt;&gt; FreeBSD's people, though it's true that, for about a year, some
&gt;&gt; FreeBSD people worked for Wind River Systems after they bought the
&gt;&gt; software assets of BSDi.
&gt;
&gt; Other than that the chief architect at BSDi was also one of the leading
&gt; (maybe chief?) architect of FreeBSD, and long before Wind River came into
&gt; that picture.  No?

No.

The chief architect of BSD/OS was (probably still is) Mike Karels.
The chief architect of the FreeBSD project used to be David Greenman,
but he gave up the post some years ago, and it has never been
replaced.  Mike Karels has never worked on FreeBSD, and AFAIK David
has never worked on BSD/OS.
