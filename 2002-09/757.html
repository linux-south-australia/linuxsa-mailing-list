I have had a look at Lycoris...

I can't confirm that you have the most recent version of it however.

I received a cd from them when they were called Redmond Linux...they 
sent me another cd later, clearly labled Lycoris, but the installer was 
still showing Redmond Linux.

Ok, so what was my opinion being a relatively new user?

Well, I don't like how the distribution is watered down.

There was a guy named Torben Lange that wanted to set up the Netware 
Client for Linux in Lycoris and wrote me for help. We finally came to 
the conclusion that we could not install Mars-nwe because the following 
dependencies were missing:

/sbin/chkconfig
/sbin/service

It looked like we couldn't install certain packages because of the way 
the distribution was made.

I didn't use it much besides that because it wasn't flexible enough for me.

&gt;Ive heard good things about it, so I thought i'd take a look. I
&gt;downloaded it from the telstra game arena mirror, but I think it might
&gt;be an old version. The installer says "redmond linux", was copyright
&gt;2000-2001 and was buggy and old looking (crashed it 3 times). The
&gt;desktop once installed looks like the one on the web page though. Can
&gt;someone confirm or deny I've got the current version here?
