Martin et al,

&gt; &gt; I'd suggest using ssh, because you can configure it so that it doesn't
&gt; &gt; require a password, and can only be used to copy receive the file.  You do
&gt; &gt; that by creating a public/private key pair, which stands in place of a
&gt; &gt; password, and setting th receiving machine so that it only permits you to
&gt; &gt; save to the one file.

Assuming that you are copying from M1 to M2:

a) to create a trust relationship between M1 and M2  based on the
public/private keys for all accounts that exist on M2
 - I suspect it's not this option

b) to create a backup account on M2
 - and then somehow restrict the backup account to copying only to
certain files

I don't think that one can use SSH and not obtain some type of
permission(s)/account on M2 (even though you may not be allowed to use
the shell). Therefore, Martin [who I thik is the one who asked this
question in the first place] needs to make sure his file permissions and
settings on M2 are set according to his security policies.

Having perused the man pages for the SSH daemon (man sshd) and scp (man
scp) they don't have an option which restricts what files one can copy
to. Or to put it another way, once the public/private key identification
is setup, I don't think that SSH itself will stop you from writing to
any part of the filesystem the backup user can write to.

Piece of advice to Martin: do create a backup user, and don't create a
password-less public/private key for root :-)
