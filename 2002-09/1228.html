I think the replies to this thread have been well thought out and
eloquently delivered. I certainly take heart from the responses of the
AUUG people and I suppose only time will tell if indeed they do a good
job.

Richard's reply is spot on and I believe that open standards are the
most important part of any government purchase program. I suppose my
comments about government funding came from the adoption of Linux/OSS by
other countries, The German government in particular, is exploring the
idea of shared public utilities whereby each government department, 
regardless of role, can pool developed software for anyone to contribute
to. This is 'government funded and developed'. Here in Australia if OSS
does take hold in no one can be in any doubt that a great deal of
development will be funded, and I'm not talking about buckets of money.
I'm talking about $20000 here and $50000 there for add-ons patches,
improvements. God forbid we go back to paying millions to private
companies whose sole intention is tier-locking us in.

Add this up across the country and we may well find that the government
is inadvertently funding ground breaking work.  Work, I might add, that
I would like GPL'd. And this might be where the sticking point is?

I understand where Gregg and David N are coming from and agree we must
not get into a war over this, but like it or not, OSS is making inroads
into public minds and government run departments. I have a preference
for GPL licensing (like many others) and am wondering if AUUG would
prefer it to stay well tucked up in the background.

Gregg is correct in saying that Apache and Samba are key drivers in the 
adoption of OSS, but I do think it is also a bit of a red herring. Linux
(GNU/Linux) under a GPL license was really what made me take take notice
of alternatives. I'm not sure why people use Linux but for me personally
Linux and GPL go hand in hand.

Without the GPL license would Linux/OSS be in the position we are now?
Would Apache and Samba, the key utils, be little more than a shadow of
what they are now without Linux? IMHO Apache and Samba followed the
driving force of Linux. Apache and Samba are great partners but should
not be held up in front of Linux as if they were responsible for where
we are now. That is IMO a disservice.

So, Linux people, care to tell the list what attracts you to Linux?

Thnx for all the good rebuffs to my original post, makes me feel good
and part of a healthy debating community.
