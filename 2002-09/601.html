Here are some facts which might stop a certain amount of thrashing[1] on
this topic.

I've got a problem, maybe, with some other companies behaving in
intriguing ways (see tomorrow night's presentation for details:), but it
might be relevant to people on this list bothered about mandatory Windows
inclusion with a laptop.

I just spoke to a Leo in the ACCC on 1300 302 502, who said that if a
third party is insisting on bundled products from different manufacturers
it is illegal and the case would normally be very clear. He recommended I
search the ACCC web site for "third line forcing", which is the technical
term for this prohibited behaviour. Incidentally I was astonished to have
the phone answered on the first ring by someone who provided all the info
I needed in about 30 seconds. 10 points to the ACCC for public service.

I found the following links that people might find helpful:

	"Third line forcing is the term used when a business sells goods
or services on the condition that the customer also buys other goods or
services from another business (which may be a related company). An
example is the sale of internet access on condition that the consumer
obtains a credit card from a specific financial institution. The offer of
access relies on the purchase of a product from another particular
business. However, it would not be third line forcing to require customers
to pay by credit card generally as there are numerous institutions which
provide credit cards and consumers are free to make their own choice. It
is also not third line forcing where all the goods or services in question
are being sold by the one company. Similarly, it is not third line forcing
where all the goods or services in question are being sold by an agent for
the one company. (Note that although such arrangements are not third line
forcing, they may need to be checked against the other prohibitions on
restrictive practices, particularly if the businesses involved are major
players in the market.)"

Quote:

	"The Commission is more likely to be concerned when purchasers of
product A are forced by the supplier to also purchase product B from
another supplier. Such purchasers are denied the opportunity to choose, on
the normal commercial basis of product quality and price, whether or not
to purchase product B. In particular, competition and consumer welfare are
normally likely to suffer when purchasers of product A are forced to
purchase product B from a nominated supplier. Although the Commission does
not pursue all third line forcing conduct of which it becomes aware,
persons engaging in such conduct would remain at risk of court action from
other parties unless immunity is obtained under the Act.s notification or
authorisation processes. Authorisation or notification immunity from court
action for third line forcing conduct will be obtained, and retained, only
if the conduct is likely to result in net public benefit ... The
Commission considers each authorisation application and notification on
its own merits. However, it has accepted that third line forcing conduct
can result in such benefits to the public."

[1] Thrashing is a term used for an OS having virtual memory management
problems, where no sooner does it swap something into main memory than it
swaps it out again, resulting in little useful work being done. Try
rigging your Unix system to provoke this behaviour - you'll learn about
tuning heavily loaded system.
