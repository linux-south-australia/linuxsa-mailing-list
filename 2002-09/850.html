&gt; I'm sure there's ways to tame SMIT, but ... no thanks, not on my Linux

Unfortunately (for me), my brain is finite, and I find that if I've
been playing with, say, HP-UX for too long, my AIX skills (and others)
rust.  This then has me running half the commands from the command line,
and the other half from SMIT (or whatever the ratio is as my brain pages
that stuff back into working storage).  Mind you, IBM have been pretty
orthogonal in their command naming; lsvg, lslv etc. to list volume
groups/ logical volumes, ch* to change 'em, rm* to delete 'em.  And
I still prefer their volume management stuff over Veritas.

As I was discussing with a colleague the other day, I think the greatest
feature that IBM put into SMIT was the ability to see the commands that
it executes to accomplish any given task (HP-UX's sam utility does the
same thing, but you have to dredge the log file; SMIT has a "how-the-
heck-did-you-do-that?" option).  The second greatest, as Dean mentioned,
is that on the X version when a command fails, the "Running Man" in the
top right corner falls over and expires.  :-)
