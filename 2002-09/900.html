Andy,

&gt; When as a user I run poweroff, halt or reboot, I immediately get back the

&lt;quote who="awol"&gt;
If you do "which poweroff" or "which halt" or "which reboot" you will
see these commands reside in /sbin which is a system binary directory.
In other words all system commands should be run as root NOT as a user.

The consolehelper app will segfault because it's a wrapper script only
intended to be run from within an X environment where it calls a simple
little tk box and asks for the root passwd so it can then run those and
other commands as root.
&lt;/quote&gt;

Whilst it is true all these commands reside in the /sbin directory, a
directory reserved for executables that operate on the system and should
only be accessible to the super user or administrators, RedHat have
setup the command-line tool "consolehelper" to allow access to other
users.

Files or directories that this tool use include:

/etc/security/console.perms
/etc/security/console.apps*

To enable console access to other applications (according to the RedHat
7.1 Official RedHat Linux Guide) you do the following steps:

1) Create a link from the name of your application to the
/usr/bin/consolehelper application
2) Create the file /etc/security/console.apps/foo
4) Create a PAM config file for the foo service in /etc/pam.d/

I suspect, but I'm not sure, that "hatl", "poweroff" and "shutdown" may
be setuid root. RedHat aren't noted for being secure.

Now, after this ramble, I conclude the following:

* consolehelper is a wrapper script
* consolehelper can be run from any environment because it's a pam
module and configured by pam
* consolehelper is segfaulting because it's not being called properly at
all -- probably because it expects to find that it's been called via
symlink, then looks for something in /etc/pam.d. Alternatively, it could
be attempting to recursively call itself ad infinitum which would
eventually cause a segmentation fault.
