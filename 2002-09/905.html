Denise,
I think you're a little mistaken regarding the history of Camtech, 
however I don't disagree with your actual point.

FYI:
Camtech (SA) Pty Ltd was setup by the Computer Science Dept of Adelaide 
University.  It was soley owned by Luminis - an investment arm of the 
University of Adelaide.  Camtech was never owned by Flinders or UNISA. 
Camtech arose from the Apple Shop and Sun Shop at the CS Dept.

I worked for Camtech for 7 years from almost the begining (1994) to the 
effective end (2001).  I pretty much saw it all as I was at the CS Dept 
prior to that.

Camtech's main issue was that the University wasn't a good and forward 
looking investor in the IT field.  They probably should have sold it 
earlier when management tried to buy it out in '96 (I think - could have 
been '95).

&gt;This is not really quite fair on universities. In my experience
&gt;their infotech people are usually very capable. However they have
&gt;to deal with stupid, short sighted management. 
&gt;The three universities set up Camtech as a research unit and ISP,
&gt;but economic fundamentalism stepped in and the whole thing was
&gt;privatised. No wonder expertise disappears!
