Subject: [Xbox-linux] SuSE 8 on the Xbox
Date: 12 Sep 1990 15:01:01 +0200

Hello everyone!

Standard Linux distributions *do* work on the Xbox, with minimal 
modifications. I am writing this email in KMail on... MY XBOX!
No, not in X-Window, not on TV. I'm acessing KDE using X forwarding. But SuSE 
Linux has been booted from the Xbox hard disk, and it's running KDE.

How did I do it?
I put my 10 GB Xbox hard disk into a standard PC (Duron 700, VIA KT-133, 
usb-uhci, Riva128, Sound Blaster PCI) using the hot-swap method and booted 
the SuSE 8 installation CD. The Xbox hard disk is unused from track 15534 on, 
so I created a 128 MB swap partition /dev/hda1 starting at track 15534, and a 
1.7 GB root partition /dev/hda2 in ReiserFS format. I could safely create a 
PC-like partition table, because the first sector of the Xbox hard disk is 
unused.
Then I did a standard installation ("with Office"). When the installation 
program wanted to reboot, I had to re-unlock the HD by doing the hot-swap 
trick again. I configured the network card (an Intel EtherExpress Pro) to 
match my local network.
Then I put the hard disk back into the Xbox and copied and booted Linux with 
the new command-line-aware XBE bootloader, the standard SuSE kernel with 
pci.c exchanged (no further changes) and the standard SuSE initrd that loads 
reiserfs.o and continues booting from hard disk. The kernel command line is 
of course "root=/dev/hda2".
SuSE booted, the network of course did not come up (wrong driver), the sound 
settings generated a "failed" by the init script, and the init script 
/etc/rc.d/hwscan crashed the machine (is it because of the PCI bug?). So I 
connected the Xbox hard disk to the PC again, booted the installation on the 
PC, disabled hwscan, installed the SuSE 8 RPM for nForce (nvnet.o etc.) and 
changed /etc/modules.conf: I disabled the PC network and autio settings and 
enabled the four lines for the nForce chipset that are already in that file 
(but disabled). Additionally, I set the standard runlevel in /etc/inittab to 
3, so that X did not start.
When I booted SuSE on the Xbox again, I saw the login prompt, and the Xbox 
could be pinged. I ssh'ed into the Xbox, did
export DISPLAY=192.168.0.1:0
startkde
after starting an "empty" X Server on the Linux PC (running Mandrake 8.2) and 
doing "xhost +xbox", and voila, KDE was running on the Xbox. Because I had 
set up the name server and the standard gateway correctly during the 
installation already, the Xbox was immediately ready for the Internet.

Speed
The speed is somewhere between okay and excellent. Of course there is no X 
Server running on the Xbox at the moment, so this saves quite some RAM. But 
I'm in a full KDE envorinment and even StarOffice is running in the 
background.

Why SuSE?
I only had the current versions of Mandrake and SuSE here, and I don't have a 
broadband internet connection, so that I could download any other 
distributions. I tried Mandrake first, starting with root mounted as NFS, and 
with its own partition later. Too bad Mandrake is very pedantic about module 
versions, and there's something wrong with the compiler, so I was unable to 
run a kernel based on the Mandrake-patched 2.4.18 sources that loads nvnet.o. 
And without a Mandrake kernel, the kernel modules on hard disk would not 
load. So I tried SuSE, which made a lot less problems. If there are any 
Mandrake experts out there, I would still like to try Mandrake, too!

USB? X?
USB does not work because of an interrupt conflict with the non-existant 
keyboard controller. Milosch has fixed this bug in this bug already by 
replacing the standard keyboard driver with a dummy keyboard driver, but I 
tried to use a kernel with as few modifications as possible, to be as 
compatible to the original SuSE kernel as possible. I'll try that next.
When trying to start X Window, the Xbox crashes. X Window is still configured 
for my Riva128 in the PC. The X Server probably writes somewhere into the 64 
MB framebuffer of the Riva card, overwriting system memory. I'll try 
replacing the X config file to match the framebuffer settings.

What's next?
I'd like to see Windows 95 in VMware now. ;-)

  Michael
