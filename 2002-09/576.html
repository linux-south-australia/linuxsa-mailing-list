Although I lament Toshiba's stated position, I can't really find legal
fault.  They have offered a full refund, but not for the software alone.
They say that they are selling a product comprised of both hardware
and software, and that they can't (or won't) sell their product in
separate parts.  That's surely their right.

I suppose you could liken it to saying that you want to buy the product
sans keyboard, and in which case probably they would sell you, not a
single product (laptop without keyboard), but a bunch of spare parts:
battery, case, power supply, screen, and so on.  That may well be the
crunch: You certainly can buy spare parts sufficient to assemle a Toshiba
laptop without Windows, but I bet it would cost a signifcant amount more
than a new laptop (including Windows.)
