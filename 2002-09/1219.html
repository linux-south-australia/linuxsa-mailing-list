&gt;
&gt; I have to wonder though, is AUUG, the most appropriate body to be
&gt; representing a combination a OS software when negotiating with the
&gt; government. Take Greg's mail below for instance. The thrust of the
&gt; article was Linux based, and more than likely the Linux phenomenon is
&gt; making waves in all government departments and hence rational thinking
&gt; people will evaluate its effectiveness for their needs.

Well, "Linux" is the word that people know.  If you look at what is
actually being used out there, the big hits are more likely to be
Samba and Apache.

&gt; Yet at the end Greg clearly indicates that his push is for BSD and
&gt; making it an attractive option for filling government roles, which I
&gt; must say is great in itself, but will AUUG, work for The "Australian
&gt; Unix Users Group" commercial Unix's included, to the detriment of
&gt; Linux.

*sigh* Doubtless you're talking about this:

&gt;&gt;   The National Office of the Information Economy plans to organise a
&gt;&gt;   briefing on the use of Linux at the enterprise level for chief
&gt;&gt;   information officers and chief technology officers in the public
&gt;&gt;   sector.

This is in fact a misquotation.  The NOIE is looking at open source
software, not Linux.  The reporter presumably didn't know the
difference.

&gt;&gt; Gordon and I met Steve Alford in Melbourne earlier this month.  He
&gt;&gt; made a much better impression on us than we expected, and we realise
&gt;&gt; that we still need to find our feet in this material.  If anybody has
&gt;&gt; interesting opinions or ideas, we'd welcome them.  Note that we're
&gt;&gt; talking about solid business reasons why the Government should use
&gt;&gt; BSD, not ideological ones.

That was supposed to be a teaser, my reply to the misquote above.  I
didn't expect anybody to take it seriously.  Yes, of course we want
BSD as well.  But if you want to see what we're really talking about,
take a look at our press releases, in this case
<A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au/publications/press/callToAuGov2002.html.">http://www.auug.org.au/publications/press/callToAuGov2002.html.</A>
That's what we're really doing in public.  Yes, we're not only
advocating Linux.  We're also not only advocating BSD.  Without Samba
and Apache, they would only be half as much use.

&gt; Will Linux, considering it is Linux that has turned the world on its
&gt; head get fair representation from AUUG?

Yes and no.  No, it's not because it has turned the world on its head.
Microsoft has done that too.  It's because it's part of AUUG's
charter.  And for that reason, yes, Linux will get fair
representation.

&gt; Lastly, my reason for this post comes from my attendance at the AUUG
&gt; security symposium last year. It was quite apparent from vendors and
&gt; AUUG attendees, that Linux was seen as tolerable, but in many
&gt; aspects not what was wanted. They would much rather have seen one of
&gt; the BSD going great guns, rather than Linux.

I suppose that depends on who you talk to.  If you want to see more
Linux representation at AUUG conferences, there's a simple way to
achieve it: attend.  In fact, we're rather disappointed that we don't
see more Linux people there.

&gt; And do I really want BSD being funded for improvement by government
&gt; departments,(public money) so that corporations can take the best
&gt; bits and make them propriety?

I don't want to get into a licensing debate, but I don't see this
happening.  The corporations that want the best bits of BSD already
have them.  That's not the government.

&gt; Have Linux groups dropped the ball on this, should we have
&gt; Incorporated across the country?

I don't think so.

One of the lessons we *should* have learnt from UNIX history is that
there was too much parochialism, too much attention to territorial
interests.  It harmed UNIX greatly, and if it continues, it will harm
open source UNIX projects.  If we want to make a real impression on
the Real World, we need to do it together, not appear to them like a
lot of warring factions.  We're happy enough that we have managed to
get the attention of the NOIE as it is.
