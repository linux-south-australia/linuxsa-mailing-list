Hi.

&gt; Michael,

&gt; &gt; Is anyone keeping a count of the long running 'DSL vs the Internet'
&gt; &gt; campaign?
&gt; 
&gt; Now you portray me as being against the Internet? Define what you mean
&gt; and provide supporting evidence.

Not really, it just seems that way. Read the archives for circumstantial
evidence. :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What bothers me most about the grammer tirades (and yes, bad grammer does
&gt; &gt; make a question way harder to understand), is that there is no space given
&gt; &gt; to the poor individual involved to accomodate what may in fact be a major
&gt; &gt; disability. (Ron, I am not suggesting you are suffering from a disabilty,
&gt; &gt; only that you could be, and we wouldn't know)
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly true.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; When I went to Communications 101, I learnt that the core of communication
&gt; &gt; is a 2 way exchange where receivers of communication process it and then
&gt; &gt; ask verifying questions back to the other party for any part of the
&gt; &gt; communication not understood.
&gt; 
&gt; Have you actually read the original message that started this off? 

Yes. Communication should be cordial to work effectively. Verifying
questions framed as thinly veiled insults are known not to work except for
the thickest skinned individuals.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Various things get in the way of this open
&gt; &gt; communication, and that is what has happened here.
&gt; 
&gt; Own that. It's your opinion, not mine.

It came from me, it is an opinion, and I'm sure many would share it. I am
quite happy to own it. Under the circumstances, your not sharing it is a
given.

&gt;  
&gt; &gt; It's a pity that a new linuxsa'er gets treated this way, and like someone
&gt; &gt; else has already mentioned, there are probably plenty of other lists that
&gt; &gt; will also critisize his grammer rather than help him with his question.
&gt; 
&gt; And sometimes he'll find people who will criticise grammar and point out
&gt; the answer, or many answers, to his question.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Perhaps in dealing with the question without gross critisism, we could
&gt; &gt; have had a better outcome for Rob's grammer and his linux box?
&gt; 
&gt; If you are so certain then why have you asked that as a question and
&gt; started with "perhaps"?
&gt; 
Because I am not presuming that everyone shares my opinion, I am
suggesting that I have a proposition that is worth considering. The
"perhaps" might lead the reader to weigh the proposition in their mind and
decide if they agree with it. 

&gt; &gt; &lt;steps down from soapbox&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; :-)
&gt; 

---For linux content :) -----

Is anyone running an Asus A7V333, and how is it with Linux? I am thinking
of one for my home workstation with a suitably fast AthlonXP


regards,

Michael
