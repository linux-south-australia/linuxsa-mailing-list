&gt; &gt; &gt; It is also not third line forcing where all the goods or services in question
&gt; &gt; &gt; are being sold by the one company.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I would think that this line is applicable in this case.
&gt; &gt; Toshiba is sourcing Windows from MS, and onselling it as part of its
&gt; &gt; package, it is _not_ forcing you to buy it from microsoft.
&gt; 
&gt; You are being sold a licence in this instance.
&gt; 
&gt; The licence is not valid until you have agreed to the Eula, so the sale
&gt; may not be considered complete until you do so. As such, you have
&gt; 'bought' the laptop, but not the OS until you agree to it. This is what
&gt; third line forcing is all about.
&gt; 
&gt; If you had 'bought' the OS, then you'd be entitled to resell it. MS
&gt; would like to tell you that this isn't the case, but they can't have it
&gt; both ways.

the thing is you are not buying the OS from MS. toshiba is acting as a
reseller and is packaging the laptop hardware with a MS OS.

third line forcing would be toshiba only selling you a laptop if you showed
them a valid licence purchased seperately for a MS OS (and not any other
companies OS).
