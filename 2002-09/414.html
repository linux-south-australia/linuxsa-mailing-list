thanks Romana,

it seems to have done the trick..
strange how it looks in there (~/.mozilla dir)
I tried previously moving it to /any/ netscape/plugin dir I could find 
~/.netscape/plugins
~/.netscape6/plugins
/usr/local/netscape/plugins

now to go find them again and remove them!
:)

cheers

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;anyone had any luck with these two working together?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;ns7 crashes every time I hit a page with flash on it, I have the plugin
&gt;&gt;installed (flash 5.0 r48) but it doesnt help. I have also tried running
&gt;&gt;the browser logged in as root or the usual user I work as, with no
&gt;&gt;difference.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;www.news.com.au and australianit.com.au are good examples.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am using gentoo 1.2 but installed the ns7 release from the netscape
&gt;&gt;installer (as opposed to the ports system as it only has v4.79!?!)
&gt;&gt;dont think its relevant but its also using the sun-jdk 1.4.01 installed
&gt;&gt;(using their java plugin and the acrobat 405 plugin) this is on kde
&gt;&gt;3.0.3 desktop
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;the only way back once its crashed is 'killall netscape-bin'
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;opera used to be fine using the same plugin, but now I have updated to
&gt;&gt;the full release of ns7 it has the same issue.. I cant find any logs or
&gt;&gt;output. it just locks.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;this is very 'kin frustrating as I am trying to convince the office that
&gt;&gt;we should move away from m$ but I have to avoid any site with flash when
&gt;&gt;browsing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;if anyone has any suggestions or stories of a
&gt;&gt;nicely-behaving-itself-netscape please let me know (it might keep me
&gt;&gt;motivated)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;cheers
