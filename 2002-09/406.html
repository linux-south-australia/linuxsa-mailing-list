anyone had any luck with these two working together?

ns7 crashes every time I hit a page with flash on it, I have the plugin 
installed (flash 5.0 r48) but it doesnt help. I have also tried running 
the browser logged in as root or the usual user I work as, with no 
difference.

www.news.com.au and australianit.com.au are good examples.

I am using gentoo 1.2 but installed the ns7 release from the netscape 
installer (as opposed to the ports system as it only has v4.79!?!)
dont think its relevant but its also using the sun-jdk 1.4.01 installed 
(using their java plugin and the acrobat 405 plugin) this is on kde 
3.0.3 desktop

the only way back once its crashed is 'killall netscape-bin'

opera used to be fine using the same plugin, but now I have updated to 
the full release of ns7 it has the same issue.. I cant find any logs or 
output. it just locks.

this is very 'kin frustrating as I am trying to convince the office that 
we should move away from m$ but I have to avoid any site with flash when 
browsing.

if anyone has any suggestions or stories of a 
nicely-behaving-itself-netscape please let me know (it might keep me 
motivated)

cheers
