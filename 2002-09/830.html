&gt; I am receiving a LOT of conflicting views on wireless NIC's - I have found

&gt; PCI wireless cards.
&gt;
&gt; What IS the difference?

The margins.  They probably make more money on them.

I know of two issues with wireless cards;

1.  The power rating.  They do vary, but there's no reason to believe
    it's a function of the price.  Unfortunately, I don't have any
    further details here.
2.  The chipset, and thus whether there is driver support for them.
    I'm personally very happy with the Lucent/Orinoco/whatever they're
    called this week cards.  About a year ago, AUUG did a mass
    purchase of these cards, which we sold for $140.  Since then the
    prices have dropped considerably.

It would be nice to find one of these cards and try them out.  If
they're supported, they could be a big hit at the Installfest.
