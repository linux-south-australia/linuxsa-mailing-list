&gt; Hi list,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a P2-450 with 128mb ram running RH7.3. 
&gt; 
&gt; Every morning I find that there is a process called logrotate that is hogging 
&gt; 35MB or more of ram and using a high percentage of the CPU load. From the 
&gt; name I can guess what it is supposed to be doing but does it really need that 
&gt; much ram and CPU time to swap a few files around? Is this a bug or does this 
&gt; process really use that much?
&gt; 
&gt; Because it is using a good percentage of my system ram, it makes everything 
&gt; else run really slow as the system needs to swap things in and out of disk. I 
&gt; can kill the process off (which I don't really like doing but is the only way 
&gt; to get a usable system) and everything comes good but soon after, another 
&gt; process called updatedb starts. this uses alot of IO time on the disk and 
&gt; also slows things down. is it safe stop updatedb from running and if so, how?


We've seen this.  Basically if logrotate has to rotate tens
of thousands of files it slows to a crawl and becomes a resource
hog.

Try

   find /var/log -name '*.[0-9]' -print

to see if this has happened.

The bug is usually in the configuration files.  For example
if /etc/logrotate.d/example it says

   /var/log/example/* {  ... }

then logrotate tries to rotate the example.log file and the
already-rotated files example.log.1 and so on.  The result
is thousands of log files over time.

The correct regular expression

   /var/log/example/*.log { ... }

fixes this problem

To clean up the mess you probably need to delete all the
multiply-rotated files.
