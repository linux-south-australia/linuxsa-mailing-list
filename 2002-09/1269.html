Hi David,

I'll try the killall5 and see what happens, I don't have telnet server or 
any of the other methods of getting into the box activated, so it rules all 
of those other idea's out.



Thanks

Wayne

&gt;Wayne,

&gt; &gt; I screwed up the configuration on my linux box for a commercial application
&gt; &gt; that I have been running successfully for about  3 years.
&gt;
&gt;Sounds like some good uptime there :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; When I created
&gt; &gt; the error I just left the application running, didn't think it would create
&gt; &gt; any problems other than just no work, so I left it.
&gt;
&gt;In the future become a cynic!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Trying to execute anoything results in the message 'Resouce temporarily
&gt; &gt; unavailable'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anything that I try to do, I end up getting the same message.
&gt;
&gt;Try using something less light-weight than SSH. This might sound like
&gt;strange advice, but if you've got resource problems then telnet or rsh
&gt;might be light weight enough to get through to the system. Only attempt
&gt;to use telnet (if it's running at all) as a last resort...
&gt;
&gt;How are you logging into it?
&gt;
&gt;You could use killall5:
&gt;
&gt;NAME
&gt;        killall5 -- send a signal to all processes.
&gt;
&gt;SYNOPSIS
&gt;        killall5 -signalnumber
&gt;
&gt;...eg:
&gt;
&gt;# killall5 -TERM
&gt;
&gt;...HOWEVER this would also lose your network connection.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I am about 150 km's away from where this box is located so pressing the
&gt; &gt; reset button is a little difficult at the moment.
&gt;
&gt;For you, but is there anyone *at all* whom you would trust to:
&gt;
&gt;a) know the root password
&gt;b) understand what you're talking about if you have to walk them through
&gt;an fsck at the start
&gt;c) execute the commands on the console
&gt;
&gt; &gt; How should I try to reboot it, or alternatively free up some memory so I
&gt; &gt; can shutdown the offending program ?
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure whether there's much you can do in your situation; it
&gt;sounds like the type of nightmare where you have to have hands on the
&gt;console.
&gt;
&gt;
