&gt; With the number of apache machines outweighing the number of IIS boxes atached to the net, there could be a real problem.

This worm has a flaw that prevents it from becoming a big nuisance like
Nimda and code red. Most of the infection happened on Saturday morning,
and if it was going to get you, you'd probably already have it.

The worm creates a new instance of itself when it infects a system.
Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop future attacks by the same worm.
The result is that approximately an hour after the first infection there
are several thousand worm processes running, mostly as zombies. This
makes the server unusable, and the worm ceases to be effective. It makes
for a nice decay-series graph of traffic.

The udp port 2002 traffic can be a little overwhelming for some servers,
one I've seen made a 64K link unusable. I think this is infected hosts
attempting to report back to the host that infected them.

OpenSSL 0.96e contains the fix, so 0.9.6g is not absolutely necessary.
I'm told that Redhat openssl-0.9.6b-28 has a backported version of the
patch for the problem.
