Pete, David et al,

I have stated to the PTB that the students will be having nothing to do
with XML, XSL or Xtra crap that they might think of inserting into the
course. It is them that created the problem, up to them to resolve it. NMP!

I have agreed to, and already started on, introducing CSS into the course
and I have made a committment that the final site will be running off a CSS
page and fully validate.

So we now dig deep and get a grip on CSS and how to use it. I am looking
forward to getting stuck into this aspect. It is a poor course when the
learning is restricted to only the students &lt;G&gt;

Many thanks for the help. Cheers,  Ian

&gt; &gt; Ian,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Whoa! Just got more information. It isn't CSS they want to
&gt; &gt; &gt; integrate, it is XML and XSL stylesheets.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why would basic web-page students need to understand XSL stylesheets?
&gt; &gt; An understanding of XMl could be justified, but XSL?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know nothing about these other than they are way ahead of what I
&gt; &gt; &gt; could expect to be teaching to young unemployed in a short term
&gt; &gt; &gt; community project.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Comments?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I could make some suggestions concerning those who are writing your
&gt; &gt; curriculum ;-P
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah me too. What the !
&gt; Bugger it, why not just get them to redefine the DOM  while their at it
&gt; ! Ian , you said somewhere they have a template ?
&gt; Where would one find this thing ?? 
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps we could just do it and write a "HowTo" for the Students...??
&gt; 
&gt; Talk about learning curves.. and only Mozilla 6 + and latest IE support
&gt; XSL on the fly.. I've never tried to use it live.  
&gt; 
&gt; My head hurts allready.
