Oops.  This got rejected by the mailing list because I used the

&gt;&gt; On this list there has been little distinction between, Linux and the

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have to wonder though, is AUUG, the most appropriate body to be
&gt;&gt; representing a combination a OS software when negotiating with the
&gt;&gt; government. Take Greg's mail below for instance. The thrust of the
&gt;&gt; article was Linux based, and more than likely the Linux phenomenon is
&gt;&gt; making waves in all government departments and hence rational thinking
&gt;&gt; people will evaluate its effectiveness for their needs.
&gt;
&gt; Well, "Linux" is the word that people know.  If you look at what is
&gt; actually being used out there, the big hits are more likely to be
&gt; Samba and Apache.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yet at the end Greg clearly indicates that his push is for BSD and
&gt;&gt; making it an attractive option for filling government roles, which I
&gt;&gt; must say is great in itself, but will AUUG, work for The "Australian
&gt;&gt; Unix Users Group" commercial Unix's included, to the detriment of
&gt;&gt; Linux.
&gt;
&gt; *sigh* Doubtless you're talking about this:

&gt;&gt;&gt;   The National Office of the Information Economy plans to organise a
&gt;&gt;&gt;   briefing on the use of Linux at the enterprise level for chief
&gt;&gt;&gt;   information officers and chief technology officers in the public
&gt;&gt;&gt;   sector.
&gt;
&gt; This is in fact a misquotation.  The NOIE is looking at open source
&gt; software, not Linux.  The reporter presumably didn't know the
&gt; difference.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gordon and I met Steve Alford in Melbourne earlier this month.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt; made a much better impression on us than we expected, and we realise
&gt;&gt;&gt; that we still need to find our feet in this material.  If anybody has
&gt;&gt;&gt; interesting opinions or ideas, we'd welcome them.  Note that we're
&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about solid business reasons why the Government should use
&gt;&gt;&gt; BSD, not ideological ones.
&gt;
&gt; That was supposed to be a teaser, my reply to the misquote above.  I
&gt; didn't expect anybody to take it seriously.  Yes, of course we want
&gt; BSD as well.  But if you want to see what we're really talking about,
&gt; take a look at our press releases, in this case
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au/publications/press/callToAuGov2002.html.">http://www.auug.org.au/publications/press/callToAuGov2002.html.</A>
&gt; That's what we're really doing in public.  Yes, we're not only
&gt; advocating Linux.  We're also not only advocating BSD.  Without Samba
&gt; and Apache, they would only be half as much use.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Will Linux, considering it is Linux that has turned the world on its
&gt;&gt; head get fair representation from AUUG?
&gt;
&gt; Yes and no.  No, it's not because it has turned the world on its head.
&gt; Microsoft has done that too.  It's because it's part of AUUG's
&gt; charter.  And for that reason, yes, Linux will get fair
&gt; representation.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Lastly, my reason for this post comes from my attendance at the AUUG
&gt;&gt; security symposium last year. It was quite apparent from vendors and
&gt;&gt; AUUG attendees, that Linux was seen as tolerable, but in many
&gt;&gt; aspects not what was wanted. They would much rather have seen one of
&gt;&gt; the BSD going great guns, rather than Linux.
&gt;
&gt; I suppose that depends on who you talk to.  If you want to see more
&gt; Linux representation at AUUG conferences, there's a simple way to
&gt; achieve it: attend.  In fact, we're rather disappointed that we don't
&gt; see more Linux people there.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; And do I really want BSD being funded for improvement by government
&gt;&gt; departments,(public money) so that corporations can take the best
&gt;&gt; bits and make them propriety?
&gt;
&gt; I don't want to get into a licensing debate, but I don't see this
&gt; happening.  The corporations that want the best bits of BSD already
&gt; have them.  That's not the government.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Have Linux groups dropped the ball on this, should we have
&gt;&gt; Incorporated across the country?
&gt;
&gt; I don't think so.
&gt;
&gt; One of the lessons we *should* have learnt from UNIX history is that
&gt; there was too much parochialism, too much attention to territorial
&gt; interests.  It harmed UNIX greatly, and if it continues, it will harm
&gt; open source UNIX projects.  If we want to make a real impression on
&gt; the Real World, we need to do it together, not appear to them like a
&gt; lot of warring factions.  We're happy enough that we have managed to
&gt; get the attention of the NOIE as it is.
