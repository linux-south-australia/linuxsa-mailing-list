&gt; &gt; On this list there has been little distinction between, Linux and the

I can vouch for the fact that AUUG does this quite well, as do some of
their corporate members. It is quite astonishing (for example) to hear
senior Apple staff saying "the enemey of our enemy is our friend", talking
about Linux. This is Apple, whose open source interests clearly are in
BSD. Similarly to hear the current president of AUUG promoting Linux to a
business decision maker who thinks that Linux is just like Microsoft but
doesn't cost money. This is a FreeBSD core team member. Or to see SGI
staff members explaining how proprietary (and clearly very good for the
purpose) Irix systems can be replaced by Linux if the customer
wishes.

I really don't think this suggestion holds water. I'm not a member of AUUG
(or anything else) and would probably detail biased behaviour on this list
if I saw it in the hope that they would stop (because it makes my job
harder.)

On the other side, I see plenty of people whose sole Unix experience is
Linux quite happy to avoid the OS issue altogether because the person in
front of them has a problem to solve and doesn't even care what an OS
is. This is what I see on LinuxSA as well, more or less, as well as
reflected by AUUG.

&gt; &gt; I have to wonder though, is AUUG, the most appropriate body to be
&gt; &gt; representing a combination a OS software when negotiating with the
&gt; &gt; government.
