Daniel,

I've had quite a bit of experience with Sony CDRW on Debian 2.2 and Woody 
with kernels 2.2 and 2.4.18 so here goes...

Contrary to another post on this topic, I don't think an automounter is 
causing your problems because I noticed that automounters were not 
installed by default on my platform.

Getting the burner part working is best left to last (IMHO).  The SCSI 
emulation has a number of traps and I can see that your first priority is to 
get the bugger to read and hence prove, or otherwise, that the lower levels 
are OK.  If you agree, just undo the SCSI related steps described below.  

According to your drive allocation, you appear to have put both CDs on the 
same ide channel.  This is discouraged in one of the HOWTO's - reason given 
is that CDs are slow yet demand attention at critical times so it is best to 
pair them with a fast HDD.  May I suggest that you disconnect one of your CDs 
at least during fault finding to eliminate this potential problem.  Better 
that you find out AFTER the individual drives are sorted.  While you are at 
it, double check the master/slave settings on both devices connected to each 
IDE channel.  I had a problem with an older HDD that wouldn't be a slave to a 
CD yet it was OK with another HDD (some sort of snobbery perhaps? ;-)

Next try to mount CDs as ide devices (assuming you have switched off SCSI 
emulation).   eg #&gt; mount /dev/hdc /mnt  As you anticipated, dd is also a 
good thing to try; hdparm could also be used for diagnostics.  If all else 
fails, turn to the dark side and see if Windoz can access the hardware, good 
old DOS combined with MSCDEX on a floppy is all you need.

Assuming that the above has satisfied you that nothing is broken, please have 
a read of CD-Writing-HOWTO.gz  My experience with Debian 2.2 was that things 
didn't work from a standard installation and this HOWTO was essential to get 
it right.

The HOWTO stipulates that some of the SCSI emulation must be built into 
modules.  Contrary to my Deb 2.2 experience, I have reason to believe that 
Deb 3.0 does come with the correct modules but I didn't get to confirm this 
because I had to recompile my kernel out of a different necessity.  

According to my notes, I had to add these items to /etc/modules.. 
	loop 
	ide-scsi 
Again, you should check with the HOWTO because on my system I compiled as 
much as I could as built-in rather than modules so your list may be longer.  
Just to be safe run update-modules to ensure that these changes are put into 
place (this is a Debian thing).  If still in doubt, ask again on the list for 
another Debian user to describe their /etc/modules.

Just one more configuration item, your lilo configuration should have a line 
like this:  append="hdc=ide-scsi"

Reboot and repeat the CD reading tests with /dev/scd0 (or whatever).  By the 
way, on my system...
brw-rw----    1 root     cdrom     11,   0 Mar 15 08:24 /dev/scd0

Finally, do:
	cdrecord -scanbus
On your multi-burner system this should be very useful.

.. and for something just a little different, visit the "coaster factory" at:
	<A HREF="http://www.ping.be/satcp/software.htm">http://www.ping.be/satcp/software.htm</A>

and this site...
<A HREF="http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Firmware/LatestFirmwareUpdates.asp">http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Firmware/LatestFirmwareUpdates.asp</A>

I went there and found some firmware updates which the Sony site didn't even 
mention - unfortunately you must turn to the Dark Side to use these.  I 
haven't had a chance to try them out, maybe somebody else on this list could 
save me the effort.  My Sony drive has this bug whereby it takes about 10 to 
20 seconds to start reading a CD after loading it, and not just under Linux.  
Has anyone fixed a problem like this (or even unlike this) through a firmware 
update??

Good Luck,

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I have been trying to get my cdrom working for quite some time now, and
&gt; am almost ready to give up... thought I'd try a post to the list as a
&gt; last resort.
&gt;
&gt; It seems whenever I try to use dd or cp to copy a cd, it gives me an i/o
&gt; error. This is my setup:
&gt;
&gt; Debian Woody, 2.4.18 kernel, using xfs.
&gt; hda: / on xfs
&gt; hdb: currently unmounted xfs drive
&gt; hdc: ide cdrw, is /dev/scd0
&gt; hdd: ide cdrom
&gt; (Both cd drives are made by Sony)
&gt;
&gt; The problem could be a number of things, but (as far as I know) I've
&gt; elimenated most of these...
&gt;
&gt; 1. Hardware problem
&gt;
&gt; I have tried both of the currently installed drives, with the same
&gt; errors (although weirdly (?) the filesizes I get with a dd if=/dev/hdd
&gt; and dd if=/dev/scd0 give different filesizes...). The cdrom drive is
&gt; quite new (I bought it maybe half a year ago because my previous drive
&gt; had the same problem, and I was trying to rule out faulty cdrom) but has
&gt; not had a lot of use since I got the i/o errors the very first time I
&gt; tried it after plugging it in.
&gt;
&gt; Also, this new drive was bought before my latest hardware upgrade, and
&gt; so I have got the error with both a Pentium-1 200MHz and a Pentium-II
&gt; 400MHz, both naturally using different motherboards.
&gt;
&gt; 2. IDE bus itself
&gt;
&gt; I have plugged the cdrom into both hdb and hdd, so I am guessing that it
&gt; is not a matter of one of my IDE channels being faulty. I also tried
&gt; using a different IDE cable I had lying around.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Faulty media
&gt;
&gt; I have so far tried 11 of the CD's in my collection for testing, most of
&gt; them being normal data CD's of varying ages/condition, and one being a
&gt; VCD that was burned only a few days ago on a TDK CD (reliable brand?)
&gt; with no scratches or dust to be seen. Of these, only one (fairly old) cd
&gt; copied without error.
&gt;
&gt; I have so far been pretty much avoiding the use of my cdrom drive, but I
&gt; am getting rather annoyed with it.. My friends come around and when I
&gt; tell them it's not working I get "why don't you read it in Windows it
&gt; worked in my computer..." as you can imagine it's really annoying.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone knows anything that could help, I really would love to hear
&gt; from you. Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Daniel Mundy
