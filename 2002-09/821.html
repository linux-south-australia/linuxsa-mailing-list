Yes that's us.

Basically what I want to do is hook up my notebook to my network - I'm
wondering if I need an access point, or just stick a card in my linux box
and get that to act as a router. Access points act as bridges... I wonder if
I can get linux to do bridging?

Hi Ian,

I'm in a similar position as you - if you get any useful advice off list,
could pass it on please?

I am receiving a LOT of conflicting views on wireless NIC's - I have found
Surecom pretty cheap - D-Link from around $180 - some guy I just called at a
shop told me there is a big difference which is why they only sell $300 3COM
PCI wireless cards.

What IS the difference?  Can I get away with a cheap wireless NIC - or will
it be another non-Linux happy appliance that is a pain to set up and will
leave me wishing I got a d-link or linksys card or whatever?

Maybe I am just better off getting a wireless access point and plugging that
in to my old desktop machine rather than a el-cheapo surecom wireless NIC?

I'm just trying to work out why there is such wild variation on wireless
prices and if I can get away with cheap stuff (ie - am I just paying for
brand name?)

Boost computers say Surecom is fine - they keep rolling them out - but
another vendor said they suck (in a nice way) while this other guy at a shop
tells me 3COM is the way to go for $300 - that I get what I pay for?

Arrrgghhh - any views?
