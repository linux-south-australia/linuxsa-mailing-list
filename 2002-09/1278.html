Brian,
 
&gt; Can someone explain what the VM is inside the Linux Kernel - what it does ?

Do you mean the Virtual Memory? 

If you do then it's the amount of memory the system thinks it has. It
can be comprised of:

* RAM
* Swap Partitions
* Swap Files

There's probably other types of memory but these are the most common.
The kernel tries to use the fastest type of memory which is the RAM (1).
If you use a certain amount of RAM (2) then the kernel will start
swapping memory pages (3) if it is able. This "swapping" is done to your
swap partitions or files and you will notice in the documentation for
swapon (4) that partitions and files can have priorities. You probably
want your fastest swap to be used first. Swap partitions are faster than
swap files (5).

Once you've used all of your RAM and swap partitions and files you've
run out of memory; you will notice this long before you do run out of
memory because what will happen is your virtual memory manager(6) will
start to "thrash" -- it will spend more time swapping memory pages to
swap partitions and/or files than actually using the memory.

DSL

(1) Currently at least; I wonder whether we'll ever see the day when
mass storage is faster than current RAM

(2) The kernel doesn't let you use all the RAM and then start swapping
to disk. Reason? The kernel needs a little bit of RAM to manage the swap
to disk efficiently.

(3) Memory is organised into pages. Onboard, hardware chips know about
these pages and assist the kernel by providing hardware signals )eg,
page faults) to the main processor. Currently I think the pages are
about 4Kb but don't quote me.

(4) man swapon

(5) Reason? File systems generally use memory themselves because they
assume that storing your most recent requests in RAM will be faster than
requesting it from disk. Also they can do all sorts of things like
journal buffering, require permission tests and so forth. Now, if your
aim is to get some memory pages ONTO DISK then having your file system
keeping those pages IN RAM is a rather silly exercise.

I don't know the details of a swap partition but I suspect it would be
designed to be much more efficient for memory pages than any current
file system.

(6) Deciding what pages to swap in and what pages to swap out and when
is, at best, a black art. It can get highly mathematical (queuing
theory, operations research) and not all methods will work for all
situations. Let's say I have 128Mb of RAM and a process that takes 95%
of RAM but that's the only process. I don't want any of those pages
swapped to disk but some algorithms might. However, if I also ran lots
of other processes than having only 5% of RAM available could be a total
pain.

Ones mileage definitely varies.
