&gt; Ditto that.  The only problems I've ever had with it are from

Cyrus works well and is a very nice piece of work. I use it.

Cyrus is unsuitable for some purposes. Here are some possible problems
depending on your particular constraints:

   1) it uses a closed black-box model for data storage, as far as MUA
      software is concerned. The only way an MUA can get to mail data is
      if it can talk IMAP. There are many situations where this is not
      helpful. I can provide examples if required. (In some situations this
      is an excellent idea, because it enforces a standard.)

   2) it implements this black-box using the well-known Berkeley DB
      database (instead of the Maildir-like system it used to use.) The
      trouble is, database performance drops off much faster than
      filesystem performance when you get to large sizes, especially for
      objects that databases aren't very good at handling such as BLOBs.
      Most people don't hit this limit. But if you are after maximum
      speed, a DB won't give it to you compared to a filesystem
      especially for uncomplicated access patterns. Modern hardware often 
      makes this a non-issue for all but very big or very heavy-use setups.

   3) You can't avoid SASL for authentication. I think this is still a 
      restriction (should check to make sure it is still true.) SASL is
      not one of the big standards around, meaning you have to write and
      maintain glue.
