Hi,

I've got a Redhat 7.3 box which seems to be having issues with named...  The
box is basically a fresh install, which I'm starting to configure as a
proxy/firewall/NAT machine.  The machine in question (snares) has two
network cards.  eth1 is connected to our internal network, and eth0 has a
real IP on our DMZ network.  The DMZ network is connected to the internet
through another Linux box (rockhopper) which acts as a router/firewall
between the DMZ and the rest of the world...  So the configuration looks
like this...

Internal Network   &lt;---&gt;   eth1   snares   eth0    &lt;---&gt;  eth0 rockhopper
&lt;---&gt; Internet
(10.0.0.x)              (10.0.0.1)      (x.x.x.12)        (x.x.x.1)

I'm using the default Red Hat configuration for the name server on snares,
which should give me a basic caching only name server.  I've verified the
named.conf (attached) against the DNS HOWTO's sample for a caching
configuration and aside from some file name differences they appear
identical.  My resolv.conf contains...

nameserver 127.0.0.1

... and named is running.  According to /var/log/messages named has started,
and is listening on both eth adapters and 127.0.0.1.  There are no errors
reported in /var/log/messages, and 'netstat -a' shows port 53 is listening
on all interfaces.

No iptables rules have been configured on snares (yet).  Rockhopper allows
outbound connections on tcp port 80 and outbound/inbound traffic on port 53
(both tcp and udp).  All other traffic to/from this box is logged then
dropped by rockhopper.  Nothing is showing in the logs however.

The problem is simply that named doesn't seem to be accepting any
connections (on any interface).  Running nslookup against the new box either
locally, or through either eth interface doesn't resolve any names for me...

[<A HREF="mailto:jim@adelie">jim@adelie</A> /root]$ nslookup -sil
&gt; server x.x.x.12
Default server: x.x.x.12
Address: x.x.x.12#53
&gt; www.linuxsa.org.au
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
&gt; 

... I get the same error if I do the same thing with 127.0.0.1 as well.  I'm
stumped, does anyone have any suggestions as to what I've done wrong?

Jim.
