I have a couple of comments, but I don't want to add too much "fuel to the 
fire" :)

Quoting steve donaldson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:steve@centraldocuments.com">steve@centraldocuments.com</A>&gt;:
&gt; On this list there has been little distinction between, Linux and the
&gt; BSD's.  For all intents and purposes, we have been treating them as one
&gt; (mostly).
&gt; 
&gt; I have to wonder though, is AUUG, the most appropriate body to be
&gt; representing a combination a OS software when negotiating with the
&gt; government. Take Greg's mail below for instance. The thrust of the
&gt; article was Linux based, and more than likely the Linux phenomenon is
&gt; making waves in all government departments and hence rational thinking
&gt; people will evaluate its effectiveness for their needs.

AUUG has stepped into the limelight because no-one else has.  Various LUGs are 
incorporated, but haven't taken this up.  If there are people who are 
interested in political lobbying, who are also AUUG members, then let AUUG 
represent us - it's better that AUUG does it than no-one else[1].  As RMS 
says, "it will be quicker if you help" - ie. if you think there will be bias 
that you don't like, then start working yourself in this arena.

&gt; Yet at the end Greg clearly indicates that his push is for BSD and
&gt; making it an attractive option for filling government roles, which I
&gt; must say is great in itself, but will AUUG, work for The "Australian
&gt; Unix Users Group" commercial Unix's included, to the detriment of Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Will Linux, considering it is Linux that has turned the world on its
&gt; head get fair representation from AUUG?

If open source[2] is taken up by government, whether that be by a BSD or Linux, 
I don't care.  My life becomes easier if non-proprietry software development is 
funded and used by our governement.  Let's make it happen and let's not get in 
the way.

[1] and I'm not critisizing AUUG at all here.
[2] open-source, free software, I don't care.  Give me the source or I die!
