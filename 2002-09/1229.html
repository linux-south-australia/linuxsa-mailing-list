&gt; So, Linux people, care to tell the list what attracts you to Linux?

Well, for me, Linux was a way to run a Unix variant on hardware I had
at home. This was when the only alternative was to buy a Xenix, SCO or
BSD license, all of which were ridiculously expensive for a home user
not yet out of Uni.

Jumping forward a few years, Linux became a "friendly" *nix. Things
were easy to setup and configure to ones liking. It was stable, ran on
modest hardware and I now had enough boxen that dedicated Linux
machines running things like Samba and Apache and Squid became very
useful to me.

Later still, I diversified. I now run several boxen at home, for
different purposes, running different OSs. My firewall runs OpenBSD,
my main server runs SuSE Linux (7.2 - with hand built upgraded
packages), the development server runs Solaris 8 x86. And I have an
iBook running OS X 10.1.5 (which as soon as I get my arse into gear
and do my tax return, should get upgraded to 10.2). And the PC's have
Winblows on them, but that's mainly because I don't have high end Macs
;)

My OS of choice is not Linux, but rather MacOS X. However, having said
that, I'm not about to run out and replace my x86 boxen with Mac's so
I can run OS X on them. No, Linux still plays an integral part in my
network, it's the glue that holds it all together.

I tried FreeBSD (4.6 if you must know) but found it to be, well, less
polished than Linux. Sure, it's probably better under the hood (no
flames please), but it just seemed to require more work than your
average Linux distro. That's not to say I wouldn't use FreeBSD on a
server, but as a desktop it's lacking. (Hell, Darwin is based on
FreeBSD, and I like that).

So I guess, what I'm trying to say is that Linux is now at a stage
whereby it's a commodity tool, at least for me anyway. I know that if
I want a webserver, Linux will provide a stable platform to put it on.
But it's not the be all and end all of computing OSs. Each OS has it's
strengths and abilities and that should be remembered when choosing an
OS for a specific purpose.

~hmmm, I seem to have waffled a bit there...
