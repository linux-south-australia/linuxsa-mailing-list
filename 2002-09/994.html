As for window managers, I find sawfish and gnome work pretty fast
together. I have such a system running on a p166 with 64mb of ram, and
with redhat 7.3 and it flys along. (only marginally slower than a
athalon XP1800 with 512mb DDR ram under XP, till you do some serious
multimedia encoding anyway).

As for vmware, you dont need a second window manager or anything, just
leave it on another virtual desktop on your main xserver. I used to run
like this, with windows 95 (small memory footprint) with 64mb of ram
allocated to it, as I needed to use an access database. I used the
bridged networking, and gave the vmware "box" and extra IP and it all
worked fine. It looked like I had 2 pcs on the network from the network.
You do need a heap of ram though. 128mb is not enough. I got away with
192mb, but I still couldnt run much on the linux side before it started
swapping. 256mb + and it should be fine for performance with both OSs. 

Of course eventually I got one of those completely terminal registry
errors on boot up under 95 one day, so I found a way to ditch the access
database, and removed all copys of windows from my machine permanently
and have never looked back ;)

&gt; 
&gt; So why are the others so much faster?  For the first time I actually felt I
&gt; was running a fast computer..  It's just so damn quick - like you can see
&gt; those GHz ticking over.  Other Window managers (MS Windows included) never
&gt; seem to behave as though one is actually running a faster machine.
&gt; 
&gt; 	startx /usr/X11R6/bin/windowmaker -- :1  (for example) will work.
&gt; 
&gt; Brilliant!
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Could one run VMWare under another console to have two operating systems
&gt;  &gt; that one can switch between?
&gt; 
&gt; 	That seems a bit extreme :-)
&gt; 
&gt; We live in an extreme world :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing extreme about two OS's running in tandem - today's desktop machines
&gt; with a good chunk of RAM seem to be able to handle that kind of thing no
&gt; problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Will VMWare run under a basic Window Manager like IceWm or Black Box?
