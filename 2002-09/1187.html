Quoting "Schenk, Jarrad" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jarrad.schenk@dsto.defence.gov.au">jarrad.schenk@dsto.defence.gov.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; Every morning I find that there is a process called logrotate that is hogging
&gt; 35MB or more of ram and using a high percentage of the CPU load. From the 
&gt; name I can guess what it is supposed to be doing but does it really need that
&gt; much ram and CPU time to swap a few files around? Is this a bug or does this
&gt; process really use that much?

Hi Jarrad,

I only have a RH7.0 box in front of me, so I can only speak about that version, 
but logrotate appears to do it's stuff on a monthly, not daily basis.  Have a 
look at /etc/logrotate.conf

There's no reported errata for logrotate in RH7.3 (see 
<A HREF="http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh73-errata.html">http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh73-errata.html</A>)

Do you watch the X files?  If it's not that I'm not sure what else it could be.

&gt; Because it is using a good percentage of my system ram, it makes everything 
&gt; else run really slow as the system needs to swap things in and out of disk. I
&gt; can kill the process off (which I don't really like doing but is the only way
&gt; to get a usable system) and everything comes good but soon after, another 
&gt; process called updatedb starts. this uses alot of IO time on the disk and 
&gt; also slows things down. is it safe stop updatedb from running and if so,
&gt; how?

rpm -qfi `which updatedb` will tell you all about what updatedb is all about.  
If you add an 'l' to the rpm switches you'll see 
that /etc/cron.daily/slocate.cron is part of the suite.  Taking this file out 
of /etc/cron.daily will stop it running daily.  You can probably guess that 
moving it to cron.weekly or cron.monthly will delay the updates, but still do 
it occasionally.

Hope this helps,

Michael...
