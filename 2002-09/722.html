oooohhh - that is a good party trick.

I think the distinction needs to be made between 'desktop' and 'server'
which many LinuxSA'ers assume all desktop machines should be run as.

Who cares about RAM, resource use, etc - only one person will be physically
using the machine at a time - 512 or even 384MB RAM seems to do the trick
for me.  512MB leaves plenty of RAM left over.

I am sure Linux is smart enough to swap out what is not being used anyhow -
so only the active session (correct me if I am mistaken) will actually
reside in RAM.

I want to get Windows XP and Linux running on two screens on my laptop -
that would be a cool party trick.  Be a good learning experience too..

&gt; 
&gt; It means that if say a family share a computer - they can all have their
own
&gt; locked X session running without having to log out and back in to hand the
&gt; machine to someone else.

The biggest problem with that is available ram and swap space. I'm sure
that's why someone invented session managers. I use gnome-session myself
and it works fine.

&gt; 
&gt; It would also be cool to run VMWare in one terminal running Win2K or the
&gt; like - so you could switch between to completely different OS's quite
easily
&gt; - would be a great party trick and to impress M$ heads..

A good vmware party trick is to run wincrap in a vmware window running
full screen on a xinerama desktop. So you can have say the left monitor
running windoh's and the right screen running your favourite linux
window manager, with the mouse moving seamlessly between the two.
