Ian,

&gt; What is IPCop and Clarkconnect like?  The latter sounds good if it has good
&gt; graphing utilities.

I've seen IPCop and it's quite good; it's what I suggest to people who
don't particularly want to know what their firewall is doing but want to
be reasonably sure -- as far as anyone who trusts something they don't
understand -- is secure.

&gt; David sometimes forgets that we are not all techies - the rest of us simply
&gt; do not have the time to wade through manuals - we need to set up first and
&gt; ask questions later or learn when we need to.

Ahem, you said you wanted to learn about firewalls and routing.

I didn't say "don't setup an IPCop box first, then setup a built from
scratch box", I just said you'll learn more by building it from scratch.
I might add that security isn't something you want to ask later or learn
when you need to :-)

&gt; And I am not doing this for a living so that disqualifies me from the
&gt; necessity run spartan dated text consoles only when on today's machines a
&gt; lean window manager is not even a blip on the CPU and memory radar (I am not
&gt; talking KDE / Gnome - more like IceWM and so on).

Spartan dated text consoles? Why do you lack the confidence to use them
-- you seem to me to be intelligent, willing to learn and you ask the
right questions (with good grammar and good spelling and not in HTML
e-mail)...

&gt; David is right - GUIs are for the weak - so I am weak - but hey - at least I
&gt; am enjoying myself and learning a few things to boot.

I'm not going to be drawn on that one, but I would counsel you to learn
"why" you are selecting items from a list box or checking check buttons
on or off as well as the effects they have.


DSL

(1) Why is it that otherwise highly intelligent, wise people manage to
convinve themselves they are too stupid to use a text console without a
GUI?
