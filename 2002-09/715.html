Andrew,

All the replies on the list didnt seem to answer your question.

Short answer: All you have to do is start another X session.

Longer answer in an example:
If my computer runs init level 5 (GUI by default) that X session is
labelled ":0" or the first session
if I want to start another .... all I would do is type ctrl+alt+f1 to get
back to a text console
      login as the user I want to run the X server as .. .
      then just type startx -- :1
startx is just a shell script that sets a lot of things up for running X
the -- argument specifies anything after this argument is an argument to
the X server
obviously the :1 tells the X server to run on the :1 session
NOTE: session isnt quite the right word but it will do for illistration
purposes.

Hello all,

How would I go about running multiple window managers (KDE, Gnome, etc...)
simultaneously? That is, to have (for example) KDE running on session 7 and
Gnome running on session 8.

Im sure there is more to it, but i understand that the X server can have
many hosts and this should just be a matter of telling each window manager
to "take a number".

I have tried "man startx" and followed leads from there but still cannot
find the means to do this.

Cheers,

Andrew Galdes
