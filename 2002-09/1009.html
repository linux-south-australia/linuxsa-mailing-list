Firstly, I think you need to configure your email client a little better - to 
at least quote messages rather than just including them verbatim.  As 'grog' 
would say, "message format now recovered" :)

Quoting "Mcleod, Ian" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ian.mcleod@eds.com">ian.mcleod@eds.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Will VMWare run under a basic Window Manager like IceWm or Black Box?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; You''ll find[1] that you probably don't even need a window manager to run 
&gt; &gt; VMWare or indeed any X application[2].  You may not find it very user
&gt; &gt; friendly though :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Oh God - you aren't going to tell me that console only MS Windows is the
&gt; only way to go - that the GUI is just a waste anyway as well are you?  I
&gt; think the whole point of running windows is to actually have windows.

&lt;dsl-cranky-mode&gt;
Ian!
I'm not sure how you could have got THAT from my post!  Although I do agree 
with the premise that GUIs are for WHIMPS, and that the command-line is the WAY 
TO GO.
&lt;/dsl-cranky-mode&gt;

Ahem, sorry about that :)  It's out of my system now.

I'm not sure the point of windows is to have windows, but rather to be able to 
run M$ Office and DirectX games.  But I wasn't implying that you should use 
Windows on the command line.  It was your second point that I was suggesting...
 
&gt; Or are you suggesting VMWare can run without X as it's own 'window manager'?
&gt; That would be a VERY interesting concept but I don't see how that would
&gt; happen.  How funny would it be though if XP ran faster under Linux (better
&gt; filesystem or memory / cache management or something) than under the naked
&gt; box itself?  "Linux accelerates XP better than XP" - ha ha

Windows managers aren't a required component for an X-Windows desktop.  I think 
we've covered that point enough.  

VMWare is an emulator - it can't run quicker than "on the raw hardware".  What 
it does give you (amongst other things) is the ability to run off a virtual 
hard disk, so you don't need to reinstall Windows and all your apps when 
everything gets corrupted - you just copy your backup disk back on top and away 
you go again.
