Government Linux drive grows
Kate Mackenzie
SEPTEMBER 25, 2002  
 
GOVERNMENT agency CIOs will soon be participating in a Linux briefing,
organised amidst growing public sector interest in the open source platform.

The National Office for the Information Economy will hold a conference later
this year or early next year, at the request of federal government
department and agency CIOs. 
Linux was one of the topics raised at a recent discussion held on changes
from perpetual to subscription licensing, such as Microsoft's 6.0 licensing
scheme, NOIE's general manager of business strategies, Steve Alford, said. 

Security, Linux and e-procurement were nominated as topics for further
discussion, and security briefings have already been held as a result. 

However Linux was the only area attracting significant CIO-level interest. 

"The e-procurement work is tending to operate at a slightly lower level at
this stage," Mr Alford said. "A couple of CIOs attended the security
briefings, but attendees were mainly security managers." 

The Linux CIO briefing will probably be followed by a more tech-focused
event, he said. 

"We'll probably end up with two: one at CIO level to give the broad business
picture, then if CIOs are interesting in following it up, we'll go for a
more technical audience." 

IBM has already confirmed it will participate in the forum, and the
Australian Unix Users Group and the System Administrators Guild have also
offered to pitch in. 

CIOs found the format useful because "we are providing them with some advice
from the vendor and some independent advice", he said. 

The forum will also include reports back from Centrelink and the Department
of Veterans' Affairs, which both began deploying Linux this year. 

"Interest has been building over six months or so - Senator Richard Alston's
office been interested for some time," Mr Alford said.
