Never know - I may just give a demonstration!

Or would it be best to run VMWare under BSD (is that possible?) and then run
Linux and Win2K under that on two virtual terminals.  You could have some
sort of log in manager that lets you select operating system as well as
session type.

I've always wondered how to use spare physical RAM to boost the system
further - I thought Linux does that by default - the RAM is listed as free
but it is being taken up by buffers, caches, etc.

Theoretically does this mean that Win2K has the potential to operate even
more efficiently under a well configured VMWare session than under native
hardware?  Perhaps Linux can bring in better caching and buffering.  I don't
see Win2K using spare RAM for much..

Ian,

&gt; I think the distinction needs to be made between 'desktop' and 'server'
&gt; which many LinuxSA'ers assume all desktop machines should be run as.

I'm almost certain that even if you had 20 instances of X running then
only one copy of the X code would actually be referenced. That is to
say, as much of the memory that could be shared will be shared. 

&gt; Who cares about RAM, resource use, etc - only one person will be
physically
&gt; using the machine at a time - 512 or even 384MB RAM seems to do the trick
&gt; for me.  512MB leaves plenty of RAM left over.

Use the spare RAM to tune your system then :-)
