&gt; So anyway, that's the critical difference between a Bachelor of Information
&gt; Technology and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science:  The former
&gt; degree gives you a job qualification, and the latter degree teaches you
&gt; to be a scientist (which is almost useless in the commercial world).
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; If you want a BSc in "maths _and_ comp sci" then do that
&gt; 
&gt; No -- if you want a degree in Comp Sci, then you need to accept that
&gt; Mathematics is essential for just about every aspect of science that you
&gt; can think of.  Computer Science != Computing.
&gt; 

Yes, maths is important to comp sci, but I have yet to see what SVC has 
to do with the science of computing, maybe at the silicon level? But 
that is the territory of Computer System / Electrical Engineers. Binary 
logic is the basis of computing, and it is taught in computing subjects, 
not mathematics. As for job qualifications, I am happy that I was taught 
C++ (amongst a multitude of others) in my BSc rather than VB in an IT 
degree, and because I learned as much (or more) about how programming 
languages work as I did about using a particular language, I am better 
equipped to quickly be able to code in a language I have never seen before.

&gt; Biology is just applied chemistry;  Chemistry and Engineering are just
&gt; applied physics.  Physics and computer science are just applied
&gt; mathematics.  Maths is at the root of all the sciences.  
&gt; 

Of course it is, but how much pure mathematics does an everyday applied 
biologist use? This is like saying to use a 4GL language you need to 
have an in depth understanding of the physics of the silicon that your 
program will run on. Abstraction is a wonderful thing :)

&gt; Designing algorithms is an aspect of applied mathematics;  that's
&gt; what Computer Scientists do.  Writing software to efficiently and
&gt; correctly implement algorithms which someone else has designed is
&gt; what Bachelor of IT graduates do :-)
&gt; 

No applied mathematics is what applied mathematitians do :)
