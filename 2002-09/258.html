&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I had only seen the Australian House of Representatives on TV once, and
&gt; that was back when I was 21, probably 1992.
&gt; I used to watch Prime Minister's Question Time from the Brittish House
&gt; of Commons every week on CSPAN (<A HREF="http://www.cspan.org">http://www.cspan.org</A>).  CSPAN is the
&gt; U.S. version of the AU television channel you described. One week, the
&gt; Brittish House was in recess, and so the Australian verision was played
&gt; instead.
&gt;
&gt; Although there was some entertainment value to it, I mostly watched the
&gt; Brittish House of Commons to keep abreast of world events from a
&gt; different perspective.
&gt;
&gt; In the Brittish House, you used to have to submit the question ahead of
&gt; time in writing. After the Prime Minister answered the first question,
&gt; the member was allowed a follow up question that was related to the
&gt; original question. What ended up happening was that all of the Ministers
&gt; would ask the same open ended question in writing, such as to allow them
&gt; to ask the real question at follow up: "What is the Prime Minister's
&gt; Schedule Today?"

This thread has gone so O/T that I feel compelled to mention the word
"Linux".  Mmmmm. Once more, maybe twice.  "Linux, Linux".... That feels
better now.

I'm no expert on parliamentary procedure but at Question Time it seems that
anybody can ask anybody else any damned thing.  Linux. Linux.  The PM doesn't
appear to be any different in that he can be asked questions just like anyone
else.

Questions can be asked as "Questions without Notice" or "Questions with
Notice".  As I understand it, the member can choose to answer the Question
without Notice there and then, or refer it to his/her department or otherwise
seek the answers to provide to parliament at the next session.

Questions come in 3 main divisions:

1) attempt to trip up or embarass some member of the opposite party, or
hopefully the entire opposite party- very common technique used by members
from the opposition benches.
2) ask a question of somebody in your own party, the answer to which is
probably known by the questioner, in an effort to make your own party look
good - common method used by party that holds power.
3) ask a question of the opposite party, the answer to which you do not know
or to which you would actually like to know the answer - rare, almost never
happens. ;)

Commonly used strategies to answer:
1) Don't answer it: just talk about any damned thing, "beat around the bush"
for a while, use the words "Mr Speaker" a lot, and just keep filling in time
until you are told by the Speaker (that's the moderator of our parliament,
who sits in the big chair), either:
a) "The time for answering the question has expired.  The member will resume
his seat", or
b) "The member will come to the question" (or similar words).
2) Don't answer it.
3) Don't answer it.

&gt; There was also a rule in which the Ministers were'nt allowed to ask
&gt; follow up questions that were prepared in advance, and therefore, they
&gt; were not allowed to read their question.
&gt;
&gt; I found the following episode in the Brittish House of Commons
&gt; entertaining however:
&gt;
&gt; One time a Minister started to ask a question:
&gt;
&gt; "I would like to ask...
&gt;
&gt; ***minister looks at paper to read***
&gt;
&gt; ***Entire House jeers 'READING!'****
&gt;
&gt; ...if the Prime Minister was aware...
&gt;
&gt; ***minister looks at paper to read***
&gt;
&gt; ***Entire House jeers 'READING!'****
&gt;
&gt; ...of the decline in the price of wool....
&gt;
&gt; ***minister looks at paper to read***
&gt;
&gt; ***Entire House jeers 'READING!'****
&gt;
&gt; ...and so on for about 30 seconds.

Yep, sometimes you've just *got* to laugh!  That moment has lived with you
pretty well then.  Can't tell you the number of times I've had a belly laugh
out of parliamentary proceedings, but it's quite a few.

&gt; In the U.S., you will never hear the opposition party cheer and jeer as
&gt; their leader takes the stage, because we don't really have a question
&gt; time. Instead, the U.S. House is very dull, the speaker pro tempore will
&gt; pound the gavel more to entertain himself than to tend to a group of
&gt; people that really needs quieting. Its kind of like a library.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, I was very impressed at the particularAustralian
&gt; Question Time that I saw. ** I will probably embarass myself here, but
&gt; there was something about the prime minister and the leader of the
&gt; opposition being allies at one point and then going their separate
&gt; ways....Mr. Hawke?? **

Yes.  You're talking about Hawke vs Keating. They were both on the same team
with Hawke as P.M. and Keating as Treasurer/Deputy P.M.  Basically, Keating's
colleagues got sick of waiting for Hawke to go, there was a party room vote
(of no confidence I think ?) against Hawke, and Keating replaced Hawke as
P.M.  Then Hawke shuffled off.  Probably a bit oversimplified what happenned
here, but as I recall it ATM, that's about what happenned.

&gt; Anyway, a very spirited debate took place there, and I think that's good
&gt; for democracy. I like the idea of a loyal opposition.

Here here.  Wouldn't have it any other way.  Well maybe I would.  Their
roudiness goes a bit too far sometimes, to the point that I find myself
wondering "how the hell do they get any thing done at all ?".

&gt; So in summary, I find both Brittian and Australia's legislature to be
&gt; more spirited and democratic then the U.S's.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The House will come to order.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hi James,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I find it difficult to believe you spend your time watching "Order in the
&gt; &gt;House" :)))  I know I do, but largely because the 'show' is broadcast by a
&gt; &gt;station that has no commercials (if you exclude advertising of their own
&gt; &gt;programming) & I just can't take a lot of advertisments while I try to
&gt; &gt; work away. . . . . Yelling in parliament ? That' a quite a different
&gt; &gt; mattter! ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;How does the Australian Parliament rate for entertainment value over there
&gt; &gt; in the US ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Cheers,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Andrew Lord

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;David, you need to get some sleep or something.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Do I?
