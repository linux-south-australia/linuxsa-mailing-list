Floppy disks stopped working for me sometime in the mid 90's.
I think after a couple of years of having to take everything around with about
100 copies of the same document spread over 10 disks, just in order to make
sure ONE made it there successfully, I threw out most of my floppy drives to
spite them.

Small harddrives had much greater capacity, almost infinitely higher
reliability (99.99% vs 0.005%), and were only marginally harder to insert than
a floppy. OK, so it required a reboot, but back then almost everything you did
on windows required one anyway.

&gt; 
&gt; I think they became really, really bad quite some time ago.  Presumably
&gt; proper head alignment is very important, and also very difficult to
&gt; achieve, which would explain why it reads on the drive that wrote it,
&gt; but not on any other.  I fear that CD-Rs are likely to be just as bad,
&gt; which is a pity because for SneakerNet, CD's are about the right size
&gt; and cost.
