&gt; &gt; I understand where Gregg and David N are coming from and agree we must
&gt; &gt; not get into a war over this, but like it or not, OSS is making inroads
&gt; &gt; into public minds and government run departments. I have a preference
&gt; &gt; for GPL licensing (like many others) and am wondering if AUUG would
&gt; &gt; prefer it to stay well tucked up in the background.
&gt; 
&gt; Another irrelevancy.  GPL is a licence that precludes you from turning
&gt; the product into something proprietary, whereas the BSD licence permits
&gt; you to do that. 

I'm not too sure how much the GPL really does that in practice anyway when
talking about assembled, branded products being sold to people who expect
an assembled, branded, supported product just like all the Windows
software they buy - and that's lots of people.

For example Nokia charge per IP address for their very popular firewalls
and I'm sure their pricing strategy didn't change when they switched from
FreeBSD to Linux inside. I get a feeling that popular perception is that
charging per IP address is not what Linux does or should do nor is it very
GPL-ish. But there is nothing stopping Nokia or anyone else doing this.
Free software users (including me) have laughed a lot at the SCO idea of
charging extra for TCP/IP in the OS, but it isn't much different to this
current example.

&gt; For example, BSD/OS, a proprietary product of BSDi, was
&gt; derived from BSD4.4.  There are people who like the product, just as
&gt; there are people who like, say, SCO Open Server, and they are quite
&gt; pleased to be able to pay real money for the product, and to get the
&gt; support that comes attendant thereon.  Likewise there are those who
&gt; prefer a free product and they choose FreeBSD.  Did BSD/OS hurt FreeBSD?

There are plenty of right up-to-date examples. I think the starting price
for 64-bit SuSE Linux for zSeries mainframe is something like 12,000
Euros, and unless you pay that much money you don't get the CDs. You can't
download the ISOs and the support department won't talk to you. Did BSD/OS
ever charge this much? I don't remember it.

(SuSE don't even have to make this OS available via ftp, although they are
good enough to and I have installed it that way.)

&gt; Bottom line: software under either licence permits *you* free and
&gt; unfettered use of the system.  Or put another way, a difference that
&gt; makes no difference is no difference. 

Most of the people who ultimately use this stuff are just as likely to say
"what's an operating system" or "do I need a computer with that?". License
debates are about as relevant to these people as discussions of the CPU's
molecular structure. "Why are you telling me this stuff? I'm a dentist and
I want to drill teeth. My Microsoft salesman doesn't tell me all this, he
just asks me to sign a purchase order!"
