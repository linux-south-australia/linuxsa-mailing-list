Hi Ben,
    From memory

a.     The DCOP issue is exactly that, delete the incorrect link and 
create a new one to the correct place

b. Links problem - if your not going to use KDE2.2 apps
    Then remove the duplicate entries and/or create links to them from 
bin to opt/kde3/bin

        - If you are still likely to boot to kde2
    Create an entry in /home/user/.kde3/share/config/something_rc (Can't 
remember the specific file) 
    add an entry changing the PATH to include /opt/kde3/bin as the first 
entry
eg export PATH=/opt/kde3/bin:$PATH
    This will allow most apps to start from the correct location, some 
apps with direct links may still need to have their own new shortcuts 
created.

c. Console link - remove from kicker(task bar and creatre a link on the 
desktop to /opt/kde3/bin/konsole)
    - apparently the startup on this causes a conflict otherwise

dcd
Best of luck, I found this cleaner and quicker than 2.2 with 
better/standardised keyboard support. The traditional problem of Numlock 
was finally fixed.

ps 9.0 rc3 doesn't need all the above, kde 3.0.3-2 is the default

&gt; hmm. i remember reading some stuff about that in the mandrake forums, 
&gt; it wasn't specifically related to this DCOP problem i thought though. 
&gt; if you've got the old solution there, would it be possible to dredge 
&gt; it up for me? that'd be much appreciated :)

&gt;&gt; Hi Ben,
&gt;&gt;    This is a known issue with the over install of KDE 3.0 onto 8.2
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure of the answer, but from memory it was something to do 
&gt;&gt; with setting the paths so that the new installation /opt/kde3 is 
&gt;&gt; called not kde ie the kde2.2 apps dont work on the kde3 desktop
&gt;&gt; The freeze time is the app trying to start but not getting the right 
&gt;&gt; xserver and libraries.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; eg. icon for kate needs to call /opt/kde3/bin/kate not etc/bin/kate
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; dcd
&gt;&gt; If you need more, I still have the old solution here somewhere.

&gt;&gt;&gt; hi all,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; i've recently installed mandrake 8.2, and installed KDE3 (v3.0.3, to 
&gt;&gt;&gt; be precise) on this box. when i log in to KDE3, after about 1-2 
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes, the panel freezes for about 5 minutes or so (haven't timed 
&gt;&gt;&gt; this stuff, just guessing at times). after the freeze, i get a 
&gt;&gt;&gt; message box titled "Kpanel - sorry", with the message "klauncher 
&gt;&gt;&gt; could not be contacted via DCOP". this then makes me unable to 
&gt;&gt;&gt; launch any stuff from the icons in the panel (such as control 
&gt;&gt;&gt; centre, etc.), and quite a few apps (such as, again, the KDE control 
&gt;&gt;&gt; centre) won't launch at all (just fail silently).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; installing KDE3 was the first thing i did to this box in terms of 
&gt;&gt;&gt; customization, i haven't changed anything else.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; can anyone help?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
