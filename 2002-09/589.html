I think people are overlooking a finer point in this Toshiba/MS issue. If 
the operating system was truly pre-installed you should not be asked to 
accept an EULA of a third party as the purchase of the computer should have 
taken care of this contractual arrangement. I would suggest that the OS is 
not actually pre-installed if the user has to accept a license agreement 
from the producer of the OS before they can use the computer functionally.

If we go back to the 1970's and 80's it was common for hardware to come 
bundle with an OS because it was written by/for the hardware manufacturer. 
PC DOS is a prime example. When supplied with an IBM it was PC DOS when 
sold for clones it was, of course, MS DOS. Perhaps Toshiba should be 
selling machines pre-installed with a Toshiba's version of an OS written by 
M$ then there would be no arguments. Even if it was only a re-badged OS. 
This would probably not make M$ happy because they want the name in every 
bodies face.

&gt; &gt; On a side note: any shops in Adelaide that sell laptops with no OS?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, there are several that I have heard of. Email me off list and we can
&gt;talk about it.
