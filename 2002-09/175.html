Hi,

I had only seen the Australian House of Representatives on TV once, and 
that was back when I was 21, probably 1992.
I used to watch Prime Minister's Question Time from the Brittish House 
of Commons every week on CSPAN (<A HREF="http://www.cspan.org">http://www.cspan.org</A>).  CSPAN is the 
U.S. version of the AU television channel you described. One week, the 
Brittish House was in recess, and so the Australian verision was played 
instead.

Although there was some entertainment value to it, I mostly watched the 
Brittish House of Commons to keep abreast of world events from a 
different perspective.

In the Brittish House, you used to have to submit the question ahead of 
time in writing. After the Prime Minister answered the first question, 
the member was allowed a follow up question that was related to the 
original question. What ended up happening was that all of the Ministers 
would ask the same open ended question in writing, such as to allow them 
to ask the real question at follow up: "What is the Prime Minister's 
Schedule Today?"

There was also a rule in which the Ministers were'nt allowed to ask 
follow up questions that were prepared in advance, and therefore, they 
were not allowed to read their question.

I found the following episode in the Brittish House of Commons 
entertaining however:

One time a Minister started to ask a question:

"I would like to ask...

***minister looks at paper to read***

***Entire House jeers 'READING!'****

...if the Prime Minister was aware...

***minister looks at paper to read***

***Entire House jeers 'READING!'****

...of the decline in the price of wool....

***minister looks at paper to read***

***Entire House jeers 'READING!'****

...and so on for about 30 seconds.


In the U.S., you will never hear the opposition party cheer and jeer as 
their leader takes the stage, because we don't really have a question 
time. Instead, the U.S. House is very dull, the speaker pro tempore will 
pound the gavel more to entertain himself than to tend to a group of 
people that really needs quieting. Its kind of like a library.

On the other hand, I was very impressed at the particularAustralian 
Question Time that I saw. ** I will probably embarass myself here, but 
there was something about the prime minister and the leader of the 
opposition being allies at one point and then going their separate 
ways....Mr. Hawke?? **

Anyway, a very spirited debate took place there, and I think that's good 
for democracy. I like the idea of a loyal opposition.

So in summary, I find both Brittian and Australia's legislature to be 
more spirited and democratic then the U.S's.

&gt;&gt;The House will come to order.

&gt;&gt;Members on my right will cease in objecting.

&gt;Hi James,
&gt;
&gt;I find it difficult to believe you spend your time watching "Order in the 
&gt;House" :)))  I know I do, but largely because the 'show' is broadcast by a 
&gt;station that has no commercials (if you exclude advertising of their own 
&gt;programming) & I just can't take a lot of advertisments while I try to work 
&gt;away. . . . . Yelling in parliament ? That' a quite a different mattter! ;)
&gt;
&gt;How does the Australian Parliament rate for entertainment value over there in 
&gt;the US ?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;
&gt;Andrew Lord

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;David, you need to get some sleep or something.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do I?
