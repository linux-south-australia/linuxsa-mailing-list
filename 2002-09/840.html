&gt; Well, technically IBM's JFS is far more mature. It was included with AIX
&gt; 3.0 which was released in 1990, and has been steadily improved ever

&gt; platform.

JFS2 has little to do with JFS1 except for the name. JFS2 came to Linux
from OS/2. So I don't think this is correct. In terms of Unix fs, XFS has
the longer pedigree and much better credibility (SGI has made a lot of
storage sales on the basis of their fs, not their OS.)

&gt; I also don't know why more people don't give it a go on Linux for this
&gt; very reason

I imagine most LinuxSA users can use any of the journalling filesystems
for small-scale use and find them all good. Unix pedigree doesn't count
for much if you're a casual home user.

The differences come in the tricky bits, either large file sizes or large
numbers of files, or ACLs, or modularity. When it comes to long-distance
planning Reiserfs4 wins by a long shot, unfortunately nobody knows yet if
it will ever work because there is nothing to see :-)
