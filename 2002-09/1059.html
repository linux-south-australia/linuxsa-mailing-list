&gt; I have been look at using IMAP with mostly Outlook and Outlook express

&gt; server can get quite large and I often get Sync errors when there is
&gt; reasonable amount of unread mail on the server.

&gt; have read the maildir seems more efficient and can handle more then one
&gt; connection for a client.

Several misunderstandings here. 

Firstly, although I would never recommend UW imapd, you can improve
performance significantly by configuring it to not use flat-format Unix
mail files at the backend (thus removing the single biggest reason for
using UW, which is having a common format with mail(1) and older mail
programs which can't read Maildir.) UW can't use Maildir but it can use a
couple of other formats which aren't that much different. However they are
pretty rare formats. Read the UW docco for more info.

Secondly, for a small site such as you describe, if you use modern
hardware the file storage format doesn't impact performance that much
unless you have larger-than-usual mail folders (perhaps gigabytes or
larger). Maildir's advantages for your sort of situation tend to be more
along the lines of predictability, reliability and ease of maintenance
than performance. From my deployment and testing experience I believe
Maildir is much superior in all cases compared to flat Unix format, but at
these sizes I do not think performance is the deciding factor.

Thirdly, whatever you do at the server end you will have some problems
with Microsoft mail clients anyway. Microsoft mail clients manage to have
problems with their own private folder format too so it isn't limited to
IMAP, but just be cautious before blaming problems on your IMAP server.
Its a good idea to have a copy of the Mozilla IMAP client around to check
against. In fact the Mozilla client is so good that often Windows users
are happy to switch to it instead, depending on what their needs are.

As a general comment, Maildir is by no means a Qmail speciality. Maildir
(and the Courier enhancement, Maildir++) is very widely supported. In MTAs
you have Postfix and Exim as well, and many MUAs from mutt to Evolution to
KMail etc (any any IMAP-capable MUA via Courier.)

I find Courier an excellent product although the documentation is somewhat
lacking.
