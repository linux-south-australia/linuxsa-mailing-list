Let's get real - how many of us "computer obsessed persons" need a reason to
interfere (play) with a computer system that is running OK well nearly!!!
and make it a bit better???

Would the fridge ever work as it was designed after we forgot to read the
manual???

Subject: OT: Net enabled devices (was Re: selling items on this newsgroup?)


&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     Unless you can get some sort of useful information from
&gt; the device, what do you need a net enabled refrigerator for?
&gt; I know that a large American soft drink manufacturer has
&gt; many of it's vending machines online to gather info about
&gt; when they have to be refilled, but this provides actual
&gt; sales data from how many cans of what type were sold etc.
&gt; This particular idea came originally from MIT (bless 'em) in
&gt; the 70's when the students wanted to know if the MIT machine
&gt; had their favourite drink in it before they trudged down the
&gt; hall to get one. To be honest, why would the average home
&gt; need a net enabled fridge? What possible use could the
&gt; number of times the door is opened and for how long be of
&gt; use to a manufacturer after the initial data collection
&gt; period to allow for design of later models. The same with
&gt; how many ice cubes are dispensed.
&gt;
&gt;     Lets move on to other household devices: Toasters. Don't
&gt; laugh I have heard of some manufacturer wishing to build
&gt; such a device. Why! If the average household has two adults
&gt; and 2.3 kids and each eats 1.4 slices of toast per day this
&gt; is about 6 slices of toast per day. O.K. the average family
&gt; sets the toaster between level 2 (light) to level 7 (dark).
&gt; This useless data (probably wrong anyhow as I am making it
&gt; up) could be collected using other methods quite easily over
&gt; a lesser period of time (by survey perhaps). I ask again,
&gt; after an initial data collection period, what possible use
&gt; is it to have these devices connected to the net?
&gt;
&gt;     After my initial bitch about why, I will move onto how.
&gt; How are these devices connected to the net anyhow. O.K. they
&gt; have some kind of network interface, but what is it
&gt; connected to? If it is some kind of wireless interface, will
&gt; it:
&gt;     a. Irradiate my food?
&gt;     b. Irradiate me?
&gt;     c. Leave my fridge open to a cyber criminal attack? This
&gt; really does bring a whole new meaning to the word SPAM!
&gt;
&gt;     O.K. jokes aside, If you don't own a computer but buy
&gt; one of these hi tech devices what DO you hook it up to. Will
&gt; it use IPv4 or IPv6? Another interesting question with the
&gt; diminishing number of IP addresses in the world. I really
&gt; can't see any use for this stuff realistically. Just because
&gt; you CAN do something, why do for the sake of it. I don't
&gt; think I will bother spending the extra for a net interface
&gt; on my next microwave oven. Anyhow, I leave it up to you guys
&gt; to chat about.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;(i.e. you can't sell refrigerators... unless they run
&gt; Linux)
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dont laugh... LG are working on this :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I saw the LG web-enabled refrigerator in KL in July.
&gt; Pretty stupid,
&gt; &gt; in my opinion.  I'd much rather sit when on-line (and the
&gt; screen on
&gt; &gt; the 'fridge is at standing height.)
