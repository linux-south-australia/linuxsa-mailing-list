David,

&gt; I cut and paste into mutt and sent the email anyway but I
&gt; don't see how they'll get my details
&gt;
I had to do the same because my mail reader would not work.

I have long had a beef with the providers of this site. For all the 
years they have run the event they have never seen fit to make the site 
anywhere near accessible. Last year was a shocker with all navigation 
based on graphics, so if you ran without graphics then you had no way 
to get into the site. They also ran a striped background that would 
have been a nightmare to read for somebody with visual impairments. 
Clever stuff I don't think. 

They are supposed to represent an event that puts forward the IT 
industry of South Australia and my feeling is that their web site 
should reflect that high level of creativity, ability and design. 

Maybe I am the only one that feels this way &lt;sigh&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
