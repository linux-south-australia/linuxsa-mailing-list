Michael et al,

&gt; Ok, so it's on slashdot and you'll all read it there, but I'll still let you
&gt; all know that XFS[1] has finally made it to the official linux kernel at
&gt; version 2.5.36.

I've been using XFS since pre-version 1.0.

&gt; [2] Now I just want 2.6 to come out and be included as standard in mainline
&gt; distros - don't want much really :)

Mandrake 8.2 has XFS support enabled in its kernels. All RedHat releases
from 6.2 simply need another Anaconda (installer) and Kernel ISO to have
XFS as one's root partition but they're not officially supported by
RedHat. In fact, I suspect the only major distributor that have
attemmpted to ignore XFS are RedHat (1).

As one poster pointed out:

***
XFS supports ACL's (or access control lists) which are much better than
standard UNIX permissions.

XFS is an extent based filesystem which means that you don't end up
wasting tons of space having to allocate a 4K block for every small
file. And you don't need to jump through tons of indirect blocks to get
large files.

XFS allocated inodes on the fly so it grows with what data you put on
there. Once again, not wasting space up front. And it sticks the inode
near the file itself so the head does not have to move far on the hard
drive.

XFS supports extended attributes which can be used for all kinds of
extensions later on.

XFS has been around since 1994 and is the most mature of the journalling
filesystems.
***

...the implementation of XFS-Linux and XFS-Irix used to be similar
however I'm not sure how similar they are now. Part of the reason why
Linus wouldn't let XFS into 2.4 was because SGI chose to implement some
of their own VM and other matters to keep the Irix/SGI compatability.
It's slowly been fixed but I'm not sure how that leaves the two
implementations.

XFS and ext2 support ACLs, but XFS ACLs. Actually, although they are
called ACLs I tend to just think of them as EFIBs (Extra File
Information Bits). XFS fully supports the Unix user, group and other
pieces of information. The XFS ACLs, to my knowledge, are POSIX
compliant. And xfsdump does back them upo correctly.

XFS is extent based but I don't think it supports any block sizes other
than 4K at the moment. I've seen no evidence that XFS will pack smaller
files into a 4K block.

You specify how much of your filesystem you want as inodes at mkfs.xfs
time. The default is 25%. I have a nasty suspicion you can't reclaim
inodes once used (I recall seeing that on the XFS mailing list).

If you want a journalling filesystem that's quite happy dealing with
terabytes of data (provided your underlying OS can cope) then XFS is
what you need. There are too many benchmarks (eg <A HREF="http://www.namesys.com/">http://www.namesys.com/</A>
which is actually ReiserFS's page) which indicate that ext2/ext3 aren't
the most efficient, speed-wise. Whilst you may think that the extra
journaling might make your filesystem go slower, I've never noticed the
difference.

I probably should note that XFS still suffers from the "I'm going to
take a million years to delete lots and lots of little files syndromes".
Given that it was produced by a company whose main desire was to create
a stable filesystem which could cope with huge files and provide
sustainable IO -- in Irix XFS you can set a filesystem to *guarantee*
you precisely xyz bits per second provided your underlying hardware can
give xyz bits per second -- for people like film makers.

I just happen to have the XFS 2.4.18 sources just lying about; I could
bring them to the next meeting on some CD's if people want.
