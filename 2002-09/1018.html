&gt; I think it's absolutely important for Computer Scientists to have an overall 
&gt; understanding of whole system works.  (In fact, the broader and deeper your 
&gt; knowledge the better you are no matter what the area).

Agreed.

&gt; 
&gt; Often the deeper and broader your understanding the better you can solve
&gt; problems or understand why something works or doesn't.  I don't know how 
&gt; many times I've had to explain to programmers that physics somehow limits 
&gt; their expectations of infinite bandwidth from disk! 
&gt; Having an understanding of Maths (in particular as someone noted: Numerical
&gt; Methods/Analysis, Logic, etc) is very important.  So many things go wrong
&gt; because people don't understand some of this stuff.  (eg. Patriot Missles in
&gt; Israel in the Gulf war would have worked better if the coders had done
&gt; NM/NA).  (Do you know why the online tax calculator on the ATO website gives 
&gt; you a different result than calculating it via the tax tables?)
&gt; 

Agreed.

&gt; Basically what I'm saying is:
&gt; - the broader and deeper your understanding of more things the better you 
&gt; are at solving problems.
&gt; - sometimes the actual subject is not the important thing, sometimes 
&gt; (mostly) it's acquiring more mental tools to solve problems.
&gt; - many advances in science are caused by crossdisplinary approaches.
&gt; 
Agreed.

&gt; I'm sick of people saying "I'm doing Computing so I only need to know about 
&gt; computing stuff".  You learn mentals tools at uni.  How to think, what to 
&gt; think about, how to break problems up, how to solve them.   Maths helps you 
&gt; do this better.  Heck, Psychology helps you do this too.  (one of the 
&gt; fathers of the internet came, as many did, from Psychology).
&gt; 

This statement lets down the rest of your post.  Maths and Psychology 
_can_ help problem solving, as can rebuilding then engine in your car. 
But I don't see that as a required element of the BSc in CS degree.

I personally hate advanced maths (even more so because I was forced to 
do it at uni), and by the time I got to uni I had had enough of it, 
luckilly 1st year Maths was just a repeat of Maths 1&2 at yr 12. Doing 
SVC did nothing to help me improve my CS because, as in your next point, 
I put _no_ effort into it. I got more useful education out of going to 
the tav and playing pool than I did doing SVC. My point is if you are 
doing a CS major then it should be based on CS stuff. The other optional 
topics you take should be _optional_, so that you can choose ones that 
you will get the most out of. My problem solving skills, while studying 
SVC went solely into passing the subject while doing the least amount 
possible because it numbed my mind so. Some of us have different 
aptitudes than others and mine is most definately not in maths. I have a 
passible knowledge, where I find it useful to what I do.

_I_ am sick of being told to study something I find boring, and that I 
can see no immediate use for. If I can't use it I wont remember it. I 
would much rather hone my problem solving skills solving problems I have 
some interest in.

&gt; Also, to finish my rant:
&gt; - On the whole students at uni learn what THEY want to learn based on the 
&gt; time they put in, how interested they are and what course/subjects they do.
&gt; - Some people cruise through and the course barely makes a ripple on their 
&gt; brain.
&gt; - Some people do extra reading, extra work, extra research on their own 
&gt; time.
&gt; - Some people just have a better natural ability in certain areas
&gt; 
&gt; - Subsequently out of all courses you get very good students and crap ones.
&gt; - It's ultimately a personal choice.
&gt; 
&gt; University is about learning and stretching your brain.  It's not about 
&gt; being spoon fed.  
&gt; 

Precisely, let me do a CS major. This implies I want to do CS subjects 
as the core and then I can choose what else I do to fill out the 
remaining units. (If I wanted Ma&CS I would have done what you did :) )
