I think some people have a very narrow view of what's relevant.

I think it's absolutely important for Computer Scientists to have an overall 
understanding of whole system works.  (In fact, the broader and deeper your 
knowledge the better you are no matter what the area).

Often the deeper and broader your understanding the better you can solve
problems or understand why something works or doesn't.  I don't know how 
many times I've had to explain to programmers that physics somehow limits 
their expectations of infinite bandwidth from disk! 
Having an understanding of Maths (in particular as someone noted: Numerical
Methods/Analysis, Logic, etc) is very important.  So many things go wrong
because people don't understand some of this stuff.  (eg. Patriot Missles in
Israel in the Gulf war would have worked better if the coders had done
NM/NA).  (Do you know why the online tax calculator on the ATO website gives 
you a different result than calculating it via the tax tables?)

Basically what I'm saying is:
- the broader and deeper your understanding of more things the better you 
are at solving problems.
- sometimes the actual subject is not the important thing, sometimes 
(mostly) it's acquiring more mental tools to solve problems.
- many advances in science are caused by crossdisplinary approaches.

I'm sick of people saying "I'm doing Computing so I only need to know about 
computing stuff".  You learn mentals tools at uni.  How to think, what to 
think about, how to break problems up, how to solve them.   Maths helps you 
do this better.  Heck, Psychology helps you do this too.  (one of the 
fathers of the internet came, as many did, from Psychology).

Also, to finish my rant:
- On the whole students at uni learn what THEY want to learn based on the 
time they put in, how interested they are and what course/subjects they do.
- Some people cruise through and the course barely makes a ripple on their 
brain.
- Some people do extra reading, extra work, extra research on their own 
time.
- Some people just have a better natural ability in certain areas

- Subsequently out of all courses you get very good students and crap ones.
- It's ultimately a personal choice.

University is about learning and stretching your brain.  It's not about 
being spoon fed.

&gt; Yes, maths is important to comp sci, but I have yet to see what SVC has 
&gt; to do with the science of computing, maybe at the silicon level? But 
&gt; that is the territory of Computer System / Electrical Engineers. Binary 
&gt; logic is the basis of computing, and it is taught in computing subjects, 
&gt; not mathematics. As for job qualifications, I am happy that I was taught 
&gt; C++ (amongst a multitude of others) in my BSc rather than VB in an IT 
&gt; degree, and because I learned as much (or more) about how programming 
&gt; languages work as I did about using a particular language, I am better 
&gt; equipped to quickly be able to code in a language I have never seen before.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Biology is just applied chemistry;  Chemistry and Engineering are just
&gt; &gt; applied physics.  Physics and computer science are just applied
&gt; &gt; mathematics.  Maths is at the root of all the sciences.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it is, but how much pure mathematics does an everyday applied 
&gt; biologist use? This is like saying to use a 4GL language you need to 
&gt; have an in depth understanding of the physics of the silicon that your 
&gt; program will run on. Abstraction is a wonderful thing :)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Designing algorithms is an aspect of applied mathematics;  that's
&gt; &gt; what Computer Scientists do.  Writing software to efficiently and
&gt; &gt; correctly implement algorithms which someone else has designed is
&gt; &gt; what Bachelor of IT graduates do :-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No applied mathematics is what applied mathematitians do :)
