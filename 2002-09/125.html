&gt; Japanese) rather than have to put up with listening to rapper clap trap.

She's probably not aware that Ali G was (and arguably still is) satirical of,
rather than supporting of that particular culture. That doesn't excuse the
terrible movie he made though.

&gt; I don't think I have any particular difficulty expressing myself. I'm
&gt; not entirely certain that Rob does either, although I don't cope with
&gt; difficult to understand questions. 

I really don't want to get into this argument, but no-one else has mentioned
this:
You don't HAVE to reply to every message. If you don't understand it, don't
reply! People who do understand can reply. If no-one replies at all, the
poster will realise s/he has to put more effort into the question.
