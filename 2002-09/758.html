I think the general consensus is to run Squid if you have a fast machine
with adequate resources and bandwidth usage to lose sleep over (18/c / MB
ever 16 seconds or so @ 512 / kb/s! - maybe around $30 / hr with a good site
connection! Forgive me if I math is skewed - what ARE the correct figures to
estimate cost?).

I have a laptop @ 1.7GHz (1.2GHz on battery) with 512MB DDR RAM - I think
Squid would be a good option?

I had no idea that only small files were cached!!!!  I am turning on Squid
as soon as I get home.

Any volunteers for a talk on Squid - at a *very* basic level for the
non-technically inclined or newly initiated?

I can even bring in my laptop and rig it up to the projector and volunteer
it as a demonstration unit..

Andrew,

&gt; &gt; It doesn't remember all of the pictures I download.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not? Isn't that what it's supposed to do?

They probably have no cache set. It's weird, but I know it doesn't.

Also, I have tuned my squid cache to save anything up to 0.5Mb of a
download and I suspect that Mozilla and Netscape may only cache things
less than 4Kb. If you turne a cache to save huge files it will slow it
down [because it needs to search more of its cache to find if the object
exists] but it will also save you from getting stuff from the Internet.
I have a slow connection, but a fast squid...it's much more beneficial
to me to spend time searching my squid caches than download stuff at
0.8kb (icck) per second.

&gt; What i am saying is that if both squid and your browser get the data
(which
&gt; it had cached) from the same place (be it memory or a filesystem) then
there
&gt; should be no speed difference.

What I'm saying is they are different things, with different codes. Also
squid is much more tunable.
