&gt; Most of the students at TV-TAFE wouldn't bother about attempting to
&gt; crack the systems, but would rather study towards their course or play
&gt; FreeCiv because the materials being presented was too easy. Steve
&gt; Donaldson has already pointed out getting too strict with security could
&gt; impact learning, or "leaning" as he put it.
&gt;
&gt; We need to remember that a system is NOT secure if it's NOT useable. If
&gt; it's so SECURE it's UNUSABLE then people WILL find a way to use the
&gt; system which often exposes them to more security flaws. If they can't
&gt; find a way around the security then your system is UNUSABLE which is a
&gt; wholly different concept to NOT SECURE.


Heh, back when I was studying at Regency, the idiots over (don't know
whether it was the ITS that did it or EDS) there decided to block the
download of all .exe and .zip files... it lasted for about half a day, till
enough people complained about the fact that students could no longer use
search engines that ended in .exe lines, could not download example files,
etc, etc, etc.

They had port 53 wide open on their firewall for quite a while, I used to
run my pop3 and smtp over it from one of my linux servers, then they closed
it... so I then went to tunneling it through https!
