But DSL,
    You forgot to mention the results of
man -k man

Which ends up with a lot of references to manipulation.

    Perhaps, it's right, there seems to be a great deal of effort being 
spent to manipulate this thread into a meaningless, almost derogative 
spiel, instead of discussing a valid point. However, not that it's a 
redeeming feature for those involved, they are not alone. They are doing 
a great job of emulating their compadre's using MShaft.
     Speaking with some women, who have worked in the industry and are 
currently updating their skills doing a course at Spherion. Patron's of 
MS are leaps and bounds ahead of you in their ability to denigrate, or 
obscure the possibility that women may have the ability to contribute. 
Unless of course it's to do Data entry.
    Think about it, be encouraging, I'm not saying that a bit of fun 
can't be had. I am saying, that the fun shouldn't be focussed on the 
person the mail came from. (Unless it's DSL, there's exception to every 
rule). 

    The point, perhaps there would be a greater uptake of linux, by all, 
if the reception to user groups focussed discussing the point the person 
is trying to make, and generally being helpful.

-q- Mmmm! Why are more women involved in reports to helpdesks, could it 
be that there are more women users?
-r- Nah! I worked in a place where there were all male users, and they'd 
never admit they had a problem.
-q- So, they still had as many problems?
-r- Nuh! We just had substandard hardware, we could always find a fault 
with it.
