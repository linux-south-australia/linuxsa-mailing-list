It's commercial, but he asked nicely, and it might be interesting to some of
you (besides you can win a Zaurus :-)

BTW, if you want to sell your Zaurus, let me know :-)

Hello. I got this address off of the SVLUG site as a contact for questions. I am with Sun Microsystems and am organizing three upcoming Bay Area technical briefings on Sun's Linux strategy and our new line of Linux products. I think that these briefings may be of interest to members of your group. I was wondering if there is an appropriate way to notify your group about these events. If you could direct me to someone who may be able to give me permission to post the invite, or if you'd simply
like to forward the invite below to whomever you think may be interested, I'd greatly appreciate it. My contact info is below if you have any questions.

Thanks and best regards.

Steven
