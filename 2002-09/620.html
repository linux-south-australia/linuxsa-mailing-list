Quoting <A HREF="mailto:davidn@rebel.net.au">davidn@rebel.net.au</A>:

&gt; &gt; Toshi laptop can run with Microsoft 95/98/SE/ME/2K/XP or else it can
&gt; &gt; probably run with RH or Manduck or SuSE or OS/2 or a number of other OS
&gt; &gt; packages.
&gt; 
&gt; Who says it can?  Toshiba apparently don't say that.  I claim that a new
&gt; Ford can run on aviation fuel.  Should I be able to demand that Ford sell
&gt; me one sans catalytic converter?

If driving a car in Australia without a catalytic converter were legal, 
perhaps.  A better case you'd have if there were millions of Ford owners who 
were replacing the manufacturer-fitted catalytic converter with an alternative 
legal, and better performing one.

Are you suggesting that a component of a car engine is equivalent to an 
operating system of a computer?  I would have thought that an OS was less 
entangled to a computer than a catalytic converter was to a car engine was to a 
car [Perhaps the bundling of IE in Windows being bundled with a laptop is a 
better use of your analogy - except that a lot of people don't want IE or 
Windows, but a car purchaser would almost always want an engine].

Also to note that the manufacturers of catalytic converters haven't (AFAIK) 
been convicted of using illegal tactics to ensure Ford only sells cars with 
it's particular catalytic converter.

Woffle woffle woffle,
