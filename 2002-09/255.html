&gt; &gt; I don't know how many of us have read "One of Us" by Michael Marshall-Smith,
&gt; &gt; but I quite liked the AI white-goods in that. well, and the rest of the book
&gt; &gt; too.
&gt; 
&gt; I remember reading an Analog story years ago about appliance AIs that
&gt; were based on human personalities, and therefore could be right bastards.
&gt; I vaguely remember an elevator abusing its occupants, a vending machine
&gt; that was an ambulance chaser-type lawyer hanging around outside a
&gt; hospital, and an answering machine that kept throwing away messages.
&gt; Anything like that?

Pretty much.. the guy has an answering machine that sulks, a loyal alarm clock
with an annoying defect, bribes door locks, interrogates a food processor, and
at one point gets saved by a kamikaze duo consisting of a fridge and chest
freezer because the alarm said he was an alright guy.

He's wanted by the police because he has someone else's memory of a murder,
and his ex-grandparents live on in a cheap low-res end of the internet.. you
kinda get the idea by now.

Go read it though, along with 'Only Forwards' by the same author.. Both
brilliant little novels.

I'd lend you the books, except I've already lent them to other ppl.. who lent
to other ppl.. and i haven't got them back yet ;(
