&gt; What sits on the server, and rips all this stuff apart into an easy to

I haven't ever looked at the tool that you mentioned, so I may be completely off here, but I'm sure that a lot of what you want can be achieved through your packet filtering rules on your nat box. Under FreeBSD, I think you can do a "count" on any packet that matches a pattern you specify (port 80, source IP address is machine X). Just create a bunch of these rules (most of which could be automated) and you've got yourself a list of which machines have been doing what.

Now, to get the report you want (and let's face it, "canned" reports *never* have all of the info that we want), you could just pass it through a simple perl/python/php/shell/awk script and have it output something you want to read (text, HTML, whatever). Hell, you could even import the data into an Excel spreadsheet (ahem, I mean gnumeric) and have it turn it into a report.

There's probably stacks of articles around on how to do this under most platforms, but daemonnews.org and bsdtoday.com would probably be good freebsd places to look.

If that doesn't do what you're after, try doing a search on freshmeat.net.
 
&gt; Should I change to WinNT and install Microsoft Internet Acceleration
&gt; Server, because it includes reporting I might be able to use? ;)

If you think it's the right tool for the job. Whether it does the whole job suitably is a discussion for a differnet list. :-)
