Ahh yes. Ive been looking for an official mention of this. I still cant
see an exclusion for encoders/decoders, but I did find this:

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/emd.html&gt">http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/emd.html&gt</A>;

"Note: No license is needed for private, non-commercial activities
(e.g., home-entertainment, receiving broadcasts and creating a personal
music library), not generating revenue or other consideration of any
kind or for entities with an annual gross revenue less than US$ 100
000.00."

Its unclear if this means just storing mp3s, and for free streaming as
it is in the footer under streaming, and there is no exclusion on the
software applications page. It would really be nice of them to put a
clear mention for free software encoders and decoders.

According to this page:
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mp3licensing.com/help/developer.html&gt">http://www.mp3licensing.com/help/developer.html&gt</A>;

I cant see an exclusion for free encoders/decoders. There is an
exclusion for non-commercial storage of mp3s, and exclusions for
non-commercial streaming, however there is none for software encoding.
So how do you stream content for free if you cant encode it prior to
sending it off?

I emailed them and asked what the situation was last time this came up,
but they never replyed. I guess they realiase if free encoders are free,
then people wont buy the commercial ones, so there will be no point
making commercial ones and paying the royalties.

&gt; Only for commercial software and hardware.. free source are apparently exempt from the fee. I suspect we may see the end of mp3 format anyway.

&gt; &gt; Audio streaming. Its the linux version if winamp's shoutcast. Im pretty
&gt; &gt; sure if you use mp3 (which technically you need to pay royaltees for,
&gt; &gt; but Im yet to hear of a bust) it should be compatable with winamp for
&gt; &gt; the windows users as well.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Sydney. They play a diverse range of music and stream in to the Net,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in Windows Media and Apple (quicktime ?) Here they respond to my mail re
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the need for a Linux compatible stream. I am pleased that they got back.
