If you are a bookkeeper or perhaps a chartered accountant that works 
with small businesses, you have probably been forced to buy each and 
every upgrade/version of Quickbooks each year. Using the Quickbooks 
backup can be a real cost/time saver. What gets annoying is if your 
client has Quickbooks 2002 and you only have 2001, you have to go out 
and buy 2002 to read their data, and that's roughly $250 US. Appgen 
costs $90 US, is made by accountants and offers a 30% discount to them, 
in the hope that they will spread the word. (I know I will...have..doh! 
:-) )

Anyway, I don't appreciate having my arm twisted, so I came up with a 
few different methods that has allowed us to not have to buy Quickbooks 
Pro 2002 so far this year. This is what we do in order of preference:

1. If the client uses Quicken, we ask them to export their data as a QIF 
file. Gnucash & Moneydance can import that type of file. Not true for 
Quickbooks Pro, AFAIK.

2. So when we get a client's Quickbooks backup file, we restore it with 
our older version of Quickbooks Slow. It will fail right at the end 
saying that you need the new version of their product, Quickbooks Slower.

What bites, is that you have to reboot, and you actually have to endure 
a moment with Windows to convert the file in Appgen, as only the Windows 
version can convert it. Be sure that before you reboot that you read the 
instructions that come up when you go to "file/import from Quickbooks" 
they are very clear.

 After running the conversion you have to make a Apgen generated 
Quickbooks import file for Linux. Unfortunately the next step is not 
clear. The quickbooks file is not imported automatically as stated in 
the instructions.  Instead you have to get the file  from where it is 
placed.  Being able to mount other file systems comes in handy here if 
you dual boot like I do.

(There is one thing I didn't mention about the Apgen install. It will go 
exactly as they say it will in the instructions, except that the program 
will install and place the icon on root's desktop, and the program at 
this point can only be run by root at the shell, unless you modify some 
permissions. The 'monkey method' is to log in as root, right click on 
/usr/appgen, select properties, and change the owner from root to 
yourself/users.)

Once you grab the data, you are golden, until you try to print.  The 
Program's printing really sucks in Linux unless you use Latex.

LaTeX...for everybody.

I just learned this today....and I am still going to use LyX. Basically 
this is what you do to get a readable report nothing fancy:

1. Print your report to file in Appgen.

2. Open the file with your favorite text editor and add the following to 
the very top of the document:

\documentclass[8pt,letterpaper]{book}                                 
(&lt;----Note AU may use A4 instead of letterpaper)
\special{papersize=11in,8.5in}                                           
    (&lt;---If the print does not need to be landscape, loose this line)
\oddsidemargin -1.25in                                                   
        (odd and even page number left margins...I had about 1.5 in 
empty/and off prior)
\evensidemargin -1.25 in
\begin{document}                                                         
           (&lt;---means what it says)
\begin{verbatim}                                                         
             (&lt;----keep as is)

Anything you put here literally will print as it is formatted already 
(mostly due to spacing)  Fortunately, my  ASCII text file from Apgen's 
trial balance is space delimited. Basicvly means, the data is already in 
in neat rows for you.

\end{verbatim}
\end{document}


After adding this stuff, save the file as whatever you want to call it 
and type the following commands in the shell...

1. latex name-of-tex-file-you-just-made   example:  latex qbslow.tex

2. dvips name-of-tex-file-you-just-made.dvi | lpr -d 
name-of-tex-file-you-just-made.dvi -t landscape
(loose landscape if not desired as landscape print out)

example:  latex qbslow.dvi | lpr -d qbslow.dvi -t landscape

3. cat /path/to/file/qbslow.ps | lpr

By magic, you have a nicely readable print out.

Who wants to make the shell scripts to automate... :-) ??
