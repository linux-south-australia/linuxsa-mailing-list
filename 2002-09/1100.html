But then you have to maintain yet another set of ACLs, as opposed to just
continuing to use Posix ACLs on your filesystem with Maildir++. 

The Cyrus way works and is very well suited to some uses, but my feeling
is that these uses are rapidly diminishing in number now that there are
widely-implemented and fairly standard ways of doing all the things that
Cyrus does. Back when Cyrus started (and on the OS that CMU was using for
performance and stability reasons) PAM was young and wobbly, and ACLs were
not particularly standardised or well-supported, and IMAP clients didn't
have all the cleverness that they do now.

And as to the DB side of things, using a database of any sort for this job
brings restrictions with it and in a mailstore situation this tends to
happen quicker than in some others. You can't easily split or extend a
mailstore in a db (as opposed to using something like ln with Maildir++),
you can't process mail offline for admin purposes (eg scanning for viruses
retrospectively), you can't point standard Unix tools at the mail, and you
can't interpret the same data in non-mail ways (eg export it as a
filesystem or a web page.) Then there's performance, because a database
imposes at least a 5x performance overhead as compared with raw filesystem
access and very large BASE64 files do not lend themselves to a DB at
all.

In practice the worst problems are functionality not scaling. CMU cope
with over 100k Cyrus mailboxes (a couple of years ago they were seeing
peaks of 15k simultaneous users as I remember) on pretty big Suns. This
means that the undeniable scaling problems I point out don't kick in until
you have a lot of users providing you have a good hardware budget. (One
commercial IMAP author I know has to ensure that their server can handle 1
million mailboxes as a minimum starting point, with hundreds of thousands
concurrently. You can forget the notion of a relational database for this
:-)

I'm sorry the IMSP protocol never really took off though.
