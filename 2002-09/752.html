&gt; I will only have one machine though - but it could still be useful.

It's not so much the number of machines, as the number of users. If you have family or friends (or voices) that have their own logins, a caching proxy like squid will probably help.

&gt; Perhaps this can be the topic of a talk - how to use squid, caches, etc to
&gt; minimise bandwidth use - on single machines or small home networks?

Are you volunteering? :-)  Caching is really only one area that squid rocks. Things like reverse transparent proxying can be great for stopping web server-based worms (no matter what the web server operating system is) without losing much / anything in performance.

&gt; How did they reduce their network use by 3/4?  Is there any apparently
&gt; degradation in service to the end user (out of date pages, etc)?

Like I said, one of the major factors is the type of use. In this case, it was a school. Most of their internet usage was the same page being accessed 30 students at a time. At that time, they were also doing a pretty reasonable job at picking mostly static pages for the students, instead of dynamic ones (which don't usually get cached).

So, depending on what you're using the 'net for, you may get a huge number of cache hits or you may get none. It's more than likely that you'll end up with something being cached and that's probably going to help.

David Lloyd mentioned that his proxy cache was fuller than his browser caches. This can be caused by a number of things:

 *  Many browsers (by default) expire things from the cache earlier than squid does (by default).
 *  More than one user on a particular machine. Each browser usually stores it's cache somewhere under the user's home directory.


Hope it helps,
Matt
