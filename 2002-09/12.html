&gt; Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone used a Likom 17in monitor?  What's the picture quality like?  Are
&gt; they any good?  I know that typically you get what you pay for, and these
&gt; things seem to be dirt cheap.  I'm looking for a decent monitor due to
&lt;snip&gt;

You really do tend to get what you pay for with monitors, and they're one of
the few things where:
* A bad one will damage your health. (I wish i hadn't used very nasty monitors
  years ago)
* A good one will last for a long time, unlike other hardware.

It's really worth spending the money to get something good, and then fiddling
with refresh rates, colours, resolutions, and font sizes, to get something
that works for you. Think of it as an investment in still having decent
eyesight in 10 years time. The difference in price between a cheap monitor and
a good monitor is probably only about as much as a single pair of glasses and
optometrists visit anyway.

You don't neccessarily have to spend big bucks on a Sony - Some of the other
brands are OK too. Watch out, because even the good brand names have
cheap-and-nasty monitors too.. There's often two or three monitors in the same
size from one manufacturer, but with big price differences.

Look for the specs, and go for something with a small dot pitch, high refresh
rates, high resolution, good colour accuracy, stability, etc.

Even if you don't intend on running at the maximum refresh and resolution,
high values here usually imply better quality at the lower rates.

Also, be aware there are two types of 'flat screen', one is done with a grille
like the Sony Trinitrons, the other sort is done with interesting arrangements
of internally curved glass and is cheaper. It can also make your eyes feel a
bit funny since I think it might make the screen look flat, but yet vary the
focus distance twice as much as a normal screen.

So, to recap - go out and buy a good 17 or 19 inch monitor brand new
that has an aperture grille, supports high res and high refresh rates, and has
a small dot pitch. Expect to pay $600++; i doubt your boss will appreciate
your choice, but hey, its all tax deductible.
