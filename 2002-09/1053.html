Ian,

&gt; Red Hat is more secure too right? 

You can build a good house out of plain dirt, water and straw. You can
build a bad house out of bricks and steel. You can, if you really try,
make Smoothwall and IPCop totally insecure. You could also make OpenBSD
totally insecure although you'd probably have to make a concious
decision to do so.

My advice?

a) stick with a distribution you are comfortable with
b) stick with tools you are comfortable with OR
c) make sure you understand the tools you will use by reading, asking
questions and experimentation

&gt; My housemate also wants to use my old
&gt; computer - so I was thinking of setting it up running VMWare permanently in
&gt; one console for MS Word, etc - I know it is not a good idea (until I can get
&gt; another machine I can dedicate to firewall tasks) but would an old PIII 450
&gt; with 512MB RAM handle firewall / caching and running VMWare through IceWM?

If you were setting up a business gateway or firewall, I would counsel
you not to run any extra crud -- including X itself -- on it. Because
you're not, I'd suggest you set such a machine up, it won't hurt, and
see what performance you get.

When you get your box up, you might want to talk to someone on IRC
(irc.openprojects.net) and get them to port scan you to see how your
firewall is standing up.

&gt; I think I will do it with Red Hat - that is more stable than Mandrake too I
&gt; hear - and I keep Mandrake for the desktop / GUI stuff.

All distributions have their good and bad points, RedHat included.
