This might be leaping to a conclusion.

The major issue with CS courses at the moment is the sheer size
of the topic -- and I mean the topic of Computer Science not of
Information Technology.

Although requiring some math might be useful, I've found that
the math taught at the 1/2 level isn't particularly useful for
CS.  The useful math -- say numerical analysis and queuing
theory -- isn't taught until the later years of maths degrees
and then often in optional subjects.  Some relevant topics, such
as the special qualities of modulo bases or the properties of
self-similar distributions, aren't covered in standard math
courses at all.

So there's a lot of rationale to a pure CS degree that teaches
the few areas of math required as part of the CS coursework.
The traditional CS degree did this with other subjects, for
example, statistics, digital electronics and project management.

I'm not saying that Adelade Uni's CS degree has made this choice.
Just that a traditional CS degree that does not require 1/2 level
math subjects need not be unreasonable.
