&gt; Well,
&gt; 
&gt; I finally managed to get FreeBSD V4.6 up onto the Internet (thanks to
&gt; Ben Close who leant me the CD with XFree86 packages). It feels almost
&gt; like home except I can't mount most of my Linux stuff because I use
&gt; XFS and that's not part of FreeBSD to my knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; A few "newbie" and maybe some "advanced" questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Are there any known comparisons between FreeBSD's handling of
&gt;    TCP/IP networking between Linux and FreeBSD? Specifically, comparisons
&gt;    on speed, efficiency and reasonably unbiased?

I think Richard Sharpe already mentioned that they compare quite well. This wasn't the case 12-18 months ago (Linux was way behind), but they're both quite good now. The Linux kernel has a number of really cool features that the BSDs don't, but for what most people need, FreeBSD is fine.

&gt; 2) Just how compatible is the compatibility binary layer? I've got
&gt;    Netscape 4.79 running under it quite nicely, but I am sort of
&gt;    wondering whether I could port some of the XFS material into
&gt;    FreeBSD and at the same time document XFS while I go at it.

The binary compatibility stuff (as far as I'm aware) is for user land apps. Given that most of the XFS stuff is implemented in kernel land, you should probably start reading up on the FreeBSD VFS layer and brush up on those C skills.

&gt; 3) Is there anyone local such as Netcraft who sells prepackaged
&gt;    FreeBSD stuff? My ISP is just too slow to cope with the ports
&gt;    collection, which incidentallly, is why I'm not a debian user.

Are you talking about the distfiles (the source tarballs used by the ports collection)? When I aquired the FreeBSD 4.4 set, it came with all of that (over 1GB worth IIRC). If you don't feel like buying it direct from the FreeBSD people, I think some places (like lsl.com.au) do reduced price subscriptions.

&gt; 4) If one were to choose between a Linux 2.4.X (latest stable) and
&gt;    a FreeBSD 4.X-STABLE for a firewall assuming that I were to have
&gt;    all the time in the world to set one up, read documentation and 
&gt;    so forth, what reasons would favour one over the other?

Religious bias. Both do pretty good firewalling and both have some quite advanced features (traffic shaping, proper NAT, state inspection, etc). Both are very stable. Most open source unix routing software compile and run on both.

Some people prefer the syntax of the BSD packet filtering system over the linux one. Others like the ability to be able to use multiple route tables under linux (anyone know of any other OS that allows this?) and some of the other cool features of the iproute2 suite. I'm not sure how compatible their respective IPSec implementations are over the wire, but a lot of people seem to like sticking to a single implementation (usually due to the huge differences in configuring each - using one implementation saves learning both, which can take some time).

It all depends on what your firewall needs to do, how much time you've got and what you know. I would think that for most people's firewalling needs, both are roughly equal. OpenBSD's becoming more popular in this field too. It might be worth looking at that too (but don't tell Theo I said that :-)).

Hope it helps,
Matt
