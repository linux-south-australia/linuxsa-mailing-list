hello all,

the subject of learning institute security came up, someone suggested it was
easy... well it really is that easy.

I believe that there are some admin staff from Tea Tree Gully TAFE on this
list and would probably be very interested to hear about their network
holes. I will approach you personally after my exams tomorrow if it helps.

Today I connected from my workstation to the network printer via ftp. opened
MSword and printed to a file, then 'moved' the file to the ftp connection
and YIPPEE ...FREE PRINTING. and the best part was that I wasn't put into
any print queue.

That said... I am a Diploma student finishing this year and am wanting
workexperience in networking and help desk (I come pre packed with my own
sponsor and work cover insurance). I would very much like the opportunity to
experience the 'hands-on' IT environment. ANYONE ?

I do not want to get expelled so I stopped there... but... I would be most
happy to tell you that I also accessed the local control panel, registry and
administrative tools even though they are blocked to students. Yes I just
typed "control" in the 'run' menu and there it was.

Pity Linux is not installed on the workstations.

Regards
Jason Civetta
