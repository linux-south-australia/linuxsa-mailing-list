I think the days of counting every precious little MHz on our humble 486s
are well and truly over.  I think we can now safely remove a lot of clutter
form our environment - namely two machines / monitors for this purpose if
constantly rebooting is not an option.

This would be great too for perhaps outputting two different OS's to two
screens from one machine?

Saves money on multiple machines too.

Or maybe our BEOs friends would like to have their favourite OS only a
alt-function key away.

performance)



&gt;  &gt; Could one run VMWare under another console to have two
&gt; operating systems
&gt;  &gt; that one can switch between?
&gt;
&gt; That seems a bit extreme :-)
&gt;
&gt;   - mark
&gt;

extreme but is it practical, has anyone done this? I'm trying to convince
them to let me do that here at work. We run a software package that is win32
only (and doesn't work to well under wine). I want them to let me run a
linux desktop and use vmware in another console for those times i need it.
(we are slowly moving towards linux / openoffice / non microsoft everything)

I currently do the opposite, i run a linux vmware session under win2k that
provides a few functions (cvs, etc). The only performance hit i have is
memory as the machine is idle most of the time.

If you have enough memory and dont need huge amount of cpu for the virtual
machine is this a viable solution? is it viable even if you do need the cpu?
