&gt; tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors

This doesnt necisarily denote a serious problem. Sometimes if a file has
changed during tar reading it, you'll get one of these, but it'll keep
going, and that file migth be corrupt, but the rest should be ok. So
long as you have incremental backup it shouldnt be a big problem.
 
&gt; It stops at the same location every time and I'm left with a
&gt; semi-complete tar archive:
&gt; -rw-r--r--    1 root     458824039 Sep  9 11:28 backup-20020909.tar.gz

How do you know its semi complete?

Have you done a tar -tzvf backup-20020909.tar.gz to see what is actually
in it?

&gt; Notice the file size?  Is this an issue?  At first I tried substituting

I doubt it. Be weary of the 2g files, but that size is nothing special.

&gt; directories, and made a complete copy of the data area I wished to back
&gt; up, and tried it again, but I got the same problem.  Could tar be having
&gt; difficulty taring a particular file, considering it stops at the same
&gt; one each time (usr/local/backup/pronto/pronto/.addressbook.lu)?

This should rule out the changing files.....
 
&gt; There is 15G free on this disk.  The tar command is run as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; tar -T $FILELIST -cvzf $BACKUP_FILENAME 2&gt;&1
&gt; 
&gt; Where $FILELIST is a text file with a list of files to backup, and
&gt; $BACKUP_FILENAME is fairly obvious.  I'm unsure about the "2&gt;&1" portion
&gt; of the command, because I originally wrote this script with guidance
&gt; from a friend of mine, and I can't recall now what this redirects or why
&gt; it is there, exactly.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions?

It redirects std_err to std_out. Its good if you want to pipe both
std_err and std_out too a single file for reporting purposes. You could
change it to 2&gt;errfile.txt (I think) to log just the errors, and you
might be able to match up the error at the end with a previous error.
