Michael,

&gt; They had port 53 wide open on their firewall for quite a while, I used to
&gt; run my pop3 and smtp over it from one of my linux servers, then they closed
&gt; it... so I then went to tunneling it through https!

And it's students who do that who disadvantage the whole. And it's
students who do that who manage to give Linux a bad name and therefore
get it thrown off the internal network. Don't expect me to have sympathy
with you because you could do that.

It's not the students' network.

Simply because I'm capable of walking into a tourist resort in Tasmania
with a semi-automatic gun and killing 30 people doesn't make it right.
People who claim that "because those idiots [quoting you] let it
through" makes it somehow right are just plain wrong. 

When you have a RIGHT you also have a RESPONSIBILITY; too many people
seem to conveniently forget that rights beget responsibilities.

I've been in work situations where I know that some students are
tunelling stuff over a proxy. The moment I determine who those students
are, I know what will happen. This is from most likely to least likely:

a) The students will be counselled about the misuse of the system
b) The students will lose ALL access rights to ALL computers [and tough
if this makes them fail -- these particular students don't have their
own computers[
c) The students will be disqualified from their degree

I'm advocating (c) because I am pissed off that one or two students --
and I know it's only one or two students -- are putting all 300 or more
students at risk.

DSL

(1) I detest the luny left. All rights, no responsibilities. All "we
have freedom of speech" and no "we have responsibility for what we say".
It doesn't work that way. And God help you if I think you're a person
who thinks this way [btw Michael, I don't think you are, so you needn't
be too worried -- mind you, you can be a little misguided at times but
can't we all]!
