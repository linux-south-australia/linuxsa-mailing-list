&gt; Rob,

&gt; What you experienced is not even slightly unusual for internet
&gt; mailing lists.  Not all lists are quite as "vigorous" as this,
&gt; and indeed not everybody on this list agrees on what level of
&gt; "heat" is reasonable, but I assure you that if you continue to
&gt; subscribe to mailing lists you'll have this same experience again.
&gt; After all, just like you, we are enthusiasts who give of our time
&gt; for no reason other than that we want to help.  David Lloyd, for
&gt; all that he can be queer chap, does try to help, but sometimes he
&gt; likes to provoke a reaction, and other times he gets unreasonably
&gt; cranky.  I guess we're all like that, sometimes.
&gt;
&gt; By all means leave our little community if you want, but if you
&gt; do so simply because you got flamed then you're a bloody idiot.
&gt; I myself have been a bloody idiot before, but thankfully I got
&gt; over it and grew a thicker skin.
&gt;
&gt; Stay.  Go.  Your choice.  But don't cut off your nose.

FWIW this is the most constructive and sensible post I have ever seen from 
David N (who has been known to suffer from SOL in past postings).

I can only suggest that Rob and any other offended person read, mark and 
inwardly digest.
