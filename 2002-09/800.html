Mike,

&gt; Personally, I'm suprised that more people don't use EXT3 for generic
&gt; Linux workstations.

As the major vendors update their filesystems -- and they are all going
to ext3 -- and people start to install them, then we'll see more ext3.
People with current workstations aren't all going to suddenly go out and
transform their filesystems just because they can. Give them time.

&gt; The only real benefit a journaling FS brings a
&gt; workstation's user is the data integrity bit - being able to pull the
&gt; machine's plug out of the wall and not losing any data.

That may be true, however ext3's full data journal -- to my knowledge --
is not turned on by default. I believe you have to tell ext3 to journal
ALL data otherwise it, like ReiserFS, JFS and XFS will only journal the
metadata. Because workstations tend not to process data as quickly as a
server serving hundreds of users, even though XFS, JFS and ReiserFS
journal only the metadata it's unlikely you'll lose any data.

I, an many others, haven't.

&gt; Any other
&gt; features a journaling FS has are of marginal (at best) usefullness on a
&gt; typical workstation.

Features such as:

* faster directory lookups
* being able to pack more files in smaller spaces (i.e. ReiserFS)
* ReiserFS's object oriented plugin module stuff
* ACL's and extended attributes that actually work
* better (for some definition of this word) algorithms
* ability to handle terabytes of data (i.e. XFS)
* faster access to files
* ability to delete files really quickly (i.e. ReiserFS)

XFS, JFS and ReiserFS are different implementations of a filesystem.
That they are journalling filesystems is just one of their attributes.
They've all been developed for different reasons and they all have
features or characteristics that a typical workstation will benefit
from.

&gt; EXT3 is a lot less suprising than the other journaling FS's, it has a
&gt; much more mature toolset

Defina a "more mature toolset".

I can adjust ACL's in XFS. I have extended attributes in XFS. Dump works
with Amanda AND backups up all ACL's and extended attributes. And the
Data Management API appears to behave under Linux as it does under Irix.

&gt; and most importantly, is backwards compatible
&gt; w/ EXT2 and hence older kernels, rescue disks, etc, etc. It makes a lot
&gt; more sense to me on a workstation to me that any other journaling FS.

Tom's Bootdisk has included XFS support for quite a while. A lot of the
other rescue disks do as well. Mandrake's has supported XFS since 8.1
(and possibly 8.0) as well, and SuSe quietly have XFS in theirs as well
[quietly because SuSe prefers and partially funds ReiserFS/Namesys].

&gt; On servers the case may well be different, but all of mine use UFS (w/
&gt; soft-updates where appropriate), so I couldn't comment on that.. :)

Which UFS?

man mount says:

 ufstype=value
              UFS is a file system widely used in different oper­
              ating  systems.   The problem are differences among
              implementations. Features of  some  implementations
              are undocumented, so its hard to recognize the type
              of ufs automatically.  That's why user must specify
              the  type  of ufs by mount option.  Possible values
              are:

It doesn't list "ext2" as a UFS.
