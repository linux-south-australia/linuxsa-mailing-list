The Linux Family,

The smiley face people???????

Heaven help us when the next generation joins this group. The jibber that
the kids at school speak today would be unintelligible to the word and
grammar police!

As a member of the debating fraternity of some 16 years and now coaching a
gifted debating team at a public school I have learn't 2 important factors
relating to communications.

1. It doesn't matter what or how you say it as long as the audience gets the
message.
2. If you are frustrated, angry or upset by someone or something don't speak
at all, you are heading for disaster and will destroy any chance of winning
people's confidence or attention.

I like your comments and the debate, I know academics and computer nerds
have difficulty expressing themselves to the greater community, I have the
same problem however tolerance is the order of the day.

While I'm out buying a new keyboard tak and I look forward to the continued
presence of Rob in the forum.

Hang in there and let's all learn from our mistakes.

Desmond R Elliott

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Is anyone keeping a count of the long running 'DSL vs the Internet'
&gt; campaign?
&gt;
&gt; What bothers me most about the grammer tirades (and yes, bad grammer does
&gt; make a question way harder to understand), is that there is no space given
&gt; to the poor individual involved to accomodate what may in fact be a major
&gt; disability. (Ron, I am not suggesting you are suffering from a disabilty,
&gt; only that you could be, and we wouldn't know)
&gt;
&gt; When I went to Communications 101, I learnt that the core of communication
&gt; is a 2 way exchange where receivers of communication process it and then
&gt; ask verifying questions back to the other party for any part of the
&gt; communication not understood. Various things get in the way of this open
&gt; communication, and that is what has happened here.
&gt;
&gt; It's a pity that a new linuxsa'er gets treated this way, and like someone
&gt; else has already mentioned, there are probably plenty of other lists that
&gt; will also critisize his grammer rather than help him with his question.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps in dealing with the question without gross critisism, we could
&gt; have had a better outcome for Rob's grammer and his linux box?
&gt;
&gt; &lt;steps down from soapbox&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Back to Linux!
&gt;
&gt; Michael
