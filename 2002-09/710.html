I think it's a great idea.

It means that if say a family share a computer - they can all have their own
locked X session running without having to log out and back in to hand the
machine to someone else.

It would also be cool to run VMWare in one terminal running Win2K or the
like - so you could switch between to completely different OS's quite easily
- would be a great party trick and to impress M$ heads..

Quoting Andrew Galdes &lt;<A HREF="mailto:AGaldes@elders.com.au">AGaldes@elders.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; How would I go about running multiple window managers (KDE, Gnome, etc...)
&gt; simultaneously? That is, to have (for example) KDE running on session 7
and
&gt; Gnome running on session 8.
&gt; 
&gt; Im sure there is more to it, but i understand that the X server can have
&gt; many hosts and this should just be a matter of telling each window manager
&gt; to "take a number".
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried "man startx" and followed leads from there but still cannot
&gt; find the means to do this.

Shouldn't be hard.  If your display manager (xdm, gdm, kdm) allows you to 
choose your session (ie Gnome, KDE) you can just have ?dm running on VT7 and

VT8 and log into a different session on each[1].

gdm can do this easily - you can even start up VT8 from within VT7 using 
gdmflexiserver (or nested with gdmflexiserver --xnext which I *really* like
:)

The question is why you'd want to do it?  I run Gnome on my desktop with the

occasional KDE app on it.  You can do the versa-visa as well.  As long as
you 
have the appropriate libs installed, KDE and Gnome apps will run on each
others 
desktop with no problems[2].

[1] You may not want to log into the same user account simultaneously though
- 
Gnome and KDE are starting to share configuration information and running
both 
desktops with the same config files at the same time may not be a good idea.
[2] Well ok, panel apps won't.  But applications will.  Just look at the Red

Hat 8 beta - they take this idea to the extreme.
