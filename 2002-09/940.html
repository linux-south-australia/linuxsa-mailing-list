I think you are right.

What is IPCop and Clarkconnect like?  The latter sounds good if it has good
graphing utilities.

David sometimes forgets that we are not all techies - the rest of us simply
do not have the time to wade through manuals - we need to set up first and
ask questions later or learn when we need to.

And I am not doing this for a living so that disqualifies me from the
necessity run spartan dated text consoles only when on today's machines a
lean window manager is not even a blip on the CPU and memory radar (I am not
talking KDE / Gnome - more like IceWM and so on).

David is right - GUIs are for the weak - so I am weak - but hey - at least I
am enjoying myself and learning a few things to boot.

I'd agree that you will learn more if you build your own, however if you
need something NOW that will work and provide protection get IPCop and
install it. Its only a 25 Meg download - burn the ISO and install it. Given
that it will install and run on a low end pentium or even a 486 it is quick
and easy to set up.

Step 2 : The guys who put IPcop together have done a good job of an "off the
shelf" install product. Have a look at what they have done. See some of the
nifty tools they have integrated.

Step 3 : try and aquire another PC !! and on this one load up
Mandrake/Redhat/Debian or whatever and then try and " roll your own". Think
about what IPcop does and whether you need less or more functionality.

For a newbie ( myself included ) trying to get a Firewall running under
Linux is daunting. Your first step would be to make your work area secure
and secondly to learn about what makes it tick.

David said

"I don't want to sound harsh, but consider that most people whom I know

Yes, but IPcop ( or Smoothwall or Clarkconnect ) Dont run X windows. They
run a Local Webserver that you connect to from another PC. You can also
connect to your Ipcop box from your main windows or Linux PC using SSH if
you want to edit files or look around in Command line mode.

A LOT of people on this list will bag the "ready made" firewall products and
most of them have NEVER installed any of them. They have their place IMHO
and should not be disregarded so lightly. Ive got friends who run IPcop and
Clarkconnect that have absolutley NO idea about Linux, but they are more
comfortable in regards to their LAN security behind their Net connection.

A good analogy is like buying a car.

1) You can just buy one from a dealer and use it to drive from A to B. When
it needs repairs you take it to the garage.
2) You could go to a Wrecker and buy all the bits to make a car and put it
together yourself ( that would be fun - NOT ). Yes you will learn all about
the workings and probably get very frustrated. It might take many months
before you have a safe car to drive.
3) You could buy a car from the dealer and then make some of your own
modifications to it to suit yourself and carry out repairs. It gets you from
A to B safely whilst you can still learn about it.

P.S. regarding pretty graphs - Smoothwall and IPcop generate basic traffic
graphs ( using MRTG ).
ClarkConnect generates lots of pretty graphs showing
uptime/usage/loads/traffic etc etc.

Regards,

Michael

Ian,

&gt; I want to set up a dedicated firewall / proxy - cache on an old machine to
&gt; run via wireless to my laptop.

That sounds good.

Did you know that the InstallFest 2002 Unplugges (1) has an emphasis on
wireless networking?

&gt; Any ideas on the best way to go about this?  What is Smoothwall like?  Can
&gt; it produce pretty graphs and lots of statistics?  I want to take the
&gt; opportunity to learn more about networking.

Then don't use Smoothwall or IPCop; if your objective is to learn about
something, don't use a tool that does it for you. Get a base
distribution -- and contrary to popular opinion they will all be just as
good as each other at the end of the day -- and get your fingers dirty.

&gt; I know Mandrake firewall can
&gt; produce a lot of graphs and statistics and looks quite good but it is also
&gt; quite dated.

And what does putting a CD into the CDROM drive and clicking a few
buttons teach you?

&gt; Is there much difference (as far as the desktop is concerned) between
&gt; Smoothwall GPL and Smoothwall retail (corporate)?)

I don't think so -- and you still get the same, ever so polite
maintainer.

&gt; Does anyone have any ideas for good reporting software for Squid?  I have
&gt; Calimaris installed and this works great (if it were not for Squid
emptying
&gt; my access.log upon reboot) but it is all in text - how can I produce a
&gt; graphical representation of all this?

Visit:

* <A HREF="http://www.squid-cache.org/">http://www.squid-cache.org/</A>

...I'm sure I saw some fancy graphics hooha there.

&gt; In Mandrake 8.2 - Portsentry seems to have disappeared to be replaced with
&gt; Prelude?  Anyone have any ideas how to set this up properly?  I am also
&gt; trying to work out what Snort is for (I have it compile and installed) -
is
&gt; this like Portsentry but better?


Prelude? I went to their home page (no I can't remember where) and it
seemed to have good HOWTOs and guides. As to Snort, that has a good home
page too. Again, I can't remember the URL.

&gt; I think I should just wait for Mandrake 9.0 - maybe that has better
&gt; configuration tools for firewall / proxy and caching name server..

Ok, what is wrong with:

* a few HOWTOs
* a few BEERs
* vi
* a Mandrake XYZ distribution

???

You will, trust me, learn a lot more by doing all of this by hand and in
text. Unless you've been to a well designed and presented course, and
actually understood it, you won't learn the concepts you are looking for
simply by knowing what a few point-and-click buttons do.

I don't want to sound harsh, but consider that most people whom I know
who setup firewalls as their living generally don't install nice GUI's
to administer them. Why?

* bloat
* X can be seen as a security issue

You might want to start out with the "Iptables HOWTO" (whose URL again I
forget, but it's been mentioned on fresheat and I'm sure it's part of
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A> -- <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A> if I've stuffed the
first address up). I'm almost certain that will be a little confusing
because it's more of a reference than a tutorial but it will get you
asking questions.
