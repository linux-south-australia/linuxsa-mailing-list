&gt;&gt; The chief architect of the FreeBSD project used to be David Greenman,
&gt;&gt; but he gave up the post some years ago, and it has never been
&gt;&gt; replaced.  Mike Karels has never worked on FreeBSD, and AFAIK David
&gt;&gt; has never worked on BSD/OS.
&gt;
&gt; It's been so long since I was involved with the BSD/OS community that
&gt; my memory of names and achievements has become vague.  I did think that
&gt; Mike Karels was at least at one time part of the FreeBSD team, but you'd
&gt; certainly know better than I.

In fact, Mike was very opposed to Wind River's intended merge of
FreeBSD and BSD/OS, and may have been the key mover who stopped it
happening.

&gt; I also think I remember him as being central to UCB's BSD group.

Yes, that's correct.  That was the Computer Sciences Research Group
(CSRG).

&gt; The name Chris Torek also springs to mind.  Is (or was) he part of
&gt; the FreeBSD team?

No.  I thought he had contributed, but obviously not directly.  You
can see a complete list of commits to the FreeBSD /usr/src tree over
recorded history at <A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~peter/src.total.txt.">http://people.freebsd.org/~peter/src.total.txt.</A>
There's also an overview at
<A HREF="http://people.freebsd.org/~peter/commits.html.">http://people.freebsd.org/~peter/commits.html.</A>  You have to know the
user IDs of the people, so here are a few of the CSRG people:

  bostic	Keith Bostic
  karels	Mike Karels
  mckusick	Kirk McKusick
  ?		John Quarterman
  sam		Sam Leffler
  torek		Chris Torek
  wjolitz	Bill Jolitz

Only mckusick and sam show up on the lists.
