Desmond,

&gt; The smiley face people???????

Yes. It goes like this: :-)

&gt; Heaven help us when the next generation joins this group. The jibber that
&gt; the kids at school speak today would be unintelligible to the word and
&gt; grammar police!

Just as an aside, I spat the dummy at my stepsister for talking like
"Ali G"; in fact I think I told her it would be better to speak to me in
formal Japanese and for me to go and translate it (I don't know
Japanese) rather than have to put up with listening to rapper clap trap.

&gt; 1. It doesn't matter what or how you say it as long as the audience gets the
&gt; message.

Yes it does matter what and how you say it. I'd enjoy watching your team
debate in English with no interpreters in front of a Chinese judge and
audience none of whom spoke English. The audience does need to get the
message and the manner of delivery does count.

&gt; I like your comments and the debate, I know academics and computer nerds
&gt; have difficulty expressing themselves to the greater community, I have the
&gt; same problem however tolerance is the order of the day.

I don't think I have any particular difficulty expressing myself. I'm
not entirely certain that Rob does either, although I don't cope with
difficult to understand questions. 

&gt; Hang in there and let's all learn from our mistakes.

One of the things about the Open Source Community I've discovered is
that there are abrasive people about (and I'm not as abrasive as some,
and I'm not abrasive all the time) and that's life. I generally ignore
the abrasive parts of the message and pick the information out or I give
as good as I get.

Heh!
