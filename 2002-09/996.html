&gt; I think that is specific to Flinders I too have my Bsc From there and when
&gt; I did some postgrad stuff I was stunned as to the lack of compulsory maths
&gt; but their focus is industry centric and they feel the higher maths should
&gt; be optional. Don't forget there are a number of IT degrees on offer which
&gt; have the core CS in all of them but the optional subjects vary widely
&gt; including the ability to do higher maths like the degree I got.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I may be wrong, or just mistaken on some of this, I am not as closely

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;it would help explain the standard of most CS graduates nowdays.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(it was Suns, Macs in the library, the odd PC (DOS) and that
&gt;&gt;&gt;pyramid thing in the maths dept when I was there)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think that the standard of CS degrees offered by universities is dropping.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;After I graduated from Flinders Uni with a Bachelor of Science degree
&gt;&gt;specialising in Computer Science, they watered down the Computer Science
&gt;&gt;specialisation. When I was there, there was a considerable amount of
&gt;&gt;mathematics topics that were required to complete the Computer Science
&gt;&gt;specialisation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My wife is studying for the same degree that I have at Flinders Uni at the
&gt;&gt;moment. I found out from her that they have removed all the compulsory
&gt;&gt;maths requirements from the course.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Cheers.

I too have the same degree, and it was 1/2 way through 2nd year of my 
course when they dropped the stats/maths requirement. Contrary to you 
guys though, I was extremely happy when this happened, because it meant 
I could do virtually all of the available CS subjects and avoid doing 
any more "several variable calculus", which I hated, did not understand, 
(somehow passed), and have never had any use for in real world programming.
Obviously logic / binary etc is required for computing, but these should 
be in CS subjects if they are required - I have no desire to be a 
mathematician. If a customer needs some insanely complicated maths 
coded, I ask for an algorithm and I code it. I have enough basic 
knowledge of Maths to do this, with my skill being in the coding part. 
There are much more useful/relevant things to my current career that 
could have been made available at uni than maths.
If you like maths - do them as your optional subjects, if it only bores 
you and you will get nothing out of them (like me - I cram and forget 
stuff like that), study something more interesting and useful to you.

obviously IMHO,
Barney.
