I have been asked to clarify my previous comment;

&gt; from what I have heard from the inside Uni of Adelaide is no great example &gt; with their 'destroy Linux/Macs at all costs' program.
&gt;

Now that the ITS people have taken over the Uni networking, many Linux and
Mac Servers have been pulled out and networks migrated across the road so
it is all in the 'one shop' and running on MS servers. The word I get is
that ITS wants all servers to be running MS and all based in ITS across the
road from the Uni itself. That all the traffic has to run through the
'pipe' under the road now instead of happily working inside/alongside the
area that the servers used to serve is just another way to put all the IT
eggs into the one basket. Heavy users may have their own servers due to
bandwidth problems in the ITS pipe but this will be the exception to the
rule and they still wont be allowed to run Linux. Fancy that, a University
without a Linux/UN*X Server, who would have thought that day might come?

I have heard that ITS will not be supporting any Mac applications nor any
Linux/Unix applications. If you want ITS support then run MS. If your
Department has stacks of $$s and you want to control your own destiny then
buy in your own servers and buy in your own support. 

The effect of the 'kill Mac' attitude on the Mac-sensitive Departments such
as Architecture and Multimedia is to say the least disheartening. The story
is that they are scrambling to find equivalent PC - MS based applications
because they have been told to get rid of their Macs. 

Maybe ITS could promote themselves as "ITS - an EDS Clone". This is the
price of progress.

I may be wrong, or just mistaken on some of this, I am not as closely
linked to Uni of Adelaide anymore.

Cheers,  Ian
