&gt;If you are planning to merge what are currently separate domains, with 
&gt;different SIDs, into one domain, then you might have some 
&gt;problems with profiles.

Effectively this is what I'd like to do, and as only one (small) site runs
roaming profiles it's not a major problem.  I'd like to set up roaming 
profiles afterwards though, possibly running locally.

What I envision is this:

[LDAP/SAMBA PDC]  
(this is the PDC located at one primary site, also holds the local
site's data/profiles etc, central backup also)
|
&lt;router&gt;
|
&lt;WAN CONNS - 64k+&gt;
|
&lt;router&gt;
|
&lt;LOCAL SAMBA BDC&gt; 
(local Samba box, storing that sites data/profiles locally, authenticating
from main LDAP box above, possibly replicating LDAP data as Matt suggested)

Basically this BDC type setup would be replicated for 10 other sites. 
Is this feasible enough or is there a more efficient way of doing it?


&gt;Were you planning to create one domain with one Samba server 
&gt;as a PDC and the others as BDCs? This is possible. However, a number of 
&gt;things have to be right and have to be set up. 

Yes.  See above.  What are the main things that would need to be right 
for this to work successfully?


&gt;Profiles are one issue in this case, but 
&gt;there is code in Wine that might be usable to rummage through the 
&gt;NTUSER.dat and change the security descriptor so that the SID 
&gt;of the user matches the new domain.

Not a huge issue, see above, most sites are using local profiles (yuk!)
at the moment, seeing as we have now implemented a very standardised 
desktop setup it's more sense to move towards roaming profiles in the 
future, or at the same time as migrating to the LDAP backend.


&gt;Under the soon to be released Samba 3.0.0 (Nov/Dec looks good at the 
&gt;moment)

Can't wait :)
