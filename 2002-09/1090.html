&gt; &gt; In what way was that so bad, all I was using it for was to get pop3 mail and
&gt; &gt; send using SMTP instead of having to use webmail!
&gt; 
&gt; The designated usage of port 53 is for DNS traffic, not POP3, SMTP or
&gt; any other strange protocol you might choose to run over it. The IT
&gt; Departements can and sometimes do charge colleges for all traffic and
&gt; this increases the overall cost of providing the Internet service for
&gt; all students.

If he was going to get his mail through the webmail like most
hotmail-happy windows users do anyway, he would be getting the same
amount of mail, just through pop instead. Key point being, consuming the
same amount of bandwidth.

I don't see any reason for the place to deny POP3/SMTP access through
the standard ports, it is after all a standard protocol.

&gt; And eventually the students pay in some way. Either up front or their
&gt; equipment doesn't get upgraded as fast as possible, or their helpdesk
&gt; isn't staffed satisfactorily and so on.

Agreed, if a student were to exploit the use of the servers and use
unnecessarily high amounts of bandwidth, the other students would pay.
But surely there are other ways to control this than to completely
disallow POP3/SMTP and instead cripple the users with some web mail
interface?

If you recall a post you make earlier about computer security:

"We need to remember that a system is NOT secure if it's NOT useable. If
it's so SECURE it's UNUSABLE then people WILL find a way to use the
system which often exposes them to more security flaws. If they can't
find a way around the security then your system is UNUSABLE which is a
wholly different concept to NOT SECURE."

Is it security to disallow POP3/SMTP, not allowing them to access their
preferred email account and instead enforcing webmail?

By allowing POP3 you allow them to use whatever email program they want
(not good for TAFE computers (which are ghosted frequently anyway,
apparently), but this user suggested he was using his own computer). I
thought we'd be all for freedom of choice, the Linux way etc. I guess
the main problem might be viruses and Outlook but anyone cluey enough to
use POP3 probably (hopefully) wouldn't use that aweful program anyway.
