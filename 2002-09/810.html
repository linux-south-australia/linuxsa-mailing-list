Michael,

&gt; Oh, that's reasonable, and was what I'd expect. What does suprises me
&gt; are those people who *do* use a journaling FS on their desktop, and
&gt; *don't* use ext3.

I expect that most of the masses will use "ext3" simply because it's the
"file system supported by the most companies".

&gt; Yeah, but on a typical workstation, all those features aren't terribly
&gt; useful. It's like souping-up your car so it can do 300kph, rather than
&gt; 200kph - nice to have, but with legal speed limit at 100kph, why bother?

What is a "typical workstation"?

&gt; &gt; * faster directory lookups
&gt; 
&gt; Shrug. Unless you've got some very large directories, the impact is minimal.

I would disagree -- attempting to open any of the documentation
directories, viewing a huge gallery of images using something like
gqview (typical users have a tendency to dump all their images into one
single, rather large directory). Now that KDE and Gnome are going
bloatware, it's going to be up to the rest of the system to make them
run sensibly.

&gt; &gt; * being able to pack more files in smaller spaces (i.e. ReiserFS)
&gt; 
&gt; 120Gb+ HDDs anyone? Who cares about saving a few meg here and there?

But you say that IDE hard drives are slow. If ReiserFS can unpack these
blocks more quickly than jumping all over the filesystem then ReiserFS
will go faster.

&gt; &gt; * ReiserFS's object oriented plugin module stuff
&gt; 
&gt; And my Mum cares about this on her Internet terminal, why?

Because you used a module that mattered to her?

&gt; &gt; * ACL's and extended attributes that actually work
&gt; 
&gt; On a workstation? ACLs are pretty moot - better EAs *are* cool, but
&gt; anyway, no workstation apps out there make use of either.

What's a "workstation app"?

&gt; &gt; * better (for some definition of this word) algorithms
&gt; &gt; * ability to handle terabytes of data (i.e. XFS)
&gt; &gt; * faster access to files
&gt; &gt; * ability to delete files really quickly (i.e. ReiserFS)
&gt; 
&gt; Again, none of which are really all that useful for workstations unless
&gt; you're going something fairly unusual on it. Especially if you have IDE
&gt; drives, slooooow IDE drives.

Having better algorithms and faster access to files (for delete, move or
such) won't benefit workstations? I'm not even going to entertain that
idea -- it strikes me as not worth arguing about. And if you haven't
noticed, I'll normally argue about anything, but if you were to push me
into a corner I'd say it's a questionable statement from a usually
non-questionable person...

&gt; I just wonder how much actual benefit people actually get from all these
&gt; extra features. Not much, not enough to go to all the extra effort, I'd
&gt; wager.

Extra effort?

&gt; A toolset that has been around for such a long time on Linux that it is
&gt; well-known: it is mostly bug free, and free from nasty, unknown
&gt; suprises. One that is supported by a large number of 3rd party kernel
&gt; and application developers and also commercial vendors.

So, because "cp", "rm", "mv" and such are not working on "ext2/ext3"
they suddenly become less mature. The whole point of having a VFS layer
in a kernel is to avoid the ugly "lots of toolset" dramas for each file
system. Apart from dump which has to know about the internals of a
filesystem, I'm not aware of any tools that don't support XFS unless
they are accessing the filesystem directly. Which they shouldn't.

&gt; Which is nice, if you have it. What if you've only got a rescue floppy
&gt; with 2.2.18 on hand, however?

Most people using workstations will have their installation media. Even
Windows users tend to have their installation media. And it's easily
obtainable. If Linux were as widely installed as Windows on peoples'
computers that argument wouldn't hold water...

&gt; &gt; Which UFS?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; The one true UFS, of course: BSD FFS.

So, then, why don't YOU have ext3 installed seeing it's so wonderful for
you?
