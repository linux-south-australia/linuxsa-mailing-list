&gt; Although I lament Toshiba's stated position, I can't really find legal
&gt; fault.  They have offered a full refund, but not for the software alone.
&gt; They say that they are selling a product comprised of both hardware
&gt; and software, and that they can't (or won't) sell their product in
&gt; separate parts.  That's surely their right.

But at the end of the day, Toshiba sell computers.  The software that
you run on said computer is your own business.  So, why should I be
forced to pay for software (that Toshiba don't even make, they just sell
it because the evil empire is forcing them) that I'll never use.  They
surely can't justify that.

They give you options on the same computer for screen, hard disk,
memory, etc, but they don't give you an option for what software you
have to run... "you can have any combination of hardware known to man
but you WILL run Windows on this machine".

&gt; 
&gt; I suppose you could liken it to saying that you want to buy the product
&gt; sans keyboard, and in which case probably they would sell you, not a
&gt; single product (laptop without keyboard), but a bunch of spare parts:

It may be their right not to sell you the product sans keyboard.  It
would be difficult, but how difficult is it _NOT_ to install Windows on
the computer before it's shipped? I rekon they save money there because
someone has to get windows into the machine before you get it!

'scuse my rant.  It just fscks me right off that we are being forced to
pay for Windows with computers.  It's just going to get worse with the
new DRM (and Intel supposedly building it into hardware).  We'll be
forced to buy Windows just to turn the damn computer on.  

&lt;/rant&gt;
