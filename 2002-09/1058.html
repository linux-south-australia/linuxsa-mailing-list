yeah Mandrake seems better all round as a family grade, fun and easy to use
distribution that is only 10 times more stable than Windows which is not too
high on the *nix scale of things ;-) on a scale from Windows to BSD???

I am even considering breaking out of my comfort zone and maybe giving BSD a
bash - I keep hearing stories of it's incredibly stability and tight code -
surely BSD could handle VMWare, Squid, firewalling, etc?  What about Debian?
Is that better for all of the above?

I have worked out how to run two window managers or X sessions side by side
- I will set up my machine to have say alt-F7 as the locked don't touch
screen that provides a graphical log of the firewall and proxy and alt-F8 as
dedicated Windows 2000 running on VMWare with MS Word, etc permanently
running for him (he just wants to use word processing).

I presume VMWare can be set up to use a printer no problem?

Of course if this was a business machine - I would not even be touching it -
or I would just run a bare bones BSD / Debian set up to be ultra secure.

BTW - did anyone read yesterdays Australian IT section?  There was mention
of a secure laptop that runs Windows 2000 on top of Debian for added
security and stability.  How BIZARRE is that - that I was just talking about
it the other day?  Seems I am not the first to suspect that *nix could
actually HELP windows function better - I find that totally ironic - it must
upset Uncle Bill.

Ian,

&gt; Red Hat is more secure too right? 

You can build a good house out of plain dirt, water and straw. You can
build a bad house out of bricks and steel. You can, if you really try,
make Smoothwall and IPCop totally insecure. You could also make OpenBSD
totally insecure although you'd probably have to make a concious
decision to do so.

My advice?

a) stick with a distribution you are comfortable with
b) stick with tools you are comfortable with OR
c) make sure you understand the tools you will use by reading, asking
questions and experimentation

&gt; My housemate also wants to use my old
&gt; computer - so I was thinking of setting it up running VMWare permanently
in
&gt; one console for MS Word, etc - I know it is not a good idea (until I can
get
&gt; another machine I can dedicate to firewall tasks) but would an old PIII
450
&gt; with 512MB RAM handle firewall / caching and running VMWare through IceWM?

If you were setting up a business gateway or firewall, I would counsel
you not to run any extra crud -- including X itself -- on it. Because
you're not, I'd suggest you set such a machine up, it won't hurt, and
see what performance you get.

When you get your box up, you might want to talk to someone on IRC
(irc.openprojects.net) and get them to port scan you to see how your
firewall is standing up.

&gt; I think I will do it with Red Hat - that is more stable than Mandrake too
I
&gt; hear - and I keep Mandrake for the desktop / GUI stuff.

All distributions have their good and bad points, RedHat included.
