Hi David,

Autostart duh!, I meant autologin (I wonder how I got anything done 
yesterday), is the login script used by Mandrake for booting straight to 
a particular users login.
Recommended only to be used when you have a workstation only used by one 
person, that does not have any personal or private information or access 
by unauthorised users is unlikely. Or direct booting to a particular 
user is prefered or required option.(All of which you probably know 
given the right name)

I've been using this to boot the machine to the general kids logon. 
Saves giving them passwords and stuff.Altering the script worked but 
seemed to caused other problems in dcop.
I fixed the problem by removing the option in the end, so they now need 
to logon. As they will when the network finally gets together. (At least 
I don't have the problem now )

&gt;&gt;Only one question left, just for my curiosity, does anybody know why kde
&gt;&gt;would use usr//bin or :: in their PATH variable.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What is "autostart"? That sounds a little too Windows like for my
&gt;liking...

&gt;
&gt;(1) KDE is braindead. Very good, but braindead. You're not supposed to
&gt;ask "why" in KDE. Don't question them -- they're emulating Windows. You
&gt;don't have a choice, besides which, they're right...
&gt;
&gt;(2) Desktop Linux Users will eventually kill Linux. Romana, Melkor is
&gt;back on Earth again and we of the old folk must prepare for battle!
