Andrew,

&gt; hall to get one. To be honest, why would the average home
&gt; need a net enabled fridge? What possible use could the
&gt; number of times the door is opened and for how long be of
&gt; use to a manufacturer after the initial data collection
&gt; period to allow for design of later models. The same with
&gt; how many ice cubes are dispensed.

It could give you statistics on whether your fridge is operating at
optimal energy savings.

&gt; a lesser period of time (by survey perhaps). I ask again,
&gt; after an initial data collection period, what possible use
&gt; is it to have these devices connected to the net?

Ever heard of Big Brother?

&gt; have some kind of network interface, but what is it
&gt; connected to? If it is some kind of wireless interface, will
&gt; it:
&gt;     a. Irradiate my food?

Mobile phone technology doesn't irradiate people...

&gt;     b. Irradiate me?
&gt;     c. Leave my fridge open to a cyber criminal attack? This
&gt; really does bring a whole new meaning to the word SPAM!

ROFL

I could imagine coming home with a fridge full of SPAM which of course
comes in cans so that would be rather unamusing.

&gt;     O.K. jokes aside, If you don't own a computer but buy
&gt; one of these hi tech devices what DO you hook it up to.

Your brain implant.

They've developed a bionic eye (for $115 000 US) apparently...if they
can do that, then perhaps that doesn't sound as silly as it seems. Think
of it...a bionic implant that is connected to the optic nerve. With a
bit of trianing we'd get used to the extra info and we could turn it
off. Think of the terminator -- remember how they portrayed his vision
with data flashed before his visual implants.

&gt; Will
&gt; it use IPv4 or IPv6? Another interesting question with the
&gt; diminishing number of IP addresses in the world. I really
&gt; can't see any use for this stuff realistically.

Your argument there doesn't follow.
