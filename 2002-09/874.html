&gt; &gt; &gt;Wow, what a good way to make it worse!
&gt; 
&gt; I don't get this. it's only the instant messenger not AOL.

It's nothing important really.  Only that when install Windows 98 (for
example), it pollutes your install with things like ISP ads, MSN
Messenger, and other crap.  All sorts of stuff that you can't choose
selectively when you install the product, yet they just force you to
have it.

And these days with Windows XP that annoying speech bubble pops up
constantly saying "Take a tour..."  "Activate Windows XP Now..."  "Add a
Passport account to your Windows XP Account" and you just look at it and
think.. "F#$k off!"

I think I just turned my nose up at it because it may mean Lindows is
heading down a similar path, using all these "in your face" programs as
an advertised "feature!"

I wonder how many people would be using ICQ instead of MSN Messenger had
Microsoft not plugged it into Windows and attached it to "Passport" and
things like that, which means if you sign up with a Passport and add it
to your account, MSN Messenger automatically connects and registers you
on the network.  Even if you didn't even know what MSN Messenger is,
you're still online with it and this is going into a whole different
debate I don't want to start on this list :)
