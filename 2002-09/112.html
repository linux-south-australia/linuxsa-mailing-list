To Whom It May Concern:

Many years ago, at university, I did a subject called "Technical
Communication".  The idea of the subject was to instruct technically minded
persons in the ability to communicate ideas in a written and oral manner.

One lesson we were asked to read a few pages, which we were later told were
extracted from a work of fiction, of very poorly constructed English.

The problem: For, at least, 12 years of their young lives, my co-students
have had it drilled into their beings, the proper grammar and spelling
expected in the English language.  The majority of the students could not
read the pages presented.

The solution: I have a secretarial background.  I can read what I will call
Manglish, which is poorly written/spoken constructed English.  I have many
years experience in reading Manglish.  I read the pages out to several of my
peers so they could understand what was written in the article.

My complaint to the lecturer: I complained that this was an unfair exercise
to be given to university students.  The lecturer countered by asking if I
thought we were educationally superior and I countered by stating that was
not the problem but that all students had been taught grammar and spelling
to a certain level and the reading of a poorly constructed and badly spelt
article was cumbersome, difficult and of little value.

My conclusion: Many years later, I find myself in a highly multi-cultural
environment at my place of work.  I find I am surrounded by many different
levels of Manglish.  This is mainly due to persons of non-English
backgrounds trying to use proper English in their day to day work.  This is
not because the person(s) concerned purposely try to make mistakes with
English.  For this reason, I try to correct people's incorrect English where
possible but do not make an emphasis on the use of incorrect English where
obviously is not intended.

An aside: David Lloyd - I'd like to believe this is why you are trying to
help people improve their presentation, grammar and spelling.
