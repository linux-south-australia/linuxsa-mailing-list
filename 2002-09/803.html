Ah if you want a "never finished" linux development box then Gentoo is for
you !   It is what people call a "bleeding edge" distro, you can emerge (cf
apt-get) new packages which can result in a completely broken system,
doesn't happen often but does happen.   The sandbox technique is great,
wont compile cleanly, wont install.   The emerge package will want to
update all of your source packages when you decide to resync, you cant just
go and pick and choose which can be painful.   It does use rsync to get the
source files so the downloads *can* be small or large, it depends on the
changes to the source file packages.   Compiling everything from scratch
while great from an optimisation point of view can be painful unless you
have a dial-up gateway between Gentoo and the internet, it takes a while
for some packages to compile so you dont want to be dropping the modem from
inactivity or a inadvertant system crash.

Having said that I very rarely crash the Gentoo box, usually it is because
I have done something incredibly dumb !

I have been using Gentoo for the last 8 months and it has been a really fun
ride.   A bit bumpy in places but still great deals of fun.  But Gentoo is
not for the feignt hearted.   You will regularly have to get in and hack
something to get this and that version of some package working.   I was
lucky in that I knew some people that had been using it already so they got
me started.

It is certainly nice to know that then you emerge and resync that you *are
definitely* upon the bleeding edge of Linux development.

Matthew
