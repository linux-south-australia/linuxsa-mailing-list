Oh, that's reasonable, and was what I'd expect. What does suprises me 
are those people who *do* use a journaling FS on their desktop, and 
*don't* use ext3.

Actually, now that you mention it, another huge benefit of ext3 is the 
ability to take an existing ext2 partition and convert it to ext3 
without needing to backup-reformat-restore the whole thing - just add 
the journal file, and remount as ext3. Nice.

&gt; That may be true, however ext3's full data journal -- to my knowledge --
&gt; is not turned on by default.

Really? I though it *was* on by default.. /me goes digging in the man 
page.. hmm, "data=ordered" is the default, instead of "data=jorunal". Oh 
well.

&gt; 
&gt; Features such as:
&gt; 

Yeah, but on a typical workstation, all those features aren't terribly 
useful. It's like souping-up your car so it can do 300kph, rather than 
200kph - nice to have, but with legal speed limit at 100kph, why bother?

&gt; * faster directory lookups

Shrug. Unless you've got some very large directories, the impact is minimal.

&gt; * being able to pack more files in smaller spaces (i.e. ReiserFS)

120Gb+ HDDs anyone? Who cares about saving a few meg here and there?

&gt; * ReiserFS's object oriented plugin module stuff

And my Mum cares about this on her Internet terminal, why?

&gt; * ACL's and extended attributes that actually work

On a workstation? ACLs are pretty moot - better EAs *are* cool, but 
anyway, no workstation apps out there make use of either.

&gt; * better (for some definition of this word) algorithms
&gt; * ability to handle terabytes of data (i.e. XFS)
&gt; * faster access to files
&gt; * ability to delete files really quickly (i.e. ReiserFS)

Again, none of which are really all that useful for workstations unless 
you're going something fairly unusual on it. Especially if you have IDE 
drives, slooooow IDE drives.

&gt; They've all been developed for different reasons and they all have
&gt; features or characteristics that a typical workstation will benefit
&gt; from.

I just wonder how much actual benefit people actually get from all these 
extra features. Not much, not enough to go to all the extra effort, I'd 
wager.

&gt; 
&gt; Defina a "more mature toolset".
&gt; 

A toolset that has been around for such a long time on Linux that it is 
well-known: it is mostly bug free, and free from nasty, unknown 
suprises. One that is supported by a large number of 3rd party kernel 
and application developers and also commercial vendors.

&gt; 
&gt; Tom's Bootdisk has included XFS support for quite a while.

Which is nice, if you have it. What if you've only got a rescue floppy 
with 2.2.18 on hand, however?

&gt; 
&gt; Which UFS?
&gt; 

The one true UFS, of course: BSD FFS.

;)
