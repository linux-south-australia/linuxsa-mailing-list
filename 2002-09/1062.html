I agree that Outlook has it's problems and from the little bit of testing I
have done with Ximian and Mozilla mail on X the stability has been very
good. The problem is getting uses off of Outlook can be a bit hard some
times. Mozilla Win32 might be an option but it won't suit everyone.
I realise the Qmail isn't the only MTA that understands maildir, it was just
that I seem to come across Qmail and Courier a lot when looking for howto's.
Which gave me the impression is must be quite widely used.

&gt; &gt; I have been look at using IMAP with mostly Outlook and Outlook express
&gt; &gt; clinets for a medium sized site (upto about 90 users) and so have
haven't
&gt; &gt; been very happy with the UW IMAP that RH user in 7.3. The files sizes on
the
&gt; &gt; server can get quite large and I often get Sync errors when there is
&gt; &gt; reasonable amount of unread mail on the server.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have been looking a Qmail and Couier imap as an alternative, from what
I
&gt; &gt; have read the maildir seems more efficient and can handle more then one
&gt; &gt; connection for a client.
&gt;
&gt; Several misunderstandings here.
&gt;
&gt; Firstly, although I would never recommend UW imapd, you can improve
&gt; performance significantly by configuring it to not use flat-format Unix
&gt; mail files at the backend (thus removing the single biggest reason for
&gt; using UW, which is having a common format with mail(1) and older mail
&gt; programs which can't read Maildir.) UW can't use Maildir but it can use a
&gt; couple of other formats which aren't that much different. However they are
&gt; pretty rare formats. Read the UW docco for more info.
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, for a small site such as you describe, if you use modern
&gt; hardware the file storage format doesn't impact performance that much
&gt; unless you have larger-than-usual mail folders (perhaps gigabytes or
&gt; larger). Maildir's advantages for your sort of situation tend to be more
&gt; along the lines of predictability, reliability and ease of maintenance
&gt; than performance. From my deployment and testing experience I believe
&gt; Maildir is much superior in all cases compared to flat Unix format, but at
&gt; these sizes I do not think performance is the deciding factor.
&gt;
&gt; Thirdly, whatever you do at the server end you will have some problems
&gt; with Microsoft mail clients anyway. Microsoft mail clients manage to have
&gt; problems with their own private folder format too so it isn't limited to
&gt; IMAP, but just be cautious before blaming problems on your IMAP server.
&gt; Its a good idea to have a copy of the Mozilla IMAP client around to check
&gt; against. In fact the Mozilla client is so good that often Windows users
&gt; are happy to switch to it instead, depending on what their needs are.
&gt;
&gt; As a general comment, Maildir is by no means a Qmail speciality. Maildir
&gt; (and the Courier enhancement, Maildir++) is very widely supported. In MTAs
&gt; you have Postfix and Exim as well, and many MUAs from mutt to Evolution to
&gt; KMail etc (any any IMAP-capable MUA via Courier.)
&gt;
&gt; I find Courier an excellent product although the documentation is somewhat
&gt; lacking.
