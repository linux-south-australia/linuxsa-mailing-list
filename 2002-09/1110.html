&gt; But then you have to maintain yet another set of ACLs, as opposed to just
&gt; continuing to use Posix ACLs on your filesystem with Maildir++.

And having to maintain user accounts on the machine to implement those
filesystem ACLs.  Non-rhetorical question (i.e. I don't know) - Does
Linux still implement the UID in 16 bits?  That would impose a limit
on the maximum number of users.

&gt; And as to the DB side of things, using a database of any sort for this job
&gt; brings restrictions with it and in a mailstore situation this tends to
&gt; happen quicker than in some others.

Oh, I agree there.  In fact, I still use 1.6 at home because the file
store is on disk as files.  There were noises about implementing a
back-end abstraction layer to write to a file-store of your choice
(and I did see some patches), but I'm not sure if anything came of it.

[...]
&gt; you can't process mail offline for admin purposes (eg scanning for viruses
&gt; retrospectively), you can't point standard Unix tools at the mail, and you
&gt; can't interpret the same data in non-mail ways (eg export it as a
&gt; filesystem or a web page.)

See, for me, I like that whole "one controlled access point" nature
anyway.  There's only one way to get at the store, and that's through
IMAP.  If I want to swap Cyrus for some other IMAP server that uses a
different storage layer (mercury delay lines are coming back in vogue),
then my webmail product or retroactive virus scanner won't notice the
difference anyway.  Yes, there is a cost involved, but I think it's
worth it for that layer of abstraction.  But that's just me; I'm a
modular kind of guy.

&gt; In practice the worst problems are functionality not scaling.

I thought they implemented their "Murder" IMAP aggregator to get around
that?

&gt; I'm sorry the IMSP protocol never really took off though.

I hear that HTTP protocol is doing well these days.  I'm sure
they'll shoe-horn something into that :-/.
