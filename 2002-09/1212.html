&gt; &gt;short, I have a free phone line that goes through a PABX here, but no
&gt; &gt;decent net access. So, I'm thinking of either getting a second phone
&gt; &gt;line plus ADSL (the second phone line would be used for nothing but
&gt; &gt;ADSL), or doing something completely different, if the added cost of
&gt; &gt;an unneeded phone line is prohibitive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; How friendly are you with the PABX provider? :)

quite friendly, but it's still not easy to arrange to do anything
useful...

&gt; 
&gt; Because ADSL through an ISP is billed directly to the end user, you 
&gt; could have it provisioned on a line downstairs, assuming they're not ISDN.

Mmmm... I've discovered that the Telstra side of the PABX is ISDN.

&gt; 
&gt; Then it may be remotely possible to get 3 POTS splitters to take the 
&gt; ADSL signal from the analogue line 'outside', to your copper line on the 
&gt; 'inside' of the PABX, then the last one in your accomodation so you can 
&gt; still use the phone.

yeah, that's one thing I considered, but as it's all ISDN, I don't
think it's going to happen...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Some ISPs provide wireless (microwave, etc) links -- Airnet, Adam,
&gt; &gt;Internode, etc. Not the same thing as a community network.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Just to satisfy some of the lurking nitpickers here who would 
&gt; undoubtedly bring it up later, Adam does not provide wireless links. It 
&gt; does have access to a lot of roof space that some customers have used to 
&gt; setup their own wireless networks. They usually use MIMP to install and 
&gt; manage the equipment.

I sit corrected. :)

What (approximately) would it cost to set up my own wireless link for
that sort of distance?
