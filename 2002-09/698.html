Hi Aamir,

Just some information about what I know....

I probably won't give you the best or easiest solution, but I can 
hopefully get you running.

So I hope that you listen to other people too...

Correct me people :-)

Anyway, for the time being...

There are three general factors that could cause the network card to not 
work:

1. Hardware Failure

2. Hardware Compatability

First, lets try to eliminate the first two factors as being likely...

To do so, plug the ethernet cord into the back of the computer. (I am 
assuming the ethernet cord is known to connect other machines to the 
network. If not then you have another problem on your hands.)

Anyway, look at the back of the computer to see if you can see some 
green lights flashing. If you do, you can probably eliminate 
possibilities 1 & 2.

If you do not....you'll probably need help from one of the guru's on the 
list.


3. Configuration within the operating system.

This is the third and final possibility that I can think of...

If this is the case, you are going to have to improvise and apply the 
link below to turbonetcfg, that was written primarily for Mandrake Linux 
8.1.


Anyway, here is some guidance as to how to set ip numbers work and 
such....assuming that you are on a LAN that uses the 192.168.x.x system.

On firewalling:

Today is your lucky day!   :-)

Be advised that their are more advanced methods and firewall tools, I 
just haven't figured them out enough to put them into the guide yet.

I hope this helps.
