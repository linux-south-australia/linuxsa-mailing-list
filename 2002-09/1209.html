&gt; Outsourcing - if managed well - like any market system - can work
&gt; beautifully.  But it requires the willingness of the customer and their
&gt; support people to be a little constructive, to work as a team with the
&gt; outsourcer rather than just bag the outsourcer without putting too much
&gt; thought or research in to it.

Which sounds great if you WORK for such a company ...

I think it also takes the outsourcer to truely work and understand client 
needs and desires and to try and meet them rather than just blindly 
following a contract.  A lot of them seem to miss this part of the issue.

Ian, go ask one of your account managers and see if they truely can (for 
instance) quote from a customer's annual general report on what their main 
business focuses are for the next 12 or 36months.  Tell me what percentage 
can.  

I see the real failing of outsourcing as a lack of appropriate control.

eg. if I'm a CEO or IT manager and there's an issue with a service then if I 
have people working for me I have total control over getting them to fix a 
business need.  With Outsourcing I no longer have this level of control, I 
have many extra layers of management etc to go through.  There's no 
"cutthrough" as management consulting types like to call it.

Also, if I'm a CEO or IT manager and I don't outsource as a whole I can pick 
and choose what products and services I want, when and from whom and I can 
get people to compete on price and specifics, where as I lose that control 
if I outsource.  A lot of outsourcers demand you use specific things that 
are appropriate to them from their particular lines of business even when 
they are grossly inappropriate.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; From what I've heard, many departments aren't all that keen 
&gt; &gt; on the whole
&gt; &gt; outsourcing thing any more. I've never really understood it 
&gt; &gt; myself, actually.
&gt; &gt; The only reason I've heard in favour of outsourcing is that 
&gt; &gt; it helps to shift
&gt; &gt; the blame when something goes wrong.
