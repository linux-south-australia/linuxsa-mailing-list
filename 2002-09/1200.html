Maybe someone can enlighten me as to how a large outsourcing company can
roll all this up in to standard support and Service Level Agreement
offerings?  Who will support all this?  Do we need a standard Linux
certification or can Unix teams handle Linux support offerings?

&gt; &gt; Gordon and I met Steve Alford in Melbourne earlier this month.  He
&gt; &gt; made a much better impression on us than we expected, and we realise
&gt; &gt; that we still need to find our feet in this material.  If 
&gt; anybody has
&gt; &gt; interesting opinions or ideas, we'd welcome them.  Note that we're
&gt; &gt; talking about solid business reasons why the Government should use
&gt; &gt; BSD, not ideological ones.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that there's the standard list of reasons that are 
&gt; offered to most
&gt; commercial companies. The documentation on Linux and BSD advocacy are
&gt; probably a good place to check for things you may have missed.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a couple of thoughts that have come from my own 
&gt; personal experience:
&gt; 
&gt; Most gov. depts. tend to spend a huge amount on IT - a 
&gt; significant amount of
&gt; that would be on software licensing. IT departments are 
&gt; having funding cut
&gt; (like everyone else), but instead of trying to save money on software
&gt; ransom^H^H^H^H^H^Hlicensing, these departments are forced to 
&gt; "save" money
&gt; elsewhere. This includes less support staff and extending the life of
&gt; hardware (even in mission-critical applications in 
&gt; hospitals). (Note: I'm not
&gt; saying hardware should be upgraded every week, just that it 
&gt; should work).
&gt; 
&gt; For those that absolutely, positively have to run some 
&gt; flavour of Windows
&gt; application, for the cost of a beefy Windows 2000 server and 
&gt; a number of
&gt; Terminal Services Client Access Licenses, rdesktop 
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.rdesktop.org/">http://www.rdesktop.org/</A>)
&gt; is a godsend. It's a lot easier to manage a set number of TS 
&gt; CALs than it is
&gt; to manage a bunch of OEM, upgrade, client and application 
&gt; licenses across a
&gt; 1500+ user network.
&gt; 
&gt; It's probably also worth mentioning that there's no real need 
&gt; for someone to
&gt; pull The Big Switch and all will be free. It's a migration, 
&gt; so you start of
&gt; testing and trialling, then migrate some of your less 
&gt; critical applications /
&gt; departments and then one day you let your software vendors 
&gt; know that you
&gt; won't be requiring the software licenses or support contracts 
&gt; you've had in
&gt; the past :-).
&gt; 
&gt; Hope it helps,
&gt; Matt
