Somewhere I read recently that US American IT companies spend 13% of 
total expenditure on legal fees/costs/wages/etc.
Imagine how much economic growth could occur in the IT sector if that
money was put into research.
One of the benefits of rationalising and reforming the patent and
copyright system might be that IT companies could stop litigating and
start innovating a little more.
Maybe one of the reasons creativity is humming along quite nicely in
the open source sector is the (current) lack of means or desire to litigate,
relatively speaking.

Isn't there a company law in the USA and Australia which actually _requires_
company board members to maximize shareholder value? In other words,
if I am not wrong, it is actually illegal for a company not to take 
advantage of any "opportunity" which comes their way, and SCO seems to
be carrying out its duty. The shareholders could send them to prison otherwise.

CHeers,
ak.
