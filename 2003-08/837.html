Hi all,

Time for the LinuxSA August Meeting.

Here are the usual details:

  When:   7:00pm (doors open 6:45pm) on
          Tuesday, 19th August, 2003
  Where:  2nd Floor
          Compaq Computer
          139 Frome Street
          Adelaide SA
  Cost:   FREE
  Who:    Anyone and everyone.
          No pre-registration necessary.

Presentation:

  Sean Burford will be giving a talk titled "Delving into DNS".  If
  the audience has basic knowledge of the Internet (pretty likely),
  this talk should teach them some DNS theory (without getting bogged
  in detail) and give them an overview of available servers and the
  layout of the existing DNS infrastructure.  People with more
  knowledge will hopefully get excited about the new DNS
  fingerprinting tool being introduced.

  Preliminary Outline:
  - Basic history and outline of DNS
  - How name servers have changed over time
  - Overview, basic architecture of some common servers (bind, NSD, DJBDNS)
  - A new method of fingerprinting DNS servers
  - Results of a little fingerprinting ;)
  - Other tools for extracting data from DNS

  The first part will use little words and colourful diagrams to
  quickly explain about DNS and its place in the Internet.

  The fingerprinting is the fun part.  I'll try to include diagrams
  showing the root, gTLD and .au name server layouts and software
  versions, as well as information about some misconfigurations.  I'll
  be using some DNS fingerprinting software that I have/am
  develop(ing) to create this section.  This section should give
  people a bit more insight into how it all fits together, along with
  DNS' practical strengths and weaknesses.

Extras:

  As per usual, if you are having a problem with your Linux
  installation, feel free to bring your machine.  Make sure to bring
  everything necessary to make your computer work (eg. monitor,
  keyboard, etc).

Pizza:

  After the meeting, please join us for pizza at San Giorgios, a short
  walk north along Frome Street to the corner of Rundle Street.
