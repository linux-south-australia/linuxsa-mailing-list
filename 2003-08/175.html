&gt; However, AUUG president Greg Lehey said there were signs that some
&gt; corporate users would limit or stop using Linux due to fear,
&gt; uncertainty and doubt around the issue.
&gt;
&gt; Mr Lehey said he also had complained to the ACCC, as he believed it was
&gt; breaching the Trade Practices Act.
&gt;
&gt; But he said the biggest concern was that unfounded fear would cause
&gt; organisations not to deploy Linux.
&gt;
&gt; Dieter Kletschkus, IT general manager at Adelaide-based manufacturer
&gt; Gerard Industries, said his company's pilot deployments would be
&gt; limited until there was more information about SCO's claim.
&gt; "
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps Greg or somebody similarly placed could offer some information
&gt; to Dieter to clarify the situation?

If you want me to react, please copy me explicitly in the To: or Cc:
lines; that flags the message, and I look at it faster.

I don't really know what to tell Dieter.  There is a residual danger
that SCO will really sue Linux users.  Yes, they have no basis for it,
and we'll fight it tooth and nail, but given their aggressive
behaviour in the past, they might do it anyway.  I would certainly
feel uncomfortable telling Dieter "Don't worry, they're bloody idiots
without a leg to stand on, and you have nothing to worry about".  Most
of that statement is true, but I'm worrying; why shouldn't Dieter?
The best we can hope for is that this will blow over soon.

Greg
