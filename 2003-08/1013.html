Car CD players seem to be surprisingly good at excluding dust; they
are often cleaner inside than domestic ones. They do this partly by
having rubbery flaps on the slot where the disk goes in and out, so if
dust settles on the flaps, it'll give the CD a nice set of fine
parallel scratches. I doubt the suspension can cope with anything
significantly rougher than tarmac either.

Suspension's going to be the problem with a computer as well - the
bump that makes your CD player skip a track might destroy your hard
drive. I suppose you could have a computer with lots of memory,
playing from memory and interlocked with the speedo so it doesn't try
and spin up the hard drive unless the car's stationary. But it would
also have to be interlocked with the ignition so you didn't drive off
before the hard drive had spun down again...

I'd probably go for a computer booting off a solid-state disk, and
enough RAM to do really long read-aheads, getting the music from a
CD-ROM drive in home-made bungee mounts with the gaps in the case
taped up. CD-ROM drives usually have some sort of dust seal around the
door already, so this would keep the dust out pretty well; they are
less fiddly to take apart and service than car CD players; and they
are much, much cheaper to replace when the dust eventually works its
way inside the optics. They also run cooler than car CD players,
because they don't have a big amplifier chip heatsinked to the case.

In fact, a CD-ROM drive in play-an-audio-CD mode does read-ahead and
retry-on-error all by itself. So for a really cheap system you could
just have the CD-ROM drive with no computer at all, with its audio
output wired into a suitable amplifier like a simply-modified car
radio/cassette player.
