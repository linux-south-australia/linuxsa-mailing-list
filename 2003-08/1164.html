&gt; Now let's bring this analogy to light. Whilst I am not suggesting that
&gt; Linux users are terrorists by any means, they are probably the ones that
&gt; are exploiting the holes in all of Microsoft's systems, resulting in them
&gt; finding thousands. Microsoft (western society) is happy with something that
&gt; is easy to use, and doesn't require a degree in rocket science to
&gt; understand. They have got no beef with trying to exploit the holes in
&gt; Linux, resulting in 'not many' being found.

foo. script kiddies, aka '1337 haXX0rs' are found on every platform.

actually, most i have encountered on *nix systems are too busy exploring the 
possibilities, or actively contributing to various open source projects.

malicious little crackers can equally be found giggling maniacally on windows 
boxen....

you have to understand, despising crappy microsoft stuff (imho) DOESNT equate 
to wishing it harmed. too muchlike shooting fish in a barrel - a sitting 
target. most of us pity ms users. poor sods, using worthless pos like 
windows. only ONE window manager? no security? limitations and overpriced 
crud galore? POOR HELPLESS UNEDUCATED ONES! they need help in seeiing the 
viable alternative, nay, improvement linux offers.

ms stuff dies on its own enough - the linux community doesnt need to help it;)

the 'holes' in linux require root access in the majority of cases to ldo 
anything. or some sort of physical access and account access. linux being 
inherently different to windows makes it harder to affect.

THATS why ms gets targeted. of course, once linux gets the lions share of the 
market, we will be a greater target, and more attempts will be made.

&gt; I come from a Microsoft background, and am TRYING very hard to get my head
&gt; around Linux. I'm a smart guy, and I pick things up quickly, but one of the
&gt; problems is getting use to Linux culture. You're all very good at what you
&gt; do and can often talk in a language that you think people like me
&gt; understand. However, this is not always the case.

welcome. its a learning curve, as windows once was for you. ask, and we are 
happy to explain!:))

&gt; I hope no one has taken offense to this, as it was not my intention.

nah, dsl is far more scary;))
