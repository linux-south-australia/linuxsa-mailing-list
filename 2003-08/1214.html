OpenExchange is good if only a small proportion of users use Outlook.
It is based on replication rather than a realtime connection with the
server.  Ie, you use IMAP/POP3 for your email, but your contacts and
tasks, etc, are replicated every n minutes with the server.  It has no
real support for public folders, free/busy data, or many of the features
of Outlook/Exchange that are, frankly, quite cool.  It would be my last
choice.

I don't fully agree with your comments about migrating users away from
Outlook.  The product that they migrate to would, for one, have to be as
good as Outlook.  I'm not convinced that other products are as good.
Also, non-technical users who are also really busy employees of a
fast-moving company do not have the time to relearn another piece of
software.  Besides that, it's not my choice, and I would be a very
unpopular "office geek" if I said "if we move to Linux, you lose
Outlook...  Sorry".  

I guess the crux of all this discussion is this: There is a real need
for good Outlook/Exchange replacement for Linux.  There is progress
being made by the team at OpenGroupware, which I will watch carefully,
and there are some promising commercial options in Samsung Contact and
Bynari.  It is probably also possible to put together _something_ like
exhange with a bunch of open source products (IMAP, LDAP, etc).
However, nothing truly replaces Exchange.  I reckon that this is what is
holding back many companies from migrating their Windows servers to
Linux.

&gt; I'm not really interested in Evolution, because as you know it's 
&gt; difficult/impossible to convert average Windows/Outlook/Office users 
&gt; to Linux.

They wouldn't know the difference after a while. Think outside the
square.

&gt; Thanks anyway for the info, I have learned a bit more about Evolution 
&gt; out of it, which is always a good thing  :)

OpenExchange can talk to CrapLook but it also has a web-based interface.
It is used at one of the TAFE's in the metropolitan area quite
successfully.
