David,

You might be opening a pandora's box here. What kind of a manager would
be happy to walk into the office and find all the workers arguing about
vi versus emacs, KDE versus Gnome, Mozilla versus Konqueror, bash versus tcsh,
perl versus python, sendmail versus postfix, reiserfs versus ext3,
SuSE versus Redhat versus Debian versus Knoppix versus Gentoo etc.,
GPL versus BSD licence, FreeBSD versus Open BSD, linus versus BSD, etc. etc.
That's alright for us young turks. But managers don't like young turks. 

If I were a manager, I'd give them all VT-100s and make them use csh and vi.
Or I'd make them use Macs.  Remember that deciding _what_ to do is much more
stressful than actually doing it.
Choice is the last thing that business people will want.

In scientific and engineering workplaces which I've had the acquaintance of,
the management have generally looked around and seen a plethora of
Macs, Suns, PCs etc., and have asked "what machine can we all use?".
The result has been the common denominator that the accountants can
cope with, which is the PC with MS software. And the PhDs have ended up with
the same machine on their desk - for compatibility.

If you want businesses to convert, you have to take away the element of choice!

Paul,  As many people have observed, if it weren't for MS, most IT support
people would be out of a job. Would you rather hack linux code on the dole or
support MS users on a full wage? (That's a difficult one, I know...)

Anyway....

Cheers,
ak.
