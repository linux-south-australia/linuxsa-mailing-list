&gt; Well the boss had his computer stolen and he wants something quick. I am
&gt; about ready to buy this:

&gt;
&gt; but my main hesitation is that I don't know much about c3 processors.  I
&gt; am leaning towared that because it looks like it is compatible with
&gt; Linux.  and I assume FreeBSD.
&gt;
&gt; If that was a Pentium III or IV I would get it in a heartbeat.  I am
&gt; just worried that this will be like a Celeron.  DOes anyone know how a
&gt; v3 compares to a Pentium III 700 mhz? Is it better all the way around,
&gt;  or is it missing some cache?

I have owned a VIA C3 and sold it pretty quickly due to the dire lack of
performance, both for integer and especially floating point calculations.
Yes, it was nice running the CPU at 100% load without a fan and feeling it
get moderately warm, but I would strongly recommend against getting a C3
unless you are very sensitive to noise.  Some online retailers were selling
Duron 1.3Ghz CPUs for $69.  Lightyears ahead of any C3 in performance and
cheaper.

It also depends which Celeron you're referring to.  The 300As were fantastic
overclockers, the later &lt;1Ghz generation were quite poor but when they hit
1Ghz they received a full 256kb L2 cache and 100Mhz FSB.  Alas, Celerons
have become terribly crippled again with 128Kb cache choking the P4
architecture.  Mobile Celerons are a little better, with 256kb cache
therefore perform like older P4s.

See ya
