I haven't been at my computer since late last week otherwise I'd have
commented sooner.

On a public mailing list you question the integrity of the SA Branch of 
Computerbank Australia INC. That's an Incorporated body. I'd shut up
while you're ahead.

I just might get us/Computerbank some legal advice as to how to deal
with public comments like yours.

I'm quoting in full here because of a dubious comments in the sig of
Dan's email.

&gt;   Is a citizen subject to the laws of a criminal state? 
&gt;

I can't offer any contact details other than email address.

&gt; 
&gt; Little could be further from the truth. In addition to dubious hardware
&gt; (this might be something to be expected from second hand hardware, but
&gt; consistent denials of problems by members of Computerbank left her feeling
&gt; aggravated, distressed and put down - the machine clearly was faulty with a
&gt; probable hardware conflict as the cause - though this was not accepted
&gt; by people at CB she dealt with).
&gt; 
&gt; After having got the machine to work for her, I find that the kernel 
&gt; running on the machine is 2.4.17 (notoriously buggy), the /etc/fstab entry
&gt; for the cdrom is broken and that KDE is a manky piece of crap (sorry to
&gt; delve into religion here, but why put on an environment that doesn't work
&gt; - my first experience with KDE (3.0.2) was finding the KMail is broken,
&gt; KSpread can't export to Excel (work requirement) and though it says it
&gt; can export to gnumeric, that fails). This really throws an insult at the
&gt; strengths of the underlying system (Debian GNU/Linux). Is providing flakey
&gt; (at best) software in these components likely to enable a computer (and
&gt; most proably a Linux) neophyte to use the machine, given that it takes a
&gt; degree of Linux awareness at least to fix or understand the issues
&gt; involved - I think not.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find myself asking is: What function does Computerbank play in
&gt; South Australia? Is it to provide functional computers to those in need
&gt; and who are in most probability not highly computer literate? Is it to act
&gt; in some degree as a Linux advocacy group? I would have to say that
&gt; Computerbank's efforts fail abysmally in both regards in the experience
&gt; that I have had with it through my friend.
