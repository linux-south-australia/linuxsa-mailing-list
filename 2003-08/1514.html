Hmmmm....

&gt; I to assumed you knew what that URL might be, just like many replies I
&gt; have had in the past from expirienced Linux users, the writers of
&gt; those replies, assume I already know what the heck they mean. SO, the
&gt; moral is, can we get this FIREWALL of mine up and running, and use the
&gt; forum to explain every step of the way, so the writers of help files
&gt; can understand what it's like.

Being a member of an online community is like being a member of any
online community. You need to:

 1) Observe the rules
 2) See (2)

How the rules are set and who sets them is generally a community type
thing. In LinuxSA there are few more aged (in terms of list
participation) than Alan Kennington who has done so, in a very positive
manner, for the past 5 years and more.

You didn't post any explanation of what you wrote.

You didn't have to retype it again (unless you have no idea how to cut
and paste - possible I suppose).

What's your problem with people pointing out that posting URL's with
little explanation is pointless? Seriously, the 14th topic means
absolutely nothing to me :(


DSL

(1) Danger, Will Robinson. Flaming this poster is not a wise thing to
do... ;-P
