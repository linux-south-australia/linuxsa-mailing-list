<H1>[OT] Stuff for sale</H1>

<PRE>
Hi all,

I have some stuff for sale. I wrote a long, descriptive email about it all, 
and then hit send, and the frigging webmail client logged me out without 
warning. Yay. Here's the short version:

If you want any of this stuff, email me off-list, or call me on 0412 827 805. 
I don't want to waste time showing people things, as I have a lot to do before 
I go. I can explain whatever you want over the phone, and describe the 
condition of it, and then, if you want it, you can agree to buy it, and come 
pick it up from North Adelaide.

----
Server, running debian 3.0
  I'll remove all data, passwords and logs before handing over.
  Or, if you want to start from scratch, I'll wipe the HDDs.

----

some stuff, I don't even know what it is. For the most part, I don't want to 
think about this, I don't want to waste time on it, I just want to get rid of 
it. Anything unsold by the weekend (except server and UPS) will be offered to 
ComputerBank, and anything they don't want will be thrown away... 
probably... :)
