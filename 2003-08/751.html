&gt;Damien,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So if Parliament passed a law that forbid people of Asian descent to
&gt;&gt;walk the streets after 10pm, you would abide by it?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Harold Holt terminated that law lawfully prior to Gough's election.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Such a law wouldn't have been inconceivable back in the 60's with the
&gt;&gt;"White Australia" policy (a law passed in our so-called democracy). If
&gt;&gt;you were to disobey this law, I would support you. In fact I'd be out
&gt;&gt;on the streets protesting with you.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Yes, but I'd be protesting before 10 PM.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Stupid Laws should be disobeyed, loudly.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So you are advocating the wilful disregard for the law...

"When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man forty years 
ago on
December 1, 1955, she was tired and weary from a long day of work.  At least
that's how the event has been retold countless times and recorded in our 
history
books. But, there's a misconception here that does not do justice to the 
woman
whose act of courage began turning the wheels of the civil rights 
movement on
that fateful day.  Rosa Parks was physically tired, but no more than you 
or I after
a long day's work. In fact, under other circumstances, she would have 
probably
given up her seat willingly to a child or elderly person. But this time 
Parks was
tired of the treatment she and other African Americans received every 
day of
their lives, what with the racism, segregation, and Jim Crow laws of the 
time."


In that situation, I would indeed.
