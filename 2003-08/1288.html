Considering it's a week-end, it's surprising that things are still
developing a bit in the SCO/linux/virus/worm concept entanglement.
Since my real work is a bit tiring, here's yet another gratuitous round-up:

=================================================================

Eric Raymond asking DOS attacks against SCO to cease:
"Let SCO hang itself."
<A HREF="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid">http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid</A>=03/08/24/1228211&mode=thread&tid=17
Quote:
--------------------
With whatever authority I have, I ask that the DOS attack cease immediately.
Please stand down *now*. We have better ways to win this fight. 
--------------------

My opinion:
It seems that even he has realised there might be a downside to
losing the underdog status. IBM is really _not_ going to like this
unseemly kind of thing. There's a danger they might give up if they think
that the linux community are ratbags. IBM certainly don't want the public
to think they're associated with ratbags.
==================================================================

Then there's this:
"Microsoft Windows: Insecure by Design"
<A HREF="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl</A>=story&cid=1804&ncid=1211&e=1&u=/washpost/20030824/tc_washpost/a34978_2003aug23

This seems to be sort of mainstream, but is surprisingly harsh on MS software,
and talks almost longingly of the lucky Mac and linux users who seem
to be oblivious to the worm/virus thing.
This article should cheer every linuxista.

Quote:
---------------------
The usual theory has been that Windows gets all the attacks because almost
everybody uses it. But millions of people do use Mac OS X (news - web sites)
and Linux, a sufficiently big market for plenty of legitimate software
developers -- so why do the authors of viruses and worms rarely take aim at
either system?

Even if that changed, Windows would still be an easier target. In its default
setup, Windows XP (news - web sites) on the Internet amounts to a car parked in
a bad part of town, with the doors unlocked, the key in the ignition and a
Post-It note on the dashboard saying, "Please don't steal this."
--------------------

This article is nicely written and seems to show that the badness of MS
software is dawning everywhere.
=================================================================

This is a disheartening item on how linux developers (maybe 60%) are
reconsidering embedded linux applications:
"Embedded developers ponder SCO threats"
<A HREF="http://www.it-director.com/article.php?articleid">http://www.it-director.com/article.php?articleid</A>=11176

I'm still waiting for my killer linux PDA to become available.
So I hope the PDA people don't give up trying.

Quote:
---------------------
Nearly 240 of the 400 companies questioned by researchers Evans Data
Corporation indicated that they will evaluate the intellectual property risks
of Linux in light of the SCO lawsuit.
---------------------

=================================================================
And here's just one more from arabnews.com, luckily in English:
"Software Systems: Open or Closed?"
<A HREF="http://www.arabnews.com/?page">http://www.arabnews.com/?page</A>=7&section=0&article=30773&d=24&m=8&y=2003

This has a really clear-cut explanation of what open source means,
presumably for M-E readers, but has some bad bloopers.

Quote:
--------------------
Returning to the IBM vs. SCO fracas, most analysts believe that it will end
without any success for SCO. An amusing development was Microsofts acquiring a
license from SCO. This move on Microsofts part was in order to give legitimacy
to SCOs claims and to provide them with much needed funds to continue their
fight against IBM and Linux.
-------------------

Oh well, back to kernel spaghetti...

CHeers,
ak.
