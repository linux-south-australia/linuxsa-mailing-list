Hi All,
I was just musing, as I do on a Friday after work, about the evils of
insurance companies (and banks and the rest for that matter) when you get 3
different answers from three different people.

Consider.  we have health insurance which I have just upgraded to family
from my wife because of an expected new arrival.    They have twice stuffed
up the automatic credit card payment and I have rung them twice saying what
are you guys doing to be told twice that everything is fine.    But when the
credit card statement was read they had underbilled and as you can imagine
this is a cause for concern when coming to claim a hospital visit.

So, back to my musing.

a)  i was considering making or buying (making is more fun) a little phone
tap that would go between the handset and the phone and plug into the sound
card of a computer.  one would simply record to whatever format one liked.
has anybody had a play with this kind of thing or would it be easier to just
spend the $25 or whatever and go and find something from Jaycar or someone
similar.

b)  obviously, due to current privacy laws and all that kind of guff, one is
supposed to inform the party being recorded that they are.    banks,
insurance companies do it for 'training and quality assurance' purposes.
yeah right, more like to protect themselves.        anyway if one was to
tell the person the other end they we're being recorded that would make it
legal would it not?
if one we're not to tell the other end about such recording and then produce
these recordings as evidence in a court case or whatever, would that
consitute an act that is classed as criminal or whatever all those high
flying lawyers call it?

anyway, just some friday arvo musings.....

have a great w/end all of ya...

regards
Matthew
