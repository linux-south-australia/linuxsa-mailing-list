Hi all,

When a friend can get ADSL in Mt Gambier but I can't even get off a RIM
because their is no cable in my area that doesn't go to that RIM. I live
in Park Holme an OLD suburb and connect to the St Marys exchange. I'm
less than 100 metres from Marion Rd.

This is disgraceful. There is no information as to whether this
situation will ever change.

Services and infrastructure owned by the one government department.
Those departments have been sold off and they took infrastructure with
them. So they hold us to ransom over its use and upgrade.

&gt; Telstra is a communications company with a long history of providing
&gt; high quality (and relatively highly priced) communication services to
&gt; Australia.
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - Telstra has responsibility to deliver voice quality
&gt; telecommunication services to the population of Australia, not ISDN, not
&gt; ADSL, not MessageBank nor any other value added service, the fact they
&gt; do is a bonus. (If you don't like it write to your local member of
&gt; parliament (Federal) and request changes to the USO)
&gt; 
&gt; * It should also be noted under the USO other telecommunication
&gt; companies have the option to bid for the tender to provide these
&gt; services, whilst Optus continue to complain about the fact they
&gt; "Subsidse" (sic) Telstra to the tune of ~$90 million dollars annually
&gt; for the delivery of these services they continue to suggest ways of
&gt; delivery of these services which fail to meet the USO requirements for
&gt; quality of service and have as yet failed to tender for such work.
&gt; 
&gt; Telstra aren't going to undertake vast infrastructure developments
&gt; continually whilst the competitive framework is untenable, why would you
&gt; invest in infrastructure if you have to give access to the competition
&gt; cheaper than you're allowed to sell it in a retail market, competition
&gt; that typically doesn't have the requirement to undertake significant
&gt; capital works projects and operate in one of the most legislated
&gt; industries in Australia.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can't get ADSL then there are indeed a number of viable options.
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - Lobby Telstra on behalf of your local community spelling out to them
&gt; that your area is commercially viable for ADSL to become available. 2 -
&gt; Investigate other data options, DOV, ISDN, Satellite etc etc 3 - Move
&gt; location.
&gt; 
&gt; It seems some Australian's want Telstra to be the most highly
&gt; competitive telecommunications company in the world, delivering best of
&gt; world service whilst offering subsidised infrastructure development to
&gt; all and sundry below their retail price. We also want them to deliver
&gt; huge dividens (the Government some ~2 billion last year) a growing share
&gt; price, cheaper prices to the public and allow competition to flourish,
&gt; you simply can't have it all.
&gt; 
&gt; In short if the vast majority of the population either nor in the future
&gt; want high quality, well priced broadband and other data solutions it
&gt; involves action from all stakeholders, that means:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 - Regulatory framework which involves all stakeholders. (Industry,
&gt; Government, Developers, End users) 2  - Ownership of development issues
&gt; surrounding the reasons for inadequate infrastructure development. (This
&gt; means new land developments contributing to infrastructure as they do
&gt; with most other services) 3 - A realisation that Telstra can't be all
&gt; things to all people and is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think for a minute that privatising Telstra is going to be a good
&gt; outcome for Australia and ongoing infrastructure development in this
&gt; country you are sadly mistaken, a privatised Telstra will lobby all and
&gt; sundry that the legislative requirements for them to service
&gt; unprofitable markets is uncompetitive and if you think areas which have
&gt; no access to services such as ADSL etc will be left further and further
&gt; behind.
