Hiya,

well I have been playing with them for a little while now. Yes, their
perfomrance isnt all that great when compared to what else you can get
for similiar money. But for office apps (windows, for the financial
officer here), it works a treat, and it comes in a funky little cube.
We are actually using them for developing small PBX systems (4 station 2
trunk) with echo cancelation for VOIP. They have a enough grunt to do
it, just :) Changing the code to use 3D-Now! optimization for the
floating point calculations certainly helped things out, but nothing
like it did on a Athlon/Duron :)

I like the fact that you could, if you wanted to, run them of a 12v gel
cel. Check out this link for a heard of little linux robots using
mini-itx mobo's <A HREF="http://www.ai.sri.com/centibots/">http://www.ai.sri.com/centibots/</A>

Cheers,

Ben :)

&gt; &gt; Does anyone here have any experience with Mini-ITX fanless motherboards

&gt; &gt; particularly special needs, apart from needing two network interfaces.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, I use the via's for Linux Thin clients at work in melbourne.  I source 
&gt; them from Sydney, www.everythinglinux.com.au and use a custom PXES image 
&gt; which boots up over the network and logs straight into a windows 2000 
&gt; Terminal server in &lt; 25 sec.  Users don't even know they're running Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; I have one on the way which is the 800Mhz model with a HDD in it.  I plan on 
&gt; using it as a low end, flashy looking workstation.  Performance wise, I 
&gt; _know_ it aint going to compete with my p4 lappy, but that's not what I'm 
&gt; getting it for.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know where these motherboards might be purchased in
&gt; &gt; Adelaide?  I think I'm after the VIA EPIA V-Series.
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't looked
&gt;
