&gt;
&gt; Since the new untimed data calls came into place, I've been interested
&gt; to getting 128k ISDN until ADSL is available to me (I"m on a RIM - I
&gt; live in Gungahlin, ACT). Telstra announced that they will be building a
&gt; new exchange and it should be finished in about 12 months, so I didn't
&gt; want to pay $250 for an ISDN modem, hence why I want to get the NT1+2
&gt; working. When I was looking for information on how to get it going, I
&gt; could hardly find anything (I think I even found one page saying it's
&gt; not possible since it's not supported).
&gt;
&gt; Getting Linux to recognise the modem was easy. If you compiled your own
&gt; kernel, make sure your kernel has the acm USB driver. For some reason I
&gt; couldn't get it working in Gentoo (my main machine) but luckily my
&gt; gateway is running RH8 and it recognised the NT1 and loaded the driver
&gt; automatically when I connected the USB cable. The modem is now visible
&gt; on /dev/ttyACM0.
&gt;
&gt; I already had a dialup connection set up, so I just edited
&gt; /etc/wvdial.conf changed the modem line to point to the above device and
&gt; changed the number, username and password to what was appropriate for my
&gt; newly acquired TSN connection. My init string was only ATZ and using
&gt; that I was able to get a 64k connection.
&gt;
&gt; Looking at Telstra's ISDN CD, there's an extended manual PDF, which
&gt; contains valid AT commands.
&gt;
&gt; To enable 128k, I added !T0=0
&gt; to enable DVO, I added !T4=1
&gt;
&gt; My wvdial now has the lines:
&gt; Init0 = ATZ
&gt; Init1 = AT!T0=0!T4=1
&gt;
&gt; I connected and started downloading something big from planetmirror.com,
&gt; using wget with the --progress=dot option. It was downloading at 14-15k.
&gt; I picked up the phone and the download slowed to something around 7.5k.
&gt; I hung up the phone and it went at 14-15k again.
&gt;
&gt; If it fails to connect saying "NO DIALTONE" triple check your dialup
&gt; phone number. I managed to get mine wrong and since the error message is
&gt; so misleading I thought there was something wrong with the NT1+2 box. It
&gt; took a visit to my house by a Telstra tech, several phone calls by
&gt; Telstra phone support people and 4 days to fix :( Stupid me.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, as you can see it's really easy. /dev/ttyACM0 and !T0=0!T4=1 are
&gt; the important things. I wonder why it was so hard to find this
&gt; information in the first place.
