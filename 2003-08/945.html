&gt; Does anyone here have any experience with Mini-ITX fanless motherboards
&gt; and free O/S (I'm thinking Linux or *BSD here)?  I don't have any
&gt; particularly special needs, apart from needing two network interfaces.

I know Richard Russell has used them (he may have one still).  I was 
going to but ended up buying a PII Compaq Deskpro EN SFF (small form 
factor) box on ebay and adding some ram and a HD I had to it.  Created a 
neat little server for $112 ($72 for the box, $40 for the ram - 
statisfaction of having built it myself - priceless :-)

You can buy some quite cheap little Compaqs with PIIIs on ebay for 
bugger all and it saves having to source some of the bits which end up 
being expensive.  The Compaq SFF boxes are very quiet.

I've got a PII350mhz which happily does linux serving for me (mail, dns, 
web (a few websites totalling 5GB of traffic per month), routing (adsl, 
wireless, ethernet) plus running mrtg, ntop, etc etc.  [this ones got 
builtin ethernet (eepro100) plus I've added an extra 100Mbps and an ISA 
wireless card]

&gt; Does anyone know where these motherboards might be purchased in
&gt; Adelaide?  I think I'm after the VIA EPIA V-Series.

One of the Cisco guys locally bought one recently - I think it was from 
Boost (no affilition, never been a customer).  However, a lot of places 
online will do it (www.eyo.com.au, www.warcom.com.au, etc)

However, unless you really want it the SFF boxes do the job and are much 
much cheaper and save having to build it all up.  [if you do buy one let 
me know I've discovered a few tricks such as which jumper makes it boot 
when power is restored]
