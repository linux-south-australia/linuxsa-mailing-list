&gt; okay, so it's _only_ 30M... some people don't have that much 
&gt; to spare, and 
&gt; don't have the option to buy more memory just so they can 
&gt; have something 
&gt; preloaded. and where will you draw the line? maybe next you 
&gt; want your web 
&gt; browser preloaded... and then your email client... and then 
&gt; what? once you accept that preloading one thing is helpful, 
&gt; you're opening the door 
&gt; to preloading that comes to hundreds of MB of memory that 
&gt; might not even be 
&gt; used before the computer is shut down. and that's a big waste.

Personally, I think that's a great idea. There's nothing I hate more than
waiting for computers (except for when I put milk in my lovingly brewed
coffee -- using the last of the grindings -- only to discover one second too
late that the milk has the consistency of cottage cheese, but not the
flavour). Particularly for a program to load a menu from somewhere. Dammit,
anticipate that I might be likely to click on that menu, and preload, and
even pre-render it for me. RAM is cheap. The average machine these days has
256M, but could easily and affordably have 1G, and to my mind, it's *not*
using it that is the waste... throw a few G of swap in there as well, and if
you are ever *actually* using a lot of RAM, all your unused preloaded stuff
can get swapped out... Only problem with that is the boot or login times
would be atrocious. Unless there could be a static RAM image that gets
loaded in from somewhere, the same every time, like a resume function, but
from a "known good" initial state...
