From: "Richard Russell" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com">richard@yellowgoanna.com</A>&gt;
&gt; Personally, I think we should take another step forward, and seeing as
&gt; Universities are becoming similar to TAFEs and TAFEs similar to
&gt; Universities, and both are focussed on training, I think we should create
a
&gt; new type of education that is actual education, and specifically not
&gt; training. Or perhaps we should attempt to distinguish between degrees that
&gt; are training degrees, and degrees that are education degrees. Maybe we
&gt; already are -- the BSc and BA are actual education, and the rest are
&gt; increasingly training for a career, with some education thrown in for good
&gt; measure.

One thing that immediately comes to mind that TAFE does not do is research.
Universities around the world (especially preeminent institutions) host a
wide variety of researchers and academics.  I'm thinking outside the
computer science-box, namely chemistry, biology, physics, etc.

I have also worked with employers who won't even look at you without a
university degree.  Old fashioned ways of thinking or are they looking for
something specific in their new employees?

University entrance will always be more difficult to achieve and/or more
expensive.
