The NewsForge article is a bit silly. 

The basis of the article is that a guy was caught with child porn on 
his 'puter - 172 pictures - that he claims must have been installed by 
a trojan as he knew nothing about them. At the time he was going 
through a custody case against his ex.

172 pictures were somehow snuck onto his computer without his 
knowledge? Then his start up page was "owned"? 

If that was true then it is likely to have been through a trojan unless 
that was just the tool somebody close to him used to own his system 
then set him up. The only other possibilities were direct access to his 
machine and installing the files or else he lied and the court bought 
his lie. 

I have read the story and the confirmed presence of 12 trojans indicate 
there is a likelihood that the pictures got there without his knowledge 
but that just shows up that most home computers have minimal security 
if the owner had ever understood the concept.

For the NewsForge author to use this case as a story convincing the 
Windows user to leave their supposedly safe and comfortable system and 
come over to the Dark side of OpenSource is simply foolish. It doesn't 
bear up against the facts and the author deserved the beating he got 
from the comment posters.

Cheers,  Ian
