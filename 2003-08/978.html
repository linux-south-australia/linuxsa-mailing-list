&gt; The problem with a lot of Australian banks seemed to be that they only 
&gt; took AUD, That might have changed. If you are pitching to a US audience 
&gt; that might scare them off.

That's less true now - NAB will do multicurrency holding accounts.

&gt; I would much rather have my funds here in an Australian bank than with 
&gt; Paypal.

Agreed.

&gt; If I didn't want to go online transaction, or I had to keep numbers for 
&gt; some purpose (perhaps I needed to be able to rebill someone each month 
&gt; or something). I would probably gnupg the data and send it off the web 
&gt; server immediately. For the paranoid, decrypt offline, print to dead 
&gt; trees, and store under lock and key.

Exactly, just put a public key on the webserver, encrypt with that and it 
effectively becomes one way.  Your only problem is ensuring you don't 

&gt; There seem to be a lot of inbetweens who will charge heaps for 
&gt; transactions. If you can put up with using a local bank, they are 
&gt; probably going to be much cheaper per transaction.

The Camtech solution had the advantage in that it could switch between 
banks, so if you were large you could get it to clear directly with 
whichever bank had the cc, assuming you had multiple accounts with various 
banks.  This gave a number of the large merchants some control and 
negotiation with the banks (as well as some redundancy - the banks weren't 
the most reliable thing - they'd randomly take their network offline with no 
warning).

&gt; I don't know much about camtechs solution, but last I saw, they had a 
&gt; java wallet thing. I really,really hate java in my web browser.

Ah, you haven't looked in a few years - the wallet was only used for the 
rego renewal thing.  It's all java but you run it either via the api or via 
a commandline (or equiv) tool on your webserver.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Brendan,
&gt; &gt;&gt;Several things:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Talk to some banks.  You'll need a merchant account and ultimately
&gt; &gt;&gt;you'll have to play along with them.  Most of them now have online
&gt; &gt;&gt;transaction systems.  Camtech (where I used to work) offered an Ecommerce
&gt; &gt;&gt;system to do this, not sure of the current state.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Checking them out right now.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;Second, WHY would you be storing the cc numbers?  Why wouldn't you be
&gt; &gt;&gt;sending the cc straight to the bank (eg. Westpac, NAB, etc all have
&gt; &gt;&gt;facilities for this) and then storing only an obscured pan (first 6, last
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 4
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;digits) for verification?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yeah, that's the thing. I wasn't even sure of how the whole process works if
&gt; &gt; you do it within your own site.. like checking for valid details, then
&gt; &gt; sending them to some third-party to process them, doing all this securely,
&gt; &gt; then getting the money back to me easily. Because the transactions will be
&gt; &gt; small i'm hoping it won't cost heaps. But yeah, i just contacted my bank, so
&gt; &gt; they should give me some more info.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;G'day,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This isn't really Linux specific, but i'm sure there's some people here
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; with
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;experience in this area. What i want to do is allow credit card
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; transactions
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;on a planned site. I've looked at all the third-party credit card
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; handlers
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;like PayPal and WorldPay etc, but they all give that amateurish look to
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;site.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, the server will have some security i'd imagine, it's hosted at
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;rackshack.net. But what about storing credit card numbers? I doubt it's
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;good idea to store the details on the actual server. How would say
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;EverythingLinux do it? And then after all this i have to worry about
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; what to
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;do with them.. etc. And how to even get them back to me securely since
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;server is in the US.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Actually having second thoughts about it now. It'd probably cost me an
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; arm
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and a leg to get a merchant account or whatever i need - infact anyone
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;more info on this, like how to debit credit cards etc, or getting them
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;like a bank to take care of them? Would i do this during the transaction
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; on
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the website?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I should probably buy a book on e-commerce or something..
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;If anyone can give me an outline of the whole process of doing it
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; yourself
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;etc then that'd be a big help - or if you know of a third-party that
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; handles
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;all this and allows it to be done securely still without having to exit
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;website. I'd prefer an Australian one so i can simply get the money
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;transferred to a bank account.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Cheers,
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Brendan
