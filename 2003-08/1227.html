(the below is my understanding)

Without the consent of all concerned the recording can not be given in
evidence.

About 2 years ago I attended a conference hosted by the office of the small
business advocate (sa).

I asked a police officer presant what the laws were regarding recording
telephone conversations.

The understanding I got from this is that under the electronic or telephone
interception act (or something named similar) it is illegal it connect a
device to a phone service to intersept conversation.

The idea of the suction cap listerning devise again is only legal if consent
is given.

Some home users overcome the intersept laws by using a handsfree phone and
use a tape deck or microphone near by to record the conversation, which is
not physcially connected to the phone. While legal it is inadmissable.

As for "for coaching and training purposes your call may be monitored,
please advise if you would like this not to occur" means that legally the
company can only use the recording for that purpose.

If you call a company (typicall security monitoring stations, 000 or the
police assitance line) you will hear an announcment that the call will be
recorded and you will also hear a record tone.

Any security company that is running a grade a monitor centre is required by
industry standards to record all calls and there is of course policy to
cover this.

Again this is my own viewpoint, some of which could be incorrect

regards,

Ian.
