 &gt; When I read the way they intended to issue the licences last

If I was a Linux kernel developer, I'd be standing-by for SCO's
public revelation of which code they claim to own.

If it turns out that I (as a hypothetical Linux kernel developer)
actually wrote it, I'd be getting ready to rip 'em a new one.
Because I'd be the owner of the copyright in that code;  And that
means I'd have the exclusive monopoly right to charge licensing 
fees for it;  And SCO would have knowingly and fraudulently 
usurped that (copy)right from me by demanding licensing fees from
everyone (or anyone).

SCO is, I believe in a position where they're either 100% right, or
they're dead.  If this issue doesn't proceed according to their plan,
it's not like they can shuffle their feet and say, "Aww, shucks, you
got me."  They're going to get annhiliated by the legitimate owner
of the code they're trying to pass off as their intellectual property.

They only need to be wrong once.  If they make 50 claims, it doesn't
matter if 49 of them are legitimate:  the way they've gone about this
has put enough people off-side and given enough people enough incentive
to completely obliterate them that they can't possibly hope to come 
out of this intact.
