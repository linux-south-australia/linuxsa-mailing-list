&gt;&gt; Ouch. The thot plickens.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So back to the part about SCO owning the rights to the code,
&gt;&gt; do you think they do now that you have seen an extract of
&gt;&gt; what they call "offending" code?
&gt;
&gt; I have no way of answering that question, but I reckon that if it
&gt; turns out that SCO can collect more than 10 cents per user for this
&gt; thing, there will be a mass exodus out of linux and into the BSDs.
&gt; If I were operating a BSD download site right now, I'd be looking
&gt; around for an increased number of mirrors real quick if the plot
&gt; really does thicken!  I hope FreeBSD has all the drivers I need for
&gt; all of my machines...

If not, it's open source.  You can write your own :-)

&gt; On the other hand, if you were going to show 50 lines of offending
&gt; code, you would show your strongest, most incontrovertible 50 lines
&gt; rather than your weakest, and these might be the tip of a very small
&gt; iceberg.

Indeed.  You'd think so.  I suspect, though, that the people who are
doing this, though programmers, don't really understand the
implications of what they've done.  

&gt; That would explain why they're so reluctant to let the lines go
&gt; public -- so as to ensure that they're not removed -- if the
&gt; offending code was extensive, then surely it would be impossible to
&gt; remove it easily, and therefore there would be no "danger" from the
&gt; sco point of view that they it might be removed easily.

A pity for SCO that their best example was such poor code that the
Linux community removed it a month before they "divulged" it.  Just
goes to show that waiting isn't necessarily a good thing.
