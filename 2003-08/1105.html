Even if they were then removed, surely just grabbing an old version of the
kernel from somewhere would still show the code which is illegal, right?  I
don't think merely removing the code would get IBM out of trouble.

&gt; Ouch. The thot plickens.
&gt; 
&gt; So back to the part about SCO owning the rights to the code, do you 
&gt; think they do now that you have seen an extract of what they call 
&gt; "offending" code?

Ian,

I have no way of answering that question, but I reckon that if it turns out
that SCO can collect more than 10 cents per user for this thing, there will
be a mass exodus out of linux and into the BSDs.  If I were operating a BSD
download site right now, I'd be looking around for an increased number of
mirrors real quick if the plot really does thicken!  I hope FreeBSD has all
the drivers I need for all of my machines...

On the other hand, if you were going to show 50 lines of offending code, you
would show your strongest, most incontrovertible 50 lines rather than your
weakest, and these might be the tip of a very small iceberg. That would
explain why they're so reluctant to let the lines go public -- so as to
ensure that they're not removed -- if the offending code was extensive, then
surely it would be impossible to remove it easily, and therefore there would
be no "danger" from the sco point of view that they it might be removed
easily.

Cheers,
ak.
