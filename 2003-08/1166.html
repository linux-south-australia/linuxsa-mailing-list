I hope you don't think my last post was an attack, but I took exception 
to one phrase in it.

Below is a good point though. I think as Corey said this goes for BSDs 
as well and it is more a tech culture. Typically tech culture is a 
meritocracy and you have to earn respect.

There are some really arrogant pricks administering Microsoft systems as 
well (unfortunately they still vastly outnumber us). How many of them 
offer unpaid tech support after hours?

One of the neat things about linux is that we have access to some of the 
people behind the scenes. I don't expect them to behave like customer 
service operators or PR people because they aren't.

On the other hand if we look at initiatives putting linux in education, 
computerbank, linuxconf, linuxsa meetings, installfests we can see that 
there are some people devoting a lot of their time and effort to being 
the friendly side of Linux.

&gt; people like me understand. However, this is not always the case.
