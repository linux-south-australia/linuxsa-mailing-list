Oh I almost forgot mailing list etiquette; a little about me. :-)

My name is Corey Taylor. I'm part Aboriginal, part Scot, part Polynesian and
grew up in the rough end of town in Mansfield Park. I went to Woodville High
and Adelaide Uni where I did a BSc., doing the dual chem majors (Physical &
Inorganic and Organic). I've worked in the gov for a couple of years now,
mainly doing data, stats and the occasional teaching stint. I'm a musician
(was semi-pro at one stage before reality killed me) and play a few sports.

I got into Linux in a Micoshyte-induced frenzy of BSoD's and 'Unhandled
Exception Errors'. I walked into a computer shop and saw Red Hat 7.0. I
grabbed it, saw the $80 price tag and thought "Wow, that'd WAAAAY cheaper
than Windows!" and bagged it. I took it home, installed it and realised I
had NFI about what to do next. I saw the command-line and some of my old
Unix knowledge from my BSc. Came flooding back. I started reading and bang,
I'm now a Linux user. Still learning of course but I stumble my way through
with a combination of brains and damn good luck. :-)

Anyway, that'll do for now. Thanks guys and it's good to be on this list as
I could do with some local help.
