<H1>low usage of swap?</H1>

I've got an old system (200MHz CPU, 64M RAM, anyone?), and the RAM just isn't 
enough, so anytime I'm in X I'm using swap. that's okay, but there are some 
curiosities. I started off with 128M swap, and about 65M of it would be used, 
even when the system needed a lot more, the disk grind when swapping apps 
wasn't too nice either. 8^( so I went up to 228M swap... now my swap usage 
will go up to about 130M or so... is there some setting that says you can't 
go much over half? I mean, keeping some in reserve for emergencies would make 
some sence, but I can see a fair bit of improvement if my system were to use 
some of the other 100-odd meg of swap... any suggestions on how to 
fix/adjust?

also, the 128 is a swap partition, the other 100 is two swap files, and it 
seems the files are significantly slower... is there perhaps a way to make 
linux use the partition to its fullest before using the files?

thanks in advance

I'm running
linux 2.4.20 (I compiled it myself, so there's a fair chance I messed 
something up, but I don't recall anything about swap)
slackware 9.0 (and in some places slack 8.1 packages)
