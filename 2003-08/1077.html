Hi all,
I do not normally post, however this really got me annoyed.

  Community: SCO Use of Samba Code Under the GPL
Aug 20, 2003, 00 :00 UTC (30 Talkback[s]) (5880 reads)
(Other stories by Jeremy Allison)

[ Thanks to Jeremy Allison - Samba Team for this release. ]

Over the past few months, the SCO (Santa Cruz Operation) Corporation 
(formerly Caldera International, Inc. a Linux distribution vendor) has been 
complaining about violations of its Copyright works by the Linux kernel code.

Recently, Darl McBride, the Chief Executive Officer of SCO has been making 
pejorative statements regarding the license used by the Linux kernel, the 
GNU GPL. In a keynote speech he recently said :

"At the end of the day, the GPL is not about making software free; it's 
about destroying value."

In light of this it is the depths of hypocrisy that at the same event SCO 
also announced the incorporation of the Samba3 release into their latest 
OpenServer product. Samba is an Open Source/Free Software project that 
allows Linux and UNIX servers to interoperate with Microsoft Windows 
clients. The reason for this is clear; Samba3 allows Linux and UNIX servers 
to replace Microsoft Windows NT Domain Controllers and will add great value 
to any Operating System which includes it. However, Samba is also developed 
and distributed under the GNU GPL license, in exactly the same manner as 
the Linux kernel code that SCO has been criticizing for its lack of care in 
ownership attribution.

We observe that SCO is both attacking the GPL on the one hand and 
benefiting from the GPL on the other hand. SCO can't have it both ways. SCO 
has a clear choice: either pledge not to use any Open Source/Free Software 
in any of their products, or actively participate in the Open Source/Free 
Software movement and reap the benefits. For SCO to continue to use Open 
Source/Free Software while attacking others for using it is the epitome of 
hypocrisy.

The strength of Open Source/Free Software is that it is available to all 
without restrictions on fields of endeavor, as the Samba Team believes the 
ability to freely use, modify and learn from software code is one of the 
grounding principles of computer science, and a basic freedom for all.

Because of this, we believe that the Samba must remain true to our 
principles and be freely available to use even in ways we personally 
disapprove of.

Even when used by rank hypocrites like SCO.
