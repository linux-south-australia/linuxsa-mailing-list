&gt;  ..snippety-snip..
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Tertiary qualified
&gt;
&gt; I'm curious, why do people place this in IT job advertisements?
&gt;
&gt; Good reasons I can think of are:
&gt;  * Weed out the spaghetti coders, undocumented-init-bash-script-ers,
&gt; etc. (Supposing that tertiary educated people are generally better).
&gt;  * Can be certain (depending upon the degree studied) that they've
&gt; learnt about quality control, standards, and other "good practices".
&gt;
&gt;  ..and probably more that I haven't written.
&gt;
&gt;  But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've dropped it
&gt; for various reasons. If I am capable of self-learning and read books
&gt; at a uni library, play with linux, do some work for people, work
&gt; _with_ people more knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just
&gt; as suitable for a job as someone who has a "Tertiary Qualification"?

To be fair, in an advertisement, as my boss says "look for the ideal
candidate".

We did discuss this and that was the wording decided.

I meet a guy recently that didn't finish year 10 but is running his
own
computer support business and is damn good too. So, I agree. If you,
as an applicant show all the relavent skills and have the right
attitude
and look like you'd fit in here at ratbag, you'd prolly stand a fair
chance =)

cheers,

Kim Hawtin
