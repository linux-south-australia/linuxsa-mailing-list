&gt;&gt; Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can anyone help with the following:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When I start a terminal in Xwindows and login as &lt;user&gt; then su to
&gt;&gt; superuser, $PATH stays the same as the setting for &lt;user&gt; even when I
&gt;&gt; have set the PATH variable under /root/.bash_profile?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Where do I set the PATH variable? For example I want it to include /sbin
&gt;&gt; and /usr/sbin for root with an X terminal (started with &lt;user&gt; and
&gt;&gt; su'd). /etc/profile includes /sbin and /usr/sbin for root, but only if I
&gt;&gt; login as root from a login prompt!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How do I get rid of the annoying "No such file or directory" even if all
&gt;&gt; the directories DO exist, for example: logging in as root from the login
&gt;&gt; prompt, then typing $PATH gives me all the paths I want with the "No
&gt;&gt; such file or directory" appended, when the directories all exist?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thanks,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; kind regards,
&gt;&gt; Luke

&gt; Luke,
&gt;
&gt;     If you have a read at the man page for `su` you'll see that if you 
&gt; include the "-" in the command it will use the user's environment. eg: 
&gt; `su - root` or `su -`.  The `su` command if you are not already aware 
&gt; can su to any user but the default user is root if no name is 
&gt; specified hence the `su -`.  Your issue about just typing in $PATH is 
&gt; that you are missing one important thing.  You are typing it in on the 
&gt; "command" line so therefore it expects a command.  When you expand the 
&gt; variable $PATH all by itself after running su to root it should say 
&gt; something simliar to:
&gt;
&gt; su: /sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin: No such file or directory.
&gt;
&gt; Now the command that you have told the shell to run in this case is 
&gt; "/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin".  As you can tell this is not a 
&gt; command.  What you are looking for is this `echo $PATH`.
&gt; Now if you still feel like changing the $PATH variable for all users 
&gt; after they have su'd to the approriate user, it becomes a little more 
&gt; involved because as far as I know you'll have to recompile it with the 
&gt; default $PATH built in.  Before you do that though try using the "-" 
&gt; and see if that fixes your problems first.
&gt;
&gt; Chris-
&gt;
BTW just to correct something I just said.  You do NOT have to recompile 
su.  The man page for `su` will tell you exactly what you have to do in 
order to change the $PATH.  Again though like I said try using the `su 
-` first.

Chris-
