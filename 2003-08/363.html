&gt; &gt; Tertiary qualified
&gt; 
&gt; I'm curious, why do people place this in IT job advertisements?

Here's my stab at some reasons:

* It's a moron-filter. Sure, you lose some potentially good people who are
underqualified, but in today's jobscape, that's not much to lose. Anyone who
really wants the job but isn't qualified will still apply anyway, but you
weed out the just-left-school-and-want-a-summer-job type (which you don't
get many of in winter, but I digress).

* Culture. Tertiary education homogenises to some degree, and if you are in
a place where everyone has some sort of tertiary qualification, you'll fit
in better if you do too.

* Lower risk. You know you're getting at least a certain level. It's a
fairly low level, but you have to be capable of tying your own shoelaces and
constructing a sentence to get any sort of tertiary qualification here.

* An acheivement. You weed out those who can't stick with the one thing for
more than a week.

* Targetting. They aren't looking for someone who is a genius and highly
experienced. They want someone who is intelligent, has proven it, and wants
an entry level position.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;  But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've 
&gt; dropped it for various reasons. If I am capable of 
&gt; self-learning and read books at a uni library, play with 
&gt; linux, do some work for people, work _with_ people more 
&gt; knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just as suitable 
&gt; for a job as someone who has a "Tertiary Qualification"?

You probably could... However, to those who don't know you, you instantly
carry a higher risk...
