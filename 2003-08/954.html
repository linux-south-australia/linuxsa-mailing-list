Conrad,

Here's a credible unfolding of the scenario, in my amateur opinion:

1.	Last year, SuSE pays money to a company which gets a court in
	Germany to stop distribution of SuSE because they allege that
	an item on the K menu popup has a word which they "own" through
	trademark.

2.	SCO collects lots of money from lots of companies.

3.	Other comapanies see the pattern and start suing Redhat,
	SuSE etc. for patent infingement, trademarks, copyrights, etc. etc.

4.	Several companies in the USA band together to form the SIAA:
	Software Industry Association of America.

5.	The SIAA requires Redhat, SuSE, Debian, etc. etc. to pay
	a per-CPU fee for the use of "their IP", and to "protect"
	the linux distributors from legal suits.

6.	MS announces that "We can no longer stand on the sidelines while
	shareholder value is eroded by reckless disregard for
	intellectual property law. Therefore we are joining the SIAA."

7.	The major linux distributions are all either forced to pay
	per-CPU licences or else decide to close down.

8.	Private individuals who "share" linux software on the net and
	continue to develop it are served legal notices in the same way
	that the RIAA is pursuing people now. Through international treaties,
	the USA is able to force other countries to crack down on offenders
	against US IP laws. The Australian government carries out a highly
	publicized raid against a pirate linux copying operation in Sydney.
	The infamous "g" is arrested in Adelaide while waiting for a flight
	to an unnamed European country. Documents and file servers are seized.
	US government praises swift action by the Australian government.
	The Pompous Mongrel suggests a possible link to Al Qaida...

9.	Leading linux developers including Torvalds and Cox are compelled
	to reach a settlement with the SIAA which includes transfer of
	ownership of copyrights in linux to the SIAA. Minor developers are
	warned to cease development of infringing software and desist from
	further distribution of pirate software. An amnesty is offered
	to developers who agree to sign over all copyrights.

10.	The SIAA announces the availability of "Freedom Linux", which
	is a fully licensed linux approved by the SIAA - it gives you
	freedom from lawsuits, and does not contain any applications which
	compete with MS software, and does not give you the source
	for anything because of the danger that developers may
	violate IP laws by creating derivative products from the source.
	A media release by MS states that: "We welcome the restoration of
	stolen intellectual property to users. Freedom Linux customers
	can now breathe easily in the knowledge that their software
	investment is fully protected."

Since governments make laws, and there is no law which effectively prevents a
government from making bad laws, the rules can be made to favour vested
interests via policy payola "in the national interest".  Since linux does not
have a big "lobbying budget", why should any government legislate in favour of
linux or open source generally?

The current world patent system is strongly reminiscent of the monopolies sold
by governments in the 18th century in Europe, where governments raised revenue
by granting monopolies for individual market sectors.  Nowadays people shake
their heads and gasp at the rampant corruption of those days of monopolies. But
governments grant hundreds of monopolies on ideas every day now. People of the
future will gasp and shake their heads!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Of course, the above unfolding is only a crazed dream, isn't it?  It can't
happen. Common sense will prevail, won't it? This just shows that I shouldn't
compose an e-mail on an empty stomach. Where is my coffee? It's time to get
back to "reality"....
