&gt;  SCO has authorized 45 million new shares at a par value of
&gt;  1/10th cent per share. With only 13.5 million shares
&gt;  outstanding, issuing even part of this hoard will
&gt;  significantly dilute shareholder value. Some has already
&gt;  been issued to provide SCO executives with lucretive stock
&gt;  options, and these executives have been selling shares at a
&gt;  very high profit.

Isn't that odd...  If a cricketer puts a $100 bet on their own game,
they are fined heavily and can be ejected from the game in disgrace.
But executives are given (almost) free gambling money to bet on themselves.
There's something screwy going on here...
It seems to be inherent in the system!

CHeers,

PS. On the Aduva code to purge SCO code out of linux, there's this:
<A HREF="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID">http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID</A>=13000458
--- In the event that SCO prevails in the courts, Aduva's OnStage, which the company unveiled Wednesday in San Francisco, could be used by IT staffs to sniff servers for the Linux code determined to be in violation--and then, from one console, install non-proprietary, community-developed replacement code.

<A HREF="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1212131,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1212131,00.asp</A>
--- "We've been busy talking with a lot of enterprise customers and we're seeing them continue to evaluate Linux, particularly in test environments," Van Tuin said. "We've seen some hold back because of the SCO pressurefor instance we're seeing the more conservative companies hold back because they're looking for someone to indemnify them."

-----------------------------------------
About SuSE's "discomfort" with SCO within "UnitedLinux", there's this:
<A HREF="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,83840,00.html">http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,83840,00.html</A>
--- In an interview here, Richard Seibt, CEO of SuSE, acknowledged the absence of UnitedLinux at the show and said that since SCO filed its lawsuit, an "uncomfortable situation" has developed between the two companies. "I have made it clear that we are re-evaluating our relationship with SCO," he said. 

--- The next version of UnitedLinux could be labeled "Powered by SuSE Linux," instead of the "Powered by UnitedLinux" tag that's now used by each of the partners, Seibt said. "It's a natural progression that the next version of UnitedLinux is [renamed as] SuSE Linux."

--- SuSE and SCO do still discuss issues related to customers and UnitedLinux, but they are "short conversations," Seibt said. "It is certainly not something that we wanted them to do," he said of the lawsuit against IBM. 

-----------------------------------------
A fairly long comment on the whole SCO thing:
<A HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/06/HNscobump_1.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/06/HNscobump_1.html</A>
--- Analysts at the show said that SCO's lawsuit was having a small, if measurable, impact on Linux customers. Forrester Research Inc. analyst Ted Schadler said that about one-quarter of the Linux users he had surveyed reported that the lawsuit had at least slowed down their Linux deployments. Schadler said this was chiefly occurring as companies consulted with lawyers and evaluated their legal liabilities, a response that he viewed as prudent. "If you're going to procure open source, you ought to be asking these questions," he said.

--- IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky had a different interpretation of the lawsuit's effect. "It's having little impact other than that SCO's reputation is degrading rapidly," he said.
