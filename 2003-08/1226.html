A few minutes ago, this article appeared:

"SCO reveals 'stolen code'"
<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article">http://www.theinquirer.net/?article</A>=11162

It's a summary article of things we've heard of before, but it does 
show what sort of consensus is developing in the IT media.
Most articles are now saying that SCO does have some sort of leg to stand on.
(They also mention a certain Greg Lehey.)

Sample:
======================================================
According to these analyses, it's a version of an ancient piece of code, dating
back to at least 1973, and published in a half dozen contexts and under just as
many licenses, some of them Open Source. So far so good for the Linux
community; unfortunately the DNA fingerprinting implies that it is a descendent
of the version in SCO's proprietary System V Unix, a version that on the face
of it can't be used for Open Source projects. Another sticky point is that the
Copyright ownership is listed in the file in question as being SGI's, yet it's
pretty clear that the Copyright belongs to SCO: Regardless of what Open Source
license SCO licensed its code under, you can't normally delete someones
Copyright notice and substitute your own.

So at the very least, SGI has some explaining to do. Perhaps it has the right
to do what it wants with that code, perhaps it messed up.

And the Linux community? You would think that they would be rushing to remove
the incriminating code, so that the upcoming Linux 2.6 release could at least
be free of this "living fossil" of the software world. But as it turns out it
was already removed because a) the copyright situtation was unclear and b) it
wasn't very good code, and Linux already had some code that did the same thing
and was better.
======================================================

Cheers,

PS. There's also this short summary from Gringoland:
"SCO undermines its own Linux lawsuit"
<A HREF="http://star-techcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file">http://star-techcentral.com/tech/story.asp?file</A>=/2003/8/22/technology/6120667&sec=technology

and this rather long, detailed interview with an SCO lawyer from Pommyland:
"SCO's legal gun takes aim at Linux"
<A HREF="http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020415,39115872,00.htm">http://insight.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020415,39115872,00.htm</A>

and this medium-length commentary on the issue, also from Pommyland:
"Linux: no longer free?"
<A HREF="http://uk.gsmbox.com/news/mobile_news/all/97101.gsmbox">http://uk.gsmbox.com/news/mobile_news/all/97101.gsmbox</A>
form which this quote:

======================================================
For the moment, the situation gives the advantage to SCO, which has seen its
stock prices rise vertiginously, right now that the Group would like to buy its
rival company Vultus. Uncertainty reigns among the thousands of companies that
distribute or sell Linux, who have already been advised through a letter from
the same SCO Group about the possibility of legal action for presumed copyright
violations. For the moment only one company has accepted to pay SCO for the
licence to be able to integrate Linux into its systems. But it is not certain
that others will not follow. The one who is waiting and watching (and laughing)
is without a doubt Microsoft, which can only take advantage of this battle.

Will this be the end of Linux as free software? At least this time we would
like to be optimistic. It is much better to keep Linux free and accessible,
also from the economic point of view, than to leave the world of software once
again in the hands of the giant from Redmond. Which has been afraid for some
time...afraid of the penguin.
