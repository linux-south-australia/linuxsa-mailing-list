&gt; hmmm ... is TAFE not a Tertiary education institution.

TAFE is.

&gt; 
&gt; is that not what our ideal candidate could be educated at?

Quite likely.

I think the conversation, at least, from my perspective had shifted to the
value of University as opposed to "Tertiary Education"...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A computer science degree is about programming and the theory of
&gt; how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things work.  Just like a chemistry degree is about the theory
&gt; of how
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; atoms interact, not about how to be a lab assistant, even though
&gt; you may
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learn those skills along the way.
&gt; 
&gt; I would have to say, I learned more in six months in front of 
&gt; my Linux box in my first year at Uni than i did in the rest 
&gt; of the Degree. However, I learnt more about how to deal with 
&gt; people and finish assignments etc in the rest of that seven 
&gt; years (studing part time, working full time).

Maybe your experience of Uni was different to some others... But still, the
people skills, and finishing assignments are important, aren't they?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is the point that appears to be missed. The unfortunate thing
&gt; is that
&gt; &gt; people and industry are now demanding that a Computer Science degree
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; be about getting certifications and learning buzz-word language X,
&gt; and the
&gt; &gt; universities are being forced into doing it by our wonderfully
&gt; long-sighted
&gt; &gt; government (yay!).
&gt; 
&gt; We were taught C (some C++), SQL and APL throughout our 
&gt; course, although, Java, TCL, VB and a miriad of new funky 
&gt; (and limited) languages came and went.
&gt; 
&gt; The most useful language that I learnt in that time would 
&gt; have to be C. As its still in wide use, but C++ is more 
&gt; relavent in modern development shops outside of Unix i 
&gt; think(maybe im wrong). shell scripting would be the second 
&gt; most useful language =) but APL i enjoyed the most =)

I think University should teach useless languages.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Personally, I think we should take another step forward, and seeing
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; Universities are becoming similar to TAFEs and TAFEs similar to
&gt; Universities,
&gt; &gt; and both are focussed on training, I think we should create a new
&gt; type of
&gt; &gt; education that is actual education, and specifically not training.
&gt; Or perhaps
&gt; &gt; we should attempt to distinguish between degrees that are training
&gt; degrees,
&gt; &gt; and degrees that are education degrees. Maybe we already are -- the
&gt; BSc and
&gt; &gt; BA are actual education, and the rest are increasingly training for
&gt; a career,
&gt; &gt; with some education thrown in for good measure.
&gt; 
&gt; If you want to academic type things and learn something you 
&gt; want to learn, you stay on and do your honurs then PhD?  is 
&gt; that how it works?

Partially... The problem I'm pointing at is that the Comp Sc and other
technical degrees are no longer equivalent to degrees like a BSc or a BA,
because they are practically focussed, teaching skills rather than
educating. Perhaps we have moved education up the chain in Computer Science,
I don't know...
