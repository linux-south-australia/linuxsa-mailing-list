&gt;Damien,

&gt;&gt;What I would love to see is an Experienced Linux/Unix admin 
&gt;&gt;and an Experienced Windows admin be given a budget to setup 
&gt;&gt;systems for a given specification. 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Great idea, although initial setup is only one thing. Ongoing
&gt;maintenance is another factor which is generally more important.
&gt;
Agreed.

&gt;A company looks at what it is going to totally cost overall, for a
&gt;specific period of time. You understand TCO right?
&gt;  
&gt;
In my experience, Damien does understand total cost of ownership.



****************Our costs go _down_ in proportion with our use of 
Linux*******************************


Part of my job is to go around and perform the updates periodically.  We 
dual boot SuSE Linux and Windows 2000, so I go around and update both 
operating systems on the same day.  Just this past weekend, it took me 4 
hours to update each workstation with Windows patches and antivirus 
software, whilst it took less than an hour to do the same thing in SuSE 
Linux, on the same number of machines, plus one.


&gt;&gt;The spec shouldn't say anything about legacy file format 
&gt;&gt;support, as that unfairly biases towards Windows. 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Err, mmm right....
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The spec should just say what sorts of 
&gt;&gt;things the client wants to do. 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;And then you say this??? So what exactly do you want?? You want to see a
&gt;comparision between operating systems and software on a non real world
&gt;basis, 
&gt;
Assuming client needs are not 'real world' unless those needs are filled 
with Microsoft tools is outlandish, not his statement.

&gt;If the client wants to run an access database, and say a Windows
&gt;specific contact management program, what are you going to suggest. 
&gt;  
&gt;
The question presupposes that better alternatives will not be suggested 
or accepted.

If the client really wants to use Microsoft Access, they can in Linux, 
using Cross Over Office. That's what I use. However, as I become 
familiar with MySQL and the KDE database program called Knoda, I 
question the need to use or pay for Microsoft Access at all.

&gt;For goodness sake in some circumstances what the clients
&gt;needs/wants/requires is what you have to be prepared to supply. 
&gt;  
&gt;
I am sure that he understands that if the client really wants to make a 
bad business decision, he will do it.

&gt;After that work with them, and give them a clear road map of how porting
&gt;various systems and using various opensource solutions can help them
&gt;out.
&gt;
&gt;People need to think before they speak. 
&gt;

No one is perfect:

&gt;David,
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; However, the moment I'm in the "to" or "cc" field of a 
&gt;&gt;&gt; message I get dual
&gt;&gt;&gt; messages:
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;  1) in my inbox
&gt;&gt;&gt;  2) other in linuxsa
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;See if you were using Outlook + Exchange you wouldn't get this problem
&gt;:-) The extra copy just disappears and you only ever see one copy, I
&gt;think it's another inbuilt "feature" :-)
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Joseph
&gt;
Procmail does that as well.

Cheers,

James Leone
