The google news has got some stimulating reading for us today:

This one is very disheartening for the forces of enlightenment:
<A HREF="http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-5065422.html">http://news.com.com/2100-1016_3-5065422.html</A>
Sample:
==================================================
After viewing the code, Don Price, general manager of Price Data Systems, said
he was surprised at the volume that was allegedly copied. "It's compelling," he
said. "Some people were either extremely sloppy, or copied and thought no one
would go after them."

Neil Abraham, with SCO reseller Kerridge Computer, said SCO made the right
decision to pursue IBM. "I think they've got a very firm case," he said, after
looking at the code. "It's not just one line. It's huge chunks." 
=================================================

This one is disheartening for the forces of darkness:
<A HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/19/HNscocode_1.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/19/HNscocode_1.html</A>
Sample:
================================================
The creator of Linux said he is not surprised by Perens analysis. "It sure as
hell looks like it's BSD-licensed and has been around forever," Linus Torvalds
said in an e-mail interview. "This was what we claimed was the likely source of
any common code in the first place: BSD code and various vendor stuff." 
================================================

"SCO says its code can't be cut from Linux"
<A HREF="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1143097">http://www.vnunet.com/News/1143097</A>
Sample:
================================================
"Taking out that code would be like trying to take out the middle 30 floors of
a 60-storey building. The top floors will fall and crush those below," he said.

[...]
SCO maintains that its code is primarily found in Linux dealing with several
key areas: Non-Uniform Memory Access, Read Copy Update, journalled file system,
XFS, Schedulers, Linux PowerPC 32- and 64-bit support and enterprise volume
management systems.

[...]
"This shows 80 lines out of 100 that are completely identical to System V code.
This should not be in Linux," said Chris Sontag, senior vice president and
general manager at SCO Source. 
================================================

These all seem to have 19 August dates, but they're US timezone dates.

which leads to....

Linux community scoffs at SCO's evidence
<A HREF="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5066410.html">http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5066410.html</A>
=================================================
 "It makes it just a really tough burden of proof to prove that it's yours,
when you're dealing with open-source stuff," said William Coats, a partner at
Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe who is not involved in the case. "This isn't
your typical case. SCO's sort of taking a flier on this whole thing, but
there's lots of potential upside." 
[...]

 "Let's say you have a hundred files, and you put one of your hundred files
under the GPL (GNU General Public License). That doesn't mean you've lost the
rights to your other 99 files," Heise said. "So I don't think it's going to
have an impact." 
=================================================

Torvalds Slams SCO
<A HREF="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1227128,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1227128,00.asp</A>
An entertaining interview with linus:
=================================================
Torvalds: They are smoking crack. Their slides said there are [more than]
800,000 lines of SMP code that are "infringing," and they are just off their
rocker. The SMP code was written by a number of Linux people I know well (I did
a lot of the SMP IRQ scalability myself, personally), so their claims are just
ludicrous. And they claim they own JFS [journaled file system technology] too.
Whee. They're not shy about claiming ownership of other people's codewhile at
the same time beating their breasts about how they have been wronged. So the
SCO people seem to have a few problems keeping the truth straight, but if there
is something they know all about, it's hypocrisy. 
=================================================
