G'day,

This isn't really Linux specific, but i'm sure there's some people here with
experience in this area. What i want to do is allow credit card transactions
on a planned site. I've looked at all the third-party credit card handlers
like PayPal and WorldPay etc, but they all give that amateurish look to a
site.

Anyway, the server will have some security i'd imagine, it's hosted at
rackshack.net. But what about storing credit card numbers? I doubt it's a
good idea to store the details on the actual server. How would say
EverythingLinux do it? And then after all this i have to worry about what to
do with them.. etc. And how to even get them back to me securely since the
server is in the US.

Actually having second thoughts about it now. It'd probably cost me an arm
and a leg to get a merchant account or whatever i need - infact anyone have
more info on this, like how to debit credit cards etc, or getting them to
like a bank to take care of them? Would i do this during the transaction on
the website?

I should probably buy a book on e-commerce or something..

If anyone can give me an outline of the whole process of doing it yourself
etc then that'd be a big help - or if you know of a third-party that handles
all this and allows it to be done securely still without having to exit the
website. I'd prefer an Australian one so i can simply get the money
transferred to a bank account.

Cheers,
Brendan
