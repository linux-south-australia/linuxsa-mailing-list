&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, it would tend to reinforce the stereotype that Linux users are 
&gt; (naughty, teenage, unprofessional, pimply, unlawful, etc) 'hackers' (I 
&gt; trust you understand the context in which I use this  ;-)


Redhat are probably taking the best possible positive action, in my opinion.
They're trying to cut off SCO's strategy of building a legal fund by soaking
some proportion of brainless, spineless business users first and then
using that money to attack everyone else.
SCO's strategy would win, like the famous winning strategy in two-up [1],
because in the USA, the outcome of civil cases usually depends on who
runs out of money first.
So the best strategy is to attack SCO before they gather enough money
to use the winning two-up strategy.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

-----------------------------------
[1] The strategy in two-up which always wins is the doubling strategy as
follows:
-	First bet a dollar. You have 50/50 chance of winning.
-	If you lose, double the bet. If you then win, you get your
	original lost dollar back. 
-	If you lose the second bet too, double again to recover the lost 3
	dollars on the first two bets.
-	Keep going until you get your original dollar back.
	Then you have won one dollar. 
	The mean time to get your dollar back is about 2 bets.
-	Whenever you win, reduce the bet to 1 dollar again.

This strategy always wins if:
A.	You have infinite funds.
B.	You can control the size of the bet.
What Redhat is doing is to attack SCO while SCO does not yet have infinite
funds (i.e. more than everyone else) and get control over the size of the
bet so that it suits Redhat. Of course, its' more complex than that in detail.
But that's the general idea, in my opinion.
