&gt; &gt; I think you'll find that David's advocating to fight against 
&gt; &gt; unlawful/unjust laws while still behaving within the law. 
&gt; 
&gt; I can see that. I disagree. So do many others. Ghandi, Rosa Parks...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Otherwise you are just as bad as those who make unjust laws 
&gt; &gt; ie you break them.
&gt; 
&gt; That presupposes that laws are "good". How about we say that those who wish
&gt; to control me against my will (ie lawmakers) are just as bad as those who
&gt; break just laws? It's all the same, really. The only reason why lawmakers
&gt; have any control is because they have bigger weapons than the rest of us.
&gt; There is nothing else that gives them legitimacy (as we have seen recently
&gt; in Iraq).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Once laws are made we need to behave within them otherwise we 
&gt; &gt; are branded law breakers and the point we were trying to make 
&gt; &gt; is lost. The detainees at Baxter have had their case tainted 
&gt; &gt; by those who make mischief.
&gt; 
&gt; One could just as easily say that if you don't resist against unjust laws by
&gt; flouting them as you see fit, you have already lost, as you are already
&gt; under the control of the unjust. Even here, our right to protest is being
&gt; removed. Does that make protesting wrong? What it means is that we can only
&gt; protest against things they will allow us to protest against. What sort of
&gt; protest is that?
&gt; 
&gt; But this is a big political debate, and probably not relevant to this
&gt; list...

Absolutely, but while we are at it, I'd just like to mention that we all
give up some freedoms in the hope of creating something better with the
'whole'. That's the foundation of society, and the reason why we obey
laws unless they strike at our most strongly held beliefs (or we are
crims)

The coalition of the willing is more about exercise of power in an
environment where the people are unable to direct their elected
officials (ie. vote) before the deed is done. It's unfortunate, but
until a better model comes along, we're stuck with the risk that some
peanut in Canberra is going to put our collective necks on the line.

Vote wisely :)

Michael
