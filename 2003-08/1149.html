OK, thanks to a number of people who helped off-list, I think I know what's
going on...

The domain is still delegated, so still has NS's assigned to it. People
sending mail to <A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com.au">richard@yellowgoanna.com.au</A> are finding that their mail
servers are querying a 150. address that I once had. This address may or may
not even exist any more, and if it does, won't be listening on port 53.
Packets are most likely being dropped into the drip tray. So, mail servers
are trying to deliver the mail, but for some reason that I don't understand,
are not timing out correctly, and are only eventually failing with an
undeliverable message. ...

Anyway, I'm asking Melbourne IT to undelegate, and we'll see if that
helps...

&gt; Subject: mail not bouncing problem
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a problem. Once upon a time, I had both 
&gt; yellowgoanna.com and yellowgoanna.com.au, but I dropped the 
&gt; .com.au because it was pointless. However, certain people 
&gt; keep sending mail to <A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com.au">richard@yellowgoanna.com.au</A>, and for 
&gt; some reason, they don't get a bounce back. Now it is my 
&gt; understanding that this is the fault of their mailserver, so 
&gt; there's nothing I can do about it... or is there? Does anyone 
&gt; know anything I can do about it?
&gt; 
&gt; I've been doing some investigation, and have confirmed that 
&gt; none of the NS's that ever served this domain serve it any 
&gt; longer. The old primary MX rejects mail for this domain, but 
&gt; the old secondary MX is still accepting mail... I've just 
&gt; asked the admin of the secondary MX to stop accepting mail, 
&gt; but I don't understand how anyone would be finding that MX in 
&gt; the first place. It also functioned as the old NS once upon a 
&gt; time, but I wouldn't think that any SMTP servers would try 
&gt; sending to an NS, would they? I have also discovered that 
&gt; running a dig for the NS records still returns results, which 
&gt; I am surprised at. I'm pretty sure (though not 100%) that my 
&gt; ownership of that domain has expired. Certainly, a whois on 
&gt; that domain returns nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this somewhat garbled stream-of-consciousness message 
&gt; makes sense :)
