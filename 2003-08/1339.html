&gt;Hi Evan,
&gt;
&gt;Well - I have to disagree on this one.  I am compelled to give you a response from a person who loves Linux, yet still uses, sells and installs MS (or Microsoft) products.  I assure you none of our guys here, who all use Linux and MS, are pea brained.  We use combinations of Windows 2003/Windows 2000 and Linux servin a mixed environment.  Over 90% of clients we deal with have installed either Windows 2000 or XP with Linux servers and desktops, where relevant, performing various tasks.
&gt;
Out of curiosity, and not about brain sizes I just want to know, what do 
you find that Windows 2000/2003 server does that Samba deoes not ?

&gt;However we are yet to find a worthwhile replacement to Microsoft Exchange Server (version 2000 and up) that gives you the collaboration ability that Microsoft Exchange does.  Although most people probably use only around 10% of the abilities of Exchange,
&gt;
Just curious as to what features do most people use Exchange for, I have 
never used it.

&gt;when they are educated as to its abilities the management of information and collaboration in an organisation invariably increases with resultant economies.  This is based on pure experience - not theory - from a person who would happily put an Exchange replacement in spec if there was a worthwhile replacement for true collaboration. 
&gt;
What does "true collaboration" mean in general ?


&gt;Obviously you don't or haven't bothered to obtain an understanding on what Exchange actually does for an organisation.  I suggest you inform yourself of this before you rant about the attitudes of professionals who use MS products.  As we sit today in our opinion- for collaboration - MS Exchange is better than any current open source projects we have looked at.
&gt;
What features do you find most lacking ?


&gt;From our point of view where we have presented a clear and detailed business case for organisations, in every instance they have jumped at a Linux based solution.  However there must be a clear, stable and reliable solution for an organisation to make the "switch"
&gt;
What are some specific problems with reliability that you have come 
accross when using Open Source Software ?

&gt;Clients are intelligent people making intelligent decisions every day regarding the long-term effectiveness of their organisation.  
&gt;
Not always. It depends upon the source of information. :-)

&gt;Give them a clear business case for the solution and they'll take it on board.  This is my experience every time.  
&gt;
How could either Linux or FreeBSD with Samba be beat ?   I just don't 
see it.

&gt;Given the amount of major organisations embracing Linux 
&gt;
I want more

&gt;and the fact that Microsoft rate Linux as their number one threat, 
&gt;
Not good enough

&gt;it is obvious that many organisations have made the switch to a Linux based solution.
&gt;
But obviously not enough

&gt;  This is even more evident in the last 18 months as Linux has matured considerably in the desktop arena.
&gt;
Its an incredible exponentially increasing rate, quite exciting for me.

&gt;But ranting, even on LinuxSA about the intelligence of Microsoft based people only exposes your lack of understanding of the integrated solution market and does nothing to improve the Linux cause.
&gt;
But on the other hand, I would like to read what you think cannot be 
done with Open Source software, that can be done with Microsoft.

&gt;As I said I love Linux but still see Microsoft as having a more robust solution in some areas.
&gt;
Specifics please


James Leone
