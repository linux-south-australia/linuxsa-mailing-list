These are some notes I took while working in FreeBSD 5.1-Current.

Some of the items are useful things to know, while others are some 
pitfalls a new user could come accross.

FreeBSD 5.1-Current Problems Solved

* KDE would rearrange my icons into a mess every time I
  logged out. I solved this by changing the background
  wallpaper to another background, and then going back
  to the original background.

* Used cron to get Fetchmail to check my mail every 10 minutes

* Sound was not working when I logged into KDE. All I had to do was 
compile my kernel with and add PCM, and then reboot, and my
  sound worked. See kernel compile notes below.

* Installed blackdown Java so Mozilla could handle Java

* Installed Flash plugin so Mozilla could handle flash

* Got a graphical login to come up AKA "KDM" by editing
  /etc/ttys, line 44 to read "ttyv8 "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm
  -nodaemon" xterm on secure" instead of "ttyv8
  "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon" xterm off secure".

* Got rid of the xconsole by editing
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 and commenting out
  the line that read: xconsole -geometry 480x130-0-0
  -daemon -notify -verbose -fn fixed -exitOnFail

* Installed Samba Client by adding a file called
  smbfs.sh into /usr/local/etc/rc.d. It reads:
  mount_smbfs -I 192.168.9.100 -N -f 0666 -d 0777
  //<A HREF="mailto:guest@MAI">guest@MAI</A>/MAI /root/mnt/MAI/MAI

* Customized the login Screen by editing line 26 of
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources. I changed the
  words "Welcome to FreeBSD" to read "Welcome to CPA BSD."
  Lines 74 & 76 shows a location of a logo, so I put my
  own logo in .xpm format at
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/pixmaps/logo.xpm. I changed
  both lines to read /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/pixmaps/logo.xpm.

* Got rid of vi, thank God! :) Edited ~/.cshrc line 19 to
  read "setenv EDITOR emacs" instead of "setenv EDITOR vim"

* I couldn't log into KDE from KDM because my .xsession
  and .xinitrc read "startkde" instead of "exec startkde"

* Compiled my kernel to add IPX and PCM:

Steps:

1.  I opened the shell and typed:

cp /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/GENERIC cp
/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/MYKERNEL

2. I then opened kwrite and editied cp
/usr/src/sys/i386/conf/MYKERNEL to read:

# Sound Support

device pcm # Sound

# Netware Client Support

options IPX # IPX Protocol Support

* I then saved the file

* Then I opened the shell and typed:

cd /usr/src/sys/i386/conf/

/usr/sbin/config MYKERNEL

cd ../compile/MYKERNEL/

make depend

make

make install

reboot

* Set up a minimally configured local parrallel
  printer. I edited /etc/printcap by merely removing
  the # sign from the front of lines 34 - 36 which
  reads:

lp|local line printer:\

:sh:\

:lp=/dev/lpt0:sd=/var/spool/output/lpd:lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:

* To finish the minimal printer setup, I also had to
  add a line to /etc/rc.conf that reads:

/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/pixmaps/logo.xpm

* Solved the sendmail sleeping problem. I know it has
  something to do with /etc hosts, because it was
  solved after I editied it to read:

127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost

192.168.9.133 localhost.localdomain localhost

192.168.9.133 localhost.localdomain.

(Other machiens will differ)

* I followed an example from Grog's book closely while
  configuring Mutt. My ~/.muttrc file reads:

source /usr/local/etc/Muttrc

my_hdr From: <A HREF="mailto:jleone@pacbell.net">jleone@pacbell.net</A>

set alternates="<A HREF="mailto:jleone@pacbell.net">jleone@pacbell.net</A>"

my_hdr Organization: Leone, 151 Calderon Avenue #276,
Mountain View, CA 94041, USA

my_hdr Phone: (650) 323-6665

set pager_index_lines=10

set hdr_format="%4C %Z %(%d-%m-%y) %-20.20L %-15.15t
(%41) %s

set status_on_top

set sort=threads

set date_format="%A, %e %B %Y at %k:%M:%S %Z"

set edit_hdrs

set fast_reply

set attribution="On %d, %n Shared:"

set sendmail_wait=-1

color hdrdefault brightblack white

color quoted brightblack white

color status black yellow

color index blue white Linux

set envelope_from

set editor="emacs"

* To configure my monitor, I saved SuSE
  Linux's/etc/X11/XF86Config file onto a floppy and
  saved it in FreeBSD as /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.
  I then overrid SuSE's entries with the contents of
  FreeBSD's original /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config
  file, then used the combined
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config file in FreeBSD.

***This was a much better result than using any of the X
  utilities including X -configure. ***

* I added access to my cdrom, floppy drive and storage
  partition by adding these lines to /etc/fstab:

/dev/acd0 /cdrom cd9660 ro,noauto 0 0

/dev/fd0 /fdd msdos rw,noauto 0 0

/dev/ad0s10 /storage msdos rw 0 0

* As suggested by Adam Smith, I was able to configure
  and update the ports system by merely going into a
  shell and typing make update from /usr/ports.
  However, for this to work, you have to copy
  /usr/share/examples/cvsup/ports-supfile to
  /etc/ports-supfile and also edit /etc/make.conf and
  add these lines:

SUP_UPDATE=yes

SUP=/usr/local/bin/cvsup

SUPFLAGS=-g -L 2

SUPHOST=cvsup.freebsd.org

SUPFILE=/etc/release-supfile

PORTSSUPFILE=/etc/ports-supfile



Hope that helps,


James Leone
