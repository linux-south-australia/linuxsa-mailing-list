 &gt; You might not agree with her policies, what she stands for or even (in my

 &gt; service in an ATSIC region community or something for say 5 years.

Defrauding the Government out of half a million dollars is a major
crime in anyone's language.  Why shouldn't it attract a major penalty?

While I'm sure the sentance will be reduced on appeal, I don't think 
it's unjust.  A randomly selected jury of her peers agreed that she and
Ettridge set out with deliberate premeditation to use the electoral
system to "make money fast."  How does that smell like political 
interference?

Bear in mind that there are also charges pending against her for 
defrauding her legal defence fund out of a new car and a couple of
credit card bills.  Judgement hasn't been handed down in those cases
so we must presume innocence;  But if she is declared guilty, will
a record of habitual and pervasive fraud sway any of the people who
think she's currently being treated unjustly?

(In my opinion, the only injustice here is that Oldfield hasn't been
charged too -- As party secretary, he must have had a material
involvement.  See <A HREF="http://www.muslimterrorists.com">http://www.muslimterrorists.com</A> if you want to
know what that virulent racist scumbag is up to these days...)
