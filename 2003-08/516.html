&gt; &gt; On this topic, molto briefly, I've been looking around at the PDA scene
&gt; &gt; looking for a linux-based one that I can develop on, and they all
&gt; &gt; seem to use Qt, which, I imagine, means that I have to pay Trolltech
&gt; &gt; some money, maybe for the development kit and also for later licensing,
&gt; &gt; although I don't plan to do anything commercial.

&gt; Well if you're happy to release it under the GPL then you don't have
&gt; to pay anything, or is this what the whole flame war is about? :-)

Chris,

I haven't noticed any flames yet. It's all been as civilised and chummy as a
drawing room discussion in a Victorian manor on a Sunday afternoon.

I'm not happy to release software under GPL, and I don't want to pay 
anything for a commercial development kit.
It's a question of freedom. Wars have been fought in the name of freedom.
So why should I give up freedom by merging my software into the GPL blob?
As discussed at length in previous posts, the issue is whether or not
I wish to submit to the GPL vision where secondary contributors to
projects are required to give up all control over their contributions.
Mark Newton has clarified this completely, I think.


You might be happy to be absorbed into the GPL blob right now, but when
you want to get out of it, you might find it's not so easy as you thought.
I don't like the attitude that "either you're with us or against us" that
emanates from the FSF bunker. 18th century european history shows that
this kind of an attitude is something worth running away from.

Cheerio,

ak.
