Not sure why, but DSL wrote:
&gt; Well, seeing we can just disregard patent law because it's

&gt; because I think it's wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, ALL THE LAW.

Suits me. I've been doing this for some time. Law and lawyers are irrelevant
and wrong. What's your point?

&gt; The system breaks when individuals or classes decide to get 
&gt; selective about what is lawful or not.

What sort of tripe is this? What if I want the system to break? Even if I
didn't, surely *not* questioning the law is asking for fascism?

&gt; 
&gt; I postulate the following, seeing I've been on a roll for 
&gt; insulting everyone all at once lately:
&gt; 
&gt;  ANYONE who decides that it is "wrong" to uphold the law that 
&gt; has been  lawfully made is guilty of undermining all our 
&gt; legal system, all our  democracy and everything we've ever fought for.

Woohoo! Sign me up! Democracy is the tyranny of the majority anyway.

&gt; 
&gt; So just what are you advocating?

I didn't see damien advocating anything at all -- I saw him quoting people
on /.

&gt; BE WARNED: I will not fear calling you all unlawful. Moronic 
&gt; is similar to ignorant - forgivable. But unlawful deserves 
&gt; something more sinister...they say never attribute to malice 
&gt; what you can attribute to stupidity. Our opposition to the 
&gt; awarding of this patent is bordering on the not stupid. It's 
&gt; sounding malicious....

You're dribbling, David.

A) who gives a mouse poop if you call anyone anything, moronic, ignorant or
unlawful?
B) is "unlawful" supposed to be a good or a bad thing?
C) whose opposition to what awarding of what patent? I didn't think there
was any awarding of any patent that was being discussed here. I thought
there was a court case regarding the upholding of the claim a patent holder
has over some idea that Microsoft was found to have used without licensing.
People on /. appear to be opposing the decision made by the judge, because
they believe software patents to be wrong. What is your problem with that?
