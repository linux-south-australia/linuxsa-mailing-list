Graham,

Right now I've got 53 active e-mail aliases.
Sometimes even personal acquaintances unthinkingly put my address
on the front page of a web site. So even they get their own aliases.

My formula is this:

1.	Put two personal initials before the dot.
2.	Put a significant abbreviation after the dot.
3.	When it gets spammed, append a number to the personal initials.

E.g. first ak.linuxsa, then ak1.linuxsa, then ak2.linuxsa, etc.
Then when I get a spam, I can see very quickly where it was "harvested" from.
For example, I registered an SNMP code for my paper company with IETF.
They required an e-mail address. That now gets copious spam attempts
which all bounce because I removed the alias.
Every single request for an e-mail address by any organisation gets a
new alias.
I must say I feel very sorry for people who don't control their own
mail server. They can't possibly use this sort of strategy, I imagine.

Somebody suggested even a year ago or so that the future of e-mail was
form-based interactive mail only. Or maybe it will use crypto signatures
which have to be in the recipient's opt-in list. Or a combination of these.
Since politicians don't care about the hoi polloi, we have to protect
ourselves, I guess. 
The crypto solution sounds good. Each sender has to provide an authenticating
signature which is checked against the recipient's white list.
E-mails without any signature at all go into the dubious bin or /dev/null.

Does anyone know what's going on the IETF standards arena for this?

Cheers,
ak.
