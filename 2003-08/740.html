Seems to be a mostly negative view of this on Slashdot as far as I can see, 
e.g:

"I dislike Microsoft but I still don't see that this helps the development 
community or users at all. Software patents are stupid and a bad idea.. even 
when being used against that monopoly we love to hate. Anyone with an 
interest in the freedom of developers to develop what they want and the 
freedom of users to choose the best product for their needs can't see this as 
anything but a loss. "

and

Software patents are vile. (Score:5, Insightful)

"Microsoft getting fined this way doesn't turn my crank at all. Also, I'm 
beginning to wonder why they allow jury trials for issues that are as 
technically complexe as this, nevermind allowing patents on processes and 
software in the first place... 
 
This is as stupid a patent as they come: what's a plugin or an applet? 
Fundamentally it is all in the same family of idea as of linked libraries-- 
bloody fundamental to every piece of software out there -- except that in 
this case the software is dynamically downloaded by a browser and then 
executed within the security context of the browser. 
 
521 million? I'm all for roasting Microsoft when they deserve it, but this is 
nothing they should have to pay for. Next thing you know Mozilla will get 
into trouble for having downloadable theme plugins. "

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; The slashdot 'collective' is a funny entity.  On any given day there is

&gt; Now that Microsoft lose due to a frivolous patent we're seeing a schism.
&gt;
&gt; Yes I know "slashdot" is not one person and there are tens of thousands of
&gt; regular users with differing opinions, but whether it's a story about
&gt; Microsoft, the US government or patents the karma points generally flow in
&gt; one direction (and thus those opinions float to the top).

&gt;
&gt; ..and as someone pointed out already at slashdot, it took a piddly little
&gt; company a single little lawsuit to get Microsoft when the US Dept of
&gt; Justice took 5 years and still got no tangible result.
