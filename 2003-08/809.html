&gt; Obviously. There's a well worked case that the United States of America and
&gt; some of its allies have oppressed the Islamic world to the extent where
&gt; terrorism (by flying planes into buildings, bombing night clubs or
&gt; attempting to make hotels collapse) is the "only" way out.

Not only a well worked case but a pretty valid one too.

&gt; Is this the only way that these people are able to make their point?

Can you suggest another method that would actually get noticed and have
any attention paid to it by people who are more interested in Holly
Valance's nipples than the horror that they help to inflict on others? 

&gt;  What
&gt; about all the people in Australia and worldwide who went to peaceful, legal
&gt; protests to attempt to stop this from happening?

The only thing that the peaceful/legal protests managed was to show
anyone who paid attention that governments are out of control and don't
give two ****'s about the opinions of those who's names they claim to
govern in.

&gt; 
&gt; One only needs about 10% of the population to mobilise, unite and work
&gt; within the legal system legally to make the system change. Only 1 in 10
&gt; people. Remember that.

And who said linux users didn't have a sense of humour? :)


&gt; In your opinion that is my first valid opinion [which was essentially that
&gt; the law is an ass]. All of our opinions are valid but some might disagree
&gt; with mine.
&gt; 

I agree the law is definitely an ass but it's the best we can afford.
