While I hear what Corey is saying, a post from Lev in ET this morning lets us 
know that:
"Our Ministry has a quoatation on how much licensing will cost. It's
$55K. So, either we sack 1/3 of the staff, adopt freely distributable
software or run the risk of prosecution."

ET is a POOR country. Thats why its an issue too!

&gt; To be honest, I think the biggest problem here is the issue of support. M$
&gt; support their products for years whereas Red Hat, by way of example,
&gt; supports their server and professional products for a year I believe. And
&gt; of course, M$ techs are EVERYWHERE.
&gt;
&gt; If one person in a small organisation is trained as a sysadmin for Linux
&gt; and, say, SuSE was available to use, it could work. There will be some
&gt; teething troubles (particularly since the M$ juggernaut will want to snare
&gt; the market before anyone else could give them any other choice) but it
&gt; could potentially work because everything from productivity apps (OO.org)
&gt; to accounting software (GnuCash) to browsers (Moz, Konquerer, Opera, etc)is
&gt; covered by most Linux versions. The Linux community has in fact bent over
&gt; backwards to make their products work with M$ products and have got nothing
&gt; of the sort in return.
&gt;
&gt; Training up some coders or hiring some to write some customised software
&gt; (or modify existing software) would probably help too. It's not impossible,
&gt; just difficult.
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, I recently picked up some Tradewinds East Timorese coffee.
&gt; Strange taste, almost a citrus flavour. I assume that their coffee crops
&gt; were kept near an orange grove. Plunged, this coffee rocks. Just thought
&gt; I'd let people know. :-) I'm well aware of Linux geeks' affinity for a
&gt; decent coffee drop. Hey, LinuxFormat had a section for best coffee in their
&gt; yearly awards!

&gt;
&gt; interesting - the  law changes, and someone suggests MORE ms to fux the
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; can ppl PLEASE summarise for me a simple argument in favour of linux? we in
&gt; computerbank have started the process over there the last few weeks with
&gt; the
&gt;
&gt; completion of our timorese project, but boy, a concise, simple, easy to
&gt; follow summary would help at this point.
&gt;
&gt; and im asking for as much input as we can get - we have a chance to help a
&gt; country get into the benefits of linux.
&gt;
