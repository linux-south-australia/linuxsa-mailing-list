All I can say is that SuSE will use different build numbers for identical 
packages, the difference being that the build number for apt is different 
from the build number shown in Yast. My guess is that it will offer an 
upgrade. 

If you have your sources installed and you want to use SuSe's settings but for 
a different set of kernel sources, you can use a bash shell script I made to 
do that.  I had help from a few people to sort out the commands to keep the 
old configuration in tact, and maybe I wouldn't have made this script but for 
other people's help. I was also given some advice @ how to form the script 
from a good friend of mine.

Basically it automates the steps you might take to compile installed kernel 
sources and sources from kernel.org.

It is available here: 

<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/automagic/kernelmagic.tar.gz?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/automagic/kernelmagic.tar.gz?download</A>

Open it up with a text editor so you can see what it is going to do.  One 
thing you may want to change is the use of make menuconfig to make xconfig.

It basically copies your existing .configure file and makes use of it with 
make oldconfig.  Note the larger the variance in kernel versions the more the 
chance for bitrot. 

Then it makes menuconfig, and uses uniquely named mkinitrd, system.map, and 
vmlinuz such as to preserve the original kernel and not pave it over like 
bzlilo might. It puts what you need in /boot and only requires that you 
update your bootloader with an additional entry.


Hope that helps
