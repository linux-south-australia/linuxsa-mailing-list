I personally hope that we don't return to the days of some of the virus' I
caught on my Amiga from people. Nawsty. People knew how to write virus' in
those days and they used to do scary stuff like enter bits of your hardware
you didn't know existed or your fast RAM or something like that. Mind you,
given that it's tougher to get root access to a Linux box, people might
resort to that sort of stuff to spread a Linux-based virus. Might have to
keep Limnux virus definitions up-to-date soon! Damn, that day can't come
slow enough! I like being immune from most virus'..........

&gt; Now let's bring this analogy to light. Whilst I am not suggesting that
Linux
&gt; users are terrorists by any means, they are probably the ones that are 
&gt; exploiting the holes in all of Microsoft's systems, resulting in them 
&gt; finding thousands. Microsoft (western society) is happy with something
that
&gt; is easy to use, and doesn't require a degree in rocket science to 
&gt; understand. They have got no beef with trying to exploit the holes in
Linux,
&gt; resulting in 'not many' being found.

I suggest there are far less viruses and worms for Linux because:

1)  It has been around for a shorter period of time in the mindshare of the
general public.  What was the use of creating a virus or worm in 1998 or
earlier?  How few systems compared to Windows OS systems would have been
infected?  The figure someone quoted of 63,000 viruses and worms being
available for Windows is FUD.  It almost certainely includes Win3.x and
older viruses that no longer run on modern systems, or viruses and worms
that exploit security holes patched many years ago.  Take out the number of
almost identical variants and that number is likely to drop dramatically.
Remove the number of viruses and worms that are extinct and I would be
suprised if there are more than several hundred on the list worth worrying
about.

2)  Linux users are likely to be more technically adapt than your average
Windows _home_ user.  The 'click on this nice attachment' viruses and worms
are far less likely to work on someone cluey about computers (although you'd
be suprised at the lengths some people goto to run a virus!).

When (if...?) Linux becomes more popular in the home expect many new viruses
and worms.
