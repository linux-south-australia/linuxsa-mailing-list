&gt;&gt;Novell is such a terrible terrible OS.  I feel very sad for Ximiam 
&gt;&gt;users out there who would like to keep using it as it is without any 
&gt;&gt;part of Novell in it.  I volunteer at Regency Tafe who use Novell 
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;... Novell have more then one product, you know.
&gt;
Yes, yes they do, and I think every single product I have used from them 
is complete crap.  I have used their Groupwise which is completley 
crap.  Go figure this one.  I have an organization with 600 
employees(not Regency).  A user accidentally deletes 4 emails from a 
very very important source.  How do you get it back?  You have top 
recover the entire, yes entire post office.  I can pick apart anything 
Novell owns and has complete rights over, and  that I have used to be 
far far below the expectation of anyone who has the littlest brain.  Not 
saying people don't like it, but I can't stand it and I know a few other 
people that feel just as strongly about it as I do.  The latest Netware 
6 for another example, by default does not allow you to remotely 
open/read a file that is in use by another program.  Now I don't care 
too much about shutting down my own webserver at home to read the logs 
but if i am work and it costs the company $85,000 a minute to shut down 
this web service, well I don't think it would happen and still get to 
keep my job.  I have to be on the server to do that, and well if I don't 
have amonster CPU or some ridiculous amount os memory the GUI(startx) 
will just run the whole system to the ground, and yes it depends on the 
server's usage.  Besides what OS now a days that is engineered properly 
as a server needs DOS or some other "OS"(which of course now covers 
Linux :)?
A: Netware
