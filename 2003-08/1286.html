Dan,

&gt; The email specifically discusses issues of negative linux advocacy
&gt; resulting from the actions of CB and as such should be relevant to a
&gt; linux oriented list.

I beg your pardon? I wasn't going to respond to your ill-informed,
unwise posting to the LinuxSA mailing list but you've now managed to
convince me that I should.

&gt; However it is clear that members of the list do not feel this is the
&gt; case.

That statement is totally untrue. You've forgotten to say that the
respondents to your claims are:

 * the branch coordinator
 * the previous branch coordinator
 * the current hardware coordinator

...and a LinuxSA list member who happens to have MORE SENSE than you.

You should get your facts RIGHT before making such ill advised remarks,
What have you heard:

 * an explanation of the facts from ComputerBank's previous branch
   coordinator?

 * an offer of assistance from ComputerBank's current branch
   coordinator?

Did you happen to know that I gave a working modem to ComputerBank to
her, EVEN THOUGH COMPUTERBANK DOES NOT GIVE AWAY MODEMS, to help her
out? Did you know I wanted no recompense for that modem EVEN THOUGH it's
ComputerBank's policy to charge for the service of a modem?

&gt; Specific claims made by members of the list will be responded to
&gt; offlist.

No, you want to send this offlist because YOU CAN'T BACKUP YOUR CLAIMS.

You're being most unhelpful to the Linux community. You're being
especially unhelpful to ComputerBank. Don't assume you can continue
being so without consequences.
