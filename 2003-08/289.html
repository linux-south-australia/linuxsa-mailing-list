&gt; Mutt

&gt; Although I was able to get Mutt to work I just have to figure out
&gt; how to get emacs to wrap at 75 characters. In the meantime, I am
&gt; using Kmail.

To get Emacs to do things automatically, you need a different mode.
Which you use is your own choice.  auto-fill-mode sets a wrap at 70
characters.  To set it at 75, use set-fill-column.

If you want this automatically (which I would strongly recommend), put
appropriate code in your ~/.emacs file (creating it if it doesn't
exist).  Here's what I use:

(global-set-key [f8] 'letter-mode)
(defun letter-mode ()			;this gets called by F8
  (interactive)
  (indented-text-mode)				; handle indents correctly
  (flyspell-mode nil)				; do an on-the-fly spell check (requires ispell)
  (ispell-change-dictionary "british" nil)	; and don't complain about correct spelling
;; Round here you might add (set-fill-column 75)
  (auto-fill-mode nil) )

;; Here's the code I actually use to tidy up replies.  A lot of it
;; is specific to me (like changing sender addresses and adding
;; comments at the bottom).

&gt; Upgrade to KDE.
&gt;
&gt; I am not surprised this didn't work, SuSE was chucking wobblies with QT as
&gt; well.

Hmm.  That's a mess.   You probably need to run portupgrade, but
that's more pain than you need without my book to help you, and even
then it's ugly.  Have you tried pkg add -r, or installing it from the
CD-ROM set?

&gt; Hmmmm. Looks like that isn't going to work. I don't know much about compilers.
&gt; I decideed to reinstall QT3.0.5 from the FTP site, and it went smoothly. I
&gt; retried the upgrade same error.
&gt;
&gt; So far, here is what happened:
&gt;
&gt; 1. The set up program on the cd showed a message indicating that the
&gt; Xconfiguration failed in the setup screen. I picked the most conservative
&gt; settings, rebooted my machine and copied over my Linux Xf86config file, and
&gt; went with the syntax that looked native to FreeBSD if there was a difference.
&gt; Although I am happy with the resolution, the color is definitely off and the
&gt; graphics are fuzzy.

That shouldn't happen.  What graphics?  Could it be a rendering
problem?  Also, check what pixel depth you're using; xdpyinfo will
tell you that:

   name of display:    wantadilla:0.1
   version number:    11.0
   vendor string:    The XFree86 Project, Inc
   vendor release number:    40200000
   XFree86 version: 4.2.0
   maximum request size:  4194300 bytes
   motion buffer size:  256
   bitmap unit, bit order, padding:    32, LSBFirst, 32
   image byte order:    LSBFirst
   number of supported pixmap formats:    7
   supported pixmap formats:
       depth 1, bits per pixel 1, scanline pad 32
       depth 4, bits per pixel 8, scanline pad 32
       depth 8, bits per pixel 8, scanline pad 32
       depth 15, bits per pixel 16, scanline pad 32
       depth 16, bits per pixel 16, scanline pad 32
       depth 24, bits per pixel 32, scanline pad 32
       depth 32, bits per pixel 32, scanline pad 32

Ignore this part: it always appears.

Continuing, 

   screen #0:
     dimensions:    1280x1024 pixels (433x347 millimeters)
     resolution:    75x75 dots per inch
     depths (7):    8, 1, 4, 15, 16, 24, 32
     root window id:    0x62
     depth of root window:    8 planes

This is the one that's important.  "Planes" is another way of saying
"bits per pixel".  If, as in this example, it's only 8, your graphics
will look terrible.

&gt; 2. I didn't have an option during setup to choose KDE and its window manager,
&gt; as my default login environment.

You didn't find it.  In the sysinstall "customization" screen you need
to page down to find the X options.  You can still do this after
starting the system.

&gt; 3. Sendmail had a strange sleeping error that has gone away but I don't know
&gt; how

Difficult to comment, except that I've given up on sendmail and now
recommend postfix.

&gt; 4. After changing my settings to use KDM to log in with, I could not
&gt; log in at all,

What happened?

&gt; and was forced to simply shut the machine off.

No, you should be able to switch to a vty with Ctrl-Alt-F1,
Ctrl-Alt-F2, etc.

&gt; I went back into Linux and found a command to let me back in, and
&gt; then I had to run fsck. After that, my printer settings had gone
&gt; vanilla and I no longer was required to supply a root
&gt; password. (Security Anyone?)

It's difficult to guess what happened here.  It's certainly not
normal.  I'd guess that you blew away something in /etc.  That's
pretty unusual, but you can help it by turning off quickly without
shutting down.  If you first wait a minute, the danger of file system
damage is greatly reduced.

&gt; 5. I don't know how to add Reiser file sysyem support

I do.  You get the Linux code, lock yourself in a room for a few
months and port it to FreeBSD.  Until somebody does that, there's no
ReiserFS support.  I don't see it happening: we're happy with UFS.

&gt; 6. I can't set up the cups printers because I am not authorized even though I
&gt; am logged into the web page as root. 

I don't know CUPS.  Check the permissions of the binaries and the
documentation.

&gt; In Netscape it just does a Netscape 7 search when I press on
&gt; anything and I get 997000 search results.

This is a little vague.

&gt; 10. The command I run in Linux to mount the FreeBSD partition does not work.
&gt; My source is Red Hat verified by the LDP:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/archives/redhat-install-list/2003-June/msg01624.html">http://www.redhat.com/archives/redhat-install-list/2003-June/msg01624.html</A>
&gt; <A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+FreeBSD-5.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Linux+FreeBSD-5.html</A>#ss5.1

Linux has problems with large block sizes.  Recent versions of FreeBSD
have 16 kB blocks, and the Linux UFS support doesn't accept that
size.  That needs fixing.

&gt; 11. Mutt's word wrap is not behaving

I didn't know mutt had word wrap.  What do you want it to do?  What is
it doing?

&gt; 12. I have no sound, nothing in the book about it, so I will search the web.

What does dmesg say?
