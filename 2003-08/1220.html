&gt;You might be opening a pandora's box here. What kind of a manager would
&gt;be happy to walk into the office and find all the workers arguing about
&gt;vi versus emacs, KDE versus Gnome, Mozilla versus Konqueror, 
&gt;bash versus tcsh,
&gt;perl versus python, sendmail versus postfix, reiserfs versus ext3,
&gt;SuSE versus Redhat versus Debian versus Knoppix versus Gentoo etc.,
&gt;GPL versus BSD licence, FreeBSD versus Open BSD, linus versus 
&gt;BSD, etc. etc.
&gt;That's alright for us young turks. But managers don't like 
&gt;young turks. 

As both a manager and a young turk as you so kindly put it, I personally 
wouldn't (and don't) care if my staff were arguing about which 
app/platform/procedure was better, as long as it was relevant to my 
organisation and they could demonstrate that by trying some of these
different platforms the end result is the best tool for the right job,
ie: the organisation benefits...


&gt;If I were a manager, I'd give them all VT-100s and make them 
&gt;use csh and vi.
&gt;Or I'd make them use Macs.  Remember that deciding _what_ to 
&gt;do is much more stressful than actually doing it.
&gt;Choice is the last thing that business people will want.

How is choice the last thing that business people want?  I'm not sure
I understand where you're coming from here.  In most cases (in my 
experience, limited though I am because I'm a young turk... ;) businesses
don't "want" choice because they don't know there's another choice
to choose from.  

Eg: I've been publicizing alternate (windows) mail platforms
among our staff here due to the latest round of Windoze worms, and it's
kind of interesting the varying responses you get.  Like "so you're saying
that there's a mail program that isn't affected by these viruses? I didn't
know that!"


&gt;If you want businesses to convert, you have to take away the 
&gt;element of choice!

Taking away choice but converting them to a different platform than 
they're on currently?  Hmmm....don't they get a choice between the two?

Management don't tend to like being told what to do, they prefer you to 
give them the options then let them make the choice, it's a power thing,
quite common in management circles... :P



&gt;Paul,  As many people have observed, if it weren't for MS, 
&gt;most IT support people would be out of a job. Would you rather hack linux
code 
&gt;on the dole or support MS users on a full wage? (That's a difficult one, I
know...)

Can't say I'm much of a code hacker, but I manage to support both Linux
and MS, on a full wage, all at the same time....go figure...
