I'm a guitarist. I was originally a classical snob before Metallica
corrupted me in yr 9 (is there anyone they DON'T do this to at 14??) and I
became a human guitarist, as opposed to a classical music regurgitation
machine. :-)

Anyway, thanks for the greets guys. Haven't done the mailing list thing for
a while! I've also noticed a lack of Microsoft bashing on this list. Either
it's taken as a given that you guys don't like it or it's been done to death
so I'll keep mine to minimum out of respect. :-)

By the by, I've just started looking at WINE as a method of running Windows
software (without shelling out the $300+ for Vmware Express!) and having
looked at the docs, is it really as convoluted to get happening as it looks?
And as for running games, has anyone had any success with running 3D games
under WINE? I just don't want to pay the subscription fee for WINEX. :-)

Also, who amongst the Linux faithful has a cert.? I'm trying to figure out
whether doing one is worthwhile, which one(s) to do and whether I'd be
better off doing a UNIX cert. etc.

Hello Corey :)

&gt; My name is Corey Taylor. I'm part Aboriginal, part Scot, part 
&gt; Polynesian and grew up in the rough end of town in Mansfield Park. I 
&gt; went to Woodville High and Adelaide Uni where I did a BSc., doing the 
&gt; dual chem majors (Physical & Inorganic and Organic). I've worked in 
&gt; the gov for a couple of years now, mainly doing data, stats and the 
&gt; occasional teaching stint. I'm a musician (was semi-pro at one stage 
&gt; before reality killed me) and play a few sports.

What instrument?
