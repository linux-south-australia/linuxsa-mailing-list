Except for the lax notary public in Germany who forgot to get the NDA

&gt; But the main legal argument is that some components of all Unix-like
&gt; operating systems are derived works of the SystemV code base.  That
&gt; is, if you take Linux and extend it with solely your own effort then
&gt; the result is still a derived work of SystemV.

That's the argument, but it's wrong.  FreeBSD definitely has no System
V component, though it's derived from Research UNIX.

&gt; There's also the question why SCO state that Linux 2.2 is OK but
&gt; Linux 2.4 isn't.  Surely the SCO argument must be that both are
&gt; derived works.  Unless it is the date which is important (the
&gt; SystemV code base up to a particular date has been made publically
&gt; available).

No, no version of System V has been made publicly available.  You're
probably thinking of Research UNIX, which is a very different thing.
Also, the claims are that the code is in UnixWare, not System V.
UnixWare is an implementation of System V, but the implication is that
the code in question doesn't occur in bog standard System V.  By
inference, that means that whoever did the copying had access to
UnixWare sources.

The interesting question is whether the common parts are:

1.  Of any relevance.
2.  Copied from UnixWare into Linux or Linux into UnixWare.  There's a
    lot of reason to believe the latter.  See
    <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/evidence.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/evidence.html</A> for my take on this.
