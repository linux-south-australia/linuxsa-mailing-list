&gt; Uni is supposed to be about educating you so you are capable of
&gt; self-training. Once upon a time, people learnt in Pascal or Ada,
which are of
&gt; little use to anyone, and that was the point. You learn to program,
and then
&gt; you transfer those skills to whatever language you end up using, as
&gt; appropriate. These days, the industry wants graduates to be
job-ready, and
&gt; know Java, have a Cisco certification and so on, none of which have
anything
&gt; to do with education, and hence, should not be part of a University
degree.
&gt; Historically, that was what TAFE was about -- the practical,
technical
&gt; things. You come out of TAFE ready to work. You come out of Uni
ready to
&gt; learn. Unfortunately, various pressures have conspired to draw
University and
&gt; TAFE into the same space. This is not to say TAFE is inferior, by
the way,
&gt; it's just different. Or it was. Now, it's not. It's almost the same,
but
&gt; better at it.

hmmm ... is TAFE not a Tertiary education institution.

is that not what our ideal candidate could be educated at?

&gt; &gt; &gt; A computer science degree is about programming and the theory of
how
&gt; &gt; &gt; things work.  Just like a chemistry degree is about the theory
of how
&gt; &gt; &gt; atoms interact, not about how to be a lab assistant, even though
you may
&gt; &gt; &gt; learn those skills along the way.

I would have to say, I learned more in six months in front of my Linux
box in my first year at Uni than i did in the rest of the Degree.
However, I learnt more about how to deal with people and finish
assignments
etc in the rest of that seven years (studing part time, working full
time).

&gt; This is the point that appears to be missed. The unfortunate thing
is that
&gt; people and industry are now demanding that a Computer Science degree
should
&gt; be about getting certifications and learning buzz-word language X,
and the
&gt; universities are being forced into doing it by our wonderfully
long-sighted
&gt; government (yay!).

We were taught C (some C++), SQL and APL throughout our course,
although, Java,
TCL, VB and a miriad of new funky (and limited) languages came and
went.

The most useful language that I learnt in that time would have to be
C.
As its still in wide use, but C++ is more relavent in modern
development
shops outside of Unix i think(maybe im wrong). shell scripting would
be
the second most useful language =) but APL i enjoyed the most =)

&gt; Personally, I think we should take another step forward, and seeing
as
&gt; Universities are becoming similar to TAFEs and TAFEs similar to
Universities,
&gt; and both are focussed on training, I think we should create a new
type of
&gt; education that is actual education, and specifically not training.
Or perhaps
&gt; we should attempt to distinguish between degrees that are training
degrees,
&gt; and degrees that are education degrees. Maybe we already are -- the
BSc and
&gt; BA are actual education, and the rest are increasingly training for
a career,
&gt; with some education thrown in for good measure.

If you want to academic type things and learn something you want to
learn,
you stay on and do your honurs then PhD?  is that how it works?

cheers,

Kim
