<PRE>
I decided to download FreeBSD 5.1-Current because I felt that I had hit 
a dead
end in 5.0-Current.

The installation looks almost identical to that of 5-Current, but it has a
menu with boot options and a friendly daemon to greet you.

I have a limited time in which to learn things, so I decided not to risk
learning CVSup to upgrade. After all, it could involve a whole lot of other
things, you never know.  So I performed an upgrade installation.

A few things went wrong, but since this was my test bed, no disasters 
here. I
selected upgrade, but then it took me to the partitioning screen. That's 
fine
if it were to have an option to pick a partition and that's it. But that
wasn't it.  I had options to create, delete, etc.  I asked my self does this
mean I have to format my partition? I was ok with that, so I picked create
and recreated the FreeBSD partition with the default file system.

Then it took me to the section where FreeBSD defines its slices. To be 
honest,
I don't want to bother with slices. One slice is good enough for me, as I
don't want to run out of space, and that I save my configuration files on a
floppy anyway. So my attitude is, just pick auto allocate and be done with
it.  Auto allocate did not work.  For a second I wondered what I should 
do. I
ended up deleting the slices and using auto allocate to recreate them. I 
quit
and then the installer errored out and it rebooted the machine. I also
thought that an upgrade could possibly leave some older code somewhere, so
that was that.

So much for the upgrade install, on with a fresh install. This time I 
did not
forget to install the ports. I also installed emacs and KDE 3.1.  I did not
install the FreeBSD bootloader, because I already have it configured in 
SuSE
with GRUB.

The fresh install went as expected, everything was smooth until I got to
configuring X. XF86config would error out when I tried to set up my monitor.
I set it up to take the most conservative settings and and saved even 
though
it said that the configuration failed.

After restarting the computer, and booting into FreeBSD, I logged in as root
and supplied my password. I then ran emacs and typed the word startkde. I
then pressed F10 to reveal a menu at the bottom of the screen. I 
selected "f"
for file and "s" for save as. I called this file .xsession. I also made
another file called .xinitrc and it only contained the word startkde. I 
don't
know if it is required.

After creating and saving .xsession, I ran startx, and then KDE 3.1 
started up
right away. Looks very nice.

I also noticed that FreeBSD 5.1-Current seemed faster than FreeBSD 
5-Current,
but that could have been my imagination.

Before the upgrade, I went into SuSE Linux 8.2 and copied its XF86Config 
file
onto a floppy.  My plan was to use that file in FreeBSD.  But how do I mount
a floppy in FreeBSD? That's easy cheesy man. Sheeh. :D

In the Lindows tradition, I was logged in as root. This allows me to set
things up easily without pissing the little time I had away with password
submissions, permissions problems, etc.

First thing I did was make an icon for the FreeBSD partition by right 
clicking
on the desktop and selecting create new hard disk. I named that C. I clicked
on it and I browsed to the /ect/fstab file and opened it with emacs.

I added this line to /etc/fstab:

/dev/fd0            /fdd        msdos        rw,noauto        0    0

Right click on the desktop, create new floppy device.  Clicked on the floppy
and it mounted. Problem is that 1/2 the time it will say that the device is
not configured.


EDITORIAL

Here is where the non-GUI guys are both right and wrong.  

* Where do I think that they are wrong?
A mouse can outclick anybody when it comes to typing. One can explore the
entire partition much faster with a mouse.


* Where do I think that they are right?
There is no way a GUI could configure additional hardware for an operating
system faster than adding a single line to /etc/fstab.

Back to our program.

Ok, so I was able to mount my floppy, so I copied the XF86Config file to my
DESKTOP and renamed it XF86Config.Linux. I then moved it from my desktop to
the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/ directory. I then opened both XF86Config.Linux and
XF86Config with Kwrite.

 DO NOT simply copy and paste the entries below, it requires that 
astrics be
removed, some of the entries are unique to my system, and additional entries
will have to be made by your system.

** I ended up copying over the ** entries from XF86Config.Linux to FreeBSD's

When I was done configuring X, I logged back in and the desktop was 
absolutely
beauttyful, and the fonts looked as nice as Red Hat's.  The FreeBSD 
kernel is
already impressive, but KDE 3.1 is as well.

Next I edited /etc/ttys and changed this line to read:

ttyv8    "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"    xterm    on secure

instead of

ttyv8    "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"    xterm    off secure

When I rebooted I was presented with a Graphical login screen.

Next I went to set up my printer. Again, this is easy cheesy, because I 
have a
parrallel printer connected to my computer. Sheesh.

All I did was open my /etc/printcap file with kwrite and remove the #'s from
the left side of this line:

lp|local line printer:\
    :sh:\
    :lp=/dev/lpt0:sd=/var/spool/output/lpd:lf=/var/log/lpd-errs:

My sendmail was sleeping on entry again but I found out how to fix it. I
changed my /etc/hosts file to read:

127.0.0.1        localhost.localdomain
192.168.0.133        localhost.localdomain

Instead of:

127.0.0.1        FreeBSD
192.168.0.133        FreeBSD
192.168.0.133        FreeBSD

Note that the installer created two "192.168.0.133        FreeBSD" entries.

When I logged into KDE it said that it could not find /dev/dsp and that I
would not have sound.  I googled around and I found something about pcm, 
and
that eventually led me to the /boot/kernel directory.  Much better than
Linux, I can tell what modules I have without loosing my hair.

Apparently there is a module for my two sound cards:

Aztech AZT1008 and VIA686.

I edited /etc/rc.conf to add these lines, but the same error comes up:

lpd
#kldload snd_via82c686.ko
#kldload snd_pcm.ko

I did not try the Aztech yet.

Ports:

When I tried to install OpenOffice it would time out on a download
cd /usr/ports/editors/openoffice/
make clean install

It just dies:

 &gt;&gt; OOo_1.0.3_source.tar.bz2 doesn't seem to exist in

Cups problem:

I installed the full version of cups, but now when I open the administrator
web page I can log in as root with password, whereas before when my system
was missing the password, I could go no further.

When I set up my printer, the web page will display the following error 
after
I name my printer:

Request Entity Too Large

The request is too large for this server to process.

I have not reset up mutt, and am using Kmail.

Actually scratch that, Kmail will not send out my emails, so I saved my 
file on a floppy and booted back into Linux.

I tried to mount the FreeBSD partition from Linux, but:

mount -t ufs -o ufstype=old /dev/hda2 /freebsd/
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda2,
       or too many mounted file systems

Yes, that is the partition, and I also tried all the other ones too, I 
think 7 or so.
