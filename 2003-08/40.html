 I have a friend who filled his car with petrol at a self-
 service petrol station.  After he had paid and driven away, he
 realized that he had left the petrol cap on top of his car.  He
 stopped and looked and, sure enough, it was lost.

 Well, he thought for a second and realized that other people
 must have done the same thing, and that it was worth going
 back to look by the side of the road since even if he
 couldn't find his own petrol cap, he might be able to find one
 that fit.  Sure enough, he hadn't been searching long when
 he found a petrol cap.  He tried it on, and it went into place
 with a satisfying click.

 "Great," he thought, "I lost my petrol cap, but I found another
 one that fits.

 And this one's even better because it locks..."
