   &gt;  &gt; It's just a software licence that specifies the conditions under

   &gt;  That's bullshit, Michael - We went through this already last week!
   &gt;  
   &gt;  It specifies conditions under which derived works of the software can
   &gt;  be -distributed-.  That's why the GPL is titled "TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   &gt;  FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION" (read it;  it's right there
   &gt;  immediately after the preamble).
   &gt;  
   &gt;  One of those conditions is that the distribution can only occur if
   &gt;  the derived work is also covered by the terms of the GPL.

Well that's really modification, isn't it.  Distribution of GPL software on a CD with non-GPL software is not forbidden, remember?  That's distribution.

   &gt;  That makes it viral (As far greater contributors to freely distributable
   &gt;  software than you or I seemed to agree decades ago).
   &gt;  
   &gt;  To say it's "no more, no less" than any other software license is
   &gt;  pretty tenuous at best.

I disagree (strangely enough :-)  and yes, we did go through this last week.  I don't think either side made any knock-out blows in their arguments.  Despite reading a lot of rhetoric from both sides, the issue is still up for interpretation.  The only virality is when developers don't think.  And when developers don't think the licence is the least of their worries.

I still think the GPL is the best FOSS licence out there, and similarly you think it isn't.  That's ok :-)  

Lots of companies have made money on both GPL and non-GPL licenced software.  So it's obvious that you should choose the licence you wish to use for your software.

   &gt;  (Does -anyone- on this mailing list actually understand what the GPL
   &gt;  is about, or do they just buy-in to the 15-word soundbites from RMS
   &gt;  on slashdot?  Hands up everyone who has actually sat down and read it?)

Actually yes I have :-P  I'm the guy my local management hassle when free software licencing gets brought up :)

I'm no RMS groupie - If you asked RMS what he thought of me, should he remember me, it wouldn't be plesant.  We didn't get on well when he was in Adelaide :-)

But having said that, I still think the GPL is a pretty good hack, and has tremendously helped the development of free software that you and I depend upon.
