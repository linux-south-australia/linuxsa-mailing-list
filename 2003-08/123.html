&gt; &gt; Why should I have to WASTE 30Mb of my customers' memoru just so
&gt; &gt; OpenOffice starts quickly? It's a total WASTE of resources. If we
&gt; &gt; let OO through we let them all..
&gt;
&gt; Kingmax 256DDRPC2700 (333MHz)SuperRAM with tiny BGA tech. $68.00 +GST
&gt;
&gt; Sure, 68*1.1/256*30= $8.76
&gt;
&gt; So your customers are going to forego $8.76 wholesale worth of memory to
&gt; eliminate the thing YOU are telling us is a critical stumbling block to
&gt; acceptance of the package. Have you checked out how much memory the MS
&gt; Office preloader takes up? You'd have to deduct it from this figure by the
&gt; way...
&gt;
&gt; Next argument please, that one was total Hobbit Sh*t.

okay, so it's _only_ 30M... some people don't have that much to spare, and 
don't have the option to buy more memory just so they can have something 
preloaded. and where will you draw the line? maybe next you want your web 
browser preloaded... and then your email client... and then what?
once you accept that preloading one thing is helpful, you're opening the door 
to preloading that comes to hundreds of MB of memory that might not even be 
used before the computer is shut down. and that's a big waste.

and even if it's only OO, putting aside 30M that some users might not use 
(some people don't like word processors, and stick to text editors and the 
like where they can) is still a waste.
and yes, you can't compare OO to MS Office until they're both loaded only when 
needed, no preloading at all for either
