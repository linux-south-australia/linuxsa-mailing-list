To be honest, I think the biggest problem here is the issue of support. M$
support their products for years whereas Red Hat, by way of example,
supports their server and professional products for a year I believe. And of
course, M$ techs are EVERYWHERE.

If one person in a small organisation is trained as a sysadmin for Linux
and, say, SuSE was available to use, it could work. There will be some
teething troubles (particularly since the M$ juggernaut will want to snare
the market before anyone else could give them any other choice) but it could
potentially work because everything from productivity apps (OO.org) to
accounting software (GnuCash) to browsers (Moz, Konquerer, Opera, etc)is
covered by most Linux versions. The Linux community has in fact bent over
backwards to make their products work with M$ products and have got nothing
of the sort in return. 

Training up some coders or hiring some to write some customised software (or
modify existing software) would probably help too. It's not impossible, just
difficult.

Incidentally, I recently picked up some Tradewinds East Timorese coffee.
Strange taste, almost a citrus flavour. I assume that their coffee crops
were kept near an orange grove. Plunged, this coffee rocks. Just thought I'd
let people know. :-) I'm well aware of Linux geeks' affinity for a decent
coffee drop. Hey, LinuxFormat had a section for best coffee in their yearly
awards!

Timor Leste


interesting - the  law changes, and someone suggests MORE ms to fux the 
problem. 

can ppl PLEASE summarise for me a simple argument in favour of linux? we in 
computerbank have started the process over there the last few weeks with the

completion of our timorese project, but boy, a concise, simple, easy to 
follow summary would help at this point. 

and im asking for as much input as we can get - we have a chance to help a 
country get into the benefits of linux.

tia, r:)
