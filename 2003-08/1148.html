&gt; &gt; /*
&gt; &gt;  * Allocate 'size' units from the given
&gt; &gt;  * map. Return the base of the allocated
&gt; &gt;  (rest of example omitted)
&gt;
&gt; Already the text is different.  Look at the line breaks.  That's what
&gt; SCO did, and that's why they found this particular example.
&gt;

Yes that's correct, but I said...

&gt; &gt; Is it really that difficult to assume that while making the minor
&gt; &gt; changes (adding the ASSERTS & spinlocks) that the comment was not
&gt; &gt; tidied up to make the first 2 sentences 1 line each and remove the
&gt; &gt; "* The swap map unit is 512 bytes." comment?

Note. I said make the first 2 sentences one line each. Which to me seems a
natural thing to do and is something that I know I would do if I was
changing any part of the comment (Yes I know you doubt that I would have
made such an exact match but thats where the sentences are!).

Which changes this...
/*
 * Allocate 'size' units from the given
 * map. Return the base of the allocated
 * space.
 * In a map, the addresses are increasing and the
 * list is terminated by a 0 size.
 * The swap map unit is 512 bytes.
 * Algorithm is first-fit.
 */


to this.....
/*
 * Allocate 'size' units from the given map.
 * Return the base of the allocated space.
 * In a map, the addresses are increasing and the
 * list is terminated by a 0 size.
 * The swap map unit is 512 bytes.
 * Algorithm is first-fit.
 */

and we now have an exact match!

The comment now has more structure and is easier the read.

Given the fact that the first 2 sentences are short one liners I suggest
that it's entirely possible. It is obvious that at least one person thought
that this was a sensible thing to do.

Now if the changes in the formatting of the comment was the other way
around or any different (eg; not sentences) I would agree with you 100%.

You stated.....
&gt;- There's no question that it was derived from System V.4.

All I am suggesting Greg is that due to the size and structure of the first
2 sentences in the comment it is entirely possible that 2 different people
could make the same trivial changes to arrive at an exact match, and that
does raise some doubt. (At least as far as where the comment came from.)


&gt;Note that 32V has nothing whatsoever to do with the case here.  The
&gt;32V code differs significantly from the examples we're talking about.

The code & comment that I'm talking about appears to have come from 32V and
I'm suggesting that over a time span of many years that it was possible for
2 different people to make exactly the same logical & trivial changes to
the comments.

As for the rest of the code. Given that it all appears to have originated
from the same base code the similarities are hardly a surprise.
