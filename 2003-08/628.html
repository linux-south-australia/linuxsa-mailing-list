Matthew,

Not so.  It should not have died and did not die.  It's still the best
software development editor I know of.  Someone on this list recently
ported it to linux.  In the last two weeks or so, I've written 6407
lines of software with ludwig.  On two days, I wrote about 1000 lines on
each day.  There's no way I could do that with other editors that I know
of.  (This is all user-space GTK+ software, which is fairly repetitive
in some respects.  Writing in the kernel doesn't go that fast...)

If ludwig had been open-sourced 10 years ago, emacs would be in the
dustbin of history by now, along with "ex" and the "infamous mister
ed", as "ed" used to be known. If only it hadn't been written in
Pascal. But then, what else was there on a VMS machine in the 1970s?
You can't write a decent editor in fortran, can you?

Hmmm. Thinks... Maybe I should learn all the vim commands and see if it
can be used for serious development....

Cheers,
ak.
