You can get suction cup microphones which you can stick to the handset.
Much simpler.

 &gt; b)  obviously, due to current privacy laws and all that kind of guff, one is
 &gt; supposed to inform the party being recorded that they are.    banks,
 &gt; insurance companies do it for 'training and quality assurance' purposes.
 &gt; yeah right, more like to protect themselves.        anyway if one was to
 &gt; tell the person the other end they we're being recorded that would make it
 &gt; legal would it not?

The Privacy Act says what companies (i.e., people who aren't you!) can do
with respect to collecting, storing and distributing personal information.

Other Acts specify who can intercept and record telephone calls.

Then there are state laws associated with recording phone calls.

Last time I checked, in SA it was legal for a private individual to
record a telephone call provided that -one- of the parties to the call
knew it was being recorded.

That means you can record your own phone calls without telling the 
other party that you're recording them.

If you're planning to collect evidence, you really should consult
with a lawyer instead of the LinuxSA mailing list!
