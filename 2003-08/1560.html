<H1>OT - Telstra, ADSL and unrealistic expectations</H1>

<PRE>
Telstra is a communications company with a long history of providing
high quality (and relatively highly priced) communication services to
Australia.

1 - Telstra has responsibility to deliver voice quality
telecommunication services to the population of Australia, not ISDN, not
ADSL, not MessageBank nor any other value added service, the fact they
do is a bonus. (If you don't like it write to your local member of
parliament (Federal) and request changes to the USO)

* It should also be noted under the USO other telecommunication
companies have the option to bid for the tender to provide these
services, whilst Optus continue to complain about the fact they
"Subsidse" (sic) Telstra to the tune of ~$90 million dollars annually
for the delivery of these services they continue to suggest ways of
delivery of these services which fail to meet the USO requirements for
quality of service and have as yet failed to tender for such work.

Telstra aren't going to undertake vast infrastructure developments
continually whilst the competitive framework is untenable, why would you
invest in infrastructure if you have to give access to the competition
cheaper than you're allowed to sell it in a retail market, competition
that typically doesn't have the requirement to undertake significant
capital works projects and operate in one of the most legislated
industries in Australia.

If you can't get ADSL then there are indeed a number of viable options.

1 - Lobby Telstra on behalf of your local community spelling out to them
that your area is commercially viable for ADSL to become available. 2 -
Investigate other data options, DOV, ISDN, Satellite etc etc 3 - Move
location.

It seems some Australian's want Telstra to be the most highly
competitive telecommunications company in the world, delivering best of
world service whilst offering subsidised infrastructure development to
all and sundry below their retail price. We also want them to deliver
huge dividens (the Government some ~2 billion last year) a growing share
price, cheaper prices to the public and allow competition to flourish,
you simply can't have it all.

In short if the vast majority of the population either nor in the future
want high quality, well priced broadband and other data solutions it
involves action from all stakeholders, that means:

1 - Regulatory framework which involves all stakeholders. (Industry,
Government, Developers, End users) 2  - Ownership of development issues
surrounding the reasons for inadequate infrastructure development. (This
means new land developments contributing to infrastructure as they do
with most other services) 3 - A realisation that Telstra can't be all
things to all people and is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't.

If you think for a minute that privatising Telstra is going to be a good
outcome for Australia and ongoing infrastructure development in this
country you are sadly mistaken, a privatised Telstra will lobby all and
sundry that the legislative requirements for them to service
unprofitable markets is uncompetitive and if you think areas which have
no access to services such as ADSL etc will be left further and further
behind.

Matt
