Mark,

Well, yes, I did "read" it a couple of times, but it's so mind-numbing
with undefined and vague terms that it's difficult not to let one's
mind drift to more interesting things, such as ice cream, chocolate
biscuits, cheese on toast, and a nice mug of cocoa.

However, the bits that I did stay awake for were so scary that I've never
put the GPL on anything I wrote - and I advise others to avoid it also.
One minor example: <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/linux/gpl.html">http://www.topology.org/linux/gpl.html</A>

I wouldn't even dual-licence any software (e.g. BSD/GPL) because if someone
else wrote an improvement to my code under GPL, then anything I added to
their improved version would be imprisoned in the GPL orbit.
The worst thing about the GPL is that it is optimized for the US
legal system, which is nasty and savage. 
I think the trend in Australian law in recent decades has been to
replace incomprehensible langauge with plain langauge so that
people who ultimately have to sign things have some hope of understanding
them. No matter how many people have _read_ the GPL, I doubt that
many on this list have hired a A$300/hour lawyer for a day to
give an opinion on it. I had a chat on the phone with a lawyer for 30 minutes
once, and a month later I got the A$550 bill. This was about a very much
simpler contract - but with a US client.

That's why I think people should stick with the comprehensible licences:
BSD, Artistic, etc.  <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/soft/lice.html">http://www.topology.org/soft/lice.html</A>

Just another little point, I noticed also in my GPL reading that
the scariest things are nearest the end. That's how it is with licences which
are written by "real" lawyers.
Even the LGPL is a bit sneeky. I thought I could live with that.
But given the FSF's heavy handed tactics against Ulrich Drepper,
I wouldn't expect any mercy from these people in the event of misunderstanding.
The LGPL is in many ways even more scary than the GPL because it's
more difficult to interpret.

Anyway....

Cheerio,
Alan.

PS.  I'm one of those tedious people who insisting on reading things
before signing them. I did this with a 20-page rental contract for
an appartment in Bonn once, and saved $2000 as a result because
I was able to strike out a clause on page 18 that didn't apply -
which would have required me to renovate the place when I left.

In another anecdote, a couple of weeks ago, I went to a dentist
for the first time in 30 years and was asked to fill in an
information form and a legal form about permitting use of info.
I said I couldn't immediately make sense of the legal form - so they
said it was okay for me not to sign it. More people should refuse to
sign things that are too long to read in the available time.
And people should feel that they have the right to strike out any
clauses they don't like. But the GPL does _not_ permit you to
derive another licence from it. Not pleasant! Nor generous!
