&gt;&gt;What hardware are you talking about? It's not fast to load on my
&gt;&gt;500mhz laptop, but it isn't minutes either. Most people running MS

&gt;&gt;openoffice should be preloaded for most users. To do otherwise is to
&gt;&gt;invite unfair critism.

And can't be.  Not with a 50MB footprint :-(

I use OpenOffice a lot.  I started off thinking it was good,
but now the more I use it the more I think it sucks.  That's
probably because my expectations have changed -- I no longer
use OO just for viewing MS-originated documents, but for
real work.

The basic user interface problem is that it's a MS clone.
So if you don't know how a function works in Word you'll
never find it in OO.

And it lacks an architectural consistency.  So there are
functions available when drawing pictures in Impress that
aren't there when drawing a picture in Writer.  Arrgh.

The shipping defaults suck.  Like all UNIX packages font
and printer configuration sucks big time (why do I have
to configure them to an application *at all*).

And it crashes.  It does have nice crash recovery.  But
it still dies when doing slightly complex things, like
deleting a reference target, leaving a dangling reference
in the document.

Impress is a PowerPoint clone.  PowerPoint is nowhere near
being a good presentation authoring package, so Impress
is automatically limited to being sucky.  For example,
try having a slide with a heading and a running head (to
give people an idea of the current theme).  Can't be done,
yet this has been OHP best practice for a least 10 years.

I thought Calc was OK.  Then I tried to load the Cisco
price list.  Can't be done, Calc doesn't support that
many rows.  Why not -- UNIX has a decent memory model.

I've had lots of problems exporting documents that are
readable by Word and Excel.  The Beta2 PDF Export is
brilliant, and this goes a long way to helping author
original documents in OO which can be shared with
the MS-dominant world.

In summary, OO is a nice MS Office clone.  But that's all
it is at the moment.  This might change (and the work
by the database and bibliography people in aiming to do
better than MS is promising).
