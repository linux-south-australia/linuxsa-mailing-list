James,

I have tried to provide you with answers on your questions - but please
understand that there are some questions here which would involve a 
considerable amount of time to document properly.  I've tried to answer
them concisely for you and hope I have done them justice!

Thanks

&gt;Out of curiosity, and not about brain sizes I just want to know, what do 
&gt;you find that Windows 2000/2003 server does that Samba deoes not ?

James - although the discussion wasn't about Win2000/2003 - for some clients
we are using Samba (some with E-Smith as it's a great "out of the box"
product for smaller networks).  However if someone wants to apply security
policies to groups of users (OU's) then the tight integration between
Windows 2000/2003 and Windows XP clients is really nice - this is something
as far as I'm aware there is no integrated Linux solution for, but please
bear in mind I haven't looked too hard on this!

&gt;Just curious as to what features do most people use Exchange for, I have 
&gt;never used it.

Collaboration.  Our medium and larger clients love collaboration.  Most users
in our experience however just use emailing, rules, calendar, tasks and contacts.
More advanced users tend to use grouping, document management with revisions and
quite a bit of scheduling.

&gt;What does "true collaboration" mean in general ?

True collaboration as opposed to "if you send him/her a copy or keep a
copy of this information here then they can look at it and send you their
input and you include it.  Or they amend their copy, they send it to you
and you add it to your copy".
Ie We have access to others information, can actively participate and
have that participation tracked, handled, controlled and initiated.
I hope this gives you some idea.

&gt;What features do you find most lacking ?

I've seen a few that, from what it looks like, should be good once they are
stable and have been in use in substantial numbers for a while.  It would
honestly take far too long to detail all the things that Exchange can do
for an organisation.  But some of the features that should be included
that spring to mind (in my view):
- Sharing information between users or defined groups of users who have
varying rights dependent on their role.
- Sharing mailboxes, calendars, group appointments, task scheduling all
 *within* the client connection.
- Document management including revision and comment tracking.

&gt;What are some specific problems with reliability that you have come 
&gt;accross when using Open Source Software ?

This is *really* hard to document here.

&gt;Clients are intelligent people making intelligent decisions every day 
&gt;regarding the long-term effectiveness of their organisation.
&gt;
&gt; Not always. It depends upon the source of information. :-)

LOL - OK.  But *we're* the source aren't we???  :-)

&gt;How could either Linux or FreeBSD with Samba be beat ?   I just don't 
&gt;see it.

In some instances - easily (waits for flames).  Depends on how far into
this you want to go (and how much time I can spare!).  But if you want
to share files and give people permissions on those files, Linux wins
every time - in my experience if you want to go further and define roles
and extremely explicit roles based on security policies I have found
it both easier to achieve and maintain under Windows 2000/2003.

&gt; I want more

Don't we all.

&gt;and the fact that Microsoft rate Linux as their number one threat,
&gt;
&gt;Not good enough

Ummmm - ok.

&gt;it is obvious that many organisations have made the switch to a Linux 
&gt;based solution.
&gt;
&gt; But obviously not enough

We'll have to agree to disagree.  I think Linux is doing fantastically
at the moment and the momentum (!) building behind Linux is also
superb.  I'm in this for the long term and think things have changed 
remarkably fast for the betterment of Linux in the recent short term and
only looks great for Linux in the long term.

&gt; Its an incredible exponentially increasing rate, quite exciting for me.

True - which tends to negate your last comment :)

&gt;But on the other hand, I would like to read what you think cannot be 
&gt;done with Open Source software, that can be done with Microsoft.

In theory - nothing.

&gt;As I said I love Linux but still see Microsoft as having a more robust 
&gt;solution in some areas.
&gt;
&gt;Specifics please

Pull down Exchange, plonk it on a box, play with it, connect to it - you'll
see what I mean.
