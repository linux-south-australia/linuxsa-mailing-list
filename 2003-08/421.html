&gt; &gt; Sure, some people learn better in ways other than uni.  You can also get
&gt; &gt; people who've been to uni who are pretty awful and who didn't really
&gt; &gt; take anything in.  But I'll tell you what, when I deal with people I can
&gt; &gt; tell the difference, even if they've got a degree in a completely
&gt; &gt; different area.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, but you also get the people who have been to uni and tend to have the attidude that they have been to uni and know it all and therefore are automatically better at their job than someone who doesn't have a degree which, I am happy to say, a load of crap. I know of a few people in Adelaide who I would put technically against anyone and NONE of them have degrees - they have been offered honourary titles - but never taken them.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also the mind set some people have, thinking that since they've learned it all at uni, so they dont need/want to bother learning anything else.
&gt; 
&gt; Given the choice in the people I've worked with - I'll take someone who hasnt got a degree and has taught themselves - they are almost always, in my experience better at what they do.
&gt; 
&gt; I did 2 years of uni with good marks before I decided that wasnt what I wanted to do - sure I aquired some very useful skills from my time at uni (mainly my *nix background), and they do teach some very useful skills at University, however from my experience, people without degrees tend to be harder working, know their job/equipment inside out and just get on and get the job done.
&gt; 
&gt; Keep in mind this is only my experience from the areas I work in however.

I'm a high school dropout who drove taxis for nearly 20 years and has
been using linux at home for the past 8 years. Nowadays I spend 12 to 18
hours a day on irc helping all sorts of people with their linux
problems. A lot of them are college graduates, some are highly paid
SysAdmins. Many of them don't even know how to use the su command
properly and wonder why they keep getting "Command Not Found!" errors. A
lot of them have no idea how to resolve dependancy errors or why
compiling from source on an rpm based distro is a bad idea.

My point is, it's not always about knowing all the answers. Sometimes
knowing where to look for the answers is a more desirable skill. Having
a degree doesn't necessarily mean they have such skills. Sometimes the
hardest part is actually knowing what the real question is, and
understanding the nature of the problem at hand, instead of just looking
for a quick fix.

I'm broke and unemployed and sure would love a job like the one
advertised here. However when I see the words "Tertiary qualified" in
the job requirements I don't feel encouraged to apply just to make the
other applicants look good. Potential employers merely see "taxi driver"
on my resume and move on to the next one. I don't even get to the
interview stage. The best I can usually hope for is a "Thank you for
your application" letter.

Having a degree doesn't mean you're better than anyone else, but it sure
can help to open doors that are closed for those without one.
