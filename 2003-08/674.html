Hi List,
I have recently upgraded my system by installing a new ABIT IS7 (p4)
motherboard. The board is good and has on board gigabit lan (even though
the specs say otherwise)
So far I have managed to track down a module for the LAN from ASUS
(of all places) (which runs the same 3com onboard chip) The module =
appears
to work as I compiled it and fired up eth0 and I could ping my other =
machines.

The problem is I have tried running insmod 3c2000.o and it placed it in
/proc/modules I pinged but I cant do much else - the gateway and other
things are not setup (normally done from the DHCP server but seeing I
manually ifconfig up I hardcoded the ip address ). I have never faced =
this
(installing a custom module) before as most of my hardware was always a
generation behind and always autodetected.

So if someone could advise me on the correct procedure for installing a =
NIC driver so I can get this up and running I'd
appreciate it.

I may have another question regarding with ac97 sound but Im sure that's
wont be a hassle as it's not as new as the gigbit lan stuff.

Thanks

Evan
