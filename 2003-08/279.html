That "article" was the biggest, smelliest, steaming pile of... yeah.. Anyone 
can twist anything and present it at such an angle to produce the results 
they want. That "Bridget O'Connor, senior vice president of technology at 
Lehman Brothers" bought the Microsoft sales pitch completely. 

"We're not dismissing Linux PCs out of hand, but the integration [Microsoft] 
provides around the desktop is already there" she says, that's the _exact_ 
terminology Microsloth spouts all the time. 

It's like during the last Federal election, I would read people's "opinions" 
on the party leaders in The Advertiser (a Liberal paper if ever I saw one), 
and they were basically word for word of what was spouted on the Liberal 
Television Advertisements. 

It's funny when that group of biological robots known as "society" get 
completely manipulated/programmed by the powers that be. 

(Forgive me, I recently watched "America's Propaganda War" on SBS last 
Tuesday).

Cheers,

Damien

&gt;  NEW YORK - Judging from the holy war being waged by
&gt;  proponents of Linux PCs, it's clear that Linux is becoming
&gt;  the OS/2 of its time.
