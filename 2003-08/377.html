&gt;&gt;I expect that the code "shared" between Linux and SCO is not so

&gt; I retract that - I haven't kept up to date, and hadn't realised

&gt; draconian NDA.

Actually, your first statement was more correct.

SCO have shown people identical code fragments in SCO UNIX
and Linux.  That might be OK -- they might both be fragments
of BSD code for example.  Or they might both have been contributed
by the same creator (which appears to be the case with the
RCU code).

The NDA and the conditions of viewing the code haven't allowed
these investigations into the provenance of the identical
code to occur.

But the main legal argument is that some components of all
Unix-like operating systems are derived works of the SystemV
code base.  That is, if you take Linux and extend it with
solely your own effort then the result is still a derived work
of SystemV.

This is an incredibly wide interepretation of "derived work"
and it will be interesting to see how it fares.

There's also the question why SCO state that Linux 2.2 is
OK but Linux 2.4 isn't.  Surely the SCO argument must be
that both are derived works.  Unless it is the date which
is important (the SystemV code base up to a particular date
has been made publically available).

But of course, this is SCO we are talking about, so the claims
of infringement vary with the phase of the moon.  Which is
why so many people are looking to FUD, share prices and investor
exit strategies as explanations for SCO's behaviour.  There's
a deep suspicion that the last thing SCO wants is a speedy
and straight-forward resolution.


Personally, the last thing I'd be doing is signing a contract
with SCO.  SCO have no hold over you through the copyright laws
(unless you were the person that put "their" code into Linux).
A court finding otherwise would be extraordinary (the record
companies would love it though, if a song turned out to be
plagarised they could sue each and every listener).

So why would you sign a contract with SCO and thus give yourself
some sort of contractural relationship with SCO?  A lever which
they may later choose to use against you.

You'd be nuts.  Better to wait it out.

Which explains why SCO finds it necessary to offer a financial
incentive to sign with them now rather than later.
