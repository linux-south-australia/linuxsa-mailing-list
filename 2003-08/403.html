Hi all,

How does ld decide which library to hardcode the path to when linking an
ELF executable? I have two complete sets of libraries built and
installed on my box:

  - The standard RedHat 8.0 or Slackware 9.0 libs (depending on the box
I'm using at the time), including glibc, libao, libogg and libvorbis.

  - A complete set of libao, libogg and libvorbis, which I'm attempting
to link against uClibc (ie, not glibc). These libs are stored in a file
system hierarchy under /tmp somewhere, so that they don't overwrite the
libs that my nasty music is currently using to offend the others in my
office.

Building and linking libao and libogg are easy - they only require stuff
provided by the standard c library, so the uclibc-gcc wrapper links them
against the correct libraries.

When trying to build libvorbis (and subsequently vorbis-tools), it links
against part of glibc (as well as parts of uclibc).

To get stuff to link against uClibc, I do the following:

  PATH=/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/bin:/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/usr/bin:$PATH
  ./configure
  make all install

Or similar.

To link against uclibc and a bunch of other libraries, I need to tell ld
where to find those libraries. Now, because ld has a nasty habit of
putting absolute path names in ELF executables, I can't just
-L/tmp/somewhere_where_the_libraries_live/lib, so I do something like:

  find /tmp/... -name '*.so*' -exec ln -s '{}' . \;
  find /tmp/... -name '*.h*' -exec ln -s '{}' . \;
  PATH=/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/bin:/usr/i386-linux-uclibc/usr/bin:$PATH
  LDFLAGS="-L. -nostdlib"
  CPPFLAGS="-I. -nostdinc"
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="."   # ./configure tries to execute a few test progs
  ./configure
  make all install

Or similar. Incidentally, with -L., ld appears to *not* put a path name
in front of the library name in the ELF executable, thus relying on
/etc/ld.so.cache.

Despite the LDFLAGS env var, a 'strings -' of the built file (in this
case, say ogg123), libm.so.6 and therefore libc.so.6 have been linked to
the binary.

My question is, how can I force ld to either:

 * not use any libs other than those listed by the -L option on the
command line or
 * ignore library versions (ie, put libc.so in the ELF binary instead of
libc.so.6), if possbile / wise.
 * use a specific version of a library

I haven't had much to do with the GNU linker and binutils in the past
('cause they just work :-)) and the man/info pages didn't appear to have
anything that was related.

thx,
Matt
