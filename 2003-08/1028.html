There should be 2 VRM (Voltage Regulator Modules) they keep the power levels
to the VTT accurate (1.10V or 3.1V off hand) . They are located amongst a
group of largish Capacitors below and to the left of the left CPU.
There are how-to's on the web to replace these components (very simple and
cheep cheep) the VTT voltage severly effects the stability of these boards,
although possibly not to the levels you describe.
It would be probably be worth the 30 mins it would take to do these 2 mods,
you have nothing to loose other than some of your time and a couple bucks
worth of bits.
When www.bp6.com is back up, they have excellent guides on how to do this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a machine here with an Abit BP6 dual-processor motherboard 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a couple of Celerons.  I originally bought it three years ago 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to work on the new FreeBSD SMP implementation, so it was literally 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the first machine to run SMPng.  The problem is, it's not doing it 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; very well any more.  I can't even build a world without it hanging
multiple times.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it the motherboard?  Is it FreeBSD?  That's what I'd like to know.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The best way to find out would be to get a second system with the 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same motherboard.  Does anybody out there have one they'd like to 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sell or lend?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Curious to know the results, also have a BP6 that I have sadly come 
&gt;&gt;&gt; the conclusion is dead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It locks up under xp and RH9, worse with dual cpu's
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; There was talk at one stage of power regulation problems with the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; boards.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, I've checked that on the old board, but didn't come up with
anything.
&gt;&gt; Anyway, the new board works fine, so it really looks like it's the 
&gt;&gt; old board, or possibly something set in the BIOS.  Before I throw it 
&gt;&gt; out I'll try reflashing the BIOS and seeing if that makes any 
&gt;&gt; difference.  It shouldn't, since this board used to work reliably.
&gt;
&gt; As I said before, it is most likely the EC10 capacitor

My understanding was that the capacitors would then be bulging.  I couldn't
find anything like that on my board.

&gt; or one of or both the CPU VRM's.

I'm not sure which component you mean here.  The voltage regulator chips?
Or something else?  I've measured the voltages, and they seem fine.
