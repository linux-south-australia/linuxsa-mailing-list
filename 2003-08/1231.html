Interesting message Eric sent to SCO:

<A HREF="http://linux.com/article.pl?sid">http://linux.com/article.pl?sid</A>=03/08/22/1746248

Eric has written a very clear and firm letter. It will be interesting to
see what spin SCO puts on it.

"Linus Torvalds is backing me on this, and our other chieftains and
philosopher-princes will as well. Show us the overlaps. If your code has
been inserted in our work, we'll remove it — not because you've
threatened us but because that's the right thing to do, whether the
patches came from IBM or anywhere else. Then you can call off your
lawyers and everyone will get to go home happy."

[..]

"Take that offer while you still can, Mr. McBride. So far your so-called
‘evidence’ is [redacted]; you'd better climb down off your high horse
before we shoot that sucker entirely out from under you. How you finish
the contract fight you picked with IBM is your problem. As the president
of OSI, defending the community of open-source hackers against predators
and carpetbaggers is mine — and if you don't stop trying to destroy
Linux and everything else we've worked for I guarantee you won't like
what our alliance is cooking up next."

[..]

"You have a choice. Peel off that dark helmet and deal with us like a
reasonable human being, or continue down a path that could be bad
trouble for us but will be utter ruin — quite possibly including jail
time on fraud, intellectual-property theft, barratry, and
stock-manipulation charges — for you and the rest of SCO's top
management. You have my email, you can have my phone if you want it, and
you have my word of honor that you'll get a fair hearing for any truths
you have to offer."

Regards,

M.
