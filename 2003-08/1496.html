I took the plunge and went adam adsl a couple of weeks ago, and am happy
with it. The worst bit was the 1 month wait to get it connected, but
thats not really adams fault, but telstra. I had some problems with
intermittent adsl modem hardware, and while working out what was going
on the support guys (and girls) wernt bothered by the fact I was running
linux, or using an unsupported modem. They took the view "we dont
support that, but we'll do what we can. Do you have options that look
like this somewhere?". Then after half a day of stuffing around with it
the modem died completely. I replaced it and all functioned like I'd
expect. The help desk also said "we hear that roaring penguin pppoe
works pretty much out of the box under linux, you could try that in
bridged mode". I knew this already but it was quite refreshing to hear
it from them.

&gt; A couple of questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. On <A HREF="http://adsl.adam.com.au/">http://adsl.adam.com.au/</A> me reads that unless
&gt; you run either M$ (some flavours) or Macintosh you
&gt; don't meet Adam's system requirements for an ADSL
&gt; service.
&gt; 
&gt; But a post from John Edwards &lt;<A HREF="mailto:isplist@adam.com.au">isplist@adam.com.au</A>&gt;
&gt; said 'run what you like'
&gt; 
&gt; So on one hand the Adam site says effectively says no
&gt; Linux etc, the T&C may say the same (haven't checked)
&gt; but an Adam employee(?) posts and says its okay.
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting situation.....???
&gt; 
&gt; 2. What page/url on URL which describes the $49/28days
&gt; ADSL? 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; PS - after having my e-mail address harvested off a
&gt; list, I now use 'disposable' accounts like this.
