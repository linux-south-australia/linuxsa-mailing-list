Hmmm. Is there a licence that has the 'good' aspects of both BSD and 
GPL? i.e.

1) Requires source code inclusion with derived products
2) Ensures buyers/users of derived works have the same rights
3) but allows the 'original' [1] author to negotiate a closed source 
sale (to a particular vendor for their improvements only - i.e. sell a 
BSD style freedom to a party)...

Perhaps this would be a good compromise...

[1] I guess this is a can of worms... ;-), based upon what we've been 
saying - how does one define 'original'? (the author of the x86 
instruction set, of course! Or ENIAC? I wonder where that was derived 
from - perhaps all source code is really owned by Babbage... or the 
inventor of decimal numbers, or positional notation... ;-) Hmmm. It 
seems like we're drawing a line in the sand...

&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; I thought the whole idea of the GPL was that ir prevented people doing 
&gt;  &gt; just that...
&gt; 
&gt; In theory, yes.  But in practice GPL advocates tend to defend the
&gt; more indefensible portions of the GPL by saying things like, "The
&gt; original author owns the copyright, and can publish it under any
&gt; license he wants.  If you don't like it, write your own from scratch!"
&gt; 
&gt; Which is really just another way of saying, "The Community has no stake
&gt; in this software;  it's under the control of the original author.  If
&gt; the Community wants to own a stake in it, they'll have to ignore it,
&gt; write their own, and publish it under a non-GPL license."
&gt; 
&gt; The other thing it ignores totally is that -I- own the copyright in 
&gt; modifications I make to GPL software... yet I am expressly prohibited
&gt; by the GPL from choosing my license agreement for my intellectual property.
&gt; (any derived works must be licensed under the GPL -- even though I own
&gt; the copyright in the modifications used to make those derived works,
&gt; and I may not want to license that copyright under the GPL).  The GPL
&gt; is the only license I can think of which exhibits that trait.
&gt; What part of the GNU Manifesto or the ideals of the free software movement
&gt; says that the property rights of an original licensor are more important
&gt; than my own property rights over my own creativity?
