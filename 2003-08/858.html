No, the problem is that the Linux kernel doesn't support a binary interface. 
That would make things a whole lot simpler. Hell, it'd be great if even the 
same kernel version had a consistent DBI (Driver Binary Interface) between 
distro's.

2.6 seems to have the beginnings of support for loading kernel modules that 
were compiled for different kernel versions.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; why, oh why, do distros omit the kernel source from the default package
&gt; install list? (redhat, mandrake, i'm talking to you.) there are so many
&gt; times when it's needed; i've had 3 or 4 times personally where it's come
&gt; up either at work or home that it hasn't been installed and people have
&gt; been mystified as to why something wouldn't compile.
&gt;
&gt; i'd say the kernel source, while it takes up a fair bit of space,
&gt; *needs* to be installed by default.

&gt; Corey, what distro are you using? if it's redhat or mandrake (the only
&gt; two i have any experience in, really), you should be able to run their
&gt; respective package managers - under "main menu -&gt; configure -&gt; package
&gt; management" in mandrake, or under "main menu -&gt; system settings -&gt;
&gt; add/remove applications", i think, in redhat. *hopefully* the kernel
&gt; source package will be listed in there; you can select it to be
&gt; installed and it should prompt you for the correct CD.

&gt; &gt; Hey guys.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Looking for a few tips to do with this little beggar. In short, I can't
&gt; &gt; get my GeForce Ti4800 to load its 3D modules because as I go to install
&gt; &gt; the NVIDIA-provided .run file, it keeps telling me I'm missing header
&gt; &gt; files to be able to install it. I assume this means that it needs the
&gt; &gt; kernel source. I haven't had much of a chance to have a play with this OS
&gt; &gt; yet but if it's the missing kernel problem, I wonder why the kernel
&gt; &gt; source didn't come with it. Anyone know?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So can anyone help me out here?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks people.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Corey.
