&gt; [insert drum roll here]
&gt;
&gt; I tried the "powering down the box and removing the mains" suggestion
&gt; and, low and behold, the mouse and keyboard now work fine!!!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to everyone for their suggestions!
&gt;
&gt; It still seems strange to me though why such drastic actions should
&gt; be necessary to get a piece of hardware to work.
&gt;
&gt; And I have no idea why the hardware stopped working in the first place!

My best guess would be something along the lines of:

 - static discharge through keyboard or mouse
 - causing a "fault" condition in the k/b & mouse controller
 - I'm guessing it's an ATX box, so k/b and mouse (and specifically, the
controller) are powered from standby power (hence the "kill the mains"
requirement)

However I'm at a bit of a loss to guess what the "fault" condition might be.
IMHO a hard reset ought to be adequate to resolve anything but the worst
latchup condition. But then maybe that's just what it is.

Alternatively if you've recently added USB devices (or even if you get a
repeat of the problem) you might like to check what load is on the standby
power bus - AFAIK some USB ports can be configured to have their power
supplied from the Standby 5V rather than the primary 5V. If you start
hanging high-power USB peripherals off of those then that could upset things
(in which case a good test would be to unplug any extraneous USB devices and
see if it comes good).

Good news, anyhow.
