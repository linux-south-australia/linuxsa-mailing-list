&gt; Hi all,

&gt; Recently I've read that the SCO lawsuit is funded or backed not only by MS,
&gt; but also by Sun (<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article">http://www.theinquirer.net/?article</A>=11168, among others)...
&gt; Now both MS and Sun are favourite targets for Linuxistas, being Evil
&gt; Megacorporations Plotting Against Linux, but is this accusation
&gt; true?

It's the first I've heard of a Sun involvement.  It also takes more
than unsubstantiated accusations like this to convince me:

   The SCO Group's Microsoft (and Sun) funded campaign of continuing
   attacks in the press on Linux and the Open Source community has
   known no bounds.

&gt; It sounds to me a lot like the counter-accusation, that IBM is
&gt; funding the ESRs and RedHats and whoever else of the world.

Haven't heard that one, but ditto.

&gt; As far as I know, MS owns SCO stock (I don't know how Sun is
&gt; linked), but that's the extent of it.

Certainly Microsoft stands to gain from damage to Linux.  It's not so
clear that Sun would.  And I can't imagine Microsoft and Sun
collaborating on *anything*.

&gt; Certainly sounds like less of an influence than IBM's billion dollar
&gt; Linux investment (not just the $, but the credibility). What
&gt; confuses me further is why Sun would be implicated in this -- aren't
&gt; they trying to get in on the Linux market these days?

Exactly.

The Inquirer has never appeared very trustworthy to me.
