Frankly the mail below is not appropriate for this list.
Should you have an issue with computer bank, take it up with them privately.
Using a mailing list to voice what is obviously second hand information to 
attack another group of volunteers is simply in poor taste and quite immature.

&gt;
&gt;Little could be further from the truth. In addition to dubious hardware
&gt;(this might be something to be expected from second hand hardware, but
&gt;consistent denials of problems by members of Computerbank left her feeling
&gt;aggravated, distressed and put down - the machine clearly was faulty with a
&gt;probable hardware conflict as the cause - though this was not accepted
&gt;by people at CB she dealt with).
&gt;
&gt;After having got the machine to work for her, I find that the kernel
&gt;running on the machine is 2.4.17 (notoriously buggy), the /etc/fstab entry
&gt;for the cdrom is broken and that KDE is a manky piece of crap (sorry to
&gt;delve into religion here, but why put on an environment that doesn't work
&gt;- my first experience with KDE (3.0.2) was finding the KMail is broken,
&gt;KSpread can't export to Excel (work requirement) and though it says it
&gt;can export to gnumeric, that fails). This really throws an insult at the
&gt;strengths of the underlying system (Debian GNU/Linux). Is providing flakey
&gt;(at best) software in these components likely to enable a computer (and
&gt;most proably a Linux) neophyte to use the machine, given that it takes a
&gt;degree of Linux awareness at least to fix or understand the issues
&gt;involved - I think not.
&gt;
&gt;What I find myself asking is: What function does Computerbank play in
&gt;South Australia? Is it to provide functional computers to those in need
&gt;and who are in most probability not highly computer literate? Is it to act
&gt;in some degree as a Linux advocacy group? I would have to say that
&gt;Computerbank's efforts fail abysmally in both regards in the experience
&gt;that I have had with it through my friend.
