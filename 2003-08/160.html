So much flaming to do, so little time.  I've picked on this message
more or less at random because it seems to be saying something like
what I want to say.

First, startup time.  Yes, it's terrible on machines with small
memory.  It (1.0.1) takes about a minute on my neighbour's 96 MB/ 233
MHz machine.  I'm prepared to accept that new versions are
significantly faster, but remember that the goal should be
instantaneous startup.  If you're used to that, I'm sure that OOo 1.1
won't look like a ball of fire either.

But I don't care (too much) about the startup times.  There are other
issues.

&gt;
&gt; geez david, you are on a roll..want to alienate anyone else?

I think I know the answer to that one :-)

&gt; as one of those morons, i pointed out to you - most of us have
&gt; openoffice, its just sodding overkill for many dics, and there shld
&gt; be an agreed format, not necessarily oo - rtf, pdf etc are far less
&gt; greedy, and specific tool dependent:)

That's a very good point.  

The real issue here is that OOo is trying to imitate Microsoft.  When
you copy somebody, you can't come in better than second best.  We have
operating systems which build on a philosophy of small, specialised
tools doing something well and interfacing well to each other.  We
have text formats so that we can see "under the cover" and understand
what's going on.

Then we throw it all away in a mad rush to catch up with Microsoft.
Big, bulky packages which do everything (if you can work out how),
which store their data in "open" formats so complicated and
specialized that nobody wants to look at them, which require mice to
work properly, which can't work out of cron jobs, which despite all
that don't offer the level of control you want.  

I have to use OpenOffice for two reasons:

1.  To decode Microsoft documents.
2.  To write articles for AUUGN, which is currently set with
    OpenOffice.

Both of these are bad reasons.  OpenOffice includes a reasonable (but
not spectacular) decoder for things like msword.  As they say, "inside
any big program is a small program trying to get out".  But what can I
do with this program?  I can convert msword into an equally illegible
(but open) format.  And that's all.

The second point's the same in reverse.  If I get a document in, say,
HTML, groff or TeX, I can use a clever editor or a bit of perl hackery
to convert it to one of the other formats.  How do I do that with
OpenOffice?
