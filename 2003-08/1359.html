&gt;Holy sweet crap! Citrix costs $12k?!?!?! You could have a cluster of 6 
&gt;Linux/X11 boxes with failover, load sharing, whatever for that price - 
&gt;Including the hardware! and OS!... TCO my ass! An experienced Linux/Unix 
&gt;admin, could *surely* implement something more effective/reliable for $12k 
&gt;_including_ hardware...  

LOL - ah well - do some economics study - you'll understand :-)

&gt;How do you measure increased productivity anyway? Microsoft is the only 
&gt;benchmark.. how much does a few worms affect productivity? 

Worms *didn't* affect those machines that *were* patched - as all our clients
were - this is an old tired subject.  IT only affected machines that had been
Administered poorly - as it could with Linux or Windows machines.
But I previously said I like the Linux firewall solution much better.

&gt;And Exchange is only for 3 years? Then it's pressure-time to upgrade I 
&gt;suppose...

And you don't with Linux?  Hmmmmm  So Redhat now comes out and says its
end-of-life for its products is 1 year from release (see slashdot).  After
that there is no support, no bugfixes, etc.  Just explain your argument
again?

&gt;What I would love to see is an Experienced Linux/Unix admin and an Experienced 
&gt;Windows admin be given a budget to setup systems for a given specification. 
&gt;The spec shouldn't say anything about legacy file format support, as that 
&gt;unfairly biases towards Windows. The spec should just say what sorts of 
&gt;things the client wants to do. Not all the budget has to be spent if it is 
&gt;not needed. 

&gt;It would be interesting to see how they turned out.

OK - and what about interoperability, time and motion studies of users experience
and productivity and what about how easy or hard it is to administer this solution
from the clients point of view?  SO how much is it *really* going to cost over the 
life cycle of the product including administering it (gee isn't that called TCO).

&gt;Anyhoo I'm neither a Unix nor a Windows admin, so I have no experience setting 
&gt;up either in a business situation. 

Well this is my point exactly.  I love Linux, install it for many applications, but
there are instances (like Exchange Server) where there is nothing out there in use
in the Linux market that has been used in reasonable size organisations for a
reasonable amount of time and is a *stable* release that we can use yet.  When there
is we'll look seriously at recommending it.

Kind regards,



Paul
