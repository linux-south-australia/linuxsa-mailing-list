And how, precisely, are they going to provide notice to every single
PDF licensee on the planet in a manner satisfactory to a court?

Half a billion registered mail letters, perhaps?

Maybe they'll print out a notice and stick it into the bottom of a 
locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door
that says "Beware of the Leopard."

Hint:  Putting a notice on a web page somewhere is not, and never will
be, adequate notice.

 &gt; Well, I'm sticking with this argument. It's already been decided in the
 &gt; courts...

You stick to -every- argument, David, regardless of whether you've 
thought it through, and regardless of whether you're correct.  That's
why you get into so many flamewars:  Once you've made a statement, you
never, ever, ever retract it, and you always feel compelled to get stuck
into anyone else who contradicts you.

In this particular discussion, you've made the statement that OpenOffice
is unsuitable for release to your customers, for some value of "unsuitable"
and some value of "customers".  Because you have a pathological resistance
to changing your mind once you've made a public statement, you are now
forced to invent and contrive reasons to defend the indefensible. 

So far you've said OOo takes too long to load, it uses too much RAM, 
its document interchange abilities are too limited (and, by implication,
that PDF is potentially on the verge of being shut-down by Adobe).  Each
of those points has been shot-down.  Nobody is claiming that OOo is 
perfect at any of those things, but it's "good enough", it's rapidly getting
better, and none of its competitors are perfect either.

If Microsoft said those things, we'd call them "FUD".

If Senator Alston exhibited the same reluctance to change his mind once
he'd emitted a public statement, we'd call him... well, Senator Alston.

If SCO cast the same doubt on public licenses as you just have, we'd
laugh heartily and give them a good bollocking.

But it isn't Microsoft, Senator Alston or SCO exhibiting these traits,
it's David Bloody Lloyd, flamewar-magnet.  So what should we call them?
