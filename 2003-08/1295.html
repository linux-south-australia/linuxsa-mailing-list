Hi all.
I've had a bit of a look at the man pages, but nothing stood out to me, and 
I'm hoping someone here can help.
I use an external modem to dial up to my ISP, and I've had a few problems with 
it, there will be times when no traffic goes either way, and then usually 
shortly after one of the LEDs (it's marked with CS, but I can't remember what 
it stands for (for shame)) goes out. usually 10-20 seconds after the LED goes 
out, it comes back on and traffic flows through again.
I've contacted my ISP, and while they're not anti-linux, they didn't have 
anyone in the office who was really an expert. I did find out, however, that 
there were a lot of speed negotiations, or some such, I think the number for 
one of the most recent sessions was over a hundred, which is a bit excessive.
When I use the modem from windows I don't have any of this sort of problem, so 
I figure it's probably something I haven't configured or some software 
problems.
I'm using slackware 8.1/9.0, which comes with pppsetup to do consolegraphic 
configuration, and `ppp-go`, a script that uses `chat`.
I can get more version numbers and config files if they'd help diagnose.
I've also noticed that it seems more common when someone else is using the 
internet connection. WinME computers connecting over a hub to this box, with 
NAT compiled in (whether it actually is more common, or it's just my 
imagination / I notice it more because other people get impatient and glare 
at me, I don't know for sure).
Any ideas?

thanks in advance

Adam
