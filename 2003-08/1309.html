Mark,

While I am not a telco technicaian, I understand that it is against some
telecommunication regulation put a phone connection down a network
cable. Personally, I wouldn't want to do it anyway for reason of
possible interference.

&gt;  
&gt; There are two types of cable.  "Patch" cable is used for, well,
&gt; patchleads. It's very flexible because the wires in the cable are
&gt; stranded.
&gt; 
&gt; The other kind is used for internal building work, is less flexible,
&gt; and has solid-core conductors.  That makes it nice and strong, so you
&gt; can pull it through ducts, gaps between walls, etc without causing
&gt; internal fractures.  When you bend it it wants to stay bent too.
&gt; 
&gt; If you ask a vendor for patch cable you'll end up with the stuff that
&gt; isn't usually used for internal building work.
&gt; 
&gt; This may not seem like a problem on the surface, but it is:  the two
&gt; types of cable have two types of connector.  Most wallplates and
&gt; patchpanels have Krone terminations on them which expect solid-core
&gt; cable.  And most crimp-on RJ45 plugs are intended to go on the end of
&gt; patchleads, and they therefore expect stranded cable.  You might end
&gt; up with dodgy terminations if you mix the cable and connector types.
&gt; 
&gt; So for building work specify that you want a 100m roll of solid-core
&gt; CAT5E cable.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Anyway, does anyone know where to get some cheap CAT5 in Adelaide?
&gt;  &gt; JayCar has it for 75c/m, but i've heard you can get good quality
&gt;  &gt; cable for 40c/m.
&gt; 
&gt; Try Page Data.
