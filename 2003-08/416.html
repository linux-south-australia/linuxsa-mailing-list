Matthew,

&gt; Sure, some people learn better in ways other than uni.  You can also get 
&gt; people who've been to uni who are pretty awful and who didn't really 
&gt; take anything in.  But I'll tell you what, when I deal with people I can 
&gt; tell the difference, even if they've got a degree in a completely 
&gt; different area.

Yeah, but you also get the people who have been to uni and tend to have the attidude that they have been to uni and know it all and therefore are automatically better at their job than someone who doesn't have a degree which, I am happy to say, a load of crap. I know of a few people in Adelaide who I would put technically against anyone and NONE of them have degrees - they have been offered honourary titles - but never taken them.

There is also the mind set some people have, thinking that since they've learned it all at uni, so they dont need/want to bother learning anything else.

Given the choice in the people I've worked with - I'll take someone who hasnt got a degree and has taught themselves - they are almost always, in my experience better at what they do.

I did 2 years of uni with good marks before I decided that wasnt what I wanted to do - sure I aquired some very useful skills from my time at uni (mainly my *nix background), and they do teach some very useful skills at University, however from my experience, people without degrees tend to be harder working, know their job/equipment inside out and just get on and get the job done.

Keep in mind this is only my experience from the areas I work in however.

M.
