Hi,

&gt; I shouldn't take the bait but... The statement that we share 97% of our DNA
&gt; with chimps therefore blah blah ...  demonstrates the author is over dramatic
&gt; or an idiot.  Of the ~3.2 billion base pairs of DNA in humans less than 5% is
&gt; coding the remainder is non-coding (much of which is evolutionarily obsolete
&gt; junk).  

The so called 'junk' DNA is now thought to be something other than 'junk'.

Assuming chimps & humans are closely related & the difference between
&gt; us is within that 5% of genetically active DNA, we would only really share 40%
&gt; etc etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Each human being is 99.9 percent identical to every other human being, in terms
&gt; of DNA.  But the 0.1 percent difference is incredibly important. 
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine a world where misleading journalists were selected against instead of
&gt; rewarded :)

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. 3.2 billion base pairs.  Unlike binary (01), DNA has four bases (atcg) and
&gt; they are in pairs, ie the backup is the other  strand of the double helix.  All
&gt; we have to do now is solve what languages the 3.2 billion base pairs were
&gt; written in.

&gt;  Super Bad News Bears for all programmers, database admins,
&gt;  website designers, you have been replaced by an ape that will
&gt;  work for 93 cents an hour!  Go see
&gt;  <A HREF="http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp.">http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp.</A>
&gt;  
&gt;  This is good for smaller companies that cannot afford to
&gt;  hire real people to do their IT work.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
&gt; 

regards
