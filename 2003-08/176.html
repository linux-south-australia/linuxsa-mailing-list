Robyn,

&gt; What a ridiculous ?discussion about Open Office.

;-P

&gt; If I left a message asking a question about something as unquallified as
&gt; the messages about OO I'd get told where to go or RTFM.

Yes, they've been telling me that too ;)

&gt; Open Office 1.0.3 is slow no buts about it. On my Celeron 1.7GHz laptop
&gt; with 256MB Ram and RH 9 it takes roughly 15 - 30 secs to start. I don't
&gt; know about any preloader available for Linux. 

It's about the same for us here.

I think that it's mostly IO bound and not to do with the speed of the
processor, which is to say I think that you'll get more bang for bucks if
you increase the speed of your hard disk than your processor.

&gt; I think this is a reasonably spec'd computer and I'd like Open Office to
&gt; start faster. This is a problem because some people/ customers question
&gt; its abilities because of its slowness.

The link you might like to look at is:

 * <A HREF="http://www.bytebot.net/openoffice/faq.html">http://www.bytebot.net/openoffice/faq.html</A>#Misc1

..it explains and has links for the quick starters. But I'm not sure having
OpenOffice preloaded all the time is a good solution in spite of Linux's VM
handling.

[1] I'm not entirely certain what to do about the subject, so I chose to not
change it. *heh*
