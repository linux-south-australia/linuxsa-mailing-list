Michael,


That's the "candy" they give you [please forgive the US dialect] to hook you. 
The downside comes when you download a kernel and try to make it work.

Are you really happy to have a distribution which is incompatible
with the latest kernel? I usually keep the same distro on a machine
for a few years - when I want to try a new distro version, I buy a 
new machine to put it on. But I do like to update old kernels.
Recently I updated the kernel on a SuSE machine which was only a
couple of months old - and the entire music software stopped working.
The reason was that they had back-ported the kernel 2.5.x ALSA software
into the 2.4.x kernel. So now every time I update the kernel modules
(which is 10 times a day during active deveopment), I have to also
re-install ALSA over the top of this.

The worst thing is that I can't work out how to build the kernel from
even the customised sources. When I try to recompile the SuSE kernel from the
supplied source package, it just doesn't build a usable kernel. They didn't
provide the .config file. So the rest of the source is pretty much useless.

My measure of the "customisation badness" of a distribution would be this
test:  Can you download any more recent kernel or package from source
from the net and get it working on the distribution with reasonable effort?
If you can't, then you _are_ "locked in".

I just mention this as an example of what the article was talking about.
In an attempt to get more control over users, the distro vendors are
getting up to all sorts of sneeky tricks to "brand" their "product".
This kind of alienation of users from the means of distribution will
lead to much unhappiness in the long run, requiring yet another revolution. 

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
