Hi

I don't think you're supposed to put things in the /proc directory. I
have a downloads directory that I play with in /home/robyn/downloads and
until things are working they stay somewhere under there. In Linux I
temporarily put stuff I want to try in /etc/rc.local and you would put

insmod /directory where you put module/3c2000.o and after removing the
already loaded module try rerunning rc.local after this you could try
removing this if it works and putting a line in /etc/modules.conf

alias eth0 3c2000

when your Linux asks for eth0 the module 3c2000 will be loaded.

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; I have recently upgraded my system by installing a new ABIT IS7 (p4)
&gt; motherboard. The board is good and has on board gigabit lan (even
&gt; though
&gt; the specs say otherwise)
&gt; So far I have managed to track down a module for the LAN from ASUS
&gt; (of all places) (which runs the same 3com onboard chip) The module
&gt; appears
&gt; to work as I compiled it and fired up eth0 and I could ping my other
&gt; machines.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is I have tried running insmod 3c2000.o and it placed it
&gt; in
&gt; /proc/modules I pinged but I cant do much else - the gateway and other
&gt; things are not setup (normally done from the DHCP server but seeing I
&gt; manually ifconfig up I hardcoded the ip address ). I have never faced
&gt; this
&gt; (installing a custom module) before as most of my hardware was always
&gt; a
&gt; generation behind and always autodetected.
&gt; 
&gt; So if someone could advise me on the correct procedure for installing
&gt; a NIC driver so I can get this up and running I'd
&gt; appreciate it.
&gt; 
&gt; I may have another question regarding with ac97 sound but Im sure
&gt; that's
&gt; wont be a hassle as it's not as new as the gigbit lan stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
