Hi

For lots of things computer & Linux you'll find that www.google.com.au
is your friend. Enter the modem brand or model number and linux and
search. Hopefully you'll find something about someone having done
something with your modem and linux (try with all hardware). The
distribution webpages or package webpages will tell you about
compatibilities also.

Try to give as much info as you can when you post. If you get an error
message, find out what you can first ie search google, then ask the
list. Tell us what you've done yourself, what the error message is and
the piece of hardware/software it's referring to (if relevant).

Friday nights some meet at David Lloyd's (for food, drink and Linux) so
if you want to join us, ask David.

&gt; Umm, Hi? Just subscribed to the mailing list (and was amazed to see
&gt; my inbox tripple in size)
&gt; 
&gt; Ignore the subject tag - it's just to make mail rules a little easier
&gt; 
&gt; As you can probably see, I'm still in Windows but only because I've
&gt; just reinstalled and left a quarter of the hard drive unpartitioned
&gt; so I have space for Linux (last time I tried installing it, Mandrake
&gt; wouldn't get past the initial boot and Debian wouldn't let me resize
&gt; the FAT32 partition). I was wondering, in your opinions, which should
&gt; I go with? Mandrake 9 or Debian 3? I have both on CD sets. My ex and
&gt; lots of our friends all say Debian but I'm not exactly experienced in
&gt; Linux yet (apart from it saving my rear a last year when the Windows
&gt; dialup went wonky and the only way I could connect was through
&gt; Mandrake 8.0)
&gt; 
&gt; Issues that will influence me include the Brooktree capture card I've
&gt; been using to convert all the video tapes I've bought over the years
&gt; over to VCD, some rather odd results trying to print to m HP IIIP
&gt; laser printer in Linux (test page turned into 30 pages of jargon) and
&gt; not even knowing if my webcam, scanner and digital camera even HAVE a
&gt; Linux driver available. While I know I can still dual boot, it'd be
&gt; nice not to have to swap OS just to access the devices. The main
&gt; reason for dual boot is that I like to play the occasional game :)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I'll be transferring to ADSL in the near future. I think the
&gt; D-link ADSL internal modem comes with Linux drivers, though. Will
&gt; this mean many headaches during the changeover?
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry to bombard you with so many questions straight up
