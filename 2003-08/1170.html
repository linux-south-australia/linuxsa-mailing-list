&gt; Now let's bring this analogy to light. Whilst I am not suggesting that 
&gt; Linux users are terrorists by any means, they are probably the ones that 
&gt; are exploiting the holes in all of Microsoft's systems, resulting in 
&gt; them finding thousands. Microsoft (western society) is happy with 
&gt; something that is easy to use, and doesn't require a degree in rocket 
&gt; science to understand. They have got no beef with trying to exploit the 
&gt; holes in Linux, resulting in 'not many' being found.

You may as well read something into the fact that the
*only* operating system discovered on captured Al Queda
and JI laptops has been Windows.

Perhaps Microsoft encourages terrorism?

I suggest your analogy fails for two reasons.  Firstly, Linux
users aren't raving religious fundementalists with CIA-sponsored
training in bomb making.  From my close reading of the GPL I can't
see any mention of "violent creation of an Islamic Law state" or
its software equivalent.

Secondly, most Linux advocates are interested in Linux.  This
makes them the least likely people to know or care about Windows.
Let alone the minor details of buffer overflows in some
out-of-the-way DLL.

&gt; I come from a Microsoft background, and am TRYING very hard to get my 
&gt; head around Linux. I'm a smart guy

It's smart to accuse people of criminal acts based on some
amazingly tenuous "analogy"?  Us less smart people use a
technique called "evidence".

&gt; I hope no one has taken offense to this, as it was not my intention.

Not so much offended as wondering where in the world your
head is at.

Regards,
Glen
