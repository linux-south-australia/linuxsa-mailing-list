If you can get your hands on an old p200 (or even a p100) with around 32MB RAM 
and &gt; 200MB disk space, you might wanna try running your box behind a 
dedicated firewall, especially if you're using windows. I recommend ipcop:

www.ipcop.org

It's a linux mini-distro that installs in about 5 minutes and can be 
configured in about 2 minutes, seriously (assuming it works on your 
hardware/network card, etc). I've downloaded the 3rd patch to 1.3.0 and it's 
so amazingly stable and reliable for me. It also means that you can boot into 
various OS's on your desktop computer without having to reconnect to the net.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt;
&gt; not sure if mine is the same problem but my XP drive just won't boot
&gt; up, something has trasshed the system file.
&gt;
&gt; When I look over the drive I find an entry in the security.log with
&gt;  7 vbs files that have run, all with "IIS..." as the first letters of
&gt;  the filename.
&gt;
&gt; I also saw the word Dirty several times in several of the logs. I
&gt;  am pretty sure I have been hit but no idea what it was and no idea
&gt;  what needs to be done to get my drive under control.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a file I can run in Linux that will tell me what has
&gt;  infected my XP drive? I know I cant correct it because it is
&gt;  NTFS but even knowing what it is will help me plan recovery.
&gt;
&gt; Thank goodness I have SUSE and Evolution to keep me in touch with
&gt;  the real world at LinuxSA.
