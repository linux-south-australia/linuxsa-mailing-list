Hi,

I know very little about ADSL deals and connection problems.
How problematic is it?
If you do this deal, 
what are the problems getting it to work under Redhat 9, if any?
How long do you have to wait for it to be activated (including having
your normal phone working)?
Are there any hidden costs, such as extra h/w (ethernet cards etc.)?

Has anyone connected through adam ADSL with Redhat 9 and the below
suggested h/w (Billion) and plan, and what, if any, were the *perceived*
improvements in speed.

I'd like to know more (obviously gotta move to *DSL someday),

kind regards,
Luke
