Thanks Alan, Jim and Richard and to Roger and David, who contacted me off 
list.

Roger & Richard provided the following address to explain what's happening.

Seems to sum up the nature of the content (sobig worm).  Pretty much spot on:

###############
Analysts report that the sender's address is spoofed. The subject lines used 
are taken from a list, including 'Re: That movie', 'Re: Wicked screensaver', 
'Re: Approved' and 'Your details'. 
###############
Those are the exact headers being used. 


Also in that page:
###############
Like other variants of Sobig, the worm is programmed to stop working on a 
particular date. Sobig-F is designed to quit on Sept. 10. 
###############

Mmm.  Sept 10.  Hopefully most people will be able to stop their machines 
sending well before then.

The messages arrive in my mail box(es) at the rate of about 1 every 5 or 10 
minutes.  

Alan, is that the same sort of rate they're hitting you ? 

Cheers,

Andrew

&gt; &gt; The e-mail header says it all and it's not something I'm quite sure how
&gt; &gt; to deal with (as I never have before).  These messages have kept coming

&gt; &gt; Accross 3 accounts, they're adding up quickly.
&gt;
&gt; Andrew,
&gt;
&gt; It's funny you should mention that. I had a sudden huge increase in
&gt; spam attempts over the last 9 hours.
&gt; It started at 05:16 (UTC+0930) this morning - all from a single IP address:
&gt;
&gt; cpe-24-24-251-175.socal.rr.com[24.24.251.175]
&gt;
&gt; And they were all going to a single e-mail address which I created for
&gt; 2 days and exposed on slashdot.org. Then I removed it.
&gt; Since then, I've received lots of intermittent spam attempts to this
&gt; non-existent e-mail address - which are all logged nicely by postfix.
&gt;
&gt; I received 69 e-mails from this single IP address, all to the same
&gt; destination e-mail address, but all with different fake source e-mail
&gt; addresses. Then I got tired of watching this garbage and used the iptables.
&gt;
&gt; But my point is that not a single other of my 40 e-mail aliases has been
&gt; affected. Only the one which I exposed for a couple of days about 2-3 years
&gt; ago. The spam attack is now continuing to this single slashdot-exposed
&gt; address at a very much reduced rate from IP source addresses like:
&gt;
&gt; proxy.ojp.usdoj.gov[149.101.22.2]
&gt; lists.ojp.usdoj.gov[149.101.22.2]
&gt; vmf-ext.prodigy.net[207.115.63.92]
&gt; vmg-ext.prodigy.net[207.115.63.93]
&gt;
&gt; It looks like someone has activated a massive spam blast from a bunch of
&gt; zombies around the world. That's my guess.
&gt; Strangely, none of my other exposed dozen or so e-mail aliases is getting
&gt; hit. So amybe someone, somewhere has a grudge against slashdot readers!!!?

Maybe it's not just slashdot readers.  Could be much broader, such as address 
lists that have been harvested from any old newsgroup out there.  In fact, 
one that I posted to only last night!!!  Dang! Dang! Dang!

Cheers,

Andrew




&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; ak.
&gt;
&gt; PS. Here's a little gratuitous but true anecdote:
&gt; I once asked an esteemed colleague in Melbourne whether he preferred me to
&gt; send him short e-mail messages to save him time. He replied that:
&gt; "The best kind of e-mail is the e-mail which you don't send."
&gt; Typical ....... humour! (I've censored the ethnicity of the humour because
&gt; I don't want to get sued by sensitive people.)
&gt; If only the spammers would listen to this guy...
