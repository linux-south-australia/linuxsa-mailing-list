Hi Dan

Whole email linking is great.

Is a citizen subject to the laws of a criminal state?

These statements worry me only because I feel laws are to be obeyed.
That said civil disobedience is fine but not always criminal
disobedience. Yes there are people unjustly detained in many places in
this world. As people with a conscience it is up to us (those with a
conscience not everybody) to do our bit in helping our society change.
Would I have joined the resistance against Nazi Germany? Too damn right
I would have.

Robyn

ps Buring with umlauts on the 'u' but I don't know how to do that here.
Definitely not a worry.

&gt; On the second matter, my family originally came from Nazi occupied Europe after 
&gt; the war where my grandfather participated in the resistance. I am very worried 
&gt; that the actions of the Australian government (when it comes to human rights of 
&gt; refugees and Aboriginies, and the involvement in a post hoc justified invasion 
&gt; of a sovereign nation - with even the post hoc evidence being questionable) is 
&gt; acting in an entirely criminal manner. When people don't protest and 
&gt; participate in civil disobedience that are ligitimating these actions.
