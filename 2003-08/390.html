&gt; wasn't it.  I had options to create, delete, etc.  I asked my self does 
&gt; this
&gt; mean I have to format my partition? I was ok with that, so I picked create
&gt; and recreated the FreeBSD partition with the default file system.

If you feel like running it again at any stage, note the dialog box it
displays to you immediately before the partition screen:  It says you
need to -mark- the FreeBSD partition you want to upgrade (after all,
you could have more than one of them!).

I agree that a tool over than the partition editor should be used for
that purpose, but there's only so much you can fit on a boot floppy
image, and that's the lowest common denominator which needs to be
aimed for.

&gt; Then it took me to the section where FreeBSD defines its slices. To be 

... with a dialog box telling you to [M]ount the slices you want to use
(remember, it doesn't know where your root filesystem is until you tell
it, so it can't look at /etc/fstab to work it out for itself.  I usually
take a "safer" option with upgrades where I only mount the slices which
contain the OS (rather than applications and data), so that I can be
sure that the installation program won't go stupid and overwrite all
my stuff.

Again, I'll agree that the slice editor isn't necessarily the best tool
for it to use;  But again, there are space restrictions in place.

&gt; Ok, so I was able to mount my floppy, so I copied the XF86Config file to my
&gt; DESKTOP and renamed it XF86Config.Linux. 

This phase of your adventure could probably have been done quicker and
better (for some value of "better") if you had just typed:

     # /usr/X11R6/bin/X -configure

That analyzes your hardware and uses the result to build an XF86Config
file (works in Linux too, btw - X is the same on any platform)

&gt; I edited /etc/rc.conf to add these lines, but the same error comes up:
&gt; #kldload snd_via82c686.ko
&gt; #kldload snd_pcm.ko

Try this:

   # cd /boot/kernel
   # kldload snd*

If your sound card has any hope of working, that'll make it work :-)
Not necessarily efficient, but it'll get you on the road.

(that kldload command simply instructs it to load every single sound
driver on the system.  One of them is bound to be the right one :-)

&gt; When I tried to install OpenOffice it would time out on a download
&gt; cd /usr/ports/editors/openoffice/
&gt; make clean install
&gt; It just dies:

Your sample output indicates that you didn't let it go for long enough.
It'll eventually get to ftp.freebsd.org after trying a pile of other
sites first, and that one will always work.
