Hey,

I recommend Mandrake 9.1. I'm using it (and I've tried others, including 
Debian), and I'm think it's by far the best one to use to get all your 
devices working. I don't think the capture card or printer will be a problem, 
dunno about the modem/scanner/digital camera (just make sure they're all 
plugged in an turned on when Mandrake installs). The GF4 will work like a 
treat, just go to www.nvidia.com and download the drivers for Linux on IA32, 
then run the install script, modify /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 so that it says 
Driver "nvidia" rather than Driver "nv", restart X and enjoy.

As far as package management goes, go to 
<A HREF="http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php">http://plf.zarb.org/~nanardon/urpmiweb.php</A> and select the "Contrib" and "plf" 
package repositories, run each command it spits out as root (type "su" at a 
terminal and enter your password to become root) one after the other.

Then to install software, go to k-&gt;Configuration-&gt;Packaging-&gt;Install software. 
Then search or browse the package lists for additional software (some are big 
downloads so make sure you click "Maximum Information" so you can see what 
source your package comes from, i.e. internet or CD). I recommend getting 
mplayer from plf and the win32-codecs package so you can play videos. I also 
recommend kmplayer as a frontend to mplayer.

For DVD playback, I recommend "ogle". The version in plf is 0.8.5, which is 
okay, but if you want 4/5.1 channel surround sound (assuming you have a card 
that supports this under Linux), then you need version 0.9.1 which can be 
found at:

<A HREF="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/index.shtml">http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/index.shtml</A>

The RH 7.x rpms seemed to work for me.

Another download you'll want is the freetype2 package from plf, this will 
upgrade your mandrake True Type Font renderer so it supports byte-code 
interpretation (a patented technology that can't be included in the 
distribution), this makes your fonts look heaps better. Then in the Mandrake 
control centre, go to System-&gt;Drakfont and select "Get Windows Fonts". You 
may need to restart xfs (type "service xfs restart" as root) and/or X (press 
ctrl-alt-backspace) for the new fonts to be recognised.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; Umm, Hi? Just subscribed to the mailing list (and was amazed to see
&gt; my inbox tripple in size)
&gt;
&gt; Ignore the subject tag - it's just to make mail rules a little easier
&gt;
&gt; As you can probably see, I'm still in Windows but only because I've
&gt; just reinstalled and left a quarter of the hard drive unpartitioned
&gt; so I have space for Linux (last time I tried installing it, Mandrake
&gt; wouldn't get past the initial boot and Debian wouldn't let me resize
&gt; the FAT32 partition). I was wondering, in your opinions, which should
&gt; I go with? Mandrake 9 or Debian 3? I have both on CD sets. My ex and
&gt; lots of our friends all say Debian but I'm not exactly experienced in
&gt; Linux yet (apart from it saving my rear a last year when the Windows
&gt; dialup went wonky and the only way I could connect was through
&gt; Mandrake 8.0)
&gt;
&gt; Issues that will influence me include the Brooktree capture card I've
&gt; been using to convert all the video tapes I've bought over the years
&gt; over to VCD, some rather odd results trying to print to m HP IIIP
&gt; laser printer in Linux (test page turned into 30 pages of jargon) and
&gt; not even knowing if my webcam, scanner and digital camera even HAVE a
&gt; Linux driver available. While I know I can still dual boot, it'd be
&gt; nice not to have to swap OS just to access the devices. The main
&gt; reason for dual boot is that I like to play the occasional game :)
&gt;
&gt; Also, I'll be transferring to ADSL in the near future. I think the
&gt; D-link ADSL internal modem comes with Linux drivers, though. Will
&gt; this mean many headaches during the changeover?
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to bombard you with so many questions straight up
