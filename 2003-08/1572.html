IBM warns more monitors may be fire hazards

IBM on Thursday expanded its recall of certain 15-inch monitors, saying
hundreds of thousands more units have a potentially faulty part that
could create a fire hazard. 

The computing giant issued the original recall last March, covering its
G51 and G51t models of 15-inch CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors. The
company said that models produced between June 1997 and September 1997
resulted in 117,000 units recalled worldwide, 56,000 of which were in
the United States. The monitors had a component that could fail and emit
smoke. IBM said it has received seven reports worldwide of monitors
overheating, with one resulting in "minor property damage." 

The updated recall notice, posted on Thursday on IBM's Web site and that
of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, expands the recall to
cover monitors made between June 1997 and September 1998. The expanded
recall covers a total of 235,000 monitors worldwide, with 119,000 in the
United States. The number of recalled units represents roughly a third
of the 685,000 units produced throughout the monitors' lifecycle of June
1997 to April 1999. 


"After we did the recall in March, we received two more reports of
smoking," said Bob Page, an IBM spokesman. "One of the reports fell
outside (the earlier recall period) by four days. So, as a result, we
extended the recall by one year to September 1998." 


The monitors were made for IBM by Taiwan-based manufacturer Lite-On
Technology and sold under the IBM brand at major retailers such as Best
Buy, CompUSA and RadioShack. 


To identify whether a monitor is covered by the recall, consumers need
to look at the label on the back, which includes its model number and
manufacturing date. The recall covers G51 monitors with a model number
of 6541-02N, 6541-02E or 6541-02S, and manufacture date between June
1997 and September 1998. Model numbers for the G51T are 6541-Q0N,
6541-Q0E and 6541-Q0S. 


IBM advises customers with affected monitors to stop using the equipment
and contact Big Blue to arrange for inspection and repair or, if
necessary, replacement. US customers should call the IBM Repair Centre
at 1-866-644-3155. International customers should consult IBM's Web
directory to find the correct number for their country.
