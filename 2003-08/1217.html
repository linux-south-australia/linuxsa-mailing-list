Paul,

Thanks for the info.  I actually had reasonably lengthy discussions a
while back with Gordon Hubbard from CustomTech, the Samsung Contact
distributors in Sydney.  The sticking point with Samsung Contact is the
license fees.  I'm looking at around $160 per user, just for each
mailbox.  The native client is then another $30 per user.  I hear it is
very close to Exchange, but I havent tried it yet simply because of the
cost.

Appreciate your help, though.  I _might_ one day get around to trying it
if I can't find anything better  :)

Ok, that is pretty clear now.

Brad, I would download a 45 day trial of Samsung Contact and see if it 
meets your needs. If anyone has tried it I am interested in feedback as 
well.

 From their site:

Samsung Contact + Outlook = Happy, productive users with no unplanned 
email downtime


A perfect match made in email heaven. Users love Outlook, and Samsung 
Contact provides the best email server for all of Outlook's great 
messaging and collaboration functions. This includes calendaring, 
scheduling, resources, public folders, delegation, and offline folders. 
Samsung Contact running as the email server for Outlook brings many 
benefits. Apart from the obvious scalability, security and reliability 
benefits of using Samsung Contact, we provide functionality improvements

in the areas of scheduling and offline folder synchronization.Other 
vendors are trying to catch up with our position, but none have as much 
experience in providing a great user experience with Outlook. Our team 
of engineers has extensive experience of Outlook collaboration since 
their time on OpenMail. You can be assured that Samsung are 
strategically committed to continue tracking and supporting new versions

of Outlook. If you have registered, you can download Samsung Contact and

start using it now in our FREE 45 day trial .

&gt; You're close, but I never said free (in fact I said I'm happy to pay
&gt; for it), and I never said "easy to use" or "you beaut" - if I wanted 
&gt; that I'd stick with Windows and Exchange, cos it is pretty easy to use

&gt; and if you like nice graphical point and click stuff, it's you beaut 
&gt; too (I do say this with tongue firmly in cheek...).  And I'm after 
&gt; more than just a calendar server.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm after a Linux "equivalent" of Exchange (or close to it), which
&gt; Outlook clients can connect to, which provides much of the 
&gt; functionality of Exchange, such as shared scheduling, free/busy data, 
&gt; public folders, folder permissions, delegates, global address lists, 
&gt; etc et al.  I also was interested to hear of experiences that anyone 
&gt; had had with doing such a thing or trying out Bynari, OpenExchange, 
&gt; etc et al.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not really interested in Evolution, because as you know it's
&gt; difficult/impossible to convert average Windows/Outlook/Office users 
&gt; to Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks anyway for the info, I have learned a bit more about Evolution
&gt; out of it, which is always a good thing  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Brad.
