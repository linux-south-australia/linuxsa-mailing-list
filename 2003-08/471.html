Ian,

At this early stage, I would say that 12% fazed developers is quite a high
number. You would hardly expect linux developers to down tools en masse
and start developing for Macs and such.

What might faze a few more percent of linux developers might be
the next time they look at a contract to supply a product and they
re-read this sort of scary thing:

  The Contractor shall indemnify, and keep indemnified, the Client, and any 
  person acting on its behalf, against any and all liability, loss, damage, 
  costs (including the cost of any settlement and legal costs and expenses 
  on a solicitor/client basis), compensation, or expense whatsoever incurred 
  by them, arising out of any action, claim or proceeding brought by a third 
  party in respect of:

  - an infringement or alleged infringement of that third party's Intellectual 
  Property where that infringement is based on Intellectual Property contained 
  in the deliverables; 

If anyone can give me a bit more clarity on this sort of thing, I'd be
much obliged. It looks to me like developers providing linux-based solutions
could be asked to cough up the money for the SCO racket.

-	First SCO goes to the Client and asks for money.
-	Then the Client goes to the Contractor to ask for the money
	to pay to SCO.

It seems to me that it's those indemnity clauses that might make
linux developers think a bit about the SCO danger, whether they think
the claims are valid or not.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
