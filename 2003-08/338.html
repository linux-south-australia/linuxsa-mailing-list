&gt; Angus,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't doubt that that will happen, but I don't like the idea -- it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;merely destructive.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Well, it would tend to reinforce the stereotype that Linux users are 
&gt;&gt;(naughty, teenage, unprofessional, pimply, unlawful, etc) 'hackers' (I 
&gt;&gt;trust you understand the context in which I use this  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree.
&gt; 
&gt; We are mature, generally law abiding citizens who all happened to be
&gt; concerned about the licence we are being asked to pay for. Hence we just
&gt; happened to want to look at it.
&gt; 
&gt; At the same time.

We're probably all savvy enough to see that it doesn't quite add up. 
The court process is only five months old yet they have on their website 
offerings for licences. (?) They seem like the ultimate optimists.  I'd 
like to know how well SCO has been performing in the market place 
because linux has had no influence on their performance or financial 
position.  Linux doesn't compete with SCO/unix yet even if their claims 
were true.

Conrad.
