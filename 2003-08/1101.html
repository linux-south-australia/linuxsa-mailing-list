Hang on, I just said I didn't think the punishment is constructive, not that
she shouldn't be punished or that a major penalty shouldn't apply. Nor do I
think she's innocent of the charges she was convicted of. I just think in
terms of the crime, 3 years jail is a punishment usually meted out to
violent criminals, not those which include money. Just locking her up like
she's a threat to decent people will make her a martyr. Forcing her to do a
few years of hard community service in, say, the AP lands here in SA might
enlighten her as to the idiocy of her views whilst she was a politician. A
more constructive solution in my eyes. Behind bars, she'll see her idiot
supporters continually telling her she was wronged and would probably
solidify the same in her own mind. 

Even as someone who's Aboriginal, I don't think she's evil, just misguided
and I think locking someone away should be reserved for those who can't
function in our current society such as people who perpetrate violent crimes
etc. She needs to be educated as well as punished I think.

As for political interference, if someone like Wilson Tuckey can be brazen
enough to post three letters effectively telling an opposition senator to
break the law (thereby abusing his parliamentary privilege), why could
someone smarter not manipulate a trial such as Pauline's? You don't think
jurors or judges can be got to?

Mind you, I agree absolutely with you about Oldfield. He most certainly
should have been up in the dock with the others.

 &gt; You might not agree with her policies, what she stands for or even (in my

community  &gt; service in an ATSIC region community or something for say 5
years.

Defrauding the Government out of half a million dollars is a major crime in
anyone's language.  Why shouldn't it attract a major penalty?

While I'm sure the sentance will be reduced on appeal, I don't think 
it's unjust.  A randomly selected jury of her peers agreed that she and
Ettridge set out with deliberate premeditation to use the electoral system
to "make money fast."  How does that smell like political 
interference?

Bear in mind that there are also charges pending against her for 
defrauding her legal defence fund out of a new car and a couple of credit
card bills.  Judgement hasn't been handed down in those cases so we must
presume innocence;  But if she is declared guilty, will a record of habitual
and pervasive fraud sway any of the people who think she's currently being
treated unjustly?

(In my opinion, the only injustice here is that Oldfield hasn't been charged
too -- As party secretary, he must have had a material involvement.  See
<A HREF="http://www.muslimterrorists.com">http://www.muslimterrorists.com</A> if you want to know what that virulent
racist scumbag is up to these days...)
