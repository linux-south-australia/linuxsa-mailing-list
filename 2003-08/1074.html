&gt;&gt; Its most likely the new variant of the Sobig virus.  We've seen nearly 60
&gt;&gt; copies of this today, directed mainly at our customers sales@&lt;domain&gt;
type
&gt;&gt; addresses.  This is consistent with the virus harvesting email addresses
&gt;
&gt;The sales@ addresses prove nothing. I get heaps of spams addresses to
&gt;<A HREF="mailto:sales@domain">sales@domain</A> for all of my domains, but I don't have a single user called
&gt;"sales". It's just pure speculative addressing.  The same is true with
&gt;"webmaster". I get spams to these although I deleted all such user names a
very
&gt;long time ago, and I've never exposed these addresses at all on web pages.
&gt;Another such speculative e-mail address I've seen is <A HREF="mailto:jobs@domain.">jobs@domain.</A>

Alan, 

We're not actually getting email addressed to sales@&lt;domain&gt;...  We don't
have generic users called sales, etc either.  What I was trying to say
earlier, is that we are getting a large quantity of these things being sent
to "sales" and "enquiries" type email addresses which are published on web
sites and the like.  In each domain we host only 1 or 2 users are getting
hit by this virus, and in each case the address is published somewhere.  The
virus doesn't appear to be spamming all likely email addresses in a blind
fashion, but it does appear to be collecting email addresses from web sites,
etc (Symantec, McAfee, etc confirm this too).

Jim.
