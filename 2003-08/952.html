Brendan,
Several things:

Talk to some banks.  You'll need a merchant account and ultimately 
you'll have to play along with them.  Most of them now have online 
transaction systems.  Camtech (where I used to work) offered an Ecommerce 
system to do this, not sure of the current state.

Second, WHY would you be storing the cc numbers?  Why wouldn't you be 
sending the cc straight to the bank (eg. Westpac, NAB, etc all have 
facilities for this) and then storing only an obscured pan (first 6, last 4 
digits) for verification?

&gt; G'day,
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't really Linux specific, but i'm sure there's some people here with
&gt; experience in this area. What i want to do is allow credit card transactions
&gt; on a planned site. I've looked at all the third-party credit card handlers
&gt; like PayPal and WorldPay etc, but they all give that amateurish look to a
&gt; site.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, the server will have some security i'd imagine, it's hosted at
&gt; rackshack.net. But what about storing credit card numbers? I doubt it's a
&gt; good idea to store the details on the actual server. How would say
&gt; EverythingLinux do it? And then after all this i have to worry about what to
&gt; do with them.. etc. And how to even get them back to me securely since the
&gt; server is in the US.
&gt; 
&gt; Actually having second thoughts about it now. It'd probably cost me an arm
&gt; and a leg to get a merchant account or whatever i need - infact anyone have
&gt; more info on this, like how to debit credit cards etc, or getting them to
&gt; like a bank to take care of them? Would i do this during the transaction on
&gt; the website?
&gt; 
&gt; I should probably buy a book on e-commerce or something..
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone can give me an outline of the whole process of doing it yourself
&gt; etc then that'd be a big help - or if you know of a third-party that handles
&gt; all this and allows it to be done securely still without having to exit the
&gt; website. I'd prefer an Australian one so i can simply get the money
&gt; transferred to a bank account.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Brendan
