&gt;&gt;Out of curiosity, and not about brain sizes I just want to know, what do 
&gt;&gt;you find that Windows 2000/2003 server does that Samba deoes not ?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;then the tight integration between Windows 2000/2003 and Windows XP clients is really nice - this is something
&gt;as far as I'm aware there is no integrated Linux solution for, but please
&gt;bear in mind I haven't looked too hard on this!
&gt;  
&gt;
Not sure what you mean by tight integration...anyway....you might find 
this information helpful in saving your clients $:

&gt;&gt;Just curious as to what features do most people use Exchange for, I have 
&gt;&gt;never used it.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;Collaboration.  Our medium and larger clients love collaboration.  Most users
&gt;in our experience however just use emailing, rules, calendar, tasks and contacts.
&gt;
Take a look at SuSE's Open Exchange Server:

<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/us/business/products/suse_business/openexchange/Online_Demo.html.">http://www.suse.com/us/business/products/suse_business/openexchange/Online_Demo.html.</A> 
It goes for US $1,249.

&gt;More advanced users tend to use grouping, document management with revisions and
&gt;quite a bit of scheduling.
&gt;  
&gt;
Yes take a look at SuSE Open Exchange Server, looks like it can handle 
this stuff.

&gt;&gt;What does "true collaboration" mean in general ?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;True collaboration as opposed to "if you send him/her a copy or keep a
&gt;copy of this information here then they can look at it and send you their
&gt;input and you include it.  Or they amend their copy, they send it to you
&gt;and you add it to your copy".
&gt;
SuSE's Open Exchange seems to have this feature as well....

&gt;Ie We have access to others information, can actively participate and
&gt;have that participation tracked, handled, controlled and initiated.
&gt;I hope this gives you some idea.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;What features do you find most lacking ?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I've seen a few that, from what it looks like, should be good once they are
&gt;stable and have been in use in substantial numbers for a while.
&gt;
That's a bit chicken and egg....and may cause an overlook of the best 
solutions available.

&gt;&gt;How could either Linux or FreeBSD with Samba be beat ?   I just don't 
&gt;&gt;see it.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;In some instances - easily (waits for flames).  Depends on how far into
&gt;this you want to go (and how much time I can spare!).  But if you want
&gt;to share files and give people permissions on those files, Linux wins
&gt;every time - in my experience if you want to go further and define roles
&gt;and extremely explicit roles based on security policies I have found
&gt;it both easier to achieve and maintain under Windows 2000/2003.
&gt;
I thought that Samba had these capabilities, but I could be wrong...

&gt;Pull down Exchange, plonk it on a box, play with it, connect to it - you'll see what I mean.
&gt;
I don't know, we have a fairly well organized server and policies in 
place to know where to find our files. If it got mass scale we'd just 
use CVS. However, I could imagine some clients may have made an 
unmanageable situation out of their file servers, and see something like 
Exchange as a solution.  

We do have job trackling, contact, email and calander software here, but 
not in one big lump. However, the pieces all fit together rather nicely 
and the idea of getting an Exchange type server seems redundant. And I 
think that was the point made originally, that there are cheaper and 
less problematic alternatives, but there is a bias against their use; 
SuSE's OpenExchange Server was overlooked, however,  it seems to be a 
very strong replacement candidate for Exchange.
