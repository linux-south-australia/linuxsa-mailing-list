&gt; Hi Greg,

&gt; You say,

&gt; Why was it not derived from this?

I went into some detail about that on the web page.  Do you have any
objections to the points I raised?

&gt; Is it really that difficult to assume that while making the minor
&gt; changes (adding the ASSERTS & spinlocks) that the comment was not
&gt; tidied up to make the first 2 sentences 1 line each and remove the
&gt; "* The swap map unit is 512 bytes." comment?

Again, read what I wrote and comment.  I went to a lot of trouble to
justify my decisions.  You seem to ignore the discussion.

&gt; I know that that's what I would have done.

Sorry, but I doubt that you would have come to such an exact match.

&gt; /*
&gt;  * Allocate 'size' units from the given
&gt;  * map. Return the base of the allocated
&gt;  (rest of example omitted)

Already the text is different.  Look at the line breaks.  That's what
SCO did, and that's why they found this particular example.

&gt; AT&T was actually found to have lost its copyright to the code in question
&gt; during the lawsuit, because the code wasn't published. This would not be
&gt; the case today, as there have been changes in copyright law. But the
&gt; judge's decision back then was:
&gt;
&gt; Consequently, I find that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood
&gt; that it can successfully defend its copyright in [Unix version] 32V.

Note that 32V has nothing whatsoever to do with the case here.  The
32V code differs significantly from the examples we're talking about.

&gt; Plaintiff's claims of copyright violations are not a basis for
&gt; injunctive relief.

Whatever that means.  But agreed.  Also, Pauline Hanson was sentenced
to three years in jail.  Considering that these are not the issues
code we're talking about, they're irrelevant to the matter.
