Are you sure that you're not taking that quote out of context? Its 
incorrect to think of human evolution progressing while other species 
remain static.
This probably seems obvious, but would mean that we probably wouldn't 
find a redundant gene present in a human 'from' a mouse.

The other thing is that DNA doesn't really code how we're made, as such. 
It codes for proteins, which in turn build other structures, which 
combine with other proteins (recursively) again and again, to eventually 
produce what we recognise... thus, the operation of DNA is massively 
more complicated than mass-media would have us believe (particularly 
when they're telling us to accept/buy/eat the hacks that they call 
'genetic engineering'), and it's entirely possible that the 'junk' code 
is vital to the correct operation of DNA.

FWIW, I remember editing a MSDOS binary file (a game - in a text editor 
*sigh*) when I was about 10, so that it wouldn't work (a single 
character change). When I undid what I had done, and saved the file 
again, I couldn't understand why it didn't work... dunno if this is a 
simile or not  ;-)

&gt; Dogma stated that when we diverged from older life forms the fish genes we no

&gt; genes are still turned on during foetal development even if briefly.  
&gt; 
&gt; Diversity allows evolution through natural selection, & gene duplication within
&gt; our genome allows individual genes to take on different functions.  We
&gt; therefore have numerous copies of very similar genes, often where only one of
&gt; the copies ever works (ie codes for the protein / enzyme etc).  These
&gt; pseudogenes often with corrupt code could be thought of as obsolete.  Below is
&gt; an example of a publication.
&gt; 
&gt; The human genome has 49 cytochrome c pseudogenes, including a relic of a
&gt; promordial gene that still functions in mouse.

&gt;&gt;Hi,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I shouldn't take the bait but... The statement that we share 97% of our DNA
&gt;&gt;&gt;with chimps therefore blah blah ...  demonstrates the author is over
&gt; 
&gt; dramatic
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;or an idiot.  Of the ~3.2 billion base pairs of DNA in humans less than 5%
&gt; 
&gt; is
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;coding the remainder is non-coding (much of which is evolutionarily
&gt; 
&gt; obsolete
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;junk).  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The so called 'junk' DNA is now thought to be something other than 'junk'.

&gt; 
&gt; The fact that it was even called 'junk' is beyond me
