Hi Evan,

Well - I have to disagree on this one.  I am compelled to give you a response from a person who loves Linux, yet still uses, sells and installs MS (or Microsoft) products.  I assure you none of our guys here, who all use Linux and MS, are pea brained.  We use combinations of Windows 2003/Windows 2000 and Linux servin a mixed environment.  Over 90% of clients we deal with have installed either Windows 2000 or XP with Linux servers and desktops, where relevant, performing various tasks.

However we are yet to find a worthwhile replacement to Microsoft Exchange Server (version 2000 and up) that gives you the collaboration ability that Microsoft Exchange does.  Although most people probably use only around 10% of the abilities of Exchange, when they are educated as to its abilities the management of information and collaboration in an organisation invariably increases with resultant economies.  This is based on pure experience - not theory - from a person who would happily put an Exchange replacement in spec if there was a worthwhile replacement for true collaboration.  Obviously you don't or haven't bothered to obtain an understanding on what Exchange actually does for an organisation.  I suggest you inform yourself of this before you rant about the attitudes of professionals who use MS products.  As we sit today in our opinion- for collaboration - MS Exchange is better than any current open source projects we have looked at.

In regard to ISA server I again respectfully suggest you obtain an understanding of what it does.  I certainly agree there are better firewalls out there but the proxy is not too bad at all.  Whilst I am not entirely happy with ISA server I also am not happy with Squid at the moment as they currently have interoperability issues with dynamic content, in particular .asp and .cfm sites (to name a couple that I have found).
