&gt; EMACS rocks compared to ludwig.  As soon as we were allowed to use emacs at

Matthew,

The ludwig I'm using appears to be bug-free. The principal advantage for me in
the ludwig is that it is "\-driven". With vi, I _always_ forget if I'm in
insert mode or command mode. With ludwig, it's generally very clear what I'm
doing, which implies many fewer horrible editing errors.  There are definite
limitations to ludwig, like you can't edit a sendmail configuration file
properly, because that uses TAB chars to separate 3 fields per line. It is also
limited to 400 chars per line, only does 7-bit chars, and so forth. But it's
still head and shoulders above emacs and vi for software development. I'm
obviously in a different universe. So I won't try to convince you to my point
of view. Co-existence is possible.

&gt; &gt; Someone on this list recently ported it to linux.  In the last two weeks
&gt; &gt; or so, I've written 6407 lines of software with ludwig.  On two days, I
&gt; &gt; wrote about 1000 lines on each day.  There's no way I could do that with
&gt; &gt; other editors that I know of.  (This is all user-space GTK+ software,
&gt; &gt; which is fairly repetitive in some respects.  Writing in the kernel
&gt; &gt; doesn't go that fast...)
&gt; 
&gt; No offense AK, I'm not sure what this says about you but DSTO did something
&gt; wierd to your head.  
   ^^

Yes, DSTO did do something weird to my head. But I left in 1999 and now I've
almost recovered, as long as I keep taking the pills and doing the exercises...

As soon as I get some spare time, I'll study vi/vim and see if I can compel it
somehow to have some of the virtues of ludwig. My past attempts have been
disappointing. But maybe I can write some patches for it!  If you think that
ludwig is from another era, then vi is worse than that.  Vi was derived from
ed, which was designed for a real TTY - like you sat at the keyboard and when
you changed line 23, you would command "ed" to print line 23 and it would come
out of the printer. The rest of the file had to be in your brain cache.

Cheers,
ak.
