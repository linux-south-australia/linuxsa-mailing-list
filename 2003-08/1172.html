In my amateur opinion, the reverse is really true.
Unix has been around a lot longer than MS operating systems.
Therefore it has learned from its past vulnerabilities, such as the
big worm of 1988 which took out thousands of Sun computers (and some other
brand which I forget). After this, a lot of unix vendors ripped "finger"
out of their distributions because it used "gets", which is one of the
worst C functions ever.

So first:  Unix has learned from a longer history, and linux is part of
that history. Linux is an implementation of the unix OS architecture
and modular design philosophy.

Second: unix operating systems are all designed from the ground up
for multi-user operation, often in hostile environments with thousands
of uni CS students trying to hack into them. That's got to be about the
most hostile threat that an OS can face.
