Ok, that is pretty clear now.

Brad, I would download a 45 day trial of Samsung Contact and see if it
meets your needs. If anyone has tried it I am interested in feedback as
well.

 From their site:

Samsung Contact + Outlook = Happy, productive users with no unplanned
email downtime


A perfect match made in email heaven. Users love Outlook, and Samsung
Contact provides the best email server for all of Outlook's great
messaging and collaboration functions. This includes calendaring,
scheduling, resources, public folders, delegation, and offline folders.
Samsung Contact running as the email server for Outlook brings many
benefits. Apart from the obvious scalability, security and reliability
benefits of using Samsung Contact, we provide functionality improvements
in the areas of scheduling and offline folder synchronization.Other
vendors are trying to catch up with our position, but none have as much
experience in providing a great user experience with Outlook. Our team
of engineers has extensive experience of Outlook collaboration since
their time on OpenMail. You can be assured that Samsung are
strategically committed to continue tracking and supporting new versions
of Outlook. If you have registered, you can download Samsung Contact and
start using it now in our FREE 45 day trial .

&gt; David,

&gt; You're close, but I never said free (in fact I said I'm happy to pay for
&gt; it), and I never said "easy to use" or "you beaut" - if I wanted that
&gt; I'd stick with Windows and Exchange, cos it is pretty easy to use and if
&gt; you like nice graphical point and click stuff, it's you beaut too (I do
&gt; say this with tongue firmly in cheek...).  And I'm after more than just
&gt; a calendar server.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm after a Linux "equivalent" of Exchange (or close to it), which
&gt; Outlook clients can connect to, which provides much of the functionality
&gt; of Exchange, such as shared scheduling, free/busy data, public folders,
&gt; folder permissions, delegates, global address lists, etc et al.  I also
&gt; was interested to hear of experiences that anyone had had with doing
&gt; such a thing or trying out Bynari, OpenExchange, etc et al.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not really interested in Evolution, because as you know it's
&gt; difficult/impossible to convert average Windows/Outlook/Office users to
&gt; Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks anyway for the info, I have learned a bit more about Evolution
&gt; out of it, which is always a good thing  :)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Brad.
