Subject: Re: Hello [LinuxSA]

&gt;Data,

&gt;&gt; Umm, Hi? Just subscribed to the mailing list (and was amazed to see
&gt;&gt; my inbox tripple in size)

&gt;Didn't you get blown up...

No, just not used to having so many emails in a matter of a few hours.
Normally I don't get that many in a day

&gt;&gt; Ignore the subject tag - it's just to make mail rules a little easier

&gt;There's an X-Mailing-List header on all LinuxSA e-mails...

Hrm, I don't know if OE has the ability to use that, but once I have Linux
up, I'll probably do most of my emailing there. Unless I can figure out how
to drive Mozilla ;)

&gt;&gt; I was wondering, in your opinions, which should
&gt;&gt; I go with? Mandrake 9 or Debian 3? I have both on CD sets. My ex and
&gt;&gt; lots of our friends all say Debian but I'm not exactly experienced in
&gt;&gt; Linux yet.

&gt;To be honest, go with Mandrake 9.1. Debian is a good system but Mandrake 9
&gt;or 9.1 (or 9.2) will make your ride a little less bumpy.

I tinkered with RH, too. But only a few days before someone needed to borrow
the computer. Which is easier to upgrade, btw?

&gt;&gt; Also, I'll be transferring to ADSL in the near future. I think the
&gt;&gt; D-link ADSL internal modem comes with Linux drivers, though. Will
&gt;&gt; this mean many headaches during the changeover?

&gt;Probably not. A model number would be useful but if D-Link say they have
&gt;drivers they generally do (unlike some other !@#$ companies).

Modem's a DSL-100D PCI modem
Capture card is a 878TV bought second hand last year (I'd have to go hunting
for those drivers)
Oh, which has better GF4MX support? Or will the Nivdia drivers run in most
distos?

&gt;DSL
