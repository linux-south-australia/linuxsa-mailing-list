Hi

You could do this from a bootable installation cd. The new installation
cd's can bu used as rescue disks.

&gt; hello,
&gt;       i have a disk that is reporting:
&gt; 
&gt; find: /usr/doc/samba-common: Input/output error
&gt; 
&gt; when a cron job accesses (find in) the listed directory... indeed any
&gt; attempt to read or write to the directory produces an Input/output error.
&gt; 
&gt; Googling around, it seems likely that there is a hard error on the disk
&gt; or possibly a file system problem. The file system is ext3 and is not
&gt; normally fscked at boot.
&gt; 
&gt; qn 1: i guess i should unmount and fsck this partition. however, should
&gt; i use a rescue disk to do this since /sbin/e2fsck is on the affected
&gt; partition? at the moment, the box has no floppy drive which will mean a
&gt; wander around to find a 2nd hand floppy.
&gt; 
&gt; qn 2: assuming the filesyetem is ok, perhaps i can then low level format
&gt; the disk and mark bad sectors... but this is ugly as it means a
&gt; reinstall fromm scratch so maybe...
&gt; 
&gt; qn 3: if the filesystem is ok, should i then assume the disk is a dud
&gt; for now and look to replace it? it is an old 2gig scsi disk - is it
&gt; possible to just 'dd' off the contents to another disk of similar
&gt; (larger in this case - 4 gig) size, mount the new disk in place of the
&gt; old and expect all data to be happily transferred and functional?
&gt; 
&gt; (from some limited experience dd'ing files between /dev/fd0u1440 and
&gt; /dev/fd0u1680 devices, i wonder if dd is at all happy when the source
&gt; and target disks do not match in size (noting of course that you can't
&gt; fit 1.68 Mbytes on a 1.44 Meg floppy!). dd'ing a 1.4 meg floppy to a
&gt; formatted 1.68 meg floppy seemed to limit the new disk to only ever
&gt; having 1.44 Megs of capapcity...
&gt; 
&gt; i guess after doing this i can then try the lowlevel format and mark bad
&gt; sectors on the error disk to have a backup disk for the next bad day?
&gt; 
&gt; anway, it would be good to get some insight into this from the linuxsa
&gt; gurus before pulling things apart as the box in question is pretty
&gt; central to my home/work network. :-)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
&gt; 
&gt;     matt
&gt; 
&gt; ps: the linuxsa mailing list archives don't obfuscate the email address
&gt; of the correspondents. anecdotally, have people's names been sucked up
&gt; by crawlers and added to the spammers target lists?
&gt; 
&gt; pps: when subscribed to the linuxsa digest, what email address allows 
&gt; you to post to the list? the linuxsa mailing list faq says:
&gt; 
&gt;    "You use the same address to post to the list."
&gt; 
&gt; but subscribing to the digest list and posting returns an error like:
&gt; 
&gt; * You are not subscribed to the list.
&gt; * You have been unsubscribed from the list.
&gt; * You are mailing from an address that is different than the one
&gt;    subscribed to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;all not true in this case&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; maybe this:
&gt; 
&gt;    <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-digest@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa-digest@linuxsa.org.au</A>
&gt; 
&gt; is the real address to post?
