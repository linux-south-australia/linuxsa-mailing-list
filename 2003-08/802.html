&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; Well the boss had his computer stolen and he wants something quick.
&gt; I am  about ready to buy this:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.gearzoo.com/product_info.php?products_id">http://www.gearzoo.com/product_info.php?products_id</A>=32
&gt; 
&gt; but my main hesitation is that I don't know much about c3
&gt; processors.  I  am leaning towared that because it looks like it is
&gt; compatible with  Linux.  and I assume FreeBSD.
&gt; 
&gt; If that was a Pentium III or IV I would get it in a heartbeat.  I
&gt; am  just worried that this will be like a Celeron.  DOes anyone
&gt; know how a  v3 compares to a Pentium III 700 mhz? Is it better all
&gt; the way around,  
&gt;  or is it missing some cache?
&gt; 
&gt; I understand the temperature factor, I was able to actually listen
&gt; to  Dan Shearer's presenation on emulators from last years
&gt; linuxconf, in  which he talked about a guy that used liquid air to
&gt; cool his processor  down, speeding up his Pentium I to 1ghz.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank You!

I serviced a dead machine with one once, so I did a little research
on them. Plus I had an earlier chip from them and after that
experience, I won't touch them. I don't know if they're improved
since the Cyrix MII but those were awful - in floating point
operations, a Pentium 166 with 16MB could beat the MII-300 with 64MB
by miles. Via have since bought Cyrix. On the other hand, didn't Via
release that software CPU with the self-editing emulator? At first
boot it benchtested at roughly half the speed in Pentium, but after
an hour or so had rewritten the emulator to be only a MHz below the
same speed Pentium in performace. So, all up, I'd have to say do lots
of research.

This one classes it as "low end", so I'd be wary
<A HREF="http://www.digit-life.com/articles/viac31ghzlowend/">http://www.digit-life.com/articles/viac31ghzlowend/</A>

Tom's hardware says "At first glance, the C3 processor seems to be
nothing but a low-end competitor to Intel and AMD CPUs; how could a 1
GHz processor compete with a fast Pentium 4 at roughly half the clock
speed?"
But points out that the main advantage it has is that it runs so much
cooler - I seem to recall a fanless system being based on one, once.
Designed as an entertainment system. So, great for cheap, cool
running. Not so hot if you need serious grunt work
