It is likely to be a hardware problem (mouse or keyboard) or connection. 
You could also have a look at /etc/X11/XF86Config to see if it is 
corrupt.  X uses this file when it starts, not when the computer boots 
or if you work at the console, thus if it were incorrect or the hardware 
has a problem this is where it all falls over.

&gt; 
&gt; To stop this story getting too much longer than it already is I
&gt; will skip a few minor adventures.  Basically I worked out
&gt; that the keyboard also worked fine if I booted the Woody
&gt; installation using the Debian rescue CD and only used console
&gt; mode.  It worked fine in console mode, but when I brought
&gt; up X, mouse and keyboard would freeze.
Look at XF86Config.  Try without the mouse plugged in.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed that gdm is not installed under Woody, but I think it
&gt; was under the Progeny install.  I am guessing that there is something
&gt; wrong with either the mouse or with the onboard "mouse interaction
&gt; hardware".  I am also guessing that whatever is wrong is interfering
&gt; with the keyboard so that the keyboard only works when the mouse
&gt; is not being listened to.
&gt; 
&gt; Do people concur with my conclusions?  Any ideas about whether it
&gt; is the mouse or the motherboard circuitry?  I have access to another
&gt; Microsoft "intelligent" mouse, so I could plug that in, but is it
&gt; possible that this could damage the mouse (if the motherboard
&gt; circuitry is dodgy)? 
Don't know.
  Are there any other tests, suggestions,
&gt; fixes, etc people could suggest?

Conrad.
