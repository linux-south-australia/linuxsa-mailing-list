&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have a machine here with an Abit BP6 dual-processor motherboard and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a couple of Celerons.  I originally bought it three years ago to work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on the new FreeBSD SMP implementation, so it was literally the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; machine to run SMPng.  The problem is, it's not doing it very well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any more.  I can't even build a world without it hanging multiple times.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it the motherboard?  Is it FreeBSD?  That's what I'd like to know.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The best way to find out would be to get a second system with the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; same motherboard.  Does anybody out there have one they'd like to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sell or lend?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Curious to know the results, also have a BP6 that I have sadly come
&gt;&gt;&gt; the conclusion is dead.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; It locks up under xp and RH9, worse with dual cpu's
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; There was talk at one stage of power regulation problems with the
&gt;&gt;&gt; boards.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Yes, I've checked that on the old board, but didn't come up with anything.
&gt;&gt; Anyway, the new board works fine, so it really looks like it's the old
&gt;&gt; board, or possibly something set in the BIOS.  Before I throw it out I'll
&gt;&gt; try reflashing the BIOS and seeing if that makes any difference.  It
&gt;&gt; shouldn't, since this board used to work reliably.
&gt;
&gt; As I said before, it is most likely the EC10 capacitor 

My understanding was that the capacitors would then be bulging.  I
couldn't find anything like that on my board.

&gt; or one of or both the CPU VRM's.

I'm not sure which component you mean here.  The voltage regulator
chips?  Or something else?  I've measured the voltages, and they seem
fine.
