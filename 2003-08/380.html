Hmm...

I studied computer and information science for a year. I have since left to
pursue medicine and keep my computers as a hobby, so i don't get overworked
out of enjoying them - which is what i was afraid was happening. I did
Computer and Internet Technology (which was a repeat of year 12 Info tech
essentially), Technical Communication (i don't like to be pessemistic, but
what a waste of my time - i already know how to write a letter and a resume
several times over), Programming in Java, Java Programming Lab, User
Interfaces and Mathematics for Computing.

I loved learning Java (not because it was Java - Java really sucks in my
opinion) but because of the principles of it. And maths was my favorite
subject. I pretty much did every exercise in the text and every assignment
twice, as well as seeking out other books with practice work in them. The
principles are what counts in this case - to just judge the content on the
surface would be unfair, as that way, it appears pretty elementary and
pointless.

I found also that some procedures are not in line with what you should be
doing. If you are learning programming, you are learning it to program a
computer. Why then should you be required to handwrite the code for 10
situations in a test, without the assistance of a reference book (which you
would have reasonable access to in real life situations) or a compiler or
interpreter (which would pick out your mistakes before you pass in your
final code. No wonder half of the students failed Java, handwritten code
would have more bugs than the pile of dirty washing behind my door!

I love doing university study - I still have 10 years ahead of me including
postgraduate psychiatry and my specialisation in forensics, and i would
study for the rest of my life if i could. But in the case of computing, I am
still dubious as to whether it provides you with the best method of
education for a job. There must be better ways to ensure that the candidates
that you are after for a job have the skills and knowledge that you require.
Maybe holding a Cisco certification or similar (or equivalent). A practical
test before you are given or offered the position? A theoretical quiz? If
you were placed in whatever situation and something-or-other happened, how
would you deal about it? I could get this job had I finished that course.
But I wouldn't have the slightest clue how to use a router. I constantly am
looking up how to do stuff - learning how to do it myself under my own
steam. Uni didn't give me any skills in that area, and I ain't gonna do any
specific certifications at this point.

Anyhow, I've had a bad day, so I don't feel like spilling my mind out in
binary any more tonight. I'm gonna go and play GTA now.

&gt; &gt; One of my friends is doing a computer science degree which doesnt teach
you
&gt; &gt; anything about systems administration, they are obsessed with learning
how
&gt; &gt; to program with Java, and at some point in the last year, they were
still
&gt; &gt; learning about DOS and Windows 3.11.
&gt;
&gt; A computer science degree is about programming and the theory of how
&gt; things work.  Just like a chemistry degree is about the theory of how
&gt; atoms interact, not about how to be a lab assistant, even though you may
&gt; learn those skills along the way.
&gt;
&gt;   &gt; IT degrees are great to show you have the patience to sit and finish a
&gt; &gt; course, but in most cases you can just forget everything you learn the
&gt; &gt; moment you get a job, and then learn what your really need to know.
&gt;
&gt; That's so much bullshit it's not funny.  Although I'm not a programmer,
&gt; the things I learnt at uni about how computers, networks, etc all work
&gt; make me much much better at my job (Network Engineer - real networks
&gt; with routers and switches not windows crap) than people who haven't been
&gt; to uni.
&gt;
&gt; University gives you skills in thinking and reasoning.  It gives you a
&gt; deep understanding about how things work that practical experience
&gt; doesn't give you.  It teaches you things about why things have evolved
&gt; and what's happened before.
&gt;
&gt; Sure, some people learn better in ways other than uni.  You can also get
&gt; people who've been to uni who are pretty awful and who didn't really
&gt; take anything in.  But I'll tell you what, when I deal with people I can
&gt; tell the difference, even if they've got a degree in a completely
&gt; different area.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not advocating that Uni is the be all and end all of studying and
&gt; learning, but I get sick of people who can't keep it together to finish
&gt; a 3 year degree, who don't get to the end and have that "ah, that's why
&gt; I did it" momement bagging it.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't know why it's worth doing then you don't know what you're
&gt; missing.

&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've dropped it
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;for various reasons. If I am capable of self-learning and read books
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;at a uni library, play with linux, do some work for people, work
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;_with_ people more knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;as suitable for a job as someone who has a "Tertiary Qualification"?
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Michael,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;The whole purpose of qualifications of any kind is to save time and
effort
&gt; &gt;&gt;by employers. If they have 100 applications from people who claim
&gt; &gt;&gt;to have ability and skills which they can prove if given enough
&gt; &gt;&gt;time to demonstrate it, e.g. via references or a portfolio etc., then
&gt; &gt;&gt;that's much more demanding than just looking at the assessments done
&gt; &gt;&gt;by an educational institution.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;That's why educational institutions don't just teach - they also
_assess_,
&gt; &gt;&gt;as a kind of favour to employers. It's also a favour to other
educational
&gt; &gt;&gt;institutions which might require pre-requisities.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;But your argument is like saying that drivers' licences are unnecessary,
&gt; &gt;&gt;because you might have the right skills anyway. But the police really
&gt; &gt;&gt;don't have the time to give everyone a test if they suspect that their
&gt; &gt;&gt;driving skills aren't good enough.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;On the other hand, if the employer has heaps of spare time, and has
&gt; &gt;&gt;very few candidates, they could probably be persuaded to do an
assessment
&gt; &gt;&gt;of you themselves.
&gt; &gt;&gt;However, normally it's more efficient to be assessed once by an
&gt; &gt;&gt;educational institution rather than being assessed by every employer
&gt; &gt;&gt;you might apply to in your life.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Cheers,
&gt; &gt;&gt;Alan Kennington.
