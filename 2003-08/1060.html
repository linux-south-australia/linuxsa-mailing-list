Andrew,

It's funny you should mention that. I had a sudden huge increase in
spam attempts over the last 9 hours.
It started at 05:16 (UTC+0930) this morning - all from a single IP address:

cpe-24-24-251-175.socal.rr.com[24.24.251.175]

And they were all going to a single e-mail address which I created for
2 days and exposed on slashdot.org. Then I removed it.
Since then, I've received lots of intermittent spam attempts to this
non-existent e-mail address - which are all logged nicely by postfix.

I received 69 e-mails from this single IP address, all to the same
destination e-mail address, but all with different fake source e-mail
addresses. Then I got tired of watching this garbage and used the iptables.

But my point is that not a single other of my 40 e-mail aliases has been
affected. Only the one which I exposed for a couple of days about 2-3 years
ago. The spam attack is now continuing to this single slashdot-exposed
address at a very much reduced rate from IP source addresses like:

proxy.ojp.usdoj.gov[149.101.22.2]
lists.ojp.usdoj.gov[149.101.22.2]
vmf-ext.prodigy.net[207.115.63.92]
vmg-ext.prodigy.net[207.115.63.93]

It looks like someone has activated a massive spam blast from a bunch of
zombies around the world. That's my guess.
Strangely, none of my other exposed dozen or so e-mail aliases is getting hit.
So amybe someone, somewhere has a grudge against slashdot readers!!!?

Cheers,
ak.

PS. Here's a little gratuitous but true anecdote:
I once asked an esteemed colleague in Melbourne whether he preferred me to
send him short e-mail messages to save him time. He replied that:
"The best kind of e-mail is the e-mail which you don't send."
Typical ....... humour! (I've censored the ethnicity of the humour because
I don't want to get sued by sensitive people.)
If only the spammers would listen to this guy...
