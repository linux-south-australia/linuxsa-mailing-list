It IS based on Slackware but it's not really a pared down version as such.
It's just different. It's a whole new distro but you don't get the choice in
packages (it just installs everything by default). It's VERY similar to
Slackware in general, though. I'm using KDE 3.1 with it because it supports
that better than Gnome (it also comes with ICE and something else I can't
remember right now). It's super quick and I really like it but this is a
real issue.

Do you think it's the kernel problem? Thanks for the link too You saved me a
bit of searching; a small gesture but most appreciated by bone-idle peeps
like myself :-)

I'm just guessing it's the kernel source problem I intimated to. I hope I'm
right.

&gt; [rant mode]
&gt; why, oh why, do distros omit the kernel source from the default package 
&gt; install list? (redhat, mandrake, i'm talking to you.) there are so many 
&gt; times when it's needed; i've had 3 or 4 times personally where it's come 
&gt; up either at work or home that it hasn't been installed and people have 
&gt; been mystified as to why something wouldn't compile.

&gt; i'd say the kernel source, while it takes up a fair bit of space, 
&gt; *needs* to be installed by default.
&gt; [/rant]

I agree, mate. I've had endless problems with RH9 and Mdk9 in compiling
stuff without the source. I just assumed I could get around the NVIDIA
problem without it (after I realised Vector Linux didn't come with it) and
am curious if others have had the same problem. If it's the kernel problem,
I guess I'll have to install it. Simple as that! You'd think being a
Slackware distro it wouldn't do something as naughty as not install the
kernel sources. Mind you, you'd think it wouldn't ask you to state a root
password AFTER the install either but it did that......BAD, BAD Linux! :-)

&gt; Corey, what distro are you using? if it's redhat or mandrake (the only 
&gt; two i have any experience in, really), you should be able to run their 
&gt; respective package managers - under "main menu -&gt; configure -&gt; package 
&gt; management" in mandrake, or under "main menu -&gt; system settings -&gt; 
&gt; add/remove applications", i think, in redhat. *hopefully* the kernel 
&gt; source package will be listed in there; you can select it to be 
&gt; installed and it should prompt you for the correct CD.

  - Ben

Thanks Ben but as you realised I'm not running either of those. :-) I'm
thinking I'll need to tri-boot with RH, Vector and Micro$hizenHou$en Windows
until I get this sorted. Thanks again.

By the by, I've tried both RH8 and RH9 and have had more success with RH8
than 9. Which do all you guys prefer?

&gt; Hey guys.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking for a few tips to do with this little beggar. In short, I 
&gt; can't get my GeForce Ti4800 to load its 3D modules because as I go to 
&gt; install the NVIDIA-provided .run file, it keeps telling me I'm missing 
&gt; header files to be able to install it. I assume this means that it 
&gt; needs the kernel source. I haven't had much of a chance to have a play 
&gt; with this OS yet but if it's the missing kernel problem, I wonder why 
&gt; the kernel source didn't come with it. Anyone know?
&gt; 
&gt; So can anyone help me out here?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks people.
&gt; 
&gt; Corey.

If I remember correctly (and I have a poor memory), vector linux is a pared
down slackware. If what I have remembered is correct then you should be able
to get kernel source here (make sure its the right source though).

Please verify that the slackware/vector thing is correct before taking any
action though.
