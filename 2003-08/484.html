&gt; &gt; So the idea that "I created it" is preposterous. It shows the inherent

&gt; 
&gt; I don't think copyright protects the idea, rather the expression of the idea.
&gt; If I do come up with a truly new concept, and presuming I don't patent that
&gt; idea, then you are free to express it your own way.  You aren't automatically
&gt; free to copy my expression.

David,

It must surely be time for everybody to go back to work now, but anyway....

Your distinction between the idea and the expression of an idea is
difficult to make. When I implement ideas, I invent numerous new ideas.
Recently, being a mathematician originally, I added some rather more
sophisticated than necessary probabilistic inference to a published idea,
and now I think that my implementation should perform significantly better
than the usual way of doing things. So my "expression" of the idea is
more than just an expression - I've added new ideas. Only the dullest
of programmers would implement an idea without adding something new.
Invention is happening all the time. It's a fact of life. It's so sad that
the basic urge to invent (like so many other urges) is now subject to
attempts from numerous quarters to get control of it and monopolise it and
"propertize" it.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In my opinion, everyone should give away all of their software because it
&gt; &gt; is only a logical corollary of what went before and owes more debt to
&gt; &gt; the past than the future will owe to it.
&gt; 
&gt; That's a very interesting notion, with the corollary that an architect
&gt; should give away all of her designs, and perhaps a builder should build
&gt; it for nothing more than the cost of materials.  Unfortunately very few
&gt; builders or architects would be willing to work for free.  Likewise,
&gt; very few programmers are willing to work for free without having at least
&gt; some independant source of income.

It seems to me like your speculations about my opinions are false.
It's better if you ascribe your corollaries to yourself rather than to me.
I don't agree with your "corollaries". So they don't invalidate my statements
at all. 

To state it simply, the idea that one owes 99% of one's invention to what
went before does not forbid you from making a living. It just means that
you should not get too egotistical about "your" invention, because
it's not really yours. You may have a legal monopoly on something, but
that doesn't mean that you created it from a vacuum.

Cheers,
Alan.

PS.  For anyone interested in GUI programming, GTK+ is not that bad really,
when you work out how to subdue it. If you want the power of Perl/Tk or
Tcl/Tk, you have to build your own widgets out of multiple basic widgets.
But it's really very pleasurable indeed when you do get control over
these pesky GTK widgets. That's what I'm going back to now. So....
