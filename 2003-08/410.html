&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Aye, there's the rub.  If they're not telling you what the tainted
&gt;&gt; code is, how can you know if it "exists" in *BSD or not?
&gt;
&gt; Because it doesn't matter if there is tainted code (in the
&gt; SCO sense) in BSD.
&gt;
&gt; Remember that we've been down the "UNIX code in BSD" path
&gt; before.  And yes there was UNIX code, and it was removed.
&gt; But also, the judge scathingly noted there was BSD code
&gt; misappropiated into UNIX.  In the end there was a (sealed)
&gt; agreement to let those sleeping dogs lie.
&gt;
&gt; Poking that sleeping dog wouldn't be the brightest of
&gt; ideas.

Indeed.  But that agreement was about the state of BSD at the time of
the law suit.  SCO could now come and accuse the BSDs of
misappropriating UnixWare code after that.  It doesn't make any sense,
but then the Linux stuff doesn't make any sense except as dirty
corporate tactics.  I don't think SCO will have a go at BSD, though:
there's no big company behind it.  The more I look at this, the more I
think that they're not really targeting the end users.  They're
targeting IBM, and the FUD will have a negative effect on IBM.
