&gt;
&gt; It's a summary article of things we've heard of before, but it does
&gt; show what sort of consensus is developing in the IT media.
&gt; Most articles are now saying that SCO does have some sort of leg to stand on.
&gt; (They also mention a certain Greg Lehey.)
&gt;
&gt; Sample:
&gt; ======================================================
&gt; According to these analyses, it's a version of an ancient piece of code, dating
&gt; back to at least 1973, and published in a half dozen contexts and under just as
&gt; many licenses, some of them Open Source. So far so good for the Linux
&gt; community; unfortunately the DNA fingerprinting implies that it is a descendent
&gt; of the version in SCO's proprietary System V Unix, a version that on the face
&gt; of it can't be used for Open Source projects.

Unless it has been specifically released.  We'd have to ask SGI about that.

&gt; Another sticky point is that the Copyright ownership is listed in
&gt; the file in question as being SGI's, yet it's pretty clear that the
&gt; Copyright belongs to SCO:

No, that's not clear.  We haven't seen anything about the contracts
between SCO and its predecessors on one side and SGI on the other.

&gt; Regardless of what Open Source license SCO licensed its code under,
&gt; you can't normally delete someones Copyright notice and substitute
&gt; your own.

You can if you're authorized to do so.  Currently the FreeBSD project
is doing something similar: we're trying to modernize all the old
four-part BSD licenses to remove the advertising clause.  We can do it
as long as the copyright holders agree, which most of them do.

Note, however, that this is exactly what SCO appear to have done with
the BPF code.
