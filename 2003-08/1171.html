Hi There,


Andy Johnstone &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Andy.Johnstone@parliament.sa.gov.au">Andy.Johnstone@parliament.sa.gov.au</A>&gt; has sent this update
about the status of the SA Open Source Bill...

- --------------------------------------------------------
Good Afternoon everyone.

Firstly my apologies if this is the first communication you receive from us
on this topic.

Naturally there are many people who are interested in open source who use
email as their primary form of communication.  Their messages of support and
suggestions are coming in to us through a number of different email
addresses and I'm having some trouble keeping up to date on replies.

The purpose of this message is to let you all know what is happening with
the open source Bill.

Parliament was prorogued and all Bills have been taken off the notice paper.
This means that we need to re-submit the Democrat open source bill for
consideration.

As the session came to a close at the end of July, it became clear that
neither Labour nor Coalition MPs would support the Bill.  The anti open
source rhetoric had been accepted by many, and political parties are quite
jealous of each other, requiring exceptional circumstances to achieve
bi-partisan support for initiatives.

However, all is not doom and gloom.  Firstly, we have succeeded beyond our
wildest dreams in elevating the status of open source debate in Australia.
Secondly, as explained earlier, we are here for the long haul.  The Bill was
only the first step.

Many people have contacted us about favouring open standards rather than
open source.  This is a little fraught with danger because of the ability of
some of the major players to "embrace and extend|completely destroy"
standards as part of their on going campaign to be all things software.  Not
to mention their current forays into the realms of XML...

However, Mr Gilfillan is now considering the possibility of amending the
Bill so that it has a series of fall back positions that include rigorous
application of open standards, open and clearly documented data formats and
multiple vendors being available to support and modify the software. 

This would (hopefully) have the effect of bring on board those that support
open standards more than open source, and also deflect some of the
criticisms that the Bill is too restrictive.

Please note that we have little control over the "spin" put on the Bill by
third parties, and the most common criticism levelled by lobbyists is that:

1. The Bill mandates the use of open source 
2. The Bill is anti American
3. The Bill breaches free trade policy
4. The Bill reduces choice

None of these things are true, but it is proving to be difficult to get the
explanations out to the wider world.

Now would be a very good time for you to be providing information and
suggestions about supporting open data formats and open standards etc. Pros
and cons, and I will pass out a proposed amended version of the legislation
for discussion once we have one.

Thanks again for your support.

Andy.
