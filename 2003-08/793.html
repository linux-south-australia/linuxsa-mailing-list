&gt; Well thanks to all the help 
&gt; I managed to get online and networked.
&gt; I actually had managed (in a half baked fashion) to get most of it sorted
&gt; out but needed confirmation and some minor pointers to get it up and
&gt; running on boot.
&gt; 
&gt; I do have a question regarding add-on modules.
&gt; I managed to install the module into /lib/modules/..../kernel/drivers/net/
&gt; and loaded and on reboot it magically worked. 
&gt; How does the mechanism work to identify the location of the module to load
&gt; at boot.

First off, a look at how modprobe & depmod works.
Quoting directly from 'man depmod':
"Depmod creates a "Makefile"-like dependency file, based on the symbols
it finds in the  set  of  modules mentioned  on the command line or from
the directories specified in the configuration file (modules.conf). 
This dependency file is later used by modprobe to automatically load the
correct module or stack of modules."

By default, depmod scans /lib/modules/`uname -r`/* for .o files & caches
them in the dependency file /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.dep

&gt; Is there an implicit assumption for nics to look in /drivers/net ?

No. My guess is that Redhat looks in this directory & either modprobes
everything in there, or modprobes the first NIC driver it sees, or
sequentially tries modprobing & testing different NIC drivers until it
finds one that works.
This is the default directory the kernel uses to install it's network
driver modules.
You could equally have copied the 3c2000.o module into
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/, ran 'depmod -a' & you still would have been
able to 'modprobe 3c2000'. Whether or not RH would have found &
modprobed it in this location is another matter.

&gt; I would have thought the modules.conf would allow for path to a module to
&gt; be specified

I'm not that familiar with modules.conf, as I see it as an unecessary
(optional) voodoo ;)
However, I'm familiar enough to know that modules.conf does indeed allow
for path to a module to be specified.
/etc/modules.conf can also be used for modprobing your module with extra
parameters.
Check out 'modinfo 3c2000' for a list of extra parameters & other info.

&gt; ps Rick: I am running Rh9.0 and sys specs are p4 2.4c-&gt; 3.2ghz /ddr-400/wd
&gt; 120gb 8mb
&gt; PPS as this is a HT enabled CPU I get 2 options for boot non SMP and SMP
&gt; versions of the kernel which is interesting I wasn't aware the kernels
&gt; recognised the HT at all.


/me drools
I want that box :p

Regards,
Rick
