&gt; That was my point precisely.

&gt; latest problems.


I don't actually agree.  Well, sort of.


I choose to be a little dependant on my distribution supplier, but so that
it eases my work-load - it allows me to focus on what I want.  But am I
really dependant?  I have the source, I can always do it my way when, and
if, I choose it.

Sometimes I do deviate.  And that depends upon when the scales tip in
favour of that happening.  I've deviated in that I'm using apt4rpm for
package management instead of up2date.  But I'm still using Red Hat for
key system component updates.  I have the power to choose at what level I
deviate, and when I want to change that level, and so in one sense I am
dependant, and in other ways I'm not.

I'm often not "twiddling my thumbs" waiting for fixes.  If Red Hat hasn't
patched XYZ (simple), someone else has (little harder), and if they
haven't, I can do it myself (most work).  How is that dependant?  I call
that time saving.

&gt; Of course, your distro vendor might be nice to you.
&gt; But then you become _dependent_.
&gt; Dependency is only painful when you try to break free.


Not really.  My home directory is shared amongst different Linux
distributions on different machines (but not used simultaneously :-)

I can switch and swap.  Where is the cost in moving?


&gt; Linux was supposed to set us free, and yet we're being rounded up and
&gt; fenced in by the big distros bit by bit.


Linux is a summer project for a 19 year old Finnish university student :-)


Perhaps the "fencing in" is why Debian is as popular as ever.  We have the
source, we can break-away, we're not locked in.

I think it's interesting that Red Hat has opened up their low-end product
completely now - it now follows an open-source development strategy.  I
think other commercial distros may do the same to keep community people
involved, while allowing them to charge for their high-end product to
business (and provide support etc).

&gt; We are like innocent sheep grazing in the open meadows not noticing that
&gt; fence which is gradually being built around us on all sides.
&gt; A really good distribution would set you free to not have to get anything
&gt; from them ever again. You should be able to get by from the time of
&gt; purchase onwards by merely downloading the latest source for everything.


topologyLinux here we come :-)


As I've said, both Debian and very recently Red Hat, are both totally free
software with open development models.  Slackware similarly I believe. 
Lots of small distros too.

We're not getting fenced in, but the landscape is changing.  We just move
to greener pastures - remember in our world there are no Gates to fence us
in :-)
