Hi all,

I have a problem. Once upon a time, I had both yellowgoanna.com and
yellowgoanna.com.au, but I dropped the .com.au because it was pointless.
However, certain people keep sending mail to <A HREF="mailto:richard@yellowgoanna.com.au">richard@yellowgoanna.com.au</A>,
and for some reason, they don't get a bounce back. Now it is my
understanding that this is the fault of their mailserver, so there's nothing
I can do about it... or is there? Does anyone know anything I can do about
it?

I've been doing some investigation, and have confirmed that none of the NS's
that ever served this domain serve it any longer. The old primary MX rejects
mail for this domain, but the old secondary MX is still accepting mail...
I've just asked the admin of the secondary MX to stop accepting mail, but I
don't understand how anyone would be finding that MX in the first place. It
also functioned as the old NS once upon a time, but I wouldn't think that
any SMTP servers would try sending to an NS, would they? I have also
discovered that running a dig for the NS records still returns results,
which I am surprised at. I'm pretty sure (though not 100%) that my ownership
of that domain has expired. Certainly, a whois on that domain returns
nothing.

I hope this somewhat garbled stream-of-consciousness message makes sense :)
