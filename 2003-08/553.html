Greg,

Right... Of course I agree with the objectives. I'd define proper
formatting of mails as the old fortran standard - basically 72 chars
to a line, max.

With Netscape copy/paste into "vi" in mutt, you used to get up to
30 or 40 SP character indentation on the left of every line, which
is a royal pain to fix up in "vi". (You use 0 ctrl-D in insert-mode.)
Mozilla copies on the 1 LF/para principle which is favoured by 
office worker's workstation software. I guess it's one of these "extensions"
to ASCII due to the fact that ASCII does not have a paragraph control char.
So CR-LF or LF is redefined to mean "paragraph end", and there's nothing
left to represent a line break. We used to call that "breaking the standard"
in the olden days.

Recently I noticed that the "one word line-wrap" problem (where an indent
with "&gt; " causes 80-char lines to split into two lines) was not happening
in Mark Newton's responses using Mutt/1.2.5.1i. Somehow his editor
seems to recognize paragraphs, narrow them, and then indent them, even when
the original has line-splits.
It would be interesting to know which editor does that.

Since Mozilla seems to go along with the standard-breaking
one LF/para "extension", and since the majority of MS mailers generate
such stuff, it's difficult to resist the trend.

Has anyone found a low-effort way of doing a Mozilla to CLI-based mailer
copy-paste without generating 1 LF/para?

Cheers,
ak.

PS. You're using Mutt/1.4i, I see. Mine is Mutt/1.3.12i.
