&gt; The posting of the day would have to be Peren's updated analysis of

&gt; I know Greg disagrees with Bruce about the source of the code.

Minor differences.  esr has also joined the fray.

The truth is that it's almost impossible to be sure.  But I get the
feeling that both Bruce and esr are trying to maintain a
whiter-than-white image for Linux.  That's not going to pay in the
long time: if they're proven wrong, it will come home to bite them.

&gt; My view is that it is impossible to tell.

It is possible, but not based on the currently available evidence
alone.

&gt; If you start with the BSD code there is only one place for the lock
&gt; to be obtained.

The BSD code is clearly irrelevant.

&gt; Without some statement from the author, it's reasonable to assume
&gt; that both System V and Linux started with the Ancient/BSD code and
&gt; placed the lock in the same obvious position.

No, I disagree on this one.  But I can't prove it.

&gt; Having been bitten by the clean-room Linux reimplementation of the
&gt; Berkeley Packet Filter, I'm surprised that SCO hold that up as
&gt; copied code.

I have difficulty believing that that code was reimplemented without
any reference to the original.  In any case, the original code has a
BSD copyright, so there's no reason not to use it.

&gt; Yeah the case statement implementing the virtual machine looks the
&gt; same, but it's really the obvious way to implement the instruction
&gt; set.

Same variables?  Same style?  Now if he had used the same grammar,
that might be a different matter.

Anyway, that's not the interesting thing.  SCO don't have any
copyright on BPF (they can't even claim derivative works), so it's not
an issue.  What's *much* more interesting is that they didn't see the
big BSD copyright at the beginning of the file (see
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html</A>#BPF).  The only
explanation I can find is that they removed it.  And that, of course,
is a license violation.
