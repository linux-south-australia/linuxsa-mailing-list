Well thanks to all the help 
I managed to get online and networked.
I actually had managed (in a half baked fashion) to get most of it sorted
out but needed confirmation and some minor pointers to get it up and
running on boot.

I do have a question regarding add-on modules.
I managed to install the module into /lib/modules/..../kernel/drivers/net/
and loaded and on reboot it magically worked. 
How does the mechanism work to identify the location of the module to load
at boot.
Is there an implicit assumption for nics to look in /drivers/net ?
I would have thought the modules.conf would allow for path to a module to
be specified

I'd appreciate this as it will give me a better understanding of it.

thanks
Evan

ps Rick: I am running Rh9.0 and sys specs are p4 2.4c-&gt; 3.2ghz /ddr-400/wd
120gb 8mb
PPS as this is a HT enabled CPU I get 2 options for boot non SMP and SMP
versions of the kernel which is interesting I wasn't aware the kernels
recognised the HT at all.

&gt;Hi Evan,

&gt;&gt; Hi List,
&gt;&gt; I have recently upgraded my system by installing a new ABIT IS7 (p4)
&gt;&gt; motherboard. The board is good and has on board gigabit lan (even
&gt;&gt; though
&gt;&gt; the specs say otherwise)
&gt;&gt; So far I have managed to track down a module for the LAN from ASUS
&gt;&gt; (of all places) (which runs the same 3com onboard chip) The module
&gt;&gt; appears
&gt;&gt; to work as I compiled it and fired up eth0 and I could ping my other
&gt;&gt; machines.
&gt;
&gt;Great !
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The problem is I have tried running insmod 3c2000.o and it placed it
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; /proc/modules I pinged but I cant do much else - the gateway and other
&gt;&gt; things are not setup (normally done from the DHCP server but seeing I
&gt;&gt; manually ifconfig up I hardcoded the ip address ). I have never faced
&gt;&gt; this
&gt;&gt; (installing a custom module) before as most of my hardware was always
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; generation behind and always autodetected.
&gt;
&gt;To get dhcp up, bring eth0 down with 'ifconfig eth0 down'
&gt;then try 'dhcpcd eth0'.
&gt;This should auto-get the IP address & gateway info from the dhcp server.
&gt;Check it with 'ifconfig' & 'route'
&gt;
&gt;If dhcp is giving problems, less /var/log/messages & /var/log/syslog on
&gt;the dhcp server to check for any errors. If your dhcpd.conf on the
&gt;server is using MAC addresses to identify hosts on the network, then it
&gt;will need to be changed to include the MAC address (HWaddr: in ifconfig)
&gt;of your new NIC.
&gt;
&gt;If it does get the IP address, but not the gateway, you can manually set
&gt;it up like so:
&gt;'route del default'
&gt;'routed add default gw &lt;ip-address_of_gateway&gt;'
&gt;
&gt;If all is well & you can now ping remote IP's through the gateway, then
&gt;it's time to make it automatically set your network up on boot. How this
&gt;is done depends largely on what linux distribution you're using. If it's
&gt;either Slackware or Gentoo, I can help, otherwise I wouldn't have a clue
&gt;:)
&gt;
&gt;But to make this transition easier you want to be able to modprobe the
&gt;3c2000.o module.
&gt;
&gt;'cp 3c2000.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/'
&gt;then run 'depmod -a'
&gt;You should now be able to 'modprobe 3c2000'
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I may have another question regarding with ac97 sound
&gt;
&gt;If memory serves, ac97 is a type of audio codec used by many different
&gt;manufacturers of soundcards. So, if it's your soundcard your looking to
&gt;setup here you'll need to provide the brand.
&gt;'lspci | grep audio' should do the trick.
&gt;
&gt;Hope at least some of this helps. Nice specs on the new box btw ;-)
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Rick
