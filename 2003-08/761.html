&gt; I think you'll find that David's advocating to fight against 
&gt; unlawful/unjust laws while still behaving within the law. 

I can see that. I disagree. So do many others. Ghandi, Rosa Parks...

&gt; Otherwise you are just as bad as those who make unjust laws 
&gt; ie you break them.

That presupposes that laws are "good". How about we say that those who wish
to control me against my will (ie lawmakers) are just as bad as those who
break just laws? It's all the same, really. The only reason why lawmakers
have any control is because they have bigger weapons than the rest of us.
There is nothing else that gives them legitimacy (as we have seen recently
in Iraq).

&gt; 
&gt; Once laws are made we need to behave within them otherwise we 
&gt; are branded law breakers and the point we were trying to make 
&gt; is lost. The detainees at Baxter have had their case tainted 
&gt; by those who make mischief.

One could just as easily say that if you don't resist against unjust laws by
flouting them as you see fit, you have already lost, as you are already
under the control of the unjust. Even here, our right to protest is being
removed. Does that make protesting wrong? What it means is that we can only
protest against things they will allow us to protest against. What sort of
protest is that?

But this is a big political debate, and probably not relevant to this
list...
