&gt; Alex,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Debian is much easier to upgrade. The APT packaging tool (which I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; giving a talk on this Wednesday evening, 7 PM at Microbits for the SA
&gt; &gt; &gt; chapter of AUUG)...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is a somewhat biased view, as Mandrake has urpmi and redhat has
&gt; &gt; up2date, both of which do much the same thing as apt does with simple
&gt; &gt; command line tools for  installing/upgrading software.
&gt; 
&gt; True, however I maintain that the package base for Mandrake and RedHat isn't
&gt; as large as the Debian package base. That is to say that there simple isn't
&gt; 12000 RPM packages, packaged by RedHat and vetted by RedHat to install.

No arguments there! Debian has around 11,000 apps to choose from last
time I checked, whereas even with apt bolted on top of Redhat they only
have around 1,800.

&gt; 
&gt; And the RPM format itself isn't as rich in informatin as the DEB format.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Redhat can even use apt-get as well, so I dont think the above statement
&gt; &gt; is entirely valid.
&gt; 
&gt; However, unless you use Conectiva you have to bolt APT on top of RedHat or
&gt; Mandrake.

It's not as painful or difficult a process as you make out. One of the
first things I do on any Redhat install is install apt for Redhat. And
the bonus is you can have a nice point & click gui with synaptic to
browse the available package trees. At least with that you dont get
overwhelmed with the plethora of apps to choose from.
