&gt;  But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've dropped it

&gt; _with_ people more knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just

Michael,

The whole purpose of qualifications of any kind is to save time and effort
by employers. If they have 100 applications from people who claim
to have ability and skills which they can prove if given enough
time to demonstrate it, e.g. via references or a portfolio etc., then
that's much more demanding than just looking at the assessments done
by an educational institution.

That's why educational institutions don't just teach - they also _assess_,
as a kind of favour to employers. It's also a favour to other educational
institutions which might require pre-requisities.

But your argument is like saying that drivers' licences are unnecessary,
because you might have the right skills anyway. But the police really
don't have the time to give everyone a test if they suspect that their
driving skills aren't good enough. 

On the other hand, if the employer has heaps of spare time, and has
very few candidates, they could probably be persuaded to do an assessment
of you themselves.
However, normally it's more efficient to be assessed once by an
educational institution rather than being assessed by every employer
you might apply to in your life.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
