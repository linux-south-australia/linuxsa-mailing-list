One of my friends is doing a computer science degree which doesnt teach you
anything about systems administration, they are obsessed with learning how
to program with Java, and at some point in the last year, they were still
learning about DOS and Windows 3.11.

IT degrees are great to show you have the patience to sit and finish a
course, but in most cases you can just forget everything you learn the
moment you get a job, and then learn what your really need to know.

&gt; &gt; I'm curious, why do people place this in IT job advertisements?

&gt; [....]
&gt; &gt;  But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've dropped it
&gt; &gt; for various reasons. If I am capable of self-learning and read books
&gt; &gt; at a uni library, play with linux, do some work for people, work
&gt; &gt; _with_ people more knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just
&gt; &gt; as suitable for a job as someone who has a "Tertiary Qualification"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Michael,
&gt;
&gt; The whole purpose of qualifications of any kind is to save time and effort
&gt; by employers. If they have 100 applications from people who claim
&gt; to have ability and skills which they can prove if given enough
&gt; time to demonstrate it, e.g. via references or a portfolio etc., then
&gt; that's much more demanding than just looking at the assessments done
&gt; by an educational institution.
&gt;
&gt; That's why educational institutions don't just teach - they also _assess_,
&gt; as a kind of favour to employers. It's also a favour to other educational
&gt; institutions which might require pre-requisities.
&gt;
&gt; But your argument is like saying that drivers' licences are unnecessary,
&gt; because you might have the right skills anyway. But the police really
&gt; don't have the time to give everyone a test if they suspect that their
&gt; driving skills aren't good enough.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, if the employer has heaps of spare time, and has
&gt; very few candidates, they could probably be persuaded to do an assessment
&gt; of you themselves.
&gt; However, normally it's more efficient to be assessed once by an
&gt; educational institution rather than being assessed by every employer
&gt; you might apply to in your life.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
