Luke, 

Appreciate the response from you and equally from the others that have
posted responses.  

It is 5.5, and it does run alongside AD.  This means that I'll be
starting from scratch and the actual transition will be a big manual
copy job, I've already accepted that :(.  Luckily there are only about
15-20 mailboxes to worry about, so it's not a major issue.

My main concern is in finding a Linux based alternative to Exchange
server which will still run with Outlook clients - this is an essential
requirement.  There are a number of solutions out there which work on a
synchronisation basis (ie Outlook runs from local files which
synchronize with a server on a regular basis), but these are unsuitable.
Then there are some solutions which have some sort of plugin to Outlook
which gives it (claimed) full Outlook/Exchange functionality with a
Linux server (Bynari is a good example of this type of system).  Better
still is a system which actually implements the MAPI protocal which is
what Outlook uses to communicate with Exchange (Samsung Contact does it
this way, but is almost as expensive to license as Exchange).

I don't mind paying for it, since we already pay for MS crazy licensing
fees, but what I am trying to achieve is a more reliable, more scalable
system which doesn't require restarting every 2 weeks and does not break
everytime the licensing limit is approached among other problems
(strange that we have 20% more licenses than are required, but Windows
still occasionally complains that there are not enough licenses... Hrm).
Lower cost will be a bonus.

Your input is valued and appreciated.

Cheers,
Brad.

Hey Brad,

What version of exchange are you running? If it's version 5.5 or below,
I 
think you will find that the transition will be easy. Unfortunately,
later 
versions of Exchange, generally implement only with Active Directory
(for 
full functionality).

Now, if you have Active Directory installed, then I think the transition

will be a hard one, and you'll probably have to start from scratch
anyway, 
because the Exchnage server schema will be a part-of/addition to the
Active 
Directory schema.

Obviously, if you have gone down the linux path, this may not apply.

Luke
