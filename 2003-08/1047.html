<H1>[OT] Dial-out accounts at ISPs</H1>

Hi all,

Many people, myself included, now use something other than a modem for
Internet connectivity. Many people, me included, dislike modems, and would
rather avoid them if we could. However, some people, me included, have the
need to occasionally dial in to a client's system to do something. This
could be because they only have a modem, or it could be for out-of-band
access to a console of some sort of device. 

Given that non-winmodems are hard to find, and that this need could be very
rare (or perhaps that occasionally, you may need to dial in to two places at
once), is it possible to get dial-out access to some modems somewhere?
Perhaps some now-unused modems at an ISP, maybe attached to a terminal
server like an Annex... This would mean that there could be a shell account,
highly restricted, of course, on some device, where you could ssh in, then
interface with one of a few modems, and make the call you need, without
needing to maintain a phone line or modem of your own. I would be prepared
to pay $5 or so per call I made, especially given that I would do so
extremely rarely. Anyone got any comments, ideas, problems, free advice,
grammatical corrections or email formatting issues with that? I am aware
that one would need to trust the entity running the terminal server and
modems, but am willing to do so...
