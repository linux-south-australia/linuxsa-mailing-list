&gt; Nup, it's FAT32. Sorry for not mentioning that. As I said, I had a 10min

&gt; 
&gt; Groovy little OS, though. Those of us old enough to remember DOS disks on
&gt; XT's without HDD's would know that running an OS off removeable media is
&gt; nothing new but to have a fully-featured version like this just run without
&gt; buggering around at all is awesome.

i second that. (me too!)

this week i had cause to investigate a large-ish drive (60G) on an older 
machine - where the BIOS would not detect this drive without limiting it 
to 32G. (mmmmm, half size? yes please!)

i vaguely remembered reading someone's message on here saying that they 
had bypassed the bios totally (i.e. set that IDE location to There Is No 
Drive Here, Honest) and linux Just Read The Drive with no problems 
(seemingly "bypassing" the bios). so i unplugged the other drives, 
chucked knoppix in the CDrom, set the bios to ignore the big drive and 
booted knoppix...and mounted the drive, in all its 57G 
1000-bytes-not-1024-bytes glory, with zero hassles. repartitioned & 
formatted it, turned the machine off, put the big drive in an already 
running machine of the same specs, and robert was my father's brother, 
so to speak.

hooray for knoppix and zero-install linux goodness! saved me lots of 
time and hassle.

as for the actual problem at hand - i re-partitioned this drive and 
formatted it as FAT32 under knoppix, and there were no problems mounting 
and reading & writing to the drive, so i can verify that knoppix can 
indeed talk to FAT32 partitions OK.

i did this from the console tho (not X), maybe that might have something 
to do with it (if the console runs as root, but X doesn't)? my knowledge 
of knoppix is far from encyclopaedic.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;One thing; I didn't get much of a chance to play with it but I noticed 
&gt;&gt;that I couldn't write to my Windoze partition. Is that just a straight 
&gt;&gt;chmod or does Knoppix actually prevent you from writing to a non 
&gt;&gt;ext2/ext3 partition?
&gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Is it NTFS? You cannot write to this. Linux will only read it. Others may
&gt; know more detail.
