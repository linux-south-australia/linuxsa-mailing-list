&gt; &gt; Eric has written a very clear and firm letter.
&gt; 
&gt; A very subtle letter ;-)
&gt; Complete with its own level of threat for future consequences.

&gt; I would love to have been a fly on the wall of the SCO boardroom when
&gt; they discussed this one.


Ian,

It might be a little early for triumphalism. I think that IBM will be
panicking about loose cannons and such -- shooting from the hip, etc.
It's also covered here:

Eric Raymond gets very mad at SCO
<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article">http://www.theinquirer.net/?article</A>=11168

If I had someone talking like that at my side, I'd move out of the
firing line a little. Linus has spoken a little too loosely too.
They should follow IBM's example and "speak quietly and carry a big stick".
IBM have a very big heap of lawyers and experience, and they are not shouting.
If SCO win, they will not forgive permature triumphalism. 

The Inquirer (UK) also has this:

How to muzzle SCO
<A HREF="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article">http://www.theinquirer.net/?article</A>=11175

Unfortunately this is another bit of amateur legal advice which doesn't
really suggest anything with any definiteness. The whole point is not
to muzzle SCO but to get them to spill as many beans as possible.

Personally, I think the whole affair is going very nicely. Linux has never had
so much good publicity as this.

Cheers,
ak.

PS. I though this was interesting:

SCO could face uphill battle in drawing new customers

============================================
"I have no intentions of ever doing business with SCO," said Chad Wilson, a
computer support analyst at an Ohio-based hospital that runs Windows-equipped
servers and dabbles in Linux and IBM AIX. Wilson said SCO's recent actions in
its $3 billion lawsuit against IBM over its Unix intellectual property turned
him off when SCO began threatening Linux users with legal action if they don't
pay new $699-per-CPU licensing fees to SCO (see story). "Basically, with their
tactics, they hurt their chance of getting a future customer," Wilson said.
