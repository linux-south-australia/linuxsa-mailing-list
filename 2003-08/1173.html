&gt; IBM Corp. has been quietly stage-managing the open source community's response
&gt; to The SCO Group Inc.'s $3 billion lawsuit over Big Blue's contributions to the
&gt; Linux source code, SCO's Chief Executive Officer Darl McBride said in an
&gt; interview at his company's SCO Forum user conference in Las Vegas this week

Yeah right.  Let's play "put yourself in their shoes".  You're
Red Hat.  You're pissed off enough to call your lawyers.  You're
going to want your lawyers to call IBM's lawyers and ensure they
don't trip each other up.  That's hardly IBM pulling Red Hat's
strings.

McBride must be on something if he thinks that Richard Stallman
is going to let himself or the FSF be organised by anyone, let
alone IBM.  Fuck, it's hard enough organising for that man to
wear shoes.

Perhaps someone needs to tell McBride that sometimes when "it
looks like the whole world is coming against SCO", they actually
are.

And the world doesn't need IBM to organise that.  You need look
no further than your local LinuxSA mailing list for proof -- like
we're ringing IBM's lawyers before posting :-)
