&gt; I found also that some procedures are not in line with what 
&gt; you should be doing. If you are learning programming, you are 
&gt; learning it to program a computer. Why then should you be 
&gt; required to handwrite the code for 10 situations in a test, 
&gt; without the assistance of a reference book (which you would 
&gt; have reasonable access to in real life situations) or a 
&gt; compiler or interpreter (which would pick out your mistakes 
&gt; before you pass in your final code. No wonder half of the 
&gt; students failed Java, handwritten code would have more bugs 
&gt; than the pile of dirty washing behind my door!

Quite likely true. My experience at Adelaide Uni confirms this -- the
teaching and assessment is shoddy compared even with Maths, and especially
with my sister's experinece with Medicine at the same Uni.

&gt; 
&gt; I love doing university study - I still have 10 years ahead 
&gt; of me including postgraduate psychiatry and my specialisation 
&gt; in forensics, and i would study for the rest of my life if i 
&gt; could. But in the case of computing, I am still dubious as to 
&gt; whether it provides you with the best method of education for 
&gt; a job. There must be better ways to ensure that the 

The problem here is that University still isn't sure if it's educating
people, or training them for a job, and this is especially the case in
Computing. No-one argues that the current style of teaching is ideal. They
are under-funded, under-resourced, and resultantly disorganised. However,
the goal, sadly enough, increasingly seems to be grooming people for jobs,
rather than educating them. That is sad.

&gt; candidates that you are after for a job have the skills and 
&gt; knowledge that you require. Maybe holding a Cisco 
&gt; certification or similar (or equivalent). A practical test 
&gt; before you are given or offered the position? A theoretical 
&gt; quiz? If you were placed in whatever situation and 
&gt; something-or-other happened, how would you deal about it? I 

These all require effort. Certainly at present, there are many candidates
and few positions, and you don't want to go through this with 50 candidates.

&gt; could get this job had I finished that course. But I wouldn't 
&gt; have the slightest clue how to use a router. I constantly am 
&gt; looking up how to do stuff - learning how to do it myself 
&gt; under my own steam. Uni didn't give me any skills in that 
&gt; area, and I ain't gonna do any specific certifications at this point.

Uni is supposed to be about educating you so you are capable of
self-training. Once upon a time, people learnt in Pascal or Ada, which are
of little use to anyone, and that was the point. You learn to program, and
then you transfer those skills to whatever language you end up using, as
appropriate. These days, the industry wants graduates to be job-ready, and
know Java, have a Cisco certification and so on, none of which have anything
to do with education, and hence, should not be part of a University degree.
Historically, that was what TAFE was about -- the practical, technical
things. You come out of TAFE ready to work. You come out of Uni ready to
learn. Unfortunately, various pressures have conspired to draw University
and TAFE into the same space. This is not to say TAFE is inferior, by the
way, it's just different. Or it was. Now, it's not. It's almost the same,
but better at it.

&gt; &gt; A computer science degree is about programming and the 
&gt; theory of how 
&gt; &gt; things work.  Just like a chemistry degree is about the 
&gt; theory of how 
&gt; &gt; atoms interact, not about how to be a lab assistant, even 
&gt; though you 
&gt; &gt; may learn those skills along the way.

This is the point that appears to be missed. The unfortunate thing is that
people and industry are now demanding that a Computer Science degree should
be about getting certifications and learning buzz-word language X, and the
universities are being forced into doing it by our wonderfully long-sighted
government (yay!).

Personally, I think we should take another step forward, and seeing as
Universities are becoming similar to TAFEs and TAFEs similar to
Universities, and both are focussed on training, I think we should create a
new type of education that is actual education, and specifically not
training. Or perhaps we should attempt to distinguish between degrees that
are training degrees, and degrees that are education degrees. Maybe we
already are -- the BSc and BA are actual education, and the rest are
increasingly training for a career, with some education thrown in for good
measure.
