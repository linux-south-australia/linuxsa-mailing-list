Hi All,
    After having this argument with my ISP on numerous occasions (Telstra -
don't ask), I am repeatedly told that they are a content provider, and that
some people actually WANT this stuff. I am in the process of locating
another ISP as I am really getting jack of this. Other ISPs WILL block this
stuff at the border, I even have it in writing from a couple, but Telstra -
No.

    The other reason Telstra won't block it is because they charge by data,
and so every time this happens, they make a packet. I am still getting
bombarded with Code Red attempts on my Linux firewall server. I have asked
Telstra to block it, but again - No. My apache logs have numerous entries in
the error logs of other hack attempts, but will Telstra Block it - No. I am
seriously considering sending a bill to Telstra for the data I have been
charged for that I have repeatedly asked them to block. It is in the
Gigabytes range now. At the very least I think I will be making a collection
of all this stuff and sending it to the Telecommunications Ombudsman.
Telstra are one of the most expensive ISPs around, and I expect much better
service than I am paying a premium for.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; &gt; Just had a look on the firewall:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="mailto:root@ipcop">root@ipcop</A>:/var/log/snort # grep CyberKit alert|wc
&gt; &gt;   12314  221652 1945538
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's just this week.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there any reason why ISP's don't just block traffic of known worm
&gt; &gt; activity like this at their border routers? I know it's a MS user's
&gt; &gt; problem, but it seems a bit pointless to carry it at times of high worm
&gt; &gt; activity.
&gt;
&gt; ISPs probably don't want to step into a legal minefield.  If they block
this
&gt; traffic then politicians might get ideas that it's also easy to block
&gt; porn/nasty websites.  Additionally users might rely on the ISP taking
action
&gt; and thus not protecting their PCs.  The next time the ISP doesn't do that
&gt; users may be inclined to sue.  Civil libetarians might be upset as well
(ISP
&gt; actively monitoring packets).
&gt;
&gt; None of the above are terribly good reason to not block, but an ISP
probably
&gt; has better things to worry about.
