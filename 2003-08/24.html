Brian,

Maybe not. The Internet has effectively given every individual on Earth
(plus or minus 3 dB) an instant printing press and distribution network,
and a world broadcast radio and TV station. This makes possible a 
democracy of thought which was first recognizable (by me anyway) in the
city-states of ancient Greece, where the states were so small that
every citizen could get to a meeting in the city for a day and get home
that night. Hence they had parliaments of many thousands and their
juries for trials were in the hundreds (typically a jury of 501).
In that environment developed the first true alphabet (including both
consonants and _also_ vowels!!) and the invention of most forms of
literature and science for the next 2000 years.

Maybe the Internet has turned the whole world into a "city state".
In this sense, I think that the Internet is special, and trying to
generalise the process outside the net will have only limited success.
It's the idea of a "flat hierarchy" which is special to the net.
The merest mug can exchange mails with the open source superstars.
Perhaps the idea of "flat social structures" could be applied outside
the Internet. But in a world where "charismatic leadership" is praised
and highly rewarded, companies and organisations are going to be unlikely
to apply the Open Source philosophy of flat social hierarchies to
many real problems. Imagine a company or organisation with no boss
and no organisational tree. It would take too much courage to do it.
The Internet and Open Source imply democracy and power-sharing.
That's why governments hate them.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Getting back to the concrete, I still think that distributions
should be assessed on the update test: Can you download the latest
version of any package from source and get it configured and working
with acceptable effort? It used to be true for RedHat and SuSE.
But it seems to get steadily more difficult. Recently I downloaded
some application software or API (I forget which), and found that
the locations used by the distro in the ./configure set-up were so
wierd that I couldn't follow them. So I ended up putting everything
in /usr/local and fiddling with the environment variables to avoid
getting the distro's versions of everything. This shouldn't be necessary.
