You sure, mate? I would have thought that on an enterprise basis, you'd have
to re-emburse guys like RH. Bear in mind I haven't checked the site on this
one (don't have internet at work) so I could definitely be wrong.

Hi Corey,

&gt; Let's hope their new trade in coffee can boost their economy a bit. A 
&gt; donation or loan from somewhere would probably help.
&gt; 
&gt; Linux, whilst freely distributed to, for and by individuals, isn't 
&gt; free for corporations, right? That would mean there'd be licensing 
&gt; fees associated with RH or whatever. Wouldn't they have to pay 
&gt; something no matter which way they go? Mind you, the licensing of 
&gt; Linux would certainly cost a hell of a lot less than 
&gt; Windows..............

It's free, Corey. For anyone. You can pay RH if you want, but you don't have
to,

Michael

&gt; 
&gt; The question is then, how much can they afford to pay? Maybe some 
&gt; obscure decommissioned OS and hardware would do the job for them. I'd 
&gt; be happy to donate my Amiga 2000. I mean it's functional, has 
&gt; games/apps and a modem. I'd miss it terribly but hey, for a higher 
&gt; cause....... :-) Mind you, that's hardly a long-term solution.
