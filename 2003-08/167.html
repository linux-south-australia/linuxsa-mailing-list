Hi all

What a ridiculous ?discussion about Open Office.

If I left a message asking a question about something as unquallified as the
messages about OO I'd get told where to go or RTFM.

Open Office 1.0.3 is slow no buts about it. On my Celeron 1.7GHz laptop with
256MB Ram and RH 9 it takes roughly 15 - 30 secs to start. I don't know about
any preloader available for Linux. I think this is a reasonably spec'd computer
and I'd like Open Office to start faster. This is a problem because some people
/ customers question its abilities because of its slowness.

On Computerbank computers that are around 200MHz with 64MB ram Open Office is a
real drag.

I've quallified my statements with hardware specs, software versions etc.

Open Office may be good enough for some users and I use it most of the time. But
it's clearly not suitable for everyone.

We don't need to take swipes at others. Don't take it so personally that someone
disagrees with you. Question their statements not the person. 

I seem to be saying this a lot.
