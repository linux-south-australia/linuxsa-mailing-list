Hi all,  I have a comment or two about this I'd like to share in a non-inflamatory way...

Dan may have a point, or he may not.  It doesn't really matter.

The point I'd like to make is that there's at least one "customer" of Computerbank that is very disgruntled.  It's fine for you to disagree with his comments, but you should examine them to see if you can do what you do better.  He *might* have valid concerns about customer service.  Or he may not.  You should consider both possibilities.  Responding with legal threats when public criticism is made is something not even Microsoft do :)

I support Computerbank (with my junk :-) but even volunteer-run organisations need to listen to their customers, even if claims made are not based in fact (and I'm not saying whether Dan's were or weren't).

Just my 2 cents,

Michael...

   &gt;  I haven't been at my computer since late last week otherwise I'd have
   &gt;  commented sooner.
   &gt;  
   &gt;  On a public mailing list you question the integrity of the SA Branch of
   &gt;  Computerbank Australia INC. That's an Incorporated body. I'd shut up
   &gt;  while you're ahead.
   &gt;  
   &gt;  I just might get us/Computerbank some legal advice as to how to deal
   &gt;  with public comments like yours.
   &gt;  
   &gt;  I'm quoting in full here because of a dubious comments in the sig of
   &gt;  Dan's email.
