This is a recurrent problem I've had for years now:

1.	I open a text window such an xterm or some other console window.
	It doesn't seem to depend on which brand of window it is.

2.	I run "tail -f logfile" in the window. This includes various
	system error message files, web log files, procmail log files
	and so forth.

3.	From time to time, I hit the return key a couple of times
	to make a visual gap in the text so that I can see what I have
	already read and what is new.

4.	After a few days, all keyboard input to the window ceases to
	have any effect. The output from "tail" continues completely
	as normal. But even if I hit control-C, control-Z etc., or
	even ~. in ssh etc., there's absolutely no response.
	So I have to just clsoe the X window and start again.

Does anyone happen to know what could make this happen or how to fix it?
My first thought was that the "tail" program was experiencing some sort
of buffer blockage on standard input. But that is almost certainly not 
the problem. Signals from the keyboard would surely clear that.

This has happened on various linux distributions over many years. But I think
it's all within KDE since I don't use anything else.

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
