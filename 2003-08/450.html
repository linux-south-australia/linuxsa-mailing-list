Colin,

That sounds like a good argument - short and simple, so it must be right.
But if I actually read what you've written, it all seems wrong.
[The following essayette is not attacking you personally, by the way.
I'm attacking the idea that individuals can own software or ideas.] 

The problem here is that everyone gets their ideas from everyone else.
We all live in a sea of ideas and benefit from them. There are very, very,
very, very few _new_ ideas which are _created_. We all just add one more
grain of sand to the Nullarbor Plains of human intellectual life.
We only _discover_ ideas which are there waiting to be discovered.
All of our ideas are minor variations and re-mixes of ideas that have gone
before. If you pick up a grain of sand and throw it onto a heap, then it
is "your" grain of sand that you "created" - not.
Almost all inventions are simultaneously discovered by many people. This is
because the ideas are just "in the air", ready to be discovered by the
natural process of inquiry and effort. If you don't invent an idea today,
someone else will invent it tomorrow or next week.

So the idea that "I created it" is preposterous. It shows the inherent
competitive individualism in the system. The idea that people can own ideas
is fostered by lawyers who make money out of defending property rights.

In my opinion, everyone should give away all of their software because it
is only a logical corollary of what went before and owes more debt to
the past than the future will owe to it.
The GPL, and the intellectual "property" fantasy in general, perpetuates
the notion that people are independent individuals who create ideas out of
nothing.

Although you espouse the GPL, you nevertheless cling very tightly to the
notion that software is individual property which you can control
under your conditions.
In my opinion, this means that you haven't come to terms with the
concept of the public domain.

An alternative point of view is to say:
Thousands of other people have laboured to build the tools so that I can
whip up a program or module or script. Therefore I am morally _obliged_
to give back in return as a sign of gratitude. 
I see open/free licensing as a moral obligation, not as a weapon to 
destroy commercial software or force others to give me back something.
As in the philosophy in the Artistic Licence, the idea is to be generous,
with only the criterion that derived works should not harm the original
artist's reputation. As I understand it, BSD is even more generous than that.
If some poor person living on US$1/day modifies my code and earns a living 
from it, there will be no one more happy than me if they do.
That's not because I will have given them gift; it will be because
they have taken what's theirs already; and they will not have harmed me.
But I'm not going to put a means test on my software....

The real test of the GPL is:  Are there more generous options?
Not:  How can I stop other developers from gaining financially from my effort?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
