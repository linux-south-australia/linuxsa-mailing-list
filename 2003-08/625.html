Nick,

That's truly magic. Not even ludwig has that. I would have to write a
little command script to do that. I'm going to use that on all my mails
from now on.

After trying ludwig editor for a couple of days, I've decided to go back
to vi for mail editing because:

1.  Changing editor in some context is really disorienting. I keep using
    vi commands in the ludwig editor, and that keeps losing my work,
    which is sooo frustrating. Even though I use ludwig for all my
    software development, my mind converts to "old vi" for e-mail.
    It's difficult to undo many years of habit.

2.  Ludwig doesn't have those fancy "gqap" commands. I just used that
    feature and it's really so nice. Since 1985, I've just been using
    the vi commands which were in the first 2 pages of the user manual
    at that time. I had no idea "vi" had got so good in the interim.
    (At that time, "vi" and "ed" weren't that much different.)
    The O'Reilly vi book (6th edition) does cover "gqap". But they
    have 126 pages devoted to "vi clones", including "nvi", "elvis",
    "vim" and "vile". Can I assume that 99% of linux and BSD machines
    are configured with "vi" to default to "vim"?

3.  "vi" is on every machine on the planet (which is worth logging in to).
    So learning up on vi is a good investment. Standards are worth having,
    even if they are sometimes frustratingly stodgy.

By the way, I had an "interesting" experience a while back when trying
to remove all superfluous software packages from a linux PC. I saw this
"vim" package which said that it was some modern-fangled, new improved
version of "vi". I thought: "I don't need no modern-fangled, new
improved vi kludgeware." So I deleted it. All of a sudden, I lost
control over the machine because there was no old classical vi any
more. It seems that all "vi" on linux distros now is really "vim". I
think I got out of the problem I was in by using "cat" or "ed" and an
editor. I don't remember it clearly. But it reminded me that you should
never, ever delete "vi"!

Back to the grindstone...

Cheers,
Alan.
