&gt; One of my friends is doing a computer science degree which doesnt teach you
&gt; anything about systems administration, they are obsessed with learning how
&gt; to program with Java, and at some point in the last year, they were still
&gt; learning about DOS and Windows 3.11.

A computer science degree is about programming and the theory of how 
things work.  Just like a chemistry degree is about the theory of how 
atoms interact, not about how to be a lab assistant, even though you may 
learn those skills along the way.

  &gt; IT degrees are great to show you have the patience to sit and finish a
&gt; course, but in most cases you can just forget everything you learn the
&gt; moment you get a job, and then learn what your really need to know.

That's so much bullshit it's not funny.  Although I'm not a programmer, 
the things I learnt at uni about how computers, networks, etc all work 
make me much much better at my job (Network Engineer - real networks 
with routers and switches not windows crap) than people who haven't been 
to uni.

University gives you skills in thinking and reasoning.  It gives you a 
deep understanding about how things work that practical experience 
doesn't give you.  It teaches you things about why things have evolved 
and what's happened before.

Sure, some people learn better in ways other than uni.  You can also get 
people who've been to uni who are pretty awful and who didn't really 
take anything in.  But I'll tell you what, when I deal with people I can 
tell the difference, even if they've got a degree in a completely 
different area.

I'm not advocating that Uni is the be all and end all of studying and 
learning, but I get sick of people who can't keep it together to finish 
a 3 year degree, who don't get to the end and have that "ah, that's why 
I did it" momement bagging it.

If you don't know why it's worth doing then you don't know what you're 
missing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've dropped it
&gt;&gt;&gt;for various reasons. If I am capable of self-learning and read books
&gt;&gt;&gt;at a uni library, play with linux, do some work for people, work
&gt;&gt;&gt;_with_ people more knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just
&gt;&gt;&gt;as suitable for a job as someone who has a "Tertiary Qualification"?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Michael,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The whole purpose of qualifications of any kind is to save time and effort
&gt;&gt;by employers. If they have 100 applications from people who claim
&gt;&gt;to have ability and skills which they can prove if given enough
&gt;&gt;time to demonstrate it, e.g. via references or a portfolio etc., then
&gt;&gt;that's much more demanding than just looking at the assessments done
&gt;&gt;by an educational institution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;That's why educational institutions don't just teach - they also _assess_,
&gt;&gt;as a kind of favour to employers. It's also a favour to other educational
&gt;&gt;institutions which might require pre-requisities.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;But your argument is like saying that drivers' licences are unnecessary,
&gt;&gt;because you might have the right skills anyway. But the police really
&gt;&gt;don't have the time to give everyone a test if they suspect that their
&gt;&gt;driving skills aren't good enough.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;On the other hand, if the employer has heaps of spare time, and has
&gt;&gt;very few candidates, they could probably be persuaded to do an assessment
&gt;&gt;of you themselves.
&gt;&gt;However, normally it's more efficient to be assessed once by an
&gt;&gt;educational institution rather than being assessed by every employer
&gt;&gt;you might apply to in your life.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Cheers,
&gt;&gt;Alan Kennington.
