Funny, I thought if it wasn't for MS I would be supporting Mac OSX and 
OS/2 desktops ;-)

Funny post, but seriously I actually make money (could be more though) 
working with Linux now and have for 4-5 years.

You are right about the choice thing. A support company has to argue 
over exim vs postfix, perl vs php, python vs ruby, mysql vs postgresql , 
vi vs emacs internally. That breadth of choice is what makes developing 
with OSS so healthy. Once we have picked the tool for the job, it isn't 
something the customer needs to be aware of. I am sure people at 
microsoft have wars over edit vs notepad as well.

Good clients see the benefits, not the implementation.

Apart from IBM, who are by all reports making squillions out of Linux, 
there must be other people doing real work with Linux who deserve to be 
recognised.

It is healthy that we can take the piss out of ourselves and laugh at vi 
vs emacs religious wars but I do have a serious point.

There really isn't anyone I can see raising the profile of IT workers or 
IT companies in this state who choose to work with Open Source. Its a 
worry when your only political support is the Democrats ;-) Something 
like Open Source Victoria is probably needed.

&gt; Paul,  As many people have observed, if it weren't for MS, most IT support
&gt; people would be out of a job. Would you rather hack linux code on the dole or
&gt; support MS users on a full wage? (That's a difficult one, I know...)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway....
