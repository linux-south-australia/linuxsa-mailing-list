There are two types of cable.  "Patch" cable is used for, well, patchleads.
It's very flexible because the wires in the cable are stranded.

The other kind is used for internal building work, is less flexible, and
has solid-core conductors.  That makes it nice and strong, so you can 
pull it through ducts, gaps between walls, etc without causing internal
fractures.  When you bend it it wants to stay bent too.

If you ask a vendor for patch cable you'll end up with the stuff that
isn't usually used for internal building work.

This may not seem like a problem on the surface, but it is:  the two types
of cable have two types of connector.  Most wallplates and patchpanels have
Krone terminations on them which expect solid-core cable.  And most 
crimp-on RJ45 plugs are intended to go on the end of patchleads, and they
therefore expect stranded cable.  You might end up with dodgy terminations
if you mix the cable and connector types.

So for building work specify that you want a 100m roll of solid-core CAT5E
cable.

 &gt; Anyway, does anyone know where to get some cheap CAT5 in Adelaide? JayCar
 &gt; has it for 75c/m, but i've heard you can get good quality cable for 40c/m.

Try Page Data.

     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
