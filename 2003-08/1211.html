Hmmm...

&gt;Govt launches net crackdown
&gt;
&gt;The Australian
&gt;AUGUST 20, 2003
&gt;
&gt;The federal Government plans to outlaw using the internet for
&gt;"offensive and menacing purposes," proposing new laws that could
&gt;mean two years in prison for activities like organising or
&gt;advocating violent protests through the internet.
&gt;A joint statement from Communications Minister Senator Richard
&gt;Alston and Justice Minister Chris Ellison said the new laws were
&gt;part of a crackdown on e-crime.
&gt;"People using the internet to advocate or facilitate violent
&gt;protests, for example by spreading information on methods of
&gt;violently disrupting international meetings and attacking police
&gt;officers protecting such gatherings, including those using the
&gt;internet to harass or menace others are amongst those who could be
&gt;prosecuted under the new offences," the statement says.
&gt;Other targets would include those using the internet to encourage
&gt;criminal acts.
&gt;The new laws are part of a package of legislation that will tackle
&gt;other offences including child pornography and the rebirthing of
&gt;mobile phones. The legislation will also introduce "criminal
&gt;penalties for placing material on the internet that would be
&gt;regarded by reasonable persons as being, in all the circumstances,
&gt;offensive". However, the new laws will include specific exemptions
&gt;for internet service providers and content hosts "where they do not
&gt;have knowledge of the content of the material that they transmit or
&gt;host". Under current laws, it is an offence to use a
&gt;telecommunications service "in a way that would be considered by a
&gt;reasonable person as offensive, or with the result that another
&gt;person is menaced or harassed". The proposed legislation would
&gt;extend the provisions to cover the internet, which is not covered
&gt;under existing legislation."The new offence will carry a penalty of
&gt;two years imprisonment, double the punishment for an existing
&gt;offence," the statement says.
