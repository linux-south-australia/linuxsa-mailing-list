Greg,

&gt; 2.  Called up the ACCC and referred to my previous complaint.  I got
&gt;     on to the same bloke (Nick), who remembered a
&gt;     surprising number of details.  He tells me:
&gt;
&gt;     - Their lawyers are investigating the case, including the FUD
&gt;       aspects, but they haven't come up with anything final yet.
&gt;     - As a result, the ACCC can't (yet) say whether any demand for
&gt;       payment should be paid or not.
&gt;     - On the other hand, they're *very* interested in hearing from
&gt;       anybody who gets any communication from SCO on the subject,
&gt;       particularly demands for payment.
&gt;     - They'd also like to hear from people who have paid
&gt;       money to SCO voluntarily.

When I read the way they intended to issue the licences last
as a Linux user, you were to get a licence for SCO "unixsomethingware"
which covered the code/IP *alleged* used in the Linux kernel.

however, as i understood it, if you have the linux source and binary,
a vender cannont make you purchase another product under the
anti-bundling
laws in Australia. it was confusingly worded that SCO could force you
to buy something you did not want if you did not use the code/IP
*allegedly*
in use. ie the code for support for multi CPUs (4+ CPUs)...

since there are an extremely small number of 4+ CPU boxes in use in
AU,
i would suggest then there would be no reason to use the code ...
for the sheer majority of users and if you didn't ...
WTF is SCO trying to inflict[1] us with this damn licence?

Ok, so the anti-bundling laws may not be explicitly relevent,
was just a thought. but the anti bundling laws have undone a
couple of other cases like this before.
