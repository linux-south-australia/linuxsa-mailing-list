&gt;&gt; I have a machine here with an Abit BP6 dual-processor motherboard and
&gt;&gt; a couple of Celerons.  I originally bought it three years ago to work
&gt;&gt; on the new FreeBSD SMP implementation, so it was literally the first
&gt;&gt; machine to run SMPng.  The problem is, it's not doing it very well any
&gt;&gt; more.  I can't even build a world without it hanging multiple times.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Is it the motherboard?  Is it FreeBSD?  That's what I'd like to know.
&gt;&gt; The best way to find out would be to get a second system with the same
&gt;&gt; motherboard.  Does anybody out there have one they'd like to sell or
&gt;&gt; lend?
&gt;
&gt; Curious to know the results, also have a BP6 that I have sadly come
&gt; the conclusion is dead.
&gt;
&gt; It locks up under xp and RH9, worse with dual cpu's
&gt;
&gt; There was talk at one stage of power regulation problems with the
&gt; boards.

Yes, I've checked that on the old board, but didn't come up with
anything.  Anyway, the new board works fine, so it really looks like
it's the old board, or possibly something set in the BIOS.  Before I
throw it out I'll try reflashing the BIOS and seeing if that makes any
difference.  It shouldn't, since this board used to work reliably.
