Alan,


&gt; What kind of a manager would be happy to walk into the office and find
&gt; all the workers arguing about [long list of things]...

I should say that most managers wouldn't. Simply because we like to discuss
those things doesn't mean everyone needs to. 

You follow this up with:

&gt; If I were a manager, I'd give them all VT-100s and make them use csh and
&gt; vi. Or I'd make them use Macs.  Remember that deciding _what_ to do is
&gt; much more stressful than actually doing it.

This is one solution - it's possibly not the solution a "manager" might
like. They might decide that a single, standardised desktop with the
requisite tools to do whatever their employees need to get done is *the
way*.

&gt; Choice is the last thing that business people will want.

You see, this is part of what all business networks are about. They're about
offering choice to managers without looking like you're offering a choice...

[does that make sense?]

&gt; If you want businesses to convert, you have to take away the element of
&gt; choice!

To a certain extent, yes. To get businesses to conver you need to present
them with a solution that fits their individual businesses. For example, at
Microbits we have a fairly standard Linux desktop but everyone's desktop in
R & D is slightly different.

I actually use these differences to work out what other people might want,
then package it up and provide a single, unified desktop.

&gt; Paul,  As many people have observed, if it weren't for MS, most IT support
&gt; people would be out of a job. Would you rather hack linux code on the dole
&gt; or support MS users on a full wage? (That's a difficult one, I know...)

Look, that's a silly argument. I am going to deliberately argue ad absurdum
here:

"If Linux were the predominant desktop OS, every current IT non-savvy person
[read most of the general populace] would suddenly find their computers easy
to use. Not only that, all their printers would just magically work and
nothing would go wrong. Hardware would never blow up and power failures will
be announced BEFORE HAND so that no data will be lost when the machines go
down unexpectedly. Finally, God will not perform any of his acts and even
when he does, the friendly users will be able to salvage their own system."

Yeah.

Right.

Dream on.

Users using Linux WILL still need to be supported. Let's get out of this
rather silly "All Linux users know everything" mentality...

;-)
