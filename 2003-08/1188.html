 &gt; You might be opening a pandora's box here. What kind of a manager would

 &gt; tcsh, perl versus python, sendmail versus postfix, reiserfs versus ext3,
 &gt; SuSE versus Redhat versus Debian versus Knoppix versus Gentoo etc.,
 &gt; GPL versus BSD licence, FreeBSD versus Open BSD, linus versus BSD, etc. etc.
 &gt; That's alright for us young turks. But managers don't like young turks. 

Don't be silly, Alan.  Any manager worth their weight in dirt shouldn't
give a shit about any of that.  The manager should be able to define 
a goal and direct staff to achieve the goal in the most efficient 
way possible (for some definition of "efficient").  Ideally the manager
would then get out of the freakin' way until the job is done or until
further input is required to get the job past a roadblock.

(of course, that depends on the skills of the staff to a large degree --
if staff are going to spend all day arguing about KDE vs Gnome to the
extent that it has a material impact on their ability to do their job,
that's a different matter.  But let's assume some element of professionalism
in the staff before we start talking about professionalism in management,
ok?)
 
 &gt; If I were a manager, I'd give them all VT-100s and make them use csh
 &gt; and vi.

... and then, if you were my manager, I'd resign.  That kind of attitude
smacks of the pointy-haired management seen in dilbert cartoons, and
really shouldn't be encouraged.

 &gt; Or I'd make them use Macs.  Remember that deciding _what_ to do is much
 &gt; more stressful than actually doing it.

Yes, but don't specify _how_ to achieve _what_ you want to do.  

If you've hired skilled staff who are capable of making those sorts of
decisions, you'll demean them and waste them if you preempt their 
decisionmaking and ignore their contributions.  If you railroad your
skilled staff they'll all leave, and you'll be stuck with the 
staff who don't have enough knowledge and skill to know what they want,
and therefore -need- your dictatorial input.

In other words, the only people you'll have left are the ones who don't
have the skills needed to do the job.

 &gt; Choice is the last thing that business people will want.

A manager's job is to deliver a result while insulate directors from 
the method used to obtain the result.

The result itself doesn't need to be a matter of choice.  The
implementational details, on the other hand, almost always *NEED* to 
be a matter of choice.  

In all of my career nobody has ever offered me a One True Solution on
a platter, all ready for thought-free implementation.  Making choices
is part of the IT business, and if you think management can run roughshod
over that then I can only assume that you need to spend a bit more time
in the real world.

 &gt; In scientific and engineering workplaces which I've had the acquaintance of,
 &gt; the management have generally looked around and seen a plethora of
 &gt; Macs, Suns, PCs etc., and have asked "what machine can we all use?".
 &gt; The result has been the common denominator that the accountants can
 &gt; cope with, which is the PC with MS software. And the PhDs have ended up with
 &gt; the same machine on their desk - for compatibility.

... and I bet they've all been resolutely crappy places to work.  I mean,
yeesh!  The company employs PhD's on the basis of their knowledge and
skills, then leaves all the decision-making to the freakin' ACCOUNTANTS. 
What a waste.

I've worked at those kinds of places too.  Never again.  

 &gt; Paul,  As many people have observed, if it weren't for MS, most IT support
 &gt; people would be out of a job.

Are you on drugs?

Are you seriously claiming that IT support didn't exist before Microsoft
sprang into existance in the mid-80's?

I wonder what IBM had been doing since the 60's?  Building typewriters,
I suppose...
