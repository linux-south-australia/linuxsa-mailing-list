Unfortunately, they sometimes fail without bulging, which is a pain.
If you haven't got a tan-delta meter the only reliable 'test' is to
substitute a known-good capacitor. I recommend a low-ESR type as used
in switched mode power supplies.
----------------------------------------------------
Just as an aside...
 Sadly, often enough, bad capacitors measure bad while looking good.
 On the assumption that you don't have a "tan-delta capacitor loss
meter"
 nor the equivalent "ESR & Low Ohm meter" kit (K7204) from Dick Smith,
 (   author's home page is at                            )
 (   <A HREF="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~bobpar/esrmeter.htm">http://members.ozemail.com.au/~bobpar/esrmeter.htm</A>  )
 perhaps you only have market rumours and some consumer information,
to guide you.

 In September/October 2002, the Passive Component Industry Magazine,
 had an article (which caused a stir), titled,
 "Low-ESR Aluminum Electrolytic Failures Linked to Taiwanese Raw
Material Problems"
 A web search for the title, shows a lot of sites still discussing it.
 ( www.low-esr.com used to be one)

 The article, and commentaries, will give some clues as to
 - which companies(ibm etc) have claimed such and such a brand have
harmed them,
 - which companies have protested innocence, highest qualities etc
etc.
 - Rumours about staff movements etc, etc.
 If this is all false, or all true, as a potential purchaser of a
capacitor,
 it might help you if the brands and model numbers, are more than
merely generic.
