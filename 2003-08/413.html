&gt; 
&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I am doing some CGI developing as part of my Uni course and I wanted to
&gt; do some work on my Toshiba Laptop. I have a very nice new RH9.0 install
&gt; going with Apache 2.0.42 (I think - 2. something anyhow) up and running.
&gt; 
&gt;     My question is about getting Apache to serve web pages and scripts from
&gt; my home directory. I could just change to Apache config file to just point
&gt; DocumentRoot to the home directories since it is a single user installation,
&gt; but I am not happy with that solution as it would break normal operation of
&gt; serving pages from the normal directory, and I eventually want to use my new
&gt; found knowledge on my home server and so I want to know how can I get Apache
&gt; to serve pages in the normal way AND from a home directory.
&gt; 
&gt;     At present, I have turned off the security feature that normally
&gt; prevents Apache serving home directories and I have set up the appropriate
&gt; public_html directory in my home directory. When I try to get a directory
&gt; listing through my browser of this directory, using <A HREF="http://mymachine/~user/,">http://mymachine/~user/,</A>
&gt; I get an error about not having permissions for this directory, but the
&gt; Apache error log says the error is trying to connect to a non-existing
&gt; directory, i.e. DocumentRoot - /var/www/html/~user. How do I fix this?
&gt; 
&gt;     Can I have multiple DocumentRoot paths running concurrently? If I added
&gt; DocumentRoot /home/ then this would probably fix the problem, but wouldn't
&gt; this cause a confliction or override the initial DocumentRoot setting? If I
&gt; was setting up multiple web sites from the same machine then I would set
&gt; DocumentRoot up specifically in the VirtualHosts part of the config, but
&gt; surely I shouldn't have to do that?
&gt; 
&gt;     Anyhow, what I want is to set Apache up so I can serve the normal web
&gt; pages (if any) from <A HREF="http://www.mymachine">http://www.mymachine</A> AND <A HREF="http://mymachine/~user/">http://mymachine/~user/</A> . Any
&gt; help would be most appreciated.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
&gt; 

That could get confusing if you changed one set of DocumentRoot's and
not another. The solution is to use symlinks and have FollowSymLinks set
(on by default afaik in rh9) in your httpd.conf so that they all point
back to the same DocumentRoot tree. The permissions thing with the
/~user means you should do chmod 711 /home ; chmod 711 /home/user ;
chmod 755 /home/user/public_html


Hope this helps.

Alex
