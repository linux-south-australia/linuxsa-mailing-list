&gt; No, but you might be able to track it down.  Try running 
&gt; 
&gt;   stty &lt; /dev/pts/3 -a
&gt; 
&gt; (assuming the window in question is /dev/pts/3) from another xterm

Greg,

Many thanks for that. Unfortunately I just killed the current window giving me
the problems. But the problem happens about once a day on some machine (since I
have many dozens of such windows on multiple workstations).

The problem nearly always occurs when doing an "ssh" from a workstation
to a server. There are two "pts" objects involved.
So which of the ttys should I monitor? Presumably both, I suppose.

It's a mystery to me as to the exact data path for my keyboard input.
Is it something like this:

kbd -&gt; serial (or PS/2) driver
    -&gt; TTY layer kernel module
    -&gt; X software
    -&gt; X application (such as xterm)
    -&gt; local shell (e.g. /bin/tcsh)
    -&gt; local ssh process
    -&gt; remote sshd process
    -&gt; remote TTY layer
    -&gt; remote user shell (e.g. /bin/tcsh)
    -&gt; "tail" program

Anything involving a TTY "thing" (whatever it is) is a black art to me.
In one example I'm looking at now, I see this in "w" on the workstation:

akenning pts/20   -                11:31am 16:22   0.29s  0.15s  ssh xyz

This is the process which I just restarted after clobbering the blocked process.

On the server, I see this:

akenning pts/9    xyz.domain.net   11:31am 28:27   0.44s  0.00s  tail -f ...

Doing "stty -a" on these gives the usual info. I'll store that and wait
for the problem to resurface.

&gt; You can also try killing the process with an appropriate signal:
