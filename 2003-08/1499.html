David,

&gt; &gt; If you do this deal, what are the problems getting it to work under Redhat
&gt; &gt; 9, if any?
&gt; 
&gt; Absolutely none. Because the modem is an ADSL/ROUTER it can do all the NAT
&gt; and Firewalling for you. You can also make it a "MODEM only" device and do
&gt; all the authentication, pppoe and stuff yourself.

the ADSL modem that Adam Internet have in that deal doesnt get such great
reviews;

is this problem fixed now days?

&gt; &gt; How long do you have to wait for it to be activated (including having
&gt; &gt; your normal phone working)?
&gt; 
&gt; That depends on Telstra. I expected to wait for two weeks but it connected
&gt; in two days.

why does all connectivity *problems* always boil down to Telstra?
 
&gt; &gt; Are there any hidden costs, such as extra h/w (ethernet cards etc.)?
&gt;
&gt; Not really - you do need a credit card though. The modem is both a USB and
&gt; Ethernet modem. If you're on dialup it could actually _save_ you money -
&gt; it's the main reason why I got ADSL.

=) thats why Im looking at it too...
 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone connected through adam ADSL with Redhat 9 and the below
&gt; &gt; suggested h/w (Billion) and plan, and what, if any, were the *perceived*
&gt; &gt; improvements in speed.
&gt; 
&gt; I use Debian, but because I've left the modem in router mode even Windows 2K
&gt; works out of the box. Scary.

Id put the "modem" in "router" mode and only do port forwarding and NAT.
do the rest with a real firewall. NAT and firewalling don't mix.
 
&gt; &gt; I'd like to know more (obviously gotta move to *DSL someday),
&gt; 
&gt; I can tell you a lot about that star

A is for asyncronous, is it not? which has been described by some as 
"some up, less down =(" =)

cheers,

Kim
