FWIW, it seems that no-one is prepared or able to offer this kind of service
cheaply. I had a few people mention that they could allow me to host a
server in their server rooms, with outgoing modems on it, but that really
defeats the purpose of what I want -- which is to be able to use modems
without having to pay for phone lines or bother with buying modems or
setting them up or anything. To be able to use them from an ssh session
anywhere, and to be able to pay purely on a per-call basis...

I guess not many people want a service like that (which is understandable,
as it's an odd kind of request), but that's ok... it was mostly just me
playing with ideas rather than expressing a definite need...

Cheers

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Many people, myself included, now use something other than a 
&gt; modem for Internet connectivity. Many people, me included, 
&gt; dislike modems, and would rather avoid them if we could. 
&gt; However, some people, me included, have the need to 
&gt; occasionally dial in to a client's system to do something. 
&gt; This could be because they only have a modem, or it could be 
&gt; for out-of-band access to a console of some sort of device. 
&gt; 
&gt; Given that non-winmodems are hard to find, and that this need 
&gt; could be very rare (or perhaps that occasionally, you may 
&gt; need to dial in to two places at once), is it possible to get 
&gt; dial-out access to some modems somewhere? Perhaps some 
&gt; now-unused modems at an ISP, maybe attached to a terminal 
&gt; server like an Annex... This would mean that there could be a 
&gt; shell account, highly restricted, of course, on some device, 
&gt; where you could ssh in, then interface with one of a few 
&gt; modems, and make the call you need, without needing to 
&gt; maintain a phone line or modem of your own. I would be 
&gt; prepared to pay $5 or so per call I made, especially given 
&gt; that I would do so extremely rarely. Anyone got any comments, 
&gt; ideas, problems, free advice, grammatical corrections or 
&gt; email formatting issues with that? I am aware that one would 
&gt; need to trust the entity running the terminal server and 
&gt; modems, but am willing to do so...
