Hi Geoff,

I'm not sure if this is the right solution but...

Back in the days when I used Slackware Linux, I used a backup
facility called "tbackup".  It was a fantastic backup program.
It used afio as the main engine, but added its own stuff like
error correcting codes.  From its own description: "It has 
incremental backups, backup indexes,selective restore, error 
correcting codes, and more."

It was primarily designed for backup onto floppy disk, which
I suspect is not quite what you wish to do.  But I seem to
remember it was able to backup onto anything really.

Anyway, I used it for a while and found it to be pretty good.
I stopped using it when I moved to Debian because there isn't
a Debian package for it, but I plan to use it again soon 
because I haven't come across anything better since.

You can find it at:

The description for Tbackup is below.

Cheers,

Mark.

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt; I've had plenty of help regarding my 2Gb file limit on MDK 9.1.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to you all.
&gt; 
&gt; Now for a hard one. 
&gt; 
&gt; I've used dump/restore to successfully recover from 2 production
&gt; level hard disk crashes - so I really like them, since they have
&gt; saved my bacon. Linus reckons they are unreliable.
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/admin-primer/s1-disaster-backups.html">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-8.0-Manual/admin-primer/s1-disaster-backups.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; So I'm looking at tar (which I've used for years, but only
&gt; for ad hoc backups and moving stuff around).
&gt; And I'm looking at rotating rsync backups also.
&gt; 
&gt; Considering tar firstly.
&gt; 
&gt;       tar cfv bkup.tar /home
&gt; 
&gt; If the /home disk dies I can restore to the point at which I did the
&gt; tar.
&gt; 
&gt; Now assume /home is about 60Gb.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using disks to backup. Tape drives with high capacity are
&gt; expensive and therefore not beloved of those who control the
&gt; budget.
&gt; 
&gt; I can do tar of everything every day and buy 30 disks per month. 
&gt; That is pretty expensive.
&gt; 
&gt; With dump I can do differential level 9 dumps daily (level 3 weekly)
&gt; and keep masses of history. At 1-4Gb per day I can fit about
&gt; 20 days on a $200 ide drive. One drive per month isn't quite
&gt; so bad, and recycling the disks after 6 or 8 months is acceptable. The
&gt; user who realises after a month that s/he deleted an important file
&gt; can get it back. I can recover from a crash and get within a
&gt; day of the disk image at the time of the crash. 
&gt; 
&gt; If I look at so-called "incremental" tar/pax and the like, they
&gt; don't appear to handle deleted files properly. They 
&gt; backup changed files but don't deal with the fact that I have
&gt; deleted 5 files and don't want them in a restore. Have I
&gt; missed something or does this really suck. If I restore
&gt; from the base tar and then the differential/incremental tar I 
&gt; am still stuck with all the files that were in the base tar but
&gt; deleted prior to the differential tar.  
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked at rotating rsyncs (see rsync web page). We used
&gt; these for a while but again we used more disk than was
&gt; considered acceptable - at least the recovery
&gt; logic is okay.  
&gt; 
&gt; I've also considered Amanda. It uses dump or tar, and if dump
&gt; is untrustworthy and tar has logic problems then I'm not
&gt; yet convinced to give it SERIOUS consideration. 
&gt; 
&gt; The red-hat page referred to earlier does a lot of handwaving but
&gt; doesn't really deal with the fact that full reliable disaster backups
&gt; appear to be a major problem if dump is ruled out as unreliable.
&gt; 
&gt; Opinions welcome.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Geoff Russell
