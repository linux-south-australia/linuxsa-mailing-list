I tried the Redhat updates thing (under subscription).  It was handy and
easy, but in the end I couldn't see the value.  Now, I just regularly
(say, monthly or when I can be bothered) grab all new updates from the
internode mirror (costs me nothing), whack them all in the same
directory (minus a few, such as kernel packages, which I'd do
separately) and run `rpm -Fvh *` in that directory.  This way only those
packages which are installed are updated, the rest of the rpms that I
don't need are left uninstalled.  Note that a little care is taken, I
don't just blindly update all, but it is IMHO just as easy as using the
redhat updates service, you have full control over your updates, and it
costs nothing.  New installations are just as easy.  Whack all required
packages in a directory and run `rpm -Uvh *` (as mentioned before), and
let rpm sort out the dependencies.  If outside packages are required,
grab the packages and throw them in the directory with the others, and
run `rpm -Uvh *` again until all deps are sorted out.

I don't see the need for a meta packager.  Rpm is a good enough package
manager by itself, if used correctly.

That's just my 10c (... Inflation - I remember when an opinion was just
2c ;).

LOL

&gt; NEVER EVER use --force or --nodeps options unless you're truly aware 
&gt; of the consequences!!!! One can easily trash their rpmdb that way!

I never have, even when I didn't know what I was doing...

&gt; The short answer is put both rpm's in the same empty directory and do 
&gt; rpm -Uvh *.rpm and rpm itself will sort out and resolve the dependancy

&gt; problem.

Yes, as I just said in another e-mail, get a meta packager which sorts
the problems out.

Have you ever experienced using the "real, paid for" thing that RedHat
has?
