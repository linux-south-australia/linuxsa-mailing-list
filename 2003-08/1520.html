Nameless one,

&gt; I need a  firewall, with a dashboard.

Agreed.

&gt; Not a rocket science degree.

But they are fun to get ;-)

&gt; What has Ettiquete got to do with it ?

I shall sing:

 "You don't understand..."

 [the witch singing to Repunzel in "Into the Woods"]

&gt; Was it Ettiquete for the dude that ripped me off  500, only to find
&gt; this dude had some form of control on MY firewall ? Ya know?

Probably not. But that is different from "list ettiqutte"

&gt; Understand where I am coming from.

&gt; AND, I will pay 500 again,but to be taught and run through the
&gt; process, once and for all, then I am outta here. I got others thing to
&gt; take care off.

Of course ;-)

&gt; I don't see why one is judged on Ettiquete in a learning forum.

I am currently scratching my head wondering how people can be so
misunderstanding. E-mail is obviously a different mindset.

I will try again:

You reacted negatively to Alan's idea that you should at least put a
small explanation of any URL you happen to post. I support Alan in this
sentiment [but Alan and I have had many a dogfight on and off list so
don't assume that I'm just some silly dolt who would do Alan's bidding
without question].

Your reaction, whilst understandable, wasn't terribly helpful to your
cause ;-)

If you get your document going you could attempt to convince
<A HREF="mailto:g@netcraft.com.au">g@netcraft.com.au</A> to put your suggestions, HOWTO or whatever up on the
tips page. You could also post a URL (with an explanation) of your FAQ
to this list. In addition, you could attempt to have it put up as part
of the Linux Documentation Project (<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</A>) - if you can't
fathom DocBook or don't want to, a nice word in my ear might convince me
to translate it into that format for you ;-)
