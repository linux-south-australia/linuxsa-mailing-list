MIMP are on Richmond rd. If you are coming from city are you cross Marion
road and just keep on going. There building backs onto the airport fence.

I'd be getting CAT 5E rather than CAT 5. It's not much more. There are two
main types Solid core and Stranded.

Solid Core is what is used for main cable runs and terminates on patch
panels or female RJ45 connectors. It is not really that good for making "fly
leads"

Stranded cable is what you would use for fly leads and crimping male RJ45
connectors onto.

Hi All,
    It has been a while since I was buying cable in Adelaide, but try
Muller's in Unley/Hyde Park - I used to buy cable of all kinds by the
kilometre from them, but they also do it by the roll. Failing that, try Mimp
Computer Cables, they have moved, but they were in Keswick.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Where to get cheap CAT5 in Adelaide


&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; I'm looking at buying a 100 metre roll of CAT5. If you saw my email about
&gt; the phone cable questions, i've decided to just buy CAT5 and connect RJ11
&gt; connectors for the phone extension i need. That way i'll have a heap left
&gt; over for networking and stuff for when i'll eventually need it.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know the difference between CAT5 types, and other info i need
to
&gt; know? I did some Googling but couldn't come up with much. Does anyone know
&gt; of a good site that has info on all networking and communication cables
etc,
&gt; or an up to date book even?
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, does anyone know where to get some cheap CAT5 in Adelaide? JayCar
&gt; has it for 75c/m, but i've heard you can get good quality cable for 40c/m.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
