&gt; &gt; &gt; Tertiary qualified
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm curious, why do people place this in IT job advertisements?
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my stab at some reasons:
&gt; 
&gt; * It's a moron-filter. Sure, you lose some potentially good 
&gt; people who are
&gt; underqualified, but in today's jobscape, that's not much to 
&gt; lose. Anyone who
&gt; really wants the job but isn't qualified will still apply 
&gt; anyway, but you
&gt; weed out the just-left-school-and-want-a-summer-job type 
&gt; (which you don't
&gt; get many of in winter, but I digress).

true, but we got over 100 apps for the last IT support role
i didn't think Adelaide had that may folks 'free' IYKWIM

&gt; * Culture. Tertiary education homogenises to some degree, 
&gt; and if you are in
&gt; a place where everyone has some sort of tertiary 
&gt; qualification, you'll fit
&gt; in better if you do too.

sometimes you find someone who has learned the,
"learn from history, or you're destined to repeat it"
and actually learn something while they are at Uni outside
their course work. which is one thing id look for.
 
&gt; * Lower risk. You know you're getting at least a certain 
&gt; level. It's a
&gt; fairly low level, but you have to be capable of tying your 
&gt; own shoelaces and
&gt; constructing a sentence to get any sort of tertiary 
&gt; qualification here.

that helps =)
 
&gt; * An acheivement. You weed out those who can't stick with 
&gt; the one thing for more than a week.

attention span of longer that one sentence also helps.

&gt; * Targetting. They aren't looking for someone who is a 
&gt; genius and highly experienced.
&gt; They want someone who is intelligent, has 
&gt; proven it, and wants an entry level position.

hitting the ground running helps. so entry level may not
be the right description.

&gt; &gt;  But the reason I ask is.. I started IT at uni, but I've 
&gt; &gt; dropped it for various reasons. If I am capable of 
&gt; &gt; self-learning and read books at a uni library, play with 
&gt; &gt; linux, do some work for people, work _with_ people more 
&gt; &gt; knowledgeable that me, etc. could I not be just as suitable 
&gt; &gt; for a job as someone who has a "Tertiary Qualification"?
&gt; 
&gt; You probably could... However, to those who don't know you, 
&gt; you instantly carry a higher risk...

=)

cheers,

Kim
