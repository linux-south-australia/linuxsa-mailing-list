Some time ago a close friend of mine received what she thought would help
her through her University studies: a computer provided by Computerbank.

Little could be further from the truth. In addition to dubious hardware
(this might be something to be expected from second hand hardware, but
consistent denials of problems by members of Computerbank left her feeling
aggravated, distressed and put down - the machine clearly was faulty with a
probable hardware conflict as the cause - though this was not accepted
by people at CB she dealt with).

After having got the machine to work for her, I find that the kernel 
running on the machine is 2.4.17 (notoriously buggy), the /etc/fstab entry
for the cdrom is broken and that KDE is a manky piece of crap (sorry to
delve into religion here, but why put on an environment that doesn't work
- my first experience with KDE (3.0.2) was finding the KMail is broken,
KSpread can't export to Excel (work requirement) and though it says it
can export to gnumeric, that fails). This really throws an insult at the
strengths of the underlying system (Debian GNU/Linux). Is providing flakey
(at best) software in these components likely to enable a computer (and
most proably a Linux) neophyte to use the machine, given that it takes a
degree of Linux awareness at least to fix or understand the issues
involved - I think not.

What I find myself asking is: What function does Computerbank play in
South Australia? Is it to provide functional computers to those in need
and who are in most probability not highly computer literate? Is it to act
in some degree as a Linux advocacy group? I would have to say that
Computerbank's efforts fail abysmally in both regards in the experience
that I have had with it through my friend.

regards
Dan Kortschak
