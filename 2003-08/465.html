&gt; &gt; IMHO that's the end of the argument.
&gt; &gt; I created it, I released it, I licensed it the way I wanted. If you
&gt; &gt; don't like the license then find some other codebase to work from. If
&gt; &gt; the licensing terms are such a problem then you could always write it
&gt; &gt; from scratch and then license it anyway you want.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Greed is the real enemy here and not the GPL.

This is a single word that covers a multitude of sins. Not all companies 
that use GPL'd software are evil and greedy. Some of them want to balance 
their desire to contribute with their need to remain competitive and their 
obligations under the GPL. Take Samba for example. There is a thriving 
community of people who work for companies as well as private 
contributors. Ethereal is another, albeit different, example, because no 
company that I am aware of sells Ethereal.

&gt; Colin,
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds like a good argument - short and simple, so it must be right.
&gt; But if I actually read what you've written, it all seems wrong.
&gt; [The following essayette is not attacking you personally, by the way.
&gt; I'm attacking the idea that individuals can own software or ideas.] 
&gt; 
&gt; The problem here is that everyone gets their ideas from everyone else.
&gt; We all live in a sea of ideas and benefit from them. There are very, very,
&gt; very, very few _new_ ideas which are _created_. 

But Colin is not talking about ideas, he is talking about copyright to 
the specific expression of those ideas embodied in his code. 

Other people are free to write it from scratch in a different way and they 
do not infringe his copyright.

Moreover, given the amount of effort required to turn a piece of software 
into a product, which is much larger than the effort to write a lot of 
GPL'd software [1], a number of companies will embark on rewriting. They 
do, however, want to use GPL'd software to gain entry to markets.

[1] Linux has had 12 years of development. It has also had considerable 
input from people employed by companies, and that has helped to turn it 
into an almost product. Samba is in a similar boat, but there are other 
methods of doing what Samba does, in particular, moving function into the 
kernel (to avoid starvation by NFS users, and to achieve much better 
performance, for example), so it is more likely to be re-written, at least 
in part.

The big issue with Linux, in my view, and I have spent years working with 
Linux, is that the GPL is not compatible with corporate needs when it 
comes to the Kernel.
