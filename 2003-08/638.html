I shouldn't take the bait but... The statement that we share 97% of our DNA
with chimps therefore blah blah ...  demonstrates the author is over dramatic
or an idiot.  Of the ~3.2 billion base pairs of DNA in humans less than 5% is
coding the remainder is non-coding (much of which is evolutionarily obsolete
junk).  Assuming chimps & humans are closely related & the difference between
us is within that 5% of genetically active DNA, we would only really share 40%
etc etc.

Each human being is 99.9 percent identical to every other human being, in terms
of DNA.  But the 0.1 percent difference is incredibly important. 

Imagine a world where misleading journalists were selected against instead of
rewarded :)

P.S. 3.2 billion base pairs.  Unlike binary (01), DNA has four bases (atcg) and
they are in pairs, ie the backup is the other  strand of the double helix.  All
we have to do now is solve what languages the 3.2 billion base pairs were
written in.

 Super Bad News Bears for all programmers, database admins,
 website designers, you have been replaced by an ape that will
 work for 93 cents an hour!  Go see
 <A HREF="http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp.">http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp.</A>
 
 This is good for smaller companies that cannot afford to
 hire real people to do their IT work.

Cheers,  Ian
