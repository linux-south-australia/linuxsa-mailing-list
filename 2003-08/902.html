I'd go buy a cheap, lowend laptop (eg. pentium anything) - get it's 
batteries repacked.

This'd give you about (let say) an hour or so just by itself, then most of 
them are/can be driven off around 12v, so worse comes to worse you can drive 
it from a car!  Laptops are designed to be low power, so a UPS should keep 
it up for a while and they have the advantage that the power can be 
disconnected/reconnected without rebooting - eg. to a cheap petrol generator 
or solar cells.

&gt; Just on the subject of the NY/Canada power outage, it occurred to me
&gt; that although the phone system is designed (at least it was before
&gt; semi-privatisation) for survival even in wars, and is powered by
&gt; a triple power supply (mains/batteries/generator), most people's
&gt; computers are not going to last 24 or 48 hours without mains power.
&gt; The phone will work but the computers won't.
&gt; 
&gt; A UPS will generally give up in an hour or so. The laptops will generally
&gt; give up in a couple of hours.
&gt; 
&gt; So maybe, just maybe, a linux PDA could be the solution. The idea would be
&gt; to have a large pack of batteries to keep a PDA going as a combined
&gt; firewall/router/mail-server. Then this could be the gateway for the
&gt; home network under normal circumstances, but during a long black-out, it
&gt; would be the only machine working. The idea would be that you could
&gt; send/receive text e-mails and browse the web to find out what's going on
&gt; out there. Right now, a lot of people in north-east america might be wishing
&gt; they had some such thing.
&gt; 
&gt; My questions are:
&gt; Is there anything obviously wrong with this idea?
&gt; And has anyone tried it?
&gt; And which kind of linux PDA would be best for this role?
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing that occurs to me is that linux PDAs might be set up as
&gt; single user mode machines. (I think I read this somewhere once.)
&gt; But that shouldn't make it impossible for the above gateway role.
&gt; 
&gt; When the big box of 48 batteries runs out, one could even resort to
&gt; recharging or powering with a bicycle, if one had such technology to hand.
&gt; But I don't plan to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just curious in casual sort of way. I don't want to start a riot....
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
