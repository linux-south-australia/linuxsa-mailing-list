But I am also dependent upon most everybody in society that do a job to 
fill a need I have. Clothesmakers, farmers, the grocery store owner and  
the petrol station [1]. But I also see your point, I can go to other gas 
stations, I can go to other supermarkets or petrol stations.  Each 
distribution's customization locks the customer in my turning off 
choices once present.

&gt;Of course, your distro vendor might be nice to you. But then you become _dependent_. Dependency is only painful when you try to break free. That's when you pay the price.
&gt;I know for a fact that some big companies regard "de-skilling" the user
&gt;
My great-grandparents immigrated to Ybbor City Florida from Santo 
Stephano di Quesquina, Sicilia, Italia in 1901.  They had a cow on their 
property and one of my [2](fu) nanno's chores was to milk the cow.   My 
father and I are deskilled in this respect, but I think societry is 
better for it.

&gt;as a primary objective of marketing. They _want_ you to become dependent on them.
&gt;  
&gt;
** Counterpoint:  As I describe above, I believe that there are two 
types of dependencies.  The first set of examples above are dependencies 
necessary to a modern society, but the second set, puposodly created 
dependency, I agree, is unnecessary and evil.

Ease of use,  is fundamental to progress. It creates efficiency, invites 
more users into the pool of contributors and helps advance society. **

&gt;Linux was supposed to set us free, 
&gt;
Conversely, I am free to not milk the cows.



In good debate and good fun,


Giovanni Antonio Leone di Ricardo  :-)

[1] Alan - pardon my AUism  here ;-)  - Yes you get a bit of a ribbing 
back, but its all in good fun.
[2] When my grandfather was alive, I asked him for help in interpreting 
the contents of these documents:
<A HREF="http://home.pacbell.net/jleone/DP.html">http://home.pacbell.net/jleone/DP.html</A>
<A HREF="http://home.pacbell.net/jleone/Passport.html">http://home.pacbell.net/jleone/Passport.html</A>
The front page shows the name "Cannella Giovanna fu Antonio in Leone" 
and "Leone Guisseppi di Pietro."
My grandfather, with cigar in hand, said "Let me tell you about the fu 
business.  See, it says Giovanna Cannella's husband (or father) Antonio 
is dead. Fu, means was. Guiseppi's father is Pietro."
That is all that I can understand about the documents, as I do not know 
Italian. Hopefully I can get them interpreted some day.
