&gt; Yes.  At home I don't do kernel development.  I use Linux for its

Michael,

Consider this scenario:

-	Major vulnerability is announced in either the kernel or
	in some library or some application.

-	You look at the distro's website for the fix.
	It's not there yet.

-	You look at previous security patches and realise that they
	usually take weeks to distribute a fix.

-	You download the fixed/patched software in source from the
	people who wrote it.

-	You try for 6 hours to get the source working on your distro's
	customised software, and fail completely.

This has happened to me.
The last time I can remember clearly was with sendmail.
I ended up dropping sendmail and used postfix instead.

The advantage of Open Source is supposedly that you can fix things that
don't work. Well, with an overly-customised distro, you _can't_ fix it
when it works. This is for several possible reasons:

-	The distro vendor takes too long to provide the patch.

-	The distro doesn't issue a patch because they don't think it's
	important enough an application.

-	The distro doesn't issue a patch because they're not supporting
	your old version any more - on that server which has been
	running trouble-free for the last 3 years, which you don't
	particularly feel like re-installing a whole distro on.

-	You may have updated your software from source at some stage,
	and the distro's patch may not be compatible with your way
	of setting up things.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
