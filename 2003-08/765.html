About 12 months ago, when MS viruses and worms were being reported
by the media, they generally said that "computers" were attacked.
Now more and more, they're getting a little bit more specific and
are saying things closer to the truth - that MS _software_ is being
attacked, not computers in general. I used to write to Register staff
to urge them to state clearly that linux systems were not affected and that
it was an MS software problem.

Now 12 months later, I look at the latest reporting from US internet news
media as recently quoted on slashdot and see these:

<A HREF="http://www.nbc10.com/technology/2400607/detail.html">http://www.nbc10.com/technology/2400607/detail.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.sunspot.net/technology/bal-mva-virus0812,0,856507.story?coll">http://www.sunspot.net/technology/bal-mva-virus0812,0,856507.story?coll</A>=bal-local-headlines

The first link starts off like this (and the first couple of sentences are the
ones that readers really register):

===================================================== 
PHILADELPHIA -- An Internet worm is spreading like wildfire on millions of
computers around the world, and it has infected Philadelphia's City Hall.

Computer Worm: GenericThe "LovSan" worm targets business, home and government
computers that run on Microsoft operating systems.
=====================================================

They start off talking about "computers", but in the second sentence 
talk about MS software specifically, which must get some readers' minds
thinking about the MS versus linux thing, and thinking: "Well, maybe
we'd better try that linux thing."

The second link has this:

=====================================================
Spreading Internet worm shuts down MVA
Targets flaw in Windows, appears on 4 continents 

A stealthy Internet worm infected more than a million computers Tuesday from
Glen Burnie to Hong Kong, knocking home computers off-line and crashing
corporate networks even as it taunted Microsoft chief Bill Gates for weaknesses
in his Windows software.
=====================================================

It has [MS-]Windows in the title line, and mentions it in the first sentence.

This, I claim, is different to 12 or 24 months ago, when IT writers all
gave the impression that computers is computers. Now they're all getting
stuck into MS software very specifically.

I claim that this is good news, and we should rejoice - as MS very certainly
would if linux got the same bad press. Mercy is a good thing, but should
one show mercy to the merciless? (That's _not_ a serious question...)

In discussions with the hoi polloi, I think that whenever someone talks about
viruses/worms attacking computers we should gently correct them by
mentioning that it's MS software which is vulnerable, not "the computer".
Too many people can't tell the difference.

Cheers and warmed-up toast,
Alan Kennington.
