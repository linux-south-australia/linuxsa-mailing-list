&gt;Yeah, trying out exchange is no probs! At *only* $2,281 (wholesale) or $3,079 
&gt;(rrp) for _5_ whole users, there's absolutely no problems in trying this 
&gt;software out!
&gt;&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

&gt;Okay, so they probably have demo versions, but anyway, for that price, it 
&gt;would want to be the most super-duper goldplated cooks-your-breakfast-for-you 
&gt;collaboration super-server known to mankind.

OK - two things here - first I suggested to find out what Exchange can do - they have a 90 day eval that can be downloaded and trialed for free.  If you want to find out what it can do - what better way than to get it, install it and try it - we all do that with Linux software to see what it's like.

Second - Gee Damien - you're paying WAAAAAY too much for your copy - fire your purchasing person.

Exchange 2003 Server with 5 CAL's retails for $2,395.00 (MS code 312-02613) including GST - and will be around for less depending on where you buy it from.  That's around $160/user per year (assuming a 3 year life-cycle).

But I agree with Matthew - it comes down to how much productivity can this can generate out of your people.  This is why Citrix sells for $12K on TOP of Windows 2000/2003 with TS CAL's and we have no problems selling that.  Because your TCO (total cost of ownership) can be *substantially* lower.

It all comes down to your attitude I suppose.  But if I show a client that by implementing technology (whatever that technology is) I could save them the equivalent of 1/2 or 1 FTE (full time employee) or increase their staff productivity by 20 minutes a week (easily) it brings it into perspective.

But this is a bit irrelevant - if we're talking 5 users who needed collaboration I would sell them Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 which has Windows 2000, Exchange 2000, ISA Server, Outlook, SQL Server 2000, Shared Fax and 5 CAL's.  All for well under $2,400 (OEM - Microsoft code E75-00650).  For the increased productivity it could provide it's superb value at under $150 per user per year (assuming a 3 year life cycle).  But now we're getting a little OT.  But remember - it's how you look at it.

As I said before - I would gladly look at a Linux solution - but all the ones I have looked at are far from mature - though some are very promising.

Kind regards,


Paul Vinton
