&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As far as I'm concerned, most definitely.  I use a dedicated address for
&gt; &gt; this mailing list (like yourself) and I am now receiving between 5-10
&gt; &gt; spams to this address each week (a lot of Nigerian scams oddly enough). 
&gt; &gt; As soon as it becomes a real problem for me, I will ditch this address
&gt; &gt; and dream up another and re-subscribe.
&gt; 
&gt; that must be pretty irritating to post to this list, maybe with a 
&gt; question on spamassassin ;-), and have your name crawled into a 
&gt; spammer's list!
&gt; 


Maybe it's not that bad.
On 2003-1-2, I subscribed to linuxSA as ak.linuxsa.
On 2003-6-5, I unsubscribed as ak.linuxsa because of a single spam.
Then I resubscribed as ak1.linuxsa on 2003-6-5.
Since then, I've had no spams to the new e-mail alias.
This is despite the fact that I post a lot (i.e. way too much for my own good)
to linuxSA.

So my conclusion is that linuxSA only gets vacuumed for victims about
every 6 months on average. (That's not a statistically sophisticated
inference, but it's on a par with a lot of inference in cosmology.)

Meta-conclusion: You have nothing much to worry about really.
Other lists that I subscribe to result in spam within weeks or just a couple
of months. So I continually have to invent new aliases in /etc/aliases
and in my .muttrc config files (many dozens, one for each mailing list)
for those other usages.

Meta-meta-conclusion: Just change your e-mail alias and start again.
You're not using your real e-mail address, are you? That's so 1990s.
The sure cure for spammage is: never tell anyone your real e-mail address!!

Cheers,
ak.
