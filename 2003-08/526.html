It must be late at night because I've just had another brainwave.
Here's an idea for a future linuxSA meeting:

Title:

	Comparative analysis of the principal OSS licences.

Abstract:

	For each of the principal OSS licences (GPL, BSD, Apache, etc. etc.),
	the following aspects are presented:

	Player categories:
		This is a list of the categories of people concerned with
		the licence, e.g. author(s), users, developers who want
		to create derived works, etc.

	IP object categories:
		The original work, derived works, the source, binaries,
		modules, combined works, patches, works under other licences,
                patents, etc.

	Action categories:
		Usage of the software, selling the software,
		distributing the software, modifying the software,
		distributing/using/selling a derivative,
		
	The rules:
		Lists of:
		-	Constraints and restrictions of the licence,
		-	Required actions of the licence.

--------------------------------------
And no way am I either willing or qualified to give such a talk.
But someone on the linuxSA list might be qualified.
Maybe a combination of people.

The constraint/restriction rules could be stated in an algorithm form:

	if (X and Y) then ! Z

where X, Y and Z are abbreviations for things in the "licence universe",
which is the set of player, object and action categories envisioned 
by the licence.
Required actions could be given in the form:

	(B && C) =&gt; A

which means that conditions or events B and C must be followed by action A. 
The licence universe should be presented like a set of struct/class
and variable declarations.

I think that linuxistas/linuxeros could find it easier to stay awake 
during such a presentation than while reading the legal gobbledygook
as written in the licences.

This would even be a great talk for someone to then re-work into a
linux conference item!
(I repeat... I am not mug or stupid enough to volunteer to do this...)

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
