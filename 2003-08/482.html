&gt; So the idea that "I created it" is preposterous. It shows the inherent
&gt; competitive individualism in the system. The idea that people can own ideas
&gt; is fostered by lawyers who make money out of defending property rights.

I don't think copyright protects the idea, rather the expression of the idea.
If I do come up with a truly new concept, and presuming I don't patent that
idea, then you are free to express it your own way.  You aren't automatically
free to copy my expression.

&gt; In my opinion, everyone should give away all of their software because it
&gt; is only a logical corollary of what went before and owes more debt to
&gt; the past than the future will owe to it.

That's a very interesting notion, with the corollary that an architect
should give away all of her designs, and perhaps a builder should build
it for nothing more than the cost of materials.  Unfortunately very few
builders or architects would be willing to work for free.  Likewise,
very few programmers are willing to work for free without having at least
some independant source of income.

Stallman holds, and I suspect that you, Alan, are saying a similar
thing, that programmers should only charge the initial customer for
development costs.  That belies the incredible difficulty of finding
somone willing to pay the many, many millions of dollars for, say, a small
accounting package.  On the other hand, it's quite easy to find millions
of different people willing to pay a little for it.  Hence MYOB et al.

&gt; The GPL, and the intellectual "property" fantasy in general, perpetuates
&gt; the notion that people are independent individuals who create ideas out of
&gt; nothing.

Not talking about intellectual property, but I see the fruits of my
labour as being just as much my property as they would be were I to work
using wood.  The fact that my endeavours produce something intangible
shouldn't diminish my ownership.  Perhaps you'd prefer the term,
"intangible property"?
