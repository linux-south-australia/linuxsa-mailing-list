Exerpt:

&gt; LWM: What's happening with your "No Secrets" effort?
&gt; esr: I'm trying to prove that the proprietary Unix vendors don't have 
&gt; any trade secrets. Right now I have enough people willing to sign 
&gt; affidavits about having uncontrolled read access to Unix source code 
&gt; that I can show there's been a pervasive failure to enforce even the 
&gt; minimum level of nondisclosure required to maintain trade secrecy. 
&gt; Thousands of people who have seen the Unix source code were never 
&gt; under nondisclosure. This is the kind of evidence that destroys 
&gt; trade-secrecy status.
&gt;
&gt; If SCO continues, I'll get enough signed affidavits to prove that they 
&gt; have no trade secrets.
&gt;
&gt; This is also an attempt to send a powerful message to potential future 
&gt; litigants: it's not safe to mess with the open source community 
&gt; because we can bite back.
&gt;
...

&gt; Ethically, OSI's position is that Unix belongs to the distributed 
&gt; development community that wrote it. SCO's threats broke the tacit 
&gt; understanding that kept us from asserting this for 30 years. It used 
&gt; to be that we agreed not to fuss over the fact that AT&T or Unix 
&gt; Systems Labs or Novell or SCO were claiming to own the code as long as 
&gt; they agreed not to fuss over the fact that every senior Unix developer 
&gt; had a technically illicit copy of the source code in his hip pocket.
&gt;
&gt; Everybody took code from everybody. AT&T used Berkeley and Xenix code 
&gt; and got called on it during a 1993 lawsuit. Truth is, the rights 
&gt; picture is so tangled that nobody's theory of ownership would stand 
&gt; close scrutiny of the source code's history. The law of intellectual 
&gt; property doesn't handle this kind of situation well. The equitable 
&gt; thing to do would be to just give up, throw it open, and admit it 
&gt; belongs to the hackers.
&gt;

Seems like a disconnect that, I don't feel that this plays very well for 
IBM. But then again, I don't know much about this stuff.

Comments ?
