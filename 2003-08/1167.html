<H1>substance theories for SCO gaining credibility?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Some of the theories that certain "substances" might be involved
in the behaviour patterns of certain SCO persons might be given some
encouragement by this:

SCO CEO says IBM behind open source attacks
<A HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/21/HNscoibm_1.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/21/HNscoibm_1.html</A>

=====================================================
IBM Corp. has been quietly stage-managing the open source community's response
to The SCO Group Inc.'s $3 billion lawsuit over Big Blue's contributions to the
Linux source code, SCO's Chief Executive Officer Darl McBride said in an
interview at his company's SCO Forum user conference in Las Vegas this week
[...]

However, SCO's public relations (PR) department has had a busy few months.
McBride proudly dumped two phone-book-sized binders of press clippings on the
stage during his SCO Forum keynote on Monday as proof that his company had
become more relevant in the high technology industry. SCO has issued 46 press
releases since filing suit against IBM on March 7. Last year it issued only 29
press releases between March and August.
[...] 

McBride declined to reveal the sources of his allegations, but he claimed that
IBM was involved in Novell's and Red Hat's responses to SCO's lawsuit. "Even
though IBM looks like they're not really involved in it, they're very
involved," he said. "From a PR standpoint, they're able to extract themselves
from (the dispute), and so they throw Red Hat at us, they throw Novell at us,
they have (Open Source Initiative President) Eric Raymond on their payroll.
They have all these guys that they fund and then they just step back and watch
the fracas go on." 
[...]

McBride also pointed to the involvement in the dispute of the Free Software
Foundation, whose legal counsel, Eben Moglen, has issued a position paper
critical of SCO, and Linus Torvalds, who has been increasingly vocal in his
criticism of the Unix company. "You've got all of these guys and it looks like
the whole world is coming against SCO. It's really IBM that has wired in all of
these relationships," he said. "That's why it looks like they're sitting back
and not doing anything. It's us fighting a whole bunch of people that they put
on the stage." 
=====================================================

So first he talks very proudly about all the attention, and then complains
about all the attention. Does this sound to anyone like it's similar to
something they've read in a psy textbook?

Am I not right in thinking that when you've got a court case underway,
you're supposed to be extremely guarded in talking to the press.
SCO have been constant blabber-mouths. I bet their legal people are
pulling their hair out -- unless their getting paid cash in advance.

Cheers,
ak.
