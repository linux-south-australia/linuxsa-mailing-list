Umm, Hi? Just subscribed to the mailing list (and was amazed to see
my inbox tripple in size)

Ignore the subject tag - it's just to make mail rules a little easier

As you can probably see, I'm still in Windows but only because I've
just reinstalled and left a quarter of the hard drive unpartitioned
so I have space for Linux (last time I tried installing it, Mandrake
wouldn't get past the initial boot and Debian wouldn't let me resize
the FAT32 partition). I was wondering, in your opinions, which should
I go with? Mandrake 9 or Debian 3? I have both on CD sets. My ex and
lots of our friends all say Debian but I'm not exactly experienced in
Linux yet (apart from it saving my rear a last year when the Windows
dialup went wonky and the only way I could connect was through
Mandrake 8.0)

Issues that will influence me include the Brooktree capture card I've
been using to convert all the video tapes I've bought over the years
over to VCD, some rather odd results trying to print to m HP IIIP
laser printer in Linux (test page turned into 30 pages of jargon) and
not even knowing if my webcam, scanner and digital camera even HAVE a
Linux driver available. While I know I can still dual boot, it'd be
nice not to have to swap OS just to access the devices. The main
reason for dual boot is that I like to play the occasional game :)

Also, I'll be transferring to ADSL in the near future. I think the
D-link ADSL internal modem comes with Linux drivers, though. Will
this mean many headaches during the changeover?

Sorry to bombard you with so many questions straight up
