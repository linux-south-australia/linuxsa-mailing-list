&gt; Are you really happy to have a distribution which is incompatible

Yes.  At home I don't do kernel development.  I use Linux for its
applications and for application development.  I don't need ableeding-edge kernel.   I just want software that works.


&gt;                          I usually keep the same distro on a machine
&gt; for a few years - when I want to try a new distro version, I buy a
&gt; new machine to put it on. But I do like to update old kernels.


Why?  Not meaning to take a swipe, but most people shouldn't care about
running new kernels on old machines, unless you need support for new
hardware, which isn't in your user case.

&gt; Recently I updated the kernel on a SuSE machine which was only a
&gt; couple of months old - and the entire music software stopped working.
&gt; The reason was that they had back-ported the kernel 2.5.x ALSA software
&gt; into the 2.4.x kernel. So now every time I update the kernel modules
&gt; (which is 10 times a day during active deveopment), I have to also
&gt; re-install ALSA over the top of this.


Ok, so you are talking about kernel module development.  I can see why
you'd want to upgrade your kernel often.

&gt; The worst thing is that I can't work out how to build the kernel from
&gt; even the customised sources. When I try to recompile the SuSE kernel
&gt; from &gt; the supplied source package, it just doesn't build a usable
&gt; kernel.&gt; They didn't provide the .config file. So the rest of the source is
&gt; pretty much useless.


Ahhh, Red Hat differ.  They provide all the source, all the .configs for
all architectures, and it's all GPL :-)

&gt; My measure of the "customisation badness" of a distribution would be this
&gt; test:  Can you download any more recent kernel or package from source
&gt; from the net and get it working on the distribution with reasonable
&gt; effort?  If you can't, then you _are_ "locked in".


I see it differently.  I want a distribution that is entirely free - which
means I see Red Hat and Debian as my two main choices.

Using a kernel.org kernel isn't top of my agenda.  A tested, supported,
integrated-with-rest-of-the-environment kernel is what I want, at least at
home.

If I wanted to follow kernel.org kernels, then I'd probably run Debian -
isn't that what most of the kernel hackers use? :-P

&gt; I just mention this as an example of what the article was talking about.
&gt; In an attempt to get more control over users, the distro vendors are
&gt; getting up to all sorts of sneeky tricks to "brand" their "product".
&gt; This kind of alienation of users from the means of distribution will
&gt; lead to much unhappiness in the long run, requiring yet another
&gt; revolution.


Again I see this differently.  I see this as companies trying to make a
buck.  (another Americanism :)  The only way distributors can
differentiate their product from another is by testing, customisation, and
ease of use.

I don't have any problem with distributions doing this, as long as the
result is free software.  I can always work out what's going on, and
change things myself that way, if I have the need or desire.
