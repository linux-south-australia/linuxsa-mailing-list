&gt; Consider this scenario:
&gt;
&gt; - Major vulnerability is announced in either the kernel or
&gt; in some library or some application.
&gt;
&gt; - You look at the distro's website for the fix.
&gt; It's not there yet.

Well, Red Hat *are* pretty good at this.  Usually remotely-exploitable
kernel problems get fixed as or before the announce is made.
If it's not there (like the OpenSSL problems recently) the upstream
developer often provides fixes for recent Red Hats anyway.
&gt; - You look at previous security patches and realise that they
&gt; usually take weeks to distribute a fix.

You need to look at locally-exploitable vs remotely-exploitable
announcements.  If it's only exploitable locally, there's less urgency for
the upgrade.  Afterall, they need to get past my firewall, and in via ssh
or smtp or http.
I still want / need to upgrade asap, but a discovered bug in gtetrinet
isn't as severe as one discovered in Apache (unless you are Geoffrey :-P
&gt; - You download the fixed/patched software in source from the
&gt; people who wrote it.
&gt;
&gt; - You try for 6 hours to get the source working on your distro's
&gt; customised software, and fail completely.
&gt;
&gt; This has happened to me.
&gt; The last time I can remember clearly was with sendmail.
&gt; I ended up dropping sendmail and used postfix instead.

And that's an option too.

&gt; The advantage of Open Source is supposedly that you can fix things that
&gt; don't work. Well, with an overly-customised distro, you _can't_ fix it
&gt; when it works. This is for several possible reasons:
&gt;
&gt; - The distro vendor takes too long to provide the patch.

Supplier dependant.  I find mine is ok.

&gt; - The distro doesn't issue a patch because they don't think it's
&gt; important enough an application.

Supplier dependant.  I find mine is ok.

&gt; - The distro doesn't issue a patch because they're not supporting
&gt; your old version any more - on that server which has been
&gt; running trouble-free for the last 3 years, which you don't
&gt; particularly feel like re-installing a whole distro on.

Agreed.  This is a concern.  But I look at it this way, if I'm paying for
support, then I expect that I can get an update right away.  But if I'm
doing it the "free way" using a downloadable ISO and haven't paid a cent
to my distribution, it's a bit rich to expect them to continue to support
a free (cost) product for more than 3 years.
(Some) Linux distributors do have long-term supportable OSes.  You need to
pay for that supported OS though.  I'm happy with the trade-off.
&gt; - You may have updated your software from source at some stage,
&gt; and the distro's patch may not be compatible with your way
&gt; of setting up things.

Which is a problem if you are using software that the vendor doesn't
include by default.  If you go your own way, then be it on your own head -
it's only fair to expect it to be less than trivial.
