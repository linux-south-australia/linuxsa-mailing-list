What's with that url? dot com dot com? Weird... If I go to <A HREF="http://news.com/,">http://news.com/,</A>
it redirects to news.com, and <A HREF="http://com.com/">http://com.com/</A> goes to cnet.com... Isn't one
.com enough?

&gt; Brian,
&gt; 
&gt; If I'm not wrong, the author may be talking in particular 
&gt; about those annoying kernel customisations which SuSE and 
&gt; RedHat make, with the result that when you download the 
&gt; standard kernel and use it, some subset of applications 
&gt; ceases to work correctly. Is that what he's talking about? Or 
&gt; is he talking about the configuration or installation tools?

I think it's a general set of strategies designed to lock the user in. It
includes kernel customisations, application customisations, UI
customisations, and so on -- anything designed to make you stick with distro
X, even if it's not as good as Distro Y. They all do it.

&gt; 
&gt; Linux users _are_ very dependent on the distributions because 
&gt; no one who has a real life has the time to bundle together 
&gt; and compile/configure 2000 applications or even only 200 
&gt; applications in their latest versions, not even once a year. 
&gt; So the distributions are necessary for people who have other 
&gt; things to do. But then they do these annoying customisations.

I think David Newall has the time to do that, judging from what he told me a
month or two ago ;)

&gt; Question:
&gt; Does anyone happen to know which distributions are minimally 
&gt; or not at all affected by this vendor customisation practice? 
&gt; I know from experience that SuSE definitely has harmful 
&gt; kernel customisations in the above sense, and I've heard 
&gt; reports that RedHat has them too.

I don't think Debian is much, but then, it's affected by other things
(timeliness). I'd imagine that gentoo and friends are largely unnaffected by
this, though you do have to invest a lot of time in compiling (at least,
watching it compile -- I don't think you have to do much)... 

However... The problem then, is that you have a whole lot of semi-configured
and unintegrated software. It's a weird tradeoff, actually. On the one hand,
you have the almost effortless integration of Windows and MacOS (install it,
and it's all integrated pretty well, and configured ready to go), and on the
other, you have the collection of unrelated software that is (say) gentoo
(not that I've used it, I'm just speculating), which you then have to
configure and integrate. Somewhere in the middle are a plethora of other
distributions, with RedHat on the highly integrated end of the spectrum, but
still not near MS and Apple.

The tradeoff is that to make something well-integrated and useful, you
really have to make choices on behalf of the user, which effectively acts as
a lock-in, because then they become dependant on these choices. Of course,
there are many things that could be done to make this lock-in less severe,
but most distros want to make money, and lock-in is the best (or at least,
the most proven) way to do that.

Frankly, I'm sick to death of choices. Every time I need something, I have
to find out what's out there, what features it provides, try it out, compare
it against three or seven alternatives, discover after a few weeks that my
first choice has a major annoyance with it, and start again. It's far worse
for people who aren't computing types -- they don't want choice, they don't
even want to be able to make a choice... they want "click here for email"...
It's enough for them to have to choose between email and wordprocessing, let
alone three office suites and nineteen email packages.

Anyway, what was I saying? Ah yes, "vendor customisations considered
harmful"... I can see that they could be harmful, and I can see that they
could be useful. So far, the closest I have seen to a system which is up to
date, has few "non-standard" customisations etc, and just works, is FreeBSD.
However, you pay by compiling everything, and from the lack of integration
that comes as a result of the lack of customisation...
