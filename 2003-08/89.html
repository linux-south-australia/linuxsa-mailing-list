&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone help with the following:
&gt;
&gt;When I start a terminal in Xwindows and login as &lt;user&gt; then su to
&gt;superuser, $PATH stays the same as the setting for &lt;user&gt; even when I
&gt;have set the PATH variable under /root/.bash_profile?
&gt;
&gt;Where do I set the PATH variable? For example I want it to include /sbin
&gt;and /usr/sbin for root with an X terminal (started with &lt;user&gt; and
&gt;su'd). /etc/profile includes /sbin and /usr/sbin for root, but only if I
&gt;login as root from a login prompt!
&gt;
&gt;How do I get rid of the annoying "No such file or directory" even if all
&gt;the directories DO exist, for example: logging in as root from the login
&gt;prompt, then typing $PATH gives me all the paths I want with the "No
&gt;such file or directory" appended, when the directories all exist?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
&gt;
&gt;kind regards,
&gt;Luke

Luke,

     If you have a read at the man page for `su` you'll see that if you 
include the "-" in the command it will use the user's environment. eg: 
`su - root` or `su -`.  The `su` command if you are not already aware 
can su to any user but the default user is root if no name is specified 
hence the `su -`.  Your issue about just typing in $PATH is that you are 
missing one important thing.  You are typing it in on the "command" line 
so therefore it expects a command.  When you expand the variable $PATH 
all by itself after running su to root it should say something simliar to:

su: /sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin: No such file or directory.

Now the command that you have told the shell to run in this case is 
"/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin".  As you can tell this is not a 
command.  What you are looking for is this `echo $PATH`.
Now if you still feel like changing the $PATH variable for all users 
after they have su'd to the approriate user, it becomes a little more 
involved because as far as I know you'll have to recompile it with the 
default $PATH built in.  Before you do that though try using the "-" and 
see if that fixes your problems first.

Chris-
