Let's look at an analogy.

With all the devastation that is going on in the world, lets take the 
example of a terrorist from Afghanistan. Now, that terrorist is set on 
bringing down everything that western society stands for. So, that terrorist 
creates bombs, attacks, hijacks, to bring down that western society. Let's 
look at western society - they're happy with what they have got, there is no 
strict rules to live their lives by, and they want to keep it all simple.

Now let's bring this analogy to light. Whilst I am not suggesting that Linux 
users are terrorists by any means, they are probably the ones that are 
exploiting the holes in all of Microsoft's systems, resulting in them 
finding thousands. Microsoft (western society) is happy with something that 
is easy to use, and doesn't require a degree in rocket science to 
understand. They have got no beef with trying to exploit the holes in Linux, 
resulting in 'not many' being found.

I come from a Microsoft background, and am TRYING very hard to get my head 
around Linux. I'm a smart guy, and I pick things up quickly, but one of the 
problems is getting use to Linux culture. You're all very good at what you 
do and can often talk in a language that you think people like me 
understand. However, this is not always the case.

I hope no one has taken offense to this, as it was not my intention.

Luke
