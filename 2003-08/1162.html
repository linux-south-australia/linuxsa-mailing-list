* Luke Nuske &lt;<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa_newbie@hotmail.com">linuxsa_newbie@hotmail.com</A>&gt; [2003-08-22 10:13]:
&gt; Let's look at an analogy.
&gt; 
&gt; With all the devastation that is going on in the world, lets take the 
&gt; example of a terrorist from Afghanistan. Now, that terrorist is set on 
&gt; bringing down everything that western society stands for. So, that 
&gt; terrorist creates bombs, attacks, hijacks, to bring down that western 
&gt; society. Let's look at western society - they're happy with what they have 
&gt; got, there is no strict rules to live their lives by, and they want to keep 
&gt; it all simple.
&gt; 
&gt; Now let's bring this analogy to light. Whilst I am not suggesting that 
&gt; Linux users are terrorists by any means, they are probably the ones that 
&gt; are exploiting the holes in all of Microsoft's systems, resulting in them 
&gt; finding thousands. Microsoft (western society) is happy with something that 
&gt; is easy to use, and doesn't require a degree in rocket science to 
&gt; understand. They have got no beef with trying to exploit the holes in 
&gt; Linux, resulting in 'not many' being found.

Well, yes and no. MS is a big target, and there are a lot of MS users
that actively 'despise' MS. Some have found the experience so
unrewarding that they have changed systems to Linux/Mac/*BSD. 

I guess if you had to measure it, you'd have to look at the tools used
to exploit the systems. Most viruses (virii) I have had a look at have
got a tell-tale string in them that says 'This Program cannot be run in
MS-DOS mode' or something to that effect. Seems they were programmed in
windows then, more than likely. 

I guess it's not just linux users that dislike MS. Some of their own
users are guilty :)

&gt; 
&gt; I come from a Microsoft background, and am TRYING very hard to get my head 
&gt; around Linux. I'm a smart guy, and I pick things up quickly, but one of the 
&gt; problems is getting use to Linux culture. You're all very good at what you 
&gt; do and can often talk in a language that you think people like me 
&gt; understand. However, this is not always the case.

Communication 101: Ask verifying questions, even if you think you
understand. This helps the sender as well as the receiver of the
communication.

&gt; 
&gt; I hope no one has taken offense to this, as it was not my intention.

Not me :)
