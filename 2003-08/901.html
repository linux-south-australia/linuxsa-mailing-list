&gt; It's probably also worth your while to list exact chipsets are used in

David,

I'd like to second that.
Installing one's own choice of linux on any machine, but very especially
on laptops, is facilitated enormously by knowing what the hardware is.
Most distros are pretty good at picking up most things these days,
but there's always some frustrating last bit of info that you can't get.

Since most linux "power users" (e.g. all linuxSA denizens) are going to
rip out whatever's on the laptop and roll their own, the most helpful thing
by far is just to verify that _some_ linux OS can run on the thing and
can use most of the chips/peripherals/interfaces on the thing, and
then provide a data sheet to help the user install their own linux flavour.
After all, as time goes by, a single machine will normally go through
a big heap of different distro installs - even different OSs.
And then that initial installation becomes a dim memory in ancient history.

Personally, I've never had a single successful linux OS upgrade. I always
update things by downloading/building/configuring source - or I rip out
the whole distro and start again. That's a different scenario to what
the MS crowd usually work with. I know that some people do successfully
update their linux distro from version N to version N + 1. It's just
never worked for me.

On day 1, it's nice to have a working linux OS on the machine.
But on day 1000, it's unlikely that the original OS will still be there.
So specs, specs, specs... and more specs. The more, the better.

Cheers,
ak.
