Bullshit.

Somebody poured invective in your ear and without any filter attached
you believed it reflected on the whole of state advocacy of lInux.
Bullshit is what you heard and that is also exactly what you shared with
this list.

There are no issues of advocacy of Linux. Computerbank has bent itself
in double trying to achieve a satisfactory outcome to this problem. The
group have gone well outside of their normal reasonable guidelines just
to see that this person is satuisfied with what is after all a FREE gift
from a FREE service. All this without a word of thanks from the poor
affected recipient and now she has delivered by proxy two damaging
emails with not a scap of truth included in either of them. What is her
next trick? The Advertiser? Today Tonight?

That a person could find another willing victim to hear their BS tale of
woe, that another person could willingly spread the BS without a
momentary thought that they had only heard one side of the story, these
are the things that sadden me about this sordid affair.

Your post was in very poor taste and at the very least a sincere apology
to Romana, Shaun and the rest of the ComputerBank volunteers is
required.

&gt; However it is clear that members of the list do not feel this is the
&gt; case.

All that is clear is that the side of the story you heard and responded
to is way removed from what has actually transpired. Nothing to do with
what the members wish, you have trespassed on the truth and need to
acknowledge that mistake.

Cheers,

Ian
