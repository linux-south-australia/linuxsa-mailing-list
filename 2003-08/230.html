<H1>Mystery of the dead keyboard -- did the mouse do it?</H1>

Greetings,

Let me tell the story of the mysterious dying keyboard (and mouse)...

My wife came home and went to use her Debian computer, but found the
screensaver on.  "Nothing that a little wiggle of the mouse won't
fix" she thought, but she was wrong.  Wiggling did nothing and she
was forced to revert to the "hit a key on the keyboard" method, which
fortunately did work.  The mouse (a very intelligent Microsoft one)
was completely on strike, refusing to move, so she decided to exit
Star Office using the keyboard.  This did work though she noticed the
keyboard was rather sluggish.

She rang her husband (me) who suggested she do a Ctr-Alt-F1 and do
things in console mode.  The keyboard obediently brought up a
console but that was the last she heard from it.  Trying to 
type in a username was like screaming in a vacuum.  Dead.  Keyboard
and mouse.

Husband came home a bit later and went to investigate the computer.  The
screensaver had come on by this time and no amount of keyboard or mouse
stimulation would make it budge.  It was time for the __hard__reset__.

A little background information will be helpful at this stage... I
originally had installed Progeny Debian (sort of potato) on the
computer.  We then bought a second hard drive and installed Woody
Debian on it.  It has been this second installation that my wife 
has been using.  I hadn't got around to setting up lilo yet so
she has been booting from a floppy.  Ie, hard drive boot -&gt; the
old Progeny Debian installation; floppy boot -&gt; the new Woody
Debian.

So after the __hard__reset__ I put in the boot floppy and waited
for the reboot to solve all my problems.

But solved they were not.  The boot process failed with a message
that said "boot failed".  I then tried booting from the hard drive
into the old Progeny installation.  Booting seemed to proceed fine,
then gdm started up and a login box beckoned me to type in my user
name.  Sigh of relief.  But I sighed too soon, for it soon became
apparent that keyboard and mouse were still out on strike!

I tried another Progeny hard drive boot, but this time into single
user mode.  It did the initial boot phase fine and then gave me
a prompt, but would the keyboard respond.  No.

I booted using an old debian install floppy.  Relief.  The floppy
booted fine, and when it had finished, I could use my keyboard!!
I went to console 2 and started looking around.  The hard drive
partitions looked fine.

To stop this story getting too much longer than it already is I
will skip a few minor adventures.  Basically I worked out
that the keyboard also worked fine if I booted the Woody
installation using the Debian rescue CD and only used console
mode.  It worked fine in console mode, but when I brought
up X, mouse and keyboard would freeze.

I noticed that gdm is not installed under Woody, but I think it
was under the Progeny install.  I am guessing that there is something
wrong with either the mouse or with the onboard "mouse interaction
hardware".  I am also guessing that whatever is wrong is interfering
with the keyboard so that the keyboard only works when the mouse
is not being listened to.

Do people concur with my conclusions?  Any ideas about whether it
is the mouse or the motherboard circuitry?  I have access to another
Microsoft "intelligent" mouse, so I could plug that in, but is it
possible that this could damage the mouse (if the motherboard
circuitry is dodgy)?  Are there any other tests, suggestions,
fixes, etc people could suggest?

Thanks,

Mark.

P.S. The only clue that "the mouse did it" theory doesn't match is
the fact that the woody customized boot floppy didn't work, ie
having a "boot failed" message.  It has always worked in the past
so why would a mouse problem affect this?

P.P.S. The other clue I haven't mentioned is that when I tried to
do a single-user mode boot of the Progeny installation I think I
remember a kernel message complaining I think about the loading
of the "input" module --- recall that this seemed to boot okay
but with the keyboard not responding.
