&gt; So it looks like I have a dud Abit BP6 board.

Take a close look at the (twenty or so) larger electrolytics. Is there any
sign of bulging on their tops? It may not be blatantly obvious at first, but
if you can spot even the slightest deviation from being perfectly flat
compared with one that is perfectly flat then you will recognise the symptom
immediately. I've found this easiest under a direct spot light source (e.g.
a torch) and using the reflection.

If you do find evidence of bulging then your board is most likely the victim
of bad electrolytic capacitors (it appears to have been a problem with the
electrolyte used in low ESR electrolytics, as typically used in switched
mode power supply circuits). As it happens I'm currently in the process of
repairing three Abit VP6 boards which are all victims of these capacitors
(in this case they all appear to carry the brand name "Jackon"). The first
board was successfully resurrected a couple of weeks ago from exhibiting
zero activity to running with its dual P3 1000MHz CPUs quite happily.

You're welcome to contact me for a repair attempt if you like. Or if you're
ready to trash the board I'd certainly like to take it off your hands to try
to resurrect it for myself.
