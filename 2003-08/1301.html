I am going to reply to myself.

&gt; &gt; The linux community is far stronger than being hurt by claims about
&gt; &gt; a volunteer organisation. Computerbank will not be hurt by my claims
&gt; &gt; if it is as efficient an organisation as it says.
&gt; 
&gt; Not, it will not be hurt by the claims of lone fuckwites like you will
&gt; it?

Now that was an ill choice of words wasn't it? I apologise to the list
for using the non-stard, obviously misspelled word "fuckwites". I mean
"fuckwits". Notwithstanding, I am attempting to think of a word that
isn't a swear word that embraces the meanings (denotation AND
connotation) of "fuckwit".

/me ponders

How about: "nincampoop of the worst kind"?

LMAO

Yes, that does it. It doesn't force me to use the word "person" at all.
I wouldn't like to use the word "person" in this case - it's too nice,
besides which I don't want to be insulting absolutely everybody all at
once.

Therefore, the winner of the "Nincampoop of the Worst Kind Award" this
week is:

 "Dan Kortschak"

In fact someone should respell his name as 'Dan "Damn" Kotschak'
;-P
