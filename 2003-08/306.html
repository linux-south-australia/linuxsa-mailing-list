&gt; 
&gt; I tried the "powering down the box and removing the mains" suggestion
&gt; and, low and behold, the mouse and keyboard now work fine!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to everyone for their suggestions!
&gt; 
&gt; It still seems strange to me though why such drastic actions should
&gt; be necessary to get a piece of hardware to work.

I used to have an MSI motherboard that would just stop working while it
was doing anything cpu intensive To fix it I had to take the following
steps (and yes this is the only thing that would work)

1. Power Off
2. Remove CPU (athlon with super stiff heat sink)
3. Power on or 30-60 seconds
4. Power Off
5. Put CPU back in
6. Turn Power back on

This had to happen sometimes 3 times in one day. It was finally fixed
one day when the screwdriver I used to unclip the heat sink went through
the motherboard. Now I don't have the problem at all.
The above fix I found posted on the net by another proud owner of an
MSI-6630. I guess they all didn't do it but it was a major pain.
