Hi Evan,

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; I have recently upgraded my system by installing a new ABIT IS7 (p4)
&gt; motherboard. The board is good and has on board gigabit lan (even
&gt; though
&gt; the specs say otherwise)
&gt; So far I have managed to track down a module for the LAN from ASUS
&gt; (of all places) (which runs the same 3com onboard chip) The module
&gt; appears
&gt; to work as I compiled it and fired up eth0 and I could ping my other
&gt; machines.

Great !

&gt; 
&gt; The problem is I have tried running insmod 3c2000.o and it placed it
&gt; in
&gt; /proc/modules I pinged but I cant do much else - the gateway and other
&gt; things are not setup (normally done from the DHCP server but seeing I
&gt; manually ifconfig up I hardcoded the ip address ). I have never faced
&gt; this
&gt; (installing a custom module) before as most of my hardware was always
&gt; a
&gt; generation behind and always autodetected.

To get dhcp up, bring eth0 down with 'ifconfig eth0 down'
then try 'dhcpcd eth0'.
This should auto-get the IP address & gateway info from the dhcp server.
Check it with 'ifconfig' & 'route'

If dhcp is giving problems, less /var/log/messages & /var/log/syslog on
the dhcp server to check for any errors. If your dhcpd.conf on the
server is using MAC addresses to identify hosts on the network, then it
will need to be changed to include the MAC address (HWaddr: in ifconfig)
of your new NIC.

If it does get the IP address, but not the gateway, you can manually set
it up like so:
'route del default'
'routed add default gw &lt;ip-address_of_gateway&gt;'

If all is well & you can now ping remote IP's through the gateway, then
it's time to make it automatically set your network up on boot. How this
is done depends largely on what linux distribution you're using. If it's
either Slackware or Gentoo, I can help, otherwise I wouldn't have a clue
:)

But to make this transition easier you want to be able to modprobe the
3c2000.o module.

'cp 3c2000.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/'
then run 'depmod -a'
You should now be able to 'modprobe 3c2000'

&gt; I may have another question regarding with ac97 sound

If memory serves, ac97 is a type of audio codec used by many different
manufacturers of soundcards. So, if it's your soundcard your looking to
setup here you'll need to provide the brand.
'lspci | grep audio' should do the trick.

Hope at least some of this helps. Nice specs on the new box btw ;-)

Regards,
Rick
