Hi.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why should I have to WASTE 30Mb of my customers' memoru just so
&gt; &gt; &gt; OpenOffice starts quickly? It's a total WASTE of resources. If we
&gt; &gt; &gt; let OO through we let them all..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Kingmax 256DDRPC2700 (333MHz)SuperRAM with tiny BGA tech. $68.00 +GST
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sure, 68*1.1/256*30= $8.76
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So your customers are going to forego $8.76 wholesale worth of memory to
&gt; &gt; eliminate the thing YOU are telling us is a critical stumbling block to
&gt; &gt; acceptance of the package. Have you checked out how much memory the MS
&gt; &gt; Office preloader takes up? You'd have to deduct it from this figure by the
&gt; &gt; way...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Next argument please, that one was total Hobbit Sh*t.
&gt; 
&gt; okay, so it's _only_ 30M... some people don't have that much to 
&gt; spare, and don't have the option to buy more memory just so they can 
&gt; have something preloaded. and where will you draw the line? maybe 
&gt; next you want your web browser preloaded... and then your email 
&gt; client... and then what? once you accept that preloading one thing 
&gt; is helpful, you're opening the door to preloading that comes to 
&gt; hundreds of MB of memory that might not even be used before the 
&gt; computer is shut down. and that's a big waste.
&gt; 
&gt; and even if it's only OO, putting aside 30M that some users might 
&gt; not use 
&gt; (some people don't like word processors, and stick to text editors 
&gt; and the like where they can) is still a waste. and yes, you can't 
&gt; compare OO to MS Office until they're both loaded only when needed,
&gt;  no preloading at all for either

That's fair enough, and I agree with you. My suggestion to preload was in
response to DL's assertion that his customers are non-technical drones who
will not think if they want the pre-load or not, and who will bleat loudly
that OO is as slow as treacle. Admittedly, I'm guessing that these customers
have bought new hardware that will be equipped with a reasonable amount of
memory, but DL does work for a HW company...

Even so, if OO is preloaded and doesn't get used, I'd expect it to get swapped
at some point, which would largely defeat the point of the pre-load anyway.
Casual users of OO are probably faced with slow start-up in any case.
