&gt; Some time ago a close friend of mine received what she thought would help

Yes, Dan, I am aware of whom you are speaking of.

&gt; Little could be further from the truth. In addition to dubious hardware
&gt; (this might be something to be expected from second hand hardware, but
&gt; consistent denials of problems by members of Computerbank left her feeling
&gt; aggravated, distressed and put down - the machine clearly was faulty with a
&gt; probable hardware conflict as the cause - though this was not accepted
&gt; by people at CB she dealt with).

This is so untrue as to be laughable and insulting. As someone who spent
several hours in
1 building the box
2 training your friend
3 together with three others, troubleshooting this box several times,
including replacing the modem (which we never got paid for, btw - we let
that go because we felt she had lucked out with such teethingf problems)
4 organised a cheerful volunteer to pick up this system several times,
and troubleshoot in house, because she couldnt get to us. not once,
several times. no petrol costs asked, nothing.

I am finding it worst of all that this person has now TWICE used other
people to complain for her. She originally approached me directly - i
tried to make a couple of appointments to get to her, but as a very
pregnant woman moving house on my own, I COULDNT do it. But i told her I
would happily fix it if she could come to me. But she didnt. After that,
when her friend made a complaint via email to teh list, we cheerfully
contacted her, and organised from our now somewhat larger pool of
available eople to help her. Don, the one who did, went over and above
duty in goignt here several times, bringing her hardware here. THREE of
us worked on it Dan, fixed any issues raised, benchtested it, and
returned it. Did she then say it wasnt working again? NO. Did we get a
thanks for it?

Nope - but I can live with that.

I cant quite understabnd why you didnt approach us directly instead of
emailing a list. It seems you wish to badmouth rather than find a
solution. Im incredibly insulted by that.Im not insulted for ME, but for
all the people who put in so much!!!!

 Our volunteers are an amazing bunch who put in long unpaid hours to
help people. Instead of griping about us, try putting in to help us -
then maybe you will have a bit more respect for what we do.

Your friend is the ONLY complaint we have had in several years of trying
to help people. Yes, its second hand hardware - we make that clear. Its
also FREE, and theirs. 


&gt; 
&gt; After having got the machine to work for her, I find that the kernel 
&gt; running on the machine is 2.4.17 (notoriously buggy), the /etc/fstab entry
&gt; for the cdrom is broken and that KDE is a manky piece of crap (sorry to
&gt; delve into religion here, but why put on an environment that doesn't work
&gt; - my first experience with KDE (3.0.2) was finding the KMail is broken,
&gt; KSpread can't export to Excel (work requirement) and though it says it
&gt; can export to gnumeric, that fails). This really throws an insult at the
&gt; strengths of the underlying system (Debian GNU/Linux). Is providing flakey
&gt; (at best) software in these components likely to enable a computer (and
&gt; most proably a Linux) neophyte to use the machine, given that it takes a
&gt; degree of Linux awareness at least to fix or understand the issues
&gt; involved - I think not.

She got the build that was available and reasonably current and tested
at the time. I would have given OpenOffice if we had had hardware to
support such a beast - we didnt. The kernel issue - well, I ran the
install myself until recently, now I am running the new install, testing
it for bugs. Do you know, again, we have NEVER had a complaint.  A few
swapping to windows, always for games or specific sofwtare - their
choice. Many many positive supportive comments.
And you were obviously able to put an alternative os on, werent you?
Approach us to see if we have any later version? Upgrade anything for
her? No, gripe instead.

&gt; 
&gt; What I find myself asking is: What function does Computerbank play in
&gt; South Australia? Is it to provide functional computers to those in need
&gt; and who are in most probability not highly computer literate? Is it to act
&gt; in some degree as a Linux advocacy group? I would have to say that
&gt; Computerbank's efforts fail abysmally in both regards in the experience
&gt; that I have had with it through my friend.

Well, Dan, pity you didnt try experiencing us directly. Pity you emailed
a list instead of approaching us. Pity we cant give bleeding edge
sofwtare and hardware to everyone. Pity we arent mind readers, and
provide 24 hr support BEFORE we are informed of a problem.

Christ Im glad im not branch coord anymore - I might try to be tactful.
But im too bloody angry that we have been so damned maligned without you
even ATTEMPTING to give us a shot at this. If the problems were
continuing, we would have swapped her hardware AGAIN - oh yes, she had
newer and upgraded cpu and motherboard, newer sound, newer video, newer
ext modem by the time we finished last time, but no, we didnt try, did
we?

Try asking us next time, ok? Then you'll see why we have such a good
reputation among the huge majority of those who encounter us. Tell your
friend she is welcome to contact us, either directly, or through you, to
fix her problems - we ARENT heartless, and we persist till a problem is
solved. In our own, unpaid, uncared about time.

And you are welcome to volunteer:)
