&gt; Simple economics really. Do remember that Telstra are trying ever so
&gt; hard to get their share price up.

and this is the major problem with a privatised telstra as opposed
to telstra being treated the same as water, electricity etc
should be (ie. as a public utility and not expected to make a
profit, public transport is another one) but anyway...

[snip stats]
&gt; This means that the total broadband marketplace for Hahndorf at the
&gt; moment is 20-40 people. Telstra probably have even better statistics
&gt; based on profiling the phone bills of people in the area vs those with
&gt; high broadband uptake. The same council stats suggest that Nairne would
&gt;  probably be a better candidate for getting DSL if you're going to
&gt; enable  marginal areas.

yeah but hopefully telstra haven't worked all that out, cos I'm
trying to convince them to upgrade the Scott Creek "exchange"
to support adsl (using "exchange" in it's loosest sense here,
it's basically a converted shipping container).

most of the hills have no adsl, exceptions being the main parts of
Mt Barker and Stirling/Aldgate.
