&gt;I ran it for the last 6 months or so. Done several builds and loved it.
&gt;Brilliant, bloody brilliant. Good for learning too. Highly recommended.
&gt;
&gt;I have recently switched to Gentoo however, simply because I haven't got
&gt;the time anymore.
&gt;
&gt;But if you have the time, I highly recommend it. Hell even if you don't,
&gt;build it on a seperate partition over as long as you like just for the
&gt;experience :)
&gt;
&gt;Depending on how much you know beforehand, it will help quite a bit with
&gt;troubleshooting packages etc.
&gt;
&gt;Also, the LFS IRC channel is full of people screaming RTFM at you, for
&gt;when you really need help :P
&gt;
&gt;Seriously though, they're quite helpful, so long as you've searched the
&gt;mailing list archives, man's etc...
&gt;
&gt;Best of luck
&gt;Daniel.

Yeah I have been running it now for about 2 years now and I love it.  
Although I do have the time and all but I still get a bit irritated at 
developers making crap code and not documented well enough, and then 
making an RPM and using that as the piece of code "manual" so to speak.  
I have ran into alot of code like that so far.  I don't like auditing 
someone else's code.  Other than that I agree with you that it is an 
extremely good learning "tool" for understanding how linux works.
