&gt; Simple economics really. Do remember that Telstra are trying ever so
&gt; hard to get their share price up.
&gt;
&gt; Approximately 1-2% of Australians have broadband connections.

&gt;.htm shows that Hahndorf is home to roughly 2000 people, and the
&gt; exchange doesn't have the benefit of servicing multiple suburbs.
&gt;
&gt; This means that the total broadband marketplace for Hahndorf at the
&gt; moment is 20-40 people. Telstra probably have even better statistics
&gt; based on profiling the phone bills of people in the area vs those
&gt; with high broadband uptake. The same council stats suggest that
&gt; Nairne would probably be a better candidate for getting DSL if you're
&gt; going to enable marginal areas.

Actually, the number of potential sites in Hahndorf would be 
considerable greater than the 20-40 people you state.  This would 
probably cover the residential population (there is a high internet 
connectivity in Hahndorf).  However, on top of this is the relative 
large number of small and medium businesses who would be looking for 
better connections.  The potential I would consider to be more in the 
100-150 range at least.
