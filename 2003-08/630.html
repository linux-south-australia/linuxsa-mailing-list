&gt; Not so.  It should not have died and did not die.  It's still the best
&gt; software development editor I know of.  

EMACS rocks compared to ludwig.  As soon as we were allowed to use emacs at 
uni we ditched ludwig in minutes.  It is/was limited, buggy, "/" driven.  VI 
was easier to figure out.  I'm still wierded out by the idea that my honours 
thesis sits in the same room as Ludwig source code, it's creepy.

&gt; Someone on this list recently ported it to linux.  In the last two weeks
&gt; or so, I've written 6407 lines of software with ludwig.  On two days, I
&gt; wrote about 1000 lines on each day.  There's no way I could do that with
&gt; other editors that I know of.  (This is all user-space GTK+ software,
&gt; which is fairly repetitive in some respects.  Writing in the kernel
&gt; doesn't go that fast...)

No offense AK, I'm not sure what this says about you but DSTO did something
wierd to your head.  

&gt; If ludwig had been open-sourced 10 years ago, emacs awould be in the
&gt; dustbin of history by now, along with "ex" and the "infamous mister
&gt; ed", as "ed" used to be known. 

&lt;rotfl&gt;  In what universe?  The world has moved on.  A lot.

&gt; If only it hadn't been written in Pascal. But then, what else was there on
&gt; a VMS machine in the 1970s? You can't write a decent editor in fortran,
&gt; can you?

And now, 30 odd years on ... 

&gt; Hmmm. Thinks... Maybe I should learn all the vim commands and see if it
&gt; can be used for serious development....

VIM for devel? Hmm - if I still did development then I'd go back to using 
EMACS.

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; ak.
