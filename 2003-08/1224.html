&gt;if one we're not to tell the other end about such recording and then produce
&gt;these recordings as evidence in a court case or whatever, would that
&gt;consitute an act that is classed as criminal or whatever all those high
&gt;flying lawyers call it?
&gt;
This is the issue.  If you record WITHOUT informing the other party AND 
getting their agreement that you can, then you CANNOT use it in a court 
of law as evidence.

However, I don't see any particular issue with just asking.  If they 
don't wish to say something that they company won't commit to then they 
won't, but you're not worse off than you are now.

However, it is sufficient to take notes whilst talking to companies.  
Write down the necessary details:
- when the call was made
- who you were talking to
- what question you asked
- verbatim what they said. 

Keep these notes filled with your policy.  If anything goes wrong you'll 
have the detail you need.  Recording it isn't necessarily anymore helpful.

[Yeah, I've had issues with Insurance companies.  Least trustful 
industry in the world]
