&gt; &gt; It's the tyranny of the majority, or the powerful, or influential. 
&gt; &gt; However you look at it, it's tyranny, and if you don't 
&gt; agree with it, 
&gt; &gt; you must resist in whatever way you are able.
&gt; 
&gt; Obviously. There's a well worked case that the United States 
&gt; of America and some of its allies have oppressed the Islamic 
&gt; world to the extent where terrorism (by flying planes into 
&gt; buildings, bombing night clubs or attempting to make hotels 
&gt; collapse) is the "only" way out.

Yes... I subscribe to that view.

&gt; Is this the only way that these people are able to make their 
&gt; point? What about all the people in Australia and worldwide 
&gt; who went to peaceful, legal protests to attempt to stop this 
&gt; from happening?

And how useful was that? Did it have *any* effect? No.

&gt; One only needs about 10% of the population to mobilise, unite 
&gt; and work within the legal system legally to make the system 
&gt; change. Only 1 in 10 people. Remember that.

Which explains how we managed to have the biggest ever protests (~300,000 in
Sydney, 200,000 in Melbourne, &gt;1,000,000 in London, ~20,000,000 people
worldwide) against the war, none of which had any effect whatsoever on the
fact that we still went to war. We had near 10% of the entire population of
Australia out, on the streets, protesting, and what effect did it have?
None. We had opinion polls with well over 50% of the population against the
war (from memory, it was over 60%), but what effect did that have? None.
Even when you have a majority voicing their views against what the powerful
want, it has no effect -- your Government rides roughshod over your views,
whether you are in the majority or not. Remember that.

&lt;snip (whatever)&gt;

&gt; Patent law is troublesome but the original reason for its 
&gt; creation was never so that large or small companies could use 
&gt; it as an offensive weapon against each other. I think it's 
&gt; important to make this point without advocating the wilful 
&gt; disregard of the current patent law.

I think wifully disregarding it disarms them, and I am for disarmament.
