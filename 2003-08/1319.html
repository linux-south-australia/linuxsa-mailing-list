&gt;In the news-of-the-strange category I present multiple reports that Windows Update is now running on Linux to protect the service from the MSBlaster worm. That story would be so awesome if only it were true. Sadly, the truth--as always--is a bit less sensational. A quick visit to the Netcraft Web site shows that <A HREF="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</A> is running the curious combination of the Linux OS and the Microsoft IIS Web server, leading to wild speculation. The simple truth is that Microsoft has redirected the <A HREF="http://windowsupdate.com">http://windowsupdate.com</A> URL to <A HREF="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com,">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com,</A> as previously reported.

There are layers within layers at work here.

windowsupdate.com is directed via linux systems and akamai dns on linux 
to servers running .NET services.

Curiously, even though akamai have an international distributed network, 
the ip addresses of the many hosts returned by repeated lookups of 
www.windowsupdate.com all appear to be outside of Australia.

As I've mentioned on linuxsa before, Akamai have a product that runs a 
windows operating system to do distributed .NET, although it is not as 
widely deployed as their linux systems (and probably doesn't need to be 
given the bandwidth requirements are smaller). This may or may not be 
the system that windows update uses to determine which of the many 
patches your system needs.

Then once windowsupdate has a list of files, it goes back to the 
linux-based Akamai servers to download the required patches. Try doing a 
netstat while windows update is downloading, you'll probably see the 
*.akamaitechnologies.com hostnames that trace to a nearby ISP - and note 
that port 22 responds with something like SSH-1.5-AKAMAI-I which is 
probably a linux system.

In summary, Microsoft based servers do the thinking and logic part of 
the process (you wouldn't really expect Microsoft to go out of their way 
and code for perl/php for linux, would you?) and Linux handles the grunt 
work.
