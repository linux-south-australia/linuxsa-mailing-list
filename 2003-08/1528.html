David,

Perhaps I should add some detail to what prompted me to write something
about the particular posting in question.
I was not concerned entirely with etiquette.
It's a question of security too. Or a combination of etiquette and security.

Some linux software, e.g. acroread:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/gentoo_advisory-3399.html">http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/gentoo_advisory-3399.html</A>
has local vulnerabilities. But these vulnerabilities become remote
vulnerabilities if someone can convince you to click on a link which
does a Refresh or redirection to a file containing an exploit.

Now how many linuxSA people have fixed the above acroread vulnerability?
How many linuxSA people have their browser configured to jump straight
into acroread if they see a PDF file?
Are there exploits of this particular bug out there in netland?
Are there scripts which can automatically subscribe to mailing lists
and send bogus mails redirecting people to URLs containing exploits?
And are there other file-reader vulnerabilities apart from acroread one?

Well, if you put this background together with the appearance of the posting,
which now clearly was sent by a human, there are some unusual things --

-	the user's e-mail address never appeared on the list before
-	it doesn't look like an Australian e-mail address
-	the username looks like hacker slang-spelling for "track a bet"
-	there's a full, complex URL in the subject line, which is
	unusual for linuxSA posters
-	the URL is PHP, which is not a strong reason for suspicion, I admit
-	the e-mail domain name has mixed lower and upper case; this kind of
	fiddling with cases is also a characteristic of the hacker community
-	the author does not give a personal name or pseudonym in the posting
-	the posting looks similar to various worms of the last 2 years,
	in that it's just "hey, have a look at this".
-	the e-mail arrives in the middle of the night, Adelaide time
-	the e-mail headers have no "User Agent" indication
-	there is no reference to any discussion on the list

I put all of these together and felt obliged to post some sort of message.
Even if the message was not bogus, it aroused a lot of suspicion in my mind.
It's a bit like someone walking into your kitchen without warning and
saying "boo". It may be innocent, but it's more friendly to give other
people reasons to be relaxed and comfortable.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
