Mark,

&gt; I'd contend that Con is absolutely correct:  The launch times have
&gt; been mostly removed as a problem in OOo 1.1.

You could make OpenOffice load 300% faster than its release 1.1 and it
would still be slow...its loadup time might be faster. But it's not fast
enough for me to decide it's "faster"...

&gt; So, apart from that, what do you think is tardy about it?  Anything?

Ummmm...it starts slow. Its first impression is crap because of that.

Things that are good:

 * it appears to have removed its dependency on its own crappy widget
set

 * it seems to pickup sane fonts that antialias well

One shouldn't get me wrong: I use OpenOffice. I get into a heap of SHIT
because I send stuff in OpenOffice format because morons from
Computerbank can't work out how to render it.

OpenOffice is good.

But our CUSTOMERS (the people who matter) still complain it's slow
regardless of what version I show them.

Internode's customers might be different...
