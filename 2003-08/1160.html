Actually I think you've happened upon a few good points. The only point I
would take issue with is Microsoft (or Microsoft users) having no beef with
Linux and being less likely to exploit security holes. I would think the
opposite was the case here and would surmise that the reason we don't see
Linux's security holes spotlighted enough is partly due to there possibly
being slightly less of them and also because the ones that are there are
maybe not quite as catastrophic.

Mind you, your point about the *.nix culture is right on the money. I find
the biggest enemy to my finding out more about Linux etc. is the
confrontational attitude of quite a few *.nix users online. Okay it forced
me to go buy some books but sometimes, the biggest enemy is the geeks who
want to preserve that which they see as being uniquely 'theirs'. I found the
*.BSD communities to be the worst in this sort of caper and quite frankly,
it goes part of the way to explaining why Linux may not be taken up by
newbies so easily; it's discouraging to be confronted with some geek who
probably hasn't seen sunlight in a week saying to you "Oh, so you're a Red
Hat (L)user. Why don't you try some REAL Unix like [insert generaic Unix
product here]." I mean, the geek community complains loudly that everyone
who doesn't use their choice is an idiot so but when people want to try,
take a wild guess where their biggest opposition comes from.......

Incidentally, none of what I've said there actually applies to anyone I've
met/talked to at LinuxSA. Surprising, but pleasantly so. Well, Nathan gave
me some jib for logging in as root all the time (yes I know I KNOW that you
shouldn't do that but I was an extreme newbie at the time and if anyone
wants to lecture me on it, they can go see my complaints department in the
lavatory and write their complaints on my official complaints 'paper').

Let's look at an analogy.

With all the devastation that is going on in the world, lets take the 
example of a terrorist from Afghanistan. Now, that terrorist is set on 
bringing down everything that western society stands for. So, that terrorist

creates bombs, attacks, hijacks, to bring down that western society. Let's 
look at western society - they're happy with what they have got, there is no

strict rules to live their lives by, and they want to keep it all simple.

Now let's bring this analogy to light. Whilst I am not suggesting that Linux

users are terrorists by any means, they are probably the ones that are 
exploiting the holes in all of Microsoft's systems, resulting in them 
finding thousands. Microsoft (western society) is happy with something that 
is easy to use, and doesn't require a degree in rocket science to 
understand. They have got no beef with trying to exploit the holes in Linux,

resulting in 'not many' being found.

I come from a Microsoft background, and am TRYING very hard to get my head 
around Linux. I'm a smart guy, and I pick things up quickly, but one of the 
problems is getting use to Linux culture. You're all very good at what you 
do and can often talk in a language that you think people like me 
understand. However, this is not always the case.

I hope no one has taken offense to this, as it was not my intention.

Luke
