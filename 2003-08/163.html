&gt; &gt;&gt;What hardware are you talking about? It's not fast to load on my
&gt; &gt;&gt;500mhz laptop, but it isn't minutes either. Most people running MS
&gt; &gt;&gt;office are unaware that it is pre-loaded, so to be apples and apples,
&gt; &gt;&gt;openoffice should be preloaded for most users. To do otherwise is to
&gt; &gt;&gt;invite unfair critism.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;By default it's not.
&gt; 
&gt; And can't be.  Not with a 50MB footprint :-(

When someone DL's it from the net, and we have no idea that he's trying
to run it on a 486 with 32mb, of course the default has to be
quickstarter off.

But when Microbits sells their shiny new PC with DavidL-Linux or
whatever they call it installed, and they have given it adequate memory,
and the response from customers is that 'OO is way slow, because it
takes ages to start', Why not?

&gt; 
&gt; I use OpenOffice a lot.  I started off thinking it was good,
&gt; but now the more I use it the more I think it sucks.  That's
&gt; probably because my expectations have changed -- I no longer
&gt; use OO just for viewing MS-originated documents, but for
&gt; real work.

[..]
&gt; 
&gt; I thought Calc was OK.  Then I tried to load the Cisco
&gt; price list.  Can't be done, Calc doesn't support that
&gt; many rows.  Why not -- UNIX has a decent memory model.

Yes. Also, the importing of a plain text file works well, but you have
to fish around to find it and make it import as csv or tab delim data
into calc, unlike excel which just works with no fuss. If you just
File--&gt;Open it, you land up in a word processing document...

[..]
&gt; 
&gt; In summary, OO is a nice MS Office clone.  But that's all
&gt; it is at the moment.  This might change (and the work
&gt; by the database and bibliography people in aiming to do
&gt; better than MS is promising).

Here's hoping... :)
