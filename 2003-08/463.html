&gt; I tried the Redhat updates thing (under subscription).  It was handy and
&gt; easy, but in the end I couldn't see the value.  Now, I just regularly
&gt; (say, monthly or when I can be bothered) grab all new updates from the
&gt; internode mirror (costs me nothing), whack them all in the same
&gt; directory (minus a few, such as kernel packages, which I'd do
&gt; separately) and run `rpm -Fvh *` in that directory.  This way only those
&gt; packages which are installed are updated, the rest of the rpms that I
&gt; don't need are left uninstalled.  Note that a little care is taken, I
&gt; don't just blindly update all, but it is IMHO just as easy as using the
&gt; redhat updates service, you have full control over your updates, and it
&gt; costs nothing.  New installations are just as easy.  Whack all required
&gt; packages in a directory and run `rpm -Uvh *` (as mentioned before), and
&gt; let rpm sort out the dependencies.  If outside packages are required,
&gt; grab the packages and throw them in the directory with the others, and
&gt; run `rpm -Uvh *` again until all deps are sorted out.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see the need for a meta packager.  Rpm is a good enough package
&gt; manager by itself, if used correctly.
&gt; 
&gt; That's just my 10c (... Inflation - I remember when an opinion was just
&gt; 2c ;).

I use the free demo version of the redhat network agent. All it costs is
filling out a survey form every 60 days. This allows me to regularly run
the following commands....

up2date -p ; up2date -u

That way my system is kept entirely in sync with all the latest redhat
errata updates and I only download and upgrade whatever packages I
already have installed so my poor old dialup isn't wasting bandwidth
with unnecessary and superfluous packages. Redhat even email me when new
errata packages are released so I'm never more than a few hours behind.

Another alternative is "apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade" which does the
same thing but is usually a day or two behind with errata updates.

But, I'm just lazy. What you suggest above may be just fine for you, but
seems like way too much work for me!

C'est la *nix! Open source means open choice!
