Steve,

A default Redhat install leaves a lot of services running, some Distro's may
be better or worse in this area, which of course means that out of the box
one distribution might be better than another... However the first two
things you should do to any system (Linux, Windows, whatever) before its
connected to the internet for the first time is shut down the services you
don't need and apply latest security patches to the services you do need.
I'd imagine that once you do that to any linux distribution they'd all be
pretty much alike in terms of security.

I've never had too many problems with Redhat security, my firewall _is_ a
RedHat box!

Jim.

Subject: security differences between linux distros


I had a chuckle with David Colebatch about placing a redhat machine 
directly onto the net and made comment that I always felt safer with redhat 
behind a dedicated firewall. That got me wondering, is there really any 
difference between distros, eg Debian, mandrake Suse etc etc.
I know that when i put redhat in it does appear somewhat bulky, but so is 
Suse. So is redhat really less secure as a general Linux OS or after 
firewalling thereâ€™s no difference. I know all about its what you make of 
it, but could it be that some are harder to secure than others and thats 
the difference..

I'd be interested to here what people think.


Steve D
