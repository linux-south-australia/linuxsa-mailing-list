Knoppix mounts detected hard drive partitions as read-only by default, 
if you want to write to them you have to re-mount them as read/write.
I think it give the option to do this from a right click on the (KDE) 
desktop. But there is still one gotcha, it won't give write access 
(quite sensible really) to NTFS partitions.

Cheers,
David Creed

&gt; Hey guys.
&gt; 
&gt; I've just given this a go and I must say I'm impressed. What does everyone
&gt; else think of having the ability to use Linux without an install? I myself
&gt; think it's great for promoting Linux to those who are frustrated with being
&gt; Microserfs and are considering a change. It's neat, has everything you'd
&gt; need and is just damn nifty!
&gt; 
&gt; One thing; I didn't get much of a chance to play with it but I noticed that
&gt; I couldn't write to my Windoze partition. Is that just a straight chmod or
&gt; does Knoppix actually prevent you from writing to a non ext2/ext3 partition?
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I noticed that on the front cover of APC this month, there's some
&gt; software to read EXT partitions in Windows. Does anyone think this nifty
&gt; little feature will appear in future Windows releases or do Microsoft have
&gt; too much pride for that? :-)
&gt; 
&gt; And one more for the chem-heads out there; I see that someone has advertised
&gt; a de-comissioned CSIRO Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) on Ebay.
&gt; I'm thinking of putting a bid on it!
