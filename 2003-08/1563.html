&gt; OK

&gt; 
&gt; Hello nice people, I hope you can assist in this situation.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a Box, next to me, it is supposed to be acting as a firewall.
&gt; 
&gt; It will not, or does not seem to configure.
&gt; 
&gt; It used to work ok, it worked rather well, till the other
&gt; pc next to me, the main one, which is XP Pro, it crashed!
&gt; Then I had to do a format C: but during the crash I had lost all the details pertaining to the firewall connections.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to do it on my own, but I realy do not understand what I am doing.
&gt; Have got IP numbers etc, did all the easy stuff, but the main area of concern is, it MUST log on during boot up.
&gt; 
&gt; So if there was to be a power failure, and the power came back,the pc's should actularly re-boot, and this is where it needs to log on, be online, to continue doing the work it is meant to do.
&gt; 
&gt; It has come to a point in time, where I must "get my hands" dirty so to speak, and figure this out.
&gt; 
&gt; It's bootd up, I can get to root and setup. I have already followed the instructions I have,twice and this does not seem to do the trick, yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this makes sense.
&gt; 
&gt; cheers

You haven't said what distribution of linux you're using, not that that
should matter too much.

<A HREF="http://qtables.radom.org">http://qtables.radom.org</A> is the home of the most moron friendly firewall
generating script around. Just unpack the tarball and run the
quicktables script, answer the questions, and it will produce a decent
firewall script you can then execute by doing...
chmod +x rc.firewall ; ./rc.firewall ; iptables-save

If you use redhat then quicktables has a contrib/redhat-install.sh to
install the chkconfig and quictables scripts into all the correct places
so that everything starts up properly on every boot.

Other distro's have different methods for starting their firewalls.
Please supply more detailed questions.
