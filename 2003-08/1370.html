Hi Robyn, let me clear up the waters for you. My sig is in part an attempt to 
highlight the ridiculous new copyright legislation that has been introduced 
that deals with forwarded email in Australia (a situation that does not apply 
to standard correspondence), normally my headers would include a fair use 
reproduction consent too, but I am currently forced to use a webmail client.

It has already been discussed that posting to a public forum such as LinuxSA 
probably implies permission to publish anyway, and the posts can be linked to 
by URL, so it becomes rather a non-issue.

On the second matter, my family originally came from Nazi occupied Europe after 
the war where my grandfather participated in the resistance. I am very worried 
that the actions of the Australian government (when it comes to human rights of 
refugees and Aboriginies, and the involvement in a post hoc justified invasion 
of a sovereign nation - with even the post hoc evidence being questionable) is 
acting in an entirely criminal manner. When people don't protest and 
participate in civil disobedience that are ligitimating these actions.

thanks and sorry to worry you.

Dan Kortschak

&gt; &gt; Responding with legal threats when public criticism is made is

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm quoting in full here because of a dubious comments in the sig of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dan's email.
&gt; 
&gt; To the writer of the secondhand comments about ComputerBank SA I made a
&gt; very thinly veiled 'threat', if you could call it that. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to investigate secondhand information being used in public
&gt; ranting by anyone and then that information being forwarded. Forwarded
&gt; in total? We don't know and forwarded to whom. The waters start to get
&gt; sullied.
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; Is a citizen subject to the laws of a criminal state? 
&gt; 
&gt; Comments like the above have always worried me.
&gt;
