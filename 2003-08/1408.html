Although I've long come to realize that the FreeBSD ports system is far 
superior to any other package management system I've used, it can 
perhaps be nicely summed up by my experience last night.

I obtained a new digital camera. Support for this camera has only 
recently become available in gphoto. On my freebsd system I pkg_deleted 
my existing gphoto packages, and did a make install in 
/usr/ports/graphics/gphoto2. (If I was more pro-active in keeping my 
installed packages up to date then even this wouldn't have been necessary).

I plugged the camera in and downloaded images off of it, first try.

I went home. Checked my redhat box for gphoto - it was installed but too 
old.

Had a look to see if Ximian Red Carpet knew about a newer version. It 
didn't, so I started hitting the web.

gphoto don't provide binary packages, nor do they provide links to 
people who do. Sighing somewhat at the prospect of tainting my system 
with non-RPM installed software, I downloaded the source.

I was heartened by finding an 'rpm' target in the configure generated 
makefile.

It didn't work. Why it didn't work was not clear.

I also found a spec file - tried rpmbuilding it, but it also failed. The 
reason was annoying - some sort of path specfication error somewhere 
made rpmbuild bomb out.

This was probably not beyond my ability to fix. However I was pretty 
fucked off with it by now. Don't forget - my FreeBSD machine had this up 
and running in just a few minutes.

So I bit the bullet and decided to do a make && make install. I got 
lucky this time. gphoto wasn't being depended on by anything important. 
I removed gphoto and it's dependencies and started compiling gphoto from 
scratch.

The problems weren't over yet. I still had to pissfart around with 
installing some other little oddball libraries to enable EXIF support. 
Of course there were no RPM's or even spec files for them either.

At the end of the day, upgrading software on Linux based systems has 
become a grade A pain in the ass. Lets examine what has to happen. A new 
version of some program comes out. The developers release the source. 
RPM packages follow. Generally a different one is needed for each 
distro, and they are ususally done by people with no actual relation to 
the project. As a result, binary packages take anywhere from a week to 
shortly before the second coming before they appear.

Compare to the FreeBSD ports system. Again the maintainers are typically 
not directly related to the software in question. However all they need 
to do is typically is update the ports Makefile, maybe update a patch 
file or two, and the job is over.

FreeBSD systems around the world get the new version skeleton very 
quickly, if they are keeping their ports up to date. The next release of 
FreeBSD will have the new software version in it 'out of the box'.

I keep hearing about projects to revamp the various package management 
systems that Linux uses. Something sure needs to be done. What a mess!

P.S. Debian users: Yes yours is better. Make no mistake - it still sucks
