Michael,

Your whole e-mail confirms 100% that in fact you _are_ dependent on
your distribution vendor.
That was my point precisely.
You end up being almost as dependent as the MS user who has to
twiddle their thumbs while they wait for the patches to the latest problems.

Of course, your distro vendor might be nice to you.
But then you become _dependent_.
Dependency is only painful when you try to break free.
That's when you pay the price.
I know for a fact that some big companies regard "de-skilling" the user as
a primary objective of marketing. They _want_ you to become dependent on them.

Linux was supposed to set us free, and yet we're being rounded up and
fenced in by the big distros bit by bit.
We are like innocent sheep grazing in the open meadows not noticing that
fence which is gradually being built around us on all sides.
A really good distribution would set you free to not have to get anything
from them ever again. You should be able to get by from the time of
purchase onwards by merely downloading the latest source for everything.

This is becoming more of an issue since distro prices generally jumped in
price from about A$50 to about A$150 a year or two ago.
Paying this money 2-3 times a year is certainly annoying, expecially when
things that used to work suddenly don't work on the new version of the
distribution. If you have 9 linux PCs at home like me, it's particularly
onerous. You don't notice it so much if you have just the one or two machines.
I sometimes just turn machines off for years because I can't afford the
time and energy to patch them for the last vulnerabilities.
Maybe developers shouldn't permit so many options in the "configure" scripts!!

Anyway....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. This is my list of the linux vulnerabilities which were significant
enough for me to worry about in the last 17 months:

Quite a big list really.
