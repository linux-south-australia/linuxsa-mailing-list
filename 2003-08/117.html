<H1>Browser 4 Workcover Konquerored (was "Re: Browser identity changes")</H1>

Hello all,

I've taken another look at this problem of accessing Workcover via browsers in 
linux and while not solving it for all browsers, seem to have done so in 
Konqueror.

I know that several linuxSAers suggested Konquorer and I did infact try, by 
entering the domain www.workcover.com in the Browser ID settings.  As we all 
know, this didn't work.

This evening I took a look at the source for the Workcover page and found 
that, while the link that was shown when passing the mouse over the "Complete 
the online reconciliation form" hyperlink was 
<A HREF="http://www.workcover.com/employers/levy/LevyReconciliation.htm">http://www.workcover.com/employers/levy/LevyReconciliation.htm</A>#, the actual 
page opened was https://forms.workcover.com etc.  Mmmm.  So entering this 
actual URL in the Konqueror settings did the trick.  Problem Konquored!

So where to from here ?

There's been talk in this thread along the lines of getting workcover to make 
the interface compatible for linux browsers and some hints also that this may 
be doomed, for a variety of reasons.  Maybe a way around the problem, in the 
short term, is to include a link within the page that is presented to those 
users who are identified as having incompatible browsers, along the lines of 
"linux users click here".

The link would bring up a popup menu with the following instructions:

	Linux users wishing to access forms at www.workcover.com should use the 
Konquorer web browser but must use the following settings in Konqueror:
	Click "Settings" menu and select "Configure Konqueror"
	Click "Browser Identification" in the LHS menu.
	Click "New" and add the text "forms.workcover.com"
	Select the identity "Mozilla/4.0 Compatible; MSIE5.5; Windows98)
	Click "OK" to accept the changes & "OK" again to close the configuration 
panel.

I wondered, David (DSL) if you'd mind contacting your friend in the IT section 
of Workcover and passing these suggestions on.  I could send them in myself, 
but I reckon there's more chance they'll be accepted if coming from someone 
such as yourself, who that person in Workcover actually knows.  Let me know 
if this is not OK and I'll be happy to send them myself.

Cheers all, and thankyou for your help.  Apologies to the several respondents 
who I didn't get to contact individually too!

Andrew Lord
