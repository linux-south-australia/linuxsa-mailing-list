&gt; &gt; What I would love to see is an Experienced Linux/Unix admin
&gt; &gt; and an Experienced Windows admin be given a budget to setup
&gt; &gt; systems for a given specification.
&gt;
&gt; Great idea, although initial setup is only one thing. Ongoing
&gt; maintenance is another factor which is generally more important. A
&gt; company looks at what it is going to totally cost overall, for a
&gt; specific period of time. You understand TCO right?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The spec shouldn't say anything about legacy file format
&gt; &gt; support, as that unfairly biases towards Windows.
&gt;
&gt; Err, mmm right....
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The spec should just say what sorts of
&gt; &gt; things the client wants to do.
&gt;
&gt; And then you say this??? So what exactly do you want?? You want to see a
&gt; comparision between operating systems and software on a non real world
&gt; basis, based on what you think a company should run... Anything to
&gt; client want so long as it doesn't need Windows or related software??
&gt;
&gt; If the client wants to run an access database, and say a Windows
&gt; specific contact management program, what are you going to suggest.
&gt;
&gt; For goodness sake in some circumstances what the clients
&gt; needs/wants/requires is what you have to be prepared to supply.
&gt;
&gt; After that work with them, and give them a clear road map of how porting
&gt; various systems and using various opensource solutions can help them
&gt; out.


What are you smoking? I'm talking about a hypothetical situation to examine 
the technical abilities of 2 operating systems + software to provide human 
beings with computing resources that they desire. In a real world situation 
one would have to worry about migration, supporting legacy software/file 
formats, etc - *obviously*.

It's like when examining phenomena in physics to determine relationships. 
Generally you take out real world concerns like friction, etc, because it 
becomes too complicated. Similarly, it would be *nice* to examine these 2 
OS's in a *hypothetical* situation starting with a clean slate - i.e. forget 
that MS has ruled the desktop world for more than a decade and measure the 
software's worth based purely on it's technical abilities.

&gt;
&gt; People need to think before they speak.

Yes. You should.
