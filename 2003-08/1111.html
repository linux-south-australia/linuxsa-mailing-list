Matt,

&gt; Googling around, it seems likely that there is a hard error on the disk
&gt; or possibly a file system problem. The file system is ext3 and is not
&gt; normally fscked at boot.

That shouldn't matter.

&gt; qn 1: i guess i should unmount and fsck this partition. however, should
&gt; i use a rescue disk to do this since /sbin/e2fsck is on the affected
&gt; partition? at the moment, the box has no floppy drive which will mean a
&gt; wander around to find a 2nd hand floppy.

A rescue disk would be better; you could use any boot disk that gave you
enough of a system to run an fsck, eg:

 * Debian
 * RedHat rescue mode
 * Mandrake
 * Knoppix

&gt; qn 2: assuming the filesyetem is ok, perhaps i can then low level format
&gt; the disk and mark bad sectors... but this is ugly as it means a
&gt; reinstall fromm scratch so maybe...

If you're really getting hard errors the disk is most likely really bad. I
wouldn't trust it...

&gt; qn 3: if the filesystem is ok, should i then assume the disk is a dud
&gt; for now and look to replace it? it is an old 2gig scsi disk - is it
&gt; possible to just 'dd' off the contents to another disk of similar
&gt; (larger in this case - 4 gig) size, mount the new disk in place of the
&gt; old and expect all data to be happily transferred and functional?

Yes, however dd won't be able to read the dead sectors :(

&gt; i guess after doing this i can then try the lowlevel format and mark bad
&gt; sectors on the error disk to have a backup disk for the next bad day?

Well, yes.

&gt;    <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-digest@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa-digest@linuxsa.org.au</A>
&gt; 
&gt; is the real address to post?

I don't know.

Ask "<A HREF="mailto:g@netcraft.com.au">g@netcraft.com.au</A>" really nicely and he may be able to help you there.
