&gt; &gt;&gt; No, but you might be able to track it down.  Try running
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;   stty &lt; /dev/pts/3 -a
&gt; &gt;&gt;
[...]

&gt; &gt; The problem nearly always occurs when doing an "ssh" from a workstation
&gt; &gt; to a server. There are two "pts" objects involved.
&gt; &gt; So which of the ttys should I monitor? Presumably both, I suppose.

Greg,

About that xterm/ssh/tail lock-up thing of 5 days ago, it recurred is it always
does, and I tried the stty -a on both the ssh client and the ssh server
machines, and everything was hunky-dory as far as parameters go.  I changed the
xterm window size on the ssh client machine, and both the "stty -a" outputs
showed the corresponding change in window dimensions:

<A HREF="mailto:akenning@dog">akenning@dog</A>&gt; stty &lt; /dev/pts/9 -a
speed 38400 baud; rows 36; columns 166; line = 0;
[...]

The rows and columns responded correctly.  So I assume this means that ssh is
passing through at least some control messages from the xterm window containing
the ssh client to the child process of sshd on the ssh server machine.

However, as usual, all control-Z, contorl-C, CR, and other input from the xterm
window did not reach the running "tail" process on the ssh server machine. The
output from "tail" continued as normal.

So then I did a "kill -15" on the "tail" process, and it dutifully died
and the tcsh process on the ssh server machine not only sprang back to life -
it also output all of the CR characters which I had sent in the meantime.
So my CR characters (or LF or whatever) must have been locked up in some
buffer somewhere, and that's why "tail" was not responding.

So I'm still mystified as to where the characters are being buffered, and how I
can re-start that buffer from the ssh client machine.  In this case, I had to
use a separate process in a separate xterm window to kill off the "tail"
process on the remote machine.

By the way, I always try control-Q in these situations, just in case I had
hit control-S by accident. So that's not the problem.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
