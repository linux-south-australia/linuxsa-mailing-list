&gt; Heh,
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Very Soon Now (tm), we will be releasing laptops with Microbits Debian
&gt; GNU/Linux installed on them with the option of software support.
&gt; 
&gt; We'll also be able to install other versions of Linux or FreeBSD on the
&gt; laptops but we won't be able to spend as much time in-house customising the
&gt; operating system for the laptops.
&gt; 
&gt; Good news is happening and I'll be releasing pricing as soon as the relevant
&gt; people have approved it.

Most laptop (and PC for that matter) vendors ship a CD of drivers for
their hardware. This makes little sense in many OSS cases. What you
could do is ship a CD with things like a kernel config and any
non-standard stuff (like the driver for the winmodem in a particular
model of laptop). You'd probably turn of most features and have
everything else as modules.

It's probably also worth your while to list exact chipsets are used in
the laptop, so that those of us who might not want Microbits' Debian
dist can evaluate whether that laptop will do what they want. Many
laptop manufacturers don't currently do that.

How will installing something other than your distro affect the
warranty? Will there be "it's a software problem, not hardware" answers
to most questions if I install Solaris, *BSD or even Windows on the
laptop?

I'd personally be very interested to see the pricing, specs and chipset
info when you release them :-)

thx,
Matt
