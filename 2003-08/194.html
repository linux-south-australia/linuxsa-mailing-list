&gt; They didn't revoke the old license for gated;  They released a new
&gt; version of gated under a new license and discontinued development
&gt; on the old;  And no open-source developers cared enough to pick up
&gt; the free project and run with it.

Hi Mark,

Deleting the mailing list and its archive made that a
big ask.  There wasn't the SourceForge-like community-
building sites that exist now.

There's also an issue of momentum.  Routing developments
only happen slowly, and it's not apparent for a number of
years when software development stops.  Then the job is
too big.

There was also complacency.  People weren't too concerned
at first, thinking that Merit and UMichigan had always
done the right thing in the past.  That's part of the
reason ISPs aren't too trusting of RADB and look to the
Regional Route Registies to provide IRR service too.

There's a worrying notion that a similar thing is happening
to Zebra, with all the newer routing protocols not being
open sourced, and changes to the mainline code which would
help other other developers perhaps not being applied.

Cheers,
Glen
