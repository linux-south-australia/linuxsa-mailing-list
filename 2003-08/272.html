 Red Hat's Mad Matt Vs. Humongous SCO Lawsuit 
 Daniel Lyons, 08.04.03, 6:00 PM ET 

 NEW YORK - It's a bit like the scene in Mad Max 2--The Road
 Warrior, where Mel Gibson and his clan of post-apocalyptic
 misfits finally get tired of being attacked and decide to
 turn the tables on The Humongous and his marauding leather-
 clad baddies. 

 Matthew Szulik, chief executive of Linux distributor Red
 Hat, says he's sick of the veiled threats that SCO Group has
 been making toward his clan of Linux brethren. So rather
 than wait for SCO to start suing Linux customers, Red Hat
 has launched a preemptive strike and sued SCO, charging the
 Lindon, Utah-based company with unfair and deceptive
 business practices. 

 "This is a march for freedom," Szulik says. "This is about a
 minority who are trying to hold the open source development
 community hostage. We had to step forward and say, enough is enough."
..
 "They've gone to our customers and business partners
 numerous times and have said publicly that Linux is
 infringing. We want the truth. We want them to stop engaging
 in unfair business practices. Basically what we're saying is
 put up or shut up," Szulik says. 

 Szulik figures his lawsuit, filed in Delaware, can move
 along more speedily than the SCO suit against IBM, which is
 slated for trial sometime in 2005. Rather than live under
 the shadow of SCO's allegations for two more years, he
 figures he can drag SCO into court now and make them prove
 their allegations.

and SCO responds...
"
 A second letter, dated Monday, to Szulik from SCO chief
 executive Darl McBride refers to a previous phone call that
 ended with an agreement to meet and discuss differences in
 person. McBride said he was surprised that Red Hat filed the
 legal action.

 "Of course, we will prepare our legal response as required
 by your complaint," McBride wrote. "Be advised that our
 response will likely include counterclaims for copyright
 infringement and conspiracy."

..talking about shares and how the market saw this posturing;
"
 SCO shares, which fell sharply in Monday trade, recovered
 before the Nasdaq close to end at $12.08, down 8.8 percent
 from Friday. Shares in Red Hat fell 3.8 percent to $6.65,
 also on the Nasdaq.

And to back up why it really is serious;
"
 "Everyone has seen through this," a SuSE spokesman says. 

 In other words, like many religious folk, the Linux-loving
 crunchies in the open-source movement are a) convinced of
 their own righteousness, and b) sure the whole world,
 including judges, will agree. 

 They should wake up. SCO may not be very good at making a
 profit by selling software. (Last year the company lost
 $24.9 million on sales of $64.2 million.) But it is very
 good at getting what it wants from other companies. And it
 has a tight circle of friends.
