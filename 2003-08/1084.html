if you are looking for a hardware internal modem I saw one at Dick Smith
all with a cute TUX logo on it saying that it was Linux compatable

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Many people, myself included, now use something other than a modem for
&gt; Internet connectivity. Many people, me included, dislike modems, and would
&gt; rather avoid them if we could. However, some people, me included, have the
&gt; need to occasionally dial in to a client's system to do something. This
&gt; could be because they only have a modem, or it could be for out-of-band
&gt; access to a console of some sort of device. 
&gt; 
&gt; Given that non-winmodems are hard to find, and that this need could be very
&gt; rare (or perhaps that occasionally, you may need to dial in to two places at
&gt; once), is it possible to get dial-out access to some modems somewhere?
&gt; Perhaps some now-unused modems at an ISP, maybe attached to a terminal
&gt; server like an Annex... This would mean that there could be a shell account,
&gt; highly restricted, of course, on some device, where you could ssh in, then
&gt; interface with one of a few modems, and make the call you need, without
&gt; needing to maintain a phone line or modem of your own. I would be prepared
&gt; to pay $5 or so per call I made, especially given that I would do so
&gt; extremely rarely. Anyone got any comments, ideas, problems, free advice,
&gt; grammatical corrections or email formatting issues with that? I am aware
&gt; that one would need to trust the entity running the terminal server and
&gt; modems, but am willing to do so...
