&gt; What "ctm".

If you don't know, don't worry. Look it up if you care.

&gt; apt is preinstalled by Debian. It's an essential package and it's difficult
&gt; to remove it. I agree that CVSUP isn't hard - it's just not installed by
&gt; default.

But you said, "updating ports without having CVSup looks horridly
complex". Which is irrelevant, since the answer is "don't do that, just 
install cvsup".

Some people might not want to care about keeping their ports up to date. 
Some people might want the box in a pure firewall role. In their case, 
they won't even have installed the ports collection at all.

If you do want to, install it. Either during install, later from 
sysinstall, or from the ports collection, or via pkg_add -r.

FreeBSD doesn't try to pretend it knows what you want better than you.
