&gt; &gt; IMHO that's the end of the argument.
&gt; &gt; I created it, I released it, I licensed it the way I wanted. If you
&gt; &gt; don't like the license then find some other codebase to work from. If
&gt; &gt; the licensing terms are such a problem then you could always write it
&gt; &gt; from scratch and then license it anyway you want.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Greed is the real enemy here and not the GPL.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Colin,
&gt; 
&gt; That sounds like a good argument - short and simple, so it must be right.

Not necessarily. But it gives a rough guide as to what I believe. 

&gt; But if I actually read what you've written, it all seems wrong.
&gt; [The following essayette is not attacking you personally, by the way.
&gt; I'm attacking the idea that individuals can own software or ideas.] 

Constructive criticism is fine.

&gt; The problem here is that everyone gets their ideas from everyone else.
&gt; We all live in a sea of ideas and benefit from them. There are very, very,
&gt; very, very few _new_ ideas which are _created_. We all just add one more
&gt; grain of sand to the Nullarbor Plains of human intellectual life.
&gt; We only _discover_ ideas which are there waiting to be discovered.
&gt; All of our ideas are minor variations and re-mixes of ideas that have gone
&gt; before. If you pick up a grain of sand and throw it onto a heap, then it
&gt; is "your" grain of sand that you "created" - not.
&gt; Almost all inventions are simultaneously discovered by many people. This is
&gt; because the ideas are just "in the air", ready to be discovered by the
&gt; natural process of inquiry and effort. If you don't invent an idea today,
&gt; someone else will invent it tomorrow or next week.
&gt; 
&gt; So the idea that "I created it" is preposterous. It shows the inherent
&gt; competitive individualism in the system. The idea that people can own ideas
&gt; is fostered by lawyers who make money out of defending property rights.

I understand where you are coming from. I was trying to put my take on
the subject in as few words as possible. IP laws are absolutely
preposterous and if we are really 'lucky'(personally I believe in karma)
the convergence of so many ridiculous lawsuits based around these ideas
at this point in time may help to defeat legislation that does nothing
but raise barriers to research and discovery (when I say research and
discovery I mean pure research and not the research that is motivated by
the desire for control and/or profit).
I think we are very lucky that these laws didn't exist when Grog banged
the shiny pebbles together.

To rephrase what I originally said.
If I spent my time and effort in creating something regardless of
whether it is a painting, a piece of music, some software, or what have
you and I release it to the world then I would not want what I have
freely given to be abused. If I feel I need to protect my efforts from
future predators/abusers then I will license it the way I see fit (that
may be GPL, BSD, or any other license that fits).
I don't think I have ever actually argued that one license is better
than the other. I just make the point that if it is my effort used to
create something then that effort should not be abused and I as the
creator have every right to say how my creation should be/not be
treated. 

&gt; In my opinion, everyone should give away all of their software because it
&gt; is only a logical corollary of what went before and owes more debt to
&gt; the past than the future will owe to it.
&gt; The GPL, and the intellectual "property" fantasy in general, perpetuates
&gt; the notion that people are independent individuals who create ideas out of
&gt; nothing.

I believe that all software whether free or commercial should be
released with it's source code because the user should have the right to
know exactly what it is doing and exactly how it is doing it.  

&gt; Although you espouse the GPL, you nevertheless cling very tightly to the
&gt; notion that software is individual property which you can control
&gt; under your conditions.

I strenuously object! :)

If I was to write some code for my own use and nobody elses then I would
definitely classify it as my personal property. If I released the code
into the wild then it is no longer my property, it belongs to the entire
world and nobody could ever convince me that by adding to that code they
then have some sort of superior rights to my original code over anybody
else in the world. 

If I was to write some great code that helped oil tankers to safely
navigate the oceans with pinpoint accuracy but could be modified as a
weapon targetting system then I would still release the code because of
the good it could do the world (re: the tankers) but I would definitely
include in the licensing terms and conditions that my code or
derivatives thereof (oh dear im infected with lawyerspeak) was not
available to be used for military purposes.

&gt; In my opinion, this means that you haven't come to terms with the
&gt; concept of the public domain.

I think you may have jumped the gun with that analysis.
&gt; 
&gt; An alternative point of view is to say:
&gt; Thousands of other people have laboured to build the tools so that I can
&gt; whip up a program or module or script. Therefore I am morally _obliged_
&gt; to give back in return as a sign of gratitude.

It's not an alternative point of view to mine. Not blowing my own
trumpet but I have donated time/effort and money(not much because I
haven't had full time work in over ten years now) to OSS because I
believe what you have stated above.

&gt;  
&gt; I see open/free licensing as a moral obligation, not as a weapon to 
&gt; destroy commercial software or force others to give me back something.
&gt; As in the philosophy in the Artistic Licence, the idea is to be generous,
&gt; with only the criterion that derived works should not harm the original
&gt; artist's reputation. As I understand it, BSD is even more generous than that.
&gt; If some poor person living on US$1/day modifies my code and earns a living 
&gt; from it, there will be no one more happy than me if they do.
&gt; That's not because I will have given them gift; it will be because
&gt; they have taken what's theirs already; and they will not have harmed me.
&gt; But I'm not going to put a means test on my software....

Would you have an objection if I took your code made some minor cosmetic
changes and then began to sell it to people who were unaware of it being
freely available to them and they were not informed of its free
availabilty (even to the extent of spreading FUD to stop them using the
freely available version)?

&gt; The real test of the GPL is:  Are there more generous options?
&gt; Not:  How can I stop other developers from gaining financially from my effort?

I wouldn't want to stop anyone profiting from or making a living from
what I have made available to the public domain(as I said above if I
thought that my work could be used in a bad way then I would make sure
that there were provisos in the license to stop this). If the person is
profiting then I would want them to have added 'real' value to the code
and to make their modifications available to the world at large also as
I have done with the code I have written to enable their activity.

It really boils down to I released it so I chose the licensing terms
when I release it (for whatever reason/ideology) and if someone in the
future comes along and decides that they don't like it for whatever
reason it's their problem and not mine.


&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.

PS: There are always three opinions on any subject

1: My Opinion
2: Your Opinion
3: The correct opinion which may be none of the above

PPS: If I can quote Dale Carnegie why does everyone still hate me?
