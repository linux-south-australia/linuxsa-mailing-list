....  This is why Citrix sells for $12K on TOP
&gt; of Windows 2000/2003 with TS CAL's and we have no problems selling that. 
&gt; Because your TCO (total cost of ownership) can be *substantially* lower.

Holy sweet crap! Citrix costs $12k?!?!?! You could have a cluster of 6 
Linux/X11 boxes with failover, load sharing, whatever for that price - 
Including the hardware! and OS!... TCO my ass! An experienced Linux/Unix 
admin, could *surely* implement something more effective/reliable for $12k 
_including_ hardware...  

How do you measure increased productivity anyway? Microsoft is the only 
benchmark.. how much does a few worms affect productivity? 

And Exchange is only for 3 years? Then it's pressure-time to upgrade I 
suppose...

What I would love to see is an Experienced Linux/Unix admin and an Experienced 
Windows admin be given a budget to setup systems for a given specification. 
The spec shouldn't say anything about legacy file format support, as that 
unfairly biases towards Windows. The spec should just say what sorts of 
things the client wants to do. Not all the budget has to be spent if it is 
not needed. 

It would be interesting to see how they turned out.

Anyhoo I'm neither a Unix nor a Windows admin, so I have no experience setting 
up either in a business situation. 

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; It all comes down to your attitude I suppose.  But if I show a client that
&gt; by implementing technology (whatever that technology is) I could save them
&gt; the equivalent of 1/2 or 1 FTE (full time employee) or increase their staff
&gt; productivity by 20 minutes a week (easily) it brings it into perspective.
&gt;
&gt; But this is a bit irrelevant - if we're talking 5 users who needed
&gt; collaboration I would sell them Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 which
&gt; has Windows 2000, Exchange 2000, ISA Server, Outlook, SQL Server 2000,
&gt; Shared Fax and 5 CAL's.  All for well under $2,400 (OEM - Microsoft code
&gt; E75-00650).  For the increased productivity it could provide it's superb
&gt; value at under $150 per user per year (assuming a 3 year life cycle).  But
&gt; now we're getting a little OT.  But remember - it's how you look at it.
&gt;
&gt; As I said before - I would gladly look at a Linux solution - but all the
&gt; ones I have looked at are far from mature - though some are very promising.
&gt;
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt;
