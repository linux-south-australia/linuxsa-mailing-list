Michael,

&gt; The point I'd like to make is that there's at least one "customer" of
&gt; Computerbank that is very disgruntled.

Obviously.

&gt; It's fine for you to disagree with his comments, but you should examine
&gt; them to see if you can do what you do better.

We have and we are. As I discussed informally with the LCA 2004 organising
committee last night, the outcome of this rather public rant about
ComputerBank SA Incorporated will affect all future recipients.

No longer can we afford to provide open ended, everlasting and friendly
support. Too much has this shown to us.

&gt; He *might* have valid concerns about customer service.  Or he may not. 
&gt; You should consider both possibilities.

Yes, he may have valid concerns about customer service. But LinuxSA isn't
the equivalent of the ComputerBank Consumer Affairs organisation ;-)
 
&gt; I support Computerbank (with my junk :-) but even volunteer-run
&gt; organisations need to listen to their customers, even if claims made are
&gt; not based in fact (and I'm not saying whether Dan's were or weren't).

Oh, we're listening. Of course we're listening.

For the information of those who may be interested, this little rant has
given me impetus to initiate the full policy review I have been threatening
to initiate for the past two months. The first policy, already under review,
is the period of support for hardware and software.

In the past, software support has been almost ongoing and relying on the
goodwill of the ComputerBank Volunteers. ComputerBank understands that
public lists such as LinuxSA can be daunting to its recipients and has, in
South Australia if not in our other branches, attempted to make Linux
undaunting to its recipients.

No longer, though, will this support be ongoing. Our Victorian sister
branch, who sometimes are wiser than us, implement a system whereby users
get FREE hardware and software support (unless the user lives a long way
from a specified location in which case the user needs to pay fair petrol
costs) for three months.

After that they pay per hour or part thereof.

*hmmmm*

I guess as ComputerBank in SA matures and the recipient lists grow longer we
would have had to have implemented a policy such as this at some stage.
