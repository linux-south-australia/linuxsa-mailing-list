We all have to make a living. I work mainly with Linux BTW and sometimes 
it can be slightly crappy too sometimes (just very slightly)

How many people on the list would say that *nix (server support, web 
programming etc) was the main component of their paid work?

I am curious what people in that category think is the best way to make 
a comfortable living in this business (apart from claiming you own linux 
and dumping your inflated stock).

Is there something we could/should be doing to collectively promote *nix 
techs. Apart from making us all get suits, haircuts and certifications 
that is ;-)

&gt; It's also worth mentioning that most of the people I know who make
&gt; their living from MS consulting agree that MS software is largely 
&gt; crap.  They're in it for the money, which might explain why they don't
&gt; offer the unpaid after-hours support on mailing lists like you get
&gt; here in the open source world.
