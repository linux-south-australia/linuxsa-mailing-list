OK
Is'nt this then ironic, you have a point in what you say, and next  I'll take that advice, but I don't think there will be a next time. I joined this mailing list yesterday after having a chat with techincians at my ISP's when paying the bill.
To me that posting should interpret someone's frustration at trying to set-up their home PC Firewall.

This person happens to be me. 

I have paid the price to charlatans and have allowed students to set up my firewall, but it's maintaining it and knowing my own.
I simply explained the step I did, according to the help files.

I have tried, honestly I have REALY tried to get the gif of this, but it seems the help files do not get up dated at the same time the updates occur on the sooftware. That was the first problem I encountered at yesterdays attempt. ( many many attempts)

The irony, just like I assumed you would klik on the URL to show what I had to go thru cos I wrote those posting at the same time I was attemting to initiate my Firewall.
Don't assume I already know it all , I don't.
Why am I asking? Remember the times you or anyone asked on the newbie phase. By "charlatans" I mean by one dude who took advantage of my situation, charged me 500.00 to install THE firewall, only to find out later, this person had full control on my internet activities from their own server!! PLUS wanted extra per month as a "security service"....yea, OK.... Would you pay ?

I did everthing the help files said, plus printed the sheet.
And now I am asking "the world", what do I do next?
It did not work, partly becuase the help files are not updated.

Instead of writing it all over again, I simply posted the URL of let's say the actual "bench test" of the forum where I got the help files from!

I to assumed you knew what that URL might be, just like many replies I have had in the past from expirienced Linux users, the writers of those replies, assume I already know what the heck they mean. 
SO, the moral is, can we get this FIREWALL of mine up and running, and use the forum to explain every step of the way, so the writers of help files can understand what it's like.


NEXT !

cheers

&gt; 
&gt; Is this link supposed to have some interest to someone somewhere?
&gt; It seems like the posting of this link could be a scam of some sort.
&gt; 
&gt; When people post links, it would be really great if they could give some
&gt; description of why they think it's worth doing a copy/paste/download
&gt; of the link. I know that most people do make the effort.
&gt; In this case, can anyone explain why this is _not_ a scam or exploit
&gt; of some sort?
&gt; Even if it is a genuine post, it's bad manners to post links without
&gt; explanation.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; ak.
