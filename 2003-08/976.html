I played with the St George solution awhile back and got it working from 
Debian/Unstable. They had the option of their own reskinable checkout, 
or an api you could use from your web server with your own code.

I tried the c api, binary only lib ;-( and got it working.

Lots of people seem to be pushing java or win32 apis, so I recommend you 
find someone with a serious commitment or at least a knowledge of Linux. 
A merchant account and online transactions are the way to go.

The problem with a lot of Australian banks seemed to be that they only 
took AUD, That might have changed. If you are pitching to a US audience 
that might scare them off.

I would much rather have my funds here in an Australian bank than with 
Paypal.

If I didn't want to go online transaction, or I had to keep numbers for 
some purpose (perhaps I needed to be able to rebill someone each month 
or something). I would probably gnupg the data and send it off the web 
server immediately. For the paranoid, decrypt offline, print to dead 
trees, and store under lock and key.

There seem to be a lot of inbetweens who will charge heaps for 
transactions. If you can put up with using a local bank, they are 
probably going to be much cheaper per transaction.

I don't know much about camtechs solution, but last I saw, they had a 
java wallet thing. I really,really hate java in my web browser.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Brendan,
&gt;&gt;Several things:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Talk to some banks.  You'll need a merchant account and ultimately
&gt;&gt;you'll have to play along with them.  Most of them now have online
&gt;&gt;transaction systems.  Camtech (where I used to work) offered an Ecommerce
&gt;&gt;system to do this, not sure of the current state.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Checking them out right now.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Second, WHY would you be storing the cc numbers?  Why wouldn't you be
&gt;&gt;sending the cc straight to the bank (eg. Westpac, NAB, etc all have
&gt;&gt;facilities for this) and then storing only an obscured pan (first 6, last
&gt; 
&gt; 4
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;digits) for verification?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, that's the thing. I wasn't even sure of how the whole process works if
&gt; you do it within your own site.. like checking for valid details, then
&gt; sending them to some third-party to process them, doing all this securely,
&gt; then getting the money back to me easily. Because the transactions will be
&gt; small i'm hoping it won't cost heaps. But yeah, i just contacted my bank, so
&gt; they should give me some more info.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers

&gt;&gt;&gt;G'day,
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;This isn't really Linux specific, but i'm sure there's some people here
&gt; 
&gt; with
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;experience in this area. What i want to do is allow credit card
&gt; 
&gt; transactions
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;on a planned site. I've looked at all the third-party credit card
&gt; 
&gt; handlers
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;like PayPal and WorldPay etc, but they all give that amateurish look to
&gt; 
&gt; a
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;site.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, the server will have some security i'd imagine, it's hosted at
&gt;&gt;&gt;rackshack.net. But what about storing credit card numbers? I doubt it's
&gt; 
&gt; a
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;good idea to store the details on the actual server. How would say
&gt;&gt;&gt;EverythingLinux do it? And then after all this i have to worry about
&gt; 
&gt; what to
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;do with them.. etc. And how to even get them back to me securely since
&gt; 
&gt; the
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;server is in the US.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually having second thoughts about it now. It'd probably cost me an
&gt; 
&gt; arm
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;and a leg to get a merchant account or whatever i need - infact anyone
&gt; 
&gt; have
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;more info on this, like how to debit credit cards etc, or getting them
&gt; 
&gt; to
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;like a bank to take care of them? Would i do this during the transaction
&gt; 
&gt; on
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;the website?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;I should probably buy a book on e-commerce or something..
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;If anyone can give me an outline of the whole process of doing it
&gt; 
&gt; yourself
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;etc then that'd be a big help - or if you know of a third-party that
&gt; 
&gt; handles
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;all this and allows it to be done securely still without having to exit
&gt; 
&gt; the
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt;website. I'd prefer an Australian one so i can simply get the money
&gt;&gt;&gt;transferred to a bank account.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Cheers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;Brendan
