&gt; Brendan,
&gt; Several things:
&gt;
&gt; Talk to some banks.  You'll need a merchant account and ultimately
&gt; you'll have to play along with them.  Most of them now have online
&gt; transaction systems.  Camtech (where I used to work) offered an Ecommerce
&gt; system to do this, not sure of the current state.

Checking them out right now.

&gt; Second, WHY would you be storing the cc numbers?  Why wouldn't you be
&gt; sending the cc straight to the bank (eg. Westpac, NAB, etc all have
&gt; facilities for this) and then storing only an obscured pan (first 6, last
4
&gt; digits) for verification?

Yeah, that's the thing. I wasn't even sure of how the whole process works if
you do it within your own site.. like checking for valid details, then
sending them to some third-party to process them, doing all this securely,
then getting the money back to me easily. Because the transactions will be
small i'm hoping it won't cost heaps. But yeah, i just contacted my bank, so
they should give me some more info.

Cheers

&gt; &gt; G'day,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This isn't really Linux specific, but i'm sure there's some people here
with
&gt; &gt; experience in this area. What i want to do is allow credit card
transactions
&gt; &gt; on a planned site. I've looked at all the third-party credit card
handlers
&gt; &gt; like PayPal and WorldPay etc, but they all give that amateurish look to
a
&gt; &gt; site.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, the server will have some security i'd imagine, it's hosted at
&gt; &gt; rackshack.net. But what about storing credit card numbers? I doubt it's
a
&gt; &gt; good idea to store the details on the actual server. How would say
&gt; &gt; EverythingLinux do it? And then after all this i have to worry about
what to
&gt; &gt; do with them.. etc. And how to even get them back to me securely since
the
&gt; &gt; server is in the US.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Actually having second thoughts about it now. It'd probably cost me an
arm
&gt; &gt; and a leg to get a merchant account or whatever i need - infact anyone
have
&gt; &gt; more info on this, like how to debit credit cards etc, or getting them
to
&gt; &gt; like a bank to take care of them? Would i do this during the transaction
on
&gt; &gt; the website?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I should probably buy a book on e-commerce or something..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone can give me an outline of the whole process of doing it
yourself
&gt; &gt; etc then that'd be a big help - or if you know of a third-party that
handles
&gt; &gt; all this and allows it to be done securely still without having to exit
the
&gt; &gt; website. I'd prefer an Australian one so i can simply get the money
&gt; &gt; transferred to a bank account.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Brendan
