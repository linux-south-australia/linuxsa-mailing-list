Luke,

&gt; I know very little about ADSL deals and connection problems.
&gt; How problematic is it?

It works out of the box.

&gt; If you do this deal, what are the problems getting it to work under Redhat
&gt; 9, if any?

Absolutely none. Because the modem is an ADSL/ROUTER it can do all the NAT
and Firewalling for you. You can also make it a "MODEM only" device and do
all the authentication, pppoe and stuff yourself.

&gt; How long do you have to wait for it to be activated (including having
&gt; your normal phone working)?

That depends on Telstra. I expected to wait for two weeks but it connected
in two days.

&gt; Are there any hidden costs, such as extra h/w (ethernet cards etc.)?

Not really - you do need a credit card though. The modem is both a USB and
Ethernet modem. If you're on dialup it could actually _save_ you money -
it's the main reason why I got ADSL.

&gt; Has anyone connected through adam ADSL with Redhat 9 and the below
&gt; suggested h/w (Billion) and plan, and what, if any, were the *perceived*
&gt; improvements in speed.

I use Debian, but because I've left the modem in router mode even Windows 2K
works out of the box. Scary.

&gt; I'd like to know more (obviously gotta move to *DSL someday),

I can tell you a lot about that star
