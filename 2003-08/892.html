<H1>mail/firewall gateway for extended power outages?</H1>

Just on the subject of the NY/Canada power outage, it occurred to me
that although the phone system is designed (at least it was before
semi-privatisation) for survival even in wars, and is powered by
a triple power supply (mains/batteries/generator), most people's
computers are not going to last 24 or 48 hours without mains power.
The phone will work but the computers won't.

A UPS will generally give up in an hour or so. The laptops will generally
give up in a couple of hours.

So maybe, just maybe, a linux PDA could be the solution. The idea would be
to have a large pack of batteries to keep a PDA going as a combined
firewall/router/mail-server. Then this could be the gateway for the
home network under normal circumstances, but during a long black-out, it
would be the only machine working. The idea would be that you could
send/receive text e-mails and browse the web to find out what's going on
out there. Right now, a lot of people in north-east america might be wishing
they had some such thing.

My questions are:
Is there anything obviously wrong with this idea?
And has anyone tried it?
And which kind of linux PDA would be best for this role?

The first thing that occurs to me is that linux PDAs might be set up as
single user mode machines. (I think I read this somewhere once.)
But that shouldn't make it impossible for the above gateway role.

When the big box of 48 batteries runs out, one could even resort to
recharging or powering with a bicycle, if one had such technology to hand.
But I don't plan to do that.

I'm just curious in casual sort of way. I don't want to start a riot....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
