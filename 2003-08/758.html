&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; The system breaks when individuals or classes decide to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; selective about what is lawful or not.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What sort of tripe is this? What if I want the system to 
&gt; break? Even 
&gt; &gt; if I didn't, surely *not* questioning the law is asking for fascism?
&gt; 
&gt; You have missed my point.
&gt; 
&gt; I am making the point that disregarding the law simply 
&gt; because one doesn't like it may not necessary be sensible, is 
&gt; almost certainly at some stage going to end up being illegal 
&gt; and is likely to encourage others to disobey laws one happens 
&gt; to agree with.

I think that that is sensible. I generally disobey laws that I have major
beefs with. Certainly, if I was Rosa Parks, I'd hope that I also would be
sitting at the front of the bus.

&gt; 
&gt; I'm not saying we shouldn't question the law.
&gt; 
&gt; In my opinion, people on this list are arguing not to my 
&gt; points but to other extraneous points simply because I happen 
&gt; to have a relatively logical, and almost certainly watertight case.

No, you don't. You are not reading emails on this topic, and are spouting
off on tangents of your own.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A) who gives a mouse poop if you call anyone anything, moronic, 
&gt; &gt; ignorant or unlawful?
&gt; 
&gt; They generally react either on list or off list. Trust me, 
&gt; they do care.

That's rather sad.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; B) is "unlawful" supposed to be a good or a bad thing?
&gt; 
&gt; Unlawful is just that. Unlawful. I suppose that murdering 
&gt; people is unlawful, but murdering someone we all as a class 
&gt; don't like is all right going by these arguments.

That is how it works, David. As a class of people, "Indonesia" seems to have
decided that they don't like Amrozi, so he's on death row... As a class of
people, "The Coalition of the Willing" decided that they don't like Saddam,
so we invaded Iraq... As a class of people, "Australia" seems to have
decided that refugees should be locked up like prisoners for three years or
so... etc. It's the tyranny of the majority, or the powerful, or
influential. However you look at it, it's tyranny, and if you don't agree
with it, you must resist in whatever way you are able.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; C) whose opposition to what awarding of what patent? I didn't think 
&gt; &gt; there was any awarding of any patent that was being 
&gt; discussed here. I 
&gt; &gt; thought there was a court case regarding the upholding of 
&gt; the claim a 
&gt; &gt; patent holder has over some idea that Microsoft was found 
&gt; to have used 
&gt; &gt; without licensing. People on /. appear to be opposing the decision 
&gt; &gt; made by the judge, because they believe software patents to 
&gt; be wrong. 
&gt; &gt; What is your problem with that?
&gt; 
&gt; The law is an ass and the original ideas in implementing 
&gt; patent law, in my opinion (and better expressed by Alan 
&gt; Kennington), should still be upheld. Which means--moderate 
&gt; that I happen to be politically (1)--that I'd prefer to see 
&gt; the law reformed not thrown out.

OK, that's your first valid opinion, different but equivalent to those being
expressed by others. Well done. :)
