Hmmmm....

&gt; With all the devastation that is going on in the world, lets take the
&gt; example of a terrorist from Afghanistan. Now, that terrorist is set on 
&gt; bringing down everything that western society stands for. So, that
&gt; terrorist creates bombs, attacks, hijacks, to bring down that western
&gt; society. Let's look at western society - they're happy with what they have
&gt; got, there is no strict rules to live their lives by, and they want to
&gt; keep it all simple.

I am going to invoke Lloyd's New Law (tm):

 "If they mention terrorists, the thread has ended!"

It runs in parallel with and augments Goodwin's Law.

&gt; I come from a Microsoft background, and am TRYING very hard to get my 
&gt; head around Linux. I'm a smart guy, and I pick things up quickly, but 
&gt; one of the problems is getting use to Linux culture.

You'll get used to us eventually.

&gt; You're all very good at what  you do and can often talk in a language 
&gt; that you think people like me understand. However, this is not always 
&gt; the case.

No offense taken at all, however if you don't happen to understand what I am
saying and don't tell me that you don't understand what I am saying then I
have no chance of restating what I have said in a way which is explicitly
more simple than the previous way in which I was saying what I was saying
which I think is what you are trying to say in the first place.

LOL
