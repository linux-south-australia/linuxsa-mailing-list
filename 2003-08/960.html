&gt; &gt; Does anyone here have any experience with Mini-ITX fanless 
&gt; &gt; motherboards and free O/S (I'm thinking Linux or *BSD 
&gt; here)?  I don't 
&gt; &gt; have any particularly special needs, apart from needing two network 
&gt; &gt; interfaces.
&gt; 
&gt; I know Richard Russell has used them (he may have one still).  I was 

Indeed, this is correct.

I have an AOpen MX36LE, with a VIA C3 running at either 700 or 800 MHz, in
an AOpen H300A case, with a spare H340 case. I was expermenting to find a
silent PC. The H3xx cases are small form factor, and need 2/3 height PCI
cards (though with many cards, you can actually use a normal one, but remove
the backing plate). I have 2 RTL8139 2/3 height cards (no-one else seemed to
make them in that size).

I removed the fan from the C3, which, depending on who you asked, was a good
or a bad idea. Via officially said that it required a fan, but unnofficially
said that it would run fine without a fan. I had it running Linux (sorcerer,
debian, redhat) and FreeBSD. For some reason I'm not too sure about, it
would randomly hang with increasing frequency under BSD, but not Linux.
Certainly, I was able to compile entire OSes (sorcerer, FreeBSD) with the
temperature remaining in the low 50s, so I feel as if the hangs weren't heat
related.

Other things I noticed about the C3 were that it's slow. Theoretically, it's
supposed to have equal or better integer performance than similar clockspeed
intels, and about 75% of the floating point. I think these are
overestimates. It massively underperformed my 1GHz PIII laptop, at least,
that's how it was feeling. I think they overestimate their performance
somewhat. However, this is a very early C3, from when they had only just
come out, so they might have improved significantly since...
