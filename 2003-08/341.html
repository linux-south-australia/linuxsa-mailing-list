&gt; &gt; Angus,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't doubt that that will happen, but I don't like the idea -- it's
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;merely destructive.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Why?
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Well, it would tend to reinforce the stereotype that Linux users are 
&gt; &gt;&gt;(naughty, teenage, unprofessional, pimply, unlawful, etc) 'hackers' (I 
&gt; &gt;&gt;trust you understand the context in which I use this  ;-)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I disagree.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; We are mature, generally law abiding citizens who all happened to be
&gt; &gt; concerned about the licence we are being asked to pay for. Hence we just
&gt; &gt; happened to want to look at it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the same time.
&gt; 
&gt; We're probably all savvy enough to see that it doesn't quite add up. 
&gt; The court process is only five months old yet they have on their website 
&gt; offerings for licences. (?) They seem like the ultimate optimists.  I'd 
&gt; like to know how well SCO has been performing in the market place 
&gt; because linux has had no influence on their performance or financial 
&gt; position.  Linux doesn't compete with SCO/unix yet even if their claims 
&gt; were true.

Moreover, there seems to be a lot of confusion here. What I have seen says 
they are offering licences for USD699 to businesses, not to individuals 
who use it personally or on a hobby basis.

However, I still don't think they will prevail.
