Interesting - I really doubt many MS organisations will move to anything
away from exchange.

Even with ALL the obvious alternatives there are still pea brained admins
who can barely spel MS (yes the abreviation) and who take for gospel
someone selling MS solutions as better than open source. Why? Because they
have barely moved up from Windows 3.0 and feel MS products are better
products. 

The latest POS to grace my work is MS ISA server ffs it's a firewall that I
can run on a floppy and a web proxy which I am running on a 300 mb hdd with
Linux. Does it do anything else? probably but who can figure it out?
But you guessed it $7000 later for a p3 with it on and yes we are nice and
safe. When we were nice and safe running a linux firewall (on a p1) and we
already had a proxy cache. 

But MS offer SW Assurance ie a license to print money - you keep paying
them for the use of the software and they keep giving you a new version for
less (not sure how much) when it's released. 

So even if we find BETTER alternatives and ram it down peoples throats they
will still only see MS.

No we will never escape the MS ball and chain even if someone came out with
an IDENTICAL product and tried to give it away.

sorry but it has really got to me lately

&gt;JiCal is one answer to that perennial question: 
&gt;“How does Linux replace MS Exchange's calendaring and scheduling
features?“
&gt;The JiCal answer is:
&gt;“USE XIMIAN EVOLUTION OR MOZILLA CALENDAR ON YOUR LINUX DESKTOP AND
JICAL TO 
&gt;PUBLISH FREE/BUSY TIME TO YOUR WEBSERVER. THIS WILL GIVE YOU SCHEDULING 
&gt;CAPABILITIES SIMILAR TO EXCHANGE SERVER BUT USING OPEN STANDARDS BASED ON 
&gt;RFC2445.“
&gt;
&gt;btw, evolution synchs my palm better than any application, including kpilot 
&gt;and jpilot etc....
&gt;
&gt;anyway, still pursuing such answers as solutions for group scheduling
without 
&gt;exchange servers:)
