OK
I need a  firewall, with a dashboard.

Not a rocket science degree.


What has Ettiquete got to do with it ?

Was it Ettiquete for the dude that ripped me off  500, only to find this dude had some form of control on MY firewall ?
Ya know? Understand where I am coming from.


AND, I will pay 500 again,but to be taught and run through the process, once and for all, then I am outta here.
I got others thing to take care off.


But while I am at it, to show my aprreciation, the idea is to actualy spell out in a public forum/s the exact nature of this expireince. Cos sooner or later you's are going to have an avalance of newbies like me, getting dsl connected, and finding sooner or later like I have, they gonna need  the seperate box for their f/w set-ups to!
I assume the same question/s will get asked over and over and over again.


I don't see why one is judged on Ettiquete in a learning forum.

It's just the way it is dude.

&gt; Hmmmm....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I to assumed you knew what that URL might be, just like many replies I
&gt; &gt; have had in the past from expirienced Linux users, the writers of
&gt; &gt; those replies, assume I already know what the heck they mean. SO, the
&gt; &gt; moral is, can we get this FIREWALL of mine up and running, and use the
&gt; &gt; forum to explain every step of the way, so the writers of help files
&gt; &gt; can understand what it's like.
&gt; 
&gt; Being a member of an online community is like being a member of any
&gt; online community. You need to:
&gt; 
&gt;  1) Observe the rules
&gt;  2) See (2)
&gt; 
&gt; How the rules are set and who sets them is generally a community type
&gt; thing. In LinuxSA there are few more aged (in terms of list
&gt; participation) than Alan Kennington who has done so, in a very positive
&gt; manner, for the past 5 years and more.
&gt; 
&gt; You didn't post any explanation of what you wrote.
&gt; 
&gt; You didn't have to retype it again (unless you have no idea how to cut
&gt; and paste - possible I suppose).
&gt; 
&gt; What's your problem with people pointing out that posting URL's with
&gt; little explanation is pointless? Seriously, the 14th topic means
&gt; absolutely nothing to me :(
