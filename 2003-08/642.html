Shaun,
You are right however, I knew you would relpy so I wrote "much of which is ..
junk.."
The non-coding DNA is probably recognised by the coded proteins which in turn
has an influence on regulation of proteins.  

Every time a cell divides a bit of DNA is deleted off the end of chromosomes to
keep count so the cell knows when to suicide, making room for the newer less
cancer prone cells to take its place.  This is where animal cloning has had
trouble, old cells with the clock already running, used to grow apparently
young animals.  

Cheers
Martin

Hi,

&gt; I shouldn't take the bait but... The statement that we share 97% of our DNA
&gt; with chimps therefore blah blah ...  demonstrates the author is over dramatic
&gt; or an idiot.  Of the ~3.2 billion base pairs of DNA in humans less than 5% is
&gt; coding the remainder is non-coding (much of which is evolutionarily obsolete
&gt; junk).  

The so called 'junk' DNA is now thought to be something other than 'junk'.

Assuming chimps & humans are closely related & the difference between
&gt; us is within that 5% of genetically active DNA, we would only really share
40%
&gt; etc etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Each human being is 99.9 percent identical to every other human being, in
terms
&gt; of DNA.  But the 0.1 percent difference is incredibly important. 
&gt; 
&gt; Imagine a world where misleading journalists were selected against instead of
&gt; rewarded :)

&gt; 
&gt; P.S. 3.2 billion base pairs.  Unlike binary (01), DNA has four bases (atcg)
and
&gt; they are in pairs, ie the backup is the other  strand of the double helix.
All
&gt; we have to do now is solve what languages the 3.2 billion base pairs were
&gt; written in.

&gt;  Super Bad News Bears for all programmers, database admins,
&gt;  website designers, you have been replaced by an ape that will
&gt;  work for 93 cents an hour!  Go see
&gt;  <A HREF="http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp.">http://www.newtechusa.com/ppi/main.asp.</A>
&gt;  
&gt;  This is good for smaller companies that cannot afford to
&gt;  hire real people to do their IT work.
