Hi,

I remember seeing a program on SBS about the computer attacks that
happened just after 9/11 and received very little coverage at the time
because all news was overshadowed by 9/11. Nonetheless these were
serious attacks.

One of the themes in the program was the vulnerability of the
electricity grids.
There were some "experts" who claimed that it would be easy to bring
them down.

An event of such large proportions as this latest electricity failure is
- a prime suspect for being caused by s/w attacks
- one that authorities would deny, at all cost, having been the result
of s/w attacks
- one that fits in the scenario for the type of terrorist attack we
could expect.

Whether it's MSBlaster related or not, I'm not happy with the
explanation that the grid is "aged".

kind regards,
Luke

&gt; CNN reported that the power blackout may have been a result of
&gt; the latest worm doing the rounds.  The cynic in me quickly
&gt; poo-pooed that idea as media sensationalism.  Then someone on
&gt; Bugtraq reported that quite a few of the power stations in that
&gt; region use a product called OPC for SCADA control, which stands
&gt; for "OLE for Process Control", which uses DCOM, which runs on
&gt; Microsoft's RPC, which the aforementioned worm happens to attack.
&gt; 
&gt; Uh-oh.
&gt; 
&gt; This could be a tremendous black eye if this is substantiated.
