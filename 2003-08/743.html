David,

So if Parliament passed a law that forbid people of Asian descent to walk the 
streets after 10pm, you would abide by it?

Such a law wouldn't have been inconceivable back in the 60's with the "White 
Australia" policy (a law passed in our so-called democracy). If you were to 
disobey this law, I would support you. In fact I'd be out on the streets 
protesting with you.

Stupid Laws should be disobeyed, loudly.

Damien

&gt; Damien,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Seems to be a mostly negative view of this on Slashdot as far as I can
&gt; &gt; see, e.g:

&gt;
&gt; Well, seeing we can just disregard patent law because it's obviously
&gt; wrong, I am going to throw the WHOLE lawy out because I think it's
&gt; wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, ALL THE LAW.
&gt;
&gt; The system breaks when individuals or classes decide to get selective
&gt; about what is lawful or not.
&gt;
&gt; I postulate the following, seeing I've been on a roll for insulting
&gt; everyone all at once lately:
&gt;
&gt;  ANYONE who decides that it is "wrong" to uphold the law that has been
&gt;  lawfully made is guilty of undermining all our legal system, all our
&gt;  democracy and everything we've ever fought for.
&gt;
&gt; So just what are you advocating?
&gt;
&gt; BE WARNED: I will not fear calling you all unlawful. Moronic is similar
&gt; to ignorant - forgivable. But unlawful deserves something more
&gt; sinister...they say never attribute to malice what you can attribute to
&gt; stupidity. Our opposition to the awarding of this patent is bordering on
&gt; the not stupid. It's sounding malicious....

&gt;  on the street scene 'cos I'm hoping for love
&gt;  in the middle of town tonight...
