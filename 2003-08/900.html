Matthew,

&gt; Most laptop (and PC for that matter) vendors ship a CD of drivers for
&gt; their hardware. This makes little sense in many OSS cases. What you
&gt; could do is ship a CD with things like a kernel config and any
&gt; non-standard stuff (like the driver for the winmodem in a particular
&gt; model of laptop). You'd probably turn of most features and have
&gt; everything else as modules.

That sounds like an excellent idea. A copy of the Microbits Debian
GNU/Linux distribution goes out with the laptop anyway and as much of the
system will be working as we are able to make work (1).

&gt; It's probably also worth your while to list exact chipsets are used in
&gt; the laptop, so that those of us who might not want Microbits' Debian
&gt; dist can evaluate whether that laptop will do what they want. Many
&gt; laptop manufacturers don't currently do that.

Another good idea. Consider it done.

&gt; How will installing something other than your distro affect the
&gt; warranty?

I don't believe it will affect the hardware warranty itself.

&gt; Will there be "it's a software problem, not hardware" answers
&gt; to most questions if I install Solaris, *BSD or even Windows on the
&gt; laptop?

All support calls for open source products, or products which have had our
distribution on them, generally involve speaking with me or Troy Vodopivec
(who occasionally posts to the list).

We're reasonably competent at diagnosing what the problems are.

The other members of our support staff (i.e. the Windows guys and the Apple
guys) seem to be genuinenly interested in fixing the real source of the
problem regardless of its source.

&gt; I'd personally be very interested to see the pricing, specs and chipset
&gt; info when you release them :-)

;-)
