[rant mode]
why, oh why, do distros omit the kernel source from the default package 
install list? (redhat, mandrake, i'm talking to you.) there are so many 
times when it's needed; i've had 3 or 4 times personally where it's come 
up either at work or home that it hasn't been installed and people have 
been mystified as to why something wouldn't compile.

i'd say the kernel source, while it takes up a fair bit of space, 
*needs* to be installed by default.
[/rant]

Corey, what distro are you using? if it's redhat or mandrake (the only 
two i have any experience in, really), you should be able to run their 
respective package managers - under "main menu -&gt; configure -&gt; package 
management" in mandrake, or under "main menu -&gt; system settings -&gt; 
add/remove applications", i think, in redhat. *hopefully* the kernel 
source package will be listed in there; you can select it to be 
installed and it should prompt you for the correct CD.

&gt; Hey guys.
&gt; 
&gt; Looking for a few tips to do with this little beggar. In short, I can't get
&gt; my GeForce Ti4800 to load its 3D modules because as I go to install the
&gt; NVIDIA-provided .run file, it keeps telling me I'm missing header files to
&gt; be able to install it. I assume this means that it needs the kernel source.
&gt; I haven't had much of a chance to have a play with this OS yet but if it's
&gt; the missing kernel problem, I wonder why the kernel source didn't come with
&gt; it. Anyone know?
&gt; 
&gt; So can anyone help me out here?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks people.
&gt; 
&gt; Corey.
