If it's Austel approved ethernet cable installed by an Austel approved
installer, it's fine.  We do it all the time in our office.  (there are
no 'phone' cables anywhere in our office, they all go through our
ethernet patch panel).

Mark,

While I am not a telco technicaian, I understand that it is against some
telecommunication regulation put a phone connection down a network
cable. Personally, I wouldn't want to do it anyway for reason of
possible interference.

&gt;  
&gt; There are two types of cable.  "Patch" cable is used for, well, 
&gt; patchleads. It's very flexible because the wires in the cable are 
&gt; stranded.
&gt; 
&gt; The other kind is used for internal building work, is less flexible, 
&gt; and has solid-core conductors.  That makes it nice and strong, so you 
&gt; can pull it through ducts, gaps between walls, etc without causing 
&gt; internal fractures.  When you bend it it wants to stay bent too.
&gt; 
&gt; If you ask a vendor for patch cable you'll end up with the stuff that 
&gt; isn't usually used for internal building work.
&gt; 
&gt; This may not seem like a problem on the surface, but it is:  the two 
&gt; types of cable have two types of connector.  Most wallplates and 
&gt; patchpanels have Krone terminations on them which expect solid-core 
&gt; cable.  And most crimp-on RJ45 plugs are intended to go on the end of 
&gt; patchleads, and they therefore expect stranded cable.  You might end 
&gt; up with dodgy terminations if you mix the cable and connector types.
&gt; 
&gt; So for building work specify that you want a 100m roll of solid-core 
&gt; CAT5E cable.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Anyway, does anyone know where to get some cheap CAT5 in Adelaide?

&gt; &gt; JayCar has it for 75c/m, but i've heard you can get good quality  &gt; 
&gt; cable for 40c/m.
&gt; 
&gt; Try Page Data.
