&gt; Your distinction between the idea and the expression of an idea is

It's not.  (Isn't protection of an expression exactly what copyright
is for?)

Let me give you an example of the difference: I have the idea
of compressing data by converting it to a shadow mask relative to a
natural scene.  That's an idea.  I write a program that compresses data
by converting it to a shadow mask relative to a natural scene.  That's an
expression of an idea.  You could write a different such program, and
that would be an entirely different expression of the exact same idea.


&gt; Only the dullest
&gt; of programmers would implement an idea without adding something new.

You'd think so, wouldn't you?  And once you've come up with the new
idea, someone else could re-implement (ie re-express) it; or else
approach you for licencing conditions on your expression.


&gt; Invention is happening all the time. It's a fact of life. It's so sad that
&gt; the basic urge to invent (like so many other urges) is now subject to
&gt; attempts from numerous quarters to get control of it and monopolise it and
&gt; "propertize" it.

This idea of owning an invention is not new, at least no newer than the
patent laws.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In my opinion, everyone should give away all of their software because it
&gt;&gt;&gt; is only a logical corollary of what went before and owes more debt to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the past than the future will owe to it.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; That's a very interesting notion, with the corollary that an architect
&gt;&gt; should give away all of her designs, and perhaps a builder should build
&gt;&gt; it for nothing more than the cost of materials.  Unfortunately very few
&gt;&gt; builders or architects would be willing to work for free.  Likewise,
&gt;&gt; very few programmers are willing to work for free without having at least
&gt;&gt; some independant source of income.
&gt;
&gt; It seems to me like your speculations about my opinions are false.
&gt; It's better if you ascribe your corollaries to yourself rather than to me.
&gt; I don't agree with your "corollaries". So they don't invalidate my statements
&gt; at all. 

Really?  In what way is the property of an architectural design different
to the property of a computer program?

&gt; To state it simply, the idea that one owes 99% of one's invention to what
&gt; went before does not forbid you from making a living. It just means that
&gt; you should not get too egotistical about "your" invention, because
&gt; it's not really yours.

I quite agree with you, which is why I made the distinction between
invention and expression.  I really do have rights over an image that I
paint, even though that image was clearly influenced by Picasso during
his blue period.
