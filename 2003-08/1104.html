&gt; Ouch. The thot plickens.

&gt; So back to the part about SCO owning the rights to the code,
&gt; do you think they do now that you have seen an extract of 
&gt; what they call "offending" code?

Ian,

I have no way of answering that question, but I reckon that if it turns out
that SCO can collect more than 10 cents per user for this thing, there will be
a mass exodus out of linux and into the BSDs.  If I were operating a BSD
download site right now, I'd be looking around for an increased number of
mirrors real quick if the plot really does thicken!  I hope FreeBSD has all the
drivers I need for all of my machines...

On the other hand, if you were going to show 50 lines of offending code,
you would show your strongest, most incontrovertible 50 lines rather than
your weakest, and these might be the tip of a very small iceberg.
That would explain why they're so reluctant to let the lines go public --
so as to ensure that they're not removed -- if the offending code was
extensive, then surely it would be impossible to remove it easily, and
therefore there would be no "danger" from the sco point of view that
they it might be removed easily.

Cheers,
ak.
