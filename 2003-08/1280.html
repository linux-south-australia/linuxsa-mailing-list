&gt; Some time ago a close friend of mine received what she thought would help

&gt; Little could be further from the truth. In addition to dubious hardware
&gt; (this might be something to be expected from second hand hardware, but
&gt; consistent denials of problems by members of Computerbank left her feeling
&gt; aggravated, distressed and put down - the machine clearly was faulty with a
&gt; probable hardware conflict as the cause - though this was not accepted
&gt; by people at CB she dealt with).

My phone number is 0404167970, email is <A HREF="mailto:shaun@pcuse.com">shaun@pcuse.com</A>, icq is
10469563, if you want my home address i will give it too you. I am at
Computerbank (Aldgate) on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Bring the machine in
and we will try our hardest to find out what is wrong with it.

&gt; After having got the machine to work for her, I find that the kernel 
&gt; running on the machine is 2.4.17 (notoriously buggy), the /etc/fstab entry
&gt; for the cdrom is broken and that KDE is a manky piece of crap (sorry to
&gt; delve into religion here, but why put on an environment that doesn't work
&gt; - my first experience with KDE (3.0.2) was finding the KMail is broken,
&gt; KSpread can't export to Excel (work requirement) and though it says it
&gt; can export to gnumeric, that fails). This really throws an insult at the
&gt; strengths of the underlying system (Debian GNU/Linux). Is providing flakey
&gt; (at best) software in these components likely to enable a computer (and
&gt; most proably a Linux) neophyte to use the machine, given that it takes a
&gt; degree of Linux awareness at least to fix or understand the issues
&gt; involved - I think not.

Feel free to bring the box back and we can either install a different
OSS on there or if you really don't appreciate what we have GIVEN away,
then we can give it to someone who appreciates it.

&gt; What I find myself asking is: What function does Computerbank play in
&gt; South Australia? Is it to provide functional computers to those in need
&gt; and who are in most probability not highly computer literate? Is it to act
&gt; in some degree as a Linux advocacy group? I would have to say that
&gt; Computerbank's efforts fail abysmally in both regards in the experience
&gt; that I have had with it through my friend.

Hi Dan,
Computerbank exists to stop good hardware becoming landfill by making
usable systems out of it, installing the best operating system and
applications we can find. We then GIVE these systems away using
volunteer labour for the whole process. We offer training, we offer
hardware and software support all for free for as long as we can.

Feel free to talk to me personally about sorting out any problems your
friend has. We give out the best hardware and software we have
available.

If you feel that we are doing a really bad job, please come along and
help us build better systems. I am happy to personally work on the
system to fix this problem.

Now about why we usually use KDE, simply because most of our volunteers
are familiar with it and it is easy for Windows users to navigate.
Personally, I use fvwm on FreeBSD, but this is not about what I am
comfortable with, this is about doing the best we can for as many people
as possible.
