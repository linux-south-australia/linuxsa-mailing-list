&gt;&gt; No, but you might be able to track it down.  Try running
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   stty &lt; /dev/pts/3 -a
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (assuming the window in question is /dev/pts/3) from another xterm
&gt;&gt; window to see what the settings are.  You should also be able to set
&gt;&gt; them that way, but Linux doesn't seem to let me do it:
&gt;
&gt; Greg,
&gt;
&gt; Many thanks for that. Unfortunately I just killed the current window giving me
&gt; the problems. But the problem happens about once a day on some machine (since I
&gt; have many dozens of such windows on multiple workstations).
&gt;
&gt; The problem nearly always occurs when doing an "ssh" from a workstation
&gt; to a server. There are two "pts" objects involved.
&gt; So which of the ttys should I monitor? Presumably both, I suppose.

The one which the tail has open as stdin.

&gt; It's a mystery to me as to the exact data path for my keyboard
&gt; input.  Is it something like this:
&gt;
&gt; kbd -&gt; serial (or PS/2) driver

Keyboard driver.

&gt;     -&gt; TTY layer kernel module
&gt;     -&gt; X software
&gt;     -&gt; X application (such as xterm)

So far, so good.

&gt;     -&gt; local shell (e.g. /bin/tcsh)
&gt;     -&gt; local ssh process

Choose one.  Once you have your ssh running, the local shell is just
waiting for it to stop.

&gt;     -&gt; remote sshd process
&gt;     -&gt; remote TTY layer

IIRC this is the pty layer (network, not tty), but I'm a little hazy here.

&gt;     -&gt; remote user shell (e.g. /bin/tcsh)
&gt;     -&gt; "tail" program

Again, chose one.

The real issue here is that this is out-of-band communications.  The
remote tail is talking to its pty layer and telling it that a ^C (for
example) should cause it to receive a SIGINT signal.  Along the rest
of the path, the processes involved (ssh/sshd) must not interpret the
character, otherwise it will never get to the remote tail.  I suppose
there's a possibility that that's what's happening, but watching the
stty output will help.

&gt; Anything involving a TTY "thing" (whatever it is) is a black art to me.
&gt; In one example I'm looking at now, I see this in "w" on the workstation:
&gt;
&gt; akenning pts/20   -                11:31am 16:22   0.29s  0.15s  ssh xyz
&gt;
&gt; This is the process which I just restarted after clobbering the blocked process.
&gt;
&gt; On the server, I see this:
&gt;
&gt; akenning pts/9    xyz.domain.net   11:31am 28:27   0.44s  0.00s  tail -f ...

I don't see anything of interest there; I'm not sure I would ever.

&gt; Doing "stty -a" on these gives the usual info. I'll store that and
&gt; wait for the problem to resurface.

Good idea.

&gt;&gt; You can also try killing the process with an appropriate signal:
&gt;
&gt; From memory, kill the remote process does not good at all.  If my
&gt; memory's correct, the kbd input still goes nowhere.

Remember that kill(1) invokes kill(2), arguably the worst named
function in the system.  It just delivers a signal.  The example I
showed delivers a SIGINT.  If your tail is blocking SIGINT, you need
look no further.

&gt; I.e. I still have to kill the local xterm (or other X window
&gt; terminal emulator).

Hmm.  I might be missing something here.

Greg
