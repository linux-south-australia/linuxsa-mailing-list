&gt;If anyone is under attack from this thing without a virus scanner on

&gt;Is the a legitimate reason for emailing these file extension types??

On a Windows box, .pif is a shortcut (think symlink) to a DOS application.
So even if you took a perfectly harmless and legitimate pif file and emailed
it to someone else it wouldn't work unless you had the same DOS app in the
same folder as the sending machine.  In other words, even if some legitimate
user had a good reason to email a valid .pif file, chances are the receiver
wouldn't be able to do anything with it anyway.  So there's no harm in
blocking all of them!

Our MIMEDefang blocked 2 copies of this virus because it had a .pif
extension a couple of hours before McAfee released signatures to detect it
as a virus.  Sobig.f is very new, we've only been seeing it since about
midnight, McAfee has only been able to detect it since sometime between 10pm
and 2am CST (we update ours every 6 hours).

MIMEDefang and Amavis make a very good defence against email borne viruses.
What Amavis misses will quite often be caught by MIMEDefang's file type
blocking.

Jim.
