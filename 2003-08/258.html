Actually,

&gt; &gt; If you haven't already done so, as a last resort it might be worth
&gt; &gt; your while to try powering down the box and removing the mains for a
&gt; &gt; short period. I once got caught out by a fault that could only be
&gt; &gt; rectified by removing power after assuring my client that "a reset
&gt; &gt; is as good as a power-cycle". Doesn't seem all that likely in your
&gt; &gt; case but nonetheless, to be sure, to be sure.

Older devices would need a power remove and then put back on. I think it
had something to do with residual energy or electricity but the
phenomenon is very real.

It is actually one of the first things I'll do if I think that there's a
hardware fault...removing the power from the wall and waiting 30 seconds
isn't very much time wasted ;-)))

A keyboard error could be caused by subtle differences in the X keyboard
and mouse drivers though.
