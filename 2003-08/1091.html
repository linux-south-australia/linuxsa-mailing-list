how about this for a solution:
get a few of the larger open source projects (samba, apache, etc) to release
in their licence "free to anyone except SCO"

&gt;  Community: SCO Use of Samba Code Under the GPL
&gt; Aug 20, 2003, 00 :00 UTC (30 Talkback[s]) (5880 reads)
&gt; (Other stories by Jeremy Allison)
&gt;
&gt; [ Thanks to Jeremy Allison - Samba Team for this release. ]
&gt;
&gt; Over the past few months, the SCO (Santa Cruz Operation) Corporation 
&gt; (formerly Caldera International, Inc. a Linux distribution vendor) has 
&gt; been complaining about violations of its Copyright works by the Linux 
&gt; kernel code.
&gt;
&gt; Recently, Darl McBride, the Chief Executive Officer of SCO has been 
&gt; making pejorative statements regarding the license used by the Linux 
&gt; kernel, the GNU GPL. In a keynote speech he recently said :
&gt;
&gt; "At the end of the day, the GPL is not about making software free; 
&gt; it's about destroying value."
&gt;
&gt; In light of this it is the depths of hypocrisy that at the same event 
&gt; SCO also announced the incorporation of the Samba3 release into their 
&gt; latest OpenServer product. Samba is an Open Source/Free Software 
&gt; project that allows Linux and UNIX servers to interoperate with 
&gt; Microsoft Windows clients. The reason for this is clear; Samba3 allows 
&gt; Linux and UNIX servers to replace Microsoft Windows NT Domain 
&gt; Controllers and will add great value to any Operating System which 
&gt; includes it. However, Samba is also developed and distributed under 
&gt; the GNU GPL license, in exactly the same manner as the Linux kernel 
&gt; code that SCO has been criticizing for its lack of care in ownership 
&gt; attribution.
&gt;
&gt; We observe that SCO is both attacking the GPL on the one hand and 
&gt; benefiting from the GPL on the other hand. SCO can't have it both 
&gt; ways. SCO has a clear choice: either pledge not to use any Open 
&gt; Source/Free Software in any of their products, or actively participate 
&gt; in the Open Source/Free Software movement and reap the benefits. For 
&gt; SCO to continue to use Open Source/Free Software while attacking 
&gt; others for using it is the epitome of hypocrisy.
&gt;
&gt; The strength of Open Source/Free Software is that it is available to 
&gt; all without restrictions on fields of endeavor, as the Samba Team 
&gt; believes the ability to freely use, modify and learn from software 
&gt; code is one of the grounding principles of computer science, and a 
&gt; basic freedom for all.
&gt;
&gt; Because of this, we believe that the Samba must remain true to our 
&gt; principles and be freely available to use even in ways we personally 
&gt; disapprove of.
&gt;
&gt; Even when used by rank hypocrites like SCO.
