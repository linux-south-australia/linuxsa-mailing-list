Just picking up the Saturday morning [virtual] papers off the [virtual] lawn
this morning, I noticed among the general bilge about the significance
of the worm thing and the electricity thing and the sco/ibm/linux thing
this well-argued little piece:

<A HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/15/32NNsco_1.html">http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/08/15/32NNsco_1.html</A>

I quote:

====================================================== 
"Some issues around patents, copyrights, and licenses will, to some degree,
perhaps make Linux a victim of its own success," said Gordon Haff, an analyst
at Illuminata in Nashua, N.H.

Indeed, open source advocate Bruce Perens said earlier this month that SCO's
lawsuit with IBM was a distraction from a far more dangerous threat to the
Linux operating system, namely software patents.

"SCO is nothing [compared to] the threat that open source developers face from
software patents," Perens said.

Concerns about software patents are one of a number of IP growing pains that
open source developers are beginning to feel as the popularity of their
projects brings them into the sights of commercial rivals who play by different
rules than the open source community.

It is common practice, for instance, for commercial software companies to
register "defensive" software patents that can be used either to deter
litigation from rival companies or to form the basis of a countersuit. But
because so many open source developers find the idea of software patents
anathema, open source projects tend to exist without this kind of defense. And
because their source code is available to anyone who cares to inspect it, open
source projects have an exposure to IP snoops that proprietary software
products simply do not have. 

[...]

Some observers fear that major vendors will bring lawsuits against open source
projects. "Of course, the big looming threat is Microsoft. They've got a huge
number of patents; they've got armies of lawyers; they've got the strategic
incentive," said Eric Raymond, president of Open Source Initiative.

But both Perens and Neuberger said that the next IP attack on open source would
most likely be from a small company, not unlike SCO, with a patent claim it
feels could be a revenue generator, and not from a major company. Even
Microsoft, which is threatened by Linux, Apache, and Samba, is unlikely to
pursue a direct attack, such as SCO's. "I expect that Microsoft will try and
find other proxies to do their dirty work for them," Perens said. 
======================================================

At least I opine that this article is not pure bilge, perhaps because it agrees
with my perspective. Since most software ideas that are not actually in
10-year-old textbooks are currently "owned" by someone, it follows that writing
non-pedestrian free software is dangerous. Linux could probably have survived
indefinitely without molestation if not for the crazy expansionist and world
domination urges of some linuxistas. Somehow I get the feeling that linux
people outside the USA have been less keen to take over the world and more
concerned to just get on with life quietly. But maybe that's a skewed
perception. Anyway.... smaller targets are more difficult to hit.

Cheers,
ak.
