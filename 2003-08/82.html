<H1>GPL Question: Xine/Lindows/Non GPL DVD Decryption library</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I have quaoted an abridged discussion that is going on in the Guest 
forum at Lindows.com. Anybody can go there to make a comment or reply to 
the discussion.

* Question, is Lindows in violation of the GPL ?

James Leone




 &gt;I just want clarification on the xine version you all
 &gt;are selling now. Does it, or does it not play encrypted DVD's?



 &gt;"I guess I'd have to know which DVDs those are."
 &gt;
 &gt;Just tested with Lara Croft TOMB RAIDER (UK Import and
 &gt;BeNeLux version Both Region 2 but the UK Import doesn't
 &gt;have subtitles).
 &gt;
 &gt;"Are they commercial, encrypted DVDs?"
 &gt;
 &gt;YES !
 &gt;
 &gt;"Which titles?"
 &gt;
 &gt;I've tested with :
 &gt;
 &gt;Lare Croft TOMB RAIDER (UK & BeNeLux)
 &gt;
 &gt;U.S. Navy Seals (Documentaty) I must say that the image
 &gt;of this DVD doesn't look that good (but Tomb Raider
 &gt;looks realy good so I guess it's a DVD problem and not
 &gt;a Xine problem).
 &gt;
 &gt;you can see some screenshots Here
 &gt;
 &gt;It has some Tomb Raider shots and some of the U.S. Navy
 &gt;Seals Documentary.

 &gt;I still do not understand what the difference is
 &gt;between the Xine I download for free and the one sold
 &gt;by Lindows? Can someone help me out here. I can
 &gt;currently play all my dvd's with the free one....
 &gt;
 &gt;Brian


 &gt;The difference between Xine and the Xine "sold" by
 &gt;Lindows.com is that the Commercial version contains a
 &gt;Licensed DVD CODEC which allows you to play commercial
 &gt;(Encrypted) DVDs.
 &gt;
 &gt;Lindows.com is at this moment the ONLY linux distro
 &gt;that offers this (a LEGAL way to watch DVDs)
 &gt;
 &gt;The Free version doesn't include this CODEC so you
 &gt;don't have to pay for it (both versions can be
 &gt;installed through CNR) and I believe that there is a
 &gt;way to play Encrypted DVDs on "normal" Xine, but the
 &gt;MPAA says it's illegal.

 &gt;may anybody with access to this "commercial xine"
 &gt;please download the source and let us know what they
 &gt;have added?
 &gt;
 &gt;if nothing else, just make the GPL source available
 &gt;somewhere and i will find out...
 &gt;
 &gt;thanks.


 &gt;TekMate
 &gt;The version in CNR has an added dvd codec which is not
 &gt;downloadable under the gpl. You can download the
 &gt;Lindows source but it won't be in it.



 &gt;Nice but can I buy the Linows Xine without running
 &gt;Lindows and without beeing member of Click-N-Run? The page:
 &gt;
 &gt;<A HREF="http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id">http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id</A>=11804
 &gt;
 &gt;says:
 &gt;
 &gt;Price $39,95
 &gt;
 &gt;Member's Price: $4,95
 &gt;
 &gt;I've tried to find out how to buy it but I always found
 &gt;that I must became a member of Click-N-Run.
 &gt;
 &gt;I'm running other Linux distros and at the moment it's
 &gt;not necessary for me to change my system to Lindows.
 &gt;However, I'd be very pleased to run this legal xine and
 &gt;I'm willing to pay $39,95 for it.

 &gt;Re: Xine [re: TekMate]
 &gt;
 &gt;"dvd codec", do you mean an mpeg2 coder/decoder ?
 &gt;
 &gt;In order to get legal dvd playback, you need more that
 &gt;one license, one for decss, one for the video decoder,
 &gt;one for the audio decoder, ...
 &gt;
 &gt;xine is under the GPL license, you CAN'T link a non
 &gt;(L)GPLed library/plugin/decoder to it !
 &gt;
 &gt;If Lindows is linking something not GPLed to xine, it's
 &gt;not legal.
 &gt;
 &gt;So if Lindows links something to xine, they must
 &gt;provide the source code because it must be GPLed !
 &gt;
 &gt;Anyway, developping a new mpeg2 decoder for xine with
 &gt;the same features that the internal one (libmpeg2) is
 &gt;really a complicated task, especially if you don't send
 &gt;any email to the xine dev team. I'm sure Lindows
 &gt;doesn't provide a new decoder, and "Lindows DVD Player"
 &gt;is just a vanilla xine with libdvdcss installed. I
 &gt;really do not understand how they can buy a license for
 &gt;libdvdcss because it's also GPLed and the way it works
 &gt;is just cracking dvd css keys.

 &gt;Just did a quick search of the GNU GPL license and
 &gt;found this :
 &gt;
 &gt;Does the GPL allow me to sell copies of the program for
 &gt;money? "Yes, the GPL allows everyone to do this. The
 &gt;right to sell copies is part of the definition of free
 &gt;software. Except in one special situation, there is no
 &gt;limit on what price you can charge. (The one exception
 &gt;is the required written offer to provide source code
 &gt;that must accompany binary-only release.)"
 &gt;
 &gt;Found this in the FAQ

 &gt;
 &gt;Another quick search of the GNU GPL license:
 &gt;
 &gt;<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html</A>#GPLAndPlugins
 &gt;
 &gt;"If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they
 &gt;make function calls to each other and share data
 &gt;structures, we believe they form a single program, so
 &gt;plug-ins must be treated as extensions to the main
 &gt;program. This means they must be released under the GPL
 &gt;or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the
 &gt;terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins
 &gt;are distributed."
 &gt;
 &gt;afaik this is the case of xine plug-ins.

 &gt;
 &gt;Disclaimer: I have nothing whatsoever to do with the
 &gt;xine project. I just use the end-result.
 &gt;
 &gt;I have to say that this kind of thing really bugs me.
 &gt;I've come here after reading on the Xine website that
 &gt;the Xine dev's weren't even aware that LOS were doing
 &gt;this. Frankly I find this a disgraceful lack of manners
 &gt;on the part of LOS. Where is the common courtesy of at
 &gt;least telling them? I see no mention of LOS on the
 &gt;contributions page at Xine, so presumably you (LOS) are
 &gt;adding a tiny piece of disputedly illegal code to sell
 &gt;a large and complex piece of software without making
 &gt;any contribution to the developers who devote a large
 &gt;amount of brains and time to a very useful program.
 &gt;
 &gt;Shame on you.
 &gt;
 &gt;Note that I've posted here, as the Xine devs are taking
 &gt;a diplomatic position which I respect.
 &gt;
 &gt;If you've always intended on making a significant
 &gt;contribution to the Xine project, I'll apologise and
 &gt;eat every word, but as it stands, you rank as the pimps
 &gt;of the software world, living off of immoral earnings!

 &gt;
 &gt;"Disclaimer: I have nothing whatsoever to do with the

 &gt;
 &gt;OK, and Just for the record. I'm also just an End User
 &gt;of LindowsOS.
 &gt;
 &gt;"Where is the common courtesy of at least telling them?"
 &gt;
 &gt;I agree with you on this for the full 100%,
 &gt;
 &gt;a few days ago I was contacted (by email) by a person
 &gt;who claimed to be a Xine Developer and asked me some
 &gt;questions about this Commercial DVD-Player. Since I'm
 &gt;no Lindows.com employee, I told him to contact Kevin or
 &gt;another staff member of Lindows.com and he did (Kevin
 &gt;replied very soon he said, but at that point he was
 &gt;still waiting on an answer from another person at
 &gt;Lindows.com). I was also amazed that these people
 &gt;didn't know Lindows.com was doing this (we all know
 &gt;Lindows.com supports great projects like Debian,
 &gt;Mozilla and some others). so I'm hoping they will add
 &gt;Xine to this list very soon.
 &gt;
 &gt;"so presumably you (LOS) are adding a tiny piece of
 &gt;disputedly illegal code to sell a large and complex
 &gt;piece of software without making any contribution to
 &gt;the developers who devote a large amount of brains and
 &gt;time to a very useful program."
 &gt;
 &gt;How can you be sure that it's ILLEGAL CODE ?!
 &gt;
 &gt;I personally don't think Lindows.com has/will ever
 &gt;break the GNU/GPL license (they only use a diffrent
 &gt;interpretation of it, which is very much allowed).
 &gt;
 &gt;"Note that I've posted here, as the Xine devs are
 &gt;taking a diplomatic position which I respect. "
 &gt;
 &gt;AFAIK the Xine devs are negotiating with Lindows.com
 &gt;(maybe to get this available for the entire Linux
 &gt;community). problem is that Lindows.com must pay a
 &gt;certain linsence fee for each version so they can't
 &gt;give it away for free (as beer should be).
 &gt;
 &gt;In reply to:
 &gt;
 &gt;note : this is posted on the Xine homepage :
 &gt;
 &gt;Latest News
 &gt;
 &gt;30.07.2003 xine-based dvd player
 &gt;
 &gt;Lindows is offering a DVD Player Application which has
 &gt;been confirmed to be based on xine. While the xine
 &gt;project was not aware about their efforts to bring
 &gt;fully licensed DVD playback to their users until very
 &gt;recently this is definitely a very interesting project.
 &gt;Some xine developers are currently trying to get in
 &gt;touch with Lindows in an attempt to establish some
 &gt;cooperation in the future. While the Lindows DVD Player
 &gt;is definitely worth a look for Lindows end-users,
 &gt;please be aware that you can get the same for free by
 &gt;downloading xine from this website (and maybe adding a
 &gt;few additional codecs and libraries which are available
 &gt;for free from other websites).
