      ITCC 2004: IEEE International Conference on

         Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society

                        *****************

Computational Grids, initially used for the sharing of distributed computation
resources in scientific applications, start to be used in different
application domains offering basic services for application definition and
execution in heterogeneous distributed systems.

In health systems, the Grid offers the power and ubiquity needed to the
acquisition of biomedical data, processing and delivering of biomedical images
(CT, MRI, PET, SPECT, etc) located in different hospitals, within a wide area.
So, the Grid acts as a Collaborative Working Environment: doctors often want
to aggregate not only medical data, but also human expertise and might want
colleague around the world to visualize the examinations in the same way and
at the same time so that the group can discuss the diagnosis in real time.

The Grid offers a dynamic infrastructure for retrieving and on-demand
processing of remote sensing data, for instance, retrieving of SAR metadata
related to terabyte of SAR data, starting on-demand processing on raw data,
starting on-demand post-processing on focalized data and creating a complex
application composing simple tasks.

For atmospheric and climate modeling, a Grid offers tools for simulate and
forecasting meteorological phenomena, simulate emission and dispersion of
pollutants for air quality studies and simulate complex phenomena about the
impact of global climate changes.

Grid Computing techniques can be used in the motor industry, reducing the
optimization process time for improvement of diesel engine emission
performance using, for instance, micro-genetic algorithms for engine chamber
geometry optimization and Kiva3 code to calculate chamber geometry fitness.

In the computer aided medicine, the Grid technologies can be used in the
surgical simulations (including virtual environment and haptic interface).
Interesting research areas involve the detection, in the virtual environment,
of the contact points between artery walls and medical instruments, studies to
generate, by means of the haptic interface, the force feedback associated to
the interaction in the virtual environment and describe the physical behaviour
of the organs considered as deformable tissues.

Finally, bioinformatic applications call for the ability to read large
datasets (e.g. protein databases) and to create new datasets (e.g. mass
spectrometry proteomic data). They can require the ability to change
(updating) existing datasets; consequently a Data Grid, i.e. a distributed
infrastructure for storing large datasets, is needed. In the bioinformatic
field, a Data Grid could reveal useful to build Electronic Patient Record
systems (EPRs) for the management of patient information (data, metadata and
images), to support data replication, allowing the integration and sharing of
biological databases and, generally, for the developement of efficient
bioinformatics (in particular proteomic) applications.

The main goal of the Conference Track is to discuss well-known and emerging
data-intensive applications in the context of distributed systems and Grid
systems, and to analyze technologies and methodologies useful to develop such
applications in such environments.

In particular, this Conference Track aims at offering a forum of discussion
where young researchers and PhD students could present their research
activities, either at an early or mature phase.

  Data intensive applications in distributed and Grid systems:
      - Grid for biomedical imaging;
      - Grid for remote sensing and GIS application;
      - Grid for Atmospheric and Climate Modeling;

      - Grid Information and Monitoring services and related
(OO,Relational,XML) data models;
