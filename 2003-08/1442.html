&gt;To track Sid (Unstable) you'll download about 10-20Mb of data per day on

Or if you really want to live on the edge you can track experimental - 
which will be even more up to date, but also likely to get a little 
broken at times. Unstable (sid) is surprisingly stable, contrary to its 
name. My main problems involve holding some upgrades that will break 
because their dependencies haven't yet been uploaded to the repository.

&gt;I think Barney was being slightly sarcastic when he said that "apt-get
&gt;update" was painful.

Yes that was tounge in cheek in response to Justin's comment:
"P.S. Debian users: Yes yours is better. Make no mistake - it still sucks"

O-oh David understood where I was coming from, should I be worried? :)
