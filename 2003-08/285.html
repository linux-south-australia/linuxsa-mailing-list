&gt;&gt; ... Novell have more then one product, you know. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; Yes, yes they do, and I think every single product I have used from them 
&gt; is complete crap.  I have used their Groupwise which is completley crap.  
&gt; Go figure this one.  I have an organization with 600 employees(not 
&gt; Regency).  A user accidentally deletes 4 emails from a very very important 
&gt; source.  How do you get it back?  You have top recover the entire, yes 
&gt; entire post office.  

Sorry thats MS Exchange. GroupWise uses a file per email based system, you 
obviously didn't have a backup program up to spec for backup of GroupWise 
POs. 


I can pick apart anything Novell owns and has
&gt; complete rights over, and  that I have used to be far far below the 
&gt; expectation of anyone who has the littlest brain.  Not saying people don't 
&gt; like it, but I can't stand it and I know a few other people that feel just 
&gt; as strongly about it as I do. 

Try comparing e-Directory to other enterprise class directories out there. 
Its hard to beat for range of platforms it will run on. 

The latest Netware 6 for another example,
&gt; by default does not allow you to remotely open/read a file that is in use 
&gt; by another program.

Well has that file been marked shareable ? If not that is the correct 
behaviour from NetWare 3 (or before). 

 Now I don't care too much about shutting down my own
&gt; webserver at home to read the logs but if i am work and it costs the 
&gt; company $85,000 a minute to shut down this web service, well I don't think 
&gt; it would happen and still get to keep my job.

Thats why Novell (and others) have a tool to do that kind of job. Look at 
the Novell Cool solutions web site. Many bug bears with Novell can be solved 
that way. 

 I have to be on the server
&gt; to do that, and well if I don't have amonster CPU or some ridiculous 
&gt; amount os memory the GUI(startx) will just run the whole system to the 
&gt; ground, and yes it depends on the server's usage.  

And I;ve yet to find much use for the X on the local server, the standard 
CUI based utilities seem to do the job, or the web page interfaces. I'll pay 
Console One as a joke though. Almost everyone seems to hate it. 

Besides what OS now a
&gt; days that is engineered properly as a server needs DOS or some other 
&gt; "OS"(which of course now covers Linux :)?
&gt; A: Netware

DOS is only the OS loader, and can be unladed once Netware is running, think 
of it only as a boot loader program. Many operating systems still have 
something similar embedded. Doesnt even need to me MS DOS to load. 

To be fair to Novell, they are verry committed to Linux, and are about to 
bring out a suit of products for it. Novell scales much better than the next 
most popular for small business (Microsoft). I won't say their product is 
perfect (whos is ?), but there are mu8ch worse prducts on the market out 
there.
