&gt; This is a recurrent problem I've had for years now:
&gt;
&gt; 1.	I open a text window such an xterm or some other console window.
&gt; 	It doesn't seem to depend on which brand of window it is.
&gt;
&gt; 2.	I run "tail -f logfile" in the window. This includes various
&gt; 	system error message files, web log files, procmail log files
&gt; 	and so forth.
&gt;
&gt; 3.	From time to time, I hit the return key a couple of times
&gt; 	to make a visual gap in the text so that I can see what I have
&gt; 	already read and what is new.
&gt;
&gt; 4.	After a few days, all keyboard input to the window ceases to
&gt; 	have any effect. The output from "tail" continues completely
&gt; 	as normal. But even if I hit control-C, control-Z etc., or
&gt; 	even ~. in ssh etc., there's absolutely no response.
&gt; 	So I have to just clsoe the X window and start again.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone happen to know what could make this happen or how to fix
&gt; it?

No, but you might be able to track it down.  Try running 

  stty &lt; /dev/pts/3 -a

(assuming the window in question is /dev/pts/3) from another xterm
window to see what the settings are.  You should also be able to set
them that way, but Linux doesn't seem to let me do it:

  # stty -a &lt;/dev/pts/3 intr ^J
  stty: when specifying an output style, modes may not be set

Still, it might give you some idea what's going wrong.  It's a good
idea to save a copy of the state when it's running normally, so you
can see what's changed.

&gt; My first thought was that the "tail" program was experiencing some
&gt; sort of buffer blockage on standard input. But that is almost
&gt; certainly not the problem. Signals from the keyboard would surely
&gt; clear that.

You can also try killing the process with an appropriate signal:

  $ ps aux|grep tail
  grog     13749  0.0  0.3  1476  556 pts/4    S    11:51   0:00 tail -f /var/log/
  grog     13759  0.0  0.3  1388  476 pts/3    S    11:52   0:00 grep tail
  $ kill -SIGINT 13749
