Few things to add:

if I was going to do this (and I have considered it) - I'd probably want 
to have the following features:
- at least 2 pcmcia or one pcmcia and usb [preferably 2 usb buses]
- this gives you a wireless card in one slot and extra ethernet or 
modem/adsl off a USB.  If you only have PCMCIA then you can have a wireless 
card and a usb pcmcia card.  These obviously use more power, but it enables 
you to have the whole lot selfpowered and no plug packs or reliance on a 
UPS.

&gt; This'd give you about (let say) an hour or so just by itself, then most of 
&gt; them are/can be driven off around 12v, so worse comes to worse you can drive 
&gt; it from a car!  Laptops are designed to be low power, so a UPS should keep 
&gt; it up for a while and they have the advantage that the power can be 
&gt; disconnected/reconnected without rebooting - eg. to a cheap petrol generator 
&gt; or solar cells.

&gt; &gt; Just on the subject of the NY/Canada power outage, it occurred to me
&gt; &gt; that although the phone system is designed (at least it was before
&gt; &gt; semi-privatisation) for survival even in wars, and is powered by
&gt; &gt; a triple power supply (mains/batteries/generator), most people's
&gt; &gt; computers are not going to last 24 or 48 hours without mains power.
&gt; &gt; The phone will work but the computers won't.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; A UPS will generally give up in an hour or so. The laptops will generally
&gt; &gt; give up in a couple of hours.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So maybe, just maybe, a linux PDA could be the solution. The idea would be
&gt; &gt; to have a large pack of batteries to keep a PDA going as a combined
&gt; &gt; firewall/router/mail-server. Then this could be the gateway for the
&gt; &gt; home network under normal circumstances, but during a long black-out, it
&gt; &gt; would be the only machine working. The idea would be that you could
&gt; &gt; send/receive text e-mails and browse the web to find out what's going on
&gt; &gt; out there. Right now, a lot of people in north-east america might be wishing
&gt; &gt; they had some such thing.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My questions are:
&gt; &gt; Is there anything obviously wrong with this idea?
&gt; &gt; And has anyone tried it?
&gt; &gt; And which kind of linux PDA would be best for this role?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The first thing that occurs to me is that linux PDAs might be set up as
&gt; &gt; single user mode machines. (I think I read this somewhere once.)
&gt; &gt; But that shouldn't make it impossible for the above gateway role.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; When the big box of 48 batteries runs out, one could even resort to
&gt; &gt; recharging or powering with a bicycle, if one had such technology to hand.
&gt; &gt; But I don't plan to do that.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm just curious in casual sort of way. I don't want to start a riot....
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Alan Kennington.
