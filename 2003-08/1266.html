helloa,
	i've been using (yosemite's) tapeware to backup a small linux network 
based on an old redhat server. having recently advanced the server OS to 
debian Woody w/2.4.x kernel, i had some initial problems getting 
tapeware up and running. their tech support approach seemed to imply 
that they had no real interest in supporting the software on non-windows 
boxes beyond proforma testing with a few 'canned' kernels shipped with 
distros. however, the tips they provided eventually got something up and 
running - still problems building a 'modern' kernel that will coexist 
with their closed source kernel modules though.

looking through the linuxsa archives and such sources as freshmeat 
reveals a plethora of open source solutions to replace tapeware, 
prominent being projects like AMANDA - which i have tried this week and 
found to be fairly clunky. for a bunch of reasons, none seem to match 
tapeware's sophistication for managing backup and easy restore (possibly 
this is a red rag to a mailing list...).

i'd like to briefly ask, what do people use to manage tape backups (in 
this case just a single mnaually loaded DDS3 drive) and is AMANDA the 
best open source solution available - or should i look harder?

thanks,

   matt
