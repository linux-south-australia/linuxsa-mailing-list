Richard,

&gt; Suits me. I've been doing this for some time. Law and lawyers are
&gt; irrelevant and wrong. What's your point?

I see.

&gt; &gt; The system breaks when individuals or classes decide to get 
&gt; &gt; selective about what is lawful or not.
&gt; 
&gt; What sort of tripe is this? What if I want the system to break? Even
&gt; if I didn't, surely *not* questioning the law is asking for fascism?

You have missed my point.

I am making the point that disregarding the law simply because one
doesn't like it may not necessary be sensible, is almost certainly at
some stage going to end up being illegal and is likely to encourage
others to disobey laws one happens to agree with.

I'm not saying we shouldn't question the law.

In my opinion, people on this list are arguing not to my points but to
other extraneous points simply because I happen to have a relatively
logical, and almost certainly watertight case.

&gt; A) who gives a mouse poop if you call anyone anything, moronic,
&gt; ignorant or unlawful?

They generally react either on list or off list. Trust me, they do care.

&gt; B) is "unlawful" supposed to be a good or a bad thing?

Unlawful is just that. Unlawful. I suppose that murdering people is
unlawful, but murdering someone we all as a class don't like is all
right going by these arguments.

&gt; C) whose opposition to what awarding of what patent? I didn't think
&gt; there was any awarding of any patent that was being discussed here. I
&gt; thought there was a court case regarding the upholding of the claim a
&gt; patent holder has over some idea that Microsoft was found to have used
&gt; without licensing. People on /. appear to be opposing the decision
&gt; made by the judge, because they believe software patents to be wrong.
&gt; What is your problem with that?

The law is an ass and the original ideas in implementing patent law, in
my opinion (and better expressed by Alan Kennington), should still be
upheld. Which means--moderate that I happen to be politically (1)--that
I'd prefer to see the law reformed not thrown out.
