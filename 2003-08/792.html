Hi All,
&gt; "Our servers, powered by Intel processors, are now available with the
&gt; server OS on a CD. Its a small thing, but it's huge"
&gt;
&gt; The mind boggles. What did they supply their server OS on before?
&gt; Floppies?. this is a new feature for HP?
&gt;
    Since the ad is for HP servers then the technology for them IS advanced.
It wasn't that long ago that everything they did was custom and definitely
proprietary. Using someone else's processor - like Intel, is a HUGE step
forward for them in the SERVER market (translate probably mainframe), micros
and minis not so much. I think you would find that HP, like almost every
other mainframe manufacturer, probably supplied their operating system and
all their other software on Magnetic Tape. Don't laugh - it is still one of
the best ways of doing mass storage, and on commercial Tape Data Drives -
not Tape Backup units, it is almost as good as a modern disk pack. In large
mainframe using organizations - change is slow. The technology is advancing,
but most of these organizations need to support legacy systems far more than
modern, sleeker smaller organizations. Lets face it Cobol still exists
because many of these organizations are not willing to spend money on
completely rewriting all the software - it is cheaper to patch the existing,
working system. BTW, it wouldn't surprise me if some large organizations
still use drum mass storage (the modern updated type), and you would
probably still find some places with data and facilities for 8 inch
floppies. Banks and Governments are notorious for this kind of thing.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
