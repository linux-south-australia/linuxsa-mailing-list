Yes. It is the ical server that is the heart of the problem. I am 
looking too. If there was a single critical problem that needs 
mindshare/funding to get linux ready for corporates this may be the one 
most overlooked.

Your choices at the moment for a server with exchange like functionality 
are pretty much all commercial and expensive AFAIK.

<A HREF="http://reefknot.sourceforge.net/">http://reefknot.sourceforge.net/</A> looked interesting. There was an 
opencap project as well.

The protocol looks very complicated to me which is always a worry.

apple ical and mozilla can share a calendar with webdav/ftp (not sure 
how well that works). If mozilla had all the rough edges removed and the 
calendaring was a solid as the email would you swap from Outlook client?

&gt; and what it does.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Find a server that can speak the standard iCal whatsit and you've got 
&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt; you wanted.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Yep.
&gt; 
&gt; I have looked, I have not found anything appropriate.
&gt; 
&gt; As I've said a few times now - I've BEEN looking for the server part of 
&gt; the functionality.  If you can point me to a decent, free, ical based 
&gt; server I'm happy to give it a go, but I'm yet to find one that does what 
&gt; I want/need.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, I'm looking for the server side of the functionality.  I know 
&gt; what clients are available and what they do.
