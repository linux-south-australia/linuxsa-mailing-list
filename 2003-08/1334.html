&gt; Hi all,  I have a comment or two about this I'd like to share in a non-inflamatory way...

oh grrr;))

&gt; Dan may have a point, or he may not.  It doesn't really matter.

oh it does to us - we work hard to help people, its distressing that
someone feels badly treated, and it feels worse not being adequately
informed.
&gt; 
&gt; The point I'd like to make is that there's at least one "customer" of
&gt;  Computerbank that is very disgruntled.  It's fine for you to disagree
&gt;  with his comments, but you should examine them to see if you can do
&gt;  what you do better.  He *might* have valid concerns about customer
&gt;  service.  Or he may not.  You should consider both possibilities. 
&gt;  Responding with legal threats when public criticism is made is
&gt;  something not even Microsoft do :)

we have attempted to, and again offered, to help this person acheive a
satisfactory outcome. the main objection here from our point of view is:
1) one customer, who has faled to keep us involved in the process,
doesnt actually reflect on us, more on the failure of adequate
communication of her problems.
2) how it reflects on linux advocacy and our reputation is somewhat
unfair, as we werent kept imformed of ongoing problems. i accept that
the person had her reasons, but they are somewhat baffling, as we kept
making all efforts to go to her, pick up, fix, return, repeat as
necessary ad infinitum.... 
3) posting top linuxsa griping instead of to us first was premature at
best, flamebait/troll at worst..

and we, as ever, (despite perceptions!) continue to offer any assistance
we can...

legal recourse isnt necessary, (we arent sco after all;)  )
i think robyn's point was more about dan's sig....

&gt; I support Computerbank (with my junk :-) but even volunteer-run
&gt;  organisations need to listen to their customers, even if claims made
&gt;  are not based in fact (and I'm not saying whether Dan's were or
&gt;  weren't).

one man's junk, dude....;)
&gt; 
&gt; Just my 2 cents,

no gst included????
