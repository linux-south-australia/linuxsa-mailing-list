&gt; Ha!  From an old Python mailing list posting:

&gt; &gt; Stereotyping Fortran programmers as somehow less likely than anyone else

C      YES I AGREE.  I STARTED OUT PROGRAMMING IN FORTRAN ON A TOPS-10 S  000100
C      YSTEM AND OTHER SIMILAR MACHINES.  ALTHOUGH, I MUST ADMIT, I STIL  000200
C      L HAVE SOME BAD HABITS I PICKED UP FROM THOSE OLD DAYS, BY AND LA  000300

That  certainly  does bring  back  the  memories  - especially  the  line
numbering in hundreds  to permit later insertion of  additional text. The
numbering was necessary in  case you dropped all your cards  on the floor
and  had to  put them  through  a sorter.  Except that  us poor  students
couldn't afford to use the sorter, of course.

By the way, I finally worked out how  to get ludwig to be my mutt editor.
And the  result is that  the nastiest paragraph  in my previous  mail now
formats nicely to the following.

   Analysts at  the show  said that  SCO's lawsuit  was having  a small,  if
   measurable, impact  on Linux customers.  Forrester Research  Inc. analyst
   Ted  Schadler said  that  about one-quarter  of the  Linux  users he  had
   surveyed reported that  the lawsuit had at least slowed  down their Linux
   deployments.  Schadler  said  this was  chiefly  occurring  as  companies
   consulted with lawyers and evaluated  their legal liabilities, a response
   that he viewed as  prudent. "If you're going to procure  open source, you
   ought to be asking these questions," he said.

That looks much  nicer than all on  one line, although MS  users complain
when I do nice formatting, or even when  my lines are split at 80 chars -
it makes if more difficult for them to copy/paste into their documents.


CHeers once more,
ak.
