Michal,

&gt; Your email Joseph has me interested.  What do you use your homemade
FPGA
&gt; board for, and how much did it cost to build?  Was it cheaper/better
to make
&gt; yourself rather than seek out a commercial design? (if one exists)

In summary the device is a development board with support for PCI bus
(32-bit, 33Mhz), SDRAM (single 3.3V SDR SDRAM header), Xilinx Spartan
IIE 300K gate FPGA and a PIC 16LF876 microcontroller (which runs a I2C
bus), and a 50 pin IDC header for future expansion. The PCB is 4 layers
with a separate 3.3V/1.8V and ground plane.

The reason why I did the board was to do something neat and try out HDL
logic designs on www.opencores.org and other sites. Also I was
interested in learning more about Linux internals, so writing a device
driver to a PCI device was one way of doing it.

There are good development boards out there. The one I liked most was
from this Australian company.

<A HREF="http://www.burched.biz/">http://www.burched.biz/</A>

Their 300K Spartan IIE is the same chip I used.

The reason why I did my own was because 

1. My workplace had some left over chips and pieces from a previous
project. So I bought the extras for this personal home project on the
condition that I wouldn't commercialise my design. 

I'm currently testing the board, if this board works I'll be making the
schmatics, PCB files, test VHDL code, Linux driver, design documentation
available on the web.

2. Try finding a FPGA development board with a PCI interface and SDRAM
support for less than $1500. I searched around and couldn't find one for
less than AUD$2500. 

The cost of the parts were about AUD$200 per board. I've made 3 PCBs
which cost me minimally because they went in on a production run of
another project at work.

Currently the hardware is done. I can see the device in Linux and write
to the PCI bridge registers. The FPGA works with my test code. Now I
have to test the other bits (cross my fingers). I'm currently working on
the device driver and test programs. All in all it has been a lot of
work.

I have some shots during development:

&gt; Hmm,  I replied to Jarrad that I built an EPROM programmer three years ago

&gt; can be modified for upto 1Mbit, but the modifications were quite intense.

&gt; &gt; You appear to work at DSTO. If you're not programming very often how
&gt; &gt; about seeing your boss and seeing about finding a programmer on site.
&gt; &gt; That's what I did for my homemade FPGA PCI board's bridge EEPROM.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi list,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know this is a bit off topic but does anyone have any info
&gt; &gt; &gt; on a source of cheap eprom programmers. I'm just looking for
&gt; &gt; &gt; something simple that can read and write 27C256-512 devices
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I don't really need a thousand dollar 'programs everything
&gt; &gt; &gt; including the fridge' unit. second hand is ok and yes I've
&gt; &gt; &gt; already checked ebay
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Either that or has anyone seen plans to make your own?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; any help would be greatly appreciated
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; regards
&gt; &gt; &gt;
