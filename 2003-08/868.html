Let's hope their new trade in coffee can boost their economy a bit. A
donation or loan from somewhere would probably help. 

Linux, whilst freely distributed to, for and by individuals, isn't free for
corporations, right? That would mean there'd be licensing fees associated
with RH or whatever. Wouldn't they have to pay something no matter which way
they go? Mind you, the licensing of Linux would certainly cost a hell of a
lot less than Windows..............

The question is then, how much can they afford to pay? Maybe some obscure
decommissioned OS and hardware would do the job for them. I'd be happy to
donate my Amiga 2000. I mean it's functional, has games/apps and a modem.
I'd miss it terribly but hey, for a higher cause....... :-) Mind you, that's
hardly a long-term solution.

While I hear what Corey is saying, a post from Lev in ET this morning lets
us 
know that:
"Our Ministry has a quoatation on how much licensing will cost. It's $55K.
So, either we sack 1/3 of the staff, adopt freely distributable software or
run the risk of prosecution."

ET is a POOR country. Thats why its an issue too!

&gt; To be honest, I think the biggest problem here is the issue of 
&gt; support. M$ support their products for years whereas Red Hat, by way 
&gt; of example, supports their server and professional products for a year 
&gt; I believe. And of course, M$ techs are EVERYWHERE.
&gt;
&gt; If one person in a small organisation is trained as a sysadmin for 
&gt; Linux and, say, SuSE was available to use, it could work. There will 
&gt; be some teething troubles (particularly since the M$ juggernaut will 
&gt; want to snare the market before anyone else could give them any other 
&gt; choice) but it could potentially work because everything from 
&gt; productivity apps (OO.org) to accounting software (GnuCash) to 
&gt; browsers (Moz, Konquerer, Opera, etc)is covered by most Linux 
&gt; versions. The Linux community has in fact bent over backwards to make 
&gt; their products work with M$ products and have got nothing of the sort 
&gt; in return.
&gt;
&gt; Training up some coders or hiring some to write some customised 
&gt; software (or modify existing software) would probably help too. It's 
&gt; not impossible, just difficult.
&gt;
&gt; Incidentally, I recently picked up some Tradewinds East Timorese 
&gt; coffee. Strange taste, almost a citrus flavour. I assume that their 
&gt; coffee crops were kept near an orange grove. Plunged, this coffee 
&gt; rocks. Just thought I'd let people know. :-) I'm well aware of Linux 
&gt; geeks' affinity for a decent coffee drop. Hey, LinuxFormat had a 
&gt; section for best coffee in their yearly awards!

&gt;
&gt; interesting - the  law changes, and someone suggests MORE ms to fux 
&gt; the problem.
&gt;
&gt; can ppl PLEASE summarise for me a simple argument in favour of linux? 
&gt; we in computerbank have started the process over there the last few 
&gt; weeks with the
&gt;
&gt; completion of our timorese project, but boy, a concise, simple, easy 
&gt; to follow summary would help at this point.
&gt;
&gt; and im asking for as much input as we can get - we have a chance to 
&gt; help a country get into the benefits of linux.
