&gt; &gt; But cvsup is incredibly easy to get going and requires little bandwidth 
&gt; &gt; (updating over dialup is not onerous).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Install the package when you install freebsd, get networking going, and 
&gt; &gt; type:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; cvsup -h cvsup.au.freebsd.org /usr/share/examples/cvsup/ports-supfile
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; That's not hard.
&gt; 
&gt; apt is preinstalled by Debian. It's an essential package and it's difficult
&gt; to remove it. I agree that CVSUP isn't hard - it's just not installed by
&gt; default.

I don't see the point of spending forty hours compiling software ...

I've spent/wasted years porting and re-compiling software to get
little things working. And it is not the option I would choose if
you have a couple of hundred servers to maintain. Been there, done that,
had enough.

This is the modern age guys... compile-a-thons are for developers and 
package maintainers. They know the software and the dependecies.

However, it is different if you need specific options that are not compiled
in by default. Which is often a problem under Redhat and FreeBSD and Debian [1].
But, under Debain [2] you have a separate/alternative package (for example) that
has SSL compiled in ... it just takes package maintainers with a clue to 
figure out what you are likely to need and the combinations of things that are
going to be used together. 

cheers,

Kim
