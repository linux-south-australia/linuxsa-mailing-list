Hi Andrew,

It sounds like your 'UserDir' directive or the permissions on the
'/home/andrew' directory,

apache is probably running as 'nobody' or similar (a user with limited
permissions) so at least:
directories need r-x for 'other'
files need r-- for 'other'

If you like send me your httpd.conf file and I'll take a look,

hope this helps,

kind regards,

Luke

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     I am doing some CGI developing as part of my Uni course and I wanted to
&gt; do some work on my Toshiba Laptop. I have a very nice new RH9.0 install
&gt; going with Apache 2.0.42 (I think - 2. something anyhow) up and running.
&gt; 
&gt;     My question is about getting Apache to serve web pages and scripts from
&gt; my home directory. I could just change to Apache config file to just point
&gt; DocumentRoot to the home directories since it is a single user installation,
&gt; but I am not happy with that solution as it would break normal operation of
&gt; serving pages from the normal directory, and I eventually want to use my new
&gt; found knowledge on my home server and so I want to know how can I get Apache
&gt; to serve pages in the normal way AND from a home directory.
&gt; 
&gt;     At present, I have turned off the security feature that normally
&gt; prevents Apache serving home directories and I have set up the appropriate
&gt; public_html directory in my home directory. When I try to get a directory
&gt; listing through my browser of this directory, using <A HREF="http://mymachine/~user/,">http://mymachine/~user/,</A>
&gt; I get an error about not having permissions for this directory, but the
&gt; Apache error log says the error is trying to connect to a non-existing
&gt; directory, i.e. DocumentRoot - /var/www/html/~user. How do I fix this?
&gt; 
&gt;     Can I have multiple DocumentRoot paths running concurrently? If I added
&gt; DocumentRoot /home/ then this would probably fix the problem, but wouldn't
&gt; this cause a confliction or override the initial DocumentRoot setting? If I
&gt; was setting up multiple web sites from the same machine then I would set
&gt; DocumentRoot up specifically in the VirtualHosts part of the config, but
&gt; surely I shouldn't have to do that?
&gt; 
&gt;     Anyhow, what I want is to set Apache up so I can serve the normal web
&gt; pages (if any) from <A HREF="http://www.mymachine">http://www.mymachine</A> AND <A HREF="http://mymachine/~user/">http://mymachine/~user/</A> . Any
&gt; help would be most appreciated.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.
