Richard,

&gt; &gt; In my opinion, people on this list are arguing not to my 
&gt; &gt; points but to other extraneous points simply because I happen 
&gt; &gt; to have a relatively logical, and almost certainly watertight case.
&gt; 
&gt; No, you don't. You are not reading emails on this topic, and are spouting
&gt; off on tangents of your own.

I beg to differ, nonetheless...

&gt; It's the tyranny of the majority, or the powerful, or influential.
&gt; However you look at it, it's tyranny, and if you don't agree with it, you
&gt; must resist in whatever way you are able.

Obviously. There's a well worked case that the United States of America and
some of its allies have oppressed the Islamic world to the extent where
terrorism (by flying planes into buildings, bombing night clubs or
attempting to make hotels collapse) is the "only" way out.

Is this the only way that these people are able to make their point? What
about all the people in Australia and worldwide who went to peaceful, legal
protests to attempt to stop this from happening?

One only needs about 10% of the population to mobilise, unite and work
within the legal system legally to make the system change. Only 1 in 10
people. Remember that.

&gt; OK, that's your first valid opinion, different but equivalent to those
&gt; being expressed by others. Well done. :)

In your opinion that is my first valid opinion [which was essentially that
the law is an ass]. All of our opinions are valid but some might disagree
with mine.

That's life, as they would say.

Patent law is troublesome but the original reason for its creation was never
so that large or small companies could use it as an offensive weapon against
each other. I think it's important to make this point without advocating the
wilful disregard of the current patent law.
