 &gt; This withdrawal example(select and update). If it is done in one

 &gt; selecting and updating etc.

But that's an abysmally sub-optimal solution on a busy site:  By locking
the tables, you're guaranteeing that NOBODY ELSE can do any deposits or
withdrawls anywhere in your entire bank while that transaction is in
progress.  You're essentially turning a nice parallel thread-based access
model into a degenerate sequential model, and that'll have ridiculous 
performance implications as your site scales.

You need *row locking*, not *table locking*.  Even better, locking for
individual cells.  Anything with worse granularity than a row is going 
to slow you down to the point where any speed advantage you get by using
mysql is utterly worthless.

 &gt; The query with the deposit will then wait
 &gt; and not time out until the tables are unlocked or until the thread is
 &gt; closed(which ever comes first). More programming work than an RDBMS to
 &gt; make sure its all done correctly, but it can be done and will still end

And, of course, if you accidentally leave something out, you can either
reach the point where your database deadlocks against itself because you
forgot to release a lock, or you can do transactions which you've forgotten
to acquire locks for and produce the exact data-smashing situation which
made locks attractive in the first place.

It's much easier to let the database care about that stuff.

 &gt; up cheaper/quicker than most RDBMS.

I disagree.  It'll only be quicker if your site isn't very popular (you
do want popular sites, don't you?).  Also, it'll almost never be cheaper:
You actually need to go to special lengths to do your locking, extra
testing, extra development, etc, etc, and someone has to pay for that.  If
you use a database which supports transactions, however, you get all that
for free because the database engine is looking after locks for you.

 &gt; &gt; I submit that it's possible to design around that limitation, so you
 &gt; &gt; can still have fast response. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Can you tell me, give some examples. Im very interested in more ideas
 &gt; on ways to do things.

That all depends on the specific situation, doesn't it? :-)  That's
why DBAs and database application authors get paid lots of cash to 
design good systems.

In the end, though, it'll come back to data modelling, and a thorough
understanding of how an RDBMS implements the various things you ask it
to do. For example, by simply changing the order of a comple of nested
SELECT statements you can sometimes cut down on the amount of unindexed
data your RDBMS needs to search to perform a query by a factor of hundreds
of thousands.  See the ars-technica article link Dan provided a couple
of days ago for some good examples of that (sorry, I deleted his message
after reading the article)
