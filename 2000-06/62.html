So you'll spend $50 on a custom cable instead? :-)

You can pick up a cheap crimping tool from Dick Smith for about $15.

 &gt; Question 2:
 &gt; Flash rom/ram with IDE interface.
 &gt; Someone mentioned some time earlier that there's such a
 &gt; thing as a flash ram or rom module with an IDE interface.
 &gt; I just can't remember who told me and in what context.
 
I told you.

 &gt; Does anyone know where you get these flash ram/rom modules
 &gt; which have IDE interfaces in Adelaide?

We get them pre-installed in the embedded-systems platforms we 
buy from ICP (Industrial Computer Products) in Sydney.  I'm not 
sure who their supplier is, but you could always call them to find
out.

ICP are really great -- They sell the hardware you want pre-configured
to order, and they are capable of doing wierd configurations.  They
specialize in industrial-type systems, very sturdy, very small, very
light or very low-power.  At work we get complete PC systems with
CompactFlash disks and 3 PCI slots in enclosures about the size of a 
lunchbox.

 &gt; This is all part of my little linux/atm high-speed shaper
 &gt; module project. Ejecting the disk drive should increase
 &gt; reliability a fair bit.

Indeed - no moving parts whatsoever.

 &gt; Has anyone out there actually done any MP3 file creation
 &gt; under linux? If so, what do you use?
 &gt; I've got a copy of the bladeenc software, which
 &gt; I plan to build some day. But there seems to be a dearth
 &gt; of MP3 software out there. Whenever I follow links in
 &gt; places like freshmeat.net and icewalkers.org etc., they seem
 &gt; to lead to software which has been withheld due to legal
 &gt; considerations.

bladeenc is useable but slow.  I use "gogo" on FreeBSD, which is about
five times faster.
