 &gt; &gt;  &gt; Don't know about Postgresql. But with Mysql, one reason for its good
 &gt; &gt;  &gt; speed/reliability is the fact that it was ALL written form scratch.
 &gt; &gt; Hey, wow!  That's the same argument MS uses when they explain why NT is
 &gt; &gt; better than UNIX!
 &gt; 
 &gt; I have nothing to do with sales and yet I have the natural talent of

 &gt; sales. What a complement. Thanks Mark.
 &gt; Or is it a criticism?

"Yes".  :-)

For what it's worth, the speed gains of mysql (which have been shrinking
as PostgreSQL improves) are due more to the fact that it doesn't support
features which most people think are actually mandatory features of a 
database, most notably including its lack of support for transactions.
Transactions are "hard" to implement, and necessarily involve a performance
loss, but the mysql developers have consciously chosen to not support them,
so they don't pay the speed penalties that real databases like PostgreSQL
must pay.

One thing to be very careful of when using a database for a web site
backend is that web pages are, by the nature, accessed in parallel;  so,
if you have any multiple-write updates to do in the course of running
the site, you're left with three alternatives:

       1. mysql, and just put up with random data corruption from 
	  transactions which are smashed by multiple simultaneous 
	  updaters;  

       2. mysql with wrappers around SQL operations to do shared and
	  exclusive locking, eg:

		$lck = establish_shared_lock();
		$dbt = $dbi-&gt;prepare("select ...");
		$dbt-&gt;execute();
		# handle results;
		$dbt-&gt;finish();
		release_shared_lock($lck);
	  and:

		$lck = establish_exclusive_lock();
		$dbt = $dbi-&gt;prepare("update ...");
		$dbt-&gt;execute();
		# handle results
		$dbt-&gt;finish();
		release_exclusive_lock($lck);

      3. Use a real database which supports transactions.

Option 1 is frankly unacceptable.  Even if you say, "But it really 
doesn't matter, it's only a web site..." sooner or later a lack of 
explicit transaction handling will bite you in the arse.

Option 2 is also unacceptable in all but the simplest of cases:  In 
many cases doing your own locking will involve a greater performance
loss than using a real database, and if you get the locking wrong you
either leave some transactions unprotected (see option 1) or cause
deadlocks.

Option 3 is simple:  You get concurrency issues solved "for free", the
code doesn't cost any more, and in all likelihood your performance loss
is less than what you'd end up with if you handled your own locking.

As it happens, the rider above that option two can be acceptable in
the simplest of cases is often true for web site backends, which often
don't stress databases all that much.  However, if you ever find that a
single form submission from a user results in more than one discrete
SQL operation being processed by the backend, you run the risk of presenting
the user with worthless and wrong information at best, and corrupting 
the structure of your database at worst.

[ and yes, carlo, you probably know this stuff already; many other readers
  probably don't, though. ]
