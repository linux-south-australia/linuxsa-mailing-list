&gt; Did you understand the point I was trying to make? Stop being so
&gt; podantic.

No, I didn't earlier on, hence my request for clarification in an
earlier message (and I'm on fairly decent terms with regular
expressions).

Also, note those three funny punctuation symbols at the end of that
sentence:  ":-)" - it's known as a "smiley."

&gt; Agreed. The pattern I would have sendmail match would hopefully be
&gt; unique enough to limit this problem somewhat, but either way, I don't
&gt; mind.

Fair enough, it's your email system.  As someone has subsequently
noted (and I'm not sure if it was in jest or not), these emails are
tripping his virus alert system.  If so, that's qualityware at its
finest :-|.

I've just written a quick python script that extracts the content
type and disposition from a Mime encoded file, and prints it to
standard out.  For a given email message it returns something like:

multipart/alternative
message/rfc822 attachment "att00033.eml"
message/rfc822 attachment "att00037.eml"
message/rfc822 attachment "att00041.eml"
message/rfc822 attachment "att00045.eml"
message/rfc822 attachment "att00049.eml"

It's a little large to post to the list, so I'll post it to you in a
seperate message (if anyone else wants a perve, feel free to email me).
Only caveat at the moment is that it doesn't handle multifile within
multifile.


Regards,
  Daryl Tester
