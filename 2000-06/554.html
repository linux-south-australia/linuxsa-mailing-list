Brian et al:

&gt; Is it really true that this list is willing to respond to the sensitivities
&gt; of a person engaging in an unusual and unproductive sexual preference, but
&gt; openly scoffs at Christian principles?

I find this remark quite interesting. Before I decide how to respond to
it, I should ask you to clarify a number of points:

POINT ONE
What is your position at Flinders University and what do you research? 

POINT TWO
You are using a Flinders University e-mail account. Do Flinders
University have any policies relating to the use of an e-mail account
for:

* non-University related matters
* usage of e-mail for particular purposes

POINT THREE
Define unusual sexual preference.

POINT FOUR
Define unproductive sexual preference

You should also point me to the correct archives in which this list
"responded to a person engaging in an unusual and unproductive sexual
preference...". And messages relating to this particular thread don't
count. In the past you have chosen to respond quite scathingly and
personally to my own postings. Furthermore you have made allegations -
whether in jest or not - about my own sexuality. It would be difficult
to render the above quoted statement of yours in a fashion not meant to
deride "[people who engage] in an unusual and unproducrtive sexual
preference".

Given that you claim this list responds to those people's sensitivities,
I would like you to specify - without abusing me or any other people -
why I shouldn't begin the process to make the list respond?
