This is a message which appeared on the aussie-isp mailing list earlier
yesterday.  I thought people here might like it :-)  Ross is a reliable
source (as measured by most reasonable metrics :-), so I doubt we can
chalk this one  up to "urban legend".

I've cut a bit of stuff off the bottom of it, but apart from that this
is all in Ross' own words.

&gt; Subject: [Oz-ISP] FreeBSD and the forces of darkness. Real religious wars!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've got to tell someone about this.... I'm flabergasted!
&gt; 
&gt; A client of a client had their internet gateway machine (a Linux box)
&gt; hacked recently, and seriously compromised. Ok... totally screwed.
&gt; 
&gt; So, much panic, waving of arms and gnashing of teeth, and it was a case of
&gt; "drop everything and help" this poor school. The person who set up the
&gt; original box is on the other side of the continent and seems to be not
&gt; contactable, or something.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyhow, we helped. KNOWING the box had been hacked and WOULD be under
&gt; constant scrutiny, we suggested FreeBSD (now before we start any religious
&gt; wars here, yes, a linux box MAY be as secure as a FreeBSD box, assuming
&gt; both were set up by people familiar and competent with them both.... but
&gt; we're a FreeBSD site and not expert with Linux! Plus, it was compromised
&gt; as a Linux box, much better to change things a little while we're at it).
&gt; 
&gt; So the box was completely re-built. They moved the goalposts a couple of
&gt; times (changing how things needed to be set up AFTER it had been done, but
&gt; hey...). and now that it's all going and working..... they want to rip it
&gt; out and put linux back on again.
&gt; 
&gt; Why?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well.... I could start a guessing competition here.
&gt; 
&gt; And you guys (and girls) are NOT allowed to kill yourselves laughing
&gt; here... This is what the person actually typed:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; "I've just had a converstaion with xxxx xxxx (our Principal) about some
&gt; of the changes.  We've had to deal with some of the philosphical issues
&gt; related to BSD. As you know BSD uses a 'devil' icon to portray the BSD
&gt; symbol.  Given we are a Christian school this is a significant concern for
&gt; us.  Even after reviewing the sites blurb about the origin of the symbol,
&gt; we've come to the conclusion that it would not be appropriate for us to
&gt; use the software."
&gt; 
&gt; Can you believe it?!
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to "inform" them about the "mascot"....
&gt; 
&gt; "some of our parents who are very technically savvy would not care about
&gt; the disctinction.  It is the subliminal message the icon represents..."
&gt; 
&gt; And then the FreeBSD site itself fueled the fire:
&gt; 
&gt; "Even the site talks about a deamon being 'unleashed' in you computer blah."  
&gt; 
&gt; So that's that. No further discussion would be entered into. They've made
&gt; their decision..... with a parting shot that:
&gt; 
&gt; "what we need to concern ourselves with as a Christian school is the
&gt; 'message' or 'image' that may unwittingly be portrayd."

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
