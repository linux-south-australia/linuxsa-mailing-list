&gt; &gt; Firstly: I seem to be getting messages like the one below in my logs:

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; and I have no idea what a "martian source" is.

below is an excerpt from RFC 1812.

It appears to suggest that a martian source is where your machine is
setting the source address of a packet to be an "invalid" source address
(like 127.anything or 0/0, etc). try converting the above hex to decimal
and see if that helps at all. My guess is that it might contain the
naughty address and therefore point the finger.

Hope it helps,

5.3.7 Martian Address Filtering

   An IP source address is invalid if it is a special IP address, as
   defined in 4.2.2.11 or 5.3.7, or is not a unicast address.

   An IP destination address is invalid if it is among those defined as
   illegal destinations in 4.2.3.1, or is a Class E address (except
   255.255.255.255).

   A router SHOULD NOT forward any packet that has an invalid IP source
   address or a source address on network 0.  A router SHOULD NOT
   forward, except over a loopback interface, any packet that has a
   source address on network 127.  A router MAY have a switch that
   allows the network manager to disable these checks.  If such a switch
   is provided, it MUST default to performing the checks.

   A router SHOULD NOT forward any packet that has an invalid IP
   destination address or a destination address on network 0.  A router

   that allows the network manager to disable these checks.  If such a

   If a router discards a packet because of these rules, it SHOULD log

   the problem was with the source address, the physical interface on
   which the packet was received and the Link Layer address of the host
   or router from which the packet was received.
