Hi,

Life is interesting ... and then the tax man gets you by the short and
curlies.

I have just finished reviewing a 100 or so page chapter from a Linux book
by Mark Sobell which is about Managing TurboLinux from a practical point of
view.

My review pointed out a number of departures from reality, which is not
unusual for a first draft of a book, plus a problem of a lack of coherance
and diagrams, but I wish him well.  I enjoyed doing the review, mainly
because it is good to help ensure that what is written about Linux is the
whole truth and nutin' but the truth.

Then, just now I got an email from Marshall Rose, which reminded me that I
had missed out on meeting him back in April, and that I will never get to
meet Jonathan Postel or Richard Stevens.

Damn, two glasses of red wine, and I get all maudlin ...


Regards
