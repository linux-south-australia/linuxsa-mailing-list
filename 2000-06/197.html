Hi All,
    Emacs, vi and pico are all excellent software tools for
creating web pages. All you need after that is a good book
or instruction howto and you are away. All silliness aside,
my sister is doing Multimedia Studies at Uni (yes they give
you a degree for advanced web page design now), and she was
telling me that some HONOURS and 3RD YEAR students didn't
have a clue on how to actually write HTML because all
through their degree they only used these software tools to
create pages and small sites. My advice to you is take the
time to learn the hard way and you will be much better off.
For example, do these software tools know how to debug HTML
when the file is corrupted some way? I don't think so, but a
human who can create HTML with a text editor can usually
have the page back in no time. The other problem with these
tools is that they create pages very similar in 'look' each
time, to the extent that some of them you just look at the
page and you can say "Created with FrontPage" etc. Well I
suppose I haven't really answered your question, but maybe
this has given you some food for thought anyway.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt;New to creating Web Pages.
&gt;
&gt;Aside from Netscape Composer what good software packages
are available
&gt;for Linux users to create
&gt;a Web Page. Does KDE have anything ?
