&gt; Now, I have a few questions:

&gt; 1. Out of the BSD and Sys V Unices, which one is chronologically older?

Well,  this  is  a  tough one. Both share a common ancestor, AT&T Bell
Labs Unix Version 6.

In  1977  BSD  was  released.  Two  years  later,  Version  7 Unix was
released.  V7 shared some of the new BSD style goodies, but was mostly
an update from Version 6. This is where the tree split was.

System III evolved directly from Version 7 in 1982.
From BSD came 4.2 BSD in 1984 (descended directly from BSD).
System V Rel 2 was released in 1984 it evolved from System III.
4.3 BSD was released in 1985 (descended directly from 4.2 BSD).
System  V Rel 3 was unleashed in 1986, directly descended from System V
Rel 2.

(as  an  offshoot,  OSF/1  was released in 1992 and was descended from
Sys V.Rel 3 and 4.3 BSD.)

4.4 BSD, the lastest BSD, was released in 1993.
While Sys V Rel 4 (the latest Sys V) was unleashed in 1988.

(yeah ok, long winded but it puts some perspective on the question).

&gt; 4. There must be a relationship or some type of link between the BSD
&gt; Style Unices, System V Style Unices and POSIX. What is this
&gt; relationship?

POSIX  is an IEEE/ANSI standard. I believe it defines system calls and
some filesystem layout (/etc) but I could be wrong here...

&gt; 5. Is Linux compliant with any of the above standards?

Linux is mostly designed to be POSIX compliant.

&gt; 6. If one could administer a Linux System, such as one based on RedHat
&gt; 6.2, by command-line, could one with only minimal learning but no
&gt; experience, administer an enterprise Sun Solarise or HP-UX or IBM AIX
&gt; machine?

With considerable extra reading this may be possible.
Other  Unices  tend  to  use  completely different device names, and a
different structure to the /etc fs.

&gt; 7. Out of the following UNICES, which one is which standard? I'm going
&gt; to try and divide them into the right groups as I think but I'm not
&gt; certain:

&gt;   * SYSTEM V: Sun OS, Sun Solaris and IBM's AIX

Sun OS is actually derived from an early version of BSD.
Solaris broke away from that and followed the Sys V Rel 4 standards.
AIX  is  just  odd... It's mostly a Sys V variant, but it borrows from
4.x BSD and OSF/1.

&gt;   * BSD: HP-UX, Free/Open/NetBSD and BSD (is there such a beast?)

HP-UX  is  a  Sys  V variant. HP-UX 9 is a variant of Sys V Rel 3 (and
OSF/1) and HP-UX 10 is a variant of Sys V Rel 4.

&gt; 8. Of System V and BSD, which one is Linux most similar to or fully
&gt; compatible with (if that's the case)?

Neither.
It's  generally BSD like BUT different distributions tend to do things
slightly differently.
