&gt; One thing that annoys me with mail clients is that generally, they have
&gt; folders which you put messages into. A message can exist in only one folder,
&gt; unless it is copied to other folders. You can set up rules to do things for
&gt; you, like move and copy messages, etc. So suppose I have a message from a
&gt; friend, that came on a mailing list, I would like to have that message in
&gt; both the folder of messages from that friend, and in the folder from that
&gt; mailing list. But if I delete or reply to this message, I would like both
&gt; messages to have that marked.
&gt; 
&gt; What I really want is a mail client that lets me keep all my mail in one
&gt; "folder", but will give me many logical "views" of it -- views that can be
&gt; set up in a permanent way, like rules or filters, and that work faster than
&gt; searches... I'd like to be able to ask my mail client for all messages from
&gt; X, or all messages on the Y mailing list, or all messages on the Z thread,
&gt; and have it show me instantly. All the processing for this should be done in
&gt; advance, so there is little lag. I know that this sounds remarkably like
&gt; using a database for mail, and maybe that's what I wnat... Although it would
&gt; be best if the mail could be kept in as standard a format as possible, or at
&gt; least be easily (almost trivially) exported and imported.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of such a client? Would it require some server magic? In
&gt; fact, could one use something like an IMAP server to provide this to an IMAP
&gt; client transparently to the client? eg: have default folder names like "from
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</A>" and "about blah blah blah", so that the rules get
&gt; automatically created whenever a new message comes in... I can think of a
&gt; million other handy features that I would like, but... :)
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of any Clients (or IMAP servers) that would be able to do
&gt; something like this... Is there any reason why this is a stupid idea?
