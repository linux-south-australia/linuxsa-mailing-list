&gt;Am I correct in believing winmodems to be modems on a card that are
&gt;software driven rather than hardware driven i.e requiring Windoze to run.

sortof .... they aren't actually modems at all. They are more an interface card.
Rather than the good'ol trusty reliable modems with hardware controllers built
in all processing is done by software. Although this isn't such a problem for
those of us with speedy Pentium III's or AMD Athlons etc etc, on the reliability
issue, they can often drop out fairly often on slower processors, or if your
ISP doesn't fully comply with V.90 specs etc. The big problem is the chipset
manufacturers for these "winmodems" have agreements with monopolosoft where
they must keep all the specs behind doors, obviously to prevent competition
:-(
However, Lucent Technologies have written Binary Linux drivers for their winmodems,
and I believe the reverse engineering processes are going rather well in creating
opensource drivers for winmodems.

&gt;Or are there are external winmodems? 

I believe some of the cheap'n'nasty USB external modems are software modems.
I am not particularly sure, but I think the Star branded USB modems are winmodems.
Other than that, all external serial port modems are "Real"/hardware modems.


&gt;Can a laptop with an inbuilt winmodem
&gt;be told to use an ordinary old external serial port modem ?

Yes it can be. Just "ln -s /dev/ttys"YOUR CHOICE!" /dev/modem" !
or otherwise tell you dialer to use the modem at the serial port of your choice.
Otherwise you can also purchase a hardware pcmcia modem for your laptop which
you can use instead of the "winmodem".

Regards,
Jeremy
