List,

First thanks to all help received by numerous members of the list. It
was greatly appreciated.

The basic problem was ... the user :-). Not being a super smart
programmer I will list what appeared to fix the problem, not why.

1. The DPT patch must be patched from within the /usr/src/linux
directory. It often fails. I located a different one from a web site,
but did not record the address ... der. I can send a copy to anyone
interested.

2. The DPT i2o SCSI driver does not like to co-exist with the generic
EATA one.

3. "PCI Quirks" seems to effect the compile too (2.2.14)

4. Don't get over zealous when stripping out bits of the kernel, it's
very easy to get kernel panics. Take SMALL steps rather than big ones
when changing make menuconfig, keep the kernel revisions and notes.

Now that I have done this once in an operational environment I really
appreciate the power of OSS, all I need now is more knowledge and more
skills ... I don't think I could have got into as much trouble with M$,
but I wouldn't have had as much control either. You pay your money and
takes your choice, I know which way I will go from now one!

Once again, thanks to the list members who offered assistance.
