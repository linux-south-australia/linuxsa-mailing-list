Hi Everyone,


I have a quick question regarding file systems.

My main computer system here at home has a 20gb hard disk and a 4gb hard
disk.

I currently have it setup that I have 1.2gb of the 20gb to be my Fat32 Win98
Partition. The rest of that 20gb drive is split into:

5gb / ext2
10gb /mp3s ext2
3.8gb /home

and i think there's a  /boot and a swap parition in there somewhere too ...

and the 4.3gb hdd is a fat32 drive which i use to switch files between linux
and windoze.

Unfortuantly due to the fact there are a number of application in which i
need to use win98, moreso now that in the past, I'm starting to miss my MP3
collection when I'm in win98.

Okay, I know I could sit here for 3 weeks and backup all my mp3's to cd's
...

wipe the /mp3s partition and create a fat32 and spend another half a day
copying the files back from cd to hdd ...

but, I was hoping there would be an easier way of doing it ... eg,
converting Ext2 to Fat32... is this possible ???

As far as I know converting Ext2 to fat32 isn't possible, but if anyone
knows whether it is possible and have done it before I would love to know
how you did it, as i both don't have the time, nor can i be bothered backing
up my MP3's and re-copying them back again !
