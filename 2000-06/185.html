&gt; On another note, I have a Labtam Xterm (old, B&W, right price... $0.00)
&gt; that I want to use so that I can have a secong GUI display on my PC for
&gt; family to write email/whatever whilst I am busy working...  I see that
&gt; the thing uses some sort of dynamic IP allocation (DHCP?) and also
&gt; required some sort of boot image.  I can't supply model numbers off
&gt; hand, and it is too cold to walk to the other room to get them.  If
&gt; anyone can help email me off the list and I'll let you know the
&gt; models/serial numbers/whatever u need to help me.  On another note,
&gt; where would I find a webpage about such things?  Anyone know of a good
&gt; one?

The model i have, a CT300, can use a static ip as well, not sure about the older
b&w labtams. They do indeed require a boot image which i was very lucky (and
thankful) to obtain. I also have the MT300 boot image. Unfortunately labtam
Australia (www.labtam.com.au) still want $20 - $40 for ech boot image, even
though I bought the hardware for less than $4 a box. Seems ridiculous really.

Information about labtams seems extremely hard to find - I should put one up
myself. I'm by no means an experienced guru of linux, but managed to get it
working. There great little terminals too! :)

I will send you more info if you need it.
