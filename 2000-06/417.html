LinuxSA and the organisers of the LinuxSA InstallFest 2000 wish to thank
the many ISPs who offered to provide internet connections for the LinuxSA
InstalFest 2000.  We were quite overwhelmed by how very many offers we
received.

We also wish to thank Internode, who made the "winning" offer.  In addition
to bandwidth, they are also providng, quite by their own initiative, a
marvelous venue.

LinuxSA InstallFest 2000 will be held on Saturday, July 15, commencing at
10:00am and concluding at 4:00pm. The prime focus of the event will be to
install Linux, and we will also have a number of interesting speakers who
will make short presentations throughout the day.  We will give away many
CDs including Red Hat, TurboLinux, and Star Office; and a commemorative
t-shirt will be available at the event for a small fee.

LinuxSA would be extremely gratefull if you could help us publicise the
event by linking your home page to the official LinuxSA InsallFest 2000 web
page.  Our URL is <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/installfest2000/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/installfest2000/</A> and
we will update this page frequently.

I should also like to announce that we are conducting a competition to
design the commemorative t-shirt.  This competition runs for another week.
Please see <A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~tuxshirt/.">http://www.rebel.net.au/~tuxshirt/.</A>
