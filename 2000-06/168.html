ahh yes... the Internode/Agile offer..

As Mark said, myself and David Newall had a gander around the place tonight,
and thought it was pretty good... comments follow...

The venue itself is fine -- it used to be an art gallery, so looks
reasonably nice, and not much like a warehouse... The lane that you get
access from (york st) is a bit dodgy, but I think if we give clear
directions, and put signs up, etc, we should be OK (although it may still be
a drawback for some attendees)

Parking could be a problem still, but seems solvable (although rain would be
a pain in the arse). We are talking to Councillor Michael Arbison (sp?)
about a few things, and will ask him about getting access to an undercover
parking area right by the entrance (either for parking or just for dropoff)
and possibly free UPark parking... We'll get back to y'all on that one...

Heating can be solved with a gas-powered turbo heater that we can hire for
$50 or so... Lighting is excellent...

It appears to have about 4 separate double power points, with the option of
running some extension cords in from the Internode office. We make the
assumption that all these power points work, and hope that it is possible
for Mark to get back to us to confirm this... :) We'll need plenty of power
boards and extension cords no matter what. It's also possible to get power
from their computer room, so power is pretty much solved.

Internet access is excellent, as is potential for local caching...

Phone lines are not so promising... best we could do is hope for one or two
lines, although Internode/Agile are likely to be concerned about the cost we
could incur... Also, they will still have the "0" prefix of PABX systems, so
won't be completely

Subject: InstallFest venue offer - pictures


&gt; There has been some discussion of the InstallFest venue offer made
&gt; by Internode and Agile recently.  Yesterday I noted that lots of the
&gt; criticisms it had attracted from some people were being made in the
&gt; complete absence of anyone having actually seen it.
&gt;
&gt; To address this, Richard Russell and David Newall visited this afternoon
&gt; and I gave them a bit of a look-see.  I'm sure they'll be commenting on
&gt; their impressions in due course;  I wont' preempt them here.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, for the benefit of those who weren't there, I've put a series
&gt; of pictures up at <A HREF="http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/31york">http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/31york</A>
&gt;
&gt; Apologies for the lighting;  it was a dull day and it didn't occur
&gt; to me to turn on the floodlights, ok? :-)

&gt;      but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
