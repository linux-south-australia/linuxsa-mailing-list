i'm sorry, unusual "unproductive"...that sounds like a value judgement
from
someone who is asking for tolerance to their beliefs.

why bring personal sexual preference into this debate?
do you produce more off spring everytime you engage in (and i probably
suspect hetrosexual here) sex.

no i don't think so, in fact most of the time i'd say you engage in
"futile reproduction" too. 

i respect the rights of christians or any other religion to hold their
beliefs, but the attack on homosexuality is a bit much.

i think this thread has long since drifted from the original purpose,
which i think was a joke about the devil icon of bsd. 

slightly amusing, yes...grounds for a serious debate and attack on
personal beliefs and sexual practice no.

i sincerely hope Brian is not one of those christians who belive in love
and peace at the same time as damming all homosexuals to a life of
dammnation in hell, (why you might even catch some members of your
religion in that net)

i dont think we need religious intolerance or homophobia in the list.

&gt; 
&gt; I don't think it is true.  I think it might have been a different list (is
&gt; there an echo in here?) and if some of us scoffed it was probably at the way
&gt; Christians so often display ignorance of their own principles.
&gt; 
&gt; I never noticed you to be a boor before, Brian.  Define "unusual." Anything
&gt; less than 50%?  I suspect most people enjoy some sexual act or fantasy
&gt; (which is a better definition of "preference" than that which nature
&gt; dictates) which is unusual by this defintion.  Unproductive?  If you refer
&gt; to gay sex, and I'm sure you are, there's nothing unproductive about it.
&gt; It burns off calories; is a lot of fun; helps two (or more) people to stay
&gt; close (pardon the pun); and can sometimes be nutritous.  In short it's
&gt; pretty similar to straight sex.  Did you mean unreproductive?  No, that's
&gt; what (you hope) happens with contraceptives.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a fact.  Gays never systematically tortured people for refusing to
&gt; "follow the faith."  It seems somehow evil, don't you agree?, for an
&gt; organisation to force it's beliefs upon others, specifically when those
&gt; others aren't hurting anybody, and are maybe even living by the cannons of
&gt; that organisation.  "Do as I say, not as I do," is surely time honoured.
&gt; Especially in religious circles.
&gt; 
&gt; Wow, you really seem to have struck a nerve with me. :-)
