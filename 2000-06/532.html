Depending on your budget ... NEVER TOUCH SECOND HAND MONITORS :

reasons behind this:

1. Warranty = NONE ! (or maybe 30 days if its reconditioned ... goodie !)
2. How many people are actually wanting to sell a perfectly good working 17"
or 19" monitor. Often there is a motive behind someone wanting to off load a
17" or 19" monitor ... thsese often include:

	a) Shown signs of tube/power failure
	b) picture quality becoming poorer
	c) it's an ex-government/business/company screen that's been used full time
during office hours and is due for retirement.

3. Monitors aren't often known to be the longest lasting of all components.
How many people do you know who have bought a monitor and it's failed the
day after the three year warranty has expired ??

To give you an idea on pricing on brand new 17" and 19" monitors :

Cheap Generic 17" 0.27dpi $400 3year warranty
Cheap Generic 17" 0.20dpi Super Flat Screen $505 3 year warranty
Cheap Generic 19" 0.25dpi $750

These monitors i've listed are all OEM montiors which are often made using
seconds tubes, whether it's a few dead pixles etc ... I use a 19" generic
OEM screen and I'm actually very happy with it.

However ... I was tight when i bought my screen. If you want a good monitor
17" or 19" to be a long lasting screen I would recommend purchasing a screen
using original good components such as an LG montior, or if funds are loose,
Sony Trinitron. Altough your investment is almost double ... it'll save you
in the long run !

If you want to email me off the list advising of your budget, I can point
you in the right direction of where you could pick up a good new screen, or
where to go to get a reasonable second hand screen.

Hi I am looking to get a larger than 15" monitor.  I am finding that linux
on
this sized monitor really sucks.  I have been borrowing an old tektronix
20inch
monitor from work and that seems to do the job quite nicely.  Maybe auctions
have them, I know most organisations regularly update their sun and xterm
hardware.

regards

   Matthew Mills
