I don't know how many care about this, but there seems to be more titles
around in !English.  People who read German and Spanish tell me that there
are numerous titles in both. The circulation figures for the
Polish-lanaguage magazine was pretty amazing three years ago, hopefully it
is doing even better now. At least some of these cover BSD as well. Etc.
If you can get by in a European language then it is worth looking around
on the web.

There are three quite good magazines in French that I've seen, plus
several more I haven't seen, plus at least one that is largely translated
from English. I don't know about the other languages but the French ones
can be delivered to Australia at reasonable cost. I have wondered about
getting several copies at once if other people are interested - let me
know by private email.
