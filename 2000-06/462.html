If you can, either reduce that to 16 bit, or increase it to 32 bit. 24bit
colour is not supported very well in *most* of the svga drivers. It tends to be
the last item developed for any specific driver, if at all. Additionally,
Netscape hates it. Almost all 24 bit drivers are simply kludged by their
authors to handle a 16 bit colour table.

&gt;         plugs I find less useful. network card is etherpro100 so I
&gt;         don't anticipate problems.

The module driver comes standard with most distros 

&gt;       - Sound doesn't work at all, sndconfig says that it
&gt;         can find an Intel chipset but it is unsupported. 

If this is the I810a series, no, probably not. A quickfix is to pay the $20 or
so and get the OSS/4Front sound drivers. They are very good at what they do.
They aren't at all necessary for your average SB16 etc but for leading edge
stuff I would recomend it (you can evaluate if the driver works for 3 hours at
a stretch)


&gt;       - haven't tried the internal modem yet.

and you probably shouldn't. Being a laptop, it is _probably_ pci based and is
most likely to be a winmodem. The only winmodems I am aware of that are
'supported' under Linux are the lucent variety. You have to go to their website
to download a binary only module. Your mileage will truly vary. Most would
recommend you avoid winmodem regardless. You will suffer pain. A practical
solution for a laptop is a pcmcia card.

&gt;APM

It is almost mandatory to do a kernel re-compile for apm anything, particularly
laptops. About 7 options cannot be second guessed and need to be built /not
built into the kernel. Unfortunately, this section of apm cannot be modularised
(= options in /etc/conf.modules) you need a rebuild.

&gt;     results in about 100 "Unresolved Symbol" messages, then the nice

yes and precisely and your system still boots, right?

the answer is /lib/modules/&lt;version&gt;/blah blah contains modules that were
loaded by the distro at install time. You have subsequently done a recompile of
the same kernel version with some modules missing (like you didn't really need
AX25 packet radio did you?). 

Trouble is, modprobe / depmod does'nt know anything about this and has holes in
/lib/modules/&lt;version&gt;/ where it's trying to reconcile stale, old, unused,
unloved unwanted modules against your new ones.

The cleanest way out of this is to

mv /lib/modules/&lt;version&gt;   /lib/modules/somewhere_else

and _then_ do a recompile. Only the specific modules you want will then end up
in /lib/modules/(new)&lt;version&gt;

immediately after a _succesfull_ compile (as in make modules_install) do a 

depmod -a

If this is one of your first attempts at recompiles expect speed bumps, there
are some 'options' and selections you wont have selected and didn't realise you
needed. They rarely stop you rebooting, but will slow you down somewhat. The
answer that anyone will tell you, is when re-compiling be very very
conservative with what you chop out, and to successive recompiles until it
breaks.
