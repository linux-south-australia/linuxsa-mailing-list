Glad to hear I'm not the only one!!! My kernel version is the same but
Redhat 6.0. Hopefully someone out there knows the cause!!!
To begin with I thought it must have slowly lost time during the day and
must be some sort of system drift but have since discovered after reading up
on hwclock etc. that it appears to lose the half hour some time between 4pm
and 8am. As I said previously, I don't have any time daemons or otherwise
running to my knowledge so don't know where the reset is coming from!!!!

	&gt; Morning,
	&gt;
	&gt; The system time on my PC running RedHat 6.0 appears to lose 30
minutes
	&gt; overnight. I have checked using hwclock and the RTC and it is
correct UTC. I
	&gt; cannot find any cron jobs or otherwise that appear to be resetting
the time.
	&gt; I do not have xntp or ntp running so its not being reset by that
either. Any
	&gt; help would be appreciated.
	&gt;
	&gt; Thanks,

	Yeh me too me too..
	RedHat 6.1
	kernel 2.2.12

	Probably something remarkably dumb ... but have  also checked most
of the above
	and no Joy...

	Mind you I haven't had a good look at all those boot scripts yet.
