&gt; &gt; Sometime ago there was talk here about 'problems' with ATX power
&gt; &gt; supplies and their usage with servers. Specifically, after a power
&gt; &gt; outage they need a kick in the butt to get them started again.
&gt;
&gt; The power supply has nothing to do with it, the motherboard is
&gt; the problem and it isn't any problem if you buy a good quality
&gt; motherboard.

That's not the answer I was looking for. :-(

&gt; &lt;DS9&gt;
&gt; 121st Rule of Hardware Acquisition
&gt; You get what you pay for!
&gt; &lt;/DS9&gt;

It's already paid for, so this is irrelevent to the question I asked.

&gt; &gt; There was also a hint that these could be modified/rewired so that they
&gt; &gt; will restart themselves when power returns, much like the non-atx
supplies.
&gt;
&gt; The motherboard has to be configured via the BIOS to turn back
&gt; on after power failure.

Err, what has to be configured? The motherboard or the BIOS.

&gt; If your board can't do that then you have two options,

The BIOS gives us an option for "power loss recovery" which we've tried
enabling and disabling, to no avail.

There is also a "power on funtion" with option to set for "hot key", "any
key" "keyboard98", "password" and "button only".   We've tried all options
(except password and keyborad98) to no avial.

&gt; get one that can

We've got what we've got, and I'd simply like to find a way to overcome the
problem rather than buy a new board.

&gt; or hard wire the soft-power- switch.

Been there, done that (in conjunction with all the various bios options).

&gt; If you do the latter then make sure that you don't have
&gt; soft-power-switch powerdown enabled or you uptime will never
&gt; exceed 4 seconds. :)

We don't seem to have an option to disable the soft-switch-power-down (reset
switch?). The only BIOS options in this regard are 'instant' and '4 second
delay', so when we hardwire the power-on switch all it does is power on then
off again.  Very frustrating.

Hopefully you or someone else can provide further info.  This is VERY
frustrating, and it wasn't something I thought of when I purchaced this
board because we already had another ATX board/supply that reboots just fine
after an outage.  Problem is, I didn't build/configure this other machine
and I'm reluctant to reset it to compare/check it's BIOS settings, etc
because it's one of our main servers that has enjoyed several months without
a reboot.
