There are 2 possible standards for SMP "symmetric multi processor".

Intel's standard (MPS)
AMD/open standard (??)

All motherboards and chipsets designed for x86 architecture use the Intel
standard and hence won't work with non-Intel processors.
I don't believe any of the other chipset designers, such as VIA and SIS, have
produced chipsets that support the AMD/open standard as there was never a
demand.
But since the Athlon is based on the Alpha FSB then it's quite likely there'll
be dual
processors boards real soon. They may not run w2k, but then again, do we care ?

I also read that Alpha processors can run in Athlon boards !
Don't know if this is true.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi all, recently i've looking for motherbards that will support the new
&gt; &gt; &gt;athlons, however i'd really like to find a dual processor board (slot a).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;No such thing exists however, or at least i can't find one. Does anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt;have any inkling as to why it would be so hard to make such a board
&gt; &gt; &gt;(atlons can do smp) or when there might be one?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't think that Athlon has the support that you need.  It may be that
&gt; &gt;that Thunderbird or Duron or whatever it is will have the support. Then you
&gt; &gt;need to find a mobo maker who does a dual socket A mobo.
&gt;
&gt; I'm fairly sure that the Athlon does have support for multiprocessors at
&gt; the CPU level, however there are no motherboard chipsets that support
&gt; multiple Athlons. This is a great pity, especially since AMD would have the
&gt; majority of the x86 scientific computing market if it just had dual
&gt; processor support, since its floating point performance is so much better
&gt; than the Intel alternative.
