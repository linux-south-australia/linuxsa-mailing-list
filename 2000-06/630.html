Skip to the last para for a direct answer.

The most seamless way of doing this is with winbind, a recent product of
the Samba team. It allows NT user and group information to be used
throughout Linux, by means of nsswitch and PAM. At the moment you have to
set it up by getting Samba in a slightly tricky way from the HEAD and TNG
cvs trees, but it does work very well.

The practical implication is that when you (eg) type ls -l the permissions
are for groups and users who are not known locally, they are held on a
PDC. You can log on at the "login:" prompt with something like
"YOURDOMAIN\yourusername" and again, nothing about this is stored on
Linux.

This is particularly useful for sites where the objection to using Linux
is that NT is used as the master authentication system. As Matthew Geddes
points out regularly Samba is getting very close to being a drop-in
replacement for PDC functionality as well, so conceivably sites that start
using winbind and NT might end up with all-Linux boxes sharing
authentication using an all-Microsoft protocol :-)

The only OS this works on is Linux. (One of the reasons for this is that
none of the core Samba developers use FreeBSD except when they are forced
to... and as for commercial operating systems, expect them to wake up in a
year or two!) Interestingly the nsswitch/PAM work is under the BSD license
in order to make it as easy as possible to port it to other operating
systems, even though Samba in general is under the GPL.

After all that... for a mail server you don't have to go this far. As I
think someone already said you can use pam_ntdom for this, ie so long as
/etc/pam.d/yourmailagent is set up correctly you can get yourmailagent to
run away and validate users against an NT PDC using pam_ntdom. Latest
pam_ntdom is at <A HREF="http://www.cb1.com/~lkcl/pam-ntdom.">http://www.cb1.com/~lkcl/pam-ntdom.</A>
