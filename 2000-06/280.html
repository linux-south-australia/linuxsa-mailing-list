And that's fair enough.  HTTP provides these meachanisms and
SOAP is carried over that.  There's nothing to prevent SOAP
being carried over an IPsec or SSL connection.

Sensitive data that needs end-to-end encryption or signing needs to
be dealt with before being SOAPed (so that it can marked as being
encrypted and so that the signed data can be delimited).

If an IPv4 firewall denies non-SSL SOAP traffic and SOAP traffic to
unapproved internal hosts then there isn't much risk of:

&gt; ... the first major exploit comes out that exposes everybodies corporate data

The security concerns are more subtle: traffic analysis, the trustworthiness
of data from a machine outside the firewall (which might have been subverted
with BackOrifice), covert channels, resource abuse, etc.

&gt; I can almost see MS deploying this as a remote access method for IIS or
&gt; other Internet servers, and then issuing an advisory suggesting that users
&gt; disable web access until a fix can be produced.

Totally agreed: any use from an untrusted source to an unsandboxed
application is just insane.  Which isn't the same as saying that
Microsoft won't do it...

The real benefit of SOAP is in allowing server-client programs to
run anywhere on the Internet.  This is why IBM is supporting it:
think PalmPilots chatting with an application running on a
IBM 390 mainframe.  For this application, SSL is a must.

The real threat is that it allows a backdoor to be inserted
on an internal host that can be exploited from outside the
company.  For example, someone's notebook is infected with
BackOrifice 2005, they bring it back into the office and
it infects all the machines inside the firewall.  A SOAP-
speaking host from outside the firewall can then control
those machines.  This is why the firewall can't allow SOAP
to all internal hosts.

This also explains the security community's mockery of
current firewall strategies that create a "crunchy outside,
soft inside" network.  If you have hard hosts, then the
only real work of a firewall is to ensure that network
traffic keeps to the TCP/IP specs and to limit bandwidth
abuse.  Current firewalls are totally unsuited to this,
it's a function more likely to be done by edge routers.
