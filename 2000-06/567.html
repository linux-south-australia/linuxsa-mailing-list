&gt; also, you might like to look at the scripts that bring the interfaces up
&gt; and down. that is, the scripts is /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/

The point is, your ipchains should be installed _before_ your ppp interface
comes up.

&gt; so for the example where you only have 1 ppp interface, using ppp+ in
&gt; ipchains will work ok, but if the box has many modems, some which are
&gt; dial in some which are dial out, then you will run into problems.

How so?  Generally, the ppp interfaces are communicating with the
"unsecured" Internet, so firewall rules should remain applicable
and constant for those interfaces.

&gt; one of the thing I found was that if you run "ifup ppp0" but for example
&gt; a dial-in line had already been established, it (the dialin) will grab
&gt; ppp0, and your dialout will grab (most likely) ppp1.

A dialin line will most likely have a statically assigned IP address
(or at least an IP range that you control), in which case you would
rules that specifically addressed this, and not need to use the
generic ppp+ interface.
