<H1>[OT] The UNICES</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I understand that there are two main divisions of UNIX, although someone
who understands one of the divisions will understand the other. The
division I'm talk about are:

* BSD Style Unix
* System V Style Unix

I understand the main difference is the code base.

I also understand that there is a standard called:

* POSIX

Now, I have a few questions:

1. Out of the BSD and Sys V Unices, which one is chronologically older?

2. Are they SO different you are forced to learn one rather than the
other...or are they so similar that there really isn't much of a
difference to the END user (not the person who is doing the
programming)?

3. If there is a difference, is there a consensus as to which one is
better as measured by:
  i) stability
  ii) efficiency
  iii) security
  iv) ease of administration

4. There must be a relationship or some type of link between the BSD
Style Unices, System V Style Unices and POSIX. What is this
relationship?

5. Is Linux compliant with any of the above standards?

6. If one could administer a Linux System, such as one based on RedHat
6.2, by command-line, could one with only minimal learning but no
experience, administer an enterprise Sun Solarise or HP-UX or IBM AIX
machine?

7. Out of the following UNICES, which one is which standard? I'm going
to try and divide them into the right groups as I think but I'm not
certain:

  * SYSTEM V: Sun OS, Sun Solaris and IBM's AIX
  * BSD: HP-UX, Free/Open/NetBSD and BSD (is there such a beast?)

8. Of System V and BSD, which one is Linux most similar to or fully
compatible with (if that's the case)?

**

I'm sorry that these questions sound like text book questions. They're
NOT. I just want to brush up on some UNIX history and standards and work
out which UNIX stands where, or which UNIX like operating stands where
and such.
