&gt; &gt; I think the text in the message goes something like:

&gt; &gt; Content-type: xxxxxx/xxxx; name="virus.vbs"
&gt; 
&gt; And had I been filtering my mail as per your recommendation, I would
&gt; have just dropped this mail message, because it would have been a
&gt; (false) positive match.  Had you decoded the message in a MIME fashion,
&gt; you wouldn't even have "seen" the string "Content-type" unless you
&gt; were examining the contents of the containers.  You would, however,
&gt; have known the MIME type of each container sent to you (unless they
&gt; slip it into a ZIP file, which is a real possibility, apparently).

Another solution would be to accept the risk of a false positive match, 
but forward the mails to a "dodgy-mail" queue account which could be 
looked over manually. Mind you, that's asking for more work, but
presumably there won't be too many of these things coming in.

It's probably better to use already available tools to do your matching,
though.
