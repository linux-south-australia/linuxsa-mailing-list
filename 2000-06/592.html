Sorry if someone has already replied to this, I'm still catching up on my
email...

Under Redhat, you can edit the file /etc/ppp/ip-up.local to run commands
when your PPP interface is brought up, and likewise, /etc/ppp/ip-down.local
when the interface is brought down. For the following I am going to assume
that you only make 1 ppp connection. If you connect to more than one ppp
server, or you act as a dial-in server, email me off list and I'll expand on
it for you.

In your /etc/ppp/ip-up.local file, you need to put something like:

==============================
#!/bin/sh

# This script is called with the following arguements:
#   $1  interface name
#   $2  tty name
#   $3  speed
#   $4  remote IP address
#   $5  local IP address
#   $6  ipparam name

PPPDEVICE=$1
LOCALPPPIP=$5
REMOTEPPPIP=$4
export PPPDEVICE LOCALPPPIP REMOTEPPPIP
==============================

Then in your firewall scripts you can just reference any of those variables
using the shell environment.

Subject: PPP, Dynamic IP, and an IPCHAINS script


&gt; I hope this doesn't transmit in HTML - first email using Eudora (I think I
&gt; have it all config'd). Sorry if it does, just let me know and I'll fix it.
&gt;
&gt; I have a difficult problem which I hope you may be able to help me with. I
&gt; have RedHat 6.2's PPPD set up to dial my ISP. My 'ppp-on' script is called
&gt; from near the top of my init.d/firewall script, giving the ability to
bring
&gt; up the connection, wait 30 seconds to log in, then run the IPCHAINS stuff
&gt; (which is quite large). By combining the two actions into one script, I am
&gt; able to control them by one command, 'firewall restart'. I have a crontab
&gt; script that checks for a valid ppp0 every five minutes. If not found, it
&gt; restarts the firewall script and all would be fine.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the glitch: Once dialed in, my ppp0 interface is given a dynamic,
&gt; random IP from the ISP's pool. However, a few lines of code later in the
&gt; script, my firewall script pre-sets a number of variables, one of which is
&gt; the external interface IP, "IPADDR". I need to find a way to pass the new
&gt; IP address to this variable on-the-fly so that IPCHAINS can pick it up and
&gt; use it. The affected part of the script (trimmed for size) appears at the
&gt; end of this message.
&gt;
&gt; I considered doing an 'ifconfig ppp0 &gt; /root/ifdump.txt' and then parsing
&gt; it for the IP and redirecting it into the variable, but that seems messy.
&gt; It would be nice if I could either export a variable right from pppd or
&gt; chat, or somehow intercept the IP passing to the kernel and "set" the
&gt; variable in the system. Is there perhaps a place where the IP is stored,
in
&gt; a text file somewhere?
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions to get this idea, or any other approach working would be
&gt; most appreciated. My knowledge is growing, but I sometimes "engineer"
&gt; myself into a corner.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
