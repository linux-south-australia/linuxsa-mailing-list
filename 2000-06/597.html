I am saddened by the postings of some people who subscribe to this list.

Regarding the Installfest, an RSL hall was suggested, and objected to on 
the grounds of the National RSL executive's attitude to homosexuality.
This objection was excessive - the hall or our use of it makes no comment 
whatsoever on our agreement with the RSL officers - but was nevertheless 
treated most kindly and with great sensitivity.  I think this reflected 
great credit on this list.

Then came a quite similar problem, where a Christian school had 
difficulties coping with the demon logo of FreeBSD.  Many might think the 
school's attitude excessive, but was their objection treated with kindness 
and sensitivity?  Not a bit of it!  On the contrary "Heigh Ho! - Wonderful 
excuse! Lets have a Christian-bash!" seems to have been the cry.

I find that contrast damnable.

I believe that NO section of our community should be subject to persecution 
and ill-founded vilification.

Can we please get back to Linux and RELATED issues - and stay there?
