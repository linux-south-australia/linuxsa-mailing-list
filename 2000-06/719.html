For different reasons I completely agree with you. Linux is the most
annoying operating system I know. If I knew FreeBSD better (I'm working on
it!) I'd probably say "equal most annoying".

But the point is that it is worth getting annoyed with a free operating
system, because it is possible to improve it or, eventually, replace it.
A nice thing about free software packages is that for the most part they
don't make backwards-compatibility decisions at the expense of technical
improvement and user friendliness.

Your particular gripe was partly about the Linux development model. I
hearby predict, forsooth, that the current development model will change
sometime before version 3.0 to be more in line with other major projects,
if there ever is a 3.0 (we might see Superix 1.0 instead.) I'm not given
to making predictions in public but there you go :-)

In comparison with every other operating system with major market share,
the 2.2.x series of allegedly stable kernels is very solid and very well
maintained.
