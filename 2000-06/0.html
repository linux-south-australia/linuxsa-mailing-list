&gt; Don't forget to fax your media release to some of the Network stations,
such as
&gt; Channel 7.  But remember they have to believe its an interesting event,
&gt; perhaphs highlight the spirit of the linux project, make it truely an
event,
&gt; I'd dare say even commit a 'stunt' in order to get their attention. Most
&gt; journalists are only interested in computer stories if it involves
hacking,
&gt; viruses, and gadjets. Perhaps something along these lines? (just to draw
to the
&gt; event itself). I dare say stage events, the media loves a show, and they
love
&gt; good visuals.

True... We will try our best... Anyone want to come on a mass nudie run
through rundle mall giving out leaflets? :)

&gt; And try to have it on a weekend! If you do it during the week you will
just get
&gt; pushed aside by more 'topical' news items. Usually journalists are much
more
&gt; likely to do stories they would normally consider "boring".

this means we need to be well and truly organised at least a week prior to
the event...

&gt; I'm not a journalist but i do work in the industry, these are just some
&gt; suggestions :)

Thanks

&gt; Get Micheal Harbison nvolved, I'm sure he'd be supportive, and hes *very*
good
&gt; at working the media :)

very good idea -- anyone else know any other sympathetic politician-types?

Thanks Chris
