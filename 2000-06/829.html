&gt;Hmm, since you're talking about the address given to you, I'm assuming
&gt;you've
&gt;done an ifconfig or something similar to make sure the interface is up.
&gt;Maybe
&gt;the default route isn't getting set correctly? do "/sbin/route -n" to
&gt;make 
&gt;sure that the destination 0.0.0.0 (the default route) is being sent down
&gt;ppp0.
&gt;if not, you can do "route add default ppp0" I think to add it
&gt;temporarily, or
&gt;make sure that the ppp0 interface is set as the default route more
&gt;permanently.
&gt;I'm not sure about Mandrake, but Redhat, which it's based on, has an
&gt;option in
&gt;the /etc/sysconfig/network file which goes something like this on my
&gt;system:
&gt;GATEWAYDEV="eth0"
&gt;if you make that ppp0, and make sure you don't have a GATEWAY variable
&gt;in there
&gt;(since that should be set automatically by pppd), pppd should add itself
&gt;as the
&gt;default route next time you bring the interface up.

Hi, I don't think that this will work, because the interface is brought up
well after the networking stuff is up.

However, pppd allows you to automatically add a default route through the
interface just brought up, and pppd allows you to run a script when the
link is up (IPCP comes up, or some such). You can add routes there.

&gt;Huh, there's probably a really easy gui checkbox in the dialler you're
&gt;using, I
&gt;dunno. Look for anything about a default route.
