 &gt; 1) From the Mysql manual:
 &gt; The ISAM table handler -- Stable 
 &gt;      This manages storage and retrieval of all data. In all MySQL
 &gt; releases there hasn't been a single (reported) bug in this code. The
 &gt; only known way to get a corrupted table is to kill the server in the
 &gt; middle of an update. Even that is unlikely to destroy any data beyond
 &gt; rescue, because all data are flushed to disk between each query. There
 &gt; hasn't been a single bug report about lost data because of bugs in
 &gt; MySQL, either. 
 
You're missing the point.  The argument isn't that mysql is unstable
and prone to data loss due to a failing in mysql's code quality.  The
argument is that if you're doing a query which involves more than one
sequential SQL statement you can't trust the results.

Now, as Dan said, that's probably fine for a read-only database.  It's
probably also fine for a read/write database... until that one occasion
in 10,000,000 in which you have two people simultaneously doing SQL 
queries in *just* the right order to make sure that one or both of them
will get completely bogus results, which may then be written back to the 
database.

So it isn't a matter of mysql crashing, it's more a case of GIGO - 
Garbage-In, Garbage-Out.  That's the kind of corruption we're talking about.

To use the canonical example:  Consider a database of account balances.
Whenever money is withdrawn, you do something like:

     SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_number=.....;

... in DBI or something, then you do some sanity checking and business
logic (is the balance high enough that this withdrawl won't attract fees? 
Is there enough money in the account to satisfy the withdrawl? etc), then
you do:

     $newbalance = $balance - $amount;

     UPDATE accounts SET balance = $newbalance WHERE account_number=.....;

So this one operation has involved two SQL queries.  

This will work fine for years and years and years:  Right up until the
exact moment at which some random benefactor deposits to your account
when you're right in the middle of doing a withdrawl.  

Why?  (I know some might not be following at the moment...)  Well,
consider a balance for account 53715 which starts at $100.  You're
withdrawing $50, so you do this:

  $dbt = $dbi-&gt;prepare("SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_number=?");
  $dbt-&gt;execute(53715);
  # error checking elided
  my ($balance) = $dbt-&gt;fetchrow();
  $dbt-&gt;finish();

  my $newbalance = $balance - 50;            ********

  $dbt = $dbi-&gt;prepare("UPDATE accounts SET balance=? WHERE account_number=?");
  $dbt-&gt;execute($newbalance, 53715);
  # error checking elided
  $dbt-&gt;finish();

Now, at *******, the balance in the database is still $100 because we 
haven't written back the modified amount.  If our benefactor chooses
that moment to deposit $30 to our account, the database will then show
$130.  But after the *******, the program above will write $balance-50 = $50
back into the database, meaning that the poor sap with the account will
be $30 out of pocket.

That's just plain wrong.  It's like the deposit never happened, even 
though both operations no doubt show fully extensive audit trails to 
show that it bloody-well did happen.

That's a freak occurrance;  but if you have several hundred thousand
hits per day, how long is it going to take to happen?

It's true that you could probably wrap this simple case into a single
UPDATE statement and do the business logic as a combination of CONSTRAINTs
and stored procedures -- But you can't always do that;  indeed, you can
almost never do it completely.

If you had a database which supported transactions, this corruption
simply wouldn't happen.  The withdrawl would begin the transaction,
the deposit would then not be able to operate on the same rows until
after the withdrawl had been completely finished -- It would be simply
impossible for a third party to alter 53715's balance at the ****** point.

THAT is what the ACID test is all about.  THAT is why you need
transactions.  And THAT is why we're not talking about bugs in mysql
when we talk about database corruption.

It isn't just limited to the "read, calculate, write-back" case either:
Even web sites which do several SELECTs in a row will fall prone to
the problem if there is something, somewhere doing an UPDATE or INSERT
at the same time.  Usually it won't matter;  but every now and then
it'll matter A LOT, and the amount of code you need to write to guard
against it is vastly more complicated than the effort you need to go to
to replace your back-end with a real database.

 &gt; 2) The Mysql applications we write for the internet(including write
 &gt; access to important data) run slow. To the extent that is nearly
 &gt; unacceptable, not because of Mysql but because of the internet being
 &gt; slow. If we were to use Postgres wich is over 10 times slower, some of
 &gt; our applications simply would not be acceptable or be used. They would
 &gt; stay with their traditional LAN administration.

I submit that it's possible to design around that limitation, so you 
can still have fast response.  The hundreds of thousands of ORACLE
sites out there are proof of that;  ORACLE is even slower than 
PostgreSQL on SME databases, yet the commercial world seems to think
it's fast enough to drive all kinds of real-life applications, including
web sites.

 &gt; 3) Over the past 4 years we have used Mysql for many clients. Some that
 &gt; use the SQL engine very heavily(read and write). After all that we have
 &gt; had only one msyql crash in 4 years. Nothing an isamchk didn't fix(10
 &gt; minutes work). And no data loss during this crash. All clients are
 &gt; happy with there applications running on Mysql, that speaks for itself.

Again, this misses the point.  It's about ACID, not software bugs.

 &gt; I guess that still doesnt eliminate the possibility for data loss.

Or GIGO.
