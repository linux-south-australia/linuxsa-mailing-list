Win 98 will overwrite your MBR so your assumption is correct. Your Linux
install will most likely still be safely untouched. I'm not sure what disto
you are using (Linux 6.1???) but if that is SuSE 6.1 then just insert your
install floppy and you should be able to boot to the installed system. If
you are running RH then I'm not sure what the exact procedure is, as I run
SuSE but I'm sure that one of your install or boot floppy/CDs will let you
boot to the installed system. You might have to specify your partition
somewhere eg /dev/hda2. Once there, just log in as root and type 'lilo'.
This should restore the previous boot info from your /etc/lilo.conf file and
all will be as was. 
Failing this then locate a lilo config tool and re-run that. The tools
change from distro to distro but there are even some fairly standard x apps
like klilo.

Subject: LILO


Hi all,

I'm hoping to get this message through before some unknown abnormalities
(linuxsa mail keeps bouncing and am constantly being removed from list,
having to reregister) occur again!

I HAD a dual boot box (Win95/Linux6.1) with a LILO selection tool.

For personal reason, I upgraded Win95 to Win98, but noticed during the
upgrade process the LILO prompt didn't appear.

I get the impression this has been removed from my MBR while upgrading.

My question, Can I somehow replace the LILO to my MBR without having to
lose everything on my Linux partition - that is, if it already hasn't
been removed. As per normal, Windoze is only showing me what is left on
my windoze partition.

Any assistance will be gratefully acknowledged.

Mark
