Hello!

You would be well aware that I have been appointed the task of collating
the tip sheets for the coming Install Fest. Because I have not been a
"new comer" to Linux for quite a while now I turned to the RedHat
Certified Engineer Pre-Requisite Page for tips on what tip sheets new
comers would need. It's address is
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/services/training/training_prereq.html.">http://www.redhat.com/services/training/training_prereq.html.</A>

Out intention with the Tip Sheets is to:

i)  Hand them out - hopefully free of charge - to each attendee at the
Install Fest on July 15
ii) Incorporate them at the LinuxSA Tips Page

Hence any materials would need to be able to be copied legally. For your
own material you could use the GPL. I would include a disclaimer for all
these materials to the effect that the authors are not responsible if
something goes wrong because the user used the materials. You should
register your intention to write the material (or fine tune the
material, such as chasing up authors to make sure they're OK with
handing their material out at an Install Fest) by visiting:

* <A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~lloy0076/linux/ifest/index.html">http://www.rebel.net.au/~lloy0076/linux/ifest/index.html</A>

Here is my proposed list of cheat sheets and any people/person who is
doing or done one. A [NA] means not allocated at this point of time:

Basic Hardware Knowledge
  * Intel architecture [NA]
  * Disk sub-systems [NA]
  * Disk partitioning [NA] - I remember Glen Turner wrote something
about this that could be used...

Basic Unix/Linux Knowledge
  * Basic text editor usage 
    - opening, closing and writing
    - basic text editing

I don't want to start a VI/Emacs war. I will write a basic VI tip sheet. 
Could an experienced "emacs" user please write a basic emacs tip sheet.
You only have to cover the above topics!

Unix File System Hierachy and Structure
  * Unix/Linux file systems [NA]
    [not detailed, an explantion of:
      - ext2
      - msdos/fat/vfat
      - proc
      - nfs
  * Naming of devices such as SCSI, floppy, cd-rom devices [NA]
  * file system formattting and checking [NA]
  * using mount [NA] - this could be done by rewriting the man page out
of "computer jargon" and adding some examples and reducing the content

Basic File Operations and Manipulation
  * basics: cp, mv, ls, more, ls, cd, pwd, tar, find, du and def [David
Lloyd]
  * filters: cat, grep, wc, tail, head and sort[NA]
  * using wild cards [David Lloyd]

Printing
  * lpq, lprm and lpr [NA]
  * local and remote printers [NA]

Unix/Linux Shell
  * very basic shell programming [Richard Sharpe already has a small tip
page at LinuxSA...possibly it could be expanded or used as is]
    - not a tutorial, but enough so that a new comer can look at a bash
script and feel comfortable with its meaning
  * piping, I/O and error redirection [R.S as above..]
  * the environment and its variables [NA]

  (Note to Richard: I haven't arbitrarily volunteered you, I'm just
commenting that some of the work has been done and am indirectly
wondering whether you would mind - if there were any takes - if someone
expanded the work you've already done)

Basic Security
  * file permissions [David Lloyd has already done]
  * understanding users, groups and umask [Same as above...will add
section about umask]
  * suid [NA]
    (I wonder whether this should be included or not??)

System administration
  * home directories [NA]
  * daemons and the /etc/rc.d directories (run levels and such) [NA]
  * cron [NA]
  * superuser (root) [NA]
  * finding syslog messages [NA[
  * backup and restore operations (disaster recovery) [NA]

Networking Services
  * pine (?) [NA]
  * fetchmail/procmail [NA]
  * setting up DNS (i.e. /etc/hosts et al) [NA]
  * inetd [NA]
  * using ftp and wget [NA]
  * using telnet [NA]
  * using openSSH (i.e. ssh) [NA]

You can submit your documents to my e-mail address in any format (but
the language should be English). You should include:

* your name (for administrative purposes)
* your contact details (for administrative purposes)
* whether you are comfortable with your name being attached to the tip
sheet
* what style of licence (GPL is appropriate...if you can't decide, talk
to me)
* the document (!!)

Although I can accept any format, I would prefer plain text with NO
tabs. I intend to DocBook and SGML the sheets. I should have the final
drafts by July 8 at the very latest.
