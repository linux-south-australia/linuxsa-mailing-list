One thing that annoys me with mail clients is that generally, they have
folders which you put messages into. A message can exist in only one folder,
unless it is copied to other folders. You can set up rules to do things for
you, like move and copy messages, etc. So suppose I have a message from a
friend, that came on a mailing list, I would like to have that message in
both the folder of messages from that friend, and in the folder from that
mailing list. But if I delete or reply to this message, I would like both
messages to have that marked.

What I really want is a mail client that lets me keep all my mail in one
"folder", but will give me many logical "views" of it -- views that can be
set up in a permanent way, like rules or filters, and that work faster than
searches... I'd like to be able to ask my mail client for all messages from
X, or all messages on the Y mailing list, or all messages on the Z thread,
and have it show me instantly. All the processing for this should be done in
advance, so there is little lag. I know that this sounds remarkably like
using a database for mail, and maybe that's what I wnat... Although it would
be best if the mail could be kept in as standard a format as possible, or at
least be easily (almost trivially) exported and imported.

Does anyone know of such a client? Would it require some server magic? In
fact, could one use something like an IMAP server to provide this to an IMAP
client transparently to the client? eg: have default folder names like "from
<A HREF="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</A>" and "about blah blah blah", so that the rules get
automatically created whenever a new message comes in... I can think of a
million other handy features that I would like, but... :)

Does anyone know of any Clients (or IMAP servers) that would be able to do
something like this... Is there any reason why this is a stupid idea?
