Conrad,
	The "8 core cable" is called UTP, Unshielded Twisted
Pair.  You will need to have a crossover cable made to do what
you're trying to do with this, or some retailers can supply them
for you (they are usually red cable and connectors to indicate
crossover).  Under normal circumstances UTP requires a hub, but
when you have only 2 PC's you can use a crossover cable.
You need to ensure that each card is configured to use whichever
interface you wish to use, either BNC or UTP. There is a tool called
3C5X9CFG.exe for DOS that you can use to do this, but I'm not
sure if there is a Linux equivalent. From what you say, I
suspect either one, or both cards are set to use the UTP
interface, and either 1) the second card is set to BNC, or 2) both
are set to UTP but you don't have a crossover cable.

regards .. Don

&gt; This is something I have been tinkering with on and off for months.  So
&gt; far all I can do is get the interfaces up.  As for relevant information
&gt; on this system, there is about zero.  The man page for networks isn't
&gt; maintained.  Can anyone suggest sources of info for this.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm using the 3c509 cards and have cables for both the bnc connectors
&gt; and the 8 core cable.  It is unclear which should be used.  The 8 core
&gt; cable is set up to connect one computer directly to another.
&gt; 
&gt; Any tips would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
