I don't think we can fit any more in my dept.

Oh, well in that case ...

There are Linux tools out on the 'net that will search a disk for
partition information and give it to you in a format that will let
you punch it pretty much verbatim into fdisk.  Unfortunately, the
URLs for these are on my laptop, which is elsewhere at the moment.
"gpart" springs to mind, however (just be aware of how springy my
mind is at the moment).
