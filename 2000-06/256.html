I've had this happen at one of the places I consult (consort?)
for.  The "web developer" couldn't figure out why a form
rendered OK under IE but not NS, and concluded that NS was
buggy (well, duh!, but not in this case).  Missing a &lt;/SELECT&gt;
tag.  The developer didn't even know (or want to know, after
I pointed it out to him) about the documented standards that
live at www.w3.org.  And then there was the bun fight about
him wanting to write server side scripts on the client side,
because that's all DreamWeaver would support ...

weblint (A Perl Script) is good for validating HTML correctness,
but does complain about proprietary extensions.
