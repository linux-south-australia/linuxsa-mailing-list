Wouldn't this make the RTC wrong not just the System Time in Linux?

	Youll prolly find its the mothboards fault.
	Ive come across quite a few motherboards now that have had faulty
clock gen
	crystals/ic's.
	Unfortunatly theres not much you can do about it either besides
replacing
	the motherboard.

	&gt; Glad to hear I'm not the only one!!! My kernel version is the same
but
	&gt; Redhat 6.0. Hopefully someone out there knows the cause!!!
	&gt; To begin with I thought it must have slowly lost time during the
day and
	&gt; must be some sort of system drift but have since discovered after
reading
	up
	&gt; on hwclock etc. that it appears to lose the half hour some time
between
	4pm
	&gt; and 8am. As I said previously, I don't have any time daemons or
otherwise
	&gt; running to my knowledge so don't know where the reset is coming
from!!!!

	&gt; &gt; Morning,
	&gt; &gt;
	&gt; &gt; The system time on my PC running RedHat 6.0 appears to lose 30
	&gt; minutes
	&gt; &gt; overnight. I have checked using hwclock and the RTC and it is
	&gt; correct UTC. I
	&gt; &gt; cannot find any cron jobs or otherwise that appear to be
resetting
	&gt; the time.
	&gt; &gt; I do not have xntp or ntp running so its not being reset by that
	&gt; either. Any
	&gt; &gt; help would be appreciated.

	&gt; Yeh me too me too..
	&gt; RedHat 6.1
	&gt; kernel 2.2.12
	&gt;
	&gt; Probably something remarkably dumb ... but have  also checked most
	&gt; of the above
	&gt; and no Joy...
	&gt;
	&gt; Mind you I haven't had a good look at all those boot scripts yet.
