Hi list(en)ers,

I've just put RH6.2 on a Versa Note VX notebook. I intend to send details
to the linux laptop sites, however here are preliminary details:

      Machine is a Celeron 466/64Mb/6Gb

      - 6.2 installs fine
      - Xconfigurator finds the ATI Mobility chip
          but reckons it only does 8 bit color, changing
          the XF86Config file entry from 8 to 24 works and
          produces 24 bit color. The screen is 12.1 TFT SVGA and
          will only handle 800x600 
      - Haven't got a port replicator (yet) so can't test networking, 
        its pretty annoying having a built in network card but no RJ45
        plug on the back - especially cause there are a heap of other
        plugs I find less useful. network card is etherpro100 so I
        don't anticipate problems.
     
      - Sound doesn't work at all, sndconfig says that it
        can find an Intel chipset but it is unsupported. 

      - haven't tried the internal modem yet.

      - APM standby is fine, APM suspend  seems to suspend okay but
        locks on resume - with caps lock and scr-lock lights flashing.
        So you have to get into the bios and disable auto suspend or
        you could get into trouble.

Otherwise the machine works really well. Boots in 55 seconds and X comes
up in (almost) no time at all. The X server is accel (Mach32) and
seems pretty fast.

Now, I have one query for all you kernel hackers out there:

    I did a kernel build and chopped out a whole bunch of stuff I don't 
    need. But when I reboot, the line about finding module dependencies
    results in about 100 "Unresolved Symbol" messages, then the nice
    little green OK comes up, then the boot continues everything
    seems to work fine. 

    I did:

              make menuconfig
              make dep 
              make clean 
              make bzImage 
              make install 
              make modules 
              make modules_install 
    Then
              - copy bzImage to /vmlinuz
              - add appropriate entry to /etc/lilo.conf
                so I have the standard image as linux and
                a new image called linux-new pointing to /vmlinux
              - run /sbin/lilo

    Are these boot messages worth worrying about. I certainly don't like
    Unresolved symbol messages in my programs!

Cheers,
Geoff Russell (no relation to Richard Russell!)
