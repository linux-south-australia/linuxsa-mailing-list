Hmm, since you're talking about the address given to you, I'm assuming
you've
done an ifconfig or something similar to make sure the interface is up.
Maybe
the default route isn't getting set correctly? do "/sbin/route -n" to
make 
sure that the destination 0.0.0.0 (the default route) is being sent down
ppp0.
if not, you can do "route add default ppp0" I think to add it
temporarily, or
make sure that the ppp0 interface is set as the default route more
permanently.
I'm not sure about Mandrake, but Redhat, which it's based on, has an
option in
the /etc/sysconfig/network file which goes something like this on my
system:
GATEWAYDEV="eth0"
if you make that ppp0, and make sure you don't have a GATEWAY variable
in there
(since that should be set automatically by pppd), pppd should add itself
as the
default route next time you bring the interface up.

Huh, there's probably a really easy gui checkbox in the dialler you're
using, I
dunno. Look for anything about a default route.
