&gt;  &gt; 1) From the Mysql manual:
&gt;  &gt; The ISAM table handler -- Stable 
&gt;  &gt;      This manages storage and retrieval of all data. In all MySQL
&gt;  &gt; releases there hasn't been a single (reported) bug in this code. The
&gt;  &gt; only known way to get a corrupted table is to kill the server in the
&gt;  &gt; middle of an update. Even that is unlikely to destroy any data beyond
&gt;  &gt; rescue, because all data are flushed to disk between each query. There
&gt;  &gt; hasn't been a single bug report about lost data because of bugs in
&gt;  &gt; MySQL, either. 
&gt;  
&gt; You're missing the point.  The argument isn't that mysql is unstable
&gt; and prone to data loss due to a failing in mysql's code quality.  The
&gt; argument is that if you're doing a query which involves more than one
&gt; sequential SQL statement you can't trust the results.

And, what's more, there are other reasons why MySQL may in fact be slower
(again, due to transactions.) It isn't just a matter of conflicting write
operations in the obvious cases (which may be very rare, as Mark says) but
also of query operations who are dealing with data changing in an unknown
order. This is likely to be much more common. Getting around it with MySQL
programming will produce something which is probably slower than an RDBMS.
See next reply to Carlo.

&gt; Now, as Dan said, that's probably fine for a read-only database.  

I'd go as far as to say that MySQL is an excellent solution for a
high-volume, mission-critical, bombproof, first-rate read-only database.
Much better than any RDBMS.
