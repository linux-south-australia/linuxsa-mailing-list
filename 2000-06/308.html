&gt;
&gt;&gt; Now, I have a few questions:
&gt;&gt; 1. Out of the BSD and Sys V Unices, which one is chronologically older?
&gt;
&gt; They're about the same... kinda.
&gt;
&gt; The original UNIX was from AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey (1969).  They
&gt; didn't give it a version number back then, instead it had names like
&gt; "1st edition", "2nd edition," etc, which loosely corrsponded to
&gt; "whatever version the second edition of the manual most accurately
&gt; describes," etc.  Needless to say, it was a work in progress.
&gt;
&gt; Berkeley received their copy of 6th Edition UNIX in the early 70s.
&gt; Shortly afterwards, UNIX 32V was released by AT&T, and that version is
&gt; usually regarded as the parent of the "SysV" family.
&gt;
&gt; 1BSD was distributed at a point quite close to the release of 32V.
&gt; It was basically 6th Edition on steroids with software development
&gt; tools and kernel fixes thrown in, and was only distributed to a
&gt; very small number of AT&T UNIX licensees.
&gt;
&gt; As time went by, 32V (aka SysV)

No, 32V had nothing to do with System V.

&gt; and BSD continued to develop.  For a long time sites who want to run
&gt; UNIX would get an AT&T license, then throw away the AT&T tape and
&gt; install BSD.  BSD was considered a derivative work of 6th edition up
&gt; until 4.4BSD-Lite was released in the early 90's, and it therefore
&gt; required an AT&T license.
&gt;
&gt; [ notwithstanding that, 386BSD and BSDI were based on 4.3BSD with the
&gt;   remaining AT&T bits, which were restricted to five kernel source .c
&gt;   files, removed.  AT&T USG, then Novell USL challenged its distribution
&gt;   in an early-90's lawsuit;  The settlement of that suit included the
&gt;   mutual agreement that 4.4BSD-Lite was officially "clean" of AT&T bits.
&gt;   Note that Berkeley countersued, successfully claiming that TCP/IP, virtual
&gt;   memory, NFS code and the "vi" text editor was being distributed with
&gt;   AT&T UNIX without attribution, in violation of the BSD License ]

Note that you can now get a free licence to all these UNIX varieties
from SCO.  See <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/offers/ancient.html">http://www.sco.com/offers/ancient.html</A> for further
details.  If anybody takes up this offer, I have copies of most
versions of UNIX going back as far as the Second Edition (incomplete,
unfortunately) and can supply CD-Rs of them to people who can confirm
having a license.  You can find additional information at
<A HREF="http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/PUPS/index.html.">http://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/PUPS/index.html.</A>

&gt;&gt; 2. Are they SO different you are forced to learn one rather than the
&gt;&gt; other...or are they so similar that there really isn't much of a
&gt;&gt; difference to the END user (not the person who is doing the
&gt;&gt; programming)?
&gt;
&gt; There is hardly any difference to the end user;  there's also hardly any
&gt; difference to the programmer, especially starting from SysVR4, where
&gt; the SysV folks put large chunks of BSD source-level compatibility into
&gt; their libraries.  The APIs are very, very similar.
&gt;
&gt; System Administration is where most of the differences are;  there are
&gt; many differences between the daemons you'd run on the two flavours, and
&gt; the way you configure them (SysV tends to use commands with veritable
&gt; alphabets of command-line options to configure things like printing and
&gt; file-sharing ('lpadmin', DFS's 'share' command), whereas BSD uses simple
&gt; config files (/etc/printcap, /etc/exports).

Note also that the individual System V dialects have a plethora of
strange daemons.  IRIX springs to mind.

&gt;&gt; 3. If there is a difference, is there a consensus as to which one is
&gt;&gt; better as measured by:
&gt;&gt;   i) stability
&gt;&gt;   ii) efficiency
&gt;&gt;   iii) security
&gt;&gt;   iv) ease of administration
&gt;
&gt; My personal opinion is that BSD-based systems are much easier to
&gt; administer (which also seems to have been the conclusion of lots of other
&gt; people -- When Sun went from BSD-based SunOS 4.x to SysV-based SunOS 5.x,
&gt; many Sun shops refused to upgrade for years and years, even though none
&gt; of the newer hardware supports SunOS 5.x).
&gt;
&gt; Stability-wise they're about the same.  Security-wise they're about the
&gt; same.
&gt;
&gt; As for efficiency: BSD's peer reviewing by an open community of
&gt; professional researchers seems to have delivered some wins.  For
&gt; example, its TCP/IP code is so much more efficient than SysV's
&gt; TCP/IP code that some SysV vendors actually use BSD TCP/IP in their
&gt; kernels (e.g.: SGI's IRIX, Sun's Solaris).

Really?  I thought that the main difference was the difference between
the sockets and STREAMS interfaces.  I don't think there's any System
V out there that doesn't use a BSD-derived IP stack, usually from
Lachman.

&gt;&gt; 7. Out of the following UNICES, which one is which standard? I'm going
&gt;&gt; to try and divide them into the right groups as I think but I'm not
&gt;&gt; certain:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;   * SYSTEM V: Sun OS, Sun Solaris and IBM's AIX
&gt;
&gt; No -- The "Official" System-V UNIX is SCO OpenServer 5.4, since SCO
&gt; owns the source code base for SysV (after it was sold by AT&T to Novell,
&gt; then by Novell to SCO).

Oops, no.  OpenServer is SVR3 based, which is very non-standard.
UnixWare is closer, and is SVR4 based (or are they calling that SVR5
nowadays?).  When you consider that SVR4 is about three times the size
of SVR3 (including just about the entirety of 4.3BSD), the difference
is not insignificant.

&gt; Sun is a bit different from the others too:  SysV vendors license the
&gt; source code from SCO on an annually-renewable basis (for about $80,000
&gt; per annum plus per-copy royalties).  Sun, on the other hand, actually
&gt; managed to negotiate an agreement to BUY their license outright from
&gt; AT&T in the mid 90's, so they don't run the official SCO SysVR4 source
&gt; base anymore, but they also don't have to pay any annual license fees or
&gt; royalties.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;   * BSD: HP-UX, Free/Open/NetBSD and BSD (is there such a beast?)
&gt;
&gt; If I had to pick an official version of BSD, I'd say it was FreeBSD.
&gt; I say this because so many of the original CSRG researches are FreeBSD
&gt; committers:  Kirk McKusick is still doing active development work on it,
&gt; Keith Bostic has his commit bit, Karels is supposed to be getting commit
&gt; privileges to help out with SMP work at some point in the not too
&gt; distant future.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 8. Of System V and BSD, which one is Linux most similar to or fully
&gt;&gt; compatible with (if that's the case)?
&gt;
&gt; Neither :-)  Linux has picked-and-chosen from the bits it most wants.
&gt; This will also vary from distribution-to-distribution, since the kernel
&gt; is only a small part of what makes the difference between BSD and SysV.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry that these questions sound like text book questions. They're
&gt;&gt; NOT. I just want to brush up on some UNIX history and standards and work
&gt;&gt; out which UNIX stands where, or which UNIX like operating stands where
&gt;&gt; and such.
&gt;
&gt; There's a book called "The History of UNIX" which goes into it in
&gt; great detail.  I'd love to provide you with authorship and
&gt; publication details, but my copy is currently loaned out.  Search
&gt; amazon and see what you find.

You mean Peter Salus "A Quarter Century of UNIX"?  Addison Wesley,
ISBN 0-201-54777-5.
