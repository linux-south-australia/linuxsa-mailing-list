Oops forgot to send to mailing list as well as Richard

**************

Agreed, Richard is knowledgeable for sure and has conducted more linux
training
courses than any one else I can think of.  However, would it be better
for Richard
or his organization to become "approved RH or Linux Institute" training
providers?  This will enable their clients can take advantage of  being
classed as
"certified"  and may prove to be invaluable in the future?

It is only a matter of time before someone or other ties up an agreement
to
provide "approved" RH training if it has not been done already.

Do we need, or will business expect some sort of certification and will
it make
linux a more comfortable option?

Food for thought and open for discussion!

Steve

&gt; &gt;&gt; I think this may already have been covered, but it says here that RH will
&gt; &gt;&gt; offer training in Adelaide... perhaps if we could find out who the training
&gt; &gt;&gt; organisation is, we could get sponsorship from them for the InstallFest...
&gt; &gt;&gt; or maybe from RedHat directly... Anyone have more info?

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Does it have to be RH - how about Turbolinux???
&gt;
&gt; Well, in so far as training is concerned, I think I have given more Linux
&gt; courses in Australia over the last 12 months than any other person or
&gt; organization!  I would be interested in hearing from anyone else who would
&gt; like to claim the title :-)
&gt;
&gt; After the last one runs here in Adelaide in a couple of weeks time, I will
&gt; have give seven here in Adelaide, and have given courses in Adelaide,
&gt; Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
&gt;
&gt; What sort of sponsorship are we talking about. Perhaps IIT Training an I
&gt; could do something.
