&gt; Maybe putting a "unix" entry line in /etc/hosts will help?

Sorry for the delay in replying, I've only just finished exams, and
there
are about 1600 unread linuxsa messages in my folder :).

mpg123 tries to change the title of the window that the shell that
exec'ed
it is living in, so my Eterm windows become the name of the .mp3 file
that is playing. I'd wondered exactly how that works (although not quite
enough to be bothered getting the source), but maybe now I can have a
go.
It looks like it's trying to set the window name directly by talking to
X, but can't do so. I'd say maybe blackbox is setting the DISPLAY env.
variable to unix:1234 or whatever, ie a unix domain socket rather than
a tcp socket. mpg123 doesn't understand the significance of "unix", so
it
tries to look it up, and fails.

Well, it's a guess. &lt;shrug&gt;
