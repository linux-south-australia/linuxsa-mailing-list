&gt; The point you've missed about the IBM PC architecture, and one that it

No, it wasn't, it was quite expensive.  The clone manufacturers are the
ones who brought in the competition to make it cheap.

&gt; What it will take is for software and hardware manufacturers to work
&gt; together to bypass the limitations of the PC architecture,

Software manufacturers like Microsoft?  The people who gave us Plug
'n' Play (now why does that sound like a concept invented by a
marketroid?).  Microsoft don't do software that particularly well,
yet the industry is quite happy to let them set hardware standards.
"Odd."

It's nearly 20 years since the XT, and most (all?) PCs are still
hardware/software compatible with it.  "Also Odd."

&gt; It really requires the PPC in the Wintel market. If an oportunity were
&gt; presented to use say an Alpha Chip with PCI BUS, and SCSI interface, and
&gt; priced at Desktop prices, linux could actually be a winner here.

The volume manufacture of "Wintel" products kinda prevents anyone from
manufacturing a board like that at "Desktop" prices.  It's going to
take a large industry shift (or is that perception shift) before
something like this happens.  But then, I've also seen the Free Software
Movement come of age, and Microsoft finally go to court for its tactics
I've know about since the very early 90's, so all things may be possible
in an infinite universe.

&gt; Dreaming of better days.

Dreaming of a dill pickle sandwich ...  Mmmm, pickle.
