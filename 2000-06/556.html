&gt; I don't think it is true.  I think it might have been a different list (is
&gt; there an echo in here?) and if some of us scoffed it was probably at the
way
&gt; Christians so often display ignorance of their own principles.

excuse me, but i think you are singling out a minority here. I know many
Christians that hold strong to their beliefs and act accordingly. Which is
better out of the following scenarios: (a) having principles and
occasionally failing to uphold them. (b) having no principles and
continually succeeding to have none. You decide. You expect Christians to
tolerate everything, yet you are intolerant of them?

&gt; Here's a fact.  Gays never systematically tortured people for refusing to
&gt; "follow the faith."  It seems somehow evil, don't you agree?, for an
&gt; organisation to force it's beliefs upon others, specifically when those
&gt; others aren't hurting anybody, and are maybe even living by the cannons of
&gt; that organisation.  "Do as I say, not as I do," is surely time honoured.
&gt; Especially in religious circles.

neither did true Christians. those who truly believe are shown by their
actions. you will find this to be a truth that is written in the very Bible
that Christians accept as the word of God. the same goes for "do as i say,
not as i do." i'm not sure i understand the point of your post, though.
perhaps you are meaning to say that gays make better people than fake
Christians?
