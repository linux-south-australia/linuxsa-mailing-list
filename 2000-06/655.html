&gt; Thanks for your reply, since the machine only being used as a mail

&gt; the linux box knowing anything about the users, apart from the fact

Well yes, but note that this is now more than a mail server! PAM stands
for Pluggable Authentication Modules. It does authentication and nothing
more. So when you type 'ls -l' or try to run a program none of the
permission checking is done against the NT system even though the username
and password were validated by it before the user could connect in the
first place.

By "just a mail server" I was expecting a computer that people
pick their mail up from.

When bert connects using IMAP to get his mail (because the admin of the
mailserver would have read backissues of linuxsa and learned that POP adds
no functionality over IMAP and loses a lot of security/predictability,
even when used for just retrieving an inbox only and then deleting all
mail) he must supply a username and password. These are checked against
the NT database, this time using nt_dom (hence the /etc/pam.d/ file I was
talking about.)

A slight advance is that when the server receives a message from the
Internet for <A HREF="mailto:bert@somewhere">bert@somewhere</A> it looks up 'bert' in the NT database (by
using 'samedit samuser bert' in a script - samedit is only available in
the TNG tree but it does work extremely reliably) Then it delivers to the
mailbox for bert, or sends back an error message. This is not using PAM at
all. However it isn't using enough of the clever bits of TNG to give you a
headache.
