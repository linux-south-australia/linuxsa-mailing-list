 &gt; This attitude always amazes me - while I'm not an MS advocate, as far as
 &gt; security holes go, I think the various flavours of linux (Redhat/Slackware
 &gt; etc) have as many exploits as an MS Windows box (most effect both ie the
 &gt; l33t phase of nuking/smurf'ing etc)

One of the big difference is that UNIX security holes actually get fixed
when the advisories are released.  MICROS~1 doesn't always do that;  indeed,
getting them to admit that their products have security holes, rather than
"usability features which you can't turn off" or whatever the hell they
want to call them, is outrageously difficult.

Witness the whole brouhaha over macro viruses:  Five years ago, the idea
of a macro virus didn't exist -- It actually had to be *invented* by 
MICROS~1.  Of course, when they did invent it they were told in no uncertain
terms by the security community about what a stunningly bad idea it was
to enable embeddable scripts in email messages, but they went ahead and
did it anyway.  Since then we've seen new macro virus advisories every
other month, and FINALLY they've released a patch... which essentially 
disables embeddable scripts in email messages, just like they should have
done in the first place when their culpability was originally pointed out.

The whole issue of security around MICROS~1 products is an industry joke.
I don't know why you'd even bother to question it.
