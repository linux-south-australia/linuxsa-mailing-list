&gt; &gt; I *realise* that. That was just a quick example of what I wanted to do.

A quick non-language specific hack to get a point across. I apologise
for any confusion.


&gt; I don't know enough Sendmail 8.10.x - I haven't had the time to devote
&gt; serious amounts of study to it.

Well worth it if just for it's LDAP-based routing. ;-)

&gt; Sendmail 8.9.x (which is the series
&gt; I've had to deal with the most) doesn't deal with MIME messages per se,
&gt; except where it has to deal with DSN and bounces.  To Sendmail, a message
&gt; is a message.  It moves mail from point A to B, C, etc.

Agreed. But the actual message itself contains the encoded attachment
and a couple of lines of text that contains the filename of the
attachment. sendmail obviously ignores this, but given that the file
name is there, it should be possible to bounce the message based on the
filename. This may not seem very useful, but it will mean that I can
prevent any .VBS-based worms from getting any where near the few Outlook
clients I have left.

I disagree that it is necessary to decode attachments just to find the
filename.

I think the text in the message goes something like:

Content-type: xxxxxx/xxxx; name="virus.vbs"

Thanks,
