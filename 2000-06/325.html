&gt; Jake,
&gt;     To be honest I wasn't getting on my "Unix soapbox". In a
&gt; commercial environment, I would hire a person who could
&gt; write HTML over a person who could just use a tool to modify
&gt; someone else's code. The reason for this is that firstly
&gt; that person has taken the time to actually learn something,
&gt; as opposed to someone who can buy a book on Friday and be a
&gt; Wizz on Monday. Secondly if a page is corrupted someway, or
&gt; has buggy cgi scripts or something, then the person who
&gt; knows can fix it, the weekend wizz doesn't even know where
&gt; to start. It seems to me that the Coder is also going to be
&gt; alot more productive and happy and be able to add to a
&gt; business, whereas a wizz who has bluffed their way into your
&gt; organisation already by claiming to be a Wizz is far less
&gt; likely to be as productive, and will just as easily shaft
&gt; you. The Wizz is far more likely to feed you a line to stall
&gt; when they don't know how to fix something, whereas the Coder
&gt; is more likely to say " I can't fix this immediately, but I
&gt; know where to quickly learn how." This later response is far
&gt; better in my book, as the Wizz will have to stall far more
&gt; and make the problem worse, while learning what he should
&gt; have learned in the first place at your expense.

This sounds quite a bit like the "packers" versus "mappers" 
descriptions of how people organise their thoughts.  An article 
about this appeared at:

<A HREF="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.ftech.net/~honeyg/progstone/Day1.html+packers+mappers&hl=en">http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.ftech.net/~honeyg/progstone/Day1.html+packers+mappers&hl=en</A>

(Sorry for the longish URL... the original was missing when I 
looked.)  

Incidentally, I suspect that there's a bias towards "mappers" 
over "packers" that is not entirely correct: It's best if you  
have both skills, and be able to use both adeptly.
