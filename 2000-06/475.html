Thanks to all who replied on this, it's fixed.

&gt; serial interrupts are insignificant. No matter which hoop you jump thru,
&gt; twiddling a character interrupt's priority is not meaningful. A character
&gt; *must* be read, there and then, as a response to an interrrupt. Since these come
&gt; in at a very steady rate, they have to be handled, there and then. This is a
&gt; tiny white lie because a small amount of fifo buffering in the uart allows the
&gt; interrupt which occurs for each character to be handled with some latency, but
&gt; as an agregate, the entire character stream must be handled regardless,
&gt; irrespective, and no matter what, when it wants the cpu to handle it and not
&gt; the other way round.

Actually, IRQ priority did turn out to be the problem. Have a look
at the "irqtune" web page for a full-on techo discussion of why this 
is the case (search for it on freshmeat). My dumb mistake was that I 
didn't read the output from irqtune properly and didn't notice that 
I had a wrong command line option.

The other thing which I did which made a *huge* difference was to use
'hdparm' to optimise my single 15Gb IDE drive. It has an option to 
allow "interrupt unmasking" which apparently allows Linux to process 
other interrupts more quickly while it is still servicing a disk 
interrupt. Don't query me on how this works 'cos I don't know! That's 
what the man page says....

Combined with using hdparm to turn on multi-word DMA mode, disk 
transfer rates jumped from 1.1Mb/sec to 2.8Mb/sec, and all of a 
sudden the serial port stopped stalling and dropping data. 
Go figure.... For anyone who wants to try it, I did this:

hdparm -d1 -f -m32 -X34 -u /dev/hda

You can use 'hdparm -t /dev/hda' before and after to test your
transfer rates so that you can see what difference it makes.
