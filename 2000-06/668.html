&gt; No i dont have any idea with masquarding or whatever it is........... i will
&gt; explain what happens.

This is the problem; unless you own real-world IP addresses for the
client machines in your house, and your ISP has set their routing table
to send them all down your link to your Linux gateway then you'll get
stuck.

read the IP masq howto to see what IP masq is, and how to set it up.  I
will give you a brief overview of how to set things up.

1. Ensure your kernel (2.2.*) is compiled with network firewalls, and
specifically anything to do with IP masq.  You may need to do this.  If
it is a stock Redhat install then it will be ok.

2. Make a shell script.  the shell script should set up the IP masq
code.  The example below is how I do things.  You'll probably need to
modify things to make it more secure/suit your needs.
BTW, this script shoulw go on the Linux box that is your gateway.


&lt;example&gt;
#####
#
# set up internet masq
#
/sbin/ipchains -P forward REJECT
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -j MASQ -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0
echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

#####
#
# Set ip IP Accounting
/sbin/ipchains -A input  -i ppp0
/sbin/ipchains -A output -i ppp0
/sbin/ipchains -A input  -i ppp1
/sbin/ipchains -A output -i ppp1

## Set up ICQ proxy
/sbin/insmod ip_masq_icq

## Set the IRQ for the serial port
/sbin/irqtune

&lt;/example&gt;

I use a masquerading proxy for ICQ to allow ICQ to work better
(otherwise it works very intermittently in my setup).  I also use
irqtune to bring up the serial port interrupt priority.  As I am running
this through a 486 box that is also a Samba and NFS server for /home...

I also set up IP accounting to keep track of how much traffic comes in
and out of the link.  I haven't actually used this yet, so I can't say
that the accounting works.

I call this script on bootup, but it should ideally be called from the
ip-up script for your internet interface.  You should also set up an
equivalent script to disable masquerading when the link goes down.  I
haven't done this yet.

&gt; ill log on fine (the linux box) i have 5 client machines in the house
&gt; windows 98

First set up your Linux box.  Give the ethernet card an IP address of
192.168.1.1 (one of the private address space IPs.

Next, you need to set the TCP settings for all of the other boxes.  They
should have addresses that are 192.168.1.* where * is anything from 2 to
254.  Tell these boxes that their default gateway is 192.168.1.1.  They
will now be able to access the internet (after you set up IP masq).


An interesting program that you may like to use is (from memory)
c-mserver.  There are client programs for Windows too.  c-mserver
(search freshmeat) is a nifty little server that can start and kill ppp
links.  It offers some other nice features too (like Windows inferfaces
to the daemon).

I hope this has been of some one out there.

cheers,
Adam
