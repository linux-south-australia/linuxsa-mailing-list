&gt; Wouldn't this make the RTC wrong not just the System Time in Linux?

[Danger - it's been a while since I've wielded a soldering iron ...
 The following story may be based purely on fiction]

(Peers into dim dark recesses of brain; finding nothing but cobwebs,
he proceeds ...)  It depends on which crystal - the RTC is usually
driven by a 32kHz crystal.  Divide that by 32768 (2^15) gives you
your "seconds" resolution.  The clock that drives the system time
comes off of the counter/time chip (8253?), and is driven by a
different rock.

Another thing that can cause clock drift on a "slowish" machine is
some process can lock out the interrupts for longer than a system
tick (ie, spans two ticks).  From memory, the interrupts for
each level aren't queued more than once, and as each tick occurs
every 10 or 100 Hz (gad, I need a brain upgrade), that can cause
drift as the IRQ tick routine is called once for x ticks.  Actually,
I can test this ...

[<A HREF="mailto:dt@nipnyep">dt@nipnyep</A> /proc]$ grep timer /proc/interrupts; sleep 1; grep timer /proc/interrupts 
  0:    6976721          XT-PIC  timer
  0:    6976822          XT-PIC  timer

Just over 100 ticks for a second.  Cool.  I do need a new brain.

Anyhoo, this may or may not be your problem.  I remember it occuring
on a machine I had years ago, and was eventually put down to a
combination of a flaky hard disk and device driver locking the IRQ
out for extended periods.


Regards,
  Daryl Tester

&gt;         Youll prolly find its the mothboards fault.
&gt;         Ive come across quite a few motherboards now that have had faulty
&gt; clock gen
&gt;         crystals/ic's.
&gt;         Unfortunatly theres not much you can do about it either besides
&gt; replacing
&gt;         the motherboard.
