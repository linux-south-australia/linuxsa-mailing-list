&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What I put in the fstab file does not work! I really need this done by
&gt;
&gt; ok, loading from a boot disk means that the hard disk isn't used at all
&gt; during this process. that means that putting an entry into /etc/fstab
&gt; (which is stored on the hard disk) means nothing when you use a boot
&gt; disk.

Granted, but if you take one step back first, I want to be able to
access the network first so I can make a copy(img) of my box somewhere
else on the system, and it is this that I believe that I have to have an
entry in the fstab file.

&gt; The things you've said about telnet lead me to ask, can you NFS mount
&gt; when you boot normally? If yes, then you've got everything set up ok
&gt; *on_the_hard_drive* now when you boot of floppy, you'll have to recreate
&gt; these settings.

What I have read _so far_ has said that you do not run nfs on a client
machine, is this right? The QUE book (Using Linux) by Bill Ball says
that I have to have some sort of entry in the /etc/exports file. His
example is

#On the NFS Server
#exports file for kanchi
/mnt/cdrom	(ro)
/mnt/zip	(rw)
/store/pub	(rw)
/home		melkote(rw)

#On the NFS Client
#in /etc/fstab for melkote
kanchi:/home	/home	NFS

#then by typing
mount kanchi:/home

I should have access to the /home dir structure on the kanchi server
from the melkote workstation. Except using Bill Ball's example of of the
fstab file for melkote seems incomplete. I believe that my entry should
be

kanchi:/home	/home	NFS	defaults	0 0

Anyone, Please help if you can,

Mark
