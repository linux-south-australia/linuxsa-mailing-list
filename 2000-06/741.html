&gt; Hi...
&gt; 
&gt; Just a quick "what if..." question.
&gt; 
&gt; Can a linux box be set up to "log in" to an NT network ala 95/98
&gt; 
&gt; I realise that access to shares etc can be done through samba but I was
&gt; wondering if, for example, you had an NT server that controlled all of the
&gt; networks access (ie www, email, etc) and that access to these services
&gt; could only be obtained by users that were logged in to the system. How
&gt; would you go about getting the NT box to realise that the linux box was
&gt; logged in to it?
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that this isn't too much of a brain strech for a Friday evening...

Could you be perhaps talking about an authentication system like kerberos,
where you're given a "ticket" which allows you access to whatever services
support kerberos?

If you want one single login to control access to multiple services, and
those services include email, www, ftp, as well as file sharing etc, all the
servers have to support the same authentication mechanism - like kerberos
for example.

I don't know how ms-proxy authenticates (I'm assuming you want to run these
services on NT - correct me if I'm wrong - and I hope I am :), but I know
that there is a kerberos module for pam...

But I know jack-sh*t about kerberos, so someone else can take over here if
they don't mind please :)

Am I barking up the right tree?  *barks*
