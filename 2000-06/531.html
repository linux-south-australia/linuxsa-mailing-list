&gt; Is there a patch available for the 2.2.14 Kernel that will support usb

&gt; I'm currently using Kernel 2.4 but may need to drop back again because 
&gt; of a program that only runs on 2.2 Kernel versions and it requires a 
&gt; kernel patch to do this therefore it wont patch Kernel 2.4 properly.


For all you usb needs have a look at: <A HREF="http://www.linux-usb.org">http://www.linux-usb.org</A> 
You should find a link which has a backport of the usb code from the 2.3/4
series to 2.2. You will need to patch the kernel with this and recompile
it.

Once you enable usb in your kernel you'll also have to tell X about the
extra buttons on your mouse. Ie in /etc/X11/XF86Config you'll need to make
(for an Optical Intellimouse - not the explorer) read something like
this:

Section "Pointer"
   Protocol        "IMPS/2"
   Device          "/dev/usb/mouse0"
   Buttons         5
   ZAxisMapping    4 5
EndSection

Notce the Z Axismapping line. This is for the wheel. For the Explorer, set
the amount of buttons to 7 and you should be able to use the two extra
buttons on the side if a program supports them.

Once you have this running you need a program which supports the extra
buttons. Star Office is a good one to test with as it supports the wheel
natively where as poor old netscape doesn't (I use mozilla which does). 

If you want netscape to work with the wheel or any other program have a
look at the program called imwheel. It simulates keyboard events using
the
wheel. Ie roll wheel down and it's the same as you pressing the down arrow
5 times.

Anyway, have a shot and drop me a line if you need help. Linux works just
as well as Windows with the wheel, if you set it up correctly!

Cheers,
