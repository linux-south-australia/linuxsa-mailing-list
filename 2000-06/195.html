&gt; Hey Michael, I notice that you would be a good person to ask:
&gt; 
&gt; How does Turbolinux compare to RedHat? Does it use RPM's?

Yes TL in RPM based.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm very new to using Linux but have been interested in what Turbolinux is
&gt; for quite a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Would you consider it to be as polished a product as RedHat?

It depends what you mean by polished - a GUI installer? Well then yeah,
they win.

We still have a text base installer (for now), and we've had some issues
with "some" hardware support - we're having some trouble with Dell at
the moment, but that's a political thing, so we're having problems
developing drivers for their stuff.

We have a defined product range: Workstation, Server, ClusterServer &
Enfusion

WE're not just a distro, but we're a software development company as
well.  

Workstation - it more for the developer - you name it and it's under the
bonnet! We have predefined installs - base, network workstation,
graphical workstation, deveopler's graphical workstation and then
there's the Noddy install - All in one! We don't apologise for it not
being aimed directly for the desktop user, other distro are doing a good
job - our primary focus is the Enterprise end so it's more targeted to
the developer or Network Administrator, but in so saying a normal user
can still use the environment without much trouble, you can use KDE or
GNOME.

Server - Our has a mixture of Open Source, our own stuff and licensed
products which you don't find in the other distros, we are the fastest
server install - 8 min, the all in one install (900Mb). We install fully
secure, all ports locked and tcp-wrappers active - what that means is
that if your not a proficient Linix/UNIX type you haven't left the gate
open for some to walk in and steal your milk and cookies! We support a
multitude of netowrk protocal, MARS(ipx), Netatalk (appletalk), MacGate
(appletalk router), SMB (SAMBA - that works first off!), Netbeui and
others right out of the box. All our encryption is 128 for SSH & SSL and
we also have RAS. There is alot more, but if you have specifics pass
them on.

ClusterServer - our proprierty code that hooks into our TL server 4
version. We can cluster 2 to 254 nodea on a network and them some. We
cluster Web, smtp, ftp and other ip servers. It is very different to RH
Pirahna and it's not the same as LVM.

Enfusion - parallel processing - very different to Beowolf. Just check
our website. 

We have an agreement with the Open Source community in that our
ClusterServer Technology source code will released in about 6 to 8 mth.

If you what to know more or something specific just email me. I'm also
in SA next week and I'll drop some stuff off to Netcraft - product and
info foe you guys to have a look at - I'd like to come down to the
InstallFest.

Are you guys looking for a sponsor, etc?

let me know.

cheers


Michael

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let me begin by giving my apologies for not posting to the install fest
&gt; mailing list, I can barley keep up with this mailing list let alone two and
&gt; I am interested in what others think about this. I have thought about this
&gt; topic, and with the new install fest coming up, I thought that it could
&gt; apply due to the number of new users we can expect to attend.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One of my biggest problems with Linux so far as been a lack of
&gt; applications easily available, and keeping them up-to-date. While there has
&gt; been more than enough applications to keep me occupied; acquiring them is my
&gt; biggest problem. I do realize that allot of the application (like Word
&gt; perfect 8, Star Office, etc, etc) are available from the net for download
&gt; but that isn't practical for allot of people for various reasons (restricted
&gt; download limit at my case).
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What I'd really like to see (in particular at Install fest) is a BCD
&gt; available with the latest versions of software around. I like to have the
&gt; software physically available on BCD, just in case something does happen to
&gt; my files and I do not have to worry about downloading things again.  I think
&gt; this would be a good benefit to people that do attend Install Fest, as it
&gt; would give them a secure method of maintaining the applications which allot
&gt; of them would probably want.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How this could be implemented I'm not sure, the BCD would not be for
&gt; free by any means we would have to charge for the price of the BCD, etc and
&gt; keeping up with possible demand could be a problem. However, even if we only
&gt; had a few original Cods available and some people with BCD-R that were
&gt; willing to burn copies for those that wanted them. I can bring a few blank
&gt; BCD-Hrs that I have but not that many.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What software you'd want to include is a big enough topic in itself,
&gt; there are many opinions about what software is better than what and one does
&gt; have to take into consideration of storage space. The big applications like
&gt; Star Office, Word perfect, the latest version of Gnome, an ICQ clone, etc,
&gt; etc I think would be nice; but hey they are the applications I'm after and I
&gt; don't know if this is Word perfect what others want.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I hope that I've made some sense, feel free to rebuke anything I've
&gt; said; I'm still tired!!
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity has a date been set for Install Fest yet??
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;Just a thought (you may hate it though) - with regards to Apps, why not
&gt; &gt;do this - setup WINE (latest build) and run some windows apps/programmes
&gt; &gt;natively in Linux, that way "people" will see that they can at least run
&gt; &gt;some of their windows apps/programmes in Linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I know it's not perfect, but it still shows off the power of Linux.
