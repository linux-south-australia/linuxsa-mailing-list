&gt; Subject: Re: PPP, Dynamic IP, and an IPCHAINS script
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; something I would like to know is, where is the doco that explains what
&gt; &gt; these arguments are, *because* they change from script to script....
&gt; 
&gt; man 8 pppd
&gt; seach for SCRIPTS

pppd - fine. but the redhat scripts munch the arguments a bit.

&gt; For the following I am going to assume
&gt; that you only make 1 ppp connection.

one of the first things I said was "multiple ppp devices, and some are
dial in and some are dial out"


here is an example:

for reasons not important, to bring up my ppp device, I type:
ifup ppp1

and afterwards, i have ppp0 up and running. to bring the device down, I
type:
ifdown ppp1 *not* ppp0

This little descrepancy may seem irrelevant, but consider this
situation:

I have to dialout ppp devices: ppp0 and ppp1
I have 7 dial in devices

the machine boots, and ppp0 and ppp1 both dial out.
the customers start dialing in, and ppp2 to ppp9 are taken up.

Now, ppp0 falls down, and ppp6 falls down. customer A who was using ppp6
redials first and because I'm having problems with the server at the
other end of ppp0, customer A connect before ppp0 connects. Customer A
is now using ppp0, and when ppp0 finally connects, its got ppp10 (for
some reason it doesn't always take the first available one)


Now my scripts are hard to write, cause what I think is the device
(ppp0) is now actually ppp10. I believe there is provision for this in
/etc/ppp/ipup, where there are variables ppp-device and log-device, but
I haven't finished following through to see if these two make it into
the redhat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/if* scripts.
