&gt; &gt; A flatmate logging into my standard 6.1 redhat box, Using Netscape 4.6 and
&gt; &gt; checking his Hotmail account has managed to crash my machine a few times merely
&gt; &gt; by writing an email. I suspect its a java fault because observing top, the
&gt; &gt; memory use skyrockets, and keeps climbing, even though he is merely typing out
&gt; &gt; an email.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I turned off Java, and things appear to much more stable. Fingers crossed. Has
&gt; &gt; anyone had similiar problems with Hotmail and Netscape?

I had that problem on Netscape 4.7 on the NT box at work.. open a page
with Javascript and if it were left in the background (while i did other
work) for long enough the memory usage would climb until it was all of
physical RAM and all of swap space minus other running programs, and the
thing would thrash until NT died (interesting that NT died, and Netscape
didn't run out of memory and die, even tho all memory was allocated!).

Turning off Javascript (if you could get in) fixed the prob instantly,
as did leaving the page (back button, link, whatever) and the thing
stopped thrashing. Haven't seen this but with Nutscrape 4.7 on Linux,
but I don't usually leave the pages sitting long enough to do it...

On another note, I have a Labtam Xterm (old, B&W, right price... $0.00)
that I want to use so that I can have a secong GUI display on my PC for
family to write email/whatever whilst I am busy working...  I see that
the thing uses some sort of dynamic IP allocation (DHCP?) and also
required some sort of boot image.  I can't supply model numbers off
hand, and it is too cold to walk to the other room to get them.  If
anyone can help email me off the list and I'll let you know the
models/serial numbers/whatever u need to help me.  On another note,
where would I find a webpage about such things?  Anyone know of a good
one?

Cheers,
Adam
