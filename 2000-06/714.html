A while back Alex Garner proffered us with the following advice on disk
partitioning: <A HREF="http://linux.nf/partrec.htm">http://linux.nf/partrec.htm</A>

I would like to take a somewhat contrary possition.

Firstly, I agree with Alex's opening comments about the best partition
layout; that is, it depends.

However, having been involved in partitioning disks for perhaps 10 or more
years, I prefer a simpler approach, and then choose to complicate it
depending on my requirements. I have seen the root partition on one
particular vendor's UNIX OSes grow from 16MB to 128MB over time, and have
seen all sorts of complicated partitioning schemes.

For a simple home install, or even a workstation install, I go for placing
everything in one partition. It is just simpler, as you don't have to mess
around with a number of partitions and manage space for a number of
partitions. I am always finding a reason to load those extra files, and
don't want to have to manage space. 

These days, Linux will even swap to a file, so you do not need to create a
swap partiton. Simply create a swap file (if the installation script will
let you get away without a swap partition):

   dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=2048 count=65536
   mkswap -v1 /swapfile
   swapon /swapfile   # and add it to fstab

However, if you have a disk that is larger than 8.4GB, then you may need to
create a small /boot partition. 20MB should be enough. Then put everything
in the remaining space.  The need to create the small boot partition is
because of the 1024 cylinder problem.  OTOH, if you have a modern BIOS that
supports EDD (since some time in 1998), you can use LILO-21.4.4.  It can
boot from anywhere on a disk larger than 8.4GB.

If you are planning to upgrade to the next version of some distro, then you
might want a more complex setup, mainly so you can ensure that a new
version does not blow away important files.  However, RedHat does a good
job of upgrading from what I have seen, so this is not necessarily a reason
to complicate your life. And in anycase, you will have to save all your
config files if you are doing a reinstall.

Next good reason for complicating things is if you are running a server.
Then you will probably want a clean separation of system files from other
files.

Here you will probably want a separate partition for /home, so user's data
is separate from everything else.

You might also want a separate partition for /var so that /var/spool and
/var/log under contol. This helps to prevent you from being DoS'd via mail
and causing lots of logging messages.

If you are ultra cautious, you might also want /tmp and /usr/tmp on a
separate partition (you could symbolically link them to directories in the
same partition as /home), and then you will want to mount everything except
/ and /usr with the nosuid option.  This helps eliminate a whole class of
security problems.

I would still be tempted to put / and /usr in the same partition. After
all, disks are so damn big these days, that it is silly to live by rules
created when 80MB removable RM03s or whatever were big.
