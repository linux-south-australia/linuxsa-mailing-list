&gt;Howdy people,
&gt;	I have come across a problem with getting linux up and running and was
&gt;told that I could get help on this mailing list *grin* I recently
&gt;installed redhat 6 on a SCSI drive. My hope is that I could use loadlin
&gt;off my existing IDE drive (win98) to load linux. To do this of course I
&gt;need a kernel on the IDE drive (well that is the impression i'm under).
&gt;Well, since the SCSI drive is now formatted to the linux FS, I can't get
&gt;to it from windows and thus I can't get to the kernel. So I copied the
&gt;only kernel I could find from the red hat cd to the IDE drive and used
&gt;that to get linux started. Problem is, it won't detect my scsi host (but
&gt;redhat did detect it during installation). My thoughts were that perhaps
&gt;the explicit scsi host driver needs to be compiled into the kernel or
&gt;something similiar but I have no idea how to go about doing something
&gt;like that :) I'd be very appreciative if someone could help me out on
&gt;this one. Thanks in advance

The installation kit could detect it and load the driver for the SCSI
drive. What you need is an initial ram disk that has the SCSI driver in it.

You may have problems, because you need to get back into the system.
Perhaps booting the install CD again in rescue mode will do it.

You need to load the SCSI driver, and mount the disk and make an initial
ram disk (mkinitrd) and then copy that to your C partition as well, and
then you should be able to say:

  loadlin kernel initrd=initrd.img root=/dev/sdax etc

I have never done this, so I am not sure how easy it will be to do from the
installation CD.

&gt;Regards,
