Hi There!

I was thinking of writing a database for myself which would work within
the following environment:

* the WHOLE database could only ever be accessed using one process
   - technically one could access it using another program such as the
mysql command line but that wouldn't make SENSE. It's not the way the
database would be used.

* the PROGRAM running the database would exhibit the following
attributes:
   - it will be non threaded
   - it may well fork, but any forked processes will be for sundry
non-database matters. In other words, unless someone inserts a trojan
program, there's no LOGICAL or PHYSICAL way for a child process to
interfere READ or WRITE with the database.
    - as above, the PROGRAM will use a locking system. If one starts it
and it detects another instance, it will not run. Alternatively it may
act like Netscape and reduce functions to READ ONLY...with the
disclaimer that running under this mode has the chance that the data
read is not sensible.

* entries INTO the database are discrete and OBVIOUS
   - data is not entered automatically, I type it in
   - corruption ONLY occurs due to a system failure out of my (and
PostGres or MySql's control)
   - if data fails to be entered a manual reconciliation WILL easily
find it

Under these special circumstances, I conclude that either database will
do the job specified. As I said at the start - pure SQL can do what I
needed without transactions. The only Garbage In would be Garbage I
Entered. Hence I coin the acronym GIGIEGOIMF...Garbage In Garbage I
Entered Garbage Out Is My Fault.
