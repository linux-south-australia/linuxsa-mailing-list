&gt; Someone I know has written an application for DOS, and it thinking of

&gt; Windows.  What options are available?

One option is to use "wxwindows".  This is a graphics abstraction library which
allows you to write graphics applications that only require recompilation to
work on other platforms.  On unices it uses gtk underneath, on that MS offering
it can either use native mfc-style-carp or gtk for win (I think), and it also
works on mac, and perhaps others.

I haven't personally used it, but people I know have written small scale stuff
and were happy.  "Caveat Emptor".

Having said that, gtk is becoming a standard (yah!) and it might be simply
better to go down that path, 'specially if gtk-for-win is stable.

Michael...

&gt; P.S. Does anyone know how to get rid of the annoying little "--" that
&gt; the Mutt mailer puts between the email message and the signature?

That's historical - some mailers/newsreaders will automagically strip off sig
blocks when you reply to an email/newsgroup.  A useful feature in long threads
so the signal-to-noise ratio is improved.  Even if you could turn it off it's
probably better netiquette to leave it there.
