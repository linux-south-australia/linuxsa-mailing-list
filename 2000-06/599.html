&gt; I think Alan Kennington is right. Do the fix (try ssize_t first, see what
&gt; complains, make some sensible decision about large sizes in general,

Actually, I'd made a mistake and thought size_t was signed (dang, it's
hard to find the correct typedef in /usr/include/*).  So it's really
a mismatch between write() returning ssize_t for bytes written (signed),
yet accepting an unsgined value for the actual account (especially as
negative numbers are used to pass out error conditions out of internal
functions).  I wonder what POSIX's definition of read()/write() is/are?

Alan, as an aside, there should be a general routine that checks that
the buffer you are trying to read/write is contained entirely within
your process' address space.  The fact that this wasn't used by your
ATM driver is a bit of a worry.  Do you have the source for it?

&gt; Mail the patch and an explanation with sample code to Alan Cox

I'll have to build a bleeding edge development machine first - I'm
a bit loathe to run this on my development machines with my oldish
kernels.

[Alan's lucky kludgerama]
&gt; I both agree and disagree. Certainly the Linux kernel needs lots of
&gt; auditing.

A new auditing project was announced (after the capabilities "fiasco")
on BugTraq last week (nuts - I'd thought I'd kept that email).  Auditors
brains are wired differently to mine, so I'm not sure how much help I
can be.

&gt; Having people stare at
&gt; every line of code trying to imagine the most perposterous things
&gt; happening is an extremely good practice.

That's the type of brain I'm talking about. :-)

&gt; To anyone that understands these sorts of things, Microsoft claiming in
&gt; the same breath that "Windows 2000 has 10 million new lines of code" and
&gt; "Windows 2000 has been tested and is suitable for mission-critical
&gt; deployment" is just nonsense.

Where "tested" != "boots up" (although I think Linus once made a comment
about this regarding regression testing).

  Daryl Tester
