Hi,

I did a course on Solaris 2.x System Administration. It wasn't put on by
Sun but by a company here in the UK called Quanta.

The topics covered were
System Administration
	- The superuser
	- Switching users
	- Using Admintool
	- Using Solstice admin suite
	- Documentation
	- Answerbook 1 & 2

User Management
	- New user considerations
	- Group management
	- Adding new users manually
	- Adding new users using admintool

Security
	- Understanding the password file
	- Security files
	- syslogd

Printer Management
	- Printing files
	- Cancelling print jobs
	- Installing local printers
	- Moving print jobs
	- Filters and forms
	- Remote printing
	- Using admintool to add a remote printer
	- Solaris 2.6 - The new printer environment
	- Adding a network printer
	- Troubleshooting printer problems

Filesystems
	- SVR4 Directory layout
	- Adding a new disk
	- Filesystems
	- Partitioning a disk
	- Making a filesystem
	- Unmounting a filesystem
	- Filesystem checking
	- Monitoring disk usage
	- Making room on a filesystem
	- Maximum file sizes and disk quotas

Processes
	- Background processes and Daemons
	- Killing processes
	- Examining system activity and input/output statistics

Timing and Scheduling
	- Setting the system date
	- Scheduling one off jobs and regular job scheduling
	- Security considerations

Backup and Restoring
	- Logical backup devices
	- Backup types
	- The ufsdump command and the ufsrestore command
	- The cpio command
	- The tar command
	- The dd command
	- Disaster recovery
	- Forgotten root password

Booting and Shutting down
	- The boot sequence
	- The boot prom loader
	- Initialisation states ( run levels )
	- Startup scripts
	- Shutting the system down

Packages
	- Installing packages
	- Removing packages


As you can probably guess, I got those heading direct from the literature I
was
given when I attended the course.
The course I attended was excellent. Each person had a machine to themselves
with
which we could practice what the instructor was teaching us.  The machines
weren't brilliant ( Intel's not sparcs ) but they were adaquate.
The course went very well ( apart from the bit where I managed to convert
the
home partition into swap space ).

Overall, a very good course.

Subject: Study course *Sort of off-topic*


Hi all,

I'm a newbie to Unix/Linux in general but I'm having fun. So far I'm
running RedHat 6.0, upgraded to 3.5 Xfree86, staroffice, netscape and
the general install stuff.

Wanting a career in the Unix networking (Not a big Microsoft fan), I've
decided to do some courses on Solaris through Sun.
As people in the computing industry, I wouldn't mind some opinions on
the courses they offer. Not nec. first hand experience, but want the
general consensus is.

I'm currently completing my second year of a Bachelor of Information
Technology degree at Flinders, but now I'm taking time of  to do some
private study.
I'm planning to do a basic MCP (NT4 or Win2000 server, from home)
Then either the administration or networking course through Sun.

After this I'm not planning to go back to Uni unless I can't find work.

Thanks for any responses I get, it's just that I don't want to sign up
unless I know exactly what to expect (Its big bucks when your a
student).

mdk.
