I missed alex's sugestions... but i agree with you.
Ive seen systems with many partitions and cannot see a point to it.
I have 3x2Gb hdd's in my linux box and i used software-raid to aviod having
lots of partitions... made file storage a lot more simple, esp when one
group of data files grew over the 2Gb mark.

&gt; A while back Alex Garner proffered us with the following advice on disk
&gt; partitioning: <A HREF="http://linux.nf/partrec.htm">http://linux.nf/partrec.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; I would like to take a somewhat contrary possition.
&gt;
&gt; Firstly, I agree with Alex's opening comments about the best partition
&gt; layout; that is, it depends.
&gt;
&gt; However, having been involved in partitioning disks for perhaps 10 or more
&gt; years, I prefer a simpler approach, and then choose to complicate it
&gt; depending on my requirements. I have seen the root partition on one
&gt; particular vendor's UNIX OSes grow from 16MB to 128MB over time, and have
&gt; seen all sorts of complicated partitioning schemes.
&gt;
&gt; For a simple home install, or even a workstation install, I go for placing
&gt; everything in one partition. It is just simpler, as you don't have to mess
&gt; around with a number of partitions and manage space for a number of
&gt; partitions. I am always finding a reason to load those extra files, and
&gt; don't want to have to manage space.
&gt;
&gt; These days, Linux will even swap to a file, so you do not need to create a
&gt; swap partiton. Simply create a swap file (if the installation script will
&gt; let you get away without a swap partition):
&gt;
&gt;    dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=2048 count=65536
&gt;    mkswap -v1 /swapfile
&gt;    swapon /swapfile   # and add it to fstab
&gt;
&gt; However, if you have a disk that is larger than 8.4GB, then you may need
to
&gt; create a small /boot partition. 20MB should be enough. Then put everything
&gt; in the remaining space.  The need to create the small boot partition is
&gt; because of the 1024 cylinder problem.  OTOH, if you have a modern BIOS
that
&gt; supports EDD (since some time in 1998), you can use LILO-21.4.4.  It can
&gt; boot from anywhere on a disk larger than 8.4GB.
&gt;
&gt; If you are planning to upgrade to the next version of some distro, then
you
&gt; might want a more complex setup, mainly so you can ensure that a new
&gt; version does not blow away important files.  However, RedHat does a good
&gt; job of upgrading from what I have seen, so this is not necessarily a
reason
&gt; to complicate your life. And in anycase, you will have to save all your
&gt; config files if you are doing a reinstall.
&gt;
&gt; Next good reason for complicating things is if you are running a server.
&gt; Then you will probably want a clean separation of system files from other
&gt; files.
&gt;
&gt; Here you will probably want a separate partition for /home, so user's data
&gt; is separate from everything else.
&gt;
&gt; You might also want a separate partition for /var so that /var/spool and
&gt; /var/log under contol. This helps to prevent you from being DoS'd via mail
&gt; and causing lots of logging messages.
&gt;
&gt; If you are ultra cautious, you might also want /tmp and /usr/tmp on a
&gt; separate partition (you could symbolically link them to directories in the
&gt; same partition as /home), and then you will want to mount everything
except
&gt; / and /usr with the nosuid option.  This helps eliminate a whole class of
&gt; security problems.
&gt;
&gt; I would still be tempted to put / and /usr in the same partition. After
&gt; all, disks are so damn big these days, that it is silly to live by rules
&gt; created when 80MB removable RM03s or whatever were big.
