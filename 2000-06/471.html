Hi.

Reading freshmeat the other day, I fell over buildkernel and I have to say, it
was (last night) the most painless kernel upgrade that I have done.

buildkernel has a couple of command-line switches, but the simplest for most
would be:

   buildkernel NEWESTSTABLE

Which goes off and checks (what is the latest 'stable' kernel?), downoads the
source from kernel.org if it isn't already on the system, configures, builds
and installs the kernel with pauses at the appropriate places for you to
modify/check the settings.

On my system, there were 2 minor problems with the build: 

1. the directory name for the modules directory was correct, but the system was
looking for a directory with a space at the end of the name:

depmod: depmod: Can't open /lib/modules/2.2.16bk1 /modules.dep for writing 

Now that might have been my doing during the configuration (it WAS late). I
solved it with a symlink in the /lib/modules directory.

2. the lilo.conf part of the process did not transport my append="mem=256M"
onto the entry for the new kernel. This was not a show stopper.

So, with buildkernel, and a local repository for the 2.2.16 kernel source
accessible over the ethernet, all your new systems could have the latest kernel
applied, and the new users experience a relatively painless kernel build,
repeatable at home with the addition of a ~14mb kernel source download.

fwiw

&gt; Considering the seriousness of the security bugs in
&gt;  linux kernel 2.2.x for x &lt; 16, I think it would be a good
&gt;  idea fro someone to demonstrate to the non-cognoscenti
&gt;  how to re-build and install the 2.2.16 kernel.
&gt;  That could be interesting for people who already know
&gt;  how to do a basic installation.
&gt;  
&gt;  Here's a neat article on the loss of face caused by the
&gt;  security problem:
