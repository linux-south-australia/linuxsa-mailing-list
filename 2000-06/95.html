&gt; You'd think there would be some International Standard
&gt; Cabling Institute which has a web site for explaining all
&gt; this stuff.

Crossover cables are documented in Figures 14-20 and 14-21
of IEEE 802.3-1998.  An international standard, no less.

It points out that you may need to terminate the unused
pairs into an isolation transformer.  The implication being
that unterminated crossover cables have nowhere near the
reliable drive length of standard 100BaseTX.  They should
only be used for short hauls, such as interconnecting
switches or computers that are in the same room.

&gt; We are still in the medieval era of the Internet and computing
&gt; generally, in my opinion. Future generations will look at
&gt; documentaries of our era and gasp!

IEEE want you to pay for the standards, even when they are
developed using volunteer labour.  Lots of people are
unhappy about this.

There's a neat parallel with monkish orders and their limited
distribution of the holy books that makes your "medieval"
claim particularly apt when applied to the IEEE.

&gt; Are there any of you ISP characters out there running
&gt; any off-the-shelf software to do access bit-rate evaluation?

www.consult started out by measuring the dialup performance
of most ISPs and still do so.  If you are in the industry it
is worth purchasing.
