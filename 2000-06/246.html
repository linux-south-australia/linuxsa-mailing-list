&gt; Where can I get a newer version of httpd?

First of all, httpd is the http server daemon.  There are a number of
these, but AFIK the most popular Linux-based server is Apache
(<A HREF="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</A>), as it ships with most (if not all Linux
distros).

To answer your question in the following mail, httpd is the generic name
for a http server daemon.  Apache is a specific implementation of a
server deamon that supports the http protocol.


&gt; Is there a different document that might help me?

The documentation that comes with Apache (in the RPM version anyway) is
extremely helpful in getting it up and running.  Once you get it up,
there is a nice suite of HTML documentation that you can browse
(pointing your browser at your newly opened server; in the RedHat ver
anyway) that will help you configure it better.


&gt; Do I have to have a box dedicated to being a server? If I do how fast
&gt; does it have to be, will a 486DX2-66 be fast enough?

I have a DX4-100 (with 48M and a 1G HDD) doing the same thing... the box
i have isn't dedicated.. it runs a literal shitlooad of other tasks
including serving home dirs to Winblows boxes in Samba and to Linux
boxes via NFS (at the same time).  On top of this, I use it as my
Internet Gateway (IP Masq, and masq proxies).  I was interested in
Apache as it gives me a good web server and facilities to proxy HTTP and
FTP requests via its proxy module (simplistic approach but it really is
better for me than running Apache AND squid!).

I can't run apache anymore 'cos I really screwed something when i was
configuring it and haven't bothered to find out what because it is low
priority.  MEmory is the primary constraint.  If you don't have more
than about 16M (32M by the time you add file shares and other daemons
that you'll want running) you'll probably be disappointed by the
performance.  This is assuming it is just a server, and not running X...
if you run X then expect to need 64M (for best performance) by the time
you load Apache, and possibly sendmail, samba, ftpd, etc you'll chew
through RAM, and when they spawn off for new connections the disk will
hammer...

Back to topic, the best place to look is the apache website above. 
There is a HOWTO somewhere about how to set Apache up as a proxy
server.. this may be a good place to start, as making it a web server is
not all that much different.  I do not know of a HOWTO for configuring
Apache as a web server tho... try <A HREF="http://www.linux.com">http://www.linux.com</A> for HOWTOS.. they
offer a nice searchable interface..

Cheers,
Adam
