&gt; Can anyone give me their opinion of the Mandrake distribution of linux?

1. Works quite well, does an especially good job recognising the latest
   hardware even in laptops

2. There isn't a brand-new package or kernel that they don't include :-)
   Very much a bleeding-edge distro

3. They do try very hard to give a good desktop experience

So don't be too surprised if a few things bite. Mandrake are really brave
about trying new things and creating new projects to solve problems in an
open source manner. Be prepared to get their latest RPM for whatever. But
also be prepared for a development group that is pretty responsive.

&gt; I like to know before I attempt to download the ISO-image file on my
&gt; 56k modem

It surprises me that there isn't a local service for hot-off-the press ISO
images. Would there be a market (at, say, $10 a CD) for such a thing? I
wanted several CD recently and it was a bit of a pain to get them (recent
versions of FreeBSD, Debian and Mandrake.)
