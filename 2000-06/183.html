Let me begin by giving my apologies for not posting to the install fest mailing list, I can barley keep up with this mailing list let alone two and I am interested in what others think about this. I have thought about this topic, and with the new install fest coming up, I thought that it could apply due to the number of new users we can expect to attend.

One of my biggest problems with Linux so far as been a lack of applications easily available, and keeping them up-to-date. While there has been more than enough applications to keep me occupied; acquiring them is my biggest problem. I do realize that allot of the application (like Word perfect 8, Star Office, etc, etc) are available from the net for download but that isn't practical for allot of people for various reasons (restricted download limit at my case). 

What I'd really like to see (in particular at Install fest) is a BCD available with the latest versions of software around. I like to have the software physically available on BCD, just in case something does happen to my files and I do not have to worry about downloading things again.	I think this would be a good benefit to people that do attend Install Fest, as it would give them a secure method of maintaining the applications which allot of them would probably want.  

How this could be implemented I'm not sure, the BCD would not be for free by any means we would have to charge for the price of the BCD, etc and keeping up with possible demand could be a problem. However, even if we only had a few original Cods available and some people with BCD-R that were willing to burn copies for those that wanted them. I can bring a few blank BCD-Hrs that I have but not that many.

What software you'd want to include is a big enough topic in itself, there are many opinions about what software is better than what and one does have to take into consideration of storage space. The big applications like Star Office, Word perfect, the latest version of Gnome, an ICQ clone, etc, etc I think would be nice; but hey they are the applications I'm after and I don't know if this is Word perfect what others want.

I hope that I've made some sense, feel free to rebuke anything I've said; I'm still tired!!

Just out of curiosity has a date been set for Install Fest yet??
