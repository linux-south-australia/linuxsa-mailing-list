You were right. The card isn't at 0x12c.
However, when I tried insmod ne io=0x300, which is the correct
address, I get the following error messages.

Using /lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o
/lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_open
/lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ethdev_init
/lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_interrupt
/lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol NS8390_init
/lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: unresolved symbol ei_close

I'm guessing I did something wrong when I re-compiled the kernel
for the NE2000 card driver support but I don't know what.

Any ideas?

&gt;Hello all.
&gt;
&gt;I'm having problems adding a second network card to my server.
&gt;It's an ISA NE2000 compatible card that works fine in other
&gt;computers but seems to be giving me problems in this one.
&gt;
&gt;On bootup into Linux the following messages are displayed
&gt;
&gt;insmod: /lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: init_module: Device or resource
&gt;busy
&gt;insmod: /lib/modules/2.2.14-5.0/net/ne.o: insmod eth1 failed
&gt;kernel: ne.c: No NE*000 card found at i/o = 0x12c

Ummm, are you sure the card is actually at 0x12c? What address is the other
card at? This usually indicates that the card can't be found where you said
it was.

Try probing some other obvious addresses, like 0x340, 0x320, 0x280 with the
insmod command:

  insmod ne io=0x340

and so on.

&gt;What's going on?
&gt;This has been bugging me for ages. I even tried removing the old 
&gt;Mandrake 6.0 installation and installing Redhat 6.2 to get it to
&gt;work. No luck. I have compiled support for the NE2000 in the kernel
&gt;and tried using netconf to get it to work.
&gt;
&gt;Help.
