Thanks to all for your help :)
soon I'll be making many network cables :(

&gt; can someone tell me the proper wiring for these cables? (or point

&gt; I read somewhere it was:
&gt; 
&gt; 1 --&gt; 3
&gt; 2 --&gt; 6
&gt; 3 --&gt; 1
&gt; 4 --&gt; 4
&gt; 5 --&gt; 5

&gt; 7 --&gt; 7
&gt; 8 --&gt; 8
&gt; 
&gt; for 10BaseT crossover cables...but I have nfi if this is right.

That wiring agrees with what I bought from Jaycar (using the
multimeter to check), and with the 568A to 568B diagrams I've found
on the net.
A suitable reference would be:

This is a pretty good run-down on the whole ethernet
UTP cabling. My reference for the ATM cross-over cabling is at:

<A HREF="http://www.interphase.com/docs/usrguides/5575/5575fg.html">http://www.interphase.com/docs/usrguides/5575/5575fg.html</A>

You'd think there would be some International Standard
Cabling Institute which has a web site for explaining all
this stuff. But it seems to be one of those folk-lore things.

We are still in the medieval era of the Internet and computing
generally, in my opinion. Future generations will look at
documentaries of our era and gasp!
(In fact, I gasp already on a regular basis.)

Cheers,

PS. Internet Access Performance Evaluation Tools.

I'm looking for software to evaluate ISP access links.
So far, I've found what appears to be the final word on
this topic: webperf, at

<A HREF="http://webperf.sourceforge.net/">http://webperf.sourceforge.net/</A>

Does anyone know of any other software which is comparable
and in general use.
The webperf software appears to be Perl scripts to
regularly do download speed tests to a given set of
servers, and collect, organise and display them.

During the next 5 years when Internet access technologies
are changing rapidly, I expect that the ability of a
sys admin to check the real end-to-end performance of
their link will be important - not just the bit-rate from
them to their ISP, which is the rate most people are quoted.

I've tried freshmeat.net, which is useful.
Are there any of you ISP characters out there running
any off-the-shelf software to do access bit-rate evaluation?
I guess you would only do this if you're proud of your
real access rates. And that doesn't include most of
the ISPs in the world!
