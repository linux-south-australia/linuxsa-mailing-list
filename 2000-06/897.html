 &gt; Wanting a career in the Unix networking (Not a big Microsoft fan), I've

 &gt; As people in the computing industry, I wouldn't mind some opinions on

 &gt; general consensus is.
 
I used to teach them.

They're not too bad - They teach you to do everything "The Sun Way",
which is good enough to also make it fairly obvious how to do other things.
They don't go under the hood much, though, so you might come out of them
with a whole lot of thoughts about "The Right Way To Do Things" without
necessarily understanding why, leaving you with the impression that it's
all heavy voodoo.

A good instructor can rectify that, though:  There is a *lot* of fat
in the Sun courses (not like the SGI ones, which are a bit like trying
to get through a race because they packed so much into them).  Instructors
who know their stuff can use some of the extra time to explore the innards
of related topics;  For example, when discussing single-user mode I found
that many of my students had their eyes opened a bit when it was shown
that you can achieve single-user mode by killing all the processes and
disabling all the port monitors, and that single-user mode can support
multiple users if you type "inetd".  Those sorts of things demystify some
of the black magic in UNIX for some people, and they realize that some of
the features they've never really thought about before aren't that special
after all. :-)

 &gt; I'm currently completing my second year of a Bachelor of Information
 &gt; Technology degree at Flinders, but now I'm taking time of  to do some
 &gt; private study.

You'll do ok in the Solaris ones then.  The earlier courses in the stream
begin on the assumption that you have very little UNIX experience (yes, 
even the introductory sysadmin courses :-), so if you've played around 
with it at uni you'll be left in good stead.

 &gt; I'm planning to do a basic MCP (NT4 or Win2000 server, from home)

Why bother?  A few thousand dollars to learn all about a spec which MS
will change in a few months when the next Service Pack comes out :-)

Seriously, MCP, MSCE, whatever aren't worth as much as they sound:  The
industry in general looks *very* cynically on those credentials becuase
it's well recognized that they don't mean anything:  Who *really* wants
to know that you've demonstrated your ability to use tens of thousands
of dollars worth of Microsoft products to solve the contrived and twisted
examples they put up in the labs?

 &gt; Then either the administration or networking course through Sun.

The networking one is fun.

 &gt; After this I'm not planning to go back to Uni unless I can't find work.

You'll find work.  There's a shortage of good UNIX system admins.  Sign
up with one of the IT-related job agencies and you'll be ok.
