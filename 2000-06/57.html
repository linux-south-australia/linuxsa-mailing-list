Question 1:
UTP cross-over cable for ATM cards.

This is not an exclusively linux question, although I need
the answer for a linux/atm question.

Does anyone in Adelaide know where to get a UTP cable
with the following cross-overs?
1 &lt;--&gt; 7, and 2 &lt;--&gt; 8.

The UTP cross-over cable I bought from Jaycar a couple of
days ago has the cross-overs 1 &lt;--&gt; 3 and 2 &lt;--&gt; 6, which are
suitable for 100 Mbps ethernet (586A to 586B wiring).

I really don't want to buy a $35 crimping table to make
my own cable.

-----------------------------------------------------
Question 2:
Flash rom/ram with IDE interface.

Someone mentioned some time earlier that there's such a
thing as a flash ram or rom module with an IDE interface.
I just can't remember who told me and in what context.

Does anyone know where you get these flash ram/rom modules
which have IDE interfaces in Adelaide?

This is all part of my little linux/atm high-speed shaper
module project. Ejecting the disk drive should increase
reliability a fair bit.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.


===================================================
PS.
Has anyone out there actually done any MP3 file creation
under linux? If so, what do you use?
I've got a copy of the bladeenc software, which
I plan to build some day. But there seems to be a dearth
of MP3 software out there. Whenever I follow links in
places like freshmeat.net and icewalkers.org etc., they seem
to lead to software which has been withheld due to legal
considerations.
All I want to do is record my own stuff from a 4-track
tape deck to MP3 for distribution over the net.
(That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.)
