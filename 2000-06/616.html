&gt;&gt; Have a look at Figure 8.1 in: <A HREF="http://linux.senet.com.au/LDP/sag/c1919.html">http://linux.senet.com.au/LDP/sag/c1919.html</A>

&gt;&gt; It is wrong, AFAIK.  Login on from a console and type ps.
&gt;
&gt;In what sense?  It is _slightly_ wrong, in that login will loop 2 or
&gt;more time snarfing your username and password (on the initial attempt,
&gt;however, it is fed the username by getty).  Oh, and /bin/sh should be
&gt;fed a "-" to indicate it's a login shell.  And /bin/sh is most likely
&gt;/bin/bash these days.  But apart from these two things (three, damn[1]),
&gt;it looks OK.  What's troubling you?

Well, whenever I log in via a console or a terminal, and do a ps, I see
more processes running than bash and ps.

I am claiming that the user's shell is *not* exec'd by login, rather login
forks and then exec's the user's shell. There *is* a big difference.

I have not checked the source, but the evidence seems to suggest that I the
diagram is not correct.
