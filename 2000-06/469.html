&gt;  &gt; probably guns, drugs (including socially acceptable ones - alcohol and
&gt;  &gt; nicotene), porn, etc.
&gt;  &gt; all the things which have lead to the development of our modern utopian
&gt;  &gt; society *cough*
&gt;
&gt; Something tells me that all of those things have been available since
&gt; well before 1859.  Something also tells me that, despite their continuing
&gt; availability, our society is in such a better state now when measured
&gt; against historical standards that it staggers me that anyone can blame
&gt; those things for the "decay of our society" with a straight face.

actually, i simply said that to make a point that we're not the utopian
society we so often claim to be, with all our whiz bang inventions and the
like.

not wanting to start a flame war, just out of interest, how does one measure
a society against historical standards?

is it the morality of the people? modern society is quite off the rails
there, i think
is it the amount of war/killing occurring? same thing
is it the level of technology? try explaining that to someone in a third
world country
is it the brilliant leadership of western countries? i've never met someone
who didn't complain about their government
is it the cleanliness of the environment? i don't even want to start...
is it the tolerance of those around us? did someone say KKK?

as the (in)famous ms. hanson once said, "please explain"

benno

"knowing what has made us free.. unity, not uniformity"
