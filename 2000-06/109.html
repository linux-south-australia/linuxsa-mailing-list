&gt; Finally, Ross Williams of Rocksoft has much to say on this 
&gt; subject, including the question of guarding against 
&gt; creeping corruption that otherwise might slowly infitrate 
&gt; your backup copies until undamaged originals are lost.  See 
&gt; the Rocksoft site, "The Tao of Backup":
&gt; 
&gt;         <A HREF="http://www.rocksoft.com/taobackup/">http://www.rocksoft.com/taobackup/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; which includes discussing basic and advanced backup issues.  
&gt; For example, the web points out that you should encrypt your 
&gt; backup tapes so that your intellectual property remains 
&gt; secure even if a tape gets stolen.  

Ross has volunteered to give a presentation at LinuxSA on FreeVeracity
(not yet publically released, but it will be by the time of our next
meeting).

If the below sounds interesting to people, please let me know and I
will book Ross in.

Abstract
--------

The FreeVeracity (freeveracity.org) integrity server is a free
implementation of Rocksoft's (rocksoft.com) recently developed
Veracity (veracity.com) TCP/IP integrity protocol, for which IANA
(www.iana.org) has allocated TCP port 1062. Following a symmetric key
exchange, which establishes a DES3-CBC encrypted TCP connection, a
FreeVeracity client requests information about a FreeVeracity server's
file system. The server returns a small snapshot containing filenames,
file attributes and the cryptographic hashes of file contents. By
comparing the snapshot with previous snapshots received from the
server, the client can identify unauthorized changes in the server's
file system. By repeatedly connecting to many such servers, a
FreeVeracity client can monitor the integrity of the file systems of
an entire network, making it a powerful security tool. FreeVeracity is
released under The Free World Licence (ross.net/fwl) which makes it
free (with source code) for all free platforms including GNU/Linux,
FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. The same functionality is available for
commercial platforms in Rocksoft's Veracity product, allowing a
heterogeneous network to be monitored from a single client. The
presentation will provide an overview of the FreeVeracity software
and, if possible, a demonstration on Linux.

Dr Ross N. Williams, the author of Veracity and FreeVeracity, is
Managing Directory of Rocksoft Pty Ltd (rocksoft.com), a South
Australian software company that produces the Veracity (veracity.com)
and FreeVeracity (freeveracity.org) data integrity tools that are used
by organizations around the world for network security, document
notarization and many other applications. Ross obtained his Ph.D. in
text data compression from the University Of Adelaide and is the
creator of comp.compression and the FunnelWeb (ross.net/funnelweb/)
literate programming tool which he used to write Veracity. His
