We are using Linux purely for the reason of cost at the moment..its the
one area I have a chance of sneaking in a Linux box

The problem occurs on my machine running IE5.5 beta, and another running
normal IE 5.... but Ie4 and netscape are fine.  Mozilla M16 is having
trouble..but i have a fair bit of trouble with it so who knows.

i have also tried multiple sites

&gt; Wow, weird!
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think a tcpdump will help you much here, it's obviously
&gt; communicating
&gt; with squid...
&gt; 
&gt; Do all machines running ie5 do exactly the same thing?  Is it perhaps a
&gt; machine-specific problem?  Some stupid undocumented registry thing?
&gt; 
&gt; For the record, I run lots of IE5 clients on win95/98 here and they all get
&gt; https sites through squid perfectly.
&gt; 
&gt; And - could it be only that one https site?  Maybe the site doesn't like
&gt; your
&gt; IE5's or something?  Where did you install IE5 from - vendors often do
&gt; freaky
&gt; things to IE5 installation cd's...  for example, the title bar on my IE5
&gt; says
&gt; "Sitename - Microsoft Internet Explorer provided by [someoneorother]"...
&gt; 
&gt; I know!  Install and run Microsoft Proxy (and all the associated client
&gt; thingos).  That's a much better solution.  That linux stuff is all too
&gt; complicated anyway.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Example of IE5 log entry:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; gblundell - [25/Jun/2000:10:12:03 +0930] "CONNECT
&gt;  &gt; www.networksolutions.com:443 HTTP/1.0" 0 0 TCP_MISS:DEFAULT_PARENT
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Example of Netscape 4.7:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; gblundell - [25/Jun/2000:10:12:03 +0930] "CONNECT
&gt;  &gt; www.networksolutions.com:443 HTTP/1.0" 0 185 TCP_MISS:DEFAULT_PARENT
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Only difference is in the data sent back as far as i can tell.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Havent tried tcpdump admittedly...will look into
&gt;  &gt;

&gt;  &gt; &gt;
&gt;  &gt; &gt; What do the logs say when IE5 tries to connect to https sites?
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Anything? Does a tcpdump help?  Does anything go from the windows
&gt;  &gt; &gt; machine to the squid machine across the network?
