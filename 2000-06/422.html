This email I wrote as a bit of an instruction manual to myself.

There has been a lot of talk about patching the Promise Ultra 66 to make it
a Fasttrak 66. e.g. slashdot, tomshardware etc. The logical progression is
to get it going under linux with a current kernel. This is where things got
real fun, especially when lilo would not write the MBR to make linux
bootable on my hardware. (lilo appears to do its thing but no boot , not
even a lone l)

Might as well post it to save others all the hassles involved, especially if
like me lilo will not correctly write the MBR on the system.

These steps are not for the faint hearted, and you will be using Beta,
experimental and anything in between drivers. Lilo may not work and you will
need to #%!@#%@#$ around with loadlin and a bootstrap DOS partition.

My config is IDE mirror (2 x 20 GB Fujitsu) on a MSI 6163 PRO M/B and
Celeron 500, Trident 975 PCI NIC (so I can Overclock without having to worry
about AGP timing), Intel pro 100 NIC, 128MB PC133 RAM + CD-rom on primary
master M/B IDE controller

I have it all working now !!!! (2.2.15 kernel)  The Drives are in UDMA 66
mode and it runs. I have successfully removed a mirrored drive and have had
it continue working. Rebuilding 20 GB mirror takes a while though!

Have not yet explored Raid -&gt; Linux HDD fail notification signal .

This makes basically a linux system bootable straight off the mirror using a
small mirrored loadlin dos partition to bootstrap the linux system.

It was a bit of a drama (i.e. one whole days worth but it runs beautifully
now)

Things you will need!
	a) Time 
	b) Internet access - you will be relying on driver downloads/patches
etc
	c) A win98 Boot disk
	d) A Redhat 6.0 CD-ROM (&lt; 6 won't work and my 6.1 also failed)
	e) The actual hardware you are going to use
	f) Your Brain

Steps 1-3 only if you are doing the Patch thing on an Ultra 66 controller

1. Obtain and get a Promise Ultra 66 IDE controller
2. Flash it with the latest Fasttrak Bios (current stable 1.20)
3. Solder 100R resistor from pin 23 to gnd (Sandwich with screw to
backplane)

(This I have done numerous times without issues for Win x Flavours. I also
have a REAL commercial Fasttrack to compare against)

4. Install RAID controller in system, and configure drive array in Bios  (No
dramas here)
	 Forget about trying to run a normal CD-rom RH install, it will not
work, as there is no support for the IDE controller.
5. Boot from Win98 boot disk, use Fdisk and create a small DOS partition
(mine is 24 MB FAT 12). 
	This is a really necessary step to make it bootable as you will have
some real fun with Fdisk in Linux on this controller.. (make this partition
active) (I have played with latest LILO and various compile options without
avail) 

	Reboot of floppy and format this partition.
	 Make sure it is bootable!

(An ASIDE
You may dislike MS, but putting a mini bootable DOS partition on any system
like this is a great idea as you can use it for
	a) Keeping DOS Flash, NIC setup etc utilities handy
	b) Keeping copies of backup Kernel images and Loadlin
	c) Getting access to CD-ROM for small files 
etc)


6. Go to www.promise.com and download the Beta drivers and rawwrite a boot
disk
   You now require a Redhat 6.0 CD (my 6.1 one did not work and hung after
CD detection)
   Boot from this floppy, press enter at boot prompt
  Select 1 as the first boot

7. Redhat installation should now start
	Partition drives as minimum
		Small Dos created at step 5 (mine is 24MB Fat 12 for
loadlin, flash utilities etc - absolutely required as lilo will not work - I
also mount as /dos)
		A Boot partition (to make sure there are no 1024 cyl issues)
		A swap partition
		Your / partition + any more you would like.
	You can in dual boots of course have the DOS any size you like and
any FAT flavour.
		
		
   continue as per normal but at set time zone , shell out (Alt-F2 and run
./cpu66) this copies files from floppy to /root
   shell back and keep going as normal

8. It will crash and burn when it trys to run.
9. Reboot off floppy and at boot type
	"rescue root=/dev/hdxx initrd=initrd.img" 
		xx=your root mount point mine is /dev/hde7 
at prompt select 2 for second boot

This will get you into system	
	the kernel running has nothing going on it (i.e. you cannot mount
VFAT or any other partition types which is a real BUGGER!$#@$)

Make sure you have mtools installed, if not install it of Redhat CD (mount
-t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom will work thank God!)

In root run 
	sh setup-u66
this file is what is copied over with the cpu66 command. It copies the
loadable module into the system and creates a new initrd using mkinitrd +
preloads the IDE module.

Now copy from /boot the active vmlinuz and initrd files.

10. Prepare DOS partition

	a) Copy Files from Win 98 boot floppy to the DOS Partition
	b) Modify the Files Autoexec.bat, setramd.bat to point to C: instead
of A:
	c) Modify config.sys to remove unnecessary drivers (not essential)
and remove these drivers
	d) From CD copy Loadlin to DOS partition
	e) Copy vmlinuz and intrd files from floppy to DOS partition
	f) In Config.sys and Autoexec.bat insert new option to boot linux
		Autoexec command will be
		"loadlin vmlinuz root=/dev/hdxx initrd=initrd" 
		changing vmlinuz,initrd and hdxx as appropriate to match
your files and mount point
	
11. Reboot of DOS Partition, and start linux 
12. Linux should boot with proper 6.0 Kernel now (at last)

This gets you basically going. Now you wish to upgrade the Kernel again.
Have fun, even using the setup-U66 as a guide it refuses to boot.

I have it going with the following way.

13 Copy Kernel source over (I am using 2.2.15)
14 Obtain IDE patch for Kernel from
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick/</A>
15 Patch Kernel using "patch -p0 &lt;Patch file name&gt;" in directory containing
the linux-2.2.15 source directory tree
16 Now recompile Kernel making sure you include the PDC20262 IDE driver
option (added by patch)
	+ if you are game the experimental raid option directly beneath it
(It is called something different but I cannot remember)
17  Make dep, Make bzImage etc as per usual
18. Run "mkinitrd /boot/initrd.000 2.2.15 to make a initrd file 
19. Copy the bzImage and initrd.000 files to the dos partition
20. Modify autoexec.bat to reflect new Image files (eg "loadlin bzImage
root=/dev/hdxx initrd=initrd.000)

Reboot and all should be working.

Big sigh of relief allowed now :)
