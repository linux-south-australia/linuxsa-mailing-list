&gt;Hi...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; For personal reason, I upgraded Win95 to Win98, but noticed during the
&gt;&gt; upgrade process the LILO prompt didn't appear.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I get the impression this has been removed from my MBR while upgrading.
&gt;
&gt;Bingo, everytime you re-install or upgrade your OS the MBR gets re-written
&gt;to suit that particualr OS be it Linux, Windows, BeOS etc.

Well, at least Linux allows you to choose not to write the MBR ...

&gt;&gt; My question, Can I somehow replace the LILO to my MBR without having to
&gt;&gt; lose everything on my Linux partition - that is, if it already hasn't
&gt;&gt; been removed. As per normal, Windoze is only showing me what is left on
&gt;&gt; my windoze partition.
&gt;
&gt;Don't worry, your linux partition is still there, to get it back do the
&gt;following:

Yep, it sure is.

&gt; - If you created a boot disk during the linux setup, boot from that and
&gt;re-run lilo by typing /sbin/lilo from the prompt

Yes, that is one way.

&gt; - If you didn't create a boot disk (shame, shame, shame) grab your install
&gt;CD and perform an upgrade of your linux system. This re-writes the MBR with
&gt;LILO without trashing your system

Well, no need to do that :-)

If you used RedHat, then use the following command from the boot prompt
from the RH Install CD:

   linux single initrd= root=/dev/hdax

Where hdax is the device where the root file system is.

This tells it to boot into single use mode, and to bypass the installation
script and to set your root file system to what is on the disk.

Then, since your lilo.conf has the right things in it, simply type:

  lilo -v

And it will write a new MBR with LILO, and since it was already set up for
dual booting, you should be able to reboot and all will be ok.


&gt;HTH
