Wow, weird!

I don't think a tcpdump will help you much here, it's obviously
communicating
with squid...

Do all machines running ie5 do exactly the same thing?  Is it perhaps a
machine-specific problem?  Some stupid undocumented registry thing?

For the record, I run lots of IE5 clients on win95/98 here and they all get
https sites through squid perfectly.

And - could it be only that one https site?  Maybe the site doesn't like
your
IE5's or something?  Where did you install IE5 from - vendors often do
freaky
things to IE5 installation cd's...  for example, the title bar on my IE5
says
"Sitename - Microsoft Internet Explorer provided by [someoneorother]"...

I know!  Install and run Microsoft Proxy (and all the associated client
thingos).  That's a much better solution.  That linux stuff is all too
complicated anyway.

 &gt; Example of IE5 log entry:
 &gt;
 &gt; gblundell - [25/Jun/2000:10:12:03 +0930] "CONNECT
 &gt; www.networksolutions.com:443 HTTP/1.0" 0 0 TCP_MISS:DEFAULT_PARENT
 &gt;
 &gt; Example of Netscape 4.7:
 &gt;
 &gt; gblundell - [25/Jun/2000:10:12:03 +0930] "CONNECT
 &gt; www.networksolutions.com:443 HTTP/1.0" 0 185 TCP_MISS:DEFAULT_PARENT
 &gt;
 &gt; Only difference is in the data sent back as far as i can tell.
 &gt;
 &gt; Havent tried tcpdump admittedly...will look into
 &gt;

 &gt; &gt; What do the logs say when IE5 tries to connect to https sites?
 &gt; &gt; Anything? Does a tcpdump help?  Does anything go from the windows
 &gt; &gt; machine to the squid machine across the network?
