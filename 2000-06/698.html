&gt; &gt;From a VERY precursory look you have partitions EVERYWHERE.
&gt;
&gt; 1) Windows
&gt;
&gt; If you've installed Windows AFTER Linux it won't boot and it WILL hijack
&gt; the MBR. Hence this could be your problem. Windows will NOT boot off an
&gt; extended partition (and if it does it would require more hacking than
&gt; you have done).
&gt;
&gt; 2) Linux
&gt;
&gt; Linux would boot off an extended partition but it looks like Windows
&gt; might have clobbered it.
&gt;
&gt; ADVICE (miscellaneous)
&gt;
&gt; * don't put windows on an extended partition
&gt;
&gt; Not sensible. There'es four partitions available. Give one to Windows.
&gt; UNICES can deal with more than 4...Windows fucks them up. Simple as
&gt; that.
&gt;
&gt; * install Windows FIRST then Linux
&gt;
&gt; Let Windows screw up first. Then install somthing that works.
&gt;
&gt; * chuck Windows off the drive Linux is on
&gt;
&gt; Windows can sit on a secondary drive if LILO is sitting as boot master.
&gt; Put Windows by itself. It's easiest. In addition, generally Windows can
&gt; only f***k itself up.
&gt;
&gt; I'd say that Windows is the boot loader and it's trying to load. And
&gt; that Windows is absolutely f****d and it can't. Not much to do with
&gt; Linux at all eh&gt;?
&gt;
&gt; REMINDER
&gt;
&gt; If you install WINDOWS it will trash your system. Full stop.
&gt;
&gt; What do you expect&gt;?

Hi.

I actually had Windows installed previously, and wanted a dual-booting
system.  For whatever reason, defragging didn't do
its job and there were "unmoveable" blocks towards the end of the disk.
The largest partition size I could make was 63 Meg.

Because there were some files I *had* to keep, I shifted those into the
newly created second partition (which was formatted
VFAT), installed Linux and overwrote Windows entirely (putting LILO into
the MBR).

So Windows actually doesn't exist on my machine, and it *looks* as if hda5,
hda6, and hda7 are logical partitions inside hda1
(which looks as if it's become and extended partition).

So:

1.  The presumption that I installed Windows on top on Linux is incorrect.
It was in fact the other way around.

2.  Windows *isn't* on an extended partition.  It just plain doesn't exist
anymore.

3.  "Not much to do with Linux at all, eh?"  Well, that's not an accurate
statement.  It *is* to do with Linux (not Windows),
since Windows isn't even on the machine, Linux was installed afterwords and
I didn't have to boot from a floppy when I was
using Windows!!!

Anyway, whilst I'm happy with Linux I really would like to boot from the
hard drive.

R,

Paul.
