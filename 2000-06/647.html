Hi David,

You might want to have a look at PSGML for Emacs and XEmacs.  It
does a very nice job of editing SGML (and thus XML and HTML).

I'd also add DocBook/XML to your presentation.  The SGML version
of DocBook is likely to die as soon as the XML tools are stable.
You'll notice that all the DocBook developers are now working
on XML tools, mostly written in Java.

The Apache/XML web site has code and links to most of the other
sites.  It's all very beta quality, but you can see it spells
the end of SGML as a document source format within the next
year or so.

However to move a DocBook document from SGML to XML is a two-line
change, so there's no rush to start writing documents using
DocBook/XML.

&gt;   - Jade/OpenJade and using DSSL Style Sheets to render the SGML

As part of the move to XML, DSSSL will be supplanted by XML
Transformations.  So whilst I'd mention that DSSSL exists and
demo setting some trivial parameter, I'd stear clear of big-time
Lisp programming.

&gt; For those that don't know, DocBook is the accepted standard for writing
&gt; documentation for the Linux Documentation Project.

It's also used by O'Reilly for their books.  The source for their book
"DocBook: the definative guide" is on the web.

Some of the examples in the book don't work on Red Hat Linux, due
to their braindead packaging of the SGML DTDs.  I've sent them bug
reports and patches.

Glen
