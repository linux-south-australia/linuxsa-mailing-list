&gt; after years of not getting spam emails, I have recently started getting
&gt; a constant trickle to my home email address. Can anyone recommend an
&gt; appropriate method of dealing with this annoyance that has some chance
&gt; of success, i.e. cause the senders computer to burst into flames, cause
&gt; the FBI to go to their house and kick their doors down, have their
&gt; internet access removed, etc etc. It's spam of the variety 'register now
&gt; and earn an income on the internet by sending spam like this to the
&gt; world.'

Your best bet is to pop up the full headers for the mail and find out
the SMTP server where the mail originated.  You can send mail to
<A HREF="mailto:abuse@that">abuse@that</A> domain and inform them.  You could also look at the spammers
email (if they include a "unsubscribe" notice it is likely not faked and
will go to the spammer).  Use NSLOOKUP to find out the mail host for the
spammers domain and send a message to abuse/postmaster @ that domain
also.

Hotmail/Excite/Yahoo/other freemail services have very strict policies
on spam, so if it is from one of those forward it to abuse@ and add a
short message about it being unsolicited and they will can the account
within about 12 hours.

Alternately, try
Spamcop:	<A HREF="http://spamcop.net/">http://spamcop.net/</A>
Chooseyourmail: <A HREF="http://www.chooseyourmail.com/spamindex.cfm">http://www.chooseyourmail.com/spamindex.cfm</A>

Both of these allow you to forward spam and they trace it and act on
it.  Remember to enable forwarding with FULL headers in your mail
package (in netscape you have to have view full headers enabled or it
only sends the To: Subject: and From: headers).

Hope this helps any and all that get attacked by the ruthless
bottom-sucking scum that are spammers!
