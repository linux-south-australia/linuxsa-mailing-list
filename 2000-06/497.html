 &gt; Ok if your going to be doing transactions, don't use Mysql. But doing

Well... No :-)  Because you used the word "writes".

A database on the web is a shared data repository, right?  And you're
allowing multiple writers to this shared repository, or simultaneous
readers and writers, right?  Then you're going to run into synchronization
issues eventually.

If you hadn't said the word "writes", then I would have given a very 
different answer :-)

Again - The synchronization issues can be solved by locking, either at the
database level (table locks) or the application level ("I'm about to do a 
deposit, so I'll acquire an fcntl() lock on *this* file, and all the other
parts of my application which need the same tables also know that they're
supposed to get a lock on the same file.").  But surely life is easier
(and probably quicker) without that overhead, given that there are several
database products out there which do all of that automatically without you
needing to care about it?

In the end, I find that a lot of people who say, "mysql is great, mysql
is great, mysql is great!" have some kind of emotional attachment to it,
and they either haven't tried other databases to see if the speed difference
is worth the hype, or they don't fully understand the horribly complicated
synchronization issues invoked by parallelism.  And if they have tried the
competitors, they've done it by just taking their existing mysql-pessimized
applications with their overbearing application-layer locking protocols,
where it isn't the least bit surprising that the app runs like a pig on
a real DB.

Yes, mysql has its place;  If I was writing a discussion forum a-la
slashdot, where it wasn't the end of the world if things just went missing
with no explanation, I'd consider it; but if I was an online vendor trusting
it to give me customer orders reliably, or a customer expecting it to
keep my bank account details reliably, I'd be much happier to see a site
back-ended by a real RDBMS.
