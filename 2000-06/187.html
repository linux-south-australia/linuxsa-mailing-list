If we can organise this, it should be possible -- we'll need plenty of blank
cds, a burner or two, and people who know what they are doing... We could
offer to burn people a CD full of Stuff for $5, which of course, will go to
meeting the cost of the CDs and the cost of the event... We just need to be
organised enough to have servers with the appropriate images (or archives,
or whatever) on them, well-organised, so we are able to either pick and
choose what we want, or have a number of standard images that have certain
popular tools on them...

Good idea though...

rr

&gt; Let me begin by giving my apologies for not posting to the 
&gt; install fest mailing list, I can barley keep up with this 
&gt; mailing list let alone two and I am interested in what others 
&gt; think about this. I have thought about this topic, and with 
&gt; the new install fest coming up, I thought that it could apply 
&gt; due to the number of new users we can expect to attend.
&gt; 
&gt; One of my biggest problems with Linux so far as been a lack 
&gt; of applications easily available, and keeping them 
&gt; up-to-date. While there has been more than enough 
&gt; applications to keep me occupied; acquiring them is my 
&gt; biggest problem. I do realize that allot of the application 
&gt; (like Word perfect 8, Star Office, etc, etc) are available 
&gt; from the net for download but that isn't practical for allot 
&gt; of people for various reasons (restricted download limit at my case). 
&gt; 
&gt; What I'd really like to see (in particular at Install fest) 
&gt; is a BCD available with the latest versions of software 
&gt; around. I like to have the software physically available on 
&gt; BCD, just in case something does happen to my files and I do 
&gt; not have to worry about downloading things again.	I think 
&gt; this would be a good benefit to people that do attend Install 
&gt; Fest, as it would give them a secure method of maintaining 
&gt; the applications which allot of them would probably want.  
&gt; 
&gt; How this could be implemented I'm not sure, the BCD would not 
&gt; be for free by any means we would have to charge for the 
&gt; price of the BCD, etc and keeping up with possible demand 
&gt; could be a problem. However, even if we only had a few 
&gt; original Cods available and some people with BCD-R that were 
&gt; willing to burn copies for those that wanted them. I can 
&gt; bring a few blank BCD-Hrs that I have but not that many.
&gt; 
&gt; What software you'd want to include is a big enough topic in 
&gt; itself, there are many opinions about what software is better 
&gt; than what and one does have to take into consideration of 
&gt; storage space. The big applications like Star Office, Word 
&gt; perfect, the latest version of Gnome, an ICQ clone, etc, etc 
&gt; I think would be nice; but hey they are the applications I'm 
&gt; after and I don't know if this is Word perfect what others want.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope that I've made some sense, feel free to rebuke 
&gt; anything I've said; I'm still tired!!
&gt; 
&gt; Just out of curiosity has a date been set for Install Fest yet??
