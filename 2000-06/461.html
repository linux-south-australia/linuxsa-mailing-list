&gt; Howdy All,
&gt; 
&gt; Prior to upgrading from a 2.0.36 kernel to a 2.2.x kernel, I
&gt; could use a nifty little utility called 'irqtune' to increase 
&gt; the interrupt priority of my serial port. This enabled the
&gt; modem to get much better throughput rates when I was doing
&gt; other stuff (eg. compiling, starting xterm sessions, etc..) 
&gt; which caused moderate disk and CPU activity.
&gt; 
&gt; Now that I've got a 2.2.14 kernel, irqtune doesn't seem to
&gt; work and even moderate disk/cpu activity causes the serial
&gt; port to effectively "stall". The only way that I can get
&gt; decent throughput (ie. 3.5kb/sec or faster with my 56K
&gt; modem) is to stop doing anything that causes disk activity,
&gt; otherwise I'm lucky to get 2-2.5kb/sec.

serial interrupts are insignificant. No matter which hoop you jump thru,
twiddling a character interrupt's priority is not meaningful. A character
*must* be read, there and then, as a response to an interrrupt. Since these come
in at a very steady rate, they have to be handled, there and then. This is a
tiny white lie because a small amount of fifo buffering in the uart allows the
interrupt which occurs for each character to be handled with some latency, but
as an agregate, the entire character stream must be handled regardless,
irrespective, and no matter what, when it wants the cpu to handle it and not
the other way round.

Secondly, as stated, 56k data rates are insignificant. A single serial channel
swallows no practicable cpu crunch. There is oodles of time to go off disk
crunching and other tasks. This area is not your problem.

The likely culprit for poor transfer rates (note poor, not lost) is
compression. Make sure you have BSD compression turned on in your kernel. Do
this just after dialling up your isp

tail /var/log/messages

look for complaints from pppd that it can't find compression modules 21 and 25
and change your /etc/modules.conf (cont.modules = redhat) to

alias ppp_compress  bsd_on

also check that 'setserial' has the option vspd_hi  (not 100% on that you will
have to man setserial for the correct syntax.

Anyway, not knocking your ideas about rasing the priority of handling _packets_
of data on serial lines, but interrupts is not one of them.
