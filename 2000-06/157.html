Hi,

&gt; Hi, I'm going to be setting up a moc firewall system just so that I can
&gt; practice bits and pieces. I was going to use SPARC 5's as the external
&gt; and internal firewalls but am a bit worried about how differant a SPARC
&gt; 5 is compared to a PC.

Do you mean SPARC 5 or Sparc Ultra 5 ?

If the latter, they have a PCI Bus, but only IDE Hard Drives. Linux runs
well on them (better than Slowlaris in my opinion).

&gt; 
&gt; Basically, I need to be able to have 2 NIC's in each system, and the
&gt; systems I'm buying only have 1 NIC.
&gt; How do I go about getting another net card....do they take PCI, can you
&gt; get them easily second hand?

There is one inbuilt interface, and a second could be added via a PCI slot
(PCI network cards are ~$100, but check SUN's site for Hardware
compatability, and your distro's site for support for that hardware).

&gt; 
&gt; Are there any other factors I should be aware of?
&gt; Any feedback would be appreciated.

I've had no experience past running a Sparc Ultra 5 under RedHat linux as
a Web/Proxy server. For that it was very stable (we've had all year as
uptime, shutdown due to a power outage), and I think very fast.

If its BUS is up to forwarding I don't know.

cya
