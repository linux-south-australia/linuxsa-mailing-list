Well, thanks for the reply. I'm pretty sure it's just a SPARC 5, not
ultra.

The firewall would only have ADSL traffic maximum (1MB second) so I
assumed that the system bus would be able to handle that...time to check
out the specs.

I've had another reply which painted a pretty dull picture of working
with these machines...I've got VERY limited linux knowlege...do you
think I'd be able to get by?

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm going to be setting up a moc firewall system just so that I can
&gt; &gt; practice bits and pieces. I was going to use SPARC 5's as the external
&gt; &gt; and internal firewalls but am a bit worried about how differant a SPARC
&gt; &gt; 5 is compared to a PC.
&gt; 
&gt; Do you mean SPARC 5 or Sparc Ultra 5 ?
&gt; 
&gt; If the latter, they have a PCI Bus, but only IDE Hard Drives. Linux runs
&gt; well on them (better than Slowlaris in my opinion).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Basically, I need to be able to have 2 NIC's in each system, and the
&gt; &gt; systems I'm buying only have 1 NIC.
&gt; &gt; How do I go about getting another net card....do they take PCI, can you
&gt; &gt; get them easily second hand?
&gt; 
&gt; There is one inbuilt interface, and a second could be added via a PCI slot
&gt; (PCI network cards are ~$100, but check SUN's site for Hardware
&gt; compatability, and your distro's site for support for that hardware).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Are there any other factors I should be aware of?
&gt; &gt; Any feedback would be appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; I've had no experience past running a Sparc Ultra 5 under RedHat linux as
&gt; a Web/Proxy server. For that it was very stable (we've had all year as
&gt; uptime, shutdown due to a power outage), and I think very fast.
&gt; 
&gt; If its BUS is up to forwarding I don't know.
