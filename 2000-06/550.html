I don't think it is true.  I think it might have been a different list (is
there an echo in here?) and if some of us scoffed it was probably at the way
Christians so often display ignorance of their own principles.

I never noticed you to be a boor before, Brian.  Define "unusual." Anything
less than 50%?  I suspect most people enjoy some sexual act or fantasy
(which is a better definition of "preference" than that which nature
dictates) which is unusual by this defintion.  Unproductive?  If you refer
to gay sex, and I'm sure you are, there's nothing unproductive about it.
It burns off calories; is a lot of fun; helps two (or more) people to stay
close (pardon the pun); and can sometimes be nutritous.  In short it's
pretty similar to straight sex.  Did you mean unreproductive?  No, that's
what (you hope) happens with contraceptives.

Here's a fact.  Gays never systematically tortured people for refusing to
"follow the faith."  It seems somehow evil, don't you agree?, for an
organisation to force it's beliefs upon others, specifically when those
others aren't hurting anybody, and are maybe even living by the cannons of
that organisation.  "Do as I say, not as I do," is surely time honoured.
Especially in religious circles.

Wow, you really seem to have struck a nerve with me. :-)
