&gt; My friend has a Toshiba Tecra 8000 laptop.  We are having problems with
&gt; the 2.2.15 kernel.  It boots fine with the 2.0.36 kernel, but recent
&gt; attempts to boot the 2.2.15 kernel have it freezing at the line
&gt; 
&gt; 	"running ntpdate to syncronise clock""
&gt; 
&gt; or something like that.  Now I suspect the problem has nothing to do with
&gt; ntpdate.

I was wrong.  The problem was ntpdate.  It was trying to poll the internet
while not connected to it.

Cheers,

Mark.

&gt; We have had problems with this kernel ever since it was
&gt; compiled.  Previously we have had the problem that the console keyboard
&gt; freezes, making it impossible to use the machine, except when it was
&gt; connected via ethernet and you telnetted in from outside.  We "overcame"
&gt; this problem by getting it to boot straight into xdm (kdm).  This meant we
&gt; didn't need to get near the consoles in order to use the machine.  Of
&gt; course we still couldn't use the consoles with much success.  Recently,
&gt; changing to a console results in a blank screen with a thin horizontal
&gt; line running across it.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, now it won't even boot at all which is a real problem.  I
&gt; suspected the problem may be an apm one, but when I booted with the option
&gt; "apm=off" it still hung at the same place!
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what's wrong or what I can do about it?  It's very
&gt; frustrating.  Clearly it's some difference between the 2.0.36 kernel and
&gt; the 2.2.15, but if it isn't power management, what else could it be?  Any
&gt; other kernel options that could be causing the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; 
&gt; Mark.
