&gt; Hi!
&gt; 
&gt; I am having an internal, philosophical debate as to which one of this
&gt; might be better under the following circumstances:
&gt; 
&gt; * no licencing issues
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be prepared to pay a reasonable licence to each of them hence
&gt; MySQL's pay if you make money policy doesn't really make a difference to
&gt; me.
&gt; 
&gt; * no need for subselects or transactions that are able to be rolled back
&gt; 
&gt; The application I would use the SQL database doesn't require either of
&gt; these features that MySQL currently lacks
&gt; 
&gt; * no need for an OO or procedural internal specialised language
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I'd prefer to leave procedural stuff out of SQL and besides,
&gt; why learn yet another language when PERL::DBI can help you out&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, I guess my question lies in:
&gt; 
&gt; * speed (given same factors, eg same machine, same hard disks, executing
&gt; the same set of commands)
&gt; * efficiency in stored database format
&gt; * ease of administration/installation
&gt; * security issues

This doesn't really help, but may be of interest.

Don't know about Postgresql. But with Mysql, one reason for its good
speed/reliability is the 
fact that it was ALL written form scratch. IE. it wasn't built on top
of old code. They didn't keep old code/modules etc. They wrote
everything using the latest technologies in algorithms, code structures
etc.

Some complex features, that are rarely used, have been left out, again
to improve speed. I think the 2 you mentioned above are examples.

We have been using Mysql for all or clients. Had no problems so far. 

&gt; 
&gt; Any comments would be appreciated. If the list thinks this is off topic
&gt; - which it might - then please e-mail me directly about the matter.
