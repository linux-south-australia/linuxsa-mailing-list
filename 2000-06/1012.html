Hi All,
    I received my "ATO Electronic Commerce Interface" for
"The New Tax System" yesterday. Amongst other things on the
wrap that comes with it , it says :

    "Apple Macintosh and Unix (TM) versions of the ECI
Client Software are in the final stages of development and
expected to be available in the near future. Please contact
ESD Technical Support to arrange for a copy of the version
you require to be sent to you once it is available."

    On further enquiry as to if this meant a version would
be available for Linux I was informed "yes" by the
consultant and promptly ordered one. So is this still
"anti-competitive"? I await to see how long it takes, but is
seems to me that the government _May_ have got it right this
time (well the Tax Office anyhow).
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

P.S. Oh GOD! I just stuck up for the Tax Office AND the
GOVERNMENT all in one sentence. I have already rang the
Psychiatrist and he is sending around some nice men with a
special jacket with funny sleeves.......hahaha.....Bill
Gates is my hero!....HAHAHA.....The check is in the
mail.....HAhaHAha........BANG!...Clunk CLUNK!............

Subject: GST & the ATO


&gt;Greetings,
&gt;It seems to lodge your BAS with the ATO electronically &
other things
&gt;you must have Win95x/NT4 & the Microsoft Java virtual
machine,
&gt;(Microsoft & Java:- there's an oxymoron for you).
&gt;Banks are doing it too. I really have had enough of this
sort of
&gt;rubbish.
&gt;The industry best-practice is to go for
platform-independence on the
&gt;client-side.
&gt;
&gt;I was talking to my new house-mate solicitor who happens to
be an
&gt;E-Commerce law specialist & mentioned forcing your clients
to use
&gt;brand-x
&gt;support product for your services is illegal.
&gt;
&gt;I can't remember the exact term she used, but it is a
recognised
&gt;anti-competitive business practice.
&gt;I'll be looking at what avenues can be used to rectify this
situation,
&gt;(ATO Ombudsmen, ACCC, my local MP...)
&gt;Anyone like to offer their support/suggestions/comments?
&gt;
&gt;--
&gt;Regards,
