That's easy to do, because Sendmail has to process the headers, so
it has the hooks in there necessary to do so.

&gt; I would rather filter based on the content of the mail, rather
&gt; than the subject.

Of course, otherwise you're increasing the risk of a false positive
(filtering a subject line based on the word "joke" is no solution).
Which Sendmail, per se, doesn't do.  However, there are other methods
you can use: intercepting it as mail is being delivered (via procmail,
which was one of your original suggestions), or funneling unprocessed
messages through a custom mailer then redirecting it back into sendmail.
As you said, milter should hopefully open this up to some much grander
methods (spam alert based on a averaged messages-per-second would be
a nice idea), although it's still marked as experimental.  Interesting
to note that the 8.11.0 betas are out already - there seems to be a
frenzy of development in sendmail.
