Hi, I have been reading this list for a while and have seen a number of posts
from people who have lost their windows partitions or linux partitions etc and I
have just thought .. it'll never happen to me!!!  how wrong could I have been?!
This morning I went to boot into linux Mandrake 7.0 and it gets to a kernel
panic.  huh? I thought?  worked ok 2 days ago fine!

I then booted into win2000 ( I quad boot with win2000, win98, win NT4 Server and
linux) and tried a program for viewing ext2 partitions under windows and it only
showed my /boot partition... :-(  Still hoping for the best I then checked using
windisk and it confirmed that my /, /home, swap and shared partitions have
gone!!  so three different partition types have gone (my shared partition was
FAT and I used it to share files between all 4 operating systems).  Once more I
wanted to be certain so I booted in win98 and looked at Partition magic 5 and
aaaAAAAHHHH!!!! it really was gone!!  now you must be wondering what could have
happened just like I was.  This is when I decided to ask my wife Marisa if she
had done anything different to the computer when checking for email (she prefers
win2000), the truth then came out..  she accidently clicked on the win2000 disk
administrator program icon which I had placed next to outlook express in the
shortcut bar.  then seeing her mistake she clicked onthe X to get out of it but
instead of closing it caused an error message and crashed (so much for win2000 )
and she continued on her merry way.  So thats the long and short of it?  ANy
suggestions? I guess I can use Tiramisu to recover the FAT partition but I
assume that the ext2 partitions are gone for good and I had only just finished
downloading the whole of gnome helix!!

If any one can help with recovering the info I would be forever in your dept (no
not really but I would be very appreciative)

thanks

Matt
