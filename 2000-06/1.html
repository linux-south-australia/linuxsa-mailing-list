Need some opinions, folks!

Thanks to the efforts of a few people (particularly David Newall), a
surprising number of things are falling into place based around a potential
early July InstallFest. This is earlier than we originally wanted, but it
does solve a few of the harder issues (money, venue, etc...) It leaves us
with much less time (4-6 weeks) to organise and publicise the event, but
(assuming all goes to plan) gives us an excellent venue, and some
_potential_ guests from AUUG -- see David's email from a few days back. Do
people have any comments on how realistic they perceive this timeframe to
be? Would we really gain a lot by pushing it out to August or even
September? Particularly if it means we end up with a lower quality venue
that we have to pay for ourselves... Would we be able to get sufficient
publicity in less than one month? I have a feeling we could, but am looking
for opinions...

Sorry about the vagueness of so many of these details, but they will all
become clear by Monday at the latest...

Also, sorry for using the main list for this thread, but the new one is
fresh, and no-one is on it yet :)

Thanks
