The reason why i thought of wasting my time in such a manner, after all
theres a phd to write, was that i have the following interesting problem.
large database of possible drug compounds, receptor structure. 
each drug/receptor is a separate problem. 

what i would envisage is lots of these running the calculations. we
already use spare cycles on all the machines around here (nt linux sgi
suns the power challenge) but simply by having say 1000 processors they
may be slow but eventually we can brute force the solution. the clusters
are already working on parallel problems, short of buying a 64 processor
power challenge i thought it might be nice to use old n64 or playstations.
seems to me alot of nice chips will be lying around when new games
consoles come out that should be put to use. after all there's nothing
wrong with them. 

all they need to have is simply a ethernet interface and a really basic
kernel. thats it.

i might spend some more time on it, and let you all know how it goes.
i do after all have a linux beowulf cluster to design too :)

any one with ideas, comments  or suchlike please email me. 
perhaps it might become a serious project.....

i'll just go do some reading....

cheers for the url

&gt; If this strikes anyone as a strange thing to do then read Alan Cox's
&gt; "Space Aliens Ate My Mouse" paper on porting Linux to the 68k Macintosh.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think it is a pointless thing for grown-ups to do then reflect a
&gt; little on the history of Russell King, who was busy porting Linux to a
&gt; hopelessly outdated little RISC machine called the Archimedes that just
&gt; happened to have design features well ahead of its time - to find that his
&gt; port to the ARM chip suddenly took on great significance when the core ARM
&gt; technology started being licensed to major European and US companies and
&gt; manufactured in volume. Now he sits in the UK hacking on the kernel all
&gt; day.
