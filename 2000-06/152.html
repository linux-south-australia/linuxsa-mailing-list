&gt; After having had enough with Netscape yesterday, I am now most joyously
&gt; running Mozilla M15. Slower than Netscape, but seems really stable. No
&gt; Java issues to worry about either, as it doesn't work under Linux yet
&gt; :-)
&gt;
&gt; Mind you, I'm still using Netscape 4.73's mail client, as M15 has a
&gt; little more to go in that area (although it does handle profiles quite
&gt; nicely! At last!)

Hi all,

Netscape is weird indeed!
I am using Netscape all the time, even though often it crashes because of
java. Many times surfing the Net I can see the Starting Java stuff and I'm
not sure if is going to make it. I do manage to use Netscape most of the time
without crashing though.
I always remove the lock file from the .netscape directory before starting.
It seems to work better this way!
It happens often that I end up with lots of zombies, then I just minimize
Netscape and start all over again. I can do that about three times, before
Netscape won't load anymore.
I've never tried "killall -9 netscape-communicator", I should thank for that
info to the person sending it.
Java is needed to access almost every site these days, unless you confine to
sending mail and text only.
I hope this helps.
Best wishes,

Nick.

PS. Perhaps I should try Mozilla!?
