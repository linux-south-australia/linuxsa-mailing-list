&gt; Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your interest in our InstallFest.  We did receive your prior
&gt; message, in which you indicated a desire to come.  At that time we were
&gt; still discussing dates and venues, and so I asked our group not to respond
&gt; until we were closer to an answer.  We have now almost secured our venue,
&gt; with a choice of dates being July 8 or July 15, and these details should be
&gt; completed by early next week.
&gt; 
&gt; We would love to see you at the InstallFest; and let me also say in answer
&gt; to you email of 31st May, that we would greatly appreciate a donation of
&gt; TurboLinux products.  (We're expecting hundreds of people through the
&gt; doors, and have asked other Linux and Linux related manufacturers for 50 to
&gt; 200 CDs.)
&gt; 
&gt; We hope to have half a dozen or so good, short presentations, I suppose by
&gt; way of "evangelism", and perhaps you could give a non-technical speech; or
&gt; better yet, perhaps an emminent international speaker might happen to be in
&gt; Australia, oh for example John Terpstra might be here, and if you could
&gt; bring that somebody, this would be an excellent drawcard.  ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Are you guys looking for a sponsor, etc?
&gt; 
&gt; We have been fortunate with some very generous businesses donating almost
&gt; everything that we need.  Never the less we will have expenses, the biggest
&gt; being insurance.  We do want this to be a free event, and your sponsorship
&gt; would be particularly valueed, if you care to offer it.  The amount of
&gt; $1,000 would be suitable.  In this case, or even if you can only provide
&gt; CDs, we would like to recognise your contribution by putting a link to your
&gt; company on our InstallFest web site (to go live this coming Monday.)
&gt; 
&gt; May I call you on Thursday or Friday to discuss this?  What is your
&gt; telephone number?
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,
&gt;
