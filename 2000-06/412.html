&gt; &gt; This is from the Mysql Reference Manual 7.23 LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES
&gt; &gt; syntax(in part):
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Normally, you don't have to lock tables, as all single UPDATE
&gt; &gt; statements are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any
&gt; 
&gt; ... and thus the problem when you don't have transaction support - you
&gt; can't do an update that required multiple UPDATE commands without having
&gt; to lock the tables.
&gt; 
&gt; Besides, transactions make it so much nicer when you get to the end of
&gt; 10+ update/insert/delete/whatever commands, and something fails/changes,
&gt; and all you have to do is rollback to get back to where you started
&gt; from....

Yep, totally agree with your point. The point I am trying to make is
Mysql is a brilliant DB for its purpose. If you need a DB for web
pages, its the way to go. Its fast. The internet already is slow, you
don't want an overly complicated DB that slows it down even more.

Transactions can be done with Mysql. If your application requires heavy
transaction support and speed is not an important issue, than I would
go for some other DB. Every application needs to weigh its priorities
to make a decision. We have set up many shop fronts for many years,
with SIMPLE transaction support with no problems.

Considering the original poster said 'no need for subselects or
transactions that are able to be rolled back', I still recommend Mysql
;)
