&gt;  &gt; Thats very bad. Its the type of thing you'd expect from a windoze box,
&gt;  &gt; Not Stable Linux. Is it possible its a hardware problem? Others may be
&gt;  &gt; able to help determine if its hardware or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember that a process can chew up enough CPU time and memory to make the
&gt; system seem to stop, or actually stop responding - that's a failing of the
&gt; application, not necessarily of the operating system.
&gt; 
&gt; Could be that your system has NOT completely locked up, but is running
&gt; incredibly slowly, therefore just looks that way.

It definately did completely lock up, since nothing could be opened on the
falling redhat box, i telneted in from another machine, which must have spiked
a reboot. I never managed to connect, but it did manage to reboot it.

There have been instances when yes i've been able to kill netscape, before it
*commpletely* goes awol.

Though what is notable, the swap useage shoots through the roof past a certain
point, and after that almost nothing helps. With 64mb RAM and a further 64mb of
swap, I fail to see why this amount shouldn't be enough for a box which serves
only two X sessions at the most (the other is a labtam).

Thanks for the suggestions though
Chris
