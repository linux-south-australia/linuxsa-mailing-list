Hi!

Just in case someone else manages to fall over this little "gotcha", I
thought I'd share a bit.

In the configuration file, /etc/ssh/sshd_config [you can call it what
you want but that's the default], you have a setting AllowUser.
According to the man/info pages:

             This keyword can be followed by a number of user names,
separated
             by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed only for users
names
             that match one of the patterns.  `*' and `?' can be used as
wild­
             cards in the patterns.  Only user names are valid, a
numerical
             user id isn't recognized.  By default login is allowed
regardless
             of the user name.

This is blatantly misleading. What this MEANS is that sshd will only
accept connection (or maybe it's one of its PAM modules) if the
connection comes from a login account that PURPORTS to be the user name.
So for example, I had...

(config file)
AllowUser lloy0076
...
(/config file)

When relogged as another user on my local system, it refused the
connection. The command I was using was:

% ssh -l lloy0076 localhost

Everything else was set correctly. After a significant amount of manual
reading, I decided (as a last resort) to remove the AllowUser statement
from sshd's config file. Once I had done this, my ssh logins worked.

Therefore....the manual page for OpenSSH 1.2 is wrong. It should read:

  This keyword can be followed by a number of user names, separated by
spaces. If specified
  login is allowed only from accounts that purport to be one of the user
names...

It's a small irritation. I think I'm going to write a mini-howto to set
it up.
