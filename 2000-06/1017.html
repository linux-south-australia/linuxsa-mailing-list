It's fixed now.

Thanx to Richard and Tom who put me on the right track (and Suse's YAST its really
cool)

I installed Suse6.4, after much depression, as trial.  It had been on my desk for a
couple of weeks so I needed a break from trying to fix MD7.1.  Ne'ways it seems that
when KPPP is launched it modifies the resolv.conf file.  It adds the ISP's DNS and
attaches a comment like so

( nameserver  XXX XXX XXX XXX #temp by kppp )

This was NOT happening with MD7.1 all that was in place was

(         empty space here        #temp by kppp) NO name servers.

If I had put the DNS info in during the install it would have found it and used it.
However, when I opened KPPP and added the DNS info this is where is has a "hang
up"   It appears that it does not read this new addition to the network and hence
empty namserver temporary files were placed in the resolv.conf file.... phew.

On hind-site, actually I did not restart the network, maybe that would have
helped!!!

So thanx again all who helped and the superb YAST that provided clear explanations
of what I was fiddling with and what I needed to do for the changes to be effective.

I really liked suse, she and I could go steady :-)  if she would only let me use
Gnome as the default.

I know how Alice felt now, the hole went deeper that I imagined :-)

&gt; Thanx to all who have replied, it has been a good learning experience.
&gt; I am now able to ping outside sites and telnet, however, when I use Netscape I
&gt; get "unknown host" even if I use an IP number.
&gt;
&gt; I hope this may help the experienced guys out there a little more, thanx for all
&gt; the help so far.

&gt; &gt; Have you got a file called /etc/resolv.conf? Should look something like this
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; nameserver 139.134.5.51
&gt; &gt; nameserver 139.134.2.18
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; without it you can dial up and connect but as you say you go nowhere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Try adding usepeerdns to /etc/ppp/options and when you dial you should get
&gt; &gt; /etc/ppp/resolv.conf which you can either copy to /etc/resolv.conf or make
&gt; &gt; a symbolic link to.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am having problems getting connected, not with the connection to my
&gt; &gt; &gt; ISP that goes fine,  but I cannot get to the INternet from there.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have had no problems with md 6.1, 7.0 and after much frustration
&gt; &gt; &gt; reinstalled 7.0 and hey no problems at all.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I put 7.1 back on with NO network settings, just a modem connection and
&gt; &gt; &gt; tried again, same problem.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Once connected to the ISP I can't ping or  telnet any site, NOT even the
&gt; &gt; &gt; remote address given to me by the ISP.  The terminal just hangs until I
&gt; &gt; &gt; press crtl-C.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Has any one had similar problems with md7.1?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your help would be appreciated
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thnx
