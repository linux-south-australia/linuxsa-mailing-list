No.

&gt; Which Sendmail, per se, doesn't do.  However, there are other methods
&gt; you can use: intercepting it as mail is being delivered (via procmail,
&gt; which was one of your original suggestions), or funneling unprocessed
&gt; messages through a custom mailer then redirecting it back into sendmail.
&gt; As you said, milter should hopefully open this up to some much grander
&gt; methods (spam alert based on a averaged messages-per-second would be
&gt; a nice idea), although it's still marked as experimental.

We could always set up some kind of rule that sends all mail to a
'/dev/null' mailer. ;-).

Mmmm Oblivion.

&gt; Interesting
&gt; to note that the 8.11.0 betas are out already - there seems to be a
&gt; frenzy of development in sendmail.

Yes, it appears that at the moment, they are trying to deal more with
SMTP AUTH various security measures that are similar. I actually
thought, though, that they were up to 8.11.3 beta. I'm probably
mistaken.

&gt; Regrds,

&gt; 
&gt; PS - Your horde thingy is still putting backslashes in front of apostrophes.

I know. I hardly use it myself, but I still don't have time to track
down that problem.
