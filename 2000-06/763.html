Howdy people,
	I have come across a problem with getting linux up and running and was
told that I could get help on this mailing list *grin* I recently
installed redhat 6 on a SCSI drive. My hope is that I could use loadlin
off my existing IDE drive (win98) to load linux. To do this of course I
need a kernel on the IDE drive (well that is the impression i'm under).
Well, since the SCSI drive is now formatted to the linux FS, I can't get
to it from windows and thus I can't get to the kernel. So I copied the
only kernel I could find from the red hat cd to the IDE drive and used
that to get linux started. Problem is, it won't detect my scsi host (but
redhat did detect it during installation). My thoughts were that perhaps
the explicit scsi host driver needs to be compiled into the kernel or
something similiar but I have no idea how to go about doing something
like that :) I'd be very appreciative if someone could help me out on
this one. Thanks in advance

Regards,
	Daniel Marshall
