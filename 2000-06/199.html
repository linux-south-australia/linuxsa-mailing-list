&gt; &gt; Hey Michael, I notice that you would be a good person to ask:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How does Turbolinux compare to RedHat? Does it use RPM's?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes TL in RPM based.

This doesn't mean TL is necessarily binary-compatible with RH. But the
means of manipulating the .rpm's are identical to Mandrake, LinuxPPC and
everyone else.

Mandrake does make RH binary RPM compatibility a goal, but TL doesn't.
However there's a higher chance of TL &lt;-&gt; RH interop at the binary RPM
level than with SuSE. TurboLinux branched from Red Hat 4.2, whereas SuSE
has never had anything in common with RH at all and Mandrake branched at
5.1 (or was it 5.0?) As distributions converge on standards set down at
www.lsb.org these differences will diminish, but I suspect they will still
remain. It is also worth noting that RH is the slowest of the
distributions to conform, as can be verified by running the test suite (I
haven't heard results for RH 6.2, maybe someone can update me.)

This is where you run into the whole business of binary RPMs being a
dubious thing; there's multiple possibly-incompatible maintainers of
binary RPMs for any package - just look at rpmfind.net (Ah, that reminds
me - Werner Ackermann sent me a message about the new packaging
replacement being developed by the RPM and apt developers that I should
pass on to the list.)

&gt; &gt; Would you consider it to be as polished a product as RedHat?
&gt; 
&gt; It depends what you mean by polished - a GUI installer? Well then yeah,
&gt; they win.

You might like however to compare GUI installers across distros - the RH
one is generally reckoned (see reviews on the web, I'm not the only one!)
to be behind the Caldera and Mandrake installer, and maybe on a par with
SuSE's Yast2 depending who you ask. But there's more to a distro than the
install. For example, Caldera's beautiful installer doesn't make it a
distro I particularly recommend to average desktop users.

Another thing to talk about in terms of polish is the quality of the admin
tools. If you are a RH user you probably know about all the cute graphical
tools available for doing various things, most of which are only partly
functional. In the case of Turbo there is a set of character-mode tools
called turbonetcfg, turbohw, turbothis, turbothat which don't tend to be
as broken, mostly. I shouldn't say too much more since I've just received
a prerelease version of the latest TL, so I can see how things are
progressing.

Debian has a similar concept, implemented in a much less flashy manner but
the tools work well. Debian have a really well-defined policy manual
though, which helps a lot. It also has a much stronger concept of package
ownership than within the commercial distros, which tends to mean if not
better quality packages then at least better communication about their
problems.

One thing to note about TurboLinux is that they do not have an open
development model for their distro. My personal (doubtless
to-be-criticised:) list of distros in order of openness goes like this:
Debian, Mandrake, RH down to ones that don't really rate at all on the
openness scale such as SuSE, TL and Caldera. The RH and Mandrake
programmes are similar (Rawhide and Cooker, respectively) but the Mandrake
one seems to be much more of a genuine committment. I'll defend that with
examples if it upsets someone.

&gt; the developer or Network Administrator, but in so saying a normal user
&gt; can still use the environment without much trouble, you can use KDE or
&gt; GNOME.

Incidentally John Terpstra is keen on getting the TurboLinux Enlightenment
install better, I was talking with him and Carsten at the Sydney show
about it.

&gt; ClusterServer - our proprierty code that hooks into our TL server 4
&gt; version. We can cluster 2 to 254 nodea on a network and them some. We
&gt; cluster Web, smtp, ftp and other ip servers. It is very different to RH
&gt; Pirahna and it's not the same as LVM.

Errr, no, I wouldn't expect it to be the same as LVM (check your terms)

&gt; We have an agreement with the Open Source community in that our
&gt; ClusterServer Technology source code will released in about 6 to 8 mth.

I think you mean that TurboLinux has undertaken to do so, there is no
"Open Source community" to have an agreement with.

In case you haven't noticed, dear reader, I don't have a favourite
distribution :-) I am very much in favour of the distributions improving
though, and Michael coming forward like this and talking about the
proposed installfest is excellent and should be encouraged in every way
possible. Keep it up Michael, and yes, I do think that TL is a good
distribution.

Regards,

Dan
