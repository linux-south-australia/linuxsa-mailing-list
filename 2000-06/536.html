&gt; &gt; but, I was hoping there would be an easier way of doing it ... eg,
&gt; &gt; converting Ext2 to Fat32... is this possible ???
&gt;
&gt; not that i know of. there are however, i believe, tools for windows that
can
&gt; read your ext2 partition and i think this would be a lot easier. don't
know
&gt; the names of any such programs though, sorry

I'm currently using fsdext2 from:

<A HREF="http://www.yipton.demon.co.uk/">http://www.yipton.demon.co.uk/</A>

with moderate success. That is, it works ok, although I suspect it has been
the probable cause of some problems with Windows (95 and 98) and the author
acknowledges that there are known to be bugs. For me, Windows has exhibited
abnormal behaviour (I know, I know, how do you tell?!), however I am not
aware of any damage being done save for the usual Windows crashing type.

The nice thing about this one, I find, is by having the mount.exe in the
Windows directory, then simply opening up a command window and typing
"mount", which presents a list of all of the disk partitions in the familiar
/dev/hdxx form, and similarly using a "mount devicename driveletter" command
to do the mount itself.

It's a shame the author has discontinued development. For what it is, it's a
reasonable utility and well worth a try.
