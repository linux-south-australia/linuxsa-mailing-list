I think this may already have been covered, but it says here that RH will
offer training in Adelaide... perhaps if we could find out who the training
organisation is, we could get sponsorship from them for the InstallFest...
or maybe from RedHat directly... Anyone have more info?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Red Hat Asia-Pacific, is expanding its training programs.  In addition 
&gt; to the RHCE, Red Hat will introduce three training modules. 
&gt; 
&gt; Introduction to Red Hat Linux(RH033) is for the users who want to 
&gt; customise their Red Hat Linux system for common command 
&gt; processes and desktop productivity roles. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Red Hat Linux System Administration (RH133) course will 
&gt; enable users to 
&gt;  perform system administration tasks such as 
&gt; installation, configuration, and attachments to networks. 
&gt; 
&gt; The Red Hat Linux Networking and Security Administration (RH253) 
&gt; program will prepare a system administrator to be able to setup a Red 
&gt; Hat Linux server and configure common network services and security at 
&gt; a basic level. 
&gt; 
&gt; The RHCE Certification (RH300) requires success on performance-based 
&gt; practical exams, in which users actually demonstrate the ability to: 
&gt; install and configure Red Hat Linux, set up common network (IP) 
&gt; services, and perform essential administration, diagnostic tests and 
&gt; troubleshooting, among other Internetworking and system administration 
&gt; task.  Also available is the RHCE certification exam taken separately 
&gt; (RH302). 
&gt; 
&gt; Course prices are as follows (Australian dollars includes GST): 
&gt; 
&gt;   RH133 Introduction to Red Hat Linux $2195 
&gt; 
&gt;   RH033 Red Hat Linux System Administration $2295 
&gt; 
&gt;   RH253 Red Hat Linux Networking and Security Administration $2395 
&gt; 
&gt;   RH300 RHCE (including certification exam) $2950 (courses taken 
&gt; before June 30th - $2750) 
&gt; 
&gt;   RH302 RHCE exam only $950

&gt; 
&gt; All Red Hat training courses are centered around the latest software 
&gt; release of Red Hat Linux 6.2. and are taught by experienced Red Hat 
&gt; certified instructors with real-world experience. 
&gt; 
&gt; Training courses are conducted in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, 
&gt; Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide and Darwin.  For further information on 
&gt; courses dates refer to
