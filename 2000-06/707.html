&gt; As to what to do now, I dunno.  Maybe I can rework my partitioning?   (I
mean,
&gt; can an extended partition actually be turned into a primary partition
again?)

yes and no. An extended partition is identical in every way to any of the
other 3 primary partitions except for it's flag 05, stating the 1st sector
etc of the disk area it points to contains a table of 'logical' partitions.

if all you want to do is return all sectors an extended partition contains,
back into a simple primary partition, just change it's flag to linux (83),
the hda5/6/7 etc will all disappear.

on the other hand, if you want to recover one (or more) of the logical
partitions it contains into a primary partition, that too is possible by
altering one of the already existing primary partitions to point it's
beginning and ending sectors into the same area (and ultimately, removing
the extended, and logical partition entries altogether). It's all to do with
very simple to follow allocation of blocks of sectors to partition numbers
taking care that no two partitions share any of the sector space of another.
There is nothing 'wrong' for instance in altering the sector numbers of the
first partition to somewhere else on the disk other than traditional sector
one onwards.

The key to it all is that the 1st sector of any partition is always the boot
record of that partition. Everything about an OS, everything to do with the
way that OS formats its region (partition) of a hard disk, begins and ends
with the implicit understand (by the os) that logical sector 1 contains it's
boot entry. Whether than boot entry is used by the os is irrelevant. Dos for
instance automatically places it's directory structure, it's fat, 64 logical
sectors from that beginning point. It is that first sector begin point, you
cannot alter (on a pre-installed or pre-formatted partition).

The other point to watch out for is that no matter which way you swing it,
you cannot have more than 4 primary partitions on any hard disk, not now,
not never.
