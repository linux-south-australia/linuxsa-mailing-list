Hi Oz Linux people,

things are going smoothly for the next installment of the "intense
Linux conferences downunder" experience.

You know how it goes. You spend a few days immersed in talks about
clusters and networking, surrounded by kernel hackers, getting three
hours sleep per night and living on pizza and caffeine. You return
home only to spend the next few weeks in a nocturnal daze of
debugging symbols as you flitter between purging your email backlog
and coding up that long, inspired list of new features you jotted
down on the return journey.  

  A few weeks later, over breakfast, you suddenly realise what
  the heck Dave Miller was going on about in his talk.

With the very keen involvement of UNSW's School of Computer Science
and Engineering, a few of us random SLUG people have teed up a great
location for this event. With Linux Australia's backing and Rusty's
moral guidance, this conference is not to be missed.

Mark it in your diary to be in Sydney for January 18-20, 2001, for
a few days of Linux, beaches, and (hopefully!) fine weather.

The Call for Participation is attached. Please distribute it widely
among usergroups and anyone else who loves Linux.

Conrad.
