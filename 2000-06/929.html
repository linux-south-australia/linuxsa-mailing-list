I have passed on the publicity blurb from the website onto the
SAFM/TripleM Community switchboards and to Andy Wells. Andy has promised
that he will try and put in a couple of spots for us in his computer
updates in his regular segment.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; We have a confirmed date for the InstallFest. July 15th -- mark it down now!
&gt; 
&gt; It will be at Agile Telecommunication's new exchange, at 31 York st,
&gt; starting at 10am, and closing at 5pm, with no new installs after 4pm.
&gt; Organisers will need to be there early, and leave late -- details TBD. Pizza
&gt; will probably be Buongiorno's, which is accessible without going outside.
&gt; There will be two phone lines, and aobut 10 powerpoints...
&gt; 
&gt; Sponsors are:
&gt; Internode (Internet Access)
&gt; Agile (Venue, phones)
&gt; Rebel.net/Tellurian (Tshirt underwriting)
&gt; TurboLinux (probably something nice -- confirmation to come)
&gt; 
&gt; Other stuff is still being organised, but news will come as it happens...
&gt; There is a (beta) webpage up at
&gt; www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/installfest200-beta -- check it out and send
&gt; comments to <A HREF="mailto:michaeld@senet.com.au">michaeld@senet.com.au</A> or the installfest mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; Special thanks to people:
&gt; David Newall
&gt; Michael Davies
&gt; David Lloyd
&gt; Mark Newton & Leigh Hart
&gt; Everyone else who has been contributing -- keep it up, and we will have a
&gt; really great event on our hands.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that time is short, and we need to get things happening really fast
&gt; now, so please don't hesitate to contribute -- particularly tshirt designs,
&gt; which need to be finalised within a day or two...
&gt; 
&gt; Please discuss this on the <A HREF="mailto:installfest@linuxsa.org.au">installfest@linuxsa.org.au</A> list...
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
