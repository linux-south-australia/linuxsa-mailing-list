&gt; Well, in so far as training is concerned, I think I have given more Linux
&gt; courses in Australia over the last 12 months than any other person or
&gt; organization!  I would be interested in hearing from anyone else who would
&gt; like to claim the title :-)

I'd like to, but haven't given a single course... ;)

&gt; After the last one runs here in Adelaide in a couple of weeks time, I will
&gt; have give seven here in Adelaide, and have given courses in Adelaide,
&gt; Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
&gt;
&gt; What sort of sponsorship are we talking about. Perhaps IIT Training an I
&gt; could do something.

We would be looking for some money (this is extremely important at this
stage) to cover desks and chairs, heaters, and insurance. In total, we would
need over $1000, but talk to David Newall about this... Also, we are looking
for business to buy booths, with which to sell their products and services,
etc... Again, David Newall is the man.

IIT training and yourself would be EXCELLENT people to have involved, as it
would display the accessibility of training for newbies, and people invovled
in corporate IT who come along.... We'd be really keen to have you... Please
talk to myself (<A HREF="mailto:rrussell@deh.sa.gov.au">rrussell@deh.sa.gov.au</A>) and/or David Newall
(<A HREF="mailto:davidn@rebel.net.au">davidn@rebel.net.au</A>) regarding this, and I'm sure something can be
arranged.
