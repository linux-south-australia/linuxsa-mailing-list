Incidentally, there's an article in the latest Dr. Dobb's Journal 
(July 2000) by Tim Kientzle [hi, Tim!] comparing MySQL to Oracle.  
PostgreSQL is mentioned but not included in the evaluation.  

The bottom line in the article is that Oracle is industrial-
strength, has oodles of professional support, comes with lots 
of options and carries a well-deserved excellent reputation 
that carries clout in the marketplace, but consumes serious 
hardware and can require serious administrative input in order 
to provide its services.  

MySQL is much lighter and easier to have around, but isn't 
industrial strength.  The article suggests that MySQL works 
well as a development/prototype platform for SQL databases, and 
as a standalone/small SQL database.  It also suggests that if 
you're careful in how you write your SQL, you should be able to 
port the database fairly easily, so changing databases during 
the embryonic stages or while the database is a manageable 
size is a reasonable strategy.  

I know that this summary doesn't entirely cover the ground of 
our discussion, especially the Free Software/proprietary part 
of the PostgreSQL/MySQL discussion, but I'm trying to be careful 
in reporting what the article states.  

[Sorry if I lag the discussion a little... I read the list via 
the digest.]  

cheers,
