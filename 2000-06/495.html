&gt;  &gt; This withdrawal example(select and update). If it is done in one
&gt;  &gt; thread, which is usually the case, you can lock the tables you will be
&gt;  &gt; selecting and updating etc.
&gt; 
&gt; But that's an abysmally sub-optimal solution on a busy site:  By locking
&gt; the tables, you're guaranteeing that NOBODY ELSE can do any deposits or
&gt; withdrawls anywhere in your entire bank while that transaction is in
&gt; progress.  You're essentially turning a nice parallel thread-based access
&gt; model into a degenerate sequential model, and that'll have ridiculous
&gt; performance implications as your site scales.
&gt; 
&gt; You need *row locking*, not *table locking*.  Even better, locking for
&gt; individual cells.  Anything with worse granularity than a row is going
&gt; to slow you down to the point where any speed advantage you get by using
&gt; mysql is utterly worthless.


Hmm... Have to agree with that.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The query with the deposit will then wait
&gt;  &gt; and not time out until the tables are unlocked or until the thread is
&gt;  &gt; closed(which ever comes first). More programming work than an RDBMS to
&gt;  &gt; make sure its all done correctly, but it can be done and will still end
&gt; 
&gt; And, of course, if you accidentally leave something out, you can either
&gt; reach the point where your database deadlocks against itself because you
&gt; forgot to release a lock, or you can do transactions which you've forgotten
&gt; to acquire locks for and produce the exact data-smashing situation which
&gt; made locks attractive in the first place.
&gt; 
&gt; It's much easier to let the database care about that stuff.

Um.. Yep that can happen.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; up cheaper/quicker than most RDBMS.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree.  It'll only be quicker if your site isn't very popular (you
&gt; do want popular sites, don't you?).  Also, it'll almost never be cheaper:
&gt; You actually need to go to special lengths to do your locking, extra
&gt; testing, extra development, etc, etc, and someone has to pay for that.  If
&gt; you use a database which supports transactions, however, you get all that
&gt; for free because the database engine is looking after locks for you.

Ok if your going to be doing transactions, don't use Mysql. But doing
simple reads/writes that don't get in the way of other tables, over the
internet, Mysql is the way to go. Do you agree with that Mark. 

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; I submit that it's possible to design around that limitation, so you
&gt;  &gt; &gt; can still have fast response.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Can you tell me, give some examples. Im very interested in more ideas
&gt;  &gt; on ways to do things.
&gt; 
&gt; That all depends on the specific situation, doesn't it? :-)  That's
&gt; why DBAs and database application authors get paid lots of cash to
&gt; design good systems.
&gt; 
&gt; In the end, though, it'll come back to data modelling, and a thorough
&gt; understanding of how an RDBMS implements the various things you ask it
&gt; to do. For example, by simply changing the order of a comple of nested
&gt; SELECT statements you can sometimes cut down on the amount of unindexed
&gt; data your RDBMS needs to search to perform a query by a factor of hundreds
&gt; of thousands.  See the ars-technica article link Dan provided a couple
&gt; of days ago for some good examples of that (sorry, I deleted his message
&gt; after reading the article)

If anyone has this link can they please send it to me.
