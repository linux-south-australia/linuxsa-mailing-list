&gt; &gt; I am thinking of buying a laptop which will initially have to run Windows.
&gt; &gt; Once this period is over I will attempt to install Linux as well. Is the
&gt; &gt; following plan rational ? in broad outline anyway...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1 Shrink dos partition with fips
&gt; &gt; 2 install favourite distribution at end of drive
&gt; &gt; 3 start linux using loadlin rather than lilo to avoid the 1024 cylinder
&gt; &gt; bios problem
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; David's comments are very true - make sure everything works with Linux
&gt; before you purchase - there are many dud^h^h^hwinmodems out there :-(


...and there are many winmodems that work under Linux as well, despite
the docs that claim they don't, and never will... specifically there is
a series of binary-only modules released to drive the Lucent
Technologies winmodems. They wok very well indeed under Linux, given the
design restrictions that come with such a poorly designed peice of
hardware. From the user's point of view, the only noticable problem is
that when hanging up the modem driver virtually takes all CPU for a
second or two. Very annoying, but certainly not fatal.

Check out the current usenet news groups, and the many email groups, and
if you are unsure ask on them if anyone has got everything working for
the laptop make/model you are looking to buy. This is an area that is
changing quite rapidly. Don't be fooled by old info.

Bruce

oh, good luck, and if you want info about a specific laptop that works
really really well with Linux email me off list.
