All,

I have concluded negotiations with AUUG relating to the InstallFest.  This
event is now officialy, the "LinuxSA InstallFest 2000 by AUUG."  Monies
received will be paid to AUUG, and expenses incurred will be paid or
re-imbursed by them.  Any surplus will be paid by them in the way that we
direct.

The arrangement is mutually beneficial.  LinuxSA has no legal standing and
no bank account.  The matter of greatest concern to us is insurance, which
we are unlikely to have been able to obtain in our own name.  AUUG already
carries public liability insurance, and this now extends, at no additional
cost, to our event.  AUUG will also ensure we meet our GST obligations.  By
putting their name to this event, AUUG demonstrates their commitment and
support to Linux and the Open Source movement.  AUUG hopes that producing
this event will encourage new people to join them.

AUUG is Australia's premier user group focussed on unix and open systems.
Membership benefits include the regularly published newsletter, "AUUGN".
AUUG runs many events throughout the year, in all parts of Australia, with
the their winter conference being the pinnacle of the year.  AUUG's winter
conference this year is "AUUG2K -- Enterprise Security, Enterprise Linux."

Regards,

David Newall
Event Manager
