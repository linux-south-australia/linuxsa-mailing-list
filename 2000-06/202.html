Ok people, lets not get all on our unix soap boxes here. The "GIVE ME VI
OR GIVE ME DEATH" attitude only goes so far.

Think about a commercial environment. I need the ability to edit web
pages while not having telnet access to the server. Ok so ftp. But I
want it to be as easy as frontpage. Frontpage is good and it also blows,
but its there. 

If frontpage were opensource, it would be awsome by now. It really would
be.

p.s. and I wasn't even going to qualify my comment by saying ".. now I
dont love microsoft or anything, but ....." but I just did.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     Emacs, vi and pico are all excellent software tools for
&gt; creating web pages. All you need after that is a good book
&gt; or instruction howto and you are away. All silliness aside,
&gt; my sister is doing Multimedia Studies at Uni (yes they give
&gt; you a degree for advanced web page design now), and she was
&gt; telling me that some HONOURS and 3RD YEAR students didn't
&gt; have a clue on how to actually write HTML because all
&gt; through their degree they only used these software tools to
&gt; create pages and small sites. My advice to you is take the
&gt; time to learn the hard way and you will be much better off.
&gt; For example, do these software tools know how to debug HTML
&gt; when the file is corrupted some way? I don't think so, but a
&gt; human who can create HTML with a text editor can usually
&gt; have the page back in no time. The other problem with these
&gt; tools is that they create pages very similar in 'look' each
&gt; time, to the extent that some of them you just look at the
&gt; page and you can say "Created with FrontPage" etc. Well I
&gt; suppose I haven't really answered your question, but maybe
&gt; this has given you some food for thought anyway.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

&gt; &gt;New to creating Web Pages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Aside from Netscape Composer what good software packages
&gt; are available
&gt; &gt;for Linux users to create
&gt; &gt;a Web Page. Does KDE have anything ?
