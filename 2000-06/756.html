Hi,
    Over the last 6 months ive been spending considerable time designing =
a system that I hope will be up by the 23rd of Jul.
It will be an internet based system for which i essentially need a 24/7 =
connection.

In the long term, the system is aimed at a corporate market, but in the =
first 6 months, it will be tested by university students as a part of =
their software engineering projects.  Since I am a university student =
myself, I dont have ready access to the resources required to put such a =
project online 24/7, I was wondering if anyone here could help.

I have already approached the university about this, but dont like my =
terms, which are required by the nature of the system:
- access to the filing system from a scripting language
- access to a proper ACID compliant database from a scripting language
- command line execution ability from a scripting language (i know this =
is a huuge security issue - one that the final stages of design may =
eliminate)
- access to email facilities (ie sendmail)
- ability to be accessed by all people on the internet (ie not for an =
internal network)
(basically, the system is highly integrated with these features)

It is this last point that made the university say 'no'.  They only want =
it to be visible to their internal network :(

I realise that these requirements are prettey hefty, and so have planned =
to supply my OWN box.  I would actually rather this,=20
so I can experiment (with the coding that is ... not your network!)!

So I was wondering if anyone could help me with this?  I can GARUNTEE:
- NO illegal / corporate materiel will be served / stored on the box AT =
ANY TIME
- There will be NO high bandwidth usage, bandwidth will consist of
    - web pages
    - telnet
    ONLY
- There will be NO attempts made to compromise the hosts security

In other words, we wont bite the hand that feeds!  Whatsmore, is there =
wont be a LOT of students using the system so you dont have to worry =
about a 20k page being accessed 20,000 times in a day! (in fact there =
will only be 10 users).

So can anyone help?  If you want money ... I might be able to scrabble =
something together, but Im prettey much aksing for free...foolish?  ill =
settle for optimistic at this point...

Thankyou for your time,
Andrew Halliday

PS The system may not even be developed on time, and may not be able to =
go live at all! But I have to plan ahead!
