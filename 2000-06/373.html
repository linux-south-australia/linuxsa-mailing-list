&gt; The MySQL web page lists some performance figures for itself, postgresql and
&gt; several other databases.  

Mysql works really well for a lot of people. Until recently Postgresql had
some slow/bugginess type problems. These two facts seem to have combined
into an argument among database users and experts which doesn't much help
people just trying to get a good database that fits their needs. It is
very much a question of what your needs and cost/benefit sensitivities
are.

It is also true that Mysql isn't free software, but that doesn't present a
practical problem to many people. If you are a typical database user (ie
you don't intend to enter the market for database products) then it
probably won't be a concern for you. Therefore you can concentrate on
the technical merits of each.

There is a lot of controversy about some of the figures on the mysql site
relating to features. I don't know about the performance figures, but go
carefully.

&gt; The executive summary?  All depends on what sort of
&gt; operations you're doing frequently.  

Here's a high-level view: RDBMS are slow. Mysql is not an RDBMS.

Why might you want an RDBMS? Read about the theory of transaction handling
and other stuff at
<A HREF="http://www.arsdigita.com/books/panda/databases-choosing.html.">http://www.arsdigita.com/books/panda/databases-choosing.html.</A> (to
illustrate that you need a sense of humour to read this: "Training an
African Grey parrot to function as an information systems manager can be
very rewarding"). The same author has written quite a bit on Postgresql
elsewhere, but I can't find it just quickly.

Read a fists-and-all argument with some rational contributions at
<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/askslashdot/99/08/10/0416205.shtml.">http://slashdot.org/askslashdot/99/08/10/0416205.shtml.</A> Slashdot itself
uses Mysql, and I've noticed that as they have been growing they've been
asking the mysql team for RDBMS features.

There are people who use an RDBMS when there is no need, and others who
don't use one when they really should have one - and even if they get by
for years without noticing any problems, that doesn't mean they shouldn't
be using them.
