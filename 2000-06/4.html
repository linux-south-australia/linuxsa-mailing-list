&gt; Need some opinions, folks!
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to the efforts of a few people (particularly David Newall), a
&gt; surprising number of things are falling into place based around a potential
&gt; early July InstallFest. This is earlier than we originally wanted, but it
&gt; does solve a few of the harder issues (money, venue, etc...) It leaves us
&gt; with much less time (4-6 weeks) to organise and publicise the event, but
&gt; (assuming all goes to plan) gives us an excellent venue, and some
&gt; _potential_ guests from AUUG -- see David's email from a few days back. Do
&gt; people have any comments on how realistic they perceive this timeframe to
&gt; be? Would we really gain a lot by pushing it out to August or even
&gt; September? Particularly if it means we end up with a lower quality venue
&gt; that we have to pay for ourselves... Would we be able to get sufficient
&gt; publicity in less than one month? I have a feeling we could, but am looking
&gt; for opinions...

Opinions?  I have plenty of those!  

A couple of points (probably already raised) - will having cool speakers attract
newbies?  If not then we need to see this as a bonus, not a prerequisite for the
installfest.  I think having the speakers would be for us "code-hardened
hackers", not the newbies.  [Doesn't mean I wouldn't like to have them though
:-)

Can be a) get enough publicity in 4 weeks, b) get enough installers/configurers
in 4 weeks, c) get a cool T-Shirt design & printed, d) get sponsors to sponsor,
e) attrach merchandisers to come along on the day, f) organise everything else
in that time frame?

If the answer to any of these 6 questions is "No" then the added bonus of cool
speakers for us (not the newbies) doesn't outweigh the fact that we'll have an
under-prepared installfest.  IMHO.

I don't want to take away from what David Newall is teeing up - well done - keep
doing it David - I just have a few concerns.  I could just be too negative.

Other opinions sought!

&gt; 
&gt; PS TShirt designs are urgent!
&gt; 

Sigh.  Ok, tonight I'll fire up GIMP :-)
