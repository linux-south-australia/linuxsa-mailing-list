&gt; &gt; I have an idea, use MySQL until it does do what you want. After that

&gt; 
&gt; You mean, use it for financial transactions until you notice that the
&gt; numbers don't add up? BankSA used to think like this :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Might be an idea to divide applications into categories, like this:
&gt; 
&gt;   Only Ever Use a RDBMS (ie never use MySQL)
&gt; 
&gt;      - Anything that has write access and is regarded as important,
&gt;        eg financial, personnel, anything with legal implications
&gt; 
&gt;      - Any data whose importance may increase over time
&gt; 
&gt;    Don't Bother Using an RDBMS (ie MySQL is an obvious winner)
&gt; 
&gt;       - Read-only queries (such as are behind many web sites)
&gt; 
&gt;       - Data that doesn't matter. A lot of the time the writes
&gt;         will be fine, and when it occasionally gets the answers
&gt;         radically wrong it doesn't matter. For example guide-only
&gt;         type data that times out after 24 hours, perhaps.


Can I add this in Mysql defense:

1) From the Mysql manual:
The ISAM table handler -- Stable 
     This manages storage and retrieval of all data. In all MySQL
releases there hasn't been a single (reported) bug in this code. The
only known way to get a corrupted table is to kill the server in the
middle of an update. Even that is unlikely to destroy any data beyond
rescue, because all data are flushed to disk between each query. There
hasn't been a single bug report about lost data because of bugs in
MySQL, either. 

2) The Mysql applications we write for the internet(including write
access to important data) run slow. To the extent that is nearly
unacceptable, not because of Mysql but because of the internet being
slow. If we were to use Postgres wich is over 10 times slower, some of
our applications simply would not be acceptable or be used. They would
stay with their traditional LAN administration.

3) Over the past 4 years we have used Mysql for many clients. Some that
use the SQL engine very heavily(read and write). After all that we have
had only one msyql crash in 4 years. Nothing an isamchk didn't fix(10
minutes work). And no data loss during this crash. All clients are
happy with there applications running on Mysql, that speaks for itself.

I guess that still doesnt eliminate the possibility for data loss.
