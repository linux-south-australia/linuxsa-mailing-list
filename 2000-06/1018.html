&gt; I would actually politely request the ATO rectify the situation and make
&gt; sure you do that in paper format. Whatever you do, don't use e-mail
&gt; because it's unlikely to be viewed as evidence in a court. Tell the ATO
&gt; that you expect them to respond to the letter within 14 days and to take
&gt; some type of action re: the actual software within 31 days.

I've just phone the ATO (Tel: 13 24 78 options 5 -3 for PAYG), and they told
me that the way to get info is to send a query to
Fax: 1-300 139 031 with the following at the top of the fax:

REPLY IN 5

followed by the query.
And then the answer comes back in 5 days.
Alternatively send to
<A HREF="mailto:replyin5@ato.gov.au">replyin5@ato.gov.au</A>

This I intend to do.
And if everyone does this, we may make progress.


My proposal is this:
Plan A should be to get them to give us the entire source,
and we port it to linux.

Probably some company wrote it for the ATO and has IP over it.
So maybe plan A won't work.
Then plan B might be that we just request the ATO to get the
software contractor to port it to linux.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I also was very peeved when I was this disk in the mail
with only MS Wind 95/98/NT4 or
Power Mac C650 options.
But I get used to this.
Every week I seem to get a bit of software on disk, and I just
put it with all the other useless MS disks.
