&gt; &gt; also, you might like to look at the scripts that bring the interfaces up
&gt; &gt; and down. that is, the scripts is /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
&gt; 
&gt; The point is, your ipchains should be installed _before_ your ppp interface
&gt; comes up.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; so for the example where you only have 1 ppp interface, using ppp+ in
&gt; &gt; ipchains will work ok, but if the box has many modems, some which are
&gt; &gt; dial in some which are dial out, then you will run into problems.
&gt; 
&gt; How so?  Generally, the ppp interfaces are communicating with the
&gt; "unsecured" Internet, so firewall rules should remain applicable
&gt; and constant for those interfaces.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; one of the thing I found was that if you run "ifup ppp0" but for example
&gt; &gt; a dial-in line had already been established, it (the dialin) will grab
&gt; &gt; ppp0, and your dialout will grab (most likely) ppp1.
&gt; 
&gt; A dialin line will most likely have a statically assigned IP address
&gt; (or at least an IP range that you control), in which case you would
&gt; rules that specifically addressed this, and not need to use the
&gt; generic ppp+ interface.

My mistake, I forgot to mention that I was trying to IP accounting as
well.
