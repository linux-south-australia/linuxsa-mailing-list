&gt; hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; Last night presentation got me thinking...
&gt; Lets say your current RAID 5 has the following setup.....
&gt; 
&gt; Bank 0:  Drive 1     p234    (9.1 GB)
&gt;          Drive 2     1p34    (9.1 GB)
&gt;          Empty slot
&gt;          Empty slot
&gt; Bank 1:  Drive 3     12p4    (9.1 GB)
&gt;          Drive 4     123p    (9.1 GB)
&gt;          Empty slot
&gt;          Empty slot
&gt; 
&gt; 1) how easy it is to upgrade ??

The usual technique is to upgrade all four disks simultaneously.

This can be done without interuption if you have four empty slots:

Start with:
  raid5(bank0slot1, b0s2, b1s1, b1s2)

Format the new disks:
  raid5(b0s3, b0s4, b1s3, b1s4)

Now mirror the old disks to the new disks:
  raid1(raid5(b0s1, b0s2, b1s1, b1s2), raid5(b0s3, b0s4, b1s3, b1s4))

And finally break the mirror to take the old disks off-line:
  raid5(b0s3, b0s4, b1s3, b1s4)

Where this breaks down under Linux at the moment is that we then need to
increase the size of the newer RAID volume, but we don't have an LVM
in a production kernel yet.

So you'll need to do a tar copy.  Ouch.

&gt; 2) do you have to use drives of the same geometry ?? for example, 9.1 GB all
&gt; the way; or can I get a new 18GB and slot it in ??

If you use a 18G, then if the other disks are 9GB you will only
be able to use the first 9G of the 18G disk in a RAID5 configuration.

If the drives don't have the same specification then performance
will be, at least, less consistent and, at worst, much slower.

&gt; 3) after the drives are installed, how long does it take to synchronise the
&gt; new drives -- data copied to new drives + parity, .....etc

The mirroring takes the same amount of time as a sequential
copy as long as you don't congest the SCSI channel.

Four drives will slightly congest Ultra SCSI2, but it obviously
won't take too much longer than a full backup to tape.  The
new drives will be faster, so the time should be dominated
by the time to read the data from the older drive.
