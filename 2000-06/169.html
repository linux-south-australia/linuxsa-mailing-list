Hi all

I suppose we promised to make some sort of comment on this today... :)

As Mark said, David and I visited Internode today, and looked around, and we
thought it was good. Some comments and a conclusion follow... Please
contribute to discussion on the <A HREF="mailto:installfest@linuxsa.org.au">installfest@linuxsa.org.au</A> list...

Venue itself -- nice, large, well-lit... used to be an art gallery, so
doesn't look too much like a warehouse... it's got concrete floors, but
white painted walls. Lighting is good. Fairly large, has a small office and
a partitioned area...

Accessibility -- door and lift from street level (it's on the second floor)
via the lane behind Cafe Buongiorno.

Parking -- Loading zones exist there, but we will be making enquiries as to
the usage of an undercover carparking area for either dropoff or parking...
This area happens to be owned by a particular Adelaide City Council member,
and we may convince him to open it up for us on the day... A minor drawback
to the venue is it's lack of visibility -- people may be less inclined to
drop computers off in a laneway as opposed to a school carpark or
something... not to mention actually finding it, which is easily dealt with
using a good map, but it is one more reason for someone to decide not to
come... :) We may also convince the ACC to give us free U-Park parking

Heating -- hire turbo heaters

Tables and chairs -- hire trestles and chairs

Power -- at least four double outlets in room, more in adjacent room... need
plentiful extension cords and power boards

Phones -- we may be able to get one or two PABX phone lines, but Internode
may be upset about potential costs of calls. I suggest we keep our usage to
a minimum by employing Mark Newton's idea of getting a script (or at least
settings) from every ISP we know of.

Internet -- Internode have said they'll give us serious connectivity, but I
think we will need to provide our own switches/hubs and cables. We should be
able to scrounge these without too much difficulty... Internode will also
provide us with local mirrors of things (I think), but we should also be
able to organise our own if needed...

Conclusion -- We'll probably use this venue on 15th July. If something else
good comes up between now and the end of the week, we'll change, but for
now, we can be pretty confident of that venue and date (over 50%...)

Any comments?

Subject: InstallFest venue offer - pictures


&gt; There has been some discussion of the InstallFest venue offer made
&gt; by Internode and Agile recently.  Yesterday I noted that lots of the
&gt; criticisms it had attracted from some people were being made in the
&gt; complete absence of anyone having actually seen it.
&gt;
&gt; To address this, Richard Russell and David Newall visited this afternoon
&gt; and I gave them a bit of a look-see.  I'm sure they'll be commenting on
&gt; their impressions in due course;  I wont' preempt them here.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, for the benefit of those who weren't there, I've put a series
&gt; of pictures up at <A HREF="http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/31york">http://slash.dotat.org/~newton/31york</A>
&gt;
&gt; Apologies for the lighting;  it was a dull day and it didn't occur
&gt; to me to turn on the floodlights, ok? :-)

&gt;      but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
