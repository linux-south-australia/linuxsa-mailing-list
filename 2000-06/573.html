Thanks for your reply Benjamin and others. I found the backport and it 
is working well.

There is an error in the code for mousedev.o lines 143 and 316 refer to 
kill_fasync(list-&gt;fasync, SIGIO):

This line should read kill_fasync(list-&gt;fasync, SIGIO,POLL_in);

I thought I did fairly well finding that one by refering to the 2.4 
Kernel code for mousedev.o (not bad for a non programmer).

If anyone wants further info I'd only be pleased for them to contact me.

&gt; &gt; Is there a patch available for the 2.2.14 Kernel that will support usb 
&gt; &gt; mouses?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm currently using Kernel 2.4 but may need to drop back again because 
&gt; &gt; of a program that only runs on 2.2 Kernel versions and it requires a 
&gt; &gt; kernel patch to do this therefore it wont patch Kernel 2.4 properly.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For all you usb needs have a look at: <A HREF="http://www.linux-usb.org">http://www.linux-usb.org</A> 
&gt; You should find a link which has a backport of the usb code from the 2.3/4
&gt; series to 2.2. You will need to patch the kernel with this and recompile
&gt; it.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you enable usb in your kernel you'll also have to tell X about the
&gt; extra buttons on your mouse. Ie in /etc/X11/XF86Config you'll need to make
&gt; (for an Optical Intellimouse - not the explorer) read something like
&gt; this:
&gt; 
&gt; Section "Pointer"
&gt;    Protocol        "IMPS/2"
&gt;    Device          "/dev/usb/mouse0"
&gt;    Buttons         5
&gt;    ZAxisMapping    4 5
&gt; EndSection
&gt; 
&gt; Notce the Z Axismapping line. This is for the wheel. For the Explorer, set
&gt; the amount of buttons to 7 and you should be able to use the two extra
&gt; buttons on the side if a program supports them.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you have this running you need a program which supports the extra
&gt; buttons. Star Office is a good one to test with as it supports the wheel
&gt; natively where as poor old netscape doesn't (I use mozilla which does). 
&gt; 
&gt; If you want netscape to work with the wheel or any other program have a
&gt; look at the program called imwheel. It simulates keyboard events using
&gt; the
&gt; wheel. Ie roll wheel down and it's the same as you pressing the down arrow
&gt; 5 times.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, have a shot and drop me a line if you need help. Linux works just
&gt; as well as Windows with the wheel, if you set it up correctly!
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
