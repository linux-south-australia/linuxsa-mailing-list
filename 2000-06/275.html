And of course as with all good specifications, security is of prime concern.
So much so, that there is a 'Security Considerations' section of the document.

The spec itself at 

  <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/soapspec.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/soapspec.asp</A>

Has this little gem

  8. Security Considerations

  Not described in this document are methods for integrity and 
  privacy protection. Such issues will be addressed more fully in a 
  future version(s) of this document.

We will wait for MS (or should that be 'M' or 'S' :) to widely deploy
the technology, cost the users of their software millions (if not billions)
when the first major exploit comes out that exposes everybodies corporate data
before recommending against using this technology due to security concenrs.

I can almost see MS deploying this as a remote access method for IIS or 
other Internet servers, and then issuing an advisory suggesting that users
disable web access until a fix can be produced.

I did like how the author of the first article made comment of 'if you can't
convince you administrator to open up more ports' then just ignore the 
concerns and effectively tunnel 'Object References' over the 'HyperText
Transfer Protocol'.  

Yours in a healthy mix of Cynicism and Paranoia,
