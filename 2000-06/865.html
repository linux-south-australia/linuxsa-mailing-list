&gt; One thing that annoys me with mail clients is that generally, they have
&gt; folders which you put messages into. A message can exist in only one folder,
&gt; unless it is copied to other folders. You can set up rules to do things for
&gt; you, like move and copy messages, etc. So suppose I have a message from a
&gt; friend, that came on a mailing list, I would like to have that message in
&gt; both the folder of messages from that friend, and in the folder from that
&gt; mailing list. But if I delete or reply to this message, I would like both
&gt; messages to have that marked.
&gt; 
&gt; What I really want is a mail client that lets me keep all my mail in one
&gt; "folder", but will give me many logical "views" of it -- views that can be
&gt; set up in a permanent way, like rules or filters, and that work faster than
&gt; searches... I'd like to be able to ask my mail client for all messages from
&gt; X, or all messages on the Y mailing list, or all messages on the Z thread,
&gt; and have it show me instantly. All the processing for this should be done in
&gt; advance, so there is little lag. I know that this sounds remarkably like
&gt; using a database for mail, and maybe that's what I wnat... Although it would
&gt; be best if the mail could be kept in as standard a format as possible, or at
&gt; least be easily (almost trivially) exported and imported.

Are you writing an ad for "Evolution", the new Helix-code GNOME email client (ie
think Outlook) or what? :-)

This is exactly what Evolution does.  It has "VFolders" - virtual folders into a
database that can even be distributed over different disks/computers/across the
internet.  IMAP based.  Multiple file formats supported, including mbox and XML
I think.  Miguel from Helix says that it has to work for large volume email
since he personally receives thousands of emails weekly (and he's not even
subscribed to our installfest mailing list :-)

The only problem is that it's only at release 0.2 (last time I checked).  Beta
front-end, but rock solid guts, or at least that's what the GNOME hackers are
saying.  I haven't tried it yet.  Waiting for a new big disk purchase next week
post-GST :-)
