An interesting post re GPL loophole -- don't know if it's actually for real
or if it's something serious... but it would seem that you could take GPL
code, modify it, and release it indefinitely as an "intermediate release",
and never actually get around to releasing source code.

Subject: GPL violation is a Linux Community standard


There seems to be alot of gashing of teeth over ABIT's Gentus distribution.

I'm not sure I understand what the big deal is.  I have contacted a couple 
fairly open source savvy/Linux friendly companies about how they have 
disregard key criteria for redistribution and both have replied back to me 
about an unwritten loop-hole where a GPL or LGPL violation can continue to 
be distributed for an unspecified amount of time by being reclassified as 
being an intermediate package.

Actual cases:

- Tripwire Security

This company makes an intrusion detection application.  Originally available

in source code form under a restrictive license, the product has been taken 
commerical.  The company has announce alliances with Red Hat and Caldera 
Systems in additions to claim that they will re-open source their product to

the Linux community ( as stated on 
<A HREF="http://www.tripwire.com/press/pr.cfml?prid">http://www.tripwire.com/press/pr.cfml?prid</A>=36& ).  Tripwire Security's 
partnerships and actions seem to indicate a company that has a strong desire

to be Linux friendly.  However, the demo of their product for Linux ( 
available from <A HREF="http://www.tripwire.com/downloads/">http://www.tripwire.com/downloads/</A> ) has also been a perfect 
demostration of a LGPL violation.  Previously, there was a number of LGPL 
requirements which where ignored even when notified in writting of them.  
RMS has since contacted them.  However, they continue to not provide the 
object files to the demo binaries to allow for relinking against modified 
copies of the LGPL library.  When questioned on this, their responce was 
that this package is in an intermediate phase and they will be compliant 
when their application is available under GPL.  They could not give any 
indication on how long this intermediate phase while continuing 
redistribution without meeting all LGPL requirement will continue.  However,

the waving of LGPL requirements using "intermediate phase" designation has 
already been in effect since January.

- Corel Corp.

At the beginning of this year, Corel Corp. went on road tour with their 
Corel LinuxOS distribution.  During the tour they explain the donations of 
source code and resources they have made to the Linux community.  The point 
was driven home that Corel Corp. wishes to be thought of as an open source 
aware and Linux friendly company.  As part of this road tour, Corel handed 
out demostration Corel LinuxOS Open Distribution CD-ROMs.  Unlike the box 
set, these CDs and nothing supplied with them provided a written offer for 
the GPL packages they just provided in binary only format.  When questioned 
on this, it was stated that they would take steps to correct it.  During a 
trade show some two months later, they could still not provide information 
on where a written offer for source code was being provide while they 
continued to redistribute the same Corel LinuxOS Open Distribution CD-ROM.  
Again, when their legal dept. was questioned on this, it was explained that 
the Corel LinuxOS Open Distribution CD-ROM is in a intermediate phase and 
updated versions are being passed through their quality-assurance dept.  
They refused to comment as to why a sticker couldn't be added to the present

CD-ROM covers which provides the written statement other than to restate 
that the demo is in an intermediate phase.  Similar to Tripwire Security, 
Corel Corp. could not provide any details as to how long this intermediate 
phase will continue.  Also, their demostration of violating the GPL has 
continued since Janurary.


Closing statment:

Present U.S. Federal Copyright laws and the legal skills withen the Free 
Software community is not approbate for accomplishing the goals of Copyleft 
via the GPL or LGPL.  Even in cases where RMS is aware of a LGPL violation 
is taking place, he and the Free Software Foundation can not keep a company 
from picking and choosing what redistribution requirements they choose to 
wave for an unspecified time period which may exceed 6 months.  In the case 
of Abit, if they choose to use other Linux friendly companies as a model 
then they should be able to wave GPL and LGPL requirements by re-using the 
unwritten "intermediate phase" rule.  If they release a new version ever 6 
months where they new version is in an intermediate phase then they should 
be able to wave the requirements indefinately using practices which are 
accepted commonly by Linux friendly companies.

Unless your willing to build the legal backing to demand the discontinued 
redistribution of GPL and LGPL works when that redistribution does not meet 
the license requirement then it seems silly to nit-pick at one company.  
Abit is picking and choosing what requirements to follow much like several 
other "Linux friendly" companies.  This seems perfectly acceptable to me 
when you become aware that the GPL and LGPL are commonly treated as a set of

*requests* and not a set of *requirements*.  Let just accept that companies 
like Corel Corp are going to pick and choose what requests to follow.  I 
would like to just get back to discussing kernel *development* issues and 
leave the silly formalities of the theoretical "legal" licensing issues for 
another mailing list.

Thanks.
