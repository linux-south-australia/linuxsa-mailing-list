There is a great opportunity for someone to step up to the plate and design a
poster for the up-coming installfest and be admired by thousands for helping us
out at the last minute.

Our last installfest poster designer has unfortunately had to withdraw his offer
since he's got the chance to go to AUUG suddenly due to someone else's illness.

We need someone to design an installfest poster TODAY!  Just think of the fame
and fortune!  Your poster will be displayed all over Adelaide, and LinuxSA will
no doubt worship you as a uber-geek and demi-god forever for helping us out at
the last hour!  ESR and RMS will email you requesting you to help them sort out
their differences.  Linus will invite you over for BBQs.  Alan Cox will shave
off his beard and send it to you!

We're looking for an A4 poster, portrait, with say a two-colour Tux (off the
web), the Installfest2000 title, the URL and date for the event, and some of the
words from the ascii text advert for the event
(<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/installfest/installfest_advert.txt">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/installfest/installfest_advert.txt</A>).  If you can
design in the GIMP all the better.  Feel free to steal designs from either the
installfest webpage or the T-Shirt designs submitted.

Please send email to <A HREF="mailto:installfest@linuxsa.org.au">installfest@linuxsa.org.au</A> to accept the challenge and
become famous - who knows, this new fame might end up landing you a job with a
big rich Linux company :-)

Don't think someone else has taken the opportunity ahead of you - until I email
linuxsa saying the position has been taken, it hasn't!

Thanks in advance,

Michael...
