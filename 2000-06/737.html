Ok, talking to people on Tuesday night at LinuxSA raised some
interesting topics regarding the installfest.  We (ie all of us in
LinuxSA) need to consider the following things if the installfest is
going to be a great event (hence why this is going to LinuxSA, not just
installfest):

o The Austereo network (TripleM, SAFM) have some computer show, which
will quite willingly give us some airtime.  Perhaps other radio networks
as well.

o TV networks to cover us.  Both the commercials and Aunty are likely
candidates, especially Auntie who are very likely to send a crew. 
News/Current Affairs.

o T-Shirts.  We need these out there.  Period.  When can we expect
T-Shirts?

o Posters.  Richard had a good offer from a printer.  Is this going to
work out?  If so, when will posters be available?

o Universities.  Uni Staff & Students may be our biggest group
attending.  Who has contacts at UniSA?  How about Adelaide?  Flinders? 
I know there are people who have these contacts and know the mailing
lists to post to here on the list.  Can you please come forward and say,
"Yup, I'll handle emailing people at XXX Department at YYY University" ?

o Newspapers.  I'm sure the Messenger would cover us.  Perhaps The
Advertiser and even The Australian (Tuesday, Computing etc).  This is
news, we just need someone to sell it to them!

o Is anyone coordinating the mini-tutorials for the day?  Who's willing
to give a ten minute talk on kernel recompilation?  About X windows? 
About MP3s?  About RPM?  About GNU/Free software etc?  Who's going to
coordinate these talks?

o What else can we do to promote this event?  We need ideas people! 
I've been emailing people all over, but I don't know if you have been as
well.  If are doing this, let us know so we don't double up.  If not,
can you please start emailing people you know who might be interested in
Linux?  We gotta promote this :-)

We really need people to take on board a few of these things if they
can.  You need NOT take on everything - let Richard and David be the
only ones burned out :-)  Many hands make light work.  So volunteer just
for one thing and help make this event a great success!
