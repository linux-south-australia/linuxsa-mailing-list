This is from the Mysql Reference Manual 7.23 LOCK TABLES/UNLOCK TABLES
syntax(in part):

Normally, you don't have to lock tables, as all single UPDATE
statements are atomic; no other thread can interfere with any
other currently executing SQL statement. There are a few cases when you
would like to lock tables anyway: 

     If you are going to run many operations on a bunch of tables, it's
much faster to lock the tables you are going to use.
     The downside is, of course, that no other thread can update a
READ-locked table and no other thread can read a
     WRITE-locked table. 
     MySQL doesn't support a transaction environment, so you must use
LOCK TABLES if you want to ensure that no
     other thread comes between a SELECT and an UPDATE. The example
shown below requires LOCK TABLES in
     order to execute safely: 

     mysql&gt; LOCK TABLES trans READ, customer WRITE;
     mysql&gt; select sum(value) from trans where customer_id= some_id;
     mysql&gt; update customer set total_value=sum_from_previous_statement
                where customer_id=some_id;
     mysql&gt; UNLOCK TABLES;

     Without LOCK TABLES, there is a chance that another thread might
insert a new row in the trans table between
     execution of the SELECT and UPDATE statements. 

By using incremental updates (UPDATE customer SET
value=value+new_value) or the
LAST_INSERT_ID() function, you can avoid using LOCK TABLES in many
cases. 

You can also solve some cases by using the user-level lock functions
GET_LOCK() and RELEASE_LOCK(). These locks
are saved in a hash table in the server and implemented with
pthread_mutex_lock() and
pthread_mutex_unlock() for high speed. See section 7.3.12 Miscellaneous
functions. 

See section 10.10 How MySQL locks tables, for more information on
locking policy.

&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; Don't know about Postgresql. But with Mysql, one reason for its good
&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; speed/reliability is the fact that it was ALL written form scratch.
&gt;  &gt; &gt; Hey, wow!  That's the same argument MS uses when they explain why NT is
&gt;  &gt; &gt; better than UNIX!
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I have nothing to do with sales and yet I have the natural talent of
&gt;  &gt; using the same arguments MS use, who spend millions um... billions on
&gt;  &gt; sales. What a complement. Thanks Mark.
&gt;  &gt; Or is it a criticism?
&gt; 
&gt; "Yes".  :-)
&gt; 
&gt; For what it's worth, the speed gains of mysql (which have been shrinking
&gt; as PostgreSQL improves) are due more to the fact that it doesn't support
&gt; features which most people think are actually mandatory features of a
&gt; database, most notably including its lack of support for transactions.
&gt; Transactions are "hard" to implement, and necessarily involve a performance
&gt; loss, but the mysql developers have consciously chosen to not support them,
&gt; so they don't pay the speed penalties that real databases like PostgreSQL
&gt; must pay.
&gt; 
&gt; One thing to be very careful of when using a database for a web site
&gt; backend is that web pages are, by the nature, accessed in parallel;  so,
&gt; if you have any multiple-write updates to do in the course of running
&gt; the site, you're left with three alternatives:
&gt; 
&gt;        1. mysql, and just put up with random data corruption from
&gt;           transactions which are smashed by multiple simultaneous
&gt;           updaters;
&gt; 
&gt;        2. mysql with wrappers around SQL operations to do shared and
&gt;           exclusive locking, eg:
&gt; 
&gt;                 $lck = establish_shared_lock();
&gt;                 $dbt = $dbi-&gt;prepare("select ...");
&gt;                 $dbt-&gt;execute();
&gt;                 # handle results;
&gt;                 $dbt-&gt;finish();
&gt;                 release_shared_lock($lck);
&gt;           and:
&gt; 
&gt;                 $lck = establish_exclusive_lock();
&gt;                 $dbt = $dbi-&gt;prepare("update ...");
&gt;                 $dbt-&gt;execute();
&gt;                 # handle results
&gt;                 $dbt-&gt;finish();
&gt;                 release_exclusive_lock($lck);
&gt; 
&gt;       3. Use a real database which supports transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 1 is frankly unacceptable.  Even if you say, "But it really
&gt; doesn't matter, it's only a web site..." sooner or later a lack of
&gt; explicit transaction handling will bite you in the arse.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 2 is also unacceptable in all but the simplest of cases:  In
&gt; many cases doing your own locking will involve a greater performance
&gt; loss than using a real database, and if you get the locking wrong you
&gt; either leave some transactions unprotected (see option 1) or cause
&gt; deadlocks.
&gt; 
&gt; Option 3 is simple:  You get concurrency issues solved "for free", the
&gt; code doesn't cost any more, and in all likelihood your performance loss
&gt; is less than what you'd end up with if you handled your own locking.
&gt; 
&gt; As it happens, the rider above that option two can be acceptable in
&gt; the simplest of cases is often true for web site backends, which often
&gt; don't stress databases all that much.  However, if you ever find that a
&gt; single form submission from a user results in more than one discrete
&gt; SQL operation being processed by the backend, you run the risk of presenting
&gt; the user with worthless and wrong information at best, and corrupting
&gt; the structure of your database at worst.
&gt; 
&gt; [ and yes, carlo, you probably know this stuff already; many other readers
&gt;   probably don't, though. ]
