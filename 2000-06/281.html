 &gt; Now, I have a few questions:
 &gt; 1. Out of the BSD and Sys V Unices, which one is chronologically older?
 
They're about the same... kinda.  

The original UNIX was from AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey (1969).  They
didn't give it a version number back then, instead it had names like 
"1st edition", "2nd edition," etc, which loosely corrsponded to 
"whatever version the second edition of the manual most accurately 
describes," etc.  Needless to say, it was a work in progress.

Berkeley received their copy of 6th Edition UNIX in the early 70s.
Shortly afterwards, UNIX 32V was released by AT&T, and that version is
usually regarded as the parent of the "SysV" family.

1BSD was distributed at a point quite close to the release of 32V. 
It was basically 6th Edition on steroids with software development
tools and kernel fixes thrown in, and was only distributed to a 
very small number of AT&T UNIX licensees.

As time went by, 32V (aka SysV) and BSD continued to develop.  For a
long time sites who want to run UNIX would get an AT&T license, then
throw away the AT&T tape and install BSD.  BSD was considered a derivative
work of 6th edition up until 4.4BSD-Lite was released in the early 90's,
and it therefore required an AT&T license.

[ notwithstanding that, 386BSD and BSDI were based on 4.3BSD with the
  remaining AT&T bits, which were restricted to five kernel source .c
  files, removed.  AT&T USG, then Novell USL challenged its distribution
  in an early-90's lawsuit;  The settlement of that suit included the 
  mutual agreement that 4.4BSD-Lite was officially "clean" of AT&T bits.
  Note that Berkeley countersued, successfully claiming that TCP/IP, virtual
  memory, NFS code and the "vi" text editor was being distributed with 
  AT&T UNIX without attribution, in violation of the BSD License ]

 &gt; 2. Are they SO different you are forced to learn one rather than the
 &gt; other...or are they so similar that there really isn't much of a
 &gt; difference to the END user (not the person who is doing the
 &gt; programming)?

There is hardly any difference to the end user;  there's also hardly any
difference to the programmer, especially starting from SysVR4, where
the SysV folks put large chunks of BSD source-level compatibility into
their libraries.  The APIs are very, very similar.

System Administration is where most of the differences are;  there are 
many differences between the daemons you'd run on the two flavours, and
the way you configure them (SysV tends to use commands with veritable
alphabets of command-line options to configure things like printing and
file-sharing ('lpadmin', DFS's 'share' command), whereas BSD uses simple
config files (/etc/printcap, /etc/exports).

 &gt; 3. If there is a difference, is there a consensus as to which one is
 &gt; better as measured by:
 &gt;   i) stability
 &gt;   ii) efficiency
 &gt;   iii) security
 &gt;   iv) ease of administration

My personal opinion is that BSD-based systems are much easier to 
administer (which also seems to have been the conclusion of lots of other
people -- When Sun went from BSD-based SunOS 4.x to SysV-based SunOS 5.x,
many Sun shops refused to upgrade for years and years, even though none
of the newer hardware supports SunOS 5.x).

Stability-wise they're about the same.  Security-wise they're about the
same.  

As for efficiency:  BSD's peer reviewing by an open community of professional
researchers seems to have delivered some wins.  For example, its TCP/IP
code is so much more efficient than SysV's TCP/IP code that some SysV
vendors actually use BSD TCP/IP in their kernels (e.g.: SGI's IRIX, Sun's
Solaris).

 &gt; 4. There must be a relationship or some type of link between the BSD
 &gt; Style Unices, System V Style Unices and POSIX. What is this
 &gt; relationship?

POSIX is a series of standards laid down by a series of committees.  BSD
and SysV both strive to comply with those standards.

 &gt; 5. Is Linux compliant with any of the above standards?

Yes, one particular distribution of Linux (I can't remember which one)
was evaluated to be compliant with a subset of the POSIX standards.
Note that the evaluation costs money, and needs to be re-tested with
each new distribution and each new version, so most organizations don't
bother.

 &gt; 6. If one could administer a Linux System, such as one based on RedHat
 &gt; 6.2, by command-line, could one with only minimal learning but no
 &gt; experience, administer an enterprise Sun Solarise or HP-UX or IBM AIX
 &gt; machine?

More or less.  Hmm - Actually, IBM AIX is a bit different;  The vast 
bulk of its system administration is done by a menu-driven tool called
"SMIT".  Although many of the "traditional" config files exist, lots of
them are placeholders which don't actually do anything, so editing them
is pointless, and you don't know which ones are useful and which ones
aren't unless you're very familiar with SMIT.

Apart from that, though, most versions of UNIX are 95% the same.  The
difference between a guru and a hanger-on is knowing which bits of the
system fall into the remaining 5%, and what the various differences are.

 &gt; 7. Out of the following UNICES, which one is which standard? I'm going
 &gt; to try and divide them into the right groups as I think but I'm not
 &gt; certain:
 &gt; 
 &gt;   * SYSTEM V: Sun OS, Sun Solaris and IBM's AIX

No -- The "Official" System-V UNIX is SCO OpenServer 5.4, since SCO
owns the source code base for SysV (after it was sold by AT&T to Novell,
then by Novell to SCO).

Sun is a bit different from the others too:  SysV vendors license the
source code from SCO on an annually-renewable basis (for about $80,000
per annum plus per-copy royalties).  Sun, on the other hand, actually
managed to negotiate an agreement to BUY their license outright from
AT&T in the mid 90's, so they don't run the official SCO SysVR4 source
base anymore, but they also don't have to pay any annual license fees or
royalties.

 &gt;   * BSD: HP-UX, Free/Open/NetBSD and BSD (is there such a beast?)

If I had to pick an official version of BSD, I'd say it was FreeBSD.
I say this because so many of the original CSRG researches are FreeBSD
committers:  Kirk McKusick is still doing active development work on it,
Keith Bostic has his commit bit, Karels is supposed to be getting commit
privileges to help out with SMP work at some point in the not too 
distant future.

 &gt; 8. Of System V and BSD, which one is Linux most similar to or fully
 &gt; compatible with (if that's the case)?

Neither :-)  Linux has picked-and-chosen from the bits it most wants.
This will also vary from distribution-to-distribution, since the kernel
is only a small part of what makes the difference between BSD and SysV.

 &gt; I'm sorry that these questions sound like text book questions. They're
 &gt; NOT. I just want to brush up on some UNIX history and standards and work
 &gt; out which UNIX stands where, or which UNIX like operating stands where
 &gt; and such.

There's a book called "The History of UNIX" which goes into it in great
detail.  I'd love to provide you with authorship and publication details,
but my copy is currently loaned out.  Search amazon and see what you find.
