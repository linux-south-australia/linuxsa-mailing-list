Hi David,

Thanks for replying!
I understand the doco's are out of date, well most of them, but for someone like
myself it's a place where one can start getting some information. Especially when
trying to configure the Linux system to suit needs.
You must be far advanced in using and setting up Linux, as for me without the help of
the doco's and people like yourself, I would be lost! :o)

Best wishes,

Nick.

&gt; &gt; Thanks for replying! And thanks to everyone, even though many people don't seem
&gt; &gt; to find the doco's important, there a great degree of interest to hobby users as
&gt; &gt; myself! And YES, I still have my old CD's :o)
&gt;
&gt; Doco's not important? They're the best way to avoid flame wars. I can
&gt; cope with people who say, for example,
&gt;
&gt; "I have read the PPP HOWTO and I tried doing what it says. And it broke.
&gt; PPPD said [whatever]"
&gt;
&gt; And so forth. They are very important. Even to professional
&gt; administrators.
&gt;
&gt; Take a look from real life. When I do a dinner party and I really want
&gt; to impress, I don't pull recipes from memory. I look them up in my
&gt; recipe book. Same with the docs...
