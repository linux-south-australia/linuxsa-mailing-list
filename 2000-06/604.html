Hi,

Just when you thought it was safe to run an email server...  There seems to
be another Outlook worm going around...  It came through here this morning
and blew our mail spool out to 10 times its normal size.  I've attached a
script which will grep /var/spool/mail for signs of this virus, and move
users mail files out the way (with notifications to my admin account and the
user) if its found.  I'm running it on a cron job every 2 minutes.  Its
pretty basic, but it does seem to work, so I hope it helps someone.

On a different note...  Does anyone know of a quick way to remove individual
messages from the mail file if a grep finds something???

Jim.
