Please can we let this thread, and the whole religion/sexuality debate die
quietly... I would like to apologise for my contribution to this thread, and
hope that it doesn't get out of hand from here on in... please respond
privately to particular persons if you want to continue taking on this
thread -- if it continues on-list, people will get pissed off because of
irrelevant mail and potentially hurtful comments.

Thanks

&gt; &gt; &gt; When will people learn that image is by definition superficial and
&gt; &gt; &gt; irrelevant to the real substance? Whether we are talking 
&gt; religion or
&gt; &gt; &gt; operating systems, it doesn't matter...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I agree that substance is more important than image, but 
&gt; that does not
&gt; &gt;render image unimportant.  Indeed often image is important because it
&gt; &gt;can influence people, thus leading to substance.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Image is a form of communication and transference of ideas.  I can
&gt; &gt;understand the Christian school's stance against the devil 
&gt; mascot.  It
&gt; &gt;conveys the idea that the concept of the devil is a lighthearted idea
&gt; &gt;not to be taken seriously.  Christians take the devil 
&gt; seriously and so
&gt; &gt;do not wish to trivialize him, as the mascot does.
&gt; 
&gt; IMHO, this is the only sensible response to this thread 
&gt; (apart from Robyn's 
&gt; protest).
&gt; 
&gt; Is it really true that this list is willing to respond to the 
&gt; sensitivities 
&gt; of a person engaging in an unusual and unproductive sexual 
&gt; preference, but 
&gt; openly scoffs at Christian principles?
&gt; Shame on you.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this thread, with that attitude, dies quickly.
