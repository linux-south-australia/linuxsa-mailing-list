I would like to send a great big THANKYOU for everyone's help.

Housten does not have a problem any more - Linux is back on line.

Just so everyone knows, I did have a boot disk (as well as the CD but
didn't use it) that was made, but have NEVER EVER used it previously,
let alone, how to use one.

I decided to try Damien's first method, because it seemed the simplest.
I was going to attempt Richard's method but I couldn't remember the hdax
number for the hard drive(even though I do watch the interactive boot, I
forgot &lt;grin&gt;).

Anyway, going by Damien's note, I thought he meant to put /sbin/lilo
when it boots from the floppy. Luckily (as I found out) Lilo is more
intuitive than that, and told me in no uncertain terms, you can't do
that, and to press Tab for my options.

Goofy here hit tab, and up come my choices - Linux and Rescue.
I typed in linux, and up come a reassuring ramble as the kernel loaded.
Logged in as root and then at the prompt typed /sbin/lilo

So, thank you, thank you, thank you. I can now put down Linus's (from
Peanuts) security blanket until next time, just for a little while.

&gt; How the heck can he do that if he's not getting a LILO prompt to do it
&gt; at?
&gt; The loadlin option suggested by Jeremy Irvine is the safest and quickest
&gt; one suggested to date in my opinion.
