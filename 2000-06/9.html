  Dan&gt; Package management is one of the most importan things about an
  Dan&gt; OS, when considering its use in commercial and/or large
  Dan&gt; environments. I have some ideas I've formed through practical
  Dan&gt; experience over where things are, and I'd be interested in
  Dan&gt; other peoples' comments on what I'm forgetting.

  Dan&gt; rpm ---
  Dan&gt; apt ---
  Dan&gt; pkg ---

Encap, version 1.0 and 2.0 packages, essentially a tar.gz 
package.

epkg-1.0.3 is the most recent version of a tool which uses this
package format, which build a symbolicly linked /usr/local

I had discovered, after writing several scipts to look after system
software this way, that epkg almost does exactly the same thing.

The idea (of the 1.0 style packages) is that the application stores
all it's files in it's own directory, in the appropriate
structure..  bin, sbin, lib, etc, man, info.. etc
and then symbolic links are created form the
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin, /usr/local/lib.. etc.

Subdirectories (and sub-subdirectories) of the application are created
in /usr/local (if they don't exist) and contents linked accordingly.

This means that..
- packages can be compiled and tested before 'installation/commisioning'
- packages can be 'removed' by renaming their root directory, leaving
  the links hanging, which can then be easily removed.
  Trees of old versions can be left 'in place', and can be reverted
  back to, should a new version prove inadequate.
- a packages files are all located in the same tree.

[These are very useful things in a production environment]

The --prefix option to ./configure is you friend (for source files)!
for putting software where you want it.

Under Linux, there is still the problem with shared libraries, requiring
a line to be added to /etc/ld.so.conf and running ldconfig.

Encap 2.0 specifies some additional feature, such as installation
logging, dependency checking and the running of 
pre and post processing scripts.
