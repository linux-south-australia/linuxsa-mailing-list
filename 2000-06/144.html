 &gt; &gt; This crashed the *entire* machine a few times, even when X locked up,
 &gt; &gt; [CTRL][ALT] + [BACKSPACE] didn't do squat :-/
 &gt; 
 &gt; Thats very bad. Its the type of thing you'd expect from a windoze box,
 &gt; Not Stable Linux. Is it possible its a hardware problem? Others may be
 &gt; able to help determine if its hardware or not.

Remember that a process can chew up enough CPU time and memory to make the
system seem to stop, or actually stop responding - that's a failing of the
application, not necessarily of the operating system.

Could be that your system has NOT completely locked up, but is running
incredibly slowly, therefore just looks that way.

I don't think I've ever exited Netscape cleanly on my home machine - I am
always having to do a "killall -9 netscape-communicator", because it tends
to just explode.

I'd look at trying to fix it but I don't use Netscape very often :)

Meh.

Nick
