&gt; &gt; Here is one tiny example of something that Mysql just can't do: A
&gt; &gt; user triggers a complicated query that takes one second. 
&gt; &gt; In that period, another user causes one of the queried records to be
&gt; &gt; changed, a process that only take 1/4 second. 
&gt; &gt; The first user's query completes using the affected records as
&gt; &gt; they were when the query was initiated, and the second user's write
&gt; &gt; happens without delay.
&gt; 
&gt; Tell me if Im wrong here? But cant it be done with mysql lock tables.
&gt; The bit that I posted TWICE shows a query trying to access a locked
&gt; table will wait and not time out until the table is unlocked or the
&gt; thread is closed. 

This is the bit of the above that MySQL can't do, no matter what
SQL programming effort you apply:

    "The first user's query completes using the affected records as
     they were when the query was initiated, and the second user's write
     happens without delay."

MySQL can't do this because it doesn't have the concept of remembering
what has happened recently and then blending that into the database (to
gloss over the technicalities somewhat:) In MySQL you have to explicitly
say, in effect:

    - Stop everything! Tables locked
    - Write write write write write
    - Ok! Open for read access again

Whereas a RDBMS says:

    - A wants to write? Ok, I've copied the current status to a working
      area, and now I've locked the affected rows

    - B wants to read? Fine, take this copy (the real one is
      being written to at the moment, terribly sorry about that)

    - A finished writing? Ok, no reads in progress so I'll 
      open up the new-look rows, then delete the copy I made

It is a much more parallel process.

&gt; More programming work than an RDBMS to make sure its all done
&gt; correctly, but an RDBMS working throughout the Globe via internet
&gt; connection??? It may be slow enough to warrant not using it at all and
&gt; staying with traditional methods.

I think you can see from the example I have given that in fact in a busy
database MySQL may well in fact be slower than an RDBMS. If there are 5
queries for every write, and the queries are never blocked waiting for a
locked table, there's a fair chance that overall the whole application
will be faster with an RDBMS.

This is not to say that RDBMS' are faster than MySQL, for a lot of things
they won't be. They are carrying a lot of extra baggage around! But you
might be surprised how little difference it makes even from an
architectural point of view as the size of the problem to be solved gets
larger.

&gt; &gt; How many times a day would this scenario happen on a busy database, say of
&gt; &gt; airline bookings? Many, I'm sure.
&gt; 
&gt; If the majority of your SQL's are transaction type, I would opt for a
&gt; RDBMS. But if performance is critical, (ie internet already slowing
&gt; things down) you may not have a choice. 

But real-world practice doesn't support what you say. I am no Oracle fan
at all, but it is certainly true that Oracle is used in many, many
Internet sites with good-to-excellent performance.
