 &gt; Question 2:
 &gt; Flash rom/ram with IDE interface.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Someone mentioned some time earlier that there's such a
 &gt; thing as a flash ram or rom module with an IDE interface.
 &gt; I just can't remember who told me and in what context.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Does anyone know where you get these flash ram/rom modules
 &gt; which have IDE interfaces in Adelaide?
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is all part of my little linux/atm high-speed shaper
 &gt; module project. Ejecting the disk drive should increase
 &gt; reliability a fair bit.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Cheers,
 &gt; Alan Kennington.
 &gt; 

VME system in Melb. had them last year, don't know anyone that does -
check the SANS disk parent site, I think they might have the
distributors there .



 &gt; 
 &gt; ===================================================
 &gt; PS.
 &gt; Has anyone out there actually done any MP3 file creation
 &gt; under linux? If so, what do you use?
 &gt; I've got a copy of the bladeenc software, which
 &gt; I plan to build some day. But there seems to be a dearth
 &gt; of MP3 software out there. Whenever I follow links in
 &gt; places like freshmeat.net and icewalkers.org etc., they seem
 &gt; to lead to software which has been withheld due to legal
 &gt; considerations.
 &gt; All I want to do is record my own stuff from a 4-track
 &gt; tape deck to MP3 for distribution over the net.
 &gt; (That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.)
 &gt; 
Bladeenc and LAME both work reasonably well.
(I run them on Ultrasparcs and Pentiscum running rh6.2 )

Either one integrates well with gcd and cddb.
