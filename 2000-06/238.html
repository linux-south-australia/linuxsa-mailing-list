&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me their opinion of the Mandrake distribution of linux?
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Works quite well, does an especially good job recognising the latest
&gt;    hardware even in laptops
&gt; 

I can vouch for that


&gt; 2. There isn't a brand-new package or kernel that they don't include :-)
&gt;    Very much a bleeding-edge distro
&gt; 

Not so sure about the bleeding edge metaphor. It looks to me that as
much stuff runs out-of-the-box of a manduck distro as most others,
including RatHead

&gt; 3. They do try very hard to give a good desktop experience
&gt; 
&gt; So don't be too surprised if a few things bite. Mandrake are really brave
&gt; about trying new things and creating new projects to solve problems in an
&gt; open source manner. Be prepared to get their latest RPM for whatever. But
&gt; also be prepared for a development group that is pretty responsive.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I like to know before I attempt to download the ISO-image file on my
&gt; &gt; 56k modem
&gt; 
&gt; It surprises me that there isn't a local service for hot-off-the press ISO
&gt; images. Would there be a market (at, say, $10 a CD) for such a thing? I
&gt; wanted several CD recently and it was a bit of a pain to get them (recent
&gt; versions of FreeBSD, Debian and Mandrake.)


I buy mine from Linux System Labs Australia, around $7 or $8 a CD plus
delivery, thats around $20 delivered in a day or two from order. Check
www.lsl.com.au, tell Glenn Bruce sent you ;-). I keep going back so it
must be OK.
