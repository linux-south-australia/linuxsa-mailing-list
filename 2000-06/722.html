&gt; Next good reason for complicating things is if you are running a
&gt; server.  Then you will probably want a clean separation of system
&gt; files from other files.

...and I guess this is why I offered the advice, because most people
who are using Linux are never going to be limited to the workstation
at home. Linux is a server OS and so a server install is usually just
a matter of time for most people. In these cases I really do believe
that separate partitions are the go.

The problem is that when people get to this point they get burnt
because one of the partitions runs out of room. The reason they run
out of room is simply lack of experience with partitioning decisions.
The reason that I recommend separate partitions on your home machine
is that you get practice. I haven't run out of disk space for years.
Someone at the meeting on Tuesday complained that some partitions fill
up quicker than others, therefore stick to a single partition. Well
the more experienced at building systems you get the less often you
run out of room.

If you have to build a server for someone and they require separate
disks, it will be a lot easier if you've already done it for your home
system a few times.

Are separate partitions easier? Absolutely not.

Are they "the correct way of doing things"? Who cares.

Are they good practice? Yes.

I'll concede that /, /boot and /var are probably all you need (symlink
/tmp to /var/tpm). Maybe with a /home in case you want to switch
distributions.

Cheers

Alex!
