Thankyou to everyone that replied to the following query:

The system time on my PC running RedHat 6.0 appears to lose 30 minutes
overnight. I have checked using hwclock and the RTC and it is
correct UTC. I cannot find any cron jobs or otherwise that appear to be
resetting the time.
I do not have xntp or ntp running so its not being reset by that
either. Any help would be appreciated.

It appears that the problem may be to do with the following from Daryl
Tester:

Another thing that can cause clock drift on a "slowish" machine is some
process can lock out the interrupts for longer than a system tick (ie, spans
two ticks).  From memory, the interrupts for each level aren't queued more
than once, and as each tick occurs every 10 or 100 Hz, that can cause drift
as the IRQ tick routine is called once for x ticks.

I have since discovered that my system is not slowly losing time during the
day. It actually loses the full 30 minutes during the evening when I run a
full backup of the system using dump to DAT tape and a full database export.
I have had lots of problems getting this tape drive to compress the data
correctly (it's a DEC tape drive). My messy solution is to now resynch the
system time with the hardware clock using hwclock --hctosys --utc at the end
of my backup script.
