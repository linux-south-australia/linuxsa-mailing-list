&gt; &gt; 1 Shrink dos partition with fips
&gt; &gt; 2 install favourite distribution at end of drive
&gt; &gt; 3 start linux using loadlin rather than lilo to avoid the 1024 cylinder
&gt; &gt; bios problem

Since it's new, partition the disk into three partitions
(say 30MB, 2GB, 2GB) using FDISK.  Mark the center one as
bootable and reinstall Windows into it.

In the longer term, put /boot into the first partition.  Turn
the third partition into an extended partition and put both
swap (128MB) and root (1.9GB) into seperate partitions within
the extended partition.  Use the LILO boot loader to dual boot
Linux and Windows.  This sounds difficult, but is bread and
butter to Linux install programs.

Windows NT has some additional issues.  Again, the install
programs of most distributions will deal with this.

If you want to run three or more operating systems I'd save
myself hours of pain and buy a copy of VMware.

&gt; David's comments are very true - make sure everything works with Linux
&gt; before you purchase - there are many dud^h^h^hwinmodems out there :-(

You need to check for this.  IBM has marked some laptops as good for
Linux, despite the WinModem :-(

&gt; The lilo problem I think has gone away.  The latest lilo removes this
&gt; restriction I think.  "Caveat Emptor."

Depending on BIOS.  Also, disks that have boot files &gt; 1023
cylinders obviously can't be mounted on older BIOS machines.

Not such as issue for notebooks, but it means that larger
installations should leave /boot in a partition &lt; 1023
cylinders.

Finally, if you are doing this for work, you can get advice from
IT Services at the uni.  The ITS Help Desk also has a loans service
for operating system CDs.  For borrowing the Linux CDs you don't have
to quote your vendor contract number :-)  They only loan Red Hat Linux
CDs -- this is a blatant attempt to reduce the cost of Linux support
by encouraging only one distribution.

If you are going to run it on the uni network, then ITS should
have finished their configuration guide by now.  If not, Lachlan
should have some draft notes.  It's all sensible stuff like
running DHCP to get your IP address, using TCP Wrappers, encouraging
ssh, etc.

The last three major compromises at SA unis have been from unmaintained
Linux boxes, so please keep the patches up to date.  Red Hat has
a tool that will do this automatically, with cryptographic checking
of the patches.
