&gt; &gt;Howdy people,
&gt; &gt;       I have come across a problem with getting linux up and running and was
&gt; &gt;told that I could get help on this mailing list *grin* I recently
&gt; &gt;installed redhat 6 on a SCSI drive. My hope is that I could use loadlin
&gt; &gt;off my existing IDE drive (win98) to load linux. To do this of course I
&gt; &gt;need a kernel on the IDE drive (well that is the impression i'm under).
&gt; &gt;Well, since the SCSI drive is now formatted to the linux FS, I can't get
&gt; &gt;to it from windows and thus I can't get to the kernel. So I copied the
&gt; &gt;only kernel I could find from the red hat cd to the IDE drive and used
&gt; &gt;that to get linux started. Problem is, it won't detect my scsi host (but
&gt; &gt;redhat did detect it during installation). My thoughts were that perhaps
&gt; &gt;the explicit scsi host driver needs to be compiled into the kernel or
&gt; &gt;something similiar but I have no idea how to go about doing something
&gt; &gt;like that :) I'd be very appreciative if someone could help me out on
&gt; &gt;this one. Thanks in advance

Most distros use modules for things like SCSI and stuff. I am not sure
what can be done with modules and loadlin. What is the problem with
using something like LILO or even GRUB?

Or you could use another machine to compile a kernel with SCSI support.
