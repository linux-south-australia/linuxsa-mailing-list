&gt; &gt; My friend has a Toshiba Tecra 8000 laptop.  We are having problems with
&gt; &gt; the 2.2.15 kernel.  It boots fine with the 2.0.36 kernel, but recent
&gt; &gt; attempts to boot the 2.2.15 kernel have it freezing at the line
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	"running ntpdate to syncronise clock""
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; or something like that.  Now I suspect the problem has nothing to do with
&gt; &gt; ntpdate.
&gt; 
&gt; I was wrong.  The problem was ntpdate.  It was trying to poll the internet
&gt; while not connected to it.

The thing which is puzzling me is: why did the 2.0.36 boot fine and
successfully get past ntpdate?  You see, that is why I initially
didn't believe the problem was with ntpdate.  If the problem was that
it was trying to poll the net while not connected to it, then this
problem would have been the same for both kernels.

The only thing I can think of is that with the older kernel, pcmcia
stuff is broken, which means perhaps the networking stuff would behave
slightly differently?  It's a bit of a vague explanation --- anyone
got some clearer ideas?

Cheers,

Mark.

P.S. It's not urgent as now the new kernel boots, but I'm just
curious.



&gt; &gt; We have had problems with this kernel ever since it was
&gt; &gt; compiled.  Previously we have had the problem that the console keyboard
&gt; &gt; freezes, making it impossible to use the machine, except when it was
&gt; &gt; connected via ethernet and you telnetted in from outside.  We "overcame"
&gt; &gt; this problem by getting it to boot straight into xdm (kdm).  This meant we
&gt; &gt; didn't need to get near the consoles in order to use the machine.  Of
&gt; &gt; course we still couldn't use the consoles with much success.  Recently,
&gt; &gt; changing to a console results in a blank screen with a thin horizontal
&gt; &gt; line running across it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, now it won't even boot at all which is a real problem.  I
&gt; &gt; suspected the problem may be an apm one, but when I booted with the option
&gt; &gt; "apm=off" it still hung at the same place!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know what's wrong or what I can do about it?  It's very
&gt; &gt; frustrating.  Clearly it's some difference between the 2.0.36 kernel and
&gt; &gt; the 2.2.15, but if it isn't power management, what else could it be?  Any
&gt; &gt; other kernel options that could be causing the problem?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mark.
