&gt; I'm thinking to set up a cybercafe and definitely will be using linux as
&gt; the server/router/firewall for the local system. The workstations will
&gt; be using Win95/NT for user convenience. My problem is, how to automate
&gt; the users access to the net, e.g user A pay for an hour access, so after
&gt; an hour, his access to the net will be block automatically. I also think
&gt; to use some sort of local messaging program such as talk to warn the
&gt; users of his access time to the net. E.g. if the user A have 10 minute
&gt; access time left to use the net, the message system will warn the user
&gt; about it, so it won't be to harsh to cut his/her access instantly
&gt; without warning. Can these idea being implement to a system with linux
&gt; as a server and Win95/NT as the client?
&gt; 
Well, I don't think it should be too hard to do.
Using samba or ICQ or even forced proxy messages (ie. when they go to
load pages, it sez 'Error - Time (almost) Up') you can communicate.
I'd thouroughly reccommend a local squid proxy cache, since most webcafe
users always seem to go to the same places ;)

I'm pretty sure a decent perl or C programmer could easily make up the
appropriate parts to stick it all together...
You'd need a db file that has all the machines and their IPs, which
stores when their time runs out.
You have one program you can run that adds (or subtracts) time
remaining.
You have another program that runs every minute from crontab and checks
the db file to see if any machines have got times that are older than
the current time. if so, it sends them a message ( say by samba or licq)
and then tells ipfwadm to block their access to the rest of the world.
I'd say it'd only be a couple of hundred lines of code per program,
unless you wanted a gui interface or browser interface, but that wouldnt
be too much extra work.
If you go out and buy a couple of linux networking books and a perl book
you'd probably be able to do it yourself.
