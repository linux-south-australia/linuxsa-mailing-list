&gt; &gt; &gt;I have successfully setup my sendmail for approx. 100 clients.
The
&gt; &gt; &gt;problem is that my users are sending mails over 5MB of size and
my
&gt; &gt; &gt;connection is only a dialup at 33.6  which takes ages to deliver
those
&gt; &gt; &gt;messages.  I would like to restrict their mail sizes.  However,
some of
&gt; &gt; &gt;us would need to send big files too.  So far, I have searched
many books
&gt; &gt; &gt;and help on internet but they only mention that the
maxmessagesize is
&gt; &gt; &gt;set to all users.  Is there any way I can restrict maxmessagesize
on
&gt; &gt; &gt;some users and some are not?
&gt;
&gt;Not easily.  Perhaps you'd be better off doing what ISPs tell their
&gt;customers to do:  Put large files on a HTTP or FTP server and email
&gt;URLs instead?
&gt;
&gt;    - mark

Along the lines that Mark suggests, it often helps in these
situations just to let people know that you're watching their
mail volumes, and that large volumes have a significant impact
on the other users.  A cron job to kick of a scan of the mail
log for long jobs and generate an email is pretty easy to set
up, and you can include some standard suggestions on reducing
mail message size.

We manually review the logs every now and then, and send our
users a reminder that large messages consume a lot of resources
and that they should, for instance, zip large word documents.
Usually that changes behavior pretty quickly, and we don't have
to spend a lot of time raising limits so that one or other user
can send a large message.  We rarely have to ask more than once
and are happy to accept that some users have a genuine need to
send large files.

Frequently the offenders are newbies who have no idea of the
problems they are causing - we had a new customer who started
receiving a daily 60 Mb data file by email.  We pointed out
that this was pretty excessive, and that they could compress
the data with pkzip (in this case a 20:1 ratio was possible!).
It turned out our new user didn't have the program to analyse
the data in any case, and were more than happy to cancel the
mail item.

Cheers, Dieter.
