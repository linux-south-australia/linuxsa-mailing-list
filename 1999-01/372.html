&gt; Guys, 
&gt;At the risk of looking like an idiot, What is all the anti
&gt; hoo haa about html encoded email

For a graphic example, have a look at the example posted to this list
this evening by Romana. That message is posted twice, once in plain
text, and again as HTML. Why bother posting a message twice?
Particularly as some email clients that don't support HTML display all
the tags. If you are not familiar with HTML it makes the message very
confusing.

Support for HTML in email clients is flaky and inconsistent, some do a
better job displaying HTML than others.  How many email messages have
you seen that are enhanced because the sender used HTML? I've given up
viewing the supposed attachment that my email client says I've
received only to find it's a HTML repeat of the message I already
read.

If I knew how to do it, I would get procmail to delete all the HTML
email messages sent to me before they got to my mail box. And that's
another good reason not to post HTML messages, why post a message to
someone when the format is going to annoy them even before they've
read the content?

&gt; secondly why would anyone bother doing this anyway?

Usually it's technical ignorance, the sender is not aware that their
client is sending HTML email, or they don't understand what's
happening. That's OK, except this is a technical list, so a certain
level of technical sophistication is assumed. I think some email
clients have HTML set as the default so those users need to remember
to turn it off.

As a side issue, we've just had Outlook installed at work (I work for
DAIS) - as part of a department wide downgrade to Windows 95 (FAT32)
Office 97 and Outlook98.  The formatting monstrosities that people
have been sending internally have to be seen to be believed, now that
they have discovered rich text format and HTML. 

I'd vote for a public burning at the stake - as alternative to AFL
football on Saturday arvo's - for people who send HTML email or spam.

But some people might think that's just a bit extreme.
