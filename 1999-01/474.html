&gt; G'day everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I have a couple of sound related questions...
&gt;
&gt; First of all, why is it that some .wav files sound terrific but others are
&gt; horrible?   This is using either:
&gt;
&gt; /dev/dsp file.wav
&gt; or
&gt; soxplay file.wav

Some are probably 8bit and some are 16 bit.

&gt; Next, I finally seem have midi going, but the only program I've managed to
&gt; get sound from is kmidi, and even then it only plays some .mid files - on
&gt; others it goes through all the motions but there's no sound output. As I
&gt; understand midi, it's supposed to be a universal standard - either it
&gt; works or it doesn't. I have playmidi and xplaymidi, but looking at the
&gt; help file for it, I can't determine what switches are needed to have it
&gt; out put to the sound card, which is a generic ESS1688.

Kmidi isn't a universal midi player. It uses samples(files containing an
instruments range of notes) to translate a midi to a wav. This can either be
save or by default output to /dev/dsp.  When you play a midi but get no sound
it is because you have no patches for those instruments. Hence you are not
playing a midi using the processing on your card. (Admittdly midis generally
sound better through kmidi on a vibra 16 :)

Use playmidi - not the redhat 5.2 version as for me this completely fails to
do anything (it just gives me another shell prompt). The 5.1 version worked
fine. Then you'll hear midi the way your card can play it - then you'll go
back to kmidi  ;)

Cheers,
