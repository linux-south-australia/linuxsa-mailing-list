 &gt; What stops the retailer refunding you a pittance?  After all, neither
 &gt; of you have agreed on the value of the software which was bundled despite
 &gt; that you didn't want it.  If the retail offers you $10 for it, what can
 &gt; you do?

Complain to the ACCC:  Selling a product for less than you bought it
wholesale so that you can gain market share is known as "dumping."
If a retailer is going to claim that the Windows license you've
bought is worth $10, when there are contracts between the retailer
and Microsoft which state, in writing, that it's worth (say) $110,
then the retailer is not going to find themselves in a nice legal
situation:  It'd look like they were wearing a $100 loss on the sale
to gain a competitive advantage.

 &gt; I'll tell you what you can do: You can claim it's not a genuine refund
 &gt; because it cost the retailer more than that.  Truth is, I'm not sure
 &gt; what an OEM edition of Win9x costs the retailer, probably it's about
 &gt; $100, maybe as low as $50. 

I had an price list for one Adelaide wholesaler which had Win95 for
$45 (about a year ago).

 &gt; So if the retailer offers you that sort of
 &gt; amount then you have little (legal) cause for complaint.  The retailer,
 &gt; too, has little reason to complain.  The retailer has to buy the OEM
 &gt; licence (in bulk), but nothing stops him or her from bundling the media
 &gt; which you returned with the next system he or she sells.

Indeed -- It wouldn't even be against the license terms!
