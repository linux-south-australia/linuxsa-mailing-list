Hi,

Thanks to Nick M and Paul H for the valuable replies re: K6-2 on Linux. 
Much appreciated. Seems to work OK with Linux although my usual dealer
says that the AMD chips do not come with cooling fans (like the
good quality ones that come with Intel chips) and it's kind of
difficult to get really good cooling fans in this part of the world.

I 've managed to get some info on multiprocessor K6s from /.
So, for those who are also wondering, here's a snippet:

But what I'm really waiting for is SMP support. Anyone want to speculate
as to when this will happen? I understand the the K6-2 can already do
SMP just that nobody has built a board yet. To any mainboard companies
reading this first one to do this (with linux support/compatability)
gets my money and my undieing gratitude.

AMD has supported SMP since K6 i believe, but there are no chipsets
available because no manufacturers think people want SMP K6 or K6-2  
systems. Intel processors use APIC to do SMP, and AMD uses OpenPIC (an
open standard created by IBM, HP, AMD etc...). But there are no x86
mother-boards that support it. Blame it on Intel ;P 

Multiproc AMD's (Score:1)

AMD's have been Multi processor for a while, the catch is that they use
OpenPIC(I belive) Multi processor standard, not SMP. This means that
their are neither motherboards or software to suport multiprocessor 
AMDS. Another fact is that the AMDS are Super7 not Slot 1 since Intel
has refused to licenes this to AMD(can we say monopoly?). This drasticly
limits your choices, infact I have yet to find a Multiprocessor Super7
board. Currently AMD has recomended only two motherboards for use with
the AMD K6-2 400, and they are both FIC, which I have never used before. 

But I do have good news. AMD will be implimenting the SMP standard into
the new K7's which should be out 1st half 99! I'm really excited about
that, but I a waiting to see how many companies build multiprocessor 
motherboards with Super7 sockets.

I hope it won't be a long wait...

Cheers,
