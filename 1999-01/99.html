Hi linuxsa,

I have recently installed redhat 5.2 on a pentium based machine, set it up
as combination(server,workstation), used the following network information.


 ip:192.168.3.199
sub:255.255.255.0
default gateway: 192.168.3.254
nameserver: 203.5.73.2
hostname: spyro
domain: camtech.net.au

when i try to telnet in from another machine after setting up a new user,
telnet is taking up to 60 secs to log in, same with ftp(annon or with user
set): i am trying to telnet in from a win98 box and with a win95 box. Both
are doing identical things-almost as if waitng to timeout b4 advancing

on previous versions, RH5.1 & 4.2 etc i have had this working and it has
telnet in quite quickly   less than 1 sec. I am only a begineer to linux and
not exactly sure what I have done diffrently with this install.  When i had
the choice to select what pagagesto install,  the only things that I did
diffrently where not to install sendmail and amd. Apart from that I just
left the defaults. I have tried reinstalling a few times but with no change.

the other small problem I have is that not being able to up or download
anything from the ftp when it finally logs in, I have set permissions for
the user to all granted and in the /home/ftp/pub dir i have set all the
permissions to read,write,execute in all 3 areas.all i get is a 1 sec
transfer that says finished but nothing happens. no data transfered.

Not to sure what other information is needed but I hope this helps someone
to help me   thxs in advance :)
