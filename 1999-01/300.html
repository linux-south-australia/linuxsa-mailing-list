Hi People, I went ahead last night and tried to install REDHAT 5.2
unfortunately I ran into a few problems.

My system is a DEC 486 DX2 66Mhz with 64M ram, 2 X 2.1 Gb, SB AWE32 IDE
sound card, on-board S3 805 1MB video and all ISA slots, no PCI or VESA.  I
have Windows 95 OSR2 on the 1st HDD and an EMPTY 2nd HDD.  I use Quantum
disk manager so that my hardware can see the full 2.1Gb of the HDD.

When I go to the OS wizard in System commander and ask it to install a new
OS and then it asks for my boot diskette which I have, It then tries to
repartition my 1st drive instead of letting me put it onto the empty 2nd
2.1Gb drive.  I have played around a number of times and still cant get it
to want to install to the 2nd drive.  Then I decided to just go ahead and
install it without going through the OS wizard of SC4 and ask it to boot
drive a: and inserted my REDHAT boot diskette.  Marvel of marvels it
detected my CD-ROM on my SB AWE32 card (a process which took me hours on my
Win95 installation) and then proceeded to install.  I used the command line
switches:-  linux mem=64M expert  and things seemed to be going smooth
sailing.  everything installed and it then asked what kind of video card I
had and monitor and whether I wanted to install a network.  I selected no
to the network and that when everything died!!  came up with error no. 7
and hung.  I believe this was due to my CD-ROM which seems to have the same
problem under win95.  It is a 36X CD which seems to run too fast for my old
486 and so keeps getting stuck spinning at high speed and has to stop
completely every now and then.  I know of no way around this happening
other than borrowing a slower CD-ROM or getting a newer mother board.  or
maybe I should copy the whole CD onto the remaining 1Gb FAT partition on
the 2nd HDD and install it from there.  Any help would be appreciated.

regards
