&gt; Linuxarians everywhere, I found this small article in, of all places, Win NT
&gt; Magazine's mailling list Update.  Sound Familiar?!
&gt;
&gt; * WINDOWS REFUND CENTER OPENS ON THE WEB
&gt; The Microsoft End User License Agreement (EULA) that arrives with
&gt; computers preloaded with the Windows OS contains a statement that if
&gt; you don't agree with the EULA, you can't use the software, and you can
&gt; return the media for a refund. One user who loaded another OS on his
&gt; new computer tried to get the manufacturer (Toshiba) to honor the
&gt; agreement. However, throughout months of correspondence, this user
&gt; consistently ran into the manufacturer's complaint that Microsoft
&gt; wouldn't reimburse the manufacturer. In the end, the manufacturer sent
&gt; him a refund.
&gt;   He shared his tale with others via email messages, and those users
&gt; forwarded his messages to many other recipients who used a variety of
&gt; OSs (excluding Windows). As a result of his story, LinuxMall is hosting
&gt; a Web site to help users of OSs other than Windows understand the EULA
&gt; and get their refunds. To qualify, the first boot of the new computer
&gt; must be into the alternative OS installation program via disk. The hard
&gt; disk, preloaded with Windows, can't ever boot.
&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.linuxmall.com/refund/">http://www.linuxmall.com/refund/</A>

Given the facts that the OS is pre installed and most users would not
necessarily have the technical knowledge to boot the system some other way
(e.g. what if the BIOS was set to boot off the hard disk first) simply turning
on the computer would unfairly hvoid the claim for most users. There would need
to be a a warning (large) and details of how to start the computer without
using the preinstalled software for this to be valid. I think the current
method of assumed acceptance because you booted the OS, possibly inadvertantly
because you were not informed of any other way to start the computer is
entrapment.

I _ALWAYS_ specify when ordering a computer that Microsoft OS are not required
and request a price that reflects this. The best analogy I can think of is the
tray etc on a truck. Ford says pay for our standard tray and then if you don't
want to use it buy another one. Yeah. Tell that to a truck driver (I don't
think so).

The essential thing here is that the OS can change the suitability for the
purpose you have in mind, (the disk drive _probably_ won't) which is why you
might not want it. Explain the exact purpose you want the machine for and then
if the sales staff sell it to you on that basis you have many remedies at least
under Australian law, if not US law irrespective of the EULA.
