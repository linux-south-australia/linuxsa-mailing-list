I get a lot of spam, usually several messages from different sources per
day. I am still to work out where it all comes from, but I've found that
making a template email, and then posting it to postmaster@ and abuse@
the originating sites, sometimes helps. I usually include a few psuedo
legal demands n threats, along with requesting that I be removed from
their list, and be added to their blacklist of do-not-send-to.

However, many spammers spoof their email (ie. make it look like it's
coming from somewhere else.), and have a phone number to ring if you
want to either buy their wares, OR to be removed from their list.
Obviously, there is no way I am calling the US to get off a spam list,
so currently I have no way of dealing with these emails, except for
harrassing all the ISPs along the way that the message came from. (from
the messages headers.)

However, I worked out a plan quite a while ago, that sometimes helps.
You may or may not know, that if you give your email address as
username+<A HREF="mailto:something@your.isp.com.au">something@your.isp.com.au</A>, then it will still reach you, and
your mail program can see that it was sent to username+something.
Thus, whenever I give my email address out to 'untrusted' sources, I do
so in the form of myusername+<A HREF="mailto:name_of_place@myisp.com.au.">name_of_place@myisp.com.au.</A> So, if I then
receive email spam that is directed to myusername+celicas, then the
celicas mailling list is responsible.

This may help you track down the source of spam. I have never posted to
newsgroups (or at least, not under any of my current email addresses), I
don't use a real email on ftp sites or most sites that want email
addresses, and I always click 'I do not wish to receive unsolicited
email from this site' when I get the option. However, I am on several
mailling lists, and I'm sure some web sites are not that trustworthy.

Most ISP's don't want their users sending spam, and will shut down the
account if you complain. However, I have identified a few servers that
are commercially run, and only seem to be there to send spam. I worked
out one of them a while ago, that was running NT4+IIS, and aso had a
(badly made) website containing adverts for all kinds of dodgy products.
Since they ignored my email requests to be removed, and for them to
identify where my email address came from, I felt righteously justified
in doing my best at crashing or at least harrassing their server for a
week or so ;)

Anyway, seeyas, and remember to fight the good fight.

&gt; Hmm I see Rick Marshal got something similar to this, but from a
&gt; different place and a different return email. I dont know how I got on
&gt; this list either, but it only happened recently.  I am very careful with
&gt; my adress and I usually use a hotmail address for things where I expect
&gt; to get junk mail....
