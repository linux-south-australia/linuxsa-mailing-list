Hi,

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; If I knew how to do it, I would get procmail to delete all the HTML
&gt; email messages sent to me before they got to my mail box. And that's
&gt; another good reason not to post HTML messages, why post a message to
&gt; someone when the format is going to annoy them even before they've
&gt; read the content?

Simply look in the body of the message for the MIME tag with HTML encoding
(you should be able to see it in a plain text version of the message).
Well in theory anyway, I've never tested it.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; secondly why would anyone bother doing this anyway?
&gt; 

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; As a side issue, we've just had Outlook installed at work (I work for
&gt; DAIS) - as part of a department wide downgrade to Windows 95 (FAT32)
&gt; Office 97 and Outlook98.  The formatting monstrosities that people
&gt; have been sending internally have to be seen to be believed, now that
&gt; they have discovered rich text format and HTML. 

Ahh, like the Desktop Publishing revolution. now DTP is available for the
masses, you see thousands of fonts, and millions of colours used to
exess. I agree, HTML encoding is rarly mecessary, and the old internet
conventons to indicate Bold and Underline to describe the few times when
formatting might be useful.

&gt; 
&gt; I'd vote for a public burning at the stake - as alternative to AFL
&gt; football on Saturday arvo's - for people who send HTML email or spam.
&gt; 
&gt; But some people might think that's just a bit extreme.

Hear Hear :)

cya
