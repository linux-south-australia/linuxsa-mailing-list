Hi all,

First, this is only peripherally Linux related. If you are sensitive
about wasting 15 seconds on requests for help, please ignore NOW. If you
choose to read on, you will not be eligible for a refund of your free
licence fee under the EULA implied herein.

Guys and Girls, I bought my wife a scanner for xmas, to use with our
dual-boot linux/winblows95 system. It is a UMAX Astra 610s, which runs
pretty well for a home-user scanner. It comes with its own dinky scsi
card, which Linux doesn't like, not surprising considering the apparent
adherence to cheapness. My wife and I currently use it by scanning under
Winblows, then using the Gimp under linux to play with the images. It
appears that if I get a reasonable SCSI card I will be able to remove
the Winblows parts from the equation.

My request is for a recommendation for a replacement SCSI card that
Linux 2.0.35 or later will be happy with. I will probably make use of
the SCSI interface for other peripherals in future, but for now just the
scanner will hang on it. Price is somewhat important as well, as I am
not rich!

TIA of any replies.

PS I was very impressed to see Geoffrey's efforts re EULA and refunds on
Microsoft licence fees make it on slashdot. Well done!!!
