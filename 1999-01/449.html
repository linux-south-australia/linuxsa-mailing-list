&gt; &gt; In my experience, clicking on 'I do not wish to get spam mail' or
&gt; &gt; similar is almost a guarantee that you WILL get spam. Similarly, when
&gt; &gt; you get an email that says at the bottom 'reply to this email including
&gt; &gt; the word UNSUBSCRIBE to be removed from this list' is also a guarantee
&gt; &gt; of receiving more spam. Both are used as email adress harvesting and
&gt; &gt; confirming devices by unscrupulous spammers. It took me a little while
&gt; &gt; to cotton on to this, but my email is much less spammy since....
&gt; 
&gt; I think he means when you first enter your email address at a site, to get
&gt; a password sent to you or similar, _not_ after receiving spam mail which
&gt; gives you a unsubscribe URL.

No he doesn't. err no I don't. When you get spam email, you often get a
little polite looking note at the bottom that says something like 'reply
to this email with the word UNSUBSCRIBE to have your email address
removed off our list'. Or somesuch, it has thankfully been a few months
now since I got the last one!. My experience is that by doing as they
ask and replying, you do not get your email address removed from any
list. Rather, you are confirming to the spammer that the email address
that they assume is legit is actually legit, and then it seems the
floodgates open... Hey, if you don't believe me, try it yourself!

Or maybe not, it really, really isn't worth it.
