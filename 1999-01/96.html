People,

With a relative staying for a couple of days who originally came from
Melbourne, I spotted this in the Saturday Age.

On page 12 of the first section, there was a page with two articles,
(actually a half page with adds).  The text of the articles are at

	<A HREF="http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990109/news/news51.html">http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990109/news/news51.html</A>
	<A HREF="http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990109/news/news52.html">http://www.theage.com.au/daily/990109/news/news52.html</A>

All very positive, but at the end of the first article is this
gem.  It made both me and my wife laugh.

----------

It is not surprising that companies such as Microsoft are having
such a hard time with open source. In 1976, Bill Gates penned an
``Open Letter to Hobbyists'': ``As the majority of hobbyists must be
aware, most of you steal your software,'' Gates wrote. ``One thing
you do is prevent good software from being written. Who can afford
to do professional work for nothing? What hobbyist can put three
man-years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his
product and distribute for free?''

----------

Well if we added up all the man (person??) years in various open
source packages, how big would it be :).

Regards,

Matt
