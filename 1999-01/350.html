&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Now that GNOME and KDE are both at relatively mature release versions,
&gt; is there anyone willing to do a review or comparison of both systems on
&gt; behalf of the group? There have been a number of questions lately about
&gt; both desktops, so I suspect we have a pretty good source of info amongst
&gt; us. I for one would like to get some informed opinion, especially now
&gt; that GNOME is at 0.99 release, but I don't have the luxury at the moment
&gt; of being able to do a full install to check it out. Any takers?

My PERSONAL opinions:

A little bit of this is an apples and oranges thing. Gnome is not the same
in concept as KDE. Gnome is a desktop environment, which is a nice buzz
phrase, but to me it seems to boil down to the fact that it's not a
complete X makeover like KDE tries to be.

There is no such a thing as 'the' Gnome window manager - several are being
worked on (existing window managers getting Gnome functionality tacked on)
but AFAIK none are really prime time yet.

The heart of Gnome is the panel - it's like a souped up Windows taskbar,
but lots nicer. The rest of Gnome is about getting applications talking to
each other, intergration, drag and drop et al.

KDE is more of an all-in-one affair. It's the whole box and dice, Window
Manager, applications, file manager etc. 

'Third-party' (if such a term is accurate!) applications for Gnome tend to
be designed to run with or without Gnome, via a simple configure switch or
whatever. KDE apps on the other hand often seem to be KDE or nothing.

My personal experience with KDE told me it was still extremely buggy, not
worthy of the 1.0 release. However most of my Linux workmates are using
it. I think the difference is that with all these neat features (drag and
drop, web interegration etc) in KDE, I want to use them, and they crash.
Other people probably like the taskbar, the fact that windows click to
focus, have an X in the top right and a resize widget in the corner. These
things all work OK. KDE is probably nice for them.

I will be sticking with FVWM and when Gnome becomes stable, I'll use a
Gnomified FVWM + panel. But that may be a while, and FVWM is still going
strong.

All my personal opinions, from a relatively limited trial of each
environment.
