|&gt; &gt; Problem 1, when rebooting I'm getting an error message advising that an
|&gt; &gt; unchecked file system is being mounted, I have tried e2fsck -b 8193
/dev/hda
|&gt; &gt; and get a reply of bad magic number, I have know idea what I'm doing
here,
|&gt; &gt; any advice welcome.
|&gt;
|&gt; A couple of pointers:
|&gt;
|&gt;   o  You'll need to e2fsck the partition, not the whole drive, that has
|&gt;      (or might have) the filesystem with problems.  eg if you have linux
|&gt;      installed on the second partition of the first IDE drive, try
|&gt;      ``e2fsck /dev/hda2'' .
|&gt;
|&gt;   o  You won't need the ``-b 8193'' unless the superblock on the
filesystem
|&gt;      is corrupted.  Try without it first.
|
|And the biggest one of all (how could I have forgotten this?!?!)
|
|   o  **NEVER** run e2fsck on a filesystem which is mounted read-write.
|      Only run it on an unmounted filesystem, or a filesystem mounted
|      read-only.  If it's your root filesystem, do ``mount -n -o remount,ro
/''
|      before running e2fsck
|

Well the newbie syndrome has struck in this case, I have solved problem 1, I
was mounting the CDROM at boot time, found this one when booting with the
tray open, boy did it complain, but this was the first indication I got as
to what was happening, it complained about hdc.

Thanks for the replys and help stored for future refernce.
