&gt; &gt;  &gt; I'll tell you what you can do: You can claim it's not a genuine refund
&gt; &gt;  &gt; because it cost the retailer more than that.  Truth is, I'm not sure
&gt; &gt;  &gt; what an OEM edition of Win9x costs the retailer, probably it's about
&gt; &gt;  &gt; $100, maybe as low as $50.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had an price list for one Adelaide wholesaler which had Win95 for
&gt; &gt; $45 (about a year ago).
&gt; I've seen OEM win95 prices nowadays quite close to $25..One place I
&gt; talked to said that while they would give a refund to anyone who asked,
&gt; they would also charge a handling/processing fee, which would be larger
&gt; than the $25 refund.
&gt; I think the OEM price varies depending on bulk ordering, etc. The bigger
&gt; the company, the less it costs them. Given what it costs them, the
&gt; really big companies are probably wondering what all the fuss is about.
&gt; Although maybe they haven't realised that while 1x$25 isn't much,
&gt; 10000x$25 is a number worth thinking about.
&gt; One day.

Don't know. The boss at Harvey Norman Computer Superstores reckons that
MS pricing is one of the things stopping them from getting PC prices under
$100. The article was some months ago, but the situation probably hasn't
changed

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  &gt; So if the retailer offers you that sort of
&gt; &gt;  &gt; amount then you have little (legal) cause for complaint.  The retailer,
&gt; &gt;  &gt; too, has little reason to complain.  The retailer has to buy the OEM
&gt; &gt;  &gt; licence (in bulk), but nothing stops him or her from bundling the media
&gt; &gt;  &gt; which you returned with the next system he or she sells.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Indeed -- It wouldn't even be against the license terms!
