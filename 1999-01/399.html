&gt; Hello..
&gt;
&gt; I just have a quick question/point...
&gt;
&gt; If we can all have refunds on our unused pre-bundled windows 95's, can we
&gt; also have refunds on our unused pre-bundled -other- software, such as
&gt; office, encarta, those ridiculous games cd's (not necessarily all MS), etc
&gt; etc?
&gt;
&gt; Does the retailer have no comeback -at all-, considering the end user
&gt; agreed to the price of the computer -including- the software?  Should the
&gt; end user not have made a different deal with the retailer to start with?
&gt; I may be barking up the wrong tree here..  somebody set me straight :)
&gt;

Gotta make the deal before you hand over the readies. Ask "What is the price
without all the software?" If they won't talk ask someone who will. Most of
the time the extra software is marketing. It's a way to keep the hardware
price up. Bit like the free Coke deals at the golden arches.

Geoff got a good result, but I think he did it the hard way. It does make good
press and it also sends a clear signal that BSing the consumer is not a pretty
sight.

&gt;
&gt; I think that Geoffrey's Story is one of the most exciting things that's
&gt; come up on this list (with the possible exception of kernel 2.2.0 :P ),
&gt; and if it turns out like many of us are hoping, Microsoft will be dealt a
&gt; harsh, and well-deserved blow.
&gt;
&gt; Viva la Linux :)
