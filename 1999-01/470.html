&gt;Define the services you wish to provide to the outside world:  Do you
&gt;want people to see your web server?  You need port 80.  Your ssh
&gt;server?  port 22.  Your ftp server?  Port 21 plus whatever ports
&gt;it's using for data transfer (but they're "outbound" connections so
&gt;they don't count).  Your name server?  UDP/TCP port 53 inbound and
&gt;outbound.  Anything else?
&gt;
&gt;No?  So you have 5 essential ports...
&gt;
&gt;... And the other 131,067 ports are non-essential.
&gt;

I forgot to mention that we also comment these non-essential
services out of the "/etc/inetd.conf" so that _should_ anyone be
either on an acceptable IP (ie: 50% of ISP attacks are usually by 
the luser clients of that ISP), OR a real smartarse who can doctor 
their IP pkt headers (that one might just be my paranoia...but hey ;-), 
there will not be any services/daemons responding anyway 
and hence nothing to exploit. 

You could even be really sadistic and write some 
retaliatory "go away"/"nuke-em-back" programs to respond instead :-P
This would be particlarly good for the dorks who try and run netbus/BO attacks
on linux servers, even though these ports have no relevance on anything other
than Windoze boxes. (I haven't had the time to write one yet but it's on 
my wish-list)

As for HOW-TOs, I've not come accross any so far, just collated all the
various info from:
a) Talking shop like this with other sysadmins
b) Visiting the hackers sites themselves and checking what your getting hit
with
c) Getting attacked a hell of a lot and slowly but surely erradicating any
holes
they find in the system

But your right, it would be a lot easier (not to mention less stressful) if it
were all layed out in HOWTOs for anyone moving from dialup-access to more
permanent
connectivity (static IP, perm-dialup, OnRamp), where they suddenly become
a much bigger target of opportunity. 
Unfortunately, the problem is that the maintainer of such a HOWTO would have 
work 30 hrs a day to stay abreast with all the _latest_ 
cracks/hacks/exploits/bombers/etc that are around and if they didn't, 
everyone would be "pointing the finger" at them for giving them
false-confidence, etc, etc. This is a bit of a harsh senario but I'd imagine
it has crossed the minds of anyone who already had the idea of a HOWTO but
backed out on being the instigator. I hate to say it, but I know I wouldn't
have the time to run one (and still be confident of it's content).

Maybe an FAQ might be more practical, as these can allow for changes over time
and daemon versions by being in Cron order. Just a thought :-)
