<H1>New Computer, No OS?</H1>

Well, a different twist to buying a computer without a MS OS on it, a few
years ago I bought my first computer, a Pentium 90, now days I still have
it even though in a highly modified form, and yes it came with MS Windows.
	In those days being dumb to computers I had not even heard of Linux let
alone unix, my first experiences were not of reliability but continual
problems, so much so the system I bought had little value for the purpose I
intended.
Since then I have upgraded many many times, not once have I bought another
OS exception being Linux.
	I have continually and progressively upgraded my system over the years but
never upgraded the MS OS, I refuse to spend good money on something that is
not of good quality, it disappoints me when I spend money, time and effort
in researching computer hardware, to run MS Windows on it only to have it
crash every couple of hours.
	Yet! my expenditure on Linux is multiple times that of what I have spend
on MS product, I am more than happy to spend on a locally supplied product
money that goes back into research, supporting local business than a
commercial and proprietary product that offers dubious quality and little
support to local business.
	The point is I would much prefer to support a local business than a
multinational company that cares little after it has got your money.
To this comment I can supply actual accounts of service from local
businesses eg. Netcraft or Gar Day Tech who have been more than helpful,
but  go and find support on MS product you have to pay dearly for that!
credit Card over the phone Billed by the minute! I ask you what would you
prefer?

	There is an interesting side effect for someone like myself, learning as I
go, have become a bit of an expert/knowledge resource to my work mates on
Windows but Linux I plead lack of knowledge, the reason I have developed
skills in MS Windows is that I am continually fixing it, re-installing and
setting up, repetition builds memory but when it comes to Linux my
knowledge is different, I forget things, I set it up, get it working once!
it keeps working, hence I forget how I set it up to start with but what I
have found as a novice is by continual contact with the Linux community I
have come across more computer techniques than Windows users have even
thought existed.

	Food for thought!
