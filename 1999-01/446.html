&gt; First of all, why is it that some .wav files sound terrific but others are
&gt; horrible?   This is using either:

Depends on the format of the wav file. Some use compression and other
non-standard bit rates/sample rates. Your best bet is to get a program
called WAVPLAY. I got mine from a contrib.redhat.com mirror in RPM
format. I don't have a homepage for it handy, but I am sure that you
would be able to find it without hassle. Sox doesn't include functions
to handle the non-standard wav files, while wavplay does. Another useful
program (also from contrib.redhat.com mirror) is PLAYWRAP. This program
can be called with all types of audio files and it selects the best
player (Sox for .au and .voc etc, and wavplay for .wav files) for the
file. It is useful in things like netscape and so on where you want
to associate all audio to one program to play it.

&gt; Next, I finally seem have midi going, but the only program I've managed to
&gt; get sound from is kmidi, and even then it only plays some .mid files - on
&gt; others it goes through all the motions but there's no sound output. As I
&gt; understand midi, it's supposed to be a universal standard - either it
&gt; works or it doesn't. I have playmidi and xplaymidi, but looking at the
&gt; help file for it, I can't determine what switches are needed to have it
&gt; out put to the sound card, which is a generic ESS1688.

Hmm, try TIMIDITY. There was a web page at 
<A HREF="http://www.cgs.fi/~tt/discontinued.html">http://www.cgs.fi/~tt/discontinued.html</A>

but I think that page has since gone out of existance. He has some
links to other timidity sites. Timidity is (as far as I know)available
from the sunsite archives as well as the contrib.redhat.com archives.
You will need to download a sample set for that and then you can have
wavetable synthesis via software (better sounding midi). I have (as
yet) found only one midi file that won't play with timidity, and I'll
risk a bet that it was a Winblows .rmi file that was renamed to .mid
anyway.

The sample set is here 
<A HREF="http://pubweb.bnl.gov/people/hoff/midi/timidity.tar">http://pubweb.bnl.gov/people/hoff/midi/timidity.tar</A> 

but be warned it comes in at around 8-10 meg (i can't remember exactly).

playmidi and xplaymidi should come with the defaults to output via
the FM synthesiser on your card. Try xmixer to bring up the synth
volume or turn it on in the output. Or recompile your kernel to include
the FM modules for your soundcard. You would have had success with 
kmidi becausre that is a very rehashed version of timidity that uses
wavetable synths and outputs via your DSP device.

Hope this helps. If you have any questions or want any of the files 
that I mentioned, email me outside the list and let me know.
