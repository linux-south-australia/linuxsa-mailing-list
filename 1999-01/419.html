&gt;  &gt; I'll tell you what you can do: You can claim it's not a genuine refund
&gt;  &gt; because it cost the retailer more than that.  Truth is, I'm not sure
&gt;  &gt; what an OEM edition of Win9x costs the retailer, probably it's about
&gt;  &gt; $100, maybe as low as $50.
&gt; 
&gt; I had an price list for one Adelaide wholesaler which had Win95 for
&gt; $45 (about a year ago).
I've seen OEM win95 prices nowadays quite close to $25..One place I
talked to said that while they would give a refund to anyone who asked,
they would also charge a handling/processing fee, which would be larger
than the $25 refund.
I think the OEM price varies depending on bulk ordering, etc. The bigger
the company, the less it costs them. Given what it costs them, the
really big companies are probably wondering what all the fuss is about.
Although maybe they haven't realised that while 1x$25 isn't much,
10000x$25 is a number worth thinking about.
One day.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; So if the retailer offers you that sort of
&gt;  &gt; amount then you have little (legal) cause for complaint.  The retailer,
&gt;  &gt; too, has little reason to complain.  The retailer has to buy the OEM
&gt;  &gt; licence (in bulk), but nothing stops him or her from bundling the media
&gt;  &gt; which you returned with the next system he or she sells.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed -- It wouldn't even be against the license terms!
