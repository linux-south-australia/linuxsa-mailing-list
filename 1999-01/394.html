&gt; Why should it be impressive to know that

Huh? 

&gt; I.e. while people here were chuckling to
&gt; themselves and mumbling "Good on you,
&gt; Geoffrey" I didn't see much of an effort to
&gt; emulate the local success...

Huh? 

&gt; Only when our US-based counterparts
&gt; read of GDB's success was there any
&gt; great movement to make it work for
&gt; others who find themselves in a similar
&gt; situation (even though plenty of Linux-ers
&gt; & FreeBSD-ers here would have done).
&gt; 
&gt; Impressed...?  Not until we learn to do
&gt; what our US counterparts took for granted:
&gt; 
&gt; Insist on getting their due...

Only a yank would come to this sort of conclusion. 

The way I see it is that microsoft have been screwing us all for years,
and not only us, but also the yanks have simply accepted the fact that
microsoft could get away with charging us for software that many of us
never use.  

It took an AUSTRALIAN to take the initiative and insist on his rights for
a refund - and now that he has got it the yanks are simply jumping on the
bandwagon in an attempt to emulate his success.  

As for things starting to move AFTER the US folk got involved - Well, they
do have a population many times greater than ours, so naturally now that
they know about this Aussie success story their combined voices are sure
to be louder than ours, for no other reason than there is more of them. 

Cheers
Rod
