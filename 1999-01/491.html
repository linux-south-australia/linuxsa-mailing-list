&gt;Thanks to Nick M and Paul H for the valuable replies re: K6-2 on Linux. 
&gt;Much appreciated. Seems to work OK with Linux although my usual dealer
&gt;says that the AMD chips do not come with cooling fans (like the
&gt;good quality ones that come with Intel chips) and it's kind of
&gt;difficult to get really good cooling fans in this part of the world.

I've just got myself a K6-350 after some net based research.  Take a 
look at www.alternativecpu.com and work your way down to the FAQ for 
the K6, here's a snip from it:

   Q. What is the difference between an AMD K6 boxed and tray
   processor?

   A. Boxed K6 Processor The boxed K6 is a shrink-wrapped retail box
      that includes a K6 with a qualified heatsink/fan combo
      affixed and a three year warrantee. It looks like something that
      you would pick up off the shelf at your local CompUSA store.

      The boxed processor program was implemented by AMD so they could
      ensure that customers received high quality AMD products and did
      not have to worry about receiving a remarked or OEM processor.

      Individual tray units do not include a heatsink/fan and have a one
      year warrantee. These parts come from the retail channel.
						
... and there's lots more about remarking processors and dealer
problems.

I asked the retailer whom I got mine from about the boxed set and was
told that I would be unlikely to find one in Australia, so I agreed on
a tray CPU plus the fan that the store recommends - the idea is to get 
a fan with a large heatsink and a motor that uses ball bearings rather
than sleeve bearings.  However, I'm kicking myself today, I spotted
a K6-2 350 boxed set in the window display of another computer
retailer!

&gt;board. Currently AMD has recomended only two motherboards for use with
&gt;the AMD K6-2 400, and they are both FIC, which I have never used before. 

As of January, the AMD web site lists 15 motherboards that they have
confirmed to work up to 400MHz.

Take a look at www.amd.com , and while you're on-line, try super7.net
also.  After studying these, I can confirm that dual socket 7 m-boards
do not exist (yet).

PS. My K6-2 350MHz does exactly 699.6 bogomips just like the others 
reported on this list; my old Intel 386 33MHz does 6.9 bogomips so for
just over 10 times clock speed I get 100 times as many bogomips.. 
bargain!
