Hmm I see Rick Marshal got something similar to this, but from a
different place and a different return email. I dont know how I got on
this list either, but it only happened recently.  I am very careful with
my adress and I usually use a hotmail address for things where I expect
to get junk mail....

Dear fellow internet user,

Our research has indicated that you are among those who would be
interested in the following offer.  If this is not the case, please
accept our sincere apologies, and rest assured you will not receive
email from us again, as this is a one-time mailing.

Do you own a business, or have something to sell?  THOUSANDS of 
companies are sending out Bulk Email to dramatically maximize their 
profits.  Are YOU?  Despite what you may have heard, BULK EMAIL
WORKS!  If Bulk Email didn't work, THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE READING THIS!

*  Recently, an Internet Marketing Company claimed to be profiting
over $500,000 yearly from Bulk Email alone.
*  Many webmasters draw HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of new visitors to 
their websites from Bulk Email.
*  You don't even need a website to take advantage of Bulk Email.
*  You can generate an ENDLESS amount of quality leads for ANY 
business opportunity or MLM.

When you receive a Bulk Email advertisement, do you realize that 
HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of other people all over the world received 
that same Bulk Email advertisement?  Could your business benefit from
such a dramatic increase in exposure?

What About Spam?

What is one person's Spam is another person's information item.

Every so often, we get unsolicited email messages from firms 
letting us know about their promotional services.  These are 
occasionally useful to us for the company's use, or simply for an 
edge on what out competitors are offering.

On the other hand, we get several unwelcome email messages each day,
from aggregators trying to get us to sign up with them because they
can offer 9.9 cents per minute long-distance phone rates or from 
someone offering us a chance be in their downline. I guess I have 
to say we have a negative reaction to these commercial messages and 
would probably get a little argument from anyone if we called them 
Spam. The point we're making is that Spam, like beauty, is in the eye 
of the beholder. 

A bulk mailing to 100,000 people through the postal service will 
cost you $33,000 in postage alone, not counting the envelopes, 
stationary, and your means of obtaining all those addresses.  A bulk 
mailing to 100,000 people on the internet only consists of your cost 
to obtain the quality addresses to mail to.  Get your calculator
out; if you only make a sale from 1/10th of a percent of your
total mailing, that's 100 sales!  If you profit, say, $10 from each
each of those 100 sales, that's $1000 profit.  Keep in mind that
we were only talking about 100,000 addresses, and a low return rate
of 1/10th of a percent.  Just think of the possibilities of mailing
more, with more promising return rates!

LK Marketing specializes in the ongoing development of quality, 
targeted, bulk email address lists of virtually any size.  Our
lists can be custom-taylored to be sorted by any domain, area of 
interest, or even geographical location.  Our address lists are 
updated DAILY for removes and undeliverables.  Of course, they're 
also filtered to not include any .org, .edu, .gov, .mil, spam, and a 
number of pornographic-related addresses.  And of course, our lists 
are free of ANY duplicates.


As stated earlier, we can supply quality, duplicate-free lists of
ANY size.  Here are some quotes of our most popularly-ordered list
sizes:

  100,000 addresses = $20.00
  250,000 addresses = $40.00
  350,000 addresses = $60.00
  500,000 addresses = $75.00
  750,000 addresses = $85.00
1,000,000 addresses = $100.00
