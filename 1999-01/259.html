Topic: internal modem failures

Continuing on my report of a dodgy permanent modem connection......

The third modem I've tried on my 486 DX-66 with redhat 5.2
has failed in the same way as the other two.
[If you've forgotten, that was the problem that the received ping packets
would just buffer up and then get let go every 8 seconds, but
I couldn't locate the place where they were buffering up.]

It's not all that surprising, since the first two modems were
identical Discovery 33.6k modems, and the third was
a Web Excel 33.6k modem, which seemed to have the identical
board design except for the fact that a couple of the capacitors
were a bit smaller-looking.

I did a check on the IRQ 3 interrupts and found that indeed the
ppp module is innocent -- the IRQ 3 interrupts from the card
arrive in bursts, corresponding to ping receiving the ping packets.
In fact, the serial device driver is also apparently in the clear.

It seems, then, that either the card is buffering quite a bit of 
data, or the Telstra router has a bad modem interface.
I don't want to risk wasting money on a failed attempt by
Telstra to find a problem at their end.
So now I'm going to buy a fourth modem -- this time an external modem,
which hopefully will fix the problem.

The moral of this story seems to be to avoid internal modems.
They're difficult to debug, and apparently less reliable.
It looks like Mark Newton's right!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
