<H1>IDG Offers Student Discount for LinuxWorld Conference & Expo</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
Some of the best technology innovations are developed by young, inquisitive
minds -- students. Unfortunately, these innovators of tomorrow are often
today's "poor, starving" college students. IDG can't help them there, but
they can help them learn more and spend less cash.  As part of the first
Linux World Conference & Expo, IDG will offer all students an opportunity
to explore, inquire and create, and a 25% discount on the conference
program, to attend the upcoming show taking place March 1 – 4, 1999 in San
Jose, CA.

To learn more about topics like GNOME, Beowulf and Perl, just to name a
few, students can register for the SuperPass, which includes 2 days of
sessions, 2 half-day tutorials, keynotes and exhibits, The Conference
Package, which includes one or two day conferences (1 hour each), The
Half-Day Tutorial Package, which includes one, two or three half-day
tutorials (3 hours each) and The Full Day Tutorial Package. The Exhibits
Only Pass is FREE, along with a T-shirt, for students who register on the
Web by January 25th.

Registering now for the conference enables students to receive advance
information on new products and services, parties, events and awards. With
over 40 conference sessions and 13 tutorials to choose from, LinuxWorld
Conference & Expo offers students the most comprehensive showcase of
applications and technologies using Linux.  The show will highlight
exhibitors and users who will provide the most up-to-date technological
information about the industry.

Students interested in attending LinuxWorld Conference & Expo are entitled
to a 25% discount on the conference program when they register ON-SITE at
the show.

For additional information about the conference, visit the shows Web site
at www.linuxworldexpo.com.
