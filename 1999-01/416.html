&gt;  &gt; Conclusion:  I don't think we have any problem with desktop computers
&gt;  &gt; made in Adelaide computer stores. The problems seem to be with
&gt;  &gt; laptops, brand-name computers, and the US market.
&gt;
&gt; That's always been the case:  You'll recall that Geoffrey obtained
&gt; his refund on a Toshiba notebook;  You can't actually buy a notebook
&gt; made up from parts in the same way that you can build a desktop or
&gt; server.  That was the big deal about that story:  The fact that
&gt; you can get a refund on a brand-name computer.
&gt;
&gt; The brand-name computers sold by Myer, Radio Rentals, Harvey Norman,
&gt; and even Target for chrissakes, make up the vast majority of computers
&gt; that people buy.  So while it's probably no big deal for the denizens
&gt; of this mailing list to hear about a computer without windows, it
&gt; rocks the universe of someone who has bought a computer under the
&gt; assumption that the only software company in the world is Microsoft
&gt; (don't laugh, I've had to educate a few people about that in my
&gt; time...)
&gt;
&gt; Straw poll time:  How many people on this list bought their computer
&gt; specifically to run Linux?  How many of those computers were brand-
&gt; name systems?
&gt;

Yep. and Yep. Gateway and Dell have always cooperated.

I'd wager that the second question would produce very few positive

&gt; answers (because the kinds of people who are savvy enough to buy a
&gt; computer specifically for an alternative operating system are
&gt; generally savvy enough to get something cheaper, faster and bigger
&gt; than an off-the-shelf brand-name system).

But you've got to keep the clients happy too. They like brand names even if
it is more expensive.

&gt; Yet you have to answer
&gt; "Yes" to both questions to qualify for a refund.
&gt;
&gt; Notebooks are the big deal.
&gt;

IBM (shriek!) is good. Negotiate with your dealer - not HN, etc.
