&gt; Subject:        [SLUG] Windows Refund(s)
&gt;
&gt; Much discussion has taken place of late over the right to purchase a new
&gt; computer sans operating system - OK, let's be honest - without bloody
&gt; Windows !!
&gt; I've just had a conversation with the OEM department at Microsoft (having
&gt; been an OEM in Another LIfe(tm), as I have mentioned earlier), and here's
&gt; what they said;
&gt; "Microsoft has NO agreement with ANY OEM's to the effect that they
&gt; must supply Windows with their hardware. Should a purchaser require a
&gt; machine without operating system, the OEM is under no obligation to
&gt; Microsoft to supply Windows in any form".
&gt; This will be confirmed by email in the next day or so from the OEM
&gt; department.
&gt; When pressed further regarding the enforcability of the EULA, and the
&gt; subject of a refund, said Microsofter said;
&gt;                 "If you don't accept the EULA (and who really reads these
&gt; things anyway),
&gt; you are legally entitled
&gt;                 to return it (the software) to the supplier (of your PC) for
&gt; a full
&gt; refund of the purchase price paid. They
&gt;                 then return the software to their OEM distributor for a
&gt; refund, who
&gt; returns it to Microsoft for THEIR
&gt;                 refund"
&gt; This, apart from the "who really reads them" comment will, I believe, be
&gt; confirmed in the same email.
&gt; As soon as it's received, I'll post it here verbatim (or excerpted, to avoid
&gt; copyright problems !!)
&gt; So there you go - Dell, NEC, Toshiba, Gateway, Hardly Normal, HP, etc. MUST
&gt; give you a refund - they may not WANT to give you the refund, they may
&gt; squirm like cornered rats wuhen you insist, but legally they haven't a leg
&gt; to stand on.
&gt; Jon

QED

Like I've been saying. Just because they say so doesn't mean it is.

&gt;
&gt; P.S. I ran the EULA past a Judge I work with and he said pretty much the
&gt; same thing - apart from one comment "You mean they expect you to READ this
&gt; bullshit ??"...:-)

Consumer laws are pretty much the realm of each state. But keep in mind that
there are lot's of laws that _CAN'T_ be negated by any amount of documentation.
You have rights.

And I'll still bet turning the computer on doesn't negate your rights either.
If the man in the street can't understand the contract and is not advised to
get legal advice first the courts will probably not be impressed. Not to
mention cooling off periods etc.

This one has a LONG way to go.

Pass another beer while I wait for the next installment.
