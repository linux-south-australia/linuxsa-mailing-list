On Saturday, 16 January I posted the following to the list:

"On another list that I'm subscribed to (<A HREF="mailto:vim@vim.org">vim@vim.org</A>), there has been
some discussion as to how many Vim users there are. I was wondering
how many people on this list use vim on a regular basis."

I had 13 replies to that post, accounting for 19 users, add me to the
list for a total of 20 users. I had a look at the LinuxSA archive, it
reports a total of 437 authors posting to the list which I imagine
must be approximately the number of people subscribed to the list.

Thats about 4.6% of the people on the list using Vim. I was a bit
surprised that so few people use Vim! But I don't want 417 email's from
people telling me they use emacs, elvis or pico :-)

The most recent guesstimate that I have seen, suggested that there may
be 7,000,000 Linux users world wide. So my crude survey indicates
there may be at least 322,000 Vim users out there. And of course Vim
is used on other flavours of Unix, and it's also ported to Microsoft
operating systems.

I wonder what the most popular editor is? emacs I suppose.

*** 

On a separate issue, some careful editing of engspchk.vim (a file that
I mentioned in an earlier post) with Vim, sort and sed will give you
an excellent .words file for ispell (138,750 words). Particularly if
you concatenate linux.words with engspchk.vim and then remove the
duplicates with sed. I've posted a copy with the duplicates removed at
<A HREF="http://www.on.net/clients/pacs/pub/misc/vim.words.gz">http://www.on.net/clients/pacs/pub/misc/vim.words.gz</A> for those that
may be interested.

Regards, Steve
