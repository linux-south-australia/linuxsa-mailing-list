&gt;Microsoft are not the sort of people who
&gt; would give you a refund without a fight.

Stallman said it at his Linux SA talk:

You've got to fight (maybe he said
make some sort of "sacrifice")
to keep your freedoms...

(I *KNOW* this may fly in the face of
those of you - unlike GDB - who may
suffer with the dreaded
"[South] Australia Syndrome"

i.e. the " 'better not try to change *that* "
attitude that helps keep School Uniforms,
Restricted Trading Hours and
Pokies *without* display of the Odds
(or even Pokies' exemption from the
new No-Smoking venue legislation)
in South Australia...

To prove the point:  Compare the difference
between the responses to GDB's Saga
posting... first in USA... and then in Oz...  ;)

&gt; They would probably sue you for something instead.


Have you ever heard of the "Boston Tea Party"...?
(It could be worse...  Those guys were SHOT at...
as they acted to keep their freedom from Britain)

If your your point: "Don't bother"  Keep it, friend...  ;)

I have not time for a "it's too hard" response to
acts that tend to increase our freedom...

Too bad Geoffrey's action didn't come in time to
the become the First Known Refund (that was
Donna's honor... so far...)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A friend of mine here bought up the following question :
&gt;
&gt;If you are in a big organisation that has a MS site agreement for all
&gt;software, and you buy new machines in which come with some form of MS-ware
&gt;pre-installed, then it seems like you have paid twice for the operating
&gt;system.
&gt;
&gt;Is your large organisation then elligible for the refund on the
&gt;pre-installed operating system on the new computers that you purchase ?
