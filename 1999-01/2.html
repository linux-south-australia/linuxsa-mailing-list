&gt; It might seem ridiculous, but I created five users and the funny thing
&gt; about it is that, not every user's home works the same! For instance

How did you create the users?

&gt; some users cannot use the "X" button of the window to exit a program. It
&gt; has to be done by going to "File" then selelct "Close" or "Exit".
&gt; Otherwise it won't work. They cannot use the "minimize", maximaze" or
&gt; "exit" (X) button.

Under X the applications and the window decorations are controlled by 
individual processes.  The application creates a window, and the window
manager (whatever KDE uses) applies the window decorations.  

So in effect the 'X' method of closing and the 'file/close' method of
closing are not exactly related.  The 'file/close' method would be the
best method, depending on the author of the program you are using the
'X' button might just cause a window to disappear (as netscape sometimes
does when it get's confused).  Remember that the window manager only
adds decorations, the application has the best way to shut down an
application.  The link between them is sometimes good, but sometimes poor.

Depending on the precise configuration the window manager requires it
might be that there are some 'dot files' that are missing from the users
directories.  Do a 'ls -al' in the working and non-working users home 
directories and see what the differences are.   

Tell us the differences between the creation technique and the users
directories and I am sure we will be able to fix the problem.

Regards,

Matt
