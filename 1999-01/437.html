&gt; Steve,
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for that.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm talking about the script-in-the-/etc/rc* method as being
&gt; unreliable in the sense that it _could_ fail.
&gt; All things can fail, of course.
&gt; And I didn't want the "ppp" connection to go ahead if it does fail.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From the first two replies to my query, it looks like there _is_
&gt; no "init" or "conf" file of the sort that I'm looking for.
&gt; 
&gt; So probably the best idea is what you suggest -- write a
&gt; cleverer script-in-/etc/rc* which will check out all the
&gt; return values of the "ipfwadm" invocations, and then
&gt; somehow prevent "ppp" from booting until the
&gt; firewall is in place.
&gt; 
&gt; This must be a common problem, though, because there is a provision
&gt; to make "ppp" pop pack on boot-up, which is obviously very useful.
&gt; And I had hoped there would be some way of expressing the
&gt; _dependence_ of the ppp invocation on the _success_ of the
&gt; ipfw configuration.
&gt; 
&gt; This is something which, if addressed, could add reliability to
&gt; a potential weak point of linux security.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; PS.  In the 6-7 weeks since I started up my site, I've had
&gt; two significant attacks on my site.
&gt; The first was an attempt to remotely mount one of my
&gt; unprotected NFS exports (I've remedied that oversight now).
&gt; That failed.
&gt; The second was reported to me by someone in the US who said
&gt; they found someone doing attacks on a hit list which
&gt; included me. They said something about "portscan" and
&gt; attacking my "named". I think that failed too.
&gt; This indicates that I should expect an average of one
&gt; attack every 3 weeks!!!!!
Well, if it's any consolation, I run a server that's online for 90% of
the time, and if I check through the logs I usually see a few people
running a portscanner over it, or else trying various nukes out on it.
My server doesn't actually provide any public services, but I guess
there are people out there who have tools that accept a range of IPs,
and then scan through all ports on all of them, looking for security
holes, and the like. wingate lusers are often a nice target for this
sort of stuff, since most of them have no idea what's going on, I guess.
Whenever I see this going on on my PC, I send an email to the admin at
the originating ISP, stating that I have detected one of their users
doing whatever they were doing, and I provide the IPs and time, and my
offset from GMT time. Some things can have IPs spoofed, but port
scanning usually doesnt.
ISP's don't like kinder-hackers, since they're usually the same type
that will be downloading warez 24 hrs a day or flooding people, and thus
using a lot of the ISP's bandwidth. I know some ISPs have a strict 'no
port scanning/BO-scanning/flooding/spamming/etc' policy, so if you see
someone doing it to you, then send their ISP an email and let them deal
with it ;)

On another note - you can use linux to monitor the various common ports
that are targets of winnukes, BO, netbus, etc. and then log the incoming
IP, and automatically email them stuff back...It's quite neat, and
totally automated. Although i guess it leaves you vulnerable to flooding
and thus sending millions of emails out, so I tend to just log it
locally.
