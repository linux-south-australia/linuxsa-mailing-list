 &gt; Conclusion:  I don't think we have any problem with desktop computers

 &gt; laptops, brand-name computers, and the US market.

That's always been the case:  You'll recall that Geoffrey obtained
his refund on a Toshiba notebook;  You can't actually buy a notebook
made up from parts in the same way that you can build a desktop or
server.  That was the big deal about that story:  The fact that
you can get a refund on a brand-name computer.

The brand-name computers sold by Myer, Radio Rentals, Harvey Norman,
and even Target for chrissakes, make up the vast majority of computers
that people buy.  So while it's probably no big deal for the denizens
of this mailing list to hear about a computer without windows, it
rocks the universe of someone who has bought a computer under the
assumption that the only software company in the world is Microsoft
(don't laugh, I've had to educate a few people about that in my
time...)

Straw poll time:  How many people on this list bought their computer
specifically to run Linux?  How many of those computers were brand-
name systems? 

I'd wager that the second question would produce very few positive
answers (because the kinds of people who are savvy enough to buy a
computer specifically for an alternative operating system are
generally savvy enough to get something cheaper, faster and bigger
than an off-the-shelf brand-name system).  Yet you have to answer
"Yes" to both questions to qualify for a refund.

Notebooks are the big deal.
