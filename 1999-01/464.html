hey guys

anyone have experience with compiling 2.0.32 (RH5.2) Linux kernels for
(old) Sun Sparc architectures?

I've had a look in the source tree /usr/src/linux

in that "Makefile", i changed the variable
ARCH = 1386 to
ARCH = sparc

and did "make config"

it worked OK, and I selected what I thought was right

when I tried "make dep" the error was : Can't find **** no such file or
directory.

I can't remember exactly, but the point is, I looked in the directory that
it was looking in, and I found the directory (I think its called mm....)
mm -&gt; mm-i386 (link)
mm-i386 (dir)
mm-default (dir)

and no mm-sparc (dir)



Do I not have the complete kernel source?

and help is appreciated...

regards
Jake
