Hi all,

btw, as a Microsoft Certified Professional, I'd like to say just how great I
think Linux and the linux community is, and how it generally rules over dows
in every way possible.  There truely isnt any other thing in the world that
you can just ask for help, and receive it so willingly.

With that done, heres the problem  :)

Ill put all of the logs/screen outputs/files at the bottom of the email so
as you dont have to scroll all the way down  :)

Basically, I used to have Xwin running fine on my Debian system.  It took
awhile and the help of a friend, but we finally managed to get XF386Config
configured correctly and got xwin starting on boot.

A few days ago, I ran out of space on /var so, being a newbie to the whole
thing, decided that I should clean out the logs.  So I got rid of every log
with a .x extension where x=a number.  The reason I mention this is because
this is the only thing that I can think of that I have done to the linux box
just before I noticed xwin not working.

Basically, what happens is on boot, xdm supposedly starts, but it doesnt
actually initialise fvwm.  tty7 locks up, ie I can't get to it via ALT+F7,
then when I run startx, I get the results below:
