Mark,

Just for the record (and hoping not to fan the embers of this
discussion again), when I looked around for a PC in December without
windOS. I thought I'd amaze the dealers with my sophistication
by asking if I couldhave the machine without windOS.
None were surprised. They all said that was okay, and I specifically
remember at least one of them naming $110 as the reduction in
price. 

Conclusion:  I don't think we have any problem with desktop computers
made in Adelaide computer stores. The problems seem to be with
laptops, brand-name computers, and the US market.
The shop that finally sold a computer to the friend I was shopping with
very happily formatted up the disk with windOS on one partition,
and leaving a partition free for linux etc., as if it was a normal 
thing. They were happ to sell it with just low-level formatting or
whatever I wanted.

None of the shops we went to had any difficulty with a non windOS
machine at all.

Another conclusion:
When buying a computer in Adelaide, I reckon anyone not wanting
windows should just ask for their $110 deduction straight up.
That seems to be the standard figure.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
