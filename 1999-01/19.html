First of all thanks for all the help I received with my previous
problem. I have re-installed linux now and everything seemed to be ok,
until today. Btw, I also checked the hardware lists for linux and my
computer seems to be fine. The scsi card and scanner aren't supported,
but that's ok - i'm not using them under linux.
I wasn't really doing much, just checking out some files and other
stuff. I just had a look at meminfo and also had the control panel open.
I was at this time logged in as tom (an account I made). Just previously
I had changed to super user for a bit to get to the printer
configuration tool and get my printer going. I then exited from super
user and pressed the button on control panel for package management. It
sounded to me like a fair amount of swap-filing was going on (the hard
drive was churning). This continued without loading the package
management tool (or an error telling me I need to be the root to access
this - I don't know if that's the case). After a couple of minutes I did
this: "ctrl-c". No effect. After another couple of minutes: ctrl-\.
Still no effect. During the whole time the mouse was ineffective and no
keyboard keys worked either.
Right after waiting for about 5 minutes for something to happen (the
hard drive was still going for it like mad), I hit ctrl-alt-del. Well lo
and behold: no effect. I tried it again as well as the other two - still
nothing. Had to go for the reset button. After reboot fsck ran and after
the check mounted the file system in read-write mode and didn't prompt
me to run e2fsck manually. All seemed fine from this point onwards.
This is the second time that linux has done this to me - only the first
time I lost many critical files which stopped me from doing the simplest
things like mounting filesystems.
If anyone can help me stop this from re-occuring, it would be most
appreciated. Please tell me which config or log files you would like me
post out.

Thanks in advance

Tom
