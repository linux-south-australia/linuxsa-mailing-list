&gt; 
&gt; I want to set up two different linux operating systems on a new 4.3g 'C'
&gt; drive and to coexist with Windows '95. 

The correct term is Master and Slave for Primary, Master and Slave for
Secondary, and so on...

The 'C' drive-ism is related *only* to the first primary DOS partition on 
the hard drive and only makes sense for MS DOS|Windows.  So more correctly, 
you have a drive that you want to use as your primary master.  If you think
of it in terms of master/slave on a primary/secondary/... controller 
things will make a bit more sense (especially the Linux IDE HD naming
convention).

&gt; I envisage allocating say 1.2g to each of the linux Os's and the balance
&gt; of the 'C'drive to Win '95. I also have a 1.2g 'd' drive that is
&gt; available for Win '95.

D: would be primary slave (as above)...

My suggestion would be set the drive up as follows (assuming that 
the drive is LBA with Cylinders &lt; 1024 ),

/dev/hda? is the primary master
/dev/hdb? is the primary slave

	/dev/hda1 - 2.0 GB - Win95    
	/dev/hda2 - 100 MB - Linux Swap
	/dev/hda3 - 2.2 GB - Extended Partition
	/dev/hda5 - 700 MB - Linux /home
	/dev/hda6 - 750 MB - Linux / #1
	/dev/hda7 - 750 MB - Linux / #2

        /dev/hdb1 - 1.2 GB - Win95 

Splitting the partition up that way will allow you to have your Windows 95
install, two Linux installations (eg Caldera and RH) but still have a 
common /home directory (really good for having access to data from both
systems).

&gt; My questions are;
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Will the MBR accept 3 (or more) operating systems?.

The MBR is basically a small program, a partition table and a
small areas with various bit patterns.  MS Operating Systems tend
to be picky about some bit patterns.

The partition table can have 4 partitions, one of the partitions can
be an extended (as I have indicated above), within an extended partition
you effectively have another 'pseudo' drive, which also has a partition
table.  Generally these extended partitions only have a single partition
in them.  Other logical drives are created by adding an extended 
partition and creating drives within that....  Diagramatically the
layout above becomes ...

 +--------+----+---------------------+
    win95  swap        extended
               +-----+---------------+    These are logical drives
                /home    extended         in the extended partition
                     +-----+---------+    which is hidden by fdisk.
                      / #1     ext.
			   +---------+
                              / #2
Which logically becomes

+--------+----+-------+------+------+
  win95   swap  /home   / #1   / #2

&gt; 2) What would be the optimum workable strategy for disk allocation for
&gt; each of the 3 operating systems for  'C' drive in terms of bootloading
&gt; constraints?. 

The small program in the boot sector normally (with DOS) looks for the 
'active' or boot partition and then seeks to the first or boot sector 
of the partition to start the operating system there.  

That is why during most Linux installs you get the option to install
LILO in either the MBR or the boot sector.  Each is designed to be 
used at either stage in the boot process.

If you take the boot sector option the MBR program needs to be told to 
boot from the Linux partition.

If you take the MBR option then pretty much straight away the LILO MBR 
program runs code in (typically) the boot directory of the Linux
filesystem to start the booting of the kernel or switching to DOS.

Now back to the question....

Since (as described above) the MBR installation of LILO pretty much 
moves run a program that could do just about anything.  You are not 
limited by anything in terms of the directions that the boot process
goes.

Of course you can always check out the Partition mini-HOWTO.

Hope this all makes sense...
