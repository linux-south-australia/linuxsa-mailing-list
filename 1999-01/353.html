&gt; &gt; Heyas All,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Since my last post, I have got the mouse to work, by not running GPM on
&gt; &gt; start-up, and I have got the network running, by recompiling the kernel with
&gt; &gt; support for the PCI NE2000 built into the kernel Works perfectly. I have
&gt; &gt; even got ICQ running under Linux. There's just a couple of other things...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First of all, sound. It isn't set up. I compiled support into the kernel for
&gt; &gt; it (its a SB Vibra16). Is there something else I need to do to get it to
&gt; &gt; work? Under RH I just used the sound configuration program. But I can't get
&gt; &gt; it the card work under Slackware. Although, I'll admit I don't know much
&gt; &gt; about it...
&gt; make sure your io/irq/dma stuff is set properly when you compile the
&gt; kernel. Oh, and look at your boot messages with dmesg | more. It should
&gt; say something about the soundcard.

I used the Sound HOWTO with success when I couldn't get one particular board
going. There are a few obscure thing sthatneed to be done. Follow the
instructions to the letter.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, a couple of requests for recommendations. I am currently using Outlook
&gt; &gt; Express for my email, because I like the 3 pane view with the folders,
&gt; &gt; message headers and a message preview. As well as the filtering and multiple
&gt; &gt; POP3 account support. Is there any program similar to that for Linux? Those
&gt; &gt; three items are really my only requirements. The 3 pane view, decent
&gt; &gt; filtering and multiple account support. Anyone recommend an email client
&gt; &gt; that will do those?
&gt; Balsa is a nice gtk based email client, and as for filtering and multiple
&gt; accounts, if balsa wont handle it, procmail will.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, I am in need with a word processing, spreadsheet, database, type
&gt; &gt; program. One that will import MSOffice 97 files as that is what the
&gt; &gt; University is using, and MSWorks 4 files as that is what my parents use.
&gt; &gt; What programs are decent?
&gt; StarOffice will handle MSOrifice 97 files - just. Forget about really
&gt; advanced tables etc. Not sure what wordperfect can handle..
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; After I get all the above things worked out / installed, I should be able to
&gt; &gt; take the plunge and do a 'deltree c:\windows' ... maybe... I will certainly
&gt; &gt; be able to almost forget Windows is on the machine...
&gt; I'll prolly do that when they port Half-Life to Linux. Until then,
&gt; though...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Oh, yea, there is one other thing before I go. How do you add items to the
&gt; &gt; "start" menu in X. In the fvwm95 window manager? (Did I spell that right??)
&gt; nfi, sorry

.fvwm2rc95 - there is doco somewhere.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers, and TIA
&gt; &gt; Dazz
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Michael.
