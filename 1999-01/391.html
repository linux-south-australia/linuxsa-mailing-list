Subject: Geoffrey's Toshiba Webpage


&gt;Can we see some web hit stats
&gt; on the Toshiba Page for the last few weeks?
&gt; I imagine it must be pretty impressive?


Impressive?

Why should it be impressive to know that
ONLY AFTER IT WAS NOTICED IN USA
did people begin to do anything substantial
with it?

I.e. while people here were chuckling to
themselves and mumbling "Good on you,
Geoffrey" I didn't see much of an effort to
emulate the local success...

Only when our US-based counterparts
read of GDB's success was there any
great movement to make it work for
others who find themselves in a similar
situation (even though plenty of Linux-ers
& FreeBSD-ers here would have done).

Impressed...?  Not until we learn to do
what our US counterparts took for granted:

Insist on getting their due...

(Is there any wonder that Australians
do not yet have a local head-of-state,
Bill of Rights or acceptible levels of
taxation at the run up to the Y2K?)

What can we learn from this story?

;)
