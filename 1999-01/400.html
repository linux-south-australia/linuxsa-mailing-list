&gt; Guys,
&gt;         Thanks for the info on this subject, I hope I don't start a flame war on
&gt; this, I haven't come across html email but I have heard heaps about it.
&gt;         I am familiar with HTML though, and have had some WEB authoring experience
&gt; which is why I was baffled as to why one would bother with HTML emails with
&gt; all the added tags and formatting would fatten the email message
&gt; unnecessarily in my opinion.
&gt;
&gt;         This is one of the things I dislike about MS based computing ie. OS and
&gt; software etc is all getting bigger, fancier and more resource hungry all
&gt; the time, on the other hand computer technology is getting faster and
&gt; better so are we any better off except for more fancy features.
&gt;         Hence my interest in Linux generally, I am not interested in seeing all
&gt; the fancy wiz bang features and bullshit (please excuse the language) that
&gt; seems to come with MS based software, they appear to be selling the gliz
&gt; and glamour but not reliability, one could ask does HTML encoding of email
&gt; really add any value to it?

Depends on the email and the audience. ZDNet does a good job and I'll bet for their
target audience it's perfect. A technical group like this doesn't really need it
because we're not marketing our services, just sharing our success and frustration.

&gt;         Email is a great medium, simple text, low band width and hence fast to
&gt; traverse the Internet or whatever network system, so is there any advantage
&gt; of increasing the bulk of the message just because we can and now have
&gt; faster Internet, network and computer speeds to do it?
&gt;
&gt;         So for my 2c worth keeping the message compact and efficient has got to be
&gt; an advantage.
&gt; &lt;/rant&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt;         Paul
