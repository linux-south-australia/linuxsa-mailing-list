I'm very much an amateur with linux, but I have played around a little bit. 
Also, I'm not at my system now and my memory for version numbers and the 
like is terrible ....

Firstly is your video card using the G200 (or G100) chipset? Or is it the 
older Matrox chipset (such as on the Millenium II cards).

I have a Matrox Millenium AGP (8Mb) G200. About a month ago I installed 
Slackware (Version???). However, this distribution only came with XFree86 
3.3.2 (??). This doesn't support the G200 (or so I believe). I downloaded 
and installed (at least I tried to - don't know if I did it right or not!) 
XFree86 3.3.3. This has G200 support in the standard SVGA server.

XFree86 3.3.2 probably does have support for the older Matrox chipset - so 
if you're using that version of X and selecting the Matrox Millenium - but 
you actually have a G200 (or G100) - you're not selecting the hardware that 
you actually have and you'll probably run into problems.

However, I do remember having some troubles using XF86Setup to configure 
the video RAM ..... I took to directly hacking into the xconfig file (yeah, 
I just wanted to say 'hacking'!!) and wound up with an operating XServer.

However, my display is a bit "flickery" which disappointed me considering 
the display hardware I'm using (Millenium G200, 8MB AGP, ViewSonicP775). I 
haven't played around with the setting much since getting something 
working. Any ideas on general display performance enhancement?

&gt; I also chose the standard SVGA server that ships with 5.2.

Which version of XFree86 (if any?!?) ships with 5.2??

&gt; Has anyone out there successfully installed 5.2 with the same video card 
that give me &gt; some info on how they
&gt; did it ?

I've done it relatively successfully (.....) using Slackware and a 
Millenium G200 AGP. If this is relevant I'll check my system tonight and 
get back to you with more info .....

&gt; Do I need additional files say a different x windows server ???

I believe the standard SVGA server is the correct one to use. (At least for 
the G200 it is.)

As I said, let me know if anything about my situation is the same as yours 
and if so I'll get you more details.

Cheers,
Mike.
