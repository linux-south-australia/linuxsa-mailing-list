Hello..

I just have a quick question/point...

If we can all have refunds on our unused pre-bundled windows 95's, can we
also have refunds on our unused pre-bundled -other- software, such as
office, encarta, those ridiculous games cd's (not necessarily all MS), etc
etc?

Does the retailer have no comeback -at all-, considering the end user
agreed to the price of the computer -including- the software?  Should the
end user not have made a different deal with the retailer to start with?
I may be barking up the wrong tree here..  somebody set me straight :)

I think that Geoffrey's Story is one of the most exciting things that's
come up on this list (with the possible exception of kernel 2.2.0 :P ),
and if it turns out like many of us are hoping, Microsoft will be dealt a
harsh, and well-deserved blow.

Viva la Linux :)

(and KDE rocks)

&gt; &gt; This is truly stunning.
&gt; &gt; I'ts now being systematized.
&gt; &gt; Apparently to get your refund you take 4 simple steps,
&gt; &gt; including going to the small claims court.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know what happenned to my earlier reply, but in essence I don't
&gt; have the problem because I always ask for a machine without windows and
&gt; get a special price. Maybe what we should do is list those vendors that
&gt; are cooperative in this matter. Gateway and Dell have both provided me
&gt; with pricing sans OS and I'm sure others will too. (This was 8 months
&gt; ago). Most small (corner) computer shops will too. Try asking and support
&gt; the guy who does the right thing by us.
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe we can give them "Linux Friendly" endorsement.
