Question: Does linux correctly remove long file names from
win95 FAT32 file systems operated by wind98.

For quite some time now, I've had no problems moving files
back and forth between a linux and wind95 file system
on a computer with two disks -- one for linux and one for wind95.

But now, a friend has installed linux (at my urging) on a pair of
parititions at the end of a 6.4 GB disk drive, and then
we downloaded a whopper file with IE from an FTP site,
and IE converted the big file name (only about 60-70
characters) into a shorter file name (including a `"` character)
in folder C:\. Then we used "mv" from the linux OS to
move the file into the linux file system.

Next time the wind98 OS started up, it had big problems with it.
It sort of froze, and when next re-booted, it ran "scandisk"
because of a long file name somewhere, and then got rid of it.
The long file name should not have still been there.

This suggests some hypotheses:

1.	linux OS (redhat 5.2) does not correctly remove
	files from win95/FAT32 file systems if the file name
	is too long or else munged by the wierd mechanism
	that the wind95 file system has for doing non 8+3
	file names.

2.	linux OS has a general problem with removing files
	from a wind96/FAT32 file system that is managed by wind98.

3.	IE just mucked up the whole file creation and
	directory-entry creation process when it created the file.

4.	Putting in the LILO MBR on the disk somehow
	mucked up wind98.

Does anyone have any clues on this?
I imagine that some of you (for family or personal reasons)
also have cohabiting linuxOS and wind98.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
