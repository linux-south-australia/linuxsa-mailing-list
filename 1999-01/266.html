 &gt; I haven't been following this thread (unfortunately), but I should add
 &gt; that I use internal modems wherever possible , always have. They are

 &gt; Taiwanese models work best and stay away from Dynalink (incompatable
 &gt; command set).

Incompatible with what?

 &gt; They have the distinct advantage of not having a switch that
 &gt; can be turned off.

That's an advantage?!  The fact that you can't reboot a computer without
dropping your net link sucks donkeys' balls if you have a permanent link.

Added to that:

  * the "cheap Taiwanese models" usually have cheap Taiwanese custom
    silicon blobs on them which claim to be 16450 or 16550 UARTs, but
    which don't quite work like real 16[45]50's, so you end up with
    stupid "this doesn't work right"-style bugs when you try to treat
    them like a normal serial port like god intended.

  * they don't have indicator lights (which makes protocol debugging
    unnecessarily complicated).

  * an ongoing problem which lots of internal modems have had since
    the inception of the idea is that you actually have to power them
    off to reset them if you expect them to work after a reboot.  Why?
    Crap design.  Every other card you put in your machine resets at
    boot time, so why should your internal modem be any different?

  * If you think they're broken you are forced to go to the extent
    of opening your PC's case and stressing-out the bus connectors
    to change them over.  If you want to crack your motherboard,
    try a cheap Taiwanese internal modem.

But, as Steve said, they cost $15 less so they must be good, right?

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
