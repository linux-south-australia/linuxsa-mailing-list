&gt; Can anybody tell me what the command is to shut down Xwindows from an
&gt; xterm. I know that you can shut down X with CTRL-ALT-Backspace but all my
&gt; Linux guides tell me that this method does not shut down the X session
&gt; cleanly. I'm having problems with the AfterStep start menu and don't
&gt; always have access to the quit menu option

Depending on how you are starting X up you it will be in one of a number
of files.  

You can (usually) have X running under xdm (run level 5) or through startx.

Either way the system will run a script that will run a number of programs.
The trick is that when the script finishes the X environment will shutdown.
So in the script there will be one program which either 'execs' an 
application or a program that runs without being backgrounded.

The file will usually be one of the following...
	.Xclients
	.xsession
	.xinitrc

The first two are usually the ones that are run for xdm the last is through
xinit. 

So by looking through these files (or alternatively looking through manpages,
scripts and such) you should find one that matches your setup ('ps -fax' is
sometimes useful.

You will usually find something like the following (for gnome on my system).

background-properties --init &
keyboard-properties --init &
mouse-properties --init &
panel

Which means that the -properties programs will run in the background the
panel will run without backgrounding.  Hence when I exit panel (through 
logout) the X environment will shutdown.

The other tried and true method is to shutdown all applications until you
have only the window manager to exit.  You should find that exiting something
including the window manager will cause the X environment to exit.  

Chances are you will have the X environent exit when either the window manager
or a particular xterm exits.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Matt
