 &gt; Why should it be impressive to know that

Of course, you're right.  It's about as impressive as some blow-hard
who waited until the yanks noticed before making loud noises about
how nobody does anything 'til the yanks notice.

Maybe you didn't see anyone doing anything because we were all following
your stirling example.

 &gt; What can we learn from this story?

When 0.001% of the people in a country with twenty times our population 
make noise about something they tend to produce more decibels than the
same percentage here?

slashdot has a six-month backlog on submissions?

The Silicon Valley press cares, whereas the Australian press doesn't
give enough of a damn to understand the issue?

Entropy increases?

Posting content-free grammar to a (mostly) technical mailing list
gets you flamed?

I won't bother coming up with any lessons.  I'm sure you're about to
tell us all about what we've learned so there isn't really any point.
