&gt; Steve,

&gt; Thanks for that.
&gt;
&gt; I'm talking about the script-in-the-/etc/rc* method as being
&gt; unreliable in the sense that it _could_ fail.
&gt; All things can fail, of course.
&gt; And I didn't want the "ppp" connection to go ahead if it does fail.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From the first two replies to my query, it looks like there _is_
&gt; no "init" or "conf" file of the sort that I'm looking for.
&gt;
&gt; So probably the best idea is what you suggest -- write a
&gt; cleverer script-in-/etc/rc* which will check out all the
&gt; return values of the "ipfwadm" invocations, and then
&gt; somehow prevent "ppp" from booting until the
&gt; firewall is in place.
&gt;
&gt; This must be a common problem, though, because there is a provision
&gt; to make "ppp" pop pack on boot-up, which is obviously very useful.
&gt; And I had hoped there would be some way of expressing the
&gt; _dependence_ of the ppp invocation on the _success_ of the
&gt; ipfw configuration.
&gt;
&gt; This is something which, if addressed, could add reliability to
&gt; a potential weak point of linux security.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt; PS.  In the 6-7 weeks since I started up my site, I've had
&gt; two significant attacks on my site.
&gt; The first was an attempt to remotely mount one of my
&gt; unprotected NFS exports (I've remedied that oversight now).
&gt; That failed.
&gt; The second was reported to me by someone in the US who said
&gt; they found someone doing attacks on a hit list which
&gt; included me. They said something about "portscan" and
&gt; attacking my "named". I think that failed too.
&gt; This indicates that I should expect an average of one
&gt; attack every 3 weeks!!!!!

Have i missed something?

If ipfwadm fails the main suffers are the users behind the firewall.
192.168.n.n addresses can't be accessed from the outside world. The
purpose of ipfwadm is to give the inside users access to the outside world
not the other way around. Tunnelling is used the other way.

At any rate I 've been running the setup from rc.d/rc.local for 8 months
now without incident and I do know the line drops a few times a day.
S......... Telstra phone lines. The server doesn't reboot too often though
;-)
