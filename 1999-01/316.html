Heyas All,

Since my last post, I have got the mouse to work, by not running GPM on
start-up, and I have got the network running, by recompiling the kernel with
support for the PCI NE2000 built into the kernel Works perfectly. I have
even got ICQ running under Linux. There's just a couple of other things...

First of all, sound. It isn't set up. I compiled support into the kernel for
it (its a SB Vibra16). Is there something else I need to do to get it to
work? Under RH I just used the sound configuration program. But I can't get
it the card work under Slackware. Although, I'll admit I don't know much
about it...

Also, a couple of requests for recommendations. I am currently using Outlook
Express for my email, because I like the 3 pane view with the folders,
message headers and a message preview. As well as the filtering and multiple
POP3 account support. Is there any program similar to that for Linux? Those
three items are really my only requirements. The 3 pane view, decent
filtering and multiple account support. Anyone recommend an email client
that will do those?

Also, I am in need with a word processing, spreadsheet, database, type
program. One that will import MSOffice 97 files as that is what the
University is using, and MSWorks 4 files as that is what my parents use.
What programs are decent?

After I get all the above things worked out / installed, I should be able to
take the plunge and do a 'deltree c:\windows' ... maybe... I will certainly
be able to almost forget Windows is on the machine...

Oh, yea, there is one other thing before I go. How do you add items to the
"start" menu in X. In the fvwm95 window manager? (Did I spell that right??)

Cheers, and TIA
Dazz
