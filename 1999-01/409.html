&gt; Does the retailer have no comeback -at all-, considering the end user
&gt; agreed to the price of the computer -including- the software?

What stops the retailer refunding you a pittance?  After all, neither
of you have agreed on the value of the software which was bundled despite
that you didn't want it.  If the retail offers you $10 for it, what can
you do?

I'll tell you what you can do: You can claim it's not a genuine refund
because it cost the retailer more than that.  Truth is, I'm not sure
what an OEM edition of Win9x costs the retailer, probably it's about
$100, maybe as low as $50.  So if the retailer offers you that sort of
amount then you have little (legal) cause for complaint.  The retailer,
too, has little reason to complain.  The retailer has to buy the OEM
licence (in bulk), but nothing stops him or her from bundling the media
which you returned with the next system he or she sells.
