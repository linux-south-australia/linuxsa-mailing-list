Linuxarians everywhere, I found this small article in, of all places, Win NT
Magazine's mailling list Update.  Sound Familiar?!


* WINDOWS REFUND CENTER OPENS ON THE WEB
The Microsoft End User License Agreement (EULA) that arrives with 
computers preloaded with the Windows OS contains a statement that if 
you don't agree with the EULA, you can't use the software, and you can 
return the media for a refund. One user who loaded another OS on his 
new computer tried to get the manufacturer (Toshiba) to honor the 
agreement. However, throughout months of correspondence, this user 
consistently ran into the manufacturer's complaint that Microsoft 
wouldn't reimburse the manufacturer. In the end, the manufacturer sent 
him a refund.
  He shared his tale with others via email messages, and those users 
forwarded his messages to many other recipients who used a variety of 
OSs (excluding Windows). As a result of his story, LinuxMall is hosting 
a Web site to help users of OSs other than Windows understand the EULA 
and get their refunds. To qualify, the first boot of the new computer 
must be into the alternative OS installation program via disk. The hard 
disk, preloaded with Windows, can't ever boot.
