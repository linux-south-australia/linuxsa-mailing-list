Woooah!!

This is almost religious territory here.

&gt; What is all the anti  hoo haa about html encoded email

It comes down to a number of things.  These are my thoughts and I am sure
that others will have extra comments to make.

A couple of points about HTML encoded mail...

	A good portion of the list (unfounded but a gut feeling) would
		prefer plain text.
	Text email can convey the same message, without the extra cruft.  It
		is simplistic, offers greatest compatibility, etc.  When people
		'pretty' up the email through HTML markup the html version
		can grow to be pretty unwieldy.
	Most mailers can be told that for some recepients 
		(<A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au">linuxsa@linuxsa.org.au</A>) you can send only plain text message.
	The duplication of content (see below) seems to be a bit excessive.
	HTML email tends to be larger than it's plain text equivalent (with very
		little extra content).
	Plain text email can't have VBScript or JavaScript content and can't 
		force your reader to pull down Java or images.  Yes people,
		thanks to HTML email, the 'Good Times' virus of yesteryear is
		just that little bit closer.

All in all I prefer that I receive email in plain text.  This is mainly due to
me using a lightweight text based mailer, and it is at it's quickest when it is
working with plain text.  Attachments add a bit of complexity that makes scanning
email very easy.

But then again these are my views and others will have theirs :)

&gt; secondly why would anyone bother doing this anyway?

Using mail clients like netscape or ie, people can create 'rich' email
that allows a 'nicely' rendered version of the email to be viewed.  To
allow people to see the email in the simplest form they have a text 
version.

The mailer uses mime to create two attachments, text/html and text/plain.
The browser automatically picks up the text/html attachment and views
that one.  Some mailers will pick up the text version, others will
display the full email.

Regards,

Matt
