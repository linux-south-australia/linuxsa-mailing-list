Hey All, 

I installed KDE a few days ago, and have been quite impressed with it. However,
there are a couple of shortcomings with parts of it, one of which is the email
program that comes with it, kmail. On first inspection it looked like what I
was after, but after using it for a few days it is somewhat lacking..

I'm really after an email client that fits the following:

- GUI (not text based)
- Multiple folders for sorting mail into
- Multiple POP account support
- filters that work on incoming mail to sort the mail
- ability to check every X minutes for new mail and show an icon on the sys
tray or pop a message up when new mail arrives
- KDE based?
- multiple signiture ability

Well, I guess that the GUI isn't vital, pine works, and I've heard that you can
get it to filter and whatever by using procmail i think... but even though i am
a console user, i'm slowly being converted to X ... especially by KDE!!

Does anyone have any suggestions on suitable email programs??

Cheers, and TIA
Dazz
