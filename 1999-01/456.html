Thought this might be germane to the discussion.

Subject:	[SLUG] Windows Refund(s)

Much discussion has taken place of late over the right to purchase a new
computer sans operating system - OK, let's be honest - without bloody
Windows !!
I've just had a conversation with the OEM department at Microsoft (having
been an OEM in Another LIfe(tm), as I have mentioned earlier), and here's
what they said;
"Microsoft has NO agreement with ANY OEM's to the effect that they 
must supply Windows with their hardware. Should a purchaser require a
machine without operating system, the OEM is under no obligation to
Microsoft to supply Windows in any form".
This will be confirmed by email in the next day or so from the OEM
department.
When pressed further regarding the enforcability of the EULA, and the
subject of a refund, said Microsofter said;
		"If you don't accept the EULA (and who really reads these
things anyway),
you are legally entitled
		to return it (the software) to the supplier (of your PC) for
a full
refund of the purchase price paid. They
		then return the software to their OEM distributor for a
refund, who
returns it to Microsoft for THEIR 
		refund"
This, apart from the "who really reads them" comment will, I believe, be
confirmed in the same email.
As soon as it's received, I'll post it here verbatim (or excerpted, to avoid
copyright problems !!)
So there you go - Dell, NEC, Toshiba, Gateway, Hardly Normal, HP, etc. MUST
give you a refund - they may not WANT to give you the refund, they may
squirm like cornered rats wuhen you insist, but legally they haven't a leg
to stand on.
Jon
P.S. I ran the EULA past a Judge I work with and he said pretty much the
same thing - apart from one comment "You mean they expect you to READ this
bullshit ??"...:-)
