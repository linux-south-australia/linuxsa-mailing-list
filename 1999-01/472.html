I had a lot of trouble with spam when I was first connected to the net,
as I had no idea and _ALWAYS_ clicked on the 'send me updates' and
filled in the email fields on websites.
	When I started to get snowed under (so to speak) with spam I started
off my trying to unsubscribe and if it failed I just started sending
_very_ strong messages to any address associated with the spam.
	This worked for me as I do not get spam now, but since spammers have
started spoofing email addresses I guess it would be much harder to get
rid of it! (In fact, It is a favorite pastime of many derros at our
school to sign up to as many services in the name of other people's
email addresses! Not very nice at all.)
	I have also found that emailing the spammer's ISP (if you can find out
who it is!) works very well. It has already been pointed out that ISP's
are fairly tough on spammers!
	It is a pity that a fantastic application of technology such as email
can have all of the fun taken out by some socially challenged individual
with bulk email software and a bit of time. What a waste!

Yet another 2c on the subject,
			Sam.

&gt; 
&gt; In my experience, clicking on 'I do not wish to get spam mail' or
&gt; similar is almost a guarantee that you WILL get spam. Similarly, when
&gt; you get an email that says at the bottom 'reply to this email including
&gt; the word UNSUBSCRIBE to be removed from this list' is also a guarantee
&gt; of receiving more spam. Both are used as email adress harvesting and
&gt; confirming devices by unscrupulous spammers. It took me a little while
&gt; to cotton on to this, but my email is much less spammy since....
