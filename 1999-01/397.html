Guys,
	Thanks for the info on this subject, I hope I don't start a flame war on
this, I haven't come across html email but I have heard heaps about it.
	I am familiar with HTML though, and have had some WEB authoring experience
which is why I was baffled as to why one would bother with HTML emails with
all the added tags and formatting would fatten the email message
unnecessarily in my opinion.

	This is one of the things I dislike about MS based computing ie. OS and
software etc is all getting bigger, fancier and more resource hungry all
the time, on the other hand computer technology is getting faster and
better so are we any better off except for more fancy features. 
	Hence my interest in Linux generally, I am not interested in seeing all
the fancy wiz bang features and bullshit (please excuse the language) that
seems to come with MS based software, they appear to be selling the gliz
and glamour but not reliability, one could ask does HTML encoding of email
really add any value to it?
	
	Email is a great medium, simple text, low band width and hence fast to
traverse the Internet or whatever network system, so is there any advantage
of increasing the bulk of the message just because we can and now have
faster Internet, network and computer speeds to do it?

	So for my 2c worth keeping the message compact and efficient has got to be
an advantage.
&lt;/rant&gt;

Regards
	Paul
