Hi Guys (Girls, Others)
    Has anyone downloaded the kernel upgrades from the Netcraft Mirror? =
I did and I am getting some wierd behavior that I don't have enough =
experience to fix. It goes like this-

    Had an operational RH5.2 Linux system. I did the right thing and =
downloaded all the rpms from Netcraft including the kernel rpms (4 of =
2.0.36-1) and installed them using glint. Had no problems or errors =
installing them and the system appeared to be working fine. Did the next =
logical step and rebooted the machine which appeared normal (at first). =
Now the problems started. ppp suddenly doesn't work. I normally cheat =
and run it from root using the control panel GUI since I am still =
configuring the system. Usually what happens is when I activate ppp the =
modem just dials. It was set up using the standard setup method in the =
RH Install Guide nothing fancy and I haven't configured anything else =
that should conflict with it, besides it worked before I upgraded the =
kernel. Now it just says 'ppp0 active' and does nothing except the TR =
light comes on on my Hayes Acurra56K Modem. It won't pick up, dial or =
anything. O.K. so I deactivated the ppp0 and tried to dial using the =
commandline method from the RH install guide using "/usr/sbin/usernetctl =
ifcfg-ppp0 up" command. Now I get a message like "ppp not supported by =
kernel" strange. Just in case I also reset my modem to factory settings =
using at&f from someone else's help message. I can dial and log on using =
Minicom so it is NOT the modem, I just can't do anything else. Made a =
few calls and find out that my current version of ppp may not be correct =
version for this version of the kernel O.K. so I will download new ppp =
rpms with my last resort "Other Operating system" mount the c: drive and =
upgrade and I should be fine. Next problem occurs "mount not supported =
by kernel" error. O.K. now what. I cannot mount the C: drive, I cannot =
mount the cdrom, and I cannot mount the floppy to either install or =
uninstall these new rpms. What do I do? At present I only have these two =
problems but I now have suspicions that there may be more. I also don't =
have enough knowledge to check what else may not work. Why would the =
kernel suddenly not support ppp and mount when I thought it came as =
standard. Also the upgrades came from an Official Red Hat Mirror so it =
isn't as if they may be suspect. All my config files should be O.K. as =
they worked perfectly before I did the upgrade, and shouldn't have been =
changed by the upgrade.

    I feel like a helpless newbee (which I am) so =
Heeeeellllllpppppp!!!!!.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.
