More about RSA's (now solved) DES III Challenge
Client programs... they may be Open Source later.

I forgot to ask if RSA chose the key by hand or
randomly (i.e. it may have some incentive to
choose a key - using knowledge of how the
team-members' keys are handed out by the
key-server - that essentially guarantees that
DES will be cracked by the Internet-wide team)

&gt;&gt; How does one know that:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1) one's computer is actually working on
&gt;&gt;     the problem in question,
&gt;
&gt;By trusting us.  We're a non-profit organization, with no real monitary
&gt;impetus to do something other than what we've stated.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) the Client will not just create hovoc on
&gt;&gt;     the innocent participant's system,
&gt;
&gt;The client runs in the idle cycles of your CPU.  The more you use your
&gt;machine, the less the client does.  You could even run it as an
&gt;unprivledge user for added security.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3) the Client will - in the event of the dis-
&gt;&gt;     covery of the solution - not (secretly)
&gt;&gt;     credit some *other* participant with
&gt;&gt;     the discovery...
&gt;
&gt;As stated above, we (d.net and all associated with the client) are
&gt;non-profit.  We cannot win any prize money individually, nor can our
&gt;family and close friends.  The leadership set by the board of directors
&gt;insures that thru a shared source code base across a group of coders, no
&gt;one is able to corrupt the integrity of the contests.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (etc.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why is the source code not Open...
&gt;&gt; and available for scrutiny and/or pos-
&gt;&gt; sible improvement (if only by sugges-
&gt;&gt; tion)?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; (As you can see, I have a foot in some
&gt;&gt; Open Source circles...  ;)
&gt;
&gt;Open source is what we're moving to, however, in our current v2 clients,
&gt;because of the legacy from which distributed.net was grown out of, we did
&gt;not make the source avaliable.  The core cracking routines are avaliable,
&gt;at <A HREF="http://www.distributed.net/cores">http://www.distributed.net/cores</A>, but the networking wrappers are
&gt;clouded mostly by obscurity.  Agreed, security by obscurity is not a
&gt;stalwart security plan, but until the v3 clients are introduced, not
&gt;releasing the network code protects us from script kiddies looking to pad
&gt;their stats.
