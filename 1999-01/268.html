&gt;  &gt; I haven't been following this thread (unfortunately), but I should add
&gt;  &gt; that I use internal modems wherever possible , always have. They are
&gt;  &gt; reliable, usually more so, and shouldn't be difficult to debug. Cheap
&gt;  &gt; Taiwanese models work best and stay away from Dynalink (incompatable
&gt;  &gt; command set).
&gt;
&gt; Incompatible with what?

The most annoying difference is ATI4 for the modem configuration instead of
AT&V, but there are others.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; They have the distinct advantage of not having a switch that
&gt;  &gt; can be turned off.
&gt;
&gt; That's an advantage?!  The fact that you can't reboot a computer without
&gt; dropping your net link sucks donkeys' balls if you have a permanent link.

I have them in 50+ shops. It's hard enough making sure the power to the shop
is left on each night. If the modems could be unplugged or switched off they
would be. This way there are out of the way (in the computer) and the staff
can't touch them.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Added to that:
&gt;
&gt;   * the "cheap Taiwanese models" usually have cheap Taiwanese custom
&gt;     silicon blobs on them which claim to be 16450 or 16550 UARTs, but
&gt;     which don't quite work like real 16[45]50's, so you end up with
&gt;     stupid "this doesn't work right"-style bugs when you try to treat
&gt;     them like a normal serial port like god intended.

Haven't had that problem yet ....

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * they don't have indicator lights (which makes protocol debugging
&gt;     unnecessarily complicated).
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;   * an ongoing problem which lots of internal modems have had since
&gt;     the inception of the idea is that you actually have to power them
&gt;     off to reset them if you expect them to work after a reboot.  Why?
&gt;     Crap design.  Every other card you put in your machine resets at
&gt;     boot time, so why should your internal modem be any different?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;   * If you think they're broken you are forced to go to the extent
&gt;     of opening your PC's case and stressing-out the bus connectors
&gt;     to change them over.  If you want to crack your motherboard,
&gt;     try a cheap Taiwanese internal modem.

Or use competent PC repair people. Oops sorry,  oxymoron.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But, as Steve said, they cost $15 less so they must be good, right?
&gt; :-)
&gt;

I just don't want the staff to touch the modem.
