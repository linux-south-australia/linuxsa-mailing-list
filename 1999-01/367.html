&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Now that GNOME and KDE are both at relatively mature release versions,
&gt; is there anyone willing to do a review or comparison of both systems on
&gt; behalf of the group? There have been a number of questions lately about
&gt; both desktops, so I suspect we have a pretty good source of info amongst
&gt; us. I for one would like to get some informed opinion, especially now
&gt; that GNOME is at 0.99 release, but I don't have the luxury at the moment
&gt; of being able to do a full install to check it out. Any takers?
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

due to all the favourable reviews, and the probs we had with
gnome/enlightenment, we decided to give kde a go:)
