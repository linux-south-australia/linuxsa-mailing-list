&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; btw, as a Microsoft Certified Professional, I'd like to say just how great I
&gt; think Linux and the linux community is, and how it generally rules over dows
&gt; in every way possible.  There truely isnt any other thing in the world that
&gt; you can just ask for help, and receive it so willingly.

And we don't need pieces of paper to say that we can help :).

&gt; &gt;From this, I figured that XF86Config must have been hurt somehow, so I went
&gt; and had a look at it, but everything in it seems fine to my eyes (admittedly
&gt; these eyes wouldn't be able to spot a really tough error).
&gt; 
&gt; This is going to make for an insanely big email, and I'm sorry about that, I
&gt; just didnt want to miss out any info which may be relevant to the problem
&gt; :)

If people can create a web page on their ISP it makes a whole lot more sense.

Netcraft, who hosts this list gratis, have to carry a lot of volume.
With list membership at about 350, a 26k email could potentially generate
outgoing traffic of about 9 MB.  (Although some reduction is volume would
be done through batching and such).  If you can cut the excess out it is
always appreciated.

&gt; Oh, btw, I ran SuperProbe, and the results are at the very end of the email.

Time to dig into the the output.

&gt;   SVGA: server for SVGA graphics adaptors (Patchlevel 0):
&gt;       NV1, STG2000, RIVA128, ET4000, ET4000W32, ET4000W32i,
&gt;       ET4000W32i_rev_b, ET4000W32i_rev_c, ET4000W32p, ET4000W32p_rev_a,
&gt;       ET4000W32p_rev_b, ET4000W32p_rev_c, ET4000W32p_rev_d, ET6000, ET6100,

Okay, so the SVGA server is what is X is linked to.

&gt; You must provide a "Screen" section in XF86Config for at
&gt; least one of the following graphics drivers: svga

Big hint here...

&gt; _X11TransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't connect: errno = 111
&gt; giving up.

No X, no socket :)

&gt; Section "Screen"
&gt;     Driver      "accel"
&gt;     Device      "asdf"
&gt;     Monitor     "Viewsonic P775"

Hmm, SVGA looks for svga driver, accel is the only one.

&gt; First video: Super-VGA
&gt;         Chipset: Tseng ET4000/W32 (Port Probed)
&gt;         Memory:  1024 Kbytes

And yep, the SVGA driver supports the ET4000.   

Now if you copy the accel section and change it to svga, things 
should work.  Make sure that you aim at 1024x768x8bpp or 800x600x16bpp.
Run Xconfigurator or similar to make sure you get things right.

But the question still remains as to why the config got changed.

Hmmm.

Matt
