Just on the subject still, I went to that link in the spam that a few
people received...
Supposedly there was meant to be a legal bill saying that spam email was
legal.
However, the link was broken, but I cut the end off and loaded the index
of that user. Interesting, the murkowski guy is actually an anti-spam
campaigner, who has successfully passed an  anti-spam bill in (US)
parliament!

I sent the guy a letter explaining that his name was being used to
justify millions of spam emails around the world, but I reckon all of
you who received that email with that link in it, should forward it to
him, so that if nothing else, he can see where it came from and maybe
throw some real legal weight against it.

Remember to view the full headers, before forwarding spam, so that
people can see where it _really_ originated.

Thanks,
Toby
