Sorry if I'm a bit late with this post, but I actually sent it
yesterday with a typo in the email-addr (Doh!) ;-)

&gt;PS.  In the 6-7 weeks since I started up my site, I've had

&gt;That failed.
&gt;The second was reported to me by someone in the US who said
&gt;they found someone doing attacks on a hit list which
&gt;included me. They said something about "portscan" and
&gt;attacking my "named". I think that failed too.
&gt;This indicates that I should expect an average of one
&gt;attack every 3 weeks!!!!!

That's a pretty mellow average for us,
we get anywhere from one every 3 days to 3 in the same day ;-)
(mainly on our ISP mailserver and nameserver)

They're always the same thing too, "portscan" or "mscan" 
(mscan is a portscan derivitave with a phf-attack for your
webserver included). We have pretty much any port blocked that 
isn't essential to the server now, so it rarely causes a drama.
(There are the odd 'netbus' attempts too, hehehe)

"mscan" seems to be the prefered tool these days. It has a
default list of ports to scan/DoS-attack:

domain, telnet, finger, 143(imap), pop3, sunrpc, 
and of course three hits to "/cgi-bin/phf*" on your port 80 
(which any _reasonably_ recent release of Apache has a contingency for
anyway, just check the bottom of access.conf or srm.conf to enable it)

*But it can be customised to run any list of ports supplied*

&gt;The second was reported to me by someone in the US who said

&gt;included me.

Yes, there are such hit-lists around (and it seems you always end up 
on more of them whenever you catch/suspend a warezdude/cracker user ;-P)
I think they can also do really stupid wildcard IPs too (eg: 203.*.*.*).
