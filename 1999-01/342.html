&gt; Heyas All,
&gt; 
&gt; Since my last post, I have got the mouse to work, by not running GPM on
&gt; start-up, and I have got the network running, by recompiling the kernel with
&gt; support for the PCI NE2000 built into the kernel Works perfectly. I have
&gt; even got ICQ running under Linux. There's just a couple of other things...
&gt; 
&gt; First of all, sound. It isn't set up. I compiled support into the kernel for
&gt; it (its a SB Vibra16). Is there something else I need to do to get it to
&gt; work? Under RH I just used the sound configuration program. But I can't get
&gt; it the card work under Slackware. Although, I'll admit I don't know much
&gt; about it...
make sure your io/irq/dma stuff is set properly when you compile the
kernel. Oh, and look at your boot messages with dmesg | more. It should
say something about the soundcard.

 &gt; 
&gt; Also, a couple of requests for recommendations. I am currently using Outlook
&gt; Express for my email, because I like the 3 pane view with the folders,
&gt; message headers and a message preview. As well as the filtering and multiple
&gt; POP3 account support. Is there any program similar to that for Linux? Those
&gt; three items are really my only requirements. The 3 pane view, decent
&gt; filtering and multiple account support. Anyone recommend an email client
&gt; that will do those?
Balsa is a nice gtk based email client, and as for filtering and multiple
accounts, if balsa wont handle it, procmail will.

&gt; 
&gt; Also, I am in need with a word processing, spreadsheet, database, type
&gt; program. One that will import MSOffice 97 files as that is what the
&gt; University is using, and MSWorks 4 files as that is what my parents use.
&gt; What programs are decent?
StarOffice will handle MSOrifice 97 files - just. Forget about really
advanced tables etc. Not sure what wordperfect can handle..

&gt; 
&gt; After I get all the above things worked out / installed, I should be able to
&gt; take the plunge and do a 'deltree c:\windows' ... maybe... I will certainly
&gt; be able to almost forget Windows is on the machine...
I'll prolly do that when they port Half-Life to Linux. Until then,
though...

&gt; 
&gt; Oh, yea, there is one other thing before I go. How do you add items to the
&gt; "start" menu in X. In the fvwm95 window manager? (Did I spell that right??)
nfi, sorry
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers, and TIA
&gt; Dazz
&gt; 

Michael.
