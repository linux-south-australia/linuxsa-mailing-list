Hi Simon,
My understanding of using FIPS is that you need to load it on your own
boot/rescue disk that you hopefully created when you installed Win 95.  I may
be wrong but I dont think you can use someone elses rescue disk and to use
FIPS you need to boot with the rescue disk and then use FIPS which you have
copied onto it.
If you need more info the Linux Pocketbook has excellent instructions, if you
don't have access write me I'm happy to help.
Hope this is useful, Gordon

&gt; heyas
&gt; can anyone help me out here? I've been trying to use FIPS on my hard drive
&gt; to split it into 2 partions (one for windows, one for linux). I've been
&gt; running win95 and I've defragmented the hard drive but when I try to use
&gt; fips to split up the partion, when it gets to "checking FAT.." the machine
&gt; just hangs. I know for a fact that the version of fips I have supports
&gt; FAT32, and it works fine on a friends computer when he split up his HDD.
&gt; I've tried running it from a boot disk, from dos, from win95 etc. when it
&gt; hangs num lock, caps etc still works, and when I've tried it thru win95,
&gt; I've been able to give the 3-finger salute and shut it down that way.
&gt;
&gt; does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this problem? I don't want to
&gt; have to back up my entire HDD and completely reformat it....
