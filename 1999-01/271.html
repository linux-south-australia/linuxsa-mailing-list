&gt; Hi my name is Matthew Mills and am just new to this list so please bear
&gt; with me.  I am wanting to start working with this great operating system.
&gt; I have just bought a copy of Linux Redhat 5.2 and am looking at installing
&gt; it this weekend but I have run into what I believe could be a problem in
&gt; that I have an older 486 dx2 66 which does not support drives greater than
&gt; 502mb.  I have 2 x 2.1Gb drives and am using Quantum disk manager to
&gt; install a software LBA so that my system can see the full capacity of these
&gt; drives.  I have $indows 95 using Fat32 on the first HDD and am wanting to
&gt; install Linux on the second HDD which is totally empty.  I have System
&gt; Commander 4 that I could load if that helps.  Is there any easy way for me
&gt; to get this installation started?  Is it straight forward?

I was in the same boat with my 486 3 years ago with my 1.2GB seagate hdd.
Anyway I thought what the heck lets try the install anyway. It worked fine.

It's only now that I can explain it.
When you boot your pc it looks at head 0 track 0 at this point it finds the
Software lba driver.
This then loads and tells the drive to look at head 0, track 0 but because its
now lba this is 63 sectors difference. Hence it will find dos/lilo/system
commander - what ever you put there.

So you should have no problem. Still that was my experiance so I recommed
backing up ontrack & your mbr.

Note: did everyone running lba realize about the secret/unused 63 sectors -
makes a great place to store your name/address. Great as you can prove it's
yours if stolen.  A low level format won't touch it if it's set to lba,
neither will a normal format. So most ppl won't normally get rid of it!
