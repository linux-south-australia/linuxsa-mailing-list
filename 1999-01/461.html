Daniel,

===========================================================
&gt; IMOHO, Linux is fairly resilient to these annoying little buggers
&gt; with their adolescent cyber-destructive tendancies, and provided you 
&gt; a) keep up to date with what they are using on you (progs,utils,exploits)
&gt; b) close ALL non-essential ports/services
&gt; c) scan your syslog regularly
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps those who didn't already know this stuff,
&gt; (I realise that most ISP sysadmins already do ;-)
===========================================================

1.	What _are_ the non-essential ports?
	Do you have a sample set of ipfwadm commands to
	close down these non-essentail ports?
	I don't really want to sit down for a few hours
	going through the ports one by one to see if
	they're essential.

2.	I think in future, there may be an increasing number
	of people who, like me, make the leap from being an
	appendange to an ISP to getting their own
	direct connection to the wide-open net, without an
	intervening ISP to protect them.
	For those people, it may not be possible to spend the
	required time acquiring all of the knowledge to
	protect their system.
	It would be great if there was some place you could
	get info on what to do to protect a machine.
	I guess this is part of what sysadmins are hired
	for, and therefore represents trade knowhow.
	A HOWTO-file would always be out-of-date, I imagine.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
