Daryl et al:

&gt; As long as I can remember, flush (-F) has _never_ reset the policy.
&gt; In all my ipchain scripts, I've always set the policy manually
&gt; before/after/during the flush.

I've now concluded that you are correct. After four or five times
reading of "Linux Firewalls" by Robert Ziegler and the man pages,
ipchains -F should dump the rules not the policies....in my defenese
Ziegler didn't state that he had assumed you had REBOOTED your computer
before the ipchains -F which would of course cause the default ACCEPT
policies to appear.

&gt; &gt;  - I had allowed a syn connection out to any web server
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious; why not allow outbound connections to any port?

Well, I was working on getting HTTP working. So I had been specifically
talking about port 80. Once I was satisfied that HTTP/DNS were
functioning correctly I would have progressively started allowing other
things.

&gt; &gt;   ipchains -A output -p tcp -i ppp+ -s ${MYIP} ${UNPRIVPORTS} -d any/0
&gt; &gt; 80 -j ACCEPT
&gt; 
&gt; Where is your "-y" (if this is the rule matching the above description)?

The book I mentioned doesn't have it. I think it should and I don't
think it would break things if I added it. The rule that I mentioned is
probably a little too lenient (read less secure) than with a -y...but
less secure, in this sense, means that it is easier for a client to
access the web (i.e., less hurdles or less flags to get wrong).

&gt; What is UNPRIVPORTS set to?

1025:65525 - the "non priviliged" ports.

&gt; &gt;   --&gt; ipchains -A forward -i ppp+ -s ${LAN_ADDRESS_IN_CIDR} -j MASQ
&gt; 
&gt; I think putting an interface on a forwarding rule may be bogus,
&gt; especially as the packets to be masqueraded are more likely to
&gt; be hitting your NIC, no?

Well, I've tried eth+ and removing the interface. Behaviour I've noticed
is:

SETUP:
the LAN
the FIREWALL (eth0 is to LAN, ppp0 is to internet)

- specify the interface as eth0 and forwarding/masquerading doesn't work
- specify the interface as ppp0 and forwarding/masquerading do work
(provided one of your other firewall rules on the input/output/user
specified chains don't deny or reject it)

I guess that one doesn't need to specify the interface. But I have on
other systems I've set up and it's worked (the forward chain seems to
think the -i is the interface to send the packets TO if it decides to
forward them....so, essentially that says if you see anything from the
local LAN that can be routed to the Internet/ppp+ [i.e. doesn't fall
foul of an input/output firewall rule] then masquerade it and send the
packet out over ppp-).

&gt; &gt; * the other machines on the network - Windows 9X machines - that could
&gt; &gt; ping the localhost (firewall) machine, couldn't speak to the outside web
&gt; &gt; servers but seemed to be able to resolve domain names
&gt; 
&gt; Haven't seen all your rules, so I can't comment.

That's fair enough. In the end I decided enough was enough, I have set
up a firewall on my own machine that I *know* works and have offered to
sit my own machine as the router. I am still suspicious of the hardware
that they are using. At least if I start with a machine and firewall
rule set that WORKS, I'll have a better chance of working out what has
killed these services.

&gt; &gt; I'd be inclined to say Linux is broken...at least the -F flag doesn't
&gt; &gt; work as documented....any ideas on this?
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to see where you thought that behaviour was documented.

As noted above I had misread the documentation.
