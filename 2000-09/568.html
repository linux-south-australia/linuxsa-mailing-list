   &gt;&gt; Unless Unix is better at dividing by zero than NT,
   &gt;
   &gt;Unix can trap it; I don't know what NT does.

Well of course NT can trap run-time errors, error trapping is
essentially a language function.  My point was that producing an
unhandled divide by zero error, regardless of the platform is going to
make your application cease to execute.  This is essentially a
brain-dead programming problem, but because Win32 (IMHO) is such a more
accessible platform for beginners, the incidence of this these errors is
higher.

It is this (again IMHO), combined with the differences in design between
Unix and NT that causes NT to loose out in the stability stakes.  Where
3rd party device driver authors have to write code that has the
potential to halt execution on the target machine is obviously wrong.

It is brain-dead programmer errors being amplified by poor design.

   &gt;Like attracting like?  How come MTA's under NT tend to suck more
that
   &gt;their Unix counterparts?

It starts to become a bit of a religious war from here on in, but it is
interesting how some applications seemed to have really come into their
element on one platform, like:
Commodity protocols on Unix (MTA's etc.)
Graphic Design on Mac
3d gaming under 98 (directX & openGL).

When it comes to MTA's there is fairly heavy criticism of Exchange's
IMC, but it would be interesting to hear from say, Lotus Notes people
running on NT.  Rarely do I hear anything bad about Notes.

I also haven't heard anything bad about Apache for NT either, in fact I
hear that it is giving IIS a real run for its money on its own turf.

And of course BIND for NT is great.

I can't help but come back to coding quality==performance quality, and
urge people to try and keep application performance and OS performance
separate in their minds.

But since this is a Linux list, I will be quiet now and go back to Lurk
mode :)

Jamz.
