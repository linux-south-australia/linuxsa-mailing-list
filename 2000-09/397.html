Richard,

Even without buffer overflow, it seems like any user on any
linux box can "get root" whenever they feel like it,
with this script:

<A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/suse/6.2/rootcron.sh">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/suse/6.2/rootcron.sh</A>

Well, it seems that SuSE 6.4 doesn't have this precise
vulnerability, but it does have the pre-2.2.16
get-root vulnerability related to "capabilities".
There's a 10-line script to get root on SuSE 6.4

This:

<A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/index.html">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/index.html</A>

is an awesome encyclopeida of scripts to invade any
linux operating system - even BSD, solaris etc. etc.

The script which was used against me is the rootcron.sh
script. It is astonishingly simple.
Just create a crontab line to invoke sendmail to run
a sendmail script which gives the user a root shell.
It matches precisely what was done in my system.

I could draw the conclusion that there is no point in
putting a root password on any linux OS older than about
a year ago.
And for SuSE 6.4, there's this:

<A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/suse/6.4/gpm-root.sh">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/suse/6.4/gpm-root.sh</A>

which is the 10-line capabilities-exploiting script
alluded to above.

Would anyone like to try a bunch of these scripts for
their system to see if they work?

Conclusion:
Everyone should disable "cron".

In fact, we should all turn off _all_ services.
And remember tempest - they can read your monitor
through the living-room wall.

Hmmph!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
