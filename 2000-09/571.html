 &gt; Can someone quickly tell me the meaning of the load average as reported
 &gt; by top and the /proc/loadavg directoy? Specifically:
 
The load average is the average size of the run queue, i.e., the queue
of processes which are ready to run, but waiting for CPU time.

It'll include processes which have been context-switched out.  It won't
include processes which are doing I/O (terminals, network, X-windows, 
whatever) because they aren't "ready to run" until the I/O is complete.
I can't remember if it includes processes which are paging;  I seem to
recall some hack to let them do paging I/O without the overhead of 
disappearing from the run queue, so they might be in the list.

 &gt; * it appears to be "normalised"
 &gt; But to what? I would "guess" that it is 0 through to 1, and a load
 &gt; average of 1 represents a lot of load

No, load average of 1 represents somewhere near 100% CPU utilization 
(because there is, on average, one process in the run queue!), but that
isn't a high load.  

SGI recommends speccing your system so that your normal operating load
average is less than 5 * NCPUs, but SGI wants to sell more CPUs so perhaps
that's a bit conservative.  I usually consider 10 to be a high value,
5 - 10 to be kinda busy, and anything less than that to be background
radiation.

[ although I've recently bought a P866 with an Adaptec 29160 Ultra160
SCSI adapter, and have never seen the load average get past 2, so
perhaps background radiation should be 1 - 2 these days :-)
 
 &gt; * what is the significance of an "oddly" high load average if it occurs?

Your system will be busy, probably with a reasonably high number of 
context switches.
