There do seem to be a few open source-related jobs around. I've scored one
myself quite recently :-) And Tellurian is still looking for staff.

This is to let you know that in about two months' time we expect there to
be another screening exam at Tellurian. Entrance to the exam is by
invitation only. If you would like an invitation, please let me know.

I wish there was a better word than "exam". It is not an exercise in
intimidation, and it is not a "x% pass/fail" regime, nor is it meant to
require skills in exam-sitting technique. University exams tend to be all
three. Maybe that is why we don't have any mandatory requirements relating
to University exams, although of course we always take account of
hard-earned University credits.

The idea is to find out in a semi-formal environment how much someone
potentially knows about a range of topics. Does the candidate know where
to start in solving a problem? Are they thinking logically? We will post
more information about these exams when we get nearer the time.

Regards,
