&gt;Next week I'll hopefully be giving my friend his first taste of
&gt;linux.  However, he has a USB Intellimouse - which I would like to be able
&gt;to get working.  I have heard mentioned a patch for 2.2.x kernels which
&gt;enabled USB mouse support - would anyone know of a URL for this?  I would
&gt;also be very glad to hear any experiences setting up a USB mouse with
&gt;linux.

I have a USB Intellimouse Explorer, I got an adapter which switches it over 
to PS/2 it came with the mouse it is green in colour, your friend should 
have one of these with his Intellimouse. I tried to use my Intellimouse 
Explorer in Linux (my bios has leagacy support for usb mouse, so I don't 
need any drivers for it, it works in dos without drivers. However in Linux I 
had problems it stayed in the top corner and wouldnt move properly around. 
However plugging in the PS/2 adapter it worked fine after a reboot. So If 
you manage to get it working with USB well done. If you don't try reverting 
to PS/2. I am still a newbie with Linux so I don't know if it is possible to 
use the Intellimouse Explorer properly with Linux. BTW I was using Red Hat 
6.2

Regards,

Michael
