&gt; I would like to ask you all what MTA you use.

Flamebait material, but I'll answer nonetheless :-).

The "Top 4" MTAs under Unix would be (in no particular order):

1) Sendmail
2) Postfix
3) Exim
4) Qmail

Sendmail is, well, Sendmail.  It puts the "U" in ubqiuitous (and
sometimes the "F" right next to the "U" as well).  It's the one
I primarily use, but mainly because I need to support a fair number
of other systems that do.  For good _and_ bad, it's very configurable
(Turing machine on acid)(I had to do some envelope recipient rewriting
with it recently, with lookups done against a database for certain
domains, and it was actually straightforward for me to customise the
.cf file, which scares me).  Used to have a lot of exploits racked up
against it, but they've tightened up the code quite a lot since then,
and everything from 8.9.3 onwards has seemed to be pretty secure.

Best quote regarding Sendmail: "If they charged that Morris guy
(author of Internet Worm ~10 years ago ) for wasting sysadmins'
time, how come the author of Sendmail is still free?"

Postfix I haven't touched since it name changed from vmailer.  It's
written by the same chap who wrote tcpd (tcp wrappers), and apart
from a minor exploit published in BugTraq (and a major bunfight
between him and the author of Qmailer), I've not heard much since.
Given the nature of the author, I'd suspect the code base would
be quite stable and secure.

Qmail - more famous because of its author, who spoils for fights.  :-)
I won't say his name out loud, as he frequently does a "Kibo" and
greps for his name in newsgroups, lists, etc.  I'm in two minds
about Qmail; while the author is passionate about Unix security
(Qmail actually uses 5 separate user IDs for the MTA, to wall
off subsystems from each other), his code documentation kinda
sucks (very little comments, single letter identifiers), so for
people to learn from the code, it doesn't rate well.  The author
also writes other security related software which is worth
checking out: <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/">http://cr.yp.to/</A> .  I don't mind Qmail, but if you
want to do something "out of the ordinary", you may have to cut
your own code.

Exim is the one I've had zero experience with, but, lucky for you,
there is someone on the list who is quite familiar with it (waves
in Tellurian's direction).


Out of all of these, I've only used sendmail and qmail in a large
volume environment.  Qmail is quick, but can have scaling problems
with large queues which can be solved with a recompile (Sendmail
8.9.3 has these too, but later versions "apparently" have fixed
this).  Qmail is apparently used on the outbound leg of one of
the email portals (Hotmail, from memory, which must really stick
in the throat of Microsoft).
