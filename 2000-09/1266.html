&gt; could I suggest that this type of discussion take place on the linux-aus
&gt; list?

I nominate Richard as LinuxSA representative on linux-aus list.  Assuming
that most of us aren't subscribed to the list, I think it makes sense for
one person who is to represent the views and ideas of this list, and also
to keep us informed of events on that list.

I don't think we need to.  I'd like to see the talks nationally broadcast,
and using linux where possible for the enabling technology.  We could try
to spread the people around the country, so that everybody gets a chance
to fondle someone famous.  I currently lean towards liking a national day.
It underscores that geography is not relevant.  It might help if you think
of this as one installfest held in half a dozen different rooms.
