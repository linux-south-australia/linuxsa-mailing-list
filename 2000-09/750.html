Subject: Linux LAN Party



Why don't we have a Linux LAN party at some stage? It's just dawned on
me that I've downloaded in excess of 350MB of data [David Newall must
*love* me....shudder] over the past few weeks and that we must, as a
group, have a good deal of downloaded stuff that would be easier to get
over a LAN than the Internet....

Such an event could include:

* some talks
* free sponsorship - is the West End Brewery LISTENING?
* a high speed link to another mirror site such as aarnet, or for that
matter the Internet

It could feature things such as:

* register what programs you want to get BEFORE the event
* someone gets it
* someone builds it
* optimise it
* make an RPM of it or dpkg (debian) of it

I'd be willing to do that; I plan to hack the Mozilla builder to put in
some reasonable optimisations because gcc, without a march option,
builds to the lowest spec and I don't particularly want to pay $2000 for
a 650MHZ i386...:-P

I think this event could be timetabled immediately (like next day) after
the Security Fest [1]. That would let everyone do the final touches on
their FTP servers to stop us "norti" LinuxSA'ers from also ftp'ing
passwords and other sensitive info :-) I have known a number of people
who have these things going for mainly Windows and porn (yes, porn)
exchanges...why can't we join in the fun....?

The Security Fest _is_ happening; I have spoken with Richard Sharpe
(with whom I work) and he believes there is enough interest to support
at least a one day event. Nonetheless, he believes - and I concur - that
it will be much easier to start organising after the Olympics....
