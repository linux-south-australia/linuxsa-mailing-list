Thought you guys might appreciate this.



&gt; 
&gt; A man walked in a pet shop and said to the shopkeeper, "I'll have a
&gt; C monkey please."
&gt; The shopkeeper nodded, went over to a cage at the side of the shop and
&gt; took out a monkey.
&gt; He fitted a collar and leash, handed it to the customer, saying,
&gt; "That'll be $5000."
&gt; The customer paid and walked out with his monkey.
&gt; Startled, the tourist went over to the shopkeeper and said, "That was
&gt; a very expensive monkey. They usually cost only a few hundred dollars.
&gt; Why did this one cost so much?"
&gt; The shopkeeper answered, Ah, that monkey can program in C - very fast,
&gt; tight code, no bugs, well worth the money."
&gt; The tourist looked at the monkey in another cage.
&gt; "That one's even more expensive! $10,000! What does it do?"
&gt; "Oh, that one's a C++ monkey; it can manage object-oriented
&gt; programming, Visual C++, even some Java. All the really useful stuff,"
&gt; said the shopkeeper.
&gt; The tourist looked around for a little longer and saw a third monkey
&gt; in a cage of its own.
&gt; The price tag around its neck read $50,000. He gasped to the
&gt; shopkeeper, "That one costs more than all the other put together!
&gt; What on earth does it do?"
&gt; The shopkeeper replied, "Well, I haven't actually seen it do anything,
&gt; but it says it's a project manager."
