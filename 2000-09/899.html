David,

Now that suggests something.....
Why not have a set of informal linuxSA howtos?
If it could be automated (using "scp" etc.?),
perhaps a web site such as linuxsa.org.au could be
used as a repository of linuxSA HOWTO documents.
Not just seminar notes, but whenever there has been
a hot topic in the mailing list (or otherwise),
one or more people could summarise the results
in a quick ascii or html file for posterity.

I know this does sound like work.
But whoever writes this kind of thing would 
possibly learn something extra as they go.
I'm also aware of a few repositories for
such howto sets in the linux world.
But given the quality of some of the HOWTO
documents that I've seen, I don't think a new
linuxSA set would be at all superfluous.

I rather like the example of Case Western Reserve University,
which has always had a very active group of computing
people who create resources for the computing world in general.
I don't think there's any particular impediment in our
longitude and latitude which make it impossible to achieve
excellence here.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
