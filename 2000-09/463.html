Hi All,

Many people have been curious as to why I mentioned swap should not be put
onto a software raid drive at the moment. This is discussed below. Plese
note I am not implying that hardware raid is unsafe, just the software
version which exists which the Linux Kernel when one is swapping to
it. This claim is as a result of monitoring the linux-raid mailing list
and does contrudict the howto, but hey, you teach what you read.

The mailing list archive can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/Linux/57/0/.">http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/Linux/57/0/.</A> 

Also if your after more information on raid, read the howto. The howto
also explains another area where swap on raid is dangerous.
<A HREF="http://www.LinuxDoc.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html">http://www.LinuxDoc.org/HOWTO/Software-RAID-HOWTO.html</A>

The link I posted for patches had a typo. Here's the correct address

&gt; &gt; Just out of idle curiosity, why would one be sorry to put a swap file on a
&gt; &gt; raid drive??? I would have thought the increased read speed would make it
&gt; &gt; worth the effort?
&gt; 
&gt; Ah yes it works nicely until something like the following happens. You
&gt; suddenly need swap space, the kernel writes to disk1. Disk 1 crashes.
&gt; Since the disks are in a raid array the kernel now needs memory to write
&gt; to the raid. To do so it swaps out to the same disk but that disk has
&gt; crashed. It tries the next one. That works, Since it's raid we want to
&gt; make sure the data is valid so we read the block off the first disk to do
&gt; a crc. Bang. System hang. Swap space is an area which must be intact at
&gt; all times. 
&gt; 
&gt; There is race conditions between swap and raid as raid need memory to
&gt; perform its tasks. These still exist in the 2.4 kernels.A fix is being
&gt; thougth up/implemented but until that time swap on software raid is not
&gt; safe.


Cheers,
	Benjamin
