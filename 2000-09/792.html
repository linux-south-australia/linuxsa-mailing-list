Or one day, there's no predicting exploits.

&gt; But the lifetime of a linux distribution is more like 12 months.

Linux and Windows have differing upgrade models.  Linux should
have patches applied as they appear.  In a corporate network,
this can easily and cheaply be done.

&gt; With the prices of linux distributions like redhat and suse
&gt; having doubled in the last 12 months, I think that the
&gt; advantages of linux are being whittled away.

Huh?  For the average user, the cost of a Linux distribution
is the media cost.  By this argument, the cost has doubled as
most distros now ship on multiple CDs.  But it's still under $10.

The retail price applies to people that need support.  I'll
note that this is *much* cheaper than purchasing the corresponding
support from Microsoft and its suppliers.

Let's get concrete, Dell is charging the same for corporates for
servers with Windows 98 as with Red Hat Linux.  But the RHL option
comes with 90 days incident support from Linuxcare.

&gt; If linux and MS have the same use-by date, same price...
&gt; and linux requires 10 times as much maintenance...

In my experience, Linux in a corporate environment requires less
support.  This is because systems administration can be much more
effectively centralised and economies of scale exploited.

&gt; well, why would anyone but a computer scientist get linux?

Because it's cheap to buy, cheap to run, and cheap to get support
for.  What Linux lacks is the huge informal support network that
Windows has.  LinuxSA is a response to that lack.  In areas that
have a long UNIX tradition, like computer science and ISPs, Linux
is the natural choice because the informal support is already
there.

I've noticed recently that the network is expanding.  Linux is
becoming dominant in libraries (a traditional UNIX application
market and with a need for tailoring of desktops that Windows
doesn't allow) and is slowly but surely becoming the Java hosting
platform of choice.
