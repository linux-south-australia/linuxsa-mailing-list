&gt;&gt; No.  Why would you want to?  (If it's for reasons of security, then it's

&gt; Because IANA has assigned 1080 to socks.

And ... ?

&gt; socks has had a number of serious security flaws.

And ... ?

&gt; It's almost always scanned by someone who thinks you are running it.

And ... ?

&gt; But if a legitimate service such as a http request happens to assign
&gt; 1080 (despite the fact that there is about 63K other ports to assign),
&gt; and you have a firewall that blocks 1080...

Ah!

&gt; you have a problem.

The problem is one of confusion, and the good thing is, it's mostly
on your part.  :-)  You're confusing the _source_ port with the
_destination_ port.  Services, except for a few broken ones, do not
use the source port to define a service (the broken ones I'm thinking
of being rsh et. al., using it as a source of authentication, which
is partly why ssh came into existance).

&gt; * do you allow socks in despite the security risk&gt;

You're not allowing it in, you're allowing it out (with regards to
outbound connections).  With inbound connections, you're allowing
connections with a destination port of 80 - the source port doesn't
enter into it.  Think of the 4 tuple required for a TCP connection
(or maybe the 5 tuple required for an IP connection - that's more
generic).

(protocol(TCP, UDP, ...),
 Source IP,
 Source Port,
 Destination IP,
 Destination Port)
