Mark,

That's all very good and generous value, as always.

&gt; What I see from this message is that you're quite happy to sacrifice
&gt; virtually all of your security for a bit of convenience (i.e.: you don't
&gt; want to need to type a passphrase).  I don't have a problem with that;
&gt; It just seems to render a lot of the other security stuff you often talk
&gt; about quite pointless.

&gt; Yes, but you'd have to be very confident about your firewall to run it
&gt; like that (and your previous message indicated that you weren't necessarily
&gt; happy with your firewall, because you wanted to keep cleartext passwords
&gt; off your LAN).

[....]
&gt; This is bad advice, Alan.  You're telling someone that it's fine to 
&gt; sacrifice all of their security (and it really is all of it - A single
&gt; .rhosts file can let someone break root!) for the convenience of having
&gt; to type a few less passwords.  It's ludicrous!

I'll just say this:
The precautions you take in a bank, national mint, missile silo 
or ICBM command centre are of a different order
to what is suited to a suburban home office in Prospect.
I don't have the time to think every last scenario through and study every
text on security. I am paid 0 cents/hour for my security improvements,
compared with a big heap per hour for productive work.
I already spend more time on security than is economically justified.
A top computer security person at MI6 or the Pentagon will have
different attitudes to security to someone living in Prospect, SA
with an old 486 and a 33k modem.

All that said, I think I agree that .rhosts is much worse than I
had thought.
But I don't know if I would recommend to everyone to use triple-DES
crypto from one side of their living room to the other.

&gt; With ssh-agent you only need to type the passphrase once per session
&gt; anyway, so I don't really understand what massive gains there are to be
&gt; had in exchange for the complete and total abdication of security 
&gt; you're recommending that Robyn undertakes.

Well, I'm very sorry if I seem to be misleading Robyn into a
"complete and total abdication of security".

Sorry, sorry....

Regarding ssh-agent, I remember reading about that and thinking that
it was a bit vulnerable.
But I'll do some more homework and find out when it is best to use
ssh-agent. That sounds like it's pretty well optimum for
trans-living-room communications.
I might even use it on my laptop while working in potentially
hostile territory (e.g. Europe), assuming that I can trust
my screen lock when I take a break for coffee.

I'm might not read my e-mail for the next 2 days - I'm going to
be re-reading all the ssh manuals.

Cheers and thanks for all the info,
Alan Kennington.
