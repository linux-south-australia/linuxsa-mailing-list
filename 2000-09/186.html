&gt; &gt; The problem with using PC-based routers is that they're designed to sit at
&gt; &gt; the edge of networks (or rather, networks are designed to have them at the
&gt; &gt; edge), the PCI bus is only capable of 132Mbits/s, so even if you put 5 ATM
&gt; &gt; cards in the PCI slots on a new P3, you're still only going to see an
&gt; &gt; aggregate of just over 100Mbits of throughput.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you're wrong about this.

I now suspect I might be :)

&gt; I thought PCI is 32-bit x 33 MHz = 1 Gbit/sec.

Unfortunately, all the references I looked at refer to the speed using
the ambiguous "Mbps" unit. Most of the stuff I deal with day-to-day is
usually in bits-per-second speeds, I guess it becomes a bad habit to
read Mbps as megabits-per-second.

&gt; I've been getting continuous bi-directional 150 Mbit/sec already,
&gt; which is about 300 Mbit/sec total.
&gt; So I think maybe you mean 132 MByte/sec, no MBit/sec.

Cool .. I've always had my incorrect assumptions verified by devices
that never seemed to push more than 132Mbits, and ISA network cards that
never went faster than 5.5Mbits (~650KB/s downloads). A "bing" between
two 100Mb-equipped machines across a Cisco switch does reveal some
300Mbits of bandwidth available, I guess the output of scp previously
was way too limited by disk or something else (now I'm off to test the
netgear switch that used to be that network's backbone..).
