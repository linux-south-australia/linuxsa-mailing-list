G'day from the Olympic Circus City, &lt;grin&gt;.

* begin soapbox rant*

Standard Operating Installs, (SOE), probably solve 80% of sysadmin
problems.
Within an hour, I can give anyone a fully-patched, tweaked, secured OS/2
box, that if it doesn't work its your hardware, its that simple. The
same can be done with Linux. We've all got better things to do than
actually *build* servers...

My SOEs work on the father / child concept:- they are all traceable to a
particular install. They start of generic & then become more specific.
It is easy to pick up an intermediate SOE to then customize.

This concept is *critical* for remote administration:- if you have to
reboot, you want to know it will do exactly that, not pause on keyboard
error, press any key to continue...

It would be nice to find out what Alan is doing wrong, but at the end of
the day, his time might be better spent creating a SOE, the time can
then be leveraged over & over again creating better, more robust SOEs.

Perhaps some of the Smart Folks here could help Alan create a SOE
suitable for his purposes that has a sshd that works, &lt;grin&gt;.

&gt; hey Alan -- did you realise that if you spent as much time setting up your
&gt; linux systems as you do writing extraordinarily long emails, you wouldn't
&gt; have to write so many extraordinarily long emails? :)
