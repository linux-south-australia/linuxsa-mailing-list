Don et al:

&gt; All the same, a change of default login name is much easier to impliment
&gt; than a whole ipfwadm/ipchains/tcp wrappers/tripwire etc. type scenario.

Each time you change your name, I will simply rescan you and find out
your new name.

&gt; The real issue is one of open system versus closed system I think.
&gt; M$ Win9x/NT as relatively closed systems are much easier to configure
&gt; for security as a general rule in my observations.

It depends on what one defines as "easy". In the old days, crashing one
of these "easy" operating systems was as easy as sending the machine a
malformed TCP/IP packet...

&gt; Open systems (Unices etc.), whilst requiring far more attention and a
&gt; greater degree of time and effort to secure and keep secure, by their
&gt; nature also offer greater flexibility.  Bottom line?  Which suits the
&gt; desired purposes better!  There is no singular answer to this.

Point agreed. Nonetheless, I'd prefer to work with an Open Sourced
operating system or at least one that hasn't exhibited such stupid flaws
as another operating system...

&gt; &gt; You are being exposed to the knowledge. It is yours to learn from. It is
&gt; &gt; your choice to run away from it as well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 'A' knowledge, not 'the' knowledge.  One thing about this list is the
&gt; amazing way varied and different ideas and paradigms are used by the
&gt; many users on it.

In the context that I wrote the sentence what I wrote was and still is
quite correct. It was in reply to the statement "a lack of knowledge on
my part" which can be expanded to "a lack of the knoweldge on my part".
A lack of a knowledge doesn't make sense. I hadn't specified "only" but
you have taken it that way.

In order to avoid a flame war and a rather odd sounding sentence we WILL
agree to "You are being exposed to some knowledge".
