Hi there!

Just in case you've FORGOTTEN, the LinuxSA Home Pages are at:

* <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/</A>

Because of the diversity of web clients/browsers I am not going to tell
you how to navigate the home pages. Besides, even I think that's TOO
patronising....you'll find things like LinuxSA Tips (aka as the LinuxSA
Document Project), Meeting Schedules and Notes, news and even links to
the main Linux job page in case you're bored with what you're doing now.

DL

[1] repeat after me....if you are on the mailing list and I missed the
announcement at the LinuxSA web pages because I don't use them then if I
miss out on one million dollars it's MY fault!

[2] another good one...web browsers aren't just online people
viewers....

[3] even better...I must stop trying to crack the traffic between the
AVS Gold Server because it's using similar cryptography to SSH and that
can't be broken....

[4] please correct me if I'm wrong....Geoffrey doesn't have an official
position in LinuxSA, but we can now crown him:

IMPERATOR LINUXSAE

(when I can be bothered about rewriting Orff's opening song to Carmina
Burana, O Fortunat - Imperatrix Mundae, we shall have a performance of
it - a sing along I guess - at each LinuxSA meeting)

SO, on this note!

Ave Geoffrey, Imperator Linuxsae

[ok, so I didn't adjust his name to indicate the vocative tense...shame
shame shame!]
