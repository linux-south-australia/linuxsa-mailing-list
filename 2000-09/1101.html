Some comments from someone who has been testing exactly what I was 
asking about.

In summary:

   - any compliant card works with the Airport

   - the Mac client cards are Mac-specific, will only work in recent Macs
     and at the moment can only be configured from MacOS (probably.)

   - $375 each is the best he's seen for client cards

So the $500 Airport base station seems like a very good deal.

Hi Dan,

Airport base station works well - we use one here at OzLabs with a range of
cards, Apple, 3Com, Lucent, Cabletron etc.  Only downside is that it doesn't
do 128 bit encryption, only 40(!)

At $500 they are certainly well priced - you can scarecly get a PCMCIA card
and ISA/PCI adapter for that.  I'm not sure if anyone's done non-MacOs tools
for them though, you may still need access to a Mac to configure them.

As to the cards themselves, they aren't PCMCIA - yes they look similar but
everything I've found on the subject has been very clear on this.  They also
lack an internal antenna.

We've been looking into this in some detail these last few weeks - best buy
so far is the Cabletron RoamAbout cards (rebadged Lucent) for $396 including
GST  They're a bit cheaper ($375) if you buy them in a six pack.  Driver
works well, Paulus and Anton have just done some tweaks to fix endian
problems.

3Com AirConnect has limited driver support and they're physically flimsy and
only $40 cheaper than the Cabletron.  Had high hopes for these until I
actually played with one.

Farallon cards are re-badged D-Links though the latter isn't available in
.au yet - bit more costly at nearly $500, same chipset as the 3Com (Prism 2)

Think that about covers the options :)

Cheers,
Hugh
