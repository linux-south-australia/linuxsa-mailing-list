For those of you who are still following this thread
(both of you):

I've now concluded that what seemed to be a DOS attack against
my network was in fact something similar but different.

It was DOS spatter!

In other words, someone was attacking a target host
with random IP source addresses, and my hosts just
happened to be among them.
That's happened before with truly random IP source
addresses.
But what I was reporting was 30-second bursts of
such spatter.
I should explain that I'm defining DOS spatter to
be the reply packets from the target host.

crim    ----&gt;    target

me      &lt;---     target

I.e. because of the fake return address on the
IP packets, they go to me instead of the "crim".

This became particularly clear last night when I
noticed that the source TCP ports of the packets
I received were "irc", i.e. 6667.
Hmmm. My SuSE 6.2 machine lists "irc" port as 194
whereas the old Redhat 5.2 says 6667.
Boy, I wish life wasn't so complicated! Grrr!!

Anyway, it was clear that the random packets
"out of the blue" were responses to DOS packets.

Ergo, I was not a DOS target.

But now I've been running this for a little while:

tcpdump -i ppp0 not tcp port http and not port domain and not port smtp and not port 22 and not port 443 and not icmp and not tcp port auth and not udp port ntp

and I'm just amazed at how much DOS ``collateral packets''
are flying around. There's obviously a big war going
on out there!
If my little net is just collecting stray packets at random
from an IP space of 4 billion addresses, then the total
volume must be enormous.

One of the neat things, though, is that by watching such
traffic, you find out who's being DOS-attacked on a particular night.
Last night it was a telstra IRC site called "efnet"?
And a few others....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
