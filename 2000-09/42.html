In that case, they're an idiot.  /bin/true is probably the best shell
for them.

&gt; I would be interested in the pros & cons of this shell over that?
&gt; Are some better on the local console and other better by remote?

Interactive shells are a matter of personal preference, and are
therefore religious in nature.  I constantly have to flip between
vi and emacs editing modes on boxes running tcsh, bash, ksh or
just plain sh (with no history editing at all).  I just live with
it; it's not up to me to force my shell-ish desires on other people.

&gt; I don't wanna start a holy war here, is it just a case of Fords vs Holdens
&gt; or are there REAL advantages to some shells?

Shell scripts, on the other hand, should be coded in Bourne.
Although Bourne shell scripts are more obscure in nature, there
are a lot of things you can do in Bourne that you can't do
in *csh (arbitrary file descriptor redirection is one I can
immediately think of).  There is actually a FAQ of this topic
floating around; probably comp.unix.shell has a pointer to it -
along the lines of "csh scripting considered harmful".  But as
Glen pointed out, shell scripting is starting to show its age,
and it's probably time to move to a higher level scripting
language for anything other than the most moderately simple
tasks.
