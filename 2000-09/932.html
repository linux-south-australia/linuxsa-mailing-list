Hi Guys, 

Thought I'd add my 2 cents worth. While I do agree that there is a
distinction between the system cron and the user cron, 
I'd have to say that I tend to disable the /etc/cron.* facility and rather
use good ol crontab. 
I started in Linux comming from a HP-UX background where your only option is
to put entries in the crontab. Maybe old habits die hard, but I still far
prefer putting anything that need to run a consistant schedule into the root
crontab and letting the jobs get executed this way. 
The /etc/cron.* directories are a great way for people that have never
worked directly with crontab to get their jobs scheduled, but in all my
cases I find that I just don't have quite as much control over when the job
will run exactly. 

Rgds, 
Kevin

&gt; Ok on our RH6.2 box if I run:

&gt;
&gt; But what is the deal with stuff in the
&gt;
&gt; /etc/cron.* directories ????
&gt;
&gt; I have some jobs that have been setup in
&gt;
&gt; /etc/cron.daily
&gt;
&gt; that as you would expect run daily.
&gt;
&gt; Now aside from what looks like a greater level of control in crontab and
&gt; ease of use in /etc/cron.* what's the difference?
&gt;
&gt; Should both be used on one system? Is one generic Linux and one a RH 
thing?

Hey Patrick,

The difference between the two is that one is a 'system' cron and the other 
is a 'user' cron. You would use the /etc/cron* and /etc/crontab to run 
commands that need to be run to maintain the system. For example, I add an 
entry to the /etc/crontab file to 'rdate' the system time each day as some 
of my machines have inaccurate clocks. I also use it to bring a network 
link up that can only be up between certain times of the day, and then to 
bring it down again at the end of the day.

The other one is for things that a user needs doing automatically. For 
example, calling fetchmail to grab your mail off a remote mail server that 
is only running during business hours. I use my personal cron to send me an 
email reminder a few days before the birthdays of close friends and family.

As far as I know, the /etc/cron.* directories are not RH specific (my SuSE 
6.2 machine has them). Having said that however, it can not be guaranteed 
that all distributions have them... I guess.

Hope this helps.

DR
