&gt;Robyn,
&gt;
&gt;My personal philosophy on this is as follows:
&gt;
&gt;Firewall all telnet (23), login (513),
&gt;and shell (514) ports to the outside world.
&gt;Also firewall ftp except for the gateway,
&gt;which should have the user account "ftp"
&gt;commented out of /etc/passwd so as to prevent
&gt;anonymous ftp.

Hmmm, if this means what I think it means, then I think it is not
adequate.

In ipchains speak, the first rule is:

   ipchains -P input deny

Then open up, to the outside, only those ports that are absolutely
needed. Like port 53/udp and 53/tcp if you have a primary name server
with a secondary outside. I would go further and only allow connections
to a specific host. Also allow port 25/tcp to a specific host for mail.
Also allow packets back in on established connections. Still, I would 
love to have the state keeping capabilities of the 2.4 netfilter stuff.

&gt;Then comment out telnet from /etc/inetd.conf
&gt;(and do "kill -HUP xxx", where xxx is the pid of
&gt;the inetd process).

Yes, this is good.

&gt;For access between machines _within_ your network,
&gt;use the .rhosts file to specify which hosts/users
&gt;are trusted.
&gt;
&gt;The reason for this is to make sure that your
&gt;passwords don't appear on the local network even.

This is bad if the baddies have already got in. You give them free reign.

&gt;Then use "rcp" and "rlogin" (or "rsh") without
&gt;passwords instead of ftp and telnet.

Better to use ssh and scp if you are real paranoid, and require the
use of public keys with a long pass phrase.

&gt;It seems to me that ftp and telnet can both be safely
&gt;consigned to history.

They are convenient on occassion, but convenience and security are at the
opposite ends of the spectrum.

&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Alan Kennington.
