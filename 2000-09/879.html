&gt; &gt; I personally think that students should be taught the concepts of computing
&gt; &gt; and computing applications.  They should be taught basic programming (C) to
&gt; &gt; help them understand how things are working.
&gt; 
&gt; Oh come on.  C is not basic programming, by the designer's intent.

;-)

&gt; 
&gt; I can't see why programming needs to be taught at school at all,
&gt; it's like teaching kids biomechanics during PE.

Not so much the actual languages, but the concepts and way of thinking
are extremely useful in areas other than I.T. Besides, we all need to
wear different hats. It would give students a greater understanding of
how the PC works. Whilst you don't need to understand the exact
mechanics of how a car works, you still need to know how to top up the
oil, fuel, how to lock the car, etc. Doing some programming is in the
same boat. A simple nicely structured language (like Pascal or Ada) is
ideal.

&gt; An understanding
&gt; that such a thing exists is good, but you don't need fifteen weeks
&gt; tutorial in body chemistry to learn that running hard makes your
&gt; legs sore but if you stop and rest you can run again.

Moderation in all things. Not too much, but also, not too little.

&gt; &gt; If you give the teachers minimal training in things like the shell you are
&gt; &gt; using and in the general layout of the system (file system, printing, home
&gt; &gt; dirs, etc) then tell them the basics of the Un*x like system they should be
&gt; &gt; able to stay one step ahead of the kids.
&gt; 
&gt; No teacher is going to step in front of a class feeling particularly
&gt; good about that level of training.  It's like suggesting that English
&gt; teachers should read the next chapter the night before the class.

Also, teachers (they aren't the only ones, mind you) refuse to accept
any change. They teach, this means they don't have to learn (or so I've
been told). Show them KDE and a lot would immediately tell you that they
can't use it. Just because it's a change (for better or worse). I think
showing them the shell is not the best idea (although, in the
certificate III and IV course, they learn the DOS command line....).

The students (if interested) would eat this stuff for breakfast, but as
you say, confidence on the teacher's part is where the problem lies.

&gt; &gt; You musn't forget that the underlying concepts of Linux are similar
&gt; &gt; to Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I suggest you have a look at the printing subsystems.
&gt; 
&gt; Teachers have been dropped into the computing technology tar pit
&gt; and expected to swim.  It's totally unfair of the Linux community
&gt; to want to do this to them yet again.

If it's to do with change, they aren't interested. If you give them the
opportunity to learn it and they decline, sometimes you need to drop
them in it.

&gt; If you want to see Linux taught in schools, then work out a way
&gt; to support those schools.  Don't expect teachers to shoulder the
&gt; entire burden.

Fair enough, but they do need to shoulder some....

Thanks,
Matt
