Modems rrp $259 or something around that.

Subject: ADSL Modem Alternatives


Hi Guys,

I made a call to Cisco in Sydney. They say that their 827 Router is
still undergoing
testing from Telstra, and should be released within 1-2 months. Cisco
are apparently
waiting on Telstra to get their act together.

Maybe the Cisco box will perform better. I might end up testing one out
on a link
and see how it goes. I'l post any results to you. If anyone else uses
the Cisco gear
in the future, I would be interested in hearing how it goes.

I believe that Nortel will be releasing an ADSL box as well.  Currently
they only sell
the carrier backbone stuff, but Client end is expected within a couple
of months.

3Com told me that they are the ones that supply Telstra with the client
end box
that everyone gets. Apparently, it is a 3Com box with an Alcatel chip in
it. 3Com
were very 'Oh really.. We had no idea!". Yeah sure 3Com.. ;)

NetGear also make a router thing which was designed originally for
Cable, but
'works' with ADSL. They are having some troubles with it where it just
locks up and
dies for no particular reason (Sound Familiar???)

I hope that this has provided you with some more information.

Kind Regards

Andrew Reid
