I have been running Vmware at work under redhat 6.2 with both 2.2.14 and 2.2.16
for some time now, however my success seems to have been much greater. However,
I have noticed a couple of things I'd reccomend doing to get decent (usable
without too much annoyance) performance.  Firstly, ensure you have at least
128mb of ram in your linux box.  If you have 64, forget it.  I have compared it
to a mates machine at work and with 64mb it's unbarable.  I have 128, and run it
24/7 and get normal performance in linux, and passable in windoze.  Secondly
make sure you have dma enabled on your hard drive in linux, and also in
windows.  Even though its emulated hardware, think of how much more emulating
it's gonna have to do to emulate polling the drive!  Make sure you are running
windows 95, not 98! 95 will do nearly almost everything that 98  will (some
things even better in 95 like alphabetically sorting the programs on the start
menu - where did that feature go? oh it must have been a bug...) and use huge
amounts less ram than 98. If you must run 98 then go to 98lite.net and run 98
with the 95 shell. This is what i'm running now on my home machine (well with
xwin 4.11 and a linux box under the desk, displaying on the windows screen,
which if you want to try this I can go into more detail as well).  IMHO the 98
kernel was the stablest there has been, but unfortunatly was totally rooted by
all the bugs that IE introduced! 98 lite is small & stable (ish :) anyway back
to the point...  Having 2 OSes and one being bloatware ram is the biggest
performace factor.  If you dont have enough in windows it'll have to swap to
much and of course swapping on an emulated drive?  iiewwww.... And if you give
to much ram to windows then linux will have the swap problem and start running
like crap.  In my particular instance I'm allocating 32mb to windows 95c, and
running office 2000 apps in that 32mb with quite reasonable performance, leaving
96meg for linux which runs just fine as well (with a stack of apps :).  After
more than 1 office app in windows it does slow down to much though. Incadentally
the machine is a celeron 500.

If you want linux + windows + windows games, i'd suggest starnets xwin32.  I
have it set to auto run an Eterm on start up and then run xwin from startup in
windows.  I have my display environment variable also set in the global bash rc,
so that I can use the terminal just like I am on the linux box with no special
configuration and get x apps on the windows machine too.  It works like a dream.
(although no 3d support, for that you need to use exceed which is the same deal
but from hummingbird software and with 3d support.  However this is the most
stupidly expensive solution there is, and it kinda takes over your system to!)
I'm gradually swapping to linux apps when I find good ones with a view that
someday I wont need windows at all! :) :) :)  Infact, my windows partition had a
bad fat corrutption (yeah the 2 copys of the fat right next to each other with
no check sums got corrupted!) about a month ago and it was heaps easier to
re-install since most my data & apps were still intact & installed on the linux
box :)

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, I can comment.
&gt;
&gt; I recently (ok, a month or so ago) set up VMWare on my dual celeron box
&gt; with RedHat 6.2
&gt;
&gt; I was dissapinted with the quality of the documentation, resulting in a
&gt; working Win95 install on the second go around. Windows install was
&gt; painfully slow.
&gt;
&gt; The VMWare I used was one of the first to include the vmware-tools in the
&gt; program, rather than a separate download. This was hopelessly poorly
&gt; documented, and when I finally worked it out, I could see that the
&gt; documentaion was correct, but ambiguous.
&gt;
&gt; Once installed with the vmware video driver loaded, the system ran ok.
&gt;
&gt; As a comparison, I was asked to install W95 onto an ageing P150 the same
&gt; weekend. This I did, and I have to say that both the install and the
&gt; running speed of a P150 made my VMWare install look like crap.
&gt;
&gt; About this time the security advisory for RedHat 2.2.14 kernel came out
&gt; and I upgraded to 2.2.16 as a result, breaking the VMWare modules, which
&gt; would not compile for the new kernel. Instead I was informed by the
&gt; helpful compile process that I should upgrade or downgrade the compiler
&gt; because it had bugs that prevented vmware from compiling the modules.
&gt;
&gt; It struck me as strange that I could compile the kernel, but a few k's of
&gt; source from VMWare would fail.
&gt;
&gt; After waiting for the non-responsive tech support for 3 weeks, I decided
&gt; that I was getting the best support I was ever going to get from VMWare -
&gt; none. It is a testament to the strength of open-source that there is far
&gt; better support in linux for programs that are not sold than this product.
&gt; Especially when the license cost for a business user is more than the cost
&gt; of the guest OS I was trying to use. In fact, I decided to trash VMWare
&gt; and load Windows on an old P150 and save myself the hassle.
&gt;
&gt; To this day I have had zero response from the VMWare organisation, and I
&gt; regard posting to a newsgroup for commercial product support as a slap in
&gt; the face. Why do some commercial software companies think it is okay to
&gt; charge for beta software?
&gt;
&gt; No, I wouldn't bother with it for games from a speed point of view.
&gt; Dual-boot will deliver native performance with none of these hassles.
&gt;
&gt; In case you haven't guessed, I am not impressed with VMWare! The program
&gt; shows a lot of promise, but I regard it as beta software, and certainly
&gt; not something I would pay for. VMWare's lack of response to a potential
&gt; customer has delivered them the expected result - no sale.

&gt; &gt; have any of you perchance used VMware on linux for a windows (9x)
&gt; &gt; virtual machine? in particular, is performance for gaming noticably
&gt; &gt; worse than native windows (/me dons flameproof suit)?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; any comments on stability or comparisons to free emulators like WINE?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; VMware seems to be well regarded in some circles and hardly mentioned
&gt; &gt; (in the
&gt; &gt; context of emulators) in others. perhaps its because the price looks a
&gt; &gt; little steep (though US$99 for non corporate use is at least possible)
&gt; &gt; or a dual boot turns out to be easier?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; thanks,

DISCLAIMER: If your hard drive turns to powder or windoze scrambles
itself, I will not be responsible. Remember, the solution to all
these problems (window scrambling, etc) is to install a real
operating system on good hardware. Have a nice day.
