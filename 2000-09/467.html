The problem isn't as difficult as you make it out to be.  This solution
is a tad extreme.

 &gt; The FTP protocol really is not suited to an internet
 &gt; dominated by juvenile delinquents.

&lt;shrug&gt;  It seems to be doing ok so far.

 &gt; To transfer a file, I've noticed in my logs that
 &gt; the fetcher opens a connection on an unprivileged port
 &gt; to the server.

That's not true.  If you examine the logs more carefully you'll usually find
that the server opens the connection back to the client.  The exception is
when the client has requested passive mode, in which case it really does make
a connection out.

When you're not running in passive mode, an FTP "get" transfer goes like
this:

   - The clinet has an ftp control connection open on port 21.

   - Client creates a local socket and bind()'s it.  It then uses
     getsockaddr() to find out the port number which has been created
     for it.

   - Client sends "PORT w,x,y,z,a,b" to the server, where w,x,y,z are
     the client's IP address octets and a,b are the octets of the port
     number determined above, in network byte order.

   - Client sends "RETR /some/file/name"

   - Server creates a new socket and bind()s it to its own IP address on
     port 20 (ftp-data).

   - Server connects that socket to w.x.y.z on port [a,b] (where [a,b] is 
     just my made up notation for "ntohs((a &lt;&lt; 8) | b)"

   - Server transmits the contents of /some/file/name over that new connection.

   - Connection complete;  new connection is shut down, which signals the
     completion of the transfer to the client.

It's the second connection, on unpredictable port numbers, which is the 
problem for firewalls.

There are a number of ways out of it.    Firstly, the client can select
"passive" mode if the server supports it.  In passive mode, the client
makes the connection out to the server, not the other way around (which is
much easier to filter with a firewall:  You're probably already allowing 
outbound connections on any port if you're halfway competent with IP
filtering rules).

Secondly, you can run your ftp's through a HTTP proxy -- If you do that, 
the whole transfer happens over one connection, the one which is linking
you to the proxy. 

Thirdly, you can permit connections FROM any IP address on port 20 TO any
of your IP addresses on any port number greater than 1024.  This isn't a 
brilliant solution, but generally speaking you aren't running any "real"
services on port numbers higher than 1024 anyway, so the security downside
isn't necessarily as bad as it sounds.

Fourthly, you can use a state-monitoring firewall.  You can't afford this :-)

Fifthly, you can use NAT -- Ports which an ftp client aren't listening to
won't work at all;  think of this as a poor-man's state-monitoring
firewall.

That should give you something to chew on, anyway.

 &gt; To permit this, it seems like I have to permit all
 &gt; TCP connections between ports 1024 and over.

Not true.

 &gt; PS.  I spent 6 hours last night converting
 &gt; my libertine default-accept ipfwadm script
 &gt; to the conservative default-deny script.

It's probably quicker and easier to not convert them line-by-line, but
instead to develop a security policy along the lines of, "I need to run
an SMTP server, so TCP port 25 should be permitted to 192.168.2.6," and
so on, then "compiling" that policy into access lists afterwards.  There
are many good reasons for doing it that way.
