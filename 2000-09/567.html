Not so.  Charges have the same basis whatever version of IP.
At the moment, you need to be a member of APNIC when the address
space is allocated.

More so than in IPv4, allocation of IPv6 address only really needs
to be made to backbone ISPs.  If your ISP is charging you rental
on your IP address space, then go elsewhere.

&gt; The transition between v4 and v6 will also require some sort of NAT
&gt; proxy between the old space and the new space.

Not so.  Have a look at 6to4.  Your claim assumes that IPv6
interfaces are expected to have only have one IPv6 address, as
in IPv4.  This is not so, IPv6 interfaces are expected to have
multiple addresses.

No NAT technology is required for IPv6/IPv4 interworking, an
IPv6 router will happily unwrap 6to4 packets into IPv4 traffic.

&gt; IPv6 will most likely become reality not through the Internet as we know
&gt; it, but as a result of Mobile phones and similar devices requiring a
&gt; distinct address. There are more mobile phone users than Internet users,
&gt; and in places like Japan they are already offering Internet facilities
&gt; with every new phone.

At last, something I can agree with :-)
