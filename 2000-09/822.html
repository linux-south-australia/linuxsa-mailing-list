Regarding ethernet and dual celerons:


&gt; I am seeing some curious results with a pair of test system running Linux
&gt; 2.2.14.
&gt; 
&gt; The systems are a K6-2/400 and a dual-celery 533, with 128MB and 256MB
&gt; respectively. 
&gt; 
&gt; They have a DLINK 10/100 fdx (DEC 21140-based) and 3Com 3c59X 10/100 FDX
&gt; card in them with a cross-over cable between them.

I suspect this could be the dual celeron causing problems.  I know
that have bitched about the BP6 before on this list :-(, but my
experience is with a NetGear 10/100 ethernet card in a dual celeron
BP6 box.  I cannot get it to work effectively --- similiar problems,
intermittent transmitter freezers, and inability to handle DHCP
request packages from an iMac.  It works fine at 10 Mbit, talking to a
ne2k-pci fitted debian box.

I have spent many hours trolling the tulip mailing list archives.
Where I have developed the distinct impression that thousands of
people are happily using these NetGear and DLink tulip clones, whilst
a few are having the set of problems mentioned here.  It is not a
simple IRQ etc problem.

Donald Becker, the author of the driver in question, seems to
tirelessly help those on the list, but is growing a little tetchy.  In
the posts that I have studied, he made some illusions to problems in
the BP6 concerning one of the more exotic SMP interupt types.  (Sorry
I cannot remember the terminology.)  Somebody from Mandrake or Suse
(cannot remember which) also mentioned timing issues and that they had
received many support queries for the NetGear FA310TX.

I woud be _very_ interested in any success you have, especially if it
is the case that you have the DLink in the BP6 and you are able to fix
this problem by swapping the ethernet cards between the boxes.  I am
thinking of buying a 3com card for my BP6.


Cheers,


Andrew
