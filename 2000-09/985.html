&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry Sarah but what are you asking here?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I was after your personal opinion and the reasons for it (if your so
&gt; &gt; inclined)!
&gt; 
&gt; Since you seem serious.
&gt; 
&gt;   vi for system administration
&gt; 
&gt;     Available on every platform.  It's only real advantage, as having a
&gt;     mode-full editor is a horrible user interface design choice.
&gt; 
&gt;   XEmacs for programming
&gt; 
&gt;     Calling emacs an editor is like calling Everest a hill.  But if you
&gt;     program for a living, it's perfect.  If you thought you could blow a
&gt;     lot of time fiddling with GUIs, then you've seen nothing yet.  Takes
&gt;     about a week to learn to use and about two years to become an expert.
&gt;     But if you've ever faced maintaining 100,000 lines of code then it's
&gt;     got exactly the features you need, somewhere.  XEmacs has a less
&gt;     steep learning curve than GNU Emacs.
&gt; 
&gt;     To give you an idea of just how carried away emacs has become, it has
&gt;     a very good mail client.  It will also convert between source control
&gt;     formats.  It will maintain files on the far side of an FTP, ssh or
&gt;     cvs connection.  It has a very good text to PostScript converter.
&gt;     There are at least 1,000 other features.
&gt; 
&gt;     In short, you can start emacs from your .login and not feel the need
&gt;     to leave.  Some very sick people do.

I've always been a vim person.  But, I've never really tried Emacs.  Does
anyone have a good learn-the-basics-of-emacs-fast link?

I typed 'emacs' at the command prompt, then couldn't work out how to quit,
so my only option was to cut the power to the building.

And can I just say..  Vim is damn cool.  As I said, I've not really tried
emacs, but vim does some incredibly cool things.  I can probably guarantee
that it's faster to do *any* sort of edit using vim/vi than using any other
text editor on the planet - its command structure is gorgeous (when you get
to know it :)

It colourises, it auto-indents, it understands loads of programming
thingies, it does line-numbering, the most commonly-used functions are all
single keystrokes, its search/replace/etc functionality is perfect, and
someone wrote a script to generate and solve a maze in it.  Now that is
just cool.  AND it loads in a split second.  I don't know about emacs.
Vi/vim is fast, sleek, inredibly powerful, and deceptively intuitive.  ;)

Anyway.


Nick
