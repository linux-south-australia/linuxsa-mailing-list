&gt; I estimate I've lavished 4000 hours already on setting up this

100% wrong conclusion.  It reduces the opportunity for hackers to
perform these sorts of stunts, but *not to zero*.

&gt; So personally I wouldn't recommend that anyone connect their
&gt; computers to the net 24 hours a day, unless they want a continuous
&gt; education in security.

The "24 hours a day" is superfluous.

I have seen sporadic PPP dial on demand machines trojaned.  I've
seen spam punched through another of these machines, forcing the
link up for many hours a day (the owner didn't notice until they
got the bill from their ISP in the next monthly accounting cycle,
which is what tipped them.  Not all the warning messages that
people were sending to postmaster@, they just deleted them).

&gt; For me, security is pure overheads.

It's probably that attitude that's the most prevelant.  I
vaguely remember some Woody Allen quote about life being
primarily overhead.

&gt; For some other people on this list, it's a source of income.

For me, it's a necessary evil.  I've much better things to waste
my time on than securing boxes (at some stage, I hope to have a
life, plus my own CS interests outside of administration), but
_I know_ that if I don't do it, I will suffer the repercussions
later.

Ask yourself: What's it worth to you if they'd made off with
your valuable research data?  Your private notes and
correspondance?  Your livelyhood?

&gt; With a clientele of one user (me), it isn't worth my while to
&gt; spend heaps more time on security.

This seems to be a common theme running through your security
threads.

&gt; As to ipchains, I use another redhat 5.2 machine for the firewall,
&gt; but only ipfwadm was available at that time.

I've just had to secure a machine with ipfwadm.  Nothing wrong with
it (it's a little klunky), provided it's used correctly (but see
below) ...

&gt; Since it's on the net 24 hours/day, I can't just spend a day
&gt; re-installing the OS and doing all the new config stuff.
&gt; And I haven't had the time to learn the command set of ipchains yet.
&gt; The ipfwadm does block port 110.

Again, and again:  block everything by default, allow only those
services you need.  Don't block a specific port, only allow it.
This will help protect, especially if, say, you accidently (or
something else deliberately) enable a service.

What Richard is preaching is good advice.  What Mark is preaching
is good advice.  Strangely enough, they coincide.

&gt; Actually I understand it all.
&gt; I've been managing unix boxes for 12 years.
&gt; The trouble is that new vulnerabilities are being continuously added.

Then what on earth were you using POP2 for?

&gt; Now I've gone through and ripped out the rubbish from my inetd.conf
&gt; files and HUPped inetd.conf.

Again, this is wrong.  You cannot trust that system to have
non-compromised binaries on it.  How do you know that they haven't
trojaned /bin/login?  ps and ls?  Rootkits commonly do this to
cover their tracks.  Try a "find /dev -type f", and see if many
files are returned (common place for a sniffer and other bits to be
installed).

And hupping inetd may be pointless anyway - a common trick it to
get inetd to read a bogus inetd.conf instead of the one you think
it's using.

&gt; My philosophy has been to have a good firewall machine, and then all the
&gt; computers can live safely behind that.
&gt; You may put locks on the doors and windows of your house.
&gt; But do you want deadlocks between every room inside the house?

Nice analogy.  Pity it isn't relevant.  Here's another:

"Just because I have a card swipe that allows me access to the building
my office resides in, doesn't mean that I get access to every office
in that building."

&gt; Denying services to the crims also means denying them to yourself sometimes.

You seem to be arguing the same position you had before your
discovery.  In which case, your mind is already made up.
