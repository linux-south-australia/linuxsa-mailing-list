&gt; Subject: Re: Wireless LANS, and the Samsung MagicLan
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This means you can link two offices of the same company together
&gt; if they're
&gt; less than 500 m apart;  you can link an employee to an office if they're
&gt; less than 500 m apart too;  But you can't link offices from two separate
&gt; companies together over any distance without a carrier licence, nor can
&gt; you link an employee to their office if the distance is greater than 500m.

So does this mean (technically speaking) that if two companies were in the
same premises, and one company got a high-speed Internet connection they
could not on-sell bandwidth to the 2nd company without a licence?

And, if this is true, what would happen if Company A got an Internet
connection, there was a join venture which required Internet access, but
which was operated under the banner of Company B? Would Company A need a
licence?

And if a licence is needed in the first case, but not the second, could
Company B get bandwidth from the joint venture, which would ultimately
result in Company A receiving monetary compensation for the bandwidth
Company B used?
