Evan!

&gt; Isn't this enough to scare most users looking for alternative workstation
&gt; platforms back to microsoft. I know it became obvious shortly into message
&gt; that I am way out of my depth and MS solutions seem so much simpler.

MS Solutions aren't really that much simpler. They are at least as
insecure as modern Linux boxes. Furthermore, they tend to obscure,
obfuscate and hide their security loop holes. Just to give you an idea,
if you are running a default Windows installation of 9X or even NT, I
can probably tell you what your log in name is. Furthermore, if you're
on a network and you have a guest account and share I can probably log
into that share from my Linux system....

And Windows users don't even know that you are doing it!

&gt; Sorry, but there is obviously a lack of knowledge on my part and I doubt
&gt; I'm too different from a lot of naieve users.

You are being exposed to the knowledge. It is yours to learn from. It is
your choice to run away from it as well.

&gt; Surely there is a NICE way of securing what you have to avoid these
&gt; exploits without resorting to archaic console commands. Or without the need
&gt; for introducing a firewall box etc.

There are a number of solutions:

* don't log onto the Internet
 - that's nice to everyone except yourself

* use a firewall building script
 - take a search at <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net</A> and search for "firewall"

Console commands are not archaic. They are there to be used and
understood. I help to administer a Linux system in Adelaide; the system
I help to administer does not use X and uses few curses-style tools as
well. The company that owns the system is, I believe, a market leader in
its field and expanding. Furthermore, I find console commands much
easier to work with, they make my life easier.

Your reply to me will be, undoubetedly, that you are just a user and
can't be expected to understand Linux (or any operating system) to the
degree that I do. I agree with you totally; you wouldn't be wrong if you
thought or said this. Nonetheless, with the obvious concern for security
- shown by the commercial viability of making virus scanners for example
- I would advise you to at least take an interest in the security of
whatever operating system you choose to use.

One needs to take a good think about how secure one wishes to have one's
system. I take it seriously, so I run a reasonable firewall script [nmap
by itself says that the host is down and when I run it such that it does
manage to start scanning nmap also reports that I don't have any
unexpectedly open ports...and I understand the security issues with what
I'm running etc etc]. You might take a different stance; it is your
choice.

Security is not nice. I doubt it ever will be. We'll just have to live
with that.
