&gt; &gt; ROFL.  Checking a source IP address costs 32 table lookups in the
&gt; &gt; worst case, three in the average case.  So it actually saves routing
&gt; &gt; resources, as subsequent routers don't have to forward the packet.
&gt; 
&gt; I meant from a CPU point of view.  I've just had to put a filter
&gt; on a FDDI interface (all port 80 traffic to a specific IP address)
&gt; and the additional load is noticeable.  Mind you, the router is
&gt; probably now underspec'd for that interface ...

I meant from a CPU point of view:

  interface Ethernet0
    ip verify unicast reverse-path

requires one routing table lookup.  A CPU-based routing table implemented
using a Patrica tree takes 32 table references in the worst case to
resolve an IP address to an interface.  In practice, it takes about
three table references, this is, almost always faster than using
an access list.

&gt; &gt; Cisco is under siginficant pressure to alter their default.
&gt; 
&gt; Their default doesn't do _anything_.  "no ip routing", from memory.
&gt; I guess they're doing the old "once you configure it, it's your
&gt; responsibility" trick.

When IOS creates an interface, it installs particular defaults.  For
example, the interface is created shut down, without an IP address,
and disallowing directed broadcasts.  The pressure is on to expand
this to be:

  interface Ethernet0
    no ip address
    no ip directed-broadcast
    no ip proxy-arp
    no ip redirects
    ip verify unicast reverse-path
    shutdown

Thus the Internet is protected from the clueless and lazy.  Yes, sometimes
the defaults need to be removed, but these ISPs by definition are not
clueless (or are about to gain clue the hard way).
