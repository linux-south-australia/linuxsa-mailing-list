  &gt; A possible way to use public/private keys under windows is for putty to
  &gt; hold them (securely) and require a password (phase whatever) when use of
  &gt; the key is required.

  That buys me nothing over using password authentication: I still
  have to type a pass(word|phrase) in order to log in! For me, the
  purpose of key authentication is to avoid this - to avoid having to
  make an effort to authenticate at all. Naturally, I can only do this
  if I consider the machine I connect from to be trustworthy.

  My assessment of public key authentication still stands: if somebody
  else implements it, I'm willing to accept it, but I won't make the
  effort myself because it's no use to me.

Incidentally this was the sixth item in the list returned by google for
"putty windows public key".

&gt; Right now, I can't contact the putty web-site even,

google caches a lot of pages.

&gt; But I thought that someone last Tuesday said that putty
&gt; can indeed use public key authenticaiton.
&gt; If so, please let me know.

Wasn't there, don't use putty, but I do use google :-)

&gt; Whenver I say something that it not grovelling good
&gt; about linux, that measn I think it can be improved

I'm still not sure if this is an acceptable attitude. Maybe posting the
output of 'last' at the bottom of each message might prove sufficiently
how committed you are, if readers could see that at each reply the list
was significantly longer than the last. Yes, this would be justice.
