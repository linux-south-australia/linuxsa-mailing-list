Open source Call-to-arms!

Looking for a chance to become an open-source hacker and gain peer
recognition? 

Just when you thought you had your personal life under control
OpenOffice comes along...

StarOffice, recently purchased by Sun Microsystems, is to become GPL'd
on Oct 31st.  There's 9,000,000 lines of C++ waiting for modifications. 
There's already a community of several hundred hackers, waiting for the
release.  www.openoffice.org is where it'll be hosted (run by
collab.net, which is an initiative of Brian Behlendorf of apache fame). 

Join the mailing list, contribute code, help with the port to gtk+, help
with the openofficelite version - slated for palm handhelds!  Get
involved!  Contribute!  This is your opportunity to become part of the
community!  A chance to build a free office suite to win over the world
to Linux!  Say goodbye to sleep and any semblence of a normal life! 
Become an Uber-hacker!
