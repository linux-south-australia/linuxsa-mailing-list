---end excerpt---

&gt; If you buy your Internet access off them (reasonable package, including the
&gt; cost of ADSL gear) you are allowed to have only one user per connection.

Wrong.
Additonal users $11 each number of maximum additonal users dependant on
rate plan. I think it is 7 for the pay for bytes after some certain umber
and 3 for "all you can eat type accounts".

RTFM - or at least the thoughtfully supplied exceprt above.
:-)

&gt; 
&gt; Now, this refers to only one computer connected, and only one person sitting
&gt; at that computer.  What happens if I connect my gateway/firewall/etc to the
&gt; ADSL modem and then use IPMasq to "pretend" that many users are only one
&gt; user?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone come up agains this yet?  What do you think Telstra will do about
&gt; that?

Probably charge you $11 per each user overthe period they think you have
been breaching your contract.

Possibly discconnect you and make you pay out your contract - depnds on
contract conditions I would think.
Possibly charge you for excess stolen traffic - depends on the contract
conditions.
Possibly sue you for breach of contract just to make an example of you
and cost you heaps.

By why bother when it is only $11 per extra user?
Especially when you lookt atthe cost between more than 1 more person.

Eg 2 phone lines @soemthign like $20 a month each, 
2 internet accounts  @ ay $40 each probably with 250meg or 150-200 hour
limits.

Your are already at $120 or so ie about $60 each.

With adsl it is about $115 if you dont have Telstra as your LD carrier ie 
about $57 each.

And if you have 3 people it gets cheaper about $40 each. ANd you have far
better availability and bandwidth, dont ahve to pay for local calls blah
blah blah.
