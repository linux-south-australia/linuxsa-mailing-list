Had a chat with some folks from Hitech today (Marco, the network
salesperson/guru).

They have been plugging this new "ABM Workgroup Server" for a few weeks now
and are going to let us (Stellaris) test drive it next week.
I'll report to the list how that goes. They reckon it's a half hour or less
setup. Hmmmmmm.

The blurb says;
"The Appliance Based Mission-Critical Server is based on the Immunix OS, a
hardened version of Linux which makes it less vulnerable to network attacks.
The modular design of this server is easy to configure through a web
browser, and offers the ability to easily plug in extra services and play
without any down time!"

It can be setup with;
Web Server
Email Server
File Server -30GB Max
Print Server
Intranet Server

Anyways Hitech if given enough notice will be happy to let us have the demo
box for the SecureFest and is happy for us to hack/crack it!

Good for LinuxSA we get a toy to play with... :-)
Good for Hitech they find out how really secure it is, or not. :-) (I
wouldn't wan't to sell one a find our it had big holes and the system
wouldn't let me fix 'em)

In our company here we have discussed this box a bit and since it's RRP is
$1,999 it is most often cheaper for us to build a Linux Box and bolt it down
ourselves. However if this little ABM Server does hold water, for some
clients it would be a good little solution (time wise that is, everything is
a trade off).

The sooner we nail down a date for SecureFest, the sooner I can chat with
Hitech again.

Who ever is taking the bull by the horns and organising things at this stage
please e-mail me off-list.
