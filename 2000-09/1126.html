 &gt; &gt; This means you can link two offices of the same company together

 &gt; &gt; less than 500 m apart too;  But you can't link offices from two separate
 &gt; &gt; companies together over any distance without a carrier licence, nor can
 &gt; &gt; you link an employee to their office if the distance is greater than 500m.
 &gt; 
 &gt; So does this mean (technically speaking) that if two companies were in the
 &gt; same premises, and one company got a high-speed Internet connection they
 &gt; could not on-sell bandwidth to the 2nd company without a licence?
 
No.  Internal fixed wiring is different.

However, the company onselling the high-speed connection would then be
classed as a carriage service provider under the Telecommunications Act,
which would mean they'd need to join the TIO, look after obligations under
the Broadcasting Services Amendment Act 1999, etc.

 &gt; And, if this is true, what would happen if Company A got an Internet
 &gt; connection, there was a join venture which required Internet access, but
 &gt; which was operated under the banner of Company B? Would Company A need a
 &gt; licence?

The "Immediate circle" exemption would probably come into play here for
as long as the joint venture continued.

 &gt; And if a licence is needed in the first case, but not the second, could
 &gt; Company B get bandwidth from the joint venture, which would ultimately
 &gt; result in Company A receiving monetary compensation for the bandwidth
 &gt; Company B used?

It'd probably be ok as long as the joint venture continued - consult a 
lawyer.
