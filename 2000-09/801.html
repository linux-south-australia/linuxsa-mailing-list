&gt; &gt; By why bother when it is only $11 per extra user?
&gt; 
&gt; Because that add's up to some $132 extra per year, on something that's
&gt; already costing a small fortune anyway.

In  comparitive sense it is not costing a fortune. Go buy(or lease) 
yourself a DSL modem, lease a line and byuy wholsesales bytes, suck down
as many bytes as you can through ftp,http, real audio etc and see hwo much
it costs you.

The Telstra consumer deals seem quite reeasonalbe when compared to the
altrnatives.

 &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Especially when you lookt atthe cost between more than 1 more person.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Eg 2 phone lines @soemthign like $20 a month each, 
&gt; &gt; 2 internet accounts  @ ay $40 each probably with 250meg or 150-200 hour
&gt; &gt; limits.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your are already at $120 or so ie about $60 each.
&gt; 
&gt; Why in hell would you be paying for 2 lines, 2 a/c's, etc. The average
&gt; linux user is probably already running a multi-user setup over one
&gt; modem and one isp a/c already.

Because that is fucntionally the equivilant of what dsl provides.

Compare apples and apples, not apples and oranges.

The abilty to talk on the phone and be on the internet simultatneously.

Actually it offers more than that, it offers the ability to talk on the
phone and be on the net with orders of magnitufde more bandwidth.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; With adsl it is about $115 if you dont have Telstra as your LD carrier ie 
&gt; &gt; about $57 each.
&gt; 
&gt; Not if it's a family environment. All the bills in such an environment
&gt; come out of one pool of funds.

And how many familes have simultatneous hosts on the net sharing a single 
modem connection, not many, only the tech savvy and of course there is
nothign to stop them from using their current system if the dsl product
does not suit.

How many ISPs will let you log in with one account on two simultaneous
sessions. Not many I know of. Some actually suspend(or used to) the
account on the premise someone has stolen the password.

&gt; 
&gt; What of the single user with multiple machines connecting through a
&gt; firewall? Who's (s)he going to share the costs with?

No one. Tough luck. Th4e plans are to me a reaosnable attempt at best fit. 

In any case you don't have to have a plan that restricts you to one user,
you cn always pay by the byte. So there are optiosn fo r that scenario.
You just have to schoose, can I change my usage patterns? If yes hwo
much is it worth to me to not change.

You will recall that telstra is a for profit company and there are
altrerntaives to telstra for net access?
Even so, there prices are imho generally fairly reasonable, given the
current alternatives.

It is not as if dsl is a god given right, or even a necesity for most
families, and if it is a necesity, then $11 a month is quite
reasonable, for the convenince.


&gt; 
&gt; &gt; And if you have 3 people it gets cheaper about $40 each. ANd you have far
&gt; &gt; better availability and bandwidth, dont ahve to pay for local calls blah
&gt; &gt; blah blah.
&gt; 
&gt; This argument works fine for a share house type arrangement...
&gt; 

Yes it does.
Or a fmaily with teenagers who pay for their own access cos they don;t
like to share. And lots of otehr scenarios.


&gt; Dave
&gt; ~ yes I know my arguments could have been put a lot better, but I'm
&gt; not really mentally with it at the moment... damn flu...
&gt; -- 

In any case by basic assertaion tqht you can have multiple users via one
connection still stands. I ahve seen no  evidence no matter how well or
poorly put together to the contrary in your reply.
