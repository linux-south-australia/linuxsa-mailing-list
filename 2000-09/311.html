Paul!

&gt; How come they stop at four?

Becuase Linus can't count further :-P

&gt;  Are the various log files cleaned out every
&gt; month, then replaced by blank text files, or do the file numbers
&gt; increase (e.g. one day you'd have boot.log.17 or some such)?  Is four
&gt; some kind of magic number at work here?

You've got it. On a default RH system running CRON it runs a package
called "logrotate". The default setup for logrotate allows 4 logs and
dumps the fourth oldest one...you should try looking at man logrotate
for a full description. You might want to fiddle with how it rotates
your logs while you're at it...

&gt; And is there some kind of Linux system log file writer or process (that
&gt; knows about /var/log), or do the various processes (e.g. cron) just
&gt; write text files and they happen to stick them in /var/log as a sort of
&gt; agreed-upon place to write log files?

Well, yes and no. There is syslogd (man syslog or man syslogd - I've
forgotten which) and by convention most things do log SOMEWHERE in
/var/log....but they don't HAVE to...

&gt; And if you write a program that writes a log of its activity (such as a
&gt; password script that logs all accesses), would you write the results to
&gt; /var/log or is this directory set aside for systems programs only?

No. I would advise you to learn how to use the services of syslog which
I've referred to above. I'm not about to give a tutorial on using it but
you can use syslog from C, C++, Perl, Python and even assembler....

&gt; The questions I've got here might be pretty trivial or maybe dumb, but
&gt; as I said:  "newbie queries."

Oh not really. What is a trivial or dumb question?
