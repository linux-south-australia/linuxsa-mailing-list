Hi Andrew,

David is trying to avoid me being found out on an embarassing situation. I 
upgraded RPM to the new version and it had a bug and wouldn't work properly. 
I tried an earlier version and when I was in GNORPM I saw that version 4 was 
still there and I deleted it. aarrrggghhh. That was the end of RPM. On 
Saturday night we finally found a tar.gz of RPM and were able to install that.

Does anyone know how hard it was to find a tar.gz version of RPM (bloody 
hard).

Robyn

&gt; Regarding upgrade to an RPM 4 capable rpm system:
&gt; &gt; I just thought that I'd give you a warning about the new RPM. Before
&gt; &gt; installing the new RPM make absolutely certain that you know how to
&gt; &gt; build the old RPM from source in case the new RPM decides that it is
&gt; &gt; going to fail. Here's the basic steps to recompiling the new RPM (and in
&gt; &gt; fact, any source distribution that is based on the GNU coding
&gt; &gt; standards):
&gt;
&gt; On a RedHat system at least, you would be doing yourself a big favour
&gt; by avoiding the compilation and simply installing the suggested update
&gt; from the errata ...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I am sure the other RPM based distributions would have done the same.
&gt;
&gt; Just seems like a bad idea to start compiling software with the
&gt; central tool used to keep your system uptodate.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
