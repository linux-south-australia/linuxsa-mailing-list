&gt;&gt;Someone told me they run 400 Mbits/sec continuously on 3 ATM

&gt;&gt;not each.) That was on a P III/600 or something.

&gt;The problem with using PC-based routers is that they're designed to sit at
&gt;the edge of networks (or rather, networks are designed to have them at the
&gt;edge), the PCI bus is only capable of 132Mbits/s, so even if you put 5 ATM

Ummm, last time I looked, the PCI bus was capable of 133MB/s and 64-bit PCI
goes twice as fast as that.

&gt;cards in the PCI slots on a new P3, you're still only going to see an
&gt;aggregate of just over 100Mbits of throughput. Don't even start thinking
&gt;that a Gigabit PCI network card is going to be useful, unless you have some
&gt;need for jumbo frames. Sticking 4x 100Mbit cards in a PC is only going to
&gt;slow down a network that could use a switch instead. Also remember that
&gt;those old 486's can only push 5.5Mb/s at best on the ISA bus without some
&gt;radical overclocking.
&gt;
&gt;Some of the 64bit PCI stuff should be able to push around a lot more data,
&gt;but there only ever seems to be one of them in a machine (sparc/alpha/xeon

Ummm, any PC with more than four PCI slots has more than one PCI bus, with
a separate bridge chip per bus.

Big Iron Alphas have lost of PCI busses, as many as 12 or more. I imagine
that it is the same with SPARC as well. Certainly it is true of big Intel
servers.

&gt;hardware). Some of the latter hardware can come with multiple buses for
&gt;greater total throughput, such as that seen in the Mindcraft benchmarks.
