rsh is a TCP/IP protocol.  ssh is a TCP/IP protocol.  Where rsh
runs, ssh runs.  And vice versa.  Or do you mean "internet" in
the Internet sense?

&gt; If you have access to the system at all, it means you
&gt; have been able to guess a telephone number (not impossible) guess how
&gt; the access works (ppp, plain) guess the password, then guess the
&gt; username, then guess the machine name to connect to, then guess what the
&gt; hell you want to do now.

Remember that system cracking existed long before the Internet (as the
global lump it is now) did.  Do you know the etymology of the phrase
"War Dialer"?

In software and systems development, I have seen too many systems that
were designed in isolation like this.  Then, later on someone gets the
bright idea to attach it to the Internet, because, "hey, it's like all
the rage, you know?".  Suddenly you have systems exposure on a grand
scale.  Then trying to retroactively add security to such a system
introduces more kludges and holes.

(There exists a cable modem management system built entirely around the
ability to rsh as root, which the company who designed has apparently
stated that it would be "too hard" to refit it more securely.  There's
a system that inspires confidence.)

&gt; There is a mentality that Alan has pointed out, "you dont need triple
&gt; DES crypto from one side of their living room to the other"

There is if you have glass walls or windows in your living room.  Both
the systems that Alan was talking about (his own and Robyn's) _are_
accessible externally.  If their external firewall is breached, it's
game over.  Security is about layers.  If you have one layer and it's
pierced, then you're compromised.
