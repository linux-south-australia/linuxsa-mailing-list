&gt; Since the upgrade I am unable to get a link beat with the onboard

&gt; of you have had the same problem and have already been down this
&gt; path.

Just FYI, I have a eepro100 on an Intel motherboard working with
a stock RedHat 6.2.

The eepro100s, to put it mildly, "kinda suck".  The standard driver
(which I think is a Donald Becker job) continually emits warnings
about a stuck transmitter or receiver (I forget which), followed
by long periods of basically no network activity (this is on several
mothierboards of different manufacturer with the above chipset).
Intel now offer their own Linux drivers, which you can compile and
install as a module, but from the performance I suspect that it
suffers from the same problem, and they've just removed the warning
messages.  I ended up sticking an Etherlink III in that particular
box and never looked back (forwards, or sideways).

Intel: they make CPUs with a high Lovelace factor, now they're
doing the same for NICs.
