Okay, now we know all about ssh, and it's difficult to think
of much more that one could want to know.
However....

Now suppose there are 3 windows (that legacy OS) users who
want to publish their artwork to my humble website.
I recommend they get "putty". They find an scp command called 
"pscp". First there's the good <A HREF="news:">news:</A>

There's an -ls parameter - which I bet does a directory listing.
That helps to make up the funcationality deficit between
scp and ftp. The user can list with "scp -ls", and then do the 
file transfers - not blind as would be necessary in the case
of the unix "scp".
Well, I guess the remote execution "ssh cmd [args]" form of
ssh should be okay anyway.

But now the bad <A HREF="news:">news:</A> it seems that the user can do:

    scp filename <A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>:/tmp/filename

This is not really desirable, I think.
I've been told you can limit an FTP login with a
guest account which uses chroot.
But I don't see how to do this kind of limitation with scp.

Question:

Does anyone have suggestions on how to limit "scp"
usage to the user's own account?
And does it have anything at all to do with the shell
specified for the user in the passwd/shadow files?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I think even more undesirable is

    pscp -ls <A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>:/etc

I guess I'm really showing my ignorance of how to
limit user access here. I've mostly concentrated on how
to get things _done_ on unix systems, not how to _stop_
people doing things.
Should I be using some sort of restricted shells here?
