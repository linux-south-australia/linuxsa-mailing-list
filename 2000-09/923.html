Quoting Stephen Donaldson &lt;<A HREF="mailto:steve@cyberqual.com">steve@cyberqual.com</A>&gt;:

&gt; Everyone has a comfort zone, analyze this list for example and you will see
&gt; who has
&gt; strengths in what area and so forth. The network people are good at
&gt; networks.
&gt; programmers with programs etc. etc.  Ask them to exchange their roles and
&gt; learn
&gt; something new from scratch and just watch the fireworks.  Example how would
&gt; David L
&gt; fit into hospitality industry? How well would Mathew G fit in with working
&gt; on
&gt; gardens and landscaping?.  How would you like to be forced into it?

Hmmm. Might give brain a little rest.... and as long as I don't have to go back to hospitality.
;-)

&gt; 
&gt; The point is, teachers are given cirriculum they do NOT choose it.  It does
&gt; not fit
&gt; all of their interests and many if not all of them have little or no
&gt; computer
&gt; experience.

I agree completely. This is one of the major problems of our Education system. Teachers trying
to teach things they know nothing about. Obviously, this is not the teacher's fault, but it
doesn't make it OK.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyways change and one's ability to "manage" change is just as difficult
&gt; for
&gt; teachers as it is for anyone.  Maybe even more so given the current
&gt; political
&gt; climate.  Low staffing numbers, cut budgets, a government that has NO
&gt; figgin idea

Or just doesn't care.

&gt; about what its trying to achieve create a low moral base to start with.  If
&gt; teachers had resources and were provided with appropriate training it may
&gt; not be as
&gt; bad as you imaging.

Ever tried getting a teacher in for P.D. after hours? Which I can understand, sometimes I wish
I still had school holidays ;-)

&gt; 
&gt; Other points:
&gt; Technological velocity = the speed at which technology changes I remember
&gt; getting
&gt; my 300baud modem connected to the net (shudder) way before Mosaic was born
&gt; and that
&gt; was not long ago.
&gt; 
&gt; Most IT people I know are ONLY IT and they barely keep up, in fact some of
&gt; them
&gt; can't. Or will we say they won't keep up?

Agreed.

&gt; 
&gt; Teachers do a great deal more than work in one area. (and that does not
&gt; count
&gt; managing parents of kids sheesh)

Hmmm. Baby Sitting. I fully understand that they have a great deal to do, but so do a great
deal of other position, and they are still expected to keep up.

&gt; &gt; If it's to do with change, they aren't interested. If you give them the
&gt; &gt; opportunity to learn it and they decline, sometimes you need to drop
&gt; &gt; them in it.
&gt; 
&gt; (sigh) Someone get rose pruners  I need to cut his broad brush ;-)

It happens in other industries.

Anyway, that's probably more than enough from me.
