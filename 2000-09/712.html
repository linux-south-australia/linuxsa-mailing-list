Telstra can't really tell if you have Masq. as it appears to be comming
from
the one box.

I would imagine that if you asked Telstra, they'd say that you would
have to
use the 'Small Business ADSL Service' instead of home..

But really, they can't go into your house or whatever and poke around
without
your prior consent.

If I had ADSL in my area, I would definately be doing that.. It's just
like
doing the same for ISDN, Frame Relay, FDDI etc...

I don't think Telstra won't be actively fighting against this, as
policing
it would be an absolute nightmare.

&gt; Has anyone read the fine print on the Helstra ADSL stuff?
&gt; 
&gt; If you buy your Internet access off them (reasonable package, including the
&gt; cost of ADSL gear) you are allowed to have only one user per connection.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, this refers to only one computer connected, and only one person sitting
&gt; at that computer.  What happens if I connect my gateway/firewall/etc to the
&gt; ADSL modem and then use IPMasq to "pretend" that many users are only one
&gt; user?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone come up agains this yet?  What do you think Telstra will do about
&gt; that?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
