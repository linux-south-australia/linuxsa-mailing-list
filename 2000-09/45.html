Hi everyone,

I've been trying to setup a 486 with a new hdd and been experiencing some
problems.

The box is a Win95 revision B box :-(

I've installed a new Western Digital 15gb hard disk. Obviously the drive is
not supported by the bios, but I have used the Western Digital Datalifeguard
tools utility to install EZ Bios which allows for large disks to work to
their full potential with MS OS's. Normally i've never had any problems with
this. I've installed 20gb Western Digital drives in 386's using EZ Bios
without any problems and all has been well, but with this system, the EZ
Bios just refuses to work with the Mainboard BIOS, so when it gets to boot,
the system just halts.

I've already transferred all the data from the old drive to the new one, and
I've booted off a linux boot disk and I can mount /dev/hda1 without any
problems and I can read all of the data on the disk without any problems and
it is reporting 14gb free so there is nothing wrong with the drive.

There were two solutions I though I could do to fix the problem. The first
was just to throw in a different motherboard which will support the drive /
ez bios. Instead I though, rather than rooting around with hardware, why not
make a boot floppy with lilo on it, and instruct it to boot /dev/hda1.

So my question is: how do i make a boot floppy with lilo on it which boots
/dev/hda1 !

Cheers,
Jeremy
