&gt;&gt; In terms of promotion, organisation, etc... I'd suggest that we
&gt;&gt; attempt to work together much closer than we did this time -- and
&gt;&gt; seeing as we will have the one date, this will force us to do
&gt;&gt; so...
&gt;
&gt;Hmm.  I'm not sure this is a good idea.  If we work more closely
&gt;together, there will be some people who would potentially be able to
&gt;attend in multiple locations, for example national computer press
&gt;people.  Obviously this would only work if they were at different
&gt;times.

true, but not as significant as you may suspect... the people "in demand"
will be prominent Open source / Linux developers, company reps, and media.
Developers are distributed anyway, so each group would get it's fair share
of developers. I'm sure we could spread out company reps and sponsorship
dollars somehow. And Media -- increase the publicity, and we'll get more
media... :P

You are sort of right here though, but I think that the potential for
publicity that we could get from having a Nation-wide event would outweigh
the problems (there's only one way to find out, anyway :)

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, if we can make some sort of projection or target for numbers
&gt;&gt; of people, PCs, and installs, it could generate interest...
&gt;
&gt;Well, how do you estimate it?

LinuxSA got 350 people last time. I estimate we'd get 400 this time. Do same
around australia, come up with 1,500, make it a target... easy :)

&gt;
&gt;With my AUUG hat on, what can AUUG do to help?  At our last committee
&gt;meeting we agreed that we would very much like to help in this kind of
&gt;event, and I think we're in a position to do so, especially since
&gt;we're a nation wide organization.  Questions to you:
&gt;
&gt;1.  Were you happy with the AUUG involvement in the last Installfest?

I think we were -- although it did seem like an individual effort from AUUG
members, rather than an AUUG effort :)

&gt;2.  Is there something more we can do?

If AUUG were to get behind the national event, it would (I imagine) do both
AUUG and the Linux groups a world of good. Financial backing would be good,
as would pulling strings with media contacts... The insurance was
excellent...

&gt;3.  Are there things which we could have done better, or just kept out
&gt;    of altogether?

Hmm... Nothing I can think of, but if we go ahead with a national event this
year, we'll need to be more organised, and earlier... it could help if AUUG
joing with Linux Australia to make it happen in a co-ordinated manner...

&gt;    
&gt;One possibility would be to declare a nationwide installfest as a
&gt;cooperation between AUUG and each individual Linux user group.  As I'm

and Linux Australia.

&gt;sure you know, the SA event was by far the most successful, and AFAIK
&gt;it was the only one in which AUUG was involved :-)

heh -- There were a lot of factors involved in making SA such a success, and
AUUG was but one of them :)
