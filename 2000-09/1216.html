&gt; 
&gt; Agreed.  I happen to think that tar meets that minimum level.

I would say that tar pretty well exceeds the minimum level... the
user/administrator must know what is going on with the box, what is installed,
what needs to be installed and what will break.  REmoving packages is just as
bad.

Package management is just another option.  If you don't like it, don't use
it.

The beauty of a package management system is that is allows users with minimal
knowledge to get started in systems like Linux without needing to fully
understand things.  As their understanding increases, their needs increase
(needs drive understanding up).

I have found this just now when trying to upgrade to XFree4.0.1.  I had a hell
of a time using RPM, and eventually I resorted to downloading the binaries and
using tar.  It was not so bad.  Using the tar approach gave me flexibility
about what parts of the package I installed and what parts I didn't.

Lately, I have found packaged binary distributions of software to be a
hinderance, not a help.  They are usually compiled with minimal optimisations
and for early (i386) hardware.  Also, I run a constantly changing system so
canned installs tend to break dependencies.

&gt; You forgot to add that many system administrators discourage their users
&gt; from exploring, for example by over use of chroot environments, and by
&gt; stupid menu shells, and so on.  Groucho Marx said that if ten people tell
&gt; you you're drunk, fall down.  You keep mumbling the mantra, "it's too hard
&gt; for your pretty head to understand," and then wonder why your users act
&gt; like lusers.  There's a lesson here for you.

I find at home here that everyone is scared by the "hugeness" of Linux, and
the seemingly endless bounds that it presents (especially with exported
filesystems being automounted).  MY father is scared of logging in and storing
things on the networked drives so he can use them from any PC.  To him the
logon process allows other users to see his files and play with his machine
while he is logged on.... I didn't tell him that I could do that if the
machine were just sitting there turned on...

I think that the original poster (forgot who) was getting at the point that he
doesnt like canned installs.  I feel the same way, when I can build most
software from scratch and install it.  That gives me the benefits of optimised
code for my PC.

The issue is that most PC users are not gurus like many of us on the list tend
to assume.  They are average schmoes that just want their PC to turn on and
run their word processor/spreadsheet/game without having to think about it. 
They don't really care what OS or what software, as long as it does the job
without them turning their brains on.  This is where package management stems
from.

All said and done, I'd prefer if I could sit down and use my computer for
hacking/coding and getting my uni work done than have to worry about
installing packages.  Unfortunately I fall into the same catagory as most home
users; those not blessed with much free time.  I like package management
because it allows me to easily upgrade, and takes care of dependencies and the
like.

Just my $0.02 (tax ex) worth.

Cheers,
Adam
