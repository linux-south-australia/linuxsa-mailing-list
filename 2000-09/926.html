&gt; Quick survey:

&gt; We run a Travan 20GB backup drive and a tar backup out of a cron job seems
&gt; to run fine so far.
&gt; Apart from the tape I dropped and the plastic popped off the metal base and
&gt; jammed the tape. :-)

&gt; Questions from my Boss....

&gt; How do the folks on the LinuxSA list rate the Travan 20GB tapes & drives???

Well I haven't used the 20Gb drive. The 2 Gb ones worked well under
Winblows but I haven't tried them under Linux. The only problem I had
with the travan's were that they were relatively slow and not very
standard in a server environment (more of a personal backup drive).

&gt; We hear the Travan is cheap and nasty solution, about half the cost of 8GB
&gt; SCSI DAT.

I have a Sony SDT-7000 DDS-2 tape drive which has never given me any
problems. It's, only 4Gb native, which is getting a bit small even for
home use, and they are more expensive, but the backups are relatively
fast, quite reliable and DDS is on of the two standard backup systems
found in a server environment (the other being DLT - if your're
serious about large volume backups, DLT is the go).

&gt; So what backup hardware do folks use and in your DIRECT EXPERIENCE what has
&gt; gone flaky & failed.

Having said that, we had a Dec server at my last job which had a Sony
SDT-5000 DDS-2 drive in it that continually ate tapes for midnight
snacks.
