I'm sure my weekly quota of posts is nearly up, but....

While trying to work out what someone was doing telnetting in
to one of my machines, I transferred a tcpdump log file from
a SuSE 6.4 machine to a pair of SuSE 6.2 machines and
a redhat 5.2 machine.

On these machines, both "tcpdump" and "ethereal" said that
the log files was _not_ a log file.
They wouldn't touch it.

So I thought the older OS distributiosn might have
out-of-date software.
So I remade tcpdump on the SuSE 6.2 machine.
Still no luck.

So then I downloaded the latest tcpdump and ethereal
to the SuSE 6.4 machine.
Well, the "ethereal" demanded all kinds of things
which weren't there, like glib-config, gtk-config,
and the new GTK software said I had no X library
etc. etc. etc. etc.

So at least I thought I might get the "tcpdump"
to work.
After re-making it on the SuSE 6.4 machine and creating
a log file with it, it did this on the SuSE 6.2 and
redhat machines:

tcpdump: unknown data link type 0x65

Question:
Has anyone seen this before?

Maybe I've got some new, novel PPP protocol that
tcpdump doesn't understand.
But it is udnerstood on the machine that creates
the log file.

By the way, I'm really very disappointed with SuSE 6.4.
There are numerous nuisances with SuSE 6.4 that were
find and dandy with SuSE 6.2.
And now they've doubled the price of SuSE 7.0
relative to earlier editions.
So now I'm wondering where a refugee from RedHat
and SuSE might go.
Isn't life a bother!

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
