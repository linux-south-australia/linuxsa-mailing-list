Glen,

There's an interesting corollary to this:

Any linux distribution you buy right now is going to be
secure for 6 months maximum.
If you don't read security advisories every week, then you'll
have to wipe your distribution and install a new one in 12 months.

I used to say that the big bad thing about MS OSs is the fact
that they compel you to get a new OS every 2 years.

But the lifetime of a linux distribution is more like 12 months.

With the prices of linux distributions like redhat and suse
having doubled in the last 12 months, I think that the
advantages of linux are being whittled away.

If linux and MS have the same use-by date, same price...
and linux requires 10 times as much maintenance...
and MS has 10 times as much support from everyone in the universe...
well, why would anyone but a computer scientist get linux?

I think that rock-solid security is clearly achievable out of
the box. But all the distributers are competing on functionality,
not security. Well many of them.

If someone came out with a fully-featured distribution, like SuSE,
but with rock-solid security, then it should sell a lot better,
especially if there's a fully-functioned "security GUI".

Anyway, I've already used up my time/energy budget for computer
security matters for the next 5 years. 
So I'm hoping to minimise my efforts on this in future.

Now what is the mantra again?
Is it "allow everything by default, and plug the holes"?
Or was it "stick it on the net out of the box and see what happens"?
My memory is failing me.
I'd better look back through my archives.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
