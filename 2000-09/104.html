Hi Alan,

I'm not connecting to a remote machine over the net I'm only telnetting to my 
server which is right here (ie same room).

Is this OK?

&gt;
&gt; Robyn,
&gt;
&gt; "ssh" or "openssh" is a safe alternative to "telnet".
&gt; It's like the SSL of the telnet world.
&gt; I think it originated in the BSD world.
&gt; The idea is that it uses challenge-response
&gt; authentication instead of sending passwords in
&gt; clear over the net.
&gt; Therefore it is (fairly) immune to replay attacks.
&gt; The "ssh" documentation gives a description of how
&gt; they defeat various categories of attacks.
&gt;
&gt; AT present, I keep connections open between machines on
&gt; two different sites, and I always use "ssh".
&gt; In fact, I turn off "telnet" completely on my most
&gt; important site, just incase I forget...
&gt;
&gt; In this way, I can log in from a company overseas to my
&gt; home computer over the net, without the company I contract
&gt; for logging my passwords.
&gt; The software for ssh is at <A HREF="http://www.openssh.com/.">http://www.openssh.com/.</A>
&gt; Beware of openssh.org, which is a cybersquatter site.
&gt;
&gt; Recently, someone in the States gave me an account on his
&gt; BSD machine. And he put a normal password in the system,
&gt; and I was able to use SSH in the normal way, using this
&gt; password.
&gt; But there's another useful mode of SSH which bypasses the
&gt; usual mechanisms and uses some other sort of cryptography
&gt; with encrypted public/private keys etc.
&gt; It's all in the documentation anyway.
&gt; It's all very technical...
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt; PS.  Sorry, I haven't the time to write a PS.
&gt; Too many things to do today...
