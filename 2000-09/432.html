&gt; Yes, but given the state of the NT packet forwarding/filtering code, it

Oh, well that's functional! [1]  :-)

&gt; (I actually heard once that MS were going to embed NT in
&gt; routers and firewalls, anyone heard this for a fact?).

MS' game plan is to install NT/derivatives _everywhere_, whether
it's applicable or not (witness their entry into the embedded
devices market, where 8 bit microcontrollers like the 8051
still reign supreme).  They'll use their "marketing might"
to achieve these goals regardless, because they make their
money through volume.

Would YOU want WinCE running on your pacemaker?
