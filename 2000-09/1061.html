&gt; Let me teach you one thing: if you work with computers you must keep

I always feel that IT attracts more deviant personalities than any
other occupation (except politicians, and maybe flight attendants).

&gt; It helps to keep one sane.

I think it helps stop one from wigging out _completely_[1].  I
doubt sanity factors into it much.

&gt; It helps to relabel programing errors as bugs.

"Features."

&gt; It helps if you actually work out whether the person on the other
&gt; end of the e-mail is bein serious, half hearted or even funny.

Unfortunately, I've adopted this habit lately (in real life as
well as email) of saying things jokingly in deadpan mode (I
think Kryten had a mode like this).  It seems to add to the
continuing confusion that is I.T., but my care factor is
negative.

[1] Which reminds me of the joke I saw on /. about why the
    suicide rate amongst RDBMS programmers are so high;  seems
    they kept jumping off buildings, then just before they
    hit the ground they'd shout out "Rollback!"[2]

[2] Another reason to use Postgresql over MySQL :-)[3]

[3] Look! Smiley!  Means joke.
