&gt; I would like to ask you all what MTA you use. Sendmail (Ug..), Qmail,
&gt; Postfix or whatever.. I am interested in hearing what you have to say about
&gt; these products and what your experiences have been.

I like Qmail personally. 

It's biggest attraction initially was the relative ease involved in
setting it up for single-UID POP3 accounts. This means that people using
the mailboxes don't need a real user account on the system, so you can
keep system permissions simple, or use Qmail in an environment where
your user database is not in /etc/passwd (ie: even an NT domain).

The maildir format it can use for storing mail is also very nice, as you
no longer need to worry about mboxes being locked for access, and
getting a list of messages no longer involves reading the whole mail
file.

Qmail's modular nature makes it easy to hack to do cool stuff, and also
means that mail doesn't get lost if something breaks. If 'qmail' itself
(qmail-send) falls in a heap, qmail-smtpd keeps accepting messages and
putting them in the queue on disk, where they'll be delivered when qmail
is restarted.

Most of Qmail's features and functionality can be achieved with
sendmail, but it's nearly always through some obscure sendmail.cf entry
that's poorly documented. I can't speak for anyone else, but sendmail.cf
looks to me a like a bunch of monkeys hammered on a keyboard with the
shift-lock left on. Since I have no need for UUCP, qmail is more
pleasant to work with.
