Alan!

&gt; Now that suggests something.....

I am going to have a lot of FUN with this EMAIL!

&gt; Why not have a set of informal linuxSA howtos?

The LinuxSA Howtos, variously coauthored and written, happen to be at :

* <A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/</A>

Unless the ALIENS have zapped your computer, installed a trojan SSH and
redirected any request from your SSH to Geoffrey's LinuxSA web server, I
think you might agree that this is a TIPS page :-P

&gt; If it could be automated (using "scp" etc.?)

ROFL

rsync - they told you and us three times last night - rsync over
ssh!!!!!!!

&gt; perhaps a web site such as linuxsa.org.au could be
&gt; used as a repository of linuxSA HOWTO documents.

But it IS!

&gt; Not just seminar notes, but whenever there has been
&gt; a hot topic in the mailing list (or otherwise)

LOL

I can see the 'HOWTO Crack Alan's Network Tip' already!!!!

&gt; one or more people could summarise the results
&gt; in a quick ascii or html file for posterity.

Provided they don't argue about what the actual results are. For
example, the postgres vs mysql debate. The best one could say is that
they're both good for their purposes and there was, in essence, a rather
heated, well (sometimes well) debated argument. Not a terribly useful
document.

And HOW, might I ask, would you create a Virgin Mary HOWTO [tm]? Or a
English Ain't His Mother (AHEM....father....OOPS....parental) Tongue
HOWTO? Or an RTFM Howto - i.e. why write a HOWTO read HOWTO's if people
don't write HOWTOs?

&lt;yikes...tooo damned early.....&gt;
