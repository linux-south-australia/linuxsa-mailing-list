I originally sent this from my auug.org.au account, but the linuxsa
list manager bounced it.  Apologies if you get this twice.  Please
reply to this address, for obvious reasons.

&gt;&gt; I'm in the process of finalising an article about Perth's
&gt;&gt; installfest. This brings to an end Installfest 2000 but surely only
&gt;&gt; marks the beginning of many such events.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Does anyone have any ideas about how a national "installfest" event
&gt;&gt; should be handled in order to better promote Linux to the wider
&gt;&gt; community? I know that the original idea (and it is a good one) was
&gt;&gt; to have a national install day across every city in the country
&gt;&gt; which is willing to participate.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any other thoughts, ideas or comments will be welcome.
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest that someone just declares a date, and gives 2 weeks
&gt; for it to get around, and without any really really good objections,
&gt; that becomes the national (global?) date. The person suggesting the
&gt; date would really want to be the one co-ordinating the national
&gt; effort... any volunteers?  Hmmm... just got an email from Anand (who
&gt; spelt my surname wrong -- it's Russell, not Russel... :) suggesting
&gt; August 26th -- sounds fine to me...
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, I'd suggest around the same time of year...
&gt; July/August/September or thereabouts... Of course, the sooner we
&gt; make the date, the better, in some ways... Also, there has been some
&gt; talk here at LinuxSA of doing a summer installfest... comments?
&gt;
&gt; In terms of promotion, organisation, etc... I'd suggest that we
&gt; attempt to work together much closer than we did this time -- and
&gt; seeing as we will have the one date, this will force us to do
&gt; so...

Hmm.  I'm not sure this is a good idea.  If we work more closely
together, there will be some people who would potentially be able to
attend in multiple locations, for example national computer press
people.  Obviously this would only work if they were at different
times.

&gt; Also, if we can make some sort of projection or target for numbers
&gt; of people, PCs, and installs, it could generate interest...

Well, how do you estimate it?

With my AUUG hat on, what can AUUG do to help?  At our last committee
meeting we agreed that we would very much like to help in this kind of
event, and I think we're in a position to do so, especially since
we're a nation wide organization.  Questions to you:

1.  Were you happy with the AUUG involvement in the last Installfest?
2.  Is there something more we can do?
3.  Are there things which we could have done better, or just kept out
    of altogether?

One possibility would be to declare a nationwide installfest as a
cooperation between AUUG and each individual Linux user group.  As I'm
sure you know, the SA event was by far the most successful, and AFAIK
it was the only one in which AUUG was involved :-)

/me ducks before the tomatoes and rotten eggs fly.
