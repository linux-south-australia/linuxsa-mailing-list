&gt; &gt; P.S. The same in regards to ADSL in Adelaide (I know there's no
&gt; &gt; active ADSL in Adelaide yet, I mean future plans (then again if an
&gt; &gt; ISP supports linux for normal Modem dialup they'll probably do it for
&gt; &gt; ADSL (well that's kinda obvious (don'tcha just love parenthesis)))
&gt; &gt; think that's all the parenthisis closed :&gt; ).
&gt;
&gt; Helstra support Linux for dialup, don't they??? AFIK for ADSL you _MUST_
&gt; have Windows95/98/NT/2000/ME for their ADSL PCI card to operate... you'd
&gt; think they'd just give you an ADSL modem that connects to your ethernet
&gt; (like a lot of satellite internet providers do).
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had any success with Linux and the ADSL card from Telstra
&gt; (probably not anyone in Adelaide), because I would like to move this way
&gt; when the service is available, and I can afford it.  However, I DO NOT
&gt; want to run my ADSL connection under Winblows(goates!) because that
&gt; would mean that my connection would be down more often than it is up!

We are getting Telstra to install an ADSL link here at work. They've
arranged to come out this Thursday morning to do it. I'll let everyone know
how we get on.

The way we are going to have it set up is an external ADSL modem that does
connect to a 10baseT network card. When I spoke to the Telstra technician,
he said all we need to run it under linux is a PPPoE program, and something
that will send PAP/CHAP authentication details. I have a site for a PPPoE
program bookmarked at home which I plan on using. Guess we'll see how it
works on Thursday...
