Hi,

&gt; I first installed Slackware 7.1 a little while ago, about 2 or 3 weeks
&gt; after it was released and I must say that it is one of the (if not,
&gt; THE) best distributions around.  One of the things I like best about it is
&gt; how it handles packages.  It does it sensibly.  They are very simple, just
&gt; gzipped tarballs that extract from the / directory (unless you specify
&gt; otherwise), and execute a single-run install script if necessary.  I find
&gt; this approach, although it could be considered 'utilitarian,' very quick,
&gt; easy and effective.  Slackware packages exist for one reason, to save
&gt; people from compiliing from source, and they serve this purpose extemely
&gt; well.  They don't ask for dependancies, that is your repeonsibility
&gt; (dependancies, if there are any would of course be stated in the README
&gt; file), and when you install or uninstall, they take only their own files,
&gt; warning you if any new files have been created in directories unique to
&gt; that package.  Simple but extremely effective.  You can even convert rpms
&gt; to Slack pkgs - great for getting those Mozilla includes without getting
&gt; the whole source tarball =)

How does it handle a database of installed packages, does it exist ? What
about versioned dependecies ?

Consider a generic Unix box. How doe we get software installed ?

We can get a manufacturer distributed install, and let them handle
versioning, but limit ourselves severly in available software.

We can obtain source and compile ourselves. This is fine, but requires
some knowledge of our system, and already installed software and hardware,
and also likely a bit of C. This limits who can install, or if many people
are installing, it becomes a problem to handle versioning etc.

We can obtain a preconfigured tarball type thing, where install consists
of tar xzf, and maybe running a script. Saves the C knowledge part of the
problem, but keeps the system knowledge, and coordination problem there.

We can use some form of package management. This has an advantage of
attempting to solve the dependencies, versioning, conflicts etc
problems. It means that less skilled people can maintain software, whilst
the more skilled can solve real problems.

I don't think any of the solutions is perfect, and package management has
a long way to go on any Unix (take IRIXs manager for instance), but I
don't dismiss RPM outright, I've rarely had a problem with them.

cya
