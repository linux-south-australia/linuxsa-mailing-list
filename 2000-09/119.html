&gt;Maybe my explanation of my problem was a bit back to front. Essentially,
&gt;it appears that http speaks on ports which are assigned by IANA to
&gt;services that are and have been hacked (like socks, and even the X
&gt;ports)...I was attempting to work out how to let an http continuation or
&gt;request through but not the IANA defined service.
&gt;
&gt;It looks like one can't and one just has to cross one's fingers and hope
&gt;that your web client realises that something is wrong and makes another
&gt;request and hopefully "selects" a port that you can use...

Ummm, no. The source port is chosen, probably monotonically increasing,
from ports above 1023 when a client places a connection request.

In a client, when you create a socket, you bind it to an address. You
select INADDR_ANY for the local IP and port, with the Dest IP and port
specified by you.

The TCP layer allocates one of the local IP addresses as the source IP, and
selects a local port as the source port, selecting the next available port
number above 1023.

There are cases where you want to use all four of SrcIP, SrcPort, DestIP,
DestPort, you really can only do that if you are keeping state. When you do
that, you gain extra security.
