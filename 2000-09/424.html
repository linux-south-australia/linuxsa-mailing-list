Hey ppl
&gt;Anyone, repeat, ANYONE connecting to the 'net (yes, even dialup)
&gt;should have *some* protection.

Ansil Firewalls?

Sorry couldnt resist.

Leigh, I think the orginal poster was sharing with us the method in which
he was compromised. And from memory, they did no harm to his but used his
stuff as a means of getting to somewhere else.

It's kinda sad but you're right the writing has been on the wall. 

I have been guilty of ignorance, and dare i say as a lot of others, I have
had a need for Linux for my work/studies and as such have ensured my work
is backed up to other hosts (mostly) I have not had time for anything
better. Secondly, the casual dismissal of spend a few hours reading
ipchains rules is not rearly fare on some people I for one frankly dont
understand them and would prefer an easier to use interface.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Once again, it's lack of time.  No one's paying me $100 an hour
&gt;&gt; &gt; to do this.  I'm _losing_ $100 per hour by doing this security work.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I certainly wouldn't say that your losing $100 per hour, look at it
&gt;&gt; as an investment in knowledge for yourself and possibly others, that
&gt;&gt; certainly can't be a waste of time.
&gt;
&gt;Or look at it another way - if the orignal poster had spent 5 hours
&gt;looking at securing the box in the first place, instead of engaging
&gt;the complacency centre of their brain, they would have prevented
&gt;themselves from wasting 10 hours or more *after* they got broken
&gt;into :-)
&gt;
&gt;And yes, it is complacency - those who plead ignorance of security
&gt;are making sad excuses, the writing is on the wall nearly every
&gt;day now.
&gt;
&gt;Just overnight it was reported on "Today" that a US bank has
&gt;recommended that its customers cancel all credit and debit cards
&gt;because their *WEB* site was cracked into!
&gt;
&gt;GAWD!  When will people learn that we can't leave the front door
&gt;unlocked any more, and that we *really* should have deadlocks
&gt;instead of the old vulnerable snib locks :(
&gt;
&gt;Sure, it's not our fault the world has bad people in it, but it
&gt;is our fault if we don't do anything to protect ourselves against
&gt;them!
&gt;
&gt;I've had half a dozen machines (linux, FreeBSD, Windohs and Sun)
&gt;sitting on the 'net permanently since the early 90's (thanks Mark!)
&gt;and I've not once had a personal machine of mine compromised in
&gt;any way.
&gt;
&gt;Why?
&gt;
&gt;Because I invested the time and money in setting up a simple, yet
&gt;effective firewall solution on my network.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, that meant I sat down for a few hours and worked out how ipfw
&gt;rules worked, and how to make various applications still work while
&gt;those rules were in place.
&gt;
&gt;No, it wasn't quick'n'easy, but neither is re-installing your OS
&gt;and recreating lost data.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone, repeat, ANYONE connecting to the 'net (yes, even dialup)
&gt;should have *some* protection.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone connecting to the net PERMANENTLY should have as much
&gt;protection as they can get their hands on!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I wish I got $100 per hour for my computing work :(
&gt;
&gt;I don't :)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just my 0.05 c (you try and find a 2c peice :))
&gt;
&gt;I've got a bag of 'em here somewhere :-)
&gt;
&gt;Cheers
