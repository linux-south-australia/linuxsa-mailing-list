&gt; &gt; Isn't this enough to scare most users looking for alternative workstation

&gt; 
&gt; MS Solutions aren't really that much simpler. They are at least as
&gt; insecure as modern Linux boxes. Furthermore, they tend to obscure,
&gt; obfuscate and hide their security loop holes. Just to give you an idea,
&gt; if you are running a default Windows installation of 9X or even NT, I
&gt; can probably tell you what your log in name is. Furthermore, if you're
&gt; on a network and you have a guest account and share I can probably log
&gt; into that share from my Linux system....

[....]

Just in case anyone gets the wrong idea about this,
I should explain that I do indeed take unnecessary risks.
I.e. linux security wouldn't be so bad for most people.
My risk factors are:

1.	I connect to the net 24 hours a day, while there
	are about 60 port scans every day of all my IP addresses.
	Just connecting to the net is a __big__ risk factor.

2.	I have been dealing with security on a least-effort,
	maximum-permissive basis.
	This is partly because I started on unix 15 years ago,
	when it was all cooperative between computer operators.
	People regularly logged in to each others systems to
	fix problems, transfer files, and help with this and that.
	The world was one big happy LAN.
	I miss those days.

3.	I have several different kinds of linux (and some other
	stuff), and I don't take the time to go back through
	them and make them as secure as I know how.
	I sort of trust the linux distributions to be at least
	fairly safe out of the box.
	I have about 6-7 computers to manage, and they're all
	a bit different.

Now, if I don't want to disconnect from the net, I've got to go back
and take the advice I've been receiving for so many years,
and use a default-deny policy for security.

Anyone beginning with linux should not be put off
by all the gibberish that must be talked when discussing
the nitty-gritty of security.
I only get into that myself because I have a research interest
in the matter. I also make 24 hour/day logs, since 18 months ago.
So I _can_ review the logs if I wish.
Most people would just not have the break-in in the first place,
of else they would use something like FreeVeracity to find out
what the crims did.

It's precisely because I _didn't_ use such tools that I had
to go through the logs.

Somehow there's an old Rolling Stones song coming into my mind...
it seems to be "What a drag it is growing old...".
I wonder why that comes to mind???

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
