WINDOWS TO THE WORLD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What do you expect from a window manager? Is it bells
and whistles and eye-candy galore, or is it just speed
with no noticeable features at all? 

To my mind a window manager should do as the name
suggests, manage windows and give you a clean
interface to launch your applications from. I don't
want a cluttered desktop full of icons that i will
never launch, I don't want anything that may decrease
my performance while running a high resource intensive
application. In fact, I don't even want to realize the
window manager is there.

With a 14" screen and 800x600 resolution I definitely
don't need a huge panel on the bottom like gnome, or a
top and bottom panel like KDE, and while they are
configurable they are still floating in memory. Does
anyone else agree that Enlightenment is just a race
between developers to make the most bloated software
in existence? Should we rename it EnBloatenIt?

There are only two other Window Managers I would
consider using and that's the very good but buggy
Sawmill and the old war-horse Window-Maker.

ENTER BLACKBOX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All window managers have their faults, nothing is
perfect after all. But for simplicity and speed (as
well as stability) you can't go past BlackBox. OK so
it's not so well documented, and alt-tab doesn't seem
to work, but hey it's open sourced after all. But the
best of all is that the tar ball of the source is
under 300kb. I cannot tell a lie, it is true BlackBox
is Tiny. It even comes with some simple themes; which
don't over power the screen. BlackBox is also easy to
install...Well sort of, you may need to manually move
things around and you have to manually edit the menu
file. So maybe if you are a newbie you should continue
with KDE for a while longer.

WHERE TO NOW
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use Linux, it's because you like to experiment,
lets face it that's what it's all about, so what do
you have to lose from giving BlackBox a go? 

Point lynx or the other browser to
<A HREF="http://blackbox.alug.org/">http://blackbox.alug.org/</A> and see for your self how
UN-bloated software really needs to be.
