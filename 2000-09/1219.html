&gt; The beauty of a package management system is that is allows users
&gt; with minimal knowledge to get started in systems like Linux without
&gt; needing to fully understand things.  As their understanding
&gt; increases, their needs increase (needs drive understanding up).

This aspect of package management is greatly over emphasised.  It
seems the great unwashed masses are using less package management
rather than more, i.e., I don't really rate the install shield or
whatever it is called as a package manager.

Package management is more than a mechanism to smooth installs.
It gathers a wealth of information about the state of your system.
Even if you do compile your own binaries, you would be best served by
packaging the results:

  +	so that you have a record of the exact steps taken in the
	package specification, allowing you to refine the installation
	each time you upgrade;

  +	as another mechanism to verify the integrity of the binaries
	in case of a disk failure etc.;

  +	so that you have a record of the state of the system upon
	which the compiled binaries depend;

  +	as a mechanism of recognising configuration changes made to
	the system after installing software.

etc...


It seems to me that if you compile many of your own binaries, then you
have more, rather than less, reason to be using a package manager.
