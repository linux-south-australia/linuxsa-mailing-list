Hi Evan,

&gt; Do Agile/Inode have any definite info, from my understanding if
&gt; you can get to the exchange then choice of ISP is infinite (well
&gt; wider than Tel$tra)

That was a "feature" present during the trial (called splashscreen)
that is not part of the commercial offerings from various retailers.

You will need to select an ISP who can provide you with an ADSL
service, whether that be delivered by Telstra's cable or another
carrier's unbundled local loop cable (Telstra's which has been
declared by the ACCC).  Once you choose an ISP, you won't be
able to "swap and hop" between service providers without having
a second or subsequent lines installed as the ADSL part of your
phone line is being run by your ISP's wholesale access provider.

Confused yet? :)

&gt; I have a pet hate for them given some of my friends are currently
&gt; copping the big cable problems in the east and my friends on Optus
&gt; are enjoying lag-free-high-speed gaming on all servers.

Ah, those would be the LPBs I see online from time to time :-)

&gt; So I expect the ADSL from Telstra may suffer the same problem.
&gt; Which is another reason I wont be getting it until there is enough
&gt; competition for me to chose.

Agile is currently commissioning a wholesale ADSL access service with
Telstra, and I know Internode will be offering ADSL connections through
Agile as soon as Telstra get their end of the bargain completed.

A 'register your interest' form will be set up on Internode's homepage
<A HREF="http://www.internode.on.net/">http://www.internode.on.net/</A> shortly.

Cheers
