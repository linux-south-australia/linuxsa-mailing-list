&gt; Aug  9 21:54:19 localhost sshd: error: Could not load host key:
&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key: No such file or directory
&gt; Aug  9 21:54:19 localhost sshd: sshd startup failed

Those messages mean exactly what they mean. Check it manually:

* ls /etc/ssh/ssh_host_key
* ps ax | grep sshd

&gt; Why am I getting this message?  I haven't configured or set up my
&gt; machine to run sshd (since I'm not running this machine as a host; it's
&gt; purely a desktop Linux box), but I also wouldn't know how to remove sshd
&gt; either!

You've answered this in part yourself. SSH uses ssh_host_key as a token
to identify itself and to encrypt various parts of the protocol.
Obviously if you haven't setup SSH then it can't find the host key!

&gt; So I guess I have two options:  set up the machine so it runs sshd
&gt; (which would be pointless, since I don't login to this machine), or
&gt; alter the bootup process so that it doesn't seek to run the ssh daemon.

That's absolutely correct.

&gt; How do I do the latter, or is it something I have to recompile out of
&gt; the kernel?

You need to learn about the intricacies of the Linux startup. You have
the following directory:

* /etc/rc.d

In that directory are files such as:

* /etc/rc.d/rc.local

And other directories such as:

* /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
            ^^^
You'll also see rc1, rc2 and rc5. You may see more.

At startup you have a default run level. You can find out your default
by looking in /etc/inittab and searching for a line like:

* id:3:initdefault:

The run level is the "3". This corresponds to /etc/rc.d/rc3.d [save this
for later reference]. The general run levels on my RedHat system can be
described as:

Run Level 0 - shutdown
Run Level 1 - single user
Run Level 2 - all services except network services (but a console login)
Run Level 3 - all services including network services (but a console
login)
Run Level 4 - not used
Run Level 5 - Same as 3, but X is automatically started and a graphical
login prompt is presented
Run Level 5 - shutdown

You're probably 3 or 5.

Now, in /etc/rc3.d (or rc5.d) you'll notice files with names like:

* S80httpd
* K01linuxconf

The text (httpd or linuxconf) tends to be referenced or relate to the
service to be started or killed. S means the service runs or is started.
K means the service does not run or is killed [stopped]. 

(1) Note: services don't need to be given SENSIBLE textual
names...S80ridiculous is just as valid as S80httpd if the script they
refer to conforms to the standards I'm speaking of

Despite this note, the one you're looking for would be something like:

* S55ssh

LOOK for the ssh in the name. You can manually change the S to a K:

* mv S55ssh K55ssh

HOWEVER there is a different way. If you're running a RedHat style
system, you can use the chkconfig command:

* chkconfig --level 2345 ssh off

Do a man chkconfig (or a man mv if you don't know about the mv command).
Try the chkconfig command AFTER READING CHKCONFIG'S MAN PAGES to see if
it exists on your system...
