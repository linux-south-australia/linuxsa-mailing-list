&gt; &gt; ie Mozilla isn't a subproject of GNOME.
&gt; 
&gt; I see this as the biggest problem. Mozilla and Star Office are very large
&gt; bits of functionality, and they weren't designed with either Gnome or
&gt; Gnome's Bonobo components architecture in mind. What's more until recently
&gt; both of them had as a strategic focus to be as at-home as possible in
&gt; environments where neither were present. The foregoing two sentences are
&gt; completely at odds with constructing a completely integrated, modular
&gt; environment. When we're talking about millions of lines of code, nothing
&gt; in the way of a full rewrite/overhaul happens in less than years.

I think the fact the they *are* seperate projects is the strength.  The GNOME
hackers aren't obliged to port/maintain these huge code bases that may evolve in
different directions.  Since they're both now GPL'd, projects like GNOME *and*
KDE will be able to lift useful bits and discard the bulk.

Someone might do a complete GNOM/KDE port of Moz and/or OOo, but it won't be the
core GNOME/KDE hacks.  Complete communities will/have formed around Moz/OOo,
leaving the desktop guys to, well, worry about the desktop.

Further, some (crazy) people are wanting to port OOo to PDAs.  Wow.  They're
calling it OpenOfficeLite.  Good luck.  But the point is, since they code will
be GPL'd, forking can occur to the benefit of all.

&gt; I ask myself "If the same effort were to be spent on a from-scratch
&gt; system, who'd get there first?". Then I look at the fact that pretty much
&gt; every single component of Gnome/Mozilla/Star already exists in KDE and is
&gt; already part of a very clear architecture. Some bits mightn't be as
&gt; advanced as Mozilla/Star, but when they are will it hang together better?
&gt; I don't know of course. But I don't think the Gnome and Friends project is
&gt; necessarily better placed than KDE despite the donation of millions of
&gt; lines of code.

Will be interesting to see.  Volume of code is one thing.  Sifting out stuff
that the OSS community hasn't been able to write so far itself is another.  For
example, AbiWord plans to incorporate bits of OOo that it doesn't have as soon
as it becomes available.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; I think this is the most valuable part of SO, followed by the PIM
&gt; application.

Haven't played with the PIM, but StarWriter, once bonoboised, might be a useful
addition.  It's a full-featured word processor, and from what I read, much more
advanced than anything else out there right now that's OSS.
