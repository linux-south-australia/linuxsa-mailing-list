Bruce, package management under any OS is essentially lame. For my use
at home it's almost useless. The moment you try to do something the
packagers don't want you to do - and I am speaking generically here, so
this inludes d[ickhead]pakg - you are ultimately stuffed. Not fscked.
Stuffed. I would say something else but this isn't a 18 yr old or less
mailing list...

By definition package management devolves some part of the system
administration schema from the system administrator. People from all
camps - RedHat (who have, to my knowledge never claimed their RPM's to
be the panacea for the masses, or to update automatically or any other
such crap), dpkg (Debian Package Manager - updater behind your back
extraordinaire) - have to release some semblance of control from their
system.

This is good provided you know the packages you are installing, have
checked they work and will behave themselves.

In the real world, in one of my work situations, we implement ALL
software like this:

* a need arises
* a suggestion appears
* we TEST that suggestion against numerous tests
* we put it into "beta test":
* then we put it into production

It doesn't matter whether it's RPM, dpkg or *crapolapackaged*. 

Putting it bluntly, whilst it would be most useful to have a tool which
searched for dependencies as such, the current tools rely on too much
propriatary crap - or in the case of Debian it would be GPL'ed crap.

Configure scripts can work out if gcc exists
If it works with certain flags

They can work out whether rep-gtk exists
gtk-perl exists

without RPM, d[umb]pkg or any other of this idiocy

I don't need nor do I want any of this automatic, fix it up, rubbish. I
want a working system. I have one. Without this dpkg,rpm, windows
updater shit. Let it update your system behind your back.

Just don't put it on mine.
