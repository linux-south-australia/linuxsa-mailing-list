Hi,

I am working on a project to replace an RSYNC run between two machines
every 20 minutes with something that mirrors the data at a lower layer, say
at the driver level.

I had identified two possible ways to do this. One was Philipp Reisner's
DRBD. The other (pointed out by David Lloyd) was ENBD. DRBD can be found by
searching the web. ENBD can be found on Freshmeat.

Over the weekend I tested ENBD, and yesterday, I purchased two new 15GB
drives and started testing DRBD. Because the data we are rsyncing is about
7 to 8 GB, I wanted to test with a 7GB partition, so I created a 7GB
partition to mirror between two machines.

My setup is a Dual-celeron 533 as the source and an AMD K6-2/400 as the
sink, with a 100Mb/s ethernet between the machines (crossover cable).

I expect that the customer writes between 100 and 400MB per day, and
clearly this type of mirroring is 100% write bound. To allow for adequate
safety margins, I need to achieve about 400MB/hour with acceptible CPU
utulizations (less than 40%) and reasonable load averages, however, if
there is free CPU, a high load average is not a big issue.

ENBD and DRBD take different approaches to doing their job. ENBD gives you
a device in /dev, /dev/nd?, that writes over the network to a remote file
or partition. This means that you need to use software mirroring on the
primary machine to mirror across the net.

DRBD provides a device in /dev, /dev/nb*, that writes to the two halves of
your mirror, one on the local machine, which must be a partition, and the
other over the network, which must also be a partition.

DRBD looked like it would be easier to use, because my partitions are on
RAID controllers, and I didn't like the idea of adding too many extra
driver layers into the picture. It also offers the ability to resync the
two halves of the mirrors, including bringing the mirror up after replacing
one of the mirrors. This allows you to initialize the mirror quickly.

My first problem was getting ENBD to run at all on the SMP machine. It
required a small hack on the Makefile to pass -DSMP or -D__SMP__ to all
compiles. I used Version 2.2.7 of ENBD.

Once I got it going, I found that I could I could write small files to the
network device, /dev/nda, but if I tried to write a large file, like 100MB,
it hung. I hope to give it another try tomorrow.

Next, I moved on to DRBD. I used version 0.5.7 of DRBD, and this version
compiled cleanly under RH 6.2.

I used drbdsetup to set up my mirror on both machines using the B protocol,
nominated the primary and built a file system on /dev/nb0 with mke2fs. This
all worked fine, but was slower than I was used to, and the disks rattled
on bith machines.

Then, because it was late, I left the machines running all night copying
2GB or data from a file system on the the mirrored file system, and
deleting the data and copying it again.

When I got up this morning, I thought it had crashed, but a closer
examination revealed it was copying a file of several hundred megabytes.
This looked good, so I then set about figuring out how fast it could copy
data.

I timed a copy of the pinstripe ISO image to the mirror, and it a little
over 19 minutes. This came out at 860kB/s. During the copy, the source had
plenty of free CPU, like 60%, although the load average was over 3, but
under 4. This meant that I should be able to achieve close to 2GB/hour
which was way over my need.

Now on to testing ENBD again, and looking at the packet stream and source
code for DRBD, as 860kB/s is way under what FTP can achieve, and is way
under what the disk can achieve (at 5+MB/s).
