er.. yes, that's nice, and thankyou for your input, but seeing as I could be
a number of Kms away from the machine, I can't select which image to boot...
The scenario is this: I have a new kernel to install. I install it, and set
it as the default. I reboot the machine remotely. The kernel hangs. Without
a watchdog card, that's the end of it, but supposing I had one, or some
other means of doing a hard reset (a trained monkey perhaps), what would
happen? The same kernel would boot. What I want is for the bootloader to
notice that the kernel failed, and have it boot a backup kernel instead.
Doing this shouldn't be _too_ hard... you need a watchdog card to reboot a
hung machine, and then you need a "BOOT_SUCCESS" flag on the boot sector
somewhere...

pseudocode:

Bootloader starts.
if BOOT_SUCCESS=true
  BOOT_SUCCESS=false
  boot default kernel
  kernel starts loading
  kernel finishes loading successfully
  BOOT_SUCCESS=true
else
  boot backup kernel
end if

make sense? I would have thought that this kind of thing would be easy to
implement, and would be reasonably useful to a large number of people...
even without a watchdog card, all you need is to remotely notice that after
X minutes, your machine hasn't come up, and you need to call someone on site
and tell them  to hit the button... :)

I'm surprised that this doesn't already exist...

anyway, if no-one knows about it, maybe it will exist shportly...

&gt; Yes, lilo
&gt; &gt; I want to have a system that I can remotely upgrade
&gt; &gt; the kernel, and be
&gt; &gt; pretty confident that if the kernel breaks, the old
&gt; &gt; one will be used...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; If you check /etc/lilo.conf, there you should see
&gt; entries such as:
&gt; 
&gt; image=/boot/bzImage (or /vmlinuz)
&gt; label=linux
&gt; read-only
&gt; 
&gt; or something similar. The above uses the bzImage
&gt; kernel
&gt; in /boot, and at the lilo prompt (asuming you put
&gt; "prompt in /etc/lilo.conf), you enter in "linux"
&gt; (from the label= entry above).
&gt; You can have multiple kernel images with different
&gt; labels, by adding more entries like:
&gt; 
&gt; image=/path_to_new_kernel
&gt; label=new_kernel
&gt; read-only
&gt; 
&gt; At the lilo prompt you will have the option to choose
&gt; which kernel you want to load, and if you want a
&gt; default kernel image you want to load then add
&gt; 
&gt; default=label_of_kernel_you_want_to_load
&gt; 
&gt; in /etc/lilo.conf, or you could just put the kernel
&gt; entry that you want to load first, before all the
&gt; other
&gt; kernel entries (lilo heirachy - top -&gt; down)
&gt; 
&gt; Check the man page for more options
