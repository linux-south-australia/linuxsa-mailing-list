&gt;have any of you perchance used VMware on linux for a windows (9x)

I have used VMware for over a year now on a 333MHz Mobile PII. It is
noticably slower than the same hardware running Windows native, but I
prefer Linux, and need to run both.

I would not use it for gaming.

&gt;any comments on stability or comparisons to free emulators like WINE? 

I have had less problems since I upgraded to VMware 2.0, but I do notice
that if I am compiling under Linux, and doing Windows things, Windows
behaves like it has running out of memory.

&gt;VMware seems to be well regarded in some circles and hardly mentioned
&gt;(in the
&gt;context of emulators) in others. perhaps its because the price looks a
&gt;little steep (though US$99 for non corporate use is at least possible)
&gt;or a dual boot turns out to be easier?

VMware is excellent for some things, like training and running Windows NT
as well as Linux on the same machine, or running FreeBSD as well as Linux,
etc.

However, for other things, simply run dual-boot or get another machine.

It may also be worth looking at Win4Lin: www.trelos.com. I have no idea
whether or not Win4Lin works well for gaming, but it is aimed only at Win9X
and is said to be faster than VMware.

&gt;thanks,
