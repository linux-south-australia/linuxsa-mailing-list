Subject: Linux friendly ISP's and ADSL


Hello.

I was just wondering if anyone on the list knew of any linux friendly
ISP's?  Not linux friendly internally, but linux customer client
friendly.  I currently use iPrimus and was told flat out by the rep I
talked to that linux was unsupported and any problems connecting were
my own.  While I appreciate that a company can only support what it
has the technical knowledge to handle, I would rather have some
support when I needed it.  (For instance I have not been able to get
kppp to connect to them, but that's OK kwvdial works just fine).

So does anyone know of an Adelaide ISP that does support linux
connections?

Thanks in advance
Damien

P.S. The same in regards to ADSL in Adelaide (I know there's no
active ADSL in Adelaide yet, I mean future plans (then again if an
ISP supports linux for normal Modem dialup they'll probably do it for
ADSL (well that's kinda obvious (don'tcha just love parenthesis)))
think that's all the parenthisis closed :&gt; ).
