 &gt; Is that  attack of which you speak the kind of attack where

No.  It is an attack which forges packets so that they appear to come
from "trusted" IP addresses.

 &gt; If so, then the use of numerical host addresses should fix this.

Sadly not.

 &gt; If not, then I'd like to be convinced how an attacker from 
 &gt; 1. outside the firewall which blocks the rlogin/rsh ports, or
 &gt; 2. within the LAN behind the firewall
 &gt; can get authenticated as a trusted host.

Sigh.

The reason you gave for pointing out that use of rlogin/rsh was good 
was that if someone compromised the firewall and sniffed the internal
network, they wouldn't be able to see passwords.

My reaction to that is to say that if you're using .rhosts or
hosts.equiv files behind your firewall, once they've compromised it
they don't *NEED* to see your passwords, because they can break in
anyway.

 &gt; I'm not claiming that it can't be done.
 &gt; This is a genuine request for info.
 &gt; If I can see a credible method of attack, I'll stop using
 &gt; the .rhosts thing.

The attack method is well known, and has been for many years.  There
was a very long and drawn out thread on it started by Tsotumo
Shimomura in comp.unix.security in 1996 or thereabouts;  It's also
one of the reasons why so much effort has been invested into selecting
difficult-to-guess seed sequence numbers in TCP implementations 
since that time.

The rsh/rlogin protocol is fundamentally broken by design -- It 
gives 100% total trust to the source IP address of a client (because
it uses it as the one-and-only authenticator), even though the source
IP address can be trivially forged to be whatever the hell an attacker
wants it to be.  If an attacker is at the end of a WAN link, and you're
using .rhosts/hosts.equiv, and they can credibly guess initial sequence
numbers, they'll break in;  If they're able to sniff your LAN, they 
no longer need to guess initial sequence numbers.

Aside from that, whether you're using telnet, rsh, HTTP basic
authentication, or any other unencrypted wire protocol, an attacker can
perform a "hijacking" attack if they're on your LAN.  Thus, even small
amounts of trust in unencrypted protocols are terribly misguided if
you're even remotely interested in security.

 &gt; On a related topic, the "r" commands are useful for all sorts
 &gt; of purposed, like inclusion in scripts and makefiles.

Get ssh.  Functionally identical to the "r" commands, able to run as
a command-line-compatible drop-in replacement, but with the benefit of
cryptographic security.

 &gt; I could look it up, I suppose, but could you say whether
 &gt; it is possible to do this easily also with "ssh".
 &gt; I think I've seen somewhere that "ssh" (which I use
 &gt; day in, day out - on your recommendation, I think) is able
 &gt; to be used in scripts by lodging a signature-file sort of
 &gt; thing with the client host for access without manual
 &gt; intervention.

Yes - Place public keys of authorized clients into a user's
$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file (to generate the keypair, use 
ssh-keygen(1) -- Perhaps non-obvious).

 &gt; But then would that no weaken my whole security?
 &gt; If someone gets hold of that unencrypted signature-file
 &gt; thing, then they can impersonate me even over the net
 &gt; through my firewall (which lets ssh through).

There is no such thing as an unencrypted signature file.  There are
private key files (which are supposed to be unreadable to everyone
except their owner, and are passphrase-protected just in case) and 
there are public key files (which are useless without the corresponding
private key).

 &gt; PS. I don't use hosts.equiv files.
 &gt; That would be a disaster, I admit.

There is no functional difference between a hosts.equiv and a .rhosts.
If anything, the hosts.equiv is stronger because the only individual
who can control it is the superuser (consider for a moment the security
implications of running a system with thousands of accounts on it, where
any one of those users could accidentally place a line in their
.rhosts file which permits anyone on the Internet to login to their 
account -- A standard trick when I was at uni was to put
"+ +" into a user's .rhosts file if they walked away from their terminal
without logging out;  Hours of fun for all the family :-)

 &gt; I used to use them in the old days (ultrix etc.).
 &gt; It's convenient in an organisation with people sharing
 &gt; a dozen workstations.

That alone should set the security alarms ringing.
