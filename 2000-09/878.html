&gt; I personally think that students should be taught the concepts of computing
&gt; and computing applications.  They should be taught basic programming (C) to
&gt; help them understand how things are working.

Oh come on.  C is not basic programming, by the designer's intent.

I can't see why programming needs to be taught at school at all,
it's like teaching kids biomechanics during PE.  An understanding
that such a thing exists is good, but you don't need fifteen weeks
tutorial in body chemistry to learn that running hard makes your
legs sore but if you stop and rest you can run again.

&gt; If you give the teachers minimal training in things like the shell you are
&gt; using and in the general layout of the system (file system, printing, home
&gt; dirs, etc) then tell them the basics of the Un*x like system they should be
&gt; able to stay one step ahead of the kids.

No teacher is going to step in front of a class feeling particularly
good about that level of training.  It's like suggesting that English
teachers should read the next chapter the night before the class.

&gt; You musn't forget that the underlying concepts of Linux are similar
&gt; to Windows.

Then I suggest you have a look at the printing subsystems.


Teachers have been dropped into the computing technology tar pit
and expected to swim.  It's totally unfair of the Linux community
to want to do this to them yet again.

If you want to see Linux taught in schools, then work out a way
to support those schools.  Don't expect teachers to shoulder the
entire burden.
