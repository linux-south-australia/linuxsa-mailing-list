G'day Andrew,

&gt; I was wondering if anyone knows of any product for Linux that emulates
&gt; the features of the part of ZEN Works or GHOST dumps a fresh image of a
&gt; particular machine onto the client PC every time it reboots.

There are a few tools that help do this specific task. 

However I find that usually what is required is a more comprehensive
solution, because there's always some site-specific administrative work
that needs to be done at each end. I do find though that having remoteboot
in the solution helps a lot. Linux does remoteboot, both in freeware and
payware PROMs. Many motherboards come with PXE now anyway (refer to Mark
Newton's post of some time ago regarding PXE'd FreeBSD installations
taking over the network :-)

When I was a private consultant there was a project which did pretty much
this (only with a lot of complicating factors) for the arrivals/departure
screens in Amsterdam, Sydney and other airports. The brief there was to
make an NT application work extremely reliably and be completely remotely
administerable. No blue screens allowed because someone might have to
climb a ladder 2000 times and press ctrl-alt-delete etc.

We ended up using boot PROMs, some scripting logic before any OS was
booted, a Linux partition and an NT partition that first checked the
hardware for sanity, then the Linux partition for sanity and rebuilt it if
insane, checked for updates and applied them, then booted Linux which
checked the NT partition for sanity and rebuilt it if insane, updates (eg
the video card had been changed so Linux installed a new NT driver) and
then booted having initialised a hardware watchdog card in case NT
crashed. 

Would you believe, the company that helped me with the work on this
project with me was Tellurian, and the employees are still with us. We did
a considerable amount of work on this project that we have rights to, and
also quite a bit of documentation.

Tell us some more about the problem you have. We have been wondering about
doing something useful with some of the generic bits of this work. Maybe
this would be an opportunity.

&gt; It would be good to see a product that might even use an rsync type of
&gt; thinking and only update the parts of the hard disk that have changed..

rsync isn't really a solution unless you have very few workstations
because of the server-side CPU hit. If you think about it rsync is
extremely wasteful in this special case: all the destination files are
identical but you are calculating the same differences time and again!  
Finally, if the source files are compressed (and often they should be
because you are talking about 1Gb or more files, and you might have many
of them in a big remoteboot network) you can't use rsync anyway, because
you change one byte in the file and the compression algorithm might well
splatter changes all over the compressed output. However, transferring Gb
of data to every workstation isn't a solution either! There are various
ways around this from multicast file transfer to an rsync replacement
tuned for the case where the differences can be calculated at the server
side in advance.

Incidentally Ghost does some clever things with NT images, including
editing the NT SID. The SID has to be unique on a network, so just imaging
an NT machine doesn't help. I don't know of a free tool that does
SID mangling in NT images.
