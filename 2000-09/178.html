&gt; Some questions about apache logs.
&gt;
&gt; at the moment my logs are just building up in one file. I don't know how
to
&gt; delete them or reset them.
&gt;
&gt; Then I want to enable the referrer and user agent fields how do I restart
&gt; httpd without reseting the machine. Give the exact commands if possible (I
&gt; am still a real dummy with linux yet)
To restart apache without resetting the machine hve  look at the command
apachectl, "apachectl restart" will do what you want.
I suggest you do man apachectl to read up as it can do more then that.

The file you want should be /etc/newsyslog.conf, this contains the options
for turning over log files.
Format of newsyslog.conf
# logfilename          [owner:group]    mode  count     size when [ZB]
[/pid_file] [sig_num]

explanation from the man page for newsyslog.conf
  logfile_name
             Name of the system log file to be archived.

     owner:group
             This optional field specifies the owner and group for the
archive
             file.  The ":" is essential, even if the owner or group field
is
             left blank.  The field may be numeric, or a name which is
present
             in /etc/passwd or /etc/group.

     mode    Specify the mode of the log file and archives.

     count   Specify the number of archive files to be kept besides the log
             file itself.

     size    When the size of the log file reaches size in kilobytes, the
log
             file will be trimmed as described above.  If this field is re-
             placed by an asterisk (`*'), then the size of the log file is
not
             taken into account when determining when to trim the log file.

     when    The when field can consist of an interval, a specific time, or
             both.  If the when field is an asterisk (`*') log rotation will
             depend only on the contents of the size field.  Otherwise, the
             when field consists of an optional interval in hours,
optionally
             followed by an `@'-sign and a time in a restricted ISO 8601
for-
             mat.  If a time is specified, the log file will only be trimmed
             if newsyslog is run within one hour of the specified time.  If
an
             interval is specified, the log file will be trimmed if that
many
             hours have passed since the last rotation.  When both a time
and
             an interval are specified, both conditions must be satisfied
for
             the rotation to take place.

             The particular format of the time is
             [[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd][T[hh[mm[ss]]]]]. Optional date fields default
             to the appropriate component of the current date; optional time
             fields default to midnight; hence if today is January 22, 1999,
             the following date specifications are all equivalent:

                   `19990122T000000'
                   `990122T000000'
                   `0122T000000'
                   `22T000000'
                   `T000000'
                   `T0000'
                   `T00'
                   `22T'
                   `T'
                   `'

             There is no provision for specification of a timezone.  There
is
             little point in specifying an explicit minutes or seconds
compo-
             nent in the current implementation, since the only comparison
is
             `within the hour'.

     flags   This optional field specifies if the archive should have any
spe-
             cial processing done to the archived log files.  The Z flag
will
             make the archive files compress to save space by using gzip(1).
             The B flag means that the file is a binary file, and so the
ASCII
             message which newsyslog inserts to indicate the fact that the
             logs have been turned over should not be included.  The - flag
             means nothing, but can be used as a placeholder when the
             path_to_pid_file field is specified.

Thats only part of the man file, you might want to have a read up of it ,
man newsyslog.

Sorry if this isnt command by command, but learning how to do things and
solve promblems, etc is part of being a newbie, not just being led by the
hand.

man and info are your freinds.
