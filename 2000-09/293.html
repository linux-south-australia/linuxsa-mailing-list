Further to what Benjamin Close &lt;<A HREF="mailto:linux@senet.com.au">linux@senet.com.au</A>&gt; said:

&gt; You can load any module you want in /etc/rc.d/rc.local or the more eligant
&gt; way is to get the kernel to load the modules for you. When accessing the

As Benjamin points out it is generally possible, and always better to
let the kernel handle the loading of modules.  However, there are
occasions when a module must be explicitly loaded, and loaded early.

One example: if you have an IDE cdrom as well as an IDE cdwriter.  You
can tell the ide-cd module to ignore the cdwriter, but you cannot tell
the ide-scsi module to ignore the cdrom.  So it is vitally important
that the ide-cd module be loaded first.

"rc.local" is one option.  However, I am not sure that it is used in
recent RedHat distributions!  Specifically, any mention of it is missing
from "/etc/inittab", "/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit", or "/etc/rc.d/rc" and I
have had no luck putting commands in there.  Instead, the file
"/etc/rc.d/rc.modules" is earmarked for starting modules.  Well
actually, you won't find a whisper about it in the RedHat documentation,
but you can see for yourself that it is run from "rc.sysinit".  So if
you were running RedHat you might write something like


#! /bin/sh
# 
# /etc/rc.d/rc.modules
#
#   - Load modules.  Called from /etc/rc.sysinit.
# 

# The two modules ide-cd, and ide-scsi will both attempt to claim IDE cdroms
# for themselves.  ide-cd is well behaved, in that it can be told to ignore
# devices.  ide-scsi is not!

/sbin/modprobe ide-cd


into "/etc/rc.d/modules" (make sure it is executable.)


Recently I have started playing with debian (thanks to Michael and
Richard!).  Guess what?  You just put the name of the module to start
at boot time into "/etc/modules".  It says so in the comments to
"/etc/modules" and also in `man modules`.  Spot the difference.



Cheers,


 Andrew
