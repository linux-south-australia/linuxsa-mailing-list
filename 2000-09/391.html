Daryl,

I forgot to reply to this.

A few times in the last year, people have asked me if they
could have e-mail accounts (using pop, imap or whatever), and
I told them that I was not running such software because I
thought it was a serious security hole.

So I was quite surprised to find that I _was_ running such
post-office software.

I.e. I was _not_ using POP2 for anything.

I at no time told the linux installation software that
I wanted post-office software.
It was just inserted for my pleasure by Red Hat.

At least the recent SuSE installation routines do ask
you which services you want installed, and this gives you
the opportunity to veto the dodgier ones.

The ultimate cause of this is probably the same as the
ultimate cause of MS software vulnerabilities.
Namely, they try to give you as many features as possible,
because they know that _marketing_ success depends on
everyone being able to find their favourite feature.
But the downside of featuritis is that you get 
more opportunities for vulnerabilities, the more features
you've got.

I think that RedHat have tried to add as much as possible,
in the interests of marketing.
Some of the other distributions are more spartan, I believe,
at the cost of not keeping the customers happy with all
the lovely software packages.

This is the problem with the default installations.
They're neat in the short term, but then you have to go through
and rip out the vulnerabilities.

Ah... and my main message in my initial over-lengthy post
was: if you have an old redhat 5.2 machine, rip out the pop2
server immediately!

--------------------------------------------------------
On a related subject, maybe linuxSA could organise
a security-fest. E.g. a weekend, or just one day on a
week-end, of seminars on linux security.
Those who are paid to teach this stuff will not want
to work for free. But for the rest of us, putting together
a 30-minute presentation might not be too onerous anyway.
And besides, if 50 people were to pay $10 each, that should
make enough to recompense some of the security professionals
out there if they were to deliver a seminar.

It should be possible to fit in 10 30-minute talks in
a one-day seminar. Then all we need is a list of the
top 10 security topics, and following such a
"paranoia seminar" we should all feel a bit more comfortable
when we approach the terminal each morning.
(I personally approach the terminal with dread every morning!)

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
