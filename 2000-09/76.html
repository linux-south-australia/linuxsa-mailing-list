&gt; 
&gt; So basically what is a DOS attack and how does it work?  

Robyn,

As I understand it, the generic DOS attack is an overwhelming
bombardment with bogus traffic with a view to denying the
host's services to the intended users.
That's simple enough.
But the actual _means_ of denying service could be quite broad.
Any attack involving continuous bombardment would be a DOS attack,
whereas breaking through the machine's defences to take control
of the machine is not.

Sorry I can't tell you anything non-obvious.

The main difficulty with DOS attacks is their cowardly nature.
They are almost always anonymized in that IPv4 has a
functionality deficit in not enforcing the source IP addresses
on all packets to be correct. 
Cisco routers (about 65% of all routers?) do not enforce this.
So Cisco can justifiably be blamed for all the world's DOS attacks.
If all routers verfied that IP packet source addresses were in the
subnet (or subnets) from which they came, then all DOS attacks
could be rapidly traced to source. The source would have been hacked,
but the evidence would be around of where they were hacked from.
Remember that two-way comms require [essentially] correct source
IP addresses.
Direct hacks are less cowardly than DOS attacks. They always
give away the source of the attack.
That's the thinking behind the "honey-pot" methodology, where
a security firm makes weak machines available so as to observe
hackers at work.

Just as we can blame e-mail worms on MS for writing shoddy software,
so we can blame DOS attacks on Cisco.
But it's too technical to explain to the media.
So this idea won't take root any time soon.

===================================================================
&gt; Do I need 
&gt; to check for anything? I'm using a program called 'freesco' on the router / 
&gt; firewall as it can fit on a floppy, but I've installed it on a small (100MB) 
&gt; hard drive. I've only used the default settings for it at the moment but 
&gt; don't really know what I'm looking for as far as security is concerned. Could 
&gt; you recommend a site or some reading material?

Well, I'm probably the least of the experts.
So I can't pontificate on this subject.

I've never tried any security tool such as freesco.
Never heard of it.

After 18 months of 20 hours a week (average) trying to
work out how to defend a 486 with redhat 5.2 (?) containing
linux kernel 2.0.36, connected to a 33k modem, I still
don't really have a clue.

All I do is update software when a serious bug is found
(e.g. sendmail, ftp, linux kernel 2.2.x [x &lt; 16]),
and check the logs every day -- /var/log/messages mostly,
and filter out stuff that looks dodgy (using ipfwadm).

Also very advisable is to run "tcpdump" continuously
as "tcpdump -i ppp0" all day so that when your firewall
is triggered by something, you can check the whole session
to see what was done.
As far as I know there is no "1334 r00t k14" (or whatever
the sub-teens call it) which fiddles with tcpdump log files.
So that's your best record of any attack.

I also keep a list <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/sec.html">http://www.topology.org/sec.html</A>
of links to security sites which give really good info
on security.
But I think it's pretty poor that a home user has to waste such
a huge amount of time on security when all they want
to do is get on with their work.
I've lost many tens of thousands of dollars worth of
productivity due to the security problems.
I wouldn't do it if it weren't educational.
But after 18 months, it does get a bit boring.
It's like trying to get to sleep when there is a
brigade of burglars congregating in your garden every night.

--------------------------------------
Perhaps I could also mention that I set up a couple of
SuSE machines (one 6.2 and one 6.4) connected to the net,
and have not done anything to secure them.
But they don't seem to have been hacked yet.
Yesterday at about 15:40, a Korean user tried to
telnet into them but failed (I think).

The threat from Korean sites is so great that I'm
probably going to do waht a lot of other people do,
i.e. just firewall off all of Korean IP space.
Phil Pittard worked out that the specific attack I
mentioned on this list yesterday was from a Korean
Elementary School: Poeksong Elementary School.

Here's something scary.
That computer which attacked me is described by netcraft.co.uk
thusly:

210.97.1.1 is running Apache/1.3.6 (Unix) (ALZZA/Linux) PHP/3.0.9 on Linux 

It looks either someone hacked it, or else whoever is responsible
for that computer is using it for nefarious purposes.

But I would say that it's a linux-out-of-the-box which
has been hacked.
All things considered, maybe I should have used BSD for
my firewall instead. I just haven't the time to learn
two systems though.

Anyway, as I said before, I think everyone should just
batten down the hatches for the coming Olympics-driven
storm.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
