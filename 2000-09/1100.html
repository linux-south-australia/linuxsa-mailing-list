The Apple AirPort is working coolie doolies with Non-Apple clients. If you
open the AirPort up, you will find that it is an AMD486 processor with an
Orinoco PCMCIA Card in it. Quite a nice little box. The Apple gear _is_
cheap, seeing as the education price for the Orinoco cards is more expensive
than the Apple gear retail ;)

Apple Store online sells the cards at $182 ea, so I am sure that you could
get them down quite a lot cheaper than stuff from Lucent..

The WaveLAN gear will go upto about 25Km depending on the environment and
the speed that you want to run the link at. It'l go to about 11-15Km
depending on the environment at Full Speed.

Its very nice gear. I run a link that uses the evil Lucent WavePOINT gear
(an emmbeded box that acts as a brigde) and we get about 480Kb/Sec from it
going from our ISPs Melbourne FTP Server.

If anyone needs help with this gear, email me. I've played around with it
enough to know how to get it going ;)

&gt; Hi.

&gt; $2600 seems pretty high. Have you had a look at the wireless network stuff
&gt; that mimp has? I think it's hundreds for the starter pack, not thousands.

Has anyone used the Apple Airport (Lucent chipset) equipment with
non-Apple systems? I don't see why it shouldn't work, but I haven't tried.
We have just got one here and Apple was charging $500 for the hub and $100
per PCMCIA card. If it works in !Apples then it is the best-priced radio
LAN I've seen in Australia.
