&gt; Hi Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; The winmodem in the Toshiba 4300 series is based on the Lucent Technologies
&gt; chipset. Fortunately they have distributed a binary only kernel module which
&gt; can be located at <A HREF="http://www.linmodems.org/">http://www.linmodems.org/</A> . I had no problems installing
&gt; from the distribution. It was compiled for RH 6.1 and reports unresolved
&gt; symbol errors on loading, but it still works very nicely.
&gt; 
&gt; Being a command-line person from way back, I use wvdial rather than
&gt; something like kppp or similar. A collegue of mine does use the RedHat
&gt; X-client dialer, also with great success.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards, Grant

Like I said, yes, winmodems _do_ work, but they add extra overhead to
your CPU that normal modems do not.  With a winmodem the digital signal
processing (DSP) part is done by your CPU instead of a dedicated CPU
with specific add-multiply machine-instructions.  It just means your
expensive Intel/AMD processor is doing the work that a $50 DSP chip
could be doing instead.  If if your CPU is modem stuff, it has less time
to do everything else.  Granted, your 800Mhz PIII in your laptop is
probably twiddling it's thumbs most of the time right now, but in 3
years time when Windows3000 or Linux2.8 comes out you'll be wanting
every once of CPU to stall off another upgrade/purchase.

Yes you can get them to work (if they're Lucent-based, which fortunately
most are) but you have a performance hit.  Not saying you shouldn't buy
one, but that it should be considered when you weigh up all the features
of your laptop prior to purchase.

Again, all IMHO.  'Caveat Emptor' and all that.
