&gt; SSH not 100% reliable!!

	Sigh.

&gt; Once again, I find that "sshd" can just lock up and
&gt; refuse to accept connections. Here are the symptoms on
&gt; the client side when I try to use "scp":
&gt; 
&gt; ===========================================
&gt; Could not create pipes: Too many open files
&gt; lost connection
&gt; ===========================================

	There are a set number of file descriptors _per-system_.

	If some other process is opening a lot of files, then SSH may fail
	after opening only a handful of files.

	(Ran a test: 8 processes opening 256 fds each on a redhat 6.1 box
	is enough to fill the file descriptor table. Binaries won't even run 
	because the dynamic linker uses the open(2) syscall at runtime. 
	Complete resource exhaustion).
	
&gt; I tried killing off child processes of the "sshd" process.
&gt; But that didn't help.

	What other processes are you running on the box? What is the operating
	system, and what is the kernel optimised to do?

&gt; If you rely on "ssh" as your only way to log in to a machine,
&gt; then you risk losing all contact.

	Ditto for telnet. Ditto for rsh, rlogin, deslogin, whatever.

&gt; The OpenSSH software is clearly not yet at the level of reliability
&gt; that you would want to place too much trust in it.

	Tsk, tsk. You just haven't installed the "infinite system resources"
	patch on your kernel, now, have you? 	:)

&gt; While checking this all out, the main sshd process crashed but left
&gt; a few child processes (one of which I am using to write this note).
&gt; But none of these child processes reponds to new login attempts.

	No, the child processes would be servicing other connections, I 
	suspect.

&gt; So much for removing all services!!!

	Sigh.

&gt; Moral 3:
&gt; When analysing security of systems, one has to look at all possible
&gt; (or credible) failure modes, not just the technically exciting ones
&gt; like eavesdroppers on the net. 

	What on earth does any of this have to do with security?

&gt; PS. Please don't tell me that I have to get the latest
&gt; version of OpenSSH. 
&gt; Do you really think there's something magic about
&gt; last week's release?
&gt; New releases fix old bugs and introduce new ones!

	I think you shouldn't scream 'fire' every time you
	smell something that might be smoke.
