I would tend to make it during school holidays (get the kiddies while
they're young), I'd also tend to give a months notice, if not more, this way
it would be possible for some smart cookie to issue a press-release to all
the major computer magazines.

I'd be happy to volunteer a bit of my time, but it will be VERY limited due
to there only being 24 hours in a day (any one want to ad another 24 hours
to the day?)

Depending on time and date and expected numbers I may be able to help out
with a Melbourne location as well.

I think it would also be good to have a few bits and pieces of information
about any companies that offer any Linux based training, as any newbies who
come along would more than likely want a bit of training to gain confidence
so they can play around a bit more.

Well that's my 2 cents worth :)

&gt; &gt;Subject: Any thoughts about a national install day?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hey,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm in the process of finalising an article about Perth's
&gt; &gt;installfest. This brings to an end Installfest 2000 but surely
&gt; &gt;only marks
&gt; &gt;the beginning of many such events.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Does anyone have any ideas about how a national "installfest"
&gt; &gt;event should
&gt; &gt;be handled in order to better promote Linux to the wider
&gt; &gt;community? I know
&gt; &gt;that the original idea (and it is a good one) was to have a national
&gt; &gt;install day across every city in the country which is willing to
&gt; &gt;participate.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Any other thoughts, ideas or comments will be welcome.
&gt;
&gt; I would suggest that someone just declares a date, and gives 2
&gt; weeks for it
&gt; to get around, and without any really really good objections, that becomes
&gt; the national (global?) date. The person suggesting the date would really
&gt; want to be the one co-ordinating the national effort... any volunteers?
&gt; Hmmm... just got an email from Anand (who spelt my surname wrong -- it's
&gt; Russell, not Russel... :) suggesting August 26th -- sounds fine to me...
&gt;
&gt; IMHO, I'd suggest around the same time of year... July/August/September or
&gt; thereabouts... Of course, the sooner we make the date, the better, in some
&gt; ways... Also, there has been some talk here at LinuxSA of doing a summer
&gt; installfest... comments?
&gt;
&gt; In terms of promotion, organisation, etc... I'd suggest that we attempt to
&gt; work together much closer than we did this time -- and seeing as we will
&gt; have the one date, this will force us to do so... Also, if we can
&gt; make some
&gt; sort of projection or target for numbers of people, PCs, and installs, it
&gt; could generate interest...
&gt;
&gt; rr
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks,
&gt; &gt;--
&gt; &gt;Rod
