&gt; hey Alan -- did you realise that if you spent as much time setting up your
&gt; linux systems as you do writing extraordinarily long emails, you wouldn't
&gt; have to write so many extraordinarily long emails? :)

Well Mark does it too, and no one complains when _he_ writes
extraordinarily long e-mails.
Not fair etc. etc. 

By the way, for those of you who think that 3 examples prove a theorem,
they do not.
Trust me, I'm a mathematician.

In order to prove that someone's software is okay, it is not sufficient
to provide 3 testimonials by people who have had no problem with it.

Anyway, I've got this sshd bug pretty much understood now.
On two other systems (one with different kernel but same openssh,
the other with different openssh but same kernel), the fd reclamation
works as in the textbooks.
The problem is completely reproducible.
I just hope that the bug won't re-surface in a future 
openssh/OS combination.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
