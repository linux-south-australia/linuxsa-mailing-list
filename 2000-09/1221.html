Comrades (and others):

If anyone has solved this problem, could you please let me know.

I've converted my whole life over to ssh and scp.
Now I've got some teentsy, weentsy problems with this.
(But that's not to say that I don't think that
ssh isn't the best thing since sliced fish.)

Situation:
Web-site runs sshd on linux.
Web artist uses putty on windows.

Everything is fine with password authentication.
But with the public key which I send to the artist,
there seems to be no way to get the key into the software.
No command line parameter etc.
Just sticking the key in the current directory doesn't
seem to work.

Right now, I can't contact the putty web-site even,
but I don't remember seeing this topic there before.
Right now, I'm stuck in deepest France. So I can't
read my linuxsa e-mails of the last 5 days quickly
enough to see if this topic has been touched on.

But I thought that someone last Tuesday said that putty
can indeed use public key authenticaiton.
If so, please let me know.

The reason that passowrd authentication is not so good is
that sshd seems to only allow either all passwords to
be guessed at (subject to a user-list) or none.
I've added myself ot the permitted user list,
but that means that anyone who can guess my pwd can get in
if I activate the password auth feature.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I think that ssh is the best thing since sliced
bananas and linux is hte best thing since sliced manna.
Whenver I say something that it not grovelling good
about linux, that measn I think it can be improved,
which is more than one can say for certain legacy
operating systems.
I say this because of something I saw in this list
while using a public internet terminal at Sydney airpot
on the way out to the French never-never, where I am
currently trying to earn a fiver or two to apy for
my linux habit. 
This e-mail list is not only readable at Sydney airport,
it also gets read by people who use google and other
search engines. Many accesses to my website are referred on
by the linuxsa e-mail list.
So we must be on our best behaviour to show the world
how we are the clever country.
Chip, chip...
