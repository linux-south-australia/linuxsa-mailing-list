&gt;&gt; You can always make mistakes.  But it would be incorrect to blame dd
&gt;&gt; without some really hard evidence.  dd is so reliable because it's
&gt;&gt; low-level: unless the CD-ROM driver has problems reading the CD-ROM,
&gt;&gt; it will work.
&gt;
&gt; Some clarification: The CD was of BeOS Release 4.5 - perhaps it
&gt; has something weird that confuses the driver? I do recall that
&gt; I got kernel error messages at the end of the dd (end of media??)
&gt; - I wasn't sure if this was normal or not when reading from the
&gt; raw device file.

It's possible that you ended up with a partial block at the end of the
medium.  But you can get past that with "conv=sync".  But it would
surprise me if a missing partial block at the end of the CD would
result in a bad copy.

&gt; The CD-ROM drive in question was also quite old (2x?) so that may
&gt; have been a factor as well.

That seems more likely.

&gt; As I said originally I don't take this to mean this method does not
&gt; work. I'd have no hesitation in gambling another $2 CD in this
&gt; manner if the opportunity presented itself again :-)

I'd certainly wait until I had an image which dd didn't complain
about.
