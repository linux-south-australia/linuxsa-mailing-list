&gt; My first odd behaviour was:
&gt; 
&gt; * ipchains -F
&gt;  - dumped the rules but not the policy

As long as I can remember, flush (-F) has _never_ reset the policy.
In all my ipchain scripts, I've always set the policy manually
before/after/during the flush.

&gt;  - I had allowed a syn connection out to any web server

Just curious; why not allow outbound connections to any port?

&gt;   ipchains -A output -p tcp -i ppp+ -s ${MYIP} ${UNPRIVPORTS} -d any/0
&gt; 80 -j ACCEPT

Where is your "-y" (if this is the rule matching the above description)?

What is UNPRIVPORTS set to?

&gt;   --&gt; ipchains -A forward -i ppp+ -s ${LAN_ADDRESS_IN_CIDR} -j MASQ

I think putting an interface on a forwarding rule may be bogus,
especially as the packets to be masqueraded are more likely to
be hitting your NIC, no?

&gt; * the other machines on the network - Windows 9X machines - that could
&gt; ping the localhost (firewall) machine, couldn't speak to the outside web
&gt; servers but seemed to be able to resolve domain names

Haven't seen all your rules, so I can't comment.

&gt; I'd be inclined to say Linux is broken...at least the -F flag doesn't
&gt; work as documented....any ideas on this?

I'd like to see where you thought that behaviour was documented.
