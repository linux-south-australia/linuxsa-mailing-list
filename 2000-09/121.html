&gt; I just noticed two interesting items:
&gt; 
&gt; -* Kernel 2.2.17 is now officially a release
&gt; -* Qt 2.2 will be released under the GPL
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like they will allow applications that use Qt to be licenced
&gt; either under the GPL and/or the QPL.

I've read various comments on that, as well as the TrollTech
explanations at freshmeat and on their website.

Some have claimed that QT'd license change was prompted by the Gnome
Foundation, but if it's an attempt to interest those companies, I
suspect it will miss its mark. The nice thing about Gnome/GTK+ is that
you can write *commercial* closed source applications with it, like
Applixware for instance, and not have to pay anyone royalties. The sad
thing is that atm, to write a commercial app for KDE costs much more per
developer than it does to write one for windows, even if you include the
MS tools (although if you're using free tools it needn't cost anything
at all). Not a great situation for our wonderful "free" OS. I'd be very
surprised if lack of licensing fees wasn't a big reason that the
commercial Unix companies have now mostly gone with Gnome.

I'm hoping that some of the Linux distro companies who have money to
throw around and have an interest in QT (Like Caldera, SuSE or Mandrake)
will chip in and buy up TrollTech, release Qt as LGPL, and support its
development from distro revenue.

My 2c :)
