Warning -- long reply...

===========================================================
Mark,

That's all good value.
But I'm not quite certain that you have the same picture of
the scenario that I have.

Here's an example:

------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1:
I'm in Strasbourg with my laptop accessing my home web site over
the client company's LAN and Internet access.
I have some 4 machines which I want to access for various reasons.
Once I'm "in" to one of my machines, I'm certain that I'm me.
So I want to move around freely - e.g. with "rsh" and "rcp".

Disadvantage of "ssh" and "scp" - I don't want other people in
the office to see me type in my passphrase.
If I have someone viewing a demo I've giving them, I'd rather
just type "rsh hostname" than type the passphrase.

Scenario 2:
I'm at home in front of my main workstation, and I am copying files
from the workstation to my webserver 30 or more times a day.
I use makefiles with "rcp" in them.
Typing in passphrases is very tedious indeed.

------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;  &gt; Is that  attack of which you speak the kind of attack where
&gt;  &gt; you fake the reverse DNS look-up to fool the server host into
&gt;  &gt; thinking that the client is a trusted client?
&gt;  
&gt; No.  It is an attack which forges packets so that they appear to come
&gt; from "trusted" IP addresses.

This is fine from attacker to victim.
But the victim traditionally replies with the destination IP
address equal to the source address of the client's packets.
The attacker, in order to get those reply packets, must either
be on the same LAN as me (e.g. a shared office with disreputable
co-workers), or else be on the same LAN as the destination host
(or some other less credible alternatives).
The attacker must be pretty clever to trick my computers into sending 
IP packets to an address which is _not_ written in the client
IP packet source-IP field.

------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; The attack method is well known, and has been for many years.  There
&gt; was a very long and drawn out thread on it started by Tsotumo
&gt; Shimomura in comp.unix.security in 1996 or thereabouts;  It's also
&gt; one of the reasons why so much effort has been invested into selecting
&gt; difficult-to-guess seed sequence numbers in TCP implementations 
&gt; since that time.

I remember overhearing some people discussing this kind of attack
around about that time.
I know that TCP uses (or used to use) the time of day to choose
the initial sequence number, apparently as a way of avoiding the
possibility of packets from different sessions to the same port
getting confused - in case of link failure etc.

I can see that an attacker, if able to guess the precise 32-bit
sequence number, could maintain a credible sequence of packet
_transmissions_ to the server host to maintain the communication.
But they still could not receive the packets from the victim
(server) host. Thus they could.....
hmmmm.... 
They could then execute something nasty, e.g. a call-back, or else
a "rm -r /" or something.
This could be done by knowing the exact sequence of actions that will
be taken by the server.
So having a predictable server SEQ number makes it possible.
And if it fails once, 5000 attempts would pretty quickly
get it.

I'm grateful to you for that. 
I hadn't thought about how sneeky these rascals can be.

------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;  &gt; On a related topic, the "r" commands are useful for all sorts
&gt;  &gt; of purposed, like inclusion in scripts and makefiles.
&gt; 
&gt; Get ssh.  Functionally identical to the "r" commands, able to run as
&gt; a command-line-compatible drop-in replacement, but with the benefit of
&gt; cryptographic security.

Well, I've got "ssh" all over the place.
What I didn't know until 30 minutes ago is that there is an "scp"
command to replace "rcp".
This is really terrific. I've been using mail attachments for
transfers over the net. This is going to change my life!
The problem is that "scp" requires my passphrase, which is
no good at all for makefile and script use.

------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; Yes - Place public keys of authorized clients into a user's
&gt; $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file (to generate the keypair, use 
&gt; ssh-keygen(1) -- Perhaps non-obvious).
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; But then would that no weaken my whole security?
&gt;  &gt; If someone gets hold of that unencrypted signature-file
&gt;  &gt; thing, then they can impersonate me even over the net
&gt;  &gt; through my firewall (which lets ssh through).
&gt; 
&gt; There is no such thing as an unencrypted signature file.  There are
&gt; private key files (which are supposed to be unreadable to everyone
&gt; except their owner, and are passphrase-protected just in case) and 
&gt; there are public key files (which are useless without the corresponding
&gt; private key).

Well, "man ssh-keygen" says:

=========================================================
     Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to
     store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same
     name but ``.pub'' appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The
     passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have
     empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.
=========================================================

I.e. the passphrase is not required.
So the "private" key _can_ be unencrypted!!

Then "man scp" says:

=========================================================
     -B      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphras­
             es).
=========================================================

- indicating how to avoid having the user type in anything.
And "man ssh" says:

=========================================================
     BatchMode
             If set to ``yes'', passphrase/password querying will be disabled.
             This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where you
             have no user to supply the password.  The argument must be
             ``yes'' or ``no''. 
=========================================================

This is obviously the real corresponding thing to .rhosts trust.
This is what I meant by "uncrypted signature files".

So I _could_ go to the bother of setting this all up with a 
separate key for my "rcp" scripts (or "scp" now), so that
if someone gets my key, they will only be able to do a very 
limited set of things.

I must say that I can't see myself going to so much effort.
I think that my recommendation to Robyn remains:
If you have several machines which are safely behind a firewall,
then all things considered, it's better to use .rhosts than
to type passwords for every file copy and login.
And if "rcp" and "rlogin" are firewalled out, the above
sequence-number-guessing attack won't work anyway.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
