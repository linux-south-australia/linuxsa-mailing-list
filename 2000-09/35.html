Are you sure your reading right ?

As far as I know both telstra and primus are using  the alcatel speed touch
range(until other equipment is ok'ed for its network and is avalible in USB
format as well from telstra), the speed touch home, connects to  a ethernet
card they install with a reverse cat 5 cable.
About the modem itself,

About getting it working under linux.

The dsl reports site also has adivce on hooking dsl modem's an the like up
to small networks (eg. connecting the modem up to the cascade port of your
hub.)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; P.S. The same in regards to ADSL in Adelaide (I know there's no
&gt; &gt; active ADSL in Adelaide yet, I mean future plans (then again if an
&gt; &gt; ISP supports linux for normal Modem dialup they'll probably do it for
&gt; &gt; ADSL (well that's kinda obvious (don'tcha just love parenthesis)))
&gt; &gt; think that's all the parenthisis closed :&gt; ).
&gt;
&gt; Helstra support Linux for dialup, don't they??? AFIK for ADSL you _MUST_
&gt; have Windows95/98/NT/2000/ME for their ADSL PCI card to operate... you'd
&gt; think they'd just give you an ADSL modem that connects to your ethernet
&gt; (like a lot of satellite internet providers do).
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone had any success with Linux and the ADSL card from Telstra
&gt; (probably not anyone in Adelaide), because I would like to move this way
&gt; when the service is available, and I can afford it.  However, I DO NOT
&gt; want to run my ADSL connection under Winblows(goates!) because that
&gt; would mean that my connection would be down more often than it is up!
