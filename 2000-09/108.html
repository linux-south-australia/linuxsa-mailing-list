&gt; That's an ASTOUNDINGLY bad idea.  The security problems with rsh,

Mark,

I'm extremely reluctant to add yet another contribution to this
thread, but....

Is that  attack of which you speak the kind of attack where
you fake the reverse DNS look-up to fool the server host into
thinking that the client is a trusted client?

If so, then the use of numerical host addresses should fix this.

If not, then I'd like to be convinced how an attacker from 
1. outside the firewall which blocks the rlogin/rsh ports, or
2. within the LAN behind the firewall
can get authenticated as a trusted host.

I'm not claiming that it can't be done.
This is a genuine request for info.
If I can see a credible method of attack, I'll stop using
the .rhosts thing.

----------------------------------------------
On a related topic, the "r" commands are useful for all sorts
of purposed, like inclusion in scripts and makefiles.
I could look it up, I suppose, but could you say whether
it is possible to do this easily also with "ssh".
I think I've seen somewhere that "ssh" (which I use
day in, day out - on your recommendation, I think) is able
to be used in scripts by lodging a signature-file sort of
thing with the client host for access without manual
intervention.

But then would that no weaken my whole security?
If someone gets hold of that unencrypted signature-file
thing, then they can impersonate me even over the net
through my firewall (which lets ssh through).

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I don't use hosts.equiv files.
That would be a disaster, I admit.
I used to use them in the old days (ultrix etc.).
It's convenient in an organisation with people sharing
a dozen workstations.
