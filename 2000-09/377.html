Sorry Sam, I thru this back on the list.
I agree I am prol fairly safe as i am on for a matter of few hours at any
one time and Security thru obscurity has been my approach (yeah I kno not
enuf but...)
Anyway with the advent of ADSL etc, surely similar events such as Alan's
will start to happen more often.
I am hoping to get it and I do want to secure my side of things, I have a
box on the floor waiting to become a firewall, router and another source of
heat. But it all seems so hard.

Should this be another topic for a meeting "Readying for ADSL" or something
like that.

Sorry for the whining.

&gt;&gt; Isn't this enough to scare most users looking for alternative workstation
&gt;&gt; platforms back to microsoft. I know it became obvious shortly into message
&gt;&gt; that I am way out of my depth and MS solutions seem so much simpler.
&gt;
&gt;Remember that simplicity is just that. If you want secure, don't go
&gt;looking for anything that is as simple as one click for security...also
&gt;keep in mind that I haven't yet come across a MS solution that is secure
&gt;without having to buy 3rd party software to correct security holes in the
&gt;MS software.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry, but there is obviously a lack of knowledge on my part and I doubt
&gt;&gt; I'm too different from a lot of naieve users.
&gt;
&gt;A.K. spends a lot of time concerning security, but one thing you also need
&gt;to understand is that Alan opted for the most insecure method of doing a
&gt;firewall: Default was to allow stuff in, then he blocks out stuff that he
&gt;thinks is a problem.
&gt;If you start from a deny everything perspective, then allow back in the
&gt;stuff that you want ppl to be able to get at, then you are MUCH better off
&gt;to begin with. My gateway/mail/dns server has only 4 ports open, and only
&gt;2 are accessable to the internet in general (DNS and SMTP)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Surely there is a NICE way of securing what you have to avoid these
&gt;&gt; exploits without resorting to archaic console commands. Or without the need
&gt;&gt; for introducing a firewall box etc. 
&gt;
&gt;I'd start by working through /etc/inetd.conf, then set /etc/hosts.deny and
&gt;/etc/hosts.allow to batten down everything that you do not explicity
&gt;require.
&gt;If you are not on a permanent connection then you are fairly safe with
&gt;just the simplistic security above. On a 24x7 connection??? Then it is
&gt;well worth the effort getting a 486 as a firewall...I have had not one
&gt;person get into my system yet (I do the same as A.K. and keep tcpdump logs
&gt;of everything & also have tripwire running to check that noone screws with
&gt;my system.
&gt;
&gt;Or look on www.freshmeat.net under security tools for firewall scripts
&gt;that take care of lots of the yukky details. But make sure you check
&gt;carefully what they are doing!
&gt;
&gt;HTH,
&gt;
&gt;Sam!
