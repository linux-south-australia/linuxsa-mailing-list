&gt;&gt; Actually, I've been entertaining this idle thought lately - if
&gt;&gt; there's money to be made in hardware, why not build a router
&gt;&gt; where the OS is open sourced?  I seem to remember at some stage

It's been done, when Juniper first started making noise about building
better-than-cisco routers, there was news that they used an OS derived from
FreeBSD. There are more than a few routers and other TCP/IP devices out
there running BSD code, as the BSD licencing makes it very easy to grab a
large amount of networking source without having to pay any royalties or
licencing, and have a reduced time-to-market since the programmers don't
have to reinvent the wheel and research every RFC and security advisory
since 1980.

&gt;Someone told me they run 400 Mbits/sec continuously on 3 ATM
&gt;cards simultaneously. (I think that's 400 Mbits/sec total,
&gt;not each.) That was on a P III/600 or something.

The problem with using PC-based routers is that they're designed to sit at
the edge of networks (or rather, networks are designed to have them at the
edge), the PCI bus is only capable of 132Mbits/s, so even if you put 5 ATM
cards in the PCI slots on a new P3, you're still only going to see an
aggregate of just over 100Mbits of throughput. Don't even start thinking
that a Gigabit PCI network card is going to be useful, unless you have some
need for jumbo frames. Sticking 4x 100Mbit cards in a PC is only going to
slow down a network that could use a switch instead. Also remember that
those old 486's can only push 5.5Mb/s at best on the ISA bus without some
radical overclocking.

Some of the 64bit PCI stuff should be able to push around a lot more data,
but there only ever seems to be one of them in a machine (sparc/alpha/xeon
hardware). Some of the latter hardware can come with multiple buses for
greater total throughput, such as that seen in the Mindcraft benchmarks.

For links that mortals and linux hackers are more likely to come into
contact with at home, a PC-based router can do fine. Once you start adding
up the cost of top-quality hardware that a networked business needs to rely
on, the solid-state Cisco gear starts to look fairly priced by comparison.
If you're really moving a serious amount of data, chances are that it will
cost a serious amount of lost time if it breaks. Think of quality networking
equipment as business insurance :)

Before I saw the light, I used to build a routers based on Windows NT
server, RRAS, and 2 digi datafire S/T cards. This was a relatively cheap way
to get a 256K ISDN connection in a time when the equivalent config from most
router vendors attracted a 5-figure sum. It was honestly more reliable than
many of the kludges that went on with 4x BRI multilink from some of the real
router companies.

On the other hand, any PC-based system is going to be more flexible than a
router, so go for it if that's what suits you best.
