I know OpenBSD might be very good from a security standpoint, but I
think the mark as been missed here.  Security is a process, not a
product.  You can't buy security.  Even after the most thorough code
walkthrough and testing you _cannot_ be assured that a product is secure
if it's more complicated than 'hello world'.  Security is about closing
all the known holes, installing auditing tools, and regularly checking
logs.  There's no short cut.  If someone wants to break into your XYZ
computer they will, you can't stop them, you just need to make the next
IP address looks more attractive a target than you.

All IMHO.  No offence intended.
