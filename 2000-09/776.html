&gt; Glen,
&gt;
&gt; There's an interesting corollary to this:
&gt;
&gt; Any linux distribution you buy right now is going to be
&gt; secure for 6 months maximum.
&gt; If you don't read security advisories every week, then you'll
&gt; have to wipe your distribution and install a new one in 12 months.

Which is why most distributions now use some form of package managment. I cannot speak for the
Debian side of things, but RPMS enable stuff to be updated very easily. It's because of this
that we can do an "upgrade" with relative safety. I have heard nice things about RedHat's
upgrade mechanism.

&gt;
&gt; I used to say that the big bad thing about MS OSs is the fact
&gt; that they compel you to get a new OS every 2 years.

You can't even uninstall a program successfully in Windows (without 3rd party software).

&gt; But the lifetime of a linux distribution is more like 12 months.

Not really. I still believe that if you have something that set up well to start with, the
occasional security update is no hassle. A stitch in time saves nine.

&gt;
&gt; With the prices of linux distributions like redhat and suse
&gt; having doubled in the last 12 months, I think that the
&gt; advantages of linux are being whittled away.

With many people starting to get higher bandwidth access to the internet at home, downloading
an entire operating system is becoming less of a problem. You can also still copy CDs from
people. I have personally never bought a packaged Linux system ever.

&gt; If linux and MS have the same use-by date, same price...
&gt; and linux requires 10 times as much maintenance...
&gt; and MS has 10 times as much support from everyone in the universe...
&gt; well, why would anyone but a computer scientist get linux?

Both operating systems really need constant maintaining, but at least with Linux you can
maintain it. There are few server designed distributions (which I am trying to do something
about). Most are either for workstations or general purpose. Storm Linux is an example of one I
would call a workstation distro. Others such as RedHat and SuSE I would refer to as being more
general purpose (to varying degrees). A server is a very specialised piece of equipment and the
distribution should reflect that.

&gt; I think that rock-solid security is clearly achievable out of
&gt; the box. But all the distributers are competing on functionality,
&gt; not security. Well many of them.

Agreed.

&gt;
&gt; If someone came out with a fully-featured distribution, like SuSE,
&gt; but with rock-solid security, then it should sell a lot better,
&gt; especially if there's a fully-functioned "security GUI".

One day ;-)
