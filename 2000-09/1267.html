&gt; &gt; As an aside, AARNet and CAUDIT have negotiated several "fallback"
&gt; &gt; contracts with suppliers.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm quite confused.  I assume we are talking about, "MS reimaging sting
&gt; will cost business $11bn - Gartner."  Do I have to follow some link from
&gt; that story to find something about Open Source, or even to find something
&gt; that the pundits describe as good news?

The original story was "good news" in as far as the increased cost
of the Microsoft products improves the business case for the adoption
of Linux.

My aside was simply to note that there is an anomolous situation where you
decide to go with Linux but still end up paying the same amount to
Microsoft.  You move from paying, say, $90 under a site license for Office
to paying, say, $900 RRP.  So even with 90% of your user base running Linux you
still pay the same to Microsoft.  AARNet and CAUDIT provide it members
with a way out of that situation by providing a relatively volume-independent
heavily discounted price for some closed software and hardware.  Thus
that 10% of users that must run Microsoft products for perfectly justifiable
reasons doesn't undo your business case for moving the bulk of your users
to another vendor.
