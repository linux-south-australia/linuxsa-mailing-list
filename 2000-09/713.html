Hi,

If there is a to hacking contest, we'd better sort out some rules and 
scenarios.  I like the idea of giving each team a copy of a known 
vulnerable OS (say, RH 6.2) and having them install/configure it and 
attempt to hack each other in the mean time.  The ultra-secure Gibson 
known as the "ABM Workgroup Server" could in the mean time be logging it 
all, and be the ultimate jewel for your hacking crown.  To keep it fun, 
it might be necessary to have rules about telling people your exploits 
after they are owned so that they can secure against it and keep playing.

The prize for most skr1ptx0r success would of course be a copy of OpenBSD?

&gt; Had a chat with some folks from Hitech today (Marco, the network

&gt; 
&gt; They have been plugging this new "ABM Workgroup Server" for a few weeks now
&gt; and are going to let us (Stellaris) test drive it next week.
&gt; I'll report to the list how that goes. They reckon it's a half hour or less
&gt; setup. Hmmmmmm.
&gt; 
&gt; The blurb says;
&gt; "The Appliance Based Mission-Critical Server is based on the Immunix OS, a
&gt; hardened version of Linux which makes it less vulnerable to network attacks.
&gt; The modular design of this server is easy to configure through a web
&gt; browser, and offers the ability to easily plug in extra services and play
&gt; without any down time!"
&gt; 
&gt; It can be setup with;
&gt; Web Server
&gt; Email Server
&gt; File Server -30GB Max
&gt; Print Server
&gt; Intranet Server
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways Hitech if given enough notice will be happy to let us have the demo
&gt; box for the SecureFest and is happy for us to hack/crack it!
&gt; 
&gt; Good for LinuxSA we get a toy to play with... :-)
&gt; Good for Hitech they find out how really secure it is, or not. :-) (I
&gt; wouldn't wan't to sell one a find our it had big holes and the system
&gt; wouldn't let me fix 'em)
&gt; 
&gt; In our company here we have discussed this box a bit and since it's RRP is
&gt; $1,999 it is most often cheaper for us to build a Linux Box and bolt it down
&gt; ourselves. However if this little ABM Server does hold water, for some
&gt; clients it would be a good little solution (time wise that is, everything is
&gt; a trade off).
&gt; 
&gt; The sooner we nail down a date for SecureFest, the sooner I can chat with
&gt; Hitech again.
&gt; 
&gt; Who ever is taking the bull by the horns and organising things at this stage
&gt; please e-mail me off-list.
