About 1-2 weeks ago, I noticed a sudden upsurge in
port scans of TCP port 12345, primarily from Korean
addresses.
I had assumed that this was because it was start of
US academic year.
But someone told me that an Australian bank has been
targetted a lot with DOS attacks in the last week.
So now a sort of picture is starting to emerge.

Someone in Australia may have hijacked a bunch of
Korean hosts (which seem to be the easiest in the world
to hijack, judging by the number of probes I get from
them every month), and they have been specifically
probing Australian IP space looking for TCP port 12345
openings, to gather together more DOS slaves.

(In the meantime, someone in NZ did a ping probe on me,
looking for FTP ports, and failed to get anywhere - I think
they've been "dealt with" now. That makes me think that just
maybe the main attacker in in NZ.)

My question is:
Does anyone know what the port 12345 is really for?
It's so popular, I think it must be some sort of
follow-up thing to find DOS slaves to activate.

I normally inform webmasters when their hosts have been
hacked, but the Korean webmasters never reply.
So I don't waste me time on them any more.

Does anyone have any further info on the attacks on
St. George's Bank? (I think that was the one.)

Linux people seem to know more about these things than
most people.

By the way, the port 12345 probes seem to have slowed a little.
The last ones here were at  00:00:48 (210.118.152.146),
 01:46:37 (210.123.234.14), 02:25:42 (210.223.93.91),
and then nothing.

The most worrying attacks are on port 98, which is specifically
a RedHat port. I recommend strongly that everyone block this port.

The last attacking web host I checked out turned out to be
running Apache on a Linux machine - according to netcraft.co.uk.
This suggests also that linux machines are quite vulnerable.
I suspect that the main vulnerability may be anonymous FTP.
That's just a hunch.
Does anyone know what the main weak-point is that lets people
into linux machines?

So lest your machine become a DOS zombie, block port 98!
(Strangely, my SuSE 6.4 machine has this in the /etc/services <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

tacnews          98/tcp                 # TAC News
tacnews          98/udp                 # TAC News

which makes we wonder what RedHat is using now for linuxconf.)

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
