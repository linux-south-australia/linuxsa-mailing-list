Michael:

&gt; I haven't posted to the list for a while my linux box is running fine at the
&gt; moment and I am learning new things every day. Hey I even went out an bought
&gt; SAMS teach yourself SAMBA in 24 hours (Great book Richard) well it works, by

Richard is about to release "Special Edition Using Samba" - I have
actually seen an edition in The Bookshelf
(<A HREF="http://www.thebookshelf.com.au/">http://www.thebookshelf.com.au/</A>) in town as well. You can find it on
Amazon too (<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com.au/">http://www.amazon.com.au/</A>).

&gt; I am concerned about the security of my linux box...

Aren't we all?

&gt; basically I am using IPFWADM, setup by a fellow linux user at the
&gt; installfest for me. It is set to deny all, but allows communications on

That implies that you're using a kernel version which is lower than
2.2.X. Any particular reason why? Or do you mean ipchains?

&gt; certain ports and 1 to 1024 from inside the LAN to outside the LAN but
&gt; NOTHING IS ALLOWED IN, only traffic that leaves. All services are turned off
&gt; except for http, telnet and ftp, I think. (Where do I find this??)

You find what services are being run in two ways:

1) Check /etc/inetd.conf
 - the format is relatively easy to work out for yourself, just remember
anything beginning with a hash is a comment
 - telnet and ftp are classically called in.telnetd and in.ftpd although
there's no reason you couldn't have them renamed to telnetoo or
wotever...

2) Look at what is actually running in a particular run level
 - check /etc/rc.d/rc#.d if you're running a System V setup (RedHat,
Linux, Suse etc)
 - anything that starts with an "S" gets started
 - httpd is classically started from setup
 - alternatively, do "ps ax &gt; log" and read the resulting log to find
out what is actually running

&gt; Telnet is set to allow in only from my IP address range on the LAN which are
&gt; internet routable Telstra IP's. FTP is the same.

Internet routable IP's. I presume this means I could contact the IP's
over the internet if I knew their number. Whilst telnet on a LAN is
relatively secure, personally I believe SSH with password protected
public encryption is the most secure. Furthermore, in my reading of
SSH's rather lengthy manual pages, that even if you do fall back to
user/password authentication that the passwords themselves are
encrypted.

&gt; The server is acting as a
&gt; webserver on standard port 80.

If you're concerned about security - or maybe just curious - setup
apache to log who is getting what from your web server. I'd suggest if
you do that you use logrotate (should be installed by default, read the
man pages etc) to handle your logs because even on a local, personal
only web server the logs would grow like crazy!

&gt; I telnet into the machine from the LAN
&gt; regularly to configure things. I dont need to worry about security on the
&gt; LAN, it is only small, 5-6 users, and none of them have any idea about linux
&gt; or telnet.

And Santa comes from the sahara desert :-P

What if you employed someone like me who happens to know what you are
running? They might be employed as the shoe shiner, hence you wouldn't
even know they knew about Linux or telnet...and what if
they....ok....I'm getting carried away. Just because the current people
don't know, doesn't mean that will stay the same way forever. Besides,
eventually if your setup grows you'll need other people to know because
you won't be able to handle all the work by yourself.

&gt; The server is also using Sendmail 8.9.3 for email. It is the primary MX. I
&gt; am using telstras secondary MX. Mail cannot be accessed from outside the
&gt; LAN, only inside from the ip addresss range that I have from telstra.

Update Sendmail to the latest one. Because it is one of the most popular
MTA (mail transport agents), crackers do take a lot of notice of it.
They have found bugs/security flaws before (<A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org">http://www.sendmail.org</A>).
This doesn't mean that SendMail is insecure in itself - in any case bug
fixes tend to turn up within a day or even less for major security
dramas - it just means that people seem to pick on it because there's
more "cases" to attempt to crack...

&gt; What I want to know is whether this sounds secure or not? I am really on
&gt; edge about security, because if someone does manage to muck up my server, I
&gt; am afraid that either I will not even realise that they are doing it or I
&gt; won't be able to fix it and will be left without a website!!!

There is a program called logwatch. It used to be enabled in a RedHat
box by default at 4AM. You might try a program called "FreeVeracity"
(<A HREF="http://www.freeveracity.org/">http://www.freeveracity.org/</A>) or Saint or Tripwire...take a wander to
(<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net</A>) and lookup "security" and see what you turn up.

&gt; p.s. I also update my website from an external source the way that I do this
&gt; is to ring up and ask my colleague to run pcANYWHERE for me, it gets left
&gt; running all night on a private telephone number on a computer with the
&gt; monitor turned off. Doesn't matter whether it is turned on anyway. I dial up
&gt; to that machine login, file transfer the webpages to that machine, then copy
&gt; across the microsoft network into the www directory on the server. From that
&gt; machine using pcANYWHERE.

That sounds hideously complex...I don't know the security issues with
pcAnywhere in any terrible detail....
