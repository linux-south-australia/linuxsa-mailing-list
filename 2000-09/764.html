hmmm ... i've setup a number of freesco boxes now, and during setup i never
recall seeing anything about recommending NETBEUI or IPX. As Richard said,
NetBEUI is fairly new in Linux, and freesco is based on a 2.0.x kernel ....
i don't even know if it'd have support for NetBEUI.

Sounds good, although I'm not sure I like the Freesco's recommendation for
NETBEUI or IPX for internal networks. What was Robyn' s internal set up?

&gt; Hello!
&gt;
&gt; I've just reviewed Robyn Manning's firewall, which she has built from
&gt; the Freesco Firewall (<A HREF="http://www.freesco.org/">http://www.freesco.org/</A>). I concur with its web
&gt; pages and can say that:
&gt;
&gt; * it's easy to setup
&gt; * it runs with a very small foot print
&gt; * it appears to be secure
&gt;
&gt; Whilst I did not, nor will I have the resources to do a full security
&gt; audit of Robyn's system, it does appear to be relatively secure and
&gt; block services that you do not want to advertise to the world. Here's
&gt; how it works:
&gt;
&gt; * it defaults, essentially, to a "DENY EVERYTHING" policy
&gt; * through a series of screens. you answer a number of questions about
&gt; what you want to ALLOW...commentary is included with some of the
&gt; questions
&gt; * after you have answered the questions you are presented with an
&gt; overview, "advanced" screen where you can "fine tune" what your question
&gt; and answer session answered
&gt;
&gt; This is all done in text. You can administer it by telnet (icck), web
&gt; browser (icck) or at the actual console. It understands DHCP, but it
&gt; does appear to be based on an older kernel that uses 2.0.38 - I say
&gt; "appear" because ipfwadm looks like it's on Robyn's disk.
&gt;
&gt; I would recomment this particular product for someone who is concerned
&gt; with security, who is on a dialup account but who doesn't particularly
&gt; want to delve into the intricacies of the ipchains syntax immediately.
&gt; Whilst a business or larger home network may choose to use a full
&gt; distribution for this important service - simply because you then have
&gt; the utmost control of your firewall and router - you will buy yourself a
&gt; certain amount of protection using this product.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect that a home user on a relatively non-permanent connection
&gt; would be able to deter crackers, who would more likely turn to either
&gt; easier or more interesting targets...
