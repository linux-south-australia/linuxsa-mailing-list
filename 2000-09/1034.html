 &gt; Has anyone got the Microsoft Intellimouse working with the wheel under
 &gt; FreeBSD. I'm using it as a USB mouse but whilst I can get it working with
 &gt; the wheel, a switch back to the console from X renders the rodent
 &gt; useless. Any ideas? ( No puns about don't switch to console :)

I have the Logitech FirstMouse+ working, which is another wheel mouse 
which uses the IntelliMouse wire protocol, so it should be fairly similar.

Run moused like this:

      moused -p /dev/psm0 -t auto

(i.e.: listen to the PS/2 mouse port on /dev/psm0, set the mouse type
to "auto", which will use PnP to work out what it is).  moused reads
virtually any mouse protocol, converts it to something kinda-sorta-almost
like MouseSystems, and writes the translated events to /dev/sysmouse for
applications to read (which is multiplexible, so you can have lots of 
applications reading the mouse on lots of different virtual consoles at
the same time).

You can make moused run with those options at boot-time by putting the
following into /etc/rc.conf:

    moused_enable="YES"

That's all -- The rest of the options are the defaults anyway (consult
/etc/defaults/rc.conf if you don't believe me).

In your XF86Config, put something like this:

    Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "Auto"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/sysmouse"
        Option      "Buttons" "5"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
    EndSection
 
i.e.: monitor /dev/sysmouse for an unspecified mouse type.  Even though
the mouse has 3 buttons, pretend it has 5, where button-4 events are 
generated as a result of pushing the wheel up, and button-5 events come
from pulling the wheel down.  This allows applications which don't
understand the Z axis (e.g.: Netscape) to use the wheel.

So, the number of buttons you declare is equal to the number of "real"
buttons on the mouse, plus 1 for "wheel up" and one for "wheel down".  
If you have a mouse with 5 buttons and a wheel, you'd tell X it was a 
7-button mouse, and you'd specify buttons 6 and 7 in the ZAxisMapping
option.

How do you make an application use the wheel?  It'll vary from app to app.
Basically, you need to find the X resources which deal with keyboard and
mouse translations (i.e.: the bits that say, "When the user hits this key,
go and do this...").

If you look at the Netscape.ad file which comes with Netscape, you'll see a
definition for a resource called *drawingArea.translations, which says 
things like:

           &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:                     ArmLink()                       \n\
           &lt;Btn2Down&gt;:                     ArmLink()                       \n\
           ~Shift&lt;Btn1Up&gt;:                 ActivateLink()                  \n\
                  [ ... etc ... ]

Copy the definition for that resource to your ~/.Xdefaults file, then
apend the following to it:

        ~Shift&lt;Btn4Down&gt;:               LineUp() LineUp() LineUp()      \
                                        LineUp() LineUp()               \n\
        ~Shift&lt;Btn5Down&gt;:               LineDown() LineDown() LineDown() \
                                        LineDown() LineDown()           \n\
        Shift&lt;Btn4Down&gt;:                PageUp()                        \n\
        Shift&lt;Btn5Down&gt;:                PageDown()                      \n

i.e.: When Btn4Down events are received without the Shift key pressed,
call the "LineUp" translation 5 times (so each "click" of the wheel in the
upwards direction will make a Netscape window, textfield, dialog, whatever
scroll upwards 5 lines).  When Btn5Down events are received without Shift,
send LineDown translations.  

When Btn4 (wheel up) and Btn5 (wheel down) events are received *with* the
Shift key pressed, send PageUp and PageDown translations instead.

Easy, eh?  With the addition of 4 lines you've added wheel functionality
to an application which hasn't the faintest idea about how to use a mouse
wheel.

Note that you won't have to do that on some applications, because they
already grok the Z axis.  Examples that spring to mind are Mozilla, Eterm,
xmms (which uses the wheel as a volume control).  But when you have an 
application which ignores the wheel and you think, "y'know, it'd be really
handy if I could make /this/ happen when I move the wheel..." you actually
*can* make it happen by editing a few X resources.

The last caveat:  I have found that every now and then the PnP probe
to find out what kind of mouse I have will actually cause the mouse
to change protocols (because, of course, PnP doesn't work), which leads
to the mouse either not moving at all or moving in random directions 
because the wire protocol being used by moused doesn't match the wire
protocol used by the mouse.  On the other hand, I've found that XFree86
always gets it right the *first* time (i.e.: when I start the server from
scratch it always works, but server resets which occur when I logout will
occasionally leave the mouse in an indeterminate state).  My workaround
for that has been to edit /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers, and change the last line
from:

     :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X

to:
     :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -terminate

... which causes the X server to exit completely whenever a server reset
occurs (whereupon xdm will immediately restart it, and it'll get the PnP
probe right because it's the first one after the server has been started,
and everything will be happy).  

I hate the fact that I need that workaround;  it should "just work". 
Perhaps XFree86 4.0.2 will fix it :-)

Cheers,
