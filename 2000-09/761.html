John!

I'll take this with a grain of salt.

&gt; &gt; * it appears to be secure
&gt; 
&gt;         It 'appears' to be "secure".
&gt;         This statement does not fill me with confidence :)

I don't have the backing of the NSA, nor ASIO to prove that it is secure
or otherwise. I should remember that other people don't use the same
idioms, nor mindset that I do when I speak. You could retranslate "it
appears to be secure", to "in my opinion it is secure for the purpose
that it has been put to".

&gt;         A firewall is not a magic bullet. It will not stop insecure
&gt;         services from being insecure. All it will do it block any ports
&gt;         a human has forgotten to "switch off". (Is freesco stateful,
&gt;         or stateless?)

Again, a lack of definition on my part. The firewall - and the firewall
only - working as a bastion firewall works within a wholistic security
policy. Being based on Linux pre: 2.4.0 it would more than likely be
stateless.

&gt; &gt; This is all done in text. You can administer it by telnet (icck), web
&gt; &gt; browser (icck) or at the actual console. It understands DHCP, but it
&gt; 
&gt;         Telnet & web. Hmmmmm. This is for if you're running a web server on
&gt;         your firewall, I take it...?

Provided you don't instruct the install script to allow remote
administration, or remote telnet services they don't appear to be
accessible from the Internet.

&gt; &gt; does appear to be based on an older kernel that uses 2.0.38 - I say
&gt; &gt; "appear" because ipfwadm looks like it's on Robyn's disk.
&gt; 
&gt;         Was the NAI 'TCP spoof' bug fixed by 2.0.38??

Search <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A> 

&gt; &gt; distribution for this important service - simply because you then have
&gt; &gt; the utmost control of your firewall and router - you will buy yourself a
&gt; &gt; certain amount of protection using this product.
&gt; 
&gt;         I dispute that last sentence. Define what additional security is
&gt;         gained by merely installing a firewall.

Define what security you have if you have no firewall. You stated
yourself that a firewall will close ports a human has switched off. A
default RedHat Installation (6.2 but others as well) will allow "telnet"
from anywhere and possibly even "anonymous ftp". If a new user had
failed to check inetd but blocked incoming telnet and incoming ftp using
this, or another firewall, they are more secure.

Mind you, they should check inetd's configuration or turn it off during
a normal installation of Linux. I have no doubt someone will disagree
with the above statement. I have given a simple answer to a simple
question; presuming you do agree that installing a firewall of some type
can be part of a wider security policy - the context is that you do
agree - then your question is redundant, rhetorical or academic.

Given that you have actually asked me to define what additional security
is gained by merely installing a firewall, I shall twist that statement
into "I [John Brazel] am not entirely certain that merely installing a
firewall will increase security". Without an understanding of how one
can be compromised, lose data and other security issues I would be
inclined to agree with this statement. With an understanding - or a
desire to learn - about security issues, you will learn that firewalls
of various descriptions can be a useful part of a wholistic approach to
security. Even if only to clean up after human ignorance, forgetfulness
or plain laziness.

If you want to dispute the efficacy of adding a well configured packet
filtering firewall to a network:

* install RedHat 5.1 _default_ and RedHat 5.2 _default_ on a network
* connect one of them to the Internet
* tell me the IP

And I'll find the POP2 server crack. Before you do, you might want to
talk to Alan Kennington about that....

Now, if he'd actually blocked all services except the ones he knows he
wanted to use, it would have been slightly more difficult for a cracker
to crack the POP2 server. Probably not impossible, but more difficult.
More difficult to crack has a corollary which is more secure for me.

I assume that you and others will dispute this point too.

&gt;         Ummmm. It depends on what services you let through the firewall...
&gt;         Let the wrong ports in & out of the firewall, and the crackes probably
&gt;         won't even *realize* you're running a firewall.

Whilst I do tend to argue in a rather academic, pedantic fashion I'm not
entirely certain that one should write an entire thesis stating the
whole context of what one is saying and overviewing the whole field,
with references and a bibliography to an e-mail list.

&gt;         Any news on the SecureFest? I mailed RS, but he seems strangely
&gt;         silent on that front...

It is being discussed.
