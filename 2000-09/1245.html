Hi.

I posted this problem a little while ago but had little info to provide
the list.  It's happened again but I've managed to get some erros which
could give a clue as to what's wrong.

The problem is that when I start gnome-terminal from an icon or from the
gnome panel menu, it appears briefly and then vanished totally.  (I
should mention I'm running RH 6.1 and Helix Gnome 1.2.)

Luckily I had a couple of gnome-terminals open for the last few days;
they hadn't disappeared (i.e. something's happening to the machine so
that gnome-terminals in existence are okay but "new" ones that are
instantiated die off a second or so after they come into being).

So I went to one of the gnome-terminals that was running and typed
"gnome-terminal &".

The gnome-terminal came up, died, and what I got on the gnome-terminal I
typed the command was this:

Gdk-ERROR **: BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
  serial 1216 error_code 9 request_code 14 minor_code 0

[1]+  Exit 1                  gnome-terminal

So does anyone have any ideas what's wrong?  Is it a fault with GDK or
with the gnome-terminal program, or what?  Anyone else run into this
problem?  If you did, how did you rectify it?

Regards,

Paul Malcolm Bailey.
