Robyn,

"ssh" or "openssh" is a safe alternative to "telnet".
It's like the SSL of the telnet world.
I think it originated in the BSD world.
The idea is that it uses challenge-response
authentication instead of sending passwords in
clear over the net.
Therefore it is (fairly) immune to replay attacks.
The "ssh" documentation gives a description of how
they defeat various categories of attacks.

AT present, I keep connections open between machines on
two different sites, and I always use "ssh".
In fact, I turn off "telnet" completely on my most
important site, just incase I forget...

In this way, I can log in from a company overseas to my
home computer over the net, without the company I contract
for logging my passwords.
The software for ssh is at <A HREF="http://www.openssh.com/.">http://www.openssh.com/.</A>
Beware of openssh.org, which is a cybersquatter site.

Recently, someone in the States gave me an account on his
BSD machine. And he put a normal password in the system,
and I was able to use SSH in the normal way, using this
password.
But there's another useful mode of SSH which bypasses the
usual mechanisms and uses some other sort of cryptography
with encrypted public/private keys etc.
It's all in the documentation anyway.
It's all very technical...

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Sorry, I haven't the time to write a PS.
Too many things to do today...
