I have. a lot. One doctor at a practice I go to when I need to, is very
experienced. He KNOWS everything. He is also a total IDIOT. Having
experience does not mean he is good, it just means he is a survivor. 

Knowing about the workings of computers is a definite advantage for a
teacher of computing at school, but knowing about teaching is more
important. Whilst it is not an ideal situation, I'm sure there are plenty
of teachers out there that have been in the situation of being only a few
pages ahead of the class...

David, Coke has been drunk for a long time now, it just doesn't have the
kick it used to for some reason. :)
