Hi,

If Telstra wanted to detect if you where using IP-Masquerading, they could:

  Check for a statistically high number of outgoing connections from
    ports 61000-65096 (to which I say, modify them in include/net/ip_masq.h
    before compiling your kernel).
  Check for unusual TTL values on your packets (fluctuations between 63,
    127 and 254 for various OS types behind the firewall).

But why bother, so they can sell you another IP for a few dollars?  
Technically it is not so difficult.  The public relations/physical 
investigation overhead would hopefully be too high.

&gt; Telstra can't really tell if you have Masq. as it appears to be comming

&gt; 
&gt; I would imagine that if you asked Telstra, they'd say that you would
&gt; have to
&gt; use the 'Small Business ADSL Service' instead of home..
&gt; 
&gt; But really, they can't go into your house or whatever and poke around
&gt; without
&gt; your prior consent.
&gt; 
&gt; If I had ADSL in my area, I would definately be doing that.. It's just
&gt; like
&gt; doing the same for ISDN, Frame Relay, FDDI etc...
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think Telstra won't be actively fighting against this, as
&gt; policing
&gt; it would be an absolute nightmare.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone read the fine print on the Helstra ADSL stuff?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you buy your Internet access off them (reasonable package, including the
&gt; &gt; cost of ADSL gear) you are allowed to have only one user per connection.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Now, this refers to only one computer connected, and only one person sitting
&gt; &gt; at that computer.  What happens if I connect my gateway/firewall/etc to the
&gt; &gt; ADSL modem and then use IPMasq to "pretend" that many users are only one
&gt; &gt; user?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone come up agains this yet?  What do you think Telstra will do about
&gt; &gt; that?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt; Adam
