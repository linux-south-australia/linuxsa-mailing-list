Just an added note to this.  One of the most popular ways of gaining
access remotely to a box is through the "buffer overflow" exploit.
Immunix (from memory) has been compiled with a special version of
the gcc compiler that is designed to make it a lot harder to exploit
these buffer overflows, so exploits like "AK's" in.pop2d, and bind,
go out the window.  However, it still isn't the universal panacea.

As do most Unices :-)  I still remember an MCSE being impressed that
I could change addresses on a NIC without rebooting.  :-)
