&gt; sorry, but I have been watching this thread with interest and just have to
&gt; make a few comments.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The attack actually happened 2 months ago, but I only just
&gt; &gt;discovered it because my KDE on my main workstation locked up,
&gt; Don't people go through their logs, even if everything appears to be
&gt; alright.  So many potential problems can be fixed by simply having a quick
&gt; wander through your logs at least once a week.  You are also more likely to
&gt; notice an attack of some kind and knock them on the head.  Another moral to
&gt; the story perhaps?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Now, if I don't want to disconnect from the net, I've got to go back
&gt; &gt;and take the advice I've been receiving for so many years,
&gt; &gt;and use a default-deny policy for security.
&gt; why did u change or/and y not listening?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Once again, it's lack of time.
&gt; &gt;No one's paying me $100 an hour to do this.
&gt; &gt;I'm _losing_ $100 per hour by doing this security work.
&gt; I certainly wouldn't say that your losing $100 per hour, look at it as an
&gt; investment in knowledge for yourself and possibly others, that certainly
&gt; can't be a waste of time.
&gt; I wish I got $100 per hour for my computing work :(
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;1. I connect to the net 24 hours a day, while there
&gt; &gt;are about 60 port scans every day of all my IP addresses.
&gt; &gt;Just connecting to the net is a __big__ risk factor.
&gt; of course, but 60 scans a day is a pretty large amount, The ISP I work for
&gt; would be unlucky to get that many every couple of days  I would be thinking
&gt; that quite a few ppl know about your system and are trying to exploit it,
&gt; My system is on the net 24/7 and in the last 2 weeks I've only had 13
&gt; portscans of my system. You definately would want to look into that.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt; But, if you go looking, you will find security exploits in both, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; you will see protective measures way faster in the open source systems.
&gt; &gt;Also, this occured to me.  You will far more often find Unix boxes
&gt; &gt;protecting NT boxes than vice versa.
&gt; Probably because a patch can be applied easily and quickly on open source
&gt; software instead of having to wait for the owners of the closed source
&gt; software to write patches (weeks, possibly even months or even the next OS)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;On a related subject, maybe linuxSA could organise
&gt; &gt;a security-fest. E.g. a weekend, or just one day on a
&gt; &gt;week-end, of seminars on linux security.
&gt; That wouldn't be a bad idea.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Those who are paid to teach this stuff will not want
&gt; &gt;to work for free. But for the rest of us, putting together
&gt; Umm why not? Most of them would not mind imparting a bit of knowledge to
&gt; other ppl to help them understand the benefits, reasons and concerns of
&gt; security.
&gt; But then again hold a few notes in front of someones face and they will do
&gt; _almost_ anything :))
&gt; 
&gt; Just my 0.05 c (you try and find a 2c peice :))
&gt; cya

-----------------------------------------------------------

Just remembered, on TL Server we ship with all port closed and
TCP_wrapper active, but our default install also installs "trip-wire"
that informs you of scans and attempted exploits.

So if your running RH see if you can get a copy, so since you guys are
so slack to check you logs, this will help you with your security
monitoring.
