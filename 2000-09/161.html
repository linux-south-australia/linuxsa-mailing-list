&gt; Actually, I've been entertaining this idle thought lately - if
&gt; there's money to be made in hardware, why not build a router
&gt; where the OS is open sourced?  I seem to remember at some stage
&gt; that you had a passion for ASIC Ethernet switches - did anything
&gt; ever come of that?

Funny you should mention that.
Lately I've been doing some 155 Mbit/sec ATM switch stuff
with a mum's and dad's K6-2/400 which I bought for A$900 new
(excl monitor, but including 20-24% sales tax, before July).
No problems with speed (working in the linux kernel).

Someone told me they run 400 Mbits/sec continuously on 3 ATM
cards simultaneously. (I think that's 400 Mbits/sec total,
not each.) That was on a P III/600 or something.

Now if you're only talking about 10 and 100 Mbit/sec links,
this surely can be done by a 400 MHz processor with no problems
at all.
The only problem is lack of PIC slots etc.
I think I read somewhere that you can get cards which do
multiple ethernet links.


It would be a pushover to develop IP routers with linux boxes
and put Cisco out of business.
I truly don't see why it hasn't been done.
Some of the specs I've seen for Cisco routers are less than
impressive.

Conclusion:
I don't think you need much special hardware.

Just a thought.

Hmmm.
I saw this lately too:
This company:

<A HREF="http://www.basystems.com/">http://www.basystems.com/</A>

Broadband Access Systems recently announced that their 
switching/routing gear is running linux.
Their 1 MByte excessively glossy spec document (PDF)
says that their gear runs at between 200 Bbit/sec
and 25 Tbit/sec or 20 million packets/sec,
using 18,000 Mips of processor power.

So I think it's all been done.
But they _do_ use special hardware.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
