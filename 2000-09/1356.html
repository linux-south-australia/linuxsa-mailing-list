Hi Adam,

I can get you past having to get a new box as I've got a few floppy 
controller cards around the place somewhere. I could install this if you need 
it.

&gt; Hi all.  Below is a cutout from my system log.  What I wish to bring to
&gt; your attention is the second-last line (Infinite loop). After the infinite
&gt; loop line, the Ethernet interface is USELESS.  Actually, the kernel appears
&gt; to shut down the card (the active light for yoda goes out on my hub). 
&gt; Logging in locally at the terminal and restarting the eth0 interface will
&gt; not cure the problem.  The syslog says that the interface has been
&gt; restarted but the light for yoda on the hub stays out, and the other
&gt; computers cannot access it.
&gt;
&gt; I have had no trouble with the system until just recently.  It has been
&gt; running for nearly 12 months and the only failures have been for power
&gt; outages.  The server is RH6.1.  Kernel is version 2.2.5-22 that shipped
&gt; with RH6.1.  There are two things that I think might be wrong.  Recently
&gt; Win2kPro was installed on one of the boxes. Win2k is a pig, as it refuses
&gt; to talk nicely to the Samba server and when the Win2k box is on network
&gt; traffic is high as the Win2k bix insists on being master browser.
&gt;
&gt; I run NFS, Samba, IP-Masq, DNS and a few other small things (seti, etc).
&gt;
&gt; The other thing is that I installed autofs on my other Linux box to mount
&gt; the NFS exports from yoda automatically when I change to
&gt; /exports/yoda/&lt;certain directory&gt;.  This appears to work well however, and
&gt; I cannot see it being the cause of the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Any help in sorting the problem would be useful, as I do not want to have
&gt; to reinstall the software on the server.  Actually, reinstalling is not an
&gt; option as the floppy controller in the machine is most excellently cooked
&gt; and will not let you use floppy disks at all.  The bios does not support
&gt; booting from CD-ROMS either, so if reinstalling is the only option then I
&gt; will need to get another box!
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for all your help in advance,
&gt; Adam
