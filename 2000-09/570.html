 &gt; Keeping up with all the latest bugs is not easy.
 &gt; I just scanned through the last 24 hours of
 &gt; Linux Today <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/">http://linuxtoday.com/</A> and found:
    [ stuff ]
 &gt; That's about 300 or so bug fixes per year.
 &gt; At one hour each on average, that's about 300 hours per year.

Nowhere near.  If you set up the system right in the first place, and have
a realistic appreciation of the risk, you can treat most advisories as
simple checklist items.

 &gt; How much is that in lost productivity?

Compared to, say, having some hacker blast the crap out of your
network, steal and delete your data, and kick you off the net
for days?

As Daryl said earlier in this thread, you seem to consider security
to be an extra added detail which you can do without;  Even here you're
arguing *against* the need to keep up with security advisories and 
keep your software up to date.

I don't understand that attitude.  What we're talking about here is
an investment in the safety of your data and the integrity of your network.
If you don't make the investment, or if you make the wrong investment,
you lose your network.  If you do, you never need to worry about it.

 &gt; This is why I say that it is not very reality-oriented to blame the
 &gt; victim. 

Do you take the same attitude to the concept of locking your car?
If the manufacturer of your car released a full-page recall ad in the
paper to inform you that the door and ignition locking mechanism 
in your model of car was faulty and could be opened with a paperclip
in 3 seconds, would you (a) follow the advice in the recall notice,
taking your car to a service outlet to have the lock replaced, or (b)
ignore it because it's all too much hassle?

Once that full-page ad has been widely publicized, will you absolve
yourself of all responsiblity if your car gets stolen, or will you kick
yourself and say, "DAMN!  I knew I should have done that, everyone told
me I should have done it, the newspaper made it quite clear, what was
I thinking?"

While you say it isn't reality-oriented to blame the victim, I'd contend
that it also isn't very reality-oriented to put 100% of the blame on an
attacker if the vector they've used for penetrating your defences is 
well-known, widely publicized, and easily fixed.  There's mutual
responsibility here -- The attacker is culpable for breaking in, sure,
but the sysadmin is negligent for not bothering to maintain the system
in the first place.

 &gt; I think that anyone who wants to connect their home computer
 &gt; to the net 24 hours/day should think very carefully indeed about
 &gt; just how much time they have to spare for this constant source
 &gt; of amusement and drama.

Try as I might, Alan, I can't concur with that.  I've had my network
connected to the 'net permanently since 1991 or thereabouts, and have
never had a single breakin.  I've worked for companies which have had
permanent internet links over the same period of time, and they haven't
had any breakins either.

I take a bit of time to make sure I'm running recent versions of
everything, I spend 30 seconds perusing each advisory I see to make
sure it doesn't affect me, or to fix it if it does, and that's fine -- I
know my setup isn't the most secure in the world, but the principles
of risk management I follow tell me that that doesn't really matter.  

It doesn't take a lot of time, I don't need to expend a lot of effort or
headspace, and I don't spend my nights lying awake at night wondering
whether someone is breaking into my system.  Acting on advisories doesn't
take long;  Where I do need to take action, it's almost always sufficient
to simply remove the setuid bit from vulnerable programs until I have
time to deal with them properly, so it's a pretty easy burden to manage.

So I can't understand why you seem to think it's such a big problem.  On
one hand you're telling us that you've been looking after UNIX systems for
12 years, but on the other hand you're telling us that one of the basic
principles of system management (for UNIX or otherwise) is foreign and
burdensome to you.  I don't get it -- What's the problem?
