Actually, I had further thoughts about this, and couldn't let them
past.  NT cops flak because MS market it as a "superior operating
system", yet you have to reboot it whenever you install any software
packages (and until recently, whenever you changed network settings).
Printer drivers shouldn't cause a kernel to blue-screen, but by golly
I've seen it happen in a corporate environment.  If Microsoft sold NT
on its _merits_ alone, it would have far less penetration in the
marketplace than it does now.  Purposely ripping off Kerberos and
proprietising it to make it incompatible with other Kerberos systems
that have been around for years just reeks of the same arrogance and
pigheadedness that is endemic throughout that entire corporation.

_That_ is why NT cops flak (at least, from this quarter).
