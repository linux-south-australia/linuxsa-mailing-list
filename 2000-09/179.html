I wasn't thinking of PCs.  Although PCs are COTS hardware,
the bus bandwidth limitations in PCs have always left little
to be desired (and every chance to improve always seems to
be a kludge, in my eyes).  I can't remember the speed of the
PCI bus off the top of my head (133 MHz?).

&gt; No problems with speed (working in the linux kernel).

I'm not thinking Linux kernel, either.  I'm thinking of
routing done more in hardware than software (but of course,
you could get great flexibility in using Linux as the
OS executive).

&gt; Now if you're only talking about 10 and 100 Mbit/sec links,
&gt; this surely can be done by a 400 MHz processor with no problems
&gt; at all.

Nope, wasn't even thinking of that.  I was thinking of routers
with modular subchassis, containing interfaces.

As I said, mere idle speculation.

&gt; Conclusion:
&gt; I don't think you need much special hardware.

You do at the high end.
