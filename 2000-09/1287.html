Greg, 

I think what Andrew was asking was if it possible to program it, 
and where the information is to do this.
 
My points: 

1. Yes (it must be possible).  

2. Under X11, the application is responsible for redrawing itself (is
   this different to windows?) when it receives an expose event.  (I
   would expect) that there are also resize events, issued by the
   window manager, but these need to also be supported by the
   application.

3. I looking for a 'Click here to release the source code' GUI
   application (similar in style to the 'Click here to receive bonus'
   app. under windows for those that have seen it)., which does
   everything in its power to allow (force?) you to click 'YES'.
   (There might be a choise of license!)
   (The windows app. does the opposite.)

&gt; &gt; Good morning all hoopy X programmers. Some web searching has failed to
&gt; &gt; enlighten me, so I have a question for you: is it possible to alter the
&gt; &gt; geometry of a window in X from the command line, after the window is up
&gt; &gt; and running?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If so, can someone please point me in the right place to learn how to do
&gt; &gt; this?
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think so.  That's a window manager function, and I don't know
&gt; of any managers which cater for this.  Is there a problem with using
&gt; the mouse?
