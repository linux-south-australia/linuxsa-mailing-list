&gt; If you work in a smaller company not on a Microsoft Select agreement this
&gt; could be a powerful non-technical tool when it comes to working out OS
&gt; strategy and budgets.

As an aside, AARNet and CAUDIT have negotiated several "fallback"
contracts with suppliers.    If you choose these suppliers as
your primary supplier, then you should be able to get a better
price.  But if you use another vendor's product and only buy
an occassional product from one of these suppliers, then you
don't need to pay full RRP.

We currently have agreements with Adobe, Microsoft and Cisco.  We
had an agreement with StarDivision, but this isn't too relevant
anymore.  We are seeking agreements with Nortel and some other
network equipment suppliers.

The impact to academic Linux users is that you can move to Linux
without being gouged if you buy a few technical Microsoft products that
have no Linux equivalent (Project and Visio[1] for example).

 [1] Yes I know "dia" is working towards being a Visio clone,
     and is currently a good drawing package.  But if you need
     to draw a set of interlinked technical diagrams today...
