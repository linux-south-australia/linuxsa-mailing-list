Not anytime soon.

ISP's that currently enjoy an indefinate free lease on their IPv4 space
will have to switch to paying a non-trivial annual fee for IPv6 space,
that alone will discourage smaller networks from switching.

The transition between v4 and v6 will also require some sort of NAT
proxy between the old space and the new space. Currently ipv6 blocks are
only being handed out to large ISP's, who are the worst candidates for
implementing a v6-to-v4 gateway, since present-day technology is likely
to melt under the load of NAT'ing a decent backbone.

IPv6 will most likely become reality not through the Internet as we know
it, but as a result of Mobile phones and similar devices requiring a
distinct address. There are more mobile phone users than Internet users,
and in places like Japan they are already offering Internet facilities
with every new phone.
