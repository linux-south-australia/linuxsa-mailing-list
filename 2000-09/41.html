&gt; Hrmm.. I should have said this, oh well - It just stays connected with no
&gt; data flow.

Well, it could then be a variety of reasons:

1)  It could be waiting for input.
2)  It may be hung up on some resource it may not be able to get at
    (coded relative paths, for instance, + insufficient error handling).
3)  It may not be flushing its output (although this should happen
    on the termination of the script).

Have you tried constructing a simpler perl script?  Something like:

--- Cut here for a new monitor ---
#!/usr/bin/env perl

print "Perl test\n";
exit 0;
--- Cut here for a new monitor ---

and then connecting to that?

&gt; Nothing seems to come up in the logs.  I'm assuming the syslog level would
&gt; be covered by *.info

Should be.  As usual, the man pages don't tell you what facility and
priority inetd logs at :-(, but I seem to remember RedHat's default
covers it.

&gt; The following two entries were included in the file as default, but have
&gt; always been #ed out so I would assume this means that tcpd defaults to only
&gt; looking in certain paths, but may also go for full path/program names.
&gt; 
&gt; #systat stream  tcp     nowait  guest   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /bin/ps -auwwx
&gt; #netstat        stream  tcp     nowait  guest   /usr/sbin/tcpd
&gt; in/netstat    -f inet

As I said, this used to be the case.  It's been 4+ years since I've
looked at the source to tcp wrapper.
