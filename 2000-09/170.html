Hi all,

I haven't posted to the list for a while my linux box is running fine at the 
moment and I am learning new things every day. Hey I even went out an bought 
SAMS teach yourself SAMBA in 24 hours (Great book Richard) well it works, by 
reading that book I was able to download the latest SAMBA compile it for 
RH6.2, install and configure it without any hitches.

Now the security related stuff: A few questions

I am concerned about the security of my linux box...
My setup...
basically I am using IPFWADM, setup by a fellow linux user at the 
installfest for me. It is set to deny all, but allows communications on 
certain ports and 1 to 1024 from inside the LAN to outside the LAN but 
NOTHING IS ALLOWED IN, only traffic that leaves. All services are turned off 
except for http, telnet and ftp, I think. (Where do I find this??)
Telnet is set to allow in only from my IP address range on the LAN which are 
internet routable Telstra IP's. FTP is the same. The server is acting as a 
webserver on standard port 80. I telnet into the machine from the LAN 
regularly to configure things. I dont need to worry about security on the 
LAN, it is only small, 5-6 users, and none of them have any idea about linux 
or telnet. I have SAMBA running through inetd and also SWAT is running on 
901, but I tried to access it from outside on another isp and it didn't work 
so apparently that is fine.
The server is also using Sendmail 8.9.3 for email. It is the primary MX. I 
am using telstras secondary MX. Mail cannot be accessed from outside the 
LAN, only inside from the ip addresss range that I have from telstra.

What I want to know is whether this sounds secure or not? I am really on 
edge about security, because if someone does manage to muck up my server, I 
am afraid that either I will not even realise that they are doing it or I 
won't be able to fix it and will be left without a website!!!

Any suggestions (by the way I am still a relatively newbie to linux, no 
complicated stuff pls. If so please explain in "baby talk" coz I don't 
understand a lot of the lingo yet!!!

p.s. I also update my website from an external source the way that I do this 
is to ring up and ask my colleague to run pcANYWHERE for me, it gets left 
running all night on a private telephone number on a computer with the 
monitor turned off. Doesn't matter whether it is turned on anyway. I dial up 
to that machine login, file transfer the webpages to that machine, then copy 
across the microsoft network into the www directory on the server. From that 
machine using pcANYWHERE.


I also have some more questions mainly about apache, will post in the next 
message..

Thanks to anyone who can offer assistance.

Regards,

Michael Kratz
