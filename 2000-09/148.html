give them execute permission on the folders (also, test this by enabling a
telnet and see if those users can see the folders with normal unix commands
-- that way, you should be able to tell if it's a Unix permissions problem,
or a Samba issue.)

Hey all :)

I've asked this before; however I really *need* an answer (and the question
is slightly different).
I've setup a linux box acting as a samba box, basicallly validates
passwords, has a logon script (batch file) for the win98 workstations to map
drives, etc...

I have configured two groups, Group A and Group B.
Essentially:
each user has H: mapped to their home directory (/home/GROUP/USERNAME)

However, Group B will need to be able to browse, view (and preferably not
edit, but it doesnt matter that much) all of Group A's home folders.

I have mapped S: to /home/GroupA (with valid users being groupb, in
smb.conf) however, they can see the folders in this drive, but cannot enter
the folders (with an access denied error).  This is obviously because they
are not the owner.

I need to somehow make GroupB "own" GroupA's files.. so GroupB can view
them.  GroupA ONLY has read/write access to their home folder/drive, that's
it.  GroupB will need read/write access to their home folder [this is
already configured] but ALSO read (again, preferably not write, but if this
the only option) access to GroupA's files.

The users cannot telnet in / gain shell access, this has been disabled.  It
is purely for samba.

Thankyou
Ryan

P.S. There are several reasons why I'm not using a NT box, which has been
decided some time ago.  So this is not an option :)
