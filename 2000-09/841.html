&gt;  &gt; Moral of story:
&gt;  &gt; If you rely on "ssh" as your only way to log in to a machine,
&gt;  &gt; then you risk losing all contact.
&gt; 
&gt; Sigh.

I must agree with Mark here Alan. With literally hundreds of client
machines, all using ssh, I have never ever ever ever had a problem
with sshd. It installs and runs first time, and continues to run every
time.

Just a bit more empirical evidence that you may have done something
wrong.

&gt; Hundreds of thousands of ssh users would disagree.  You're doing
&gt; something wrong, Alan, and it's apparently unique to you.  I don't
&gt; know what it is, because you haven't provide anywhere near enough
&gt; information to permit a credible diagnosis;  But I do know that in
&gt; over five years of ssh usage, on literally hundreds of machines, I
&gt; have never once seen a failure of sshd.  Not once.  It starts at
&gt; boot-time, and it runs until the system is shut down, with 100%
&gt; emperical reliability.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The OpenSSH software is clearly not yet at the level of
&gt;  &gt; reliability that you would want to place too much trust in it.

I couldn't disagree more.

Come and listen to Geoffrey's talk tonight about ssh, and then after
that I'd be genuinely interested in hearing what possible argument
exists for using anything else.

Cheers

Alex!
