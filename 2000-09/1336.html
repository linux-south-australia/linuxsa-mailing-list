Thanks very much Paul. It is always good to know about freeware. I can
hardly claim that SID generation doesn't interest me what with Samba and
all that, can I :-)

SID generation is very important if you want to generate images of NT
machines that then use SMB on a network. My own experience has been that
if you are in a situation where SID generation _isn't_ important then it
is time to have a hard look at the application and see if it needs NT at
all. Maybe it is (for example you just happen to need a machine that
doesn't talk SMB that runs an application unique to Windows) but often it
is a sign of an embedded application that would be better done with
something else more manageable.

Guys,

I was browsing through the linuxsa list archives and
came across you comments about Zenworks type
functionality.  In regards to a SID generator you
obviously didn't serach very hard :)

I don't subscribe to the lsit and there can't post to
it, but if one of you wants to pass this onto the list
someone else may find it useful.

Regards,
Paul
