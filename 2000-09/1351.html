Extract of a reply to someone about ACLs in Linux+Samba which might be
relevant.

&gt; ... SAMBA is restricted to the file system's
&gt; permissions, which under Linux is basically file and group. I am just
&gt; comparing this to NetWare which has quite a comprehensive permissions
&gt; scheme.

There are two kinds of ways in which rich permissions might be required in
this environment. One is at the Linux level only, so that clever
administrative things could be done with groups and many different kinds
of permissions in and ACL (access control list) approach and Samba would
see the results. This is functionality that a filesystem and kernel can
provide. It is seen in HP-UX, VMS, Solaris, VMS and so on. It isn't part
of traditional Unix, the designers deliberately avoided this approach in
coming up with the user/group permission scheme. ACLs are not part of
ext2. Nevertheless there are quite a few ways of doing this with Linux,
and it is completely possible. I can help you through some of the options
if you are interested. Samba need know nothing whatsoever about these ACLs
and how they are done, all Samba needs to know is whether it can provide
access to a file or not.

Alternatively there is the NT ACLs issue. Samba has the ability to present
to SMB clients a very NT-like permission structure, complete with the
ability to manage these permissions. Of course there must be the ability
in the underlying filesystem to supply ACL-like functionality in some way,
and a specific Samba shim must be written to perform the mapping for each
kind of undelying ACL subsystem. This is less likely to be what you want,
but it may be. The more integrated the NT network is with other NT domains
the more likely you might want to use this. Personally I'd rather steer
clear of this approach, not because it is bad or doesn't work well, but
simply because it is embedding NT thinking ever deeper into the network.
