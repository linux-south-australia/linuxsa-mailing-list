Hi Andrew,

I too use VMware in full screen but you can switch back to the VMware
control window by using

Ctrl-Alt-F7 and then back to full screen with Ctrl-Alt-F8

I setup VMware in a pager window out of the way, start windows(or whatever
you are running in
VMware) full- screen and toggle between Linux and VMware using the
previously described key
sequence. I realise that you have two monitors, is this the only reason you
run them or are
there other requirements for the second monitor ??

Regards, Grant

&gt; &gt; I don't think so.  That's a window manager function, and I don't know

&gt;
&gt; There is :-)
&gt;
&gt; Okay - some more information is in order. I've just got myself a very
&gt; froody dual head setup under XFree86 4.0.1. I would really love to have
&gt; VMware in full screen mode on one of the monitors.
&gt;
&gt; But full screen mode in VMware wants to take over the whole X display,
&gt; so I can't use it's full screen option.
&gt;
&gt; So, I figured I could start VMware in the right geometry so that the top
&gt; left of the virtual machine, excluding borders of the program, was at
&gt; 0,0. Then, with the virtual machine at the same resolution as the
&gt; monitor, it would work fine!
&gt;
&gt; But then I can't power off the VMware machine because I can't get the
&gt; mouse to the Power Off button!
&gt;
&gt; Thus my desire to move a window about from the command line.
&gt;
&gt; (I suppose I could also, rather than run a dual head system, just run
&gt; two X servers, one on each monitor and do it that way - but my looking
&gt; at X docos hasn't helped in that respect either).
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has some ideas, please let me know!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
