Question about 1 msec resolution timers.

--------------------------------------------------
My apologies for continually asking so many
questions, but....

I really need a 1 msec or better resolution timer
in the linux kernel.
Is there such a thing?

I know there's a not-very-real-time 10 msec timer,
but that just isn't good enough.
In my application, that would correspond to
about 350 kBytes of data.

I'm aware that the Intel/AMD chips have a sort of
1 usec clock which can be read in about 170 nsec
to know what the time is, but I really need to
have a wake-up (preferably a hardware interrupt)
every 1 msec to service buffers etc. etc.

So far, I haven't found anything suitable in documentation
or source files.

Thanks in advance for any help on this.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

------------------------------------------------
PS. About the security things I was talking about before,
I've now taken these actions:

1.	Rip out (almost) all .rhosts files, and replaced
	as much as possible with ssh - no using triple DES
	with RSA authentication from one side of the living
	room to the other.

2.	Obtained RPMs of (hopefully) fixed "cron"
	software from redhat.com for RH5.2 machines,
	and from suse.com for SUSE6.2 machines.

3.	Converted my firewall to very conservative values,
	so that several small useful things don't work 
	any more. But that's the cost of security, I guess.
	I've decided to just not permit FTP.
	All trusted users (web authors) for my system
	must now get SSH software for their windows
	machines to publish their material.
	And when I fetch stuff with FTP, I have to use
	two sacrifical machines which are outside
	the firewall - and then I use scp (i.e. ssh) to
	copy the files to the behind-the-firewall machines.

I think this is all ridiculous.
But now I've tightened it all up, and I can rest it bit
more easily for a while - until the next juvenile
delinquent decides to apply the latest script to
my site!!
