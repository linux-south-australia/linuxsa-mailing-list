Johnathon!

&gt; I would like to backup various linux workstations to a tape drive on an
&gt; NT box. I have heard you can run a samba client on the linux machines
&gt; and mount the smb share. Does anyone have any experience/thoughts on how
&gt; well this works ?

The SMB protocol, as implemented by SAMBA, is quite reliable. Whilst I'm
unfamiliar with the NT Backup programs I'm sure they're as reliable as
any other Microsoft provided solution...

&gt; On the NT box I will then have linux files locally which I want to
&gt; backup to tape - do the various NT backup utils cope with linux files OK
&gt; ??

I don't particularly see why not.

&gt; I've done it the other way round (Pc's being backed up on a Samba
&gt; server), but have no experience with this.

Personally I'd take the tape out of the NT machine, and put it in a
Linux machine running AMANDA (<A HREF="http://www.amanda.org/">http://www.amanda.org/</A>) but that's just my
own choice...you've probably got other restrictions on what you can use
and how to do it.
