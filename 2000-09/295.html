&gt;Further to what Benjamin Close &lt;<A HREF="mailto:linux@senet.com.au">linux@senet.com.au</A>&gt; said:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; You can load any module you want in /etc/rc.d/rc.local or the more eligant
&gt;&gt; way is to get the kernel to load the modules for you. When accessing the
&gt;
&gt;As Benjamin points out it is generally possible, and always better to
&gt;let the kernel handle the loading of modules.  However, there are
&gt;occasions when a module must be explicitly loaded, and loaded early.
&gt;
&gt;One example: if you have an IDE cdrom as well as an IDE cdwriter.  You
&gt;can tell the ide-cd module to ignore the cdwriter, but you cannot tell
&gt;the ide-scsi module to ignore the cdrom.  So it is vitally important
&gt;that the ide-cd module be loaded first.
&gt;
&gt;"rc.local" is one option.  However, I am not sure that it is used in
&gt;recent RedHat distributions!  Specifically, any mention of it is missing
&gt;from "/etc/inittab", "/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit", or "/etc/rc.d/rc" and I
&gt;have had no luck putting commands in there. 

rc.local is linked to from S99local in at least run levels 2,3 and 5, or
was the last time I looked, which was on my Linux course in Canberra a week
or so ago.

As to why the commands didn't work, I am not sure, but perhaps there were
other errors.

&gt;                                            Instead, the file
&gt;"/etc/rc.d/rc.modules" is earmarked for starting modules.  Well
&gt;actually, you won't find a whisper about it in the RedHat documentation,
&gt;but you can see for yourself that it is run from "rc.sysinit".  So if
&gt;you were running RedHat you might write something like
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;#! /bin/sh
&gt;# 
&gt;# /etc/rc.d/rc.modules
&gt;#
&gt;#   - Load modules.  Called from /etc/rc.sysinit.
&gt;# 
&gt;
&gt;# The two modules ide-cd, and ide-scsi will both attempt to claim IDE cdroms
&gt;# for themselves.  ide-cd is well behaved, in that it can be told to ignore
&gt;# devices.  ide-scsi is not!
&gt;
&gt;/sbin/modprobe ide-cd
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;into "/etc/rc.d/modules" (make sure it is executable.)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Recently I have started playing with debian (thanks to Michael and
&gt;Richard!).  Guess what?  You just put the name of the module to start
&gt;at boot time into "/etc/modules".  It says so in the comments to
&gt;"/etc/modules" and also in `man modules`.  Spot the difference.
&gt;
