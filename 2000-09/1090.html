Hi,

&gt; Been thinking about all these security issues brought up in the past
&gt; couple of weeks on the list.
&gt; Surely it's just people like me that only use dial-up connections to an
&gt; ISP and maybe have a small home network that are ignorant of these
&gt; things?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway I was wondering how many people use insecure protocols such as
&gt; telnet?

Where I work, for most non sysadmins, its still the connection protocol of
choiuce, but partly for historical reasons. Mpostly its to access email,
and that is becomming increasingly more by secure web page. Locally it'd
be more, but in theory the Hubs, Switches and Riouters in the Uni network
are secure from loggers, particularly with in a department. 

&gt; So I had a look at some SARNO traffic statistics:
&gt; 
&gt; For the month of September (up till 24th) only 0.114% of all traffic was
&gt; using telnet. Still that's 1586.29MB!
&gt; I'm assuming that this traffic is just through the universities, CSIRO
&gt; and Defense - organizations I would have thought would be especially
&gt; security conscious.
&gt; Especially as 14% of telnet traffic was through Defense!!!
&gt; 

On the network I can actually log, a full 30% of traffic is Telnet, tho
that includes telnet past the firewall into the Uni, and telnet to Muds,
so the statistics would be larger than an "average" network.

cya
