Thankyou everyone for your email, I didn't quite expect so much. I'll try
to get around to each reply as quickly as possible.

First of all, to all those who asked me about my recent employment
history, I'm not sure that it really matters! But still: Yes, until
recently I was employed by Linuxcare; Yes I decided to leave; No, this
does not mean that the company is about to collapse (!!) and Yes, I still
think that Linuxcare has one of the top development teams in Australia,
staffed by people I am sure I will always get on well with. I think I'm
now with one of the other top teams, that's all. I suppose people change
jobs all the time, in fact my 15-year average is pretty low :-) Hmm, I'm
not sure this is really a core list topic.

As to Tellurian and the work at Tellurian:

  1) Tellurian is a small company in Adelaide that has distinguished
     itself by being largely invisible over the last 8 years while
     keeping a healthy throughput of substantial IT contracts. Our largest
     customers are IBM and Optus. It would be fair to say that the
     website (such as it is) says between little and nothing about
     Tellurian's capabilities. That should change in the next week or
     so. Look at it this way: we've had no problem whatsoever getting
     work so far, but now we are moving into a growth phase and clearly
     we need to do many things differently.

  2) More and more of Tellurian's work is to do with open source software
     in one way or another. We are trying to increase that rate of change.
     What we are looking for is knowledge about some aspect of software
     development and/or the interface where software and hardware meet,
     together with general enthusiasm and willingness to learn more. We
     cover database, GUI, cross-platform development, device drivers,
     physical machinery control, communications and other areas along with
     the usual things that come with the territory such as system 
     administration.

And if you have any more questions I'll be glad to try to answer them!
