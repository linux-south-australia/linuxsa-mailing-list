&gt;&gt; Using FTP, I get about 1.8MB/s out of this combination on a 500 MB file.
&gt;&gt; CPU utilization on the serving machine hits 65% at times, with most of that

&gt;
&gt;Richard,
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you're being affected by the infamous delay x bandwidth problem
&gt;in TCP.

Hmmm, I don't think so. These delay-bandwidth problems occur when the
bandwidth is large, and the RTT is long, as in high-speed cross-country
links or satelite links.

While the bandwidth of my link is high, the RTT is low, less than 1mS is
possible.

However, on closer examination, what I am seeing is that the window (32768
or there abouts) is closing and staying closed for a long time, as if the
receiving side is doing a sync after writing to the file or something like
that.

I will have to try with a memory file system to see if I can remove the
file system delays, or something else.

&gt;Do you find the same performance with rcp?
&gt;Of course, you should use "scp" instead.
&gt;(Use nothing less secure than triple-DES on a cross-over cable,  
&gt;I always say.)
&gt;
&gt;If you are delay x BW limited then the dealy would be
&gt;
&gt;delay = (window size) / bandwidth
&gt;      = 32 kBytes / (14 Mbits/sec)
&gt;      = 18 msec.
&gt;
&gt;So if you have any sort of average 18 msec delay in the total loop,
&gt;this would explain it.
&gt;Maybe it's some sort of processing time thing, or interrrupts by
&gt;the disk drive.
&gt;If you could copy from RAM disk, this would eliminate disk overhead
&gt;as a cause.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Looking at the packet to packet times on the wire with Ethereal, there are
&gt;&gt; enormous delays at times, like up to 10mS between an ACK and the next TCP
&gt;&gt; segment from the server, at other times 6mS or 3mS is not unusual, while at
&gt;&gt; other times micro seconds are the differences.
&gt;
&gt;That's getting into the right sort of delay range.
&gt;
&gt;Can you somehow manually change the window size for FTP?
&gt;Or on the command line or something?
&gt;It's a setsockopt option or something.
&gt;Another test possibility would be to do simple
&gt;TCP test program to test program tests.
&gt;If a simple server/client pair gets the same result, then
&gt;probably it's a TCP layer problem, because then you've
&gt;eliminated disk access as a cause.
&gt;In a test program, you could change the sock option for
&gt;TX window and see if that's the problem.
&gt;

&gt;Alan Kennington.
