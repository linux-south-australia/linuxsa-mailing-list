Hi.

Yes, I can comment.

I recently (ok, a month or so ago) set up VMWare on my dual celeron box
with RedHat 6.2

I was dissapinted with the quality of the documentation, resulting in a
working Win95 install on the second go around. Windows install was
painfully slow.

The VMWare I used was one of the first to include the vmware-tools in the
program, rather than a separate download. This was hopelessly poorly
documented, and when I finally worked it out, I could see that the
documentaion was correct, but ambiguous.

Once installed with the vmware video driver loaded, the system ran ok.

As a comparison, I was asked to install W95 onto an ageing P150 the same
weekend. This I did, and I have to say that both the install and the
running speed of a P150 made my VMWare install look like crap.

About this time the security advisory for RedHat 2.2.14 kernel came out
and I upgraded to 2.2.16 as a result, breaking the VMWare modules, which
would not compile for the new kernel. Instead I was informed by the
helpful compile process that I should upgrade or downgrade the compiler
because it had bugs that prevented vmware from compiling the modules.

It struck me as strange that I could compile the kernel, but a few k's of
source from VMWare would fail.

After waiting for the non-responsive tech support for 3 weeks, I decided
that I was getting the best support I was ever going to get from VMWare -
none. It is a testament to the strength of open-source that there is far
better support in linux for programs that are not sold than this product.
Especially when the license cost for a business user is more than the cost
of the guest OS I was trying to use. In fact, I decided to trash VMWare
and load Windows on an old P150 and save myself the hassle.

To this day I have had zero response from the VMWare organisation, and I
regard posting to a newsgroup for commercial product support as a slap in
the face. Why do some commercial software companies think it is okay to
charge for beta software?

No, I wouldn't bother with it for games from a speed point of view.
Dual-boot will deliver native performance with none of these hassles.

In case you haven't guessed, I am not impressed with VMWare! The program
shows a lot of promise, but I regard it as beta software, and certainly
not something I would pay for. VMWare's lack of response to a potential
customer has delivered them the expected result - no sale.

&gt; have any of you perchance used VMware on linux for a windows (9x)

&gt; 
&gt; any comments on stability or comparisons to free emulators like WINE? 
&gt; 
&gt; VMware seems to be well regarded in some circles and hardly mentioned
&gt; (in the
&gt; context of emulators) in others. perhaps its because the price looks a
&gt; little steep (though US$99 for non corporate use is at least possible)
&gt; or a dual boot turns out to be easier?
