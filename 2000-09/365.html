&gt; I know OpenBSD might be very good from a security standpoint, but I
&gt; think the mark as been missed here.  Security is a process, not a
&gt; product.  You can't buy security.

This is correct.

&gt; Even after the most thorough code
&gt; walkthrough and testing you _cannot_ be assured that a product is secure
&gt; if it's more complicated than 'hello world'.

This too, is correct.

But! (not really), at some point you do have to start relying on trust
somewhere (I certainly don't have the time to audit most of the code I
use (let alone the talent), or the compiler that produces it, or the
processor that runs it, yet flaws have been exploited at every one of
these levels).  Having a reasonably known starting point is an aid to
this.  For instance, I have very little faith in putting a NT box
directly onto the Internet without some form of packet filtering
between it and the Wild Wooly 'Net (and until Windows 2000, neither
did Microsoft, apparently).

&gt; Security is about closing
&gt; all the known holes, installing auditing tools, and regularly checking
&gt; logs.  There's no short cut.

Also agreed, and never denied.  This is just standard operating practice.

&gt; All IMHO.  No offence intended.

Well, I'm in complete agreement with you, so none taken.  :-)
