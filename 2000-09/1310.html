I was about to mention that you mustn't have a legal copy .. but it
looks like VanDyke (and US crypto regulations) are now allowing
Australians to download this. I guess it's been nearly a year since I
checked :)
 
&gt; The boss is asking about getting all the screens (yes I know
&gt; you can just unplug them) off the server desk and
&gt; having one physical set of everything for when you do work local.

You can get cheap switchboxes to allow 4 systems to share a
monitor/keyboard/mouse for around $60, then you get to spend $120 on
cables to suit. By some freakish coincidence, the people who distribute
such boxes are the same people who distribute cables, and they require
male-male instead of a more sane extension cable, so you can't utilise
stuff you already have.

They're ok if you need to use a local console very occasionally, but for
a more professional setup, there are digital pushbutton switches.
There's a 4-port one on mimp.com.au for $410. The digital ones are easy
to use, and usually allow a keyboard combination to change between hosts
as well as the ability to chain multiple switchboxes to share the one
screen (this is really cool when you have 12 systems or more on one
screen).

The other neat thing about the digital boxes is that some of them
provide a fake mouse/keyboard presence so that booting machines don't
complain. Some of the manual switchboxes don't work very well with some
mouse drivers.
