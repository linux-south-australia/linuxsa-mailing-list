Linux distributions aren't secure out of the box. New security issues are 
discovered all the time. RedHat will generally fix these issues in all 
their supported releases, currently 5.2, 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2. They will create 
an updated package and put it on their updates site generally within 1 or 2 
weeks. This is mirrored at <A HREF="ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/redhat/updates.">ftp://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/redhat/updates.</A> 
Applying the updates that relate to your installation is very important for 
security. In your case, there are updates that correct the bugs that were 
exploited in ipop2d and in cron and if you had applied the updates you 
would probably not have been compromised.

I use a tool called updateme to notify me when new packages are available. 
This can be obtained from <A HREF="http://www.uga.edu/ucns/wsg/linux/updateme/">http://www.uga.edu/ucns/wsg/linux/updateme/</A>, or 
you can get my modified version from 
<A HREF="http://www.marbury.sa.edu.au/pub/updateme">http://www.marbury.sa.edu.au/pub/updateme</A>, which among other things fixes a 
security issue with temporary files. I then run the following command from 
cron:

/usr/local/bin/updateme --list --site mirror.aarnet.edu.au --updatedir 
/pub/redhat/updates/6.2/i386
/usr/local/bin/updateme --list --site mirror.aarnet.edu.au --updatedir 
/pub/redhat/updates/6.2/noarch

The result is that I get an e-mail if there are any updates available for 
any RedHat RPMs on the computer. You can then use updateme without the 
--list option to install the updates or do it any other way you like.

Does anyone know of a tool like this to tell me what updates to apply to a 
Windows box? That would make it so much easier working out which updates 
from Microsoft to install.

If you only do two things about security then do the following. Firstly, 
set up a firewall that denies everything except for what you need to let 
in. Secondly, make sure you install the relevant updates that are 
available. There are also many other things you can do to improve security, 
but IMHO these are the most important and will keep most people out of trouble.

Cheers,

Martin.
