I had a similar problem to this. It seemed that I needed to *excplicitly*
tell pppd not to use chap. I think it's -chap or nochap or something.

* Problem is with Austarnet (my current ISP).
* I think I solved the problem tho, I changed authentication type
* from PAP to
* CHAP & it now seems to be working ok.
* It should be PAP, but if CHAP works, I'm not complaining.
* Just had to borrow someone else's DNS server as Austarnet must have a
* transparent connection or something, they don't give you any DNS addresses
* to use.  So I'm using Camtech's DNS server :-)
* Interestingly enough, if my old Camtech connection is set to PAP
* authentication, the same problem occurs!
