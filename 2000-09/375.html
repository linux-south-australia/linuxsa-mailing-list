&gt;&gt; Richard, have you had a look at the new firewall stuff in 2.4 ? I hear
&gt;&gt; that it is changing (yet again), and was wondering if it is any easier
&gt;&gt; than the current setup which I find mind-numbing at best.
&gt;
&gt;It's possible - even probable - that a recoded ipchains will be
&gt;available under 2.4. So I'm not altogether sure that we're going to be
&gt;able to avoid the "mind-numbing" ipchains syntax in the near future.
&gt;Nonetheless the new features supported by 2.4 will be a welcome addition
&gt;to our security toolkit.

An ipchains interface is going to be available. But there will be more
features that make netfilter very interesting. Sigh, so many interesting
things to do, so little time.

&gt;&gt; I use gfcc to check my firewall which is put in place with pmfirewall.pl,
&gt;&gt; and which seems to work ok, but I have trouble verifying the firewall
&gt;&gt; rules are doing what I want just by looking at them.
&gt;
&gt;ipchains rules have a hideous tendency to look like spaghetti code,
&gt;nonetheless they aren't that difficult to decode. One way to decode the
&gt;rules is to NOT look at the rules themselves, and execute the following:
&gt;
&gt;* start the computer
&gt;* run the rules/firewall
&gt;* run ipchains -L &gt; log
&gt;* less log
&gt;
&gt;Personally I find this way a lot more understandable.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Probably, I need to spend more time on it, but not understanding the 3
&gt;&gt; firewall classes of input forward and output is probably the core of my
&gt;&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt;If you don't understand input, forward and output then it is a problem
&gt;:-P

You also need to know something about TCP/IP and the way things really work
to understand how to use tools like IPchains and IPfilter, etc. 

You could use a commercial tool, like Firewall-1 or Gauntlet, but if you do
not understand the underlying technology, you better be prepared to mount a
law suite if someone breaks in.

&gt;DL
&gt;-- 
&gt;Just show me how to love you!
&gt;Io non to lascio piu
&gt;Gabbiano di scogliera
&gt;Io sto una favola e tu?
