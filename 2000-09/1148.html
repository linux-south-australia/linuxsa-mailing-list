Hi List,

This is a big dummy-spit, delete now if you aren't in the mood.

Thanks for the hints re KDE app files going missing on a Manduck 7.1
system. The answer for anyone who finds themselves in a similar
situation is, as recommended on this list, to look at the 'menu' package
and see what it does.

First some whinge:
	menu is designed to make multi-window-manager systems easier to manage
on Debian systems
	menu keeps a repository of installed package config files in
/usr/lib/menu
	package maintainers are expected to know this, and to make their
packages add entries to this file area when their package is installed
(needless to say some package maintainers don't do this, e.g.
applixware)
	sys admins are expected to know this and learn and keep this area
updated for packages they choose to install, should the packages not do
this automagically
	if this is not done your menu system is periodically 'fixed' for the
sys admin with no obvious logging of the system changes made. (in
reality this means screwing the system by deleting/un-updating changes
made by the sys-admin)
	this menu management software is installed by default with manduck 7.1
'typical' installs

Of all the clueless bloatware I have had to dig through since going to
'package managed' systems, this is the most dumb. To uninstall this
package from my system it will take 22 'dependent' packages with it,
including XFree86-server, XFree86-fonts, XFree86-S3, KDE-themes,
kdebase, and other non-essential stuff.

My dear old maiden aunt!!!! This is driving me back to slackware. I
can't believe the dumbness of this situation!!!!!! Oh the humanity!!!!
Oh the headfsck!!!! Oh the non-obvious clever slipping in of this
insidious little bit of file-waste.

Why am I so upset? I don't run a Debian system. I don't use more then
one window management system. In four-plus years of running Linux I have
never before even heard of menu-update. If given the choice I would have
chosen not to install it. I lost several hours prior to asking on this
list for help, trying to discover the mechanism that was fscking with my
file system. I still haven't found where menu-update is called, it's not
in /etc/rc.d/anything... and it seems to me to be yet another
Microsoft-inspired piece of control-abrogation that the world would be
better off without.

OK, now that I have got that off my chest, thanks again for pointing me
in the right direction. While I think of an elegant way around the
removal of the wart^H^H^H^H package, I will create a script called
menu-update that simply logs the call to itself in a logfile, and see if
I can't find what is calling it.

Bruce
