Hi,

&gt; 
&gt; How does it handle a database of installed packages, does it exist ? What
&gt; about versioned dependecies ?

For each package installed, there is a plain text file (with the same name
as that of hte package) in /var/log/packages.  Within this file, the
package name, the compressed pkg size, the uncompressed pkg size, the
pkg location, and a list of all the installed files are included.  The 
single-run install scripts are kept in /var/log/scripts.  Any packages
that you remove (using removepkg, or pkgtool) have their package log and
script kept in /var/log/removed_packages and /var/log/removed_scripts   
respectively.

Dependancies are expected to be maintained by the person installing the
packages.  If a certain package requires a newer version of library or
such, it will specify the name of the package that the said lib is
included within, and it is your responsibility to install that as well, in
keeping with maintaining a clean system.  Since there is no 'dependancy
checking' as such, it is also easy to install a pkg without regard for its
dependancies, if that is required.  Since Slackware packages are simply
gzipped tarballs, they are portable, meaning you can extract them and   
try using the binaries on any system (alternatively, you could use the
explodepkg tool provided with a slackware box).

I have heard that future versions of Slackware will include dependancy
checking with its pkg tools.  However, I don't know any details, or how it
will be implemented.

If anyone here does have a Slackware box, and is after a wide range of
packages, www.linuxmafia.org is the place to go.

Cheers,
