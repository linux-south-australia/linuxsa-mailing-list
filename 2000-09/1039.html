You shouldn't ever have to put it anywhere. The problem you report is due
to something else. Your ISP could change their name to blurgleblot and it
would keep working.

&gt; ie. I am with OneNet so I put in the Primary
&gt; 203.17.224.11 and 203.17.224.12 in secondary. But
&gt; there is no where to put the address one.net.au. So
&gt; when I log on I can access adresses via IP numbers but
&gt; not names.

This problem indicates that the nameservers aren't being used, which might
be because they aren't being written to resolv.conf. More likely it will
be because the nameservers are incorrect, in which case you would get an
error when running nslookup after connecting, like this:

*** Can't find server name for address x.y.z.a: No response from server
*** Default servers are not available      

I suggest you try setting "dynamic dns" in pppconfig. If pppconfig doesn't
let you do this then you have an old version (pppconfig --help should say
version 2.0). Dynamic dns sets the usepeerdns switch in pppd.

If this doesn't work (or you have an old version of pppconfig) and you are
sure the IP addresses of the nameservers are correct then manually add the
IP address of the first one to /etc/resolv.conf after you connect 
like this:

     nameserver 1.2.3.4

then test by typing 'nslookup www.one.net.au' and a few other addresses,
going further afield when you know that much is working.

If the problem was an outdated version of pppconfig (or a pppd that
can't do usepeerdns) then after fixing your resolv.conf do

    apt-get install pppconfig

which will upgrade pppconfig and everything that depends on it, such as
pppd. However I doubt that this is the case unless you installed from a
pretty old Debian CD set, in which case you should be looking to upgrade
everything (one way to do this is put your computer on a fast network
connection that you do not pay the bandwidth bill for and type
'apt-get dist-upgrade', answer the question and then find something else
to do for half an hour or so :-)

You might have to set up /etc/apt/sources.list to point to a Debian
archive. I use:

deb <A HREF="http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian</A> unstable  main  contrib non-free
deb <A HREF="http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian-non-US">http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian-non-US</A> unstable/non-US main  contrib non-free
deb-src <A HREF="http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian</A> unstable main                               

&gt; Is there any other program I can use (although pon and
&gt; poff would be ideal if i can get them working.) Please
&gt; keep in mind though that I need CHAP authentication
&gt; not the more widely used PAP. 

pppconfig handles CHAP, and the underlying ppp has handled CHAP for a long
time.

&gt; I used to use KPPP
&gt; before I became a Debian Fanatic and lost KDE.

Debian packages for KDE have been around for yonks. And since Qt went GPL
KDE has been in the standard Debian package archive. Try 

    apt-get install kdebase

when you have an hour or two of download time to spare.

&gt; PS. QT as a programming API is quite solid, if only it
&gt; didn't cost over $2000 for non linux ports *8(

If by non-linux you mean 'Microsoft Windows Only' then this is correct.
The Qt Free Edition should work on anything that runs X, including OS/2.

As I understand it the $2000+ is a one-off fee per developer, and you can
do anything you like with any of the binaries and source that you produce.
Incidentally I've heard that KDE will compile and run under Windows (or it
did before the 2.0 development effort, presumably that will come back
again.) But yes, if you don't have $2000 to spare then you can't produce
Windows binaries. Perhaps that's a good thing and they should raise the
price to $50 000 or so so that nobody does.

This shouldn't be taken to mean that I think GTK isn't worth using.
