&gt;To any remaining ipfwadm experts out there:
&gt;
&gt;On the subject of ipfwadm scripts, which probably
&gt;only people over 40 would remember now,
&gt;I've been modifying my firewall on a redhat 5.2 machine
&gt;(not the one that was hacked), and I've come up against
&gt;what I know is a tricky area - FTP data connections.
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone know of a link to info on how to this in
&gt;a really safe way?
&gt;I've scoured linux-specific sites for this info - they all
&gt;just give details on ipchains.
&gt;I've also dug around with google, with the same sort of
&gt;luck. The best info I found so far was on a Russian site.
&gt;(And no, I don't want to wipe the disk and install a more
&gt;up to date OS.)
&gt;
&gt;The problem is that I've got a default-deny firewall script now,
&gt;following instructions from the illuminati, and that's big trouble
&gt;for FTP. If I let FTP through, then pretty much anything goes.
&gt;I know this is well-known problem, and Paul Russell's tutorial
&gt;on this touched on the problem briefly about a year ago.
&gt;But I can't find the tute notes.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt;---------------------------------------------------------
&gt;PS.  I think it's unfortunate that some people take the attitude
&gt;that "if you get hacked, you're lazy or an idiot", without
&gt;checking out the facts. I won't explain the full context
&gt;in my case. But do remember that when _you_ get hacked, people
&gt;will call you an idiot or lazy too, and tell you lots of
&gt;things that you know already. The ability to understand things
&gt;from other people's point of view is a virtue!
&gt;
&gt;---------------------------------------------------------
&gt;PPS. I found the full attack scripts finally.
&gt;To get into POP2, they used:
&gt;
&gt;<A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/SDI-pop2.c">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/SDI-pop2.c</A>
&gt;
&gt;Then they fetched this file (a copy of it) over FTP:
&gt;
&gt;<A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/rootcron.sh">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/rootcron.sh</A>
&gt;
&gt;Then they just did a few clumsy things while trying to announce
&gt;their exploits, and then I noticed the packet warnings from
&gt;my relatively liberal firewall saying that something was
&gt;going on, and I blocked them.
&gt;
&gt;----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;PPPS. I had previously heard that POP and IMAP were security
&gt;holes, and I had been blocking ports 110 and 143 for at least
&gt;a year. However, I didn't know that 109 was also a problem.
&gt;I only spend an average of 10-20 hours a week on computer security.
&gt;And sometimes I concentrate fully on real work.
&gt;
&gt;But the vulnerable machine in question was first installed with
&gt;slackware, which was pretty horrible - it didn't have the software for
&gt;my ethernet card (about mid-1996 era, this is), and a heap of
&gt;other things didn't work either. But after a year or two,
&gt;I got it connected up to a sparc station, connected from time
&gt;to time by 9600 bit/sec modem to a rather safe organisation
&gt;hidden behind a rather conservative firewall.
&gt;So security was not my concern, even when I put redhat 4.x
&gt;of various versions on it. I was just worried that so little
&gt;worked - and the free support from RedHat wouldn't work,
&gt;because I couldnt' even get my customer registration
&gt;through the organisation's firewall.
&gt;The firewall stopped me from getting any useful help with the thing.
&gt;
&gt;Later, I installed redhat 5.2 over the top of an earlier version,
&gt;and my main concerns were still _functionality_.
&gt;It was only 20 months ago that I connected my then 3 machines
&gt;to the net, and I firewalled out anything that looked nasty,
&gt;not really knowing how to "turn off services".
&gt;At that time, Redhat didn't ask you which services you wanted,
&gt;as far as I know.
&gt;And I really don't have the time to "upgrade" my OSs on 7 machines
&gt;now every 6 months. Besides, the "upgrades" usually take the
&gt;old configurations unaltered.
&gt;
&gt;etc. etc. etc. etc.
