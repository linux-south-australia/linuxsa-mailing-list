Everyone has a comfort zone, analyze this list for example and you will see who has
strengths in what area and so forth. The network people are good at networks.
programmers with programs etc. etc.  Ask them to exchange their roles and learn
something new from scratch and just watch the fireworks.  Example how would David L
fit into hospitality industry? How well would Mathew G fit in with working on
gardens and landscaping?.  How would you like to be forced into it?

The point is, teachers are given cirriculum they do NOT choose it.  It does not fit
all of their interests and many if not all of them have little or no computer
experience.

Anyways change and one's ability to "manage" change is just as difficult for
teachers as it is for anyone.  Maybe even more so given the current political
climate.  Low staffing numbers, cut budgets, a government that has NO figgin idea
about what its trying to achieve create a low moral base to start with.  If
teachers had resources and were provided with appropriate training it may not be as
bad as you imaging.

Other points:
Technological velocity = the speed at which technology changes I remember getting
my 300baud modem connected to the net (shudder) way before Mosaic was born and that
was not long ago.

Most IT people I know are ONLY IT and they barely keep up, in fact some of them
can't. Or will we say they won't keep up?

Teachers do a great deal more than work in one area. (and that does not count
managing parents of kids sheesh)

&gt; Also, teachers (they aren't the only ones, mind you) refuse to accept
&gt; any change. They teach, this means they don't have to learn (or so I've
&gt; been told). Show them KDE and a lot would immediately tell you that they
&gt; can't use it. Just because it's a change (for better or worse). I think
&gt; showing them the shell is not the best idea (although, in the
&gt; certificate III and IV course, they learn the DOS command line....).

Information overload is  formally recognized in the UK as a major stress factor and
accounts for lost time, poor performance, inability to manage change and prioritize
actions.

&gt;
&gt; The students (if interested) would eat this stuff for breakfast, but as
&gt; you say, confidence on the teacher's part is where the problem lies.

Teachers would eat this lunch if interested ;-)
Interest would not be dissuaded by non confident teachers or other wise.  I suggest
looking at the household for inspiration rather than a school.
In Japan schools are peer group supported, students help students, we still operate
the teacher centered method.

&gt; If it's to do with change, they aren't interested. If you give them the
&gt; opportunity to learn it and they decline, sometimes you need to drop
&gt; them in it.

(sigh) Someone get rose pruners  I need to cut his broad brush ;-)
