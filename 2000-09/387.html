Hi list,

I have a problem with my old Linux PC which has variously run Slackware
96, RH5.0, Turbolinux, Manduck and even sometimes Winblows. This is an
old clunker that has had many lives, and currently has a Rhino12 MB and
a Cyrix 6x86 brain.

It has 64Mb RAM supplied as 2x16Mb EDO sims and 1x32Mb DRAM. It has been
happy to believe it has 64Mb RAM for some time, but recently has decided
it only has 48. By swapping in and out the various sims I believe it is
now of the impression that the 32 DRAM is 16. On boot it reports
something like
bank 0 NONE
bank 1 SYNC DRAM
bank 2 EDO RAM.

I know very little about hardware, chips are for eating IMHO. Does
anyone know if it is possible for a 32MB DRAM to half-die (I'd have
thought it would be dead or not dead), and is it possible that the bank
1 SYNC DRAM msg above points to some interleaving or somesuch that is
effectively halving the available physical RAM on this sim?

TIA

as always, at least half confused,

Bruce
