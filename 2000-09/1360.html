&gt; Please understand I am not knocking SAMBA as a utility. It does an
&gt; excelent job, and has fixed many a problem for me on a number of
&gt; occasions, but I don't know of free utilities that can achieve any of a
&gt; number of facilities that Novell supplyes, without an extensive set of
&gt; scriting on both the Linux and Desktop PC side.

I can't really address the Novell Netware comparison part intelligently
(the latest Novell has passed me by, I'm afraid I'm not so interested as I
might once have been :-)

But I think it is important to observe that Samba's philosophy is to
expose the underlying operating system. So, for example, when Samba is
running on Netware (and there have been at least two ports done that I can
remember, both of them now dead) all the functionality of the underlying
filesystem is exposed. Files served by Samba running on VMS can have the
extremely rich ACL and file type semantics of VMS used to the full.
Similarly, on Unix, whatever the underlying filesystem can do will be
reflected in the files Samba exposes. This doesn't mean that Windows
Explorer suddenly sprouts a "VMS Permissions" window, just that Samba will
comply with whatever access rights the logged-on user has on that
filesystem. Usually it is a matter of working out read/write/create/delete
rights, which are all access primatives provided by all the subsystems
involved. Samba doesn't care if the filesystem checks a username out by a
dozen different means before granting write access.

So it is a matter of looking at what filesystems you are thinking
about. Take Reiserfs, for example, which has ACL support, or the Linux
Trustee project. Samba's job is to map whatever is provided by these
filesystems via the OS onto what the Windows clients are expecting. (What
is the best FreeBSD option for a fully-featured filesystem?)

No doubt you are right in that there is a nice graphical tool for managing
Netware permissions that probably has no equivalent under free
Unix. However I doubt that there is any functionality on the filesystem
side which is unique to Novell. 

Does that make sense?
