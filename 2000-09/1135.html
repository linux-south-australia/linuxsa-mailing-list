&gt;&gt;&gt; talk here at LinuxSA of doing a summer installfest... comments?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of promotion, organisation, etc... I'd suggest that we
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt to work together much closer than we did this time -- and
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing as we will have the one date, this will force us to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; so...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hmm.  I'm not sure this is a good idea.  If we work more closely
&gt;&gt; together, there will be some people who would potentially be able to
&gt;&gt; attend in multiple locations, for example national computer press
&gt;&gt; people.  Obviously this would only work if they were at different
&gt;&gt; times.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; From the dealings with (some) of the Press we had very few were interested
&gt; in following a `roving' event -- due credit to LinuxWorld that they stuck
&gt; it out. Having a big `national day' seem to attrack their interest more
&gt; for some reason.
&gt;
&gt; Realistically the press are only going to cover the important places in
&gt; Australia. I'm sure everyone on the list realises that that means Sydney.
&gt;
&gt; With probably Melbourne in support. :-)

We can tell where you come from :-)  But recall that, in terms of
numbers, Adelaide outshone the East Coast.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, if we can make some sort of projection or target for numbers
&gt;&gt;&gt; of people, PCs, and installs, it could generate interest...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, how do you estimate it?
&gt;
&gt; It all depends on the advertising. LinuxSA and AUUG spent big and got
&gt; a big turn out (although from the numbers is appears that Sydney has
&gt; the same number of installs done).

Hmm.  I don't have access to the numbers, but it was my impression
that the whole thing was done on a shoestring budget here.  Anyway,
that's not really the issue: we're prepared to spend more, and
hopefully get the support of some big companies in the process.  I
also really don't want to get involved in a "mine's bigger than yours"
discussion.

&gt; It is hard to sustain interest in things which span a large amount
&gt; of time.  Otherwise the Olympics would be over 6 months instead of
&gt; compressed into however many days it is.

There aren't many people who would have to keep their interest up for
any length of time.  Imagine we could get Linus to come to the
installfest(s) (a very real possibility, BTW).  How would you like it
if he only went to see his mates in Canberra because all the
installfests were on the same day?

&gt; I actually don't think having AUUG involve itself with every LUG is
&gt; very useful. To me it sounds like more work for everyone
&gt; involved. What would, IMO, be far my beneficial is if AUUG and LA
&gt; got together and convinced a *big* corporation (for example,
&gt; Telstra) to get behind a national installfest.

This is certainly a thing that we should follow up with.  I'll talk to
our business manager.

&gt; Such a large company might have locations in each participating city
&gt; that could be used for the installfests. Plus they would have the
&gt; marketing resources to make sure it got noticed in the media.

Agreed.  Both very good ideas.

&gt;
&gt; Greg, Anand, please don't fight over who had the biggest Installfest
&gt; or who should be allowed to play what role next year.

I don't think we're fighting.  My original comments were very much
tongue in cheek.  If that didn't come across, my apologies.

&gt;&gt; Australia. I'm sure everyone on the list realises that that means Sydney.

&gt;
&gt; It is true however that some journalists were not keen to cover an
&gt; event where something similar, but in another city, had been covered
&gt; a few weeks before (hence we lost some potential coverage in Sydney
&gt; due to previous coverage of events in Canberra and Adelaide).

What evidence do you have to back that?  I suppose that not many of
the national press would want to follow the event round the country
(further damaging the point of my example), but local press wouldn't
care if a similar event had happened in a different city.

&gt;   Greg -- AUUG also supported an Installfest in Brisbane, IIRC.

Hmm.  I didn't know that.  We currently don't have any committee
members in Queensland.  Anyway, I'd rather look forward than back: how
can we make it better next year?

One thing that might get the attention of the press is the ``revolt
against Microsoft'' aspect that got so much publicity for the
Microsoft Refund Day.  In this connection, I can't resist reminding
you that this event stemmed from the activities of a LinuxSA
member--see <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com.au/geoffrey/toshiba.html">http://www.netcraft.com.au/geoffrey/toshiba.html</A> :-)
