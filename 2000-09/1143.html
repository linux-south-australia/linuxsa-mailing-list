I would be taking the drive back if it is still under warranty. I have had
lots of problems with TR5's lately and Seagate have either replaced or
repaired the drive each time.

Also remember that the tapes should have a life time warranty. I have also
had some tapes replaced under warranty.

&gt;
&gt; Hi!
&gt;
&gt; As you know I've been having rather amazing problems with an STT-20000N
&gt; Travan drive. The [amanda] list has said that they use these drives
&gt; quite successfully, so we dutifully did the following:
&gt;
&gt; * checked the termination settings
&gt;  - they were correct
&gt;
&gt; * changed computers
&gt;  - this improved things a little bit
&gt;
&gt; * added a "dumb" terminating device
&gt;  - decided that the tapes terminators weren't behaving themselves, so I
&gt; took a device that I *knew* could terminate and made it the end device
&gt;
&gt; * changed SCSI cards
&gt;
&gt; One of the people I work with somehow discovered that the tape drive and
&gt; tapes overheat (yes, overheat) when being written to constantly. The
&gt; tapes appear to become so hot they simply cease to function (or the
&gt; drive ceases to function or both). When we let things cool down, it goes
&gt; back to normal.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone noticed this in this particular tape drive, or for that
&gt; matter any other tape drive?
&gt;
&gt; AMANDA is able to stream to tape constantly once our backups start to
&gt; occur. I guess, a rather kludgy solution, would be to set AMANDA such
&gt; that the tape didn't stream constantly (eg, limit the bandwidth to
&gt; something ridiculously low etc etc)....
&gt;
&gt; Any comments?
&gt;
