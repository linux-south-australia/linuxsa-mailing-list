Hi All

I think this is a Richard Sharpe type Question.

I need to now if there are any problems currently between Linux 2.2.16+
using NFS and Samba 2.0.5+.

In pedicular,  I have an MS Access (The only data-file or database this
windows program will use is its own file) type file which I need to share
between multiple sites. Access like file do not have a database server
instead each client changes small chunks of the file, each client takes turn
doing this (via some type of locking system)

I now there are some security problem with the use of NFS which I'm going to
need to work around, probable with an encrypted tunnel and only bind NFS to
the tunnel. (somehow)

The next question is to do with NFS & diald

I think these sites will need to use something faster than a modem link, but
I do not think they will go for permanent ISDN and ADL is not available in
all places yet.

My question is does the NFS server send traffic to the NFS client only in
response to a question or is it a two way connection which needs to be up
all the time.
When would these packets be sent/received ?
    1. when another system changes a file.
    2. A keep awake messages
    etc.

I now this is a big question, but I do not have the equipment to setup a
test bed.


Thanks if advance

    Mike O'Connor
