G'Day,
    Gee that is strange that this apparently doesn't work as
I have been doing it for almost 18 months now. The only
problem with having a 56K Dial-in and a 56K Modem connection
is the same problem you would have with a 56K connection and
several users, and that is if say 4 people want to surf at
exactly the same time, then the data transfer rate would
drop to approx 1/4 speed or about 14.4K (it would actually
be alot less than this) for each user dependent on alot of
things. I have had no problems with my dial-in so far and
have happily used it while someone was logged on. So really
the problem is what are they going to do when logged on? If
they are going to use you as an ISP, then they will run into
the usual problems. If they are going to use your Network
for other things, then they should get data transfer at
about 56K no problems. If you want to use ISDN by all means,
but Modem is cheaper.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: 56k dial in server


&gt;I have been asked to setup a dial in server which I would
like to use Linux
&gt;for, which I don't think will be a problem, but would like
the uses to be
&gt;able to connect at 56k.
&gt;What is involved in setting a modems to allow a 56k
connection as I believe
&gt;a normal modem ever day modem won't be any good for the
this job. Someone
&gt;also told me that 56k connections will only work with ISDN
lines at the
&gt;server end, is this the case?
