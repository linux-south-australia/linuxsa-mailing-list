Hey all :)

I've asked this before; however I really *need* an answer (and the =
question is slightly different).
I've setup a linux box acting as a samba box, basicallly validates =
passwords, has a logon script (batch file) for the win98 workstations to =
map drives, etc...

I have configured two groups, Group A and Group B.
Essentially:
each user has H: mapped to their home directory (/home/GROUP/USERNAME)

However, Group B will need to be able to browse, view (and preferably =
not edit, but it doesnt matter that much) all of Group A's home folders.

I have mapped S: to /home/GroupA (with valid users being groupb, in =
smb.conf) however, they can see the folders in this drive, but cannot =
enter the folders (with an access denied error).  This is obviously =
because they are not the owner.

I need to somehow make GroupB "own" GroupA's files.. so GroupB can view =
them.  GroupA ONLY has read/write access to their home folder/drive, =
that's it.  GroupB will need read/write access to their home folder =
[this is already configured] but ALSO read (again, preferably not write, =
but if this the only option) access to GroupA's files.

The users cannot telnet in / gain shell access, this has been disabled.  =
It is purely for samba.

Thankyou
Ryan

P.S. There are several reasons why I'm not using a NT box, which has =
been decided some time ago.  So this is not an option :)
