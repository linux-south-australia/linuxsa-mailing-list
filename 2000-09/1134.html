&gt;&gt;&gt; In terms of promotion, organisation, etc... I'd suggest that we
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempt to work together much closer than we did this time -- and
&gt;&gt;&gt; seeing as we will have the one date, this will force us to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; so...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hmm.  I'm not sure this is a good idea.  If we work more closely
&gt;&gt; together, there will be some people who would potentially be able to
&gt;&gt; attend in multiple locations, for example national computer press
&gt;&gt; people.  Obviously this would only work if they were at different
&gt;&gt; times.
&gt;
&gt; true, but not as significant as you may suspect... the people "in demand"
&gt; will be prominent Open source / Linux developers, company reps, and media.
&gt; Developers are distributed anyway, so each group would get it's fair share
&gt; of developers. I'm sure we could spread out company reps and sponsorship
&gt; dollars somehow. And Media -- increase the publicity, and we'll get more
&gt; media... :P

OK, maybe I chose too few examples.  Yes, I'm very much thinking of
getting some Open Source developers to come in as well.  I haven't
mentioned any names, because I wanted to have more commitment first.

&gt; You are sort of right here though, but I think that the potential for
&gt; publicity that we could get from having a Nation-wide event would outweigh
&gt; the problems (there's only one way to find out, anyway :)

I suppose we could discuss that point.  I don't know that a single
"uprising" all over the country on the same day would be that
significant, though I do recall that it worked pretty well for the
Microsoft refund day.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, if we can make some sort of projection or target for numbers
&gt;&gt;&gt; of people, PCs, and installs, it could generate interest...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Well, how do you estimate it?
&gt;
&gt; LinuxSA got 350 people last time. I estimate we'd get 400 this
&gt; time. Do same around australia, come up with 1,500, make it a
&gt; target... easy :)

Look at that as a proportion of the population of the cities, and we
should make more like 3,000. in the capital cities alone.

&gt;&gt; With my AUUG hat on, what can AUUG do to help?  At our last committee
&gt;&gt; meeting we agreed that we would very much like to help in this kind of
&gt;&gt; event, and I think we're in a position to do so, especially since
&gt;&gt; we're a nation wide organization.  Questions to you:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1.  Were you happy with the AUUG involvement in the last Installfest?
&gt;
&gt; I think we were -- although it did seem like an individual effort from AUUG
&gt; members, rather than an AUUG effort :)

Agreed.  But it was at pretty short notice.  AUUG's not as young and
agile as it used to be.  With a bit more time I think we can get a
more concerted effort together.

&gt;&gt; 2.  Is there something more we can do?
&gt;
&gt; If AUUG were to get behind the national event, it would (I imagine) do both
&gt; AUUG and the Linux groups a world of good. Financial backing would be good,
&gt; as would pulling strings with media contacts... The insurance was
&gt; excellent...

Good.  I can't make a committee decision, but I'd expect we could pick
up that sort of thing.

&gt;&gt; 3.  Are there things which we could have done better, or just kept out
&gt;&gt;    of altogether?
&gt;
&gt; Hmm... Nothing I can think of, but if we go ahead with a national event this
&gt; year, we'll need to be more organised, and earlier... it could help if AUUG
&gt; joing with Linux Australia to make it happen in a co-ordinated manner...
&gt;
&gt;&gt; One possibility would be to declare a nationwide installfest as a
&gt;&gt; cooperation between AUUG and each individual Linux user group.  
&gt;
&gt; and Linux Australia.

Hmm, you can tell that I'm not a Linux person, can't you?  This is the
first I've heard of Linux Australia.  But I see I've copied them
anyway, so I'm sure we'll get some feedback from that direction.
