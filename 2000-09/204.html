		have any of you perchance used VMware on linux for a windows
(9x)
		virtual machine? in particular, is performance for gaming
noticably
		worse than native windows (/me dons flameproof suit)?

Have used vmware for win95, win98, & win2k (and some other linux distros),
works great, however if you want to play games, stick with a dual boot.  As
yet vmware has no directx support, it has sound support tho.  As far as I
can tell Solitaire runs about the same under Vmware as "native" windoze ;-)
The big plus from my point of view with Vmware is that I can have a Windoze
client fully interacting with the Linux host PC through Vmware's internal
network.  This means I don't actually need a second PC to test any network
setup on the Linux server.

		any comments on stability or comparisons to free emulators
like WINE? 

Vmware is very stable, at least as stable as the OS you choose to install in
it.  I havent had much success with WINE personally so couldn't tell you.

		VMware seems to be well regarded in some circles and hardly
mentioned
		(in the
		context of emulators) in others. perhaps its because the
price looks a
		little steep (though US$99 for non corporate use is at least
possible)
		or a dual boot turns out to be easier?

Have a look at Win4Lin as well.  www.trelos.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.trelos.com&gt">http://www.trelos.com&gt</A>; 
I bought the retail version & am very impressed, tho the networking lacks a
little in comparison to vmware.  I'm eagerly awaiting win4Lin2 which is in
beta testing mode at present.
If you have a PC with the grunt (P2, 128mb RAM preferably, with the RAM
being most important), try Vmware, if you have something less than that,
Win4Lin is a good option, if you want to play games, dual boot is your only
option (for windoze games that is)
