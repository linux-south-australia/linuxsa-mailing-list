Hi,

&gt; But I think it is important to observe that Samba's philosophy is to
&gt; expose the underlying operating system. So, for example, when Samba is
&gt; running on Netware (and there have been at least two ports done that I can
&gt; remember, both of them now dead) all the functionality of the underlying
&gt; filesystem is exposed. Files served by Samba running on VMS can have the
&gt; extremely rich ACL and file type semantics of VMS used to the full.
&gt; Similarly, on Unix, whatever the underlying filesystem can do will be
&gt; reflected in the files Samba exposes. This doesn't mean that Windows
&gt; Explorer suddenly sprouts a "VMS Permissions" window, just that Samba will
&gt; comply with whatever access rights the logged-on user has on that
&gt; filesystem. Usually it is a matter of working out read/write/create/delete
&gt; rights, which are all access primatives provided by all the subsystems
&gt; involved. Samba doesn't care if the filesystem checks a username out by a
&gt; dozen different means before granting write access.

Sure, we are on a linux list, so I was talking linux. Also we were talking
replacing netware with SAMBA, I was pointing out considerations of doing
this change. I've been tempted to see the SAMBA under Netware, but I don't
have any non-mission critical netware servers to try this on.

&gt; So it is a matter of looking at what filesystems you are thinking
&gt; about. Take Reiserfs, for example, which has ACL support, or the Linux
&gt; Trustee project. Samba's job is to map whatever is provided by these
&gt; filesystems via the OS onto what the Windows clients are expecting. (What
&gt; is the best FreeBSD option for a fully-featured filesystem?)
&gt; 
&gt; No doubt you are right in that there is a nice graphical tool for managing
&gt; Netware permissions that probably has no equivalent under free
&gt; Unix. However I doubt that there is any functionality on the filesystem
&gt; side which is unique to Novell. 

The ZEN intergration I think is the more powerful feature of netware these
days. With ZEN I can cpontrol who logs on where, when, and sees what
applications. I can deliver applications to the Desktop, in whole or
part. I can repair applications every time I start them.

Whilst noe of these things are new things, or unique, many of them are new
to a wintel platform. Even if Netware isn't the only producer of this
technology, I don't know of a GPLd substitute.

My dream at the moment is to have the boxes under my control all
intergrated with  SAMBA, NDS (or whatever it is called today) for platform
of chice (Netware, Windos, Linux, other Unixes), common username via LDAP,
common file system. Infact it is mostly there. SAMBA is almost there with
the NT Domain system. That should intergrate with NDS for NT. They have
NDS for Linux, and a variety of NFS or Netware file system mounters. I
think by this time next year, ysadmining might be a bit easier.

&gt; Does that make sense?

Yup :)

cya
