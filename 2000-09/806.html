&gt; 
&gt; This is a work in progress.  Currently Mozilla is going through a semi-feature
&gt; freeze and improving reliability/speed being their focus.  They want a 1.0
&gt; release soon.  I'm not sure the component commonality is going to happen any
&gt; time soon, as they are different projects, ie Mozilla isn't a subproject of
&gt; GNOME.

I see this as the biggest problem. Mozilla and Star Office are very large
bits of functionality, and they weren't designed with either Gnome or
Gnome's Bonobo components architecture in mind. What's more until recently
both of them had as a strategic focus to be as at-home as possible in
environments where neither were present. The foregoing two sentences are
completely at odds with constructing a completely integrated, modular
environment. When we're talking about millions of lines of code, nothing
in the way of a full rewrite/overhaul happens in less than years.

I ask myself "If the same effort were to be spent on a from-scratch
system, who'd get there first?". Then I look at the fact that pretty much
every single component of Gnome/Mozilla/Star already exists in KDE and is
already part of a very clear architecture. Some bits mightn't be as
advanced as Mozilla/Star, but when they are will it hang together better?
I don't know of course. But I don't think the Gnome and Friends project is
necessarily better placed than KDE despite the donation of millions of
lines of code.

&gt; &gt; The other thing I'm watching with interest is Star Office/KOffice. Anyone
&gt; &gt; else got comments on how they are progressing relative to each other?
&gt; 
&gt; I have to start by saying that I haven't used KOffice in anger, but have seen
&gt; their screenshots/magazine reviews etc, and on the other side, I've been
&gt; watching the openoffice mailing list. 

I have been looking at KO. What I see is a suite which is a beautiful
example of reuse. It makes extensive use also of other parts of KDE, and
the sharing protocol too. I've been comparing this to Abiword and
Gnumeric with Gnome.

&gt; What I've heard about KOffice was that it's quite good if you can get it
&gt; installed - which was quite a problem if you weren't following the bleeding edge
&gt; KDE releases.

?? "apt-get install koffice" did it all in one hit for me. The rpms are
even more up to date at the moment.

&gt; So far there isn't much KDE interest in the openoffice list, and that's probably
&gt; because the Open Office crowd have already announced gtk as the widget set to be
&gt; used.  So it seems KOffice and OpenOffice will be competitors, although KOffice
&gt; should benefit from lots of good stuff including import/export filters.  

I think this is the most valuable part of SO, followed by the PIM
application.
