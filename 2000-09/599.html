&gt;   1. Have fun.  We should actually launch some of the attacks we may
&gt;      have been on the receiving end of.

yes indeedy... perhaps we could attempt to get hold of three or four boxes
we can set up for the express purpose of hacking into... boxes with nothing
important on them...

&gt;   2. Should this be Linux specific, or inlude all forms of UNIX, or 
&gt;      include Windows NT?

IMHO, focus on Linux (We are LinuxSA, after all), but invite some NT freaks
along to watch and see as we break into their machines with ease...
(hopefully)... ie a practical demonstration, with clear terms of engagement
(standard install vs standard install, small customisation vs small
customisation, and expert config vs expoert config -- also need to be agreed
on what services are going to be provided, etc, and whether use of
non-standard software is ok... maybe Open Source vs NT Proprietry woudl be a
good challenge)

&gt;   3. We should have sessions for the newbies as well as those who are
&gt;      perhaps more experienced.

indeed -- a presentation and discussion of a checklist, and some tools for
checking the checklist things (portscanners, etc) and resources for learning
more, and detailed discussion on more advanced htings...

&gt;   4. It should be an opportunity for hands-on as well as for being
&gt;      presented to.

I would suggest having 3 components: 
1. "bring your computer and we'll help you go through the checklist, and
attempt to solve any other problems" 
2. "sit, listen, and ask questions while we tell you about hte checklist and
other things"
3. "try to crack/secure these demo boxes" -- Linux (RH, Debian, Bastille,
etc?), xBSD, NT, Solaris?

for 1, you'd be expecting that people who bring boxes know a little, and we
should make sure that before we start, befreo they even come, they know all
relevant detials about what they need the machine to be capable of -- it's
no use blocking off everything but ssh if they really need to have port blah
open for their dooble program...

&gt;   5. Should we have a cracking challenge?

yah yah yah ...

we need it so that the machines to be cracked are easily and quickly
returned ot their original state... maybe a CD image or soemthing.. Richard
-- would it be viable to hire machines, as IIT does? We could set up a CDROM
with a disk image of each system, and just restore them within 10 minutes
that way... :)
