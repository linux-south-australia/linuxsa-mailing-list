If you're ever wondering what those funny numbers after man pages [eg
man crontab(5)] this is their meaning according to the "Man-Pages
mini-howto]:

Section The human readable name
   1    User commands that may be started by everyone.
   2    System calls, that is, functions provided by the kernel.
   3    Subroutines, that is, library functions.
   4    Devices, that is, special files in the /dev directory.
   5    File format descriptions, e.g. /etc/passwd.
   6    Games, self-explanatory.
   7    Miscellaneous, e.g. macro packages, conventions.
   8    System administration tools that only root can execute.
   9    Another (Linux specific) place for kernel routine documentation.
   n    New documentation, that may be moved to a more appropriate
section.
   o    Old documentation, that may be kept for a grace period.
   l    Local documentation referring to this particular system.

You'll find the pages (normally) in /usr/man under various directories.
You access a _particular_ page like this:

* man 1 tar

You don't need the "1" for the tar command because man will display the
first page it comes across...and tar's man page is the first page it
finds. However, you may need the "1" or other "character" if there is
more than one man page for a particular name. This can occur with system
calls that have the same name as library calls for example. In this
case:

* man 2 foobar
* man 3 foobar

Refer to _different_ man pages.
