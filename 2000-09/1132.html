(&lt;snips&gt; everywhere)

&gt;SLUG, which I well, spent *nothing* on advertising and we still managed
&gt;to get a large number of interested people. We wanted to spend money on
&gt;ads but organising ads (and paying for them) are time-consuming.

yes -- and here's one place where LA and AUUG helping together could be of
some use -- one ad copy, consistent advertising...


&gt;I think the two main reasons for Adelaide be so successful were:
&gt;
&gt;- large ad
&gt;- being first

and the enthusiasm of 400 or so list members who dragged friends etc along
:)

&gt;I actually don't think having AUUG involve itself with every 
&gt;LUG is very
&gt;useful. To me it sounds like more work for everyone involved. 
&gt;What would,
&gt;IMO, be far my beneficial is if AUUG and LA got together and 
&gt;convinced a
&gt;*big* corporation (for example, Telstra) to get behind a national 
&gt;installfest.

This is one place where AUUG would ahve more pull than LA... Perhaps what we
need from AUUG is help with media and national co-ordination, perhaps
insurance as well, and help from their individual members on a per-LUG
basis...

&gt;Such a large company might have locations in each 
&gt;participating city that
&gt;could be used for the installfests. Plus they would have the marketing
&gt;resources to make sure it got noticed in the media.

true...
