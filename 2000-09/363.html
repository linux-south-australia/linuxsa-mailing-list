As an old "zombie" who has been using the email and www system for some
time now with various shades of ms windows , recently moved to RH Linux
6.1 , I am absolutley facinated by the reported unwanted
interconnections over 'phone lines between computers connected to them
enabling  'bandits" to read contents and produce effects like DOS .
At first introduction to Linux I used the Gnome RP3 to connect to my old
ISP and have been happy enough , until recently , to leave it that way
.  The other day I built a firewall for reasons I do not fully
understand as yet and have been trying to sort out what is going on by
going through the 'man' pages on subjects like ipchains , telnet , intd
& host. All of these seem to me to be starting in the middle  of the
networking operation and  I was hoping someone could point me to a
general overview reference ? Being a HAM , I am reasonably familiar with
the packet protocol being used to effect the transfers.
thanks
Bob Crockart
