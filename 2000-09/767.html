It depends if you want to pursue self study or commercial training.
It also depends if computing is your career.

For self study I'd buy two old Pentium PCs and use them to
configure all the items listed in the Linux Professional
Institute exam objectives.  Subscribe to Linux Journal,
subscribe to the linux-kernel e-mail list.  Go and spend
$500 on the best books in the fields that interest you, we
have a list of recommended books at:

  <A HREF="http://www.aarnet.edu.au/network/resources/">http://www.aarnet.edu.au/network/resources/</A>

For professional training, I'd look to the courses run by
Richard Sharpe (who is a South Australian).  The Red Hat
courses are aimed more at resellers than at the average
system administrator.

The following applies if you intend to become a computing
professional:

 - Also try to get on the invitation list for various vendors.
   Ignoring the marketing, their product launches and technology
   presenations can be surprisingly informative, although this
   differs widely between vendors.

 - Personally, I'm a strong beliver in structured self study as
   the best way to learn.  But it does take a lot more discipline
   than attending a training course.  It also depends where in your
   career you are: formal training in more effective at the start
   of your working life.  Once you've heard the ISO Networking
   Layer Model described for the tenth time, self-study starts to
   have a strong appeal.

 - Get a uni qualification in computing.

 - You should allow at least $5,000 per year for study, although
   it is reasonable to expect your employer to pick up some of this.
