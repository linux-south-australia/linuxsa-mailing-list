Hello!

I've just reviewed Robyn Manning's firewall, which she has built from
the Freesco Firewall (<A HREF="http://www.freesco.org/">http://www.freesco.org/</A>). I concur with its web
pages and can say that:

* it's easy to setup
* it runs with a very small foot print
* it appears to be secure

Whilst I did not, nor will I have the resources to do a full security
audit of Robyn's system, it does appear to be relatively secure and
block services that you do not want to advertise to the world. Here's
how it works:

* it defaults, essentially, to a "DENY EVERYTHING" policy
* through a series of screens. you answer a number of questions about
what you want to ALLOW...commentary is included with some of the
questions
* after you have answered the questions you are presented with an
overview, "advanced" screen where you can "fine tune" what your question
and answer session answered

This is all done in text. You can administer it by telnet (icck), web
browser (icck) or at the actual console. It understands DHCP, but it
does appear to be based on an older kernel that uses 2.0.38 - I say
"appear" because ipfwadm looks like it's on Robyn's disk.

I would recomment this particular product for someone who is concerned
with security, who is on a dialup account but who doesn't particularly
want to delve into the intricacies of the ipchains syntax immediately.
Whilst a business or larger home network may choose to use a full
distribution for this important service - simply because you then have
the utmost control of your firewall and router - you will buy yourself a
certain amount of protection using this product.

I suspect that a home user on a relatively non-permanent connection
would be able to deter crackers, who would more likely turn to either
easier or more interesting targets...
