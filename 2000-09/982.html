&gt; Legal Drug of Choice?
&gt; 
&gt; Having pulled a few all nighters recently I wondering what the Guru's
&gt; consume to keep going.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm your basic hot coffee & refined sugar type. Yiros & deep fried mars bars
&gt; go down well too.
&gt; Clang! Oh that was just the sound of my arteries hardening. :-)

Coffee is your best liquid source of caffeine, probably in price as well
as concentration. Sugar may not be your best friend, as scarfing down
cup after cup of refined sugar may trigger an insulin overcompensation
leading to low blood sugar and lethargy. Going for a while without food
can also lead to low blood sugar, so eat some complex carbs like a bagel
or a sandwich every 2-3 hours.

What you want to do is inhibit your metabolism's "brakes" and/or
stimulate the accelerators. Natural ways to increases your metabolism
are eating/digesting, heating concentrating and moving. A quick walk
outside in the cold night air with a full belly and scarfing down coffee
will really wake you up fast. Computer games also seem to help me.

Keep the room brightly lit and the temperature low.

As for drugs, other than caffeine, you have herbal stuff (expensive,
usually much weaker than the refined chemicals) like Epihydra, Gourana
and some bark from some tree (can't remember much more). There are other
drugs like epihydrene (which I think has become illegal in Australia
because it is used in the production of amphetamines, though you could
always order it off the internet if you don't mind risking that customs
will take it). Don't stack drugs unless you know what you are doing.

Amphetamines are used by other professions to do all nighters all the
time. In order not to induce public panic I won't reveal which ones, I
will just strongly reccomend you take up private health cover.
