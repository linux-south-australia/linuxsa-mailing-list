This is Linuxsa, and any any one who takes offence easily will probably not stay
on this list,
especially if they have still not attended their first meeting and undertaken the
initiation. ;-)

I agree with what you say, I did not mean to give the impression openBSD was
enough full stop.

My comments were intended to point out that no other Distro to my knowledge is
installed with security defaults ON,
most need LOTS of work to bolt down, tidy up etc. etc.  So yes process control is
ongoing, changable, and a darn pain in the port.

Aplogies if I missed the point, I can waffle good, I'm Scottish ahh emm err Born
Again Aussie to correct that ;-)

&gt; &gt; Reports have it they spent 18 months auditing the code, even going so far as
&gt; &gt; to make changes to code that "may" possibly be exploited even though no
&gt; &gt; exploit had been found or heard of.
&gt; &gt; openBSD is secure by default after the install.
&gt;
&gt; I know OpenBSD might be very good from a security standpoint, but I
&gt; think the mark as been missed here.  Security is a process, not a
&gt; product.  You can't buy security.  Even after the most thorough code
&gt; walkthrough and testing you _cannot_ be assured that a product is secure
&gt; if it's more complicated than 'hello world'.  Security is about closing
&gt; all the known holes, installing auditing tools, and regularly checking
&gt; logs.  There's no short cut.  If someone wants to break into your XYZ
&gt; computer they will, you can't stop them, you just need to make the next
&gt; IP address looks more attractive a target than you.
&gt;
&gt; All IMHO.  No offence intended.
