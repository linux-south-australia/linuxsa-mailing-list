&gt;&gt; could I suggest that this type of discussion take place on 
&gt;the linux-aus
&gt;&gt; list?
&gt;
&gt;I nominate Richard as LinuxSA representative on linux-aus 
&gt;list.  Assuming
&gt;that most of us aren't subscribed to the list, I think it 
&gt;makes sense for
&gt;one person who is to represent the views and ideas of this 
&gt;list, and also
&gt;to keep us informed of events on that list.

hmmm.... I'm happy to do that on occasion, but I'd appreciate not getting
into a man-in-the-middle situation... anyone who has any opinions to express
should express them themselves as far as possible...

&gt;&gt; I've just had a chat with Andrew Tridgell, and he's prepared

&gt;&gt; as many installfests as possible.  I'm sure we'll find other 
&gt;people of
&gt;&gt; his calibre.  Who wants to miss out by having the things on 
&gt;the same day
&gt;&gt; as somebody else?
&gt;
&gt;I don't think we need to.  I'd like to see the talks 
&gt;nationally broadcast,
&gt;and using linux where possible for the enabling technology.  

very interesting idea -- if it's doable, we should try -- suggest it on
linux-aus (I will tomorrow if you don't :)

&gt;We could try
&gt;to spread the people around the country, so that everybody 
&gt;gets a chance
&gt;to fondle someone famous.  I currently lean towards liking a 
&gt;national day.
&gt;It underscores that geography is not relevant.  It might help 
&gt;if you think
&gt;of this as one installfest held in half a dozen different rooms.

yes...
