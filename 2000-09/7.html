&gt; &gt; Hello, all:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Using postfix, is there any way I can see what Emails are currently being
&gt; &gt; recieved? I sometimes get a completely clogged link from a large Email
&gt; &gt; attachment, and I can't tell who it's to/from, or how big it is.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know how to check this? Thanks,
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't used postfix, but ethereal/tethereal would do it.

Ethereal wouldn't do the job, not realistically. You'd have to be
capturing continually and then search through large logs when you noticed
the link filling up.

I don't know postfix very well at all (I do know the PCRE library it uses
though, good stuff!) but what you need to do is find out how to examine
the spool area. Every good MTA lets you see this, and I've never heard of
one that didn't put the headers in an easily-seen spot as soon as it
started to receive a message no matter how big it is. As I recall the
postcat tool lets you do this, but you'll have to experiment to find out
which files to run it on.
