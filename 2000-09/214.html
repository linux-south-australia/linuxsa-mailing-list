I have one machine with an es1371, similar to the es1370. I believe that
it is a little like the winmodem. The Windows drivers for this card offer
a configuration for a midi sound bank, which is loaded into conventional
menory, unlike the GUS or SB AWE which had it done in hardware (RAM) or
like my Roland Sound Canvis daughter board for a standard SB16 (ROM).

The Roland works flawlessly under Linux, given that it just uses the
MPU MIDI port.

The trick with the sound bank/fonts is that they must be loaded into
memory and the drive must support that. I do know that MIDI instrument
(Piano) works with the 1371.

Timidity is an alternative, it also uses GUS sound banks but the quality
is not as good as it could be. I have not looked into this areas too much.

The KDE MIDI player (well one of them) supports playing MIDI via Timidity.

I think that OSS may offer the option to use a sound bank.

Dale.
