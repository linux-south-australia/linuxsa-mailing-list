Richard et al:

&gt; &gt;ipchains -A input -p tcp -s any/0 -d $MYIP 25 -j DENY -l
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm, this is the worst way to do things. It means that anything you forget
&gt; to stop could be used against you.

Yes, I know that this is not the most secure way to do things.
Nonetheless I take the view that:

* I am a home user
* I am on a slow 56K ppp-link
* I don't keep CIA, ASIO or FBI documents
* Any really important documents that are "secret" either don't get
stored on computer or they're put under GPG

I do actually have a script lying around which works a firewall with a
default DENY set of rules (the point is I c a n set one up, just that I
have n o t set one up). I also take the following point of view:

* I know what I do run
* Services you don't run, can't be used against you
 - (try hacking a web server that isn't running :-P)

I tend to take a middle line between the triple-des in the same room
scenario. Besides, my other rules log enough to tell me when something
strange is happening...as in all things in life, it's a trade off
between one thing and another. The primary reason why I run on a default
ACCEPT policy is because I haven't been bothered enough to work out what
I do run, what ports they need to have open and so forth...when I see a
point for  m e  to run such a firewall on my personal ppp link then I'll
set one up.

[incidentally, I own that last statement and I think we've had a long
enough discussion about various security matters]
