This is great Guys,
This newsgroup rocks with the Really Knowledgeable people who subscribe
to it.
I've had a similar problem on an OS/2 network. I knew it was some sort
of DNS issue with using a caching nameserver, but had never found the
time to solve it.

Most of the solutions mentioned here are best-of-breed, & have been
ported to Windoze & OS/2, so I can use with confidence on non-Linux
environments.

I'd hate to admit-it, but I've learnt more about the nuts & bolts of IP
from this newsgroup, than from any IBM or Microsoft docs, even though
none of my systems are Linux!

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help people, it wasn't as hard as I thought. (or is that
&gt; light at the end of the tunnel the 11pm express?)
&gt; 
&gt; For anyone who is interested:
&gt; 
&gt; The cacheing nameserver is only that - it needs some more config files for
&gt; the local network in /var/named with associated changes to the
&gt; /etc/named/conf, which can be generated from /etc/named.boot after you
&gt; change it to reflect your network.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't forget to set PEERDNS=no in
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0 otherwise the /etc/resolv.conf
&gt; will be overwritten with your isp's nameserver.
&gt; 
&gt; The DNS-HOWTO, and a couple of google searches were of great assistance.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again,
&gt; 
&gt; Michael
&gt;
