sorry, but I have been watching this thread with interest and just have to
make a few comments.

&gt;The attack actually happened 2 months ago, but I only just
&gt;discovered it because my KDE on my main workstation locked up,
Don't people go through their logs, even if everything appears to be
alright.  So many potential problems can be fixed by simply having a quick
wander through your logs at least once a week.  You are also more likely to
notice an attack of some kind and knock them on the head.  Another moral to
the story perhaps?

&gt;Now, if I don't want to disconnect from the net, I've got to go back
&gt;and take the advice I've been receiving for so many years,
&gt;and use a default-deny policy for security.
why did u change or/and y not listening?

&gt;Once again, it's lack of time.
&gt;No one's paying me $100 an hour to do this.
&gt;I'm _losing_ $100 per hour by doing this security work.
I certainly wouldn't say that your losing $100 per hour, look at it as an
investment in knowledge for yourself and possibly others, that certainly
can't be a waste of time.
I wish I got $100 per hour for my computing work :(

&gt;1. I connect to the net 24 hours a day, while there
&gt;are about 60 port scans every day of all my IP addresses.
&gt;Just connecting to the net is a __big__ risk factor.
of course, but 60 scans a day is a pretty large amount, The ISP I work for
would be unlucky to get that many every couple of days  I would be thinking
that quite a few ppl know about your system and are trying to exploit it,
My system is on the net 24/7 and in the last 2 weeks I've only had 13
portscans of my system. You definately would want to look into that.


&gt;&gt; But, if you go looking, you will find security exploits in both, and
&gt;&gt; you will see protective measures way faster in the open source systems.
&gt;Also, this occured to me.  You will far more often find Unix boxes
&gt;protecting NT boxes than vice versa.
Probably because a patch can be applied easily and quickly on open source
software instead of having to wait for the owners of the closed source
software to write patches (weeks, possibly even months or even the next OS)

&gt;On a related subject, maybe linuxSA could organise
&gt;a security-fest. E.g. a weekend, or just one day on a
&gt;week-end, of seminars on linux security.
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

&gt;Those who are paid to teach this stuff will not want
&gt;to work for free. But for the rest of us, putting together
Umm why not? Most of them would not mind imparting a bit of knowledge to
other ppl to help them understand the benefits, reasons and concerns of
security.
But then again hold a few notes in front of someones face and they will do
_almost_ anything :))

Just my 0.05 c (you try and find a 2c peice :))
cya
