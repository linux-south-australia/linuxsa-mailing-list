Hi John,

You're confusing Mbps and MBps.  An Alpha has a backplane throughput
of 8Gbps (64 bits at 133Mhz).

The real throughput-killer with PCs as routers are the interface cards --
because they cannot copy to another card down the bus they have to vector
through memory.  Even on the best OS, this will halve throughput.

"Real" routers such as the Cisco 7500 series still use PCI busses (as the
chips are available and the design life cycle takes less time), the interface
cards are just smarter.  The high-end cards come with their own CPUs and
hardware-referenced forwarding tables.  It's only with the multi-gigabit
routers that the bus is replaced by a switch-bar for inter-interface
communication.  Even then communication with the main CPU is done
through a PCI bus.

It's not at all clear that switch-bar based systems are the way to go --
the complexity of the electronics severely limits the slot count and this
leads to multiple chassis in networking cores, thus there are huge
configuration costs.  Some manufacturers are going to the other extreme --
developing routers with 10,000 interfaces to make network cores trivial
to configure, and thus much more reliable.

Intel's IX chips will essentially turn a PC into a router in the
same class as the Cisco 7500 z-bus series.

The real reason not to use PCs as routers is that routing hardware
and software is built for routing.  For example, the routers don't
contain hard disks.  As an example of the software, consider finding
an ethernet fault, would you prefer the output of "show interfaces" or
"ifconfig"?
