No one will need to switch to IPv6.  This is actually the problem.
The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is so well engineered that people
cannot see the point in upgrading.

What will happen is that some devices will only come with IPv6
stacks.  Those devices will then need to be routed through
an IPv6 edge router.  The next hop from that edge router can
be an IPv6 or IPv4 router or host.  IPv4 will not be suitable
for those machines as IPv4 machines can only realistically
hold one address, which makes wireless cell roaming problematical.

I don't understand your Windows 3000 remark.  Windows NT has had
optional support for IPv6 for some time.  With Windows 2000 had
optional IPv6 support from its launch date.

The Linux distributors have been dragging the chain on getting
IPv6 distributed as a standard feature.  This should happen once
Linux 2.4 hits consumer distributions.

Really dragging the chain are the router manufacturers.  Cisco
should have IPv6 in consumer ISP code by the end of the year.
You can then expect a year for this version to be widely
deployed.
