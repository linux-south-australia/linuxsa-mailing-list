I've used VMWare on a Celeron 400mz with 128mb ram and an 8mb
integrated Vanta video.  The performance was comparable to maybe a
200-266mz pentium with 32-48mb ram (sometimes less), and did take a
bit of tweaking to get it going well.  

For gaming I would say that unless you're talking about older games
(like maybe Quake2) It's not a good idea.  Also a big problem with
games is that VMWare does not access your hardware directly, but
rather virtually simulates them.  So for instance if you are using a
32mb TNT2 video card the virtual machine does not access it directly
but rather uses the VMWare Video adaptor, kinda a software video
card.  This "softcard" then sends the output to X to be displayed,
even in full screen mode.  

So for anything multimedia heavy I would not advise using VMWare at
all.  It's best suited for Office apps and so forth (I primarily use
it to get Outlook and Access97)

Also keep in mind that although the VMWare performance is quite
admirable, you are essentially running two complete Operating systems
on the one CPU, so performance for both OS's is going to suffer. 
Same goes for RAM.  VMWare creates a protected RAM space for your
Virtual system that is then unusable by the host operating system
(and as such this RAM cannot be dynamically adjusted) so you must be
careful not to starve the host of RAM.  Because of this it is not
advisable to run VMWare with less than 64mb of RAM (I think they
advise 96-128 minimum).

As for wine, IF wine supports all the library calls that the program
requires, it will run the software completely natively with no
additional overhead, so the app should run at native speed. 
Unfortunately, advanced multimedia and in particular DirectX support
is quite difficult to provide (particularly with the API's being
difficult to acquire) and is really quite unstable so games and
multimedia is currently unrealistic at this time with wine.

So in conclusion I would say that we are all still stuck with Windows
in the gaming world, so dual booting is the way at the mo'.

Cheers
Damien

(P.S. if you do go the VMWare way, use hardware profiles under
windows to keep your VMWare device drivers separate from your regular
drivers)

&gt; 
&gt; any comments on stability or comparisons to free emulators like
&gt; WINE? 
&gt; 
&gt; VMware seems to be well regarded in some circles and hardly
&gt; mentioned
&gt; (in the
&gt; context of emulators) in others. perhaps its because the price
&gt; looks a
&gt; little steep (though US$99 for non corporate use is at least
&gt; possible)
&gt; or a dual boot turns out to be easier?
