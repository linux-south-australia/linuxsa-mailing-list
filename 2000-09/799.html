&gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing I want is for distros to boot into single user

&gt; &gt; What if a service hasn't been exploitable in that time, and not
&gt; &gt; required an update?  I understand that sleep(1) hasn't had a root
&gt; &gt; exploit in ages.  :-)

&gt; Daryl -- Glen was referring to the _latest_ rpm/deb. ie if there ahve been
&gt; _no_ rpms (debs) installed for 6 months, then don't boot... You wouldn't
&gt; need to replace _EVERY_ rpm within six months...

You'd need to be able to turn it off though. I mean, whilst it would
help prevent most people from leaving systems wide open, what happens if
you have a box that is running very little (like a firewall). You "know"
that this machine has no security problems, because it isn't running any
services and you are quite sure that the kernel running on it has no
problems. Updating this machine could compromise the security for your
entire network. It would take a simple slip by a kernel developer to
introduce some kind of remote buffer overflow and end up in your system.
OK, this would only be a problem for a maximum of six months, but that's
six months too long.

I know this is rarely going to be the case, but that's what makes linux
so great, it works in more situations than just about anything else.
