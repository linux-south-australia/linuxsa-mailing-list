&gt; MS Solutions aren't really that much simpler. They are at least as
&gt; insecure as modern Linux boxes. Furthermore, they tend to obscure,
&gt; obfuscate and hide their security loop holes. Just to give you an idea,
&gt; if you are running a default Windows installation of 9X or even NT, I
&gt; can probably tell you what your log in name is. Furthermore, if you're
&gt; on a network and you have a guest account and share I can probably log
&gt; into that share from my Linux system....
&gt; 
&gt; And Windows users don't even know that you are doing it!
&gt; 

All the same, a change of default login name is much easier to impliment
than a whole ipfwadm/ipchains/tcp wrappers/tripwire etc. type scenario.

The real issue is one of open system versus closed system I think.
M$ Win9x/NT as relatively closed systems are much easier to configure
for security as a general rule in my observations.

Open systems (Unices etc.), whilst requiring far more attention and a
greater degree of time and effort to secure and keep secure, by their
nature also offer greater flexibility.  Bottom line?  Which suits the
desired purposes better!  There is no singular answer to this.

&gt; 
&gt; You are being exposed to the knowledge. It is yours to learn from. It is
&gt; your choice to run away from it as well.
&gt; 
'A' knowledge, not 'the' knowledge.  One thing about this list is the
amazing way varied and different ideas and paradigms are used by the
many users on it.

&gt; &gt; Surely there is a NICE way of securing what you have to avoid these
&gt; &gt; exploits without resorting to archaic console commands. Or without the need
&gt; &gt; for introducing a firewall box etc.

Yup!  Leave it switched off!!  It's an ongoing fight from which you can
never rest.
