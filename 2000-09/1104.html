 &gt; Quick Question:
 &gt; What are the legalities behind using these cards to link offices that are 
 &gt; not next to each other (eg, 4 or 5km apart)? Do you need a licence?

Yes.  You need a carrier license if you want to run a link over more than
500m, or over any distance where the A and B ends of the link are not part
of each others' immediate circle.

This means you can link two offices of the same company together if they're
less than 500 m apart;  you can link an employee to an office if they're
less than 500 m apart too;  But you can't link offices from two separate
companies together over any distance without a carrier licence, nor can
you link an employee to their office if the distance is greater than 500m.

 &gt; Are they in a frequency band that is licence free?

You're confusing two different licenses.  There is a class license on the
use of the frequency band utilized by 2.4 GHz microwave spread-spectrum 
equipment.  That's the license which permits you to use them at all.
It has power output limitations on it, but that's about all.

Separate to that is the carrier license which is required if you wish
to send any voice or data telecommunications service at all, whether it's
on wire, fibre or microwave, over distances greater than 500m.

 &gt;Is it legal or illegal?

Illegal.

ISPs using spread-spectrum stuff like Lucent Orinocco or Cisco Aironet
to connect their customers are on *VERY* thin legal ice.  The ACA has 
started cracking down on this stuff, and the ACCC is apparently beginning
action against a wholesaler of such equipment who has been advertising 
the equipment as a way to "become your own carrier".
