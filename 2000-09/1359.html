Hi,

&gt; Currently I am looking at replacing a client's NetWare 5 Network with
&gt; SAMBA.
&gt; 
&gt; A colleague pointed out to me that SAMBA is limited to the permission
&gt; system of the file system that it resides on (Under Linux that's
&gt; basically user/group)
&gt; 
&gt; The network has about 200 PC's on the network servicing 1100 Users. Our
&gt; client is a school, so keeping things nice and secure is a big issue.
&gt; There are plenty of students that like trying to hack the network and
&gt; break software etc.
&gt; 
&gt; This colleague of mine suggested that to achieve the same sort of
&gt; permission set that we have currently under Novell under SAMBA, it would
&gt; require a lot of work, effort etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What have your experiences been with SAMBA and these sorts of issues? I
&gt; am very keen to see Novell out the door, as it would make other problems
&gt; such as backup etc a lot easier to solve (Not to mention cheaper ;)

I'm sure there are mitigating circumstances and cost factors here, but
this is one case where I think SMABA is not going to be as afective as
Novell. The reason is that Novell's inheritance structures are way in
advance of Unix's. If you want to giv a user read permission on an object
(the most common being a file or a folder) in Unix, the entire path from
Root needs to be atleast executable, that goes for alot of changing of
permissions if the file path is deep. In novell, the read permissions
simply need to be given to the object, and path is worked out
automatically.

Also, is read permission is given to a directory, then subdirectories are
automatically readable. This is by far the most usual situation. This
makes revoking and changing permissions exceptionally easy. For the number
of users you have, this will be a huge asset.

Also, with the latest version of the novell clients (freely downloadable
from the Novell site), comes a simple version of ZEN Works. This gives you
extensive control over desktop PCs, who can log in where, when, and what
applications the users have access to, all from the Novell
accounts. Particularly if you already have novell implemented there, you
are much better placed to keep it.

Please understand I am not knocking SAMBA as a utility. It does an
excelent job, and has fixed many a problem for me on a number of
occasions, but I don't know of free utilities that can achieve any of a
number of facilities that Novell supplyes, without an extensive set of
scriting on both the Linux and Desktop PC side.

cya
