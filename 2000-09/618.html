&gt; &gt; Hi Michael,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The winmodem in the Toshiba 4300 series is based on the Lucent Technologies
&gt; &gt; chipset. Fortunately they have distributed a binary only kernel module which
&gt; &gt; can be located at <A HREF="http://www.linmodems.org/">http://www.linmodems.org/</A> . I had no problems installing
&gt; &gt; from the distribution. It was compiled for RH 6.1 and reports unresolved
&gt; &gt; symbol errors on loading, but it still works very nicely.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Being a command-line person from way back, I use wvdial rather than
&gt; &gt; something like kppp or similar. A collegue of mine does use the RedHat
&gt; &gt; X-client dialer, also with great success.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Regards, Grant
&gt; 
&gt; Like I said, yes, winmodems _do_ work, but they add extra overhead to
&gt; your CPU that normal modems do not.  With a winmodem the digital signal
&gt; processing (DSP) part is done by your CPU instead of a dedicated CPU
&gt; with specific add-multiply machine-instructions.  It just means your
&gt; expensive Intel/AMD processor is doing the work that a $50 DSP chip
&gt; could be doing instead.  If if your CPU is modem stuff, it has less time
&gt; to do everything else.  Granted, your 800Mhz PIII in your laptop is
&gt; probably twiddling it's thumbs most of the time right now, but in 3
&gt; years time when Windows3000 or Linux2.8 comes out you'll be wanting
&gt; every once of CPU to stall off another upgrade/purchase.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes you can get them to work (if they're Lucent-based, which fortunately
&gt; most are) but you have a performance hit.  Not saying you shouldn't buy
&gt; one, but that it should be considered when you weigh up all the features
&gt; of your laptop prior to purchase.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, all IMHO.  'Caveat Emptor' and all that.
