Hello All..

I was wondering if someone could help me with a little question that I
have regarding VoIP..

What I would like to do is get a linux box, and use it as the VoIP
'server'. I would like to maintain the usage of handsets of some
description (Cisco make IP Handsets I think).

What I basically want to acheive is this:

 - Client picks up handset to make a call..
 - Client dials number on handset which is then dialed by the linux box,
using
   ISDN, Frame Relay or whatever is being used to make outgoing voice
calls.
 - Client talks away, with all the voice signals going through the linux
box

I've looked at asterisk (<A HREF="http://www.asteriskpbx.com">http://www.asteriskpbx.com</A>) and I am unsure if
it can
do what I am trying to do.

Is there anyone out there who has had success with a similar setup to
what I am trying to do? I know that Cisco sells products that handle
both ends (The handset and the 'Server' part) but was hoping that I
wouldn't have to sped $$$.

I would be really interested in hearing what you have to say and any
suggestions that you may have.

Thanks in advance,

Andrew Reid
