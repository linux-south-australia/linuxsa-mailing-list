There was a whole thread about MySQL vs PostGres on the liust a while
back. In summary:

PostGres
--------

For:
* fully GPL and Open Source
* supports transactions, commit and rollback
* supports inline functions [i.e. you can write "code" in the SQL
itself]
* supports a finer level of locking

Against:
* not yet optimised for speed
* documentation less polished than that for MySQL

General consensus was that if you wanted a fully functional, fully
relational RDBMS then you would choose PostGres.

MySQL
-----

For:
* simple and easy to install
* noticably faster in some applications than PostGres
* documentation appears to be more polished

Against:
* does not display number of features as PostGres
* current stable release not GPL
* table level locking could bring performance down
* no transaction support

The consensus was that MySQL is a good database system under certain
circumstances. Such circumstances would be when you needed a simple,
fast DBMS in a non-critical environment. And you wanted one without a
significant amount of baggage - it was similar to pointing out that a
Ferrari is relatively useless in the city because the speed limit is 60
km/h.

An addendum to the MySQL debate is:
* a l l  future releases will be under the GPL licence; checking the
site it looks like this may be retrospective
* transaction and subselect support will appear in the a stable release
entitle "MaxSQL"
* transaction support does exist in the current "unstable" release
 - the current "unstable" release is actually very stable if you avoid
the newest additions to the DBMS

Furthermore, according to the MySQL reference manual the transaction
support will be based on the well tested Berkeley Database format as
opposed to a self-concocted table format. It claims that this is more
efficient than PostGres' format.

Personal Summary
----------------

For personal reasons, I will stay with MySQL. I am teaching myself the
rudiments of setting up and using PostGres, there are a number of sites
(<A HREF="http://slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org</A> and <A HREF="http://freshmeat.net">http://freshmeat.net</A> and even
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com">http://www.yahoo.com</A>) who use MySQL who don't suffer from any of the
"drawbacks" that the pro-postgres. Interested people could go to

for themselves...
