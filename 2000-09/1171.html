Why did you ever leave?

&gt; can't believe the dumbness of this situation!!!!!! Oh the humanity!!!!
&gt; Oh the headfsck!!!! Oh the non-obvious clever slipping in of this
&gt; insidious little bit of file-waste.

I first installed Slackware 7.1 a little while ago, about 2 or 3 weeks
after it was released and I must say that it is one of the (if not,
THE) best distributions around.  One of the things I like best about it is
how it handles packages.  It does it sensibly.  They are very simple, just
gzipped tarballs that extract from the / directory (unless you specify
otherwise), and execute a single-run install script if necessary.  I find
this approach, although it could be considered 'utilitarian,' very quick,
easy and effective.  Slackware packages exist for one reason, to save
people from compiliing from source, and they serve this purpose extemely
well.  They don't ask for dependancies, that is your repeonsibility
(dependancies, if there are any would of course be stated in the README
file), and when you install or uninstall, they take only their own files,
warning you if any new files have been created in directories unique to
that package.  Simple but extremely effective.  You can even convert rpms
to Slack pkgs - great for getting those Mozilla includes without getting
the whole source tarball =)

Just another observation I have had - Slackware Does Things
Right. Without needless bloat.  Things work how they should.  An example,
whack a pcf font in /var/X11R6/lib/fonts/misc/, run mkfontdir and xset fp
rehash, and you can use the font.  It ain't so easy in Redhat.

Cheers,
