 &gt; That's all good value.
 &gt; But I'm not quite certain that you have the same picture of
 &gt; the scenario that I have.
    [ ... ]
 &gt; Scenario 1:
 &gt; I'm in Strasbourg with my laptop accessing my home web site over
 &gt; the client company's LAN and Internet access.
 &gt; I have some 4 machines which I want to access for various reasons.
 &gt; Once I'm "in" to one of my machines, I'm certain that I'm me.

That's fine -- So why did you say that one of the main advantages of
rsh and rlogin was that if someone broke through your firewall and
sniffed your network traffic, they wouldn't be able to see your password?

You can't have your cake and eat it too.

What I see from this message is that you're quite happy to sacrifice
virtually all of your security for a bit of convenience (i.e.: you don't
want to need to type a passphrase).  I don't have a problem with that;
It just seems to render a lot of the other security stuff you often talk
about quite pointless.

 &gt; &gt; No.  It is an attack which forges packets so that they appear to come
 &gt; &gt; from "trusted" IP addresses.
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is fine from attacker to victim.
 &gt; But the victim traditionally replies with the destination IP
 &gt; address equal to the source address of the client's packets.
 &gt; The attacker, in order to get those reply packets, must either
 &gt; be on the same LAN as me (e.g. a shared office with disreputable
 &gt; co-workers), or else be on the same LAN as the destination host
 &gt; (or some other less credible alternatives).

The attacker does not need to see the reply packets.  They will have
previously knocked-out the IP address listed in your .rhosts/hosts.equiv
by SYN-flooding it, so they can use its IP address as the source of the
attack without getting RST packets.

Also keep in mind that you originally brought this up in the context
of someone who had already broken into your firewall and who was sniffing
your packets, so even if there was a requirement to view the backchannel
that'd definitely be possible.

 &gt; The attacker must be pretty clever to trick my computers into sending 
 &gt; IP packets to an address which is _not_ written in the client
 &gt; IP packet source-IP field.

They don't need to do that.  

 &gt; &gt; The attack method is well known, and has been for many years.  There
 &gt; &gt; was a very long and drawn out thread on it started by Tsotumo
 &gt; &gt; Shimomura in comp.unix.security in 1996 or thereabouts;  It's also
 &gt; &gt; one of the reasons why so much effort has been invested into selecting
 &gt; &gt; difficult-to-guess seed sequence numbers in TCP implementations 
 &gt; &gt; since that time.
 &gt; 
 &gt; I remember overhearing some people discussing this kind of attack
 &gt; around about that time.
 &gt; I know that TCP uses (or used to use) the time of day to choose
 &gt; the initial sequence number, apparently as a way of avoiding the
 &gt; possibility of packets from different sessions to the same port
 &gt; getting confused - in case of link failure etc.

That's not actually why it does it at all, but I'm pleased you're 
vaguely familiar with the attack.

 &gt; I can see that an attacker, if able to guess the precise 32-bit
 &gt; sequence number, could maintain a credible sequence of packet
 &gt; _transmissions_ to the server host to maintain the communication.
 &gt; But they still could not receive the packets from the victim
 &gt; (server) host. Thus they could.....

They don't need to.  They need to forge a SYN packet to initiate the
connection to port 514;  Your server will send a SYN-ACK with an initial
sequence number in it, but if they've guessed the "next" initial sequence
number they don't need to read it (if they can read it the attack is 
simpler, but it's by no means mandatory to sniff your network).  Therefore,
the attacker can safely assume that the SYN-ACK has been transmitted, and
continue the attack without actually having seen it.

So, then they forge the ACK that matches the SYN-ACK, with the correct
sequence number.  If they've guessed correctly, they now have a connection.
They don't need to know whether they've guessed correctly, because
they can work that out by observing whether the rest of the attack is
successful, so they don't need to see any replies to this packet.

Then they forge a final packet which contains RSH authentication stuff
(essentially the username at their end - forged - and the username they're
trying to login as).  The server will see then use that info to check a
.rhosts file to see if the connection should be permitted;  If the 
usernames are right and the source IP address is right, you're in (and
we know they're right because they've been forged!)

The final part of that final packet contains the rsh equivalent of:

     echo + + &gt; $HOME/.rhosts

That'll be executed by the server;  Once that has been carried out, there
is no longer any need whatsoever to continue to forge packets, because 
any user on any host on the Internet is now permitted to login to that
account.

So - By forging three packets and guessing a sequence number (which isn't
hard, it's pseudo-random in a 32-bit keyspace) the attacker has broken 
in without needing to sniff a single packet.  If it sounds hard, don't 
worry becaus there are perl scripts which automate it;  The whole process
from initial SYN-probing to get the sequence numbers through to the arrival
of the first "#" prompt takes about ten seconds.

This stuff is old news.  Anyone who makes use of .rhosts files quite 
probably deserves what they get;  It's a scandal that rlogin and rsh
are still enabled by default in the vast majority of UNIX installations.

 &gt; This is really terrific. I've been using mail attachments for
 &gt; transfers over the net. This is going to change my life!
 &gt; The problem is that "scp" requires my passphrase, which is
 &gt; no good at all for makefile and script use.
 
The passphrase is optional.  If you're happy with the security of 
the client, you can generate a key pair which isn't passphrase 
protected.

 &gt; I.e. the passphrase is not required.
 &gt; So the "private" key _can_ be unencrypted!!
 
Yes, but you'd have to be very confident about your firewall to run it
like that (and your previous message indicated that you weren't necessarily
happy with your firewall, because you wanted to keep cleartext passwords
off your LAN).

 &gt; I must say that I can't see myself going to so much effort.
 &gt; I think that my recommendation to Robyn remains:
 &gt; If you have several machines which are safely behind a firewall,
 &gt; then all things considered, it's better to use .rhosts than
 &gt; to type passwords for every file copy and login.

I don't understand why you'd say that.  The vulnerabilities have been
known for about a decade;  They've been well-publicized for about half
that time.  The protocol is broken by design.

If you're making use of .rhosts files then most of the rest of your 
security efforts are probably a waste of time -- If an attacker breaks
a single machine on your network, *ALL* of the others will be compromised
in very short order.  It's not even like there's any doubt in the matter.

This is bad advice, Alan.  You're telling someone that it's fine to 
sacrifice all of their security (and it really is all of it - A single
.rhosts file can let someone break root!) for the convenience of having
to type a few less passwords.  It's ludicrous!

With ssh-agent you only need to type the passphrase once per session
anyway, so I don't really understand what massive gains there are to be
had in exchange for the complete and total abdication of security 
you're recommending that Robyn undertakes.

 &gt; And if "rcp" and "rlogin" are firewalled out, the above
 &gt; sequence-number-guessing attack won't work anyway.

So are you worried about passwords in the clear on the LAN or aren't you?
