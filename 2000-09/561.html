Matthew,

I realise that we are re-living history now, through the magic
of modern mailing-list software, but since the message of yours
has appeared again, this is an opportunity for me to make this
little comment.

Keeping up with all the latest bugs is not easy.
I just scanned through the last 24 hours of
Linux Today <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/">http://linuxtoday.com/</A> and found:

Bugs in SMB-related software in Conectiva and Debian:

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-12-004-04-SC
    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-12-003-04-SC-DB

A very serious looking bug related to fax software in RH 5.0 up to 6.2:

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-11-026-04-SC-RH

Security bug in Caldera xpdf:

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-11-025-04-SC-CD

A problem with PHP scripts being hacked through giving parameters
which affect internal variables:

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-11-014-04-SC

A new category of string bug:
``Security experts have discovered a fresh family of techniques that could use the
                 internationalisation features of operating systems to attack computer systems.''

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-11-013-04-SC

That's 6 security bug items to read.

There's also an article on how to secure a machine on PPP using
firewalling techniques etc. 

    <A HREF="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn">http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn</A>=2000-09-11-008-20-SC-DB

Now suppose I only have to apply one bug fix to 1 machine every day.
(I'll probably apply the fax-related bug on two machines.)

That's about 300 or so bug fixes per year.
At one hour each on average, that's about 300 hours per year.
How much is that in lost productivity?

This is why I say that it is not very reality-oriented to blame the
victim. 
I think that anyone who wants to connect their home computer
to the net 24 hours/day should think very carefully indeed about
just how much time they have to spare for this constant source
of amusement and drama.

Anyway....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
