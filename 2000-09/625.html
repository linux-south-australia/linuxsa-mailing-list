&gt; 1.      First the standard OpenSSH is for BSD.
&gt;         So I had to go fetch the portable version of SSH.

Hidden in plain sight on the opening page of www.openssh.com:

"Managing the distribution of OpenSSH is split into two teams. One team
 does strictly OpenBSD-based development, aiming to produce code that is
 as clean, simple, and secure as possible. The other team takes the clean
 version and makes it portable, so that it will run on many operating
 systems (these are known as the p releases, and named like "OpenSSH
 2.1.1p4"). Please click on the provided link for your operating system. "

&gt; Does anyone know why "ssh" would be using ports around about 750-780
&gt; to communicate with a remote sshd process?

This _may_ be for backwards compatibility with rsh, which ssh supports
(which it shouldn't, IMAO).  rsh requires as part of its "authentication"
that the source port originate somewhere between ~512(?) and 1024, because
we all know that only superuser can bind to ports &lt; 1024, therefore you
must be trusted, right? (you wacky berkeleyians, you).

&gt; Surely this should be impossible.

It's setuid.  How's that impossible?

&gt; PPS. Life was much better before computers anyway.
&gt; We were so much happier with typewriters, carbon paper [that's
&gt; where Cc: comes from!], long division by hand, log books,
&gt; slide rules, mental arithmetic, hand-written letters,
&gt; pounds, shillings and pence, ....

You're not a closet luddite by any chance?  (Mind you, I have this
thought several times a day regardless, usually just before the
caffeine kicks in).
