&gt; Daryl -- Glen was referring to the _latest_ rpm/deb. ie if there ahve been
&gt; _no_ rpms (debs) installed for 6 months, then don't boot... You wouldn't
&gt; need to replace _EVERY_ rpm within six months...

But I'm also arguing (oops, I meant debating) from the point of
view that you may not need to replace _ANY_ rpm within six months.
A firewall will have very little installed it; the last version
of bind came out November '99, Sendmail 8.9.3 has a build date
of September '99 according to my RPM (yet I know it's been around
a lot longer than that, and despite Sendmail's previous history
8.9.3 has been rock solid from a security standpoint).
Mind you, if you're clever enough to construct a firewall with
your bare hands, then you're probably clever enough to disable
such an automated check (and maybe that should be the challange?).

Ah well, moot point.  Noone showed much interest in the script
anyways :-/.
