Hi all.  Below is a cutout from my system log.  What I wish to bring to your attention is the second-last line (Infinite loop). After the infinite loop line, the Ethernet interface is USELESS.  Actually, the kernel appears to shut down the card (the
active light for yoda goes out on my hub).  Logging in locally at the terminal and restarting the eth0 interface will not cure the problem.  The syslog says that the interface has been restarted but the light for yoda on the hub stays out, and the other
computers cannot access it.

I have had no trouble with the system until just recently.  It has been running for nearly 12 months and the only failures have been for power outages.  The server is RH6.1.  Kernel is version 2.2.5-22 that shipped with RH6.1.  There are two things that I
think might be wrong.  Recently Win2kPro was installed on one of the boxes. Win2k is a pig, as it refuses to talk nicely to the Samba server and when the Win2k box is on network traffic is high as the Win2k bix insists on being master browser.

I run NFS, Samba, IP-Masq, DNS and a few other small things (seti, etc).

The other thing is that I installed autofs on my other Linux box to mount the NFS exports from yoda automatically when I change to /exports/yoda/&lt;certain directory&gt;.  This appears to work well however, and I cannot see it being the cause of the problem.

Any help in sorting the problem would be useful, as I do not want to have to reinstall the software on the server.  Actually, reinstalling is not an option as the floppy controller in the machine is most excellently cooked and will not let you use floppy
disks at all.  The bios does not support booting from CD-ROMS either, so if reinstalling is the only option then I will need to get another box!

Thanks for all your help in advance,
Adam
