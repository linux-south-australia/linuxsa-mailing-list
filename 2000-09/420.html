G'day Andrew,

&gt; &gt; Once again, it's lack of time.  No one's paying me $100 an hour
&gt; &gt; to do this.  I'm _losing_ $100 per hour by doing this security work.
&gt;
&gt; I certainly wouldn't say that your losing $100 per hour, look at it
&gt; as an investment in knowledge for yourself and possibly others, that
&gt; certainly can't be a waste of time.

Or look at it another way - if the orignal poster had spent 5 hours
looking at securing the box in the first place, instead of engaging
the complacency centre of their brain, they would have prevented
themselves from wasting 10 hours or more *after* they got broken
into :-)

And yes, it is complacency - those who plead ignorance of security
are making sad excuses, the writing is on the wall nearly every
day now.

Just overnight it was reported on "Today" that a US bank has
recommended that its customers cancel all credit and debit cards
because their *WEB* site was cracked into!

GAWD!  When will people learn that we can't leave the front door
unlocked any more, and that we *really* should have deadlocks
instead of the old vulnerable snib locks :(

Sure, it's not our fault the world has bad people in it, but it
is our fault if we don't do anything to protect ourselves against
them!

I've had half a dozen machines (linux, FreeBSD, Windohs and Sun)
sitting on the 'net permanently since the early 90's (thanks Mark!)
and I've not once had a personal machine of mine compromised in
any way.

Why?

Because I invested the time and money in setting up a simple, yet
effective firewall solution on my network.

Yes, that meant I sat down for a few hours and worked out how ipfw
rules worked, and how to make various applications still work while
those rules were in place.

No, it wasn't quick'n'easy, but neither is re-installing your OS
and recreating lost data.

Anyone, repeat, ANYONE connecting to the 'net (yes, even dialup)
should have *some* protection.

Anyone connecting to the net PERMANENTLY should have as much
protection as they can get their hands on!

&gt; I wish I got $100 per hour for my computing work :(

I don't :)

&gt; Just my 0.05 c (you try and find a 2c peice :))

I've got a bag of 'em here somewhere :-)

Cheers

Leigh
