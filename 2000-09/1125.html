 &gt; &gt; You don't need a license to use the frequency, provided you fit the
 &gt; &gt; power output requirements of the class license;  You do, however, need
 &gt; &gt; a license if you wish to run the link over a large distance.
 &gt; 
 &gt; OK. Next question is how much is it to become a licenced carrier and what 
 &gt; are the requirements?
 &gt; We are a registered charity who are only trying to link 2 of our offices 
 &gt; together over a distance of 1.6km, according to the street directory (line 
 &gt; of sight).

In that case becomming a carrier will probably be too expensive for you.

To become a licensed carrier you need to meet certain conditions (Telco
Act, Trade Practices Act, special conditions for carriers set by the
Minister and Commonweath/State/Territory Governments).  Then you need to
apply, with the required non-refundable application fee.  Then, if your
application is successful, you'll need to pay the license's annual charge,
which is a five-figure sum per year at minimum (it varies according to 
how much you earn from your network, but the minimum component is $10,000).

Following that you'll have to pay another amount per year to meet your
Universal Service Obligations, which is essentially a subsidy other carriers
pay to Telstra to fund telephone services in remote areas, as per Section 149
of the Telecommunications Act.

You're also required to join the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman
scheme, which currently requires joining a company called TIO Ltd and
signing a piece of paper which authorizes them to levy unlimited charges
and fines against you.  Their application form asks you questions about
things like the size of your share portfolio and how much your managing
director's house is worth just to make sure.

Then you'll need to pay legal bills and a staffmember to look after
the regulatory and reporting aspects of it.  You need to provide an
annual report to the ACA, you need to answer questions from the Minister,
you'll need additional licenses for things like microwave spectrum, you'll
need to have various legal documents to enter another organization's 
premises to install network equipment, and so on.

At the end of the day, if all you're interested in doing is linking two
offices together, it'll always be cheaper to find a real carrier and pay
them to do it for you.  Telstra, Agile, Optus, Amcom, and others all have
carrier licenses and buried fibre or copper in the City;  approach them
and ask how much it'll cost to do what you need.  Unless they're going to
charge $100,000 per annum for your 1.6km link, it'll be cheaper to use
one of them than it will be to do it yourself.
