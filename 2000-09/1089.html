Hi all,

Been thinking about all these security issues brought up in the past
couple of weeks on the list.
Surely it's just people like me that only use dial-up connections to an
ISP and maybe have a small home network that are ignorant of these
things?

Anyway I was wondering how many people use insecure protocols such as
telnet?
So I had a look at some SARNO traffic statistics:

For the month of September (up till 24th) only 0.114% of all traffic was
using telnet. Still that's 1586.29MB!
I'm assuming that this traffic is just through the universities, CSIRO
and Defense - organizations I would have thought would be especially
security conscious.
Especially as 14% of telnet traffic was through Defense!!!

Makes me feel like I'm not so ignorant after all - perhaps just deluded
by numbers.

Cheers,
Michael
