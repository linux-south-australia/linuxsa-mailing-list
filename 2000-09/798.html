&gt; And the current lack of commonality between Gnome components and

This is a work in progress.  Currently Mozilla is going through a semi-feature
freeze and improving reliability/speed being their focus.  They want a 1.0
release soon.  I'm not sure the component commonality is going to happen any
time soon, as they are different projects, ie Mozilla isn't a subproject of
GNOME.

Having said that, Mozilla will be bonobo-ized (the GNOME 2.0 object system) once
it settles down.  The intent is for Mozilla to be totally embeddedable in all
GNOME apps, via bonobo, for the 2.0 release (hopefully).

The same will be happenning with Star Office, but that won't be ready for GNOME
2.0.  Got to deal with them 9,000,000 lines of C++ and let the good stuff escape
:-)

&gt; Eazel is coming up with some interesting work, but it will be a while yet
&gt; before you can present a Windows/Mac power user with Gnome and expect them
&gt; to be impressed with the consistency and reliability of it all. There is a
&gt; lot of very clear code there though.

It's coming along.  The biggest problem with GNOME is the version that many
distros are shipping right now.  Grabbing the latest src, or going the Helix
GNOME route, gives you a **much** better environment than the standard Red Hat
GNOME setup.  This is a big shame, because GNOME is so much nicer than the
dominant distro makes it look :-(

&gt; The other thing I'm watching with interest is Star Office/KOffice. Anyone
&gt; else got comments on how they are progressing relative to each other?

I have to start by saying that I haven't used KOffice in anger, but have seen
their screenshots/magazine reviews etc, and on the other side, I've been
watching the openoffice mailing list. 

What I've heard about KOffice was that it's quite good if you can get it
installed - which was quite a problem if you weren't following the bleeding edge
KDE releases.

So far there isn't much KDE interest in the openoffice list, and that's probably
because the Open Office crowd have already announced gtk as the widget set to be
used.  So it seems KOffice and OpenOffice will be competitors, although KOffice
should benefit from lots of good stuff including import/export filters.  

As I mentioned, the GNOME hackers fully intend to bonobo-ise Star Office, so it
should be fully integrated with the GNOME desktop before too long.  The Win95
desktop-part of StarOffice will be the first thing to go, and all apps should
all become separated, but embeddable.  There's also an effort to look for reuse
amongst those 9million lines of code.  Like Mozilla, OpenOffice is a separate
project to GNOME, but should be more closely aligned.  At least there's no
licence issues this time around...

Should be fun, come Oct 31! :-)
