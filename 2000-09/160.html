Daryl et al:

&gt; Stop right there.  As I said yesterday, it's the destination port that
&gt; defines a service.  The source port has (for all intent) no bearing on
&gt; the matter.

Yes, I know that now. Despite my rather inept attempt at describing
things, my firewall does - on the main - behave itself and not block
things that I don't want it to block, which is a Good Thing (tm).
Essentially it disallows things that I don't want to be allowed using
rules such as:

ipchains -A input -p tcp -s any/0 -d $MYIP 25 -j DENY -l

(Append a DENY+LOG action to the rule-set input anything destined for my
IP address on the SMTP port from any destination - hence their source
can be anywhere, but the service SMTP is defined by the
destination....naturally this isn't going to help me if I decide to run
an MTA on port 77 or some other silly thing but I'm not going to :-P)

&gt; If my fetchmail client opens a connection to an IMAP server on port
&gt; 143, and the source port happens to be port 23 (unlikely, but I can
&gt; write specific code that will do this), that does NOT make it a telnet
&gt; session.  If your firewall rules think it is, then your firewall rules
&gt; are broken.

Essentially Richard Sharpe answered my dilemma quite eloquently. In
that, I assign the port number for the connect-back to an http session,
and said port number generally starts at the first available after
1024...
