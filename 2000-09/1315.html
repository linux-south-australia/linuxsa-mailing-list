Hi Jeremy,

The forums on the freesco site are very good for getting questions answered.

Thanks for the info about Leader, I'll follow them up tomorrow.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt; Today installed a new freesco modem router in an office today, but I'm
&gt; experiencing a few problems with it. General web browsing/icq/real
&gt; player/email etc all work fine over all clients, however there are a few
&gt; propriatary applications which are causing me a few problems.
&gt;
&gt; The first program which is not working properly reports the following
&gt; error:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &lt;annoning message&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Unable to establish your computer as an Internet server on TCP/IP address
&gt; 203.166.244.97 Port Number 22038
&gt;
&gt; The TCP/IP address 203.166.244.97 is invalid or already in use.
&gt;
&gt; In order to run the workstation you will need to have a valid routable
&gt; internet TCP/IP address.
&gt;
&gt; Inform your Internet Service Provider etc etc blah blah blah.
&gt;
&gt; Make sure you have a Internet TCP/IP address for every computer you want to
&gt; link to the Internet.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/annoying message&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The first thing I tried was adding the internal IP address of the computer
&gt; using the application and the port number to the Port Forwarding
&gt; configuration file ... hoping for joy, i started the application up again,
&gt; and it reports a different pport number. Everytime it reports a different
&gt; number ranging between 21000 and 23000 so far.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know any simple solutions to resolving this problem ?
&gt;
&gt; The other application giving me problems is a windoze app which uses VPN.
&gt; It refuses to make any connection. Is there anything I have to do for
&gt; virtual private networking to work ?
&gt;
&gt; The freesco router computer itself is a 486 66mhz 16mb ram 520mb hdd, and
&gt; the freesco software uses a linux kernel 2.0.38.
&gt;
&gt; Would I be better off wiping all freesco off the system and load a proper
&gt; linux distro and manually configuring IP Masq to work with these
&gt; applications .... or is it impossible to even get these to work with IP
&gt; Masq ???
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance for any help,
&gt; Jeremy
