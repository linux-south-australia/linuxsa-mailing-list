&gt; So does anyone know of an Adelaide ISP that does support linux
&gt; connections?

Well, I used to use Ace Internet (www.ace.net.au) and the admin there
was very helpful with Linux.. he spent many hours on the fone with a
friend of mine getting my friends computer to dial into the system and
access the net.

I currently use Dingoblue (www.dingoblue.net.au) and they seem to offer
linux support, although I ahve not tried it out.  They have a page
available for members about how to set up your connection under linux.
That's probably not so useful if you cannot connect, but it isn't too
bad if you sign up electronically then download the page while connected
at Work/uni/school/current ISP/etc and print it.

&gt; P.S. The same in regards to ADSL in Adelaide (I know there's no
&gt; active ADSL in Adelaide yet, I mean future plans (then again if an
&gt; ISP supports linux for normal Modem dialup they'll probably do it for
&gt; ADSL (well that's kinda obvious (don'tcha just love parenthesis)))
&gt; think that's all the parenthisis closed :&gt; ).

Helstra support Linux for dialup, don't they??? AFIK for ADSL you _MUST_
have Windows95/98/NT/2000/ME for their ADSL PCI card to operate... you'd
think they'd just give you an ADSL modem that connects to your ethernet
(like a lot of satellite internet providers do).

Has anyone had any success with Linux and the ADSL card from Telstra
(probably not anyone in Adelaide), because I would like to move this way
when the service is available, and I can afford it.  However, I DO NOT
want to run my ADSL connection under Winblows(goates!) because that
would mean that my connection would be down more often than it is up!

Cheers,
Adam
