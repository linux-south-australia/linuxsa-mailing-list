Hi,

&gt; It has 64Mb RAM supplied as 2x16Mb EDO sims and 1x32Mb DRAM. It has been
&gt; happy to believe it has 64Mb RAM for some time, but recently has decided
&gt; it only has 48. By swapping in and out the various sims I believe it is
&gt; now of the impression that the 32 DRAM is 16. On boot it reports
&gt; something like
&gt; bank 0 NONE
&gt; bank 1 SYNC DRAM
&gt; bank 2 EDO RAM.
&gt; 
&gt; I know very little about hardware, chips are for eating IMHO. Does
&gt; anyone know if it is possible for a 32MB DRAM to half-die (I'd have
&gt; thought it would be dead or not dead), and is it possible that the bank
&gt; 1 SYNC DRAM msg above points to some interleaving or somesuch that is
&gt; effectively halving the available physical RAM on this sim?

What happenes when you run with the DIMM or the SIMMS only, Do you get
32MB reported ? When I've had memory problems in the past, faults normaly
manifest themselves in the form of BSOD/Kernel Panic/Mac Debug Screens. If
memory doesn't like the other sort then its sometimes mis-reports the
ammount. If it was working before, sometimes unplugging- and re-seating
the RAM helps.

Older BIOSes liked to be told of the new RAM, by going in to the BIOS then
re-saving the details. I've not heard of a DIMM/SIMM mis-reporting its
own size, but I don't know enough about memory technology to comment if it
can successfully work after some fault that loses half its capacity.

cya
