<H1>Strange IPCHAINS Behaviour</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I had some problems getting IPCHAINS to behave itself:

* computer was an older i468 with a default RedHat 6.2 installation

My first odd behaviour was:

* ipchains -F
 - dumped the rules but not the policy

This caused me to be wholly suspicious of ipchains itself - if it
doesn't reset the policy (to the default ACCEPT state), what else isn't
working?

In addition:

* I had a default inputDENY, outputDENY, forwardDENY policy
 - I allowed everything on the localhost interface lo for all three
chains
 - I had set /proc/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1
 - I had allowed a syn connection out to any web server
 - I had allowed a ack connection back [terminology may be bad here]
  --&gt;
  ipchains -A output -p tcp -i ppp+ -s ${MYIP} ${UNPRIVPORTS} -d any/0
80 -j ACCEPT
  ipchains -A input -p tcp -i ppp+ -s any/0 80 -d ${MYIP} ${UNPRIVPORTS}
! -y -j ACCEPT
 - I had allowed DNS
 - I had added:
  --&gt; ipchains -A forward -i ppp+ -s ${LAN_ADDRESS_IN_CIDR} -j MASQ

* allowed DNS with various rules
* localhost (i.e. the 486) could see the internet and use lynx to
connect
* the other machines on the network - Windows 9X machines - that could
ping the localhost (firewall) machine, couldn't speak to the outside web
servers but seemed to be able to resolve domain names

Conceptually I had:

* denied EVERYTHING
* allowed DNS
* allowed HTTP
* masqueraded my LAN network

I've done this before and it worked. I have thought about this and:

* Windows is performing sillies (from what I looked at, it looked like
it would behave itself, and when I reset all the rules to ALLOW and
performed the MASQ command by itself, it could see the Internet)
* Linux is broken

I'd be inclined to say Linux is broken...at least the -F flag doesn't
work as documented....any ideas on this?

My moon, upon my soul you still shine
My sun, it is you I still see...
