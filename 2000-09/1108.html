&gt;  &gt; Quick Question:
&gt;  &gt; What are the legalities behind using these cards to link offices that 
are
&gt;  &gt; not next to each other (eg, 4 or 5km apart)? Do you need a licence?
&gt;
&gt; Yes.  You need a carrier license if you want to run a link over more than
&gt; 500m, or over any distance where the A and B ends of the link are not 
part
&gt; of each others' immediate circle.
&gt;
&gt; This means you can link two offices of the same company together if 
they're
&gt; less than 500 m apart;  you can link an employee to an office if they're
&gt; less than 500 m apart too;  But you can't link offices from two separate
&gt; companies together over any distance without a carrier licence, nor can
&gt; you link an employee to their office if the distance is greater than 
500m.

Both endpoints are owned by us. The land in between (ie, North Terrace, the 
Torrens) isn't.

&gt;  &gt; Are they in a frequency band that is licence free?
&gt;
&gt; You're confusing two different licenses.  There is a class license on the
&gt; use of the frequency band utilized by 2.4 GHz microwave spread-spectrum
&gt; equipment.  That's the license which permits you to use them at all.
&gt; It has power output limitations on it, but that's about all.

I was referring to the radio licence, not the carrier licence. You need a 
licence to operate a radio on the commercial bands, you do not need a 
licence (under the class licence) for a CB. This was my main concern. As 
you have stated, the class licence is 'free' as long as you comply with the 
frequency / power output / no interference type requirements.

&gt; Separate to that is the carrier license which is required if you wish
&gt; to send any voice or data telecommunications service at all, whether it's
&gt; on wire, fibre or microwave, over distances greater than 500m.

Is this also in the case where both endpoints are owned by the same company 
/ individual. As I read what you wrote, it applies if they are not owned by 
the same company.

(Ok, I just re-read it and you mean ANY link over 500M needs a carrier 
licence, and links between companies less than 500M need a licence, 
correct?)

&gt;  &gt;Is it legal or illegal?
&gt;
&gt; Illegal.
