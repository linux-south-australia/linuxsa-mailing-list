&gt; There has to be a certain minimum level of understanding, but also the
&gt; everyday user doesn't need to be a computer expert.

Agreed.  I happen to think that tar meets that minimum level.


&gt; I would love to be made redundant by haveing all my (l)users computer
&gt; experts, and able to solve their own problems.  I could get on and make
&gt; my systems run efficiently.  It doesn't work because mosrt people lack
&gt; time, inclination, aptitude, ability or are too lazy.

You forgot to add that many system administrators discourage their users
from exploring, for example by over use of chroot environments, and by
stupid menu shells, and so on.  Groucho Marx said that if ten people tell
you you're drunk, fall down.  You keep mumbling the mantra, "it's too hard
for your pretty head to understand," and then wonder why your users act
like lusers.  There's a lesson here for you.

Not that we are talking about users.  Users implies people other than those
who operate and administer the computer.  We are specifically talking about
people who run unix on their own computers, thus they operate the computer,
and unless you believe in "zero administration," they must also administer
it.  Let me make this quite clear: This is an issue about how much
knowledge unix administrators, even casual unix administrators, should
have.  Let me also repeat what I first said: they should know tar (or cpio,
or both.)  Does anyone claim that tar is too complicated?
