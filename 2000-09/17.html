Setting some history straight:

  The AARNet operations were sold to Telstra.  As a result there
  were no longer positions for technical networking staff at the
  Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (then owners of AARNet
  and essentially a Canberra-based lobbying organisation).

  Telstra made job offers to all the ex-AARNet staff, most accepted,
  including Geoff.

  Over the past five years, AARNet's technical resources have been
  provided by volunteers from the universities, with a great deal of
  encouragement and guidance from the original AARNet staff.

  For example, Geoff continued to administer .EDU.AU, which turned out
  very well.  If it were administered by a uni there would be all
  sorts of nasty inter-uni slurs should a mistake be made or a task
  take too long.  Some universities have also not been impressed
  by the management of .COM.AU by a commercial arm of Melbourne Uni.

  This year the changing economics of the telecommunications market
  in Australia and the vigourous head-hunting of uni staff by ISPs
  and technology companies (eg: I was offered US$150,000pa + US$1.5m
  in stock to join Juniper this morning) lead to the re-establishment
  of AARNet as a staffed entitiy.  Rather than have this entity within
  the AVCC, an organisation which not all unis wish to belong to, it
  was established as a stand-alone non-profit entity, AARNet Pty Ltd.
