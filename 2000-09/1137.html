&gt; It all depends on the advertising. LinuxSA and AUUG spent big and got

Neither LinuxSA nor AUUG spent big on advertising, nor for that matter did
either spend big on any other aspect of the SA event.  The SA event was
splendidly successful thanks to the very generous donations of its various
sponsors and the almost tireless efforts of the organisers and helpers.  I
don't believe there was any paid advertising other than one cheap ad. in
the local paper on the day of the actual event.  I understand that we did
get one person who saw that ad. and attended.  It certainly is wrong to say
that we got a big turnout because of it, let alone that we spent big.

We did get some lovely coverage in the press after the event, and it's
somewhat of a pity that the paper concerned was The Age, because they don't
have a sibling paper in Adelaide so we had no opportunity to capitalise on
it.  (We knew we would be written up a month before the event, and would
have loved to advertise in conjunction, but not much point in a Melbourne
advet for an Adelaide event.)

If I may share my experience: an installfest will be successful if the
organisers work their butts off.  Maybe money can substitute for that, but
who's got money?

I do believe that a nationwide installfest can gain enormously from the
support that AUUG could offer.  AUUG is the premiere unix users' group in
Australia, with more experience organising unix related events than you can
poke a stick at.  It would be a great pity if an installfest were organised
without trying for AUUG's involvement because their purpose, goal if you
will, is to support and foster unix and open source.  (Note that's unix
without the 'tm', of which Linux is but one flavour.)  Let's not leave our
biggest and most natural ally out in the cold.

I might also add that September is when AUUG normally holds their national
conference.  Perhaps there's a natural synergy in holding a national
installfest in conjunction with a national unix conference? The installfest
could be held at the site of the conference, as well as other venues in all
of the other cities around Australia.
