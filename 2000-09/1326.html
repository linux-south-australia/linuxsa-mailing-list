&gt; WINDOWS TO THE WORLD
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; What do you expect from a window manager? Is it bells
&gt; and whistles and eye-candy galore, or is it just speed
&gt; with no noticeable features at all?
&gt; 
&gt; To my mind a window manager should do as the name
&gt; suggests, manage windows and give you a clean
&gt; interface to launch your applications from. I don't
&gt; want a cluttered desktop full of icons that i will
&gt; never launch, I don't want anything that may decrease
&gt; my performance while running a high resource intensive
&gt; application. In fact, I don't even want to realize the
&gt; window manager is there.
&gt; 
&gt; With a 14" screen and 800x600 resolution I definitely
&gt; don't need a huge panel on the bottom like gnome, or a
&gt; top and bottom panel like KDE, and while they are
&gt; configurable they are still floating in memory. Does
&gt; anyone else agree that Enlightenment is just a race
&gt; between developers to make the most bloated software
&gt; in existence? Should we rename it EnBloatenIt?
&gt; 
&gt; There are only two other Window Managers I would
&gt; consider using and that's the very good but buggy
&gt; Sawmill and the old war-horse Window-Maker.
&gt; 
&gt; ENTER BLACKBOX
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; All window managers have their faults, nothing is
&gt; perfect after all. But for simplicity and speed (as
&gt; well as stability) you can't go past BlackBox. OK so
&gt; it's not so well documented, and alt-tab doesn't seem
&gt; to work, but hey it's open sourced after all. But the
&gt; best of all is that the tar ball of the source is
&gt; under 300kb. I cannot tell a lie, it is true BlackBox
&gt; is Tiny. It even comes with some simple themes; which
&gt; don't over power the screen. BlackBox is also easy to
&gt; install...Well sort of, you may need to manually move
&gt; things around and you have to manually edit the menu
&gt; file. So maybe if you are a newbie you should continue
&gt; with KDE for a while longer.
&gt; 
&gt; WHERE TO NOW
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; If you use Linux, it's because you like to experiment,
&gt; lets face it that's what it's all about, so what do
&gt; you have to lose from giving BlackBox a go?
&gt; 
&gt; Point lynx or the other browser to
&gt; <A HREF="http://blackbox.alug.org/">http://blackbox.alug.org/</A> and see for your self how
&gt; UN-bloated software really needs to be.
