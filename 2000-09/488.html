Looks to me like you have a proxy server (squid) with a
cache size larger than the available disk size.

if you don't need squid running (in which case it shouldnt'
be caching anything) then you can shut it down and wipe the
entire mounted partition.  However, if you require squid to
be running, then you may want to look at squid.conf which
has a line similar to

cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256
                               ^^^
                             size of squid cache

and reduce it to something a little more realistic.

I am making the assumption that this is a mounted partition
rather than just a directory on a single partition.

Regards

Tim
