&gt; I have a need for a mail server to append a legal notice at the foot of all
&gt; emails passing through it - similar to the linuxsa footer at the bottom of
&gt; this email.

The text at the end of this e-mail is appended using majordomo, a
mailing list manager.  Note that it doesn't work.  For example, it
will break multipart MIME e-mails (probably causing them to be rejected
by some e-mail gateways).  All methods I know of for adding a disclaimer
also break digital signatures: strangely enough they report the message
as being modified in transit.

With all that in mind, the best place to add a disclaimer is simply
in every user's .signature file.  This also allows them to delete the
disclaimer where appropiate.  For example, we recently had to discard
a tender response where the e-mailed repsonse contained an automatically
appended footer disclaiming the e-mail's contents.  Oddly enough, we
could not convince our legal advisors to disregard the disclaimer :-)

If you really want to proceed, have a look at:

  <A HREF="http://aeschi.ch.eu.org/milter/">http://aeschi.ch.eu.org/milter/</A>

As noted above, it doesn't work because there is no way to make the
concept work.  But it appears to have the right architectural approach
for stuffing about with e-mail messages in transit (eg: to delete virii,
etc).

There are also programming hooks for content scanners within sendmail
itself.  These changed to be more usable with sendmail 8.10.  See the
release notes.  Again, these could modify the message in transit.

&gt; Where do I start looking?!  :(

Always start with:
