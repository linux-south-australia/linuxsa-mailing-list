Robyn!

&gt; I downloaded the Mozilla source and compiled it overnight last night.

Which Mozilla source? I found the "real" milestone17, whether source or
prebuilt is very slow...you need to get the latest (it is actually
called the latest) source.

&gt; K6-2 400
&gt; 64MB Ram
&gt; 17GB Hard Drive
&gt; 8MG Savage 4 Video Card

That's a reasonable system, however I have a strong suspicion that
Mozilla is a major CPU and graphics hog. I would offer the following
observations:

* if it relies on Floating Point operations
 - forget it; AMD's floating point units before the
Athlon/Duron/Thunderbird just don't cut the cake

* if it relies on fancy accelerator card operations (Mesa or OpenGL)
 - somehow get them going

I would suspect that a program that could use OpenGL, but didn't find it
functioned correctly in hardware would implement it in software.

&gt; I have compiled my kernel with support for the K6-2 but Mozilla is running
&gt; like a dog. I've turned off Java but even the menus are slow in responding
&gt; with a more than average amount of drive thrashing.

I suspect you're running a 400MHZ i386. The kernel developers insist on
using -m586 when it should be -march=pentium. -m586 aligns things
nicely, but the code is still fully compatible with the i386 (except it
may be misaligned). -march=pentium also aligns things, but also allows
GCC to use pentium specific instructions.

I would note to everyone that many binary installs of virtually anything
are compiled for i386's. If you install these binaries on your system
you've probably got a very fast, very expensive 386. You are inevitably
going to ask, but "how do I know?":

* if you compiled it from source and used defaults
 - probably yes
 - grep "march" * may find a -march option

* if you got a binary which didn't specify an architecture
 - probably yes

Otherwise you don't really know. The only way to know is to go get the
sources (easy to do with GPL software) and rebuild it with customised
CFLAGS and see whether it does make a difference.

On that note, I have decided to write:

* The LinuxSA System V Startup Howto
* The LinuxSA Building GNU Compliant Source Code Howto

&gt; Any help?
&gt;

My words fail, yet I know that you are with me
My moon, upon my soul you still shine
My sun, it is you I still see...
