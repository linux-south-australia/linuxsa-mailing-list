Hi,

&gt; Has anyone had any success with the downloadable ISO images of the RH7.0
&gt; CD1 and 2?
&gt; 
&gt; I have compared the first few sectors of CD1 ISO and a known working ISO
&gt; (Mandrake 7.1) and there appear to be a few differences, some that look
&gt; reasonable.

Well, I downloaded on Tuesday, and setup a PC Wednesday. The downlaod was
slow, but then I think everyone else was also downloading.

Here are some impressions:

I had a HDD with RH6.2 from an obselete instalation. I tried first an
upgrade, to save install time, and keep some of the config I had. This
failled due to lack of disk space. This was possibly an error, and it was
counting working space, but it was a 1.5 GB partition, and only had 200MB
free space, so that could explain it.

Next step, then was start from scratch. I really didn't need the stuff on
the HDD. A custom install worked out at about 1.1 GB after I'd deselected
and selected some packages, this is still a bit bloated as it didn't
include stuff like Tek, and a number of server packages. No space problems
this time, but at the end of the install of packeges, the install just
froze, no error messages on the screen or any console.

Try 3, ignore individual package installation, just go to the
classification level (NFS server, SMB server etc). That worked. Booted
fine. Lilo now defaults to graphic mode. Menus re-arranged now, bit harder
to find things. Using xinetd, rather than inetd ( this confused me). There
is a problem with the mouse losing conectivity, and freezing, but that may
be hardware related too.

So from one install first impressions: disapointed, RH 6.0 and 6.2 seem
better from an out of the box. It is continuing RH slick install, and also
supply everything mentality, and I certainly had no problems with any
driver configs. After some more installs, I might change my opinion better
or worse. I'll still try installing it, but currently not on any mission
critical hardware yet.

cya
