Quick Question:

What are the legalities behind using these cards to link offices that are 
not next to each other (eg, 4 or 5km apart)? Do you need a licence? Are 
they in a frequency band that is licence free? Is it legal or illegal?

&gt; The Apple AirPort is working coolie doolies with Non-Apple clients. If 
you
&gt; open the AirPort up, you will find that it is an AMD486 processor with an
&gt; Orinoco PCMCIA Card in it. Quite a nice little box. The Apple gear _is_
&gt; cheap, seeing as the education price for the Orinoco cards is more 
expensive
&gt; than the Apple gear retail ;)
&gt;
&gt; Apple Store online sells the cards at $182 ea, so I am sure that you 
could
&gt; get them down quite a lot cheaper than stuff from Lucent..
&gt;
&gt; The WaveLAN gear will go upto about 25Km depending on the environment and
&gt; the speed that you want to run the link at. It'l go to about 11-15Km
&gt; depending on the environment at Full Speed.
&gt;
&gt; Its very nice gear. I run a link that uses the evil Lucent WavePOINT gear
&gt; (an emmbeded box that acts as a brigde) and we get about 480Kb/Sec from 
it
&gt; going from our ISPs Melbourne FTP Server.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone needs help with this gear, email me. I've played around with it
&gt; enough to know how to get it going ;)

&gt; &gt; Hi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; $2600 seems pretty high. Have you had a look at the wireless network 
stuff
&gt; &gt; that mimp has? I think it's hundreds for the starter pack, not 
thousands.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone used the Apple Airport (Lucent chipset) equipment with
&gt; non-Apple systems? I don't see why it shouldn't work, but I haven't 
tried.
&gt; We have just got one here and Apple was charging $500 for the hub and 
$100
&gt; per PCMCIA card. If it works in !Apples then it is the best-priced radio
&gt; LAN I've seen in Australia.
