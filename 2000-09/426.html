&gt; &gt; &gt; The trouble is that new vulnerabilities are being continuously added.

At least all of them are documented as found. You just need to keep up
to date. It's the same with any system (If you care about your data). I
doubt there will ever be a perfect operating system.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then what on earth were you using POP2 for?

;-)

&gt; A few times in the last year, people have asked me if they
&gt; could have e-mail accounts (using pop, imap or whatever), and
&gt; I told them that I was not running such software because I
&gt; thought it was a serious security hole.

It can be.

&gt; 
&gt; So I was quite surprised to find that I _was_ running such
&gt; post-office software.
&gt; 
&gt; I.e. I was _not_ using POP2 for anything.

Then why not check these things after installation. The first thing I do
(usually before configuring the network interfaces) is comment out 95%
of /etc/inetd.conf. When I started at Xavier College, the previous Sys
Admin had done a default install of RedHat 5.1/5.2 on 3 servers.
Needless to say the buggy UW IMAPd that was shipped with (5.2?) was
hacked within days. If he had spent the time commenting out all the
unnecessary services, there would have been no problem.

Someone else mentioned that Microsoft Systems tend to be easier in that
respect, which is kind of true. You have your core kernel/software bugs
which can lead to great big security holes, but Microsoft is not shipped
with much extra software. To truly measure security between, say, NT and
Linux, you'd need to take into account NT, MS Exchange, MS Poxy server
and IIS.

&gt; 
&gt; I at no time told the linux installation software that
&gt; I wanted post-office software.
&gt; It was just inserted for my pleasure by Red Hat.

Did you do the custom install and select individual packages? If so, you
would have been asked whether you want to install IMAPd. The help screen
says that it contains the POP stuff also. Having it uncommented in
/etc/inetd.conf is bad, but you shouldn't be installing stuff that you
don't need.

&gt; 
&gt; At least the recent SuSE installation routines do ask
&gt; you which services you want installed, and this gives you
&gt; the opportunity to veto the dodgier ones.

Some versions of most dists do this. I think most of them ask about the
/etc/rc.d/init.d/* services but not the /etc/inetd.conf stuff.

&gt; 
&gt; The ultimate cause of this is probably the same as the
&gt; ultimate cause of MS software vulnerabilities.

No. The two are very different. Microsoft software is closed and Linux
is open. You have the opportunity to keep your system clean with Linux,
whereas Windows you don't.

&gt; Namely, they try to give you as many features as possible,
&gt; because they know that _marketing_ success depends on
&gt; everyone being able to find their favourite feature.
&gt; But the downside of featuritis is that you get
&gt; more opportunities for vulnerabilities, the more features
&gt; you've got.

This will always be a tradeoff. Granted, Most things should be disabled
by default, but they aren't. Perhaps you'd volunteer your services to
Someone like redhat to help make sure these things don't happen?

&gt; 
&gt; I think that RedHat have tried to add as much as possible,
&gt; in the interests of marketing.

... and possibly because they use it themselves and like having stuff on
a couple of CDs instead of a bunch of FTP sites. You have the option to
not install some of this stuff, but choose not to. Please don't blame
the software company for your laziness. I actually have a friend who
will unselect during an install and manually install everything else on
top of that. Whilst this is an extreme, he hasn't been hacked ;-)

&gt; Some of the other distributions are more spartan, I believe,
&gt; at the cost of not keeping the customers happy with all
&gt; the lovely software packages.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the problem with the default installations.

Yes, users expect everything to be done for them and make assumptions
about the security of the installed system.

&gt; They're neat in the short term, but then you have to go through
&gt; and rip out the vulnerabilities.

Or leave them out to start with

&gt; 
&gt; Ah... and my main message in my initial over-lengthy post
&gt; was: if you have an old redhat 5.2 machine, rip out the pop2
&gt; server immediately!

Which is what RedHat's security advisories have said since the problem
was found. RTFM.

&gt; 
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------
&gt; On a related subject, maybe linuxSA could organise
&gt; a security-fest. E.g. a weekend, or just one day on a
&gt; week-end, of seminars on linux security.

Great idea.

&gt; Those who are paid to teach this stuff will not want
&gt; to work for free. But for the rest of us, putting together
&gt; a 30-minute presentation might not be too onerous anyway.

I'd be willing, but I am not sure that there's anything I'm particularly
expert at.

&gt; And besides, if 50 people were to pay $10 each, that should
&gt; make enough to recompense some of the security professionals
&gt; out there if they were to deliver a seminar.
&gt; 
&gt; It should be possible to fit in 10 30-minute talks in
&gt; a one-day seminar. Then all we need is a list of the
&gt; top 10 security topics, and following such a
&gt; "paranoia seminar" we should all feel a bit more comfortable
&gt; when we approach the terminal each morning.
&gt; (I personally approach the terminal with dread every morning!)

Not I, and most of my machines are connected to the 'net 24/7. They are
not the most secure boxen in the world, but I make it my duty to keep up
to date with these things.

I mean, hell, you can do some pretty funky stuff with ipchains and
portfw to allow access to services on a private address range. By
turning off all services on your gateway box and specifically allowing
stuff to access your other boxen, you have a system where you know what
can possibly be exploited. It leaves a lot less for you to keep up to
date with.

&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.

Hope it helps,
Matt
