&gt; I think the fact the [GNOME and Mozilla] *are* seperate projects is the
&gt; strength.  The GNOME hackers aren't obliged to port/maintain these huge
&gt; code bases that may evolve in different directions.  Since they're both
&gt; now GPL'd, projects like GNOME *and* KDE will be able to lift useful bits
&gt; and discard the bulk.

Speaking as a programmer with decades of experience I should say that I am
not confident that code re-use is a particularly viable paradigm.

I have spent significant effort writing reusable libraries, and if I say so
myself I have produced quite brilliant pieces of code, but they proved to
have limited potential for re-use because the language that I chose -- UCSD
Pascal -- fell out of favour.  I am sure there would be thousands of COBOL
programmers who know exactly how I feel.

Another reason why code re-use is not the success that its pundits expected
is that many programmers do prefer to re-invent a wheel rather than use
somebody else's.  That's not entirely unreasonable: often the wheel you get
is the wrong colour and it can be easier to make a new wheel than to work
out how to paint somebody else's.

Finally, wheels are often hard to identify.  Something as complicated as
Mozilla will surely consist of many great components, but the effort of
working out which ones stand alone, and which ones require others, and
exactly what those other components are (and note the recursive nature of
that problem) can be large.  This is a sub-class of the issue I raised
in the immediately preceeding paragraph.

To conclude: there no doubt are many useful bits of code in both Mozilla
and GNOME, but don't assume that they will be easy to lift out.  I Have
seen none of Mozilla's code, but going on (extensive) past experience I
anticipate the effort to re-use to be larger than the effort to re-write.

NB: Algorithm re-use is an entirely different story.  Wirth's B-Tree
algorithm, from his book, "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs", is
probably the one that everyone implements despite the fact that his
"illustrative" programs are awful.
