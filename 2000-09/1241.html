&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;Anyone out there using mod_auth_pam.so with Apache 1.3.12?

I'm using mod_auth_pam.so with Apache 1.3.9 on Solaris 8.

&gt;I am having a
&gt;problem where I cannot successfully authenticate. If I use a username
&gt;that doesn't exist, I get a message in the logs telling me so. If I use
&gt;one that does exist (with the correct password), I get told that the
&gt;password can't be found. I this points the finger more towards the
&gt;actual PAM config, but it seems OK, because I copied the pam.d/httpd
&gt;file from another service which is known to work.....
&gt;
&gt;At the moment (for simplicity) I am using just the standard pam_pwdb.so
&gt;lib with MD5 and shadow (the same as a known working service).
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any ideas on the subject?

Your problem is caused by the fact that Apache doesn't run as root, so it 
doesn't have access to the shadow password file to get the password 
information. Generally, Apache runs either as user nobody or as user 
apache. When it wants to authenticate somebody using pam, it calls the pam 
library functions to do this, which looks for the configuration file 
/etc/pam.d/httpd. This file lists the PAM modules to use to try to 
authenticate the user. These shared libraries are loaded into the Apache 
process by the PAM library, all of which is running under the apache user 
id, and have the same permissions as Apache. When pam_pwdb.so tries to read 
/etc/shadow it gets a permission denied error and returns an error to the 
PAM library and in turn to Apache. In case you are wondering, you can't 
have setuid shared library.

I can think of three ways in which you could solve this. You could change 
the permissions on /etc/shadow to allow the apache user read-only access to 
the file. This is not particularly desirable security wise, but may be 
acceptable to you depending on your situation.

You could run samba on the machine and use the PAM module pam_smb or 
pam_ntdom to authenticate with samba. If you do this then make sure you get 
the very latest versions, as there was a security problem with earlier 
versions. The latest pam_smb is version 1.1.6, i'm not sure about 
pam_ntdom. I use pam_smb here.

Your other alternative is to write a custom PAM module that can run as an 
unprivileged user and talk to a custom server running as root which 
verifies passwords, but why bother with this when samba and pam_smb can do 
an equivalent job.

Cheers,

Martin.
