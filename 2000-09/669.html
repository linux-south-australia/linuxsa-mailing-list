&gt; &gt; Given that it's in an NT/Linux environment, I feel that AMANDA would be
&gt; &gt; a bad choice, unless it's just a case of backing up files, and not
&gt; &gt; machines. From what I have seen, if you want full system recovery from
&gt; &gt; backups in a NT/Linux environment, using an NT server with 3rd party
&gt; &gt; software is the only solution.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm happy to be proven wrong if someone has other ideas/solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; Get rid of Windows NT. There's little need for it.
&gt; 
&gt; The AMANDA solution would work if you didn't care about restoring you
&gt; File system ACLs and didn't want to backup your system registry (a lot
&gt; of NT backup software can't back up the registry either).

No offense meant Matthew, but I'm going to bite for once. How would you
know what his/my requirements are? Yes, this is a Linux list. Yes, Linux
rocks. Yes, Linux is far cooler than NT.

But for once, can we actually talk about the problem at hand? I'm
suggesting that if you have a NT/Linux environment, there is no Linux
based backup solution that will allow complete system restores from the
backup. Getting rid of NT is not the solution, and neither is AMANDA. If
there are any other real solutions, I'd love to hear about them, as I'd
much rather run a backup server/master on Linux than NT.
