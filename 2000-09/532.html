&gt; Hi All, 
&gt; 	I must say straight away i am a newbie. What i am keen to find out
&gt; is if anyone on the list can point me in the direction to buying a laptop
&gt; which is hardware compatible with Red Hat 6.2. I have been to the
&gt; support page at the Red Hat site and it seems that only Dell has a
&gt; certified system. What i am looking for is a system which is dual
&gt; bootable with linux and NT. I need a current system which is avaliable in
&gt; Adelaide. If anyone has any suggestions on how i should head that would be
&gt; greatly appreciated.

I've bought a DELL Inspiron 5000 recently, with Win98 preinstalled and now
running RedHat 6.2 (dual-boot).  I even used FIPS to shrink my FAT partition
successfully, first time.  I do not believe there is any issue having NT instead
and having that work with Linux/RH6.2 (perhaps disk partition resizing though?)

You should check out the Linux Laptops page at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/</A> which gives step-by-step
guides for many, many laptops.

The two areas of biggest concern is modems and X windows.  

Make sure that if you purchase any laptop with an internal modem that it isn't a
winmodem.  Yes, it's more than likely you can get it working, but at sub-optimal
performance (since your CPU is doing the DSP stuff).  I bought a Xircom 56k
modem / 10-100mbit combo PCMCIA (Type-III) card which works well for me with the
supplied open-source driver that comes with RH6.2 (actually pcmcia 3.18.20
(??)).

X is another area of concern - make sure that XF86 3.3.6 supports the chipset in
your laptop.  XF4.0 probably won't (yet), but I was able to use the standard
XF86 that came with Red Hat 6.2 (3.3.6) albeit with the XF86Config file
specified in one of the howtos listed on the web site I mentioned.

Summary - only buy a laptop which someone else has installed Linux on and you
have the step by step instructions, or an offer from them to help you out.  Much
easier that way.  You could go and get a Dell I7.5K, which is RH certified, but
at a huge premium - it isn't a cheap laptop.

Having said that, I love my Dell I5K.  I now sleep less now that I've got it.

All IMHO, your experiences may differ, proceed with caution...
