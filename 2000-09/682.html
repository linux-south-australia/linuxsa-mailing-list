&gt;Unfortunately, we seem to have a bit of a problem with the Alcatel modem
&gt;being very unreliable. It seems to stop wanting to talk to the computer
&gt;after a seemingly random period of time, which ranges from about 15 minutes
&gt;up to several hours. The only way to fix it is to physically turn the ADSL
&gt;modem off and then back on. Telstra are not sure what the problem is

We've been using Alcatel HDSL modems for 6 months now, and the ethernet
Interface is not exactly up to Telco standards. Fortunately, uptimes seem to
be no worse than 30 days, and failures can be avoided by a pre-emptive
reboot every so often (much like a heavily loaded IIS server..). In all
cases, the DSL link remained up and stable, but the ethernet had wandered
off somewhere.

I couldn't say if the HDSL units are related to the ADSL boxes by anything
besides the badging, but I'd be interested to hear of any fix Telstra come
up with. Alcatel havn't been very useful in finding a fix, they refer it to
Germany who always blame DHCP configuration, even though it's not running.
