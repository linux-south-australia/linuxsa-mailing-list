Dieter!

&gt; I'd like to compile a modified kernel, and have browsed the docs
&gt; on how to do this.  There is, of course, a huge list of questions
&gt; that must be asked to determine exactly what has to be built, and
&gt; I understand that there are different approaches to setting all
&gt; the necessary values.

There is. My approach to any newcomer is:

* use make menuconfig or make xconfig
* use the HELP option
* be prepared to crash your system at least once if you are really
experimenting

&gt; My question is in regard to "make oldconfig", which uses a saved
&gt; config from a previous make.  Is there a way of getting the
&gt; saved .config file that coresponds to the kernel that is currently
&gt; installed?  That is, can I make a kernel that is essentially
&gt; identical to the one that is currently running and then change
&gt; that config incrementally?

Well, that's a difficult question to answer. Once you have built one
custom kernel you should be able to. Others on this list have told me
that the "kernel source" that is provided with the distro (RedHat,
Mandrake et al) may not have the same configuration as in /usr/src/linux
at the start. That is to say, the "default" configuration in the
"install" may not bear any resemblance to the kernel in the
RPM/DPKG/APT-GET PACKAGE or wotever....

I suggest that if your computer is noncritical, that you use make
menuconfig/help options, www.kernel.org and common sense to build a new
kernel....
