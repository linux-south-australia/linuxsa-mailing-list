I can't do the file transfer for you, alas I ahve no Jaz drive.

As to using Jaz under linux, I have never doen it, (see above), but I have
used my SCSI zip under linux and it is no big deal. I would assume using a
Jaz would be very similar.

The actual drive functions fine, just liek another scsi drive.

Instrucitons for using it follow:

Attach drive to scsi port.
	o boot(you may not need ot do this, I never did, but apparently
	  you aren;t supposed to connect scsi devices toa  pwered system
	  it has always work	ed for me, but the choice is yours data
	  safety and device safety is up to you).
	o mount the disk using mount as for any scsi device with 
	  whatever scsi address the drive has been allocated.
	  Once it is mounted you treeat it like a normal hard drive.
	o When you are finished unmount he disk using umount

If you want to swap disks on the fly I am not so sure(under intel
linuces).
My system wasw a LinuxPPC/MkLinux system, so the floppy required the
eject command , and cd could use it(rtteh eject command).
I simply used the eject command to eject the zip disk form the drive after
unmounting it and this worked fine for me.

There does appear to be an eject command for intel distros too, and the
man page specifically mention Zip and Jaz drives, but I have never tried
it under an intel linux so I can't comment.

I am not sure if the zip drive will eject the disk by using the button, as
I never did it, but I assume it will.

Hope this helps.

&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone out there do this? It's for business, so

&gt; 
&gt; The next question: 
&gt; What experience do people have with using JAZZ under Linux.
