Just got back from interstate.  Time to respond...

&gt; I have spent significant effort writing reusable libraries, and if I say so
&gt; myself I have produced quite brilliant pieces of code, but they proved to
&gt; have limited potential for re-use because the language that I chose -- UCSD
&gt; Pascal -- fell out of favour.  I am sure there would be thousands of COBOL
&gt; programmers who know exactly how I feel.

Languages come and go, but C remains :-)  But seriously folks, on Unix,
as long as your language of choice supports .o import, code reuse is
_possible_ albeit not easy.  I've personally reused Fortran/C++/C in a C
program[1] successfully this way.
 
&gt; Another reason why code re-use is not the success that its pundits expected
&gt; is that many programmers do prefer to re-invent a wheel rather than use
&gt; somebody else's.  

Not-Invented-Here (NIH) is very common.  Sometime ago a manager wrote
that down on my performance appraisel.  Since then I have worked on
fixing that chink.  Yes, programmers like to do it themselves, but
significant reduction in development time CAN be achieved if code reuse
is aggressively perused, in the right circumstances, even if that means
linking in some bloat[2].

&gt;                   That's not entirely unreasonable: often the wheel you get
&gt; is the wrong colour and it can be easier to make a new wheel than to work
&gt; out how to paint somebody else's.

That's ok for simple bits of code, but if you're talking large portions
of code[3] then coding is only a small part of the equation.  Testing
effort (amongst other things) needs to be considered.  And often if you
can inherit a test suite for a body of code, and you have confidence in
it, then it's probably worthwhile learning the code - afterall one of
the key attributes of programming is laziness[4].

&gt; Finally, wheels are often hard to identify.  Something as complicated as
&gt; Mozilla will surely consist of many great components, but the effort of
&gt; working out which ones stand alone, and which ones require others, and
&gt; exactly what those other components are (and note the recursive nature of
&gt; that problem) can be large.  This is a sub-class of the issue I raised
&gt; in the immediately preceeding paragraph.

Of course.  "Here's some code.  Go find something to resuse.", is almost
always destined to failure.  I believe that both Star Office and Mozilla
has large volumes of documentation explaining how stuff works.  This
(IMHO) is a necessary prerequisite to any serious large-scale reuse
effort.

I guess if I wanted to waffle more, I could talk about small-scale reuse
and large-scale reuse.  Small-scale reuse I class as #defines, small
functions, etc that do something in a cool, or innovative way.  These
are found by examining the code, and have the greatest chance of being
reused.  Large-scale reuse I define as groups of functions, subsystems,
libraries of useful code.  Grouping smaller things into larger useful
things is harder, takes more effort, but of course reaps the greatest
rewards.  Much harder to identify from code, much easier to find from
documentation.  We could digress more into design patterns etc, but
we'll leave it there for now.

&gt; To conclude: there no doubt are many useful bits of code in both Mozilla
&gt; and GNOME, but don't assume that they will be easy to lift out.  I Have
&gt; seen none of Mozilla's code, but going on (extensive) past experience I
&gt; anticipate the effort to re-use to be larger than the effort to re-write.

I'm glad Linus decided to reuse GCC, and not write his own compiler
first.  I'm glad he didn't go further and write his own language first
and then the compiler.  I'm glad Brian Behlendorf (sp?) didn't write
apache from scratch. but started with the NCSA web server first.  And
there's plenty more examples.  "We stand on the shoulders on our
predecessors, not on their toes". (credit to someone in the open source
community)

And here comes the big contradiction.  It is said that none of the
original kernel exists in Linux anymore.  Apache has rewritten
everything at least once.  But, without reuse, these projects wouldn't
have happenned.  Indeed significant portions of the original
_architecture_ (interfaces?) remain in these projects, but bits can be
rewritten as the need arises, or even reused from other projects.  What
am I saying?  Different projects have different requirements.  And even
different requirements at different times.

Star Office has quality import filters that no-one has been able to
develop in the open-source community, so re-using them is worthwhile. 
Even if the code is krusty.  Mozilla has given us the gecko rendering
engine, which is being reused elsewhere already.  Even the Linix kernel
itself has been hacked and slashed into a much smaller and featureless
kernel and reused in embedded devices.

My summary is that reuse is important and an important factor in
reducing development effort.  It may result in less-than-optimal code,
but sometimes that's ok.

&gt; NB: Algorithm re-use is an entirely different story.  

True.  No disagreement there.  Algorithms are much easier to reuse.

Michael...

[1] -  I led a 120 KSLOC project with 80 KSLOC reused from another
project.  We completed development in 10 months with 4 programmers
including myself, including integration to custom hardware.  A lot of
fun, and it surprised me what we could achieve through code reuse.

[2] - but what's important?  Tight code or quick development schedule? 
Each project has different priorities, so sometimes you can live with
_some_ bloat, if that means satisfying the customer.

[3] - like &gt; 1000 lines of code.

[4] - along with hubris and impatience.  See the camel book, or Larry
Wall's talks available on-line for explanation.
