Evan, I think you make a very good point here- (yeah I kno not enuf but...).


Not everyone is a 'security guru' but alas these concerns are slowly being
forced on us due to the 'dark side' that awaits at the other end of the
dialup/cable/adsl/isdn connection.
While I am certainly not a guru on the subject, my job requires me to take a
lot more than a passing interest in the subject. As you could imagine, we do
get the odd scan in this business &lt;very major understatment&gt;.
Even if the average user on this list only has one or two boxes that are
connected at_any_time to the net then how far should you go with security?

ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING....and for those who didn't hear it the
first time......ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING

Most attacks are from pain-in-the-port script kiddies who just want to see
if they can hack/crash someone's box. Its the net's answer to vandals with
backward baseball caps and spraycans. They generally aren't interested in
your mp3/porn/recipes-from-mum/nuclear-bomb-plans/emails/research/study/etc.
They also don't care that it has taken you many hours to get all that stuff
together.

Go and buy a 486SX25 (monitor and HDD optional). This amazingly cheap
scenario will allow you to run something like www.freesco.org . What will
this do? Firewalling, NAT, web/print server, diald etc all from a floppy if
necessary.
Although there are a lot of single disk router projects out there, THIS ONE
IS EASY to set up for a novice.
OK, so we wouldn't hide our internet casino behind it but it will mean that
you aren't the easiest target in the pond anymore.

Maybe one of the people that currently use freesco or something similar
could give a demo at a meeting. It will open the eyes of the
'its-all-too-hard-I-don't-understand-about-ports-and-ipchains' people and
that includes almost any newbie and a lot of the older hands. I'd offer to
do it but someone'll have to pay for the airfare down from Alice &lt;grin&gt;.

Now that we all have some kind of condom on our connections, did anyone
remember to backup that data we just mentioned?
&lt;drops can opener and runs&gt;

my 2.2c, take it or leave it (gst paid)

Sorry Sam, I thru this back on the list.
I agree I am prol fairly safe as i am on for a matter of few hours at any
one time and Security thru obscurity has been my approach (yeah I kno not
enuf but...)
Anyway with the advent of ADSL etc, surely similar events such as Alan's
will start to happen more often.
I am hoping to get it and I do want to secure my side of things, I have a
box on the floor waiting to become a firewall, router and another source of
heat. But it all seems so hard.

Should this be another topic for a meeting "Readying for ADSL" or something
like that.

Sorry for the whining.

&gt;&gt; Isn't this enough to scare most users looking for alternative workstation
&gt;&gt; platforms back to microsoft. I know it became obvious shortly into

&gt;&gt; that I am way out of my depth and MS solutions seem so much simpler.
&gt;
&gt;Remember that simplicity is just that. If you want secure, don't go
&gt;looking for anything that is as simple as one click for security...also
&gt;keep in mind that I haven't yet come across a MS solution that is secure
&gt;without having to buy 3rd party software to correct security holes in the
&gt;MS software.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry, but there is obviously a lack of knowledge on my part and I doubt
&gt;&gt; I'm too different from a lot of naieve users.
&gt;
&gt;A.K. spends a lot of time concerning security, but one thing you also need
&gt;to understand is that Alan opted for the most insecure method of doing a
&gt;firewall: Default was to allow stuff in, then he blocks out stuff that he
&gt;thinks is a problem.
&gt;If you start from a deny everything perspective, then allow back in the
&gt;stuff that you want ppl to be able to get at, then you are MUCH better off
&gt;to begin with. My gateway/mail/dns server has only 4 ports open, and only
&gt;2 are accessable to the internet in general (DNS and SMTP)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Surely there is a NICE way of securing what you have to avoid these
&gt;&gt; exploits without resorting to archaic console commands. Or without the
need
&gt;&gt; for introducing a firewall box etc. 
&gt;
&gt;I'd start by working through /etc/inetd.conf, then set /etc/hosts.deny and
&gt;/etc/hosts.allow to batten down everything that you do not explicity
&gt;require.
&gt;If you are not on a permanent connection then you are fairly safe with
&gt;just the simplistic security above. On a 24x7 connection??? Then it is
&gt;well worth the effort getting a 486 as a firewall...I have had not one
&gt;person get into my system yet (I do the same as A.K. and keep tcpdump logs
&gt;of everything & also have tripwire running to check that noone screws with
&gt;my system.
&gt;
&gt;Or look on www.freshmeat.net under security tools for firewall scripts
&gt;that take care of lots of the yukky details. But make sure you check
&gt;carefully what they are doing!
&gt;
&gt;HTH,
&gt;
&gt;Sam!
