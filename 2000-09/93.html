Daryl et al:

&gt; No.  Why would you want to?  (If it's for reasons of security, then it's
&gt; not a good reason).

Because IANA has assigned 1080 to socks. socks has had a number of
serious security flaws. It's almost always scanned by someone who thinks
you are running it. But if a legitimate service such as a http request
happens to assign 1080 (despite the fact that there is about 63K other
ports to assign), and you have a firewall that blocks 1080...you have a
problem. So:

* do you allow socks in despite the security risk&gt;
* do you cope with a slight delay as HTTP realises it's not able to
communicate on port X?

Personally I think that IANA's allocation of ports above 1024 is rather
stupid.I might not want socks (1080) or X (default to 6000 plus) or
other stuff. But, they might be the ports http decides it wants to talk
to....which I've blocked....which I don't want to....

IT'S JUST CRAP RAY

I hate the Internet.
I wish people could trust one another.
