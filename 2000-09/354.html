&gt; I have a question about mirrored disks?
&gt; If you have mirrored disks and one of them fails for whatever reason,
&gt; what actually happens? How will you know one has failed? Will the
&gt; system keep running using the other disk?

If your talking about some type of software raid mirroring then a failure
will be indicated in the system logs or more effectively you can setup a
cron job checking for changes in /proc/mdstat. Any problems with the raid
setup show up in here. 

If one disk fails it will immediatly be removed from the mirror and the
remaining disk(s) will be used. The software raid also has the ability for
spare disks which take over and are rebuilt from the intact disks when one
fails. However, I believe that this is pointless and if your just going to
leave a disk spinning doing nothing it might as well be added into the
mirroring to increase read speeds. Sure it impacts write speeds but you
would then have say 3 disks so 1 failure still provides some reassurance.

If your interested in software raid realise that redhat kernels are
prepatched to support the new versions of raid. If you upgrade your kernel
manually you'll need to applie the patches from
<A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/.">http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/.</A> Of course the new kernels (2.4
series) have native support for raid 0,1,3,4,5. Just don't put a swap file
on a raid drive else you'll be sorry!

Cheers,
