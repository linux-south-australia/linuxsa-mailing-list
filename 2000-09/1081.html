Hi,

I have been investigating Network Mirroring for a project. I have looked at
ENBD and have discarded it as having too many problems. I was able to cause
it to hang when sending lots of IO over it:

   dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/nda bs=10240 count=10240

So, I will be looking at drbd during the week (I need some new drives, as
drbd wants to work with devices, while enbd will work with files or devices).

However, drbd seems to not support multpile connections, and thus multiple
ethernets for higher throughput.  This seems to leave channel bonding as
the only way to, say, double the underlying network's performance. 

I notice that RH 6.2 seems to have support for ifenslave and bonding.o, but
does anyone have any experience with it?

However, I have not yet checked whether or not this is worth while. Give
that a  well supported study reported in [1] claims:

  Throughput &lt;= ~0.7 * MSS / (rtt * sqrt(packet_loss))

It really depends on whether the packet loss is low, which it damn well
should be, and the rtt is low, which it should be again, in a system to
system 100BT link.
