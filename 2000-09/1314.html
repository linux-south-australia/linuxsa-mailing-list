<H1>Freesco Router Problems</H1>

Hi everyone,

Today installed a new freesco modem router in an office today, but I'm experiencing
a few problems with it. General web browsing/icq/real player/email etc all work
fine over all clients, however there are a few propriatary applications which
are causing me a few problems.

The first program which is not working properly reports the following error:


&lt;annoning message&gt;

Unable to establish your computer as an Internet server on TCP/IP address 203.166.244.97
Port Number 22038

The TCP/IP address 203.166.244.97 is invalid or already in use.

In order to run the workstation you will need to have a valid routable internet
TCP/IP address.

Inform your Internet Service Provider etc etc blah blah blah.

Make sure you have a Internet TCP/IP address for every computer you want to
link to the Internet.

&lt;/annoying message&gt;

The first thing I tried was adding the internal IP address of the computer using
the application and the port number to the Port Forwarding configuration file
... hoping for joy, i started the application up again, and it reports a different
port number. Everytime it reports a different number ranging between 21000 and
23000 so far.

Does anyone know any simple solutions to resolving this problem ?

The other application giving me problems is a windoze app which uses VPN. It
refuses to make any connection. Is there anything I have to do for virtual private
networking to work ?

The freesco router computer itself is a 486 66mhz 16mb ram 520mb hdd, and the
freesco software uses a linux kernel 2.0.38.

Would I be better off wiping all freesco off the system and load a proper linux
distro and manually configuring IP Masq to work with these applications ....
or is it impossible to even get these to work with IP Masq ???

Thanks in advance for any help,
Jeremy
