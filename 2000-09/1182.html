&gt; Depends who you're talking about. Why should my grandfather need to know
&gt; that MS word depends on VBRUN100.DLL and the MFC libraries version 7.3.2
&gt; or greater? What my Grandfather needs is stuff that works without him
&gt; thinking about it.

And in an ideal world perhaps he could find that stuff.  Stepping back from
fantasy for a minute, the reality is that the multitude of package managers
makes it very difficult for a software publisher to seamlessly support all
environments, with the result that one day your Grandfather is going to
find that his system no longer boots after installing some neat new software
that his brother sent him, and he'll have no clue why nor any experience to
fall back on to help him gain that clue.  Start as you mean to go on.  Do
you mean to start everyone off dumb?

&gt; Pretty much anyone for who System administration is not core business (or
&gt; a hobby) does not want to waste time (ie spend time unprofitably)
&gt; configuring their system...

We seem to have a fundamental difference of opinion here.  I don't agree
that configuring your system is a waste of time; and I held this view long
before I was every a professional system administrator.  Maybe I'm so good
at computers because I always took an active interest in mine.  More power
to me (literally.)
