&gt; BTW: X has some unintuitive terminology that is really important... you run
&gt; a program called an Xserver on your local machine, and you run Xclient
&gt; programs on a remote machine... often, the remote machine will be known as a
&gt; "server", and your local machine will be known as a "client", but with X, it
&gt; is the opposite way around -- the Xserver is providing the service of
&gt; allowing programs to display graphics. The Xclient program (xterm, netscape,
&gt; etc) is using this service to display things... all this can, of course
&gt; happen on one computer... :)

Right. The X server is providing a graphics service.
But also:

1.	The connection is initiated by the X client.
2.	There are generally many client processes for one
	X server process.

Both of these indicate that the X server is correctly named
as a server.
A server waits for connections. A client initiates a connection.
A server can handle numerous simultaneous connections.
Clients typically connect to one server at a time.

When you log in to a machine with telnet, things are around the
other way, of course [or ssh...].

In both cases, you might sit in front of one computer and
execute commands on the remote computer.
So in human terms, the client is the [computation] server.
But in protocol terms, the X server is clearly the server.

It's also important to think of client and server _processes_,
not computers. 
The client computer may be running a server process!!

Just a note in passing....

Alan Kennington.

PS. Yes it was a really canonical talk. 
Yet one more linux "top topic" covered.
There can't be many left to go.
I'll volunteer to give a Perl/Tk talk when all
the interesting linux topics have been covered.
