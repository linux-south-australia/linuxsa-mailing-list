There is :-)

Okay - some more information is in order. I've just got myself a very
froody dual head setup under XFree86 4.0.1. I would really love to have
VMware in full screen mode on one of the monitors.

But full screen mode in VMware wants to take over the whole X display,
so I can't use it's full screen option.

So, I figured I could start VMware in the right geometry so that the top
left of the virtual machine, excluding borders of the program, was at
0,0. Then, with the virtual machine at the same resolution as the
monitor, it would work fine!

But then I can't power off the VMware machine because I can't get the
mouse to the Power Off button!

Thus my desire to move a window about from the command line.

(I suppose I could also, rather than run a dual head system, just run
two X servers, one on each monitor and do it that way - but my looking
at X docos hasn't helped in that respect either).

If anyone has some ideas, please let me know!


Cheers,


Andrew Hill
