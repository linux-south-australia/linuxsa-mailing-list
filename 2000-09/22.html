Hi Jason,

&gt;
&gt; I think
&gt;
&gt; badblocks -o /mnt/floppy/hdabad /dev/hda 4000000
&gt; mke2fs -l /mnt/floppy/hdabad /dev/hda
&gt;
&gt; should do the trick.
&gt;
&gt;

Sorry?? - I thought you weren't sure whether badblocks worked??

In the RedHat installation (up to 6.0 anyway) there is an option to check for
badblocks when formatting ones partitions. I assumed that this used the badblock
program and wrote the output to a file which could be used by the filesystem to
prevent the writing of data to those blocks flagged as _bad_.

Well this didn't work for me! The bad blocks were certainly detected but data was
written to them anyway as the installation progressed. I spent many hours running fsck
on these partitions to try and correct them after my computer would freeze up
(especially if I did a find / -name &lt;filename&gt; - of course!)

Hence my disillusionment with this program.

As much as I despise MS and everything it stands for, scandisk always seemed to work
for me.

Regards,
Michael
