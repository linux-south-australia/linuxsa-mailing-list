Michael et al:

&gt; Richard, have you had a look at the new firewall stuff in 2.4 ? I hear
&gt; that it is changing (yet again), and was wondering if it is any easier
&gt; than the current setup which I find mind-numbing at best.

It's possible - even probable - that a recoded ipchains will be
available under 2.4. So I'm not altogether sure that we're going to be
able to avoid the "mind-numbing" ipchains syntax in the near future.
Nonetheless the new features supported by 2.4 will be a welcome addition
to our security toolkit.

&gt; I use gfcc to check my firewall which is put in place with pmfirewall.pl,
&gt; and which seems to work ok, but I have trouble verifying the firewall
&gt; rules are doing what I want just by looking at them.

ipchains rules have a hideous tendency to look like spaghetti code,
nonetheless they aren't that difficult to decode. One way to decode the
rules is to NOT look at the rules themselves, and execute the following:

* start the computer
* run the rules/firewall
* run ipchains -L &gt; log
* less log

Personally I find this way a lot more understandable.

&gt; Probably, I need to spend more time on it, but not understanding the 3
&gt; firewall classes of input forward and output is probably the core of my
&gt; problem.

If you don't understand input, forward and output then it is a problem
:-P
