George!

&gt; David, Stop provoking trouble :)

It may interest you that I _almost_  scored a contract to install Linux
in a rather large medical centre about 3 to 4 months ago. It would have
been fine except the head of the centre - in a very unexpected move -
actually gave up his respectable PIII so Windows NT 4.0 SP6 would
actually run respectably as a gateway!

Given that you hav e-mailed two Davids, but I am the primary address, I
presume that the "provoking trouble"  is aimed at me. I am now
absolutely convinced that some members of this list have no sense of
humour, but do know a little bit about Linux.

Let me teach you one thing: if you work with computers you must keep
some sense of humour. It helps to keep one sane. It helps to relabel
programing errors as bugs. It helps if you actually work out whether the
person on the other end of the e-mail is bein serious, half hearted or
even funny.

Furthermore, the way to provoke trouble when someone _may_ be trolling
for an interesting discussion is to continue the discussion. I was not
trolling for an interesting discussion, but now you've mentioned...

My words fail, yet I know that you are with me
My moon, upon my soul you still shine
My sun, it is you I still see...
