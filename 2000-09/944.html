&gt;Are you arguing that teachers with little or no computing experience
&gt;are in fact qualified to teach computing?


oh dear god no. but a great deal of them still get away with it ...

.... from when I was in school, there were teachrs who were absoultely
fantastic bs'ers, they managed to make it sound like what they were talking
about was actually true or correct. Others could read quite fluently from
text books ... on the odd occasion some of them used to ad-lib a little, but
of course my all time favourites are the teachers would call the computer
towers or desktop cases (of course containing all the contents of the
system, cdrom, fdd, m/b, etc etc etc) the "cpu" :-)
