&gt; 
&gt; I have some comments on this.
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, as Mark Newton has said, have a look at the various articles on
&gt; Buffer Overflows. A long stream on 0x90 is a signature of one type of
&gt; buffer overflow, as they are NOPs in the Intel x86 architecture. Of course,
&gt; they do not have to have 0x90s on the front.  A long stream of A's is a
&gt; probe to find out where the buffer begins on the stack and the distance to
&gt; the return address.

Richard,

Thanks for the reply.
I don't know if I have the time to study security any more.
I estimate I've lavished 4000 hours already on setting up this
little network on the Internet, which wouldn't hav been necessary if
I had a dial-up service.
So personally I wouldn't recommend that anyone connect their
computers to the net 24 hours a day, unless they want a continuous
education in security.

I told myself that I would follow a liberal philosophy of security
(only lock thsoe things which seem vulnerable) until the first
serious attack, which has now happened, and _then_ I would follow
a conservative philosophy - namely lock down everything, and only
permit through what is absolutely necessary.

Now is the time for me to lock down everything.
I think what I should do is buy a new firewall machine and
load up more modern software on it - _but_ that is going to cost
me more valuable time.

For me, security is pure overheads.
For some other people on this list, it's a source of income.
With a clientele of one user (me), it isn't worth my while to
spend heaps more time on security.

&gt; The main purpose of this style of attack is to get a root shell, and then
&gt; do more. Of course, with such a root shell, you are typing blind, but
&gt; people will construct programs to carry out the full attack.

The sequence of the attack was:

1.	Break into the pop2 server to get a "nobody" shell.
2.	Use this shell to download "rootcron.sh" by FTP.
3.	Get a "root" shell by running this script.

This means that not only was the old pop2 server on "rat" vulnerable,
it also means that anyone who can get a "nobody" shell on redhat 5.2 can
also get a "root" shell.
Therefore if you give a user any kind of shell on redhat 5.2 (with default stuff),
then you might as well give them a root shell too.

&gt; Secondly, what you have told us can be described as a comedy of errors. No
&gt; only were .rhosts in use, and services were running that just should not
&gt; have been running (pop2), you were not using IPchains to stop people from
&gt; getting to possibly vulnerable services from the Internet. Were you running
&gt; the stock standard named on that machine as well? If so, it runs as root
&gt; and has a known buffer overflow script out there (t666.c).

In no situation did they use any .rhosts file.
They didn't get around to that.

The machine "rat" was purchased about 4 years ago.
At that time, I tried sticking various linux OSs on it, and
finally came up with redhat 4.2 or something, and upgraded this
later to 5.2. 
I had so much difficulty trying to get the absolute basics of this
system working, I didn't think about security much, and it wasn't
originally on the wide open net.
I'm getting better at setting up machines to be less vulnerable.
But with 7 machines to manage, it's seriously tedious work.

As to ipchains, I use another redhat 5.2 machine for the firewall,
but only ipfwadm was available at that time.
Since it's on the net 24 hours/day, I can't just spend a day
re-installing the OS and doing all the new config stuff.
And I haven't had the time to learn the command set of ipchains yet.
The ipfwadm does block port 110.

&gt; My advice in all these cases is defence in depth:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. ipchains to block all ports from outside and then open up only the
&gt;    essential ports:

Okay.
More security homework for me again. Overheads, overheads!
This conservative dogma is repeated at least 3 times a week on
this newsgroup. I think the Romans used to say "crambe repetita".

&gt; 2. Remove everything you don't understand from /etc/inetd.conf. Well,
&gt;    comment it out.
&gt; 
&gt;    Hmmm, you don't understand anything in there? Well, you are vulnerable,
&gt;    and maybe you should purchase some skills from someone.

Actually I understand it all.
I've been managing unix boxes for 12 years.
The trouble is that new vulnerabilities are being continuously added.
Once again, it's lack of time.
No one's paying me $100 an hour to do this.
I'm _losing_ $100 per hour by doing this security work.
Now I've gone through and ripped out the rubbish from my inetd.conf
files and HUPped inetd.conf.

&gt; 3. Switch off all services you don't understand. See comments from above.

Some services which are not generally understood are actually essential.
I think you're talking about the stuff in /etc/rc.d/*/
I'm not going to rip out heaps of those scripts unless I _do_
undestand what I'm deleting.

&gt; 4. Update to the latest version all servers you allow outside access to to.
&gt;    Consider running them as a non-root user and inside a chroot jail. 
&gt;    However, be aware that the latest buffer overflow techniques involve
&gt;    breaking out of a Linux chroot jail. 

Now we're getting into serious overheads.
And also note that when I "upgraded" from redhat 4.2 to 5.2 or something,
the "rat" computer seems to have inherited the old bad inetd.conf file.
I.e it may have been the "upgrading" itself that was responsible.

My philosophy has been to have a good firewall machine, and then all the
computers can live safely behind that.
You may put locks on the doors and windows of your house.
But do you want deadlocks between every room inside the house?
Denying services to the crims also means denying them to yourself sometimes.

&gt;    You might want to consider FreeBSD if you want more security in this area.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, there is a spectrum here, with convenience at one end, which
&gt; means little or no security, and security at the other end, which means
&gt; little or no usability.

There's also the time and energy overheads.
If I'm going to learn BSD now too, when am I going to find the
time to make a living.
I'm going to end up a very poor, very knowledgeable person,
and then I'll have to sell all the computers to buy food.

I think the trade-off is security versus productivity,
unless security is all you produce.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
