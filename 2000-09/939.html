&gt;People with little -- and especially people with no -- computer experience
&gt;probably aren't qualified to teach computing. 

In an education department school, many teachers who DO have qualifications
aren't gonna last long there. If you look at it, if there is a highly qualified
IT person working as a school teacher in a public education department school,
the likelyhood is, they will be assigned the role of "Network Administer / General
Computer Person" as an effort to save on having to employ someone to do it full
time. Once they have this role, they are going to double their IT knowledege,
and probably will meet other IT professionals doing the same thing in industry
... and they'll probably learn that those people are earning up to 3, 4 , 5
.. maybe 6 times as much as them, hence leaving them to wanna GET OUT of the
public education system into a higher paying job. When I was at school, the
only IT teacher I had that knew what he was doing ... did just this !

... for the highly qualified IT people in schools (of course excluding dedicated
sysadmins), they normally really really have to love their job of teaching kids
to stay there ...
