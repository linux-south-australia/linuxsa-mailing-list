&gt;Someone cracked my linux 5.2 machine on 5 July 2000!!!!

I have some comments on this.

Firstly, as Mark Newton has said, have a look at the various articles on
Buffer Overflows. A long stream on 0x90 is a signature of one type of
buffer overflow, as they are NOPs in the Intel x86 architecture. Of course,
they do not have to have 0x90s on the front.  A long stream of A's is a
probe to find out where the buffer begins on the stack and the distance to
the return address.

The main purpose of this style of attack is to get a root shell, and then
do more. Of course, with such a root shell, you are typing blind, but
people will construct programs to carry out the full attack.

Secondly, what you have told us can be described as a comedy of errors. No
only were .rhosts in use, and services were running that just should not
have been running (pop2), you were not using IPchains to stop people from
getting to possibly vulnerable services from the Internet. Were you running
the stock standard named on that machine as well? If so, it runs as root
and has a known buffer overflow script out there (t666.c).

My advice in all these cases is defence in depth:

1. ipchains to block all ports from outside and then open up only the
   essential ports:

   INT=&lt;your internal interface&gt;
   EXT=&lt;your external interface&gt;
   ipchains -P input REJECT  # Or DENY if you prefer
   ipchains -A input -i INT -j ACCEPT # Allow access from inside
   ipchains -A input -i lo -j ACCEPT  # And the loopback int for squid, etc
   ipchains -A input -p tcp -d &lt;my-ip&gt; 80 -j ACCEPT # Allow WWW

   And add the few extra rules for the protocols you need, including DNS 
   (53 udp and tcp for zone transfers), SMTP, SSH, etc.

   You might also need:

   ipchains -A input -p tcp ! -y -j ACCEPT # or something like it.

   Check the IPchains howto and other resources. 

2. Remove everything you don't understand from /etc/inetd.conf. Well,
   comment it out.

   Hmmm, you don't understand anything in there? Well, you are vulnerable,
   and maybe you should purchase some skills from someone.

   Of course, to a certain extent you are protected by 1 above, but it won't
   hurt to be paranoid.

3. Switch off all services you don't understand. See comments from above.

4. Update to the latest version all servers you allow outside access to to.
   Consider running them as a non-root user and inside a chroot jail. 
   However, be aware that the latest buffer overflow techniques involve
   breaking out of a Linux chroot jail. 

   You might want to consider FreeBSD if you want more security in this area.

Remember, there is a spectrum here, with convenience at one end, which
means little or no security, and security at the other end, which means
little or no usability.
