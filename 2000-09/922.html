&gt;Firstly, a big thanks goes to Geoffrey for an enjoyable
&gt;and informative talk on ssh last night.

indeed

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;Question 1
&gt;==========
&gt;If "A" is a RH6.2 box and "B" is a (dare I say it on
&gt;this list) NT box, and I want to access "A" from "B".
&gt;
&gt;Is "A" classified as the server, and if so do I install
&gt;the ssh-server on this machine...I seemed to remember
&gt;from last night that it was the other way around.

a server is a thing that provides a service, and a client is a thing that
uses a service... A is providing the service of allowing ssh logins, B is
using that service. There is no reason why A can't also be a client, and B
can't also be a server (except that I don't think sshd runs on NT...) as
well... It's actually easier if you think in terms of programs rather than
machines... A is running sshd, which is the server daemon... B is running
ssh (or putty), which is the client program... ssh (Putty) allows you to log
in to something running sshd. A could also run ssh, and connect to C, which
is running sshd... Who's on first? No, Who's on Second... it's a tad
confusing, but when you get this, it will all be clear...

BTW: X has some unintuitive terminology that is really important... you run
a program called an Xserver on your local machine, and you run Xclient
programs on a remote machine... often, the remote machine will be known as a
"server", and your local machine will be known as a "client", but with X, it
is the opposite way around -- the Xserver is providing the service of
allowing programs to display graphics. The Xclient program (xterm, netscape,
etc) is using this service to display things... all this can, of course
happen on one computer... :)

basically, think of client and server as terms that apply to individual
programs instead of machines... a Server machine is loosely one that runs a
lot of server programs (apache, sshd, etc)... It gets more complicated when
you talk about a compute server, where it is providing the "service" to
people of allowing them to run programs on it... these programs could be
clients to a local Xserver as well :) To make it more complex again, it is
quite possible for one program to act in the role of both client and server
:)

&gt;
&gt;Question 2
&gt;==========
&gt;I'm comfortable with the concepts of remote administration
&gt;on the same network, but how do I achieve it if I am
&gt;off-site?

depends what access you can get to the machines...

&gt;
&gt;Question 3
&gt;==========
&gt;If on the RH6.2 box I am running Samba, which is allowing
&gt;the NT box access to shares, would it be better for the
&gt;related traffic to be encrypted. If so, how?

quite likely better, but I don't know anything about samba or SMB, so I
wouldn't really know :)
