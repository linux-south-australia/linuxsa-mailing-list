Hi David,

David Rowlands &lt;<A HREF="mailto:davidr@empower.com.au">davidr@empower.com.au</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt; It's my understanding from what NDC people have been telling me,

Can you please tell me who at NDC is telling you this so I can
point them towards the right information instead of this quite
completely incorrect statement rectified?

&gt; is that the ADSL "stuff" being installed by Alcatel in the
&gt; exchanges is for Big Pond Advance only.  If other ISP's want
&gt; to use ADSL, they have to install their own hardware. Now,
&gt; this hardware could be the ADSL stuff, or the connections
&gt; from the ADSL box to their own network, they didn't say which.

This is, as they say, "bollocks!".

For a start, Telstra DO wholesale access to this infrastructure,
it is Telstra's preferred method for letting competitors access
the local loop and provide ADSL - even though the ACCC declared
the unbundled local loop over a year ago.

&lt;rant&gt;

Telstra (through a lack of foresight by our Government) own the
copper in the ground between your house and the exchange.

Over the past 2-3 years, Telstra, for what appears to be quite
legitimate reasons, have been installing line sharing devices
in suburban areas to service new or second phone line customers
instead of running new copper back to the local exchange.

These devices range from simple "Pairgain" systems through "Remote
Integrated Multiplexors (RIMs)" to newer CMUX equipment of which
the RIMs and CMUXes are linked back to the exchange via fibre optics.

Telstra's reported reason for doing this was of course shareholder
driven in order to provide the best value for their investment dollar,
ie: it was supposed to be a money saving exercise (cheaper to run one
fibre than 100's of copper pairs to a street corner).

Now here's the nasty bit - RIMs and CMUXes are typically located
underground in a street near the area that they service.  There are
no buildings, just sealed boxes in the dirt with power, fibre and
a copper run to the nearest street pillar(s).

Coincidentally, the RIM and CMUX units are supplied by Alcatel, who
of course now have ADSL and ISDN upgradable cards for these devices
instead of just POTS (plain old telephone service).

So now Telstra can now magically offer ADSL as soon as they either
(a) upgrade the CMUX/RIM or (b) put a DSLAM in the exchange area
concerned.

For the most part, Telstra have been doing these upgrades for the
last two years, all the while arguing that *DSL was not something
they could let anyone do without rigourous testing in their LAB
first, yet Telstra themselves had been trialing equipment from
many vendors for years.

Over a year ago the ACCC declared "unbundled local loop" (ie: the
last mile copper from the home to the nearest Telstra demarc point,
usually the local exchange, but also now the CMUX and/or RIM) as
being available to other carriers so that they could compete for
services such as ADSL (among other things).

For some areas, this is easy - a competing carrier simply asks for
physical rack space in the exchange to locate DSL access equipment,
and gets the copper pairs punched across to their rack for each of
the households they wish to service.

Sounds easy, right?

Well, apart from the fact that access to exchanges is extremely hard
to get in terms of the legal paperwork alone (and the space is not
available in most areas anyway), a significant majority of the last
mile leadins to houses *don't* go back all the way to the exchange.

They go to a nearby RIM or CMUX - which means the competing carrier
has to dig a hole in the ground near the pillar, fight the local
council for permission to do so first, run fibre to it from their
nearest POP, get power connected to it, and hope like heck there's
enough room in the street pillar to accommodate a cross connect cable.

No, the competing carrier cannot put their own equipment inside the
CMUX or RIM, those devices are Telstra's property - can't be touched.

So as you can imagine, the only carriers who are doing ULL access
are the likes of Optus (through their wholesale subsidiary XYZed)
or any other large cashed-up telco's.  (ie: I think at most 3 to
date, but they're at least a year behind Telstra in rollout terms).

So that leaves one other option for the medium-to-large ISP to be
able to compete - to buy wholesale access from Telstra.

That, my friends, is another nightmare entirely.

So much for competitive access to the last mile, eh?  Thanks ACCC.

&lt;/rant&gt;

Cheers

Leigh
