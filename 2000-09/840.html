&gt; I have blown-away^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hupgraded my laptop to RH6.2, and
&gt; am having some problems with suspending.
&gt;
&gt; APM seems to work, and if I am in console mode I can suspend to disk using
&gt; the FnSuspend key (Fn-Esc) as well as 'apm --suspend', and when I power the
&gt; system back on, it resumes.

Actually Fn-Esc is suspending to RAM, not disk.  To go to disk you need Fn-a. 
This is undocumented.

&gt; However, in X mode, if I try to suspend, the laptop simply hangs.

Known problem with the ATI Rage Mobility 128 chipset.  There is a patched 3.3.6
XFree86 available indirectly from various people via the Linux laptop web page,
but as I dislike running software built by Joe Bloggs, I don't use it.

Instead I switch to a console and Fn-a from there.

&gt; Secondly, it seems that even though suspend in console mode works, X seems
&gt; to lose sight of who has access, and when I go back to X after a resume
&gt; (Alt-F7), I cannot run any new X-based apps, which all complain that the
&gt; X-server would not allow them to connect.

This I haven't seen and I'm using RH6.2 on a Dell I5K (just the same but less
weight and less expandibility).  I'd suggest going to
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/</A> and bouncing to one of the
I5k/I7K pages and finding someone who has done it all before.  And it's likely
there will be, lots of Linux people like the Inspiron.

&gt; Has anyone seen this? Any ideas on a solution? I do have a suspend
&gt; partition defined.

As long as your suspend partition is slightly larger than available RAM (for
sufficiently large values of 'slightly') everything works.  At least for me.
