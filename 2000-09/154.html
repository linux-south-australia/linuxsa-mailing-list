&gt;&gt; It's always a resource tradeoff issue.

&gt; ROFL.  Checking a source IP address costs 32 table lookups in the
&gt; worst case, three in the average case.  So it actually saves routing
&gt; resources, as subsequent routers don't have to forward the packet.

I meant from a CPU point of view.  I've just had to put a filter
on a FDDI interface (all port 80 traffic to a specific IP address)
and the additional load is noticeable.  Mind you, the router is
probably now underspec'd for that interface ...

&gt; Cisco and clueless or lazy ISPs.  Cisco is under siginficant pressure
&gt; to alter their default.

Their default doesn't do _anything_.  "no ip routing", from memory.
I guess they're doing the old "once you configure it, it's your
responsibility" trick.

&gt; The Australian Governement is likely to
&gt; sponsor the development of a Technical Standard for Carriage Service
&gt; Providers that forces them to check source IP addresses.

This would be good.

&gt; Not so, most other vendors have changed defaults in recent software
&gt; releases.

This too is good.

Actually, I've been entertaining this idle thought lately - if
there's money to be made in hardware, why not build a router
where the OS is open sourced?  I seem to remember at some stage
that you had a passion for ASIC Ethernet switches - did anything
ever come of that?

&gt;  The revolution will not be televised, it will be digitised

Can I get it homogenized and pasteurized?
