&gt; ENTER BLACKBOX
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; All window managers have their faults, nothing is
&gt; perfect after all. But for simplicity and speed (as
&gt; well as stability) you can't go past BlackBox. OK so
&gt; it's not so well documented, and alt-tab doesn't seem
&gt; to work, but hey it's open sourced after all. But the

Key-bindings were removed from Blackbox ever since the 0.60.x
alphas.  Blackbox aims to me completely ICCM complient, and since
key-bindings are not specified, it does not support them.  However, there
is an excellent little program called 'bbkeys' that handles not only what
blackbox used to, but much more.  It even has a nice Qt config tool.  Grab
it from <A HREF="http://movingparts.thelinuxcommunity.org/bbkeys.shtml.">http://movingparts.thelinuxcommunity.org/bbkeys.shtml.</A>

You can get the rest of the bbtools from
<A HREF="http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org.">http://bbtools.thelinuxcommunity.org.</A>  There are some very useful
applications here, including a pager.  They make blackbox a very
comfortable working environment.


&gt; best of all is that the tar ball of the source is
&gt; under 300kb. I cannot tell a lie, it is true BlackBox
&gt; is Tiny. It even comes with some simple themes; which

There are lots more over at <A HREF="http://bb.themes.org.">http://bb.themes.org.</A>  A guy called Artwiz has
created a lot of very classy themes, and you can grab them directly from 
<A HREF="http://artramp.org/artwiz/themes.phtml.">http://artramp.org/artwiz/themes.phtml.</A>


&gt; don't over power the screen. BlackBox is also easy to
&gt; install...Well sort of, you may need to manually move
&gt; things around and you have to manually edit the menu
&gt; file. So maybe if you are a newbie you should continue
&gt; with KDE for a while longer.

Not anymore.  Blackbox(1) has a very detailed (but simple and easy to
understand) man page.  It describes the simple syntax used in the menu
file, the format of the .blackboxrc file (most of which can be configured
from the run-time config menu anyway), and the resources used in the style
files.

&gt; WHERE TO NOW
&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~
&gt; 
&gt; If you use Linux, it's because you like to experiment,

Or FreeBSD, the platform that Blackbox is developed on =)  Yeah, you could
use Solaris or any other of the Unices too (I'm quite sure).

&gt; lets face it that's what it's all about, so what do
&gt; you have to lose from giving BlackBox a go? 
&gt; 
&gt; Point lynx or the other browser to
&gt; <A HREF="http://blackbox.alug.org/">http://blackbox.alug.org/</A> and see for your self how
&gt; UN-bloated software really needs to be. 

Don't grab the 'stable' version.  It is VERY old.  The latest version is
0.61.0 and it is labelled as 'beta.'  Don't let this fool you, I run
Blackbox the entire time my PC is on (about 12-15 hours / day), and have
been for the last year or so, and it has never once crashed on me.

I hope I have cleared up some of the confusing issues concerning this
wonderful window manager.

Cheers,
