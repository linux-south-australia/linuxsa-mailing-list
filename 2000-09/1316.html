Jeremy!

&gt; In order to run the workstation you will need to have a valid routable internet
&gt; TCP/IP address.

If you run behind a firewall using ipchains or ipfwadm, unless there is
a special module loaded the outside world generally cannot validly route
or send packets directly back to a machine sitting behind the firewall.
Classic services that die include ICQ, IRC and FTP; all of these have
modules to fool the outside servers that there is a real, valid routable
internet TCP/IP address.

&gt; port number. Everytime it reports a different number ranging between 21000 and
&gt; 23000 so far.

Probably because it's got some algorithm that picks ports between 21000
and 23000.

&gt; Does anyone know any simple solutions to resolving this problem ?

Solutions can vary. You can, as you say below, chuck freesco and install
a real Linux. Rather than using ipchains' forwarding rules, you could
try using ipmasqadm (I think) to perform proper NAT (Network Address
Translation) which may fix your problem.

&gt; Would I be better off wiping all freesco off the system and load a proper linux
&gt; distro and manually configuring IP Masq to work with these applications ....
&gt; or is it impossible to even get these to work with IP Masq ???

If you need to do something unusual then freesco may not cut the chase.
Do these software thingos have a support line?
