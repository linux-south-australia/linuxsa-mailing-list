Hi!

As you know I've been having rather amazing problems with an STT-20000N
Travan drive. The [amanda] list has said that they use these drives
quite successfully, so we dutifully did the following:

* checked the termination settings
 - they were correct

* changed computers
 - this improved things a little bit

* added a "dumb" terminating device
 - decided that the tapes terminators weren't behaving themselves, so I
took a device that I *knew* could terminate and made it the end device

* changed SCSI cards

One of the people I work with somehow discovered that the tape drive and
tapes overheat (yes, overheat) when being written to constantly. The
tapes appear to become so hot they simply cease to function (or the
drive ceases to function or both). When we let things cool down, it goes
back to normal.

Has anyone noticed this in this particular tape drive, or for that
matter any other tape drive?

AMANDA is able to stream to tape constantly once our backups start to
occur. I guess, a rather kludgy solution, would be to set AMANDA such
that the tape didn't stream constantly (eg, limit the bandwidth to
something ridiculously low etc etc)....

Any comments?
