&gt;&gt; I have a question about mirrored disks?
&gt;&gt; If you have mirrored disks and one of them fails for whatever reason,
&gt;&gt; what actually happens? How will you know one has failed? Will the
&gt;&gt; system keep running using the other disk?
&gt;
&gt;If your talking about some type of software raid mirroring then a failure
&gt;will be indicated in the system logs or more effectively you can setup a
&gt;cron job checking for changes in /proc/mdstat. Any problems with the raid
&gt;setup show up in here. 
&gt;
&gt;If one disk fails it will immediatly be removed from the mirror and the
&gt;remaining disk(s) will be used. The software raid also has the ability for
&gt;spare disks which take over and are rebuilt from the intact disks when one
&gt;fails. However, I believe that this is pointless and if your just going to
&gt;leave a disk spinning doing nothing it might as well be added into the
&gt;mirroring to increase read speeds. Sure it impacts write speeds but you
&gt;would then have say 3 disks so 1 failure still provides some reassurance.
&gt;
&gt;If your interested in software raid realise that redhat kernels are
&gt;prepatched to support the new versions of raid. If you upgrade your kernel
&gt;manually you'll need to applie the patches from
&gt;<A HREF="http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/.">http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/.</A> Of course the new kernels (2.4
&gt;series) have native support for raid 0,1,3,4,5. Just don't put a swap file
&gt;on a raid drive else you'll be sorry!

Hmmm, please expand on this thought.

I have seen people do it on big-iron machines, and they cited some
advantages, like, even the swap file had redundency.

&gt;Cheers,
