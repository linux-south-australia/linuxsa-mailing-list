SSH not 100% reliable!!

Once again, I find that "sshd" can just lock up and
refuse to accept connections. Here are the symptoms on
the client side when I try to use "scp":

===========================================
Could not create pipes: Too many open files
lost connection
===========================================

And here's what the server "sshd" produces in the log <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

===========================================
Sep 19 05:02:46 dog sshd[18963]: log: Connection from 203.38.148.52 port 2464
Sep 19 05:02:48 dog sshd[18963]: log: RSA authentication for akenning accepted.
Sep 19 05:02:48 dog PAM_pwdb[18963]: (sshd) session opened for user akenning by (uid=0)
Sep 19 05:02:48 dog sshd[18963]: fatal: Local: Could not create pipes: Too many open files
Sep 19 05:02:48 dog PAM_pwdb[18963]: (sshd) session closed for user akenning 
===========================================

I tried killing off child processes of the "sshd" process.
But that didn't help.
If I kill the parent process, I lose the connection.
And then, of course, I can't get into the machine any more.

I've checked the man-manuals for sshd and scp. No clues there.
Maybe I have to read the source.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Moral of story:

If you rely on "ssh" as your only way to log in to a machine,
then you risk losing all contact.
E.g. if you're overseas, you can lose contact until you return home.
This happened to me once, but luckily I had another machine on
the same LAN which also had sshd. So I logged in to that one and
used the nefarious "rsh" to get back in and restart "sshd".

The OpenSSH software is clearly not yet at the level of reliability
that you would want to place too much trust in it.
Then again, I use it with "scp" maybe 50 times a day.
Eventually, it seems that the process just acquires too many
open files.

Is there some way I can list the files opened by a process?
I can't find this in the "fuser" and "ps" manuals.
Aha. Found it. It's in the file /proc/1286/fd for process 1286.

Hmmm. 24 open files. Is that too many? Contents of /proc/1286/fd:

While checking this all out, the main sshd process crashed but left
a few child processes (one of which I am using to write this note).
But none of these child processes reponds to new login attempts.

"man getdtablesize" says I can have 256 open file descriptors.
So where's the problem?
Maybe the now-dead sshd process had 256 descriptors open.
Too late to check now.
It seems believable at 50 accesses a day for 5 days.

Well, now I've re-started "sshd" on the machine in question.
And everything's back to normal. But if I had killed the old
process, I think it would have killed all connections.
So one must wait until it dies by itself.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Moral 2:
Always keep a spare key!
I almost removed the "login" service on the machine in question.
Lucky I thought about it longer than 2 seconds.
So much for removing all services!!!

Moral 3:
When analysing security of systems, one has to look at all possible
(or credible) failure modes, not just the technically exciting ones
like eavesdroppers on the net. 
E.g. ssh daemon software can crash or malfunction.
Passwords can be forgotten.
Etc. etc. etc.
You have to look at the whole network of system states,
estimate probablities of all transitions, etc. etc. etc.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Please don't tell me that I have to get the latest
version of OpenSSH. 
Do you really think there's something magic about
last week's release?
New releases fix old bugs and introduce new ones!
