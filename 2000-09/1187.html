  DL&gt; Bruce, package management under any OS is essentially lame. 

This is one of the dumbest things I've read on this list lately.  I don't know
what goes on inside the heads of David Lloyd and David Newall to make them think
that their opinion is _fact_.  This sort of post mis-uses a position of
``authority'' to influence those who are not in a position to know better.

If Mandrake has tried to copy Debian's excellent menu system, and they've
stuffed it up, that does not mean all package managers are lame.

In my opinion, package management is the _one_ thing that can make Unix
available to the masses.  Or do you want micro$oft to have the only system that
the average luser can install?

  &lt;snip&gt;

  DL&gt; By definition package management devolves some part of the system
  DL&gt; administration schema from the system administrator. People from all camps
  DL&gt; - RedHat (who have, to my knowledge never claimed their RPM's to be the
  DL&gt; panacea for the masses, or to update automatically or any other such
  DL&gt; crap), dpkg (Debian Package Manager - updater behind your back
  DL&gt; extraordinaire) - have to release some semblance of control from their
  DL&gt; system.

dpkg does not update packages behind your back.  It runs, like every other
program, when _told_ to run.  It does not clobber configuration files.  It
provides me with the latest packages, maintaining optimal security without the
need to closely monitor comp.security.* - all with one or two commands.  Without
it, administration would be so much more time consuming.

  DL&gt; This is good provided you know the packages you are installing, have
  DL&gt; checked they work and will behave themselves.

That's why Debian has a stable distribution.  Other people check that they work
for you.

  DL&gt; In the real world, in one of my work situations, we implement ALL software
  DL&gt; like this:

  DL&gt; * a need arises * a suggestion appears * we TEST that suggestion against
  DL&gt; numerous tests * we put it into "beta test": * then we put it into
  DL&gt; production

Big deal.  Assume you have a need to upgrade an application on a "debian"
network.  Run "apt-get install application" on a test machine.  Check it out,
and if satisfactory, install it in a few seconds across your network.  If not,
revert to the older version with a simple command.  What's the difference?

&lt;remaining hyperbole snipped&gt;

If Alan Kennington had used dpkg a few times he would not be having so much
trouble with sooo many things.

And if you don't already know that emacs is better than vi, you're just stupid.
