Dan!

&gt; Hi, I'm experiencing a significant reduction in data rate through my
&gt; modem.

I assume that you are dialing into your network and not using ssh over
the internet (or telnet even) through a third party.

&gt; I think this is a result of packet loss (I'm losing ~30-50% of
&gt; packets to local network hosts at the university network - I can't test
&gt; what kind of loss I would get within the network between machines
&gt; excluding mine so I can't give a comparison here).

Try letting a "ping" to various parts of the network go for a
significant amount of time (5 minutes or more) and see what type of
packet loss that ping reports. Someone may also be able to enlighten you
(or the man pages may be detailed enough) to tell you what the output of
"ifconfig" is saying - I believe that if you understand the parameters
returned it's quite informative.

&gt; submitted in a telnet session under linux (frustrating as you can
&gt; imagine). I'm afraid I don't know where to start looking; can anyone
&gt; point me to areas that might be worth looking at? My system is a PPC Red
&gt; Hat port (Yellowdog)&gt;

There must be a Yellowdog mailing list or FAQ site. It may be worthwhile
talking to them as well as us; I know there are a number of Macintosh
Linux users on the list but there would be many more on one dedicated to
that.

I'm not certain I can be of more help...
