If we do a web site for the event, I would be happy to arrange hosting of
it, and possibly some of the design of it.

If this were to happen it would be worth having a registration of interest
form so we can have a rough idea of how many people are likely to turn up.
There's no point allowing for 1000+ people if 10 are going to turn up and
vice versa.

I think the idea on the whole has a lot of merit, and it may be worth while
starting to set-up a working group for this.

If other people agree that setting up a working group would be worthwhile
can you please e-mail me at <A HREF="mailto:installfest-wg@loony.net.au">installfest-wg@loony.net.au</A> and I will start
keeping track of how many people are interested in perhaps helping out.

I guess this is me saying I'm happy to help start arranging things if there
are other people willing to help as well.

If I get more than about 10 people interested in setting up some kind of
working group I am happy to change the address I listed above to a mailing
list.  Alternatively if anyone thinks there is a better way of doing this
I'm open to ideas

&gt; &gt; I would tend to make it during school holidays (get the kiddies while
&gt; &gt; they're young), I'd also tend to give a months notice, if not
&gt; more, this way
&gt; &gt; it would be possible for some smart cookie to issue a
&gt; press-release to all
&gt; &gt; the major computer magazines.
&gt;
&gt; These are good ideas. I have a few of my own to add.
&gt;
&gt; - To avoid conflict with different state's holidays etc and to ensure the
&gt; event is held on a weekend, perhaps we could assign "the first
&gt; (second.. or whatever) Saturday in August" and promote the actual
&gt; "date" from there. For example, August 26 is a Sunday next year but is a
&gt; Monday in 2K2.
&gt;
&gt; - We will need to assign and plan it months in advance. Computer magazines
&gt; (and I imagine other forms of print media) work one or two months in
&gt; advance. if a national install day was decided upon and its promotion
&gt; began this year, this would allow plenty of time for various types of
&gt; media to cover it.
&gt;
&gt; - We could look into having a dedicated Web site for the
&gt; event. installfest.org.au ? linuxfest.org.au ?, that way all the details
&gt; of every city can be kept in one place and it should also serve as a good
&gt; promotional icon.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know what you think.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
