&gt;* Industry acceptance.  One of the key concerns of schools is that they
&gt;should be training students with the packages used by industry - at
&gt;which point the MS monopoly raises it's head.  The counter argument to
&gt;this is that schools should not be training a package but teaching a set
&gt;of skills that are transferable between different applications.  Either
&gt;way this is probably the major stumbling block.


I personally think that students should be taught the concepts of computing
and computing applications.  They should be taught basic programming (C) to
help them understand how things are working.   This is the problem with
today's educational system.  Many teachers are not qualified in IT, but
teach IT as if they were CS graduates.  The "IT speciallist" at my brother's
school was a music teacher when I went through, and now is in charge of a
(very insecure) network of NT boxes.  My brothers regularly get in trouble
because the box they are using crashes from having too many apps open (go
Linux, that's where they get it from).

If students are taught "this is Word", they get out in the world and
_EXPECT_ to see Windows running Office.  This is increasingly not the case.
If we teach students to think and apply concepts they will be able to
_ADAPT_ to new and constantly changing environments.  Unfortunately I am
seeing more and more people who come into Engineering at uni who expect that
all computers were created with Windows in the ROM or something.  They get
into the programming parts of the course (involving SunOS on Xterms) and
spend the whole semester whinging about how archaeic that the Unix system
is.  They don't understand the fundamental computing concepts, and they
expect to see exactly the same programs/interface wherever they go.  What
happened to good-old thinking?

&gt;* Ability to use educational-specific packages that are only available
&gt;for Windows.  Products such as Wine and Vmware go some length to
&gt;addressing this problem but the perception that it could be complicated
&gt;to use (compliated=not just a single click to load my ms-app) is one
&gt;factor that requires addressing.


With a few simple shell scripts and some items in your WM/Gnome/KDE/destop
menus you can.  I have Windows98 installed on one partition, and all my apps
on another.  After careful configuration of Wine to use
'/mnt/win/Windows/Profiles/$USER', I set it up to show me the same drives
and drive letters as I see when in Windows.  I have it set up all mapped
drives (they are local via NFS when under Linux) to the correct letters.
Surprisingly it works very well, and in the newer versions of Wine I have
seen fewer and fewer crashes when running apps like Forte Agent.  I even had
some success with apps like Adobe Photoshop, and earlier versions of Word.
This approach is not simple for the admin, as he must configure the scripts,
but it is simple for the user beause they see an app, and a system inside
that app (file system, drives, printers, etc) that looks just like the
Windows network next-door, and it can all be started with a single click.

&gt;* Staff training.  Teachers don't want to look like idiots when standing
&gt;in front of a classroom of 14 yr old kids.  Many teachers stuggle with
&gt;Windows/Office as it is.  Changing to something else without proper
&gt;training and in house support would cause a riot.  This is the reason we
&gt;are taking a gentle approach here by looking at the dual-boot lab... to

&gt;later become a linux plus wine/vmware lab.


The 14 year old kids are going to be in the same position as the teachers.
If you give the teachers minimal training in things like the shell you are
using and in the general layout of the system (file system, printing, home
dirs, etc) then tell them the basics of the Un*x like system they should be
able to stay one step ahead of the kids.  You musn't forget that the
underlying concepts of Linux are similar to Windows.  You have a GUI, menus,
icons ("start-bar" in Gnome and KDE).  If you ignore using the shell
(something that I'm sure all the kids will want to do 'cos the shell is not
pretty graphics and must be out-dated) then the systems can even be
configured (QVWM) to look identical.

The applications follow similar conventions also.  Staroffice even uses
almost the same key commands as Office.  Netscape has the same keystrokes
but the Alt key is used in place of control.  Eudora mail works under Wine
somewhat.  I have heard stories of getting Outlook and IE to start under
Wine.

If you provide the familiar Windows apps under a "windows" menu that calls
Wine, and also provide the equivalent Linux apps the students will have a
choice.

Looking at dual-boot labs, has anyone seen WinDD from Tektronix lately? Do
they still sell/support it?  That kind of software would allow the students
_FULL_ access to a Windows system on their desktop (X) but reduce the
overhead of VMware.

And talking about Tektronix, I am after a colour Xterminal from Tek.. Does
anyone have one lying about that is not being used? I'd be willing to offer
some sort of payment if you do.

Sorry about the small rant here.  I would just hate to see a good oportunity
to introduce more people to the freedom of using a non-window OS go to
waste.
