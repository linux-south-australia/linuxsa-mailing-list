Hi Michael,

The winmodem in the Toshiba 4300 series is based on the Lucent Technologies
chipset. Fortunately they have distributed a binary only kernel module which
can be located at <A HREF="http://www.linmodems.org/">http://www.linmodems.org/</A> . I had no problems installing
from the distribution. It was compiled for RH 6.1 and reports unresolved
symbol errors on loading, but it still works very nicely.

Being a command-line person from way back, I use wvdial rather than
something like kppp or similar. A collegue of mine does use the RedHat
X-client dialer, also with great success.

Regards, Grant

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 	I must say straight away i am a newbie. What i am keen to find out
&gt; &gt; is if anyone on the list can point me in the direction to
&gt; buying a laptop
&gt; &gt; which is hardware compatible with Red Hat 6.2. I have been to the
&gt; &gt; support page at the Red Hat site and it seems that only Dell has a
&gt; &gt; certified system. What i am looking for is a system which is dual
&gt; &gt; bootable with linux and NT. I need a current system which is
&gt; avaliable in
&gt; &gt; Adelaide. If anyone has any suggestions on how i should head
&gt; that would be
&gt; &gt; greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; I've bought a DELL Inspiron 5000 recently, with Win98 preinstalled and now
&gt; running RedHat 6.2 (dual-boot).  I even used FIPS to shrink my
&gt; FAT partition
&gt; successfully, first time.  I do not believe there is any issue
&gt; having NT instead
&gt; and having that work with Linux/RH6.2 (perhaps disk partition
&gt; resizing though?)
&gt;
&gt; You should check out the Linux Laptops page at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/</A> which gives
&gt; step-by-step
&gt; guides for many, many laptops.
&gt;
&gt; The two areas of biggest concern is modems and X windows.
&gt;
&gt; Make sure that if you purchase any laptop with an internal modem
&gt; that it isn't a
&gt; winmodem.  Yes, it's more than likely you can get it working, but
&gt; at sub-optimal
&gt; performance (since your CPU is doing the DSP stuff).  I bought a
&gt; Xircom 56k
&gt; modem / 10-100mbit combo PCMCIA (Type-III) card which works well
&gt; for me with the
&gt; supplied open-source driver that comes with RH6.2 (actually pcmcia 3.18.20
&gt; (??)).
&gt;
&gt; X is another area of concern - make sure that XF86 3.3.6 supports
&gt; the chipset in
&gt; your laptop.  XF4.0 probably won't (yet), but I was able to use
&gt; the standard
&gt; XF86 that came with Red Hat 6.2 (3.3.6) albeit with the XF86Config file
&gt; specified in one of the howtos listed on the web site I mentioned.
&gt;
&gt; Summary - only buy a laptop which someone else has installed
&gt; Linux on and you
&gt; have the step by step instructions, or an offer from them to help
&gt; you out.  Much
&gt; easier that way.  You could go and get a Dell I7.5K, which is RH
&gt; certified, but
&gt; at a huge premium - it isn't a cheap laptop.
&gt;
&gt; Having said that, I love my Dell I5K.  I now sleep less now that
&gt; I've got it.
&gt;
&gt; All IMHO, your experiences may differ, proceed with caution...
