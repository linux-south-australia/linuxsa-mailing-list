David,


&gt;Evan!
&gt;MS Solutions aren't really that much simpler......

I know this 
&gt;
&gt;And Windows users don't even know that you are doing it!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry, but there is obviously a lack of knowledge on my part and I doubt
&gt;&gt; I'm too different from a lot of naieve users.
&gt;
&gt;You are being exposed to the knowledge. It is yours to learn from. It is
&gt;your choice to run away from it as well.

Sorry David, exposure to anecdotes and part solutions (though interesting
and enlightening) is not the best way of learning. I am sure you would
agree rigorous training in such an important area is what is called for. 

&gt;Console commands are not archaic...........
Been there before on list I think I leave it.


&gt;Your reply to me will be, undoubetedly, that you are just a user and
&gt;can't be expected to understand Linux (or any operating system) to the
&gt;degree that I do. I agree with you totally; you wouldn't be wrong if you
&gt;thought or said this. Nonetheless, with the obvious concern for security
&gt;- shown by the commercial viability of making virus scanners for example
&gt;- I would advise you to at least take an interest in the security of
&gt;whatever operating system you choose to use.

Nope, I endeavour to understand everything I use, kinda helps when things
stuff up. 

&gt;One needs to take a good think about how secure one wishes to have one's
&gt;system. I take it seriously, so I run a reasonable firewall script [nmap
&gt;by itself says that the host is down and when I run it such that it does
&gt;manage to start scanning nmap also reports that I don't have any
&gt;unexpectedly open ports...and I understand the security issues with what
&gt;I'm running etc etc]. You might take a different stance; it is your
&gt;choice.

I have thougth about security and I realise the need for it. I also want to
incorporate it seamlessly within my home setup, as im only on dialup now
it's not a huge issue, but I will be on ADSL and I am sure it will rear its
head and having combination of consoles (kids), windows pc's (wife) and
linux pc's (me) within a network sharing adsl should create hours of fun
from a security stand point. 


&gt;
&gt;Security is not nice. I doubt it ever will be. We'll just have to live
&gt;with that.
&gt;DL

Security is nice when it's someone else responability. :P

Evan
