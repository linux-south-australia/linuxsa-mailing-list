[Why Linux?]

And because the GUI can be pretty snazzy, even if you are a Windows user.
The degree of polish on KDE2 is quite impressive. I'm one version out of
date with the KDE2 betas (1.93 Kleopatra, current is 1.94 Kandidat) but it
is still pretty good. I have been comparing Konqueror, the KDE
filemanager/web browser, with Mozilla and Netscape and I'm almost
convinced to moved to Konqueror. I respect the Gecko rendering engine in
Mozilla a lot, but as a whole Mozilla feels very slow and difficult to
use. And the current lack of commonality between Gnome components and
Mozilla components seems a bit of a pity.

Eazel is coming up with some interesting work, but it will be a while yet
before you can present a Windows/Mac power user with Gnome and expect them
to be impressed with the consistency and reliability of it all. There is a
lot of very clear code there though.

The other thing I'm watching with interest is Star Office/KOffice. Anyone
else got comments on how they are progressing relative to each other?
