&gt;Neither LinuxSA nor AUUG spent big on advertising, nor for 
&gt;that matter did
&gt;either spend big on any other aspect of the SA event.  The SA event was
&gt;splendidly successful thanks to the very generous donations of 
&gt;its various
&gt;sponsors and the almost tireless efforts of the organisers and 
&gt;helpers.  I
&gt;don't believe there was any paid advertising other than one 
&gt;cheap ad. in

"cheap" -- I don't remember it beintg cheap.. I think it was about $500... 

&gt;the local paper on the day of the actual event.  I understand 
&gt;that we did
&gt;get one person who saw that ad. and attended.  It certainly is 

And I think we got more than one from the ad -- maybe 10... :)

&gt;wrong to say
&gt;that we got a big turnout because of it, let alone that we spent big.

the ad wasn't particularly successful... :(

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;If I may share my experience: an installfest will be successful if the
&gt;organisers work their butts off.  Maybe money can substitute 
&gt;for that, but
&gt;who's got money?

Very true - you need the support of many, as well... 

money can't really _substitute_ for it.... it's a lot of work no matter
what, but if you had money, some parts would be easier for sure...
