Hi gurus,

I am looking for a guru game enough to install RedHat on my computer!
I have  Pentium Pro 200 with 96MB RAM and a new 20.5GB HDD. I tried many =
times to install Linux, but it failed. I am not interested in win95 or =
win98. If is possible I wish to install RH Linux starting with version =
5.0 and upgrade to 6.2.
I have RH 5.0, RH 5.1, RH 6.0, RH 6.1 and RH 6.2 CD-ROM's.
Anyone whith b..ls is welcome!
I am about to give up! I am pretty sure it can be done, but I cannot do =
it myself. Is there anyone that has the courage to do it? Please reply =
to this e-mail and ulet us know what it takes to install Linux. Windows =
or not it doesn't matter.=20
Why I want Linux RH version 5.0 is because of glint! From there I would =
like to get to RH 6.2.=20
I had two HDD's one for windows of 1.5GB and one for Linux of 2.0GB =
before. Now I have one HDD or 20.5GB and I upgraded RAM to 96MB. RAM is =
not recognised by "msd" in windows properly. It only allows for 64MB. I =
have 2x32 MB RAM and 2x16MB in the SIMMS slots. I had a program in =
windows, I think Ramdisk which at install it asked for confirming the =
96MB RAM, but after reboot it only read 62MB of RAM.
mem command sees the 96MB RAM, but not sure if it uses it.
My computer at the moment is Pentium Pro 200 with a 20.5GB, 96MB of RAM, =
2MB of video S3 Trio64+,=20
C: =3D1.5GB
D: =3D5GB
E:=3D5GB
F:=3D8.5GB

I tried to install win98, but it failed, it's still on rebuilding system =
registry at 53% and stalled.
OK, gurus set your terms! If any of you is game enough I want to hear =
from you. I am not fond of windows. I want Linux on my computer. If any =
of you can do it pleasea reply!
Include costs on reply, coffee, drinks, petrol and so on!
I would love to see this sort it out!
Thank you and best wishes,

Nick.
