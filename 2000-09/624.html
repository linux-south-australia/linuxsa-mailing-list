Heap big trouble with SSH installation!

Following numerous admonitions to remove all .rhosts files and
use ssh instead, I allowed myself 30-60 minutes to install the
latest SSH on my last machine with no SSH. Machine number 6.
It did not go as well as expected!
Here are some notes...
I hope this doesn't pre-empt anything that Geoffrey is going to say.

1.	First the standard OpenSSH is for BSD.
	So I had to go fetch the portable version of SSH.

2.	The correct portable source for linux went through the
	./configure process,a nd got stuck because of lack of
	the OpenSSL software.

3.	So I fetched the OpenSSL software - a big bunch of software,
	and installed it. No big problem.
	And then I went back to the OpenSSH.
	And that compiled fine. And it installed fine.
	But....

4.	When I tried to log in to the spanking new machine 
	(the infamous and much maligned "rat"), it failed.
	Hmmm. Look at the logs. Logs say that my account is 
	expired. Too bad I just ran "pwconv" to get rid of all
	the passwords in /etc/password to hide them in the
	/etc/shadow file. 

5.	I found a neat little tool "chage" to edit the /etc/shadow
	file. It turns out that "chage" for old RedHat 5.2
	has a Y2K bug. AT last, I found one!
	(Try using RH 5.2 "chage" to set a year-2000 date...)
	
6.	No amount of manual editing of /etc/shadow fixed up the
	PAM access problem. I reckon maybe even PAM is having
	a Y2K problem. But that's pure conjecture.

7.	So I recompiled OpenSSH with the --wihtout-pam option,
	and after it failed and I ran "make clean",
	the whole thing works!

8.	Of course, "sshd" must then be put in /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

9.	As a final blow, it turns out that my old RH 5.2 machine
	with kernel 2.0.36 just happens to use TCP client ports
	below 1024. Grrrrrr!
	So now I have to change my firewall for this ancient machine.
	Hmmm. Something screwy going on here. 
	This is what /usr/include/netinet/in.h says:
	-------------------------------------------
        /* Ports less than this value are reserved for privileged processes. */
        IPPORT_RESERVED = 1024,
	-------------------------------------------

Question:
Does anyone know why "ssh" would be using ports around about 750-780
to communicate with a remote sshd process?
Surely this should be impossible.
Maybe installing RH 5.2 over the top of RH 4.2 was not such a bright idea....
[Rat by name. Rat by nature.]
Here's a sample firewall line:

Sep 14 04:10:42 dog kernel: IP fw-in deny ppp0 TCP 203.48.2.226:22 203.38.148.50:755 L=44 S=0x00 I=0 F=0x0040 T=61

This took a mere 4 hours of playing around.
Admittedly I did have some toast and tea during this time,
but keeping out the pesky mongrel hackers is a
time-consuming task, that's for sure.

Moral of story:
If you want to put OpenSSH on an old RH 5.2 machine,
use the --without-pam option for ./configure.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  My experiments with "ssh" and multiple sequences/trees of
logins in conjunction with ssh-agent and ssh-add (and "ssh-add -d")
have shown me that "ssh" is a truly amazing work.
I hope that Geoffrey can bring out the full potential for
excitement that "ssh" offers today's linux user.
Tracking down all those SSH env variables and unix sockets
is a task which rewards study.

PPS. Life was much better before computers anyway.
We were so much happier with typewriters, carbon paper [that's
where Cc: comes from!], long division by hand, log books,
slide rules, mental arithmetic, hand-written letters,
pounds, shillings and pence, ....
