&gt;&gt; Actually, I've been entertaining this idle thought lately - if
&gt;&gt; there's money to be made in hardware, why not build a router
&gt;&gt; where the OS is open sourced?  I seem to remember at some stage
&gt;&gt; that you had a passion for ASIC Ethernet switches - did anything
&gt;&gt; ever come of that?

Well, it's been done already. There is more to building a company than
having a product.

&gt;Funny you should mention that.
&gt;Lately I've been doing some 155 Mbit/sec ATM switch stuff
&gt;with a mum's and dad's K6-2/400 which I bought for A$900 new
&gt;(excl monitor, but including 20-24% sales tax, before July).
&gt;No problems with speed (working in the linux kernel).
&gt;
&gt;Someone told me they run 400 Mbits/sec continuously on 3 ATM
&gt;cards simultaneously. (I think that's 400 Mbits/sec total,
&gt;not each.) That was on a P III/600 or something.
&gt;
&gt;Now if you're only talking about 10 and 100 Mbit/sec links,
&gt;this surely can be done by a 400 MHz processor with no problems
&gt;at all.
&gt;The only problem is lack of PIC slots etc.
&gt;I think I read somewhere that you can get cards which do
&gt;multiple ethernet links.

Yes, you can.

&gt;It would be a pushover to develop IP routers with linux boxes
&gt;and put Cisco out of business.

Ummm, I cannot believe that you said that. Market leaders are rarely a
pushover.  Plenty of big companies in the past have tried to dislodge
Cisco, including IBM and Digital, and failed.

&gt;I truly don't see why it hasn't been done.
&gt;Some of the specs I've seen for Cisco routers are less than
&gt;impressive.

Their success has little to do with the performance of their boxes and more
to do with:

 - being the first to market
 - good marketing and market development
 - products that people needed

&gt;Conclusion:
&gt;I don't think you need much special hardware.
&gt;
&gt;Just a thought.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm.
&gt;I saw this lately too:
&gt;This company:
&gt;
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.basystems.com/">http://www.basystems.com/</A>
&gt;
&gt;Broadband Access Systems recently announced that their 
&gt;switching/routing gear is running linux.
&gt;Their 1 MByte excessively glossy spec document (PDF)
&gt;says that their gear runs at between 200 Bbit/sec
&gt;and 25 Tbit/sec or 20 million packets/sec,
&gt;using 18,000 Mips of processor power.
&gt;
&gt;So I think it's all been done.
&gt;But they _do_ use special hardware.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Alan Kennington.
