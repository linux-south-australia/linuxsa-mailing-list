&gt;&gt; &gt; The trouble is that new vulnerabilities are being continuously added.

&gt;&gt; Then what on earth were you using POP2 for?

&gt;Daryl,
&gt;
&gt;I forgot to reply to this.
&gt;
&gt;A few times in the last year, people have asked me if they
&gt;could have e-mail accounts (using pop, imap or whatever), and
&gt;I told them that I was not running such software because I
&gt;thought it was a serious security hole.
&gt;
&gt;So I was quite surprised to find that I _was_ running such
&gt;post-office software.

Ah, yes, this problem is a couple of years old now. TurboLinux makes a big
thing of this, but it is not clear that they are as secure as they like to
think, because they suffer from the same problems as anyone else.

Of course, RH6.2 is quite a lot better in that regard, but there are still
ways to make yourself vulnerable.

The current crop of vulnerabilities all seem to require local access, but
there are still lots of machines out there with the old vulnerabilities,
and buffer overflows are being found all the time.
