&gt; &gt; I see this as the biggest problem. Mozilla and Star Office are very large
&gt; &gt; bits of functionality, and they weren't designed with either Gnome or
&gt; &gt; Gnome's Bonobo components architecture in mind. What's more until recently
&gt; &gt; both of them had as a strategic focus to be as at-home as possible in
&gt; &gt; environments where neither were present. The foregoing two sentences are
&gt; &gt; completely at odds with constructing a completely integrated, modular
&gt; &gt; environment. 
  :
&gt; I think the fact the they *are* seperate projects is the strength.  The GNOME
&gt; hackers aren't obliged to port/maintain these huge code bases that may evolve in
&gt; different directions.  Since they're both now GPL'd, projects like GNOME *and*
&gt; KDE will be able to lift useful bits and discard the bulk.

Yes, I expect every open office-type tool to pick up the MS Office
import/export bits of Star Office, and that includes KOffice. The Gnome
project (or at least the Foundation) is saying I think something quite
different: Star Office is to become a kind of starting point for their
office strategy, or something.

But maybe this isn't the case? Perhaps I'm out of date. Anyway, I need to
get a better understanding of where Gnome is going for business reasons,
especially how consistent the programming interfaces to the components is
likely to be in the short-term, and how the strategy hangs together for
the long term.

&gt; Someone might do a complete GNOM/KDE port of Moz and/or OOo, but it won't be the
&gt; core GNOME/KDE hacks.  Complete communities will/have formed around Moz/OOo,
&gt; leaving the desktop guys to, well, worry about the desktop.

This sounds like a reasonable guess, but it doesn't help me in comparing
the projects on technical grounds.

Let's look at the design strategies of Gnome and KDE. KDE claim that it is
beneficial to have components built with the same toolkits, philosophy,
coding standards and whathaveyou to address most of the office tools and
their integration. If I understand correctly, Gnome is claiming 

   a) this approach isn't important (hence the plan to use best-they-can-find
      pieces and wrap them or some derived version of them in Gnome 
      interfaces), and

   b) at some distant time in the future this approach will be completely
      implemented in Gnome 2.0


&gt; Will be interesting to see.  

Well, quite so, but what about people that want to write real working code
with a really good future right now? Hence this thread, and I'm sure I'm
not the only person trying to work out what to do right now.
