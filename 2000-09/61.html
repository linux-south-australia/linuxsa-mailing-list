<H1>my first DOS attack</H1>

Well, well, well....

Finally someone tried out a DOS attack on one of my subnets.
And because of the way that I set up virtual hosts, they
were wasting their time.
I won't give away the details, but that "ipfw" software
really does some neat things with sockets.

I got about 30 seconds of bombardment of TCP port 2222
on a variety of IP addresses.
Well, I guess that's not much of a DOS attack....

The way it was done suggests that a lot of other people
must have got spattered too.
Anyone else got a bigpond connection with address
203.38.x.y up to 203.48.x.y ??
If you kept packet logs, you might find that someone was
bombarding you on all your TCP 2222 ports at 7:30 a.m.
on Friday 1 September 2000.

_Now_ I finally have a good reason to tell people who think
that giving a Internet interface 20 different IP addresses
is a bad idea. Just use socket 80 redirection instead.
It will save you a lot of woe.

I guess what happened to me was related to those DOS attacks
on an Australian bank.

Here's a sample:

---------------------------------------------------------
07:30:10.048883 210.97.1.1.2102 &gt; 203.48.2.128.2222: S 1257788303:1257788303(0) win 32120 &lt;mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 33264911 0,n

07:30:10.078883 210.97.1.1.2104 &gt; 203.48.2.130.2222: S 1256730791:1256730791(0) win 32120 &lt;mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 33264911 0,n

---------------------------------------------------------

The source address is in Korean IP space.
So it's a waste of time telling them about it.

Ethereal says:
Duration = 29.5 seconds
Packet count = 3978
Bytes = 242376
Packets/second = 134.847
Bytes/second = 8216

That's about 8216 * 8 = 65728 bits/sec.
Not bad for a 33k modem!!!

=====================================================
Hmmm....
I've just been tracing through the last 3 days of traffic
with ethereal (which would be a great tool if more of it
worked), and it's total mayhem out there.
I've never seen such a concentration of attacks 
in my life.
I've never seen most of those attacks before.
Like sequences of RST/ACK packets, for instance.

This now makes me think that someone __is__ getting
ready for the Olympics.
Otherwise, why would be there be such an intense attack on
Australian IP space suddenly starting in the last 1-2 weeks?
They're clearly out to gather as many zombies as possible in
Australian IP space so as to maximise the attack-bandwidth
locally.

Anyone with a machine on the net should batten down the
hatches right now - and check to see if you've been
infected in preparation for the "big event".
Don't be surprised if the whole Australian net falls to pieces.

Now, how to I find out if _I've_ been zombie-ised??
I wish I'd run Veracity in advance now. Grrrr...

-----------------------------------------------------
Well, I've just spent another hour or so looking at the logs.
There are more attacks in each hour than I used to get in
a whole week.

My suggestion if you get bored with the olympics:
Start up ethereal on an Internet port somewhere
in Australian IP space, and sit back and enjoy!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
