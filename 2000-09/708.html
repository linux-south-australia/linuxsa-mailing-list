NT gives the following options in its usual GUI (Ghastly, Useless, & Inept)
interface
	
Users
	Shares
	In Use
	Replication
	Alerts

It's the Users, Shares & In Use functionality that I'm interested in for
Samba.

The Users tab has 2 windows, the top one with the list of connected users.
Click on a user in the top window & the bottom window shows which share(s)
they are connected to & how long they've been connected.  You have the
option to disconnect that one user or disconnect all users.

The Shares tab has a list of all shares in the top window (same interface as
the users tab).  Click on a share & the bottom window shows the users
connected to that share, the time they've been connected, and whether they
are using the share or not.  Again you have the option to disconnect a user
from that share, or disconnect all users.

The In Use tab is probably the most useful one.  It gives a list of all the
files in use, sorted by username.  (In typical MS fashion they leave out
another useful bit.  It doesn't let u sort by filename!!)  The list also
tells you if they have the file open for read or write access and how many
locks the file has (not sure what this achieves but anyway).

Possibly smbstatus gives a lot of this info, I'll play around at home
tonight probably, but some of interface to disconnect users from
files/shares as well as telling you what files are in use by whom would be
excellent.  Ideally a Webmin module for this would be good (all you
programmer's take note!)

The NT interface for this is ok, but like most NT admin tools, could be
improved, I mean you cant even maximise the window, so you're limited to a
list of 7 or 8 files per screen!  Yet another instance showing NT is way out
of its depth in big organisations!  (IMHO anyway)

		Hi,

		Have you tried smbstatus?

		Tell me what NT gives you, and we can think about enhancing
smbstatus ...

		At 04:31 PM 9/14/00 +0930, you wrote:
		&gt;Does anyone know of some good tools for administering open
files/ active
		&gt;users etc on Samba shares.
		&gt;I'm setting up a couple drives on a Linux box for file
sharing which will be
		&gt;mapped as a drive in our main NT server logon script.
		&gt;I'd like to have the same, and better preferably ;-),
functionality for
		&gt;monitoring open files/users that the NT server manager has.
		&gt;The SWAT tool gives a nice list of open files, but this
would get very
		&gt;cumbersome with the number of users we have, and it doesn't
give you the
		&gt;ability to kill off individual files/users.
		&gt;
		&gt;Thanks
