Hi,

I have avoided the situation by using passive FTP. 

Checking for SYN flags will allow outgoing connections with any port 
pair while disallowing incoming connections, but unfortunately active 
FTP requires incoming TCP connections to arbitrary ports.

You could also allow incoming SYN packets with a source port of 20, a 
high destination port (&gt;1024) and a destination of your FTP machine, but 
that would leave you open to anybody using a source port of 20 to connect 
to services running on high ports, such as winsock and X.  If you did 
this, I would recommend a rule blocking ports 6000-6010 before the rule 
allowing source port 20.  The ipfwadm man page indicates that this is 
possible.

I also noticed that your tcpdump command ignores packets from source as 
well as destination ports.  That means that anyone could use a source 
port of, for example, 80, to scan/hack/whatever you and not get logged.
Consider using dst port XX instead of port XX on your tcpdump command line.

My tcpdump script is below.  It uses a size of 10000 packets to limit 
dump files to a reasonable (~1-2M) size.

#!/bin/sh

ulimit -f unlimited

while true
do
	# Keep dated log files
        /usr/local/sbin/tcpdump -c 10000 -n -i eth0 -s 32000 \
		-w /var/dmp/dump.`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`

	# Only keep most recent 30 log files
        /bin/ls -1tr /var/dmp/dump.* | /usr/bin/tail -30 &gt; /tmp/xxx.$$
        /bin/ls -1tr /var/dmp/dump.* | /bin/grep -v -f /tmp/xxx.$$ | \
		/usr/bin/xargs /bin/rm
        /bin/rm /tmp/xxx.$$
done

&gt; 
&gt; On the subject of ipfwadm scripts, which probably
&gt; only people over 40 would remember now,
&gt; I've been modifying my firewall on a redhat 5.2 machine
&gt; (not the one that was hacked), and I've come up against
&gt; what I know is a tricky area - FTP data connections.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know of a link to info on how to this in
&gt; a really safe way?
&gt; I've scoured linux-specific sites for this info - they all
&gt; just give details on ipchains.
&gt; I've also dug around with google, with the same sort of
&gt; luck. The best info I found so far was on a Russian site.
&gt; (And no, I don't want to wipe the disk and install a more
&gt; up to date OS.)
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is that I've got a default-deny firewall script now,
&gt; following instructions from the illuminati, and that's big trouble
&gt; for FTP. If I let FTP through, then pretty much anything goes.
&gt; I know this is well-known problem, and Paul Russell's tutorial
&gt; on this touched on the problem briefly about a year ago.
&gt; But I can't find the tute notes.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------
&gt; PS.  I think it's unfortunate that some people take the attitude
&gt; that "if you get hacked, you're lazy or an idiot", without
&gt; checking out the facts. I won't explain the full context
&gt; in my case. But do remember that when _you_ get hacked, people
&gt; will call you an idiot or lazy too, and tell you lots of
&gt; things that you know already. The ability to understand things
&gt; from other people's point of view is a virtue!
&gt; 
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------
&gt; PPS. I found the full attack scripts finally.
&gt; To get into POP2, they used:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/SDI-pop2.c">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/SDI-pop2.c</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Then they fetched this file (a copy of it) over FTP:
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/rootcron.sh">http://darknet.securityinfos.com/os/linux/redhat/5.2/rootcron.sh</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Then they just did a few clumsy things while trying to announce
&gt; their exploits, and then I noticed the packet warnings from
&gt; my relatively liberal firewall saying that something was
&gt; going on, and I blocked them.
&gt; 
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------
&gt; PPPS. I had previously heard that POP and IMAP were security
&gt; holes, and I had been blocking ports 110 and 143 for at least
&gt; a year. However, I didn't know that 109 was also a problem.
&gt; I only spend an average of 10-20 hours a week on computer security.
&gt; And sometimes I concentrate fully on real work.
&gt; 
&gt; But the vulnerable machine in question was first installed with
&gt; slackware, which was pretty horrible - it didn't have the software for
&gt; my ethernet card (about mid-1996 era, this is), and a heap of
&gt; other things didn't work either. But after a year or two,
&gt; I got it connected up to a sparc station, connected from time
&gt; to time by 9600 bit/sec modem to a rather safe organisation
&gt; hidden behind a rather conservative firewall.
&gt; So security was not my concern, even when I put redhat 4.x
&gt; of various versions on it. I was just worried that so little
&gt; worked - and the free support from RedHat wouldn't work,
&gt; because I couldnt' even get my customer registration
&gt; through the organisation's firewall.
&gt; The firewall stopped me from getting any useful help with the thing.
&gt; 
&gt; Later, I installed redhat 5.2 over the top of an earlier version,
&gt; and my main concerns were still _functionality_.
&gt; It was only 20 months ago that I connected my then 3 machines
&gt; to the net, and I firewalled out anything that looked nasty,
&gt; not really knowing how to "turn off services".
&gt; At that time, Redhat didn't ask you which services you wanted,
&gt; as far as I know.
&gt; And I really don't have the time to "upgrade" my OSs on 7 machines
&gt; now every 6 months. Besides, the "upgrades" usually take the
&gt; old configurations unaltered.
&gt; 
&gt; etc. etc. etc. etc.
