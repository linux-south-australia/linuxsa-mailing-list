Hi,

&gt; &gt; Depends who you're talking about. Why should my grandfather need to know
&gt; &gt; that MS word depends on VBRUN100.DLL and the MFC libraries version 7.3.2
&gt; &gt; or greater? What my Grandfather needs is stuff that works without him
&gt; &gt; thinking about it.
&gt; 
&gt; And in an ideal world perhaps he could find that stuff.  Stepping back from
&gt; fantasy for a minute, the reality is that the multitude of package managers
&gt; makes it very difficult for a software publisher to seamlessly support all
&gt; environments, with the result that one day your Grandfather is going to
&gt; find that his system no longer boots after installing some neat new software
&gt; that his brother sent him, and he'll have no clue why nor any experience to
&gt; fall back on to help him gain that clue.  Start as you mean to go on.  Do
&gt; you mean to start everyone off dumb?

There has to be a certain minimum level of understanding, but also the
everyday user doesn't need to be a computer expert. For instance, I know
how to drive my car, I know to check that there is fuel in the Petrol
tank, water in the radiator, air in the tyres, oil in the sump and
power in the battery. I know enough to accomodate the little problems
it has with starting. When I noticed recently that my car was running hot,
and upon calling the RAA was told that my Head Gasket had cracked, I
simply acceptided him at his word, and sent it in for repairs. I could
learn enough about cars to know that myself ( and the hundreds of other
potential problems), and know how to fix it. I could learn how to dservice
my car myself, but I don't, I pay someone who I know is an expert in that
area to do that instead. Its the same situation here.


&gt; &gt; Pretty much anyone for who System administration is not core business (or
&gt; &gt; a hobby) does not want to waste time (ie spend time unprofitably)
&gt; &gt; configuring their system...
&gt; 
&gt; We seem to have a fundamental difference of opinion here.  I don't agree
&gt; that configuring your system is a waste of time; and I held this view long
&gt; before I was every a professional system administrator.  Maybe I'm so good
&gt; at computers because I always took an active interest in mine.  More power
&gt; to me (literally.)

Its a time based thing. I would love to be made redundant by haveing all
my (l)users computer experts, and able to solve their own problems. I
could get on and make my systems run efficiently. It doesn't work because
mosrt people lack time, inclination, aptitude, ability or are too lazy. If
some person wishes to try a little system admin on their personal PC, then
they need some method of maintainance 'till they have the skills. Package
menagement can help here.

cya
