&gt; &gt; Sorry Sarah but what are you asking here?
&gt; 
&gt; I was after your personal opinion and the reasons for it (if your so
&gt; inclined)!

Since you seem serious.

  vi for system administration

    Available on every platform.  It's only real advantage, as having
    a mode-full editor is a horrible user interface design choice.

  XEmacs for programming

    Calling emacs an editor is like calling Everest a hill.  But if
    you program for a living, it's perfect.  If you thought you could
    blow a lot of time fiddling with GUIs, then you've seen nothing yet.
    Takes about a week to learn to use and about two years to become
    an expert.  But if you've ever faced maintaining 100,000 lines of code
    then it's got exactly the features you need, somewhere.  XEmacs has
    a less steep learning curve than GNU Emacs.

    To give you an idea of just how carried away emacs has become, it has
    a very good mail client.  It will also convert between source control
    formats.  It will maintain files on the far side of an FTP, ssh or cvs
    connection.  It has a very good text to PostScript converter.  There
    are at least 1,000 other features.

    In short, you can start emacs from your .login and not feel the need
    to leave.  Some very sick people do.
