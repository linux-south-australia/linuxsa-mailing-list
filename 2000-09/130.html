Just for the record, can I say that there are situations where rsh is
not terribly bad. But these are singular examples. I am working in
environments where rsh (or at least its functionality) is absolutely
neccesary.

Here's an example:

SCADA system (a system that controls a oil/gas/water pipeline).
The system is composed of anywhere between 4 and 28 machines, all
running propriety redudant real-time databases and historical databases.
Part of everyday living in these systems is being able to execute
commands on all the boxes at once.

Rsh is the answer,

BECAUSE

there are no internet connections to the system!

I was flamed very badly by a list member last time I said this, but fuck
it - Its true. If you have access to the system at all, it means you
have been able to guess a telephone number (not impossible) guess how
the access works (ppp, plain) guess the password, then guess the
username, then guess the machine name to connect to, then guess what the
hell you want to do now.

Sound like an inside job? yup.

Its all about the trust levels sonny jim.

There is a mentality that Alan has pointed out, "you dont need triple
DES crypto from one side of their living room to the other"

and if Alan doesn't mind, I'm going to quote in in my random sig file.

I've got an inferiority complex, but it's not a very good one.
