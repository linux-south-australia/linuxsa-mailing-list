Richard!

&gt; &gt;&gt; How does this make your system more secure? I could nmap you and talk to
&gt; &gt;&gt; your postfix directly on port 5000 instead of port 25....
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm, hang on!

I agree but if one did something like (or you had a default policy of
DENY/REJECT on all chains, and didn't open port 25):

ipchains -A input -p tcp -d ${MYIP} 25 -s any/0 -j DENY

You won't get ANY mail. Which may or may not be the desired result. If
the desired result is to scan the incoming mail, then I guess sending
your SENDMAIL off to some odd port such as 5000 (or postfix etc) and
shutting that port would work quite neatly; it sounds like a minor
kludge to me though.

What if someone on the inside sent you evil e-mail directly to port
5000? I can't quite bring the statistics out of thin air, but a good
deal of corporate sabotage happens from within - not without. In fact a
number of security books I've browsed through stress that it's no good
stopping the boogie man from getting inside your house by installing
bars and locks on your windows when the boogie man is already inside, or
already has access through some current means.
