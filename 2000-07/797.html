&gt; &gt; Try telling that to a CCIE Network Engineer! Worked on a Cisco

&gt; Yes. A Livingstone portmaster specifically. Telnetting into it is
&gt; command line.  Using X, its gui. Of both approaches, the gui is the
&gt; most productive and untuitively easy to follow (depends greatly on
&gt; the creative energies of the writer of that gui of course)

I'm talking more about the complex debugging than basic setup.
I thought I was implying that with the CCIE bit, but on reflection it
may not have been clear.

There is stuff I do with 5200's and 5300's that would simply suck with
a GUI, but that's just me. I'm not usually the end customer.
 
&gt; If I can design an easy to use dialog box for my end customer, I
&gt; imagine he would be far more impressed than explaining to him my
&gt; knowledge of how to grep a file and pipe the answer.

Yes, but the GUI is for the customer, you'll get no arguments from me
there as most of our software has a nice GUI. However, because of the
CLI, the GUI is powerful.

&gt; Command line -switches have no place in the
&gt; end use of a product,

Who said we were talking about the end use of a product? CCIE's are
not involved in the end use of a product, just their configuration.

&gt; just as coding in C is not useable by itself. The fact that you can
&gt; only use command line on some issues does not elevate it into a
&gt; place of honour and glory. Instead, it reflects a primitive mindset
&gt; on what the end game really is.

Once again, depends on your viewpoint. For a customer administering
his or her ISP, a GUI is a must. For me it's a pain in the arse!

&gt; As for your specific example of a Cisco anything, IF, i were
&gt; constantly, and boringly using the same repetitous syntax to
&gt; manipluate that box, complete with all the attendant typos and wrong
&gt; commands that we all make, I would wrap that stuff inside an X
&gt; window based on effort to do so vs benefit.

Yes, I guess it depends on what you are doing with it. Repetition is
definately not a word I would use to describe my interaction with most
Cisco gear. In fact sometimes repetition would be nice.

&gt; Bottom line? People confuse their ability to use -R tor 'recurse a
&gt; directory' as a defininition that the 'command' works well. It
&gt; doesn't. The need for the option expressed in that manner, shouldn't
&gt; be there in the first place.

Yes but if my gui does what it does case it calls a command with a -R,
the the CLI is useful.

I still agree with what you are saying, get rid of the CLI for the end
user (we do), but I'd still like one for me though. :o)
