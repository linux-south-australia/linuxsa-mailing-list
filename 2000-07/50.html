&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; IDE drives will happily provide the illusion of better performance
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on a single-user system, until you try to put "real" load through
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; them (the reason they look like they're giving better performance is
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; because it's rather difficult for a single user to put "real" load
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; through them during day-to-day activities).  As soon as you put an
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; IDE disk on a multi-user server, though, expect performance to drop
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; through the floor.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you like to measure that?  Run some device benchmarks against
&gt; &gt;&gt; both SCSI and ATA and compare the results?  Here are the results of
&gt; &gt;&gt; running rawio against the fastest ATA and SCSI drives on my test
&gt; &gt;&gt; machine:
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;            Random read  Sequential read    Random write Sequential
write
&gt; &gt;&gt; ID          K/sec  /sec    K/sec  /sec     K/sec  /sec     K/sec  /sec
&gt; &gt;&gt; ata        1547.2    96   6696.7   409    1532.0    94    6184.4   377
&gt; &gt;&gt; scsi       1242.6    78   1236.3    75    1295.6    77    1310.6    80
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Now admittedly I'm comparing 2 year old SCSI drives with modern ATA
&gt; &gt;&gt; drives, so this isn't fair.  But it doesn't exactly slam ATA.  You
&gt; &gt;&gt; presumably have modern SCSI drives available; how do they perform?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; www.storagereview.com is the place to go for proof on this matter.
&gt;
&gt; Well, for an opinion, anyway.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I did a quick comparison between these three drives, each of which are
the
&gt; &gt; fastest on the market in its catagory:
&gt; &gt; Quantum Atlas 10k II (36.7 GB Ultra160/m SCSI)
&gt; &gt; Western Digital Enterprise 10k (18.3 GB U2W-SCSI)
&gt; &gt; Quantum Fireball Plus LM (30.0 GB ATA-66)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Using the "IOMeter - File Server Access Pattern - Load = Heavy" tests
these
&gt; &gt; where the results:
&gt; &gt; IOs/Sec --
&gt; &gt; Quantum Atlas 10k II: 267
&gt; &gt; Western Digital Enterprise 10k: 224
&gt; &gt; Quantum Fireball Plus LM: 145
&gt; &gt; MB/s --
&gt; &gt; Quantum Atlas 10k II: 2.92
&gt; &gt; Western Digital Enterprise 10k: 2.44
&gt; &gt; Quantum Fireball Plus LM: 1.58
&gt;
&gt; It would be interesting to compare IOMeter with rawio, but I note that
&gt; the results from both are pretty much the same for the data rate for
&gt; the ATA drive, but the number of transfers per second was much higher;
&gt; this makes me wonder what the test is like.  Unfortunately, it's
&gt; almost impossible to deduce anything from the URL you give.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Just from these results you can see that IDE has a looong way to go
&gt; &gt; before it can get close to SCSI.
&gt;
&gt; Assuming that they're testing what we're talking about, they indicate
&gt; that the ATA drive chosen is significantly slower than the SCSI drives
&gt; chosen.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Also under RAID conditions, the SCSI drives would have a huge leap in
&gt; &gt; performace of the IDE drives.
&gt;
&gt; Why?  You need to substantiate that claim.  It doesn't correspond to
&gt; my own observations.  To make things fair, we need to assume one
&gt; controller per drive for ATA, of course.

Mainly because of the fact that SCSI drives on the same "bus" can read and
write at the same time, where IDE drives on the same controller cant.  If
you have 4 SCSI drives in RAID 0, the speed should be 4x that of one single
drive. With IDE, using two controllers (prim & secondary), in the same
situation, youll only get 2x the speed.

&gt; &gt; Although... compare the price diff between a 2 drive SCSI RAID
&gt; &gt; system and a 2 drive IDE ATA-66 RAID system.  The IDE system will
&gt; &gt; come up best for price vs performance.
&gt;
&gt; I think that's at least partially because the ATA RAID people are
&gt; selling in larger quantities.  Basically, a RAID system is still a
&gt; pile of disks, a pile of controllers and a bit of software.
