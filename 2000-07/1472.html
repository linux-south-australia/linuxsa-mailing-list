<H1>QmailAdmin Problem</H1>

Hi Guys,

I usually sit and watch this list, but I have come across a Major problem
that needs urgent addressing. I have looking in #linux on oz.org and they
can't come up with anything. I have asked on the qmailadmin mailing list,
and they do not reply. So I thought I might try all you 'gurus' out there.

The problem is:

I have a qmail+vpopmail+qmailadmin+sqwebmail system running on Redhat6.1

Everything worked fine. Clients were able to login to the
/cgi-bin/qmailadmin address to edit all of their own E-Mail settings (we
host about 15 domain accounts)

Now all of a sudden, it stopped working. The mail server is fine, vpopmail
is fine, sqwebmail (another cgi-bin program) is fine. Qmailadmin has
stopped working. I can go to the address and the login screen displays. I
put in the details and a '500 Internal Server EDrror' Comes up. I have
re-installed qmailadmin 4 times, and nothing fixes it.

The error in /etc/httpd/logs/errro_log is:
[Thu Jul 27 14:46:55 2000] [error] [client 165.228.129.12] Premature end
of script headers: /home/httpd/cgi-bin/qmailadmin

This is the error that comes up every time I tryt to login. I don't think
there is anything wrong with the cgi file, becasue if I put in an invalid
login, the login screen pops back up saying invalid login.

Can someone help as I am really stuck with this.

I have fiddled around with permissions, ownership, directory entries and
everything I try doesn't seem to work.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me.

Kindest Regards,

--Nige
