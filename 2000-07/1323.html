&gt; And as an aside, one of the Window Managers I used to use was one

&gt; one was that it was driven by a language called WOOL, for (from
&gt; memory) Windows Object Oriented LISP.  The WM ran in about 150K
&gt; or so of memory, and everything WMish about it was completely
&gt; programmable.  Pity you had to be au fait with LISP though (it's
&gt; one of those languages that I could never get to imprint on my
&gt; brain unless I used it regularly).  In fact, I think I'll grab
&gt; me a copy and try it again, as that web site still appears up.

Sounds like sawfish, with it's own lisp-like language, except for
the running in 150k bit :)
