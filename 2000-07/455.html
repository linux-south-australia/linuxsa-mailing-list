How interesting, there seems to be some traffic on the 
citadel box today, I said. I've got a Squishdot engine
running on it, which is where Matt posted his article,
for those of you who didn't follow the link. It seems 
that at least a couple of people also looked at a post
that I had made pointing to some screenshots of Corel
PhotoPaint that I made, having downloaded the 90MB free
file.

Here's the funny thing. There are a couple of entries in
my /var/log/xferlog file, from a couple of different
caches around, but both only for the first image, which
*isn't* a screenshot. I went through and created a picture,
showing which screens I went through along the way, and
also put the final image onto the ftp site as well. If
someone was interested in screenshots, why not click on
one of the jpegs with "photopaint-ss-" in the title?

All I could think of was that citadel is on the wrong end
of a slow modem link, and maybe having downloaded the 
first image and finding it slow, they lost interest.

Anyway, if anyone there IS interested in some Corel
PhotoPaint screenshots, now that it's free for Linux, I've
put the jpegs onto a slightly higher bandwidth site :)

look at <A HREF="http://users.senet.com.au/~tommyd/ss/photopaint/">http://users.senet.com.au/~tommyd/ss/photopaint/</A>

Most are in the order of 100-200k, my X resolution is
1280x1024 :)

Cheers

Tom
