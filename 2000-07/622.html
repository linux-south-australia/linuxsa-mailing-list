You live in an idealistic world.

Try working in a corporate environment where standards (and not quality or 
price) are the main motivator.

I need to know that my girlfriend can type up her resume and have it come 
out on any printer, anywhere, any time.

I also need to know that I can read and edit documents written in a standard 
(however good or bad) that most of the world uses.

Even so, adopt standards and migration happens naturally.  People like what 
they are used to, not all people embrace rapid and dramatic change.  But if 
the interface is the same, they would not care about what is under the hood 
and think "why am I paying $$$ for that shit when this is soooooo much 
better and cheaper!!"

&gt; &gt; Why is free ($$$ and beer) so important to you?  I like free ($$$), also
&gt; &gt; as it is good for my (far too empty) wallet.
&gt;
&gt;yep, wallet (poor it student), plus free opensource is the linux way, i
&gt;figure that the more we use commercial, the more they will be inclined
&gt;to only provide commercial software.
&gt;
&gt;the way i see it is that people have been using standard unix
&gt;applications for years to write huge documents/ books, if they can do it
&gt;so can i. I would like to find out the options though.
&gt;
&gt;The responses so far to a question about Linux software have been MS
&gt;word clones. This is bad news for Linux, surely there is a Linux type
&gt;(eg free, opensource, stable, smallish footprint) program out there.
&gt;
&gt;I would prefer to learn latex than use MS Word, and I would prefer a
&gt;unix tool to a MS clone. perhaps it's just me but I am trying to move
&gt;away from MS, not parallel to it.
&gt;
&gt;Many thanks for the response
