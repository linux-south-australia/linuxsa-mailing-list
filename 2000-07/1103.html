&gt; And the sugestion I made did eveyrhting he did on the command line, it
&gt; would have found the speicifed files and caused them to be copied to a
&gt; zip cartirdge - that is what he wanted to do is it not?

No, he wanted a gui that was as easily expressive as a cli.  (He claimed
you could not make one.)  His backup example was flawed, just like a simile
which fails to make a convincing argument. :-)  Pity to denounce his theory
because of a bad example...

Had he been just a little more explicit, he might have said that he wanted
to take one incremental backup per week of all of his spreadsheets, and all
of his letters except those which he signed, "your loving husband."  The
letters which he signed "your loving husband" only need to be backed up
after 8 weeks.

In CLI: weekly cron job:

  cp `find ~ -name '*.ss' -mtime -7 -print` \
   `find ~ -name '*.ltr' -mtime -7 \( -exec tail -1 {} \|
       grep -q "your loving husband" \; -o -print \)` \
   `find ~ -name '*.ltr' -mtime -63 -mtime +56 -exec tail -1 {} \|
       grep -q "your loving husband" \; -print` \
   /mnt/zip

When you've found a widget which permits this sort of result, I'll want you
to stop backing up spreadsheets which have a net present value of less than
the mean group capitalisation unless the forwarded projected profit exceeds
the shareholder liability.  And if it doesn't run nicely on a 16MB i486 I'm
not interested.
