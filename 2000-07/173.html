Um, there doesn't have to be.  The Code simply asks that carriage
service providers make at least one filtering product available for
at least one platform, and perhaps for a fee.  "Available" can include
downloading it over the Internet.  So a link to the e-commerce part
of www.filtersRus.com is fine.

This is the joy of self-regulation.  You can take a stupid, dangerous
piece of legislation and render it useless, as long as you have the
complaisance of the administering department.

Of course, the Internet industry has also done the same with dealing
with consumer protection, so self regulation isn't all roses.

Real filters for Linux do exist -- Squid has code to allow for
huge black lists or huge white lists and this is used successfully
by education departments everywhere.  The point being not to
protect students from things they shouldn't see, but to limit
their classroom activities and use of limited bandwidth to
academically oriented sites.

For example, type "evolution" into a web server.  Note the unrelaiabilty
of most of the sites returned.
