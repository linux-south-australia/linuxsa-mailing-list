&gt; I use Outlook Express (dont laugh)...
&gt; It can only search for text in the "to" and "cc" fields for filtering.
&gt; I have found that by filtering using these two fields that only mail from
&gt; ONE single person gets by from this mailing list... and that would be you
&gt; Alex Garner!!
&gt; Its funny that your sugesting that every one else use that other filtering
&gt; method (X-Loop), when the only mail that needs it is coming from you :)

Touché to that.

It is indeed true that the only two types of annoying emails I receive from
this list are ones which don't sort into my LinuxSA mailbox, which are only
ever from Alex Garner, and secondly, those emails in which I'm in the CC
field, coz I just end up receiving two copies of a message I've already
read, and I can't specifically auto-sort one into one folder, and one into
another, because Outlook 2k is too limited.

*applause*

Incidentally, I lost my job today. Not from any fault of my own, of course,
but due to a departmental downsize, which is why I was hired in the first
place (for a departmental upsize that is). So bah! to the world, and bah to
Centrelink, of which I will be visiting once a fortnight for the next few
weeks !!
