&gt; Now, someone else can answer my question. Why did the designers of the
&gt; Unix API decide to make the programmer responsible for keeping track of
&gt; the highest file descriptor in the select fd set?

Probably the same reason they spelt creat() without an 'e'[1] (eg, they
may have been smoking something)[2].

&gt; Why doesn't the kernel do it,

Because the kernel would have to calculate it on every call, whereas
_you_ (the programmer) only have to update it when your file descriptor
set changes.  Bear in mind that on some machines the FD set can be very
large (eg AIX - 4096), so this cost would add up.

&gt; or the FD_SET macro's set a library's extern value or something?

That would mean you could only use one instance of select(), and would
turn it into a singleton.  Shades of errno and threads all over again.

&gt; Is there a reason for this?

Probably for those reasons outlined above.  poll() does away with this
by not using a set to represent file descriptors, so the limitation
probably stems from that.

[1] Brian or Dennis' chief lament with Unix, apparently.
[2] select(), from memory, is a BSDism, so this statement jars with
    reality.
