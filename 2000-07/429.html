&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to reignite the debate on certification by injecting my opinion.

What's to debate? There are different courses / certification and they
all have their good points and bad. It would all really depend on what
you were after.

&gt; However, I feel that those of us who are into certification should
&gt; demonstrate that we want an independent program that it not tied to any one
&gt; vendor, as much to demonstate that we want a vialable Linux industry out
&gt; there, not tied to any one vendor's marketing needs.

Isn't that the same with SAIR?

&gt; For that reason, I suggest that those who are interested in certification
&gt; should take the currently available LPI exams and support their aims. They
&gt; can be taken through VUE, and are relatively in-expensive.

Do you know of a single URL that shows comparisons of all Linux
certifications (pref. non-biased ;-)) ? 

Thanks,
Matt
