Hey ho,

Another issue to consider is peopel who bring machines without cases.

RAM and CPUs fit in a pcoket and are ewasily and quickly removable.

One of my brother friends had some RAM stolen at a LAN games party
recently, so perhaps there needs to be some considerationof this, perhaps
a warning sign/poster for people who bring case off PCs to be extra
careful.

It might be worth having a "secure" area where people can leave their PCs
unattended while they  watch or particiapte in non install activities.

It might also be an idea to cordon off the install area to owners and the
installers, if at all possible.

The public at lage coudl watch, but on the otyehrside of and out of
reaching distance of the installs.

Some clothesline should be adequate for this.

I have a 50 metre rope that could be used if required.

Regards
jason tan
