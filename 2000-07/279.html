Hi!

I basically have not touched anything to do with Cron until now. Cron is
on a 6.1 installation...other things have changed and chopped. Here is
what I did:

* reconfigured and ran SendMail

Basically run as a daemon and got it to deliver mail locally correctly

* started cron

I noticed a whole STACK of things going. In fact, whilst on the Internet
at about 4:00AM on Friday morning (don't ask...I just was)...I noticed
my drives absolutely whirring. I discovered the following:

* rpm -Va appears to be run at least daily
* autorpm is installed as default

And other anomalies. All installed without ASKING me whether I wanted
them to work or not.

I remember a thread which said that dpkg and it's neat update feature
was cool. autorpm doesn't AUTOMATICALLY install stuff without your
permission but it would be easy to get it to do so. Would I really want
this to do that?

I don't think so.

In fact, in my OPINION, distributors should make it clear in their
installation what cron jobs they are installing. I mean, how can one
expect a new comer to Linux (who might have turned OFF  alocal Sendmail)
to work out what cron is doing...lol....even I got caught out...it's
kinda jarring to suddenly find your system at 90% user load and hard
drives whirring at 4AM in the morning :-(

Personally, I don't think any CRON stuff should be implemented behind an
installers back. Alternatively I think one should be given a choice,
like "Your system can check to see if any installed RPM's have not been
changed on a regular basis. This basis is once per week. Shall I set
your system up so this will happen?"....
