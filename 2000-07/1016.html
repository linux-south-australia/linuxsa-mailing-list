The claim that things can be done using a CLI that cannot be done with a
GUI is patently absurd.  Just as new commands can be created, so also can
new GUI elements.  Perhaps nobody has demonstrated a usuable pipe element,
but I accept that it can be done.  For me, the question is whether a GUI
is appropriate.

Ask what makes a GUI and you might be told WIMP: Windows, Icons, Mice and
Pull-down menus.  Icons are a basic GUI element, and (along with pull-down
menus) they are the equivalents of keystrokes.  Type a command, or click
an icon: these are equivalent concepts.

Icons are, well, iconographs: pictures with a conventional significance
attached to them.  By contrast, English letters represent a phonetic
mechanism to build words.  Now a picture might be worth a thousand words,
but it only takes a few dozen unique letters to create any and all English
words.  These can expresses an infinite array of ideas, but an infinite
number of unique pictures is probably required to convey the same ideas in
iconographs.

The benefit of command lines over graphical interfaces is not what can be
expressed, but the flexibility of expression.  The converse of "a picture
is worth a thousand words" is "26 letters describes every picture."  I do
not care for a "simplified" GUI that needs "only" a few thousand icons.
