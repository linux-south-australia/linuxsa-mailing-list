Hi,

I though that I might summarize the information about sendmail and
firewalls for everyone's edification.

My questions and searching was based on a desire to simplify the sendmail
setup at a customer site.  The environment at this site goes along the lines:


[Big Bad Internet]-----[Firewall]-----[Internal Mail Hub]

There is an MX record pointing to the firewall for the domain behind it,
some.com.au.  The firewall accepts all mail and forwards most of it to the
internal mail hub machine, pop.some.com.au, which has a private IP address.

The internal mail hub, pop.some.com.au, receives all mail sent by internal
clients and sends it to the firewall for sending to the BBI.

The configuration that needs to be done can be restricted to the redhat.mc
file that will be found in /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf if you have installed
the sendmail-cf RPM for a RedHat or Mandrake distro, and possibly for other
distros.

You should copy the redhat.mc to your own name, like local.mc and then
modify it.

FIREWALL

On the firewall, you may not need to modify the redhat.mc file that comes
with the machine, in which case you can run with the sendmail.cf file
installed by default.

You will need to set up the following files:

/etc/mail/access   -  Controls which machines can relay through you.
                      You would put your internal mail hub's address in 
                      here.

/etc/sendmail.cw   - Controls the names that you accept mail for. You would
                     put your domain name in here, some.com.au, as well
                     as any other names your system is known by. This will
                     prevent the infamous MX record points back to me
                     problems.

/etc/mail/mailertable - Here you would put a single rule to route mail
                        for your domain to the internal mail hub. Eg,

 		   	      some.com.au	   esmtp:[pop.some.com.au]

                	    You need to run makemap on this file for sendmail
			    to use it:

				makemap hash mailertable &lt; mailertable

/etc/hosts		- Put the name pop.some.com.au in here along with
			  its internal IP address, eg 192.168.1.2.


INTERNAL MAIL HUB

On the internal mail hub, you will probably need to add the nocanonify
feature to your mc file, as well as specify a smart host. Simply add the
following somewhere near the bottom of the mc file you are creating:

  FEATURE(`nocanonify')

run m4 to create your sendmail.cf:

  m4 local.mc &gt; local.cf

Copy it to /etc and add the smart host entry. To add the smart host entry,
look for the DS entry early on in your sendmail.cf file. Simply add the
name of your smart host, ie:

  DSexternal.some.com.au

and make sure that your hosts file has the name of this system in it.

You will also have to add the name of the systems that relay through you if
you are using PCs to send mail to /etc/mail/access and rebuild the access
db file. For example:

   192.168.1 relay

and then run makemap on it

   makemap hash access &lt; access

DISCLAIMER

I trust all these things are correct, and if not, I will be quickly corrected.
