There are a couple of photos of that arrangement on my website, in case
they're useful for any articles...

 &gt; Of course, there's also the exotic, high-end, rare, odd and old hardware
 &gt; that appeared. We had an SGI Indy, an Alpha workstation, numerous Sun
 &gt; SPARCs, a dual PIII-550 with 512MB RAM and a 4x18Gb SCSI-160 RAID 5, Leigh
 &gt; Hart's Mother of all cases on wheels, at least one Mac, a large flat-screen
 &gt; LCD display, and a (surely) historically signifigant x86 (386?) Micro in an
 &gt; enormous case, with 2MB RAM and 80MB Hard disk. My wild guestimate was that
 &gt; we had well over $300,000 worth of hardware in attendance.

I didn't see most of that.  Did the Indy get successfully installed, or
is that one for Tuesday? :-)

 &gt; Of course, there's the Pizza lunch that didn't happen :) -- sorry about that
 &gt; for those who were hanging out for it. I ended up with a cold Aussie Burger
 &gt; (barf) and fries... Better than nothing, but of dubious nutritional value.

The Lunch Stop opposite Ngapartji is far better than HJ's, IMHO :-)

 &gt; I also had someone emailing me from Texas asking to come...
 &gt; Then there was the person who flew down from whyalla specifically for the
 &gt; installfest -- he landed at about 8am, and left at about 2pm :)

He wasn't the only one.  I spoke to people from Port Pirie and Broken
Hill too.  How many other people travelled large distances to come?

     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
