Paul!

&gt; Of the three SQL databases around (PostgreSQL, mySQL and mSQL), which
&gt; would be the easiest to install, setup and run?  (I know a few SQL
&gt; commands and did about 2-3 months Perl coding last year, so the idea of
&gt; programming and scripting doesn't overwhelm me.)

This is the subject which creates religious wars. If you are looking for
ease of use I would suggest mySQL. It is very easy to setup, very easy
to use and very powerful in its own way. You can get the latest copy
from:

<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</A>

Whilst the "stable" version is not GPL, you can use it for free for most
purposes. The newer versions will be GPL compatible. If you don't know
what the "GPL" is about see <A HREF="http://www.freesoftware.org/">http://www.freesoftware.org/</A>

I suggest mySQL because:

* it is very easy to set up
* it has a lot of easy-to-use documentation
* it has a significantly busy mailing list (like one gets mail at the
rate of about 1 per five minutes)
* it is, in its own way, very efficient

PostGres, on the other hand, is just as good - and some would say a
better - database system, but it lacks a sensible HOWTO [incidentally,
before someone takes me to task, there was a recent discussion at
<A HREF="mailto:lpd@lists.debian.org">lpd@lists.debian.org</A> which essentially said that the PostGresql howto
was utter bollocks and totally useless; those who answered from the
PostGres team themselves admitted it needed rewriting].

&gt; What will I be doing with the database?  Actually, it's just a learning
&gt; project to become more familiar with databases generally.

Start up with what you feel comfortable with. Thee is a new riders book,
author's surname of DuBois called "MySQL". I got it from the Bookshelf
(<A HREF="http://www.thebookshelf.com.au/">http://www.thebookshelf.com.au/</A>) in Adelaide...
