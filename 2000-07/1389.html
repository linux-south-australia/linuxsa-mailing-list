Alan!

I'm not altogether certain exactly what you are replying to. I shall try
to get the matter straight.

&gt; Words like "downside" and "risk" come immediately to mind.

At the moment we are *all* going at risk individually. There is noone to
pursue except each and every individual.

&gt; If someone's going to accept contracts on behalf of a bunch
&gt; of other people, then you want to make sure that everyone is
&gt; comfortable with that.

That is the reason for a properly constituted constitution. It's why the
Office of Business and Consumer Affairs uses trained lawyers to ensure
that the constitution is properly written; you submit it to them after a
meeting of stakeholders have approved the draft document.

&gt; I'm a beginner at these things, but it seems to me that
&gt; an incorporated organisation (such as a suburban choir
&gt; or table tennis club) has unlimited liability.

I disagree. If you are a prescribed association according to the
Incorporations Associations Act 1993 as amended then the committee
members must:

* cause accounts conforming to the relevant acccounting standard to be
kept
* cause those accounts to be audited by an auditor
* cause all these documents to be sent to OBCA
* act with due diligence in the running of the organisation

Whether they can make contracts or such on behalf of the members is a
matter for the constitution. Some constitutions, for example, say that
you can spend up to $500 on petty items, but you must have an
Extraordinary General Meeting of AGM to spend more than that at one
single time. That's something that we as a group would have to discuss.

Furthermore, committee members who don't act with due diligence could be
sued individually and face up to $10 000 fine (or more) and/or
imprisonment. Honestly, provided you attend meetings, actually read the
financial reports and most importantly act scrupulously honest this
section is almost never invoked. Due diligence doesn't mean "oh my God,
that was unforseeable, now they can get me". It means that if you SEE
the treasurer writing checks to himself and DO nothing, then...

&gt; If debts etc. can't be serviced, then all members are
&gt; responsible for that debt etc. Suppose someone breaks their
&gt; legs at a meeting?

That is a very good question. At the moment we are ALL liable. An
incorporated association, being a legal entity in its own right, would
also be liable, but not each individual member. The Act states that in
the event of an insolvency - which I suggest such a disaster would cause
- the possessions of the association shall be distributed pursuant to
the Act by a qualified accountant. That accountant would take into
account any LEGAL directions in the constitution - for example, we could
say (in plain English), "if there's any money/assets left over give them
to SLUG Inc NSW".

&gt; Is a pty/ltd company maybe the right structure?

No. A pty/ltd company requires too much capital per year to run, has too
many legal requirements and besides, LinuxSA isn't a business. We are an
organisation of enthusiasts who enjoy being together for information
sharing, social occassions and other such matters.

&gt; I've just (extremely unwisely) created two of them
&gt; in the last few months. All the ABN/GST rigmarole has
&gt; to be done for an incorporated organisation anyway, I think.

Again. I don't believe this is true. Organisations AND individuals or
entities who earn less than $50 000 don't even have to register such
things. They do pay GST, but they don't charge GST...

&gt; So one might as well pay one's $690 to create the company,
&gt; get some public liability insurance ($400?) etc., and have the whole
&gt; hog - directors, shares, annual meetings, accounts, etc. etc.

Or $125, a constitution that is written by our members and owned by our
members.

&gt; I propose that any executive decisions (contracts, expenditures, IPOs etc.)
&gt; should be publicised on the mailing list, and that any 10 shareholders
&gt; with &gt;= 10% of the total shares should be able to start a flame war.

&gt; As far as I know, shareholders have no liabilities for company debts.
&gt; They just lose their 10 cents.
&gt; The directors are just obliged to make sure all the paperwork is done,
&gt; and ASIC is notified as soon as bankruptcy is evident.

Members of an association have NO liability at all provided the
association is run in a diligent fashion.

(now, I'm not sure how "serious" Alan's reply was but alas....)
