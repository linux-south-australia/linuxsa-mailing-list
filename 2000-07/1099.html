Davud!

&gt; &lt;cough&gt; My hovercraft is full of eels

Eeels? How pleasant...

&gt; Your point was that 16000 icons would be hard to recognise and remember,
  ^^^^^^^^^^ (someone else's)

&gt; The other point is that for a set of n commands, there would be a fraction
&gt; of n GUIs as most GUIs will merge the functionality of several commands
&gt; into the GUI.

Well, if one takes language as CLI and sight as GUI, that's
debatable....unless you are Bill Gates when there really IS one GUI...

&gt; and if you want to extend past that role, you generally are stuck. A CLI
&gt; is generally not nearly as friendly or well presented, but is great for
&gt; taking data, and piping it around, and also has advantages like no needing
&gt; a graphics card, or as much memory.

Friendly and well presented is a relative thing, my boy. CLI via
terminals and keyboards must be much easier than using punch cards.
GUI's can sometimes be easier than CLI. In the future, no doubt,
"thinking" commands directly to the computer will be even easier than
WIMP...

&gt; Ultimately I think this can go in the class of distribution wars. It comes
&gt; down to personal taste as to which you prefer.

Yes, I think it can too...rofl

Obscurity is not what we need. Stand up. Be counted.
