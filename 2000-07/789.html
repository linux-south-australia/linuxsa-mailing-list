That's my view. For me, a gui feeds a bash script. 

You could also say command line is never as powerful as C (or perl). It's in
the presentation of options that dialog boxes shine. They are closely coupled
to the underlying code. If the option aint there , you can't use it. This is
not the same as a command line which rarely stays in lock-step with it's man
page. You never really know whether a) the option has been deprecated (if you
can discover it) and b) what new options have been put in that aren't
documented. The biggest winner is a radio button is self dodumenting,
you aren't left wondering what an obscure -Uvh actually does.

Secondly, the punch comes when you execute 'OK'. The underlying script (if
that's what is is), is very much command line and offers all the power of the
command line that you ever really needed.

&gt;Perhaps we should also get rid of two  mice buttons

I am curerently using a four, yes, four button mouse with two wheels. I have to
ask myself how stupid is that? Why don't i just put some rollers on my
keyboard. I've lost the plot as to what my pointing device is supposed to do
for me and turned it into a not so useful, something else.
