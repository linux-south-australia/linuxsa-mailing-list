Thanks Mike,

That answers my questions and confirms what I already knew.

Was I mistaken or did Glen talk about placing the swap partition at the 
middle of the disk for better performance?

&gt; &gt; Hi Guys
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is only an observation and open to correction if need be.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; How can anyone say they put their swap partition in the middle of an ide 
&gt; &gt; hard drive? There are only a couple of platters in them and a maximum of 
&gt; &gt; 4 heads. This would max out the number of cylinders to a couple of 
&gt; &gt; thousand. They use translation of some description and have more 
&gt; &gt; 'logical' heads and less 'logical' cylinders.
&gt; 
&gt; The physical geometry of any drive, Scsi, or IDE, is impossible to establish.
&gt; The C/H/S geometry used in addressing schemes bears no relationship to reality.
&gt; 
&gt; For instance, drives have many more sectors out the 'outside' of the platter
&gt; than the inside, making a mockery of 64 sectors per track.
&gt; 
&gt; At one point manufacturers placed the beginning of the drive viz 0/0/0 in the
&gt; CENTRE. This, because OS's like windows placed their most accessed area, the
&gt; directories, at the 'beginning' of the drive, and hence some speed improvements
&gt; occurred exponentially to the hype.
&gt; 
&gt; the 'middle' of the drive, as per your question would, obviously, be the logical
&gt; place to plunk the most accessed area. Swap? Perhaps, but that depends on
&gt; whether you have a lot of ram memory (in which case, swap aint necessarily used
&gt; at all). Bottom line, neither you nor I know where the 'middle' of the drive
&gt; is, it changes on each model from the same oem.
&gt; 
&gt; The 2nd part of your question presumes that 4 heads aint sufficient, That's
&gt; fine, but that has to be tempered by the real size of the sectors per track
&gt; under those heads. Again, neither you nor i know. As for heads, well ok, many
&gt; drives only have four some only use two, but the drive itself can report it has
&gt; 256 heads if the oem feels like it's a good thing on Wednesday. No, I am not
&gt; talking about the bios reporting 256 heads, the drive, via it's ide / scsi
&gt; interface can lie like hell if the oem feels it's a good thing (tm).
&gt; 
&gt; finally, you are presuming a head only reads one data track. firstly,
&gt; physically, you can have multi cored heads (generally separated by 10 or more
&gt; track widths). Secondly, depending on the technology used, the coil head can
&gt; read different density layers , and / or different recording formats on the
&gt; same track! (IBM)
&gt; 
&gt; As if this weren't enough, it is the oem who decides the interleaving factor of
&gt; his drive. Logical sector n+1 is inevetibly not next to logical sector n. It is
&gt; somewhere further down the track (pun intended) depending on expected delivery
&gt; (bandwidth). And, track n+1 is rarely adjacent to track n (as per the multi
&gt; coils above).
&gt; 
&gt; To cut this long story short, second guessing the physical makeup of any modern
&gt; hard disk is an excercise in futility and any software that 'fine tunes' as
&gt; such will break on the next model from the very same oem.
&gt; 
&gt; None of this is scsi vs ide (atapi) related, they both come out of the same
&gt; machine, the interface changes to suit the order. So much so, that the only
&gt; difference between current 8 10 and 13 gig drives is the definition placed in
&gt; the microchips on the drive. An 8gig drive IS a fully functional 13gig but
&gt; crippled and sold as is because there's a market out there for a 'cheaper'
&gt; alternative!
