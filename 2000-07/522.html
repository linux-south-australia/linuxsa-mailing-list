&gt; Ah well there we go with terminology, what Alex was asking about (I think)
&gt; is the usage of the word 'client'. Receiving email from a client is a bit of
&gt; a problem. Receiving from a mail server is more accurate.
&gt; 
&gt; Whereas Adam corrects the statement to show server and attempts to answer
&gt; Alex's question, but in fact doesn't answer the asked question which is "How
&gt; does Yahoo mail receive from the email client (netscape
&gt; messenger/kmail/etc)".
&gt; 
&gt; There could be a follow on like "I wrote my own client, so how does Yahoo
&gt; mail know about that one ????"
&gt; 
&gt; Just my opinion and hopefully I am interpreting what Alex was asking (though
&gt; asking is not really the word when ending the statement with !?)

Yes you were correct. I knew what the person meant, but I was being
anal. My many mentors over the years have done this exact thing to me
and I thank them for it. It is the best way to learn the terminology.
The biggest disadvantage semi-computer-literate people have when
trying to explain a problem to a computer-literate person is not
knowing the terms. Ask any help-desk employee.

I find that if you simply correct someone they say "whatever", but if
you act dumb, they go out of their way to grasp the correct word, and
you both win. :o)

You gotta be cruel to be kind! lol

Cheers

Alex!
