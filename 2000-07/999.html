The constipated view says, "We don't  dare make useable, productive tools,
because perhaps, maybe, it limits our 'expressiveness'. Or if we DO make
something useful, it won't be any good because it doesn't take into account ALL
of our requirements. So we just mildew away using the same dreadful cli
commands as if they were mandatory to the end user. But cli is so powerful,
hell, it must be good for you. So are laxatives.

If you take your argument to it's logical conclusion, we should all be using C,
not a CLI because it is only C that can give us everything we don't know we
need. 

The answer to your specific example is you write script (a CLI in other words)
and it is fed from and to a gui. Hell, even make xconfig runs that way. I
don't look at tk script to recompile Linux.  I look at options and modules i
want.

Again, with your example, as more 'features' are required, you write more gui
wrappers backed by script until it becomes silly. At that time, you encompass
all the special one off gui apps into a single one. Of course you write cli
code, but just like my underwear, I don't expect Joe Public to have to see it.
Joe public want's his zip stuff saved, he does not want to
know that it's on a parallel port running a psuedo scsi emulation and can only
work if he mounts his /usr directory, and the scanner must not be active and he
should have checked first with a ps xa to see if the lpdaemon was idle. BLECH.
He doesn't need to know this stuff, and I dont want to know, I should not have
to remember all this nonsense each time I try and use an application. 
Why? Because as limited as they are, guis perform
the same action each time every time, in the correct sequence. Sans typos and
Sans 'oh sh*t' i'm in the wrong directory. It's in your face, set, and go. Not
type this wait for that, type again, wait again, type again, ,,whoops.

You are looking at the 'problem' from the other side of the mirror. Instead of
looking for reasons how a gui doesn't apply, it is (and will be) far more
productive to see how a gui could, might, maybe and  perhaps, be applied  ( a
bit of lateral thinking). When extra requirments come in, i add another radio
button. I don't tell my user to grep an awk with less. And my users
incidentally know more than I ever will about bash syntax, one of them helped
write csh.

I don't make claims that Visual Basic, or Office 97 is just wonderful. But, the
methods used in drag and dropping components is where the future will be. You
can be as certain of that as the sun coming up. It's called authoring rather
than programming and it empowers users, not programmers.

Using an authoring gui you simply connect the functionality that you require.
It's nothing radically different to ls -la | grep 'thingo' &gt; somewhere. Instead
of using these perfectly ridiculous names (and arbitrary option grammar), you
use applets and connect the functionality visually. This, ultmitately answers
your example and is most certainly where the future lies. In fact, expermental
work with Kdevelop is already taking place with this 'visual presentation' of
the standard  commands, it has a long way to go, but this is the 21st century,
not 1970.
