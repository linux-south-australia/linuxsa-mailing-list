Alex Garner spake...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't most other major mailing lists put a [LISTNAME] prefix onto
&gt; &gt; their subject lines?  It would solve more than one person's problem
&gt; &gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; As previously mentioned, we already have solved the problem with the
&gt; X-Loop: header. As previously mentioned, it is only one or two cases
&gt; where filtering this is not possible, that is not the rest of the
&gt; list's problem.

Oh right ok.  Fair enough.

So - list - are there only one or two of you out there who have troubles
filtering out linuxsa email based on a header called 'X-Loop'?
 
&gt; &gt; Is there a reason that the LinuxSA admins haven't made this happen,
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is just that. A subject. If you want to know what mailing
&gt; list the mail comes from, look at the X-Mailing-List: header. That is
&gt; what is is there for.

Right - after that paragraph - assuming that X-Mailing-List: is a standard (or
psuedo-standard?) mail header, and I'm sure it would be - if your email client
does not allow filtering by that header, you have a crap email client and the
list shouldn't be changed to suit you.  IMHO.  I'm now going to change my
procmail recipe to look at X-Mailing-List: instead of From:.

gggqG

&gt; &gt; or is it just a whim thing?  And I'm not wanting to start the usual
&gt; &gt; flame war..  just asking out of interest :o)
&gt; 
&gt; As previously mentioned, "the usual flame war" is currently playing at
&gt; www.linuxsa.org.au in Dolby Digital(R). It looks like fliming for the
&gt; latest one has started already.

Excellent  *buys opera glasses*
