The attached HTML document is my attempt at summarising these two
operating systems. If you have corrections or suggestions please send
them to me as diffs against this attachment (using the diff -u command)

Richard, maybe this is suitable for inclusion as a tip/hint for the
Installfest (incidentally the submission page on rebel doesn't work.)

<BODY>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Linux and FreeBSD, Open Source
Giants</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">According to the Internet Operating
System Counter, as of April 1999 45% of the world's network
connected machines run either Linux or BSD, and this figure appears
to be growing. Best estimates are that outside the Internet there are
perhaps 15 million computers running free operating systems, mainly
Linux. So what exactly are these successful operating
systems?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>UNIX Core Technology</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The kernel (or core) components are
UNIX-compatible. If an application runs on commercial UNIX such as
Sun Solaris or Hewlett Packard's HP-UX, then it will probably run on Linux and
BSD. In fact Linux has achieved such a presence that applications are
often ported to it before UNIX, or even developed on Linux in the
first place.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Linux is a completely new
implementation of the UNIX standards, started in Finland in 1992.
Linux has succeeded where commercial UNIX failed for more than ten
years, in bridging the gap between the technical capabilities of UNIX
and the expectations of users brought up in the age of PCs. Linux has
good multimedia support and integrates well with Microsoft and other
operating systems.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">BSD stands for ``Berkeley Software
Distribution''.  Its source code can be directly traced back to UNIX
of the early 1980s. From a technical viewpoint, this makes BSD genuine
UNIX rather than a clone, though BSD does not have the right to
the UNIX trademark.  The original implementation of the Internet
protocols (TCP/IP) was developed on BSD, and the BSD networking stack,
continuously worked on for twenty years, is very highly regarded for
its stability.  BSD is the most popular operating system for the 100
busiest websites in the world, far ahead of Linux in this area.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>The Rest of the OS</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Linux and BSD kernels need
applications to run in order to be useful. The central group of key
applications for both contains many contributions from the GNU Free
Software Project. The kernel and these key applications <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">are
what enables the operating systems to perform useful work. There are 
some differences in the administrative interfaces for BSD and Linux.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">The applications
that are typically run on these operating systems are identical
between Linux and BSD, such as graphical user interfaces, web
servers, mail servers, file servers. There are about ten thousand
open source packages.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Versions, Versions...</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Because the full source code is
available to anyone for modification there have been numerous
instances of groups taking the source code and packaging it up in a
way that they like better. This doesn't mean that they are
incompatible (the same UNIX programs still run just as well on all
Linux and BSD distributions) but they are packaged for users with
different goals such as security, speed, ease of use, Asian languages
and so on.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are only three open source BSD distributions,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. They are all extremely similar in terms
of the user experience, and none of them have the ease-of-use
emphasis that many Linux distributions have. <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">http://www.freebsd.org/</A>
is the most popular site for information about the BSDs. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are many more Linux
distributions, at least twenty major ones including Debian, Mandrake,
SuSE, Red Hat, TurboLinux. Commercial support for Linux is available
from many hundreds of companies.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Which is better, BSD or Linux?</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Both :-) Microsoft has showed us what
happens if too much reliance is placed on any one operating system.
BSD and Linux complement one another. The developers of each monitor
the other with a view to improving their own product. Many companies
find that the mainstream support for Linux with a choice of training,
distribution supply, support and other amenities make it a sure bet.
A smaller number with specific needs or staff with BSD experience
have used BSD to great effect.</P>
