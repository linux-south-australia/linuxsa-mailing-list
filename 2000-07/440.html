I'd recommend Debian.  Why, well because that's what I use:-) But
seriously, it does have the best package management software of any
distribution (except for those distributions which are basically a
modified Debian anyway).  And it is the most stable distribution.
They are a bit slow in making stable releases (a new one comes out
roughly once every 18 months or so), but when they do come out, they
are very well tested.  And if you need cutting edge stuff, you can
always install those bits from unstable.  I'm currently running the
"potato" version of Debian, which is close to being released as
stable, but not quite there (it's currently in a "frozen" state, which
is half way between stable and unstable).

Apart from the technical merits of Debian, I like it because it is a
"not for profit organization", which means it is easier for me to
contribute back to the linux community through it.  Anyway, I don't
think there's a huge amount in it between the distributions, but my
vote is for Debian.


&gt; Ahem,
&gt; 	I hope I will not start a war with this question :)
&gt; 
&gt; 	I am about to set up a small network (1 server/6-7 workstations) with
&gt; 	Linux on the server, and a combination of windoze and linux on the
&gt; 	workstations.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The question I want to ask is which is the best distribution for the 
&gt; 	server ? I was simply going to install RedHat 6.2 and tweak it
&gt; 	according to my needs, but there now appears to be a plethora
&gt; 	of options available (e.g. Mandrake, Turbolinux), and I thought
&gt; 	I'd seek opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; 	It is a commercial environment. The server does file serving, intranet,
&gt; 	database handling (small amounts), firewalling to internet, fax serving,
&gt; 	and anything else I can think of later :)
&gt; 
&gt; 	thanks for any help
&gt; 	ted
