Hi There!

It would certainly help if we and all the Linux user groups stood as an
entity in their own right. An umbrella group that could sanely, sensibly
and credibly deal with the government departments, their ministers and
politicians would certainly help. Unfortunately, politicians do not
recognise non-legal entities and give them as much value as legal
entities.

The discussion(s) about how we could become incorporated are progressing
but I am not quite able to inform everyone about what has been
happening. I guess you'll just have to trust David Newall, Geoffrey
Bennet and myself.

 Once the flash and the fantasy grow cold
 That her stars did not allow here to grow old
 But I, I would tell you what to say.
