&gt; I'm sorry, but where is it decreed that a GUI may not use 'plain 
&gt; english' to label commands, in favour of icons?

I'm unsure quite how you mean "label commands."  Perhaps you mean commands
which appear in menus should be in plain English, and they should and are.
I don't think a menu, or even menu hierarchy, is a likely replacement for
a shell.  Perhaps you mean that icons can or should have labels.  That also
seems reasonable, although when an icon represents a command in a program
(as opposed to a file), it seems that the current fashion is not to label
it.  (Those hateful little pop-up tool-tips are what people seem to use.)

My example was intended to illustrate that a picture is not always the best
way to describe what you want to do.  Imagine, if you would, having to find
the particular picture that represents a photo album.  I showed two that
you might have to choose between, but there likely are a lot more.  I
didn't show the "email face database", nor the "company personnel list",
nor the "video conference program," nor any of the hundreds or thousands of
quite different commands which might sensibly use a face as an icon.
How about the "printed page" icon that Micosoft use to represent a text
document; and the "printed page" icon that Corell use to represent a
text document: add the emacs and the pico and the n-ty other manufacturers
who all want to represent a text document, and I think it's easy to see
how an iconic interface would be confusing.

I contend that for a certain class of problem, such as the ones I just
alluded to, a CLI is better than a GUI.  The more things that you try to
iconify, the stronger my argument becomes.  It's okay if the only major
commands you have are "word processing", "spread sheet" and "shutdown", but
I think it's understood we're discussing general command lines on general
purpose computers, where the number of major command numbers a thousand or
more.

I have no problem with the concept that a GUI can be used to express what
you want to do.  I can imagine: click on data file, right click on sort
icon, select sort criteria in popup dialogue, right click on pattern match
icon, enter regular expression in popup dialogue, right click on field
selection icon, enter the fields you want to keep in popup dialogue, right
click on counting icon, select "count lines" on the popup dialogue, right
click on conditional expression icon, select "if input &gt; n" and type n in
popup dialogue, and so on.  Great, there's an off-the-top-of-the-head idea
for a GUI replacement to the shell.  I cannot imagine finding any of these
icons from a list of the thousand or so that I would need.  Icons are just
too easily confused with each other.  I have trouble discriminating between
a Microsoft internet mail icon and a Microsoft fax mail icon, and that's on
a system that has only a couple of dozen commands.
