Hi Kim (+ list)

&gt; the code was written here, but i get anoying message when i try to link it
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:kim@bakunin">kim@bakunin</A> ~/scorer_original]$ g++ -lm scorer.o protein.o ligand.o
&gt; interact.o -o scorer
&gt; ligand.o(.data+0x0): multiple definition of `fp_lig'
&gt; scorer.o(.data+0x0): first defined here
&gt; collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
&gt; 
&gt; the fp lig is declared and used in both the scorer.c and the ligand.c. It
&gt; used to be in the header but this caused probelms so i moved it to the
&gt; code where it was used.

Your main problem, I think, is that you should be using header files, 
and iron out the problems, rather than hack it with multiple 
declarations.  

It is important to think about the semantics of what you want; do 
you want just one variable (accessed by both .c files), or two sepeartae
varaibles which happen to be called the same name?  In other words
do you want the ligand.c code to see changes in fp_lig made by
code in scorer.c, or do you want them to each have their own copy.

Basically if you want seperate variables called the same name
you need the static reserved word.  If you want only one
variable accessed from many .c files you need to use extern.

I'm assuming that you want only one instance (i.e. a change to one
is reflected in a change to the other):
 
&gt; this code will run as is, but how does one force the g++ linker to ignore
&gt; multiple definitions?

The answer is to change your code so it is unambigious to 
the linker.  You should declare your fp_lig symbol with the extern 
in all but _one_ of your .c files, for example:

in ligand.c:
int fp_lig;

in scorer.c
extern int fp_lig;


I'll assume you have a setup similar to this small example:

//main.cc
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int symbol;

void increment(void);

int main(int argc, char* argv)
{
    symbol = 0;
    increment();
    printf("symbol == %d\n", symbol);

    return 0;
}

//other.cc
int symbol;

void increment(void)
{
    ++symbol;
}

then quite rightly when you compile the linker complains that
it has two symbols called the same name:

linux:dizzy ~/linking &gt; g++ main.cc other.cc
/tmp/ccMF1POk.o(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `symbol'
/tmp/ccHtxczL.o(.bss+0x0): first defined here
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


If you change int symbol to extern int symbol in other.cc then
everything
is ok:
linux:dizzy ~/linking &gt; g++ main.cc other.cc
linux:dizzy ~/linking &gt; ./a.out 
symbol == 1

See how the ++symbol on other.cc has caused the value
printed from main.cc to be 1.

You can see what is going on by using nm:
linux:dizzy ~/linking &gt; nm -C main.o other.o

main.o:
00000000 ? __FRAME_BEGIN__
         U increment(void)
00000000 T main
         U printf
00000000 B symbol

other.o:
00000000 ? __FRAME_BEGIN__
00000000 T increment(void)
         U symbol

see how 'symbol' is defined as B in main.o (B means it's in the BSS
section, 
so it's a real symbol), and as 'U' in other.o (U means undefined in
terms
of this object file).  btw the -C option to nm tells it to demangle
the symbol names (a technical c++ ism).

This is a bit of a hack.  A much better solution is to use header files,
but you need to be very careful in doing so.  Here is a fist go,
maybe this is what was causing problems before.

//header.hh
int symbol.h
void increment(void);

//other.cc
#include "header.hh"
void increment(void)
{
    ++symbol;
}


//main.cc
#include "header.hh"

int main(...
  &lt;as before&gt;

This is no good, because whenever gcc sees #include it simply
inserts the text into the file at that point

linux:dizzy ~/linking &gt; g++ main.cc other.cc
/tmp/cc0gCIXV.o(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `symbol'
/tmp/ccWR6r2X.o(.bss+0x0): first defined here
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


One typical problem is that when you do a #include, the compiler inserts
the text from the relevant header file in place.  So when you compile
the
two source files including the same header, you have the same problem as 
before; the same symbol defined twice.  You can see this clearly by
using
the -E flag to gcc:

linux:dizzy ~/linking &gt; gcc -E other.cc
# 1 "other.cc"

# 1 "header.hh" 1

int symbol;

void increment(void);

# 2 "other.cc" 2


extern int symbol;

void increment(void)
{
    ++symbol;
}

-E tells gcc to stop after the preprocessor stage so you can see what
the compiler is really looking at as input.  This version of the header
file therefore has exactly the same problem as before in terms of two
definition of the same symbol.

You should _awlays_ put a check at the top of header files for multiple
includes.  this makes sure that the preprocess will only insert one
copy of the code into compilation.
//header.hh
#ifndef _header_
#define _header_

int symbol;
void increment(void);

#endif

This won't fix your problem however, because there is still a problem
at link time.  The best thing to do is to write a new .cc file and
put the variable in there, and have extern in your header file,
like this:

//header.hh
#ifndef _header_
#define _header_
extern int symbol;
void increment(void);
#endif

//header.cc
int symbol;

//other.cc
#include "hedaer.hh"
void increment(void) { ++symbol; }

//main.cc
#incude &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "header.hh"
int main(...
  &lt;as before&gt;

This compiles and runs fine, if you want there to be only one acutal
variable.  If you want two seperate variables (so which other.cc
increments
symbol it updates it's own local copy) you need the static keywoard.

You no longer need header.cc to provide space for the variable, and 
header.hh should change like this:
//header.hh
static int symbol;
void increment(void);

The static keywoard in C (and C++) is a little tricky in this
context.  When a static variable is defined _inside a function_
it means that there "is only one instance".  So if you have
void foo(void) 
{
    static int x = 0;
    printf("%d ", ++x);
}

and call it multiple times you will get the output 1 2 3 4 5, 
the value is "saved" between calls.  But when you define a 
variable in public scope (outside a function) then static
means "keep it local"

so if you have
//other.cc
static int symbol;
void increment(void) { ++symbol; }


//main.cc
static int symbol;
void increment(void);

int main() {
    symbol = 0;
    increment();
    printf("%d\n", symbol);
    return 0;
}

and compile and run, you will get 0 as output.  The ++symbol in
increment applys to its local copy only.

I apoligise to the length of this message...

Cheers,

DG.
