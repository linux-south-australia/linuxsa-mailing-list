My first reaction to this is "holy Moses!" - and I'm not
even a religiously minded person.
Words like "downside" and "risk" come immediately to mind.

If someone's going to accept contracts on behalf of a bunch
of other people, then you want to make sure that everyone is
comfortable with that.

I'm a beginner at these things, but it seems to me that
an incorporated organisation (such as a suburban choir
or table tennis club) has unlimited liability.
If debts etc. can't be serviced, then all members are
responsible for that debt etc. Suppose someone breaks their
legs at a meeting? 

Is a pty/ltd company maybe the right structure?
I've just (extremely unwisely) created two of them
in the last few months. All the ABN/GST rigmarole has
to be done for an incorporated organisation anyway, I think.
So one might as well pay one's $690 to create the company,
get some public liability insurance ($400?) etc., and have the whole
hog - directors, shares, annual meetings, accounts, etc. etc.

We could create 100 shares at 10 cents each for each "member",
or something like that. 
We could even have an IPO and all have a nice holiday in Bali
with the profits.
We might even get the free $200 to "upgrade" our systems to the GST.

Now a company like this would really be able to get contracts,
e.g. to port tax software.
If someone has the ability to get an ACN, and ABN, a TFN etc.,
this engenders respect in the industry.
After all, filling out forms requires many of the same skills
as software development.

I propose that any executive decisions (contracts, expenditures, IPOs etc.)
should be publicised on the mailing list, and that any 10 shareholders
with &gt;= 10% of the total shares should be able to start a flame war.
As far as I know, shareholders have no liabilities for company debts.
They just lose their 10 cents.
The directors are just obliged to make sure all the paperwork is done,
and ASIC is notified as soon as bankruptcy is evident.

Just a thought.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

The fact that other states don't seem to have incorporated into
companies (or have they?) is not a reason not to do it.
This would make us a "leader" again. (I.e. a muggins.)
