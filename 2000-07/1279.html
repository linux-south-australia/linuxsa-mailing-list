&gt;&gt; ... one reason for blocking ICMP echo or reply at

&gt;
&gt;Surely this could be solved better by blocking incoming packets that
&gt;appear to originate from your network and incoming packets that are
&gt;destined to any broadcast address(es)?

Detecting incoming packets that are destined to broadcast addresses is
hard. Without the netmask, you cannot tell if the address is broadcast or
not. So, you cannot do this unless you know the broadcast addresses of all
downstream networks. Similarly, checking for incoming packets where the
source address is a broadcast address is hard.

A known attack (SMURF ?) involves sending an ICMP echo to, say, your
address with the source address being someone else's broadcast address.
IMO, you cannot protect against these with either of the two checks you
have defined.

&gt;You could also block outgoing packets that do not appear to be from you
&gt;network(s), and prevent your network(s) being a source of this problem
&gt;too :-)

Yes, and you should do this, but you can't prevent yourself being used to
attack a third party using a spoofed source broadcast address.
