&gt;&gt; Strange.  Yes, you're right.  And neither of my Latin dictionaries
&gt;&gt; state the plural, only that the genitive singular is viri, which
&gt;&gt; suggests it's still 2nd declension.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; This suggests that it is 3rd declension, in which case
&gt;&gt;&gt; its plural would be "vira"!!!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, the third declension never has nominative plural in -a.  In fact,
&gt;&gt; the only other declension with nominative singular in -us (long u, as
&gt;&gt; in Jesus) is the 4th, and it doesn't have any neuter form.  I think
&gt;&gt; this must be an irregular 2nd declension noun, in which case it's
&gt;&gt; difficult to guess what the plural is.
&gt;
&gt; I think you're wrong there.
&gt; My latin grammar book has 3 sub-groups under the
&gt; third declension. Your comments apply only to the first form.
&gt; I'm aware of the standard 4th declension nouns in -us
&gt; which you're talking about. It's obviously not 4th.

I retract that claim.  Yes, there are nouns in the 3rd which end in
-us.

&gt; I'm away from my dictionary and grammar book right now.
&gt; But I think that onus was one of the 3rd declension
&gt; nouns in -us.
&gt; Then oneri is the genitive, and onera is the plural.
&gt; But virus already ends in -rus, i.e. the stem ends in -r.
&gt; So the -er- is not inserted (infixed).
&gt;
&gt; I'm pretty sure taht 2nd declension is excluded by the fact
&gt; that all 2nd declension in -us is masculine, whereas this is
&gt; neuter.
&gt;
&gt; Therefore I'm not taking back my comments yet.
&gt; I think my argument is still rock solid.

I've read <A HREF="http://language.perl.com/misc/virus.html.">http://language.perl.com/misc/virus.html.</A>  Interesting
stuff.  In general it supports my views, so it must be right :-)
