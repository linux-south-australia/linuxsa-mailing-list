&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why?  You need to substantiate that claim.  It doesn't correspond to
&gt;&gt; my own observations.  To make things fair, we need to assume one
&gt;&gt; controller per drive for ATA, of course.
&gt;
&gt; I feel you just did substantiate the claim.  It's not common to have
&gt; just one drive in a RAID set :-) and as you say, with more than one
&gt; drive per controller ATA performs badly.  Certainly a five drive RAID
&gt; set could also have five IDE controllers, mind you, then you have to
&gt; consider increased interrupt latency (as you poll to find which device
&gt; on the necessarily shared IRQ requires servicing.)

The delay due to interrupt polling is in the order of microseconds.
It's an order of magnitude less than the time lost by sending SCSI
commands async.

&gt; Perhaps worrying about interrupt service time is a little feeble,
&gt; but so is expecting to have n IDE controllers in an n drive system
&gt; where n is some typically large number.

But that's what people are doing.  What's wrong with the idea?  Sure,
we're used to small systems with only one or two IDE or ATA
controllers, but there are quad controller cards available that also
do things like tagged queueing.

&gt; I suggest IDE is popular in home systems because it's cheap, and
&gt; SCSI is popular in business systems because it's fast.  (IPI seems
&gt; faster.)

ATA is popular because it's cheap.  SCSI is popular not only because
it's fast, but because there's a lot of prejudice against ATA.  I've
seldom seen commercial ventures opposed to saving money.
