&gt;Now I'm trying to create some audio CDs, but this
&gt;is where I'm hitting problems. I can play them 
&gt;back on the CD-RW drive itself using xplaycd and
&gt;other Linux CD players, but they won't play in 
&gt;normal CD players. Normal CD players don't find 
&gt;any tracks at all on the CDs.

I've has similar experiences with recordable 
CDs, in both audio CD players and some 
vintage CDROM drives.

It's a matter of disc reflectivity - as seen 
by the detector within the reading drive.  Specifically, 
what _it_ expects to see as the reflectivity difference 
between "0"s and "1"s when its internal laser illuminates 
the track on the disc.

A lot of audio CD players (and older drives) use a 
semiconductor-type laser working at a near 
infrared and/or "deep red" wavelength.  This isn't 
a problem with the shiny aluminium-coated CDs 
you buy from the music shop, because their reflectivity 
difference between "0"s and "1"s is large over a wide 
range of wavelengths.

However most writeable CDs are coloured, so to 
the detectors in some CD drives they appear almost 
"black" to begin with.  The disc absorbs practically all 
of the illuminating laser light; so the difference 
between a "0" and a "1" is simply too subtle for the 
detectors.  As far as it's concerned the CD is blank.

Newer CD drives (including some audio players) 
were designed with recordable CDs in mind.  The 
laser is improved (working at red-orange? 
wavelengths) and there's a more sensitive detector. 
But even these may fail on some disc brands.

You can ask "but why didn't they design them 
better?"; and it can be argued that audio CD players 
were intended to read those shiny mass-produced 
CDs from major recording companies, and not 
your homemade copy of Greatest Disco Hits Vol 99  ;-)

Conspiracy theories aside...here's some examples.
I've got a 2x CD-ROM drive here which reads all 
recordables except Sony.  I've got an 8x drive 
which won't read any recordables but LG.  The 
CD player in my old stereo reads anything that 
fits in the tray.  Except biscuits.   My sister's 
top-of-the-range stereo refuses to read _any_ 
recordables; but her new computer has no difficulty.

Exasperating?  Yes....



cheers,
Fraser Farrell
