Okay Ben, I'll give it a go.

First.  My suggestion to getting you set up is to use fdisk under
DOS. 

1)  Access the second physical device (important, don't want to kill
windows)
2)  Remove all current partitions on second device (since you can't
access them anyway I assume there is nothing there to loose)
3)  Create a *Primary* partition 1.5 gig in size
4)  Exit fdisk saving your config

You should now reboot windows and be able to format D:

This now means that there is 1.5 gig of unpartitioned space on the
second hard drive.  The redhat install should automatically use this
space, and if not the install process will let you set it up (just
don't delete any FAT partitions.  (Side note: If you have a Pentium
or higher, have a look at Linux Mandrake 7.1.  It's installer is
quite good for beginners).

Now for the terms as I see them (anyone is more than welcome to
correct any errors):

Primary partition - is the first place windows looks for a partition
on a physical device.  You should always have a primary partition on
a hard drive.  Windows formats it into one logical drive location (ie
c:).  Can be an active partition (ie bootable)

Extended partition - Under windows, this is where extra logical
drives can be created.  Can have multiple logical drives (ie d: &
e:).  I don't think it can be active (ie bootable).

Logical partition - essentially a mapping of an area of drive space
(either a primary partition or a part of an extended partition) that
is assocciated with a volume label (like c: or d:).

Active partition - Is a partition that is bootable.  Dos only allows
one on a drive.

Although it is possible to get around the default setup standards the
standard setup for a physical drive is to have:
  One Primary partition - Active
  One Extended partition - containing one or more logical partitions
  (with the extended partition optional).

Whoooh.  Hope that a)  Makes sense
                   b)  Answers your questions
                   c)  Fixes your problem

Any more questions, just post 'em up.

Good luck

&gt; 
&gt; Hello to whom this is addressed to,
&gt; 
&gt; I was recently at your Linux Expo in the City and I thought it was
&gt; very 
&gt; good. I am currently experiencing difficulties with installing Red
&gt; Hat Linux 
&gt; 6.1 and understanding the “partitioning” process, especially. Note:
&gt; I loss 
&gt; everything on my hard disks when trying to Install Linux for the
&gt; first time.
&gt; 
&gt; I will list my situation at the present time...
&gt; 
&gt; 1)	I have a Computer with “2 hard disks” installed on it.
&gt; 2)	The 1st hard disk is 1.2GB with Windows 98 currently operating
&gt; fine on 
&gt; it.
&gt; 3) However, the 2nd hard disk is 3GB and yet to be running anywhere
&gt; (i.e. 
&gt; not displaying in Windows) and it is empty. I have been trying to
&gt; use FDISK 
&gt; under DOS to try to get it to all work in Windows, yet it isn't
&gt; working. I 
&gt; have created an “extended partition”, yet I can not seem to format
&gt; it when I 
&gt; go back to DOS after the resetting process because it displays that
&gt; I only 
&gt; have a Floppy Disk and a Hard Disk C: (Windows on it).
&gt; 
&gt; If possible I would like my computer to be like this…
&gt; 
&gt; 1)	Keep the 1st Hard Disk the way it is with Windows and just leave
&gt; it 
&gt; alone.
&gt; 2) The 2nd Hard Disk with 1.5GB with additional space for Windows
&gt; files and 
&gt; the other 1.5GB of space for Linux. Please could you explain what I
&gt; should 
&gt; do when I reach the Partition option in the installation process
&gt; when the 
&gt; Add, Edit, Delete, Reset buttons are displayed and so on and with
&gt; the two 
&gt; Windows found in the screen with Partition and Drive Summary. And
&gt; as for the 
&gt; rest of the Linux installation process I should be fine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; “IMPORTANT”
&gt; If I still have difficulties (i.e. loss all my data again) could
&gt; you please 
&gt; explain what I should do to get both my hard disks to run Windows
&gt; 98 with 
&gt; the partitioning process and the formatting process if I lose
&gt; everything 
&gt; because somebody helped me at the Expo last time, but I didn't get 
&gt; everything.
&gt; 
&gt; Please could you “list” everything in preferably point form for
&gt; both getting 
&gt; Linux AND Windows running. Could you also explain the terms,
&gt; primary 
&gt; partition, extended partition, logical partitions and active
&gt; partitions as 
&gt; well.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt; Bennie.
&gt; 
&gt; (Could you try to keep everything
