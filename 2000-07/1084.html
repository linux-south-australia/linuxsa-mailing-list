&gt; Strange.  Yes, you're right.  And neither of my Latin dictionaries
&gt; state the plural, only that the genitive singular is viri, which
&gt; suggests it's still 2nd declension.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This suggests that it is 3rd declension, in which case
&gt; &gt; its plural would be "vira"!!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; No, the third declension never has nominative plural in -a.  In fact,
&gt; the only other declension with nominative singular in -us (long u, as
&gt; in Jesus) is the 4th, and it doesn't have any neuter form.  I think
&gt; this must be an irregular 2nd declension noun, in which case it's
&gt; difficult to guess what the plural is.

I think you're wrong there.
My latin grammar book has 3 sub-groups under the
third declension. Your comments apply only to the first form.
I'm aware of the standard 4th declension nouns in -us
which you're talking about. It's obviously not 4th.

I'm away from my dictionary and grammar book right now.
But I think that onus was one of the 3rd declension
nouns in -us.
Then oneri is the genitive, and onera is the plural.
But virus already ends in -rus, i.e. the stem ends in -r.
So the -er- is not inserted (infixed).

I'm pretty sure taht 2nd declension is excluded by the fact
that all 2nd declension in -us is masculine, whereas this is
neuter.

Therefore I'm not taking back my comments yet.
I think my argument is still rock solid.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
