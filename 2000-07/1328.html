     *************************************************************
      WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE!
           Gullibility Virus Spreading over the Internet!
     *************************************************************

WASHINGTON, D.C.--The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular
Internet
Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are becoming infected
by
a new virus that causes them to believe without question every
groundless
story, legend, and dire warning that shows up in their inbox or on their
browser. The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently makes people
believe and forward copies of silly hoaxes relating to cookie recipes,
email
viruses, taxes on modems, and get-rich-quick schemes.

"These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery
tickets
based on fortune cookie numbers," a spokesman said. "Most are otherwise
normal people, who would laugh at the same stories if told to them by a
stranger on a street corner." However, once these same people become
infected with the Gullibility Virus, they believe anything they read on
the
Internet.

"My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone," reported one
weeping victim. "I believe every warning message and sick child story my
friends forward to me, even though most of the messages are anonymous."

Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first heard about Good
Times, I just accepted it without question. After all, there were dozens
of
other recipients on the mail header, so I thought the virus must be
true."
It was a long time, the victim said, before she could stand up at a
Hoaxees
Anonymous meeting and state, "My name is Jane, and I've been hoaxed."
Now,
however, she is spreading the word. "Challenge and check whatever you
read,"
she says.

Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the
virus,
which include the following:

    The willingness to believe improbable stories without thinking. The
    urge to forward multiple copies of such stories to others. A lack of
    desire to take three minutes to check to see if a story is true.

T. C. is an example of someone recently infected. He told one reporter,
"I read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos 
makes your hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo." When told 
about the Gullibility Virus, T. C. said he would stop reading email, so
that 
he would not become infected.

Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately.
Experts recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet
users rush to their favorite search engine and look up the item tempting
them to thoughtless credence.  Most hoaxes, legends, and tall tales have
been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet community.

Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and there is
online help from many sources, including

Those people who are still symptom free can help inoculate themselves
against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good material on
evaluating
sources, such as

Lastly, as a public service, Internet users can help stamp out the
Gullibility Virus by sending copies of this message to anyone who
forwards
them a hoax.
