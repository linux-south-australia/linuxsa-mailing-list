Is there any point in posting agreement with rr?
Either way I am posting it.

I have been around in IT long enough (15 years) to know that SA basically
sucks for being picky about employment. Add this to the weight of
mortgages/school fees, car loans etc that most people have, when you are
lucky enough to get offered a job with reasonable pay do not say , no sorry
your choice of platforms, o/s etc sucks.
I like Linux, I also like M/S environments ie VB/C/SQL svr and their office
products, I have yet to come across any limitations within either which
would make me say no thanks to a job if all else is equal ie ppl, pay etc.

Well my 0.02c inclusive of GST :)


&gt; I would like to point out to Alex that some people are not blessed with
the
&gt; capacity to gain work in an environment that allows them this freedom of
&gt; choice. Some people struggle to get any work at all. Some people put a
_lot_
&gt; more  effort into getting work than he did, but are still forced to work
in
&gt; an area they don't like, using an OS they don't like. Some of these people
&gt; have families and mortgages, and do not enjoy the luxury of being able to
&gt; make these decisions in a way that would enable them to get where they
want
&gt; to me. Some people have other priorities apart from being able to choose
&gt; what OS and tools to use.
&gt;
&gt; That is all I want to say :)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fine advice, but a little hard to implement if you are using a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Corporate SOE (Standard Operating Environment) that means you are
&gt; &gt; &gt; stuck with a mail client that doesn't get it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Then get a new employer!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ROFL
&gt;
&gt; Not as silly as it sounds. I specifically work at NetCraft because an
&gt; important aspect of my job is to be able to work without having stupid
&gt; corporate decisions thrust upon me. I choose my own tools. I don't use
&gt; exchange/outlook, and I don't read Word documents.
&gt;
&gt; I have no sympathy for those that do, as I had to go to some effort to
&gt; have this luxury of choice. If you choose to work in an environment
&gt; that forces you to use outlook, then you have to put up with poor
&gt; filtering. Don't expect the mailing list to change for you.
&gt;
&gt; Which was the original point of this thread.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Alex!
&gt;
&gt; P.S. It is worth noting that the word 'you' in this e-mail could
&gt; probably have been 'one'. It is not targeted at anyone in particular,
&gt; certainly not someone on this list.
