oh, phooey to you.

SOME OF US HAVE NO CHOICE ABOUT WHAT MAIL CLIENT WE ARE USING. At the
moment, I have even less choice, as I am stuck with a web interface to
Exchange. You don't realise how badly this sucks.

I am trying (and have been trying for a while) to move to a unix client, and
I am expecting it to be possible soonish... However, our ENTIRE Department
(and indeed, the entire public service) runs on Outlook and Exchange, and if
you know anything about the Public Service, you'll know that change is not
something that is welcomed... I'm trying...

The message to David was not a serious request about adding something to the
subject line, it was a non-too-subtle hint to David that maybe he is
trolling yet again, and maybe that is not a good thing to do.

BTW: if I could be bothered, I would argue that the subject line is, indeed
the correct place to put something like [DL], which would have a similar
meaning to [OT]...

Anyway, a thousand apologies on behalf of Microsoft and the SA Government
for sending broken email. I have little choice, but am doing what I can. At
some stage this week, I hope to have a non-broken email client, which will,
of course, break my Department-mandated Exchange scheduling, but it's
(evidently) the lesser of two evils...

Love you all, and please bear with me.
