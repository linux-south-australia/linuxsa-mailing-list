&gt; 
&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I work for a small business with just a few employees.
&gt; 
&gt; What we're looking for is some sort of server software that will run on the
&gt; linux box that can give us a shared task list on our wintel desktops -
&gt; preferably inside Outlook.  I've investigated Outlook Net Folders and it
&gt; simply doesn't work very well / at all.
&gt; 
&gt; We use an old beast running RedHat 6.2 (yes, the one that gave us / is
&gt; giving us lots of trouble) that sits in the corner and spits packets in and
&gt; out of our office.  We can beef this up as required if there is there
&gt; anything we can run that will do the job?
&gt; 
&gt; As I type, we are installing our promotional copy of MS Small Biz Server out
&gt; in the workshop.
&gt; 
&gt; Please, save us from this misery.

&lt;snip&gt;

I have a document called "The Exchange Server Replacement HOWTO" which details
how you can set up an IMAP/LDAP/etc-based server which does the same job as the
mail part of Exchange Server - but I haven't seen anywhere the calendar and
schedule sharing part replaced succesfully.  I've no idea how it works with the
real Exchange Server.  I can't remember where it's from but I have the document
in postscript format, I can email it you if you like.

There are several open-source web-based and database-backended
calendar/scheduling packages available for linux which may be worth a look by
now ;)  Check <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/.">http://www.freshmeat.net/.</A>

So - in a nutshell - the Exchange Server Replacement HOWTO can help you replace
the mail server part of exchange, with a central address book etc etc, but the
calendaring bit is god knows how easy/hard.

When you find out, please let us know :))  I know for a fact there'd be more
than one person on this list interested in your research.
