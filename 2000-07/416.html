he only people who bring caseless computers are people going to LAN
parties... :)

I doubt this will be much of a problem, and with us all wandering around
with our tshirts on, it will be even less so. I think best bet is that we
strongly suggest people watch their machines carefully, and we all keep our
eyes open for people with pockets full of RAM.

IMHO, cordoning off the area is overkill. There will be a secure area --
near the registration desk... it will be where PCs come in and out...

&gt; Hey ho,
&gt; 
&gt; Another issue to consider is peopel who bring machines without cases.
&gt; 
&gt; RAM and CPUs fit in a pcoket and are ewasily and quickly removable.
&gt; 
&gt; One of my brother friends had some RAM stolen at a LAN games party
&gt; recently, so perhaps there needs to be some considerationof 
&gt; this, perhaps
&gt; a warning sign/poster for people who bring case off PCs to be extra
&gt; careful.
&gt; 
&gt; It might be worth having a "secure" area where people can 
&gt; leave their PCs
&gt; unattended while they  watch or particiapte in non install activities.
&gt; 
&gt; It might also be an idea to cordon off the install area to 
&gt; owners and the
&gt; installers, if at all possible.
&gt; 
&gt; The public at lage coudl watch, but on the otyehrside of and out of
&gt; reaching distance of the installs.
&gt; 
&gt; Some clothesline should be adequate for this.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a 50 metre rope that could be used if required.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; jason tan
