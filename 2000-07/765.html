&gt; &gt; Possibly. But Gui will rule. Command line savvy is no longer a badge
&gt; &gt; of hairy chestedness. In your face dialog boxes with all options
&gt; &gt; clearly presented is the way it is, underlying scripts is another
&gt; &gt; thing and fine, but command line is a nostalgic throwback to horse
&gt; &gt; and carriage days.
&gt; 
&gt; Try telling that to a CCIE Network Engineer! Worked on a Cisco switch
&gt; or router lately? They're about as command line as you can get, and
&gt; also the backbone of that Internet thing I hear so much about!  :o)

As is just about any major server. X / NT are not the best things to
have chewing up CPU/RAM on a server ;-) Besides, it builds character.
;-)

Also, the fact that no GUI has ever given us the power of the command
line. Just look at pipes and file redirection in most shells. I believe
the two should work together.

Horse and Carriage days... ;-) Perhaps we should also get rid of two
mice buttons out of three (it's the same as relying purely on a GUI).
