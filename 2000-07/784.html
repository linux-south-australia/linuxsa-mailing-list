Yes. A Livingstone portmaster specifically. Telnetting into it is command line.
Using X, its gui. Of both approaches, the gui is the most productive and
untuitively easy to follow (depends greatly on the creative energies of the
writer of that gui of course)

&gt; Of course if you are just referring to a command line in an OS, 

Definitely. Even having quoted the above, the gui (and it's attendant overhead)
has no place (yet), in simple boxes. But, it will come. It is as self evident
as arranging the switches lights and buttons on that box in an attractive
manner. The only thing ever stopping gui is resources required. Pick a silly
figure in ram memory size. When, not if, that ram memory becomes
inconsequentuially cheap, gui arrives.

"Command line savvy is no longer a badge of hairy chestedness",

If I can design an easy to use dialog box for my end customer, I imagine he
would be far more impressed than explaining to him my knowledge of how
to grep a file and pipe the answer. Command line -switches have no place in the
end use of a product, just as coding in C is not useable by itself. The fact
that you can only use command line on some issues does not elevate it into a
place of honour and glory. Instead, it reflects a primitive mindset on what the
end game really is.

As for your specific example of a Cisco anything, IF, i were constantly, and
boringly using the same repetitous syntax to manipluate that box, complete with
all the attendant typos and wrong commands that we all make, I would
wrap that stuff inside an X window based on effort to do so vs benefit.

Bottom line? People confuse their ability to use -R tor 'recurse a directory' as
a defininition that the 'command' works well. It doesn't. The need for the
option expressed in that manner, shouldn't be there in the first place.
