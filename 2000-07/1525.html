&gt; I have been getting some help from a great guy there in Australia and
&gt; we have come to an end.  So now I would like your recommendations for
&gt; a new modem that will be easy to install.  Preferable work "Right out
&gt; of the Box" with both Linux and Win 95.  I understand that most
&gt; external modems work with Linux, but I would prefer to use an internal
&gt; modem just to keep things neat.  I have plenty of room in the computer
&gt; box .

My experience has been that external modems are better, not just better
compatible. However, if you must get an internal modem, avoid any of the
"soft"-modem varieties: most don't have linux drivers. Of the one that 
I've heard of with a linux driver, it did strange things to other
modules
installed at the same time. Softmodems include LT Winmodems (or anything
calling itself a winmodem), Rockwell HCF modems, most Conexant modems 
and Motorolla SM56's (guess what the SM stands for). There may be
others,
or these chipsets may be repackaged by other manufacturers. 

Apparently a lot of USB modems are also doing a lot of the work in
software. Can anyone on the list confirm this?

Cheers

Tom
