Hi..

I have downloaded and compiled the 1.9 version of the CD Record package.  I 
am stumped if I can work out how to use it.

Under Windows (yes, I am still trying to break out of the GUI 'press button 
here' dependency forced upon me by Windows) it was easy, I just pressed copy 
or moved a directory into the Adaptec CD burner software Window and Bob 
became my uncle.

I have tried using XCDRoast - but it complains that I can't mount the image 
partition as 'root'.  I am not sure if I am supposed to have a seperate 
partition for the image.

GToast does not seem to let me move directories or anything at all in to the 
window below.  I think perhaps it is not working properly.

So I am thinking it is prime time to work out the command line.  Buggered if 
I know how to just copy a CD or backup my data.

I can rip audio tracks okay though - CD Paranoia is fantastic!

Any ideas?

BTW - help files don't seem to exist for GToast and XCDRoast is not very 
helpful either.

Ian

&gt;On Friday, July 28, 2000 2:27 AM, heaps of people told me:
&gt; &gt; [stuff]
&gt;
&gt;Thanks to everyone who responded so quickly.  Pity I
&gt;have to work, otherwise I'd have gone home and tried a
&gt;lot of the suggestions by now!
&gt;
&gt;I'll email my solution (if found), as it seems as if most
&gt;people have had problems doing this at some stage or other.
&gt;It might help others feel more comfortable about buying
&gt;CDRW drives too.
&gt;
&gt;BTW, I discovered that even the latest dev version of cdrecord
&gt;doesn't yet support 8x writing speed with CD-R's, so I still
&gt;can't make full use of the drive under Linux. Don't know about
&gt;the Adaptec easy-CD stuff for WinXX though....
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Dean
