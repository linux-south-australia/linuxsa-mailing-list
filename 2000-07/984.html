&gt; We dropped in at the InstallFest a little late in the day, and bumped
&gt; into a friend who offered us a used laptop HD at a reasonable price
&gt; that was 4x the storage space as I'd had.  
&gt; 
&gt; So today, knowing I could take my laptop back to it's original state
&gt; just by putting the old HD back in, I had no hesitation in installing
&gt; Linux today on my old Compaq Contura 400 via a network installation.
&gt; 
&gt; All went reasonably well, and tonight my old laptop is actually
&gt; set up using Enlightenment/Gnome, which blows me away since it's only
&gt; a 40mhz machine with 20mb memory.  
&gt; 
&gt; Down the road I plan on doing some tweaking such as getting rid of the
&gt; RH Gnome version and updating with the Helix code Gnome as well as
&gt; updating and severely stripping Enlightment so she'll be a nice lean
&gt; set up.
&gt; 

Argh!  E on a 40mhz box!  I don't know how you manage.  If you ever feel
like moving to something a little quicker - less resource and screen-space
intensive, give blackbox (<A HREF="http://blackbox.alug.org">http://blackbox.alug.org</A>) a try.  This wm is not
nomrally packaged with distributions - but I can almost guarentee it'll
compile cleanly on most boxes.  It's not GNOME complient (it does,
however, support the new WM-spec that GNOME 2.0 and KDE 2.0 will use), and
its interface may take a little while to get used to, but I find it a
really comfortable and quick wm.

If you do give it a try, don't let the term "beta" of the 0.60.x series
fool you - I have never had a crash with it, and the 0.60.x series is a
lot better than the old 0.51.x ones.

Just my 2c
