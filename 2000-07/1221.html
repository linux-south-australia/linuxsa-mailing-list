&gt; Hello, all:
&gt; 
&gt; I've finally determined that the reason why I can't get two computers
&gt; connected by a cat5 crossover cable is that they are bugging out in 100mb
&gt; full duplex. They're an Intel 10/100 (ee100pro) and a Netgear 10/100 (tulip)
&gt; card.
&gt; 
&gt; I need to force them both down to 10mb/sec in order to get them working
&gt; (that's what I think, anyway). I reckon I've got to edit the conf.modules
&gt; file, but I don't know what switches to put in. Does anyone know the A)
&gt; Switches and B) best place to look for conf.modules information...?
&gt; 
&gt; In case anyone cares, my symptoms are as follows:
&gt; eth0 wouldn't come up on boot.
&gt; "service network restart" did the trick once I was booted, though.
&gt; Once the eth0 interface was up, I suffered 40-60% packet loss on pings.
&gt; They work fine connected to a hub, and I have the same problems with a
&gt; different crossover cable.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
 OK if you get 40-60% loss then 60-40% get through so
  the cable must be a X-over  not a patch-lead [straight-throught].
         If you have a 10mb/s only card handy, you could try; swapping 
 each 10/100 card  in turn and  testing the link.   I believe the 10/100 
cards will auto detect the mode at boot up, forcing the link to 10mb/s
but to get both at 10mb/s I'm not sure. ??
    on the other hand  if the cable works at 10mb/s and not at 100mb/s .
I'd check that the cable crimping was tight and double check the wiring
of the cross-over is correct.   look in the how-to's   " I'm sure one has
the wiring details".   If you can get your hands on a cable tester it will 
speed up the testing of each line and reduce the squinting to tell which
 colour corrosponds to what pin at each end . or you could try with a 
known good cable . 
 I know Jaycar sell a tester, no idea on the price though ??
