No... not true.
You dont need a primary partition on a drive to use extended (and then
logical) partitions.
I was just trying to clear up for him the reason why the 3Gb partition
couldnt be seen in windows before he tried installing linux.

MWP


&gt; Yes, but you need a primary partition first or I understand the extended
is
&gt; irrelevant.
&gt; He didn't state what he'd done about a primary partition so I simplified
the
&gt; whole process accordingly.
&gt; What he needs to do is create the primary partition for DOS/Windows!
&gt; Don.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Just to fill in a gap here...
&gt; &gt; The reason that the 3Gb drive couldnt be seen in Windows is because you
only
&gt; &gt; created at extended partition.
&gt; &gt; In the extended partition you must then also create logical partitions
which
&gt; &gt; you then see in windows as a drive which you can then format.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MWP
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Ben,
&gt; &gt; The disk can only be seen by DOS/Windows after it has been formatted
&gt; &gt; eg: format d: /u
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What you appear to need to do is:
&gt; &gt; 1) create a primary partition of 1.5GB on the second Hard Disk
&gt; &gt; 2) reboot and then format that partition in DOS -&gt;  format d: /u
&gt; &gt; 3) reboot and begin the installation of linux and select the unallocated
&gt; &gt; space on the second drive as the place to put Linux.  The installation
&gt; &gt; will create the partitions as needed and then format it as an ext2 file
&gt; &gt; system for you.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *NOTE*  Don't forget to create a swap partition for Linux.  It will
&gt; &gt; almost certainly ask you to do this anyway, but you need to leave space
&gt; &gt; for it.  If you don't intend doing a whole lot of work on the Linux side
&gt; &gt; ie. only for exploring and learning purposes, then you can usually do
&gt; &gt; with just a 64MB swap, but maybe more if you don't have much physical
&gt; &gt; RAM (&lt; 32MB).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; regards,
&gt; &gt; Don

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello to whom this is addressed to,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was recently at your Linux Expo in the City and I thought it was
very
&gt; &gt; &gt; good. I am currently experiencing difficulties with installing Red Hat
&gt; Linux
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6.1 and understanding the "partitioning" process, especially. Note: I
&gt; loss
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything on my hard disks when trying to Install Linux for the first
&gt; time.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I will list my situation at the present time...
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)      I have a Computer with "2 hard disks" installed on it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)      The 1st hard disk is 1.2GB with Windows 98 currently operating
&gt; fine on
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) However, the 2nd hard disk is 3GB and yet to be running anywhere
&gt; (i.e.
&gt; &gt; &gt; not displaying in Windows) and it is empty. I have been trying to use
&gt; FDISK
&gt; &gt; &gt; under DOS to try to get it to all work in Windows, yet it isn't
working.
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; have created an "extended partition", yet I can not seem to format it
&gt; when I
&gt; &gt; &gt; go back to DOS after the resetting process because it displays that I
&gt; only
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a Floppy Disk and a Hard Disk C: (Windows on it).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; If possible I would like my computer to be like this.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)      Keep the 1st Hard Disk the way it is with Windows and just
leave
&gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; alone.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The 2nd Hard Disk with 1.5GB with additional space for Windows
files
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the other 1.5GB of space for Linux. Please could you explain what I
&gt; should
&gt; &gt; &gt; do when I reach the Partition option in the installation process when
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Add, Edit, Delete, Reset buttons are displayed and so on and with the
&gt; two
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows found in the screen with Partition and Drive Summary. And as
for
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; rest of the Linux installation process I should be fine.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "IMPORTANT"
&gt; &gt; &gt; If I still have difficulties (i.e. loss all my data again) could you
&gt; please
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain what I should do to get both my hard disks to run Windows 98
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; &gt; the partitioning process and the formatting process if I lose
everything
&gt; &gt; &gt; because somebody helped me at the Expo last time, but I didn't get
&gt; &gt; &gt; everything.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please could you "list" everything in preferably point form for both
&gt; getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; Linux AND Windows running. Could you also explain the terms, primary
&gt; &gt; &gt; partition, extended partition, logical partitions and active
partitions
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; well.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bennie.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Could you try to keep everything
&gt; &gt; &gt;
