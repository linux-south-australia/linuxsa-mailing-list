&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Email is the most basic of communication options on the internet.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally on the LinuxSA mailing list I'd like 7 bit ASCII, no
&gt;&gt;&gt; html, no coloured text, no flashing, no large graphics either.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; What about ISO 8859 instead of ASCII?  There are even a number of
&gt;&gt; English words which, strictly, include things not in ASCII, like
&gt;&gt; fiancée.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I should've expanded this.  I don't want to exclude support
&gt; for languages other than english - is ISO 8859 sufficient?

No.

&gt; Does that provide support for asian and arabic languages?  What
&gt; about non-left-to-right, top-to-bottom languages?  There are so many
&gt; different internationalisations, which one is the right one?

There are various kinds of 8859.  The one I've been using is 8859-1,
but I believe that was obsoleted when they introduced the Euro (the
currency, not the animal).  I forget which - number it is now.  There
are other versions for other European languages, but 8 bits isn't
enough for Chinese or Japanese.  You'd need unicode for that, and
currently I think that almost none of us have systems which support
it.

&gt; The thing I dislike, and it's something I'm quite happy to put up
&gt; with to allow for non-english speakers, is legacy mailers that don't
&gt; support anything more that 7-bit ASCII (hence my original
&gt; statement).  Why didn't we (hacks) allow for 16-bit-wide chars and 4
&gt; digit dates 20 years ago?  sigh.  But that's another thread :-)

Indeed.
