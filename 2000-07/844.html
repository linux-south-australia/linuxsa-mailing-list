 &gt; The second most frequent question was, "what can you do with the Linuxcare

 &gt; almost any wintel pc unusable.  Take it to somebody who you don't really like

One of the FreeBSD developers (might have been Brian Somers) made a 
neat little hack with FreeBSD.  Or maybe it's a virus, I dunno, you be
the judge.

For the last couple of years, Intel ethernet cards with bootrom support
have utilized a protocol and set of BIOS extensions called PXE to netboot.
With a PXE compliant BIOS and an OS network-loadable bootstrap on a 
server which understands PXE, you can run PCs diskless (no hard disks,
no floppies, no nothing -- Once the kernel is loaded, the PC can use any
protocol it likes, such as IPX, SMB or NFS, for its filesystems).  You've
actually been able to do that with PCs for decades (I have a ten year old
diskless FreeBSD system at home), but PXE has "standardized" it (which is
code for, "Now Intel supports it").

It works by broadcasting PXE boot requests onto the Ethernet.  The
first PXE server to respond "wins", so if you have multiple PXE boot
servers on your LAN you'll end up load-sharing them.

Aside from "thin client" applications (imagine an office full of $100
PXE-compliant diskless PCs as workstations), PXE is also useful for 
network installations.  Many BIOSes these days will attempt a PXE netboot
by default, to aid the kind of enterprise customer who takes a new PC out
of the shrink wrap and installs a corporate-standard environment on it
with as little friction as possible.  The canonical example is Yahoo,
who have produced a FreeBSD root filesystem which, when mounted by a
netbooting FreeBSD PXE client, will check to see if the client has had
FreeBSD installed, and will automatically install it if it hasn't.

That's where Brian stepped in (or maybe it wasn't him - The story was
related to me by Mike Smith over a coffee, and I might have the name wrong).
He produced a root filesystem similar to Yahoo's, but which automatically
installs FreeBSD *AND* makes sure that the resulting system is configured
as a PXE boot server, with all the right bits on its disk to netboot its
own clients.

Now picture, if you will, what happens when that little beastie is let
loose in a corporate environment which is full of PCs which attempt to
PXE-boot every time they're turned on, like many BIOSes do by default. 
A Windows PC switches on, netboots FreeBSD, blasts FreeBSD over the top
of the Windows installation, and then proceeds to act as a PXE server for
the next hapless Windows system which wants to reboot.  And anyone who
doesn't like it had better make *damn* sure they've identified all the
new FreeBSD systems left on their network :-)

OS installation via viral propagation.  Qool :-)
