Howdy all,

I just have to say yesterday was a beaut day, installfest rocked!!!

Now, for the inevitable:

Q&A time :-)

I have a problem with my firewall settings they are not allowing machines to 
talk to the internet, they were set up for me by a very kind person at the 
installfest. He wrote me a script to disable them and re-enable them, so I 
disabled them and the machines talked to the net just fine throught the 
network. And I could tracert to the machines from outside the network. Now I 
know how to call up my firewall settings (he set them using ipfwadm) what I 
want to know is how I can get a dump of them somehow and send them via email 
to this list, because I had a look at some documentation on ipfwadm and 
still can't pin the problem.

Also how do I send an email with the dump (from ipfwadm) in it from text 
mode (RH6.2)

My linux box will talk to the net fine with the firewall restrictions in 
place, and I am pretty sure sendmail is working properly so I should be able 
to send the message. I don't want to have to sit here write everything on 
paper, then write it all into an email through windows. I will do that if 
its too hard to do it the other way but I would much prefer to do it via 
linux. Because at the moment my linux box and my dos machine are sharing a 
keyboard,monitor and modem, so its one or the other.

Sorry about this being sooooo long, thanks for your help (in advance)

Richard Russell (and everyone else) - top job yesterday
(my ears are still recovering from that mean whistle of yours - sure got 
peoples attention)
