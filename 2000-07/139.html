This sounds like a hardware conflict to me.

The NCR chipset can be interesting as some Bios's are actually Symbios aware
(the NCR chipset, commonly an 810). On some older motherboards you can have
a devil of a time getting them running.

See if you can try the SCSI card combo on another motherboard, to see if
this works.

SCSI controllers usually take a swag of resources, especially if they load
up BIOS. (BIOS address, IRQ, DMA , IO address), so it may be useful to
doublecheck.

Oh, just an idea, why not use the dreaded win98 bootdisk, especially if you
have a SCSI CD-ROM available. Plug SCSI CD_ROM into a controller, boot and
see if CD detects. Swap CD-ROM to alternate controller and see again. Win98
boot does have driver for both Buslogic and NCR. At least this way you can
find out if devices are basically functioning side by side.

The Win98 Boot disk is something that MS have actually done half well, and
is one of those handy things to have around. I actually bastardise a version
and put it on a small patition on my linux server/PC's along with BIOS flash
software and other dos config tools. This means I always have a way of
running those DOS config utils without having to chase up a DOS boot floppy,
or dig up the tools.

I know this is not a clean 'linux' lover sol'n and will make most cringe and
flame away, but I find this often to be eminently practical. 

(Of course you use lilo to boot into the DOS partition if you use it :))

Tarek

&gt; Subject: Two SCSI controllers (different types) in RH 6.1 causes
&gt; problems
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am seeing an interesting problem with a RH 6.1 system. It 
&gt; has two SCSI
&gt; controllers in it, a BusLogic and an NCR53c8xx or some such.
&gt; 
&gt; When both controllers are in the machine, we cannot read tar 
&gt; files from the
&gt; tape drive that is normally on the NCR based controller. It 
&gt; does not matter
&gt; if the driver is loaded, just that the controller is in the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone seen this. Is it a known problem?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
