Hi,

I am no sendmail guru (well, I knew a lot about it years ago, but have
slipped), but ...

I have been reviewing the sendmail config at one customer site recently to
make it simpler and more maintainable ...

We have what is a standard config in this situation:


  [Big Bad Internet]----[Firewall]-----[Internal Mail Server]

All mail is received on the firewall and relayed to the Internal Mail Server.

All internal addresses are from one of the Private IP domains. 

When I set this up four years ago, I had to hack the sendmail config file
to defeat DNS name lookups on the internal mail server name so the IP
address could be looked up in the hosts file. 

The ways to handle this these days is to use the LOCAL_RULES stuff in your
sendmail.mc file, or to use split DNS.  

However, both of these are quite complicated, and it seemed to me that
there is a need for a FEATURE, perhaps called internal_mail_hub that allows
people who are trying to set this sort of system up to do so easily.

I think I know how to modify the proto.m4 to achieve this, but wondered if
anyone thought that this was an interesting idea.

Regards
