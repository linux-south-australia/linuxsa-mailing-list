Optimize it:

    if ps p`cat /var/run/squid.pid` &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1; then
        echo "squid running"
    else
        /etc/rc.d/init.d/squid start
        echo "squid was just restarted\n Time is `ddate`"
    fi

Yes, it has an additional else clause, but on the other hand you've saved
yourself at fork for the built-in "test" ([) command and two invocations
of grep.

Hmm - that won't work, actually, if there's a case where another process
has started up with the same PID as the dead squid daemon.  Oh well, I'll
leave it here anyway so people can ponder over it to work out how it 
works, and an example of how optimization can break things in very hard
to find ways :-)

 &gt; But, when I run it, it give the following:
 &gt; ./chksquid: [: ==: binary operator expected
 
It's fairly simple:  You've thrown people off the scent a bit by saying
"bash question" on the Subject: line, but you've actually executed this
script with #!/bin/sh on the first line:  sh != bash.  In particular,
/bin/sh doesn't have an "==" operator.

Starting bash as "sh" makes it mimic the Bourne shell as closely as
possible;  since the Bourne shell doesn't recognize ==, neither does
bash invoked as /bin/sh.  Try it out for yourself:  Type "bash", then
type in your script at the command line and watch it work;  Then type
"sh" and type your script again, and watch it fail with the exact error
message you've posted here.

To make your script work, either change "==" to "=", or put "#!/bin/bash"
on the first line of the script.

Alternatively, squid is bundled with a perfectly servicible "RunCache"
script which is supposed to be used to start it up, and which does what
you're trying to do immediately as soon as the squid daemon dies.  Perhaps
you should be using that...
