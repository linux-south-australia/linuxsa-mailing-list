V90/K56 are not interfaces, they are modem protocols.

You should get which ever your ISP supports.

These days that is generally v90 as that is the standard (k56Flex and
x2 were both pre v90 protocols that various alliances of companies
created
because v90 ahd nto been standardised at the time), however it is possible
that some ISPs might not support v90.

K56flex is still supported by some ISPs as well as v90, but v90 is the way
to go.

As for interface, I dont know how well supported USB is, but David is
likely correct, so so better to be safe and go for a serial modem I would
think.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I have RH 6.2 installed and one of those internal Win-modems, 
&gt; which Linux has a lot of trouble with. I am now looking at getting a 
&gt; new modem and was wondering what type would be best for use 
&gt; with a linux OS, namely RH6.2?
&gt; 
&gt; Should I get USB - will that work fairly simply or should I go some 
&gt; other interface? K56 or V90?  Any suggestions?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
