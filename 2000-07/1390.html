I don't think that's entirely true;  If it was, it'd mean you could
suffer unlimited liability by simply signing-on to a mailing list or
attending a meeting.

There has been a lot of scary stuff about how much we'd all be responsible
for if someone sued.  The real answer is that most of us would be responsible
for nothing at all.

Let's use the InstallFest as an example, since that's something which was
discussed at the last meeting, and consider the case where an InstallFest
guest sued an installer for destruction of data on their hard disk.

Firstly, they've signed waivers absolving everyone but themselves of 
responsibility for that;  But, for the sake of argument, assume the judge
utterly disregards the waiver, its purpose, the state of mind of the
person who signed it, and the state of mind of the installers.

Who can the aggrieved visitor sue?  At the last meeting, the answer
was "All of us!" but that's obviously wrong.  In truth, the following
people could probably be reasonably expected to bear the brunt of it:

    - The individual who carried out the installation (i.e.: the actual
      person who destroyed the data); and

    - The organizers.

    - Possibly the venue owners.

The organizers and venue owners wouldn't wear the same liability as the
installer, either: Although they would have contributed to the data loss
by setting up the event in the first place, they weren't the actual people
who caused the hypothetical data to be lost.  And let's remember that the
judge would also need to consider that the plaintiff deliberately signed
a piece of paper which said he knew about the risk of dataloss and 
wanted to proceed anyway.

Additionally, we could argue that it was actually an AUUG event, and move
the whole problem to them :-)

Claims that "... at the moment we are *all* going at risk individually..."
need to be put in context:  We are all at risk individually for our 
individual actions.  David's statement above, "There is noone to 
pursue except each and every individual," should be modified by appending
the phrase, "who actually contributes to the acts which have lead to the
lawsuit."

So what would happen if LinuxSA were incorporated?

Answer:  "The Installer" would no longer be an individual, since the actual
human being who typed the commands which destroyed the data would be acting
in the role of an agent of the person known as "LinuxSA Incorporated." 
Also, the individuals who organized the event would also have been agents
of LinuxSA Incorporated.  As such, LinuxSA Incorporated would be the
"person" who could be sued, and the actual dollar amount of the liability
would be limited to the assets of the Incorporated body.

I hope this clears some things up.  I'm sure others will pick what I've
just said to shreds, but regardless of that the fact still remains that
any claim that we can be held financially responsible for LinuxSA's 
actions by counting ourselves as a member of the group (which is pretty
strange for a group which donesn't maintain a register of members!) should
be regarded as facile hyperbole.
