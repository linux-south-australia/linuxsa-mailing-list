&gt;&gt; ... one reason for blocking ICMP echo or reply at
&gt;&gt; a border router is to prevent becoming a "smurf" amplifier, where
&gt;&gt; pings with bogus source addresses are directed at broadcast addresses
&gt;&gt; on your network, causing your network devices to respond with a reply
&gt;&gt; back to the forged source address.

&gt; Surely this could be solved better by blocking incoming packets that
&gt; appear to originate from your network

The source address isn't set to an internal address.

&gt; and incoming packets that are
&gt; destined to any broadcast address(es)?

For a large network, this would place an intolerable load on the router.
And small networks don't tend to be used, exactly because they're small.

&gt; You could also block outgoing packets that do not appear to be from you
&gt; network(s), and prevent your network(s) being a source of this problem
&gt; too :-)

I do use that as a matter of course, but that doesn't prevent smurf
amplification.
