&gt;&gt;&gt; I'd recommend Debian.  Why, well because that's what I use:-) But
&gt;&gt;&gt; seriously, it does have the best package management software of any
&gt;&gt;&gt; distribution (except for those distributions which are basically a
&gt;&gt;&gt; modified Debian anyway).  And it is the most stable distribution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; OK, other people have recommended Debian to me as well.  I've been
&gt;&gt; trying to install it for over a week.  I'm not stupid, I've installed
&gt;&gt; most flavours of BSD and Linux with no problems, but I can't get
&gt;&gt; Debian to recognize my Ethernet board.  I'm not alone in this: I had
&gt;&gt; the CTO of a large Linux services company here last weekend, and he
&gt;&gt; tried in vain to help (admittedly, he's not a Debian guru).
&gt;
&gt; Have you tried asking help from the <A HREF="mailto:debian-user@lists.org.au">debian-user@lists.org.au</A> mailing
&gt; list?  In my experience they are generally pretty helpful?  Indeed, it
&gt; was one of the things which attracted me to Debian.

No.  I tried one of the recommended IRC channels and got very little
feedback.  I have other Linux experts I can turn to, and I'm sure I'll
get the problem resolved, it's just that it was much more difficult
than I had expected.
