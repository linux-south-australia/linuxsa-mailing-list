G'day all,

	I am a relative newbie to Linux and a complete newbie to networking.  I
would be grateful if I could have your thoughts on a few questions.  First
the hardware.  I have 2 Celerons and a Pentium III which I got going
successfully under NFS.  The Pentium was the server and the Celerons the
clients.  I could ping and telnet each box with impunity.  I then managed
to fry 2 hubs.  The hubs were 100/10 auto switching hubs and my NICs
RealTeks at 100Mb.  They worked well.

	I now want to add another Pentium and a 486DX as a router.  These boxes
have NE2000 clones which I managed to figure out how to get going in Linux.
 However the NICs are 10 Mb only.

What I would like to know is:

1.	Is there a problem with using dual speed NICs on a network.

2.	All boxes are dual booting.  Sorry, but I have to use the evil empire
occasionally.  For reasons of cost, I would like to be able to mix and
match the Windows and Linux boxes as the need takes me.  The router will
stay in Linux.  Is this feasible?

3.	Is is possible for a box to be both a client and a server to any other
box in NFS.  I understand NFS and Samba can happily co-exist.

	I guess eventually, I will get more boxes, but cost constrains me a little
at present.  Many thanks for your thoughts.

Cheers,   Rick
