Hi,

I don't know much about the Realtek 8909 card, but I do know
that the 3COM 3c905 is a 10/100 Mbit card. Could it be that
the Realtek is a 10Mbit card and the 3COM is setup to use 
100Mbit?
The driver disks that come with the 3COM card contain a DOS
program for configuring the 3C905 card. With this you can
set the speed it should work at (10 or 100).


Stuart.

Subject: Ping...


Hi all...
I have a RedHat 6.2 box with a network card with which I am trying to
get to talk to my win95 box with a network card...

RH6.2                                            win95

Pentium 233mmx                    486DX4 100
64M                                            32M
3com 3c905                              Realtek 8909
192.168.0.1                                192.168.0.5

I have connected these two with a X-over cable and installed tcp/ip on
the win 95 box and given them ip addresses. I can ping the machines own
card fine and dandy...
Let me stress I have no Samba, etc etc.

How come I can't ping the win95 from linux box and vice - versa ( it
times out)
I can see the activity leds light on both cards when I'm trying the ping
but no banana
Cable is good. (Tested )

I am undertaking a little self training here and believe me, I've rtfm!.

I'm at the stage where I think the reason is because I need Samba or
something similar...but I'm not so sure...I at least thought that I
would be able to ping each box from the other at the very least...

Any Ideas? Anyone?

Thanks
