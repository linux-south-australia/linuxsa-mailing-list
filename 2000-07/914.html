Hi Bruce,
Apparently they will be doing a *nix flavour soon, & Mac. I suspect it
will be a Pure Java application, for them to offer so many platforms so
quickly. I'll be running mine on OS/2 Warp, which has the fastest JVM on
the Intel platform, &lt;grin&gt;.

There has been some discussion on this topic in the last few weeks
or-so, look for ATO in the subject header.
Please do complain to them however, & politely mention that they may be
contravening the Trade Practices Act by forcing people to use Windows.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have just had one of those soul-destroying moments. My wife suggested
&gt; we lodge our tax return electronically, using the newly available ATO
&gt; system 'e-tax'. Sounds great, just log in and follow the promts on the
&gt; ATO web page... which include download the ATO e-tax software (20-30
&gt; mins) download the help files (20-30 mins) download the private key
&gt; encryption yadda yadda yadda, then the killer, system requirements,
&gt; including 'operating system Windows 95 or later'.
&gt; 
&gt; So, I thought I'd try to use the online suggestions box provided on that
&gt; page to gently request a Linux version... typitty tappity type, press
&gt; the magic SUBMIT button (but I'm darn well NOT going to submit, no
&gt; way!!!) and after the appropriate period of waiting...
&gt; 
&gt; An error has occurred which has prevented your feedback from being
&gt; posted. Please try again later.
&gt; 
&gt;               Error:-2147467259
&gt;               Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server;
&gt; SiteFeedback.AddResponse
&gt;               Timeout expired
&gt; 
&gt; What a useless waste of time. Good job I didn't actually do the
&gt; downloads before reading the instructions. After five years of Linux I
&gt; have actually been trained (at long last) to RTFM first.
