Hi Michael,

I'm not sure what a DDO is but are you asking about partitioning software for 
hard drives when the bios doesn't support it.  Check out the site of your 
hard drives manufacturer. ie Samsung have one called ezsetup and their's 
another one called Disk Manager.

&gt; HI there,
&gt; This is my first go at asking a question on this mailing list so please
&gt; bear with me.
&gt; *As an aside* - how does anyone find the time to read all these
&gt; messages?
&gt;
&gt; I was at the last linuxsa meeting (last Tuesday) and heard a brief
&gt; discussion of using DDO's with linux.
&gt; A comment from the back was *won't lilo overwrite the DDO* and this was
&gt; also my understanding.
&gt; As my BIOS will only read a 2GB hard drive, and I have 8.4GB and *shame*
&gt; need the BIOS for win95, I have had to use loadlin to load the linux
&gt; kernel from a dos menu before win95 kicks in.
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know for sure if lilo will do the above and will I be able
&gt; to worm my way out of it if it does.
&gt; Thanks if you can advise me.
&gt;
&gt; PS sorry to the bloke selling T-shirts - I said I was going to buy one
&gt; but had to leave - next time!
&gt; Michael
