Hi,

&gt; &gt; After all your set of commands are finite, the possible legal sequences
&gt; &gt; you put them together in is large but also finite.
&gt; 
&gt; No it is not.  It is infinite.  Some commands might not yet have been
&gt; created, but there is no limit to them.  Even if we say that the number of
&gt; commands is finite, it's still a very large number.  There are a maximum of
&gt; 16,000 different 8 by 8 pixel icons if you only 256 different colours, and
&gt; most of those look too similar to others to be useful.  Worse, 16,000
&gt; obviously different icons would be very hard to use.  How do you sort
&gt; through them to find the one you want?

Thats assuming that one GUI utility represents one CLI. Two arguments
agains that...
Many GUI utilities merge the functions of several similar CLIs (eg a file
manager will merge ls, cp, mv, find and some grep all into itself).
For the 16,000 diferent icons, you will have as much dificulty
differentiating through 16 000 very similar commands (even given the
ability to vary the length of the command name, and thus hacve slighly
more variability).
