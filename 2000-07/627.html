Paul!

&gt; They are the commands "export" and "jobs".  Do they actually have man or
&gt; info pages at all?  If so, where could I get them from?

This is because what you are seeing is part of the BASH shell itself.
Try this:

* man bash

Then type a slash (/), and type export. This will search for the word
export (or any other word you choose to search for). In fact, in many
unix-like tools the / is the command to search!

Just because I'm feeling "nice":

-- export VARIABLE=VALUE

This makes a variable called VARIABLE available to other programs,
shells and people. It does this using what is known as the environment.
Every logged on user has an "environment". It will become a part of the
environment of the user who executed this program.

So if I executed:

[localhost lloy0076]% export name=david

It would become part of "lloy0077's" environment but NOT part of roots,
reginald's etc etc. Put another way, every logged in user has their own
separate environments...

-- jobs

Typing this will show what jobs the current shall is running
asynchronously (in the background). If I did:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> root]#updatedb&
[<A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> root]#makewhatis&

Then these two "jobs" would appear if I typed in "jobs". You can't break
your'e system using this command, so it is safe to just run it and see
what it does...

&gt; (NB:  I'm using RH 6.1 with the HelixCode Gnome 1.2 interface, and bash
&gt; is the shell I'm using.)
