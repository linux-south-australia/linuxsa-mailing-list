Alex -- there is always someone who put in more effort than you. Obviously
you put a _lot_ of effort in. Some people stil put more effort in and got
less out. Some people are simply incapable of achieving what you have.
Anyway, I apologise for implying that you didn't put much effort in (on
re-reading, that's what it looks like I said, but that's not what I meant).
All I meant was that some people do not have the choice of what mail client
they use. I don't want to take this any further, and I personally don't care
about how the list does its filtering and so on (and I am one of he people
stuck with Outlook due to a state Government decree)...

Anyway, accept my apologies, and accept my statement of fact that some
people odn't have the choice for various reasons :)

&gt; I would like to point out to Alex that some people are not blessed
&gt; with the capacity to gain work in an environment that allows them
&gt; this freedom of choice. Some people struggle to get any work at all.
&gt; Some people put a _lot_ more  effort into getting work than he did,

Ouch :o(

How would you like it if I said that you didn't put as much effort
into organising the installfest as somebody else put into some other
event? That was an unqualified statement. You don't know what I did to
get where I am now.

If you had said that Simon Hackett or Steve Baxter put more effort
into getting work than I did, I would agree, as the ISP's that they
started from scratch have been more succesful than mine was.

However as I doubt that you knew that I effectively gave up 2 and a
half years of my life (financially) to start my own ISP with the
specific intention of increasing my employment chances, I challenge
your statment and request an apology.

Alex

P.S. I still maintain my original point which was if the list doesn't
work for you, then switch mail clients. If you can't switch mail
clients, don't expect the list maintainers to fix your problems
instead. I don't.

P.P.S Regardless of my opinion of you at the moment, I still maintain
that the Installfest was extremely well organised, and that nothing
but hearty congratulations are in order for all involved in it's
writing, compilation and execution. Well done.
