&gt; One way to find out :)
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; 	I am about to set up a small network (1 server/6-7 workstations) with
&gt; &gt; 	Linux on the server, and a combination of windoze and linux on the
&gt; &gt; 	workstations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 	The question I want to ask is which is the best distribution for the 
&gt; &gt; 	server ? I was simply going to install RedHat 6.2 and tweak it
&gt; &gt; 	according to my needs, but there now appears to be a plethora
&gt; &gt; 	of options available (e.g. Mandrake, Turbolinux), and I thought
&gt; &gt; 	I'd seek opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; It depends on what works for you. One distribution is not THAT much
&gt; different to another, since they all run on top of the same kernel
&gt; source. All I can recommend is that you try a few out before you settle on
&gt; one and see what meets your needs the best.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never used Slackware, Debian, or anything else, so I can't comment on
&gt; what they are like. I say try a couple of see what you like.

I'd say definately give Slackware a try.  I installed version 7.1
for the first time two nights ago - although the install is a little
utilitarian, it should be fine for anyone with a bit of experience (read,
easy for a 16 yr old with a year of use behind him), and it was the
//fastest// install I have ever seen.

I have not encountered any problems so far - generally, it's a
well-rounded, fast and stable distro.  Just don't expect nice integrated
GUI config tools (linuxconf / drakconf etc.) - still, editing config files
gets things done a lot quicker anyhow.  The BSD init system was something
new to me, but it seems a very simple and effective method.

The only downfall I can see is that lack of a robust packaging system -
however, slack's pkg tools are compact and easy to work with.  But I don't
think you would encounter many other apps packaged in this format on the
net.  Anyhow, installing from source is fine.

Just my thoughts :)

Tim
