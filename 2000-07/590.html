Hands up those who remember the large, three volume set of manuals from
Unix System V which I brought to the meeting a few months ago?  Here's
why Unix manuals rock and linux sucks:

  "Fsck is a multipass file system check program.  Each file system
 pass invokes a different phase of the fsck program.  After the
 initial setup, fsck performs successive phases over each file system
 performing cleanup, checking blocks and sizes, pathnames, connectivity,
 reference counts, and the free-block list (possibly rebuilding it)."
   -- System V/68 Administrator's Guide

This says (obscurely, but quite explicitly later in the manual) that the
last phase of fsck is reconstructing the free-block list.  If an
unreferenced file is found (one which appears in no directory), fsck
creates a link in the lost+found directory, which must appear in the root
of the file system being checked.  However since the free-list is not known
to be valid, fsck cannot allocate any blocks to create the directory if it
does not already exist, or to extend it should it be full.  (Under these
circumstances fsck offers the chance to delete the file or leave it
allocated but unreferenced.)

Obviously one must check blocks and sizes before checking the free list
(the free list is what remains after discovering the blocks in use) but
there is no reason why the free list cannot be rebuilt before checking
pathnames and reference counts.  Some versions of fsck do this (e.g. BSD.)
I don't know (or much care) which way linux does it.

If you wish to pre-allocate a lost+found directory, try this:

 mkdir lost+found
 cd lost+found
 for f in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f; do
   touch 0$f 1$f 2$f 3$f 4$f 5$f 6$f 7$f 8$f 9$f a$f b$f c$f d$f e$f f$f
 done
 rm *
