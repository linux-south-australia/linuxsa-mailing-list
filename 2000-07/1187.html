&gt; 
&gt; No, he wanted a gui that was as easily expressive as a cli.  (He claimed
&gt; you could not make one.)  His backup example was flawed, just like a simile
&gt; which fails to make a convincing argument. :-)  Pity to denounce his theory
&gt; because of a bad example...
&gt; 
&gt; Had he been just a little more explicit, he might have said that he wanted
&gt; to take one incremental backup per week of all of his spreadsheets, and all
&gt; of his letters except those which he signed, "your loving husband."  The
&gt; letters which he signed "your loving husband" only need to be backed up
&gt; after 8 weeks.
&gt; 
&gt; In CLI: weekly cron job:
&gt; 
&gt;   cp `find ~ -name '*.ss' -mtime -7 -print` \
&gt;    `find ~ -name '*.ltr' -mtime -7 \( -exec tail -1 {} \|
&gt;        grep -q "your loving husband" \; -o -print \)` \
&gt;    `find ~ -name '*.ltr' -mtime -63 -mtime +56 -exec tail -1 {} \|
&gt;        grep -q "your loving husband" \; -print` \
&gt;    /mnt/zip
&gt; 
&gt; When you've found a widget which permits this sort of result, I'll want you
&gt; to stop backing up spreadsheets which have a net present value of less than
&gt; the mean group capitalisation unless the forwarded projected profit exceeds
&gt; the shareholder liability.  And if it doesn't run nicely on a 16MB i486 I'm
&gt; not interested.
&gt; 

I think this is gettign away form the interface into a programming
language.

You are in effect writing small(and maybe noit so small) programs to do
this.

This is my opinion is not an example of the command line interface, it is
an example of a programming languiage, whch you happen to nbe able to
enter directly into a command line interface.

Youare talking about the expressiveness of a language not a particular
interface prardigm.

You can program a machine with a gui interface too.

You can write programs on guis.(whether or nto it is desirable, efficient
or whatever is another qeustion but it is possible.

i agree thetr is not liekly to be a single widget to do any of the tings
you want ot do above, but you are not suing single commands either. you
are using multiple commands joined with pipes.

There is no reason why you cna't have gui invoked/driven progams that do
the same thing asnd soe sort of ipc to join them together.
