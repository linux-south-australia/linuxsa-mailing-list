There's a nice feature in FreeBSD 4.x which deserves comment here.

It's called "Jail", and it was written by Poul-Henning Kamp &lt;<A HREF="mailto:phk@freebsd.org">phk@freebsd.org</A>&gt;.
It's basically an extension of chroot()  (hint:  man 2 chroot)

The most obvious difference between a jail and a chroot()ed section of
the filesystem is that a jail has its own hostname and IP address.  This
can be used to set up virtual "sandboxes" for virtual servers which 
require a bit more partitioning than http 1.1 can provide.

For example, one of my freelance customers has a box which has 8 "jailed"
domains.  Each domain runs its own instance of inetd, sendmail and apache
on its own IP address.  When you "telnet" to one of the jailed IP addresses
you end up on the same physical hardware as the other jailed IP addresses,
but it "feels" like a completely independent machine.  Users belonging
to the organizations served by the "jailed" domains can use their personal
virtual-server's IP address as an SMTP server, HTTP server, and POP3 
server;  They can use the same system's non-jailed IP address as a HTTP
proxy (it's running squid).

The are restrictions on what a jailed root user can do, to prevent root
from breaking out of a jail.  There's a set of system calls which cannot
be run by root (including the jail() system call itself), thereby preventing
the kind of breakouts which are trivial to do on chroot()-based sandboxes.
You can also use the kernel's IP filtering to determine what kind of 
network traffic is acceptable to each jail (the root user inside a 
jail does not have privileges to change the IP filter lists;  this must
be done from a non-jailed context).

It's by no means perfect, and the illusion of being on a separate machine
is easily broken:  For example, "ps" shows a flag for each process in a 
sandbox, so if someone has broken into a jail you can't really make them
think they're on a non-jailed system.  But that isn't really the point.
The feature makes it very easy to set up arbitrary virtual servers, even
for services which don't lend themselves to virtualization (such as, say,
POP3:  If you have the same system handling foo.com.au and bar.org.au
mail domains, and both domains have a user called "quux", how does the 
POP3 server know whether to hand over <A HREF="mailto:quux@foo.com.au">quux@foo.com.au</A>'s mail or
<A HREF="mailto:quux@bar.org.au">quux@bar.org.au</A>'s mail when "quux" logs in on the POP3 server?  With Jail,
the two domains have their own IP addresses, so it's easily worked out).

When setting it up, you create a skeleton filesystem for each jailed
environment;  It can be as complicated or as simplistic as you like.  For
example, if your jail is ONLY going to run apache and nothing else, the 
amount of stuff you need to put in the jail filesystem area is necessarily
less than what you'd have to stuff in there if you wanted to handle incoming
telnets from software developers (:-).  You can also do loopback mounts if,
for example, you want to provide a jail with an exact copy of your 
/usr or /usr/local filesystem.  Each jail usually gets a /proc mount so 
"ps" and friends will work too.  

I usually put a startup script which starts the daemons which are supposed
to run the jail into /usr/jail/domain.name/etc/rc, then at boot time I
arrange to have the system execute:

   /usr/sbin/jail /usr/jail/domain.name domain.name 192.168.1.2 sh /etc/rc

The "sh /etc/rc" bit is executed inside the jail, so it's really referring
to /usr/jail/domain.name/etc/rc, which is my startup script.  Basically,
any processes started by that script, and any of their descendents, will
be limited to /usr/jail/domain.name, will receive the string "domain.name"
from the gethostname() system call, and will be able to accept or originate
network connections on 192.168.1.2.  Other jails for other domains are kept
in /usr/jail/*;  there's no real limit on the number of jails which can
be supported by a single system.
