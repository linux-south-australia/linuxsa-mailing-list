Thanks for the responses.

So far it appears to be between Debian and FreeBSD :)

I'm guilty of not being as clear as I'd hoped, however, so at the
risk of annoying everyone I'll clarify my position.

For my purposes, I'm after a good base to work from - I'm not worried
about the distribution having swish gui interfaces or automatic detection
of various cards - the first thing I'll do is recompile the kernel to remove
the excess fat, and to include support for the various hardware. A
comment regarding the 'hackability' of RedHat is interesting.

I currently have a slightly smaller, but similar, setup with the server 
running RedHat, with all of the functionality of the previous message.
Due to the nature of the new work I'm undertaking, I'd need better
security than I have currently so I'd prefer a base where everything
was denied and has the most recent versions of sendmail, dns etc etc.


I'm intrigued to hear about FreeBSD being a more stable option (now
I really _will_ start a war - sorry). Just for the record, I'm a dyed in the
wool linux fan - I've used it since kernel version 0.10 (not a typo - this was
before login shells were available - I did my masters thesis using it and
TeX) - but I'm certainly eager to hear good information. Perhaps off-list
replies could be considered for those wishing to avoid flames :)

thanks for your patience,
ted
