&gt; &gt; I'd recommend Debian.  Why, well because that's what I use:-) But
&gt; &gt; seriously, it does have the best package management software of any
&gt; &gt; distribution (except for those distributions which are basically a
&gt; &gt; modified Debian anyway).  And it is the most stable distribution.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, other people have recommended Debian to me as well.  I've been
&gt; trying to install it for over a week.  I'm not stupid, I've installed
&gt; most flavours of BSD and Linux with no problems, but I can't get
&gt; Debian to recognize my Ethernet board.  I'm not alone in this: I had
&gt; the CTO of a large Linux services company here last weekend, and he
&gt; tried in vain to help (admittedly, he's not a Debian guru).

Have you tried asking help from the <A HREF="mailto:debian-user@lists.org.au">debian-user@lists.org.au</A> mailing
list?  In my experience they are generally pretty helpful?  Indeed, it
was one of the things which attracted me to Debian.

Warning --- the list has a lot of traffic, so if you subscribe, make
sure you are willing to cope with large volume.  Perhaps the thing to
do at this stage would be just to email to the above address without
subscribing.  Explain in your message that you aren't actually
subscribed; that you haven't used Debian before and are trying to get
your ethernet card recognised.  Hopefully you will get some useful
feedback.  (Occasionally I need to send a repeat email because it gets
lost in all the volume.)  Anyway, in general they are a pretty helpful
lot --- the Debian user community.

&gt; How about an installability competition on Saturday?  In any case,
&gt; I'll bring my box, and we can see if anybody can get a recent potato
&gt; running on it.

Unfortunately I won't be able to be there.

Cheers,

Mark.
