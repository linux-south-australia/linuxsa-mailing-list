&gt;&gt; I take it that extmail.bigpond.com is your defined SMTP smarthost.

&gt; no, i assumed it was the same machine as mail.bigpond.com
&gt; it doesnt appear that way, (diff ip addresses, hardly conclusive but...)
&gt; anyhow, 'extmail' isnt mentioned in *any* file in /etc. go figure.

Name:    extmail.bigpond.com
Address:  139.134.5.153

Name:    mail.bigpond.com
Address:  139.134.5.160

Hmmm - maybe there's an MX there ...

mail.bigpond.com	preference = 10, mail exchanger = extmail.bigpond.com

Aha - that's why mail's being delivered to extmail.  You might want to try
changing ...

&gt; # Smart host
&gt; DSmail.bigpond.com

to DS[mail.bigpond.com], to switch off MX processing for that host (not
sure if it works there; I've only done that in mailertables before, and
don't have a spare machine here to test it).

This, of course, still depends on which mail server bigpond dialin
customers are supposed to be using.


&gt;&gt; they're being dropped after they've been accepted as part of some anti-
&gt;&gt; relay measure.

&gt; i thought something like that might be happening, but i don't know why. (or
&gt; have any proof other than lost mails)

Hang on, you're using the same setup to mail to here, and it's getting here OK.

Two things immediately jump out here.

1)  Bigpond are using NTMail, and I _hate_ NTMail (sorry, that's a
    personal issue).
2)  You're running Sendmail 8.9.3, but using an 8.8.7 configuration
    file; it'd be wise to update.

Apart from that, your problem lies elsewhere if you get to LinuxSA OK.

&gt; 
&gt; perhaps it checks to see if 'mibus.bigpond.com' exists, as it doesnt really.

Not in a Received header; maybe if it had appeared elsewhere (like in
the envelope).
