THE ULTIMATE KLUDGE
-------------------

Netscape 4.7 can only cope with a single POP service. Hence, if you have
multiple services or even multiple types of services (eg POP3, APOP,
IMAP) Netscape Messenger is not able to NATIVELY query each particular
service. Here is a way to kludge it:

* run a local SendMail

If you are really security conscious you can ipchains -j deny any
incoming SMTP connections. You need to run SendMail to get fetchmail to
behave itself. You need fetchmail to FETCH your mail!

* run a local POP or IMAP server

POP3 is the easiest to get going. Simply uncomment it from inetd.conf,
and make sure you run the inet daemon. You may want to ipchains -j deny
the POP3 port, but it is a TCP wrappered service hence you can enter
into your hosts.deny:

ALL:ALL

And in your hosts.allow:

ALL:LOCAL

This means that all TCP wrappered services (of which POP3 is one) will
not accept connections unless you are connecting locally.

* configure fetchamil

Easiest way to do this is with fetchmailconf under X. Run this as a
normal user. The settings are fairly self-explanatory and there is a lot
of help. Essentially set up all your accounts - the local "listener" is
the localhost. Most people call it localhost.localdomain althought
127.0.0.1 should work as well.

* configure netscape to collect POP from a local server

This is very easy to do.

* set up filters on the RECEIVE header to filter between the different
servers

All mail will go into a SINGLE mail box under this configuration. The
easiest way to filter the different mail is to use the RECEIVE header.
This isn't fault free but it should sort the mail sensibly. 

* get fetchmail to poll your ISP if this is what you want

You can either do:

- fetchmail -d [number of seconds]

Or create a crontab entry. I have created a crontab entry thus:

*/10 * * * * * fetchamil -d0

Please note that crontab entries simply DO NOT WORK AT ALL if you make a
mistake!

Now, whilst this is a MAJOR kludge it does actually work....

 Like his father carving wood he'd have made good
 Tables chairs, and open chests would've suited Jesus best
 He'd caused nobody harm - noone alarm!
