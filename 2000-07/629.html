I believe there is already a FrameMaker Beta version
out.

&gt; &gt; I have no concern with commercial software for
&gt; Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the concern is that the commercial ventures
&gt; might be able to
&gt; convince everyone that they own Linux. In the tarot
&gt; cards, the 15th card
&gt; is The Devil. The Devil has no real power over you
&gt; except that you
&gt; believe him. In the same way, Linux could become
&gt; open-source but closed
&gt; at the same time. People only have to believe that
&gt; Corel/RedHat/Suse/[version x] is the only Linux for
&gt; Linux to become
&gt; closed in effect.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have found that commercial Linux vendors
&gt; (mostly) offer a
&gt; &gt; superior service for a cheaper price than under
&gt; the Windows platform.
&gt; 
&gt; Only because Linux users won't pay higher. When they
&gt; do, they will both
&gt; be equal. Commercial vendors set their price by
&gt; commercial means. If you
&gt; work in business and you don't set your price in
&gt; this manner then you go
&gt; out of business.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; I suspect that Applixware, WP and others are top
&gt; of the range packages
&gt; &gt; (although I have not used them) and we should
&gt; encourage support for
&gt; &gt; commercial ventures in Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; I've never used ApplixWare but I've been told it's
&gt; good. Word Perfect
&gt; seems to be better than Word, though I use
&gt; StarOffice if I need a
&gt; WYSIWYG office application. As most would know I'm
&gt; one of these arcane
&gt; people who prefer to use a "meaning based" (wysiwym)
&gt; markup style
&gt; language.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the open source side, I have heard that there
&gt; is a fantastic OS word
&gt; &gt; processor (the name escapes me but is on the tip
&gt; of my tongue) that will be
&gt; &gt; improved over time and perhaps even rival the
&gt; commercial offerings.
&gt; 
&gt; Are you talking about Abi Word? It's part of the
&gt; GNOME office suite. In
&gt; addition there's rumour about that FrameMaker is
&gt; going to be released
&gt; commercially for Linux...
