Hi, people.

At the last meeting, there was a brief discussion about filesystem
security/verification products such as Tripwire and Veracity.  During
that discussion, mention was made of the fact that Tripwire, which was
once an open-source product, had been closed-up by the company which
owned it.

Well, that's a thing of the past, according to this slashdot story:
The new version of Tripwire will be GPLed.

If anyone has any lingering paranoia about the chances of someone 
breaking into their system and making changes to security-sensitive
software and config files without their knowledge, I'd heartily recommend
a product like tripwire.  For those who weren't at the meeting: it
works by building a database of cryptographically-generated signatures
of files on your filesystem, and when you re-run it at intervals in the
future it'll compare the new signatures against the ones it calculated
last time.  Using this method, it can pinpoint exactly which files on
your filesystems have been changed since the last time you executed it.
It's invaluable as a tool for determining whether a system has been
compromised by attackers, and identifying the files they've trojaned
if their attempts to gain root privileges have been successful.
