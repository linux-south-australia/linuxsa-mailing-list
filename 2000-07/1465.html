 in fact, it's not just the combination of CDRW media and certain
drives/players that don't work -- I've been told that certain combinations
of CD-R media, CD-R burners and CD players just don't get along... most CD
drives will read most CD-R, but even there, they sometimes don't like random
combinations of media and burner -- find something that works, and stick
with it...

Many "normal" CD players don't grok CD-RW media.  There are subtle
differences between the format of a "normal" audio CD and the format
of the data deposited by a CD-RW drive.

Some CD players don't care, others care a lot.  YMMV.

 &gt; - do I need the special audio CD-R's that people
 &gt; like TDK sell?

&lt;shrug&gt;  Give it a try.  They're cheap, so get a couple and
find out.

 &gt; - has anyone burnt audio CDs on a CD-RW drive that
 &gt; work in normal players? If so, what hardware,
 &gt; commands, etc... are you using?

Yes, I've done it on a Mac with Toast.  I didn't use the "gold" blank
media, though.

The gold disks are pretty funny, really:  The recordable surface is 
actually the underside of the label, which is why it's so important
to use the right pen to write on it and avoid scratching it :-)
