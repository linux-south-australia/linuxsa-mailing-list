Just thought I'd add my experiences to this as well.

CDRW discs are not friendly to most cdroms/players due to their coating not
offering enough reflective difference between a '1' and a '0'. Other people
have pointed it out as well and it seems to be very true. They are however
great for anything on the system that created them. Any other drive will be
a case of 'suck it and see'.

In my humble experience (just over 2 years with burners), coloured
(BLUE/GREEN)discs are trouble for anything but data. They may play  audio
well on your PC but good luck on car CD players and Discmans. I find them
about as useful for audio as a Spice Girl album. Silver discs are only
marginally better. For audio I keep to the 'golden' rule, if it ain't gold
then I trust it as far as I can comfortably spit a live rat. I don't trust
'audio' blanks either. They generally aren't worth the extra money.

Just as some readers are picky, so are some burners. Find a media that suits
your burners/players. My preferred brand is Kodak Gold. They aren't the
cheapest but they have never failed me for any reason. I also use MR Data
which I get from Kmart. They come in various pack sizes from single to 50
stacks. The 50 stack for around $65 is great value. I have done audio, data
and Playstation on them. NB I have only used their (very light)gold coated
ones with a blue label. The only fault with these is they scratch easier
than the Kodaks. They also have a blue or silver coated one that I haven't
tried. 

Xcdroast is a cow until you get it going. When you succeed it is well worth
it. Make sure you set up the image directories AND PERMISSIONS before you
run it. When you do first run it, it will make you specify all sorts of
things. Do this very carefully or it will crash and not burn!! (OK that was
a bad joke) There is an error log for it that sometimes helps.

For those who want to use CDRECORD, here is a brief outline on what to do.

Check with the cdrecord home page first to see that your burner is
supported. It also has links to man pages of mkisofs, mkhybrid, cdda2wave,
etc.

cdrecord.html
This is also a very good idea BEFORE you buy a burner. 
Most Linux gui based software is just front ends for CDRECORD.

For audio, you first have to turn the native audio tracks into .wav files
using cdda2wav or cdparanoia. 

Create the iso image file using mkisofs or mkhybrid-  
mkisofs -r -o /IMAGEFILENAME /PATHOFWHATYOUWANTTOBURN

Burn it-
cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,3,0 /IMAGEFILENAME
Refer to the man page for 'dev' settings as yours will probably be different
to mine.
To avoid making coasters use the '-dummy' switch to test write disks first.

If any of this made any sense, don't blame me.

On Friday, July 28, 2000 2:27 AM, heaps of people told me:
&gt; [stuff]

Thanks to everyone who responded so quickly.  Pity I 
have to work, otherwise I'd have gone home and tried a 
lot of the suggestions by now!

I'll email my solution (if found), as it seems as if most 
people have had problems doing this at some stage or other.
It might help others feel more comfortable about buying
CDRW drives too.

BTW, I discovered that even the latest dev version of cdrecord 
doesn't yet support 8x writing speed with CD-R's, so I still 
can't make full use of the drive under Linux. Don't know about 
the Adaptec easy-CD stuff for WinXX though....

Thanks,

Dean
