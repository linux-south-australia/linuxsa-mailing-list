&gt; blitzd ring any bells for anyone?

Yes, it's a lauchpad for a denial of service attack.  Here's the README
for Blitznet (downloadable from <A HREF="http://www.self-evident.com/security/dos">http://www.self-evident.com/security/dos</A>)

II. Concept
-----------
   A Blitz Network's purpose in a nutshell; to
launch a spoofed syn flood attack via slice2 from
many different computers without logging on any
of them.


III. Usage
----------
   How it works; two files are placed on all of
computers which will be the actual 'attackers.'
One file is the daemon (blitzd) and the other is
the actual spoofed syn flooder (slice2).  (NOTE:
slice2 is a seperate program and I did not code
it)  After the two files have been placed on
an 'attacker' computer, blitzd should be executed
as such:
  nohup ./blitzd &lt;port&gt; &lt;stealth&gt; &
The port argument may be any port you wish, and
the stealth argument must be a one-word string
used to mask the process name in the process
table.  (NOTE: The stealth option is known not
to work on *BSD* systems)

  After doing this to several (100's ?) of
computers, you must now prepare the host
that you will use to control all of these
attack computers.  Four files will be needed
for your main computer (preferrably your
localhost), rush.tcl, shell.list, blitz,
and strobe. (NOTE: rush.tcl uses blitz to connect
to each attacker computer, and strobe is used
to check if hosts are up, when you use the
'-check' option.) The remaining file you
must create yourself is shell.list, whose
contents should look like this:
192.9.49.33     31337
199.185.137.3   9999
216.200.201.193 6969

Each line represents an attack computer.
The first part is the ip address of the
computer, and the second part is the
port that that attack computer has blitzd
listening on. Spacing does not matter here,
1 and 100 spaces are treated equally.
However, the first blank line rush.tcl
encouters in shell.list, rush.tcl will
stop reading from the file.  This is so
that you can keep other notes/information
at the bottom of shell.list like your
l/p to microsoft.com!

  Now, by running './rush.tcl' or
'tclsh rush.tcl' you will be shown the
syntax of how to control your new
BlitzNet. The syntax should appear as:
  rush (for blitz) v0.4.7 by phreeon
  syntax: ./rush -check | &lt;source&gt; &lt;dest[,dest]&gt; &lt;start&gt; &lt;stop&gt; &lt;dupes&gt; &lt;duration&gt;

  You may run rush.tcl in two modes: the check
mode, or attack mode. By running the check mode:
  ./rush.tcl -check
This will use strobe to check which of your
attacker computers are down, so that you may
logon them and restart blitzd as shown earlier.

  In the attack mode of rush.tcl, you simply
follow the syntax starting from &lt;source&gt;. So
Say you have one target at the ip address of
1.2.3.4, you would attack him like so:
./rush.tcl 0 1.2.3.4 1 600 10 400

  That line will attack 1.2.3.4 with random
source addresses (0 == random source addresses),
on ports 1 to 600 (where most important services
run), using 10 dupes (duplicate threads of slice2),
for 400 seconds (360 is normal timeout in seconds
for ircd servers).

  You may also use multiple targets, and rush.tcl
will split up the attack computers evenly among
the targets. To attack multiple targets, a line
like such would work:
./rush.tcl 0 1.2.3.4,6.7.8.9,10.11.12.13 1 600 10 400

  Multiple targets must only be seperated by 1 comma
and NO SPACES.

  Well, that should do it for this release of BlitzNet!
Do not packet too much :\
