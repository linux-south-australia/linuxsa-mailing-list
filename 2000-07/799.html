&gt;           No pre-registration necessary.

Although, as Geoffrey mentioned below, please do tell
<A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A> if you or a friend are planning on bringing a
machine.

&gt; Presentation:
&gt; 
&gt;   In lieu of the the usual presentation, this month we will be having
&gt;   a mini-InstallFest for those people who were unable to have their
&gt;   machines attended to due to the great demand we saw on Saturday.
&gt;   Richard Russell will also be giving a post-InstallFest report if I
&gt;   can convince him to :-).

heh -- thanks for the warning :)

Sure, I'll give it a whirl... I assume David Newall will be there with
T-Shirts-a-plenty at discounted prices (David?), and I will bring all the
spare documentation that I found along with some surveys to fill in. 

&lt;snip&gt;
 
&gt;   Could people willing to help with installs please bring powerboards
&gt;   and CDs, as those are the items we are mostly likely to be short of
&gt;   on Tuesday.

I beleive that there are no free CDs left -- we gave them all away... I will
bring any I can find, and so should others, if they have them. Label
anything you want to get back. Also, I lost a Storm Linux CD (from a
magazine) on the day, and would appreciate getting it back -- I will burn a
copy for someone if they give it back to me :)

I assume someone has thought about desks at Compaq?
