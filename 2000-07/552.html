&gt; &gt; &gt; Just out of interest, what are people's favorite webmail sites? Does
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone use their local ISP webmail?

I use my ISP's webmail interface to read mail when I'm not at home.  Works fine
for me, but I don't filter over webmail.  LinuxSA/Installfest are the only lists
to which I'm subscribed that have large traffic during the [Australian] day so
it's a non-issue.  After hours when I download mail is another - without client
filtering I'd be lost :-)

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yahoo mail does not work properly with Japanese characters. I prefer hotmail 
&gt; &gt; to Yahoo mail.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't most other major mailing lists put a [LISTNAME] prefix onto their
subject
&gt; lines?  It would solve more than one person's problem here.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a reason that the LinuxSA admins haven't made this happen, or is it
&gt; just a whim thing?  And I'm not wanting to start the usual flame war..  just
&gt; asking out of interest :o)

This is almost a FAQ.  I think Richard Russell said that today as well.
Basically most email clients can distinguish LinuxSA via filtering without
having to clutter up the subject line with excess characters.  Webmail is the
new addition to the problem which hasn't been discussed to death AFAIK.

With some tweaking the problem is probably email solveable on webmail interfaces
without resorting to the solution that has (in the past) raised the temperature
of the list dramatically.

Michael...

P.S. Don't forget to come to installfest on Saturday!
