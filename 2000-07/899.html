To cut a long story short
I can ping between 2 Linux RH 6.2 boxes but I can't ftp to one of them. As
ftp is supposedly set up to default to accept anonymous I must have changed
something. I've looked for a FTP HOW-TO but all assume anonymous is
accepted.
Can anyone help.

Longer story
PC1 is a new drive with new RH62 installed in the Toshiba laptop
PC2 is the old Toshiba drive in another PC with the old RH62 installed
I want to grab some of the old files from it.

Regards

&gt;Hi,

&gt;have just converted my Win95 to Win2000, and am now having trouble

&gt;seem to remember some discussion on Samba (current generation) not working
&gt;with Win2000, and Samba TNG not working with Win 95. Are there any
solutions
&gt;which will work with both ?

Someone has already replied with a suggeston to use the plaintext password
hack, which I understand works.

However, Samba-TNG 2.5 Good works with Win2000 and Windows 95/98, but I am
having printing problems with it (I have never managed to track them down,
as I mainly use Samba 2.0.7 rather than TNG).

A problem that does exist, however, is that Samba TNG is somewhat difficult
to use.  This is something that I hope to document betterm, but there is a
little matter of more pressing work that I am being paid for[1] :-)

[1]There is the little matter of writing a User's and Developer's Guide for
Ethereal, as well as the new dissector for BXXP that I am being paid to
write.
