&gt;&gt;&gt; Anybody else notice that this comparison is skewed by the fact that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; SCSI drives are 10,000 rpm while the ATA drive is only 7,200 rpm?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Surely this would effect the latency...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It has an even greater effect on throughput because the speed of disk
&gt;&gt; transfer is proportional to rpm.  Why?  You can't transfer a track in
&gt;&gt; less time than it takes the track to pass under the read/write head.
&gt;&gt; A drive spinning at 10000rpm is approximately 40% faster than one
&gt;&gt; spinning at 7200rpm.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Just to be quite accurate, modern drives have large on-board caches,
&gt;&gt; which permit them to return from a write immediately.  Read operations
&gt;&gt; don't benefit quite so much unless you read in the order that the
&gt;&gt; drive electronics predicted (assuming the drive does read ahead, which
&gt;&gt; is likely.)
&gt;
&gt; It's true that this is one of the major factors, but the other is density.
&gt; If you increase the density then you can read more information in the
&gt; same amount of time. I've just bought some Fujitsu ATA drives that
&gt; are 5400 rpm and give better performance that older IBM 7200 rpm
&gt; SCSI drive.

For some definition of "performance".  Higher densities improve
sequential access; higher rpms improve random access.
