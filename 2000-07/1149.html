&gt; &gt; How could anybody argue that we no longer need CLI's?  It's silly.

You are confusing your ability to use cli, with a need to do so.  The Dos cli,
has had no further work done on it since the advent of Win95, NT's version has
had only two extra commands added. The world did not come to an end with it's
deprecation. The commands of the cli are  powerful, useable and mature, the
interface is from a bygone era and belongs in the history books.

My self opinionated remarks are as bad as your's in the sense that my original
post was simply to point people at two interesting urls on the subject. It was
not intended to degenerate back into a cli vs gui warz. I can only point ppl to
those urls because they don't discuss which is better, they simply offer
interesting frameworks where both work.
