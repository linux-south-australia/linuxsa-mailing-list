&gt; Ok we have a Linux Server (RH6.2) that is hosting our own domain
&gt; (www.stellaris.com.au)
&gt; We have a permanent connection our ISP.
&gt; 
&gt; Now we have a few clients that would like us to host their domains. Now this
&gt; is not something that we want to get into in a big way at all but we would
&gt; like to host a few domains that we do a lot work for.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok I guess we have to sort out a full and correct DNS server on our box.

Doesn't need to be on your box, but it will make it easier to maintain if
it is.

&gt; Next our ISP would have to assign (sell/rent) us some IP's from their
&gt; list??? Yes / No ???

No. I run 6 domains on one IP address. If you want to pay your ISP for
extra IP addresses when its not really necessary, go ahead :)

&gt; Re-delegate to name to the new IP on our box???

The domain names you want to host must point to an IP address on your box,
whether that is the single one you already have, or if you get more, that
is up to you.

&gt; STOP here is where I get lost! :-) We have our IP assigned to our box how do
&gt; we assign multiple IP/domains to our box?

/sbin/ifconfig ppp0:1 new.ip.address.1
/sbin/ifconfig ppp0:2 new.ip.address.2
/sbin/ifconfig ppp0:3 new.ip.address.3
 
&gt; I'm not looking for the full "go to this config file" answer just the big
&gt; picture theory.

It really depends on what exactly you mean by 'host'. Do you mean just web
site or do you mean email and ftp as well? If you mean web only, the
fastest, and simplest way, is to just get the DNS records for the domain
you are going to host, to point the 'www' address to your current IP
address, then configure Apache to run virtual hosts. If you want to do
email as well, then that takes a little bit more configuration, but it is
still not difficult.

If you want any help setting it up, email me at <A HREF="mailto:darryl@ross.wattle.id.au">darryl@ross.wattle.id.au</A>
and I'm more than willing to help you out with it. As I said, I'm hosting
quite a number of domains on one machine with one IP address, so it can be
done.
