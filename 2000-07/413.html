And you don't need samba at this stage.

&gt; How come I can't ping the win95 from linux box and vice - versa ( it

&gt; I can see the activity leds light on both cards when I'm trying the ping
&gt; but no banana

&gt; I am undertaking a little self training here and believe me, I've rtfm!.

I presume you've tested the network cards previously? My guess is that the
transmitter  portion  of  the Realtek card could be blown. But then it may
also be an IRQ conflict on the win95 box.

Try removing any extra cards (like soundcards) from the Win95 machine, and
give that a go (may need to go into the BIOS and force a reset of the EscD
PnP portion).

Or  you  could try putting the Realtek card in the linux box, and plugging
the  cable  in  to  both  cards and try to ping it from there. If it still
doesn't work, you may have a faulty nic.

&gt; I'm at the stage where I think the reason is because I need Samba or
&gt; something similar...but I'm not so sure...I at least thought that I
&gt; would be able to ping each box from the other at the very least...

Nope, you don't need samba to ping.
