Hi Michael,

 From my own experience ide timeouts are a hard drive fault.

&gt; Last night I was testing the ability to do Linux NFS image installs for no real
&gt; reason 'cept the upcoming installfest :-) and I ended up getting the worst hard
&gt; disk corruption I have ever seen.
&gt; 
&gt; First, my setup:  a Cyrix 686 120Mhz box with 64M Ram, PCI thin ethernet card,
&gt; dual IDE controller.  hda is a 6G disk mounted as /home.  hdb is a 1.2G disk
&gt; mounted as /.  hdc is a finicky local 50x CDROM.
&gt; 
&gt; I mounted the Red Hat distro from hdc as /mnt/cdrom.  I exported it via NFS with
&gt; /mnt/cdrom (ro,insecure) in /etc/exports and kicked the appropriate daemons.
&gt; 
&gt; So across my thin coax line I did an NFS install which worked nicely albeit
&gt; slowly.
&gt; 
&gt; During the install I could see the hard disk light on the server whirl away. 
&gt; This is strange thinks me, what the server is doing is lifting data from hdc on
&gt; one IDE channel, hand balling it to the PCI ethernet card for the network.  Why
&gt; is the hard disk whirling?  Hmmm.  Just ignored it.  The CDROM, hard drive light
&gt; and the LEDs on the ethernet card were all in sync.   Hmmm.
&gt; 
&gt; Well the install finished and the hard disk light on the server stayed lit. 
&gt; Hmmm.  Looking back at the console I see my X desktop has frozen.  Hmmm. 
&gt; Switching to a virtual console sees IDE0 timeouts, but I can't log in.  Hmmm. 
&gt; Time for power cycle.  (I guess I could have rebooted the newly installed box
&gt; and tried telneting in, but I if login from virtual terminal didn't work I
&gt; didn't think telnet would either)
&gt; 
&gt; So I power cycle.  hdb on the server needed fscking, but was painless.  hda
&gt; failed the powerup fsck and needed more attention.  Dropping into single user I
&gt; really fscked it.  There were only a couple of THOUSAND errors spread throughout
&gt; the drive.  Home directories, /home/local (sym link on /usr/local) all stuffed
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; So, finally, my question, how could NFS-exporting my CDROM on hdc (IDE1) cause
&gt; timeouts on IDE0, cause the machine to lock up AND corrupt the /home (hda on
&gt; IDE0) filesystem which would have been really quiet at the time?
&gt; 
&gt; Huh?
&gt; 
&gt; Michael...
