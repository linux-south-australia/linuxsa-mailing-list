&gt; With the Gui vs Cli debate, one idea would be to implement Cli
&gt; structures graphically.

An issue of Dr Dobbs about four years ago (found it - December '95)
describes a Visual Programming language called Cube which uses a
three dimensional visual notation to represent computing elements.
In the article, it's interesting how a function (say, factorial)
shows visually the algorithm it contains, and functions are linked
by literally drawing lines between boxes.  The URL I have for it
(although the site appears down at the moment, or at least depressed)
is <A HREF="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/personal/najork/cube.html">http://research.compaq.com/SRC/personal/najork/cube.html</A> .

And as an aside, one of the Window Managers I used to use was one
called GWM, for Generic Window Manager.  What I liked about this
one was that it was driven by a language called WOOL, for (from
memory) Windows Object Oriented LISP.  The WM ran in about 150K
or so of memory, and everything WMish about it was completely
programmable.  Pity you had to be au fait with LISP though (it's
one of those languages that I could never get to imprint on my
brain unless I used it regularly).  In fact, I think I'll grab
me a copy and try it again, as that web site still appears up.

&gt; With pipes, it seems natural to allow pipes between things in
&gt; a graph like structure.

But pipe flow (in real life as well as CS :-) is one way (although
you can have bidirectional pipes, they tend to block your program
when the other side is ready to listen to what you have to send,
and vice versa).

&gt; (And indeed they don't, take standard error for example ---
&gt; but expressing multiple outputs is tricky on a command line.)

But doable (well, more doable in Bourne than Csh, anyway (waits
to see if another Holy War is sparked :-)).  But yes, it would
be nice to be able to set up arbitrary processes and route
their input/output flows like the mere packets of cattle that
they purport to be.
