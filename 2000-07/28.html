&gt; Apple rode on the back of a far superior chip design, the MC680x and
&gt; MC680x0.

Although they did this after the introduction of the IBM PC.  Prior to
that they rode on the back of the 6502.

&gt; Motorola shot themselves in the foot by making the 68000 binary
&gt; incompatible with the 6809.

I'm not sure.  Intel are still paying big-time by providing binary
compatibility for 8086.  Note that 8086 is not binary compatibile with
8080, nor is that chip compatibile with 4004.  (cf 6800 -&gt; 6809 -&gt; 68000)

&gt; Apart from their clearly superior OS design (gui et al), they had it
&gt; made with a 'better' cpu. This did not translate to a better overall
&gt; architecture (to the PC) because of Apple's ferocious protection of
&gt; 'their' design.

It's one of life's ironies that the openness of the Apple ][ was
emulated by IBM with their PC, but not by Apple with their Macintosh.
Mind you, the PC is crappy, because IBM (and successors) have had to
support dweeb hardware.  Can you think of a single reason why EMM is
still supported, let alone XMS?  Neither are particularly good, and
if the PC had been closed I'm sure IBM would (eventually) have come
up with a RAM expansion regime that was a little less ugly.  Apple
had similar problems with the ][, and (they say) they wanted to avoid
them with Mac, hence they closed the Mac architecture.

&gt; [Apple] brought down Motorola as well who finally gave up the race 486
&gt; vs 040.

Motorola fell out with Apple because of the Mac clone debacle.  Having
promised the world Mac clones, Motorola spent considerable money on
their Mac clone and they were rightfully irked when Apple refused to
let them sell it.


&gt; [Motorola] poured billions into their 680x0 series to the benefit of
&gt; Apple, who did not reciprocate (or understand) that Motorola needed
&gt; volume to cover the cost.

Now, now, this is not a fair criticism.  Apple was not the first major
consumer of MC68000 (I think NCR might have been), and I cannot see
the argument that Motorola designed that family for Apple's benefit.
Further, Apple was one of the largest consumer's of the chip for a
decade.  Motorola did very nicely out of Apple.
