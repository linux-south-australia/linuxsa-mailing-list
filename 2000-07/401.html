Hi,

The NIC's I use are 3COM 3C905C-TX-M. It's a 10/100MB Fast Etherlink III XL
PCI card.
I have two of these in my Redhat 6.2 server and one in one of my RH6.2
workstations.
They were very easy to setup and work very well.
The only problem I have with them is that I don't know how to get the
Wake-On-Lan
working under linux.
The other network cards I use are 3COM 3C509's. These are 10Mbit ISA cards
which
are also Linux friendly.


Stuart.

Subject: Please suggest a Linux friendly network card


Hi people,

Short notice, but I have just decided to get a network card (the installfest

has prompted me and I want it before then).

Can anyone suggest a good network card that is Linux friendly?  I am sure 
this will probably provoke a flame war, but I need to know before I go out 
and fork out my hard earned dough.

Regards,

Ian
