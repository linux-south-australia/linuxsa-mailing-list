&gt;&gt; Also under RAID conditions, the SCSI drives would have a huge leap in
&gt;&gt; performace of the IDE drives.
&gt; 
&gt; Why?  You need to substantiate that claim.  It doesn't correspond to
&gt; my own observations.  To make things fair, we need to assume one
&gt; controller per drive for ATA, of course.

I feel you just did substantiate the claim.  It's not common to have
just one drive in a RAID set :-) and as you say, with more than one
drive per controller ATA performs badly.  Certainly a five drive RAID
set could also have five IDE controllers, mind you, then you have to
consider increased interrupt latency (as you poll to find which device
on the necessarily shared IRQ requires servicing.)

Perhaps worrying about interrupt service time is a little feeble, but
so is expecting to have n IDE controllers in an n drive system where
n is some typically large number.

I suggest IDE is popular in home systems because it's cheap, and SCSI
is popular in business systems because it's fast.  (IPI seems faster.)
