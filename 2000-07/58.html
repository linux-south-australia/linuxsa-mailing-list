Hi people of Linuxland,

I have noticed that there many requests for and offers to exchange software 
around Adelaide.  With the marvelous modem and other technologies that we 
have at our disposal today, why can we not band together and create a 
dial-up public Linux / Open Source archive?  The only drawback is without 
membership fees, it may have to be a backyard operation with small perhaps 
not even 56k modem pool, but who cares?

Or even better, why can't LinuxSA have a physical location for a public CD 
library or non-profit burning service?  I would happily volunteer the 
services of my CD burner for one (if someone can help me get the IDE damn 
thing to work under Linux - a Ricoh R/RW).  I live near the city, so people 
are more than welcome to drop CDs off to be copied or request copies of 
anything that I already have (which is not substantial as I still class 
myself a newbie, even if an experienced newbie).

Even better, perhaps we could lobby our local libraries to stock GPL CDs of 
all description, kindly donated by the SA Linux community for the benefit of 
SA?  Local libraries could do with more justification for increased funding 
and opening hours by increasing and diversifying their patronage.

Just an idea, I'm known for those.

Ian McLeod
