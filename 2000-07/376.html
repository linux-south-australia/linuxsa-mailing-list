&gt; Aha - that's why mail's being delivered to extmail.  You might want to try
&gt; changing ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; # Smart host
&gt; &gt; DSmail.bigpond.com
&gt; 
&gt; to DS[mail.bigpond.com], to switch off MX processing for that host (not
&gt; sure if it works there; I've only done that in mailertables before, and
&gt; don't have a spare machine here to test it).
done, and yes it appears to go to mail.bigpond.com:

&gt; This, of course, still depends on which mail server bigpond dialin
&gt; customers are supposed to be using.
mail.bigpond.com


&gt; &gt;&gt; they're being dropped after they've been accepted as part of some anti-
&gt; &gt;&gt; relay measure.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i thought something like that might be happening, but i don't know why. (or
&gt; &gt; have any proof other than lost mails)
&gt; 
&gt; Hang on, you're using the same setup to mail to here, and it's getting here OK.
that's why its taken me ages to realise i was actually losing mail.

&gt; 
&gt; Two things immediately jump out here.
&gt; 
&gt; 1)  Bigpond are using NTMail, and I _hate_ NTMail (sorry, that's a
&gt;     personal issue).
not my choice (obviously)

&gt; 2)  You're running Sendmail 8.9.3, but using an 8.8.7 configuration
&gt;     file; it'd be wise to update.
i hadnt noticed that; will do.

&gt; Apart from that, your problem lies elsewhere if you get to LinuxSA OK.
and all my other mailing lists, but still some are getting dropped.

and sending via smtp directly to mail.bigpond.com works. so go figure.
(maybe mutt is screwing up?? i'd doubt it though, its been upgraded since
the problem started.)

&gt; &gt; From mibus  Mon Jul 10 15:27:47 2000
&gt; &gt; Return-Path: &lt;mibus&gt;
&gt; &gt; Received: (from <A HREF="mailto:mibus@localhost">mibus@localhost</A>)
&gt; &gt;         by mibus.bigpond.com (8.9.3/8.8.7) id PAA0654
&gt; &gt; perhaps it checks to see if 'mibus.bigpond.com' exists, as it doesnt really.
&gt; 
&gt; Not in a Received header; maybe if it had appeared elsewhere (like in
&gt; the envelope).
envelope??
