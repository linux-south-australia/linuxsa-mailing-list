Good points..

The debate is such a tricky one, but one that should be vigorously debated 
none-the-less.

Firstly, perhaps someone in the audience can enlighten us as to how the GPL 
will enforce the 'spirit' of Linux and open-source?

Ian

&gt;Ian:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have no concern with commercial software for Linux.
&gt;
&gt;I guess the concern is that the commercial ventures might be able to
&gt;convince everyone that they own Linux. In the tarot cards, the 15th card
&gt;is The Devil. The Devil has no real power over you except that you
&gt;believe him. In the same way, Linux could become open-source but closed
&gt;at the same time. People only have to believe that
&gt;Corel/RedHat/Suse/[version x] is the only Linux for Linux to become
&gt;closed in effect.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I have found that commercial Linux vendors (mostly) offer a
&gt; &gt; superior service for a cheaper price than under the Windows platform.
&gt;
&gt;Only because Linux users won't pay higher. When they do, they will both
&gt;be equal. Commercial vendors set their price by commercial means. If you
&gt;work in business and you don't set your price in this manner then you go
&gt;out of business.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I suspect that Applixware, WP and others are top of the range packages
&gt; &gt; (although I have not used them) and we should encourage support for
&gt; &gt; commercial ventures in Linux.
&gt;
&gt;I've never used ApplixWare but I've been told it's good. Word Perfect
&gt;seems to be better than Word, though I use StarOffice if I need a
&gt;WYSIWYG office application. As most would know I'm one of these arcane
&gt;people who prefer to use a "meaning based" (wysiwym) markup style
&gt;language.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; On the open source side, I have heard that there is a fantastic OS word
&gt; &gt; processor (the name escapes me but is on the tip of my tongue) that will 
&gt;be
&gt; &gt; improved over time and perhaps even rival the commercial offerings.
&gt;
&gt;Are you talking about Abi Word? It's part of the GNOME office suite. In
&gt;addition there's rumour about that FrameMaker is going to be released
&gt;commercially for Linux...
