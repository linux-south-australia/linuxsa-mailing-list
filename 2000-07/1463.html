 audio cds work for me, but I have only burnt them under windows. I use a
Sony CDR/CDRW (24*4*2) drive, and normal CDR discs (obviously CDRW discs
won't work)... Haven't managed to get the drive to work under linux yet
(haven't really tried)... Also, it depends how you are creating the discs.
If you are simply backing up an existing CD, it should be easy. if you are
creating a CD from WAV or RAW files, it will be more fun... Also, I don't
know what issues you may come across if you are creating a CD from multiple
tracks on existing CDs... Adaptec easy-CD creator works ine for me, but
that's a windows program...

Subject: Burning audio CDs

Howdy All,

This *may* not be a Linux problem, but I thought 
I'd ask anyway as I'm not sure what's at fault yet.

Bought myself an Acer 32x8x4 CD-RW drive with 8Mb
buffer last week, which burns data CDs just fine
(both CD-R and CD-RW). I'm using mkisofs and 
cdrecord on a Mandrake 7.1 system for burning.

Now I'm trying to create some audio CDs, but this
is where I'm hitting problems. I can play them 
back on the CD-RW drive itself using xplaycd and
other Linux CD players, but they won't play in 
normal CD players. Normal CD players don't find 
any tracks at all on the CDs.

I've followed all the how-tos, faq's, etc..., but
to no avail. My questions are:
- do I need the special audio CD-R's that people
like TDK sell?
- is it because it's a rewritable drive? (I have
tried both CD-R and CD-RW disks though)
- is there a better tool than cdrecord for audio
CDs?
- has anyone burnt audio CDs on a CD-RW drive that
work in normal players? If so, what hardware,
commands, etc... are you using?

Thanks people,

Dean
