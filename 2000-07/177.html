Beatles songs for the computer age.

Eleanor Rigby
Sits at the keyboard
And waits for a line on the screen
Lives in a dream

Waits for a signal
Finding some code that will make the machine do some more
What is it for?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Guru MacKenzie
Typing the lines of a program that no one will run;
Isn't it fun?

Look at him working,
Munching some chips as he waits for the code to compile;
Where is the style?

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?

Eleanor Rigby
Crashes the system and loses 6 hours of work;
What is it worth?

Guru Mackenzie
Wiping the blood off his hands as he walks from the grave;
Nothing was saved.

All the lonely users, where do they all come from?
All the lonely users, why does it take so long?


--------------------------------------------------------

He's real LINUX Man
Sitting in his LINUX Lan
Making all his LINUX plans
For nobody

He's as wise as he can be
Programs in bash, yacc and C
LINUX Man, can you help me
At all?

LINUX Man, please listen
My printout is missin'
LINUX Man
The wo-o-o-orld is your 'at' command

--------------------------------------------------------

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom;
"Write in C."

As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somwhere, someone whispers;
"Write in C".

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO's dead and buried,
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics!
Write in C.

If you've just spend nearly 30 hours
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Only wimps use BASIC,
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won't quite cut it.
Write in C.

Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Don't even mention COBOL.
Write in C.

Robyn
