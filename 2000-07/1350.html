Hi,

&gt; Ummm, since you mention DECstations, you need to check whether or not they
&gt; are MIPS boxen or Alpha boxen.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, I am familiar with much of the DEC gear that went into the Uni
&gt; :-), and I think that almost all of it had TurboChannel, rather than PCI.
&gt; 
&gt; I do not think that there is any support for TurboChannel under Linux,
&gt; although NetBSD supports it for DECstations, so you might be able to port
&gt; the code.
&gt; 
&gt; This is, however, a serious undertaking, and it is definitely going to be
&gt; cheaper to get an old 200MHz pentium or whatever. Faster too, both from the
&gt; POV of time, and the speed of programs you will eventually run.

If they were bought from Engineering at Adelaide Uni, then they are DEC
Station 5000s (MIPS). 16 or 24 MB of RAM (I actually had a couple I was
intending to set up at instal fest, but never got to).

One problem with Ultrix is its not Y2K compliant.

SGIs doing the Linux port to MIPS, but its not really at production stage
yet. NetBSD is your best bet.
