&gt; What desktop for RH6.2 would be considered the best for both

&gt; The Helix GNOME desktop looks good, can this be purchased

&gt; I have registered to come to the InstallFest this month if anyone
&gt; can help.

This is a religious question.  What I mean is that this is an issue people feel
very strongly about and it is also very much an issue of personal taste.

Generally speaking there are three camps - GNOME, KDE and 'everything else
consisting of just a window manager instead of a whole "desktop environment"
(whatever that really means).'

Personally I really like Helix GNOME.  Others like other stuff, and for them
something else is really cool.  Diversity is a good thing.

I'm sure at the installfest there will be many different options on show, so
when you come along, have a look and a play and decide for yourself.

Michael...

P.S. Helix can be purchased on CD.  I don't know of any local resellers, but it
can simply be downloaded as well.
