&gt;&gt; Anybody else notice that this comparison is skewed by the fact that the

&gt;&gt; Surely this would effect the latency...
&gt;
&gt; It has an even greater effect on throughput because the speed of disk
&gt; transfer is proportional to rpm.  Why?  You can't transfer a track in
&gt; less time than it takes the track to pass under the read/write head.
&gt; A drive spinning at 10000rpm is approximately 40% faster than one
&gt; spinning at 7200rpm.

Sure.  It also depends on the part of the disk you're transferring to,
and the data density on the disk.  This is why all large modern disks,
whether SCSI or ATA, have much higher sequential transfer rates than
they did a few years back.

As I mentioned earlier, the real issue is latency, not sequential
transfer rate.  David is right in saying that a faster disk will have
lower overall latency.  Latency comes in two flavours: positioning
(getting the head to the right track) and rotational latency.  It's
difficult to find out about positioning latency, because it depends on
the individual drive, and the manufacturers don't release information.
Rotational latency is easier: on average it's half a rotation, so at
7,200 rpm it's 4.17 ms, at 10,000 rpm it's 3 ms, a saving of 1 ms in a
total of about 8 (which implies a positioning time of about 4 ms).
That's certainly worth having, but it's not as significant as you
might expect.

&gt; Just to be quite accurate, modern drives have large on-board caches,
&gt; which permit them to return from a write immediately.  Read
&gt; operations don't benefit quite so much unless you read in the order
&gt; that the drive electronics predicted (assuming the drive does read
&gt; ahead, which is likely.)

In general, it's recommended to turn off write caching on servers.  It
doesn't make much difference under heavy loads and random access
anyway.
