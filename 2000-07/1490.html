Hi,

I have observed so many people having problems with device drivers under
Linux, and with misconceptions about devices and drivers, so I though I
would write something on the subject.

Kernels installed by RedHat 6.x, Mandrake 7.x and TurboLinux 6.x and I am
sure many others are fully modular.

All the drivers are supplied as loadable modules. This gives you a great
deal of flexibility, and it is worthwhile being aware of this.

I have a SCSI CD burner, which I normally keep off. If I power up my CD
burning machine before I switch the burner on, I do not have to reboot!

I simply unlaod the driver, and reload it:

   rmmod eata_dma
   modprobe eata_dma

When the driver is loaded, it scans the bus and finds my burner, and all is
well. Of course, if you have disks on the bus that are mounted, then you
will not be able to undload the driver until you have umounted all the
disks, but that is only reasonable.

The same is true of SCSI scanners.

You can also do the same with Ethernet drivers, and many other drivers.

Perhaps the ultimate power is when you are working on the source for
modules, like say, the drbd module. You make your changes, recompile, load
the driver, and test. If more changes are needed, unload the driver,
change, recompile and reload.
