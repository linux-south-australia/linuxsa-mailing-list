&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; It would appear that someone has been poking around one of my machines.  I
&gt; know this because my postmaster address received a bounce message from
&gt; someone I don't know, which was relayed though my machine.  The disturbing
&gt; thing about the content of the email was that it seemed to be a reply to a
&gt; previous message telling this person about something that was meant to be on
&gt; my machine (not sure what it was, but the sender indicated that they were
&gt; having trouble getting their browser to see it (the machine doesn't' run a
&gt; httpd at all so I'm not surprised)).
&gt; 
&gt; Having had a close look at /var/log/messages it would seem that I'm the only
&gt; person who's logged into this machine recently (and all such logins came
&gt; from one of my other machines, at times when I was most likely to be using
&gt; those machines.  i.e.. I can account for all the logins to my account as
&gt; being me).  All root logins were immediately preceded by a login by my user,
&gt; so they were likely to be me su'ing to root.  I've checked /etc/passwd and
&gt; there are no unusual user accounts on the machine.  So it would appear that
&gt; whoever is using the box hasn't been able to telnet into it at all.
&gt; /var/log/secure doesn't show any unusual connections either.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any other log files I should check?  Are there any good Linux
&gt; security references/sites that I should refer to to try and increase
&gt; security on the machine?
&gt; 

Check the RPM man page for the command used to find files that have
changed. There aren't too many binary files that should have been
changed...

Also check for extra accounts in /etc/passwd

Which version of sendmail are you using?

Send the relevant logs and we'll see what the problem is.
