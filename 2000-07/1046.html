Just to fill in a gap here...
The reason that the 3Gb drive couldnt be seen in Windows is because you only
created at extended partition.
In the extended partition you must then also create logical partitions which
you then see in windows as a drive which you can then format.

MWP

&gt; Hi Ben,
&gt; The disk can only be seen by DOS/Windows after it has been formatted
&gt; eg: format d: /u
&gt;
&gt; What you appear to need to do is:
&gt; 1) create a primary partition of 1.5GB on the second Hard Disk
&gt; 2) reboot and then format that partition in DOS -&gt;  format d: /u
&gt; 3) reboot and begin the installation of linux and select the unallocated
&gt; space on the second drive as the place to put Linux.  The installation
&gt; will create the partitions as needed and then format it as an ext2 file
&gt; system for you.
&gt;
&gt; *NOTE*  Don't forget to create a swap partition for Linux.  It will
&gt; almost certainly ask you to do this anyway, but you need to leave space
&gt; for it.  If you don't intend doing a whole lot of work on the Linux side
&gt; ie. only for exploring and learning purposes, then you can usually do
&gt; with just a 64MB swap, but maybe more if you don't have much physical
&gt; RAM (&lt; 32MB).
&gt;
&gt; regards,
&gt; Don

&gt; &gt; Hello to whom this is addressed to,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was recently at your Linux Expo in the City and I thought it was very
&gt; &gt; good. I am currently experiencing difficulties with installing Red Hat
Linux
&gt; &gt; 6.1 and understanding the "partitioning" process, especially. Note: I
loss
&gt; &gt; everything on my hard disks when trying to Install Linux for the first
time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will list my situation at the present time...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)      I have a Computer with "2 hard disks" installed on it.
&gt; &gt; 2)      The 1st hard disk is 1.2GB with Windows 98 currently operating
fine on
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; 3) However, the 2nd hard disk is 3GB and yet to be running anywhere
(i.e.
&gt; &gt; not displaying in Windows) and it is empty. I have been trying to use
FDISK
&gt; &gt; under DOS to try to get it to all work in Windows, yet it isn't working.
I
&gt; &gt; have created an "extended partition", yet I can not seem to format it
when I
&gt; &gt; go back to DOS after the resetting process because it displays that I
only
&gt; &gt; have a Floppy Disk and a Hard Disk C: (Windows on it).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If possible I would like my computer to be like this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1)      Keep the 1st Hard Disk the way it is with Windows and just leave
it
&gt; &gt; alone.
&gt; &gt; 2) The 2nd Hard Disk with 1.5GB with additional space for Windows files
and
&gt; &gt; the other 1.5GB of space for Linux. Please could you explain what I
should
&gt; &gt; do when I reach the Partition option in the installation process when
the
&gt; &gt; Add, Edit, Delete, Reset buttons are displayed and so on and with the
two
&gt; &gt; Windows found in the screen with Partition and Drive Summary. And as for
the
&gt; &gt; rest of the Linux installation process I should be fine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "IMPORTANT"
&gt; &gt; If I still have difficulties (i.e. loss all my data again) could you
please
&gt; &gt; explain what I should do to get both my hard disks to run Windows 98
with
&gt; &gt; the partitioning process and the formatting process if I lose everything
&gt; &gt; because somebody helped me at the Expo last time, but I didn't get
&gt; &gt; everything.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Please could you "list" everything in preferably point form for both
getting
&gt; &gt; Linux AND Windows running. Could you also explain the terms, primary
&gt; &gt; partition, extended partition, logical partitions and active partitions
as
&gt; &gt; well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the help,
&gt; &gt; Bennie.
