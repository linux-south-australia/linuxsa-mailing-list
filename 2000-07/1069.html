IMHO, I think that the way to simulate pipes and so on with a GUI is to have
each program as a building block, and you manipulate physical pipes between
them. You would have a blank screen, with a bunch of toolbars which would
represent the tools. Some would merely be filters, some would create data,
and some would merge or split data streams. Of course, for something like
grep, the power in it is in the regexp mini-language, so you want to keep
that... The point of such a GUI would be to make complex shell constructs
easier. I can draw this better than I can explain it... :)

NEW CONTEST
-----------

AIM:
Replace command line with GUI

PURPOSE:
Similar to the C Obfuscation contest - NONE but it's fun

OBJECTIVE:
The supervisors will set a suitable command line tool to represent with
a GUI.

RULES:

1) Said GUI must:
  - exhibit standard GUI characteristics
  [note this would have to be elaborated; such things as you can't make
a window 4192 pixels wide simply because that's the length you'd need to
fit in all the options]
  - behave exactly (read exactly) as the man page for that command
  - as FEW at keyboard strokes as possible; i.e. everything that could
be point and click MUST be point and click

PRIZE:
A stylised LinuxSA Tux

Now, given that I've invented this contest, who would like to implement
the grep command? Base the grep on egrep as distributed with RedHat
Linux 6.2. I would point out that the search field for "grep" doesn't
appear to have any sensible limit, hence the GUI must be able to cope
with a search field consisting of at least 127 tokens but probably
should be able to cope with more.

AND the GUI must be able to be understood by any literate computer
user...and it must accept input from stdin (because that's what the man
page says). If you can sensibly create a GUI allegory for STDIN I will
waive this particular requirement...
