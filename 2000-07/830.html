Hi.

Recently, I have been involved in a cross-platform cdrom project, that has
raised the mac compatibility issue. I have always thought that the mac
supported iso9660 well, but I have found that when you throw a lot of
files on an iso cd, almost _any_ system reads it better than the mac. This
is without breaking the iso directory level restrictions. 

In the light of this experience, I would suggest that the cd be written in
iso format, and the macs be loaded with a very effective extension that I
found called "JolietVolumeAccess", which improves upon the standard Apple
iso capabilities, and also allows access to the evil empire's Joliet cd
extensions. Apple's techinfo site reckons that Apple will never support
Joliet, which peeves me greatly, seeing that their own iso support is so
lousy. Anyone who has waited ages for an iso cd to mount on their mac, or
experienced the "recursive cd root directory from hell" knows exactly what
I mean...

I realise this information does not directly help you with the cd you are
trying to read today, but it just may help you in the future. My opinion
is that a cd should be burnt in as open a format as possible so that the
files are recoverable/readable by whatever system is at hand (eg, your
linux box or whatever - probably there would be a windows box around as
well)

JolietVolumeAccess should be readily available on the web, let me know if
you canna find it, I will send you the url...

If JolietVolumeAccess helps you, please send an email to Thomas 
Tempelmann &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joliet@tempel.org">joliet@tempel.org</A>&gt;, he's the all-round good guy that wrote it.

&gt; Regarding the multi session hfs disk that I am trying to mount, it appears that the
&gt; cdfs module doesn't read the disk as expected.  On checking the disk on the work
&gt; Mackintosh I found that what looked like three sessions was in fact only two and that
&gt; the size of them was no where near reality.
&gt; It showed up as :
&gt; 
&gt; apple.hfs
&gt; data-1.unknown
&gt; data-2.unknown
&gt; 
&gt; all at about 30 to 50 MB each.  apple.hfs was the first session but both the data where
&gt; actually only one session and about 3 MB each.  Has anyone had any further experience?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
