&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;This is a little off topic, but I am interested in knowing the general pro's
&gt;and con's of frame relay compared to Ethernet (AAPT/Connect, serial) (well a
&gt;128k feed from AAPT derived from, I think 2MB).
&gt;
&gt;I have worked in many frame relay networks and have found the throughput to
&gt;be very unstable.
&gt;i.e. Other customers with the same service can reduce the bandwidth of my
&gt;service.

Well, of course, because the switches and the trunks between sites are
shared. However, Telstra and Optus claim that they have large amounts of
spare capacity so that you should experience negligible interaction between
users.

&gt;I assume this could be the case with Ethernet (serial) connections.

You have to find out what they are using to transport your packets from
your source to your destination.  While it may look like Ethernet to you,
the transport of packets from you to the (possibly central) switch is most
likely some sort of point to point link.

&gt;I like the increase flexibility that seems to be available with the Ethernet
&gt;(serial) system but I would like to find out how others feel about it.

Well, they may simply supply you with a FRAD.

You say that the max bandwidth is 2Mb/s, which is the max for Frame. Do you
have a wireless link or cable? If cable, they may simply have supplied you
with Frame and a FRAD.

The link to the switch will be dedicated, but every thing from there is
shared. Just like the internet. 

&gt;Any thoughts?
&gt;
&gt;Derek
