&gt; Netscape blocks on resolver queries. I've finally managed to pin
&gt; point where it hangs. If Netscape is using any reolver function, it
&gt; won't paint to the screen AT ALL. Depending on the speed of the DNS
&gt; servers you're making a query to/with, this can be quite a long
&gt; time.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, it hangs the Java Virtual Machine which apparently
&gt; throws the towel down and crashes Netscape in the process. 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyone more exact about this observation?
&gt; 
&gt; It's been irritating me for quite a while. Whilst I've only taken a
&gt; precursory glance at the resolver libraries, I'm sure a
&gt; multi-threaded web browser should be able to:
&gt; 
&gt; * resolve DNS
&gt; * accept input from the user (eg the user realises that
&gt; "www.linuxzsa.org.au" is wrong)
&gt; * paint the screen at the same time

Wow. I just tried this and your absolutely correct. How utterly
annoying. I've never noticed that before.

I should point out that I always use a proxy server and for this
reason alone I would suggest that everyone does. Squid comes with most
good distros, and is set up by default to allow connections from
localhost on port 3128. You can point your proxies in netscape to
127.0.0.1:3128.

If your ISP requires that you use a proxy as well you'll need to
modify your cache_peer lines in /etc/squid/squid.conf to look like
this...

	cache_peer proxy.isp.net.au parent 8080 0 no-query default

...where 'proxy.isp.net.au' is your isp's proxy and '8080' is the port
your isp's proxy listens to. You'll also need to add the line...

	never_direct allow all

...to tell your cache not to fetch objects itself. If you want to
bypass this for your local web server(s), you'll need an access-list
describing them...

	acl local-server dst 203.16.231.111/255.255.255.255

or

	acl local-server dstdomain www.example.com

...for example. Then you need to allow these to be fetched...

	always_direct allow local-server

All this is on the web site in the FAQ (which may be in your distro's
squid package).

Proxy caches are generally "a good thing"(tm). Most peoples reluctance
to use proxies are usually based on shitty ISPs. Good ISPs in
Australia will always use proxies. The really good ones do this
transparently to to the user with caching engines.

&gt; I'm not convinced that resolver queries HAVE to be blocking.

I'm not convinced that Netscape is the best coded app on the block!

Cheers

Alex!
