Don't know about Nero but the 'Table of Contents' error you mention started
happening here late last year.
We have 7 different burners here for log archiving purposes. While we run a
variety of OS, hardware, software and interfaces, the only ones that gave us
trouble was (almost simultaneously) any burner we had running a combination
of NT4 and Easy CD Creator. (We still have a this software on a Win 98 box
that gets used daily and doesn't give trouble.)
Please rename it Easy Coaster Creator if you intend to use it on NT. I've
tried all the updates from Adaptec and all the circus packs from MS but no
joy.
The NT fix seems to be changing the software for something like Cequadrat's
WinOnCD. It just refuses to give any trouble on NT using either IDE, SCSI or
parallel port burners or....................
 
&lt;And now the Linux bit&gt; 
The best news is that the very first burner we got is the only one that has
never made a coaster in over 2 years.  :)  
It runs cdrecord on RH 5.0 on an old 486 DX4-100 through a basic Adaptec
1505 ISA scsi card to a Teac 50 series burner. Hardly an impressive set of
specs as it started life as a temporary logging solution put together from
the junk box but it just doesn't give any trouble so it was never upgraded.
Maybe the OS has something to do with that. Need I say more?

Subject: SCSI card and CDR problems


Hi,

This is not strictly a Linux problem - but a problem non the less...


I'm using the latest Nero 5 demo, and and having problems burning.  I
recently purchased a Sony CRX5SBK 10x SCSI internal drive, connected to an
Adaptec 1510c host apater.  The ID on the burner is 5, yet it is reported
in windows NT  as 2:5

When bruning, even in simulation with Nero and Easy CD Creater 4.02S
(bundled with the drive) at 98% writing the table of contents the process
fails.

Nero reports and invalid write state and fails.  Adaptec reports that there
was a buffer under run and then the flush command failed.  This occurs at
10x, 8x, 2x so this is not a data flow error as had a Sony 4x previosuly,
that had no problems.

This is driving me insane!! Please can you help?

James
