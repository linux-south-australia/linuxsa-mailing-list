&gt; &gt; &gt; So where can you get XEmacs, I haven't found a copy on my RH (through
&gt; &gt; &gt; APC)  distro .
&gt; 
&gt; I think I got it from rpmfind.net, which is *excellent*...

RedHat Powertools has XEmacs.  Uninstall Emacs first.

&gt; &gt; XEmacs is pretty much the same as emacs. If anyone knows of any _real_
&gt; &gt; differences, please tell me, because I have been wondering for a while...
&gt; 
&gt; Not much, I slightly prefer the XEmacs ui, but it isn't anything very
&gt; important. I'm waiting for a nice stable-ish version of GTK-emacs
&gt; ( at <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/gui-xemacs/">http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/gui-xemacs/</A> ).

The story needs to be told, as it set people's impressions about
free software for a long time, and that impression was of
duelling personalities, late and buggy software, and perhaps
worse...

Once apon a time Emacs had horrible X support.  Lucid needed an
editor for their Lisp programming environment and put a lot of
work into accelerating Emacs' X support.  Lemacs was a version of
Emacs with X, font and icon support and was due to be rolled back
into Emacs.

Stallman, the Emacs author, redesigned the Lucid software as he
slowly integrated it.  Lucid changed corporate direction, into
a development environment for C++.  It decided to use the GNU C
compiler, also being developed by Stallman.

As Emacs/X and GCC slipped relationships between Stallman and Lucid
soured.  The split between Emacs and Lemacs became formalised.

Lucid had marketing trouble and software quality problems.  It
failed to recognise the importance of MS Windows.  It went under.

Sun eventually bought Lucid, renamed an enhanced Lemacs into XEmacs
and ditched the buggy GCC for their own excellent Pro C.  XEmacs
remained free, but with hooks into Sun's development environment.

The XEmacs crew eventually gave up on integrating Emacs and XEmacs.
The GNU crew later put a lot of effort into bringing XEmacs features into
Emacs.

A company called Cygnus started to maintain free software.  It's work
is mainly responsible for GCC's current stability.  Unfortunately,
GCC also split into GCC and ECGS, as Cygnus realised it could not
get enhancements past the rather conservative GCC maintainer.

This was resolved last year, effectively when Stallman moved GCC's
maintenance responsibility to Cygnus.  The timing was very fortuitous,
as support of the new Intel 64-bit chip would require a huge number
of changes to GCC.  A lot of these changes had been in the maintainer's
queue dating from the introduction of the DEC's 64-bit Alpha.

Many of the Lucid developers went to work for Netscape.  Given their
history Mozilla was never going to be released under a GNU license.

Eric Raymond, whatever you think of his politics, has done a lot of
bring the free and commercial groups back to cooperating.

With this history, it can been seen that the purchase of lead programming
expertise by Linux distributors is more than altruism -- it prevents
to a degree the problems suffered by Lucid.  Companies no longer have
to wait for a vacation from someone's "real work" to get changes into
mission critical products.
