&gt; With respect, that's only half of the functionality.  The other half, being

I am not sure what you mean by run in parralell in this context.


&gt; &gt; After all your set of commands are finite, the possible legal sequences
&gt; &gt; you put them together in is large but also finite.
&gt; 
&gt; No it is not.  It is infinite.  Some commands might not yet have been
&gt; created, but there is no limit to them.  Even if we say that the number of
&gt; commands is finite, it's still a very large number.  There are a maximum of
&gt; 16,000 different 8 by 8 pixel icons if you only 256 different colours, and
&gt; most of those look too similar to others to be useful.  Worse, 16,000
&gt; obviously different icons would be very hard to use.  How do you sort
&gt; through them to find the one you want?
&gt; 

Here you are ignoring the ability to add words to icns, which on many
systems is paractise, or for the icons themselves to be words - or
pictures of words..

Co you cna have as many icaons ass you can have words.
