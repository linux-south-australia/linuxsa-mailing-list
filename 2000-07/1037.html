Hello to whom this is addressed to,

I was recently at your Linux Expo in the City and I thought it was very 
good. I am currently experiencing difficulties with installing Red Hat Linux 
6.1 and understanding the “partitioning” process, especially. Note: I loss 
everything on my hard disks when trying to Install Linux for the first time.

I will list my situation at the present time...

1)	I have a Computer with “2 hard disks” installed on it.
2)	The 1st hard disk is 1.2GB with Windows 98 currently operating fine on 
it.
3) However, the 2nd hard disk is 3GB and yet to be running anywhere (i.e. 
not displaying in Windows) and it is empty. I have been trying to use FDISK 
under DOS to try to get it to all work in Windows, yet it isn't working. I 
have created an “extended partition”, yet I can not seem to format it when I 
go back to DOS after the resetting process because it displays that I only 
have a Floppy Disk and a Hard Disk C: (Windows on it).

If possible I would like my computer to be like this…

1)	Keep the 1st Hard Disk the way it is with Windows and just leave it 
alone.
2) The 2nd Hard Disk with 1.5GB with additional space for Windows files and 
the other 1.5GB of space for Linux. Please could you explain what I should 
do when I reach the Partition option in the installation process when the 
Add, Edit, Delete, Reset buttons are displayed and so on and with the two 
Windows found in the screen with Partition and Drive Summary. And as for the 
rest of the Linux installation process I should be fine.


“IMPORTANT”
If I still have difficulties (i.e. loss all my data again) could you please 
explain what I should do to get both my hard disks to run Windows 98 with 
the partitioning process and the formatting process if I lose everything 
because somebody helped me at the Expo last time, but I didn't get 
everything.

Please could you “list” everything in preferably point form for both getting 
Linux AND Windows running. Could you also explain the terms, primary 
partition, extended partition, logical partitions and active partitions as 
well.

Thanks for the help,
Bennie.

(Could you try to keep everything
