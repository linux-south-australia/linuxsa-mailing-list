Richard Sharpe and NS Computer Software Services P/L

In what may be a world-first, Richard Sharpe and NS Computer Software &
Services P/L (NS) has gained two contracts on open source software.

NS now has contracts to work on Ethereal, the popular GTK+-based packet
capture and decode package.  These contracts include:

  - Writing both a user's guide and a developers guide for Ethereal. 
    This will provide high-quality documentation for Ethereal.

  - Writing an Ethereal dissector and a tcpdump decoder for the new
    BXXP protocol. This conract was obtained via SourceXchange, the
    marketplace for opensource development.

NS Computer will seek to further develop its role an capability as a player
in the open source software world.  These developments complement its
already strong position as a supplier in the rapidly expanding arena of
Open Source Software, with a Samba course and a Linux course having been
developed and being actively presented.

ABOUT ETHEREAL

Ethereal is the popular open source GUI-based packet capture and decode
program. It was initially developed by Gerald Combs, and since its release
it has gone on to attract such a large number of contributions that it now
handles more protocols than any other packet capture program. It is also
having protocol modules for draft RFCs being developed.

ABOUT NS COMPUTER SOFTWARE & SERVICES P/L

NS is a computer software and services company that employs Richard Sharpe.
It offers software development and system design and management services
world-wide.  NS is based in Adelaide.

ABOUT RICHARD SHARPE

Richard has been involved in the open-source arena for many years, having
first contributed software in 1985/6 when he made changes to sendmail to
make it easier to check config file changes, and when he contributed back
fixes to the now-defunct CMU TCP/IP software for VMS.

Richard was a contributor to the book SAMS Teach Yourself Samba in 24
Hours, and was the main author of Special Edition, Using Samba.  He is also
a member of the Samba team and the Ethereal team.  Richard has written and
presents a Linux course and a Samba course around Australia.
