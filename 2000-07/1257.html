Damian!

&gt; I went to the installfest and got redhat 6.2 up
&gt; and running ok, but my installer deleted my
&gt; windows partition in the process. I'm quite happy

If your windows partition was DELETED Windows or dos won't work at all.

&gt; if there was anyway to boot to windows. Lilo only
&gt; give slinux and dos and dos won't start windows.

Does it start anything? You may have a minor glitch getting your Windows
to start (despite that fact that it's actually there)...

&gt; Could anyone give me some advice on how to get
&gt; windows running again without losing linux?

Yes.

Either try installing Windows onto an existing VFAT partition, or
better, bring it to next month's meeting. If you're VERY near Croydon
(i.e. 20 minutes walking distance) I would be willing to help you
provided:

* you don't blame me if your computer decides it needs an upgrade
* you give me a cup of tea, and copious amounts of
poison...OOPS...Adelaide water
