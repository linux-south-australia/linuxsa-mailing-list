Richard et al:


&gt; 0: meta-FAQ's

WHAT is a meta FAQ? A FAQ about a FAQ?

&gt; 0.1: Who maintains this FAQ?

The Mother of Christ :-P

&gt; 0.3: Is there a copy on the Web?

Ummm....if it's ON the web isn't this redundant?

&gt; 1: LinuxSA

&gt; 1.5: What's an appropriate post?

That is debate or even flame war material.

&gt; 1.6: What about religious wars?

The most renown Christian/Islam wars happened in the time of the Knights
Templar (I apologise to the Islamic people on the list, I state this
from the Christian hordes' point of view). Personally I think this could
be dropped or glossed over.

&gt; 1.7: And flame wars?

ROFL - LinuxSA doesn't have them.

&gt; 1.8: How do I reliably filter LinuxSA mail?

By getting a new employer (Mr Garner's solution), by filtering on the
X-Loop [??] (other people's solution except those using broken, shoddy
email clients against their own will), pestering Geoffrey Bennett to add
something to the beginning of the subject line (someone whose name
starts with D and it wasn't me's solution)...

&gt; 1.9: Is the list down?

Is the list up?

&gt; 1.F Where are my socks?

On your head?

&gt; 2.5: Can someone install it for me?

Honestly, except perhaps for THIS question, the others have already been
answered at <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</A> or <A HREF="http://linux.senet.com.au/">http://linux.senet.com.au/</A> or
even by sending them to <A HREF="http://www.linux.org/">http://www.linux.org/</A> - should we rewrite the
Linux Documentation Project?

&gt; 3.1.2: How do I keep Windows?

Umm, don't live in a cyclone area and don't chuck stones through them?

&gt; 3.1.3: What distribution is best? (see also religious wars)

VM 6.2 (hehehe....)

&gt; 3.1.5: How do I configure my XYZ hardware to work under Linux?

Install Sesame Street for Linux and get it to sing the alphabet.

&gt; 3.3: Kernel
&gt; 3.3.0: As in Saunders?
&gt; 3.3.1: Compiling a Kernel.
&gt; 3.3.2: Modules.

That isn't really adequately provided for in the Kernel HOWTO (the
kernel HOWTO is good but it's a little verbose and not really a FAQ)

&gt; Hmmm..... yes, I'm too verbose... tell me hwat you think anyway

I htink (the corollary to hwat) that this is a reasonable idea. Mind
you, seeing that you've actually suggested it, you may end up having to
write the whole thing yourself. If you wanted, I could DocBook the text
for you...
