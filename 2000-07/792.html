&gt; If I can design an easy to use dialog box for my end customer, I imagine he
&gt; would be far more impressed than explaining to him my knowledge of how
&gt; to grep a file and pipe the answer. Command line -switches have no place in the
&gt; end use of a product, just as coding in C is not useable by itself. The fact
&gt; that you can only use command line on some issues does not elevate it into a
&gt; place of honour and glory. Instead, it reflects a primitive mindset on what the
&gt; end game really is.

Yes, a GUI does impress users. It does make some things easier. But
saying that command line switches have no place in an end product really
is quite stupid. You can never have 100% power and 100% easy-to-use-GUI.
If you make the GUI easier to use (by getting rid of command line
options, for example), you lose a great deal of power. By implementing
these same options in the GUI, you end up cluttering the desktop and
confusing the user.

This really shouldn't have anything to do with the size of people's
dicks (which I am assuming is what is meant by the hairy chest comment).

Always use the right tool for the right job. Sure it's nice to use a
high level language like Java for an application, but when you require a
fast, sweet application you should use C.

An end user doesn't necessarily care about your use of grep (which is
fair enough), but it doesn't mean that grep should not be used. Use the
right tool for the right job.

It's like using perl to write an office suite. It's not the best way of
doing it.

Or using MySQL over PostgreSQL for databases that require many
simultaneous writes. It's not the best way of doing things.

Matt

P.S. Use the right tool for the right job
