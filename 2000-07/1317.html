Yes.  NFS is another biggie:  If you initiate an NFS IO on a filesystem
which comes from a server which is currently down, and the filesystem 
hasn't been mounted with the "intr" flag, you won't be able to kill the
process until the fileserver comes back up.

That being said, it's considered a bad thing to use the intr flag, because
doing so introduces an inconsistency between the behaviour of files on
NFS filesystems and the behaviour of files on local filesystems.  On a 
local filesystem, read() and write() calls are always atomic:  they either
100% succeed or 100% fail.  If you introduce the intr flag to an NFS
mount, you create the possibility of interrupting read()s and write()s 
after the data has been sent to the server, but before the server has
acknowledged that the operation has been carried out, i.e.: you leave the
IO in an indeterminate state where nobody is quite sure about whether or
not it has been committed to the server's disk.

Uncertainty is a bad thing, in many subtle and intriguing ways :-)
