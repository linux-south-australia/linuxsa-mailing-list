&gt; I believe the spirit of Linux displays the following properties:
&gt;
&gt; * a belief in a good, stable operating system

A belief in, yes, but it's not the holy grail. I can destabilise my Linux
systems without any outside help. I frequently crash them due to my own
stupidity. Stability is in the eye of the beholder. I believe in the
inherent stability of Linux. I dont believe it is stable any more than the
tooth fairy. You cannot have ever evolving upgrades and genuine improvements
to the kernel and nearly all accessories, and at the same time claim rock
solid stability. There have been some real doozies. My point? Inferring (if
you do) rock solid stability is a departure from the real world, but I would
certainly agree it is a criteria (and selling point) for Linux.

&gt; * a belief that the command line has a place in the operating system

Possibly. But Gui will rule. Command line savvy is no longer a badge of
hairy chestedness. In your face dialog boxes with all options clearly
presented is the way it is, underlying scripts is another thing and fine,
but command line is a nostalgic throwback to horse and carriage days. we are
in the 21st century. I use (and prefer) command line, but they are neither
intuitive, nor particlarly productive. In most cases they're a bloody
nuisance. I have better things to do than bashing an awk grepping a yak. The
sooner i forget this lexicon the better off I'll be. That nonsense didn't
impress me in 1972 and it doesn't now.

&gt; * a belief that people can help themselves and change the operating
&gt; system to suit themselves

Oh yes. Bottom line comment there.

&gt; * a belief that the operating system can be purchased absolutely free of
&gt; charge

You get something for nothing, that's absolutely what you get. Paying for
something, and making an OS freely and readily accessible are two different
things. No-one says you can't sell Redhat for $44. No one says you can't pay
someone to work on that 'free' OS, I wouldn't call absolutely free of charge
a criteria here. Cost of ownership is the issue, and, if that's bundled in
the initial price, fine. As the very author of 'Linux philoshophy' says, he
doesn't object to Bill charging for his OS, he objects to it being a bad OS.
Reversing the analogy, Torvalds is stating he doesn't obect to Linux costing
something, it's a good OS. Somehere, someway, someone pays for it. If you're
the Mexican Government you've paid for Linux to be installed, 'for free', in
all of their schools and universities, but, you have paid for it. AT&T paid
for large sections of Linux, Redhat pay for large sections of Linux,
Torvalds gets paid, most handsomely, for large sections of Linux, and the
end user _sometimes_ gets Linux 'free of charge'. But someone somewhere most
assuredly paid for it. This is not one of the Linux criteria. Freely and
readily accessible is.
