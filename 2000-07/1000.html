I have had a brief look at it, in fact I bought it from
everythinglinux.com.au
Looks to be an excellent product.  It's a little bit fiddly to set up, but
once u have the base install of it, its great.
It copies all the cabs off your Windoze cd, configures itself or whatever it
does :-), then u just run the setup for each user.
Similar to Vmware in that you get a full windows install etc, can run
windoze apps, except that the Win4Lin flavour doesn't have its own bios &
hardware like vmware, it shares everything from your Linux setup.
It only supports TCP/IP for networking, but what impressed me the most is
that I dialed up using Linux, started a Win4Lin session & used IE5 to browse
the web from Windows.  It picked up the route to the internet with NO extra
setting up.
It has some drawbacks in comparison to Vmware & also some things which are
better, and it also requires a lot less machine to run it.  Certainly I
would recommend it, its not terribly expensive either, so worth buying to
try out.
