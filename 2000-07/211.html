Thankyou for your speedy and informative response.

&gt; Just out of interest, why is adlax1.optusnet in there twice? I would
&gt; have thought that it would have been in there once. Also, why has it
&gt; appeared as a domain name in the default RATHER than an IP
&gt; address...

I don't know.  I have been lobbying for the boss to let me reload the
software myself on a fresh PC - but he seems to be quite certain that it's
not a software problem because he's already reloaded it several times.


&gt; No. Not at all. Your problem looks like the errors and the frame. If I
&gt; get more than 1 error per 10000 RX Packets I start to look for what is
&gt; going wrong. Also, your "frame" is 199 extra than mine but I'm not
&gt; certain what "frame" refers to (i.e. I'll have to RTFM about it).

Hell, we've got the problem - that's our job :-)

&gt; know that what I've said isn't exactly helpful but these appear
&gt; "different to normal" to me and they might help someone else discover
&gt; your problem.

Knowing that our setup does not appear to be configured in the "normal" way
is extremely helpful.

&gt; Well, you look like you've been using some reasonable console tools to
&gt; fix it.

erm.  "fix it" should = "try to fix it" :-)

&gt; Nonetheless I
&gt; haven't heard that it acts as dismally as you describe.

Nor have I, and nor does it run this way on my setup at home.

&gt; &gt; Also, I've looked around freshmeat.net but I can't find a
&gt; small console ppp
&gt; &gt; data throughput meter.  Does anyone use something like this?

&gt; Did you use to use Optus before? There used to be talk around the town
&gt; that they weren't an entirely "fast" service provider.

We also have Camtech configured on the same box (we were using Camtech to
start with - back when the problems started).  Same deal.

&gt; &gt; ps:  Everything I try to compile comes up with errors like this:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; [<A HREF="mailto:root@mail">root@mail</A> xifmon]# make
&gt;
&gt; &lt;big snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Those problems here appear to be a lack of X development libraries.
&gt; They're probably NOT installed on a default installation.

I figured as much.

[snip, snip]

&gt; hello world:
&gt;
&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
&gt; int main(int argc, char *argv[])
&gt; {
&gt;   printf("Hello world!\n");
&gt;   return 0;
&gt; }

I think that's about the point I got up to when I read "Learning C" :-)

Thanks again,
