&gt;  &gt; Well actually it sounds more like a find file thign to me, not a general
&gt;  &gt; file selection file dialog, fiel selection dialog, even if they allow
&gt;  &gt; wildcards, still typcially only search in a single dir - the *nx find
&gt;  &gt; command is not analogous to a file selct dialog imo it ia analogous ot a
&gt;  &gt; find file command.
&gt;  
&gt; It is precisely analogous to a file select command, because the output
&gt; can be automatically pushed into other commands -- Either by modifying 
&gt; the --exec parameter, or by replacing it with --print and enclosing the
&gt; whole thing in `backticks` or $(command substitution parens).

Well to me it still sound smore liek a find file .
You are selecting a group of iles based on soem common attributes.


&gt; 
&gt; A file find utility just finds files -- In a GUI it means you end up 
&gt; with a screen full of icons.  Yeah, great, terribly useful guys.  The
&gt; expressiveness of the command line is in the fact that that output can
&gt; be put to other uses which are far more flexible and useful than simply
&gt; displaying it on the screen.
&gt; 



Where as with unix find yoou end a up witha list of files. Yeajh great.
But with both you can do stuff tot the fiels.
The how you do stuff differs.
I beleive your orignial post said it was imppossible to do the find all
excel fiel smiodfied int he last 2 days and copy them to  azip disk.



I think I have shown how it could be done on one particluar gui.

&gt;  &gt; Of course you dont have the ability to execute a command with the current
&gt;  &gt; mac(and I dont hink the current windows) fiund file command, but the
&gt;  &gt; mac(and I assuem the windows) find file have the flexibilitu requried to
&gt;  &gt; find the files - from a gui.
&gt;  &gt; So the gui is not incapable of what you wanted to do, the interface for
&gt;  &gt; most of it - the hard bit is there.
&gt;
 
&gt; The problem is that going the extra step, actually taking that output
&gt; out of the window it's displayed in and doing something useful to it, is
&gt; deemed to be "too complicated for the users to understand" by those who
&gt; do GUIs.  And the third party add-on solutions which do come close to 
&gt; doing what we're talking about here by themselves almost universally do
&gt; it by providing some kind of scripting language:  A command line in sheep's
&gt; clothing.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; You could of course applescript the whole thing - and you can write the
&gt;  &gt; applescript in a gui I believe you can even just tell it to record what
&gt;  &gt; you do and it will repeat it back which I am pretty sure you can do in the
&gt;  &gt; above case with enough generality to do what you want(eg bring found items
&gt;  &gt; window forward, select all, copy to blah) - though I have never done so.
&gt; 
&gt; Which really just proves my point.  The original poster was talking about
&gt; completely replacing the command line.  AppleScript is an add-on afterthought
&gt; to the MacOS which provides it with hidden command-line functionality.  The
&gt; fact that quite a bit of AppleScript's functionality (but by no means all 
&gt; of it) can be accomplished by dragging around icons doesn't alter this one
&gt; little bit:  Indeed, it's the bit that AppleScript *doesn't* let you do 
&gt; by dragging around icons which is important.
&gt; 
It may be abn afterthought, bnut I dont htink it is a command line ifn
drag.
It is liek sh and perl a scripting language.
But yoj dont have to edit text to use it.
You can use the applectipty editor to te\record sequences of events.
Ypou double click on script ediotor, click ont he record button type apple
-f ...

you dont need to rvert to a commanf line to use it, you dont need to type
text to tuse it.

when you chhvae finished you r sequence of events you click stop.
it then allows you to save your script.

Look ma no command line.

&gt;  &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe a broad statement like, "There is no place in a user
&gt;  &gt; &gt; program for the CLI," can hold water.  Look at the Mac:  They have no
&gt;  &gt; &gt; CLI at all, and claim the user-friendliness high ground, but Mac advocates
&gt;  &gt; &gt; tactfully fail to mention that there are some things you and I would 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; find tremendously useful and perfectly natural in a CLI environment 
&gt;  &gt; &gt; which are simply impossible to do on a Mac.  
Luckily i didn't say it coudl or couldn't hold water, i just dmeonstrated
that your exampel of soemthign a gui couldn;t do was likely erroneous.



&gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt; But not the above example right?
&gt;  &gt; I assume in this case you are confusing your own lack of familiarity with
&gt;  &gt; a particular UI with a lack of features/power for that that UI?
&gt;  
&gt; No.  I'm countering an blanket statement with a perfectly valid
&gt; counterstatement.
&gt;


Ypou may be now, but in your previous post you gave an exampel, which
appears to be flawed.

You asked how it coudl be done on a gui and i explained that.
 
&gt; At its heart, anyone who would advocate removing the GUI is, when it comes
&gt; right down to it, talking about removing useful functionality.  Why on earth
&gt; would anyone want to do that?
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; I guess this is analogous to a windows or mc user seeing a linux box
&gt;  &gt; without X and assumign that it cant do image editing.
&gt; 
&gt; Please don't make the assumption that I'm unfamiliar with the Mac user
I dont think  iexplcictly said this, thoiugh i ddid quesiton your
familiarity.

&gt; interface.


&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The statement "There is no place in a user program for the CLI," may or
&gt;  &gt; may not be an erroneous or defensible statement, but the examples above 
&gt;  &gt; are not particularaly illustrative of your (I assume) assertion that a GUI
&gt;  &gt; can't do everything as well as a CLI.
&gt; 
&gt; Read what I've written above and tell me where it has fallen down.
&gt; The biggest point you've raised in defence of the MacOS GUI is AppleScript,
&gt; which, as covered above, is just a back-door command line anyway.  How
&gt; does anything you've said work against anything I've said?
&gt; 

no applescritp is not a back door command line, it ias a simpleish
programmignlanguage - just like sh , or perl.

It is arguably easy to progam ans it can record evernts and play them
back,. you dont need ot know the language to do that.

Where you fall down above is by not spporting your original points, but by
introducing new points, when coutners to your ogirnal points have been
raised.
In other words you redifine your argument and disscard your orginal
points.

you also confuse a programign language with and interface(apple script).

Thereis nor reason taht any of the functionality you want can t be
provided in agui, it might be that it has not been downne,. but it cna be
done.

After all you r original gifind exampel was a ittle computer program, and
as we all nkow, for better or for worse, programs cna be written using
gui, drag and drop techniques.
Whtehre that is a good thing or a bad thing, well that is another
argument, but the fact is it cna be done, even if it is nto doen well, or
not currently done.
