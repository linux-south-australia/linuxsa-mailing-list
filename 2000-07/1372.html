David!

&gt; I think it's a good article.  The one glaring problem with it is that it
&gt; gives the appearance that InstallFest was all my doing, which is a great
&gt; pity considering the enormous efforts put in by so many.  

I think that it was an excellent answer and that you do actually deserve
credit where credit is due. You can actually "tell" reporters who should
also receive credit, but nonetheless I think we as a community all knew
who does anyway.

&gt; That was my first
&gt; time being interviewed and so I was not in control.  Next time I'll know to
&gt; make sure that the article gives credit to everybody.

At least better ways to get the reporter to give credit to everybody. In
my experience reporters generally say what they think is news-worthy,
and even if they do include the credits the editors can still take them
out (because they don't fit in or wotnot).

&gt;  I was also
&gt; disappointed that AUUG were not listed in the links.

Yes. AUUG did very well. In fact, you could try repitching the
InstallFest as a sign that:

* Linux is maturing
* Linux is very similar to UNIX
* AUUG and Linux User Groups don't represent different user bases

Or else, or else you could be grateful
 Once the flash and the fantasy grow cold
 That her stars did not allow here to grow old
 But I, I would tell you what to say.
