Hi Dan.

This "sue enveryone" approach is apparently the way it is done.
It's then up to the court to sort out how owed what level of duty
of care.  I'll bring the "Radio and Communications" article to
the next meeting.  It's a bit enlightening.

I'm not sure about other countries, but in South Austraila the
Department of Recreation and Sport recommends that hobby and
sporting groups incorporate.  I'm no lawyer, but I'd be surprised
if computing user groups faced differing legal issues than other
hobby clubs.

Rather than engage in some drawn-out e-mail discussion based on
rhetoric and philosophy, I've:

 a) asked two lawyer friends to write a short e-mail on the pros
    and cons, which I will forward to the mailing list

 b) asked Rec&Sport to send me their sporting club incorporatisation
    and insurance kit.  I'll pass this on the Geoff.

 c) arranged for an insurance quote from the insurer of the Federation
    of South Australian Bushwalking Clubs.

Hopefully, this will give us enough facts to make a reasoned decision.

Like you, I'm not too fussed either way.  What worries me is the overhead.
We're just dicussing the possibility of incoporating, and it's already
dominated the mailing list dicussion.  There's a possiblility for this
to get bigger than Ben Hur, rather than something that "just happens"
in the background.

Glen
