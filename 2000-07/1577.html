Hi Andrew,

&gt;Hi all,
&gt;Having a hell of a time with samba...
&gt;
&gt;Situation is such...
&gt;Box1                          Box2
&gt;RH6.2                        Win98
&gt;
&gt;linked by ethernet x-over cable
&gt;currently sharing an internet connection
&gt;All working, I can ping the boxes etc.etc.
&gt;I can access Box2 no problem from box1 as an smbclient...that part all
&gt;working ok...
&gt;
&gt;I can see Box1 from box2's Network Neighborhood, but as soon as I click
&gt;to open it I get a
&gt;Windows box come up to tell me...
&gt;
&gt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;"You must supply a Password to make this connection"
&gt;
&gt;Resource \\Will\IPC$
&gt;Password:_____________
&gt;
&gt;[check box] Save this password in your password list...
&gt;
&gt;snip&gt;

OK, this is a continuation of the problem you reported yesterday.

&gt;I have spent days trying to crack this one but for the life of me I
&gt;CANNOT find a reference to a password for the resource
&gt;"IPC$"

There is no password for that resource. It is an internal fake resource
that is used in browsing and a few other things.

What account and password did you log into your Windows box with?

&gt;Am I supposed to set a user ?
&gt;I tried "smbadduser xxxx:xxxx

Yes, you are supposed to add a user, but the above is no use, because other
info you have presented suggests that encrypted passwords are not in use.

&gt;but I get an error message saying I've no password set for the user...
&gt;How am I supposed to set a password for a nonexistent user?

You don't.

1. Log into your Windows box with a username and password that exist on the
Samba server. This may involve:

  useradd fred
  passwd fred   # and so forth.

&gt;I tried passwd, smbpasswd etc etc going round and round in circles for
&gt;HOURS but I'm not even close!!!!!
&gt;
&gt;A previous post by me on the subject informed  me to perform the
&gt;required registry hack to Windows(Win98 Plainpassword.reg)
&gt;This has made no difference..

Well, it did, but other problems prevent you from accessing the system.

&gt;As Root, I tried  "smbclient  -L //[SERVER_NAME]/
&gt;I get a password prompt, root password gives me a full list of shares
&gt;available...

Which suggests that all is OK, and you are probably not using encrypted
passwords.

What does your smb.conf file look like?

&gt;I am a rank samba beginner as you probably guessed.
&gt;Am I supposed to install smbclient software on the windows box? ie.an
&gt;smbservices program?

No ...

&gt;I have ordered a copy of "Teach Yourself Samba in 24 hours" and boy, I
&gt;can't wait 'till that comes...

Cancel it. Special Edition, Using Samba superceeds that book, and was
published a week or so ago in the US.

&gt;Any help, comments greatly appreiciated...
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!
