The only suggestion I have is better scheduling of assistance and tables.  
Also all that hardware leaves some concerns in the security and power surge 
department.  I do not fully understand what arrangements were in place, so I 
am not position to comment, but even so..

I also had my PC sitting around idle with a CD burner unused.  It will make 
things a lot easier if people with CD burners who are not presently 
receiving assistance could pool their CD burning resources.  Then software 
will exchange hands much more rapidly and speed up installs also.  I just 
did not have anywhere to plug my PC in to.

The talks were good, but it would have been nice to have some workshops for 
newbies.  Basic configuration, maintanence and so on.

All in all, I had a great day!  I felt I was amongst a community, which is 
something I have been pining for in SiliconLand for a long time.  And it fed 
off itself as more people picked up on it and offered assistance themselves. 
  The person who helped me with my install was an installee himself who just 
happened to be walking past at the time.  The atmosphere was fantastic.

Good on you people!  You did a great job!!

Ian
