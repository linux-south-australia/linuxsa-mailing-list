&gt; I accidentally deleted the lost+found directory on one of my

&gt; special way, or just "mkdir lost+found"?

lost+found is used as the repository for files and directories found by
fsck (usually with a ref count of &gt; 0, but no matching name in the Unix
file space, or something like that).  It not only has to pre-exist before
fsck is run, but also have been preallocated to a certain size (because
you can't really expand the directory while the file system you're
fsck'ing is possibly corrupted, can you?).  There is a mklost+found
command these days that will do all of the magic for you.
