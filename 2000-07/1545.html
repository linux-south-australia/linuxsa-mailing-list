&gt; I'm *very* gradually upgrading our company's internet gateway to a new
&gt; machine/version of linux. The old one has RedHat 5.2, and I'm moving on to
&gt; Madrake 7.1. One of the various little problems that has popped up is the
&gt; question of accounts. How can I migrate old accounts (just
&gt; usernames/passwords, really) from old to new?

There's a set of utilities to convert from old to new password format;
pwconv and grpconv (for password and group file, respectively).  Never
used 'em myself, but I haven't heard any complaints about them either.

&gt; As I am using shadow passwords and md5 encryption now (and the old one
&gt; didn't), I can't just copy files over and create home directories, can I?

I think once the shadow file is in place, you can't use passwords in
the passwd file (although I haven't tried that, either), but MD5 is
backwards compatible with DES encrypted passwords; the crypt() routine
in glibc grabs the '$1$' prefix of the salt and uses that to determine
whether to use MD5 or DES encryption (or something else yet again).

&gt; I wonder if the easiest method is to set up a script to read the contents of
&gt; my old passwd file, awk the username field, and add the user with some
&gt; generic passwd.

I did this once - it's doable using awk and useradd to keep the UIDs
and GIDs consistent.  If the above utils don't cut it for you, drop
me a line and I'll dredge it up.
