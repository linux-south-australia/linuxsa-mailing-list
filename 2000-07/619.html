Ian:
 
&gt; I have no concern with commercial software for Linux.

I guess the concern is that the commercial ventures might be able to
convince everyone that they own Linux. In the tarot cards, the 15th card
is The Devil. The Devil has no real power over you except that you
believe him. In the same way, Linux could become open-source but closed
at the same time. People only have to believe that
Corel/RedHat/Suse/[version x] is the only Linux for Linux to become
closed in effect.

&gt; I have found that commercial Linux vendors (mostly) offer a
&gt; superior service for a cheaper price than under the Windows platform.

Only because Linux users won't pay higher. When they do, they will both
be equal. Commercial vendors set their price by commercial means. If you
work in business and you don't set your price in this manner then you go
out of business.
 
&gt; I suspect that Applixware, WP and others are top of the range packages
&gt; (although I have not used them) and we should encourage support for
&gt; commercial ventures in Linux.

I've never used ApplixWare but I've been told it's good. Word Perfect
seems to be better than Word, though I use StarOffice if I need a
WYSIWYG office application. As most would know I'm one of these arcane
people who prefer to use a "meaning based" (wysiwym) markup style
language.

&gt; On the open source side, I have heard that there is a fantastic OS word
&gt; processor (the name escapes me but is on the tip of my tongue) that will be
&gt; improved over time and perhaps even rival the commercial offerings.

Are you talking about Abi Word? It's part of the GNOME office suite. In
addition there's rumour about that FrameMaker is going to be released
commercially for Linux...
