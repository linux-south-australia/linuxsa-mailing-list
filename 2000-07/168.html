&gt; 
&gt; Not world visible in what sense?  If it's accessible from the Internet,
&gt; it's world visible to any number of scanners that the script kiddies
&gt; use.  I had a sendmail box probed to see if it was spammable (no,
&gt; tweren't ORBS) less than 24 hours after it had been put up (and it had
&gt; no DNS entries).

In the sense that the box is actually a firewall, tho it does rather a
lot of other things (I know, but you try justifiying multiple machines
for a 30 person office :-) ). It does run the cyrus imap server, but the
firewall rules only allow access to it from internal hosts, hence "world
visible".
 
&gt; &gt; Current most likely culprits are sendmail and httpd...
&gt; 
&gt; Not likely, unless you're running a really old of sendmail (pre 8.8) or
&gt; Apache (don't even know of any exploits for Apache, and certainly not
&gt; rootable ones).  You're most likely culprits are wu-ftpd, bind or pop
&gt; server (nothing but the _very latest_ - a new wu-ftpd was released only
&gt; a couple of weeks ago).  One nasty bind exploit I've seen actually
&gt; blows away /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny (I was on the box at the
&gt; time, and only noticed because it screwed up qmail); luckily it left the
&gt; ipchain rules in place ...

Turns out it was wu-ftpd. I figured it was probably one of the others to
start, because I had heard of a sendmail/kernel bug recently (the
capabilities one), and they were the only two services I could think of
off the top of my head that the box made available. bind too, but I knew
that was up to date.. I'd sodden forgoten ftp was on there. :-(
