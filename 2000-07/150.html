&gt; Hi, I have setup a linux workstation at my work and have internet
&gt; access through an http proxy (spider) and am wondering if there is
&gt; some way of telling redhat linux about this, I know it works via
&gt; netscape but I would also like to be able to connect to the net so
&gt; that programs such as wget and redhat update tool work, the systems
&gt; people here can't help as they only use the proxy for netscape
&gt; configuration eg <A HREF="http://proxy/proxy.pac">http://proxy/proxy.pac</A> as an automatic proxy
&gt; configuration.  Anyone have any ideas

(A comma is not the same as a full stop. My eyes are hurting!)


Anyway, I daren't say it around here, but what the heck, RTFM...

Doing a search for "proxy" on the wget man page (man wget) tells me that...

    "http_proxy = string
                  Use the string as HTTP proxy, instead  of  the  one
		  specified in environment."

and that...

"The syntax of each line of startup file is simple:

            variable = value"

It also tells me that...

    "Wget  supports  the  use  of  initialization file .wgetrc.  First
    a  system-wide  init  file  will  be   looked   for
    (/usr/local/lib/wgetrc  by  default)  and loaded. Then the user's
    file will be searched for in  two  places:  In  the environmental
    variable WGETRC (which is presumed to hold the full pathname) and
    $HOME/.wgetrc."


So I would suggest that something like...

	http_proxy = julie.netcraft.com.au:8080

...in the file of your choice will suffice. (Of course changing the proxy
server to your preferred one.)

I should point out that for a system wide proxy setting, running "rpm -ql wget"
on my redhat system tells me that the file "/etc/wgetrc" exists, so
I'd suggest that is preferred over "/usr/local/lib/wgetrc".

If you want to implement a system wide proxy setting for all port 80
traffic, I'd suggest that it's not "easy" and would recommend that you
use the above method on all your software "eg lynx etc".
