&gt; &gt; Where as with unix find yoou end a up witha list of files. Yeajh great.
&gt; &gt; But with both you can do stuff tot the fiels.
&gt; &gt; The how you do stuff differs.
&gt; &gt; I beleive your orignial post said it was imppossible to do the find all
&gt; &gt; excel fiel smiodfied int he last 2 days and copy them to  azip disk.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I think I have shown how it could be done on one particluar gui.
&gt; 
&gt; In which case you have shown that you have misunderstood the
&gt; excercise.  No one is debating whether or not it can or can't be done,

I may have misunderstod, it, in which case please feel free to restate it.

&gt; the excercise was to devise a GUI dialogue box that gives you the
&gt; flexibility of Mark Newton's command line.


Well actually i think Markk was debatign whether it could be done or not,
at least implcitly.

&gt; In order to do this you'll need to cover everything that Mark can do
&gt; on the command line. He gave you this excercise because he knows that
&gt; it's futile. No matter what you come up with he'll add a new
&gt; 'requirement', thus illustrating the place that both the GUI and the
&gt; CLI has in computing.


And the sugestion I made did eveyrhting he did on the command line, it
would have found the speicifed files and caused them to be copied to a zip
cartirdge - that is what he wanted to do is it not?

If you wnat those servcies availalbe in a open or fiel select dialog box,
not big deal, you simply need ot rpelicate the contorls of soemthign liek
find file or sheerlock.

No big deal.

&gt; 
&gt; In fact I was rather hoping someone would take him up, it could be
&gt; quite an interesting thread.

May all your wishes come true as this one has.
