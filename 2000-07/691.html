I would like to point out to Alex that some people are not blessed with the
capacity to gain work in an environment that allows them this freedom of
choice. Some people struggle to get any work at all. Some people put a _lot_
more  effort into getting work than he did, but are still forced to work in
an area they don't like, using an OS they don't like. Some of these people
have families and mortgages, and do not enjoy the luxury of being able to
make these decisions in a way that would enable them to get where they want
to me. Some people have other priorities apart from being able to choose
what OS and tools to use.

That is all I want to say :)

&gt; &gt; Fine advice, but a little hard to implement if you are using a
&gt; &gt; Corporate SOE (Standard Operating Environment) that means you are
&gt; &gt; stuck with a mail client that doesn't get it.
&gt; 
&gt; Then get a new employer!
&gt; 
&gt; ROFL

Not as silly as it sounds. I specifically work at NetCraft because an
important aspect of my job is to be able to work without having stupid
corporate decisions thrust upon me. I choose my own tools. I don't use
exchange/outlook, and I don't read Word documents.

I have no sympathy for those that do, as I had to go to some effort to
have this luxury of choice. If you choose to work in an environment
that forces you to use outlook, then you have to put up with poor
filtering. Don't expect the mailing list to change for you.

Which was the original point of this thread.

Cheers

Alex!

P.S. It is worth noting that the word 'you' in this e-mail could
probably have been 'one'. It is not targeted at anyone in particular,
certainly not someone on this list.
