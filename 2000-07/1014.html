 &gt; Well actually it sounds more like a find file thign to me, not a general
 &gt; file selection file dialog, fiel selection dialog, even if they allow
 &gt; wildcards, still typcially only search in a single dir - the *nx find
 &gt; command is not analogous to a file selct dialog imo it ia analogous ot a
 &gt; find file command.
 
It is precisely analogous to a file select command, because the output
can be automatically pushed into other commands -- Either by modifying 
the --exec parameter, or by replacing it with --print and enclosing the
whole thing in `backticks` or $(command substitution parens).

A file find utility just finds files -- In a GUI it means you end up 
with a screen full of icons.  Yeah, great, terribly useful guys.  The
expressiveness of the command line is in the fact that that output can
be put to other uses which are far more flexible and useful than simply
displaying it on the screen.

 &gt; Of course you dont have the ability to execute a command with the current
 &gt; mac(and I dont hink the current windows) fiund file command, but the
 &gt; mac(and I assuem the windows) find file have the flexibilitu requried to
 &gt; find the files - from a gui.
 &gt; So the gui is not incapable of what you wanted to do, the interface for
 &gt; most of it - the hard bit is there.
 
The problem is that going the extra step, actually taking that output
out of the window it's displayed in and doing something useful to it, is
deemed to be "too complicated for the users to understand" by those who
do GUIs.  And the third party add-on solutions which do come close to 
doing what we're talking about here by themselves almost universally do
it by providing some kind of scripting language:  A command line in sheep's
clothing.

 &gt; You could of course applescript the whole thing - and you can write the
 &gt; applescript in a gui I believe you can even just tell it to record what
 &gt; you do and it will repeat it back which I am pretty sure you can do in the
 &gt; above case with enough generality to do what you want(eg bring found items
 &gt; window forward, select all, copy to blah) - though I have never done so.

Which really just proves my point.  The original poster was talking about
completely replacing the command line.  AppleScript is an add-on afterthought
to the MacOS which provides it with hidden command-line functionality.  The
fact that quite a bit of AppleScript's functionality (but by no means all 
of it) can be accomplished by dragging around icons doesn't alter this one
little bit:  Indeed, it's the bit that AppleScript *doesn't* let you do 
by dragging around icons which is important.

 &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't believe a broad statement like, "There is no place in a user
 &gt; &gt; program for the CLI," can hold water.  Look at the Mac:  They have no
 &gt; &gt; CLI at all, and claim the user-friendliness high ground, but Mac advocates
 &gt; &gt; tactfully fail to mention that there are some things you and I would 
 &gt; &gt; find tremendously useful and perfectly natural in a CLI environment 
 &gt; &gt; which are simply impossible to do on a Mac.  
 &gt; 
 &gt; But not the above example right?
 &gt; I assume in this case you are confusing your own lack of familiarity with
 &gt; a particular UI with a lack of features/power for that that UI?
 
No.  I'm countering an blanket statement with a perfectly valid
counterstatement.

At its heart, anyone who would advocate removing the GUI is, when it comes
right down to it, talking about removing useful functionality.  Why on earth
would anyone want to do that?

 &gt; I guess this is analogous to a windows or mc user seeing a linux box
 &gt; without X and assumign that it cant do image editing.

Please don't make the assumption that I'm unfamiliar with the Mac user
interface.

 &gt; The statement "There is no place in a user program for the CLI," may or
 &gt; may not be an erroneous or defensible statement, but the examples above 
 &gt; are not particularaly illustrative of your (I assume) assertion that a GUI
 &gt; can't do everything as well as a CLI.

Read what I've written above and tell me where it has fallen down.
The biggest point you've raised in defence of the MacOS GUI is AppleScript,
which, as covered above, is just a back-door command line anyway.  How
does anything you've said work against anything I've said?
