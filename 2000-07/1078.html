&gt;&gt; Well, in Latin it would be viri, not virii.  I suppose there's some
&gt;&gt; justification for that spelling, but the dictionaries I checked don't
&gt;&gt; mention any plural, which I take to imply "viruses".
&gt;
&gt; Ita verum [that's latin for "right on" or "yes"].
&gt; In my old latin dictionary [John T. White, 1890, wt=1.12 kg], it says
&gt;
&gt; virus, i, n
&gt;
&gt; I.e. it's a neuter noun with "viri" as the genitive singular.
&gt; There's an interesting/surprising definition:
&gt;
&gt; I. A.   A slimy liquid, slime.
&gt;    B.   A poisonous liquid; poison, virus.
&gt; II. [figurative, of abstract things:]
&gt;     Poison
&gt; III. A.   An offensive odour, stench.
&gt;      B.   A sharp, saline taste or flavour.
&gt;
&gt; I guess they didn't have microscopes in those days.
&gt; So they couldn't have the modern notion of a virus.

You'd laugh.  I bought the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 1970,
and it doesn't have that definition either.

&gt; PS. Uh-oh.
&gt; I've just looked in my grammar book to check,
&gt; because usually the -us -i endings go with masculine
&gt; second declension nouns only. But this one is neuter.

Strange.  Yes, you're right.  And neither of my Latin dictionaries
state the plural, only that the genitive singular is viri, which
suggests it's still 2nd declension.

&gt; This suggests that it is 3rd declension, in which case
&gt; its plural would be "vira"!!!!!

No, the third declension never has nominative plural in -a.  In fact,
the only other declension with nominative singular in -us (long u, as
in Jesus) is the 4th, and it doesn't have any neuter form.  I think
this must be an irregular 2nd declension noun, in which case it's
difficult to guess what the plural is.
