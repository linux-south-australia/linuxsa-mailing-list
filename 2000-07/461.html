One way to find out :)
 
&gt; 	I am about to set up a small network (1 server/6-7 workstations) with
&gt; 	Linux on the server, and a combination of windoze and linux on the
&gt; 	workstations.
&gt; 
&gt; 	The question I want to ask is which is the best distribution for the 
&gt; 	server ? I was simply going to install RedHat 6.2 and tweak it
&gt; 	according to my needs, but there now appears to be a plethora
&gt; 	of options available (e.g. Mandrake, Turbolinux), and I thought
&gt; 	I'd seek opinions.

It depends on what works for you. One distribution is not THAT much
different to another, since they all run on top of the same kernel
source. All I can recommend is that you try a few out before you settle on
one and see what meets your needs the best.

I've used SuSE, RedHat and Mandrake, and they all have their good points
and their bad points.

SuSE I found to be better for someone who doesn't like tinkering settings
manually. The wizards and things included worked brilliantly for what I
did with them.

RedHat is probably the largest and best known distribution, hence there
will be a lot of support for it if you can't work something out.

Mandrake is based on RedHat, so it is pretty much the same, but a lot of
work has gone into simplifying the configuration.

I've never used Slackware, Debian, or anything else, so I can't comment on
what they are like. I say try a couple of see what you like.
 
&gt; 	It is a commercial environment. The server does file serving, intranet,
&gt; 	database handling (small amounts), firewalling to internet, fax serving,
&gt; 	and anything else I can think of later :)

They should all be able to handle it easily, it's just a case of if you
prefer getting under the hood, so to speak, or you're a GUI person.
