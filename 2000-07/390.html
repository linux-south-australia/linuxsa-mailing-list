&gt; Hi Michael,
&gt;  From my own experience ide timeouts are a hard drive fault.

Or, the PC power supply may be faulty or not have enough capacity for the
attached equipment. For example, one power supply I had, had three devices
on one of the drive power cables, and the drive would 'power down' and
then back up occasionally when it was not meant to. Changing the drive to
another power cable fixed that. I also have a DEC Lpc 486 with a 145W
power supply, which is very quiet and used for routers, but some of the
hard disks on it started showing time-outs. I belive it is because I had
two hard disks, a DDS tape unit, a CDROM and a floppy drive running off
it. The disks themselves were fine.

&gt; &gt; Last night I was testing the ability to do Linux NFS image installs for no real
&gt; &gt; reason 'cept the upcoming installfest :-) and I ended up getting the worst hard
&gt; &gt; disk corruption I have ever seen.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; First, my setup:  a Cyrix 686 120Mhz box with 64M Ram, PCI thin ethernet card,
&gt; &gt; dual IDE controller.  hda is a 6G disk mounted as /home.  hdb is a 1.2G disk
&gt; &gt; mounted as /.  hdc is a finicky local 50x CDROM.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I mounted the Red Hat distro from hdc as /mnt/cdrom.  I exported it via NFS with
&gt; &gt; /mnt/cdrom (ro,insecure) in /etc/exports and kicked the appropriate daemons.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So across my thin coax line I did an NFS install which worked nicely albeit
&gt; &gt; slowly.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; During the install I could see the hard disk light on the server whirl away. 
&gt; &gt; This is strange thinks me, what the server is doing is lifting data from hdc on
&gt; &gt; one IDE channel, hand balling it to the PCI ethernet card for the network.  Why
&gt; &gt; is the hard disk whirling?  Hmmm.  Just ignored it.  The CDROM, hard drive light
&gt; &gt; and the LEDs on the ethernet card were all in sync.   Hmmm.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well the install finished and the hard disk light on the server stayed lit. 
&gt; &gt; Hmmm.  Looking back at the console I see my X desktop has frozen.  Hmmm. 
&gt; &gt; Switching to a virtual console sees IDE0 timeouts, but I can't log in.  Hmmm. 
&gt; &gt; Time for power cycle.  (I guess I could have rebooted the newly installed box
&gt; &gt; and tried telneting in, but I if login from virtual terminal didn't work I
&gt; &gt; didn't think telnet would either)
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I power cycle.  hdb on the server needed fscking, but was painless.  hda
&gt; &gt; failed the powerup fsck and needed more attention.  Dropping into single user I
&gt; &gt; really fscked it.  There were only a couple of THOUSAND errors spread throughout
&gt; &gt; the drive.  Home directories, /home/local (sym link on /usr/local) all stuffed
&gt; &gt; etc.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So, finally, my question, how could NFS-exporting my CDROM on hdc (IDE1) cause
&gt; &gt; timeouts on IDE0, cause the machine to lock up AND corrupt the /home (hda on
&gt; &gt; IDE0) filesystem which would have been really quiet at the time?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Huh?
&gt; &gt;
