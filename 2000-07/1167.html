&gt; &gt; I'm sorry, but where is it decreed that a GUI may not use 'plain

&gt; 
&gt; I'm unsure quite how you mean "label commands."  Perhaps you mean commands
&gt; which appear in menus should be in plain English, and they should and are.
&gt; I don't think a menu, or even menu hierarchy, is a likely replacement for
&gt; a shell.  Perhaps you mean that icons can or should have labels.  That also
&gt; seems reasonable, although when an icon represents a command in a program
&gt; (as opposed to a file), it seems that the current fashion is not to label
&gt; it.  (Those hateful little pop-up tool-tips are what people seem to use.)


I assume liek me John means that you can have text displayed either below
to the side or above of or part of an icon.
Or amyeb as a rollover thingk that pops out.

Have a look at a mac or windows and you will typically see an icon
representign a file, with the icon part represtnign the fiel type and a
text anem attached to the icon below it.

I suspect that is what is meant by label commands, although the exampel i
give is for fiels, there si no reaosn commands(whic h are just exceutable
files) can't have the same labeling.

For that matter tehre is no reason why an iconic reprsentaiton of a
prgoram cant have provisionot enter command lien optiosn as well as
provision to do it by wimpy means.

Eg double click on the program, up pops a doalog with check boxes,
pulldowns, etc to specify parameters as well as a text feild where you
can specify the same parameters, if you so desire.


&gt; My example was intended to illustrate that a picture is not always the best
&gt; way to describe what you want to do.  Imagine, if you would, having to find
&gt; the particular picture that represents a photo album.  I showed two that
&gt; you might have to choose between, but there likely are a lot more.  I
&gt; didn't show the "email face database", nor the "company personnel list",

yes but we are nto talking about pictures and wors, we are talkign about a
gui and a cli, one of the features of a gui, as oppsoed to a simel picture
is that it is dynamic and interactive, if you wnat help you can if
implemented get it.

A ascii picture does not allow this.

Hence your example whiel convenient ws nto that illsutrative of the
problem at hand.


&gt; nor the "video conference program," nor any of the hundreds or thousands of
&gt; quite different commands which might sensibly use a face as an icon.
&gt; How about the "printed page" icon that Micosoft use to represent a text
&gt; document; and the "printed page" icon that Corell use to represent a
&gt; text document: add the emacs and the pico and the n-ty other manufacturers
&gt; who all want to represent a text document, and I think it's easy to see
&gt; how an iconic interface would be confusing.
&gt; 
&gt; I contend that for a certain class of problem, such as the ones I just
&gt; alluded to, a CLI is better than a GUI.  The more things that you try to
&gt; iconify, the stronger my argument becomes.  It's okay if the only major
&gt; commands you have are "word processing", "spread sheet" and "shutdown", but
&gt; I think it's understood we're discussing general command lines on general
&gt; purpose computers, where the number of major command numbers a thousand or
&gt; more.
&gt; 


Ah of course, change the contention, or introduce a new one, where as
before it was gui can't do everything a cli can dop, or that guis can't be
as expressive, now it is that in socme cases it is more ocnvenitnet ot use
a cli...of course ignoring in smae cases it is more conveitn(for some
pepole) to use agui.



&gt; I have no problem with the concept that a GUI can be used to express what
&gt; you want to do.  I can imagine: click on data file, right click on sort
&gt; icon, select sort criteria in popup dialogue, right click on pattern match
&gt; icon, enter regular expression in popup dialogue, right click on field
&gt; selection icon, enter the fields you want to keep in popup dialogue, right
&gt; click on counting icon, select "count lines" on the popup dialogue, right
&gt; click on conditional expression icon, select "if input &gt; n" and type n in
&gt; popup dialogue, and so on.  Great, there's an off-the-top-of-the-head idea
&gt; for a GUI replacement to the shell.  I cannot imagine finding any of these
&gt; icons from a list of the thousand or so that I would need.  Icons are just
&gt; too easily confused with each other.  I have trouble discriminating between
&gt; a Microsoft internet mail icon and a Microsoft fax mail icon, and that's on
&gt; a system that has only a couple of dozen commands.



And text commands are to easily mistyped.

My personal bugbear is an attempt to move soemthign and end up with mc
instead of mv.

And it is very very hard to know what the available test commands are, and
then identify their purpose quickly.

Sure you can list your bin and sbin dirs, then run man for each one you
dont know abnout, but a gui coudl quite easily have a pop out description
of the command the icon represents when the icon is sleceted or the mouse
pointer is over it.

So you go to your window of commands, select the first wone, a breif
expanation analogous ot the syno[siss of a man page poips out. Not what
you wnat? fine plress the down arrow the next oen gets selected and the
popout help for that one apppears.

Ayway there is no reason as has been repeatedly stated that you can not
have text labels on your icons anyway, or if you choose to list you
directories in text (list) modode.
That way you can see the 1000s of command names, if you want.
You sitll ahve to know which one you wnat.

And of course there is not reason why you cant have a help system with
functionality simliar to man -k .

Another alternative might be use the icon to represent teh class of
command eg(file amnipulationcommands such as mv and cp migth have on type
of icon) whicle thqa actual comand name is visible in the form of a
textual description.


&lt;with respect&gt;

I think that you have to recognise the difference between un implemented
and impossible.

I also think you have to recognise that you were bought up in soe way
(whtehr it be cli ofr gui) and that of course seems easier, more
expressive, more powerful whatever for you.

That doesn't mean it is all of those things(more expressive,
powerful,whatever) it just means you are used to it and perhaps find it
hard to concieve alternatives without seeing them(which mayu not be
possible because no one has implemented them yet).

&lt;/with respect&gt;
