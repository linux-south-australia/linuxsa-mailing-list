&gt; Went to an IBM presentation this morning  really interesting to see there
&gt; approach to Linux
&gt; running Linux Apps in AIX (Project Monterey). Sounds really cool and
&gt; addresses some of the clustering & SMP
&gt; issues. 

IBM are trying hard to deliver on their promise to have Linux running on
all their hardware. The question for Monterey is whether it will be
commercially mature before Linux surpasses it in features and performance.
I think it will be a close race, a race in this case where only one party
has anything to lose.

For the moment there are a number of things that AIX does that Linux can't
do or can't do well.

&gt; they have apparently contracted someone from Linux Care in Canberra
&gt; to port Linux to
&gt; the new "Power 4", a processor board the size of a laptop running a 32 CPU
&gt; SMP cluster!!!

See <A HREF="http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_0006_01/msg00959.html">http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_0006_01/msg00959.html</A>,
posted by a pretty pleased IBM team leader. Took Paul a week.

&gt; They really are on the band wagon.

They are indeed. I get calls from mainframe users and developers at times
and I have been astonished at how the idea of Linux on the S/390 seems to
be catching on even though Linux isn't really capable of providing what
OS/390 currently claims.

&gt; PS they still put on the hard sell. an S80 is only $536,840 American! but I
&gt; guess someone
&gt; had to pay for the breakfast :-)
