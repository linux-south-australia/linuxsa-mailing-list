G'day folks,

I'm still coming to terms with how spectacular today's turnout
was - just a shame we couldn't get any TV coverage to "stick it
to bill" with :-)

Anyway, I rolled my PC out around lunchtime and was blown away
by the quality and simplicity of the installation process.

It detected all my configured hardware (ATA33 drive and cdrom,
USB 3buton mouse, etc) and went off without a hitch.

Chose gnome/enlightenment as my window manager/environment and
subsequently grabbed and installed helixcode as recommended by
someone I stood next to for most of the day but can't remember
their name :-)

(thanks for the help, by the way!)

Now I've only got two niggling problems that I can't nut out
myself - not yet anyway - so any ideas / experience would be
great.

System:

PIII/700E (100FSB) 128M (PC133) 20Gb UDMA IDE & USB rat.

My sound card, a CreativeLabs PCI128 3D blaster, pci probes
as an es1370 - fair and reasonable considering that is the
chipset used by Creative for this card.

However, sound functions don't work properly.  I get jittering
sounds from all attempts to play any sound.  esd seems to be
involved somehow, both within X and without (eg: using play/or
mpg123).

The sound test from the snd configuratoin cmd line tool does
play (albeit extremely soft and almost entirely unintelligbly,
distorted beyond recognition).

At first we thought (thanks to Alex's guidance) that interrupts
were an issue - /proc/interrupts was showing es1370 sharing the
interrupt with ide1 (cdrom controller).

I've since disabled the cdrom, network card, and parallel port
and now the es1370 has its own interrupt (just for testing).

Unfortunately, I get the same audio results.  Jitter, distorted
snd test, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... card works just peachy in win98.

SECOND question (not a problem yet, until I get stuck *smirk*:

Is the ASUS CUBX ATA66 controller supported?

I booted OK using ATA66, but found no driver support for the
controller in the default kernel...so it couldn't find / to
mount - I'm about to check out the src tree :)

Again, any help appreciated!

Cheers

Leigh
