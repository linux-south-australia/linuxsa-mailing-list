Hi!

I recently setup a firewall machine for a friend of mine (and was
actually paid to do it - I now am the proud possessor of Government GST
until they get it back from me). Specifically:

* blocked almost everything except FTP, finger, some ICMP messages,
http, SMTP, pop and https

Interestingly some sites are actually scanning his sytem quite regularly
for well known ports.

Yesterday, he called me to say that the system doesn't work any more. I
agreed to go around and look at what was happening and quickly
discovered that the modem was set to the wrong port. He claimed noone
had physically touched the computer, yet there were no obvious signs
that someone had actually hacked the computer and either managed to
switch the /dev/ files themselves or adjusted the startup scripts.

I was quite puzzled, and decided, despite the fact that "noone had
touched the computer" to look at the back and see what was plugged
where. I looked and thought, "that's funny. Why isn't the modem and the
mouse screwed in and plugged in properly?" Given that I'd also built and
installed the computer I knew exactly how I'd left it.

I came to the conclusion that reversing the two devices physically
couldn't damage the system, so I did; it came up and went fine. Firewall
was functioning and everything was normal. I quizzed my friend again...

"Oh, X was in the house for 15 minutes but X wouldn't know a thing about
the hardware and wouldn't touch it. X is only into graphics".

My friend has 3 computers. It's not altogether obvious which mouse
belongs to what computer unless you're familiar with them. Furthermore,
the mouse for one of the computers was placed on top of the computers'
speakers (standing next to the monitor).

So I thought here's the answer:

X wants to play with Photoshop
X discovers the most logical mouse does nothing
X concludes there is no mouse on the computer that is on
X sees the mouse on the Linux box (on the floor)
X disconnects the modem instead of the mouse and doesn't bother to screw
it back in
X disconnects mouse
X goes to put the mouse on the other computer but discovers the real
mouse in the process
X hastily puts back the Linux mouse and modem but BACK TO FRONT
X says nothing at all (becuase he knows my friend would probably take
him to task if he admitted to playing with the cables)

It was quite amusing in the end of it all, but it just goes to show.
Even total novices who have absolutely no idea about getting root
password and rm -rf /* still can take a system down. 

:-)
