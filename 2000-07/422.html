hello sean (and others that have replied),

yes, i did think about using ipchains, but then i thought about some
possible flaws in polled data that i've experienced in the past with other
distributions i've authored. ipchains does an execellent job of volume
accounting, but the way a user program would have to collect it i'm not
too keen on. i've thought about several conditions where inccurancies
could arise (it's an issue with any process that polls system data that
has no ownership, and that isn't sessioned i guess). and so, i've been
considering better ways around this.

but, some of you have showed me that there is a number of distributions
already available, so i'll be looking at them first before i do anything
else. this is probably what i'm after, and it won't be necessary for me to
write anything.

has anybody used any of the following dists mentioned:

ipaudit
bandmin
ipacct
ipmeter

has anyone got any recommendations?.

thanks for replying ;)
