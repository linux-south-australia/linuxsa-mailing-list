Hi all,

I work for a small business with just a few employees.

What we're looking for is some sort of server software that will run on the
linux box that can give us a shared task list on our wintel desktops -
preferably inside Outlook.  I've investigated Outlook Net Folders and it
simply doesn't work very well / at all.

We use an old beast running RedHat 6.2 (yes, the one that gave us / is
giving us lots of trouble) that sits in the corner and spits packets in and
out of our office.  We can beef this up as required if there is there
anything we can run that will do the job?

As I type, we are installing our promotional copy of MS Small Biz Server out
in the workshop.

Please, save us from this misery.

My boss saw this:

and is now convinced we can do this without resorting to using small
business server.  Unfortunately there is no link to further information
about this.

btw:  We are not (currently) in a position to use linux as a desktop OS.

All suggestions greatly appreciated.

Regards,
