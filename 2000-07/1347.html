&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a convention on the plural of virus when referring to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; computers? I tend to use virii...but is this proper?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, in Latin it would be viri, not virii.  I suppose there's
&gt;&gt;&gt; some justification for that spelling, but the dictionaries I
&gt;&gt;&gt; checked don't mention any plural, which I take to imply "viruses".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     It was my understanding that words ending in 'us' in the
&gt;&gt; English Language were pluralised by substituting 'i' or
&gt;&gt; sometimes 'ii', but I believe the former is correct. As an
&gt;&gt; example that I know to be correct - the plural of Octopus is
&gt;&gt; Octopi. However with the Bastardisation of the English
&gt;&gt; Language from influential sources, ie the Internet, some
&gt;&gt; words, and in particular computer related words, have been
&gt;&gt; changed because it is "easier" to remember them. Virus
&gt;&gt; appears to be one of them as every reference I can find
&gt;&gt; related to it gives the plural "viruses". Unfortunately as
&gt;&gt; time goes by and more people are exposed to these
&gt;&gt; influential sources, the incorrect versions will become the
&gt;&gt; correct terms and words and the correct words will fall into
&gt;&gt; disuse.
&gt;
&gt; I thought I had sent this message before, if  I have, my apologies.
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Octopus is a GREEK word, not a Latin word.  For some reason,
&gt; which I cannot understand, most Greek words ending in "os" end up as
&gt; ending in "us".

They come via Latin.

&gt; 4.  It also seems that in Greek, the "u" (upsilon) is translated
&gt; into 'y", for whatever reason I cannot fathom.  Perhaps some Greek
&gt; scholars could enlighten us on that point.  I am aware a Capital "u"
&gt; looks like a "y".

It's simple.  The Greek "Y" (ypsilon) is pronounced like a Y.  Ask any
modern Greek.  Lower case wasn't introduced into Greek until later, so
the fact that the lower case letter looks like a u is not very
significant.  In classical times, the Latin U was derived from Greek Y
early on, and Y was derived later after the pronunciation had changed.
