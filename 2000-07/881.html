<H1>Another InstallFest success</H1>

<PRE>
We dropped in at the InstallFest a little late in the day, and bumped
into a friend who offered us a used laptop HD at a reasonable price
that was 4x the storage space as I'd had.  

So today, knowing I could take my laptop back to it's original state
just by putting the old HD back in, I had no hesitation in installing
Linux today on my old Compaq Contura 400 via a network installation.

All went reasonably well, and tonight my old laptop is actually
set up using Enlightenment/Gnome, which blows me away since it's only
a 40mhz machine with 20mb memory.  

Down the road I plan on doing some tweaking such as getting rid of the
RH Gnome version and updating with the Helix code Gnome as well as
updating and severely stripping Enlightment so she'll be a nice lean
set up.

All in all, I'm quite impressed - even my built-in trackball works,
and I figured I'd have to use an external mouse with the set up.

So, there's one less laptop runing Win9x tonight, and that's courtesy
of the InstallFest since the HD was handed over to us there.  :-)

On another note, because we were already in the city for the
InstallFest, we ended up enjoying the Torch ceremony as well. I know
it wasn't entirely planned, but the two coincided well.  Ta!


Cheers,
Gaelyne
