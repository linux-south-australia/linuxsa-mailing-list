&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just out of interest, what are people's favorite webmail sites?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone use their local ISP webmail?
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo mail does not work properly with Japanese characters. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; prefer hotmail to Yahoo mail.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Don't most other major mailing lists put a [LISTNAME] prefix onto
&gt; &gt; their subject lines?  It would solve more than one person's problem
&gt; &gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; As previously mentioned, we already have solved the problem with the
&gt; X-Loop: header. As previously mentioned, it is only one or two cases
&gt; where filtering this is not possible, that is not the rest of the
&gt; list's problem.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there a reason that the LinuxSA admins haven't made this happen,
&gt; 
&gt; The subject is just that. A subject. If you want to know what mailing
&gt; list the mail comes from, look at the X-Mailing-List: header. That is
&gt; what is is there for.

Although unlike X-whatevr headers, the subject line is easily redable to
the human filter without turnign on full headers.

This is an advantge, imo.

Also the fact that some piece of email comes from some list, is arguably
part of the subject matter - eg the subject of most email on this list is
linux related - the [blah] format is not out of place in the subject line
imo.

Would it hurt to cater to those who actually like the [blah] format?

It is not as if it is difficult to do, I believe it is a standard option 
in majordomo.

And some people might have different ideas on how their mailboxes hsould
be organised.

Eg I might want all my linux email in one box but like to know where
individiul pices of email originate - might.
