www.storagereview.com is the place to go for proof on this matter.

I did a quick comparison between these three drives, each of which are the
fastest on the market in its catagory:
Quantum Atlas 10k II (36.7 GB Ultra160/m SCSI)
Western Digital Enterprise 10k (18.3 GB U2W-SCSI)
Quantum Fireball Plus LM (30.0 GB ATA-66)

Using the "IOMeter - File Server Access Pattern - Load = Heavy" tests these
where the results:
IOs/Sec --
Quantum Atlas 10k II: 267
Western Digital Enterprise 10k: 224
Quantum Fireball Plus LM: 145
MB/s --
Quantum Atlas 10k II: 2.92
Western Digital Enterprise 10k: 2.44
Quantum Fireball Plus LM: 1.58

Just from these results you can see that IDE has a looong way to go before
it can get close to SCSI.
Also under RAID conditions, the SCSI drives would have a huge leap in
performace of the IDE drives.

Although... compare the price diff between a 2 drive SCSI RAID system and a
2 drive IDE ATA-66 RAID system.
The IDE system will come up best for price vs performance.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Suppose you tried to put a mirrored (aka raid 0) set on a single IDE
&gt; &gt;&gt; controller then every write would have to complete on one drive before
&gt; &gt;&gt; it could even start on the second.  This would obviously reduce write
&gt; &gt;&gt; performance by 50%.
&gt;
&gt; (and to explicitly answer the original submitter's real question, yes,
&gt; you can leave your unused other drive connected to the controller, as
&gt; long as it's really unused).
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Agreed totally.  The big issue here is that IDE sucks donkeys' balls.
&gt; &gt; End of story :-)
&gt;
&gt; Without a more thorough investigation of donkey's balls, I'd contest
&gt; that statement.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It has been "designed" (and I use that word lightly) as a
&gt; &gt; cheap-and-nasty lowest-common-denominator way of attaching a hard
&gt; &gt; disk to an ISA-bus PC, and subsequent versions have been bolted-on
&gt; &gt; to non-ISA systems by butchering that thing which passed for a
&gt; &gt; specification to make it even more perverse and arcane.  Why is it
&gt; &gt; that you can pick up any SCSI controller and expect it to work with
&gt; &gt; any SCSI drive, but the IDE interface "standard" is so ritually
&gt; &gt; buggered by so many vendors that every general purpose OS on the
&gt; &gt; market ships with basic features like IDE DMA turned off by default
&gt; &gt; because they can't be assumed to work at all?
&gt;
&gt; Hmm.  Why don't you come out here and I'll give you a handful of SCSI
&gt; host adaptors to play around with.
&gt;
&gt;   "SCSI isn't magic.  There are some very sound reasons why it is
&gt;   occasionally necessary to sacrifice a live goat to the SCSI chain".
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyone who is serious about running a high performance server is
&gt; &gt; *strongly* recommended to use SCSI.  Ignore benchmarks which claim
&gt; &gt; a higher megabyte-per-second value for IDE drives; They're
&gt; &gt; meaningless, because usually servers are more interested in I/O
&gt; &gt; transactions per second,
&gt;
&gt; No, they're meaningless because almost nobody does sequential I/O in
&gt; real-world applications.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; not megabytes-per-second, and SCSI will always deliver more I/Os per
&gt; &gt; second than a comparable IDE drive because of innovations like
&gt; &gt; tagged command queueing, basic things which IDE can't hold a candle
&gt; &gt; to.
&gt;
&gt; As I was reminded yesterday, parallel SCSI still sends out its
&gt; commands at 5 MB/s async.  ATA (previously known as IDE) connections
&gt; are simpler, so they don't need this backwards compatibility, and they
&gt; issue the commands at the (fixed) bus speed.
&gt;
&gt; A lot of myths have grown up about the difference between SCSI and
&gt; ATA, and in perpetrating them many people have not noticed ATA
&gt; sneaking up behind them.  I've recently been looking at the
&gt; differences, and they're not nearly as big as you may think.  In
&gt; particular:
&gt;
&gt;   When you're looking at multi-user systems, disk bandwidth is the
&gt;   number of bytes transferred per second.  You can get speeds like 20
&gt;   MB/s or 30 MB/s if you're transferring sequentially, but this just
&gt;   about mandates a single process, so the values are meaningless.  In
&gt;   real life, you position, you transfer, you repeat.  So the real
&gt;   throughput is dependent on the transfer rate, the average latency,
&gt;   and the average transfer size.
&gt;
&gt;   Average latency is in the order of 7 ms.  Average transfer size is
&gt;   in the order of 8 kB, which means about 400 µs on a modern drive,
&gt;   whether ATA or SCSI.
&gt;
&gt;   High-end SCSI drives can usually position about 1 ms, maybe 2 ms
&gt;   faster than ATA drives.  On the other hand, despite tagged queueing
&gt;   (which, BTW, modern ATA drives also support), the command setup is
&gt;   slower (look at the spec).  A few years back I looked at the
&gt;   behaviour of SCSI drives with a SCSI bus analyser and found that the
&gt;   setup time could exceed 1 ms.  I'm sure things are better now, but
&gt;   they're probably still slower than on an ATA bus.
&gt;
&gt;   Clearly, the real-life transfer rate is much more dependent on the
&gt;   latency than the sequential transfer rate.  It's also dependent on
&gt;   the transfer size, but you don't get much option with that.
&gt;
&gt; So what's the real disadvantage of ATA drives?  They're generally a
&gt; little slower in latency, and you really need a separate ATA
&gt; controller for each of them.  On the other hand, they're also cheaper,
&gt; and so are the controllers.  On the other hand, a good SCSI host
&gt; adaptor will cost more per drive than an ATA controller.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; IDE drives will happily provide the illusion of better performance
&gt; &gt; on a single-user system, until you try to put "real" load through
&gt; &gt; them (the reason they look like they're giving better performance is
&gt; &gt; because it's rather difficult for a single user to put "real" load
&gt; &gt; through them during day-to-day activities).  As soon as you put an
&gt; &gt; IDE disk on a multi-user server, though, expect performance to drop
&gt; &gt; through the floor.
&gt;
&gt; Would you like to measure that?  Run some device benchmarks against
&gt; both SCSI and ATA and compare the results?  Here are the results of
&gt; running rawio against the fastest ATA and SCSI drives on my test
&gt; machine:
&gt;
&gt;            Random read  Sequential read    Random write Sequential write
&gt; ID          K/sec  /sec    K/sec  /sec     K/sec  /sec     K/sec  /sec
&gt; ata        1547.2    96   6696.7   409    1532.0    94    6184.4   377
&gt; scsi       1242.6    78   1236.3    75    1295.6    77    1310.6    80
&gt;
&gt; Now admittedly I'm comparing 2 year old SCSI drives with modern ATA
&gt; drives, so this isn't fair.  But it doesn't exactly slam ATA.  You
&gt; presumably have modern SCSI drives available; how do they perform?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ... and let's not even mention the performance implications of swapping
&gt; &gt; on an IDE drive, shall we?  Thank you.
&gt;
&gt; Why not?  Hopefully swap drives aren't maxed out, in which case the
&gt; latency isn't as much of an issue.
