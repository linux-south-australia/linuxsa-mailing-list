&gt; The only suggestion I have is better scheduling of assistance 
&gt; and tables.  

yes -- We need some sort of system. After some time, I instituted a queue,
so that people who got in first could get a table before people who got in
late, but we should have had that organised at the start. Also, we needed a
table numbering system, and a whiteboard for writing who had what problem
where, so people who are helping could look there to see where they were
needed.

&gt; Also all that hardware leaves some concerns in the security 
&gt; and power surge 
&gt; department.  I do not fully understand what arrangements were 
&gt; in place, so I 
&gt; am not position to comment, but even so..

yes, security was tough. We had a few people keeping their eyes peeled, and
we tried to keep hardware labeled and checked. It wasn't the best solution,
but it worked OK for us.

Power wasn't good. We didn't have time to check that we weren't overloading
any circuits, and the circuits themselves weren't protected (AFAIK), and we
daisy-chained random powerboards. We had one powerboard overload and shut
off, but it didn't cause problems. Next time, we will do better in this
department, _somehow_... :)

&gt; I also had my PC sitting around idle with a CD burner unused. 
&gt;  It will make 
&gt; things a lot easier if people with CD burners who are not presently 
&gt; receiving assistance could pool their CD burning resources.  
&gt; Then software 
&gt; will exchange hands much more rapidly and speed up installs 

hmmm... what we really needed (IMHO) was a central library of CDs that were
labelled and lent out and returned ASAP. We also needed boot floppies
galore, and clearly identified server locations for a copy of each distro.
_and_, we needed ISOs on a server, so we could burn on demand all over the
place... :) 

&gt; also.  I just 
&gt; did not have anywhere to plug my PC in to.

that's the power problem, which is a tough one to solve...

&gt; The talks were good, but it would have been nice to have some 
&gt; workshops for 
&gt; newbies.  Basic configuration, maintanence and so on.

yes, but where would we do this? :)

Maybe this is an event for another day (or another LinuxSA meeting...)

&gt; All in all, I had a great day!  I felt I was amongst a 
&gt; community, which is 
&gt; something I have been pining for in SiliconLand for a long 
&gt; time.  And it fed 
&gt; off itself as more people picked up on it and offered 
&gt; assistance themselves. 
&gt;   The person who helped me with my install was an installee 
&gt; himself who just 
&gt; happened to be walking past at the time.  The atmosphere was 
&gt; fantastic.

That sounds really good

&gt; Good on you people!  You did a great job!!

Thanks (on behalf of everyone who did a great job -- which is everyone...)
