Yeah, I would like to write one that is like my favourite magazine - New 
Scientist.  Intelligent, easy to read, and rigorous in the analysis 
department, but written so that even I could read it when I was a young 
child without much difficulty yet enjoy it even more as an inquiring adult 
who is not a scientist.

In other words, written for people with a brain but with lots of 
explanation.

My home email address is <A HREF="mailto:ian_mcleod@primus.com.au">ian_mcleod@primus.com.au</A>

Please send suggestions of terms and concepts to include and I will make a 
start.  Please go easy on my, this will be my first contribution and it may 
take a while as I am quite busy, but ideas are welcome.

&gt; &gt; I agree..  It is too easy to point someone to manuals and
&gt; &gt; How-To's, etc.  I
&gt; &gt; often resort to IRC and lists after reading the manuals or
&gt; &gt; because it is
&gt; &gt; much easier.  I work on a help desk which holds 'docco' to be
&gt; &gt; paramount, yet
&gt; &gt; human nature means we more often stick our heads over our
&gt; &gt; cubicles and ask
&gt; &gt; our co-workers.  Besides, it builds a 'community' which I
&gt; &gt; would like to
&gt; &gt; encourage as something FUNDAMENTAL to Linux.  This is what
&gt; &gt; attracted me to
&gt; &gt; Linux above, is the community that I find no where else.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Being a newbie myself (although a fairly experienced one now)
&gt; &gt; who started
&gt; &gt; from scratch all on his lonesome, I am happy to re-translate
&gt; &gt; documentation
&gt; &gt; in accessible, non esoterical ways, to make it short and
&gt; &gt; sweet for the
&gt; &gt; newbie.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think something just as important as a FAQ, command list or
&gt; &gt; how-to, is a
&gt; &gt; GLOSSARY.  I don't mind writing one up that is as
&gt; &gt; non-technical as possible,
&gt; &gt; an entry level glossary.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi everybody :)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;Just a reminder that this list is about to be *inundated*
&gt; &gt; with newbie-style
&gt; &gt; &gt;requests. Those of us who have been around for a long time
&gt; &gt; will be well
&gt; &gt; &gt;advised to take care with how we respond to their requests.
&gt; &gt; Note that there
&gt; &gt; &gt;is nothing wrong with "RTFM", as long as the "TFM" to "R" is
&gt; &gt; specified in
&gt; &gt; &gt;the email, and if the manual is actually fine :). Of course,
&gt; &gt; if someone
&gt; &gt; &gt;claims to have read the manual, "RTFM <A HREF="http://the.manual/">http://the.manual/</A>"
&gt; &gt; isn't going to
&gt; &gt; &gt;help them much -- try to give them help in interpreting and using the
&gt; &gt; &gt;manual... point them to the specific part of the manual, and
&gt; &gt; walk them
&gt; &gt; &gt;through it. It would also be a Good Idea(tm) to go easy on
&gt; &gt; the religious
&gt; &gt; &gt;wars and flames for a while, simply so as not to intimidate newbies.
