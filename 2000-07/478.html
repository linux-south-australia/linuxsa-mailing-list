Agreed,

As a lecturer for the Business Studies Component of the Advanced Diploma in IT
at Adelaide TAFE (Including Quality Management) I am heartily sick of the MS
centered philosophy.  Please note it is soul destroying to meet and teach
diploma qualified IT personnel who speak and believe there is MS and then there
is GOD. Sigh.

However, I can assure you all that I provide comprehensive BROAD views on
business and computing models and introduce moral and philosophical
implications of tying oneself up to any organization.

I think it is important that  all of us not promote one disto over and above
another but to promote "open source" free etc etc.  Remember the choice is, and
should be, for the individual.

LPI is the way to go and I point all of my students to open source projects as
a way to get experience and a track record for their own CV's

There is a great paper at:
<A HREF="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/articles/currents/017.html">http://www2.linuxjournal.com/articles/currents/017.html</A>  for those who are
interested in the other war that is raging apart from the tech war we are
normally exposed to.

There are many in education who are fighting the MS tide with skills other that
technical skills but with a moral and ethical underpinning of freedom and
fairness.

&lt;/soapbox&gt;

Really though our hidden war is just as important as the tech war that is much
publicized in the media.

&gt; I did look into the LPI certification, and it seems a bit shallow. Simple

&gt; &gt; Subject: Debate on the issue of certification
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I wanted to reignite the debate on certification by injecting
&gt; &gt; my opinion.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There are several certification routes that one can go:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   - the Red Hat certification program, a vendor-specific certificate,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   - the SAIR/GNU Linux certification program, now part of Wave,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;   - The Linux Professional Institute's (LPI) certification program.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of these, the LPI certification program has broad industry
&gt; &gt; backing, and is
&gt; &gt; trying to avoid vendor specifics (in anycase, all Linux
&gt; &gt; distros are very
&gt; &gt; similar to each other, with maybe 2% differences).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, I feel that those of us who are into certification should
&gt; &gt; demonstrate that we want an independent program that it not
&gt; &gt; tied to any one
&gt; &gt; vendor, as much to demonstate that we want a vialable Linux
&gt; &gt; industry out
&gt; &gt; there, not tied to any one vendor's marketing needs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For that reason, I suggest that those who are interested in
&gt; &gt; certification
&gt; &gt; should take the currently available LPI exams and support
&gt; &gt; their aims. They
&gt; &gt; can be taken through VUE, and are relatively in-expensive.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Comments please.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regards
