&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have bind 8.2.2_P5-9 installed at a site and am trying to set

&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; When you say split, are you referring to the split of resolver and
&gt;&gt; &gt; server?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; No, having a separate internal and external DNS ...
&gt;
&gt;Yes, but which functions of DNS are you trying to move around. You
&gt;have the "name server" and the "resolver server (library)". All
&gt;'forwarders' does, is queries the listed server for the DNS resolution
&gt;and the queried server does the whole "get the . domain server, get
&gt;the .au domain server, get the .com.au. domain server" thing.

Well, here is what I am trying to do:

[Big Bad Internet]------[Firewall]-------[Internal Network]

Big Bad Internet, we all know about.

Firewall runs a DNS and contains a minimal set of names, like www, mail,
etc. They all resolve to the firewall or IP addresses that the firewall has
or other machines in the DMZ have.

Internal Network uses private IP, and runs its own DNS. Internal names
resolve in it and I want two do two more things:

1. External names that are queried by internal users should be passed to
the external DNS for resolution.  The documentation on the forwarders
option says:

"The forwarding facility can be used to create a large site-wide cache on a
few servers, reducing traffic over links to external nameservers. It can
also be used to allow queries by servers that do not have direct access to
the Internet, but wish to look up exterior names anyway. Forwarding occurs
only on those queries for which the server is not authoritative and does
not have the answer in its cache. "

The last sentence seems to cover what I want.

2. On the firewall, I want to set resolv.conf to point to the internal DNS.
This appears to be the classic split DNS setup, according to my
understanding. Then, the firewall can resolve both internal and external
addresses, at the cost of an extra hop for all external addresses.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone had this working?
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt; Yup. What else is in your named.conf file?

Unfortunately, despite using:

   options {
       directory  "/var/named";
	forwarders { xxx.yyy.zzz.aaa; };
       query source address * port 53;
  }

I do not get any queries forwarded to the external DNS, while all names for
which my internal DNS are authoritative are answered promptly.

[Rest of the useful information deleted.]
