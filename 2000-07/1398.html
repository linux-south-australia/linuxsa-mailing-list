Mark!

&gt;  &gt; At the moment we are *all* going at risk individually. There is noone to
&gt;  &gt; pursue except each and every individual.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think that's entirely true;  If it was, it'd mean you could
&gt; suffer unlimited liability by simply signing-on to a mailing list or

There is a form of LOGICAL ARGUMENT that goes:

all X is only Y
A is X
Therefore A is Y

You can counter it withY

BUT some A is  Z

Contrary to my nature I'm not willing to enter into what is obviously an
unfortunate misunderstanding of my largument expressed in everyday
English and assuming the listener would actually grant me some leeway in
logic.


&gt; There has been a lot of scary stuff about how much we'd all be responsible
&gt; for if someone sued.  The real answer is that most of us would be responsible
&gt; for nothing at all.

That is true. That is true. However, the organisers - Richard Russell,
David Newall and myself (I was given significant mention) - may have
been and definitely the installers. Perhaps this doesn't count for
anything. Perhaps RR, DN and the other installers don't care. I cannot
speak for them.

I can only say I'd prefer to work under the auspices of a legal body,
such as AUUG...

&gt; Who can the aggrieved visitor sue?  At the last meeting, the answer
&gt; was "All of us!" but that's obviously wrong.  In truth, the following
&gt; people could probably be reasonably expected to bear the brunt of it:
&gt; 
&gt;     - The individual who carried out the installation (i.e.: the actual
&gt;       person who destroyed the data); and

I guess WE shouldn't even care about the individual. That's not in our
charter is it (incidentally, please note the sarcasm in this particular
statement)?

&gt;     - The organizers.

Ditto.

&gt;     - Possibly the venue owners.

Taking that as an example, I presume that 2 to 3 hundred thousand
dollars out of the venue owners' cash flow wouldn't decrease a chance of
a wage rise or such thing. Incidentally, if I were to mount even a
semi-legitimate case against a body in a legal setting, it could easily
amount to this particular figure. It is true that you may get it back in
costs, but I'm talking about cash flow, not expected profit or
reimbursement...

&gt; The organizers and venue owners wouldn't wear the same liability as the
&gt; installer, either: Although they would have contributed to the data loss
&gt; by setting up the event in the first place, they weren't the actual people
&gt; who caused the hypothetical data to be lost.  And let's remember that the
&gt; judge would also need to consider that the plaintiff deliberately signed
&gt; a piece of paper which said he knew about the risk of dataloss and
&gt; wanted to proceed anyway.

And let's consider that there is a way to shield installers and
organisers from such questions in the first place.

&gt; Additionally, we could argue that it was actually an AUUG event, and move
&gt; the whole problem to them :-)

Ummm....we did in the public liability sense, but not the professional
indemnity sense!

&gt; Claims that "... at the moment we are *all* going at risk individually..."
&gt; need to be put in context:  We are all at risk individually for our
&gt; individual actions.  David's statement above, "There is noone to
&gt; pursue except each and every individual," should be modified by appending
&gt; the phrase, "who actually contributes to the acts which have lead to the
&gt; lawsuit."

The corollary of which is, if you don't want to put yourself at risk in
our current structure, do absolutely NOTHING to contribute to a or many
act(s) that could lead to a lawsuit...

&gt; So what would happen if LinuxSA were incorporated?
&gt; 
&gt; Answer:  "The Installer" would no longer be an individual, since the actual
&gt; human being who typed the commands which destroyed the data would be acting
&gt; in the role of an agent of the person known as "LinuxSA Incorporated."
&gt; Also, the individuals who organized the event would also have been agents
&gt; of LinuxSA Incorporated.  As such, LinuxSA Incorporated would be the
&gt; "person" who could be sued, and the actual dollar amount of the liability
&gt; would be limited to the assets of the Incorporated body.

Precisely. It was exactly what I was saying. In fact, it was exactly
what I said. You have clarified what I didn't say but thought that
people would understand. They obviously did because you did :-P

&gt; actions by counting ourselves as a member of the group (which is pretty
&gt; strange for a group which donesn't maintain a register of members!) should
&gt; be regarded as facile hyperbole.

There is a saying "THE LAW IS AN ASS (as in donkey, so don't get
excited)". It's there for a reason.
