&gt; No. Not at all. Your problem looks like the errors and the frame. If I
&gt; get more than 1 error per 10000 RX Packets I start to look for what is
&gt; going wrong. Also, your "frame" is 199 extra than mine but I'm not
&gt; certain what "frame" refers to (i.e. I'll have to RTFM about it).

I agree that the errors are looking like the problem, somewhere in
hardware, but where that could be, since you've changed everything at
your end, I don't know.
 
&gt; &gt; adlax1.optusnet *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0

&gt; 
&gt; Just out of interest, why is adlax1.optusnet in there twice? I would
&gt; have thought that it would have been in there once. Also, why has it
&gt; appeared as a domain name in the default RATHER than an IP address... I
&gt; know that what I've said isn't exactly helpful but these appear
&gt; "different to normal" to me and they might help someone else discover
&gt; your problem.

No, that's a quite normal looking routing table. pppd generally adds a
route for the exact box on the other end of the ppp link (the top line),
and a default route for everything else at the bottom. On a Redhat box
(not sure of others), route resolves dns names by default, you can do
route -n to get nameless IPs in your routing table, which can be useful
if your connection to your nameserver isn't up.
 
&gt; &gt; What console tools would _you_ be using to diagnose the above problem/s?
&gt; &gt; Please let me know and I'll do some reading :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Well, you look like you've been using some reasonable console tools to
&gt; fix it. RedHat 6.2, as I understand it, does some things differently to
&gt; its predecessors and I haven't looked into it TOTALLY yet. Nonetheless I
&gt; haven't heard that it acts as dismally as you describe.

No. I'm trying to work out where the errors are coming from... it seems
unlikely that Redhat would be causing them, normally I'd say that it
was hardware, but it seems that you've replaced most of that.

The second make problems are probably caused by not installing the
package
kernel-headers, btw.
 
&gt; &gt; Is it time to reinstall this baby from scratch?

I was under the impression you already had?

Tom
