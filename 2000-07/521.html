&gt; I am no sendmail guru (well, I knew a lot about it years ago, but have
&gt; slipped), but ...

Neither am I, but "thanks to the wonders of the sendmail-cf package,
now you too can configure sendmail in the comfort of your own home!"

I realise you know this, I just needed to say that.

&gt; I have been reviewing the sendmail config at one customer site recently to
&gt; make it simpler and more maintainable ...
&gt; 
&gt; We have what is a standard config in this situation:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   [Big Bad Internet]----[Firewall]-----[Internal Mail Server]
&gt; 
&gt; All mail is received on the firewall and relayed to the Internal Mail Server.
&gt; 
&gt; All internal addresses are from one of the Private IP domains. 
&gt; 
&gt; When I set this up four years ago, I had to hack the sendmail config file
&gt; to defeat DNS name lookups on the internal mail server name so the IP
&gt; address could be looked up in the hosts file. 
&gt; 
&gt; The ways to handle this these days is to use the LOCAL_RULES stuff in your
&gt; sendmail.mc file, or to use split DNS.  
&gt; 
&gt; However, both of these are quite complicated, and it seemed to me that
&gt; there is a need for a FEATURE, perhaps called internal_mail_hub that allows
&gt; people who are trying to set this sort of system up to do so easily.

It's actually already pretty simple with existing sendmail-cf
FEATUREs. This is all straight from www.sendmail.org BTW.

Use the standard /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf/redhat.mc file and comment
out the recomended line. Compile and use.

Allow RELAY access to the necessary machines in /etc/mail/access

	localhost.localdomain           RELAY
	localhost                       RELAY
	127.0.0.1                       RELAY
	192.168.0.1                     RELAY
	example.com                     RELAY

Where 192.168.0.1 is the IP address of your internal mail server, and
example.com is the domain name to receive mail for.

Now do the forwarding bit in /etc/mail/mailertable

	example.com                    smtp:[192.168.0.1]

Next build your hash tables by typing 'make' from /etc/mail, and
restart sendmail.

Go to your internal mail machine and get it to forward all outgoing
mail to the gateway machine. In the case of Exchange boxes you can do
this from one of the quaint little GUI dialogue boxes. In the case of
sendmail you can read <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section4.html">http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section4.html</A>#4.12
to get you started on using "smart hosts". The syntax escapes me now.
It looks something like the example above.

<A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section4.html">http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section4.html</A>#4.12 tells you how to
deliver local mail and batch remote mail if you care.

I don't know if their are any domain resolution issues that I may have
missed here, complain loudly if I misunderstood or am answering the
wrong question. This may be a help.
