&gt;&gt; Ahem,

&gt;&gt; 	I am about to set up a small network (1 server/6-7 workstations) with
&gt;&gt; 	Linux on the server, and a combination of windoze and linux on the
&gt;&gt; 	workstations.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 	The question I want to ask is which is the best distribution for the
&gt;&gt; 	server ? I was simply going to install RedHat 6.2 and tweak it
&gt;&gt; 	according to my needs, but there now appears to be a plethora
&gt;&gt; 	of options available (e.g. Mandrake, Turbolinux), and I thought
&gt;&gt; 	I'd seek opinions.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 	It is a commercial environment. The server does file serving, intranet,
&gt;&gt; 	database handling (small amounts), firewalling to internet, fax serving,
&gt;&gt; 	and anything else I can think of later :)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'd recommend Debian.  Why, well because that's what I use:-) But
&gt; seriously, it does have the best package management software of any
&gt; distribution (except for those distributions which are basically a
&gt; modified Debian anyway).  And it is the most stable distribution.

OK, other people have recommended Debian to me as well.  I've been
trying to install it for over a week.  I'm not stupid, I've installed
most flavours of BSD and Linux with no problems, but I can't get
Debian to recognize my Ethernet board.  I'm not alone in this: I had
the CTO of a large Linux services company here last weekend, and he
tried in vain to help (admittedly, he's not a Debian guru).

How about an installability competition on Saturday?  In any case,
I'll bring my box, and we can see if anybody can get a recent potato
running on it.
