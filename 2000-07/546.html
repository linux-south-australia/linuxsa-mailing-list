Hi,

&gt; OK, I have a file that I though was stored on our NT server here at work...
&gt; However, it turns out that it was a local file, stored on my C: drive. But
&gt; at this stage, it's too late -- I have Linuxified my system, and what was a
&gt; single NTFS partition is now a two ext2 partitions and a swap partition...
&gt; 
&gt; I want this flie back though, and so I went to the extreme measure of
&gt; running `strings /dev/hda/|grep &lt;filename&gt;`... It found a lot of evidence of
&gt; this file, and I think I have the whole path available to me... Is there any
&gt; way that anyone knows that I could get my file back? I would consider
&gt; re-NTing my system to get it, although I doubt that would work...

Quickly, go to the backup you have of the file and restore it :)

Slowly, really no solutioon. I've recovered files where a new OS has not
been installed by some fancy partition work, but the best method is to try
and find out roughly on the disk the file is stored, and then maybe read a
whole heep of blocks around it into a file on a diferent partiton an see
what comes out (don't know how you'd do that, maybe theres some way to
talk to the device).

cya
