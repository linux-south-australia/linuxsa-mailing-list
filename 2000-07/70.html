&gt; &gt; Anybody else notice that this comparison is skewed by the fact that the
&gt; &gt; SCSI drives are 10,000 rpm while the ATA drive is only 7,200 rpm?
&gt; &gt; Surely this would effect the latency...
&gt;
&gt; It has an even greater effect on throughput because the speed of disk
&gt; transfer is proportional to rpm.  Why?  You can't transfer a track in
&gt; less time than it takes the track to pass under the read/write head.
&gt; A drive spinning at 10000rpm is approximately 40% faster than one
&gt; spinning at 7200rpm.
&gt;
&gt; Just to be quite accurate, modern drives have large on-board caches,
&gt; which permit them to return from a write immediately.  Read operations
&gt; don't benefit quite so much unless you read in the order that the
&gt; drive electronics predicted (assuming the drive does read ahead, which
&gt; is likely.)

It's true that this is one of the major factors, but the other is density.
If you increase the density then you can read more information in the
same amount of time. I've just bought some Fujitsu ATA drives that
are 5400 rpm and give better performance that older IBM 7200 rpm
SCSI drive. I can only assume this is due to the recording density of
the disk. The SCSI drives are 4.5GB and the ATA are 13.2GB.
