Hi All,

I have a strange problem which I hope someone can help with.

Our ISP is hosting equipment on site and as such, we no longer dial in
to get connected.  We plug in directly to their switch.  Yay.  I have a
gateway/firewall running Redhat 6.2 with 2 NICs in it.  One on their
network, the other on ours.  Here is the strange bit.  When I access the
WWW from the gateway (i.e traffic only going through 1 NIC), the
performance is quite good.  When I then transfer any file to my network
(i.e. traffic only going though the second NIC say from my gateway to my
proxy), the performance is great.  When I try and access directly from
my proxy through the gateway to the outside world, the performance would
be better if I had a hairy two inch piece of string connecting networks
together.  I do get some traffic but it is slooowwwww.

Any ideas out there?  Can anyone suggest what I might be able to do/run
to see what is causing the delay?  I have tried flushing the ipchains
rules and having a default accept policy.  No change.

The setup:
AMD K6-2 with 128M RAM (probably overkill but it was laying around)
2 X FA310TX NIC
Redhat 6.2

Cheers
Mark Collis
