&gt; This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Firstly, it is bad ettiquette to send HTML e-mails to the linuxsa
mailling list. Please don't so that again or I'll have to put you on
to Mark Newton for a quick tutorial on the correct use of internal
modems.

&gt; Does anyone know how to set the root directory for a user to /home
&gt; so = that when they type in "cd /" it takes them to their /home
&gt; directory = even though it appears to them that they are in the
&gt; root???

I'm assuming you want this to stop users from roaming the filesystem.
Well unfortunately that's not as easy as it sounds. The best way to
stop bad things from happening when people log into your system is to
learn about system security. If for example, you stop people from
having access to /bin, how will they get a directory listing? (hint:
/bin/ls).

What you want to do is possible, and 'chroot' is your friend. However
if you are interested in limiting your user's access to the
filesystem, you should probably provide them with ftp access instead
of shell access. The reason is that someone's already done all the
work for you. If this is all you want to do then I believe there is a
HOWTO or something around that gives the step by step insructions on
how to setup a chrooted, non-anonymous, ftp environment. If anyone
knows of such a beast can someone please speak now, cause it's
bugger to type out.

Cheers

Alex!
