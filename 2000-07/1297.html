&gt; Feel free to disagree.  However let's not keep discussing this stuff forever. 
&gt; Linux is far more interesting than subject lines and html-erised email. 
&gt; Hopefully when we have an FAQ these issues will be resolved forever :-)

While I like to use pure text for email, it would seem that RTF and HTML
are becoming and already are used 'standards' for email text content.

People have a choice to use that for email content in the same way they
can have a choice to use Linux. Given that HTML and RTF do no bloat email
in the same way that a JPG sig would I do not see it as unreasonable.

I use pine or elm some of the time to read email and I cope.

If LinuxSA wants to enforce a pure 7bit text then perhaps this could be
done at the mail server with a filter.

But this would be a bit like this: "Please don't use a version of MS word
greater than 2.0, as I only use MS word 2.0 and cant read your documents".

Dale.
