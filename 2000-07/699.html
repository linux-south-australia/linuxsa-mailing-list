I have try Slackware 7.0 and Redhat 6.0. Both are good.
Readhat package and Slackware package are easy to convert.
Slackware is quick to install by choosing default
installation of all packages. Slackware is more stable
than redhat 6.0 I have more reboot on redhat system than
any other. BSD is good too.FreeBSD have a lot of porting
software already compiled on the net. OpenBSD is the most
secure OS for the free OS. NetBSD is good to consider.IF
you choose GUI base , you should go Redhat or FreeBSD. I
personally choose Redhat myself if  I do not have
experience. With Slakware you may have manually change
some configuration files to make it work properly. eg .
config the netcard. or sound card while redhat mostly
detectable those devices. 
Have you ever try sco unix? why not it's free too.
www.sco.com . With Sco, you can config the system manually
or by GUI. My suggestion is to try a few systems first to
know which one fits your taste.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; One way to find out :)
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	I am about to set up a small network (1 server/6-7
&gt; workstations) with
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	Linux on the server, and a combination of windoze
&gt; and linux on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	workstations.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	The question I want to ask is which is the best
&gt; distribution for the 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	server ? I was simply going to install RedHat 6.2
&gt; and tweak it
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	according to my needs, but there now appears to be
&gt; a plethora
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	of options available (e.g. Mandrake, Turbolinux),
&gt; and I thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; 	I'd seek opinions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It depends on what works for you. One distribution is
&gt; not THAT much
&gt; &gt; different to another, since they all run on top of the
&gt; same kernel
&gt; &gt; source. All I can recommend is that you try a few out
&gt; before you settle on
&gt; &gt; one and see what meets your needs the best.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've never used Slackware, Debian, or anything else,
&gt; so I can't comment on
&gt; &gt; what they are like. I say try a couple of see what you
&gt; like.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd say definately give Slackware a try.  I installed
&gt; version 7.1
&gt; for the first time two nights ago - although the install
&gt; is a little
&gt; utilitarian, it should be fine for anyone with a bit of
&gt; experience (read,
&gt; easy for a 16 yr old with a year of use behind him), and
&gt; it was the
&gt; //fastest// install I have ever seen.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not encountered any problems so far - generally,
&gt; it's a
&gt; well-rounded, fast and stable distro.  Just don't expect
&gt; nice integrated
&gt; GUI config tools (linuxconf / drakconf etc.) - still,
&gt; editing config files
&gt; gets things done a lot quicker anyhow.  The BSD init
&gt; system was something
&gt; new to me, but it seems a very simple and effective
&gt; method.
&gt; 
&gt; The only downfall I can see is that lack of a robust
&gt; packaging system -
&gt; however, slack's pkg tools are compact and easy to work
&gt; with.  But I don't
&gt; think you would encounter many other apps packaged in
&gt; this format on the
&gt; net.  Anyhow, installing from source is fine.
&gt; 
&gt; Just my thoughts :)
