HI there,
This is my first go at asking a question on this mailing list so please
bear with me.
*As an aside* - how does anyone find the time to read all these
messages?

I was at the last linuxsa meeting (last Tuesday) and heard a brief
discussion of using DDO's with linux.
A comment from the back was *won't lilo overwrite the DDO* and this was
also my understanding.
As my BIOS will only read a 2GB hard drive, and I have 8.4GB and *shame*
need the BIOS for win95, I have had to use loadlin to load the linux
kernel from a dos menu before win95 kicks in.

Does anyone know for sure if lilo will do the above and will I be able
to worm my way out of it if it does.
Thanks if you can advise me.

PS sorry to the bloke selling T-shirts - I said I was going to buy one
but had to leave - next time!
Michael
