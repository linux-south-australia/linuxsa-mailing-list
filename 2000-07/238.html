&gt; Concerning the recent Melbourne IT announcement of

&gt; And is this really the future?

Not really, Melbourne IT are jumping the gun.

In a world of competitive domain name registration they are
trying to gain service differentiation by getting to Asian
languages early.

The standards don't have to be stable, or even exist, before
the allocation of the names can be registered.  And, just as
in English, companies will rush to secure their business and
product names.

&gt; Maybe the DNS will be regionalised, and we won't be
&gt; able to access web sites outside our language bloc.

Isn't that the case now, for cultures unfortunate enough
not to us the US ASCII character set?

&gt; doesn't this imply that all of the BIND software in the world
&gt; will have to be updated to some sort of unicode alphabet?

See the following Internet drafts (stored at
 <A HREF="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/ietf/internet-drafts/">http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/ietf/internet-drafts/</A>
and other places).

Internationalized Domain Name (idn)
-----------------------------------
 
  "Requirements of Internationalized Domain Names", James Seng, Z Wenzel, 
  05/12/2000, &lt;draft-ietf-idn-requirements-02.txt&gt;                         

    This document describes the requirement for encoding international
    characters into DNS names and records. This document is guidance for
    developing protocols for internationalized domain names.               
 
  "Comparison of Internationalized Domain Name Proposals", Paul Hoffman, 
  06/14/2000, &lt;draft-ietf-idn-compare-00.txt&gt;                              

    The IDN Working Group is working on proposals for internationalized
    domain names that might become a standard in the IETF. Before a single
    full proposal can be made, competing proposals must be compared on a
    wide range of requirements and desired features. This document compares
    the many parts of a comprehensive protocol that have been proposed. It
    is the companion document to 'Requirements of Internationalized Domain
    Names' [IDN-REQ], which lays out the requirements for the
    internationalized domain name protocol.                                
 
  "RACE: Row-based ASCII Compatible Encoding for IDN", Paul Hoffman, 
  06/19/2000, &lt;draft-ietf-idn-race-00.txt&gt;                                 

    This document describes a transformation method for representing
    non-ASCII characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely
    compatible with the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an
    ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) for internationalized host names, as
    described in the comparison document from the IETF IDN Working Group.
    This method is based on the observation that many internationalized
    host name parts will have all their characters in one row of the ISO
    10646 repertoire.
