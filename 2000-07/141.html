You mean you *want* someone to develop one?!

&lt;/boggle&gt;

 &gt; What absolute bollocks! If anyone actually believes that the Liberal
 &gt; Government is actually trying to stop CHILDREN from looking at PORN they
 &gt; must have rocks in their head.

Nobody ever did believe that;  It was a cynical effort to win-over 
Harradine's vote, and the votes of the oh-so-frightened great unwashed.
The time was right:  The only way to rise a panic over Internet content
is to do it when most people who end up talking about it have never
used the Internet;  It's getting harder to find people who don't know
and understand the issues, so there was really no other time when the
Libs could pump it for publicity.

IIA's Director, Peter Coroneus, is now upfront about saying that Alston
doesn't care about the BSA anymore, he's moved on to other things.  The
only people who really do care about the BSA are:

    (a) those who are employed at OFLC, ABA and NetWatch,

    (b) the 100-or-so people who have tendered complaints since January,

    (c) the two or three people in the known universe who complain about
	the unavailability of filters for their platform.

Try not to be part of group (c) :-)

 &gt; Who voted this right wing, conservative bunch of idiotic overseas
 &gt; company lovers into this country? 

The people who thought the grass would be greener on the other side,
of course.
