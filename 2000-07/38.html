Hi Guys

This is only an observation and open to correction if need be.

How can anyone say they put their swap partition in the middle of an ide 
hard drive? There are only a couple of platters in them and a maximum of 
4 heads. This would max out the number of cylinders to a couple of 
thousand. They use translation of some description and have more 
'logical' heads and less 'logical' cylinders.

&gt;  &gt; Suppose you tried to put a mirrored (aka raid 0) set on a single IDE

&gt;  &gt; it could even start on the second.  This would obviously reduce write
&gt;  &gt; performance by 50%.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed totally.  The big issue here is that IDE sucks donkeys' balls.
&gt; End of story :-)
&gt; 
&gt; It has been "designed" (and I use that word lightly) as a cheap-and-nasty
&gt; lowest-common-denominator way of attaching a hard disk to an ISA-bus
&gt; PC, and subsequent versions have been bolted-on to non-ISA systems by
&gt; butchering that thing which passed for a specification to make it even
&gt; more perverse and arcane.  Why is it that you can pick up any SCSI 
&gt; controller and expect it to work with any SCSI drive, but the IDE interface
&gt; "standard" is so ritually buggered by so many vendors that every general
&gt; purpose OS on the market ships with basic features like IDE DMA turned
&gt; off by default because they can't be assumed to work at all?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone who is serious about running a high performance server is 
&gt; *strongly* recommended to use SCSI.  Ignore benchmarks which claim a 
&gt; higher megabyte-per-second value for IDE drives;  They're meaningless,
&gt; because usually servers are more interested in I/O transactions per
&gt; second, not megabytes-per-second, and SCSI will always deliver more
&gt; I/Os per second than a comparable IDE drive because of innovations like
&gt; tagged command queueing, basic things which IDE can't hold a candle to.
&gt; 
&gt; IDE drives will happily provide the illusion of better performance on a
&gt; single-user system, until you try to put "real" load through them (the
&gt; reason they look like they're giving better performance is because it's
&gt; rather difficult for a single user to put "real" load through them during
&gt; day-to-day activities).  As soon as you put an IDE disk on a multi-user
&gt; server, though, expect performance to drop through the floor.
&gt; 
&gt; .... and let's not even mention the performance implications of swapping
&gt; on an IDE drive, shall we?  Thank you.
