&gt; Agreed,
&gt; 
&gt; As a lecturer for the Business Studies Component of the Advanced Diploma in IT
&gt; at Adelaide TAFE (Including Quality Management) I am heartily sick of the MS
&gt; centered philosophy.  Please note it is soul destroying to meet and teach
&gt; diploma qualified IT personnel who speak and believe there is MS and then there
&gt; is GOD. Sigh.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I can assure you all that I provide comprehensive BROAD views on
&gt; business and computing models and introduce moral and philosophical
&gt; implications of tying oneself up to any organization.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it is important that  all of us not promote one disto over and above
&gt; another but to promote "open source" free etc etc.  Remember the choice is, and
&gt; should be, for the individual.

At Xavier College, teachers are still teaching using specific Office
Applications and I expect this to continue for some time, as they don't
like change (the students handle it better). But our students do know
that there are other operating systems out there that work better and
there are even a few kids who are now running linux.

Perhaps Word Perfect Office will help change this.
