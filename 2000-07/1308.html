&gt; Is there any way I can get access to how IPs are mapped?  I cant

You cannot tell which IP ranges are mapped to which countries.

Generalising wildly, IP allocation happens in stages: addresses are
given by IANA to a registry, that registry then allocates some of those
addresses to a company, that company then allocates an address per
machine.

There is opportunity at each stage for an address allocation to
cross national boundaries.  For exmaple, all of IBM uses the one
IP address allocation.

Someone stated that:

&gt; The only ones which I can say are allocated to Australia are
&gt; 203.0.0.0 through to 203.63.255.255. which are allocated to Telstra Internet 
&gt; or BigPond Direct, they used to be available through AUNIC which is now run 
&gt; by Telstra...

which is incorrect.  AUNIC was a registry located in Australia.
It did not limit address allocation to just Australians -- for
exmaple, Fauldings' US offices use AUNIC-allocated space.  Nor
was it necessary to be a Telstra cusomter to get space.  Nor is
AUNIC now run by Telstra: it is run by a person who is currently
a Telstra employee -- the distinction being that if he leaves
Telstra then the function follows him.

&gt; My purpose is primarily to deny access to a box from all but
&gt; Australian IPs and things like that.  Ive had a look at places like
&gt; Apnic and stuff, but they dont seem to be particularly useful :(

If your intent is to limit connections for legislative reasons,
then you are doomed.  The Internet's topology does not map
well onto national boundaries.  Laws are also absolute, so
these exceptions are sufficient to cause you compliance
difficulties.

If your intent is to limit connections for reasons of network
topology (eg: to avoid expensive links) then this can be easily
done.  Simply develop a BGP AS Path regular expression that
identifies the expersive links.  Attach a BGP Community value
to these links.  Now program your web server to interogate a
BGP routing information base with the source IP address of
incoming connections.  Refuse those that contain RIB entries
that contain the Community value.
