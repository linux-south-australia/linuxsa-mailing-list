Michael and all!

&gt; I agree with most of what you've outlined. In regards to incorporating
&gt; LinuxSA, I don't think that is necessary because independently we are
&gt; (possibly) acountants, lawyers, etc.,with enough weight to ask for a change.

That is very true but we are talking about different matters here. Let
me make it quite clear that becoming an incorporated body (or any other
legal entity however defined) does not detract from any individual's
power, rights or obligations. I believe it only enhances and compliments
the individual.

We will always have the power to act as individuals or groups of
individuals. Gaining a legal entity will continue to allow us to enjoy
that benefit but also help us deal with certain matters such as:

* Vendor X donates "$10 000" to `LinuxSA'

Currently, who are LinuxSA? And how do we decide how said money is
distributed? Who gains the interest on it, and if it were invested in
capital (to keep up with inflation) who would wear the capital gains
tax? What would happen if it were entrusted to Entity Example (EE), and
EE simply refused to give it back?

I'd suggest that we could legally get the money back, but then back to
the first question...you could bind the money by trust or contract to
the nebulous `LinuxSA' but who is the other party to the contract? Not
`LinuxSA' - that doesn't exist.


Gaining a legal identity will not detract from our separate identities.
In most of the associations and societies I have been a member of it
shows a successful, well-run organisation. There is no need for the
members of the organisation to feel that LinuxSA acts differently,
although it would become far more obvious to whom the organisation is
run by.

Glen Turner pointed out if we were to run by a committee that committee
could meet once a year. I also point out that, although it would be odd,
one could write a constitution such that only ONE person administered
the association...

PS:
 
&gt; As the group LinuxSA we ask if "we work together on this" to develop free
&gt; software that can be easily validated by the ATO.

As a legal entity "LinuxSA" we could tender a contract to the ATO and
use the funds from said contract to help out at the next
InstallFest...oh the possibilities...

Or else, or else you could be grateful
 Once the flash and the fantasy grow cold
 That her stars did not allow here to grow old
 But I, I would tell you what to say.
