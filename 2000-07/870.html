<H1>FAQ alpha 0.1</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Hello... here's an early pre-release of the FAQ... or at least a skeleton of
it... I'd like to SGML-ise it or something -- somehow, I want to be able to
generate HTML and text, with automatic numbering... Could someone suggest
something (David Lloyd -- perhaps you could send me your SGML DocBook source
for one of your documents)

Please review this and make any comments you want -- feel free to fill bits
in (preferably send only to me) or suggest I add or remove sections. Note
that I have a nasty habit of writing WAAAY too much, so feel free to cut
this down to size... However, in any case, we don't have to fill the whole
thing in at once, and much of it could be replaced by references to
appropriate doco... Maybe the technical section should be removed and
replaced with REAL Questions as they are asked...
