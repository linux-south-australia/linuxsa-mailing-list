Perhaps you might like to look at Interbase? (www.interbase.com)

It's not open source, but will be "real soon now" (The open source release
of IB6 is meant to happen next week, I believe)

It's easy to install, is ANSI92 SQL compliant, and has a great developer
community (mailing lists at www.mers.com)

There are also versions available for other OSes, including Windows.

Regards
  Nick Lothian

&gt;
&gt; Paul!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Of the three SQL databases around (PostgreSQL, mySQL and mSQL), which
&gt; &gt; would be the easiest to install, setup and run?  (I know a few SQL
&gt; &gt; commands and did about 2-3 months Perl coding last year, so the idea of
&gt; &gt; programming and scripting doesn't overwhelm me.)
&gt;
&gt; This is the subject which creates religious wars. If you are looking for
&gt; ease of use I would suggest mySQL. It is very easy to setup, very easy
&gt; to use and very powerful in its own way. You can get the latest copy
&gt; from:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/</A>
&gt;
&gt; Whilst the "stable" version is not GPL, you can use it for free for most
&gt; purposes. The newer versions will be GPL compatible. If you don't know
&gt; what the "GPL" is about see <A HREF="http://www.freesoftware.org/">http://www.freesoftware.org/</A>
&gt;
&gt; I suggest mySQL because:
&gt;
&gt; * it is very easy to set up
&gt; * it has a lot of easy-to-use documentation
&gt; * it has a significantly busy mailing list (like one gets mail at the
&gt; rate of about 1 per five minutes)
&gt; * it is, in its own way, very efficient
&gt;
&gt; PostGres, on the other hand, is just as good - and some would say a
&gt; better - database system, but it lacks a sensible HOWTO [incidentally,
&gt; before someone takes me to task, there was a recent discussion at
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:lpd@lists.debian.org">lpd@lists.debian.org</A> which essentially said that the PostGresql howto
&gt; was utter bollocks and totally useless; those who answered from the
&gt; PostGres team themselves admitted it needed rewriting].
&gt;
&gt; &gt; What will I be doing with the database?  Actually, it's just a learning
&gt; &gt; project to become more familiar with databases generally.
&gt;
&gt; Start up with what you feel comfortable with. Thee is a new riders book,
&gt; author's surname of DuBois called "MySQL". I got it from the Bookshelf
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.thebookshelf.com.au/">http://www.thebookshelf.com.au/</A>) in Adelaide...
