How I got RH6.1 and DOS/Windows and Disk Manager to 
work successfully on my old laptop.  Recounted in all its 
tedious detail, in the hope that the information may actually 
be useful to others in a similar situation.

The objectives:
- Replace an existing 120MB HDD in my Toshiba T1900 with a 2GB HDD. 
- Transfer the existing DOS/Win from the old HDD to the new HDD.
- Install a DOS/Win astronomy application that needed 700MB of disk 
space onto the new HDD.  I know most of you won't need to do this ;-)
- Install Disk Manager to allow the old Toshiba BIOS to see the new drive.
- Install RedHat 6.1 onto the new HDD.  My Toshiba has 20MB RAM 
which is okay for RedHat.

Helpful ingredients:
- an old 486 (desktop) computer with 20MB RAM, CDROM drive, floppy, etc 
- an adaptor for attaching notebook HDD to standard IDE connector
- Disk Manager 7 for Toshibas (this was a free download)
- Partition Resizer  (free from <A HREF="http://members.xoom.com/Zeleps/">http://members.xoom.com/Zeleps/</A>)
- DOS boot floppy with CD-ROM drivers, etc

Procedure:
1) XCOPY the contents of the old HDD to an empty DOS partition on 
the desktop's HDD.
Note: Toshiba laptop HDDs have a group of 4 pins adjacent to IDE Pin 1.  
To make the Toshiba into a slave drive, you need to put a jumper on  
the pins nearest to IDE Pin 1.

2) Install the new Toshiba HDD as the _master_ drive on the desktop 
computer. The desktop's own HDD was connected as a slave drive.

3) Boot from DOS floppy and run Disk Manager on the new HDD.  I created 
a 500MB DOS primary partition and a 700MB DOS drive in an extended partition.
Disk Manager also did the formatting and made the new HDD bootable.

4) Disk Manager actually created a 1.5GB extended partition with a 700MB 
DOS drive in it.  As this left no room for Linux I then used Partition Resizer to 
shrink the extended partition down to 700MB.  You can install Linux into an
 extended partition but I chose not to.

5) XCOPY the old DOS/Win installation from the desktop HDD to the new 
500MB DOS partition.  Unfortunately Norton Ghost and Disk Manager don't 
get along :(

6) Install the huge astronomy program from CD into the new 700MB 
extended DOS partition.  Disconnect the desktop's HDD.  Reboot to ensure 
everything in DOS/Win works like it used to.

7) Start the RedHat installation.  For simplicity I did a single partition for 
everything except a 60MB swapfile.

8) I didn't install LILO; because Disk Manager already occupied the Master 
Boot Record, and my Linux / partition was located well above Cylinder 1024.  
But I did create a Linux boot floppy during the install, for the next step.

9) At this point I had a system that would boot to DOS/Win without problems 
but not to Linux.  I created a C:\LINUX directory, and copied into it the LOADLIN 
program off the RedHat CD.  Then I rebooted from the Linux boot floppy.

10) After Linux started, I created a /mnt/DOS directory and then mounted the 
DOS C: drive:
    mount -t msdos /dev/hda1 /mnt/DOS

I then copied the Linux kernel to the DOS C: drive:
    cp /boot/vmlinuz-2-20-whatever  /mnt/DOS/linux/vmlinuz

11) Then ran fdisk /dev/hda to check where my Linux partition was 
located.  (Mine ended up on /dev/hda3)

12) Removed the Linux boot floppy, rebooted to DOS, and then wrote 
a small DOS batch file, basically just:
    LOADLIN vmlinuz -v root=/dev/hda3

13) Put the new HDD in the Toshiba, ran the batchfile - and it successfully 
loaded RedHat 6.1 :-)

14) Shut down again; then spent some time drilling new mounting holes 
in the Toshiba's HDD cradle.  The old drive and the new drive have different 
screw locations.  Fortunately the electrical connectors are identical!


This setup works for my purposes.  Yours may vary, and I'm sure the above 
procedure can be improved upon.




cheers,
Fraser Farrell
