As for the ATA66 controller on the Asus board, as far as i know, you wont be
able to use it with the 2.2.xx series kernels.
I just saw in the linux-kernel mailing list that it is going to be supported
in the 2.4.0 kernel though.
So, for the mo youll have to put up with ATA33 until 2.4.0 is released,
unless your very game and want to try the 2.4.0-test kernels (latest is
2.4.0-test5-pre1).

&gt; Hi Leigh,
&gt;
&gt; You could try setting your sound card to es1371. I have the same or
&gt; similar card by the sound of it and mines a es1371. You could check out
&gt; the chipset physically on the card or if you have Win9x installed you
&gt; could also check there. The sound played by the sndconfig program is
&gt; always bad.

&gt; &gt; G'day folks,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm still coming to terms with how spectacular today's turnout
&gt; &gt; was - just a shame we couldn't get any TV coverage to "stick it
&gt; &gt; to bill" with :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I rolled my PC out around lunchtime and was blown away
&gt; &gt; by the quality and simplicity of the installation process.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It detected all my configured hardware (ATA33 drive and cdrom,
&gt; &gt; USB 3buton mouse, etc) and went off without a hitch.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Chose gnome/enlightenment as my window manager/environment and
&gt; &gt; subsequently grabbed and installed helixcode as recommended by
&gt; &gt; someone I stood next to for most of the day but can't remember
&gt; &gt; their name :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; (thanks for the help, by the way!)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now I've only got two niggling problems that I can't nut out
&gt; &gt; myself - not yet anyway - so any ideas / experience would be
&gt; &gt; great.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; System:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PIII/700E (100FSB) 128M (PC133) 20Gb UDMA IDE & USB rat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My sound card, a CreativeLabs PCI128 3D blaster, pci probes
&gt; &gt; as an es1370 - fair and reasonable considering that is the
&gt; &gt; chipset used by Creative for this card.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, sound functions don't work properly.  I get jittering
&gt; &gt; sounds from all attempts to play any sound.  esd seems to be
&gt; &gt; involved somehow, both within X and without (eg: using play/or
&gt; &gt; mpg123).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The sound test from the snd configuratoin cmd line tool does
&gt; &gt; play (albeit extremely soft and almost entirely unintelligbly,
&gt; &gt; distorted beyond recognition).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; At first we thought (thanks to Alex's guidance) that interrupts
&gt; &gt; were an issue - /proc/interrupts was showing es1370 sharing the
&gt; &gt; interrupt with ide1 (cdrom controller).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've since disabled the cdrom, network card, and parallel port
&gt; &gt; and now the es1370 has its own interrupt (just for testing).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I get the same audio results.  Jitter, distorted
&gt; &gt; snd test, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... card works just peachy in win98.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; SECOND question (not a problem yet, until I get stuck *smirk*:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is the ASUS CUBX ATA66 controller supported?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I booted OK using ATA66, but found no driver support for the
&gt; &gt; controller in the default kernel...so it couldn't find / to
&gt; &gt; mount - I'm about to check out the src tree :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, any help appreciated!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Cheers
&gt; &gt;
