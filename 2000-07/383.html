Hi all, 

A couple of weeks ago I mentioned Evolution, the GNOME groupware-type thingy. 
It's now even more stable - the 0.2 version is released!  Now it'd be only
extremely buggy :-)  See attached announcement:

Shar and Destroy!

Michael...

&lt;&lt; Attached email &gt;&gt;

 Our tireless team of dancing primates has assembled version 0.2 of the
 Evolution groupware suite (codename "Saccharomyces").
 
 Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
 This release incorporates many new features and bug fixes since the 
 previous version.
 
 * Availability:
 
   You can get the Evolution 0.2 tarball here:
 
         <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution</A>
 
   Evolution also requires a new version of GtkHTML (0.5), Bonobo
   (0.15), GNOME Print (0.20), OAF (0.5) and ORBit (0.5.2).  These
   packages are available from:
 
         <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources</A>
         <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources</A>
 
 * Changes in this version:
 
         Shell:
         
           * Folder selection dialog (Ettore).
         
           * Folder creation dialog (Ettore).
         
         Addressbook:
         
           * LDAP server configuration dialog (Chris Toshok).
           
           * Integration of LDAP servers in the shell's tree view
             (Chris Toshok).
           
           * ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
         grated with the message
             composer (Chris Lahey).
           
           * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
         
         
         Calendar:
         
           * Printing support (Michael, Federico).
           
           * Many, many behavior fixes and polishing to the
             day/week/month view widgets (Damon).
           
           * New glade-based event editor.  This is unfinished but
             usable (Seth, Federico).
           
           * Mouse wheel scrolling support (Anders).
           * We have an awesome new engine for computing recurring
             events (Damon).  This will be plugged in to the new
             iCalendar code.
           
           * Internal and public API fixes (Federico, Seth).
           
           * Shell-related changes (Ettore).
           
           * Data model for ETable; this is not used yet (Federico).
           
           * New iCalendar support; this is not used yet (Federico).
           
           * Pi        Mailer:
         
           Major features:
         
           * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)
         
           * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)
         
           * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by
             Dan)
         
           Smaller features:
         
           * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)
         
           * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5
             lines of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)
         
           * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
             multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)
         
           * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the
             envelope icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).
         
           * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).
         
           * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder
             selection UI (Michael)
         
           * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and
             make the filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work
             with to or cc.  (Dan)
         
           * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and
             jumps to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to
             next/previous unread message. (Dan)
         
           * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it
             correct or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the
             user exits (or chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)
         
           * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
             neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)
         
           * Use the gnome-vfs "sniff buffer" interface to try to
             identify the MIME type of attachments without useful type
             information (Dan)
         
           * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)
         
           * Added "Received date" header to the set of possible
             message list headers. (Dan)
         
           * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)
         
           Bug fixes:
         
           * Message read/unread/deleted flags should now be saved
             reliably when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt
             when a rebuild isn't needed. Expunging should work
             reliably (Dan, Ettore, Jeff).
         
           * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).
         
           * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages
             over POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP
             bugs. (Dan)
         
           * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get
             dropped and small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)
         
           * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to
             correctly match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)
         
           * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
             Ettore)
         
           * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid
             corrupting the display). Make "get mail" always put
             unfiltered mail into Inbox rather than the current
             folder. (Dan)
         
           * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to
             subjects that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a
             default subject to forwarded messages. (Dan)
         
           * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
             directory it was in. (Dan)
         
           * Code to parse invalid date formats since some mailers
             generate them... (Jeff)
         
           * Fixed various small SMTP bugs (Jeff, Chris Lahey)
         
           * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)
         
           * Make replies use the text/plain part of a
             multipart/alternative if the user configured plain text
             rather than HTML mail sending.  (Dan)
         
           * Various config dialog fixes (Jeff)
         
           * Partial filter/vfolder GUI facelift (Jacob)
 
 Please note that this is still software in development and should not
 be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors;
 you'll be in our hearts forever, but please remember that Evolution
 will still be buggy, incomplete, and temperamental.
 
 Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.
 
 (And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))
 
 Enjoy,
 
   The Evolution team
