&gt; &gt; Another questiontaht might be asked is if a pipe is really needed, it is

&gt; 
&gt; It's in no way a text line paradigm.  A pipe is a mechanism used to
&gt; construct complex systems from a number of simple components.  The fact
&gt; that pipes can often be conveniently expressed in a command line is beside
&gt; the point.
&gt; 
&gt; A pipe provides a huge degree of efficiency.  It's equivalent to using
&gt; temporary files for each stage of the pipeline, but without the temporary
&gt; file, and permitting each stage to run concurrently.

Are you talking about implementation here?

I am talking about visuialising the same funciotnality (ie gettign the
output of some thing and making it the input ot another)of a unix pipe, ie
its representation, the way people think about it - or would think about
it in a gui.

I dont state that it is not needed, I merely ask is it needed, is it
possible htere might be a more appropirat or natural way to think about
that fucntionality.

But assuming you assertaion is correct and a pipe is not a text prardigm,
then there is no reason why you can't have pipes in non text interfaces.

Here I agree wth you but I am trying to say that for the purposes of a non
text interface, then a pipe mightbe better though of as somehtign else,
have a different association for the purposes of visulising andf
representign its functionality.

 &gt; 
&gt; &gt; So i think the expressivness ios the same, the representationof soem data
&gt; &gt; is different, eg a picture for fiel type, but the info is sitll there and
&gt; &gt; still asscessable, as is the 26*fielnamelength exprerssivness of textual
&gt; &gt; names
&gt; 
&gt; You've conveniently ignored all of the other conventional uses for icons,
&gt; such as the "print" icon, and the "open" icon, and the "draw table" icon.
&gt; If icons were used for nothing more than expressing the type of a file then
&gt; they would be as good as, or probably superior to, text.  But icons are
&gt; also used to construct sequences of operations, and it's ludicrous to
&gt; expect anybody to be able to use what would need to be an infinite array of
&gt; unique pictures.  Infinity: that's how many different types of operations
&gt; people need to be able to express.


Not so much as ignored, as not mentioned in the interst of brevity.
I mentioned what I think is their most commonuse in user interfaces.

There is no reason why you can not have an icon for all required 
operations - i ttake no more imagination than coming up with a
unique sequnece of characters to represent the operation.

After all your set of commands are finite, the possible legal sequences
you put them together in is large but also finite.

You can put a N long string of X textual tokens in Z combiniations.
You can put a N long series of X icons in Z combinations.

Whatis the diifference if the thing you look at are words or pirctures(or
picture sof words), the importatn thing is you can rell one discreet
entity from another and that you can sequence them in a certain number of
ways.

How you sequence them, whether by drag and drop, cut and paste ot type
them in doesn't really matter.

A word for a command or an icon it does not matter, both are abstractions.

There is nothing that says an icon has to be an image anyway.
It can simply be the text it represents if you want it to.
There is no reason why you cant drag words around a work area of some sort
and join them toghether, or why you cant combine bioth words and icons.

Is there?

A letter from the alpha bet is arguably an icon itself, that happes to
belong to a special class of icons called "letters" or "the alphabet".

&gt; 
&gt; This message, from my mind to your mind, is made possible by the beauty and
&gt; simplicity of "command lines."  Feel free to translate it to icons.  I'm
&gt; willing to bet you cannot do it; and it's the same problem faced trying to
&gt; devise a generalised iconic interface to replace computer command lines.
&gt; 

Well words are to my mind as stated above a from of icon.
But for the more conventionally mionded, how about chinses pictograms or
japanese, are there words not pictures?

Do you think you coudl not express what you have siaid in your meial in
those icons - assuming you knew how to read and write japanses or chinses 
- that is to say assuming you associted the icons with what everyone else 
who uses them associates them with?
