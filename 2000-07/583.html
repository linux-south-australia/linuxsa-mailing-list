&gt;&gt; I have been reviewing the sendmail config at one customer site recently to
&gt;&gt; make it simpler and more maintainable ...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We have what is a standard config in this situation:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   [Big Bad Internet]----[Firewall]-----[Internal Mail Server]
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All mail is received on the firewall and relayed to the Internal Mail
Server.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; All internal addresses are from one of the Private IP domains. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; When I set this up four years ago, I had to hack the sendmail config file
&gt;&gt; to defeat DNS name lookups on the internal mail server name so the IP
&gt;&gt; address could be looked up in the hosts file. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The ways to handle this these days is to use the LOCAL_RULES stuff in your
&gt;&gt; sendmail.mc file, or to use split DNS.  
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; However, both of these are quite complicated, and it seemed to me that
&gt;&gt; there is a need for a FEATURE, perhaps called internal_mail_hub that allows
&gt;&gt; people who are trying to set this sort of system up to do so easily.

Boy, if only I knew this stuff four years ago ... :-(

&gt;It's actually already pretty simple with existing sendmail-cf
&gt;FEATUREs. This is all straight from www.sendmail.org BTW.

Well, you do have to do some digging to get to it :-)

&gt;Use the standard /usr/lib/sendmail-cf/cf/redhat.mc file and comment
&gt;out the recomended line. Compile and use.
&gt;
&gt;Allow RELAY access to the necessary machines in /etc/mail/access
&gt;
&gt;	localhost.localdomain           RELAY
&gt;	localhost                       RELAY
&gt;	127.0.0.1                       RELAY
&gt;	192.168.0.1                     RELAY
&gt;	example.com                     RELAY
&gt;
&gt;Where 192.168.0.1 is the IP address of your internal mail server, and
&gt;example.com is the domain name to receive mail for.
&gt;
&gt;Now do the forwarding bit in /etc/mail/mailertable
&gt;
&gt;	example.com                    smtp:[192.168.0.1]

Now, the important thing here are the square brackets as they stop sendmail
from using DNS and MX records for looking up the address.

However, I think that this is more complex than it need be (the admin has
to set up a mailertable etc).

But, having had a look at the sendmail.cf file (which I can read, damn, I
think I need a career change :-), it does do all I would want, in that the
rules to handle delivery to names defined in sendmail.cw are handled before
the mailertable lookup is done, so one can set things up to allow mail to a
small number of accounts on the firewall, like root, while handling all
other addresses via the internal mail gateway.

Well, Alex, you are not just a pretty face :-) I guess I get to find out on
Saturday if you are even a pretty face?
