&gt; The way I read the above is that in the event that someone in the

&gt; example for a broken leg sustained somehow in relation to activities to
&gt; do with Linux somewhere in Adelaide and not covered by some other public
&gt; liability, they can sue [various people associated with the list.]

In fact they can try to sue, and you would need to actually defend yourself.
Suppose my next door neighbour slipped at the shopping centre and decided to
sue me: I wouldn't actually need to defend myself, other than to front up at
court and say I have no liability.  Now suppose he came to a LinuxSA meeting
and slipped, and decided to sue the organisers of the meeting: I think he
would have a case.  The organisers couldn't just front up and say it had
nothing to do with them, because obviously they would have had something to
do with it.


&gt; (I'm not part of any organisation known as "LinuxSA" and won't ever be)

Interesting parenthetical comment.  You just said that if we incoporate you
wouldn't become a member.  Do cou care to elaborate on that?
