&gt;&gt; You wag, you!  I'm always extolling the virtues of man pages.  What I criticise

&gt;&gt; half-assed texinfo.

Whole heartedly agree with David here.

&gt; This pisses me off greatly. For one, what has changed in cat, and two,
&gt; man pages should never get smaller. Yeah, there are example of some
&gt; (PAM) that suck badly, and others (fetchmail) that are excellent.

I think fetchmail as a whole (the documentation, design, etc.) is a
stellar example of what Open Source is capable of, and an excellent
touchstone to aspire to.

&gt; Others (bash) fall somewhere inbetween.

Writing good doco is hard (well, hard for me, and to look at the state
of the art, hard for others too).  One of the emails I regret most
losing (hard disk crash long, long ago) was from Fred Butzen, who
authored the Coherent man pages (and his since written some Linux
books), and actually gave me some tech writer tips (which I never
had the chance of committing to memory).  He had written the man
pages from scratch, and were that good that I knew of people who
bought Coherent just for the documentation alone.

&gt; P.S. whats a "wag"?

You lived in Australia for how long?  No wonder you were deported :-P

A "jolly japster".
