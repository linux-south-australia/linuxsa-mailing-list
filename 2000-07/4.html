Hi,
Just to add my 2c worth.

You need to be careful with some network cards and switches/hubs.
I have seen many times, auto sensing cards cause many errors on networks,
especially at high load.

The network card if set to auto negotiate can try to renegotiate if there
are networking issues. i.e. high network traffic, etc.. If this happens then
this can often make the problem worse.

Full duplex can have many problems with Intel Chipset Nic's and Cabletron
switches.
The same can happen with some Compaq hardware and Cisco Switches of a
particular IOS version.
Forcing 100Mb half duplex is usually recommended in these situations.


I have seen hundreds of hours spent determining the best packet size that
should be used to optimise certain traffic efficiencies across a network.
This involves making all devices work at the same rate and packet size
chosen for the bulk of the traffic sent across the network. (lots of
statistics and stuff)
In particular with Web traffic you may see many requests of many different
sizes to build a single page.
This taken into account within the network when setting up switches and
servers can increase the efficiency of the packets enormously whilst
transversing your network.

End of the day if the efficiency of the data flow across you network is
optimised for the bulk of you traffic type, then when things go wrong the
effect is minimal on the overall system.

Just a note on NIC's, many of the new NIC's and drivers can be set-up in
pairs or quads.
They can fail over on link, or be used in an aggregated state into the same
switch or switch mesh.
This is especially good for redundancy. i.e. cable faults, or NIC failure.
A single IP and Mac address is often used to prevent switches running
spanning tree from getting to confused.
(they still can but not as badly if done right.)
This is often used with backup servers where high throughput is needed to
ensure short backups cycles to many machines.

Well I think that was about 2cents..


Derek

 &gt; 1.	Is there a problem with using dual speed NICs on a network.

Nope, none at all.  You'll get better performance, of course, if you
run everything at 100 Mbps;  The effect of running even a single host
at 10 Mbps is bigger than you'd think, because frames take ten times
as long to transmit at 10 Mbps, so 100 Mbps hosts end up waiting for
slow and cumbersome 10 Mbps hosts to transmit when the 10 Mbps hosts
try to get serious about throughput.

 &gt; 2.	All boxes are dual booting.  Sorry, but I have to use the evil empire
 &gt; occasionally.  For reasons of cost, I would like to be able to mix and
 &gt; match the Windows and Linux boxes as the need takes me.  The router will
 &gt; stay in Linux.  Is this feasible?

Of course.  TCP/IP doesn't care about what OS you run.

 &gt; 3.	Is is possible for a box to be both a client and a server to any other
 &gt; box in NFS.

Yup.

 &gt; I understand NFS and Samba can happily co-exist.

Yes.  In many companies (for instance, the one I work for), NFS, AppleTalk
and SMB are all shared from the same physical filesystem, on UNIX boxen
running NFS services, netatalk and Samba.  We use FreeBSD, but exactly the
same software works just as well on Linux.
