Hi Jim,

There was some stuff on SANS org called bastille. It was aimed at RH don't
know if that helps. But I installed but my connection is dialup with
dynamic ip addies.

Evan


&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;It would appear that someone has been poking around one of my machines.  I
&gt;know this because my postmaster address received a bounce message from
&gt;someone I don't know, which was relayed though my machine.  The disturbing
&gt;thing about the content of the email was that it seemed to be a reply to a
&gt;previous message telling this person about something that was meant to be on
&gt;my machine (not sure what it was, but the sender indicated that they were
&gt;having trouble getting their browser to see it (the machine doesn't' run a
&gt;httpd at all so I'm not surprised)).  
&gt;
&gt;Having had a close look at /var/log/messages it would seem that I'm the only
&gt;person who's logged into this machine recently (and all such logins came
&gt;from one of my other machines, at times when I was most likely to be using
&gt;those machines.  i.e.. I can account for all the logins to my account as
&gt;being me).  All root logins were immediately preceded by a login by my user,
&gt;so they were likely to be me su'ing to root.  I've checked /etc/passwd and
&gt;there are no unusual user accounts on the machine.  So it would appear that
&gt;whoever is using the box hasn't been able to telnet into it at all.
&gt;/var/log/secure doesn't show any unusual connections either.
&gt;
&gt;Is there any other log files I should check?  Are there any good Linux
&gt;security references/sites that I should refer to to try and increase
&gt;security on the machine?
&gt;
&gt;Jim.
