&gt; &gt; &gt; I have bind 8.2.2_P5-9 installed at a site and am trying to set
&gt; &gt; &gt; up a split DNS, but am having real problems getting the
&gt; &gt; &gt; forwarders statement to work.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When you say split, are you referring to the split of resolver and
&gt; &gt; server?
&gt; 
&gt; No, having a separate internal and external DNS ...

Yes, but which functions of DNS are you trying to move around. You
have the "name server" and the "resolver server (library)". All
'forwarders' does, is queries the listed server for the DNS resolution
and the queried server does the whole "get the . domain server, get
the .au domain server, get the .com.au. domain server" thing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone had this working?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yup. What else is in your named.conf file?
&gt; 
&gt; Well, a few things. A couple of zone declarations, with the names of
&gt; the zone files for the internal zones. A zone for "." with the usual
&gt; stuff and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; The man page suggests that I override forwarding for internal zones,
&gt; but I could not make sense of it.

When you say 'internal zones', are you meaning the zones that you host
that map to say 192.168 addresses, or do you mean "your zones", and
therefore "external zones" means "all other zones on the net".

&gt; I am trying to forward to the external DNS at the moment, but
&gt; external names just do not get forwarded and named comes back very
&gt; quickly saying not found.

Forwarders is just a way of cutting down DNS traffic. When you have a
whole bunch of 'dumb' machines (like windows) on a network with no
resolver daemon (named), they all have to query a name server to do
the resolving for them. If you keep that server locally then your DNS
requests do not exit your netwok to be resolved. They get resolved
locally by the DNS server that sends the port 53 packets out itself,
then caches the result thus building up a rich cache. If your network
comprises 'smart' machines like linux and other Unices, they often
have their own resolver daemon (named), in which case each mahine has
to resolve the DNS resquest themselves. If you forward all requests to
a central DNS server, it builds the rich cache not each UNIX box.

This of course, has nothing to do with any domains you may be hosting
on your DNS server.

One trick I use to keep traffic to any low bandwidth networks to a
minimum, but still host my own DNS is this:

You setup a primary DNS server for the domain and two secondary DNS
servers. The primary is in your local network and the secondaries are,
for example, Telstra and NetCraft, both very well connected DNS
servers. You setup the zone file on the primary DNS server listing the
two secondary DNS servers as the only servers...

	IN	A	ns.telstra.net
	IN	A	ns1.netcraft.com.au

Set these two secondary servers up to get zone transfers from your
local machine, then the only outside DNS traffic that you will see on
your netork is those two servers updating their DNS data with a
zone-xfer from your primary.

The added advantage is that if your link goes down, you DNS still
resolves, so that mail will still come through when you come back up.

Got a bit off the original issue there, but this should be very useful
for anyone hosting a domain on a server with only a ppp modem link to
the 'net.

Cheers

Alex!
