Sorry to get into this discussion late, but this point is relatively
important:


The "for" loop mechanism _is_ a pain, and quotes often make no
difference.  It _will_ pull the argument apart into words separated by
characters from the environment variable "$IFS".

&gt; &gt; ahh -- but what if you want to do something more complex, such as

&gt; 
&gt; OK, I had suggested 'for f in *' rather than 'for f in `ls`'.
&gt; 
&gt; If you need to use find, and I can agree that there will be times when you
&gt; want to, then you might want to add a -fprintf {} format or whatever to
&gt; your find command and put quoted around the names.

Try this...

    for f in $(echo '"this contains whitespace and" "this" "does not"') ; do
        echo $f
    done

Surprisingly you will get

    "this
    contains
    whitespace
    and"
    "this"
    "does
    not"

So, using the "-fprintf" option in "find" will not help one whit.
Ignoring for the moment the problem of newlines, you can get around a
fair bit of this by restricting yourself to line by line operations such
as "sed" and "grep".  Eventually you will have to resort to a gruesome
hack involving the shell command "read".  Even then the problem of
newlines still looms.


One promising solution might be to change the value of IFS, so that it
does not look for whitespace but some other separator.  Then "-fprintf"
would help.  But what other ASCII character is illegal in file names?


Any other thoughts, that still use the shell ;-)
