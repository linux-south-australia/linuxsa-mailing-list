YIKES

This is all so silly. I still run two very successful international
mailing lists about linux & c and linux & c++. I  decided, unilaterally,
to add [LCP] and [LCPP] to the subject header. I had some people
complain to me about, but I had more people support me because of it.

I guess, what I'm saying is that it is up to the list owner to actually
initiate this change. In my case, if I were the list owner, I would add
the offending lines [LSA] perhaps and tell those who didn't like it to
go play with the Phantom of the Opera's barrells of gun
powder...preferably with a lit match.

Obviously, the owners - or at least one of the list owner's spokes
people - has said "no". That's not a major drama either. Either accept
it or silently gather the numbers to change it. 

Besides, if one is at WORK, how does one find time to read the LinuxSA
mailing list?
