&gt; I on his behalf have a couple of questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. is there a choice of distro which will be installed (ie RH 
&gt; 6.1/6.2 corel
&gt; debina etc)

yes -- we will definitely have RH 6.2 (no reason to have 6.1), TurboLinux
6.0, Debian 2.1 and/or 2.2, Corel 1.0, FreeBSD 4.0, Storm 1.0, and others...
If we don't have it, we should be able to get it...

&gt; 2. will there open source s/w include star office?

yes... SO will be there, but we won't have CDs...

&gt; 3. also he is heavily into mp3's and has a TV tuner card of 
&gt; some sort as
&gt; well as a voodoo2 banshee, so will there be s/w available for 
&gt; mp3 playing?

MP3 s/w will be available.

&gt; Does the TV tuner card present anyform of problem? He likes 

no problem, unless he wants to use it. It should work, but it really depends
if someone has written a driver for it... If you do some searching, you can
know in advance, otherwise, we'll see what 50 geeks can acheive on the day
:)

&gt; his games too
&gt; (ie half life and quake3) are these games likely to be 
&gt; addressed as part of
&gt; the installs?

I see no reason why we can't attempt to install free versions of things, but
for obvious reasons, we won't be installing anything illegal :)

He or you may wish to look into how well supported the Banshee is under X
with OpenGL... That will have a large effect on gaming performance...
