<H1>Performance with Raid 0 using IDE drives</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I have just set up 2 "WD 15G 7200 RPM 9.6mS 2M cache" drives on Mandrake
7.0 with RAID 0.

I am experimenting to find the maximum performance I can get out of my
Linux Box using IDE drives.
In the HowTo they say 1 drive per controller. Does this mean active
drives?
i.e. if I have another IDE drive as slave in primary controller, but it
is
not used in the RAID array then will it effect performance. (The drive
is a Maxtor 6G that
contains windows stuff so isn't used under Linux except when I want to
refer
to Windows created documents).

What about the CDROM drive which is slave on the secondary controller?


[<A HREF="mailto:abraund@localhost">abraund@localhost</A> abraund]$ cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid0]
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md0 : active raid0 hdc6[1] hda8[0] 16376320 blocks 64k chunks
unused devices: &lt;none&gt;
[<A HREF="mailto:abraund@localhost">abraund@localhost</A> abraund]$


Booted to init 3 and had a go with hdparm, Initially hda and hdc were
set as follows;

[<A HREF="mailto:root@localhost">root@localhost</A> abraund]# hdparm -vi /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1870/255/63, sectors = 30043440, start = 0

with hdc the same except for geometry;
geometry     = 29805/16/63, sectors = 30043440, start = 0
I not sure how this came about, I set up the dives during installation
of Mandrake and thought I did everything the same. Is this important?

Initially hda and hdc were reporting 80/3.8 MB/s transfer (hdparm -Tt
/dev/hda ) and /dev/md0 gave 88.9/3.98.

Then experimented;
-d1 gave bad CRC
-m16 gave /dev/hda 80/4.15
-m16 -c1 gave /dev/hda 80/7.09 and /dev/md0 gave 89/7.92

I couldn't find anything else I could change so now I think the best I
can do is -m16 -c1

What about -W Disable/enable  the  IDE  drive's  write-caching feature
(usually OFF by default)

The drive is now;
dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  1 (32 bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 1870/255/63, sectors = 30043440, start = 0

Why am I only getting 7.92 for my RAID0 drive as the HowTo says you
should expect N*P
i.e. md0 should be 2x performance of hda

Any hints?

Thanks in advance
Andrew Braund
