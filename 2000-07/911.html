I agree..  It is too easy to point someone to manuals and How-To's, etc.  I 
often resort to IRC and lists after reading the manuals or because it is 
much easier.  I work on a help desk which holds 'docco' to be paramount, yet 
human nature means we more often stick our heads over our cubicles and ask 
our co-workers.  Besides, it builds a 'community' which I would like to 
encourage as something FUNDAMENTAL to Linux.  This is what attracted me to 
Linux above, is the community that I find no where else.

Being a newbie myself (although a fairly experienced one now) who started 
from scratch all on his lonesome, I am happy to re-translate documentation 
in accessible, non esoterical ways, to make it short and sweet for the 
newbie.

I think something just as important as a FAQ, command list or how-to, is a 
GLOSSARY.  I don't mind writing one up that is as non-technical as possible, 
an entry level glossary.

&gt;Hi everybody :)
&gt;
&gt;Just a reminder that this list is about to be *inundated* with newbie-style
&gt;requests. Those of us who have been around for a long time will be well
&gt;advised to take care with how we respond to their requests. Note that there
&gt;is nothing wrong with "RTFM", as long as the "TFM" to "R" is specified in
&gt;the email, and if the manual is actually fine :). Of course, if someone
&gt;claims to have read the manual, "RTFM <A HREF="http://the.manual/">http://the.manual/</A>" isn't going to
&gt;help them much -- try to give them help in interpreting and using the
&gt;manual... point them to the specific part of the manual, and walk them
&gt;through it. It would also be a Good Idea(tm) to go easy on the religious
&gt;wars and flames for a while, simply so as not to intimidate newbies.
