&gt; Another questiontaht might be asked is if a pipe is really needed, it is

It's in no way a text line paradigm.  A pipe is a mechanism used to
construct complex systems from a number of simple components.  The fact
that pipes can often be conveniently expressed in a command line is beside
the point.

A pipe provides a huge degree of efficiency.  It's equivalent to using
temporary files for each stage of the pipeline, but without the temporary
file, and permitting each stage to run concurrently.


&gt; So i think the expressivness ios the same, the representationof soem data
&gt; is different, eg a picture for fiel type, but the info is sitll there and
&gt; still asscessable, as is the 26*fielnamelength exprerssivness of textual
&gt; names

You've conveniently ignored all of the other conventional uses for icons,
such as the "print" icon, and the "open" icon, and the "draw table" icon.
If icons were used for nothing more than expressing the type of a file then
they would be as good as, or probably superior to, text.  But icons are
also used to construct sequences of operations, and it's ludicrous to
expect anybody to be able to use what would need to be an infinite array of
unique pictures.  Infinity: that's how many different types of operations
people need to be able to express.

This message, from my mind to your mind, is made possible by the beauty and
simplicity of "command lines."  Feel free to translate it to icons.  I'm
willing to bet you cannot do it; and it's the same problem faced trying to
devise a generalised iconic interface to replace computer command lines.
