No answers sorry, but I installed 15 machines in one night off of my laptop
and it all worked fine. They were RH6.2. 

I have also installed Mandrake 7.1 the same way, and no corruption either.

&gt;Last night I was testing the ability to do Linux NFS image installs for no
real
&gt;reason 'cept the upcoming installfest :-) and I ended up getting the worst
hard
&gt;disk corruption I have ever seen.
&gt;
&gt;First, my setup:  a Cyrix 686 120Mhz box with 64M Ram, PCI thin ethernet
card,
&gt;dual IDE controller.  hda is a 6G disk mounted as /home.  hdb is a 1.2G disk
&gt;mounted as /.  hdc is a finicky local 50x CDROM.
&gt;
&gt;I mounted the Red Hat distro from hdc as /mnt/cdrom.  I exported it via
NFS with
&gt;/mnt/cdrom (ro,insecure) in /etc/exports and kicked the appropriate daemons.
&gt;
&gt;So across my thin coax line I did an NFS install which worked nicely albeit
&gt;slowly.
&gt;
&gt;During the install I could see the hard disk light on the server whirl away. 
&gt;This is strange thinks me, what the server is doing is lifting data from
hdc on
&gt;one IDE channel, hand balling it to the PCI ethernet card for the network.
 Why
&gt;is the hard disk whirling?  Hmmm.  Just ignored it.  The CDROM, hard drive
light
&gt;and the LEDs on the ethernet card were all in sync.   Hmmm.
&gt;
&gt;Well the install finished and the hard disk light on the server stayed lit. 
&gt;Hmmm.  Looking back at the console I see my X desktop has frozen.  Hmmm. 
&gt;Switching to a virtual console sees IDE0 timeouts, but I can't log in.
Hmmm. 
&gt;Time for power cycle.  (I guess I could have rebooted the newly installed box
&gt;and tried telneting in, but I if login from virtual terminal didn't work I
&gt;didn't think telnet would either)
&gt;
&gt;So I power cycle.  hdb on the server needed fscking, but was painless.  hda
&gt;failed the powerup fsck and needed more attention.  Dropping into single
user I
&gt;really fscked it.  There were only a couple of THOUSAND errors spread
throughout
&gt;the drive.  Home directories, /home/local (sym link on /usr/local) all
stuffed
&gt;etc.
&gt;
&gt;So, finally, my question, how could NFS-exporting my CDROM on hdc (IDE1)
cause
&gt;timeouts on IDE0, cause the machine to lock up AND corrupt the /home (hda on
&gt;IDE0) filesystem which would have been really quiet at the time?
&gt;
&gt;Huh?
&gt;
