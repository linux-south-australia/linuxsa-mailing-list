I got the latest rpm tonight. While it's much nicer than Netscape 4.x
for a lot of stuff, and I have been using it quite a bit, it appears
to lack:
 - Javascript (well, some sites with lots of javascript and layers don't
   seem to work)
 - Java (no surprise there)
 - Any right-click functionality, which I use *all the time*
 - Keyboard navigation, no up/down/pg up/pgdown/space.
 - SSL
 - Error messages, like asking for authentication.

I like it, and hope it develops quickly, because I currently *don't*
have the ram to run mozilla with any kind of speed, although it's been
getting better.

I saw an interesting comment on why Netscape went with the whole XUL
interface/platform thing tonight, too. The webstandards people 
( <A HREF="http://www.webstandards.org/">http://www.webstandards.org/</A> ) recently gave Netscape a blast for
not releasing their browser quick enough, a stance which completely
contradicts just about every earlier statement they've made about
"release now" verses "release when compliant". Someone pointed out 
that even with a fast, compliant browser, Netscape still couldn't 
compete with a browser which was on every desktop. The reasoning
then went on to suggest that they had to come up with something
bigger. Possibly to compete with ActiveX without the speed hits that
Java gives?

Comments?
