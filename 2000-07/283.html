&gt; &gt; I have an ATX motherboard that's meant to be capable of powering down
&gt; &gt; via software.  When I click "Start / Shutdown" etc in windows, the
&gt; &gt; machine turns off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Linux used to do the same - but for some time..  I have a feeling since
&gt; &gt; 6.0..  it's not done it.  Instead of powering off after doing a
&gt; &gt; `shutdown -h now`, it prints screens and screens of debugging-type info,
&gt; &gt; which I've never really read, because if I'm shutdown -h'ing, it's
&gt; &gt; because I've finished computering for the day/night/morning/?.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Question is simply - Anyone else have the same problem?  Or is it just
&gt; &gt; me :)
&gt; 
&gt; If the error is what I think it is, Tom Dunstan has had the same message
&gt; (not wanting to dob him in or anything). I can't remember if we worked
&gt; out what was causing it to die. It does, however, shutdown properly
&gt; anyway.

Yes, and I still do. It's after linux brings up something about md
devices
or something... I haven't paid that much attention. I just assumed that
it was trying to switch my AT motherboard off ATX style, but if you're
having the same problem on an ATX mb, I'm not sure what it is. Probably
a kernel bug... for just about the first time ever, I've never
recompiled
the kernel on this installation, since everything I wanted was compiled
in
or could be loaded as a module. Probably getting the latest kernel would
fix it, brobably just recompiling would too. &lt;shrug&gt;

I've never cared about it, since the system is always safely shut down
before that point.

Tom
