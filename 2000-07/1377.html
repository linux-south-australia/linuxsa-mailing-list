Hi Adam,

I did this recently on my brothers computer. You need to make a dos boot disk 
and copy the 'ezsetup' software to it, reboot the computer and run the 
software.  Next you load Win9x and then Linux. There were no really important 
steps.

(If you're unsure or unable to get this going, contact me again and we can go 
through it or organize for you to bring your computer here I'm at Mitchell 
Park or else there is the next LinuxSA meeting.)

&gt; &gt; A comment from the back was *won't lilo overwrite the DDO* and this was

&gt; &gt; As my BIOS will only read a 2GB hard drive, and I have 8.4GB and *shame*
&gt; &gt; need the BIOS for win95, I have had to use loadlin to load the linux
&gt; &gt; kernel from a dos menu before win95 kicks in.
&gt;
&gt; Could someone briefly explain the procedure (or point me to a HOWTO) for
&gt; setting up Linux with DDO? My BIOS won't support drives over 8Gb, and I've
&gt; got a 10 and a 17Gb drive, and my linux is installed to a 4Gb drive that is
&gt; currently not in my system, but if I can get DDO and Linux to work
&gt; together, I'd be a lot happier.. at the moment the only way I was aware of
&gt; having Linux installed was to live with 2 8Gb partitions and not use the
&gt; full capacity of the drives.. However if I can use DDO & LILO together I'd
&gt; love to know how.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
