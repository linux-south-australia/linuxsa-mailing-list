Not that this is strictly on linux-technical issues, but....

&lt;bombast topic="Internet politics" subtopic="Australian history"&gt;

I think it goes much deeper than that.
Since the earliest colonial days, there have been two streams of
thought in Australia: the ex-convicts versus the free settlers.
If you read a lot of early history, you find that there were always
the licentious "live for the moment" people who were ex-convicts and
children of ex-convicts, who had the lowest possible respect for
nobility, church and the constraints of the law. 
And on the other hand were the more recently arrived free settlers,
who felt themselves much superior to the ex-convicts and their offspring.
To try to rid themselves of the "convict stain" of the "thief colony",
the newly arrived free settlers tried to increase religion and pass laws
to control conduct etc. to try to be as moral as possible - but mostly
to improve appearances and save face.

For the last 50 years or so, the Labor party has tapped into the
ex-convict strain in the Australian character, which is anti-class
and against arbitrary restrictions on behaviour, whereas the 
so-called `Liberal' party has tapped into the wowser strain in the
Australian character which originated in the free settlers and the
chagrin they felt when they saw how freely the earlier arrivals
behaved.

If you want to know why the Australian voters put up with oppression
in general, and censorship in particular, it is because the 50% of people
who are predominantly of the ex-convict strain feel guilt, and they feel
they need to be spanked from time to time. And when they can't take it
any more, they put in Labor to sooth them until they feel they
need another spanking.

I only mention this because otherwise you may try too hard to assign
a rational cause to voters' behaviour.

Now when you look at the general attack on the Internet by the
wowser free-settler holier-than-everybody party, you can see that
actually stopping naughty behaviour is not the point.
The main thing is to assuage the chagrin of the wowsers.
As long as the wowsers see that their party is doing _something_, they
feel much better, and as long as the ordinary mugs and mongrels can
get around the constraints easily, they feel that they have been
sufficiently spanked to be able to get on with their life without
guilt.

As the Russians used to say in the good old days of the cold war,
"They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work."
We could say "They pretend to censor us, and we pretend to be
censored." And everyone's happy. The pride of the wowsers is assuaged.
The guilt of the ordinary mugs is taken away.

The same thing applies to the ban on Internet gambling.
The govt pretends to do something about gambling by banning
Internet gambling, which no one really cares about, and let
the real gambling continue. The govt is "doing something" - if you
know what I mean.
If you look at all of the other forms of "sin" which have been banned
in recent times, you'll find the same pattern.

I'm sure the govt does not want to take away anyone's little sins -
because when you take away the little sins, the people rise up.
Gorbachev really curtailed vodka in a serious way.
As a result, there was a coup and the SU fell to pieces.
The Oz govt has wisely chosen to let the Oz voters slumber.

&lt;/bombast&gt;

========================================================
By the way, has anyone found anything new about the business
activity statement software for linux?
I sent off a fax.
There should be an answer soon....

Cheerio (as Felix used to say),
