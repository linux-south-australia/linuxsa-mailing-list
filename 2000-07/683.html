Hi there,
As I am sure that most of u impliment some sort of filtering to stop your
email servers from being used as a relay for spam, I was wondering what ppl
do to stop spam from getting to their users.

I tried stopping it through mailservers/clients that don't have a proper
reverse (which did have an effect), I found that there are quite a few
legitimate servers out there that don't have DNS set up properly, so I had
to scap that.
I have even implimented header syntax checks (again this stopped quite a
bit of spam), however this caused lots of mailing lists and users that use
Outlook (inc OE) to be rejected. errors in scripts on servers, with Outlook
when it sends a BCC it replaces the To: header with
&lt;Undisclosed-Recipient:;&gt; which is very naughty :) coz of the ';'.

So what do other admins do?

cya
Andrew
