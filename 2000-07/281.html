I don't know what the story with the Installfest list is, but it ain't
working, and I have my doubts about the liuxsa one also ... 

Posters are printed. I have plastered North Adelaide, Adelaide and Adelaide
Uni with them. I beleive Michael Davies is doing some Northern areas, and
Romana is doing "The Hills" (which part of "The Hills"? :)... We need
someone to do Flinders Uni, UniSA Campuses, Eastern Suburbs, Western
Suburbs, and Southern Suburbs. Call me on 0412 827 805 and I can arrange to
get some posters to you. Also, if you want to decorate your workplace,
please call me and get one or two... or download one of the bzip'd PDFs from
<A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~festinisers/">http://www.rebel.net.au/~festinisers/</A>, print it out in B&W or colour, and
plaster that about the place. 

Unfortunately, we were unable to get an ad in today's (Saturday) Advertiser,
due to lack of committed money. Hopefully we will get one in next week, on
the day... Is there a weekday computer section in the Advertiser?

I think we may score a mention on a few radio stations this weekend again,
thanks to Steve Goodridge...

Finally, to make this event work, we need to get people coming along, so
tell your friends, stick poseters up, and so on. we have 50 installees
registered, and I predict that if we all make an effort THIS WEEK, we should
easily top 100, and maybe hit 200...
