This is a reprint of a reprint and not my own work.

My friend is a rather old-fashioned lady, always quite delicate and 
elegant, expecially in her language. She and her husband were planning a 
week's vacation in Arizona; so she wrote to a travel trailer court 
(caravan park) and asked for a reservation.

She wanted to make sure the campground was fully equipped, but didn't 
quite know how to ask about the "toilet" facilities. She just couldn't 
bring herself to write the word "toilet" in her letter (this is 
apparently an American thing). After much deliberation, she finally came 
up with the old - fashioned term "bathroom commode". So, she started all 
over again, and referred to the bathroom commode merely as the B.C. 
"Does the campground have its own B.C."? is what she actually wrote.

Well, the court manager, Herman, wasn't old - fashioned at all and when 
he got the letter, he just couldn't figure out what the woman was 
talking about. That B.C. businedd really had him stumped.

After worrying about it for a while, he showed the letter to several 
campers, but they couldn't imagine what the lady meant either. So, he 
finally came to the conclusion that the lady must be asking about the 
location of the Baptist Church. He sat down and wrote the following reply:

Dear Madam;

I regret the delay in answering your letter, but now take pleasure of 
informing you that a B.C. is located 9 miles north of the campground and 
is capable of seating 250 people at one time. I admin, it is quite a 
distance away if you are in the habit of going regularly, but no doubt 
you will be pleased to know that a great number of people take their 
lunches along and make a day of it. They usually arrive early and stay late.

The last time my wife and I went was 6 years ago and it was so crouded 
we had to stand up the whole time we were there. It may interest you to 
know that right now there is a supper planned to raise money to buy more 
seats. They are going to hold it in the basement of the B.C. I would 
like to say it pains me very much not to be able to go more regularly, 
but it is surely no lack of desire on my part. As we grow older, it 
seems to be more of an effort, particularly in cold weather.

If you decide to come down to our campground, perhaps I could go with 
you the first time you go, sit with you, and introduce you to all the 
other folks.

Remember, this is a friendly community

Sincerely,
Herman
