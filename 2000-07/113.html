&gt; Does anyone know how to set the root directory for a user to /home so 
&gt; that when they type in "cd /" it takes them to their /home directory 
&gt; even though it appears to them that they are in the root???

It is possible, but it will not improve your security greatly unless the 
users only require one or two executables.  Run your daemons chroot and 
let your users have the run of the system.
 
After going to all of the trouble of creating a chroot environment for 
your users, you will either have a reasonably secure environment where 
the users can run one or two commands, or you will have a system with 
the same problems as before but less setuid binaries.

If you just want to improve security because you need local (from 
the network sense) untrusted users then dont chroot, either secure your 
system or provide a different method of access (ie follow Alex's advice).

PS:
Doing a chroot on login will restrict your users to any directory tree you 
wish.  In case you need proof that this is a hazardous and time 
consuming adventure, here is a list of some things to consider:

  Read the Chroot-Bind howto for a detailed view of chrooting:
    <A HREF="http://linux.senet.com.au/HOWTO/Chroot-BIND-HOWTO.html">http://linux.senet.com.au/HOWTO/Chroot-BIND-HOWTO.html</A>
  Make sure the binaries the users require are under the chroot tree, 
   including their shell.  If they need any set[ug]id binaries, 
   reconsider the trouble of chrooting against the diminished benefit it 
   will provide.
  Make sure the libraries required by the binaries are under the chroot tree,
   ldd &lt;executable&gt;   
   will tell you what shared libraries are required
  Have some way of forwarding syslogs from inside the chroot to outside, 
   for example holelogd, otherwise, you will not know what is happening
   inside the chroot hole.
  Mount their filesystem nodev and nosuid to make it harder to break out
   of chroot
  Patch your kernel with the OpenWall patch to protect chroot from the
   obvious (and some less obvious) ways of breaking out
  Create files in &lt;newroot&gt;/etc/ such as passwd and group to map uids and
   gids to users and groups for ls.  Do not include passwd hashes in the
   /etc/passwd.
  Anything that uses /etc/mtab or /proc/ (eg ps) will be broken unless you
   also provide these.
