&gt;&gt; Suppose you tried to put a mirrored (aka raid 0) set on a single IDE

&gt;&gt; it could even start on the second.  This would obviously reduce write
&gt;&gt; performance by 50%.

(and to explicitly answer the original submitter's real question, yes,
you can leave your unused other drive connected to the controller, as
long as it's really unused).

&gt; Agreed totally.  The big issue here is that IDE sucks donkeys' balls.
&gt; End of story :-)

Without a more thorough investigation of donkey's balls, I'd contest
that statement.

&gt; It has been "designed" (and I use that word lightly) as a
&gt; cheap-and-nasty lowest-common-denominator way of attaching a hard
&gt; disk to an ISA-bus PC, and subsequent versions have been bolted-on
&gt; to non-ISA systems by butchering that thing which passed for a
&gt; specification to make it even more perverse and arcane.  Why is it
&gt; that you can pick up any SCSI controller and expect it to work with
&gt; any SCSI drive, but the IDE interface "standard" is so ritually
&gt; buggered by so many vendors that every general purpose OS on the
&gt; market ships with basic features like IDE DMA turned off by default
&gt; because they can't be assumed to work at all?

Hmm.  Why don't you come out here and I'll give you a handful of SCSI
host adaptors to play around with.

  "SCSI isn't magic.  There are some very sound reasons why it is
  occasionally necessary to sacrifice a live goat to the SCSI chain".

&gt; Anyone who is serious about running a high performance server is
&gt; *strongly* recommended to use SCSI.  Ignore benchmarks which claim
&gt; a higher megabyte-per-second value for IDE drives; They're
&gt; meaningless, because usually servers are more interested in I/O
&gt; transactions per second,

No, they're meaningless because almost nobody does sequential I/O in
real-world applications.

&gt; not megabytes-per-second, and SCSI will always deliver more I/Os per
&gt; second than a comparable IDE drive because of innovations like
&gt; tagged command queueing, basic things which IDE can't hold a candle
&gt; to.

As I was reminded yesterday, parallel SCSI still sends out its
commands at 5 MB/s async.  ATA (previously known as IDE) connections
are simpler, so they don't need this backwards compatibility, and they
issue the commands at the (fixed) bus speed.

A lot of myths have grown up about the difference between SCSI and
ATA, and in perpetrating them many people have not noticed ATA
sneaking up behind them.  I've recently been looking at the
differences, and they're not nearly as big as you may think.  In
particular:

  When you're looking at multi-user systems, disk bandwidth is the
  number of bytes transferred per second.  You can get speeds like 20
  MB/s or 30 MB/s if you're transferring sequentially, but this just
  about mandates a single process, so the values are meaningless.  In
  real life, you position, you transfer, you repeat.  So the real
  throughput is dependent on the transfer rate, the average latency,
  and the average transfer size.

  Average latency is in the order of 7 ms.  Average transfer size is
  in the order of 8 kB, which means about 400 µs on a modern drive,
  whether ATA or SCSI.

  High-end SCSI drives can usually position about 1 ms, maybe 2 ms
  faster than ATA drives.  On the other hand, despite tagged queueing
  (which, BTW, modern ATA drives also support), the command setup is
  slower (look at the spec).  A few years back I looked at the
  behaviour of SCSI drives with a SCSI bus analyser and found that the
  setup time could exceed 1 ms.  I'm sure things are better now, but
  they're probably still slower than on an ATA bus.

  Clearly, the real-life transfer rate is much more dependent on the
  latency than the sequential transfer rate.  It's also dependent on
  the transfer size, but you don't get much option with that.

So what's the real disadvantage of ATA drives?  They're generally a
little slower in latency, and you really need a separate ATA
controller for each of them.  On the other hand, they're also cheaper,
and so are the controllers.  On the other hand, a good SCSI host
adaptor will cost more per drive than an ATA controller.

&gt; IDE drives will happily provide the illusion of better performance
&gt; on a single-user system, until you try to put "real" load through
&gt; them (the reason they look like they're giving better performance is
&gt; because it's rather difficult for a single user to put "real" load
&gt; through them during day-to-day activities).  As soon as you put an
&gt; IDE disk on a multi-user server, though, expect performance to drop
&gt; through the floor.

Would you like to measure that?  Run some device benchmarks against
both SCSI and ATA and compare the results?  Here are the results of
running rawio against the fastest ATA and SCSI drives on my test
machine:

           Random read  Sequential read    Random write Sequential write
ID          K/sec  /sec    K/sec  /sec     K/sec  /sec     K/sec  /sec
ata        1547.2    96   6696.7   409    1532.0    94    6184.4   377
scsi       1242.6    78   1236.3    75    1295.6    77    1310.6    80

Now admittedly I'm comparing 2 year old SCSI drives with modern ATA
drives, so this isn't fair.  But it doesn't exactly slam ATA.  You
presumably have modern SCSI drives available; how do they perform?

&gt; ... and let's not even mention the performance implications of swapping
&gt; on an IDE drive, shall we?  Thank you.

Why not?  Hopefully swap drives aren't maxed out, in which case the
latency isn't as much of an issue.
