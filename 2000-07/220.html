Jordan :o)

The problem doesn't sound softwarey - you've got a pretty standard sort
of configuration.

What I would suggest you do is (all political/oh&s/etc considerations
aside):

 - Take The Box from work to home
 - Plug The Box into YOUR monitor, keyboard, mouse, modem
 - Configure The Box to dial up to YOUR PERSONAL isp, which you know
   works
 - Dial The Box up to YOUR PERSONAL isp using your modem, your phone
   line, your electrical cabling etc etc
 - Run some test-type things, like pinging, and downloading files, and
   whatever you like
 - Note the $results.

if ($results == 'bad') {

  Obviously, The Box is to blame.  Whether it's the hardware or software
  is not possible to determine at this stage - you can figure that out ;p

} else {

  The Box is not to blame.  It must be the modem at work, the phone lines
  at work (what sort of phone lines are they?  Not digital or anything?),
  electrical interferance at work, or the general aura of Windows NT-
  trained bosses.

}

Course, you may have already tried all this - in which case, throw the
bloody old The Box away, spend a few dollars on a decent machine from Dell
or something, and install the latest patched version of RedHat Linux 6.2.

Also, like someone else said, when you're compiling software always run
the ./configure script if it's there *grin*   ------ that boils down to
RTFM (`less INSTALL` usually).


Good luck...  let us know how you go!
