&gt; Firstly, perhaps someone in the audience can enlighten us as to how the GPL

It doesn't. 

But the practices and intentions of most of those who create and use open
source create a kind of group awareness about how cooperation produces a
better result for everyone. It is a bit like rubbish on the streets; it is
against the law and nearly everyone understands the reason why, and not
many break the law. Some people do and many of those get away with it, but
on the whole we all have clean streets.

For certain applications the GPL works to give some amount of
encouragement to avoid (via implied intimidation, in a sense) of practices
involving taking open source technologies and using closed source
derivatives to compete with the open source versions. Whether or not the
GPL is legally bulletproof and whether or not it is the best model around
isn't my point. It does in fact act as an excellent deterrent and I know
this, because I see it in action regularly in my job. A company is
planning to take modifications they've paid for and hide them, then
realises that they are prohibted from doing so, and (on reflection)
realises that it wasn't relevant to their business goals anyway. So
whatever the content of the GPL if it works well then obviously it is a
good thing.

But there are other ways of achieving the same ends. Do you really think
that Apple loves the open source community from the bottom of its
commercial heart? And yet there are two contributors to the FreeBSD kernel
tree who do their work on company time as part of their jobs as senior
developers on Apple's flagship operating system. There's no GPL in
sight, but something makes them do it this way. Network Appliance use
FreeBSD and have modified it extensively without contributing back at all,
so there's no question that Apple could do the same with impunity. But
Apple decided to play within the unwritten rules.

There is no point in debating whether the BSD or GPL license works better
because there is a lot of very valuable software written under each (very
much more GPL than BSD I think the last survey said) and for the most part
that isn't going to change. There are many more lesser-used licenses too,
but so long as the total effect is more-or-less open source Linux will
continue to work the way it has done so far.
