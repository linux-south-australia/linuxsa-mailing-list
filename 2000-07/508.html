Hi,

&gt; "Caution: Changing the root account name or the root home directory location
&gt; may break some applications, administration scripts, or future installation
&gt; scripts. This is part of the price of security, more work on your part to
&gt; maintain a higher level of security. You must decide which is more
&gt; important, security or ease of management."
&gt; Ok here is my question(s) is there a LOT to be gained by doing this?
&gt; How badly is your system broken by the fact that "some" scripts and
&gt; application need to see the user name root w/ UID 0 ???

It depends in some respects upon the nature of the system, how it is
connected to the Internet, who is going to be using it, who is going to
be administering it (and how), and its intended purpose.

If this needs to be a secure machine, that is connected full time to the
internet, where lots of people will know about it, and in say a
school. It might be a good idea. Students sometimes still try to guess
passwords, and system security, by old means. Alot of people these days
are script kiddies, and this defence is useless against them.

If this is going to be a dial up home machine, or sitting in an office
behind a firewall, then this is much less necessary, as there are already
other defences in place.

Dificult to say without more info.

&gt; Is anyone on the list doing this?

Not me.

&gt; Last of all it was listed as a "certification objective" in the book so I
&gt; guess RH a teaching and testing this as a good/normal practice. Is it?

ummm.
