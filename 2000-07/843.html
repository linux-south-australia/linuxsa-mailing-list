&gt; I'm putting together an article covering our installfest and going to try
and
&gt; get published in Linux Journal or similar.  Do any of you have any
interesting
&gt; stories about what happened on the day, or during the organisation of the
event,
&gt; or perhaps some revelation that anyone else organising an istallfest
should
&gt; know?

in no particular order:

Story about Leigh Hart's PC already told :)

There's a story to be told about David Newall sleeping in and not making it
to InstallFest until almost 10am, when some of us had been there beavering
away since 7:30... I won't tell it though ;)

There's a few stories about people forgetting to bring keyboards and
monitors, and one about someone forgetting to take a monitor home (not
mentioning any names, Jeremy Ervine :)...

There's the one about the guy with the trestles and chairs who was supposed
to arrive at 7:30pm Friday, but was delayed until 8:30, then was lost for
around 45 minutes looking for us, while I made about ten phonecalls to
Directory Assistance and various other people, trying to chase down whoever
had organised them so I could find out the business name or phone number so
I could call the guy and find out where he was :)

Then there's me ordering everyone around, which I think is a story in
itself...

The guys at the back deciding that lack of trestle space and power outlets
wasn't going to stop them, and setting up their machines on chairs or the
floor, and all the daisy-chained powerboards that enabled them to do this :)

Of course, there's also the exotic, high-end, rare, odd and old hardware
that appeared. We had an SGI Indy, an Alpha workstation, numerous Sun
SPARCs, a dual PIII-550 with 512MB RAM and a 4x18Gb SCSI-160 RAID 5, Leigh
Hart's Mother of all cases on wheels, at least one Mac, a large flat-screen
LCD display, and a (surely) historically signifigant x86 (386?) Micro in an
enormous case, with 2MB RAM and 80MB Hard disk. My wild guestimate was that
we had well over $300,000 worth of hardware in attendance.

Of course, there's the Pizza lunch that didn't happen :) -- sorry about that
for those who were hanging out for it. I ended up with a cold Aussie Burger
(barf) and fries... Better than nothing, but of dubious nutritional value.

Also, today, when I returned the PCs to Hallmark, the staff there were quite
excited to have five computers installed with various flavours of Linux and
FreeBSD to play with, complete with demo accounts and root passwords...

There were a number of people who called me or spoke to me with amazement
that this was all put on for free.

I also had someone emailing me from Texas asking to come...

Then there was the person who flew down from whyalla specifically for the
installfest -- he landed at about 8am, and left at about 2pm :)

that's about all from me for now :)

enjoy
