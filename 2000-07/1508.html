Hello to all,
I am a newbe to Linux and to your list.
I have installed Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 from the disk included with Sams
Teach Yourself Linux in 24 Hours . And am slowly working my way through
it.  (Chapter 3 so far)
I have a SMART Rapid Transit K56 Modem that seems to be a Winmodem.
I read the page on ISA Modems at <A HREF="http://linux.nf/isamodem.htm">http://linux.nf/isamodem.htm</A> but am
unable to understand it all.  I used win95 to determine that my modem is
at com 2 but I understand it uses irq 10, and the site page says irqs
8-15 are not available.

I have been getting some help from a great guy there in Australia and we
have come to an end.  So now I would like your recommendations for a new
modem that will be easy to install.  Preferable work "Right out of the
Box" with both Linux and Win 95.  I understand that most external modems
work with Linux, but I would prefer to use an internal modem just to
keep things neat.  I have plenty of room in the computer box .
Don
