&gt; Hypothetical PC user has lots of MS-Word files and Excel spreadsheets.

&gt; spreadsheet files contain very critical financial info, so I want to
&gt; back them up every day.  All my word documents will be backed up 
&gt; incrementally, with any modified in the last two days being copied to
&gt; zip."
&gt; 
&gt; Propose a GUI interface which is capable of the above expressiveness,
&gt; without sacrificing generality to other similar classes of problems
&gt; (i.e.: it'd need to be part of the standard File Selection dialog box,
&gt; so other programs could use it), which is more user-friendly than:
&gt; 
&gt;     find . -name '*.xls' -o -mtime -2 -exec cp '{}' /mnt/zip \;


Well actually it sounds more like a find file thign to me, not a general
file selection file dialog, fiel selection dialog, even if they allow
wildcards, still typcially only search in a single dir - the *nx find
command is not analogous to a file selct dialog imo it ia analogous ot a
find file command.

And btw the Mac Find File program (now caled Sherlock but Apple-F will
still bring it up) would do the job nicely.

Ie find files where modification date is "within 2 days of" the default
date which is todays date  and file type  is XLS8.

If you dont know the right file type, dreaggin g an icon of the file type
you wnat to a fidn criteria pane with creator selected will tell you.

Of course you dont have the ability to execute a command with the current
mac(and I dont hink the current windows) fiund file command, but the
mac(and I assuem the windows) find file have the flexibilitu requried to
find the files - from a gui.

So the gui is not incapable of what you wanted to do, the interface for
most of it - the hard bit is there.

Then you just drag the icons in the found items pane to your zip icon.

You could of course applescript the whole thing - and you can write the
applescript in a gui I believe you can even just tell it to record what
you do and it will repeat it back which I am pretty sure you can do in the
above case with enough generality to do what you want(eg bring found items
window forward, select all, copy to blah) - though I have never done so.
 
&gt; &gt; I don't believe a broad statement like, "There is no place in a user
&gt; program for the CLI," can hold water.  Look at the Mac:  They have no
&gt; CLI at all, and claim the user-friendliness high ground, but Mac advocates
&gt; tactfully fail to mention that there are some things you and I would 
&gt; find tremendously useful and perfectly natural in a CLI environment 
&gt; which are simply impossible to do on a Mac.  

But not the above example right?

I assume in this case you are confusing your own lack of familiarity with
a particular UI with a lack of features/power for that that UI?

I guess this is analogous to a windows or mc user seeing a linux box
without X and assumign that it cant do image editing.

The statement "There is no place in a user program for the CLI," may or
may not be an erroneous or defensible statement, but the examples above 
are not particularaly illustrative of your (I assume) assertion that a GUI
can't do everything as well as a CLI.
