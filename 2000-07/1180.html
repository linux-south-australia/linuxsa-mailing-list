It's is not, it isn't ain't, and it's it's,
                  not its, if you mean it
                  is. If you don't, it's its. Then too,
                  it's hers. It isn't her's. It
                  isn't our's either. It's ours, and
                  likewise yours and theirs.

"Russell, Richard (DEH)" spake...
&gt; 
&gt; "is" is correct.
&gt; 
&gt; "a maximum" is singular, and "is" is the singular form.
&gt; 
&gt; People get confused because they attach "is" to the "16,000" icons,
but this
&gt; is incorrect. It would be correct to say "There are 16,000 icons", or
"There
&gt; is a maximum of 16,000 icons"... Of course, these don't mean the same,
but
&gt; they illustrate the point.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, the English we see used around us (by colleagues both
verbally
&gt; and textually, in the media, in emails, and in every day life) is so
&gt; consistently bad that correct usage can sound wrong. As Winston
Churchill
&gt; said when someone criticised him for a dangling participle: "This is
the
&gt; sort of English up with which I will not put."


Where's that to?  Hair ya garn.  Where are you staying to?  You know
what I done
on the weekend?  I seen a rabbit!!  Yous should've seen it too.  It was
a huge
big rabbit, and it was sweating in the hot heat.

Love I living Broken Hill in.


Where's that to!
