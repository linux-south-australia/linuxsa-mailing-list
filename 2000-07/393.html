Just to fill you all in:

I installed a fresh copy of RedHat 6.2 on a different computer (still a
bucket-of-bits, though...)  Everything was different except the modem and
the power adapter for the modem.  I've tried my modem from home on our
normal setup and it does the same thing anyway.

I used linuxconf to set it up (is this bad?)

ip 192.168.0.200
sub 255.255.255.0
default domain: compunets.com.au (at the boss's request.  there is an
internet domain compunets.com.au being hosted elsewhere.  Is this bad?
Personally, I would have called it something else just for fun.)
ip of n/s: 203.5.73.2 (optusnet dns)
Routing enabled
umm... usuall stuff...
Didn't even get to setting up eth0 before I could see we still had the ping
problem.

Anyway, we have too much other work to do, so this has become a "low
priority" again as it still works...kinda, sometimes.... :-)

I give up.


ps:  We exclusively use Netcomm Roadster II external modems.  Blatantly
overpriced in my opinion, but they always seem to work, and have never
required us to use an init string before.  Tried lowering connect speed to
19200 and it still behaved strangely.  We're back to our server with
everything setup and it's set to 57600.  Is there a console utility to
provide detailed connection information, like connect speed, current state
of ppp0 connection (ie., is it having to reinitialise?), traffic throughput,
etc?


Regards,
