First up, a big congratulations to everyone for a great
event (especially the harrassed Richard Russell).

As the StartDesk person, although some people were
frustrated by the wait time or in some cases by us running out of time for their installation, almost
everyone went away feeling good about the day.  This 
says a lot about the positive attitude of all involved
in organising or installing on the day.  Well done!

Where I could, I put through special cases ASAP (eg.
sick relatives at home, can't attend evening meetings,
came from Tanunda).  However one gentlemen we didn't
have time for on the day and can not come during
evenings still needs to have his installation done.

Mr Wade (an older gentleman) has left his telephone
number with me.  If anyone is willing to help him out,
please email me and I'll forward you his phone number.

FYI, anyone that couldn't get the install done on the
day, but can attend the evening meetings, I've asked to
email the group and advise us (in detail) that they'd
like to bring their PC/probs to the next LinuxSA meeting
(either this Tuesday or next month).  So get ready for
some more installing!

Once again, congrats on a fantastic day.
