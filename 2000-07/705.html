&gt; &gt; Firstly, perhaps someone in the audience can enlighten us as to how the
GPL
&gt; &gt; will enforce the 'spirit' of Linux and open-source?

The bottom line is perceptions as an end user to maintenence and on going
support of the product used.

The 'spirit' is an alternative word to 'market' when you want to attribute
Linux with honorable goals.

The bazaar approach, the so-called gift economy, relies on the notion that
if someone drops the ball, some one else will undoubtedly take up the baton
if the product (and the kudos) is worthwhile. The perception at the very
least, is that large numbers of programmers are 'out there', hacking away
and continuously refining the 'product'. It is most likely true.

You are free to take GPL code, close it off, and call it mailK instead of
Kmail. (who'd be the wiser?). Fine and wonderful, but where is your market
when the alternative is equally as good, and has the promise of being better
maintained and evolving. As an aside, there's more than enough code in
Windoze filched directly from Open Source, it doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter to open source, and it doesn't matter to Windoze. They are in
different ballgames.

The magic of the GPL is that everything you add to the original is, or can
be, GPL. It garantees you, the author, kudos and it's effect is explained
rather well by Eric Raymond in the noosphere (excuse spelling , tired).

So, you have this double whammy. As an author, the 'glory' of your name
associated with your peers, and the end user seeing the results as a
strongly maintained product that grows and evolves. The commercial model
cannot compete on the same playing field. Companies and their products come
and go according to the whoopsies financial accountants and marketing hype
made to their livelihood. A good gpl product lives by its usefulness alone.

While much is made of the 'spirit' of open source, with passing homilies to
security, good code etc (some code is awful), the whole issue boils down to
ego. People use the GPL as a garanteed vehicle to getting their name in
lights and users use gpl because they are only too well aware of the
strength of support they get behind the product. Ego can also translate to
being in the company of friends.

There is now, an interesting shift in medium sized companies. The working
model now, for them, is to treat the GPL in much the same way as
Distributors treat Linux. They use it as a vehicle to promote add on
services. As an example, Anzac corp, US supplies full details of it's Twinax
IPDS and SCS (IBM) source code. You are free to pinch it if you want. Here's
the rub. You are also free to add and refine that code under the terms of
the GPL. The unspoken reference is that you are garanteed a slice of the
action because Anzac will promote the hell out of you and your efforts.
Result? Developers pouring into Anzac, and users pouring into Anzac to
obtain 'real' product.

This is the strength of the open source model and Companies, finally, are
seeing they don't need to be hostile to it, let alone fear it. There is an
alternative to proprietary, intellectual property rights.
