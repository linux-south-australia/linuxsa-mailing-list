Mainly because it costs money.  Paying your ISP to get access to
mirror.aarnet.edu.au is still going to be cheaper than paying for
the indial phone lines.

I suggest you have a look at PCUG(ACT)'s Internet Project -- a
huge BBS that evolved into offering access to the Internet.  And
even they now think that ISPs run so close to costs as to make
it not worthwhile.

Yes, I know that Telstra are bastards and are making a fortune,
but that will change next year and there's little we can do that
will have a payback period the will finish before SCCN arrives in
Jan 2001.

&gt; Even better, perhaps we could lobby our local libraries to stock GPL CDs of
&gt; all description, kindly donated by the SA Linux community for the benefit of
&gt; SA?  Local libraries could do with more justification for increased funding
&gt; and opening hours by increasing and diversifying their patronage.

Forget it, libraries simply aren't interested in items that
cost $3 and turn over every few months.  By the time they
have catalogued the item, it will be superceeded.

But LinuxSA could maintain its own lending library of CDs.
