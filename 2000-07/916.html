Alex!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I run a local forwarding name server (BIND) with the following setup:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; options {
&gt; &gt;   directory "/etc/named";
&gt; &gt;   forwarders { 203.20.69.2; };
&gt; &gt; };
&gt; 
&gt; Is that 203.20.69.2 your ISP? What are you trying to do here? Why are
&gt; you using the forwarder statment?

Essentially I am online for spans of hours (like 16 hours) at a time.
I'm running a caching, forwarding name server because I tend to stay
within a small number of sites. Rebel's name server is slow (well the
name server isn't slow the Internet connection is), so it's MUCH faster
for me to have a local, caching name server.

&gt; Don't use this file anymore, it has been superceeded. Use
&gt; /etc/nsswitch.conf

Oh, of course. It still says files dns though.

&gt; Try putting in an IP address that named is actually using. I suspect
&gt; that 0.0.0.0 is invalid as it usually means 'the default route'

According to the DNS & BIND book by O'Reilly that is an appropriate
address. Besides, I know it works because I only ever talk to 0.0.0.0,
there's no name server running at my dynamically assigned IP address and
ethereal the packet sniffer can see the two name servers talking to each
other.

&gt; That's a pretty dodgey way of assuming that name service is happening.
&gt; You could get a bind stats dump from named, or use tcpdump to watch
&gt; the packets.

Yes, I know I should. I probably should have said that I determined how
my system behaves by using ethereal. Essentially, Netscape especially
hangs on DNS lookups. Essentially I'm trying to work out why, even
though my hosts.conf and nsswitch.conf both point to "files" or "host"
to do DNS lookups, it suddenly decides that localhost does not exist and
hence waits for my name servers to time out before realising it does
exist in host.conf :-(
