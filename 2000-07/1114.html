Hi all...
How do I go about setting up my 2 networked computers to share an
internet connection?

I have had a go myself but haven't been that successful
Box 1 is my linux machine...RH6., and all working fine in respect to
connecting to the internet etc.
This machine has 2 accounts, Root and 1 user.
This computer is connected to another box in the house with a x-over
cable, I can ping the 2 boxes ok.
I have win 98 on this other  box and wish to use it with IE5/Netscape
for internet access.

IP forwarding is enabled.

Can I use the range 10.0.0.X , or are the 'O's" a no-no in this
situation?

Using TCP/IP on the win 98 box I have set it as follows...
IP=10.0.0.5
Subnet mask=255.255.255.0
Host=will
Domain=williss.home
DNS server search order = 203.x.y.z, 203.x.y.z ( both numbers provided
by ISP)

Gateway=10.0.0.1(ip of linux box)

WINS Resolution is disabled

I have created an LMHOSTS File as follows...
#ip address        Machine Name
10.0.0.1                will
10.0.0.5                josh

...And put it in my C:/WINDOWS directory.

How do I set IE5 up to use the lan for accessing the internet

Do I Have to assign proxies and ports?


Now the linux box.

I have set the Linux machine as follows...
IP is 10.0.0.1
subnet mask is 255.255.255.0

Do I have to set a gateway address? ( I'm thinking no, because this
machine is the gateway?)

I have set the DNS settings on the linux box to the ones that the ISP
gave me...

My etc/hosts file I have set as follows...
127.0.0.1     localhost.localdomain    localhost
I 0.0.0.1        will.williss.home             will
10.0.0.5         josh.williss.home            josh

Needless to say I haven't got the  WIN98 box talking to the outside
world yet...

HELP!!! and help greatly appreciated...

Cheers,
