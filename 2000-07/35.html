Ok, let's look at a quick subset.

   - No (realistic) size limitations

   - Support for bus disconnection during I/O transactions

   - Very high bus bandwidth, large number of devices

   - Multiple bus-masters (so, for example, your CD-ROM can initiate
     a command to tell your computer you've just ejected a disk, instead
     of relying on the computer to poll it every few seconds)

   - A well designed and well defined spec, which permits total 
     vendor independence and interoperability.

In more detail:

SCSI is basically a packet-based peer-to-peer communications protocol
designed around mass storage devices.  Think of it as something akin
to Ethernet:  Every device on the bus is capable of initiating a 
"conversation", you can talk to devices while other devices are in the
middle of a conversation, etc.  

Downsides:  Again, think of it as something akin to an Ethernet:  It
doesn't cope well with bus bandwidth saturation.  Collision domains 
don't work well under load.

A SCSI I/O is based around a device sending packets containing commands
or data to another device.  Each device on the bus has a unique address
(either 3 bits wide or four bits wide, depending on whether you're talking
about SCSI or wide SCSI), and commands transmitted on the bus contain 
the source address of the device which transmitted them, and the destination
address of the target it's attempting to control.

In the latency period between the transmission of a request and the 
reception of the response, other devices are free to utilize the bus
too.  For example, if you're backing up one disk onto a SCSI tape drive
whilst doing I/O on another disk, that'll all work harmoniously:  While
your backup disk and tape drive are busy working on high-latency
transactions, your I/O to your data disk will speed along happily.  This
is one of the MAJOR performance benefits SCSI exhibits, and is why single
user machines usually don't notice the differences between IDE and SCSI:
A single human sitting behind a single keyboard usually doesn't cause
large amounts of parallel I/O on large numbers of mass storage devices.

SCSI devices as manufactured don't give a rat's arse about PCs, so they
don't have the stupid design warts PCs exhibit.  More specifically, the
bizarre restriction on volume size present on PCs and virtually no other
modern hardware in existance simply doesn't exist on SCSI devices, so 
the only effective limit on their size is the limits of modern technology.
SCSI drivers don't typically address sectors on the disk in terms of 
its cylinder number, head number and sector number;  instead they address
them in terms of linear block numbers and let the firmware on the (smart)
disk device determine where the block is physically located.  BIOS chips
on PC host adaptors need to do translations so a PC BIOS (which *does* 
want to think in terms of cylinders, heads and sectors) can boot, but once
a 32 bit OS is loaded the BIOS can be ignored and the disk can be used
to the full extent of its capabilities.

Finally, SCSI host adaptors have virtually all used DMA, which, in the
past, has provided huge performance wins over IDE.  IDE devices which
predate EIDE didn't support DMA at all, so all disk I/O required the
cooperation of the CPU.  Did you ever wonder why your quake framerate
would go down whenever it decided it wanted to load the next bit of the 
map or a new texture?  Now you know:  Instead of running your quake game,
the CPU was busy with the mind-numbingly boring task of byte-copying
data from the disk's port-mapped I/O buffer into your system's physical
memory and vice-versa.  If you'd had a SCSI system, your OS would say,
"Oi!  Give me these disk blocks, place them in RAM starting at this
address..." then it'd go back to running your quake game.  Meanwhile,
in the background, the disk and SCSI card would carry out the requested
commands, and trigger an interrupt to get the OS's attention when they'd
finished.  The user interface experience on a SCSI system is noticibly
"smoother" because the CPU isn't continually being ripped away from user
tasks for basic I/O services.

That'll probably fill fifteen minutes :-)
