&gt; &gt; * a belief that the command line has a place in the operating
&gt; &gt; system
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. But Gui will rule. Command line savvy is no longer a badge
&gt; of hairy chestedness. In your face dialog boxes with all options
&gt; clearly presented is the way it is, underlying scripts is another
&gt; thing and fine, but command line is a nostalgic throwback to horse
&gt; and carriage days.

Try telling that to a CCIE Network Engineer! Worked on a Cisco switch
or router lately? They're about as command line as you can get, and
also the backbone of that Internet thing I hear so much about!  :o)

Of course if you are just referring to a command line in an OS, then I
could agree with you, but since you said that "Command line savvy is
no longer a badge of hariy chestedness", I assume you don't. In the
router example above, command line savvy is very much badge of hariy
chestedness, money, chicks, fast cars and sex.

...I hope.

Cheers

Alex!
