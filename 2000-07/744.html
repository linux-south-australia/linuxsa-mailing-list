Hi everybody :)

Just a reminder that this list is about to be *inundated* with newbie-style
requests. Those of us who have been around for a long time will be well
advised to take care with how we respond to their requests. Note that there
is nothing wrong with "RTFM", as long as the "TFM" to "R" is specified in
the email, and if the manual is actually fine :). Of course, if someone
claims to have read the manual, "RTFM <A HREF="http://the.manual/">http://the.manual/</A>" isn't going to
help them much -- try to give them help in interpreting and using the
manual... point them to the specific part of the manual, and walk them
through it. It would also be a Good Idea(tm) to go easy on the religious
wars and flames for a while, simply so as not to intimidate newbies.

Also, someone mentioned the idea of building an FAQ -- this is an EXCELLENT
idea, and should be done ASAP. I will write the intro on Monday night, and
will cover things like FAQ-FAQ's (questions about the FAQ), List-FAQ's and
LinuxSA-FAQ's. if others can start writing technical FAQ's, please do so....
also, feel free to contribute questions as well as answers -- unanswered
questions will be included for the first few postings so we can get answers
:)

I will probably structure it somewhat as follows:

Installing.
It won't boot.
Sound problems
X problems
shell basics
where to get other help

We should probably utilise some of the information that David Lloyd has
compiled as well, and of course the one-page guide...

Thanks y'all!
