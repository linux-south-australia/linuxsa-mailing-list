&gt; &gt; Remember that most of their users are using windows and it can take a long
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; to explain what dns does. to a user who does know the diffetrnce between
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; www and the  internet..

&gt;
&gt; George, what are you implying ???? Windows users do not understand DNS and
&gt; the difference between www and the internet ???
&gt;
&gt; I think what you should have said is as follows:
&gt;
&gt; "Remember it can take a long time to explain what dns does to a user who
&gt; doesn't know...........etc"

I did. :) It was meant as a simplification  :))

On many occasions I've spent up to half an hour or so trying to explain dns,
the internet and everything. because that all are connected in.

&gt; If this is not what you meant, then kindly pull your head out of sand and
&gt; realise that OS choice does NOT imply knowledge of the internet and it's
&gt; workings. (Notice I didn't say the WWW and it's workings, ps I use windows,
&gt; I also knew about such things before I knew of Linux!!!!)
&gt;
&gt; Don't throw around generalities like this please.

.....

Still the anlogy of head in the sand applies more some users of all operating
systems.... :P

And so the answers goes on....

I didn't generalize, I tried to keep it simple. I'm a Linux user not a Linux
god.... I know where most ISP's are coming from though

I tend to be a little blunt to keep it short... And i've never sent a reply of
just RTFM !!
