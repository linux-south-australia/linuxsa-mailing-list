That's mean. I remember I used to run a Bulletin Board System and we had
this handy little key combo which was ALT-X, and if you wanted to dump the
caller with fake line noise you'd press it, and it would put up a string of
characters (keyboard and extended) and one or two short delays in between
the letters once in a while and after 2 or 3 seconds of doing that it dumped
the caller, and they were under the impression that it was a modem fault :)

It was very handy for when I needed to free up the line to get back onto the
'net or another BBS !!

&gt; I know someone who puts the string "+++ATH0" in his mail headers. Quite
&gt; mean!
&gt; 
&gt;    (That's a modem 'guard tone', or, 'stop what you're doing and drop back
&gt;     to modem commmand mode ready to receive AT commands.' The AT command
&gt;     H0 hangs up the modem immediately. So someone who has left their modem
&gt;     with the common default guardtone setting on will have a dropped line
&gt;     every time they try to receive a message from this person. And since
&gt;     SMTP servers normally retry quite a few time before giving up on a 
&gt;     message the recipient is likely to have quite a bit of grief. Ouch)
