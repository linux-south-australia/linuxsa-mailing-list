&gt; How are BCC's handled? Is it THE protocol itself or is it a gentleman's

Think of a "Dear Occupant" letter; somehow this letter managed to get to
you, even though neither of your first or last names are "Occupant" (or
"Dear").  How did this miracle of miracles occur?  Why, the envelope
of course.  Same with email; the From:, To: and CC: aren't actually
used in the delivery of a message, but during SMTP delivery there is
a "RCPT TO" command that denotes who should receive this email.  It
_may_ show up in the Received headers as to who the original recipient
was , but it certainly won't show you who the others are.

Think of SPAM - the From line rarely (if ever) tells you who the mail
was _really_ from.

And this is the fundamental reason why, if you should happen to have
an entire domain's worth of mail funnelled into one POP account, it
is actually difficult to figure out who the mail was actually intended
for 100% accuracy.  By the time you've received the email, the envelope
recipient has long been discarded.  fetchmail has some trickery built
into it, but in the end it's still a kludge.

  Daryl Tester
