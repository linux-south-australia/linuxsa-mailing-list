Hi,

It would appear that someone has been poking around one of my machines.  I
know this because my postmaster address received a bounce message from
someone I don't know, which was relayed though my machine.  The disturbing
thing about the content of the email was that it seemed to be a reply to a
previous message telling this person about something that was meant to be on
my machine (not sure what it was, but the sender indicated that they were
having trouble getting their browser to see it (the machine doesn't' run a
httpd at all so I'm not surprised)).  

Having had a close look at /var/log/messages it would seem that I'm the only
person who's logged into this machine recently (and all such logins came
from one of my other machines, at times when I was most likely to be using
those machines.  i.e.. I can account for all the logins to my account as
being me).  All root logins were immediately preceded by a login by my user,
so they were likely to be me su'ing to root.  I've checked /etc/passwd and
there are no unusual user accounts on the machine.  So it would appear that
whoever is using the box hasn't been able to telnet into it at all.
/var/log/secure doesn't show any unusual connections either.

Is there any other log files I should check?  Are there any good Linux
security references/sites that I should refer to to try and increase
security on the machine?

Jim.
