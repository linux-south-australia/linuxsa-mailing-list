&gt; &gt; I'm a beginner at these things, but it seems to me that

&gt; I think members of incorporated bodies generally have limited liability.
&gt; That would be the reason why one incorporates.  Right now all members of
&gt; "LinuxSA" are liable for LinuxSA debts without limitation.  We're liable
&gt; jointly (all of us together) and severally (each of us individually), so
&gt; there's lots of ways that a debtor can try to recover monies.

This isn't correct at all. The way I read the above is that in the event
that someone in the community wants to get money out of what they perceive
as "linuxsa", for example for a broken leg sustained somehow in relation
to activities to do with Linux somewhere in Adelaide and not covered by
some other public liability, they can sue:

   a) those subscribed to the linuxsa mailing list, or

   b) people who attended a public meeting announced on the linuxsa
      list, or

   c) people who maintain or once maintained the bits of Internet
      infrastructure that are used by the linuxsa mailing list and web
      site (such as Camtech who host the server it uses, Netcraft who
      run the server it uses, and Matthew Tippett who once upon a time
      created some of the web content but who now lives somewhere else
      and has other interests.)

This doesn't sound very likely, does it.

There is precendent for just about every structure for gettings things
done in the open source community, from non-profit organisations (The
Apache Foundation) through to for-profit companies (pick one) through to
nothing at all (The Samba Team, The Linux kernel maintainers...). The
Samba Team regularly has to interact with real-world items such as
shipments of valuable computers, and things that could potentially have
legal interpretations (eg grants of proprietary software rights to people
"on the samba team".) There's always a way to do it. I'm on a private
mailing list called "samba team" but I'm could easily be on a paper
mailout list for "owners of yellow toyotas" in the same way.

I don't have a reason to wish for incorporation or not (I'm not part of
any organisation known as "LinuxSA" and won't ever be) but I have observed
that one of the earlier really big LUG events was the Atlanta Linux Expo,
which has never incorporated. I know who underwrote the first event to the
tune of USD30k, and it was on the basis of a legally-meaningful document
that said "you pay us back if you can, if not then the money has gone for
ever". As it happened it was paid back and there was plenty left over.
Since then other means have been found to fund and manage subsequent
events.

People might point to reports of a poorly-managed last Atlanta event, but
the point remains: the LUG behind ALS has never incorporated despite
needing commercial structure sufficient to run events for many thousands
of people. From <A HREF="http://www.ale.org/:">http://www.ale.org/:</A>

    The ALE group is loosely organized, with a few people acting as contact 
    points and no charter to bog things down. Anyone is welcome to come to 
    the meetings; there is no membership, fees or any other formalities. To
    become a member, just show up. Our primary interest is in getting
    information about Linux to members of the Atlanta community.

I would have quoted from the German equivalents which have been putting on
even bigger shows for even longer but I couldn't find anything in English.
If there could be something as successful in Adelaide as the Linux Expos
held in Atlanta of a few years ago then the commercial goals in Adelaide
that people like me have would be much more easily met.
