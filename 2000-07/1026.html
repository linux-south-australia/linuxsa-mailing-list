Having read the entire thread so far (including the many
posts from after this one), I've restricted myself to
posting only one response, otherwise I'll be here all
night. :)

&gt; Possibly. But Gui will rule. Command line savvy is no longer a badge of
&gt; hairy chestedness. In your face dialog boxes with all options clearly
&gt; presented is the way it is, underlying scripts is another thing and fine,
&gt; but command line is a nostalgic throwback to horse and carriage days. we are
&gt; in the 21st century.

Presenting something as "the way it is", or "the way it will be",
or even "it's the twenty first century" is no substitue for an
argument. Under any circumstances. 

&gt; I use (and prefer) command line, but they are neither
&gt; intuitive, nor particlarly productive.

I don't think anyone's saying that a command line is intuitive for
a new user, but claiming that they're not productive is quite
ridiculous. Using a command line (and the keyboard in general) is
usually much faster once you know what you're doing. It's a steep
learning curve, but it pays off. It's much faster to use whatever
keybindings there are in a program than to use the menu commands.
I still use the Emacs menus for commands whose keybindings I don't
know yet, but if I were still using the file menu for opening
files, saving or quitting, I'd still be hacking my C now.

There was another comment about command lines being bad for 
repetitive stuff. A decent command line is *far better* than a
gui for repetitive stuff, as long as you've got command history.
Or, get the command you just typed and whack it in a script: it's
there for all eternity.

Gui's in front of underlying programs are an excellent thing, and
I agree that a decently designed gui makes things both easier and
quicker for a novice user, but not everyone is a novice user. 
Some of us like to invest time once to learn something so that it 
will be faster all the other times.
