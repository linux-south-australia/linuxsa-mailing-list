Ian!

&gt; Firstly, perhaps someone in the audience can enlighten us as to how the GPL
&gt; will enforce the 'spirit' of Linux and open-source?

You have either:

* asked two questions
* asked one question that requires a definition

I'm going to take the second path to enlightenment [tm].

THE SPIRIT OF LINUX
-------------------
Defining this is flame waw material. Given that the Linux community is
actually a group of communities and individuals whose only common
denominator is the Linux kernel the definition of Linux's Spirit will be
difficult. It is actually tied in with open-source but not the same
thing.

I believe the spirit of Linux displays the following properties:

* a belief in a good, stable operating system
* a belief that the command line has a place in the operating system
* a belief that people can help themselves and change the operating
system to suit themselves
* a belief that the operating system can be purchased absolutely free of
charge

Linux has formed a myriad of communities but they all would, I believe,
support the above four points. Hence, the spirit of Linux - at least to
me - is in what you believe about it and what you support in it.

OPEN SOURCE
-----------
This obviously means "open source". But what is "open source"? It means
that, once you have purchased a licence to use a product you receive the
source, are free to adjust it with some restrictions (eg you can't just
turn around and say you wrote it all, close source it and sell it) and
redistribute those adjustments.

Be careful in your definition of "open source". It does not mean free.
If one reads a number of the open source style licences, unless the
original author actually specifies there is no reason that I couldn't
sell an open source product for profit; it only requires me to make sure
that my users have access to the source, can change the source and
perhaps even distribute their changes with or without consideration of
profit.

THE GPL
-------
The GPL and its cousin, the LGPL are licences which display the
following properties:

* you are required to give the source or offer the source to the
purchasers of the licenced material
* if you make changes you must:
  - ensure that the source for your changes acknowledges the original
author/authors
  - ensure that the GPL is applied to your changes (or the LGPL as the
case may be)

The GPL actually doesn't prevent you from charging for a product or
products. I could sell a GPL Word Processor, for example, for $499.
Because of the licencing, though, the user would be permitted to copy
this Word Processor and give it away for less or for nothing.

I believe that market forces keep GPL software at no charge. It's not
the GPL itself - if you have a choice of purchasing something from me
for $50 and from someone else for $20 all other matters being equal,
you'd buy the $20 version. In fact, I'd probably be buying the $20
version.

NOW, back to the original question. As defined the spirit of the GPL, a
licence designed to allow others to modify and modify distributed code
base fulfils part of my definition of the spirit of Linux. Because
anyone is free to view, modify and fix up GPL code, GPL code - once it
is stable - is very robust. Peer review is one of the best, if not 	THE
best way to produce anything of quality. Allowing your peers to suggest
and make improvements enhances the effect of peer review. Hence, GPL
code tends to be quite robust and responsive to bug-fixes. This fulfils
another two tenets of my definition.

Because of the market effect of the GPL, GPL software tends to be
absolutely free of charge. Fulfilling the last tenet of my definition.

The GPL is one tool - and only one tool - to help the Linux community
develop and thrive within its own spirit.
