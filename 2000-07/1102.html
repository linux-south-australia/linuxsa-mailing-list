Hi,

&gt; &gt; Many GUI utilities merge the functions of several similar CLIs (eg a file
&gt; &gt; manager will merge ls, cp, mv, find and some grep all into itself).
&gt; &gt; For the 16,000 diferent icons, you will have as much dificulty
&gt; &gt; differentiating through 16 000 very similar commands (even given the
&gt; 
&gt; Alors, qu'est-ce que vous voulez dire? C'est vrai qu'il y a beaucoup des
&gt; mots, mais les gens francophones, ils pouvent comprendre la langue
&gt; francaise....et la langue francaise a plus que 16 000 mots...

&lt;cough&gt; My hovercraft is full of eels

&gt; (So, what do you mean? It is true that there are many words, but the
&gt; people of the French countries understand the French language...and the
&gt; French language has more than 16 000 words...)

Your point was that 16000 icons would be hard to recognise and remember,
two counter argumants I made to that are that either 16000 commands would
be as hard to remember, or 16000 icons would be as easy (not taking into
account the 16000 icons are not actually that diferent in many cases).

The other point is that for a set of n commands, there would be a fraction
of n GUIs as most GUIs will merge the functionality of several commands
into the GUI.


To put a personal opinion on this argument. GUIs are great for hiding
complexity, making things simple for a user, looking nice etc. GUIs
problems generally are that they are written to have a particular role,
and if you want to extend past that role, you generally are stuck. A CLI
is generally not nearly as friendly or well presented, but is great for
taking data, and piping it around, and also has advantages like no needing
a graphics card, or as much memory.

I think both have their place, and one wil never replace another. There
are times when I've been glad of a nice GUI, so I don't have to try and
remember 20 odd options to a command line program to achieve the same
thing. There are times when I've been glad of the command line so I can
taylor some data to my tastes.

Ultimately I think this can go in the class of distribution wars. It comes
down to personal taste as to which you prefer.

*Stands down from soap box, and disaperars into obscurity again*
