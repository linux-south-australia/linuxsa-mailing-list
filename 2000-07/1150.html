I recently had a dvi file which I wanted to view using xdvi, but it
was gzipped.  Instead of gzipping it and then viewing it, I wanted to
do something like this:

zcat filename.dvi.gz | xdvi -

The only problem is that xdvi does not have this option of accepting
standard input.  I tried to get around this by doing:

mkfifo mypipe

zcat filename.dvi.gz &gt; mypipe &
xdvi mypipe &

But it came back with the error "xdvi.bin: DVI file corrupted" so that
didn't work.  In the end I gave up and just did zcat to a temp file
and used that.

But I still haven't got to my point.  Just suppose xdvi did allow
standard input --- then you could use pipes.  But one feature of xdvi
is that if you update the file (ie you run latex again), xdvi rereads
the file and displays the updated version.  But with pipes, you
receive the stream once and then that's it!  Perhaps the pipe protocol
could be changed so that you could receive multiple streams, one after
the other until someone said stop?  Would this be a valuable
improvement to pipes, or is it the wrong layer to be adding such
functionality?

With the Gui vs Cli debate, one idea would be to implement Cli
structures graphically.  Command lines are powerful, but they are
linear, which means they don't express some structures as well as
others.  With pipes, it seems natural to allow pipes between things in
a graph like structure.  Who says programs need have only one input or
output?  (And indeed they don't, take standard error for example ---
but expressing multiple outputs is tricky on a command line.)  You
could could express a graph like structure of interactions between
different programs much more easily graphically.

I can envisage the following setup being useful.  In a graphfical
"pipes setup" interface, you connect up the following picture:

            [latex filename1.tex]      [latex filename2.tex]
                      \                        /
                       \                      /        
                        \                    /        
                         \                  /        
                          \                /        
                           \______________/
                                [xdvi]        
                                  |
                                  |
                                  \/
                            [some window]

Having set up the structure, every time you want to update your view
of filename1, you click on [latex filename1.tex], and it sends a new
stream down the pipe.  If you want to see filename2, you click on the
other latex node.

I imagine there could be much more complexity with this kind of setup.
For example, you could add "switches", meaning you could use some kind
of test to see which input to accept.  You could add "delays" which
postponed the sending of something along a pipe until something else
was done.  I imagine there are all sorts of other things you could do.
And it could be done in a way that gave you all the power of a CLI and
more besides.  Well, I'm sure a CLI could be made to do all this, but
not easily or in a way that was intuitively done.  Of course, with the
graphical interface, there would still be places for entering linear
stuff, for example the conditions at "switches" would be best added
using linear expression.

I think the time has come to design a tool which represents the power
of the command line graphfically.

Actually, the ideal thing would be to have something like lyx for
shell programming.  Express your shell programming graphically, and
then convert this into shell code.

Cheers,

Mark.
