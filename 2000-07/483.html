Concerning LaTeX for large documents.


&gt; &gt; What would you suggest is the best way to write a large document under
&gt; &gt; Linux. for instance should I use:
&gt; 
&gt; TEX/LaTEX is ok too but quite confusing to use (I couldn't get motivated
&gt; to learn it).

I think people overstate the complexity of LaTeX for the simple reason
that they typically abuse it.  Most of us are no longer very
interested in taking advice from experts --- given wysiwyg
wordprocessors and cheap autofocus cameras we generate documents and
images to our own tastes.  To appreciate this fact note how
excruciating it can be to suffer other peoples holiday snaps ;-).

Treat LaTeX as a simple well thought out markup language, and _do not_
fight the conservative layout that it generates and it is an excellent
document preparation tool.  You can attend to the exact look of your
document at the very end exploiting the fact that you have _marked up_
your document.

If you are already a programmer and familiar with text editors then
the syntax of the markup language is trivial.  If you use emacs then
you are in for a real treat because you can use AUCTeX and RefTeX
(emacs modes named for their handling of LaTeX elements) to automate
many of the tasks required in a large document.
