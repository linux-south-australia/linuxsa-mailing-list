&gt; The claim that things can be done using a CLI that cannot be done with a
&gt; GUI is patently absurd.  Just as new commands can be created, so also can
&gt; new GUI elements.  Perhaps nobody has demonstrated a usuable pipe element,
&gt; but I accept that it can be done.  For me, the question is whether a GUI
&gt; is appropriate.

Here here.

Another questiontaht might be asked is if a pipe is really needed, it is
in a unix text line paradignm, but might not be the appropriate parradigm
in a gui.

an emxaple of somethign that _might_ be more apporpaite is a container,
that can have a single command ort commands applied to all of its
contents.

After all a pipe is just a way of getting output from one place itno
another, the "placesw" in unixs case happen to be typically programs that
execute on a streamof input.

 &gt; 
&gt; Ask what makes a GUI and you might be told WIMP: Windows, Icons, Mice and
&gt; Pull-down menus.  Icons are a basic GUI element, and (along with pull-down
&gt; menus) they are the equivalents of keystrokes.  Type a command, or click
&gt; an icon: these are equivalent concepts.
&gt; 
&gt; Icons are, well, iconographs: pictures with a conventional significance
&gt; attached to them.  By contrast, English letters represent a phonetic
&gt; mechanism to build words.  Now a picture might be worth a thousand words,
&gt; but it only takes a few dozen unique letters to create any and all English
&gt; words.  These can expresses an infinite array of ideas, but an infinite
&gt; number of unique pictures is probably required to convey the same ideas in
&gt; iconographs.
&gt; 
&gt; The benefit of command lines over graphical interfaces is not what can be
&gt; expressed, but the flexibility of expression.  The converse of "a picture
&gt; is worth a thousand words" is "26 letters describes every picture."  I do
&gt; not care for a "simplified" GUI that needs "only" a few thousand icons.
&gt; 

Well icons typcially only convey a small protionof the info, typicaly the
file type, or the fiel creator, but hten again so do fiel naems and
filename extensions.
The name of the fiel is still typically in allguis I have seen conveyr\ed
by okld fashion text.

So i think the expressivness ios the same, the representationof soem data
is different, eg a picture for fiel type, but the info is sitll there and
still asscessable, as is the 26*fielnamelength exprerssivness of textual
names

jason
