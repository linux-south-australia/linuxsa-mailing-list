&gt;
&gt; Another disk is better.  But in a workstation single disk, dual boot scenario
&gt; the best partitioning plan appears to be:
&gt;
&gt;   1: /boot
&gt;   2: other OS
&gt;   3: extended
&gt;      e1: swap
&gt;      e2: Linux /
&gt;
&gt; My observation about the location of swap was to make two points:
&gt;
&gt;  - people forget to optimise swap performance, and thus rob their
&gt;    machine of under-load performance [the "you should never swap"
&gt;    myth]

Right, but how much of overall disk activity is swap?  In my
experience, it's seldom more than about [picks number out of hat] 5%.

&gt;  - you do want to think about what is at the center of the disk.
&gt;    Or more to the point -- don't put performance critical data
&gt;    at the ends of the disk

You're talking positioning here.  In my experience, average
positioning times are nowadays in the same order of magnitude as
rotational latency (see my earlier message).  This wasn't always the
case; 15 years ago we were looking at 3,600 rpm drives with 8 ms
rotational latency and 30 ms average seek.  Obviously correct
partition positioning was much more important then.

&gt; Even if the disk topology can't be known (and EIDE's logical block
&gt; addressing makes that hard) the filesystem will sort blocks and
&gt; service them in an elevator fashion.  This always improves
&gt; performance on rotating disk media with significant head movement
&gt; times.

We can usually assume that the disk blocks are laid out sequentially,
for some definition of "sequential".

I have two other issues:

1.  What's the most heavily utilized part of disk?  That's what you
    need in the "middle" of the disk.  You're assuming swap here, but
    I suspect it has a lot to do with how you're using the system.

2.  Depending on the BIOS, laying out the root file system at the end
    of the disk is more likely to put it beyond the address range
    which is bootable.
