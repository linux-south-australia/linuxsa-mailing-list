&gt; I remember a thread which said that dpkg and it's neat update feature
&gt; was cool. autorpm doesn't AUTOMATICALLY install stuff without your
&gt; permission but it would be easy to get it to do so. Would I really want
&gt; this to do that?

It depends if you think permission is needed.  The tasks that run at those
times would be what is considered 'system maintenance'.  The ones that do
run on my (pretty much stock) RH 6.1 laptop is...

  logrotate, makewhatis, slocate, tetex, tmpwatch

Which all keep certian tools and utilities running in an appropriate order.
Almost all of these utilities are installed as seperate rpm's which 
in one way or another, you explicitely requested to be installed.  (They
might be in the 'standard workstation install or whatever'.

&gt; In fact, in my OPINION, distributors should make it clear in their
&gt; installation what cron jobs they are installing. I mean, how can one
&gt; expect a new comer to Linux (who might have turned OFF  alocal Sendmail)
&gt; to work out what cron is doing...lol....even I got caught out...it's
&gt; kinda jarring to suddenly find your system at 90% user load and hard
&gt; drives whirring at 4AM in the morning :-(

The main thing about cron in particular that it is perfectly clear to those
who are interested to find out *EXACTLY* what is running.

Through a mixture of the following commands there is no reason whatsoever
as to why the user shouldn't be able to find out what cron tasks are running.
(The only assumption is that you know the fact that 'cron' exists.)

  rpm -qa | grep cron
  rpm -ql crontabs
  rpm -ql vixie-cron

  man crontab

  ls -al /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.weekly ...
  ls -al /var/spool/cron
  cat /etc/crontab (or 'crontab -l' as root)

My 'Opinion' :) is that automatic system maintenance is a good thing.  And 
shouldn't be hidden from the user (which is isn't), but shouldn't necessarily
be an install option to confuse new users who have never seen a Unix box 
before and wouldn't even know what 'automatic system maintenance tasks' would
involve.

Regards,

Matthew
