I read about some guy years ago who build a "pipes" system for the Mac. Each
pipe was set up by changing it's name, sort of like the cut pipe you would
use cut -c3,5 as the name. Each pipe would send it's output to the pipe to
it's right in the folder it was in. It could handle sending the entire file
in one hit or character by character.

Not sure how well it worked, but the whole system did have a glowing write
up.

Just my 2.2c worth.

&gt; IMHO, I think that the way to simulate pipes and so on with a GUI is to
have
&gt; each program as a building block, and you manipulate physical pipes
between
&gt; them. You would have a blank screen, with a bunch of toolbars which would
&gt; represent the tools. Some would merely be filters, some would create data,
&gt; and some would merge or split data streams. Of course, for something like
&gt; grep, the power in it is in the regexp mini-language, so you want to keep
&gt; that... The point of such a GUI would be to make complex shell constructs
&gt; easier. I can draw this better than I can explain it... :)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; NEW CONTEST
&gt; -----------
&gt;
&gt; AIM:
&gt; Replace command line with GUI
&gt;
&gt; PURPOSE:
&gt; Similar to the C Obfuscation contest - NONE but it's fun
&gt;
&gt; OBJECTIVE:
&gt; The supervisors will set a suitable command line tool to represent with
&gt; a GUI.
&gt;
&gt; RULES:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Said GUI must:
&gt;   - exhibit standard GUI characteristics
&gt;   [note this would have to be elaborated; such things as you can't make
&gt; a window 4192 pixels wide simply because that's the length you'd need to
&gt; fit in all the options]
&gt;   - behave exactly (read exactly) as the man page for that command
&gt;   - as FEW at keyboard strokes as possible; i.e. everything that could
&gt; be point and click MUST be point and click
&gt;
&gt; PRIZE:
&gt; A stylised LinuxSA Tux
&gt;
&gt; Now, given that I've invented this contest, who would like to implement
&gt; the grep command? Base the grep on egrep as distributed with RedHat
&gt; Linux 6.2. I would point out that the search field for "grep" doesn't
&gt; appear to have any sensible limit, hence the GUI must be able to cope
&gt; with a search field consisting of at least 127 tokens but probably
&gt; should be able to cope with more.
&gt;
&gt; AND the GUI must be able to be understood by any literate computer
&gt; user...and it must accept input from stdin (because that's what the man
&gt; page says). If you can sensibly create a GUI allegory for STDIN I will
&gt; waive this particular requirement...
