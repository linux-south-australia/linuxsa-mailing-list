&gt;I quote:
&gt;
&gt;"The root user is the normal system administrator or super user account
&gt;within Linux and most UNIX systems. There is nothing special about this
&gt;name; you can change it to anything. Changing it is one good security idea.
&gt;A more devious security idea is to assign the root account a useless UID and
&gt;GID, like 65535/65535, that has access to nothing. This provides hackers
&gt;with hours of fun trying to break into a useless login account. Having a
&gt;backdoor account is also a good idea. This is an alternate root type account
&gt;with a hard to guess name and password combination."
&gt;Sounds good so far.
&gt;"Caution: Changing the root account name or the root home directory location
&gt;may break some applications, administration scripts, or future installation
&gt;scripts. This is part of the price of security, more work on your part to
&gt;maintain a higher level of security. You must decide which is more
&gt;important, security or ease of management."
&gt;Ok here is my question(s) is there a LOT to be gained by doing this?
&gt;How badly is your system broken by the fact that "some" scripts and
&gt;application need to see the user name root w/ UID 0 ???
&gt;Is anyone on the list doing this?
&gt;Last of all it was listed as a "certification objective" in the book so I
&gt;guess RH a teaching and testing this as a good/normal practice. Is it?

Well, the concept of UID 0 being the all powerful user is hard coded into
the kernel code, but what they are saying here is that the name root is
mapped to some other UID.

You will have to provide another account that maps to UID 0 so you can do
root related things.

I suspect, however, that the idea is more bother than it is worth. Simply
secure your machines better.

In addition, it does nothing to defeat buffer-overflow attacks against UID
0 daemons.

So, it may be dangerous in that it engenders a false sense of security.
