Agreed. But not everyone has had the pleasure (and BSD can be scary for
beginners ;-))

&gt; &gt;       The question I want to ask is which is the best distribution for the
&gt; &gt;       server ? I was simply going to install RedHat 6.2 and tweak it
&gt; &gt;       according to my needs, but there now appears to be a plethora
&gt; &gt;       of options available (e.g. Mandrake, Turbolinux), and I thought
&gt; &gt;       I'd seek opinions.

I personally recommend using what you are comfortable with. No matter
how good a distribution is, you will still have to make it do what you
want. Most dists are quite general in the audience they play to, so you
need to manually turn off all services and things before you leave. I am
creating a semi distribution for myself to install servers the way I
like (with nothing enabled in inetd.conf ;-)).

In the past (don't know about current) dists like Caldera didn't allow
you to easily select which packages to install (or better - not). We had
a problem here when I started where the last guy had installed the dodgy
UW-IMAPd (by selecting the defaults) and didn't disable it's use.

&gt; &gt;       It is a commercial environment. The server does file serving, intranet,
&gt; &gt;       database handling (small amounts), firewalling to internet, fax serving,
&gt; &gt;       and anything else I can think of later :)

Linux can do this and more ;-). If you are comfortable with RedHat,
stick with it on the production machines and use something different
when you get a non-critical machine to play with.

Feel free to ask questions on any specific troubles you have.

Hope it helps,
Matt

P.S. Our Web Guy here suggested using Windows NT Workstation with
Personal Web Server (as was recommended to him by some instant expert).
