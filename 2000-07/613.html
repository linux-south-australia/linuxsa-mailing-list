Subject: IBM WebSphere Application Server


&gt; Greetings,
&gt; I've just gone to a IBM training course called Making Web Content Real.
&gt; Some of the tools / products included:
&gt; WebSphere Studio (runs on Windoze only).
&gt; WebSphere Application Server (Intel platforms: NT, OS/2, Linux).

WebSphere App Server (WAS) ver 3.02 runs under NT, AIX & Solaris,
but not Linux, Only ver 2.03 runs under Linux.

&gt;
&gt; Has anyone used WebSphere Studio as a content authoring / assembly /
&gt; management tool?
&gt; What products are available for Linux that author / assemble / archive /
&gt; manage websites?
&gt;
I have tried to use WebSphere Studio but as you say doesn't work under
Linux,
anyhow I don't like it, there are far too many steps between production and
deployment to facilitate quick iterative development.

&gt;
&gt; The 2 products as a authoring -&gt; server solution look good, but
&gt; cross-platform server support is patchy, (The current version of WAS is
&gt; not available on all platforms).
&gt; Never-the-less the technology is standards-based, which is A Good Thing.
&gt;
WAS 3.02 is also bug city!

&gt; Has anyone used WebSphere Application Server on Linux?
&gt; It essentially consists of DB2, Apache & an Apache plug-ins for running
&gt; Java Servlet Pages.
&gt; Since its Apache with some IBM enhancements, it still supports CGI, but
&gt; IBM's longer-term strategy is to go with Java Servlets, which are
&gt; cross-platform.
&gt;

Ah but! version 2.03 that runs under Linux doesn't support JSP (neither 0.91
or 1.0) nether does it allow the development of EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans)
if your doing small sites then no problems but for larger distributed site,
I always
want to be able to use EJBs.

IMHO WAS 2.03 was easier to use than 3.02 during development/debug phase
but 3.02 is better during deployment

If you want JSP & EJB in Linux then you need to look at suns J2EE. It
doesn't have any
nice GUIs but its much simpler to work with. ala TomCat
