&gt; Thanks for the responses.
&gt; 
&gt; So far it appears to be between Debian and FreeBSD :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm guilty of not being as clear as I'd hoped, however, so at the
&gt; risk of annoying everyone I'll clarify my position.
&gt; 
&gt; For my purposes, I'm after a good base to work from - I'm not worried
&gt; about the distribution having swish gui interfaces or automatic detection
&gt; of various cards - the first thing I'll do is recompile the kernel to remove
&gt; the excess fat, and to include support for the various hardware. A
&gt; comment regarding the 'hackability' of RedHat is interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; I currently have a slightly smaller, but similar, setup with the server
&gt; running RedHat, with all of the functionality of the previous message.
&gt; Due to the nature of the new work I'm undertaking, I'd need better
&gt; security than I have currently so I'd prefer a base where everything
&gt; was denied and has the most recent versions of sendmail, dns etc etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm intrigued to hear about FreeBSD being a more stable option (now
&gt; I really _will_ start a war - sorry). Just for the record, I'm a dyed in the
&gt; wool linux fan - I've used it since kernel version 0.10 (not a typo - this was
&gt; before login shells were available - I did my masters thesis using it and
&gt; TeX) - but I'm certainly eager to hear good information. Perhaps off-list
&gt; replies could be considered for those wishing to avoid flames :)
&gt; 
&gt; thanks for your patience,
&gt; ted

The TL server Edition should fulfil your requirements. The server
version has multiple install configuration for a specific requirement of
install ie firewall, mail server, intranet server, etc so you can pick a
install that you require for that particular device, you can go further
in the install option and pick and choice what you require with our
package manager checjing for required dependencies. The server installs
secure, all services are turned off and tcp_wrapper is active. You can
also active Tripwire for intursion detection. 

The TL server product is targetted at the Enterprise Backend for its
feature set and the $3000 US worth of bundled product.

I cannot say much about FreeBSD as I currently playing with it. 

regards

Michael
