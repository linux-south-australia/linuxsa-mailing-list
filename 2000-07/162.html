<PRE>
Brenda Aynsley of the Australian Computer Society has provided me with this
user group address in my quest for Unix C and Windows Developers to join our
rapidly growing company.

ATTENTION ALL UNIX C AND WINDOWS DEVELOPERS - ADELAIDE BASED POSITIONS

The Pracom Group urgently needs innovative and creative UNIX C and Windows
C++ Developers that are excited by cutting edge technology in the
telecommunications industry.

Pracom delivers innovative telecommunication and technology solutions
globally. Rapid growth in the demand for our products in Australia and Asia
has resulted in the creation of multiple Developer positions based in
Adelaide. Voice recognition, unified messaging and next generation mobile
services are just some of the products we are delivering.

To be suitable for our UNIX roles, you will need solid UNIX experience,
programming in C/C++ and shell type programming, and a thorough knowledge of
sockets, semaphores, streams and shared Ram IPC. Our Windows C++ position
also requires solid C++ programming and GUI development experience, and a
thorough knowledge of MFC and document/view architecture and sockets.

These roles provide you with a fantastic opportunity to develop and enhance
products and apply your skills in an environment that encourages innovative
thought.

We are offering a very attractive salary package to attract the right
people.

If you would like to know more, please contact Julie Short at Steadycom (a
subsidiary of Pracom) on 8202 9000, or email <A HREF="mailto:jshort@steadycom.com.au">jshort@steadycom.com.au</A>
