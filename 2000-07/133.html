Has anyone taken a look at the Code of Practice developed and approved
by the Internet Industry Association? Naturally there isn't an approved
"Linux/UNIX" net filter product..

What absolute bollocks! If anyone actually believes that the Liberal
Government is actually trying to stop CHILDREN from looking at PORN they
must have rocks in their head. As far as I can see they're trying to
stop GROWNUPS looking at PORN. Many "children" would know how to avoid,
turn off or otherwise defeat these moronic filter products - that
incidentally have a nasty tendency to filter out safer sex information
as well....

Who voted this right wing, conservative bunch of idiotic overseas
company lovers into this country?

Nazareth your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
 Like his father carving wood he'd have made good
 Tables chairs, and open chests would've suited Jesus best
 He'd caused nobody harm - noone alarm!
