&gt; &gt; Some people on this list are quite willing to scream blue murder when anyone
&gt; &gt; suggests modifying the subject line to include a '[LinuxSA]' tag for the
&gt; &gt; purposes of filtering, claiming that "we don't cater for broken email
&gt; &gt; clients".
&gt; &gt; These same people also get up in arms at the sight of HTML-ised
&gt; &gt; email, because their mail clients "don't support it".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This might be construed to be a little....Hypocritical?

&lt;re-entering fray&gt;

I don't see it as hypocritical.  I see it as people wanting to keep email simple
and light-weight.  Just how it originated.

Email is the most basic of communication options on the internet.  

Personally on the LinuxSA mailing list I'd like 7 bit ASCII, no html, no
coloured text, no flashing, no large graphics either.  I don't want .sigs that
include a photo of the sender.  I want to be able to read email on the road
using a text terminal if required.  I don't want to have to scroll my subject
line to see what the thread is all about.  These are my opinions, feel free to
have your own.

I'm not the administrator of this list so I can't enforce this.  Not that I'd
want to, that'd be censorship, very un-internet-like.  This list is a community
and we need to find some middle ground.  We've done these issues to death many
times, and the majority of people have agreed that email on this list is
preferred to be straight ASCII, not html, and that the subject line carries
useful information about the email and not noise for the purpose of filtering.

Feel free to disagree.  However let's not keep discussing this stuff forever. 
Linux is far more interesting than subject lines and html-erised email. 
Hopefully when we have an FAQ these issues will be resolved forever :-)

&lt;leaving fray&gt;
