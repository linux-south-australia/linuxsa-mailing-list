&gt; &gt; Although unlike X-whatevr headers, the subject line is easily

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is an advantge, imo.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also the fact that some piece of email comes from some list, is
&gt; &gt; arguably part of the subject matter - eg the subject of most email
&gt; &gt; on this list is linux related - the [blah] format is not out of
&gt; &gt; place in the subject line imo.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Would it hurt to cater to those who actually like the [blah] format?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is not as if it is difficult to do, I believe it is a standard
&gt; &gt; option in majordomo.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And some people might have different ideas on how their mailboxes
&gt; &gt; hsould be organised.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Eg I might want all my linux email in one box but like to know where
&gt; &gt; individiul pices of email originate - might.
&gt; 
&gt; Then you need a database driven mail client, that way you can select
&gt; different 'views' of your mailbox. You look at the linux 'folder' using a
&gt; filter that only displays mail from linuxSA using....
&gt; 
&gt; *drumroll*
&gt; 
&gt; "X-Loop:"!
&gt; 
&gt; It still doesn't change the fact that issues with mail clients are not
&gt; solved by changing the mail list subject field.

&lt;$2&gt;

Still doesnt change the fact that subject lines are customarily displayed
by all mail clients I hhave used.
None of them show X - whatver headers  by deafult.
And i dont really want full headr on, the headers tend to be much longer
than the messages in most cases.

And as I have suggested the list is arguably part of the subject matter,
so arguably it coudl go in the subject header without detracting fromt hat
header's utility.

Addig an extra unrequired header dos not solve the problem either, unless
you loke to organise you rmail using the smae methods that you use.
I don't. 
I guess that is too bad for me.

Why add extraneous headers when you can use one you already have?

As for whoever it was that suggested the clutter of putting [LinuxSA] in the 
subject line, there are less characters(clutter) in [LinuxSa] than there
are in the "X-Mailing-List"  name part of the X... header, let alone the
value.

&gt; 
&gt; I'll just say it again as some people don't seem to be groking this
&gt; concept.

I suspect what you mnean is not so much people aren't grokking, but people
arent argreeing with you, this of course is a two way thing.

&gt; 
&gt; The Subject: field is for...   The subject.
&gt; 
&gt; The X-Mailing-List: field is for...	The mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; The X-Loop: field is for...	Filtering.
&gt; 
&gt; You have the information you need so use it as you see fit to get the
&gt; results that you need. If you can't get your mail client to do what
&gt; you need it to do with these mail headers then get_a_new_mailclient();

Maybe - after all I don't NEED to filter at all, it is just a conveneince.

I might have what I NEED, but so do you without with X headers - you mail
with be delivered without them - you seem to find them convenient.

I don't. I find [blah} convenient..

But I am deprived of my convenience, while you have yours.

I guees you voice is louder where it matters, so be it. 
But please don't mistake disagrement with your point of view or a
different interpretation with not understanding.

And as I asked would it actually hurt to have [BLAH} for those of us who
like it?

After all we have to put up with these useless undesirable(to us) non
standard X... headers for your convience - cant you put up withour little 
indulgence?

I think the perl community has a saying soemthing like there are many ways
to do it. 
It seems applicable here.
