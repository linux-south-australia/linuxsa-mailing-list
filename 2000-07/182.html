&gt; A typical ifconfig ppp0 - does this look ok?
&gt; 
&gt; ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol

No. Not at all. Your problem looks like the errors and the frame. If I
get more than 1 error per 10000 RX Packets I start to look for what is
going wrong. Also, your "frame" is 199 extra than mine but I'm not
certain what "frame" refers to (i.e. I'll have to RTFM about it).

Just out of interest, why is adlax1.optusnet in there twice? I would
have thought that it would have been in there once. Also, why has it
appeared as a domain name in the default RATHER than an IP address... I
know that what I've said isn't exactly helpful but these appear
"different to normal" to me and they might help someone else discover
your problem.

&gt; What console tools would _you_ be using to diagnose the above problem/s?
&gt; Please let me know and I'll do some reading :-)

Well, you look like you've been using some reasonable console tools to
fix it. RedHat 6.2, as I understand it, does some things differently to
its predecessors and I haven't looked into it TOTALLY yet. Nonetheless I
haven't heard that it acts as dismally as you describe.

&gt; Also, I've looked around freshmeat.net but I can't find a small console ppp
&gt; data throughput meter.  Does anyone use something like this?

Did you use to use Optus before? There used to be talk around the town
that they weren't an entirely "fast" service provider. 

&gt; ps:  Everything I try to compile comes up with errors like this:
&gt; 
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:root@mail">root@mail</A> xifmon]# make

&lt;big snip&gt;

Those problems here appear to be a lack of X development libraries.
They're probably NOT installed on a default installation.

&gt; 
&gt; or this
&gt; 
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:root@mail">root@mail</A> PPPStatus-v0.3.7]# make

&lt;big snip&gt;

Again, that is a lack of development libraries. I notice that you don't
show "./configure". If the package you are compiling has a file named
"configure" in the main directory of that package, type "./configure"
and it should tell you a little bit about what's missing.

It might say, for example, "gtk+ library version 1.00 needed but
missing. please install gtk+ version 1.00 development headers" or some
similar thing....

To find out if your system is REALLY, REALLY broken try compiling the
hello world:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  printf("Hello world!\n");
  return 0;
}

with gcc -o hello hello.c

DAVID 
&gt; Is it time to reinstall this baby from scratch?

 He'd caused nobody harm - noone alarm!
