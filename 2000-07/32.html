Agreed totally.  The big issue here is that IDE sucks donkeys' balls.
End of story :-)

It has been "designed" (and I use that word lightly) as a cheap-and-nasty
lowest-common-denominator way of attaching a hard disk to an ISA-bus
PC, and subsequent versions have been bolted-on to non-ISA systems by
butchering that thing which passed for a specification to make it even
more perverse and arcane.  Why is it that you can pick up any SCSI 
controller and expect it to work with any SCSI drive, but the IDE interface
"standard" is so ritually buggered by so many vendors that every general
purpose OS on the market ships with basic features like IDE DMA turned
off by default because they can't be assumed to work at all?

Anyone who is serious about running a high performance server is 
*strongly* recommended to use SCSI.  Ignore benchmarks which claim a 
higher megabyte-per-second value for IDE drives;  They're meaningless,
because usually servers are more interested in I/O transactions per
second, not megabytes-per-second, and SCSI will always deliver more
I/Os per second than a comparable IDE drive because of innovations like
tagged command queueing, basic things which IDE can't hold a candle to.

IDE drives will happily provide the illusion of better performance on a
single-user system, until you try to put "real" load through them (the
reason they look like they're giving better performance is because it's
rather difficult for a single user to put "real" load through them during
day-to-day activities).  As soon as you put an IDE disk on a multi-user
server, though, expect performance to drop through the floor.

... and let's not even mention the performance implications of swapping
on an IDE drive, shall we?  Thank you.
