Morning all,
    Now I am a complete novice when it comes to Linux (Read: I'd never even
seen the thing on a running box till I installed it onto my thing at home 2
days ago), so be gentle. I'm having an absolute BALL trying to get
everything running, as I expected, aand as I also expected, the two main
problems are my Modem and Soundcard. The modem I'll be able to sort myself,
I mean, I even have the machine recognising that it exists already (its a
KTX internal) and once it figures how to talk to my ISP I'll be sweet, but
the soundcard looks as if its gonna be a protracted battle. Its a Yamaha
OPL3-SA. I can't even get the machine to recognise that anything is plugged
in at all. I've seen some solutions online, but all of them seem to assume a
hybrid Win/Linux box that can use the windows installation to find the
address (IRQ etc) of the card. I've done a complete Linux (Corel flavour)
install, so I don't have any Windows settings to look at.
Help?

I suppose a bit more info is in order as to WHY I would be trying to do
this. I'm a Pharmacist who owns my own pharmacy here in NZ, and at work
(where I am writing this) I run Win98. and i am HEARTILY sick to death of
bloody bluescreens. I maintain my machine to death with Norton etc etc, but
still it falls apart. The reason I run the dreaded Microsuck product, is
that my proprietary Pharmacy software needs it. For now. Once the port of
Borland's Delphi database language is done, it is likely (hopefully) that
the program may run under Linux, or at least be much easier and more likely
to be ported. BAsically I am after reliability here, and so I figured it
can't hurt to have a bash at learning some of the basics. I'm rapidly
findiong that there are stuff all "basics" to Linux though. *grin*
