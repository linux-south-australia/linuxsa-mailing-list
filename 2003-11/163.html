Hi guys,

There's been so many posts on this issue, I guess it can be considered 'on
topic' now.  *Grins*

Touching this subject lightly - due to the respect it deserves - I'd just
like to say that while I will be promoting the observation of this minute at
my work (Optus Corporate and Government Sales) I'd also like to say that the
recurring theme of the yearly minute we observe (lest we forget) brings with
it the danger of not allowing the hatred and anger to rest with those
departed.

Let me quantify that for those that might missunderstand:

    * I agree that the sacrifices of those that fought to ensure freedom
SHOULD be solemnly contemplated, respected and remembered.
    * I agree that we SHOULD promote the study/understanding of the events
of the past - to ensure that such mistakes are NOT repeated in the future.

HOWEVER; I also think we should be dilligent in taking caution that whilst
we remember those that died to fight off imperialism, facism, communism and
other 'evils' - that we do not blame and/or victimise the descendants of
those that died at the hand of those that our deceased fought.  For one of
the primary risks we take in 'not forgetting' - is in also not FORGIVING...

My observation (in places all around Australia) is that an embarrasing
majority who observe the phrase "Lest we forget" - also seem to interpret
that phrase as going hand in hand with "Lest we forgive"  And for those of
you that dissagree, I'd wonder how many Vietnamese, Kambodians, Japanses,
Chinese and/or any other South East Asians you've ever seen who are active
members of the RSL - and or any other white anglo saxon Australian
Organisation for returned servicemen in this nation...

Personally speaking - I don't know any Asians who fought against
Australia/America/Briton (or their Allies) and I don't suspect any people
reading this post do either.  My 'argument' accordingly, is that while we
honour the dead tomorrow, who gave the ultimate sacrifice for civil rights
and personal freedom from persecution - let's not cheapen their sacrifice by
persecuting fellow human beings, equally as innocent as the people they died
to preserve that right for.

&gt; Hi Pigeon,
&gt;
&gt; &gt; it is important to
&gt; &gt; remember those who died in them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Thank you Pigeon, that was my aim.
&gt;
&gt; I missed the ballot for Vietnam and later when I was free of schooling
&gt; I tried to sign up but was rejected 3 times. Such is life. I still
&gt; respect people like my father and so many others who put their life in
&gt; danger so we could grow up free. One minute of reflection really isn't
&gt; too big an ask.
&gt;
&gt;  Cheers,
&gt;  Ian
