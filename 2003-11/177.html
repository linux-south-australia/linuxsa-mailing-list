Alex,

&gt; Are you wanting to only recruit businesses to this new organisation?
&gt; Because an "Open Source Business Network - SA" sounds as if it precludes
&gt; any individuals joining as members.

Not necessarily - Open Source Victoria has quite a few individuals as its
members.

&gt; IMHO it would be more advantageous to form an open source lobby group
&gt; that encourages anyone and everyone to become a member rather than
&gt; excluding a large proportion of the potential supporter base by an
&gt; ill-chosen name.

An open source lobby group is a good idea. However, an open source lobby
group might not have the same focuse as an open source group of businesses
- who may act more like a chamber of commerce rather than a lobby group.

For example, would hosting business seminars about effective open
source marketing methods be within a lobby groups charter? It could be,
but some might argue that's not lobbying.

In South Australia there are a number of open source groups:

 * RecycleIT South Australia
   [also known as Computerbank Australia Inc (SA)]
 * The Community Software Distribution Network
 * LinuxSA
 * BUGA
 * The Unix lunch group
 * The AUUG local chapter

To a certain extent, Airstream Wireless Inc is also part of that community
but only because they use a lot of open source software.

So we have:

 * a computer refurbishiung group
 * a software distribution group
 * a social group with a strong linux technical focus
 * a social group with a strong BSD focus
 * a social group with a strong Unix focus whose been in existence for
   years
 * The AUUG

...but we don't have any groups who lobby nor any groups whose aim is to
improve the lot of business or share business acumen.

OSBN-SA may choose, at times, to lobby particular groups or the
government, but I doubt that will be its only charter. It will be a
network of businesses, and individuals who support its charter, but not
quite as generic as I think you're suggesting.

But you *are* right - there doesn't appear to be any effective open source
lobby group in South Australia.
