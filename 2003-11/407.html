David,

&gt; Well... I've been lurking long enough to start to get a feel for the
&gt; group (I now have about a months experience with Redhat/Linux and this
&gt; group) and have been especially encouraged to see that all
&gt; semi-intelligent questions are answered...  HOPEFULLY this post falls
&gt; into that catagory.  *Grins*

Possibly.

&gt; My question is this:  Since I know that I can use my Linux Distro
&gt; (Redhat 9) to act as (amongst other things) a DNS/Proxy/Web Server - I
&gt; would like to know if I can use a non-static IP address to host the
&gt; domain that I own on one of the four boxes on my home network...

Yes.

&gt; Let me be as specific as I can so that there's no confusion: My ADSL
&gt; connection is through Internode.  My understanding (I haven't confirmed
&gt; with Internode) is that I do not have a static IP, and that every time I
&gt; dissconnect and/or reboot my ADSL Modem/Router I automaticly get
&gt; assigned a different 'Master' IP address by them.

It's not guaranteed to be the same; often it will be. Also, unless you've
configured the modem to give the internal machines the same IP address by
DHCP if they are using the modem's DHCP server, then they *might* get a
new address. It's unlikely but again not guaranteed.

&gt; So, to get to the point: I 'own' a domain (a .com.au address) and what I
&gt; would like to know is: Can I configure/Port forward (or whatever) one of
&gt; my Linux Redhat 9 boxes, to host the domain that I own so that
&gt; regardless of how many times I connect/dissconect from Internode, a
&gt; person going to my URL ( EG: <A HREF="http:www.mydomain.com.au">http:www.mydomain.com.au</A> ) and/or sending
&gt; me an E-Mail ( <A HREF="mailto:newbie@mydomain.com.au">newbie@mydomain.com.au</A> ) will always arrive at the Redhat
&gt; 9 box I'm using to host my domain on - regardless of how many times I
&gt; reboot/reset my Modem/Router's connection to Internode?

I think what you're talking about is what is known as "dynamic DNS". I
found this HOWTO on Google:

One of the well-known Dynamic DNS peopler are:

I have the same situation and use them with my billion modem to Adam.
