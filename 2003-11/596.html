&gt; &gt; Does anyone have a high amp power cord for a ups that they are willing
&gt; &gt; to sell second hand ? It is a IEC-320 C19 (16 amp) cable.
&gt; 
&gt; The easiest way to get those cables is to call APC in Sydney and order one.

Thanks, I am just trying to do it on the cheap.

&gt; &gt; The type of cable I am after is like <A HREF="http://pcau.com/l3/APC0266.php">http://pcau.com/l3/APC0266.php</A>
&gt; &gt; but with a standard wall power point male connector on one end and the
&gt; &gt; c19 female on the other.
&gt; 
&gt; These things are often special cables for a reason - standard power outlets in
&gt; Australia are only rated for 10 or 15 amps, such a cable should at least have a
&gt; larger than normal earth pin if you insist on plugging it into a socket that
&gt; wasn't designed for it. UPS's can pull a lot of current when they're charging
&gt; the batteries, which may trip a breaker and cause you the very problem a UPS is
&gt; supposed to guard against.

Thanks for that, I was ignorant of the 10 amp rating on the power
outlets until tonight.

Basically, I want to use this 3000va UPS for some servers for
Computerbank to host it's own site, etc. It is overkill, but was the
right price.

Thanks for the advice
