&gt; Uh, what about VisiCalc by Dan Bricklin & Bob Frankston? It first
&gt; appeared on 1979 and has a much more serious claim to being the
&gt; world's first 'electronic spreadsheet.'
&gt;
&gt; Lotus 1-2-3 was a VisiCalc wannabe that had one significant advantage
&gt; over VisiCalc: it ran on the XT before VisiCalc did. (VisiCalc
&gt; started life on the Apple II.)

Yeah I was talking out of my arse at that stage. I quick google didn't give
 me the information I needed on early spreadsheet/wordprocessor programs.

&gt; For more info see &lt;<A HREF="http://bricklin.com/visicalc.htm&gt">http://bricklin.com/visicalc.htm&gt</A>;.
&gt;
&gt; This may appear to be nit-picking but, when scolding others (ie The
&gt; Advertiser*) for their innaccuracy, it fatally damages your
&gt; credibility when you make basic errors in your scold.

Oh I completely expected to be picked up on that point by somebody as I
 wasn't sure lotus 1-2-3 was the first spreadsheet program, nor had I done
 any significant research on the matter. It matters not, however, because
 what I wrote will not see the light of day outside of the LinuxSA mailing
 list.

&gt;     Advertiser in the past and wrote a computer column for
&gt;     The Sunday Mail in the early-1990s. I've never been a
&gt;     News Limited employee, however.
