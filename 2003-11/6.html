&gt; It just stops and disconnects from the line once it has dialled.

&gt; I have X3 in the init string anyway.

&gt; I think the problem is deeper down than the init string but I am not
&gt; sure just what it might be.

I have seen some cases where something extra has been sent by the
ppp/chat process which knocks the modem back on-hook (e.g. an
extra carriage return, or chat not waiting long enough).  I don't
know esmith, but have you been able to find any ppp or chat logs
lying around that are of any use?  /etc/syslog.conf might point
the way here, plus any debug settings you can set on the dialler.
