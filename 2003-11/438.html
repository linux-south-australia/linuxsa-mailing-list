&gt; &gt; SCO Unix is dead in the water, they say as much themselves.

&gt; Obviously.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I find I am not deeply worried about the chance of a negative outcome.
&gt; &gt; Not because it isn't possible, but because the open source community
&gt; &gt; will prevail regardless of the outcome. They have said from the start,
&gt; &gt; "show us your code so we can remove it, we don't want it", and once SCO
&gt; &gt; identifies it (if it is even there, which I doubt), it will get removed.
&gt; 
&gt; /me sigh
&gt; 
&gt; But this only proves that there IS stolen code in the open 
&gt; source code base. Which makes ALL installations of open source 
&gt; material suspect. I'm not sure whether *this* would actually 
&gt; do us any good at all.

bzzt* Huh? 

What statement exactly are you suggesting proves that there IS stolen code?

Nothing I have seen suggests that there is, except for the flunky
statements without any effective evidence from SCO.

The fact that the OSS community says 'show us the code so we can remove
it' is not evidence it is in fact in there, it's evidence that it's
_possible_ that there is code in the kernel that came from Unix, or
perhaps looks identical to Unix code but was independantly created. It's
a statement of good faith by the community, nothing more.

It is just as possible, perhaps more so, that there is code from Linux
in SCO Unix. This certainly happened in the BSD case.

The only 'proof' of anything is that it is not possible to emphatically
know either way unless you have access to unix code, and the kernel
developers don't want to see it for obvious reasons.
