&gt;&gt;&gt;SCO is intent on milking it for all it's worth to make money.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;"SCO's case against IBM has now been set for March 11, 2005 in a Utah
&gt;&gt;courtroom."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;.... what the hell?  I thought the original court date was sometime
&gt;&gt;early next year (although I haven't been paying close attention).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They apparently asked for it to be put off.  This confuses me.  My
&gt; theory is that SCO won't be there in a year's time.  This action
&gt; suggests that they know something else.  Or maybe they know that, once
&gt; the case opens, it will collapse pretty soon, and in the meantime they
&gt; want to make as much money as possible.

Their entire strategy seems to discredit Open Source, at any cost (even 
their own reputation), full stop.  They're probably damn sure they 
haven't really got a leg to stand on in a courtroom, considering their 
tactics, but the longer the court date is put off, the more time they 
have to bullshit (and they've been at least partially successful, 
unfortunately).

&gt; I'm wondering what they're going to pull out of their hats next.  If
&gt; they sue a "major Linux user", what evidence are they going to use?  I
&gt; suspect that that case, too, will be drawn out (which, of course,
&gt; means that it will cost the user money, which isn't good).

Their previous games are standing proof that seemingly, you don't even 
/need/ evidence (to scare people).
