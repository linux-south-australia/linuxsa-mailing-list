&gt;
&gt; We might have to go back to the good old days where companies actually
&gt; had IS staff who knew how to patch operating systems, fix problems,
&gt; look under the hood and in an emergency "Ring a Friend" [who might be
&gt; the open source community] and get help.
&gt;
&gt; *heh*


Right.  Good for people who have a clue (instead of MCSEs :-)


&gt; I'm not sure whether this is a good move or not. If that community
&gt; uses, say, Fedora at home then they might feel more comfortable using
&gt; Fedora at work. Or Debian at work...
&gt;
&gt; We'll have to wait and see.


Right.  I agree, it's a bold move by Red Hat, they may lose lots of market
share, but the worst case is they go under, and the community continues
building upon the excellent GPL software they've developed.  The best case
is that they gain community and Red Hat Linux becomes all the more user
friendly.

[Aside: I like what they're doing kernel-wise with Fedora.  Lots of
deviation from RHEL since corporate customers aren't the target anymore]

&gt; Another area that this could have drawbacks as far as RedHat goes is
&gt; that TAFE's might start using a community distribution for teaching
&gt; especially if the RedHat is too expensive to buy. And we all know that
&gt; students will generally stick with what's familiar, so if they've been
&gt; shown how to administer a system using Debian GNU/Linux they're more
&gt; likely to stay with a Debian GNU/Linux based system.
&gt;
&gt; I think this move by RedHat bodes well in a corporate sense but is it
&gt; good for the Linux/Open Source Community?


I'd say yes.  Fedora appears to be trying to be an up to date version of
Debian (pun unintended).  Red Hat will provide some direction and fund the
manpower to push out releases regularly (so "stable" won't be so ancient
:-) but the contributions and some of the direction come from the
community.

OOo took a while to balance community and corporate, as did Mozilla.  It
will be interesting to see how it goes with Fedora.

I'm hopeful - so much that I've switched to running Fedora (beta).  But if
things turn to custard, I might make the switch to Debian.
