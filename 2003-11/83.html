&gt; &gt; Hi Damien
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; With your computer turned off you can clean the dust out of it
&gt; &gt; with a paint brush and then vacuum up the loose dirt. You need
&gt; &gt; to ask yourself why your computer is getting so dusty.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The Acer burner also being on the same bus (IDE) as the dodgy hard
&gt; &gt; drive, it could be the motherboard.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Robyn
&gt;
&gt; Just out of interest, is the hard disk and burner on the same cable? If
&gt; so, try a new cable, putting the disk on it's own cable, and see if it
&gt; helps.

The drive was on its own cable, and the DVD ROM and burner were on the other. 
I've moved the DVD ROM to share the HDD's cable, and the burner is now by 
itself (this was a failed attempt at fixing the burner). I turned off 
supermount with the burner too, but after a while of being on, the green CD 
IN light turned on and the drive wouldn't eject. So I unplugged the power 
again. I might give my burner to somebody else to try out for a while...

Cheers,

Damien
