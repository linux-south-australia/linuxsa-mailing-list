Michael,

&gt; &gt; "But if SCO does turn up with code that it wrote and did not 
&gt; &gt; give away, but it is indeed in the kernel, then it actually 
&gt; &gt; proves that SCO is correct."
&gt; 
&gt; Umm. That is correct. You are suggesting that if SCO were able to prove
&gt; their case, they would have a case. Would you have it any other way?

*grumble*

And this would be a bad thing.

&gt; &gt; Which of course befuddles the matter totally :(
&gt; 
&gt; For those who wish it so. Kernel developers don't want to see unix code
&gt; to avoid taint and IP claims like those being made now.

You have one side who won't say what they're on about and the other side
who wouldn't look even if they were allowed to. This situation would make
a good comedy if it weren't so serious.

&gt; /me thinks that David is having one of his obtuse days.

LOL
