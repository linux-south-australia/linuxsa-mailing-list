Simon,

&gt; Unfortunately, this is probably my biggest gripe with qmail, it uses so
&gt; many unusual (for redhat/debian) things.

Oh? In what manner? 

&gt; qmail setup is quite easy (try www.qmailtoaster.com), but debugging what
&gt; was wrong when I broke it drove me nuts. Restore from your backup you
&gt; say. Good call, but in true backup tradition, I'd backed up /etc
&gt; /usr/local and all but the $*^$#% /var/qmail directory ;-/.

I haven't done much with qmail but there must surely be ways to recompile
it to get it in a more sane place. Besides which, don't take me the wrong
way, isn't the fact that your backups didn't backup what you wanted or
needed your fault and not qmail's ;-?

&gt; &gt; I have done a lot of reading on the web and am leaning to Qmail as it
&gt; &gt; seems to have been built ground up to be secure, fast and easier to
&gt; &gt; configure (fast and easy to configure are the main points for me).
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that was my thought as well. Qmail also has some nice admin addons,
&gt; which i've had installed and used, and vpopmail is sweet for virtual
&gt; hosting.

Apparently, also, qmail handles queued mail extraordinarily quickly. But
that's what I've heard - I've never setup a mail server where huge queues
might be a problem.

&gt; &gt; Postfix on the other hand seems to have been somewhat handicapped by
&gt; &gt; remaining compatible with Sendmail (though this could be considered an
&gt; &gt; advantage).
&gt; 
&gt; Postfix seems to do all the qmail can do, and its much more
&gt; understandable.

:-)

&gt; Disclaimer: I looked at exim, and it didn't _feel_ right ;-)

Fair enough. Exim is the default mailer for Debian, though, so I'm sure
it's not that bad.
