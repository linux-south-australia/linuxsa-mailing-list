MS Sharepoint 2003. (would work with some major file movement)
*me tunnels to a remote underground bunker and quivers in fear!

No seriously how about phpnuke, phpgroupware or something like that.
Although it is possibly more/different functionality that you require. Most
education places run Netware so making the assumption they they do too,
maybe something like iPortal for authentication/iFolders to access the data
would be perfect. Fully encrytped and would mesh with the existing
infrastructure. Hopefully im allowed to suggest Netware, as they have
intimate links with Linux now :)

Another option would be VPN.. Then they authenticate as they would at
school.

Gotta like edugateway, its just what they need.
Either way all the solutions are simple and effective.
Many thanks again guys.

A friend of mine works for an education establishment and asked me the
following question (see below).
Does anyone have any bright ideas? What do other people use...
I suppose the end result has to be simple and secure.

Hello,
We are looking at giving our current Student file server the boot. (the
whole Latis system which is managed by ...)

 What we are looking for is a solution that will give our students access to
their files from home using a web browser. But it has to be secure (SSL?)


What would you recommend ?
