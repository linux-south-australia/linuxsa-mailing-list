&gt; Do you have any idea how many schools refuse the license packs?

I don't know of any, and I don't think you can. The Microsoft lease
agreement is a departmental agreement, not an individual school agreement.
So we have no choice but to pay for the lease. It also means it's not a case
of just not paying, you sort of have to know how the Education Department
works to understand what I mean.

For you interest the cost to the school is determined per student, so the
more students at the school, the more it costs. I cannot tell you how much
the schools I work for pay, but it's enough to buy a few extra computers per
year.

As for SINA I'm not sure what they use and to be honest I'm beyond caring.
The contract is up and we will see change soon, but the logistics are huge,
so I doubt anything major will happen for a few years. I've been wrong
before though.
