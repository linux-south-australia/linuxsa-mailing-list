I take your point Alex. But I think Linux has great broad representation
through Linux Australia, our own fairly informal LinuxSA and AUUG.

I think OSBN-SA would be better served if it didn't try and do too much.
If it became another excuse for beer and pizza (as worthy as that is) it
might lose some kick.

I think I would like to see OSBN-SA lobbying business and government to
take open source seriously and breaking down barriers where they exist.

But I think individuals employed in the use of open source and free 
software should have a voice as well. Perhaps OSBN-SA could have 
memberships for business, employees and associates. Associates being for 
enthusiasts and students. Employees allowing people working under the 
radar in their company to have a voice.

&gt;&gt; On this weekend I will be putting out a quiet call for interest to
&gt;&gt; form the first members of the "Open Source Business Network - SA".
&gt;&gt; I have the mailing lists for it up and running but rather than
&gt;&gt; setting its
agenda for
&gt;&gt; business in South Australia, the first businesses involved will be
able to
&gt;&gt; determine the type of group OSBN-SA becomes.

&gt; 
&gt; Are you wanting to only recruit businesses to this new organisation? 
&gt; Because an "Open Source Business Network - SA" sounds as if it
&gt; precludes any individuals joining as members. IMHO it would be more
&gt; advantageous to form an open source lobby group that encourages
&gt; anyone and everyone to become a member rather than excluding a large
&gt; proportion of the potential supporter base by an ill-chosen name.
