Hey all...

Just updating what stuff is still here. I'm still wanting to get rid of as much 
of it as possible as quickly as I can. Please drop me a line if you are 
interested in anything, so we can negotiate.

- 4-Way Computer Control Switch - Accepts one computer with four keyboard, 
mouse, and RGB inputs or outputs, depending on which way you want to use it. 
Basically control 4 computers with one keyboard, mouse and monitor. Offers 
around $50.

- 2x LG 52x CD-ROM Drives - $20 each

- Two PS/2 Keyboards - $10 each

- D-Link DFM-560E 56k External Modem - $40

There is also some audio componentry that you guys might be interested in.

- Denon DN-610F Professional Audio Component - Includes a CD Player (20 Second 
AntiSkip) and Single Tape Deck in the one unit. Very high quality and 
professional device, retails for over $1000, will sell for offers around $300.

- Technics Stereo Integrated Amplifier - 175 Watts per Channel, a variety of 
inputs and 2x Left and Right Outputs - VERY good amplifier, takes whatever you 
throw at it. Offers around $200 

All offers will be considered. Look forward to hearing from you all!

- Adam
