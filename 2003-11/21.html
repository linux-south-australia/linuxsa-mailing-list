I have gotten myself slightly befuddled. 

 1. A Basic Auth to a web-site with SSL on won't send the
    username/password across in clear?

 2. Is it possible to get stupidly paranoid and require this:

    - premise: I want to get to:
      <A HREF="http://stupidly.secure.com/">http://stupidly.secure.com/</A>

    Is it possible for this site to require:

    * an SSL encrypted tunnel (i.e. free swan style)

    * a properly signed certificate
      - for the web server

    * furthermore a basic or digest auth over ALL the SSLs

Is there any point in having the *two* SSL tunnels? In fact, if you have
the first SSL tunnel when would the web-server SSL be needed at all?

In other words, I want to make a stupidly secure, ultra paranoid web-site.
I'd like to be able to do this:

 * Give someone an SSL certificate
   - but I don't trust them totally

 * So, I make them enter their user name and password
   - but they only get to do this if they present me with a VALID SSL
     certificate

I assume this is possible but it's the second part I'm worried about. If
that part goes over clear text then we might as well forget the SSL bits
and pieces in the first place.

My reading of all the documentation is that it isn't, and that you'll need
to be very very very careful that the second part is going over SSL
(probably on the default port 443) to your web server.

Can anyone confirm this?
