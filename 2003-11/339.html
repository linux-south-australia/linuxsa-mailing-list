&gt; this from a man obviously on drugs. mcbride has reality issues.

I disagree, I think he's just evil.  The problem is when you read that 
article you can figure out it's all about the money.  He doesn't care about 
morality or logic, just growing the share price.  

I quote randomly, but directly:

"Darl McBride: We are giving him 400,000 shares of stock and $1 million in 
cash. When I said we have $60 some million in cash [on hand at SCO], reduce 
the cash by $1 million and we take non-cash charge. David comes on, he's now 
a shareholder, he's rowing with us, and let's face it, he's added 
significant value to our company since February. Our stock was around a 
buck, now it's $14. That's some of the best money we've spent, not even 
money, some of the best stock we've issued. Now we're broadening our scope 
and going after the cleanup project."

and

"... As we look at monetizing this two-million-user installed base, we can
sell product for a $800 to $1,000 dollars, whatever. We're talking about a
couple of billion dollars in upgrade opportunities.
