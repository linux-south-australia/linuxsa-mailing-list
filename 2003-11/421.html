&gt; I think SCO is intent on destroying Unix to be honest. As more 
&gt; and more of these actions continue the more difficult it will 
&gt; be to convince the people that matter (who are not technical 
&gt; people nor understand this stuff) to switch to ANY Unix, even 
&gt; SCO OpenServer which is stupidly expensive.

SCO Unix is dead in the water, they say as much themselves.

Undoubtedly, there will be some careful folks that hold off until the
fire goes out. There are many organisations still making the decision
regardless of the SCO FUD. SCO's tactic seems to be to make outrageous
claims on a regular basis, and never effectively back them up.

There's a chance that they (SCO) will get told to put up or shut up in
early december. In the mean time, it seems the press is beginning to
understand what a pile of junk SCO's been selling them. A few minutes at
Groklaw will help to ease your stress, David.

I find I am not deeply worried about the chance of a negative outcome.
Not because it isn't possible, but because the open source community
will prevail regardless of the outcome. They have said from the start,
"show us your code so we can remove it, we don't want it", and once SCO
identifies it (if it is even there, which I doubt), it will get removed.

I watch the whole SCO fracas as one would watch a bug being drawn into
the insect zapper. Focused on the movement, entranced, knowing it will
get zapped, but unable to look away...
