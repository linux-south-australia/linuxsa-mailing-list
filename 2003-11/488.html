&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, this is probably my biggest gripe with qmail, it uses so
&gt; &gt; many unusual (for redhat/debian) things.
&gt; Oh? In what manner?

It doesn't use /etc/init.d/ or /etc/inittab to run the services, it uses some 
special daemon thing, which does the job based on the /service/ directory. I 
forget the name of it.

&gt; I haven't done much with qmail but there must surely be ways to recompile
&gt; it to get it in a more sane place. Besides which, don't take me the wrong
&gt; way, isn't the fact that your backups didn't backup what you wanted or
&gt; needed your fault and not qmail's ;-?

Oh, yes, could have done all that, and no it was my fault, but if I was going 
to reinstall, I thought i'd try postfix, and hopefully avoid qmail screwing 
up again.

&gt; Apparently, also, qmail handles queued mail extraordinarily quickly. But
&gt; that's what I've heard - I've never setup a mail server where huge queues
&gt; might be a problem.

Yes, but we used to serve many thousands of emails a day on a lowly PIII 500 
with SCSI & sendmail. My dedicated host is a long way from getting that busy, 
and needing qmail for that reason ;-)

&gt; Fair enough. Exim is the default mailer for Debian, though, so I'm sure
&gt; it's not that bad.

Oh, I'm sure it works fine. It looks like ihug use it for all their smtp.

However, iiNet appear to use qmail.
