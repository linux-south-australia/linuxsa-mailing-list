Hey,

I am yet again having issues with my hard drive. Here is the story with my 
current computer:

First hard drive was a Western Digital Caviar, it did weird clicking things 
and would just stop working until I rebooted.

Second Hard drive was a Seagate 80GB 7200RPM, it got read errors after a 
while.

Third Hard drive (current drive) is the same as the second, and is having the 
exact same read problems.

This means I've already had two warranty replacements on hard drives, I'm 
starting to think they might think I'm doing something bad to them.

I'm getting the following errors with this drive:

Oct 31 23:46:03 thebeast kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:07 (hda), 
sector 52687784
Oct 31 23:46:07 thebeast kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady 
SeekComplete Error }
Oct 31 23:46:07 thebeast kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { 
UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=142185969, sector=52687784

This causes all apps wanting to use the hdd to pause (and I just had mozilla 
mail crash while it happened). It also means any data on those sectors is 
lost forever.

If I use the smartctl tools to test it, I get the following:

SMART Self-test log, version number 1
Num  Test_Description    Status  Remaining  LifeTime(hours) LBA_of_first_error
# 1  Short off-line   Completed: read failure     90%     608      0x08888198

So even the drive performing the self-test has read errors (this happened on 
drive number 2 also). So, is there a possibility there is something else 
wrong with my computer that is causing these hard drive errors? It seems 
strange for me to get 3 dodgy drives in a row.

Another problem that may be related, is one of my RAM modules seems to be a 
bit funny. On first power on, the NVRAM test gets to 380MB and then the 
machine resets. On second test, it passes ok. When I had the computer set to 
quickboot (ie, no NVRAM test), I would sometimes get the machine randomly 
rebooting  (under Linux). On one occasion, Kicker SIGSEGV'd just moments 
before it rebooted.

So could dodgy RAM be causing these issues? I ran memtest for an hour last 
night, and it didn't report any errors.

Thanks for any help, I'm getting desperate.

Damien
