I suppose I should put this thread to bed, even if it is most amusing
watching the responses.

The notice was put up some time back when we were going through the
?politics? of getting Linux into the institute. Those of you in the
government will know exactly what I?m talking about. One of the
concessions we had to make was limiting the use of Linux to access the
Internet because our servers could not ?properly control? access to
?illegal? web sites. A small price to pay in order to have Linux available
to people to use in the drop-in-centre.

Some of the more observant would have noted that it had nothing to do with
Linux usage, just accessing the Internet.

Linux/OSS is now an integral part of this Institute and has been embedded
into the Australian National Training Authority (ICA99) Training Package.
We even have a new national teaching module called ?Maintain Open Source?

Linux and OSS are marching into government departments relentlessly, all
the ministers have to do is stand back and not interfere. (and that, my
esteemed Linux colleagues is what they are good at)


Oh, btw, I think the person who put the pic up, was just trolling.
