&gt; I'm running Red Hat 9 and have had nothing but trouble
&gt; getting an internet connnection.  Despite reinstalling I still have
&gt; the following message coming up at boot time.
&gt; 
&gt; tried Network configration
&gt; Network card activation failed
&gt; Determining IP information for etho.....iptables
&gt; No chain/target/match by that name
&gt; failed iptables bad rule..........(does a matching rule
&gt; exist in that chain?)

What network card have you got? Is it setup in /etc/modules.conf
correctly?
You're getting the errors because the network card isn't setup
correctly. I'd suggest removing the network card, rebooting and make
sure kudzu removes the existing config for it, then replace the card and
run kudzu again. (kudzu is redhat's hardware detection tool, and should
run automatically at boot)

Once the network interface card is installed properly you need to setup
your networking properly. At a root prompt typing setup will start a
menu driven series of configuration tools, including networking. If in X
you could run redhat-config-network-druid (as root) or go to your menus,
System Tools -&gt; Internet Configuration Wizard.

&gt; 
&gt; I thought that reinstalling would have reset the iptables
&gt; but obviously hasn't.  As a relative newbie I have no idea
&gt; about iptables and have been unable to find any helpful information
&gt; on the net.  I've also tried unsuccessfully to activate the LAN card.

You can control iptables on the command line with the commands...

service iptables start
service iptables stop
service iptables save
service iptables status

Do service --status-all to see the full list.

To start/stop services like iptables for various run levels (see
/etc/inittab for an explanation of run levels) use the chkconfig
command.
i.e.
chkconfig --level 35 iptables on
or more simply...
chkconfig iptables on

Both chkconfig and the service command are the command line equivalents
of running ntsysv, or for the X gui run redhat-config-services or go to
your menus and find System Settings -&gt; Server Settings -&gt; Services.


&gt; 
&gt; I'm running a LAN with a windows 98 box and a Corega Bar SW Pro
&gt; router/Switching hub with a Yahoo BB ADSL connection.  I previously
&gt; had no problems running any of these computers and had to do little
&gt; if any configuration.

There are many good scripts that provide an instant lan for a linux
gateway machine. Here's a couple I've used....

<A HREF="http://monmotha.mplug.org">http://monmotha.mplug.org</A>
<A HREF="http://qtables.radom.org">http://qtables.radom.org</A>

The second one is called quicktables and has redhat installation
instructions so that you can do chkconfig quicktables on ; service
quicktables start commands. It's a good idea to do "service iptables
save" once your firewall/nat rules are working correctly.

&gt; 
&gt; The strange thing about this is that after giving up and leaving the box
&gt; alone for two or three months (maybe due to repairing the RPM database)
&gt; I managed to get a connection after logging on today.
&gt; The connection was lost after trying to register the system with Red Hat
&gt; Network.

The Redhat Network is soon to be redundant. Try using apt-get for redhat
instead from <A HREF="http://apt.freshrpms.net">http://apt.freshrpms.net</A>

&gt; 
&gt; Any Ideas people
&gt; 

Hope some of this has helped.
