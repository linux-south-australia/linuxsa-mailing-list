Asian first-timers prefer Linux to Windows
By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
Posted: 13/11/2003 at 10:46 GMT


  =20
Microsoft recently broke its global pricing policy for the Thai market,
offering steep discounts in the Royal Kingdom for its Windows and Office
products. From a report at Linux Insider, we learn why.=20

=46irst-time computer users are flocking to a government-subsidised =
programme
to bring cheap PCs to the public. Although pirate copies of Windows and
Office have a street price as low as $4, the information ministry's =
scheme
of selling PCs loaded with Linux and OpenOffice for $250 is a runaway
success. A million new PC owners will be using Linux within the next few
months.=20

"Charging Thai consumers nearly $600 for Windows/Office is the equivalent
of charging US consumers $3000," notes the report. But even at the
right-sized price of $37, Thai first-timers are preferring Linux. Which
also cites Linux's superior Right-to-Left support as a reason why the
ministry's computers are popular.=20

=46rom the report we can draw several, and some surprising conclusions. =
As a
business model, charging a software licence fee against a comparable free
rival is now, perhaps, a risky proposition. The oft-cited factors of =
global
brand appeal (Microsoft is one of the world's most recognised names) and
integration count for little in emerging markets.=20

This isn't to say Microsoft will disappear in a puff of smoke: with a =
cash
pile of $51 billion, it isn't going to go away anytime soon. And it can
conceivably switch, as IBM did, from dictating the market to shift to a
services model where it maintains legacy code: keeping it just about up =
to
date for incumbents to count the costs, and find it cheaper to stay where
they are. Microsoft's most valuable software asset right now is not any =
of
the interesting file system or user interface enhancements in Longhorn =
that
it unveiled at PDC, it's Windows Update. Keeping the worms and viruses at
bay is going to be a full-time job: probably one that ensures Microsoft's
long-term survival.=20

But in terms of simple economics: when a piece of software with an
expensive licence fee is pitched against a free rival of equivalent
functionality, the software with the licence fee will lose. And this
particularly applies to emerging markets in the East. Here in the =
occident,
we expect to hear "exit costs" to emerge as the dominant theme of =
Microsoft
marketing in the coming months and years.

TECHNOLOGY SPECIAL REPORT:
Microsoft Loses to Linux in Thailand Struggle=20
=20
By Jan Krikke
LinuxInsider.com=20
November 12, 2003=20

In the second quarter of 2003, just 40 percent of all desktop PCs shipped
in Thailand had a licensed copy of Windows installed, an all-time low =
that
likely will dip even further. Moreover, PC manufacturer Laser Computer =
has
replaced HP as Thailand's top PC seller. Laser Computer sells only Linux
PCs.=20

To prevent Linux  from running away with Thailand's subsidized "people's =
PC
project," Microsoft has dropped the price of its Windows and Office
packages from nearly US$600 to $37. Other Asian countries are lining up =
to
duplicate the Thai program. As a result of the events in Thailand, =
analysts
have begun to predict the end of Microsoft's long-standing
"one-price-fits-all-markets policy."=20
Significantly, first-time PC users in Thailand are finding the Linux Thai
Language Edition easier to master than Windows.=20

In a computer shop on the outskirts of Bangkok, Nalong Sripronsa is
teaching his assistant how to install Linux Thai Language Edition OS on a
secondhand Pentium PC. Nalong, manager of DCO Computer, has seen growing
interest in Linux since the Thai government launched its people's PC
project in May of this year.=20
The Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is =
offering
a million PCs preloaded with Linux StarOffice at rock-bottom prices to
increase computer literacy in Thailand.=20

"Many people in Thailand have never used a PC before," Nalong told
LinuxInsider. "They don't know the difference between Windows and Linux. =
If
you go from Windows to Linux, it seems difficult, but for first-time PC
users, the Thai edition of Linux is easier to learn than Windows." Nalong
added that Microsoft has neglected the Thai market. The company only
recently made Thai-language documentation available for beginners.=20
The people's PC project, formally known as the ICT PC Project,
revolutionized the Thai PC market, and its effect is being felt around =
the
region. The Ministry of ICT aims to sell 700,000 PCs and 300,000 =
notebooks
in the first year of the project. To make the PCs affordable, the
government has insisted that computer makers offer the machines at
fire-sale prices -- $250 for PCs and $400 for notebooks, including the
software.=20
The government did invite Microsoft to participate in the project, but =
the
company initially refused to lower its prices. Microsoft has a
long-standing policy of charging the same prices throughout the world,
which could help explain the widespread piracy in developing markets like
Thailand, where the average annual income is about $7,000. Charging Thai
consumers nearly $600 for Windows/Office is the equivalent of charging =
U.S.
consumers $3,000.=20

Pirates in Bangkok sell copies of Windows XP for $4 and Office XP for $8.
With Microsoft refusing to lower its prices, the Ministry of ICT turned =
to
Linux and StarOffice.=20
The rock-bottom prices -- and easy financing terms -- generated enormous
interest in the ICT PCs. An estimated 35,000 people showed up at a =
Bangkok
convention center where the machines were launched. Some people even =
camped
overnight to sign up for the program. By August of this year, Thai
consumers had snapped up 300,000 ICT PCs. Three regional computer clubs
joined forces to produce alternatives for those who were not qualified =
for
the ICT PC, offering similar PCs for a slightly higher price.=20

Microsoft Has Second Thoughts
Microsoft, faced with the prospect of a million Linux PCs, began to have
second thoughts about its pricing structure. With many students buying an
ICT PC, the company risked losing both market share and mind share to
Linux. Microsoft's newly appointed regional general manager, Andrew =
McBean,
no doubt having consulted Redmond, offered to supply the ICT PC Program
with the Windows/Office package for a mere $37 -- a price cut of 85
percent.=20

Gartner research director Martin Galliland, coauthor of the report "Thai =
PC
Market May Change Global Windows Landscape," told LinuxInsider that
Microsoft's concerns about Linux and piracy explain the company's change =
of
heart. "The price drop was clearly motivated by a feared loss of market
share for legal copies of Microsoft software," said Galliland.=20
While some buyers still will install pirated copies of Microsoft's
software, Gartner estimates that 70 percent of Thai consumers will stick
with Linux, citing freely available software, lower prices and lack of
knowledge among first-time PC owners.=20

Microsoft's Andrew McBean in Bangkok was not available for comment on the
company's decision to participate in the ICT PC project.=20

Gilliland said Gartner has been contacted by several other Asian =
countries
wanting to duplicate the Thai initiative. "The apparent success of the =
Thai
ICT project has spawned some interest in other emerging markets, and they
have approached Gartner with very early statements of interest," =
Galliland
told LinuxInsider. He refused to identify the countries involved. In what
could signal an ominous sea change for Microsoft, nearly all countries in
the region are developing localized versions of Linux.=20
Gartner had more bad news for Microsoft. In the second quarter of 2003,
just 40 percent of all desktop PCs shipped in Thailand had a licensed =
copy
of Windows installed, an all-time low that Gartner expects will dip even
further. Moreover, PC manufacturer Laser Computer has replaced HP (NYSE:
HPQ)  as Thailand's top PC seller. Laser Computer sells only Linux PCs =
and
has been growing at an annual rate of 300 percent.=20

Nalong Sripronsa at DCO Computer believes Linux will take market share =
from
Microsoft. "Even people who do not qualify for the ICT PC program think
Microsoft is just too expensive. Schoolteachers make only about $300 per
month. How can they afford to pay $600 for Microsoft software? That's =
more
than the cost of a basic PC. For a few dollars you can buy a Linux CD =
with
all the applications you need."
