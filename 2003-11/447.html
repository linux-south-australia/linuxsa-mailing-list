&gt; Currently running:

There is no 550MHz Celeron, this is almost certainly a PIII CPU.

&gt; Looking to upgrade to:
&gt; 1.4GHz Intel Celeron Tualatin CPU w/100MHz FSB Socket 370
&gt; 2 x 128MB PC100 RAM

CPU won't work - see below.

&gt; The laptop has a plain ZIF socket for the CPU, so my thoughts are that
&gt; this should be an easy process of unplugging the old cpu & inserting the
&gt; new one.

Yep, that's probably going to be the easy part. :)

&gt; I have researched the new CPU to the point that it matches the old CPU
&gt; in terms of Socket type & FSB speed, but have I missed something ?

You won't be able to use a Tualatin CPU, they require specific motherboard
(and BIOS?) support that your system won't have, given its age.

Aside from the above, you need to verify support for the CPU voltage. It's
possible you might also run into BIOS issues (if the BIOS fails to identify
the CPU, it may not run at all). If you haven't already you should go to
this site:

<A HREF="http://processorfinder.intel.com/">http://processorfinder.intel.com/</A>

and enter the sSpec number of your current CPU, this will give you a
definitive answer for exactly what it is and will help you to verify
compatibility of any CPU you're thinking of buying (always obtain the sSpec
of the CPU you're thinking of getting). You will still have to consider BIOS
compatibility and there may be issues specific to your particular model
(e.g. cooling capability may limit the fastest CPU your model can take
safely). You should also check for any BIOS upgrades, these are sometimes
needed to recognise newer CPUs (than those that were available/anticipated
at the time the BIOS was released).

&gt; Would be interested in any replies, particularly any who have made a
&gt; similar upgrade on a laptop.

I think it's pretty rare, you'll probably have more luck googling for info.

&gt; That said, are there any good stores in Adelaide to provide these parts?
&gt;
&gt; The CPU type is very specific so would probably need to be ordered, & I
&gt; don't fancy handing out credit card details to overseas companies over
&gt; the net.

Stocks of PIII CPUs are pretty much depleted in Australia. I think you will
be hard-pressed to locate a suitable, new one (although there were some new
PIII CPUs being sold off on eBay about a month or two back - if you're lucky
you might find one there). O/S may prove to be your only option for new.
Second hand you might have luck on eBay, or try OCAU
(<A HREF="http://www.overclockers.com.au">http://www.overclockers.com.au</A> - albeit they used to have a 90-day
probation before you could participate in their trading forums) or the
Valhalla forums (<A HREF="http://www.valhalla.net.au">http://www.valhalla.net.au</A>) which is Adelaide-based.

RAM is probably going to be ok, check your Laptop's specs for compatibility
requirements.
