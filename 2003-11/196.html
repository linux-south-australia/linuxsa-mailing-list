I agree the Ctrl+Alt+F7 function does not seem to be working to get back
to the x console. 

Also when playing a music CD and then trying to reboot or closedown from
gnome my comp seems to completely freeze / crash. Cannot even get to
Ctrl+Alt+F3 or something...?

&gt; &gt; A little buggy here and there with the GUI... Install is a breeze... I
&gt; &gt; look forward to using it as the new Redhat!
&gt; 
&gt; I dunno about everyone else, but I didn't fancy Fedora Core 1 as much as
&gt; Redhat 9.  The installer has been dumbed down.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK (I may have missed it) you can't specify exactly what packages you
&gt; want.  Ie, if you select text based internet, you can't specify you want
&gt; wget but not lynx, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, if you happen to control+alt+f1 while the bootup splash screen is
&gt; active, it'll sit on "initialising swap space [ok]", and control+alt+f7
&gt; won't get you to the initial Fedora setup wizard.  I can't remember how
&gt; I ended getting around this, might have been control+alt+f8 or
&gt; something.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess it's going to take a few months before we know exactly what to
&gt; expect from Fedora.  I understand we now have yum and whatnot for
&gt; updates, but I've yet to see a decent howto with how everything fits
&gt; together. If I work it out, I might write something up. =)
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
