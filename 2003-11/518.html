&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Something I've always thought would be useful for a web designer would be an
&gt; application to easily modify CSS stylesheets (redundant acronym usage, d'oh)
&gt; on-the-fly, by 'calibrating' a live page displayed in a browser with a color
&gt; palette.
&gt; 
&gt; That is, some application renders your page, just like in a browser, and in a
&gt; panel or something elsewhere on the screen, it'll show all the CSS styles
&gt; used, and you can actually click on the page itself, which will select the CSS
&gt; style.  You can then change colours (and as an added bonus, font types, other
&gt; attrib's), which will reflect back on the page (& for any other objects using
&gt; that CSS style, too).
&gt; 
&gt; I've always done this manually, and given cleanly written CSS, it's not
&gt; terribly hard to do, but an application like the above could be damn handy;
&gt; especially considering right now I'm in the middle of trying to clean up some
&gt; pretty horribly authored stuff :-(
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody know whether something like this exists; Windows, Linux, Java, or
&gt; otherwise?
&gt; 
&gt; R

something like this can be achieved in mozilla - i do this kind of thing 
regularly. this applies to mozilla suite, but possibly not totally to 
mozilla firebird. i don't use mozilla firebird, so YMMV.

first off, the DOM inspector will give you the "click on an element to 
display properties about it" functionality - it won't display 
exclusively the CSS values, but you can dig through the properties it 
shows to find the relevant CSS stuff. even the computed style (based on 
the actual rendering), which can be very handy. you can install the DOM 
inspector as a sidebar, but that doesn't give you the 
click-on-an-element functionality; you'd have to drill down through the 
page structure to find the node you are interested in.

you launch the DOM inspector from "Tools -&gt; Web Development -&gt; DOM 
Inspector" in the menus.

the next major bit is the evaluating CSS rules as they are typed - this 
can be done via the "edit styles" bookmarklet, which can be found at:

	<A HREF="http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html">http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html</A>

you just create a bookmark to the 'edit styles' link (i have the 
bookmark in my personal toolbar so it's more like an actual button). 
when you click it, it opens a new window with the CSS from the current 
page pre-loaded in it; as you type new CSS rules it re-renders the 
underlying page to reflect the new rules.

advantages: it's cross-platform (win, mac, linux), it's open source, 
and it's one of the most (if not the most) standards-accurate CSS 
renderings available. disadvantages: it's not quite the dedicated CSS 
application you were after ;-)

FWIW, mozilla's composer app has some really good CSS tools in it; it's 
getting ported to be a standalone app called nvu (see www.nvu.com) by 
Daniel Glazman, sponsored by lindows (from memory). i don't think 
there's any actual releases of nvu available yet tho.

if you installed mozilla via RPM, you need the 'mozilla-dom-inspector' 
package installed to use the DOM inspector; otherwise, if you've 
installed mozilla from source or an installer, make sure you choose to 
install "all" or explicitly choose the DOM inspector if doing a custom 
install.

HTH,
