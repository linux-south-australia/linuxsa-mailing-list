Hi David,

&gt; another way is to have someone host your domain.
Actually, the whole point is to not only to host *my* domain, but afew
others that I've done Web Sites for as well...  (Along with working for
Optus, I also run a very small Multimedia Company doing everything from Web
Sites to Corporate Videos, Multi-camera Concerts and just about anything
else to do with Media)  And for those starting to wonder... No, I'm not
talking about running a full blown Hosting ISP business - just looking at
driving in a little extra money to help soften the blow of my 1500Kbs ADSL
costs...

&gt; this way you get to host your own web pages (which it
&gt; doesn't matter if they don't work every so often) but
&gt; they host your email (which is more critical is done
&gt; right).
Actually, what I'm hoping to do (still investigating viability and
workability) is to run a master box and a slave box
- both with dual (redundant) power supplies and twin (Raided) Hard Drives -
running off a UPS system...  (Which SHOULD mean up time would be as close to
100% as humanly possible.)

&gt; how ever if you don't mind the extra cost, having a
&gt; static IP makes it easier and more reliable
&gt; (adam.com.au will give you a static ip for extra $)
I don't mind the extra $ - provided that I have a dependable, reliable
Service that costs less than $150 per month (what I'm currently paying) and
is 'unlimited' in the bandwidth that I pull down - as well as unmetered in
the bandwidth that goes out.

What confounds me (to be honest) is the multitude of suggestions to make
what I want to do work...  Sort of overwhelming to someone with almost 0
experience with Linux - apart from installing it and downloading some
RPM's!!!  I've obviously got a LOT of homework left to do in working out if
what I want to do can be done - and (if so) then working out how to do it...
Before (finally) working out if I can afford to do it properly!!!

Once again, thanks to all for the multitude of replies... :-)

David WOLVERTON
