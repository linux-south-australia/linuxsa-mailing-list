They're internal, private IP ranges.  They're certainly not routable 
over the Internet, meaning that the fact they are 'static' means 
absolutely nothing to anybody not on your private network.  The IP that 
counts is the public IP; the one that you say changes all the time.

&gt; (I've got a crapy 
&gt; Billion which I'm about to upgrade) that MIRC always finds the right 
&gt; box, and everything correctly connects enabeling peops to get the stuff 

They're crappy?  I've found them quite good.

&gt; I'm serving without having to adjust Port forwarding on the Billion 
&gt; Modem/Router each time I've had to reboot.

I'd suggest putting it into Modem mode, and using PPPOE/port forwarding 
with iptables on your Linux box; you'll find it's far more versatile.

  &gt; So, to get to the point: I 'own' a domain (a .com.au address) and 
what I
&gt; would like to know is: Can I configure/Port forward (or whatever) one of 
&gt; my Linux Redhat 9 boxes, to host the domain that I own so 
&gt; that regardless of how many times I connect/dissconect from Internode, a 
&gt; person going to my URL ( EG: <A HREF="http:www.mydomain.com.au">http:www.mydomain.com.au</A> ) and/or sending 
&gt; me an E-Mail ( <A HREF="mailto:newbie@mydomain.com.au">newbie@mydomain.com.au</A> &lt;mailto:<A HREF="mailto:newbie@mydomain.com.au">newbie@mydomain.com.au</A>&gt; ) 
&gt; will always arrive at the Redhat 9 box I'm using to host my domain on - 
&gt; regardless of how many times I reboot/reset my Modem/Router's connection 
&gt; to Internode?

Well, sort of, and it'll mostly work (in fact, it'll probably work 
flawlessly), but I wouldn't rely on it, as your IP will change quite 
often.  What you need to do is get somebody else to host your DNS 
(there's free providers out there, zoneedit?  I don't know, I've always 
had my own colo'ed machines), signup for a "dynamic DNS" service 
(dyndns.org for example), make sure you're running the dynamic DNS 
update script in your ip-up.d scripts (i.e. every time a ppp connection 
is established), and setup the DNS something like this:

@ IN MX 10 mail
@ IN MX 20 somebody.elses.backup.mail.server.in.case.yours.goes.down
@ IN CNAME blahblah.dyndns.org
mail IN CNAME blahblah.dyndns.org
www IN CNAME blahblah.dyndns.org
