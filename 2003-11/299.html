Andy,

I don't know if Star Office is free for educational use. I know that 6.0
wasn't free and assume 7.0 isnt free also. We (AIT) bought a licence for
less than $100 which covers licences for all students and staff both at work
and home. So for us it wasn't free but close enough.


Michael

Hi again,

  I wasn't aware that education users get Star Office for free. That's very
interesting! Yes - when you look at it that way $299 does seem rich. What I
was trying to get across is that when you consider that less than 3 months
ago students were having to pay $249 for Office Academic and to do so
provide proof of student status, have it installed only onto one PC and in
addition that it was only available through selected "Education Resellers"
it seems more than just coincidence that they have suddenly taken a shift in
this direction.

  For me personally - since trying out a few Linux distro's and settling on
Mandrake and using Open Office & Ximian Evolution I won't be looking
elsewhere for a long time!

  Andy.
