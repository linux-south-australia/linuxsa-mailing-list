&gt; &gt; Thanks for the replies guys.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Today I just had a play around on an iMac with the same specs as the
&gt; &gt; iBook I plan on getting. It was my first real experience with OSX.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I must say I'm quite impressed with it, first thing I went for was 
&gt; &gt; bash, quite nice indeed.
&gt; 
&gt; Hrm, does 10.3 have bash now as the default shell? (I haven't played
&gt; much with it yet, sold my Powerbook the same day the place I work at
&gt; got copies early, so I only managed time enough to install it).
 
tcsh was the default, but bash was there lurking in the background...

&gt; &gt; I like the fact that it seems to come with Apache/Mysql/PHP with the
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; OS that's a big plus, as I'll be using it partly for some PHP
&gt; &gt; development. Although it's not like it's terribly difficult to get
&gt; &gt; it going otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; MySQL does?  Sure you wern't playing with OS X Server?  (That said,
&gt; there's things such as fink [dpkg/apt-get, ala' Debian] and Darwin
&gt; Ports to make installation of these easy as hell on normal OS X, and
&gt; they tend to be less bugprone then OS X Server.).

It definitely wasn't server, and I'm not 100% sure that it was there, as
I didn't spend much time playing around with it, but I'm pretty sure
there were a few files with 'mysql' in their name in /etc

Either way it wouldn't be an issue to install if it wasn't there, I'm
sure. 

&gt; &gt; Since there aren't any proper 3D drivers for X11 in linux, what are
&gt; &gt; the open source drivers like? I'd like to dual boot anyway, at least
&gt; &gt; just for the occasional linux usage.
&gt; 
&gt; Crappy.  Awful.  Forget it.
&gt; 
&gt; Linux absolutely flies on PPC hardware, but forget doing any gaming or
&gt; anything on it.   More games for OS X, anyway ;-)

I'll definately keep that in mind :)
 
&gt; &gt; I think I'll be going for it within a few weeks, unless I come 
&gt; &gt; across an x86 laptop with better specs and a lesser price tag. -
&gt; &gt; Doubtfull
&gt; 
&gt; You can't compare an Apple to an Orange^H^H^H^H^H^Hx86.  Completely
&gt; different toys.

Well, since what I'll be using the machine for can be done on both
architectures, I'd say there's at least some basis for comparison,
perhaps a better word would be 'decision' eh?
ie. compatibility/performance/price, especially since this is my first
venture in to the world of the PPC :-)

&gt; I strongly recommend the iBook, you won't regret it for on-the-road
&gt; development; it's a great little machine.  I already miss my old
&gt; Powerbook.

Thanks for the tips, I'll keep you all updated on my purchase, probably
from the middle of Rundle Mall too :D

Certainly looking forward to trying out citilan &lt;grin&gt;

Daniel.
