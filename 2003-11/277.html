&gt; Nice to see the sort of unbiased reporting I've come to expect from 
&gt; The Advertiser.

Damien,

1) They're the media, and
2) The Advertiser seem to be /very/ heavily MS-biased.  I'd love to be proven
wrong[1] (who here doesn't want Linux advocated in the media?), but they don't
seem to care about the alternatives at all - I've read many comments like this
(in fact, this is one of the nicer ones), and even though Linux is damn
popular these days, and plenty of people would be keen to read about it, they
never seem to even mention it.

Don't get *too* hyped up about it.  Of course, enough people voicing concerns
to them might make them do something about it, though.  I suspect their bias
is influenced by more than just their opinions/preferences, too; it seems
quite odd to me that News Limited don't use *any* Apple IIRC (they used to
many years ago, and pretty much every other newshouse use Apple, for obvious
reasons).

R

[1] I don't mean for this to be misinterpreted as an attack against them;
just, I personally find the apparent bias dissapointing :-(  Bring on the
positive Open Source articles!
