Hi again,

  I wasn't aware that education users get Star Office for free. That's
very interesting! Yes - when you look at it that way $299 does seem
rich. What I was trying to get across is that when you consider that
less than 3 months ago students were having to pay $249 for Office
Academic and to do so provide proof of student status, have it installed
only onto one PC and in addition that it was only available through
selected "Education Resellers" it seems more than just coincidence that
they have suddenly taken a shift in this direction.

  For me personally - since trying out a few Linux distro's and settling
on Mandrake and using Open Office & Ximian Evolution I won't be looking
elsewhere for a long time!

  Andy.
