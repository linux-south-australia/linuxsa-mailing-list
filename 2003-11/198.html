A while back I was seeing a lot of times when the connection to my ISP would 
pause for a few seconds, then go again. eventually I called the tech support, 
and the guy there said there were a lot of retrains, but didn't know what to 
do. I suggested that I could turn the speed down, but he said that wouldn't 
help. shortly after I got online, googled a bit, then posted to this list. 
someone from the list (I forget who though 8^( told me he'd had similar 
problems, and had written a script to just disconnect and dial-back when it 
happened. which I didn't really want to do. after a while longer I decided to 
go back to the settings and slow the speed down. time to run pppsetup again.
Coming from a windows world, having the modem speed at 115200 max seemed right 
at the time... I guess windows has automatic throttling or something, because 
while it works for windows, it seems to be the problem for me. after I set 
the speed to 57600 (which is about the speed I'd get anyway, so it's not 
going to slow me down any), the problem seemed to become far rarer (now I 
usually only see problems when someone is using the net over the LAN from 
another computer, which gave the same problem in windows, so it could be on 
the ISP's side).
in windows, downloads would usually go at around 3 KB/s, whereas from linux I 
usually see 4.5KB/s as an average, which also implies windows does some 
throttling.

so, for those who are having trouble with modem retraining, try setting your 
maximum connection speed to about what you'd get anyway (57600 for 56K 
dial-up, more if you're lucky enough to have broadband) and hopefully the 
problem will either reduce itself a lot, or disappear completely

hope this helps some people
Adam
