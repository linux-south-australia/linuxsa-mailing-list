Hi Damien

With your computer turned off you can clean the dust out of it with a
paint brush and then vacuum up the loose dirt. You need to ask yourself
why your computer is getting so dusty.

The Acer burner also being on the same bus (IDE) as the dodgy hard
drive, it could be the motherboard.

&gt; &gt; Damien,
&gt; &gt; Have you tried the HD in another machine?  I reckon it sounds like your MB
&gt; &gt; is stuffed.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah I just did that today. The hard drive still has the same problems, but 
&gt; it's hard to tell. I think I'd have to totally reformat and try it in a 
&gt; different machine for a period of a couple of months to see if it developed 
&gt; bad sectors. Whilst the hard drive was in this different computer, I did an 
&gt; extended SMART test in capture mode, and it produced a bit of a different 
&gt; result. The results are shown below:
&gt; 
&gt; Num  Test_Description  Status   Remaining  LifeTime(hours)  LBA_of_first_error
&gt; # 1  Short off-line   Completed: electrical failure    90%    645   0x055628f2
&gt; # 2  Extended captive    Completed: read failure   20%    644   0x08745785
&gt; # 3  Short off-line      Completed: electrical failure 90%    642   0x05563722
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Interesting that in Captive mode it gets 80% of the way through the test 
&gt; before a read error. With short non-captive tests, it gets electrical 
&gt; failure. Am I just unlucky in getting 3 stuffed drives in a row? Is something 
&gt; about my computer or environment causing these drives to die? My computer has 
&gt; heaps of dust in it (which is causing me lots of heat problems, CPU idles at 
&gt; 63 degrees, hard drive idles at 38-40 degrees).
&gt; 
&gt; In another perhaps related problem, my Acer CD Burner seems to have a mind of 
&gt; its own. When its just sitting in my computer and I'm not even doing anything 
&gt; with it, both the CD IN light and WRITING light turn on, and I can't eject 
&gt; the drive. Once the drive ejected all by itself with both lights on, it's so 
&gt; bizarre. I think I have a poltergeist in my computer :) I was suspecting 
&gt; maybe supermount is sending some weird commands to it or something, so I've 
&gt; disabled supermount and I'm seeing how that goes (I've been using supermount 
&gt; with the drive for over a year without problems though).
&gt; 
&gt; I performed a SMART test on a working seagate drive of the same size in a 
&gt; different computer to compare the numbers. Apart from the "uncorrectable" 
&gt; read errors in my drive, the good Seagate drive has just as many correctable 
&gt; errors as mine, and even runs at a higher temperature (this one was at 47 
&gt; degrees when I tested it).
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really at a complete loss at the moment, I don't know what to do. The hard 
&gt; drive is still under warranty, but none of the other components are. I've 
&gt; already replaced two drives on warranty claims, they might think something 
&gt; fishy is going on. What if my computer is somehow killing these drives, if I 
&gt; do warranty claim again, and the drive gets replaced and the same thing 
&gt; happens, I'm really back at square one again.
&gt; 
&gt; The more I use my computer, the more data I'm losing... :(
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Damien

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another problem that may be related, is one of my RAM modules seems
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be a bit funny. On first power on, the NVRAM test gets to 380MB
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and then the machine resets. On second test, it passes ok. When I had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the computer set to quickboot (ie, no NVRAM test), I would sometimes
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get the machine randomly rebooting  (under Linux). On one occasion,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kicker SIGSEGV'd just moments before it rebooted.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So could dodgy RAM be causing these issues? I ran memtest for an hour
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last night, and it didn't report any errors.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does sound like dodgy RAM.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An hour may not be long enough, especially if you set it to do the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extended tests, which I've found to be a good idea.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, you could try swapping your RAM modules around and see if the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reset at 380MB happens at some other value.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well I've taken out the second RAM module, and now I don't get that
&gt; &gt; &gt; reboot problem at all. What's interesting is, I've been trying some more
&gt; &gt; &gt; SMART tests with this drive, and now I get:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Num Test_Description  Status  Remaining  LifeTime(hours) 
&gt; &gt; &gt; LBA_of_first_error #1    Short off-line  Completed: electrical failure
&gt; &gt; &gt; 90%    634    0x08780c3e # 2  Short off-line   Completed: electrical
&gt; &gt; &gt; failure 90%    634    0x0555b13a # 3  Short off-line   Completed:
&gt; &gt; &gt; electrical failure 90%    634    0x0555afba # 4  Short off-line  
&gt; &gt; &gt; Completed: electrical failure 90%    632   0x05569cfa
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Tests 1-3 have been done without the dodgy RAM stick. Test 4 was done
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the monitor switched off, it was the first time I got an "electrical
&gt; &gt; &gt; failure" on a test.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is driving me nuts, I just want a computer that works.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
