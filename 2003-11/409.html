Ryan,

&gt; I'd suggest putting it into Modem mode, and using PPPOE/port forwarding 
&gt; with iptables on your Linux box; you'll find it's far more versatile.

Why introduce more complexity when you don't need it? The Billion's port
forwarding abilities [it calls it virtual hosts I think] are quite good.

&gt; Well, sort of, and it'll mostly work (in fact, it'll probably work 
&gt; flawlessly), but I wouldn't rely on it, as your IP will change quite 
&gt; often.

Huh? Why would it change quite often? Is this a service that Internode
provide ;-?

&gt; What you need to do is get somebody else to host your DNS 
&gt; (there's free providers out there, zoneedit?  I don't know, I've always 
&gt; had my own colo'ed machines), signup for a "dynamic DNS" service 
&gt; (dyndns.org for example), make sure you're running the dynamic DNS 
&gt; update script in your ip-up.d scripts (i.e. every time a ppp connection 
&gt; is established), and setup the DNS something like this:

Too difficult. Most of the dynamic DNS scripts will work even if you're
port forwarding via the modem these days...

;-)

/me shakes his head

 Why do techno gurus always have to make life harder than it should be?
