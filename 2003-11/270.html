Hi.

On Sat, 15 Nov 2003 16:40:31 -0700, Your Name wrote
&gt; Am I on the right track.

Well, the first thing to do to get on the right track, would be to add
your proper name (or nom-de-plume) to your email config. Unless, of
course, you wish to make yourself known as 'Your Name' :)

The second thing to do would be to press the 'Send' button just once.
Three copies is a bit much...

As to the problem...

&gt; 
&gt; THE PROBLEM
&gt; Each week I have a task where I download about 20-40MB of assorted
&gt; Quark/PDF DTP files which are converted to PHP/PNG files and 

Are these all PDF files, or are there some Quark (and other) format
files there as well? have you tried opening/publishing them in the Gimp?

&gt; re-uploaded to a Web server (~5MB). I plan to be travelling 
&gt; for some time and the download size is a problem particularly 
&gt; in China. The major bulk is publishing resolution PDFs and 
&gt; TIFFs which I currently render in Photoshop and crop and 
&gt; resize and save as PNG8s
&gt; 
&gt; SOLUTION 1
&gt; Logically I should perform all the reformatting on the Linux 
&gt; 2.4.21-xfs. Virtual Server using command line tools and never 
&gt; move them around, but I have had trouble finding suitable 
&gt; software tools that are within usage agreement. Since the 50 
&gt; odd files come from 50 odd different authors, I do not know 
&gt; what needs to be done to them until AFTER I preview the file!

It's possible you are dealing with filetypes that require tools that are
not yet available on linux. Until this is known, it will be hard for
anyone here to offer much help. You may also run into font problems,
depending on what your authors have dreamt up.

&gt; 
&gt; SOLUTION 2
&gt; Co-locate a  Linux  box anywhere I can get power and a 
&gt; permanent IP and FTP the files to there. Run Gimp using 
&gt; command line and macros if possible and then a remote X 
&gt; session to finish off, and then FTP the files back to the server.
&gt; 
&gt; This second solution seems to be the best bet at the moment 
&gt; and I am looking for constructive criticism on that. Also some 
&gt; suggestions on suitable places to locate this box (offers 
&gt; invited). If it is in Adelaide I do not really need all the 
&gt; backup, redundancy and high bandwidth available in a web farm, 
&gt; I have three days to complete the task each week.

If a lot of the files are easily convertable on linux via commandline
tools, I'd be writing scripts to recognise and process those files, and
put them in a temporary area that you can get to via your browser. This
would enable you to check the conversions before they got published.

Any remaining files might require you to d/l and work with them on your
own system. Using remote X is do-able if you can get a friendly host to
allow it (security would be an issue), but it assumes the files in
question are editable in linux.

Suggest you post a list of filetypes that you have to deal with.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
&gt; 
&gt; Best Regards, Kym Michael
