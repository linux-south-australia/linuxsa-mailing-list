Hi

I wonder if anyone can help me, I have recently had ISDN 64k installed and
cannot connect properly on a Linux box

I currently have RH9 installed on an ASUS 266mhz and has been running as a
firewall/router for my small network at home. I have 2 other boxes that are
running windows as clients on the same network.

The rh9 was connected thru a 56k modem prior to installing the ISDN and
worked fine. I am using the Telstras supplied NT1 plus II modem.

When connected to ISDN the throughput seems to be around 0.5 Kbytes/sec. I
have tried connecting thru the comm port and USB port and neither will work
properly.

I connected the modem to a windows box and it worked fine on both the comm.
and usb port, so the modems o.k

The initialisation string that I used (which tesltra recommends) is the
following
AT Z !Z=9 !T0=255 E0 V1 &D2 &C1

I am new to Linux I have only been running RH9 since about May this year.
Since I have had Linux running it has been 100% up time since May (once I
finally fumbled through setting it up).

If anyone could give some ideas it would be great

Mike
