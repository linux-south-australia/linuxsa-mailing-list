Michael,

&gt; &gt; But this only proves that there IS stolen code in the open 
&gt; &gt; source code base. Which makes ALL installations of open source 
&gt; &gt; material suspect. I'm not sure whether *this* would actually 
&gt; &gt; do us any good at all.
&gt; 
&gt; bzzt* Huh? 
&gt; 
&gt; What statement exactly are you suggesting proves that there IS stolen
&gt; code?

I was being slightly unclear. It would have read better if I'd said:

"But if SCO does turn up with code that it wrote and did not give away,
but it is indeed in the kernel, then it actually proves that SCO is
correct."

&gt; It is just as possible, perhaps more so, that there is code from Linux
&gt; in SCO Unix. This certainly happened in the BSD case.
&gt; 
&gt; The only 'proof' of anything is that it is not possible to emphatically
&gt; know either way unless you have access to unix code, and the kernel
&gt; developers don't want to see it for obvious reasons.

Which of course befuddles the matter totally :(
