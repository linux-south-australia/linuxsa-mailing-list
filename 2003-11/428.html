&gt; .... what the hell?  I thought the original court date was sometime
&gt; early next year (although I haven't been paying close attention).

They apparently asked for it to be put off.  This confuses me.  My
theory is that SCO won't be there in a year's time.  This action
suggests that they know something else.  Or maybe they know that, once
the case opens, it will collapse pretty soon, and in the meantime they
want to make as much money as possible.

&gt; Can't IBM demand the court date be earlier?  That's another year and
&gt; a half of SCO's crap; something that I'm damn sure can't be good.

I'm wondering what they're going to pull out of their hats next.  If
they sue a "major Linux user", what evidence are they going to use?  I
suspect that that case, too, will be drawn out (which, of course,
means that it will cost the user money, which isn't good).
