<H1>[OT]  We Will Remember on 11 November</H1>

 This Tuesday take a minute out of your busy schedule to remember.

 At the 11 Hour on the 11th Day of the 11th Month, around the
 world millions of people will be doing what you are doing, taking
 a minute out of their lives to remember all those that have given
 their lives so the world could be a better place than what might
 have otherwise eventuated.

 We don't know why there are wars, none of us really want them,
 but for countless years men and women have stepped up and put
 their lives on the line for the sake of their country and their
 loved ones, and at the end of the day they have left the world we
 know. Their hope has been that they have in some way left the way
 free for our world to become better and free, we can hope and
 pray that we live up to their dreams.

 They have already made the Ultimate Sacrifice, the least we could
 do is give them a minute of our time in honour and remembrance.

 So stop the phone call, break the conversation, pull over to the
 side of the road or just bow your head, do whatever feels right
 to you that will let you say you remember them.

 It doesn't matter whether your country calls it Remembrance Day
 or Armistice Day or Veterans Day, give them the honour they
 deserve, give them at least a minute out of your day because
 they have given so much more so you can have a morning to rise to.

 In Flanders Field

 In Flanders Field the poppies blow
 Between the crosses, row on row,
 That mark our place, and in the sky
 The larks, still bravely singing, fly.
 Scarce heard amid the guns below.


 We are the Dead. Short days ago
 We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
 Loved and were loved, and now we lie
 In Flanders fields.


 Take up our quarrel with the foe:
 To you from failing hands we throw
 The torch; be yours to hold it high.
 If ye break faith with us who die
 We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
 In Flanders fields.

 By: Lt. Col. John McCrae, MD (1872-1918)
