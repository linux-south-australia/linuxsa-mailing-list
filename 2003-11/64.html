Thanks for the replies guys.

Today I just had a play around on an iMac with the same specs as the
iBook I plan on getting. It was my first real experience with OSX.

I must say I'm quite impressed with it, first thing I went for was bash,
quite nice indeed.

I like the fact that it seems to come with Apache/Mysql/PHP with the OS
that's a big plus, as I'll be using it partly for some PHP development.
Although it's not like it's terribly difficult to get it going
otherwise.

Since there aren't any proper 3D drivers for X11 in linux, what are the
open source drivers like? I'd like to dual boot anyway, at least just
for the occasional linux usage.

I think I'll be going for it within a few weeks, unless I come across an
x86 laptop with better specs and a lesser price tag. - Doubtfull

Again, thanks for the help

Cheers,
Daniel.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Forget linux for the iBook and go with OSX, it is far superior and
&gt; &gt;&gt; is BSD based so you get the eye candy we have always loved from

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Heh, running Linux on a Apple portable always seemed almost like a 
&gt; &gt; waste to
&gt; &gt; me; I mean, you've shelled out extra for the nice hardware, but then
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; you're
&gt; &gt; running an OS that runs exactly the same as it would on PC hardware,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; except
&gt; &gt; that you've got slightly less applications to choose from (I mean, 
&gt; &gt; wine won't
&gt; &gt; work at all, for obvious reasons, and there's no real 3D drivers, as
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; companies
&gt; &gt; like nVidia/ATI release binary only stuff).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Only reason why I ran it is OS X used to run like a dead dog back in
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; 10.1
&gt; &gt; days.  Now 10.3's out, I'm really happy with its responsiveness.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I'd have to agree. I've tried a couple of linux installs on my G3
&gt; (500) iBook and well, it's Linux. It behaves exactly the same as on
&gt; the PC. Whereas, OSX 10.3 is considerably faster than previous
&gt; renditions and is really pretty too :)
