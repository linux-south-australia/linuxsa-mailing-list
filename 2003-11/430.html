Hi David,

another way to do this is to use your providers webspace.

1. get them to create a virtual host on their web server, which points
to your ~/public_html directory on their web server.

2. write a script that gets your dynamic IP address each time you
connect, writes an html file and uploads it to the ~/public_html
directory. The html file would have a redirect header so that anyone
requesting your domain ends up at your dynamic ip address.

script for automated ftp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#! /bin/bash

ftp -n  &lt;hostname&gt; &lt;&lt;EOF
user    &lt;username&gt;      &lt;password&gt;
&lt;ftp commands&gt;
quit
EOF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(parts of) script to get dynamic ip address
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#! /bin/bash

# get the ip address
ip=`ifconfig | grep -A 1 ppp | grep inet | sed -e 's/^.*addr://' -e 's/
.*//'`
url1='<A HREF="http://">http://</A>'$ip'/~me/'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hope this helps

kind regards,

Luke

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;  
&gt; Well... I've been lurking long enough to start to get a feel for the
&gt; group (I now have about a months experience with Redhat/Linux and this
&gt; group) and have been especially encouraged to see that all
&gt; semi-intelligent questions are answered...  HOPEFULLY this post falls
&gt; into that catagory.  *Grins*
&gt;  
&gt; My question is this:  Since I know that I can use my Linux Distro
&gt; (Redhat 9) to act as (amongst other things) a DNS/Proxy/Web Server - I
&gt; would like to know if I can use a non-static IP address to host the
&gt; domain that I own on one of the four boxes on my home network...
&gt;  
&gt; Let me be as specific as I can so that there's no confusion: My
&gt; ADSL connection is through Internode.  My understanding (I haven't
&gt; confirmed with Internode) is that I do not have a static IP, and that
&gt; every time I dissconnect and/or reboot my ADSL Modem/Router I
&gt; automaticly get assigned a different 'Master' IP address by them.
&gt;  
&gt; However, I also know that all of the boxes on my Home LAN (4) all have
&gt; static IP addresses permenantly configured - through the Router/Modem
&gt; - because (for example) when I'm serving on MIRC - I know that
&gt; regardless of how many times I've had to reboot the Modem/Router (I've
&gt; got a crapy Billion which I'm about to upgrade) that MIRC always finds
&gt; the right box, and everything correctly connects enabeling peops to
&gt; get the stuff I'm serving without having to adjust Port forwarding on
&gt; the Billion Modem/Router each time I've had to reboot.
&gt;  
&gt; So, to get to the point: I 'own' a domain (a .com.au address) and what
&gt; I would like to know is: Can I configure/Port forward (or whatever)
&gt; one of my Linux Redhat 9 boxes, to host the domain that I own so
&gt; that regardless of how many times I connect/dissconect from Internode,
&gt; a person going to my URL ( EG: <A HREF="http:www.mydomain.com.au">http:www.mydomain.com.au</A> ) and/or
&gt; sending me an E-Mail ( <A HREF="mailto:newbie@mydomain.com.au">newbie@mydomain.com.au</A> ) will always arrive at
&gt; the Redhat 9 box I'm using to host my domain on - regardless of how
&gt; many times I reboot/reset my Modem/Router's connection to Internode?
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;  
&gt; The apprentice Geek (David Wolverton)
