It is extremely difficult for any one to make a logical suggestion based on 
your e-mail below.
Iptables might have been enabled during your build, so turn it off and see 
if it works.

You have a lot of reading to do so start by reading the redhat manuals that 
are available form redhat. They cover almost everything you would need to 
get on the net and MUCH more.
Not much more I can add except try to keep the questions narrow and focused 
and we can get your through little by little, and only if you read, read, 
and READ.

&gt;I'm running Red Hat 9 and have had nothing but trouble
&gt;getting an internet connnection.  Despite reinstalling I still have
&gt;the following message coming up at boot time.
&gt;

&gt;Network card activation failed
&gt;Determining IP information for etho.....iptables
&gt;No chain/target/match by that name
&gt;failed iptables bad rule..........(does a matching rule
&gt;exist in that chain?)
&gt;
&gt;I thought that reinstalling would have reset the iptables
&gt;but obviously hasn't.  As a relative newbie I have no idea
&gt;about iptables and have been unable to find any helpful information
&gt;on the net.  I've also tried unsuccessfully to activate the LAN card.
&gt;
&gt;I'm running a LAN with a windows 98 box and a Corega Bar SW Pro
&gt;router/Switching hub with a Yahoo BB ADSL connection.  I previously
&gt;had no problems running any of these computers and had to do little
&gt;if any configuration.
&gt;
&gt;The strange thing about this is that after giving up and leaving the box
&gt;alone for two or three months (maybe due to repairing the RPM database)
&gt;I managed to get a connection after logging on today.
&gt;The connection was lost after trying to register the system with Red Hat
&gt;Network.
&gt;
&gt;Any Ideas people
