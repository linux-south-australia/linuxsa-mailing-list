I didn't know internode used pppoe. Mine doesn't.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt;      I have recently had issues relating to my IP address changing for 
&gt; unknown reasons.  I use a standard RFC compliant bridging ADSL modem.  I 
&gt; am getting my ADSL service from Internode.  I have called a few times 
&gt; about this issue wanting to know why (as I thought it was on their end) 
&gt; and the level 1 helpdesk there hasn't been able to solve this with a 
&gt; correct answer.  This issue is not a level 1 helpdesk issue I might add, 
&gt; so don't take it as if I am bagging their helpdesk.  I have tracked down 
&gt; my issue to being the time for LCP echo request/reply timeouts.  In 
&gt; RedHat 9.0 the default LCP timeout for pppoe-3.5 (Roaring Penguin) is a 
&gt; big 80 seconds.  Now I don't really know where they got that number from 
&gt; nor do I care but I have adjusted this down to 10 seconds which is quite 
&gt; reasonable to me and everything seems to be in working order.  The exact 
&gt; error I _was_ getting was:
&gt; 
&gt; Inactivity timeout... something wicked happened on session NNNN
&gt; where "NNNN" is the session ID(number).  I know that there are a few 
&gt; internode employees subscribed to this list and since it is applicable 
&gt; to both internode support for linux and anyone running RedHat 9.0 with 
&gt; pppoe-3.5 (but not limited to those), I figured that this might be 
&gt; useful for some.  This affected me in several ways but I figure the 
&gt; worst was in the middle of ssh sessions vi'ing a file, repeatedly.
&gt;
