FWIW, in KDE you can download a panel applet called xmms-kde, and you can 
assign global key combinations for controlling XMMS.

To allow KDE to launch apps or do whatever on keyboard shortcuts, go to KDE 
Control Centre, then click Accessibility-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts (Dunno why the 
hell it's under accessibility). Under "Command Shortcuts" you can apply key 
combinations to launching any app inside your KMenu.

Cheers,

Damien

&gt; I just had a bit of a win with gnome and xmms, and in the style of James
&gt; Leone (hi james ;-) ) I thought I'd post my experience here.
&gt;
&gt; The Itch:
&gt; ---------
&gt; On my windows machine, I have a program called FlexTouch[1]. It allows
&gt; you to assign arbitrary shortcuts to (somewhat) arbitrary actions (such
&gt; as programs - "Win+q = c:\windows\calc.exe" and winamp commands -
&gt; "win+space = play or pause". Using this has become such an ingrained
&gt; thing in me that I find myself reaching for win+space every time I want
&gt; to pause music on every computer I ever sit at. So of course, I wanted
&gt; to be able to do it on my redhat 8.0 (gnome 2.0) machine.
&gt;
&gt; The Scratch:
&gt; ------------
&gt; as often is the case in linux, a solution in several parts.
&gt;
&gt; 1. xmmsPipe[2,3].
&gt;  From the webpage, "XMMSPipe is a plugin for XMMS that enables it to be
&gt; controlled by sending strings to a named pipe (FIFO). When enabled, XMMS
&gt; can be commanded by sending strings to $HOME/.xmms/inpipe, for example,
&gt; `echo play_pause &gt; ~/.xmms/inpipe`".
&gt;
&gt; Installation was pretty easy - I just had to download the tarball,
&gt; untar, make && make install. restart xmms, and it's all there. I can
&gt; manually do commands like that example and have xmms play or pause.
&gt; fantastic, good start.
&gt;
&gt; 2. my friend vi[4].
&gt; I created some tiny scripts called "xmms-playpause", "xmms-prev",
&gt; "xmms-volup" and the like under /usr/local/bin. They all contain just 2
&gt; lines (from the play-or-pause example):
&gt;
&gt; 	#!/bin/bash
&gt; 	echo "play_pause" &gt; ~/.xmms/inpipe
&gt;
&gt; A `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/xmms-playpause` later, and I could (as a
&gt; normal user) do `xmms-playpause` from the command line and have xmms
&gt; play or pause. Cool, getting closer.
&gt;
&gt; 3. gconf-editor[5].
&gt; On my redhat 8.0 system, it's under gnome menu -&gt; extras -&gt; system tools
&gt; -&gt; configuration editor, or `gconf-editor` from a prompt.
&gt;
&gt;   a. In the GUI, I navigated to /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands[6],
&gt; under which are a number of keys labeled command_N. I edited some of
&gt; these key values to run the scripts i created in step 2, simply by
&gt; setting the value for (say) command_1 to (say)
&gt; "/usr/local/bin/xmms-playpause".
&gt;
&gt;   b. Under /apps/metacity/global_keybindings[6] there are a number of
&gt; keys called "run_command_N". As you might imagine, these run the
&gt; command_N key values from /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands (that I
&gt; modified in 3a). I set the shortcuts I wanted by setting the value for
&gt; (say) run_command_1 to (say) "&lt;mod4&gt;Space"[7], which binds it to Win+Space.
&gt;
&gt; 4. I celebrated the geeky achievement by win+spacing to my heart's content.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So yeah, I made it work, and learned how to bind arbitrary global
&gt; shortcuts under gnome at the same time (actually, I believe it's a
&gt; metacity thing, but I don't think there's many people who run metacity
&gt; our of gnome). Yay for linux on the desktop, yay for gnome, yay for xmms :)

&gt;
&gt; 3. I looked at a couple of other xmms remote control type apps - at the
&gt; time I was looking though, sourceforge.net was not accessible, so that
&gt; excluded most of them from my evaluation. xmmsPipe did what i wanted, at
&gt; any rate. and pipes are cool.
&gt;
&gt; 4. mmmmm, creamy vi goodness. I'm sure emacs would have worked too.
&gt; Also, if you're really stuck, pico or ed. Well, maybe not pico.
&gt;
&gt; 5. What was that? A windows registry editor, for gnome? Good idea.
&gt;
&gt; 6. I didn't magically know these values - a google search for "gnome
&gt; arbitrary keyboard shortcuts" found me a couple of mailing list
&gt; references that pointed me in the right direction. The rest was
&gt; (educated) guessing.
&gt;
&gt; 7. I didn't magically know that "&lt;mod4&gt;" was the name for the windows
&gt; key either. I found this out when i was binding win+M to "hide all
&gt; windows and focus desktop" under gnome preferences -&gt; keyboard shortcuts.
