&gt; Go to freshrpms.net and install apt for Fedora.

&gt; Use freshrpms.net, fedora.us, and "Dag's apt repository for Fedora"

Yeah, problem being that like I said, my internet access at home is so
pathetic it's not even like having it.

Trust me, being a Debian geek, that's the first thing I'd do normally ;-(

&gt; Install totem.  That's your MS Windows Media Player equivalent - MP3,
&gt; MPEG4, DVD etc.

Okie dokie.  Do the totem packages include/have dependencies on all the
required codecs to play movies around the place (DivX, etc) or do I need to
install them as well?  URL's would be handy, otherwise it's going to turn into
a chore as I'll download at work, go home, find I've got the wrong ones/I'm
missing dependencies, repeat process.

&gt; Fedora comes with OOo 1.1 (Office) and Epiphany(Web).  Use them.

Ah, nice :-)

&gt; &gt; Hiya,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems mirror.sa.3fl.net (free for PIPE users, i.e.
&gt; &gt; Internode/Netspace/etc) have mirrored the 3 ISO's of Fedora Core 1, so
&gt; &gt; I've grabbed them today at work for use at home on my girlfriend's
&gt; &gt; computer (who quite likes Redhat 9).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not being a Redhat user, and I've never used Fedora before, I'm not
&gt; &gt; sure what comes with it, what doesn't, and what people recommend I
&gt; &gt; should download.  My internet access at home is so awful it's almost
&gt; &gt; not like even having it (~1kb/sec downloads, usually), so I'd like to
&gt; &gt; download everything I need in one go.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd be interested (and I'd imagine it'd be of much usefulness to many
&gt; &gt; others) in a list of applications people recommend to throw on top of
&gt; &gt; Fedora after install; things such as decss dvd players/libraries (?),
&gt; &gt; codecs (mp3 codec thing, divx?), etc, that don't come with Fedora due
&gt; &gt; to some issue or another (or do they? - I honestly don't know).  URL's
&gt; &gt; to the RPM's would be an added bonus.  The machine's basically going to
&gt; &gt; be used as a normal desktop machine; things such as word
&gt; &gt; processors/spreadsheets (does OpenOffice come with Fedora?), graphic
&gt; &gt; design (gimp?), media players (xmms w/mp3 support?
&gt; &gt; mplayer/xine/something for divx/dvd's?), etc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'm a Debian user, so I'm used to doing all this digging around myself
&gt; &gt; manually (grin, apt-get), but a list of essential nonbundled
&gt; &gt; applications like this would be quite good, IMHO.
