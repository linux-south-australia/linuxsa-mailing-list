I was helping a friend with a similar problem on the weekend.  The AGP nVidia
32 Vanta card would cause the monitor to stop receiving a signal randomly.  The
machine is a 2yr old Campaq Pasario?  After stuffing around and changing the
OS, we got a message saying the Video Card was making the system unstable.  The
computer worked fine & didn't know the video output had ceased under his older
OS.  He is buying a new card today.

Subject: [OT] Hardware - AGP


Hiya,

Completely non-related Linux question, but I'm trying to build some old
machines for my brothers out of parts I've got lying around here; all they're
to be used for is for older games and school work, so they don't have to be
all that flash.

One of the machines is a Celeron 300A in a iWill PIILS board, which would have
been nice in it's day - onboard SCSI, the lot.

It's doing some really odd things, though.  Stick a PCI video card in it, and
it runs perfectly.  Stick an AGP video card in it (at least, the two I've
tried) and the machine will randomly switch off without any explanation
whatsoever.

I've tried both an old nVidia 32MB Vanta, and a 32MB Savage 4, both exhibit
the same behaviour.

Anybody got any clues on why it would do this?  I'm guessing the motherboard's
bjorked, but is this a known problem with older motherboards?  Something to do
with the voltage being wrong or something, perhaps?
