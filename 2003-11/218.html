Hi.

I had a production W2k box die horribly on me a couple of weeks ago, and
took the opportunity at the time to replace the box with good current
clone hardware. Everything came up fine, except a critical exe file in
the backup was behaving somewhat differently from the one on the failed
box. I needed to recover the exe from the dead box for comparison
purposes to eliminate program change as a source of the errors.

The original problem with the box was that it was spontaneously
rebooting itself, and a couple of techs had had a go at analysing the
problem, but gave up, declaring that the motherboard was probably failed
or failing.

I hooked it up and booted it, only to meet a message that says: 'Invalid
Partition Table' I could be wrong, but I believe that is curtains for
your data in the windows world - I'd have to partition and reload to get
anywhere (and wipe my file away in the process).

Hmm. Out comes my knoppix CD. I wonder if this will care about the
partition table? 

Boot. Up comes linux, KDE, without a hitch. The ide drives (NTFS) are
recognised and mounted read-only on the desktop. A few minutes later,
I've scp'd the file in question over to the samba server and I am able
to start comparing the files and resolving my problem.

I love linux. Even when I have to use the evil empire's product, linux
is there in the background ready, willing and able to help. MS should be
supporting it, not fighting it! 

After the last couple of weeks drama, I'm smiling :)

Regards,

Michael
