&gt; how very apt.

I g'eddit!

&gt; now, where does one start "backporint" unstable packages...

Usually as simple as:

1. Adding a deb-src line into sources.list, such as:
deb-src <A HREF="http://http.us.debian.org/debian">http://http.us.debian.org/debian</A> unstable main contrib non-free

2. apt-get source &lt;package&gt; (in /usr/src or your build directory)

3. dpkg-buildpackage

4. install, and test your built package.

Things might not go exactly okay, as you may need to install -dev dependencies
to be able to build all correctly, and tweak makefiles and build files and
such, but it's actually not terribly hard.  Debian's documentation is *okay*
covering this, although I'd like to see it done better.

Of course, using your own packages means that if a security fix is released,
you'll need to build a new package :-)

&gt; ~ i have a bad feeling about this "unstable" business

Unstable packages are usually great; and despite the name, unstable usually is
quite stable.  The problem with unstable, though, and the reason why I don't
run it on my servers, is occasionally a bad package DOES make its way in, and
it can break things in wierd and wonderful ways (my personal experiences
include a broken fsck rendering a filesystem corrupt, a broken lilo stopping a
remotely colocated machine being rebooted correctly, broken apache breaking
everything else for days, broken database packages corrupting all data). 
Backporting your own packages, testing that everything works that it should,
is perfectly safe, IMHO.

You can also, of course, search apt-get.org for other repositries[1] of
backported packages, but you're trusting your system in the maintainers hands;
that is, if they stuff up a package, you download it, you might find yourself
with a broken system, so I prefer to build my own packages (but that's because
I admin a huge amount of Debian boxes).

[1] The Qbalt project I'm launching soon, which is essentially a web-interface
& administrative layer sitting on top of Debian, will be maintaining a Debian
Stable repositry which I plan to make rock solid; GPG-signed packages (once by
the maintainer, than again by the core development team once tested &
confirmed), and tested properly before submission into the main tree.  Debian
userland rocks, but something really needs to be done about the state of
packages IMHO; testing was supposed to fill the gap, but it often is in more
broken states than unstable (as it's used for proposed next-releases of
stable, more as an alternative solid dist).

And I know, I can't spell repositry.
