We're talking about Sites that have very limited traffic... (We're certainly
not talking hundreds of hits per day...) But regardless, I'm still
investigating what's what and I appreciate the input!!!

Perhaps my focus is wrong, and your suggestion (which would accomplish the
same thing) would be the best by far?  I dunno...  And that was the whole
point of my post - to get info I don't currently have.

Thanks to all once again!!!  :-)

&gt; &gt; I don't mind the extra $ - provided that I have a dependable, reliable
&gt; &gt; Service that costs less than $150 per month (what I'm currently paying)
and
&gt; &gt; is 'unlimited' in the bandwidth that I pull down - as well as unmetered
in
&gt; &gt; the bandwidth that goes out.
&gt;
&gt; If you truly want a reliable, dependable service, you wouldn't be doing
&gt; this on DSL in the first place :-)
&gt;
&gt; You may also crash into problems hosting multiple sites on your DSL.
&gt; Oh, you can do it, but seeing as ADSL's upload is somewhat capped, you
&gt; may find once you get enough users accessing your sites at once, things
&gt; get somewhat crippled.
&gt;
&gt; You'd be far better investing your money getting a server colocated at a
&gt; dedicated facility; at least, IMHO.  I'd never, ever host business
&gt; mission-critical stuff on a home DSL connection; especially not
&gt; multiple.  If it was my personal domain, and the only thing I really
&gt; cared about was email, I would; but I'd make sure I'd have somebody
&gt; doing my DNS, and secondary mail.
