&gt;  &gt; &gt; Is there something inherently insecure about what I've

&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Almost everything you can usefully do in a shell involves calling 
&gt;  &gt;external commands.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Ponder, if you will, what happens when you pass one of your form 
&gt;  &gt;variables to an external command.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;    /usr/bin/command $variable
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt;Now think of what happens if $variable happens to begin with 
&gt;  &gt;the string ";/bin/rm -rf /", because the user who entered the 
&gt;  &gt;data on your form guessed that you were using a shell 
&gt;  &gt;scripting language.
&gt; 
&gt; ouch.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, bash is not the correct tool for the job here...
&gt; 
&gt; I will look in to perl as Andrew has suggested.

can i also suggest PHP as an alternative? perl's "There More Than One 
Way To Do It" mantra is nice and all, but it can end up with code that 
looks like line noise. i prefer php, as i've found it to be more 
readable (and thus maintainable) than perl. (it's also a familiarity 
thing - i know php better than i know perl - but i think what i said 
still stands.)

it's got nice interfaces to databases and such, and there's lots of 
extras around (PEAR is to php what CPAN is to perl).

(...i'm trying not to start a religious war; just suggesting an 
alternative and a reason why you might look at it. *please* let's not 
get into "my language could beat your language up, easy!" ;-) )
