&gt; Ah... I think I've missunderstood.  (That's the problem when you only have a
&gt; less than foundational understanding of what you want to do.)
&gt; 
&gt; To answer your question (once everything's set up) I don't anticipate making
&gt; ANY changes and as to quantity - there are only 20 Sites (atm) in total.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps (so I'm not wasting everyone's time) what I really should be doing
&gt; is finding an Adelaide based Consultant who wouldn't mind sitting down with
&gt; me for an hour? or so and working out what can/can't be done and/or what the
&gt; best soloution (for me) is...

This list is filled with odd "Off-Topic" discussions at the best of 
times, so you won't be wasting anybody's time discussing it here. :-)

20 sites is a lot for 1500/256 ADSL.  I'd really consider getting your 
own Linux server colocated at a dedicated facility, and to host the 
websites there.  You'll find something for under $150/month, easily, 
with a decent download-limit; I'd encourage you to investigate, and you 
can get in touch with me privately if you wish, as I do this kind of 
thing.  Mind you, looking after your own box can be a bit of work at 
times; you'll get clients wanting X and Y done, user accounts added or 
deleted, you'll need to keep up to track on the latest patches and 
whatnot, and probably keep a track on the system's 
security/bandwidth/usage to make sure nothing's gone amok (which can 
happen); this is no different than if you ran a server yourself.

Again, there's a reason why not everybody does this (although, a lot of 
people do, these days).  Mind you, not a whole lot of work is needed, 
once configured, but you can't just leave things and hope they'll keep 
on working.

Mind you, you can do this all on DSL, and it might run fine; just, 
there's two issues I can forsee:

- ADSL going down.  Which happens randomly, and often enough for it to 
perhaps be a problem (usually adding up to a few hours randomly every 
month, and at times, Telstra screw up completely and it's out for 
possibly most of an entire day).

- Bandwidth.  1500 will probably be more then enough download capacity, 
but the thing is, you're *serving* webpages, meaning your upload 
capacity of 256 isn't very much at all; considering all of that's going 
between your internet usage, incoming/outgoing emails, outgoing people 
accessing your webpage; people will probably complain that things are 
horribly slow.

Again, if it was your own personal websites, DSL might be a realistic 
option, but I certainly wouldn't bank on reliability hosting customer's 
websites - especially not 20.
