Thanks to all who replied, apologies for my tardiness on replying as
I've been somewhat sidetracked in other non-PC matters.

I guess this whole upgrading idea comes from trying to get the most out
of existing hardware without spending too much. I'm a tight arse, plain
& simple.

A few points from my internet meanderings:

1. Yes, the CPU really is a 550MHz Celeron Coppermine & yes it's also a
PIII.

2. This was also found, so the Tualatin will indeed be able to be used.
(converts the FCPGA 370 Socket to a FCPGA-2 370 Socket)

The 440BX chipset used, is also Tualatin compatible.
However the adaptor requires power, so may not be a viable option in the
laptop.

3. Michal mentioned that desktop CPUs are a bad idea in laptops. It was
never my intention to insert a desktop CPU into the laptop. The CPU I
was mistakenly looking to upgrade to was in fact a desktop cpu, sorry
for the confusion.
Most likely look to upgrade to a 1.0GHz Mobile Pentium-III (LV). An
added bonus would be the ability to use the more efficient Speedstep for
power management rather than throttling the CPU presently.

4. Powertweak reports:
Current speed:	550 MHz
Max Speed:	1200MHz
(though just how stable this would be is questionable)
So, overclocking maybe an option. Alas, no multiplier jumpers are
present on the motherboard, any O/Cing would have to be done via
software. Much the same way programs like SoftFSB (Win) & K6Mult (Linux)
work, by flipping bits in the Model Specific Register (MSR) to get the
required multiplier.
If I can get this to work correctly, then maybe creating a custom
speedstep daemon that scales cpu frequency in real time according to CPU
load would be worthy.
As far as the heat issue goes, the CPU currently sits on a cool 31
degrees celsius.

5. Or maybe I should just bite the bullet & get one of these

But I digress...
