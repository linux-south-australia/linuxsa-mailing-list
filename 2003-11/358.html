&gt;&gt; Ryan,

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've played with solutions such as imp+horde and squirrelmail briefly,
&gt;&gt; &gt; but none seemed as featureful as openwebmail.  Unfortunately, it seems
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Squirrelmail, it rocks :)
&gt;
&gt; Hmm, maybe I need to look at it again; perhaps what I looked at was an
&gt; old, out of date Debian Woody version (it was at least 12 months ago
&gt; when I looked at it).

Actually, I have to say I'm quite impressed (using the version from Debian
unstable at the moment).  Easy to get up and going, and supports all the
features I want from openwebmail; IMAP support is brilliant.

Only quip with it is that the UI does need some work (even with the
inbuilt themes applied); IMHO things aren't as structured and organised as
they could be (and the interface certainly doesn't look as clean), but
perhaps it's because I'm used to openwebmail.  But hell - this is open
source.

Cheers
