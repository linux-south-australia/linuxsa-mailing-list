Hiya,

It seems mirror.sa.3fl.net (free for PIPE users, i.e. Internode/Netspace/etc)
have mirrored the 3 ISO's of Fedora Core 1, so I've grabbed them today at work
for use at home on my girlfriend's computer (who quite likes Redhat 9).

Not being a Redhat user, and I've never used Fedora before, I'm not sure what
comes with it, what doesn't, and what people recommend I should download.  My
internet access at home is so awful it's almost not like even having it
(~1kb/sec downloads, usually), so I'd like to download everything I need in
one go.

I'd be interested (and I'd imagine it'd be of much usefulness to many others)
in a list of applications people recommend to throw on top of Fedora after
install; things such as decss dvd players/libraries (?), codecs (mp3 codec
thing, divx?), etc, that don't come with Fedora due to some issue or another
(or do they? - I honestly don't know).  URL's to the RPM's would be an added
bonus.  The machine's basically going to be used as a normal desktop machine;
things such as word processors/spreadsheets (does OpenOffice come with
Fedora?), graphic design (gimp?), media players (xmms w/mp3 support?
mplayer/xine/something for divx/dvd's?), etc.

I'm a Debian user, so I'm used to doing all this digging around myself
manually (grin, apt-get), but a list of essential nonbundled applications like
this would be quite good, IMHO.

Cheers

R
