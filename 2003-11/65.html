&gt; Thanks for the replies guys.
&gt; 
&gt; Today I just had a play around on an iMac with the same specs as the
&gt; iBook I plan on getting. It was my first real experience with OSX.
&gt; 
&gt; I must say I'm quite impressed with it, first thing I went for was 
&gt; bash, quite nice indeed.

Hrm, does 10.3 have bash now as the default shell? (I haven't played much with
it yet, sold my Powerbook the same day the place I work at got copies early,
so I only managed time enough to install it).

&gt; I like the fact that it seems to come with Apache/Mysql/PHP with the 
&gt; OS that's a big plus, as I'll be using it partly for some PHP development.
&gt; Although it's not like it's terribly difficult to get it going
&gt; otherwise.

MySQL does?  Sure you wern't playing with OS X Server?  (That said, there's
things such as fink [dpkg/apt-get, ala' Debian] and Darwin Ports to make
installation of these easy as hell on normal OS X, and they tend to be less
bugprone then OS X Server.).

&gt; Since there aren't any proper 3D drivers for X11 in linux, what are the
&gt; open source drivers like? I'd like to dual boot anyway, at least just
&gt; for the occasional linux usage.

Crappy.  Awful.  Forget it.

Linux absolutely flies on PPC hardware, but forget doing any gaming or
anything on it.   More games for OS X, anyway ;-)

&gt; I think I'll be going for it within a few weeks, unless I come 
&gt; across an x86 laptop with better specs and a lesser price tag. - Doubtfull

You can't compare an Apple to an Orange^H^H^H^H^H^Hx86.  Completely different
toys.

I strongly recommend the iBook, you won't regret it for on-the-road
development; it's a great little machine.  I already miss my old Powerbook.
