&gt; Hiya,
&gt; 
&gt; Completely non-related Linux question, but I'm trying to build some old
&gt; machines for my brothers out of parts I've got lying around here; all they're
&gt; to be used for is for older games and school work, so they don't have to be
&gt; all that flash.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the machines is a Celeron 300A in a iWill PIILS board, which would have
&gt; been nice in it's day - onboard SCSI, the lot.
&gt; 
&gt; It's doing some really odd things, though.  Stick a PCI video card in it, and
&gt; it runs perfectly.  Stick an AGP video card in it (at least, the two I've
&gt; tried) and the machine will randomly switch off without any explanation
&gt; whatsoever.
&gt; 
&gt; I've tried both an old nVidia 32MB Vanta, and a 32MB Savage 4, both exhibit
&gt; the same behaviour.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got any clues on why it would do this?  I'm guessing the motherboard's
&gt; bjorked, but is this a known problem with older motherboards?  Something to do
&gt; with the voltage being wrong or something, perhaps?

It shouldn't be a voltage problem, as there are two different places for
the split in the agp connector, which signifies voltage compatibility
and makes it impossible to plug a card in to a non-compatible socket.
Some have one split for one voltage and some have two if they can cope
with either.
