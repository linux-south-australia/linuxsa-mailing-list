I tell my children today is a day to honour ALL those who fall in war -
no matter what side, no matter if soldier or innocent bystander. To
remember those vast uncountable, unknowable faces, and grieve for their
potential, and to honour their sacrifice on the path to a better world.

Yes, both sides - for even the wrong serve to show us there is better in
humanity, to show us the dangers of extremes and mindless service.

War makes heroes and villians, sure. But in the end, what war really makes is victims.

Lest we forget. 

Because those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; 
&gt; There's been so many posts on this issue, I guess it can be considered 'on
&gt; topic' now.  *Grins*
&gt; 
&gt; Touching this subject lightly - due to the respect it deserves - I'd just
&gt; like to say that while I will be promoting the observation of this minute at
&gt; my work (Optus Corporate and Government Sales) I'd also like to say that the
&gt; recurring theme of the yearly minute we observe (lest we forget) brings with
&gt; it the danger of not allowing the hatred and anger to rest with those
&gt; departed.
&gt; 
&gt; Let me quantify that for those that might missunderstand:
&gt; 
&gt;     * I agree that the sacrifices of those that fought to ensure freedom
&gt; SHOULD be solemnly contemplated, respected and remembered.
&gt;     * I agree that we SHOULD promote the study/understanding of the events
&gt; of the past - to ensure that such mistakes are NOT repeated in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; HOWEVER; I also think we should be dilligent in taking caution that whilst
&gt; we remember those that died to fight off imperialism, facism, communism and
&gt; other 'evils' - that we do not blame and/or victimise the descendants of
&gt; those that died at the hand of those that our deceased fought.  For one of
&gt; the primary risks we take in 'not forgetting' - is in also not FORGIVING...
&gt; 
&gt; My observation (in places all around Australia) is that an embarrasing
&gt; majority who observe the phrase "Lest we forget" - also seem to interpret
&gt; that phrase as going hand in hand with "Lest we forgive"  And for those of
&gt; you that dissagree, I'd wonder how many Vietnamese, Kambodians, Japanses,
&gt; Chinese and/or any other South East Asians you've ever seen who are active
&gt; members of the RSL - and or any other white anglo saxon Australian
&gt; Organisation for returned servicemen in this nation...
&gt; 
&gt; Personally speaking - I don't know any Asians who fought against
&gt; Australia/America/Briton (or their Allies) and I don't suspect any people
&gt; reading this post do either.  My 'argument' accordingly, is that while we
&gt; honour the dead tomorrow, who gave the ultimate sacrifice for civil rights
&gt; and personal freedom from persecution - let's not cheapen their sacrifice by
&gt; persecuting fellow human beings, equally as innocent as the people they died
&gt; to preserve that right for.

&gt; &gt; Hi Pigeon,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is important to
&gt; &gt; &gt; remember those who died in them.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you Pigeon, that was my aim.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I missed the ballot for Vietnam and later when I was free of schooling
&gt; &gt; I tried to sign up but was rejected 3 times. Such is life. I still
&gt; &gt; respect people like my father and so many others who put their life in
&gt; &gt; danger so we could grow up free. One minute of reflection really isn't
&gt; &gt; too big an ask.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Cheers,
&gt; &gt;  Ian
