Hello,

     I have recently had issues relating to my IP address changing for
unknown reasons.  I use a standard RFC compliant bridging ADSL modem.  I am
getting my ADSL service from Internode.  I have called a few times about
this issue wanting to know why (as I thought it was on their end) and the
level 1 helpdesk there hasn't been able to solve this with a correct answer.
This issue is not a level 1 helpdesk issue I might add, so don't take it as
if I am bagging their helpdesk.  I have tracked down my issue to being the
time for LCP echo request/reply timeouts.  In RedHat 9.0 the default LCP
timeout for pppoe-3.5 (Roaring Penguin) is a big 80 seconds.  Now I don't
really know where they got that number from nor do I care but I have
adjusted this down to 10 seconds which is quite reasonable to me and
everything seems to be in working order.  The exact error I _was_ getting
was:
Inactivity timeout... something wicked happened on session NNNN
where "NNNN" is the session ID(number).  I know that there are a few
internode employees subscribed to this list and since it is applicable to
both internode support for linux and anyone running RedHat 9.0 with
pppoe-3.5 (but not limited to those), I figured that this might be useful
for some.  This affected me in several ways but I figure the worst was in
the middle of ssh sessions vi'ing a file, repeatedly.
