Hi.

&gt; Michael,

&gt; &gt; &gt; But this only proves that there IS stolen code in the open 
&gt; &gt; &gt; source code base. Which makes ALL installations of open source 
&gt; &gt; &gt; material suspect. I'm not sure whether *this* would actually 
&gt; &gt; &gt; do us any good at all.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; bzzt* Huh? 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What statement exactly are you suggesting proves that there IS stolen
&gt; &gt; code?
&gt; 
&gt; I was being slightly unclear. It would have read better if I'd 
&gt; said:
&gt; 
&gt; "But if SCO does turn up with code that it wrote and did not 
&gt; give away, but it is indeed in the kernel, then it actually 
&gt; proves that SCO is correct."

Umm. That is correct. You are suggesting that if SCO were able to prove
their case, they would have a case. Would you have it any other way?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; It is just as possible, perhaps more so, that there is code from Linux
&gt; &gt; in SCO Unix. This certainly happened in the BSD case.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The only 'proof' of anything is that it is not possible to emphatically
&gt; &gt; know either way unless you have access to unix code, and the kernel
&gt; &gt; developers don't want to see it for obvious reasons.
&gt; 
&gt; Which of course befuddles the matter totally :(

For those who wish it so. Kernel developers don't want to see unix code
to avoid taint and IP claims like those being made now.

/me thinks that David is having one of his obtuse days.
