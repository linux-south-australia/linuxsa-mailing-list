&gt;At <A HREF="http://www.lindows.com/lindows_michaelsminutes.php">http://www.lindows.com/lindows_michaelsminutes.php</A> you can read

&gt; I've got a strange phone call this morning from Microsoft
&gt; Netherlands. They are saying that they are preparing a trial here
&gt; against Lindows and they want to involve my company DV Computer
&gt; Systems (www.dvcs.nl) in this trial because I sell my computers
&gt; with Lindows Operating System...
&gt;"
&gt;Seems that the MS behemoth may be looking at targets outside of its US 
&gt;monopoly.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,

Some more details for your entertainment:
The dealer immediately contacted Lindows, and their CEO, Michael 
Robertson, said he would be prepared to come over the same week to join 
in the discussion with M$ today, as this would also be infringing on 
Lindow's rights. When the dealer then contacted M$ to inform them of 
that fact, they were suddenly less interested in proceeding that same 
week. Robertson will still be visiting the dealer, but has postponed his 
visit b/c of Thanksgiving. M$ initially was not willing to respond. M$ 
Netherlands later released a statement in which they indicate that they 
only try to protect their trademark and want to prevent the name Lindows 
being used in the Netherlands. They claim to do so because they might 
otherwise lose their Trademark.

IMNSHO they just try to set a precedence outside the USA to be able to 
use it against Lindows in the upcoming case in the USA...
