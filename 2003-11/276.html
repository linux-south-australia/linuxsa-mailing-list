Here's what I submitted to their feedback form. It has as much chance of being 
published as I have of winning "Australian Idol" :)

Nice to see the sort of unbiased reporting I've come to expect from The 
Advertiser.

"Microsoft no longer offers the only game in town when it comes to office 
software but it retains its lead by a long margin with the latest Office 2003 
editions."

Microsoft has never been the only game in town. The concepts of a word 
processor, spreadsheet, and the like, were all done before Microsoft decided 
to get in on the act. Lotus 1-2-3, was the first "spreadsheet" application, 
and appeared on the scene as far back as 1983. Rarely in its time has 
Microsoft invented anything, they've usually either bought an existing 
product as a base, or just copied an existing product. Not that this is 
unusal in the software world, but don't give them the credit of "inventing" 
anything, as they rarely do (well they did "invent" MS Bob, but we all know 
how that turned out).

"There's also the worthy Lotus SmartSuite package which is available through 
IBM, though the company doesn't seem to be working very hard at developing or 
even marketing it."

Lotus is still a huge deal to IBM, and they *are* releasing new versions and 
actively developing the product. Just because they don't pay *you* to write 
glowing reviews/advertisements of their products, doesn't mean they don't 
exist or aren't used.

"You could get by with lesser offerings from Corel (WordPerfect Office 11), 
Sun Microsystems (Star Office 7) and the free OpenOffice.org suite, which 
contains the core modules on which Star Office is built."

How can you conclude that those products are indeed "lesser", without 
providing any information whatsoever on _why_ you conclude they are a "lesser 
offering" to Lord Bill's Golden Office Suite. Just who are these products 
inferior for? The free openoffice.org suite matches a large number off 
Office's features (and offers a number of features not included in Office, 
such as export to PDF), and is more than adequate for certain classes of 
users who won't even use all of its features, let alone just "get by".

Openoffice.org recently released version 1.1, how about giving us a review of 
that? Prove to us that the "articles" in the technology section of the 
Advertiser are not simply "cash-for-comment", and give a fair, unbiased 
review of a non-commercial product. Surely the price (specifically, $0) is 
right for some of your readers, or is that precisely the problem?

The rest of your "review" couldn't have been said better by Bill himself, and 
is not even worthy of further comment.

Do us a favour and give your readers a little more credit.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not sure if any of you read the Saturday paper (I usually don't),
&gt; &gt; but there
&gt; &gt; was a choice article on Office 2003, also hosted on the web here:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,7864810">http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,7864810</A>%255
&gt; &gt;E21669,00.html
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nice to see Openoffice.org get a mention, I quote here:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "You could get by with lesser offerings from Corel (WordPerfect
&gt; &gt; Office 11),
&gt; &gt; Sun Microsystems (Star Office 7) and the free OpenOffice.org
&gt; &gt; suite, which
&gt; &gt; contains the core modules on which Star Office is built."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Nice to see the Advertiser is still full of in-depth, unbiased
&gt; &gt; reporting when
&gt; &gt; it comes to technology (or anything for that matter).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I notice they have a "Have Your Say" feedback form on that
&gt; &gt; website, I might
&gt; &gt; just have to tell them how wonderful I thought their "review" was.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
