Who would have thought, I burn some CD's for someone and then they cause
trouble for me... Ah well.

The reason behind it is not at all technical. Linux boxes cannot bypass the
proxy (any easier than anything else can). They cannot sniff the network
(any easier than anything else can) FYI it is fully switched 100Mb with Dual
Gb Uplinks to a 256Gb core switch. If you did sniff the network you would
fill up the paltry amount of free disk space in minutes with NETBIOS
broadcast crap and NDPS and SLP junk, not really worth the effort.

The proxy isnt setup transparently we just use IEAK scripts for browser
settings. Linux users can just manually add the proxy IP address, but
without going into details, only a select few machines can actually get
directly to the net (which is technically still in a DMZ). So it doesn't
matter what anyone does on a machine in a classroom they cant bypass it
(except the holes :)) I previously setup a squid box as out proxy (278,000
hits an hour anyone?) :) In fact I posted a question here regarding kscand
with this server.

MMC is correct, it doesn't say no linux. In fact the 65 machines in that
room all Dual boot to Red Hat 9.0.
As for Knoppix. Boot from CDROM is disabled (well an option after HDD0) in
BIOS which is password protected. Which rules that out. Except in particular
rooms we want knoppix to be run in.

As for us (AIT) supporting Linux, Steve Donaldson would back me up, we love
it. Previously we have had LTSP running for C classes, we have 65machines
that dual boot. We have another room with Linux on it, and atm the LTSP has
been replaced by Red Hat boxes that are rebuilt all the time by Kickstart.
We run Staroffice on ALL machines so students can transport docs between
platforms.

All students need to be able to configure Linux (inc. FTP, DHCP etc) before
they can actually pass the course and gain some certification. Web Security
classes etc, all make heavy use of Linux also. So belive me, the sign is not
there because AIT staff don't like Linux.

It is purely political, feel free to speak to EDS as the reasons it is not
able to have Internet (or in fact network access for Linux/BDS). Maybe I can
give a hint, 'Midrange Server' 

:)

Hope that answers all the questions

Michael

Subject: No linux at tafe?

Hi -

Saw this sign (<A HREF="http://www.dezyne.net/nolinux.jpg">http://www.dezyne.net/nolinux.jpg</A>) on the door of a computer
room while passing through Adelaide TAFE. Does anyone know the reason for
this?

I'm not studying at tafe, so it doesn't affect me directly, but it'd be nice
to know. 

Thanks,

Gwyn.
