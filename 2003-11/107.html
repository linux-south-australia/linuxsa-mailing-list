&gt;&gt;There's no margin for _companies_ to provide QA'd free downloadable
&gt;&gt;OSes. There never has been.  I think you'll find that "enthusiasts" will
&gt;&gt;start running community distributions (Debian, Fedora) more and we'll
&gt;&gt;end up paying for full-on 24x7 supported distros which we'll roll out to
&gt;&gt;our clients.  Or rely upon Debian-stable :-)

Stable! Thats nothing. When I was a lad, we used to ship debian-unstable
to clients. The instability is more in the setup and dependencies so you
have to be prepared to do a bit more work but it is solid in production.

If Redhat just want to sell enterprise support, they could just as well
sell Debian and OpenBSD support and get out of the distribution and
packaging business all together. It would be a lot less duplication of
effort.

Ofcourse the next big advance in Linux is yet to come. Firstly you will
have to obtain a certification from a certain Utah based company (no the
other one). Then you can get a job where you can fire up a java
directory app with a red N on it. Then you will be able to edit your
configuration files orders of magnitude slower than those old timers who
used vim and ssh, and pay huge wads of cash for the privilege.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; We might have to go back to the good old days where companies actually had
&gt; IS staff who knew how to patch operating systems, fix problems, look under
&gt; the hood and in an emergency "Ring a Friend" [who might be the open source
&gt; community] and get help.
&gt; 
Nooo!! Not that.
Can you imagine how infuriating it would be to work entirely with people
who actually knew what they were doing! No more, of 'It wasn't me, it
was the new kid. The one from Spherion. The MS certified professional twat.'
