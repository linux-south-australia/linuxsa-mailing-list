&gt;&gt; Not because it isn't possible, but because the open source community

&gt;&gt; "show us your code so we can remove it, we don't want it", and once SCO
&gt;&gt; identifies it (if it is even there, which I doubt), it will get removed.
&gt;
&gt; /me sigh

&gt; But this only proves that there IS stolen code in the open source code
&gt; base.

It proves nothing.  SCO doesn't even know which parts of System V are
original and which have been incorporated from elsewhere.  In August
this year they showed "proof" of code in Linux which they said came
from System V.  In one case, it was demonstrably BSD code.  See
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html</A> for details.

&gt; Which makes ALL installations of open source material suspect. I'm
&gt; not sure whether *this* would actually do us any good at all.

What the case is highlighting is that code theft is possible.  So far
it hasn't shown any concrete examples, and I'm hoping that when they
do, it will point to SCO having misappropriated code from elsewhere.
Take the BSD example above, for example: yes, they're allowed to use
it, but they need to maintain the license statement in the source
files.  If they claimed it was theirs, there's a good chance that the
BSD license statement is missing in that file.
