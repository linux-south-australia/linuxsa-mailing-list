&gt;It's not a bad idea, but the problem was that it was too 
&gt;inflexible for schools that had enough IT infrastructure to make their own
decisions.

...or too inflexible an idea for entire government department who had (have)
enough IT infrastructure to make their own decisions ;) [1]


&gt;I've long thought that if schools chip in together, they could hire 
&gt;software developers to write the applications they need (and 
&gt;they'd have the application developers by the balls, instead of the
reverse) and 
&gt;would be able to get some reasonably priced support.

Eeeewwww, insourcing instead of outsourcing? what a novel idea... [1]

Surely local economic development generated by having your network and
software services provided by large offshore companies would be a much
better way to go..... [1]
