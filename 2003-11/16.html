Hi there,

This is to any Linux members in the Adelaide Hills that may be able to 
help me. 

If you have any involvement with Scouting you would know of the 20th 
Australian Jamboree, 5th - 15th January 2004 at Woodhouse campground.

With the encouragement of others such as Mark Gaynor from Perth (part 
of the LCA 2003 team) I have offered to help run their Internet Cafe 
from 5th to the 11th January (and possibly the other nights until the 
15th).  The problem is the cost of staying on site is too much for my 
funds to bear, $36 per day/night I am on site. If I stay off-site and 
travel there it is still a $10 cost for the evening meal plus $60 for 
the T-shirt and other stuff needed to be Staff.

Is there anybody living within access to the Woodhouse Scout camp, or 
near one of the bus routes that go there, that might be able to host me 
for that period? Even with a spot in the back yard for a tent? Please 
email me offlist if you think you may be able to assist.

Oh and we are going to try to set up the Cafe using Linux and open 
source but that still is in the hands of others but we will be trying 
hard.

If you have had Scouting experience and would like to offer to help in 
the Internet Cafe why not drop me a line and I can hook you up with the 
organisation.

 Cheers,
 Ian
