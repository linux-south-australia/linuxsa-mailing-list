&gt;
&gt;&gt;Do you have any idea how many schools refuse the license packs?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I don't know of any, and I don't think you can. The Microsoft lease
&gt;agreement is a departmental agreement, not an individual school agreement.
&gt;So we have no choice but to pay for the lease. It also means it's not a case
&gt;of just not paying, you sort of have to know how the Education Department
&gt;works to understand what I mean.
&gt;
It's not mandatory for non-government schools. In fact, there was talk 
of the education department being bullied into

&gt;
&gt;For you interest the cost to the school is determined per student, so the
&gt;more students at the school, the more it costs. I cannot tell you how much
&gt;the schools I work for pay, but it's enough to buy a few extra computers per
&gt;year.
&gt;
How long ago did that change? A couple of years ago, it cost $112.50 per 
machine of Pentium class or greater (whether running Windows or not) and 
that included Macs. Seem like a rip off? It looks like a good deal on 
paper (given the software you get), but given that many schools don't 
have a use for things like Visual C++ and friends.....

Oh yeah, that was $112.50 per year.

&gt;As for SINA I'm not sure what they use and to be honest I'm beyond caring.
&gt;The contract is up and we will see change soon, but the logistics are huge,
&gt;so I doubt anything major will happen for a few years. I've been wrong
&gt;before though.
&gt;
*I* got out just in time :-)

It's not a bad idea, but the problem was that it was too inflexible for 
schools that had enough IT infrastructure to make their own decisions.

I've long thought that if schools chip in together, they could hire 
software developers to write the applications they need (and they'd have 
the application developers by the balls, instead of the reverse) and 
would be able to get some reasonably priced support.

thx,
Matt
