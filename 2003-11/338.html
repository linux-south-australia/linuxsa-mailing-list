Michael,

&gt; Who would have thought, I burn some CD's for someone and then they cause
&gt; trouble for me... Ah well.

I was reading this whole thread and thought to myself the same thing. In
fact, given that Stephen and yourself have answered the questions, both on
a political and technical level on behalf of the Adelaide Institute of
TAFE I was going to remain relatively silent.

However, Gwyn contacted the organiser of the Community Software
Distribution Network - SA (CSDN-SA) [1] who happened to not have the
required CDs on him at the time. I happened to know who might have them
and prevailed upon you to burn the required CDs.

Particular people might notice that AIT isn't listed as a CSDN-SA
distributor, that AIT nor yourself were not compelled even by being a
member of the distribution network to burn the CDs for the person.

&gt; As for us (AIT) supporting Linux, Steve Donaldson would back me up, we
&gt; love it. Previously we have had LTSP running for C classes, we have
&gt; 65machines that dual boot. We have another room with Linux on it, and
&gt; atm the LTSP has been replaced by Red Hat boxes that are rebuilt all the
&gt; time by Kickstart. We run Staroffice on ALL machines so students can
&gt; transport docs between platforms.

Precisely.

Say what? Why don't we all register for:

...where for the second half of the second day the conference will shift
to AIT. If after seeing hands-on what AIT is doing with Linuxyou come away
thinking there's"No Linux at TAFE" then--hmmm, David is attempting to not
sound too horrid--obviously the organisers of EducationaLinux 2004 [2]
obviously shouldn't have organised it :-)
