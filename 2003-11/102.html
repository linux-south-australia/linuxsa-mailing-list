Michael,

&gt; There's no margin for _companies_ to provide QA'd free downloadable
&gt; OSes. There never has been.  I think you'll find that "enthusiasts" will
&gt; start running community distributions (Debian, Fedora) more and we'll
&gt; end up paying for full-on 24x7 supported distros which we'll roll out to
&gt; our clients.  Or rely upon Debian-stable :-)

We might have to go back to the good old days where companies actually had
IS staff who knew how to patch operating systems, fix problems, look under
the hood and in an emergency "Ring a Friend" [who might be the open source
community] and get help.

*heh*

I'm not sure whether this is a good move or not. If that community uses,
say, Fedora at home then they might feel more comfortable using Fedora at
work. Or Debian at work...

We'll have to wait and see.

Another area that this could have drawbacks as far as RedHat goes is that
TAFE's might start using a community distribution for teaching especially
if the RedHat is too expensive to buy. And we all know that students will
generally stick with what's familiar, so if they've been shown how to
administer a system using Debian GNU/Linux they're more likely to stay
with a Debian GNU/Linux based system.

I think this move by RedHat bodes well in a corporate sense but is it good
for the Linux/Open Source Community?

:-)
