Hi All,

Was hoping someone could help me.

Installed Portsentry on my Redhat 9 server / router yesterday and I have =
been unable to figure out why it keeps killing my internet connection.

The install went fine. It seemed to be working as planned. Right away I =
did notice that there were alot of IP addresses being blocked from =
(*.tpgi.com.au) on tcp port 135. Every ten to twenty minutes or so. My =
ADSL connection is also through TPG. I am relatively new to linux and =
networking, but does this seem strange to anyone else? The blocked TPG =
IPs were from all over, vic.tpgi.com.au, nsw.tpgi.com.au, etc... And all =
on TCP port 135?

I thought maybe this is regular activity within an ISP network, if not =
Portsentry is doing its job, I hope, and stopping whatever it is anyway.

But after about 3-4 hours of Portsentry running, my outgoing internet =
connection dies. When I go to look at any page with netscape it just =
sits there saying "resolving host for www.google.com" and then comes up =
saying host cannot be found? It is the same from any machine on the =
network. Even if I then turn off portsentry I still cannot view webpages =
or ping out of my local network.

When I watch what is happening with ethereal my comp seems to be talking =
to the tpg nameserver but nothing can be found or resolved?

I left the default setup of portsentry alone, apart from adding my local =
network 192.168.0.0/28 to portsentry.ignore. It had already added my =
name servers and gateway etc...

Anyone got any ideas?

Should I maybe add tcp port 135 to the ADVANCED_EXCLUDE section of =
portsentry.conf, so portsentry ignores tcp port 135? Should I be getting =
that many connections on port 135?

Thanks=20

Lucas
