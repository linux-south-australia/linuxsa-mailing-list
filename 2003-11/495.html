&gt; Sensible IMHO.

Thats the plan, however a decent tape changer will cost
plenty ... =)

&gt;&gt; I'm currently using Cyrus 2.0.12 on a 4.3 FreeBSD box,
&gt;&gt; but there seems to be no support for sub folders, it
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps it is a problem with the mail client. Check your separator is a 
&gt; dot and not a dash perhaps.

the client works ... intermittantly.

&gt;&gt; also appears to be using mbox format to store mail in
&gt;&gt; each users home folder.
&gt; 
&gt; No way. Cyrus is basically maildir with index.

I gave up on Cyrus on the existing mail server and built another
its config seems wacked out and i don't that kind of stress right
now.

&gt;&gt; I really want to deploy separate IMAP and SMTP servers
&gt;&gt; later, but need to show a runing IMAP with a sensible
&gt;&gt; subfolder setup to get folks to use it.
&gt; 
&gt; Try Dovecot. I like it anyway.

Anyhow, I installed the debian stable dovecot package,
configured it and have been using it without any problems
on the server side. it all looks sane, with just a config
path edit and a local transport edit for exim. sweet.

But, any IMAP sane mail client has one hell of a time
trying to keep a straight setup with subscribing to my
folders...

they just dont match, and don't stay subscribed.
i have used Outlook (which most of our users use),
outlook express (which seems to work fine),
mutt (which i want to use, but doesnt get any of the folders),
and mozilla thunderbird (which i use under windows, and mostly works),
and none seem to reliably keep the right set of
folders in the subscription! and its driving me nuts!

and because the folders don't stay the same i can't
filter mail into the appropriate folder!! aarrrrgh!

is this a problem with the way exim delivers messages
to a maildir folder?

is there more than one maildir format?

is the ease of setup now taking its revenge on mostly
working/buggy useage?

cheers,

Kim
