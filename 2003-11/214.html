&gt; Brief Description of the problem:
&gt;
&gt; After years of using the Intel NIC in their hardware, HP (compaq) have
&gt; decided that their EVO model will now use a Broadcom Broadnet NIC. Both the
&gt; HP site and the and the Broadcom site only supply driver source (though the
&gt; documentation from Broadcom refers to a binary RPM that is not able to be
&gt; found).
&gt;
&gt; Novel Zenworks 4 uses Linux to distribute its HDD image, with kernel
&gt; 2.4.18. The only Linux box I have has kernel 2.4.20 (currently). I can
&gt; compile the driver using the make file, but it compiles it against my
&gt; kernel, and won't load on the earlier kernel version.
&gt;
&gt; Now I can install an earlier kernel source, and compile against that, but
&gt; it seems to me that I should be able to compile a 2.4.X generic driver.
&gt;
&gt; 1) Am I of the right impression.
&gt; 2) If I am right, is there some kind of hint you can supply me with to
&gt; achieve this.

I'm not sure, but I know that the Linux kernel does not have a binary driver 
interface. I have had times where I've changed one option and recompiled my 
kernel, and the nvidia drivers decided to stop working (1 option!) and the 
"glue" for the Nvidia drivers needed to be recompiled.

It's a shame, but the kernel developers don't seem to want to make a binary 
interface because it's restrictive in allowing them to change things. I hope 
one day they come to their senses and fix that though.

You'll need the exact source tree of the kernel used in the Novel Zenworks 
box, including patches they've applied and their configuration (I could be 
wrong). You may possibly need to use the same version of GCC as well, but I'm 
not sure.

&gt; Many thanks in advance.
