Thanks for a very perceptive post.

To me the respect is to all who have fallen in war. Each has fallen for 
a myriad of reasons and for a myriad of beliefs but their death is a 
loss that the earth has felt and humanity has been lessened by.

I cannot speak for the actions / feelings of the RSL and other groups. 
They will each have to reach their own accommodation with the devils 
that plague them. 

Part of my prayer is for them to reach the peace that comes through 
understanding and forgiveness.

In the same way that Christmas Day was celebrated in the Trenches 
during WW1, they must realise that they all were fighting for something 
they believed in but when all the rest is blown away they are humans 
one and all.

"There's someone coming towards us!" the front line sentry cried
All sights were fixed on one lone figure coming from their side
His truce flag, like a Christmas star, shone on that plain so bright
As he bravely strode unarmed into the night.

Soon one by one on either side walked into No Man's land
With neither gun nor bayonet we met there hand to hand
We shared some secret brandy and we wished each other well
And in a flare-lit soccer game we gave 'em hell.

..

'Twas Christmas in the trenches, where the frost so bitter hung
The frozen fields of France were warmed as songs of peace were sung
For the walls they'd kept between us to exact the work of war
Had been crumbled and were gone for evermore. 

My name is Francis Tolliver, in Liverpool I dwell
Each Christmas come since World War I I've learned its lessons well
That the ones who call the shots won't be among the dead and lame
And on each end of the rifle we're the same.
