there might be some funky load sensing in the power supply that says "hmm
no load to *these* lines, so I'll not supply power"

but i doubt it.

all at power supplies that I have played with will supply the voltages on
all lines wether anythinhg is there or not.

then again, I have never tried to get voltage out of one pair of wires in
the motherboard loom.

things to keep in mind with these power supplies is that not all the
linesare ground or +ve voltages. there are negative voltages there too. I
believe this is because some devices (namely sound cards and serial ports)
need a negative voltage rail as a reference.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; thanks all...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I will give it a whirl sometime soon, and inform y'all of progress...
&gt; 
&gt; Just an offside to this, has anyone actually tried to power up a system with
&gt; the MOBO disconnected from the P/S? The power supply will not start until
&gt; BOTH connectors are plugged into the M/B (in my test case, anyway)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There was a reply that all wires carried power and there was no signalling
&gt; in AT power supplies.  If there is no signalling, then why doesn't the P/S
&gt; start?  Might be worth looking into and posting your findings to the list.
&gt;
