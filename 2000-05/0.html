Hi.... Wouldnt waste to much effort on wine - last time I looked it
could do solitaire & that was abt it! 
I know it can do some other stuff but afaik nothing of significance as
yet. VMWare can do heaps in that area - do a search on it.

Next - netscape & ur isp... from memory recent netscapes wont let you
add smtp/po3 servers or proxy servers etc IF they cannot instantly do a
successful DNS lookup... presuming this is applicable in ur case... and
it sounds like it is given you cannot "do" anything, it indicates you do
not have your ISP's DNS IP's entered/entered correctly in
/etc/resolv.conf

format for that file is 
#
nameserver 203.123.123.123  (replace with your isp's dns address)
#


Also, make sure you have not done something "silly" like given kppp a
"make-believe" ip address for your end  of the ppp link.... it should
all be Server Assigned unless you actually have a permanent IP addreess.

Hope that helps.
Phil

&gt; Hi everyone, I've just installed Linux on my PC. After a
&gt; little messing about I think I've got it. Having a history
&gt; in Macintosh and recently in Windows, Linux's way of
&gt; thinking is quite different. Here's where I'm having
&gt; trouble... How do I setup and run Wine? (the Windows
&gt; emulator) and secondly, I cant seem to change the proxy
&gt; settings in the Netscape Communicator that came in the
&gt; distribution. I have tried CorelLINUX 1.1 and I currently
&gt; have Mandrake 5.2 installed with the KDE GUI. I have setup
&gt; the PPP dialer and the modem is connecting fine to the ISP,
`&gt; but Netscape, or any other mail or browser isn't talking to
