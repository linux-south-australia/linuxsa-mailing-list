Quoting Glen Turner &lt;<A HREF="mailto:glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au">glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au</A>&gt;:


&gt;
&gt; I\'ve been resisting this, but what the hell...
&gt;
&gt; Their performance during the IETF was miserable.
&gt;
&gt; The background:
&gt;
&gt;   Thousands of Internet specialists come to Adelaide 
after a
&gt;   decade of lobbying.  A few of these people are 
billionaires,
&gt;   quite a few are millionaires, even more make 
recommendations
&gt;   to CEOs, all of them are designing *the* driving 
force behind
&gt;   IT at the moment.
&gt;
&gt;   Unlike most other IETF meetings, this one isn\'t 
bankrolled by
&gt;   a big IT firm.
&gt;
&gt; The strategy:
&gt;
&gt;   You\'d think the government might shout them dinner, 
buy a few
&gt;   conference tickets and schmooze.  That way, the next 
time
&gt;   they are in the US giving a pitch about locating 
activities
&gt;   in SA they will have meet the people and have an 
advantage
&gt;   over competing groups.
&gt;
&gt; The actuality:
&gt;
&gt;   The government didn\'t want to know about the event 
when planning
&gt;   first started.  The Internet wasn\'t trendy a decade 
ago.
&gt;
&gt;   Because the convention center is on North Tce, some 
government
&gt;   people ask what is going on.  They approach the 
organisers --
&gt;   is there some sort of dinner the minister can 
address?  Well
&gt;   no -- no one is paying for one and networking people 
are pretty
&gt;   self-sufficient and are happy enough to test out the 
local
&gt;   restaurants.
&gt;
&gt;   They arrange a meeting with the Chair of the IETF, 
which is at
&gt;   such short notice that it is squeezed in on the 
afternoon of the
&gt;   last day of the conference.
&gt;
&gt;   So they get to meet one person.  The thousands of 
others --
&gt;   the CEOs, the venture capitalists, etc -- they don\'t 
meet.
&gt;
&gt; A pathetic performance during a golden opportunity.
&gt;
&gt; I\'ve been involved with international IT conferences 
held in
&gt; Queensland, and their governement is just so much 
better at
&gt; handling the schmoozing.  And then they follow up.  
And they
&gt; handle the tourism possibilities.  And they help the 
conference
&gt; organisers rather than becoming an obstacle.
&gt;
&gt; I haven\'t had one report of anyone from the IETF 
conference
&gt; being sent info on why they should consider locating 
IT
&gt; enterprises in SA.  So not even basic folow-up has 
occurred.
&gt;
&gt; There wasn\'t even a tourism liason person at the 
conference
&gt; or at the conference hotels.  Yet we had people 
wandering
&gt; about Adelaide on the weekend before and after 
wondering what
&gt; to do.  And they spent serious money -- one group 
chartered
&gt; a jet to fly over Uluru departing and returning to 
Adelaide.
&gt;
&gt; I\'m glad to see IT jobs anywhere in Australia, so I\'m 
not
&gt; annoyed at Queensland\'s people doing a much better 
job.
&gt;
&gt; I am annoyed that my state taxes are paying for a 
group that
&gt; does a much worse job than could be expected.

Very fair enough. I agree that things like this happen 
far too often and in many different fields. The reason 
for this is quite often lack of communication and noone 
being responsible for anything in particular. I think 
that because we know this guy is responsible for this 
stuff and we know how to contact him, it might actually 
be worth our while speaking to him to find out what he\'s 
done, what he wants and how he wants to go about it. We 
could actually use it to our advantage (maybe guide him 
/ them a little).

Thanks,
Matt
