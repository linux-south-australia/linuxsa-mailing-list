&gt; Helllo to all, Im currently running Mandrake 6 with kde and im using
&gt; kppp to log onto the internet. My problem is after every connection
&gt; my dial in number (dialin####.picknowl.com.au) is written to the
&gt; /etc/HOSTNAME file. I have changed the permissions to read only for
&gt; root,for that file, but the problem still persists.Are there any
&gt; other files that need changing or is it something that i have
&gt; overlooked. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Is your problem the fact that the hostname is wrong or the fact that
the /etc/HOSTNAME file is not to your liking? I'm not familiar with
Mandrake, but since it's similar to redhat see if this helps.

Set the hostname with the "hostname" command. (lol).

Make sure that the hostname you want is set in /etc/sysconfig/network
with a line such as 

	HOSTNAME="mymachine.mydomain.com.au"

Stuff should work then. If you were using redhat, I'd just tell you
not to use kppp, cause it breaks too much redhat stuff. If Mandrake is
similar to RedHat then you may have this problem. Use "netcfg" to
create the interfaces. If you must you can also use Linuxconf. They
will both neatly create the appropriate interface scripts and files in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. A simple "ifup ppp0" is all you need
to get it going after that.  Alternatively you could use rp3. This is
readhat's answer to kppp I believe. Could be wrong as I don't use it.

If you need a persistant, permanent link you only need put...

	PERSIST="yes"
	ONBOOT="yes"

...in the ifcfg-ppp0 file. That way you don't break anything and you
don't need to use /etc/rc.d/rc.local.

You might also like to use...

	USERCTRL="yes"

...so you don't have to be root to activate the interface.

Once again this is all RedHat specific, and it's all on the RedHat web
site. If it doesn't work with Mandrake, read up on their site how they
recommend you setup ppp links with their distribution. There is always
one "best" way, and many other "ok" ways of configuring interfaces
with different Linux distributions.

Cheers

Alex!
