If you really want to prevent anything from writing to the file, log in as
root and 'chattr +i /etc/HOSTNAME'. I haven't used Mandrake much, but I used
the Step By Step PPP client example at <A HREF="http://users.nf/linux.">http://users.nf/linux.</A> It worked
quite well, and I have two icons on the desktop - link up and link down to
coorespond to the /etc/ppp/ppp-on and /etc/ppp/ppp-off scripts.

&gt; Subject: 	Re: hostname
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Helllo to all, Im currently running Mandrake 6 with kde and im using
&gt; &gt; kppp to log onto the internet. My problem is after every connection
&gt; &gt; my dial in number (dialin####.picknowl.com.au) is written to the
&gt; &gt; /etc/HOSTNAME file. I have changed the permissions to read only for
&gt; &gt; root,for that file, but the problem still persists.Are there any
&gt; &gt; other files that need changing or is it something that i have
&gt; &gt; overlooked. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Is your problem the fact that the hostname is wrong or the fact that
&gt; the /etc/HOSTNAME file is not to your liking? I'm not familiar with
&gt; Mandrake, but since it's similar to redhat see if this helps.
&gt; 
&gt; Set the hostname with the "hostname" command. (lol).
&gt; 
&gt; Make sure that the hostname you want is set in /etc/sysconfig/network
&gt; with a line such as 
&gt; 
&gt; 	HOSTNAME="mymachine.mydomain.com.au"
&gt; 
&gt; Stuff should work then. If you were using redhat, I'd just tell you
&gt; not to use kppp, cause it breaks too much redhat stuff. If Mandrake is
&gt; similar to RedHat then you may have this problem. Use "netcfg" to
&gt; create the interfaces. If you must you can also use Linuxconf. They
&gt; will both neatly create the appropriate interface scripts and files in
&gt; /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. A simple "ifup ppp0" is all you need
&gt; to get it going after that.  Alternatively you could use rp3. This is
&gt; readhat's answer to kppp I believe. Could be wrong as I don't use it.
&gt; 
&gt; If you need a persistant, permanent link you only need put...
&gt; 
&gt; 	PERSIST="yes"
&gt; 	ONBOOT="yes"
&gt; 
&gt; ...in the ifcfg-ppp0 file. That way you don't break anything and you
&gt; don't need to use /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
&gt; 
&gt; You might also like to use...
&gt; 
&gt; 	USERCTRL="yes"
&gt; 
&gt; ...so you don't have to be root to activate the interface.
&gt; 
&gt; Once again this is all RedHat specific, and it's all on the RedHat web
&gt; site. If it doesn't work with Mandrake, read up on their site how they
&gt; recommend you setup ppp links with their distribution. There is always
&gt; one "best" way, and many other "ok" ways of configuring interfaces
&gt; with different Linux distributions.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; Alex!
