Hi...

I have a possible offer for a venue.  I'm not sure if there'd be any cost
involved, and I'm not sure of availability.  But when we've got a more definite
date I can find out more.

Lincoln College is a residential college for university students.  We have
facilities here that may be suitable for the InstallFest.  Here's what we've
got:

- A large common room which has:
  - A small kitchen attached
  - Vending machines
  - A coffee machine (cafe bar)
  - A PA system
  - Plenty of chairs (but not tables - we'd need to get those from somewhere
    else)
  - A couple of whiteboards
- The college has a 2Mbps microwave link to Adelaide Uni.  We may or may not be
  able to use this. I doubt that the college would be willing to pay for the
  data.  But if someone else was...
- We also have a network throughout the whole college, and several servers.  So
  we could easily set one of them up as a file server.  We also have web and ftp
  servers running which would be useful for testing.
- The common room has a TV room right next door which could be used for
  presentations.
- We're in Brougham Place, North Adelaide, which is reasonably central.

So, there's another option if Endeavour College doesn't work out.  If we did
decide to use Lincoln I'd be happy to make the arrangements.

I'm sure most of the people on the list are getting annoyed at the amount of
traffic that this thread is generating.  It's probably time we moved it off to
another list.
