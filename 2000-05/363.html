Can't help with the web cam but I bought a Flyvideo 98 tv tuner card for $99
from www.iswh.com.au/aspsite/productinfo.asp?code=ASS026  

I intended to use it under windows but found it to be the only thing in
windows that actually stops after a reboot. No joke. You install the drivers
etc and it is brilliant. If you turn your machine off and restart, the
software and the hardware can't find each other. A bus mastering problem
arises on some motherboards with non-Intel chipsets, eg Via or SIS.

HOWEVER......UNDER LINUX

Just fire up one of the many apps designed for Brooktree chipped tv tuner
cards (most cheap cards use them). These apps generally have 'bttv' in the
name somewhere. The ones I used came with SuSE 6.2 and worked without any
hassles (2.2.? kernel I think). Just do a search on 'bttv' at
www.freshmeat.net  if your distro didn't come with anything. And just one
warning, watching Neighbours IS hazardous to your health. 
NB (stating the bleeding obvious) your sound card must be working if you
want sound.

Howdy,

I'm thinking about buying a webcam and a tv tuner card soon. I was wondering
if any of you lot could recommend some which work well with Linux.

I'd prefer to use something which doesn't require me to upgrade to 2.3.xx,
but
has enough linux support that it will work well once 2.4 comes around. Also,
I'd like to know of people's personal experiences with supposedly
"linux compatiable" brands.

I'm looking to spend about $100 on each item, $200 maximum.

Thanks.
