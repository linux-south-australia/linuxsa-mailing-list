<H1>FREE DNS Service</H1>

Hello everyone,
      this is NOT a solicited email!!!...  Recently, I switched my DNS to 
granitecayon.com  They provide a free DNS service after I lost my cable 
service... Of course, my cable company provided me with all the DNS stuff 
and never had to worry about setting up bind and all the work that goes with 
the DNS on Linux.. I already had enough to learn... Well, now I am faced 
with this crap all over again and as usual, it is this list that I turn to 
after I have exhausted hours and days of debugging and trying to figure out 
what the I am doing wrong..

here's my info. in the whois database:
<A HREF="http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?STRING">http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?STRING</A>=douchi.net

   NS1.GRANITECANYON.COM	205.166.226.38
   NS2.GRANITECANYON.COM	209.166.62.198
=================

and here's my DNS info. at granitecanyon.com:

douchi.net.  IN  NS ns1.granitecanyon.com.
douchi.net.  IN  NS ns2.granitecanyon.com.

; multiple RP records authorize others to submit zone changes
; from the email address in the first field after the RP
; This email address is in DNS-email format. That is,
; the '@' (at-sign) is replaced by '.' (dot or period.)

douchi.net.  IN  RP ndouchi.douchi.com. ndouchi.douchi.net.
ndouchi.douchi.net. IN  TXT "Nour Douchi,    NIC handle: ND868"

; addresses for the canonical names
; Many emailers expect the name localhost to exist
; in a domain with this specific, reserved address.
; 127/8 or 127/255.0.0.0 is the address of LOOPBACK-NET
; 127.0.0.1 is reserved to mean this host on the LOOPBACK-NET
localhost.douchi.net.   IN  A  127.0.0.1

; The IP addresses below are reserved for networks
; not connected to the InterNet. They are not routable by
; most publicly accessible backbones and are here as an
; example only.

; some useful puns that cannot be CNAMEs because
; they are referenced by MX records, below

; an address for the zone itself

douchi.net.       IN  A  216.81.151.80

; Aliases
; These create a nickname or alias for another name known
; to the DNS, the canonical name, hence CNAME. No other
; records may exist with a name the same as this alias.

; 'Java' is an alias for the canonical name, 'Navy.'

; MX records

; These direct mail delivery agents, like sendmail,
; at hosts which have agreed to accept email for us.

; This assumes that we've arranged with tea.com and
; uu.net to provide this email service for us in
; advance for coffee.com.

; The token 'EXTREF' directs nslint to allow external references.
; The token 'GLOBALOK' directs nslint to allow global records.

; MX records for a host to be treated specially
douchi.com.  IN  MX  100 douchi.net.	; EXTREF

; global MX records for unspecified members of the zone
*.douchi.net.     IN  MX  10  douchi.net.	; GLOBALOK

; MX records for email addressed to the zone itself

============================================

I pretty much followed their example.... The IP address that I have 
specified is a valid one.. It points to a winnt box temporarily as I am 
using douchi.net as my test case... Once, I make sure this free service 
actually works, then I will re-do the process after I bring my Linux box 
here and transfer all my domain over....

I AM NOT ABLE to ping to douchi.net   .... What's wrong????
If you, folks, suggest that I use Linux as my dns box, is there a quick way 
to do it... I have spent a lot of time in the past trying to do this but 
never had any success...

Thanx a lot..
Nour
