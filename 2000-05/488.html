Yes, if that's all you want to run. But the idea of a never-stopping
VM/hardware framework into which subsystems such as operating systems or
other hardware is plugged is meant to be scaleable. So if you want n
operating systems of one type and m systems of another, lots of standalone
multiprocessor PCs become very expensive to maintain as n and m get
bigger. Or even if you want all the operating systems to be of the same
type, only shielded from one another, a VM-like idea can be useful.

This partly explains my interest in www.usermodelinux.org, which allows
multiple unprivileged instances of Linux within a host operating system.
At the moment the only host OS is Linux but there is no reason why this
has to be so. (The rest of my interest is because it is amusing, but alas
this doesn't justify much effort in that direction...)

Comparing Linux as a host OS to VM is rather overstating Linux's current
capabilities though. And neither Linux nor BSD have fine-grained resource
management, which is one of the biggest benefits of most of the expensive
non-stop class of operating systems.
