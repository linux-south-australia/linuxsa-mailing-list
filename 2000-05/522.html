&gt; Can anyone help a beginner with testing Exim.  I have created a basic
&gt; exim.conf with the following code:

This has a number of errors in it and it would never work. I'll give you
the corrected minimalist file here, and followed by one which builds on
that to create a useful Internet mail relay host (not an "open" relay,
which is a very bad thing!). Cut and paste from the email into the
exim.conf file (or ftp and copy, whatever makes sense for you) otherwise
you'll get annoying bugs.

Corrected <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

Minimalist Exim 3.x configuration file

     #Main (global) configuration settings
     # There are no main settings in this example, but the following
     # 'end' must still appear

     end

     #Transport configuration
     local_delivery:
       driver = appendfile
       file = /var/spool/mail/${local_part}
     # You may need to alter the previous line depending on your system
     end

     #Director configuration
     localuser:
       driver = localuser
       transport = local_delivery  

Now start Exim:

   'exim -bd -q10m' should work, ie become a background daemon, and check
   your delivery queue every 10 minutes.

Now check that Exim is running by telnetting to port 25 (the SMTP port) on
the Exim host, and typing QUIT followed by return when you see a banner:

telnet x 25
Trying 192.168.1.1...
Connected to x.idunno.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 calulu.shearer.org SMTP Exim 3.12
QUIT
221 calulu.shearer.org closing connection
Connection closed by foreign host.    

Now try a local delivery (from one user to another, using pine or
something easy like that - don't try with remote Netscapes or anything
clever yet). It should work, by copying files around in the
/var/spool/mail/&lt;username&gt; directories.

Now you need to add some more lines to the minimalist config in order
to have the following features (among others provided by Exim by default):

	* anti-spam features
	* Internet mail relay
	* users can automatically forward their email if they wish
	* copes with mail addresses of the form <A HREF="mailto:username@1.2.3.4">username@1.2.3.4</A> as well
          as normal <A HREF="mailto:username@dnsaddress">username@dnsaddress</A>

Extended config <A HREF="file:">file:</A>


    # Main settings

     host_lookup = 0.0.0.0/0
     rbl_domains = rbl.maps.vix.com:dul.maps.vix.com:relays.orbs.org
     never_users = root

     end

     # Transports

     local_delivery:
       driver = appendfile
       file = /var/spool/mail/${local_part}

     remote_smtp:
       driver = smtp    

    end

     # Directors

     local_message:
       driver = localuser
       transport = local_delivery

     local_forward:
       driver = forwardfile
       file = .forward
       check_ancestor

     end

     # Routers 

     host_exist:
       driver = lookuphost
       transport = remote_smtp

     literal:
       driver = ipliteral
       transport = remote_smtp

     end

     # Retry Rules
     #
     # Domain               Error       Retries

     *                      *           F,2h,15m; G,16h,1h,1.5; F,4d,8h

     end 


Happy mailing.
