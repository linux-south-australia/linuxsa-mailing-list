Hiya,

well, its been an interesting (part time) month or more since I embarked on
my project to build an ISDN router for our company using a Traverse Netjet
ISDN card and a Linux box.  I've gotta say, it wasn't always easy, but I got
there in the end.  I'd like to thank the readers of the Linux SA list for
their helpful advice during the process, I couldn't have done it without
you!

I'd like to say at this point, that when I started this project, I'd had a
bit of experience with Linux, I'd been running our company mail server on
Linux for a while now, but I hadn't delved relatively deeply into the
system.  anyway, on with the story...

The basic install, and setup of the ISDN card went pretty easily, if you use
RH6.1 or later, and follow the instructions at www.traverse.com.au its
pretty simple.  I had problems with Multilink PPP to get to 128k, which was
related to insufficient RAM (the ISDN FAQ pointed me in the right direction
here).  Rather than recompiling the standard Red Hat kernel to reduce RAM
usage, I wussed out and added more ram :) ...  You can find more details in
some of my previous posts to the list.  Anyway, as it turned out, I was a
bit short sighted, and I ended up compiling a kernel of my own a couple of
days later to include the ILD and the traffic shaping code.  We've also set
up a few basic shell scripts for link monitoring and so forth, which works
well.

I had a good go at getting traffic shaping working, but I can't make it work
to my satisfaction.  I've had to shelve that part of the project for a
while, until I have more time.  We've also get the ILD (Isdn Log Daemon)
code from Marc Durdin running so we can do traffic graphs.  ILD graphically
showed me the value of open source!  The patch to the netjet driver was for
an older version of NetJet.c than we were using, but I was able to get it
going by manually editing the source files.  I've also hacked together a few
minor changes to the il program which generates the graphs.  I'll finish
them off and tidy them up shortly and release the code, but for now it works
for me :) ...  Without the source I'd have been in trouble!  

We're also running NetSaint for monitoring of our public and internal
servers, another great GPL'ed bit of software!  Was a snap to install, and
pretty easy to configure.  One tip here though...  When I did the initial
configuration, I configured it to send notifications to my email-Mobile SMS
gateway address.  But because of a configuration error, it sent out a huge
volume of "service unavailable" notifications!  When you're playing
Internode per SMS message sent, it gets real expensive real quick!!!  So if
you're doing the same, it might pay to set up email only notification first,
and once your happy that its working correctly, then add SMS or pager
notifications later :)  

So in summary, I've got myself a router which also does its own traffic
graphs and server monitoring.  Now that its running, its totally maintenance
free, it just sits in the corner and does it job :)  I was by no means a
"Linux guru" before, and I wouldn't claim that title now either.  So if
anyone's reading the list, and thinks that attempting a project like a
router or an email server in Linux is beyond them, think again.  The modern
distro's are easy to install, and the support you'll get from the Linux
community is great!

My next project: After being connected to my ISP for 88 hours last week, the
TCP/IP subsystem on my Win98 machine at home fell over and required a reboot
before I could reconnect.  That's about the last straw, and I'm going to try
running my home machine exclusively under Linux :)  I figure there should be
ample support in Linux for virtually everything I do in Windows, so why not
try using _real_ OS :)

Jim.
