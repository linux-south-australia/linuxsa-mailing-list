&gt; Yes, true enough.  But I think the idea of email receipts is more than
&gt; just a patch of a symptom.  Regardless of the cause, user error or
&gt; other, the fact is that some emails have not reached their intended
&gt; destination.  At the moment I have no way of knowing precisely when
&gt; this occurs.  Email receipts would tell me presisely when this problem
&gt; occurs.  Moreover, it would help me in the investigation of the
&gt; problem for I would know exactly which emails were going astray.

Just remember that receipts are an optional part of the protocol.
Even for MTAs and clients that support them there are configuration
switches to silently discard receipt requests.  Larger e-mail sites use
these as a matter of course --  as irresponsible user behaviour
(asking for a receipt on every message) and poor user interface
design (allowing a receipt request to be generated only by altering
a default) would double the message counts of a large site.

So you cannot conclude that no receipt implies no delivery.

Equally, as the receipt has no crypto signature, a received
receipt is useless as a document that proves e-mail delivery
to any level of assurance beyond casual interest.
