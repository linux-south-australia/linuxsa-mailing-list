David!

&gt; You need to understand that English is not David's mother tongue, and so
&gt; the wrong way around his phrases he tends to put.  Surely he meant "an
&gt; angry mongrel."

How dare you say that English is not my "mother tongue"! I am an
Australian citizen and I've been speaking English for the past 24 years.
In fact, one could say that English is my "mother and father tongue".
Nonetheless, in order to avoid being zapped by the Netiquette Nazis, I
should say that English is my "parental tongue" - who knows - my parents
could very well have been two female homosexual people commonly called
lesbians.

I did not mean an angry mongrel. I suggest, politely, that what I
actually said is a tautology. A mongrel [dog] by definition must be
crossed with something. Therefore to actually specify that a mongrel is
also crossed is quite obviously and blatantly redundant. Nonetheless, as
I am sure everyone who reads this agrees, I never put a word out of
place, nor do I intentionally become verbose.

DAVID
