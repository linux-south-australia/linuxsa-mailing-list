I shall coordinate the creation of the "Cheat Sheets". I invite "Cheat
Sheets" on all topics that anyone believes will be useful for a Linux
Newbie. "Cheat Sheets" should show the following qualities:

* ease of use
* easy to print [i.e. graphics are fine but if you use graphics, perhaps
to show how to use a GUI tool, produce one without graphics...ink is
VERY expensive]
* good English

As to the last point, it would be great if any truly multilingual people
could actually volunteer translation services if needed. We are, indeed,
a multicultural society and we may attract one or two people whose first
language (mother tongue :-P) is not English.

Unlike myself! [Oh, I couldn't resist it...anyone who wants to whip me
will have to get in line]

I can accept the following formats:

* Tex
* Latex
* Lyx
* sgml
* Star Office Writer
* RTF
* troff and nroff
* Microsoft Word (yes, I know, I know...please try NOT to use MS WORD)

Your document should contain the following elements:

* author
* short description/abstract
* main body of the document
* references to more "in depth" documents

I undertake to do the following:

* by the end of the week, I'll have an automatic topic submission form
up at my web page (<A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~lloy0076">http://www.rebel.net.au/~lloy0076</A>)

This will automatically catalogue who is working on what particular
"Cheat Sheet" and hopefully also contain downloadable versions of "Cheat
Sheets" for review PRIOR to the event

* I shall work with the authors to correct any obvious content errors
and grammatical/English mistakes

I actually have edited a number of newsletters for various
organisations. I'm sure you would all be aware that I can speak English
with panache and verve; hopefully our "Cheat Sheets" will combine
usefulness with user-friendliness.

* At a certain point of time I shall prepare the documents for printing

I'm uncertain at the moment who will print the documents. I have a mind
to approach the business owner of Copies Now at North Terrace with a
view to some form of sponsorship. He is a friend of mine and has
sponsored a number of worthy causes before. Let me put it straight now -
I am flat broke so I simply can't afford to print the dang things so
someone, please [i.e. RICHARD], tell me BEFORE the point of time how I'm
supposed to pay for them.

I could, of course, hand write each one...but you'd need to have the
"How To Read David's Handwriting HOWTO" :-)))))

I hope this brings people up to date with what I'm thinking. I'm also
going to approach the owner of Market Plaza Computers (in Grote St) and
see what type of sponsorship I might be able to get from him...
