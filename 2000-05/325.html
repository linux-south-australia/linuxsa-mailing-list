Hi Tristan

I have recently been supplied with a Compaq M700 at work.
First thing I did after getting it was set up dual boot with Win95/Redhat (6.1).

The one I have is a P3 500, 128mb, 12gb HDD, DVD/CD, built-in ethernet & modem,
and a beeeauuuutiful 14.1" screen.

As far as using it with Redhat, works like a dream, network, modem, sound all
works great.
You need to download drivers for the modem (a Lucent winmodem, which actually
works!) and also the sound card (Maestro).
Both of these are a piece of cake to install, the Lucent drivers come with an
install script, just run that & the modem works straight away.
The only drawback I have with this laptop is the floppy drive is external &
connects to the parallel port.  You can interchange it with the DVD/CDROM but
I dont use floppies much anyway.
There are a couple of how-to guides on the linuxonlaptops site which is all
i used to get me up & running.  Just boot from the cd & do a text-mode install.
 Configure X after installation.
Absolutely love it.  At least I can say I have one REAL OS on my laptop ;-)


I would highly recommend this laptop for running Linux on.
Check out this page for other laptop experiences:

&gt;G'day everyone.
&gt;
&gt;I've been asked to recommend a laptop for linux use, something that will
&gt;do at least 1024x768 in X, and support ethernet, and preferably modem
&gt;(ie no winmodem crap).
&gt;
&gt;Looking at something with a PIII, 192M+ 12G+. It's going to be used as a
&gt;traveling engineering workstation, so it needs the grunt.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions/experiences to share? :-)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;	T.
