&gt; Whenever I try to run a program that requires X, after typing su to
&gt; access root privleges (installing programs, setup, etc)... I get the
&gt; following error message.  
&gt; 
&gt; "Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
&gt; Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key
&gt; Thu May 11 21:29:59 2000 Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0 at (eval 1) line 1." 
&gt; 
&gt; I've read something about Magic Cookies and
&gt; X somewhere before, but if somebody would be able to explain to me or
&gt; point me in the right direction as to:
&gt; 
&gt; 	1) Why this happens? &
&gt; 	2) How to fix it?
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou in advance....


The xauth program manages your .Xauthority file.

So read up on 'xauth', the man page is a bit confusing at times, but 
when you do understand it you will think 'cool', since in an network
environment extends access to all systems that share that file..

Basically your application is trying to talk to your X server and using
a magic cookie as authentication.  The server is effectively saying that
you are providing the wrong password.

To ensure that X will work for other users do the following (each and 
every time - since you don't want users automagically having access to
your screen).

As the user run 'xauth list'.  It will give you at least two lines like
the following (where the host is your machines name).

ticons.com.au/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  d21f477939f1c373851822be36be51
ticons.com.au:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  d21f477939f1c373851822be36be1

As the user that you want to give permissions as choose the line 
that has /unix for :0.0 or the line without for ticons.com.au:0.0 (one
uses unix domain sockets, the other inet domain.

Issue the command as the other user (root in your case).

xauth add ticons.com.au/unix:0  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  d21f477939f1c37385182be51

And then X apps should start up quite happily.
  
Note that some distributions take on the identity of the PPP link which
means that X may break.  If 'hostname' gives different answers when you
are on and offline then you need to do the above, but change the 
hostname in the 'xauth add'.

If this seems difficult the other option (that is no where near as secure)
is to issue 

  xhost +ticons.com.au

Which grants based on IP address rather than a token.

Be aware that in an NFS environment, anyone who can pose as a user on any
machine will also be able to do same thing.  So keep your network 
environments secure :)

Regards,

Matthew
