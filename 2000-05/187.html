I've been using a Netcomm Roadster USB for over 12 months now.
Havent had any problems with it at all.  The main reason I went for the USB
version was to cut down on interrupt usage under Windows.  (i had both my com
ports disabled in the BIOS to save  a couple IRQs).  And as u said the other
adv. is less power packs hanging around (my power board is bad enough as it
is!!)

As far as speed, I havent seen anything noticeable, as with all modem use, it
all comes down to line speed/quality.
I've just started using the same modem with Linux, tho had to send it back to
Netcomm for a USB firmware upgrade.  Have to say it still works great.

I havent had any probs with interference either, not sure if this would be an
issue with multiple USB devices or not.  I know someone using a USB hub with
modem, scanner & printer hanging off it, & they dont seem to have any problems.


HTH 

&gt;Has anyone had any thoughts on the value or other, of USB modems?
&gt;
&gt;I have heard differing views -one party says there are speed gains
&gt;-another says there are none. One of the advantages is not having to
&gt;bother with a separate power supply. One of the disadvantages could be
&gt;in not having a shielded cable. If they mingle with each other behind a
&gt;PC they may be prone to interference.
