What you have said about delivery receipts is quite correct.

...but

&gt; Email receipts are neither evil nor kludges.  They are a sensible
&gt; feature of any mail delivery systems.  What if the PMG* refused you
&gt; a delivery receipt?

They wouldn't, but they'd certainly make you pay for it. This is a
very clearly defined boundary of responsibility. The problem
with e-mail receipts is that there is no additional burden on the
sender, so they tend to get abused.

If I send a letter via AustPost (PMG), to my friend, or a cheque to
pay for my car insurance or my registration renewal, I am pretty sure
that it will get delivered. There are a series of defined protocols or
systems for handling mail that are followed by the Postal services
involved.

If I want to send a court summons to someone, I'm still sure that
they're going to get it, but I PAY for a delivery receipt, just in
case they claim they didn't get it.

The intention of delivery receipts is similar, but unfortunately they
are not often used that way. People are finding that not all MTA's are
created equal, and now find it perfectly normal to send a delivery
receipt with the e-mail because in the past, mail sometimes doesn't
get delivered.

People have accepted that e-mail is unreliable.

But the thing is that e-mail doesn't need to be unreliable, it can be
just as reliable as the post service. (Note the post service is not
100% reliable, but it works so well that we don't often consider that
many mails go undelivered.) The problem is that delivery receipts that
send a clear message (no pun intended) to people who peddle and work
with inferior, bloated, poorly designed, badly written mail servers
such as exchange that it's OK to compromise delivery success.

Rather that promote delivery receipts, let the sodding mail go
undelivered, and let the idiot who seriously suggested using a
Microsoft product in a large corporate environment get hauled over the
coals by management.

Fix problems by educating people, not covering for them.

&gt; *Post Master General.  There's one from the archives.
&gt; 

Who remembers the two stamps that the PGM put out when they became
Australia Post and Telecom?

Cheers

Alex!
