Your friend is technically correct. One is sent by the server (if it
respects this one) and is called the Delivery Receipt. The other is a read
receipt which is generated by the mail client (if it respects it as well).

I AM also a Windows user, does this mean that my information is something
you can't be confident in (I do have Linux set up at home, haven't had much
to do with mail on it though, a single user box makes mail a bit boring!).

Subject: Email receipts


&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; What do people know about email receipts?  That is, where an email is
&gt; sent back confirming that the email you sent was received/read.
&gt;
&gt; A friend told me there are two types of receipts: server ones and user
&gt; ones.  The first type is issued by the mail server to confirm that the
&gt; mail has reached the user.  The second type is issued by the user
&gt; themselves, or by their software, to confirm that the email has been
&gt; read.  My friend is a MS-Windows user so I'm not confident that his
&gt; explanation is accurate.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone explain just how the receipts work, as well as what
&gt; software needs to be operational to make it work.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Mark.
&gt;
