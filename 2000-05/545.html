&gt; Hello fellow LinuxSAers...
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to suggest that we should have an InstallFest this year,
&gt; say in late August or September.

I'll go along with that.  Count me in for BSD installations.

&gt; Also, anyone who has organised anything like this recently (..Sarah
&gt; Bolderoff?), if you are able to offer any help at all, it would be
&gt; greatly appreciated, particularly as I personally have no experience
&gt; organising anything like this at all...

I've done a few things at conferences, and also a rather interesting
experience at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, where the BAFUG and
BALUG (FreeBSD and Linux groups respectively) do this sort of thing
together once a month.

&gt; Given the hype that Linux has had recently, we should be able to get
&gt; a fair few people along (more than 100, maybe even a few
&gt; hundred...), so there will be some serious organising to do. I've
&gt; made a preliminary list of things we need to think about, so if
&gt; anyone has any input on these (or, even better, offers of help),
&gt; don't hesitate to speak up...

We should get the national computer magazines involved.  Anybody want
to tackle that aspect?

&gt; * Linux CDs -- a variety of distros, but probably mostly RedHat for
&gt; learners... maybe some others for people who like a bit of
&gt; variety...

I'm pretty sure we can get lots of FreeBSD CDs.  The dribs and drabs I
gave out the other night were just leftovers; we can get enough to go
round.

&gt; * hats or something to identify people who know (methinks we should have 2
&gt; colours, to identify plain old Geeks, who can do most stuff, and god-like
&gt; Gurus, who can (probably/hopefully) fix the things that the Geeks get stuck
&gt; on.

I don't like the two-level system.  It would be good to have some kind
of identification, though.

&gt; Oh, I also thought that maybe we could aim to do a smaller event,
&gt; but make it a regular thing... perhaps bi-monthly... that makes it a
&gt; smaller job, and gives us an ongoing installfest habit... but it
&gt; could be too much commitment to do it 6 times a year... what do
&gt; people think? Geoffery suggested we have a variety of Fests --
&gt; ConfigFest, SecurityFest, MailFest, etc...

Don't go overboard.  Let's see what this event brings.  Even in San
Francisco, there weren't more than a couple of people with real
install problems in the course of the day.
