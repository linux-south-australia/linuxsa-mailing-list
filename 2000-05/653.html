&gt; do we want shirts only for installers, or do we wnat to sell them to
&gt; installees (possible Linux Marketing and sponsorship selling here...)
&gt; as well?

Of course we do.  ``Everybody'' wants a t-shirt; but not everybody will
want to buy one.  If there are to be any, somebody will have to take a risk
and manufacture some number of them in the hope that sales cover expenses.
Orders up front will help, and perhaps there might be a limited design just
for the installers and organisers, but remember TANSTAAFL: everybody pays
for their own shirts.

An ``event'' t-shirt is likely to sell well, and the more you sell the
cheaper it's likely to be.  An exclusive design for organisers would give
a lovely mystique, but does divide the production run which would affect
the bottom line.

This is rather like the penguin badges, which were really neat.  And just
like those badges we need a design.  If I might suggest: the winning
designer should get a royalty, which could be in kind, such as the first
t-shirt produced.  Gotta get those designs happening.
