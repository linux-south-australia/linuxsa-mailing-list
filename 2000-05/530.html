&gt; The reason I am interested in them is that I am having problems with
&gt; email reliability.  There have been email messages I have sent,
&gt; which have not reached their destination (and no message back saying
&gt; "could not deliver").  There have also been email messages which
&gt; have not reached me.  It seems to only happen occasionally, but it
&gt; would be nice to know when it happens, especially for important
&gt; messages.  Email receipts would seem to be the answer.

How do you know that the e-mail has not been recieved? A better
way of solving this problem might be to trace the SMTP path of the
message that you believe to be missing, and find out where the fault
is. You might find (as I often do) that "missing" e-mails are usually
just e-mail clients that store the messages somewhere weird, or user
error.

It's often better to investigate and solve a problem than to "embrace
and extend" a protocol to patch a symptom.

Let us know the specifics of the missing e-mail.

Cheers

Alex!
