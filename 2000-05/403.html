&gt; At Tuesday's meeting I will
&gt; 
&gt; 1 Take pictures of all who wish to be recorded on the LinuxSA WWW pages

There was a comment made at tonight's meeting (I didn't see who actually
made the comment) that along the lines of a "disappointing turnout of
people who had/wanted their picture taken".  I took exception to this
comment (although it wasn't aimed at me personally), and while normally
I'd just forget this ("process and move on"), I do have the following to
say on the subject (of course it's IMHO).

When I used to take tutorial classes while studying at UniSA, I used
to get accosted by students outside of those tutorial times who'd want
help with their assignments or subject matter.  While I was only too
pleased to help (I'm an altruistic kinda guy, and I do get a buzz from
teaching), it was still a pretty tremendous strain on my time.

On a mailing list, I can pretty much do the same thing, except I get
to pick and choose the questions I can answer, and if I've had a
really long day (and I don't mean just a mere 8 hours of work), I can
just skip over a bunch of messages.  I like to think I put a bit of
thought into my answers (most times - there are the inevitable cockups),
and try to impart some Zen along the way.  I go to the LinuxSA meetings
as much for the social interaction as for the technical knowledge.  The
last thing I want is someone coming up to me asking for help on subjects
I know nothing about, or even on subjects I _do_ know about but don't
particularly care to answer because I've just spent a day and a half
rebuilding a system from scratch with no backups, a severe head cold
and matching head ache.  You may be lucky if I don't disembowel you
with my Krone tool.  To condemn people just because they don't fit
into your pattern of "helpfulness", however, is just plain wrong.

&lt;/vent organ="spleen"&gt;

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
