&gt; &gt; And does David trust Java, for that matter? :)
&gt;
&gt; This is a good question that begs the more generic one, would I run a
&gt; program that comes from some unknown and unknowable source?  Would you?
&gt; It's not Java, nor for that matter is it JavaScript, which I don't trust,
&gt; rather I am concerned if Jane Fraudster can writes a web page
incorporating
&gt; an evil program, I don't want any part of it.

Normally I would be the same, but then, if I could run such a program in a
sand box, it would be fine -- I would run anything if the sand box was
secure... The issue (for me, at least) is "Is the Java Sandbox secure?"...
obviously, the only computer that you can actually call "secure" is one that
is turned off and unplugged, but my readings (from Sun and many third
parties, both pro- and anti-java), indicate that it is sufficiently secure
for me to be prepared to trust it (assuming it is configured correctly, and
this is where I have most of my doubts, because the least secure part of any
system is the human link...)
