Hi Mike
There are actually quite a few USB modems working under linux right now, my
Netcomm Roadster II USB being one of them ;-)
(By working, I mean full comms functionality that I had under Windoze)
Check out the working devices link from the linux-usb site and have a look at
the Comms devices.
Admittedly I had to return my modem to Netcomm for a USB firmware upgrade, tho
one has to do this for W2K also.
Its been working great with the 2.3.99 backport to 2.2.14.
AFAIK the only requirement for a USB modem to work with the current kernel USB
code is that it conforms to the relevant CDC & ACM protocols/standards.

Regards

&gt;thank you for that info, i am comfortable with pci / lucent issues.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The only difference between a USB modem & a standard serial modem is that
 the
&gt;&gt; USB cable transmits both data & power to/from the device.  Unlike the winmodems,

&gt;&gt; USB is not a Microsoft proprietary thing, its an industry standard, therefore

&gt;&gt; most USB devices should work under Linux if they conform to industry standards.

&gt;&gt;  In the case of a modem, these are the CDC & ACM standards.  Check out www.linux-usb.org

&gt;&gt; for more info + links to the latest USB kernel code backport for 2.2.14 kernels.

&gt;
&gt;I am not aware of any usb modem actually working under linux. I understand
your
&gt;distinction between the usb interface, and modems. My limited knowledge, and

&gt;single encounter, with a usb modem was that it was controllerless and required

&gt;the cpu to do the signalling. According to the site above, work is in progress

&gt;on a donated 3Com usb 56k modem. Since 3com established the initial winmodem

&gt;design I can only assume it is not a hayes AT command set, controller type

&gt;modem and it is not a simple matter of patching setserial into the (patched)
usb
&gt;part of the kernel.
