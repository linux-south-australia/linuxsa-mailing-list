Hi,

I am investigating ways to make my courses available for personal use.

It is clear that there are people who are prepared to pay for a course of
the type that I have developed, but there are also people who would like
access to the material but who find the cost of a professional course
beyond what they can justify.

My intent is that people can make use of the course materials for personal
use for no charge. However, people who want to use the course materials to
give courses and charge charge for those courses must pay me a fee to cover
the cost of developing and maintaining the course materials.

To that end, I am looking for licences that would allow me to do this. If
anyone has seen such licences, I would be very interested in looking at
them. If I can find the right licence terms, I would be that much closer to
making the courses available.


Regards
