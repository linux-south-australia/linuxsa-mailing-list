&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There was a guy at the LinuxSA meeting a couple of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; months ago who was from the SA Government. He was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talking about making Adelaide the Linux capital of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Australia or something....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; There's a paragraph on the SA Govt web site about an intra-state migration
&gt;&gt; programme called "Bring Them Back Home", at <A HREF="http://www.sa.gov.au.">http://www.sa.gov.au.</A> There is
&gt;&gt; a contact link there which I just used, pointing out Glen's recent posting
&gt;&gt; in the LinuxSA web archive and adding a few comments of my own. Soon after
&gt;&gt; I received what appears to be a manually generated message from a Janette
&gt;&gt; Peucker, <A HREF="mailto:Peucker.Janette@saugov.sa.gov.au">Peucker.Janette@saugov.sa.gov.au</A>, who works for the Department of
&gt;&gt; Premier and Cabinet.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So if people have _polite_ and _constructive_ opinions about government IT
&gt;&gt; investment in SA, you might like to send them in to the Premier's staff.
&gt;&gt; From the response I received I'd suggest that the email address
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="mailto:premier@saugov.sa.gov.au">premier@saugov.sa.gov.au</A> should work, although I didn't know that at the
&gt;&gt; time and used the rather awkward web form at
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/premier/contact_us/contact.html.">http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/premier/contact_us/contact.html.</A> Well
&gt;&gt; thought-out opinions are much more likely to be noticed.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is, how can one have polite and constructive opinions,
&gt; when the current government has made so many egregious mistakes that
&gt; will go on costing the state for years to come.

That may be a problem.  But it doesn't alter the fact that Dan is
right: if you want to persuade them to do something, you must first
get them to listen to you.  If they're making such stupid mistakes,
that makes it all the more important to try to influence them.
