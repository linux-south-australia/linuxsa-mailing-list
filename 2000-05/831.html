&gt; You said:
&gt; &gt; cool -- how many, etc?
&gt; 
&gt; I said:
&gt; &gt; LinuxSA is planning an InstallFest for later this year.  
&gt; Would Red Hat be able
&gt; &gt; to donate some CD's for us to give away?  Maybe, say, 30 to 50?
&gt; 
&gt; And Mark White said:
&gt; &gt; Sure David.  I'll ask Louise Hodgkin (our Marketing head) to action.

cool...

&gt; &gt; PS could people please inform the list of what they are 
&gt; organising before
&gt; &gt; calling businesses acking for things
&gt; 
&gt; Good point.  I hope I didn't step on any toes.  Mark White I 
&gt; are both on
&gt; the AUUG committee so I figured I should take the liberty to 
&gt; ask him.  I
&gt; also posted to the aussie-isp list asking for a donation of network
&gt; bandwidth, and offered to include their logo on the t-shirt 
&gt; as qid pro quo.

Hmm... OK -- I've already had some contact with a few ISPs... will inform
soon when I can get some more definite info (really depends on timing and
location, but methinks that if we do it at endeavour house in &gt;2 months
time, this will be already sorted out (I can't say more than that until I
get the OK from the person involved...) )

&gt; I was planning to approach other Caldera, Corell, TurboLinux 
&gt; & SuSE, too.
&gt; Does anybody object?

Go for it. However, if we get any disks from them, we are really obliged to
give some sort of promotion to them (ie not explicitly promote one on top of
the other)...

&gt; All sponsors should be invited to have their name or logo on 
&gt; the t-shirt.
&gt; I wouldn't want the t-shirt to become a "walking billboard", 
&gt; but there'll
&gt; probably be only a few sponsors.

myes... I'd be expecting at least four or five...

I'm leaning more and more in favour of leaving it for at _least_ two months,
unless someone can come up with a few good reasons for rushing to get the
special guests...
