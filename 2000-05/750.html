Jake et al:

In order to ping an address:

* start up a terminal window or log into a terminal (ctrl+alt+F1 or F2
or F3)
* type in ping 203.11.90.240 (that's one of senet's IPs)
* type in ping www.senet.com.au

Simple eh?

&gt; OHMIGOD. Davey babey

Now, that's a first. Are you making me an offer :-P ?

&gt; pull your head in dude. Sure Java is broken in
&gt; places, but I think you'll find its mostly to do with the VM on that
&gt; platform.

I think this is a question of semantics really. The language on paper is
fine. It's actually quite reasonable. Its implementation on various
platforms simply is broken to the extent where I wouldn't trust it in an
enterprise, mission critical environment. Hence, it doesn't do what it
purports to do. Hence it's broken.

&gt; &gt; i) DROP kppp imediately
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This will probably fix your problem
&gt; 
&gt; This is probably true, but you'll have to replace it with something, and
&gt; since linux is trying to be warm and fuzzy, alot of people are not going
&gt; to replace it with good old "ifup ppp0".

Warm and fuzzy...oh my! What's wrong with netcfg by RedHat? It's a
tcl/tk tool that is, essentially, an interface to ifup [whatever you're
sticking up]...kppp seems to create the most amazingly undetectable
problems.

GUI utilities on the Desktop are a Good Thing [tm]. GUI utilities in an
enterprise environment encourage people who have no idea what they're
doing to think they've suddenly become a "Unix/Linux System
Administrator". In my experience, a lot of companies would be better off
contracting system admin support to people who know rather than people
on-site, who only know a little bit, breaking things...

But, again, it's in my interest not to get too heavy handed on this
because I - and no doubt a lot of others - stand to benefit from the
money we are paid to fix the problems that shouldn't have ocurred in the
first place.
