&gt; Just had a look at the LinuxSA site hoping to find details about the
&gt; next meeting and found nothing. What caught my eye was one of the
&gt; proposed topics. When can the Ext2 File System Intro be done. I am
&gt; interested in knowing the difference between Ext2 and you know what.
&gt; Haven't found any really good explanations yet. So that's my vote for
&gt; the next meeting.

I'm doing what a uni course would call "applied disk I/O concepts"
including by special request:

  - partition sizes for common server applications

  - moving data between partitions on a running system

  - devfs - what's the fuss

but also including disks basics, SCSI and other bus basics,
designing I/O subsystems, competing filesystems, optimising
for speed, RAID, LVM, SAN.

I don't think that "ext2 filesystem internals" is a suitable
meeting topic.  It's basically a standard UNIX filesystem,
and McKusick et al's "The Design and Implementation of the
4.3 BSD UNIX operating system" gives the essentials.  The
minutae are probably better covered by private study of the
source code.

I'm happy to compare "ext2" with "you know what" if you want
to be a bit more specific -- there's a huge number of competing
next generation disk filesystems: ext3, ReiserFS, and others
on the way from SGI, IBM and Veritas.

Glen.
