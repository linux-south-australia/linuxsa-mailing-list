I was going to discipline myself to leave the computer
and do something else for a change because of the rate of
e-mails right now. But....  I can't resist this one.

Way back in the primeval internet days (even before
most people had a live connection) there were the
first makings of a serious virus - the vacation programs!!!*%$

Sometimes, I would be reading through the Usenet mail
(e.g. the new C++ mailing list that Stroustrup used
to participate in), and then a message would come out:
"I'm on vacation". But then that message got distributed, and
another reply was sent to this, and a reply to a reply etc.
this went on for about 6-12 hours the first time I noticed it.

Whenever you have a system with amplifiers and feedback, you
have the potential for an exponential runaway situation.

Of couse, nowadays, most vacation programs can recognize a
response to their own message, but they shouldn't be responding
to distribution lists in the first place.

It is almost never a useful thing for me to know that someone
is on vacation, or out of the office for the day.
This is a prime example of automation gone wrong.

This leads me to speculate that one could use Unix mail,
especially vacation programs and bounce messages and other such
automated stuff to generate an e-mail storm in the Unix world.

So yes, this _does_ include the vacation program.
And under the list of dangerous automated software
I would also mention web-site downloading software
like this wget thing.
Everytime someone tries to automate the role of humans,
very careful analysis of deadlocks, livelocks and
exponential runaways should be done.

As I've said in earlier posts, if the fundamental principles
of engineering were applied to software (I'm thinking of
MS here), then nasty things wouldn't happen so often on the net.
But what can you do when hundreds of millions of ordinary mugs
are allowed to connect directly to a trillion dollar
engineering structure like the Internet which is still
just a demonstration prototype?
I predict that a new Internet will be developed, of whose
parameters the current Internet is not worthy to comtemplate.
And this new Internet will be mathematically proven to have
no possibility of runaway feedback, deadlocks or livelocks.
And we will all be able to talk in our retirement about
the good old days when hackers were hackers and....

I think I need a coffee.
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
