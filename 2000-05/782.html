Hi Richard,

Alan Cox's TODO list still has file-system corrupting bugs listed against
this kernel, so you'll want a dedicated test PC at this stage.

I've got it running on an old 486 looking at the LVM stuff, which seems
very nice and really begs for a good GUI admin tool to be just wonderful.

The QOS networking is also nice, but the ethernet VLAN drivers that
AARNet submitted didn't make it, so I'm not sure how useful IP-only
QOS is in the real world of IP over ethernet.

All the other 'enterprise' fixes seem to be there though.  Big disks,
big memory, 32bit UIDs, RAID.  Storage area networks are still a bit
dodgy -- fibre channel support appears to be integrated into the SCSI
driver, devfs is in, but ext2's metadata is still not portable across
CPU architectures.  On the user space side, there's still no lock manager.

It seems to be at the 'rough sandpaper' stage -- some drivers still die
and it will be a while before the 'polish' stage.

I really think that Linus jumped the gun with the 'test' appelation.
I suppose he's saying that it's ready for the Slashdot crowd to load
so that the bugs which only appear from mass testing become apparent.

You need some new user-space utilities.  Notably for RAID and LVM.

Glen
