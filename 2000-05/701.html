Brian!

&gt; Netscape cannot get out to the internet. The dial up, logging on, is all
&gt; working ok (kppp). PPP is started. But Netscape has stopped talking to
&gt; it. It just says something like host not found, or xxxx.net.au not
&gt; found. I have looked at a number of files without any luck
&gt; ....etc/hosts, etc/network, etc/resolv.conf. PPP just sits there waiting
&gt; -waiting -waiting for some data.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem started when I tried to kill a lock file that Netscape
&gt; advised was still in existence, at start up. From that point on the
&gt; problem commenced.

It's not entirely helpful BUT I am subscribed to about 5 different
general e-mail lists:

* PPP problems

Mainly caused by kppp. I don't care what KDE enthusiasts say...avoid it
like the plague. It causes unknown, unfixable, stupid problems..

* Netscape problems

Netscape itself on linux, is, essentially broken. Most Netscape problems
are induced by Java (that idiotic programming language which claims to
be universal but is really a Windows programming environment that's
somehow been ported to Unix). You don't seriously think Sun believed
they could make money out of the OpenSource community do you?

In other words:

i) DROP kppp imediately

This will probably fix your problem

ii) Take a good look at the last 200 lines of /var/log/messages

It might give you hints :-)

iii) Try using something less buggy than Netscape to test your network
connections

Try lynx, ping whatever. Make sure your Internet connections work before
using Netscape :-) No Internet connection, DNS or other service just as
important and any browser won't work as expected.
