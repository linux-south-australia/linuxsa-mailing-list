 &gt; Golly. Now there are _two_ complete systems of shared memory.
 &gt; And then there's some POSIX API for shared memory which I've found
 &gt; in other people's source. That's 3 systems!
 &gt; (The Posix API is flagged by thecpp macros: 
 &gt; _POSIX_SHARED_MEMORY_OBJECTS and _POSIX_SEMAPHORES.)
 &gt; Just when I was coming to grips with the first system....
 
The POSIX version is essentially the same as the BSD version.

 &gt; And now you've explained it - there's more than one shared memory
 &gt; system going on! 
 &gt; One operating system, two or more shared memory systems.

They're just different API-interfaces to the same internal implementation.

 &gt; &gt; Not so -- Firstly, there are kernel limits on the amount of SysV
 &gt; &gt; shared memory segments which are smaller than the amount of physical
 &gt; &gt; RAM, and secondly shared memory is paged-in and paged-out just like
 &gt; &gt; any other memory:  You seem to be under the misconception that 
 &gt; &gt; shared memory segments are somehow wired in to physical memory, 
 &gt; &gt; but I can assure you that they are not.  Assuming your kernel is
 &gt; &gt; configured appropriately, there's nothing stopping you from allocating
 &gt; &gt; 128 Mbytes of shared memory on a 64 Mbyte system.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The documentation(s) had explained that only superuser can lock down
 &gt; shared memory.

That discussion is independent of shared memory -- the superuser can
lock down a certain amount of memory, period (look at the manpage for
mprotect(2) for examples).

 &gt; This would obviously be useful for speeding up software
 &gt; a bit.

In practice, though, that doesn't happen:  The pageout algorithm operates
on an LRU basis, so any pages which are frequently accessed will never
be sent out to backing store, so there's no point wiring them in to 
memory.  In practice there are very, very few UNIX programs which ever
attempt to wire-down pages.

[ those who say it has useful real-time applications:  Give me a break.
  If you want to write real-time software, don't use UNIX. ]

 &gt; I was worried, though, that a runaway process could use up
 &gt; the swap space, which obviously is also finite.

That's what limits are for: "man setrlimit"

 &gt; PPS. Another problem:
 &gt; My search of the manuals indicates no info on how to do
 &gt; safe concurrent access to the mmap() BSD style of shared memory.
 &gt; Now that I've learned up on SVR4 style memory sharing, maybe
 &gt; I'd better stick to that, because it at least I've found
 &gt; the manuals for doing semaphores for that.

You can use SysV semaphores independently of SysV shared memory.
It's also common to use fcntl(2) region locks to synchronize access
to mmap()'ed regions:  If you want exclusive access to a shared
memory segment, obtain exclusive access to the lockfile first.  There
are various techniques which are useful for reducing the obvious
syscall overhead that'd imply (a syscall to acquire the lock, another
one to free it), which Glen has outlined in another message applied
to an ever-so-slightly different scenario.
