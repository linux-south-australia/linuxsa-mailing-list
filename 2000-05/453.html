One of the more often asked questions I hear is "How do I partition my
machine". Usually the answer is "It depends". I have been asked this a
few times this week, so here is my experience with partitioning Linux
boxes for various applications over the last few years.

I've been meaning to do this for a while now. I will add this to the
LinuxSA Tips section, along with any suggestions and improvements.

First of all it helps to know exactly what the file systems are all
used for and where stuff goes. A good reference for this sort of
thing is in the Linux Documentation Project's "System Administrator's
Guide" or SAG. You can find a good bit of info on the file system at
<A HREF="http://www.tcm.hut.fi/~viu/linux/sag/sag-0.6.2.html/c218.html">http://www.tcm.hut.fi/~viu/linux/sag/sag-0.6.2.html/c218.html</A>

Alternatively, if you have a copy of "A Practical Guide to Linux",
then check out page 74.

Here is a brief rundown...

/       Root file system. Should just contain /bin, /sbin, /dev,
        /root,
        /lib, and /etc.
/usr    Programmes and source code.
/var    Variable data, such as spools, man pages, news and mail
        queues, database data.
/boot   Boot kernels.
/home   User data and "stuff".
/tmp    Temporary file locations

The / file system will never need to be more than 100Meg. Make it
that.

The /usr file system will vary depending on how big your initial
installation is and how much extra software you download. For a redhat
6.2 minimal install you'll be needing about 250 to 300 Meg (typical
server), and for a full install you need around 1.5 Gig (typical
workstation). Other distributions will need more or less, but this is
a good guide. Any extra software you download may also go in this file
system, so if you are planning installing an office suite or a cad
package, be aware it that it may go in here.

If you are installing software to build from a tar ball or installing
software that isn't part of a vendor's distribution, such as an RPM or
a DEB, you will probably want to install it in the /usr/local file
system. This file system is usually left untouched by the installation
or upgrade process of a linux distribution and is ideal for installing
third party software. If you plan on doing a lot of this, a separate
partition is a great idea, because if you want to do a re-install
rather than an upgrade, you can simply tell your distribution not to
format the /usr/local file system when installing and you will leave
your third party software in tact. The format of the /usr/local file
system is almost identical to the / file system.  Handy huh?

/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin are also the correct place to put
any scripts you may write after you have your system up and running.
This is preferable to placing them in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin or even
/bin and /sbin, as these should really be static and left the way the
distribution intended them. It also makes backing up a system much
easier if all your locally created scripts are in one convenient
place.

The /var file system is the most varying file system, hence its name.
The function of the machine will determine how much you need. For a
vanilla system, I recommend 400 Meg. This is usually sufficient for a
workstation. If you are building a proxy server, you will need a
separate partition, but preferably a separate disk, for
/var/spool/squid. The same goes for a mail server, except the file
systems of interest are /var/spool/mqueue and /var/spool/mail. The
size of /var/spool/mail will depend on how much storage you want for
user's mailboxes, and the size /var/spool/mqueue will depend on how
much mail 'in transit' you wish to spool. Mail server's acting as a
secondary MX might need a lot here.

There are other smaller directories in /var/spool that are of
interest, so I would recommend a /var/spool of 300 to 500 Meg for any
server application in conjunction with the /var of 400 Meg. For a
workstation you may be able to use the 400Meg /var partition to house
your /var/spool as well, but it may pay to enlarge it a bit.

/var/log, as the name suggests, is the final resting place for logs.
Once again the size of this will depend on the function of the system,
but as a general rule it is highly recommended that you have a
separate /var/log to your /var partition, regardless of the machine's
function. This way any stray system logs that fill up will have no
effect on your system other than stopping logging. This goes for both
servers and workstations alike. If you are running a heavily loaded
proxy, mail or web server, you will need heaps and heaps of disk space
here. Fully loaded proxy servers in peering arrangements can easily
generate hundreds of thousands of bytes of log files an hour. The same
goes for mail servers. The mail can come in and go out very quickly on
a fast link, but the log files stay around.  You also don't want a
slash-dotted web site to fill up your logging directory, so careful
thought here will pay off in the future.

The /var file system is also often used for the storage of database
data. /var/db is the file system that is used, and you will need to
keep this big enough to hold your data. Often a separate fast SCSI
disk or RAID will make your database much faster. IO is often the
biggest bottleneck in database systems, and an IDE drive in /var/db
wont help.

The /boot directory is probably the most useful file system, and often
the most forgotten. Having your kernels on a separate partition will
make rescuing a system that has crashed a whole lot easier. This means
that booting the system and recovering the partitions can be attacked
as two separate tasks. Having a small /boot in a primary partition is
also the best cure for the famous "I just installed linux and now all
I get is 'LI'" LILO installation problems. LILO still has issues with
hard drive space above 1024 cylinders. A small 20 Meg /boot partition
as the first primary partition on the system will alleviate this. Some
distributions, such as redhat, are smart enough to assign
automatically the first primary partition to /boot for just this
reason.

/home is where you hang your hat. It is also where you "keep your
stuff". Files you download, projects, mail, documents, mp3's,
everything.  This is the equivalent of Windows' "My Documents",
"C:/download", the desktop, etc. Even if the system is only used by
you at your desk, and no-one else, you should still have your own home
directory in the /home file system. Don't be tempted to add partitions
to the root file system such as /scripts, /downloads, etc. You are
breaking stuff when you do that. Linux is still a true multiuser
operating system, even if you are the only person using it. Try to
keep this in mind when building a partition table. This all starts to
make sense when you stop logging in as root, and start loggin in as a
regular user. It never ceases to amaze me how many people run X as
root. *sigh*.

Many distributions nowadays are geared towards easy and quick upgrades
and everything has it's place. If you keep you stuff in /home/yourname
and no-where else, you can be sure that when your next upgrade of
linux comes, you can just chuck in the CD and hit "upgrade" and your
Metallica mp3's will still be there when your system comes back
on-line.

/home is also where the storage filesystem for a file server should
go. The same is true for web server pages, and ftp server data.
Obviously if you are building a web server, have a separate
/home/httpd file system on a nice fast SCSI disk. Same with /home/ftp.

Sometimes it's a great idea to have a separate /tmp directory, because
temporary files can get out of control. Having /tmp on the same
partition as the root file system can cause problems if you scan a 60
Meg picture into a graphics manipulation programme and it decides to
store it in /tmp.

The only other partition of major interest is the swap partition. It
is often a good idea to place this in the physical middle of the
drive. Then the heads have less far to travel to swap out data when
the system gets loaded. Alternatively you can just throw more memory
at the problem.

Now I'll give you a few 'real life' examples of servers that I
maintain, with the host names changed to protect the innocent.

Here is my bog standard workstation. It runs X. It may get used for
some server functions in the future, so there is lot's of space ready.
I even have a big block of space hanging of /mnt/tmp, and one day I'm
sure I'll think of a use for it.

This next beast is a mail server. Note the use of seperate drives for
critical server filesystems.

Here is a proxy server. Mix of SCSI and IDE.

When partitioning a machine for use, it is always a bad idea to
install everything into a single / partition. Spend a few minutes
before installation considering the functions of the machine you are
building and this will yield a useful and efficient partition table.
The more often you do it the more of a feel you will get for how much
space your distribution needs for different tasks. Now that you have
the above information there is no excuse for poor partitioning, and
you can help make the world a safer place. Next time you see...

...you can do something about it!

Cheers

Alex!
