hi
I am looking through the archives atm, after being away from this list
for 2 months, however can anyone help?

I have an interview with a NEIS business support provider tomorrow and
am trying to think of the best small business proposal to sell them on.
So this is just some last minute research.

I will be working with Linux and perhaps other open source OS's such as
FreeBSD, so...

What type of small business is Adelaide crying out for in this field?
please keep in mind that i dont want to take anyone elses business, so
where are the niches

turnkey?
opensource (OS) support?
OS installs/ set-ups?
pre-installed computers?
after (someone elses) sale service?
cheap routers (based on Linux Router Project)?
Complete networks?
value for money hosting?
other ideas?


or would a completely different focus be better, eg:

contacting windows business users and converting them to OS?
introductory lessons for new users in their home?
Database, language or application consulting?

there must be a niche somewhere for me.

thanks for your time

shaun
