&gt; Cool! thanks to all the other people offering help, too -- I will make a
&gt; summary email at the end of the week, describing who has offered to help
&gt; with what... Please continue to offer help, equipment, venues, ideas,
&gt; sponsorhips, etc...

Just to formalise my offer - I'm willing to help coordinate things, be a contact
point, help design T-shirts, run around setting up the venue, install, configure
and help out any way on the day and evangelise Linux and open source!  I might
even go and collect pizzas! :-)

How about we set up a web page for the event?  Even hook up an RDBMS so people
can pre-register?  On the day, when people turn up, we can enter details into
the database so we can assign the appropriate person to help them
install/configure/whatever and make sure someone doesn't get stuck in a corner
with a non-installing PC without someone who knows what they're doing.  The
installers can also register their skill set so matches can be easily made.

I'll bring other bits and pieces on the day, like spare
coax+T-pieces+terminators, a NIC or two, power boards and cords, screwdrivers
etc.  ie not for general loan/usage, but to bandaid solutions together when
Murphy's Law kicks in.

Isn't there a HOWTO on organising an Installfest?  I'll have a look.  Also
Geoffrey and Matthew should have some experiences to offer from last time.  (As
should Sarah who has already offered!)

&gt; &gt; As for identifying Linux Guru's... hats are a good idea, however I think
&gt; &gt; "InstallFest 2000" t-shirts would excellent.
&gt; 
&gt; yes, I like the shirt idea... do we want shirts only for installers, or do
&gt; we wnat to sell them to installees (possible Linux Marketing and sponsorship
&gt; selling here...) as well? If we want to sell them to installees, we may want
&gt; to give them a different colour -- or maybe we want to write "Installer" on
&gt; the back of the installers' tshrits...

Perhaps T-Shirts for sale for all + name badges identifying installers :-)
