Well to duplicate the mail you can alias each user
and have one of the alias a pipe to a porgram.

You could of course write a little porgram to do the aliasing and set up
the files.

So, I think if you put something like:

username:	username,"|/bin/cat &gt;&gt;/var/usermail/username"

in the /etc/alaises file (and run newaliases of course!), you will end up
with a file called /var/usermail/username with everything that sendmail
delivered for that username in it, in chronological order.


As for the privacy I am not sure, but I think there have been moves
toward legislation on this area and allied areas frederally, so you
should check with a legal practioner fora  definitve answer, but you might
try the various govt websites also, for a rough idea.
Also the commonwealth and state govt bookshops where you can buy the
relevant acts, or the state library.

Govts love to crow about these things...

One would think that an acceptable use policy that mentioned the fact ath
email wouldbe kept and perhaps read by other people might be a good
starting place until you do find out what teh laws are.

I would think you could also make it a part of people's employment
contracts.

Once again advice from a qualified legal practioner would be the best
course.

Jason

&gt; anything like that? If we write up our acceptable use policies to notify
&gt; staff that their email is being recorded, does that make it legal? Where can
&gt; I find out more information about the entire topic?

&gt; Can anyone see any problems with the above? Does anyone know of any programs
