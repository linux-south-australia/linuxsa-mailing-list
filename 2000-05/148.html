Questions about locking shared memory for multiple
child processes.

-----------------------------------------------------
Is there anyone out there who knows how to do
shared memory access correctly for multiple child processes?

As I said in an earlier mail, I want to have an Apache module
to do fair bandwidth allocation (to put it diplomatically).

The Apache module "throttle" turned out to not only be in
need of updating (because the Apache API has changed in the
3 years since it was written). It also does not do what I want.
It balances/limits/throttles bandwidth according to the user ID
of the file which is being accessed. In my case, that would
be the same user ID for all files, pretty much.

I'm going to balance bandwidth according to remote IP address,
which means that I will probably hash the 32 bits down to
about 12, and jump from a hash table into a heap of fixed-length
records, and then do gargabe collection on this in the usual manner.

The problem comes from the fact that Apache spawns a separate
child process for each file request. I'm planning to use
shared memory (shmget(), shmat() etc.) to be able to share
the common data structure between child processes.
(Clearly there are other solutions, e.g. a common database
process which provides services to all child processes, but
I'll try to do the most efficient solution first.)

The problem arises when two child processes want to access
the data structure at the same time. I need to be able to lock
the structure or some part of the structure for the duration of
access, and make the other process wait.

I'm familiar with all of this in kernel modules - you just whip
up the interrupt mask until you're out of the critical section.
But I can't see how to do this with multiple processes which
share a single chunk of memory.

I have a feeling this has something to do with mutexes and
semaphores, but the documentation seems to indicate that this is
for threads only.

Questions:
1. If there are standard Unix functions to do this, what are they?

2. If there aren't, where would I find the algorithms in a
computing book?
(Didn't I once read that this has something to do with Dijkstra??)

By the way, I do know how to do this in assembly language on
a 68k. You just use an atomic test-and-set.
But C doesn't seem to have this sort of thing.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  I haven't been getting any dodgy attachments in the
last 2 days. Obviously I'm not in the address lists of anyone
with "Outlook". Yet anohter nail in the coffin for MS.
This should be rubbed in to all those who continue to
support MS software.
