On the subject of the word perfect, I tried two
different download versions, and they both gave
unreadable icons and were completely useless on
3 different linux computers.

Then I tried the back-of-the-book version of
word perfect, which was sort of readable, but the window was
too small. So I made the window bigger.
But the first time I used the slide bar, it crashed.

This was a reproducible error: resize window + move slide
bar =&gt; crash. So I had to discipline myself to not resize
the window. But then other things went wrong.

As I often say: 10 times bitten, 10 times shy.

So I went back to Star Office, which is garbage, but
at least it's consistent garbage (in the versions I got,
anyway), although the conversions to/from ms-word-anything
were always imperfect.

Unless Star Office gets better, I'll have to stick with
plain TeX (with text editor - ludwig) and ps2pdf, and just
suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous MS users who
complain that they can't select text from my PDF files.

If the next version of SO does fix up the incompatibility
problems, this will be a very welcome thing indeed.
But since I hate word processors anyway, the only value in
such things is _compatibility_ with the other 90% of
PC users. Why would anyone want to commit their creative
output to a proprietary format with versionitis?
My plain TeX documents of 1985 are still 100% compatible
with current plain TeX software.

It's time for my dinner now.
Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
