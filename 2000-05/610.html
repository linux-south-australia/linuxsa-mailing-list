Hi,

The InstallFest sounds like an excellent idea!  You can count me in for
support, help, co-ordinating, organising and all round enthusiasm.

As for identifying Linux Guru's... hats are a good idea, however I think
"InstallFest 2000" t-shirts would excellent.

What audience to you aim to attract to the fest?  What sort of people do
you want to cater for?  New users (never used Linux before), Novice users
(who want to know how to dial up to their ISP or configure their sound
card)?

I will look into getting some more CD's to give away for the event.  

Install fests are a lot of fun and a great way for newbies to learn. I am
looking forward to the event!

&gt; Hello fellow LinuxSAers...
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to suggest that we should have an InstallFest this year, say in
&gt; late August or September. I'm happy to do co-ordinate things as long as
&gt; there are plenty of people willing and able to commit themselves to help in
&gt; various ways. If someone else is interested in co-ordinating this, I'm happy
&gt; to let you, I just thought I'd get the ball rolling... I've spoken to both
&gt; Geoffery and Matthew, and they are keen, but don't have the time to commit
&gt; to it...
&gt; 
&gt; Also, anyone who has organised anything like this recently (..Sarah
&gt; Bolderoff?), if you are able to offer any help at all, it would be greatly
&gt; appreciated, particularly as I personally have no experience organising
&gt; anything like this at all...
&gt; 
&gt; Given the hype that Linux has had recently, we should be able to get a fair
&gt; few people along (more than 100, maybe even a few hundred...), so there will
&gt; be some serious organising to do. I've made a preliminary list of things we
&gt; need to think about, so if anyone has any input on these (or, even better,
&gt; offers of help), don't hesitate to speak up...
&gt; 
&gt; * A venue -- must be big enough to hold &gt; 100 computers
&gt; 	with parking for &gt; 100
&gt; 	preferably has a network connection available (the faster the
&gt; better, although a phone line to connect a modem to would suffice)
&gt; 	even better would be a switching infrastructure...
&gt; 	handy to have a place where we can have coffee, pizza, etc.
&gt; 	also a whiteboard or five wouldn't go astray...
&gt; 	preferably has &gt;100 desks and &gt;200 chairs, otherwise we need them
&gt; too.
&gt; 
&gt; * Switches/Hubs (10/100BaseT, preferably)
&gt; 
&gt; * large numbers of cat5 RJ-45 cables (thin co-ax could be useful too, but...
&gt; uughh...)
&gt; 
&gt; * Linux CDs -- a variety of distros, but probably mostly RedHat for
&gt; learners... maybe some others for people who like a bit of variety...
&gt; 
&gt; * A few working boxes, preferably set up as servers, from which to do NFS or
&gt; FTP installs, as well as demos of things...
&gt; 
&gt; * desks and chairs.
&gt; 
&gt; * Labels for people and items brought in...
&gt; 
&gt; * hats or something to identify people who know (methinks we should have 2
&gt; colours, to identify plain old Geeks, who can do most stuff, and god-like
&gt; Gurus, who can (probably/hopefully) fix the things that the Geeks get stuck
&gt; on.
&gt; 
&gt; * givaways and sponsors... I think we could coax a few IT companies (like
&gt; Compaq, IBM, SGI, maybe a couple of the local stores and wholesalers,
&gt; Camtech(?), a few ISPs, Cisco, Dymocks, O'Reilly, The Bookshelf, RedHat,
&gt; VALinux(?), everythingLinux, LinuxMall.com, NetCraft etc etc etc) into
&gt; giving us stuff to give away (door prizes, promotional Tshirts), stuff to
&gt; use (stuff on this list), and/or money (to et stuff on this list) in
&gt; exchange for a plug... we could even invite them to send people along to
&gt; learn and/or help and/or maybe sell stuff...
&gt; 
&gt; * PEOPLE -- we need people to do installs, to answer questions, to present
&gt; mini-presentations (What is Linux? What is the GPL? What's SAMBA? Why do I
&gt; want Linux?), to check people in at the door (make them sign something to
&gt; ensure they don't sue anyone if we lose their data, and make them label all
&gt; their stuff and themselves), to set up and clean up, to find people places
&gt; to put their computers, and so on. This is the _MOST_ important thing, so if
&gt; people commit to this early, we can go ahead with confidence...
&gt; 
&gt; * Pizza, coke and coffee.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, we mainly need people to get this to work. We can talk about it
&gt; for a short while, but then we have to stat doing something about it...
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any input, or can offer anything, please do...
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, I also thought that maybe we could aim to do a smaller event, but make
&gt; it a regular thing... perhaps bi-monthly... that makes it a smaller job, and
&gt; gives us an ongoing installfest habit... but it could be too much commitment
&gt; to do it 6 times a year... what do people think? Geoffery suggested we have
&gt; a variety of Fests -- ConfigFest, SecurityFest, MailFest, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, any input and discussion would be appreciated, as would ANY offers
&gt; of help, or an offer to organise it better than me :)
