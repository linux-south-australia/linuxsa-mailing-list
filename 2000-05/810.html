&gt;&gt; What do we install?
 
&gt; I can understand why you'd like to make this an "if it's open-source,
we'll
&gt; install it" event, but I don't think that's realistic.       
Installing multiple
&gt; distributions will increase the complexity of the situation by orders
of
&gt; magnitude.  It'd be much easier if we just install one.  RedHat is a
&gt; good one for beginners.	And although my experience with Debian is
not that
&gt; flash, I imagine that if you have to have someone install it for you
then you probably
&gt; shouldn't be using it.
 
I understand what you mean by that it will increase the complexity of the
event, and
by no means do I disagree with that. However, what has me interested in
this event
is the possibility of looking at other distributions and other
open-source OSes.  I can
intsall RedHat and while I am more than happy with it, I would like to
have the oppurtunity
to investigate the other distrubtitions available; preferably in an
environment where I 
can ask for help in I need it (unlike with my RedHat installation which
took 2 weeks to get
working properly).  

I agree that there should be a main distrubition, and RedHat appears to
be the best choice
at the current time. But I would like to have the option to be able to
install other distrubitions
and/or OSes. That could kind of be a, install at your own risk type of
thing... but the people
that do know how to install / configure / fix could help with specific
problems. Basically if you
are aiming at the linux newbie, they will install whatever you tell them
to install; be that RedHat.
The main people that are going to be interested in the other stuff, is
those that have
already got their feet wet so to speak and are looking around to see what
else is available. 

Well there is my .5c for the month :)
