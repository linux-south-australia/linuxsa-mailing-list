Hi...

&gt; Cheat sheets -- these are actually pretty important.. we need to be able to
&gt; give/sell people something to remind them of what to do. Sarah had some
&gt; sheets from Generation Linux, which we could use as a base (assuming that's
&gt; OK with you, Sarah). However, I think these were pretty specific to the
&gt; distro and (provided) PCs they were using at the venue there... we may need

Yes... it might be worth having some installation notes kicking around so that
the installees can follow what the installers are doing, and so that they can do
it again themselves if they have to.  But I think that a quick reference sheet
is more important - when they get home they'll be saying "how do I see a
directory listing again?"

&gt; What do we install?

I can understand why you'd like to make this an "if it's open-source, we'll
install it" event, but I don't think that's realistic.  Installing multiple
distributions will increase the complexity of the situation by orders of
magnitude.  It'd be much easier if we just install one.  RedHat is a good one
for beginners.  And although my experience with Debian is not that flash, I imagine
that if you have to have someone install it for you then you probably shouldn't
be using it.

&gt; Publicity -- slogans & Tshirts...

It coudl ;-) be a good idea if we have someone other than Richard writing the
press releases.
