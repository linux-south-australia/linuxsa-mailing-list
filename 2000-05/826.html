Hi...

&gt; I agree that there should be a main distrubition, and RedHat appears to
&gt; be the best choice
&gt; at the current time. But I would like to have the option to be able to
&gt; install other distrubitions
&gt; and/or OSes. That could kind of be a, install at your own risk type of
&gt; thing... but the people
&gt; that do know how to install / configure / fix could help with specific
&gt; problems. Basically if you
&gt; are aiming at the linux newbie, they will install whatever you tell them
&gt; to install; be that RedHat.
&gt; The main people that are going to be interested in the other stuff, is
&gt; those that have
&gt; already got their feet wet so to speak and are looking around to see what
&gt; else is available. 

Yes, this is a good idea.  For newbies we could provide a [insert distribution
of choice] installation with plenty of help.  For people who have already used a
distribution and want to try another we could provide a CD of that distribution,
a place to work with it, and help if they get stuck.  That will be much easier.

As for the mini-distros, that could be worthwhile too.  I once installed a mini
distro using UMSDOS when space wasn't available for a repartition.  This  may
be useful for newbies who just want to have a play, but it still adds to the
number of things that we have to worry about.  Any mini-distro gurus out there?
