Subject: InstallFest 2000


Hello fellow LinuxSAers...

I'd like to suggest that we should have an InstallFest this year, say in
late August or September. I'm happy to do co-ordinate things as long as
there are plenty of people willing and able to commit themselves to help in
various ways. If someone else is interested in co-ordinating this, I'm happy
to let you, I just thought I'd get the ball rolling... I've spoken to both
Geoffery and Matthew, and they are keen, but don't have the time to commit
to it...

Also, anyone who has organised anything like this recently (..Sarah
Bolderoff?), if you are able to offer any help at all, it would be greatly
appreciated, particularly as I personally have no experience organising
anything like this at all...

Given the hype that Linux has had recently, we should be able to get a fair
few people along (more than 100, maybe even a few hundred...), so there will
be some serious organising to do. I've made a preliminary list of things we
need to think about, so if anyone has any input on these (or, even better,
offers of help), don't hesitate to speak up...

* A venue -- must be big enough to hold &gt; 100 computers
	with parking for &gt; 100
	preferably has a network connection available (the faster the
better, although a phone line to connect a modem to would suffice)
	even better would be a switching infrastructure...
	handy to have a place where we can have coffee, pizza, etc.
	also a whiteboard or five wouldn't go astray...
	preferably has &gt;100 desks and &gt;200 chairs, otherwise we need them
too.

* Switches/Hubs (10/100BaseT, preferably)

* large numbers of cat5 RJ-45 cables (thin co-ax could be useful too, but...
uughh...)

* Linux CDs -- a variety of distros, but probably mostly RedHat for
learners... maybe some others for people who like a bit of variety...

* A few working boxes, preferably set up as servers, from which to do NFS or
FTP installs, as well as demos of things...

* desks and chairs.

* Labels for people and items brought in...

* hats or something to identify people who know (methinks we should have 2
colours, to identify plain old Geeks, who can do most stuff, and god-like
Gurus, who can (probably/hopefully) fix the things that the Geeks get stuck
on.

* givaways and sponsors... I think we could coax a few IT companies (like
Compaq, IBM, SGI, maybe a couple of the local stores and wholesalers,
Camtech(?), a few ISPs, Cisco, Dymocks, O'Reilly, The Bookshelf, RedHat,
VALinux(?), everythingLinux, LinuxMall.com, NetCraft etc etc etc) into
giving us stuff to give away (door prizes, promotional Tshirts), stuff to
use (stuff on this list), and/or money (to et stuff on this list) in
exchange for a plug... we could even invite them to send people along to
learn and/or help and/or maybe sell stuff...

* PEOPLE -- we need people to do installs, to answer questions, to present
mini-presentations (What is Linux? What is the GPL? What's SAMBA? Why do I
want Linux?), to check people in at the door (make them sign something to
ensure they don't sue anyone if we lose their data, and make them label all
their stuff and themselves), to set up and clean up, to find people places
to put their computers, and so on. This is the _MOST_ important thing, so if
people commit to this early, we can go ahead with confidence...

* Pizza, coke and coffee.

Remember, we mainly need people to get this to work. We can talk about it
for a short while, but then we have to stat doing something about it...

If anyone has any input, or can offer anything, please do...

Oh, I also thought that maybe we could aim to do a smaller event, but make
it a regular thing... perhaps bi-monthly... that makes it a smaller job, and
gives us an ongoing installfest habit... but it could be too much commitment
to do it 6 times a year... what do people think? Geoffery suggested we have
a variety of Fests -- ConfigFest, SecurityFest, MailFest, etc...

Anyway, any input and discussion would be appreciated, as would ANY offers
of help, or an offer to organise it better than me :)
