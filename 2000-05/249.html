In regards to SAMBA this sounds like you need the fix to make windows send
the password in plain text. There is a doco (somewhere around /usr/doc)
which will detail the change to be made to the windows box, otherwise there
is a link to goto to get the .reg file which does this as well.

<A HREF="http://us1.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/textdocs/Win95.txt">http://us1.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/textdocs/Win95.txt</A> This link is about
Win95 but may help.

Subject: ZIP Drive


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you to those who responded for my cry of help in
&gt; setting up my PPP and figuring out WINE. The result... I
&gt; changed my crappy old KTX ext 336 modem for a Auslinx
&gt; redback336E and it now works fine. As for the proxies in
&gt; netscape, once connected to the ISP, the proxies was
&gt; automatically setup by the connection (?).
&gt;
&gt; As for WINE, I got quark xpress to run, photoshop and the
&gt; other pre-press apps I used, but I'm not impressed with the
&gt; way the handle, I'm going to try VMware soon, see how that
&gt; goes.
&gt;
&gt; OK... After countless nights upto 2am, I have learned a
&gt; heck of alot about Linux, but after reading through all the
&gt; books I've got, reading the how-to's and man's, I can not
&gt; figure out how to access my internal IDE ZIP drive. All the
&gt; books/man's refer to a parallel or SCSI external drive. Has
&gt; anyone configured an internal IDE ZIP? if so, could you be
&gt; kind enough to let me know how you did it.
&gt;
&gt; One other thing, I've been playing around with samba, to
&gt; try and hook up the other win98 machines on my LAN. It all
&gt; seems to work, except when the PC's go to log in as their
&gt; respective user name and password, a message comes up
&gt; saying invalid password. I've played around with the
&gt; smbpasswd file (putting NO PASSWORD and changing the
&gt; passwords within the file). I just can't seem to get my
&gt; head around this one, can anyone suggest anything?
&gt;
&gt; I am using Caldera OpenLinux 2.3, the eth0 is all setup and
&gt; the linux box can read the win98's C-drive, and the Win98's
&gt; can see the linux and the user folder, public folder and
&gt; the printer attached to the linux box.
&gt;
&gt; If anyone can help out with the ZIP prob or with sorting
&gt; out the password probs, it'll be greatly appreciated... I
&gt; look forward to going to bed at a reasonable hour some
&gt; night soon!!
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Carl
