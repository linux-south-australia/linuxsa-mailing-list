For those who don't read the on-line NY Times, you might be
interested in this little item:

<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-microsoft-fu.html">http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-microsoft-fu.html</A>

if you have registered with them.
If you haven't registered with this worthy news source,
here's an interesting bit:

-----------------------------------------------------------
``This (breakup proposal) is probably almost the best-case
scenario for Microsoft. It could be a lot worse than this and
if they continue to fight the break-up it is likely to get a lot
worse,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with technology
research firm Giga Information Group. 

Kusnetzky added that Microsoft might do well by its
investors if it started to beef up its product line to include
software that runs on rival operating systems such as Linux,
or on machines with non-Intel Corp. (INTC.O)
microchips. 

``If they believe that they're going to win the good fight,
they'll go doing what they want to do. If they are prudent,
they'll start developing for other platforms just to make
sure that if they are broken up, they can hit the ground
running,'' Kusnetzky said. 

``You should dig the well before you're thirsty,'' he said. 
----------------------------------------------------------

Yep, I know this has been said for some time, but now the
mainstream are recognizing that MS should bring out
Office for linux.
This, in my opinion, will be the absolute worst-case
scenario for those who live and breath the linux life-style.
I reckon a lot of coders will turn off their computer
(no matter what `uptime` says) and take up another hobby,
like cooking or crochet.
Then people who cheered the Halloween leaks and the
Windows refund will be wishing they could turn the clock
back to the happier days when the suit-less talented
hobbyists ruled.
Someone should register the name "Linux Office 2000" before some
monopoly or other announces it!

==========================================================
Question:
Does anyone happen to know how to work out in Perl/Tk
what the right size is for the initial window when
starting an application?
In KDE, it's kind of tricky knowing just where the window-manager
bars are going to be so that I know how much room is left
for my window, which I want to be as big as possible.
An algorithm that works for fvwm2, gnome etc. too would be best.
Someone must have worked this out.
It's so much easier under SunOS4.1.3.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
