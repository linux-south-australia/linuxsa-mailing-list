<PRE>
Package management is one of the most importan things about an OS, when 
considering its use in commercial and/or large environments. I have
some ideas I've formed through practical experience over where things
are, and I'd be interested in other peoples' comments on what I'm
forgetting.

There are quite a few free software package management tools around. In
Linux there are I think five at the moment, with the big two being the apt
system and rpm, Slakware having a bare-bone .tar.gz system and the other
two being pretty much insignificant. In BSD there's the pkg system. I'm
only going to consider rpm, app and pkg here.

I think there are two parts to a package management system, firstly the
quality of the tools and secondly the quality of the packages that are
available. 

Something that is clearly not good is having perhaps 10 different package
specifications for things like GNU fileutils, which are required by all
Linux and BSD distributions. That's 10 different pre-install/post-install
scripts, 10 different approaches to permissions and file locations and 10
different index entries and so on. And then these specification files are
used by maybe 50 or more Linux and BSD distributions! Diversity is good
(and different ideas about packaging for security and other reasons quite
justifiable) but for a basic package whose contents everyone understands
this is just silly. Fortunately www.freestandards.org and the BSD projects
have clear standards for where files should go. But long-term this is a
bad approach for free software.

rpm
---

The first Linux packaging system of any consequence, and a significant
advance on any commercial packaging tool including the Windows
Installshield approach (which was not invented by Microsoft.) Originally
developed by Red Hat employees, then taken on by quite a lot of other
distributions (some of which are not based on the Red Hat distribution at
all, such as SuSE.) 

As far as I can tell all development work on rpm stopped 18 months or more
ago.

Features of RPM:

    - a fairly comprehensive database system. You can ask questions like
      "which package owns this file" or construct queries to check what
      files exist that aren't in the database
    - a library (rpmlib) for manipulating the database from programs
    - many tools exist which use rpmlib, some of them very pretty ones
    - the canonical commandline tool is "rpm", which of course was
      developed as part of the base rpm system
    - none of the tools are very strong on dependency chains, neither
      is rpmlib
    - reasonable but out-of-date documentation, including a book 
      "Maximum RPM"
    - ported to quite a lot of operating systems, including Solaris and
      Irix

The net effect for me is that when administering a system via the
commandline "rpm" there are continual frustrations caused by chains of
dependencies. There just isn't the intelligence to do what I clearly want
to do (install package X plus whatever else it needs, being consulted if
there are any clashes.)

rpm has a huge number of switches. This indicates a lack of design
thought.

There isn't any open developement process in place for managing future
development of rpm.

rpmfind.net has a huge collection of binary and source rpms from:

   1) Every (or many) rpm-based Linux distributions
   2) Individual package contributors, ie people who repackage 
      freely available software and put it up on rpmfind.net

So the user is faced with the choice of 57 different rpm binaries, most
(but not all) of which have a source rpm package as well. Which is a good
one? Which has got really insecure, or distribution-dependent, or just
plain un-peer-reviewed pre and post-install scripts? Remember that rpm
must be run as root.

apt
---

Or, "A Packaging Tool".

apt consists of a back-end dpkg system that is very modular, with library
interfaces and arbitrary methods for doing just about anything. There are
several front-ends to this, including a user-unfriendly tool called
dselect, a very impressive commandline tool called apt-get, a bare-bones
tool called dpkg (ie it provides just about raw access to the dpkg
libraries) and numerous other tools including apt_console.

I suspect the apt designers knew about BSD's pkg.

There is less database-like functionality compared to rpm (and currently
only one user can have the database open at a time!). I haven't heard of
apt being ported to any non-Linux platform. At a developer level the
documentation is very good, but there aren't any user-level books or other
ancillary documents that I know of.

The big thing about apt is dependencies. It very rare to come across a
situtation that it can't resolve. This feature is exposed very nicely by
the apt-get commandline tool (which doesn't have very many switches at
all!) which allows a command such as "apt-get install xyz" to install xyz
from either ftp, http, cdrom or other source media depending on which is
most up to date and which has been configured in the global configuration
file, including all dependencies without even asking except in case of
disasters if that's what you want.

The other thing about the apt system is that there is an extremely well
thought-out design for structuring archives and specifying installation
sources, so that even if you don't use Debian you can still use packages
from the Debian package collection where that makes sense. There are
very clear guidelines for how .deb package should be put together, and
since there is some centralisation of the core packages there can be peer
review of things like install scripts.

pkg
---

I know the least about this. It is a very simple system, with a basic list
of installed packages in /var/db/pkg and commands like pkg_add and
pkg_delete which handle a package description file that is bundled with
a tar.gz of the binaries to be installed.

Not ported to any other OS that I know of. There is good documentation,
although being so simple not a lot is needed. A good thing about pkg is
that the collections of ports are maintained in a consistent way and there
aren't that many ports collections. The rules for making a package a very
clear.

Overall
-------

I think the big issue is maintaining the package archives. The apt and pkg
approach is pretty good, with apt being quite an advance on the ports
collection concept in that it is designed to be easily extended and an
arbitary number of repositories and
