&gt; My question: is simply changing the file enough to enact the changes,

It depends how your system is set up, but normally exim runs as a daemon.
This means that it needs to be told to reread the configuration file.
Running a script like you describe should do the trick (from the directory
I'd guess you're running a Debian or Debian-derived system) but all it
will be doing is a:

   killall -HUP exim 

or similar.

Be careful! If you have an error in your config file Exim may not be
running at all! So immediately after doing this, do

   telnet localhost 25

and type "QUIT" if you get a succesful connection. If you get "connection
refused" then Exim didn't restart. Regardless of the result of the
previous test, have a look at the error logs:

   tail /var/log/exim/mainlog
   tail /var/log/exim/paniclog   

which should have helpful messages in them.

&gt; I am guessing the answer is the latter, but I'm a little unsure about
&gt; things.  Does exim run as a daemon, or is it periodically executed or
&gt; what?

There's two parts to it: what happens when there's an incoming request on
port 25 (the SMTP port) and how locally queued mail is delivered. Starting
exim with a commandline something like:

    exim -bd -q10m 

says "make Exim run as a background daemon and check the queue every 10
minutes, attempting a delivery of every queued message that has reached
its delivery retry time."

Your /etc/init.d/exim script will have a line something like this in it.

You can see from the docs what the story is about running Exim from inetd,
ie starting it up every time there's an incoming connection to port 25.
