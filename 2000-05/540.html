*sticks up hand*

I'll be in.

Well - I would be in..  but I'm living in Broken Hill :(  But I'll try
to be of assistance?

Maybe I should do one here ;)

Anyone else on the list near Broken Hill?

Wait - that's not possible, NOWHERE is near Broken Hill.

Anyone else on the list *in* Broken Hill who would like to think about
a BH-InstallFest-2k?

Maybe we could invite surrounding outbacky-type towns ... ?

We could do one in Wilcania!

&gt; Hello fellow LinuxSAers...
&gt;
&gt; I'd like to suggest that we should have an InstallFest this year, say in
&gt; late August or September. I'm happy to do co-ordinate things as long as
&gt; there are plenty of people willing and able to commit themselves
&gt; to help in
&gt; various ways. If someone else is interested in co-ordinating
&gt; this, I'm happy
&gt; to let you, I just thought I'd get the ball rolling... I've spoken to both
&gt; Geoffery and Matthew, and they are keen, but don't have the time to commit
&gt; to it...
&gt;
&gt; Also, anyone who has organised anything like this recently (..Sarah
&gt; Bolderoff?), if you are able to offer any help at all, it would be greatly
&gt; appreciated, particularly as I personally have no experience organising
&gt; anything like this at all...
&gt;
&gt; Given the hype that Linux has had recently, we should be able to
&gt; get a fair
&gt; few people along (more than 100, maybe even a few hundred...), so
&gt; there will
&gt; be some serious organising to do. I've made a preliminary list of
&gt; things we
&gt; need to think about, so if anyone has any input on these (or, even better,
&gt; offers of help), don't hesitate to speak up...
&gt;
&gt; * A venue -- must be big enough to hold &gt; 100 computers
&gt; 	with parking for &gt; 100
&gt; 	preferably has a network connection available (the faster the
&gt; better, although a phone line to connect a modem to would suffice)
&gt; 	even better would be a switching infrastructure...
&gt; 	handy to have a place where we can have coffee, pizza, etc.
&gt; 	also a whiteboard or five wouldn't go astray...
&gt; 	preferably has &gt;100 desks and &gt;200 chairs, otherwise we need them
&gt; too.
&gt;
&gt; * Switches/Hubs (10/100BaseT, preferably)
&gt;
&gt; * large numbers of cat5 RJ-45 cables (thin co-ax could be useful
&gt; too, but...
&gt; uughh...)
&gt;
&gt; * Linux CDs -- a variety of distros, but probably mostly RedHat for
&gt; learners... maybe some others for people who like a bit of variety...
&gt;
&gt; * A few working boxes, preferably set up as servers, from which
&gt; to do NFS or
&gt; FTP installs, as well as demos of things...
&gt;
&gt; * desks and chairs.
&gt;
&gt; * Labels for people and items brought in...
&gt;
&gt; * hats or something to identify people who know (methinks we should have 2
&gt; colours, to identify plain old Geeks, who can do most stuff, and god-like
&gt; Gurus, who can (probably/hopefully) fix the things that the Geeks
&gt; get stuck
&gt; on.
&gt;
&gt; * givaways and sponsors... I think we could coax a few IT companies (like
&gt; Compaq, IBM, SGI, maybe a couple of the local stores and wholesalers,
&gt; Camtech(?), a few ISPs, Cisco, Dymocks, O'Reilly, The Bookshelf, RedHat,
&gt; VALinux(?), everythingLinux, LinuxMall.com, NetCraft etc etc etc) into
&gt; giving us stuff to give away (door prizes, promotional Tshirts), stuff to
&gt; use (stuff on this list), and/or money (to et stuff on this list) in
&gt; exchange for a plug... we could even invite them to send people along to
&gt; learn and/or help and/or maybe sell stuff...
&gt;
&gt; * PEOPLE -- we need people to do installs, to answer questions, to present
&gt; mini-presentations (What is Linux? What is the GPL? What's SAMBA? Why do I
&gt; want Linux?), to check people in at the door (make them sign something to
&gt; ensure they don't sue anyone if we lose their data, and make them
&gt; label all
&gt; their stuff and themselves), to set up and clean up, to find people places
&gt; to put their computers, and so on. This is the _MOST_ important
&gt; thing, so if
&gt; people commit to this early, we can go ahead with confidence...
&gt;
&gt; * Pizza, coke and coffee.
&gt;
&gt; Remember, we mainly need people to get this to work. We can talk about it
&gt; for a short while, but then we have to stat doing something about it...
&gt;
&gt; If anyone has any input, or can offer anything, please do...
&gt;
&gt; Oh, I also thought that maybe we could aim to do a smaller event, but make
&gt; it a regular thing... perhaps bi-monthly... that makes it a
&gt; smaller job, and
&gt; gives us an ongoing installfest habit... but it could be too much
&gt; commitment
&gt; to do it 6 times a year... what do people think? Geoffery
&gt; suggested we have
&gt; a variety of Fests -- ConfigFest, SecurityFest, MailFest, etc...
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, any input and discussion would be appreciated, as would ANY offers
&gt; of help, or an offer to organise it better than me :)
