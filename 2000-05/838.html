Hi Kym
Try running "XF86Setup" which will give you a graphical configuration
option, or "Xconfigurator" which will give you an ncurses-based
configuration (the command line version of a GUI :-)
Occasionally XF86Setup will not start due to your video not being
detected properly or something, but I have had few probs with it.
(By the way, i guess you've tried the monitor on another PC or under
Windows (dont try that at home though! ;-) to make sure the monitor is
not at fault?)
Good luck

&gt; Hi! Ive been trying to install RH6.2 after getting tired of having to
&gt; rewire libraries in CorelLinux and now have a flickering monitor. I
&gt; can see the screen, which starts at a high res, looks like at least
&gt; 1280x1024, but the flicker's going fritz my brain. :-) During the
&gt; install, which runs beautifully (and I might add kicks Corels user
&gt; friendly) Redhat finds my monitor as a DDC, which it is, but hashes
&gt; the scan freqs. Seems to flip the horizontal and the vertical, and
&gt; when I manually change the rates as given in my monitors manual, I
&gt; still get the flicker. Ive tried all kinds different freqs. Im
&gt; thinking its either 1) the monitors preset timing, or 2) the DDC (plug
&gt; and play) that Red Hat matchs to the monitor is a tad off. Is there
&gt; some way I can fix this while still running RedHat rather than doing
&gt; continuous installs? I looked for a display properties in RedHat but
&gt; found nothing. Is XF86config a good place to start?Any and all help is
&gt; as always REALLY appreciated.Kym
