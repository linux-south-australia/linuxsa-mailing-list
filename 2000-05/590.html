Hi,

People seemed interested in my impressions so here they are after 3 builds
on three diferent machines.

Well, the make xconfig went fine. It wasn't obvious in one situation with
a surecom ethernet card (reltek chipset) that I needed exprerimental
drivers, but I soon worked that out, and I'm sure if I'd dome a more
extensive read of the documentation probably would have shown that up.

I find that the RedHat kernels come with more drivers than the
"standard" kernel. For instance 2.2.14 that comes with the ppa module for
parallel port zip drives. Also sndconfig detected a soundblaster live card
as some type or other, but there was no sign of these modules in the
2.2.15 source. now the drivers never worked anyway, but I thought this was
just a matter of config to solve at somestage.

I've had it fail once. This was a patch of a successful 2.2.14 kernel
(actually its been a 2.2.12,13,14 beforehand all successful builds). The
patch and the make menuconfig worked fine, but the make dep failled. I
seem to recall a make XXX where XXX was an upgrade option that removed old
options and added new. I can't remember what this was, and a quick glance
through the kernel HOWTO (where I thought I found this command in the
past) shows no sign. There is another HOWTO which also tells you how to
build a kernel, but I can't remember which one this is.

Otherwise a quite satisfactory kernel.

cya
