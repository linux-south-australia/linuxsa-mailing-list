Don't forget to fax your media release to some of the Network stations, such as
Channel 7.  But remember they have to believe its an interesting event,
perhaphs highlight the spirit of the linux project, make it truely an event,
I'd dare say even commit a 'stunt' in order to get their attention. Most
journalists are only interested in computer stories if it involves hacking,
viruses, and gadjets. Perhaps something along these lines? (just to draw to the
event itself). I dare say stage events, the media loves a show, and they love
good visuals.

And try to have it on a weekend! If you do it during the week you will just get
pushed aside by more 'topical' news items. Usually journalists are much more
likely to do stories they would normally consider "boring".

I'm not a journalist but i do work in the industry, these are just some
suggestions :)

Get Micheal Harbison nvolved, I'm sure he'd be supportive, and hes *very* good
at working the media :)

&gt; I'm in the middle of a discussion with Richard about venues and dates,
&gt; ther being an opportunity for the former which more or less determines
&gt; the latter, and I expect we'll have a date by tomorrow or Friday at
&gt; latest.  Can we please hold off answering Michael until then?  (That
&gt; looks better than saying that we haven't decided yet.)
