* 2. Is it possible to set up a Linux webserver machine to respond
* to multiple
* IP addresses, eg. I have a telstra connection which uses an IP like this
* 139.130.138.123 (has been altered) this ip address is for the
* computer which
* is connected to telstra. I also have several other IP addresses which I
* intend to use for the webserver and mail eg 203.38.200.123 and
* 203.38.200.124 for www and mail respectively now what I would
* like to know
* is whether I can set up a linux machine to cater for all three of
* these ip
* addresses ?

Yeah, baby! Big time. You can set up linux to do anything and everything! ;)
Best yet, for a straightforward internet gateway, linux is relatively
painless to configure. All necessary packages come on the disk, and there
isn't much to it to set things up.

* 3. I want to be able to set up the following on a single computer:
* Website,POP3,Firewall,IP Masquerading,Gateway is this possible on
* a single
* computer. If so what FREE linux programs should I use, I have already
* decided to use APACHE for the webserver, and from what I have
* read SENDMAIL
* is a good email server, and IPMASQ is good for NAT.

Apache, Sendmail, ipchains. They're all able to be preloaded on install.
Sendmail keeps having security holes discovered in it, but it's probably a
great option while you're still on the steep part of your learning curve,
since it's mostly configured for you initially.
