&gt; Why evil?
&gt; 

because they irritate me. If anyone sends me mail and wants a receipt, my
mail client asks me, and I say no. I will usually reply to anything that
looks like it needs a response. Of course, they still get server receipts if
they wanted them, but...

OK, they're not that evil, i just don't like them. What really irks me is
vacation messages sent to mailing lists... I'd like to know if people can
have vacation messages on, but not send them to mailing lists, or to people
who poast ot mailing lists... If I sned a message to a mailing list, I don't
care if Joe Random who subscribed last week is out of his office... as well
as this, it destroys that user's anonymity, if they wanted to keep it...

rr

&gt; The reason I am interested in them is that I am having problems with
&gt; email reliability.  There have been email messages I have sent, which
&gt; have not reached their destination (and no message back saying "could
&gt; not deliver").  There have also been email messages which have not
&gt; reached me.  It seems to only happen occasionally, but it would be
&gt; nice to know when it happens, especially for important messages.
&gt; Email receipts would seem to be the answer.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Mark.
