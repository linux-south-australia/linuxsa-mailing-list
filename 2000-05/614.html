&gt;  &gt; Most of the time it's OK to buffer writes on a file system, however for
&gt;  &gt; a floppy it can become a little disjointed. Specifically I use mount -t
&gt;  &gt; vfat /dev/fd0 /mnt/b and use the usual unix file tools to copy stuff to
&gt;  &gt; it (eg cp, mv etc). However, when I write stuff to the disk, it doesn't
&gt;  &gt; actually write immediately and I have to umount the disk...
&gt; 
&gt; What's the problem with this?  It'll write the data to disk when you
&gt; request to have it unmounted.

The problems are:

 - buffering data destined to floppy disk for long periods of
   time is a bit pointless.  Although it's a block device the
   usage of floppy disks are such that people are unlikely
   to read any data they have just written.  This makes caching
   that data for long periods a loss -- you could be caching
   something else that has a higher probability of being read.

 - the user interface is poor.  People write the data to floppy
   and nothing happens, then when they want to remove the floppy
   they have to wait 30s.  It would be better to write the data
   when the user wasn't waiting.

Insisting on synchronous writes isn't the answer either.  Because
floppies are slow you do want to buffer the data long enough to
get complete tracks and to give the block sorting routines enough
blocks to minimise head movement.

The answer probably lies in altering the way the kernel allocates
and flushes disk blocks to treat some cached disks blocks as having
a lower usefulness than others.  This would also advantage other
slow removable file systems such as flash memory.
