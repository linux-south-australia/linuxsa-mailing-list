No, they aren't.  I think what's more likely is that you are attempting
to read character-by-character from an input source which is line-buffered
(ttys are line-buffered by default, sockets/pipes aren't).

You need to put the tty into raw or cbreak mode to do what you want to
do.  To do that, use ioctl() to disable the termios ICANON c_lflag:

     struct termios t;

     if (ioctl(ttyfd, TIOCGETA, &t) == -1) {
	 /* error processing - can't get struct termios */
     }

     t.c_lflag ~= ICANON;

     if (ioctl(ttyfd, TIOCSETA, &t) == -1) {
	 /* error processing: can't set struct termios */
     }

Following the above, the file descriptor addressed as "ttyfd" should be
character-buffered (assuming it's a tty device -- You'll probably get
the ioctl() calls failing with EINVAL or ENOTSUPP if it isn't).

You'll probably also want to turn off echo (otherwise you'll confuse
modems by echoing their "OK", "CONNECT" and "ERROR" responses back at
them);  change the t.c_flag line above to the following to accomplish
that at the same time:

     t.c_lflag ~= (ICANON | ECHO);

As a final alternative, termios(7) provides a cfsetraw() function
which does all the things necessary to set a tty into "raw" mode:  To
use it, replace the t.c_lflag line with:

     cfmakeraw(&t);

cfmakeraw() alters a termios structure so that all values which affect
input and output processing are stripped out;  applications will simply
see a raw data stream.  That isn't always what you want, though:  Often
when talking to modems you actually *want* some output processing, such
as the bits which cause outgoing LF's into CR/LF's.  I'm not sure if
cfmakeraw() is really what you're going to want.

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
