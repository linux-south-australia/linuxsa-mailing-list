Hi...

&gt; I've been assuming that InstallFest would attract about 50 people, but it
&gt; seems this is way too conservative.  Everybody who I talk to has said that
&gt; we should be expecting hundreds of people.

The number of people that we get will be (in some way) proportional to the
amount of advertising we do, and the amount of media coverage that we get.  We
can probably shape this to some extent.

Will we get hundreds of people?  I don't know.  Remember what we're asking
people to do:
- Unplug your computer and peripherals and bring them in
- Sign waiver saying that we can blow up your computer and peripherals
- Assume that we'll delete Windows.

Are there hundreds of people in Adelaide that are willing to do this?

Do we want to make this an InstallExpo?

Do we need catering, or will we just call Pizza Hut when someone feels hungry?

I was going to e-mail Sun Microsystems and see if they wanted to bring along
some machines, StarOffice CDs, etc.  But then I started thinking about what I
was going to say to make them interested in coming.

Before we look too deeply into the logistics we should try and get a better idea
of how big this thing really will be.  How much do we want to push it?  Are we
going to go for a nation-wide InstallFest day that gets coverage on the news?
Or are we going to put up some posters, put an add in the paper, and see who
turns up?  Either way I'm in.

But when I e-mail Sun do I say:
- Come along with some products and giveaways and get a booth and exposure to
  hundreds of potential customers or
- Come along with an Ultra 5 and a couple of StarOffice CDs and meet some guys
  who are going to install Linux on some machines?

Only when these questions have been answered can we start looking for larger
contributions.

I agree that no matter what size the event ends up being, we certainly need
insurance.

I welcome comments on the t-shirt design that I threw together.  If I get some
good suggestions I might submit another one.

And I still think we should shift this thread off to another list.  ;-)
