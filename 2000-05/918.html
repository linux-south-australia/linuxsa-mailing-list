&gt; Just as an aside.... I dont know how many of you have looked at or installed
&gt; Corels Linux ( I dont like to diss, Corel have tried to make a User , read
&gt; Microsoft, friendly package and succeeded in parts), but the way in which
&gt; the libraries are situated and linked throughout the filesystem doesnt seem
&gt; to match what most applications are looking for, PLUS it doesnt allow for
&gt; upgrading of libraries when I tried to fix the problem (because the library
&gt; placement is hashed). Add this to the KDE debian binaries installer, thats
&gt; supposed to make it all that much easier (and which cant find the libs to
&gt; link to!), and your left with an 'almost' useless system on which its
&gt; 'almost' impossible to install anything but the simplest apps on......In the
&gt; last 1/2 hour since I fixed the res problem RedHat has allowed me to install
&gt; all the apps Ive tried with NO grief...nada...zip. Speaks for itself really
&gt; :-)

A little while ago (just after Corel 1.0 came out) I was stuck in a
situation where I had to install a server quickly and I only had a RH CD,
and a brand new Corel CD. I didn't want to install RH since rpms aren't so
easy to handle in a server situation unless you spend time tuning the
install environment (I'm not saying bad things about RH here, just that
rpm isn't state-of-the-art wrt network updates.) Since I knew that Corel
was based on Debian, I installed it, and then immediately removed the
Corel-specific fancy boot-time stuff.

Then I installed networking and used apt-get to upgrade the entire system.
No library problems, no errors of any sort. It's been working perfectly
for many months now. apt-get is very good at managing dependencies.

I think the difference is that you tried to use the fancy graphical
package mangement tools.
