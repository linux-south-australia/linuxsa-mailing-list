*** This thread will be moving off this list shortly -- just waiting for a
new list to be set up... ***

&gt; I've been assuming that InstallFest would attract about 50 people, but it
&gt; seems this is way too conservative.  Everybody who I talk to has said that
&gt; we should be expecting hundreds of people.

As Phil said -- it depends how we advertise. I wouldn't be surprised to see
over 100, maybe 200...

&gt; We need to work through the logistics.

yes...

&gt; GOAL
&gt; What are we doing?  We are running a one or two day event to which people
&gt; can bring their computers for us to install Linux, Star Office, PPP and
&gt; some games.  Our audience is home and small business.  We're not aiming to
&gt; teach MIS managers how to configure and administer AppleShare on Linux.

well, it actually includes MIS managers, but not in the MIS context :) Also
remember that it would be likely to include developers and "computer people"
from large organisations who are interested in using Linux on the desktop at
work (some people do have the luxury of choice)... Obviously we would be
installing stuff on their home machines, not their work machines, but still,
our audience includes people who will advocate and use Linux at work.

&gt; ADVERTISING
&gt; We can place posters in bookshops and computer stores.  I suspect we will
&gt; be able to get free publicity in The Advertiser, and maybe from a radio
&gt; station.  We should keep our message simple, but we must make it clear
that
&gt; in order to install Linux we will probably have to remove Windows (to make
&gt; space.)

Hmmm.... How many people actually removed Windows before installing Linux
the first time? I'd be guessing not many. I'd really like to get a few
copies of partition magic that we could share around (ensuring that we never
install on more machines than we have licences for somehow) so we could help
people partition -- remember, this is one of the hardest parts of a normal
install, and it's also one of the most neccesary, assuming people want to
keep their old OS. I'd really really really like it if we could generally
aim not to blow away anything on people's hard drive (but still have them
sign something so that if we do, we don't get sued)

&gt; LEGAL & SECURITY
&gt; Before we touch any computer we need a signed waiver, absolving us from
any
&gt; damages.  We ARE going to delete Windows...  We will also need security at
&gt; the venue, to make sure that all equipment brought in and out is properly
&gt; accounted for.

waiver, yes... this is serious... see <A HREF="http://www.vlug.org/ifht/waiver.html">http://www.vlug.org/ifht/waiver.html</A>
for an eg... could someone look at it and comment from an Australian legal
perspective? As for security -- I don't know if we need to worry _too_ much
about it... yes, it needs some thought, and we need to account for
everything anyone brings in and out, but this should be done by us (I'm not
sure if you are suggesting we need professionals to guard computer
hardware -- I don't think we do, but we do need to think about it from a
logistics point of veiw...)

&gt; We also need insurance.  You never know what might happen, or who might
try
&gt; to sue, so this is a wise precaution.  Being a loose group of enthusiasts,
&gt; with no official structure, no management committee, no paid up members,
&gt; and no articles of association, we don't legally exist.  If somebody were
&gt; sued it would be the volunteers at the event, or our insurers.  Although
&gt; insurance will be a big expense it will be necessary.

hmmm... Yes, but how do we arrange insurance for a body that doesn't exist?
I really don't know anything at all aobut insurance... I would think that if
we ensure that everyone has indemnified us, we should be OK... but then
again, with the way the world is today... maybe someone could offer to
enquire about insurance from somewhere who would insure events like this?

&gt; NETWORK
&gt; We've had a number of generous offers of free internet connection,
&gt; including one for multi-100mbps.  We haven't yet accepted any of these
&gt; offers, and indeed I'm not sure how to choose.  I know who made the first
&gt; offer, and I know who made the best one.  Should we accept offer number 1?
&gt; Should we accept the offer with of the biggest bandwidth?  Maybe the one
&gt; from the cutest operator? :-)
&gt;
&gt; I don't think we are in a position to accept an offer for 100's Mbps.  How
&gt; we would take advantage of it?  We'd also need to borrow OnRamp, or
&gt; microwave, or something like that, and I don't think that we could get
that
&gt; laid on for free for just one or two days.  We'll need the venue to have a
&gt; number of telephone lines, so a couple of MPPP connected modems or three
is
&gt; realistic.

well, the offers that I am aware of are venue-specific (ie, if you choose
venue A, we can give you 10Mbps, if you choose venue B, B, they will give
you 2Mbps, etc etc). Hence, we wouldn't _need_ modems at all...

Obviously, we won't really be needing heaps of bandwidth.. really, all we
want is to be able to find (and demostrate) documentation to people, maybe
look up some HOWTOs on unusual problems with video cards,etc, and download a
few extra packages here and there... However, an advantage to having lots of
bandwidth is that it looks and sounds good, provides a way for a local ISP
to show their support for Linux, and so on...

As for phone lines, I think we could really do with a few of them to help
people set up and test their modems for their own internet connection...
Maybe if we could get four (or more), and group them together in a corner so
that people who want to set up modems can go down that end to use the phone
lines...

&gt; BOOTHS
&gt; We will have costs for this event, and there will be businesses wanting to
&gt; hawk their wares.  We should make a limited number of booths available,
for
&gt; a fee, to book shops, computer retailers, ISPs, consultants, etc.  This is
&gt; our best opportunity to cover costs.

yes... I'd like to see some businesses there. However, we need to be careful
not to make this into a conference or trade expo... Maybe we need to figure
out our costs accurately first, and then try to find businesses to fill the
gaps (eg Hall hire sponsored by Dymocks, etc) As for selling booths, I'd
rather see more of a community atmosphere than a trade show... :)

&gt; VENUE
&gt; How many people will be at the venue at any time?  How long will each
&gt; visitor stay?  We're going to need bench space for computers, and we'll
&gt; need power, and I think we'll need a number of telephone lines.  I now
&gt; think we should plan for a peak of 50 concurrent attendees.  We'll need 20
&gt; helpers, so that's a hall with benchspace and power for 50+ computers.
&gt; This sounds large.  Assuming our internet comes in via telephone, let's
say
&gt; two lines.  In addition we should have at least one so that people can
test
&gt; their dial-up connection, but these are minimums.  Let's try to find a
&gt; venue that can supply three telephone lines plus whatever we need for our
&gt; event internet (say five or six lines in total.)

yes, 50 concurrently would probably be enough (although we'll know much
better closer to the date -- but that will be too late to make major changes
anyway). I think most of these halls should handle that... It may be
squeezy, but then, that will add to the atmosphere... :)


&gt; STAFF
&gt; We'll need volunteers to install Linux, to help with security, to
&gt; evangelise, and an event co-ordinator.  We probably cannot have too many
&gt; installers, after all if we do have too many they can always stand around
&gt; talking about their favourite operating system, but if we have too few
then
&gt; the event will be a failure.  Maybe fifteen installers?  We should have at
&gt; least two people on security, and I'd prefer more.  Let's figure on twenty
&gt; people.

yes, we need as many installers and general lackeys as possible. We could do
with two or three on the "Start Desk" (I'm visualising a desk with a big
Win95 start button banner with the win logo crossed out or something :),
maybe put these people on a rotating roster. Mainly we need descriptions of
what to do and how to do it for the people, and plenty of willing volunteers
(which I think we have, and will continue to get). I have put my had up as
event co-ordinator, but if someone else wants to do it, and feels more
qualified than me (I am completely unqualified in terms of experience doing
this kind of thing), feel free to put your name forward, but otherwise, I am
keen to continue in this role.

&gt; FOOD & DRINKS
&gt; I think we can leave this for a third party, and sell them the rights too!
&gt; Most venues have a catering department.

Hmmm... Maybe... Our main issue will be lunxh, and I think that in keeping
with tradition, this has to be pizza and coke. Maybe decent pizza from a
real pizzeria, or maybe just pizza hut (ergh!)... Other than this, we could
do with coffee, tea, softdrinks and snack food to be on sale. We could buy
some stuff in bulk and try to make a buck out of it -- extra risk, but we
could cover some costs in this manner... otherwise, I'm happy if someone
knows a linux-friendly deli owner who wants to be involved... maybe the
local deli (local to the venue) would be interested...

&gt; EQUIPMENT
&gt; We'll need some machines on hand for downloading drivers, reading CD's,
&gt; burning CD's, showing how great Linux can be, and so on.  Who has a Linux
&gt; machine that can burn CDs, which they would be happy to bring?  We'll need
&gt; a network, which means ethernet cards, a hub, cables, and so on.  We'll
&gt; need power boards -- lots of them.  How many machines do we need?  I'm
sure
&gt; if smile sweetly at Compaq they'd be happy to lend us some gear.  What do
&gt; we need?

Personally, I'd really like to get 5 to 10 identical entry level (ie fairly
good) PCs on loan from somewhere to use as demo boxes, basically, we install
a different distro on each, and people can then have a play with what they
are going to get before taking the plunge... Identical would be cool because
this makes differences easy to spot, etc... also means someone won't be
looking at a fresh RedHat install and comparing it to a heavily worked on
slackware install and think "I want the slackware one" just because it
happens to have had 50 hours of tuning done to it... Also, I'd really like
to get a kick-ass workstation to show stuff off on (Q3A, other games, GIMP,
music, etc) and a kick-ass server to use as an FTP server, install server,
proxy, cache, and show off Linux running on high-end PC server hardware...
It would be nice, and if someone can contact Compaq (just one person
please -- who is the contact person there for the room?), I will contact
Hallmark, Phil will contact Sun, and someone else can contact SGI, Dell,
Gateway, IBM, the local shop, etc etc... please tell the list before
contacting anyone... ta...

we could also do with some networking stuff... a large 10/100 switch would
be dandy, but we could make do with slower stuff... Does anyone have any
contacts in the networking industry?

&gt; MERCHANDISE & GIVE AWAYS
&gt; The major one is an event t-shirt.  Dare I say that we still need a
design?
&gt; What other things can we sell at the event?  We already have some
&gt; give-aways promised to us, namely some Red Hat CDs.  We should approach
Sun
&gt; for some Star Office disks, and also the other Linux distributions for
&gt; their CD's.  Anything that people can take with them will help make the
&gt; event memorable.  Ideas, please!

giveaways are cool, but remember that companies will give away giveaways
willy-nilly... we really could do with some financial support (pay for
insurance or hall or something) and then that's worth us giving them free
publicity in return... if they give us pens or CDs, then they are really
just giving us some advertising material (not that it's not good to have
these things, it's just that I think we can get more out of these
companies...)

&gt; BUDGET
&gt; What do we do if we make a loss?  We should able to arrange the event so
&gt; that we don't actually loose money, but it might happen.  I think
&gt; merchandising is the riskiest factor, because it needs to be made up front
&gt; and we don't know how many we'll sell.  Given that we already have an
&gt; underwriter for t-shirts the risk is low.

I was kinda hoping to organise things so that every cost was paid for by a
particular sponsor (ie rather than giving us $100 towards hall hire, cover
100% (or 50%) of it) This way, money doesn't have to change hands as many
times.. :)

&gt; What do we do if we make a profit?  I think we're aiming for a balanced
&gt; budget, and if there is a surplus there are a few obvious ways to
&gt; distribute it:
&gt;
&gt;   1. Share it amongst the volunteers.
&gt;   2. Put it in a cookie jar to fund cookies for LinuxSA meetings.
&gt;   3. Donate it to charity.

I suppose that means the penguins at the Zoo then? I think we use any profit
to do something for LinuxSA... maybe funding a LinuxSA library or
something... or perhaps getting a hosted webserver to take the burden off
Geoffrey and Netcraft?

&gt; We need to decide before the event.
&gt;
&gt; This is draft 0.0-0 (alpha).  Let's work on it.
&gt;
&gt; Income
&gt;
&gt; Rent for booths    5 @ $350        $1,750

hmm.. I'd be interested to see if any businesses would be interested...
hopefully yes, but depends what we can offer them

&gt; Tickets          200 @    5         1,000

I really REALLY want to make the event free -- bring your computer, and
we'll give you a linux CD (of your choice of distro) and give you help
installing it and getting started once installed. Pay $12, and get a
t-shirt... pay $5 and get a pizza lunch... pay $1 and get a coke... donate
money here...

&gt; T-Shirts         100 @   12         1,200

hmm... depends exactly what the Rebel.net offer consists of... If Rebel are
offering to do the tshirts completely, and are aiming to break even, do they
expect the InstallFest to cover any shortfall? do they expect to donate any
profit back to the installFest? I suppose that exactly how this works would
be up to you :)

&gt; Sponsorship                         1,000

hopefully... although this could be mixed in with booths...

&gt; Catering rights                       500

hmmm... anyone knwo anything about caterers?

&gt;                                    ------
&gt;                                    $5,450
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Expenses
&gt;
&gt; Rent for venue                     $2,000

Please -- people who mentioned possible venues, can you find out approximate
prices? Paul -- is Endeavour College likely to donate their facilities to a
community event? Others -- what sort of money are we talkgin? this is
essential...

&gt; Telephone       200 @ $  0.25          50

I'd like to see this incorporated into venue hire somehow :) or sponsored by
an ISP or a telco perhaps?

&gt; T-Shirts        100 @ $ 10          1,000


&gt; Printing      1,000 @ $  1 / page   1,000

$1 per page seems expensive, but then I don't know -- I was actually hoping
to get most advertising for free... flyers and posters are different, yes...
maybe we could just do plain old photocopies rather than high gloss
brochures... less effort needs to go into desing then (and we all know how
good geeks are at graphic design..,. about as good as graphic designers are
at programming)

&gt; Insurance                           1,000 (wild guess)

Could someone offer to make enquiries?

&gt;                                    ------
&gt;                                    $5,050
&gt;
&gt; Surplus (Shortfall)                $  400
&gt;

thanks for the effort, David & others!
