I'm not totally certain that the command lines are _precisely_
taken care of by this.
In fact, according to the PGP 6.5.1 manual, there is no -b
parameter in the new PGP, although when I run it, it does actually
get used correctly (after I alter the pgp.cfg file).

But there's a much more serious problem, which is why I have just
re-installed PGP 5.0. 
PGP 6.5.1 seems to not simultaneously sign multiple files presented
to it on the command line.
E.g. if I put 

	pgp -sbat file1 file2 file3 file4

it only produces a signature for "file1".
This means that when I use PGP to sign multiple
compressed tar files for export to an http server area,
I have to provide my password 4 times.
This is just too tedious for words.
(This also means that the sh-script hack won't work perfectly.)

Therefore I've gone back to PGP 5.0.
Maybe I'll just manually correct the advertised big bug in
PGP 5.0i and continue from there.

---- That's what I've just done. Simply correct the 5.0
version at line 1324 of pgpUserIO.c and re-build.
Now I have to consider whether it's worth generating
a new set of PGP keys. I feel tired.....

This all makes me think I should look at GPG again,
but the last time I tried it, I found that GPG could not
decipher stuff written by PGP, e.g. by other people.

The GPG web site says:

========================================
Full replacement of PGP. 
Decrypts and verifies PGP 5.x messages. 
========================================

But when I follow their link to info on difficulties
communicating between PGP and GPG, the page

  <A HREF="http://technocage.com/~caskey/gpg/pgp2gnupg.html">http://technocage.com/~caskey/gpg/pgp2gnupg.html</A>

gives this little message:

==============================================
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /~caskey/gpg/pgp2gnupg.html on this server.
==============================================

Hmmm.
What a mess!

As I often say, "Life is 99% overheads".
I think I'll get back to my 1% of real work for now,
and come back to PGP 5.0i, PGP 6.5.1i and GPG 1.0.1
when someone's got it all sorted out.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
