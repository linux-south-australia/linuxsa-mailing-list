1. I do believe in God!

2. HDD is not "rooted". After unpluging it and pluging back in and
   reformatting, it worked fine as before. New errors came up WITHOUT
   drive connected suggest it's not HDD that's damaged, but something
   wrong with m/board or ide controller.

3. I believe someone on this list has "rooted" sence of humor. No reply
   at all would be more appreciated. Better still, why this is not
   possible.

4. Every other time I asked someone to recover data, people said it was
   not possible, and I ended up doing succeeding anyway.

5. Thank you for your time and to those who seriously try and help, and I
   know there are such people on this list, sorry for for this dribble.

&gt; Do you believe in God? If so I suggest you seek out an old looking
&gt; building with a point roof & a cross shaped thing on top. Upon entering
&gt; said building, drop to your knees and chant the following:
&gt; 
&gt; [Insert name of religious diety you support] forgive me for I have
&gt; sinned greatly. I have permitted M$FAT16-Evil to infect my sacrosanct
&gt; Linux partitions. 
&gt; 
&gt; At this point you should face the following facts...
&gt; 1. Your HDD is rooted
&gt; 2. Your Partitions are rooted
&gt; 3. Your HDD is rooted
&gt; 4. Your Partitions are rooted.
&gt; 
&gt; Seriously, sounds like a pretty standard case of a HDD dying - best
&gt; course is blank the lot then do lots of mke2fs -c /dev/xxx  AND mkdosfs
&gt; -c /dev/not_again
&gt; 
&gt; I am sure this hasnt helped at all, but I feel better :)
&gt; 
&gt; If its any consolation, been there done that & I can lend you one of my
&gt; t-shirts!!
&gt; 
&gt; Phil aka Mr Totally_Insensitive :)
