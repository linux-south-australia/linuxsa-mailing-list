Hi,

Yes, it will be that easy.
Since they are not ATX motherboards (AT) then the power supply is simple and
the wires to supply the motherboard are just power... there are no signaling
lines like ATX power supplies.
The only problem is getting hold of a AT style connector used to plug into
the motherboard.

MWP


&gt; anyone know anything about connecting multiple mother boards up to a
single
&gt; power supply? We have a need (read: desire) to run quite a few PCs,
without
&gt; video, keyboard, mouse, floppy, hard drive, etc (ie a mobo with CPU, RAM,
&gt; NIC and I/O card), but don't really want to fork out for a power supply
for
&gt; each one, particularly as power supplies tend to be capable of 150 to 200
&gt; Watts, and a plain mobo such as the above would be unlikely to consume
more
&gt; than 30W maximum (they're only 486DX2/66s -- yes, from Bryan Wetton). I
&gt; initially thought it would involve nothing but a bit of soldering and some
&gt; spare mobo power supply connectors and some wire -- simply connect them
all
&gt; up in parallel... however, a friend indicated to me that it was likely to
be
&gt; a little harder than that. I don't know exactly what it would involve, and
&gt; he didn't give me any specifics, so I was wondering if anyone here had
done
&gt; anything of the sort, and would care to enlighten me?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt; rr
&gt;
&gt; PS I'm not really into fur seal trading... at least, not much... :)
