Or perhaps people could not send them in the first place.  It
depends on which problem you're trying to solve.  Trying to
solve the problem at the mailing-list end is a solution to
the wrong problem.

&gt; And while it's at it, it could
&gt; send a message to the offender telling them not to ask for receipts
&gt; when sending to a mailing list.  Is this feasible?

How many people post HTML to lists, despite being asked not to?
One of the lists I subscribe to has this clearly appended to
each post, yet people still do it.  Why?  Most likely because
they're unaware that they're doing it.

I was having problems with an _entire domain_ (government
department) that used malformed Return Receipts, and it took me
months to get in touch with someone who would even respond to
my posts (mails to postmaster@ went unanswered).  In the end they
considered it not a problem, because no-one else had complained
about it, then kept right on doing it.  I still get about 10+
bounce mails from this domain a day.

&gt; Thanks for pointing out the pitfalls.  I can see the potential
&gt; problems with receipts.  I can also see the potential benefits.

There aren't that many.  As Glen pointed out, without them being
signed, how do you know if they are legitimate?  As a _diagnostic_,
they may have some benefit.  As a guarantee of successful delivery,
you would have to define "delivery" (sendmail.org goes into this
in some depth).

&gt; This points out the need for receipts or some similar idea.  As much
&gt; as you try to design reliable MTA software, the successful operation
&gt; of the internet relies to a great degree on trust.

So does banking.  When you deposit money into a bank, you're hoping
like hell that they remember this particular transaction.  You're
relying upon the systems that they have in place so that, come the
end of the day, your account still balances.

&gt; Unfortunately such trust sometimes fails.

And this is where the analogy breaks down.  I believe that trust
_should not fail_.  Sure, the Internet email system is a "Best Effort"
delivery, but when you go from something like sendmail which has
a fairly large track record of reliability (albeit not security :-)
behind it, to NTMail which, at one point, was reliably losing about
10% of my email messages, something is fairly wrong with this
picture.  The fact that people buy this crap is even more
disconcerting.  Dan Shearer's talk on Email Vendor's standards
compliance was quite interesting in this regard.

&gt; Email receipts don't solve all problems, but they do attempt to
&gt; detect MTA failure when it occurs.

No, they don't.  They "detect" either the positive "delivery" of a
message, or a positive acknowledgement that the recipient has read
the message (which the user can refuse to send), either message of
which can fail while on the return path back to the sender.

&gt; Perhaps the present email receipting ideas need redesigning
&gt; and refining, but the underlying idea is sound.

It would have to be considerably different from the current
scheme.  Unfortunately, as a "mail administrator" I've seen
receipts abused too much to see much positive light in them
anymore.

[Hmmm, looking at the tone of this message, I'd say I'd need to
cut back on the caffeine, but unfortunately, with this damn
'flu, I have been.  :-(]
