 &gt; As for Linux & Oracle, most of the guys I talked to who did the traning at

I'm not sure that that's entirely relevant:  How/why is Oracle-on-Linux
going to be any different than Linux-on-any-other-UNIX?  

 &gt; That might have changed though now, as that was about 6mnths ago when I was
 &gt; still working there.

Oracle have traditionally worked very closely with Sun, and the RDBMS
and Solaris are both optimized fairly heavily to run well with each 
other.  Most of the high-end Oracle shops are also high-end Sun shops,
and I'd gather that Oracle techs and trainers simply behave as if they
know which side their bread is buttered on.

Even the most die-hard Open Source entheusiast has to admit that 
Linux and the BSDs aren't even within shouting distance of Solaris
when it comes to high-end enterprise-wide systems.  Free Operating
Systems with mysql or postgresql have displaced Sun and SCO at the
low-to-mid end, but high-end UNIX is still almost exclusively Sun.
