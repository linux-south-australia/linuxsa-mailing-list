Hi Tim,

I have a 730 series Acer laptop and installed RH 6.2 on it with no problems 
at all.  It autodetected everything ok so I can't help you there.  However, 
I have the same problem as you detailed in section 4 (the high squeak) 
which I attributed to feedback.  There is an onboard mike on the laptop 
(about 1/3 the way in from the right hand side near the hinge bit ;-).  If 
someone could tell me (us) how to turn the mike off, the squeak will go 
away (I think).

Cheers
Mark Collis

&gt;Hi all
&gt;
&gt;I am having some problems with RH 6.1 on a new Acer TravelMate 730TX.
&gt;
&gt;1) X
&gt;
&gt;Seems to be fine.  The video card runs well off the Mach32 server and the
&gt;screen configures easily.  No probs here.
&gt;
&gt;2) Mouse
&gt;
&gt;It is a Synaptics PS/2 Touchpad.  On the first install, this was detected
&gt;and configured, and worked fine both in X and the vc's.  However, it no
&gt;longer works, after reinstalling.  When I try it (both in x and with gpm)
&gt;it skips wildly all over the screen with just the slightest touch.
&gt;
&gt;3) Network Card
&gt;
&gt;I think this is a fairly standard card.  It's detected during install and
&gt;already has a line in /etc/conf.modules:
&gt;
&gt;alias eth0 eepro100
&gt;
&gt;But when init reaches the stage of starting interface eth0, it just locks.
&gt;I had to reboot into single user mode and remove the conf.modules line
&gt;before I could boot into runlevel 3 (albeit with a bunch of /etc/sysconfig
&gt;modem error messages due to the changed conf.modules).
&gt;
&gt;4) Sound Card
&gt;
&gt;is an ESS Solo-1 PCI AudioDrive.  This seems to be detected upon the
&gt;install and by sndconfig as a ESS Technology | ES1969 Solo-1 Audiodrive,
&gt;and it has an entry in /etc/conf.modules:
&gt;
&gt;alias sound esssolo1
&gt;
&gt;However when Linux boots, it starts squealing at me in the init and
&gt;doesn't stop.  It is a high pitched beep that does not stop.
&gt;
&gt;--
&gt;
&gt;That's about it.  Has anyone successfully set up an Acer laptop before?
&gt;Any suggestions would be greatfully appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
&gt;
