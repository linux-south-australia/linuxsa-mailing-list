if you have a share named "c" on a windows computer thats writeable,
look out.

check for a file c:\network.vbs and c:\network.log

before I go further, this is a general announcement, not directly linux
related, unless your internet gateway is perhaps linux[1] or you have
some weird samba entries[2] in your logs.

The story begins:
Jake thinks that the link is rather slow today, and starts up a tcpdump.
He notices that he is speaking in the third voice, but didn't care.

The tcpdump had lines like this:
20:36:31.130000 w.x.y.z.netbios-ns &gt; 208.41.48.109.netbios-ns: udp 50
20:36:32.390000 w.x.y.z.netbios-ns &gt; 212.58.201.167.netbios-ns: udp 50

where w.x.y.z are IP addresses of various win98 machines.

So Jake and his buddies go and sus out these machines sending out these
weird netbios shit.

note: no, there weren't any firewalls in place, yes I'm a stupid lump of
bohemian camel turd for not having any, and yes, I was be implementing
some RSN.

We descover that there is a process running calles wscript.exe, and it
is causing the crap.

Wscript is a scripting program that allows you to run vb script in
win98. The script turns out to be a netbios based DoS trojan. Not very
well hidden, and easy to recognise, easy to kill, very inefficient, not
violent enough to be a real problem, but if it gets lucky, it can be a
pain in the arse.

What it does it construct randomly generated IP addresses (some of them
are totally bogus, like 5.96.5.122) and try to map a drive to that IPs C
drive. It then copies  itself there, and into the windows startup group.
And repeats. But hilariously enough, keeps a log file (network.log).

One machine had a 1.6 meg log file. Bugger.



[1] tcpdump first told me there was a problem

[2] /var/log/samba/log.smb had an entries like:
000/04/20 06:47:09, 0] lib/access.c:check_access(253)
  Denied connection from 123-78-127-216.ip.sirius.com (216.127.78.123)
