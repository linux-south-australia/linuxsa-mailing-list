When this note about Matthew first appeared,
I resisted the temptation to write one of those
golden-watch speeches.
But, since other people have done it, and the
tempo has died down a little,......


In the olden days, I used to learn 90% of what I learned
about computing by spending 10 hours a day in the
card-punch room and line-printer output room.
(Then the term "lpr" for line printer was very appropriate
indeed.)

Then in later days, I learned 90% of what I learned about
computing by "asking the person next to me" in the
terminal room, and the terminal rooms grew from a room
of four VT-100s to dozens.

And then I left Uni, and there were no more card-punch rooms
or terminal rooms. So I used to learn a little by asking someone
in the office next door, or by Usenet news groups.
(I left a good job in one company because they had no Internet
at all in 1992.)

But then I started trying to use linux (because I couldn't
afford to buy solaris), and I couldn't get it to go for
2 years, except for a command line, and I couldn't get the
ethernet card to work. And the Redhat registration for support
didn't work because it couldn't get through my organisation's
firewall. So I used my dual-boot PC for the wind-OS for 2 years.

And then I got some mail saying that linuxSA had been formed,
and then I found out things by asking people on the list.
And now I've got about 6 or so machines running linux,
and it's all going fine. I don't use the other OSs any more.

So....
linuxSA has been a kind of "virtual card-punch room" to me.
Because you always know that if the Compass assembly language
manual isn't quite clear, you just have to ask someone at the
next card-punch, and either they'll know the answer, or someone
else in the room will overhear the question and answer it.

Therefore....
setting up LinuxSA was a good idea!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
