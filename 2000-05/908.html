&gt; &gt; Could you please quantify this? How is Javascript a security hole?
&gt; 
&gt; Good point.  JavaScript permits the web page designer to control your
&gt; browser much as if you were controlling it.  There should be limitations
&gt; to what can be done with it, but I'm skeptical and don't trust it.  I

	According to all the crap no Netscape's site, JavaScript appears
	akin to Java in that it's decidedly limited in what it can 
	actually do (it can't even read the user's history, for some reason?!)

	Does anyone have any pointers to some info on any bugs in JavaScript 
	(and JScript, which I gather is Microsoft/IE's 'version' of JavaScript)?

	And does David trust Java, for that matter? :)

&gt; observe that browser scripting languages are the enabling technology
&gt; behind the ILOVEYOU attack.

	AFAIK, Visual Basic (the ubiquitous microsoft language that's built
	into everything Microsoft) was the culprit behind the ILOVEYOU
	'virus' (virus? worm?). Also I thought the user actually had to
	'activate' the attachment by double-clicking on it (Bubble-Boy is
	another matter it seems).
