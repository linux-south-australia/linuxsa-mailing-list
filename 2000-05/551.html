&gt; &gt; I don't think that this is quite correct. As far as I know, "Power Good"

&gt; I recommend that you separate the logical signal from the physical 
&gt; encoding, and use the terms "asserted" and "deasserted" when talking 
&gt; about the logical signal, and then state "active high" or "active 
&gt; low" to describe how the signal is physically encoded.  This 
&gt; makes it much easier to say what you mean, as otherwise the 
&gt; asserted/deasserted state and the physical high/low sense get 
&gt; tangled up quite easily.  

the first comment explained it succintly, for the technocrat

+powergood (tristate) 

means a high is the asserted state. the other two conditions have no meaning to
the reciever. The word tristate means, in this context, a floating input is
considered inactive. there is no deasserted state,since there is no logic on
the motherboard to deal with -powerbad

And now, considering PSupplies cost less than $40 each, that only the power
required will be used by each ps (not 250W), can I suggest that the time
involved in splicing a cable, mulltiple times, and the effort in purchasing 2 x
Utilix RFN1776-283 connectors, the ourchase of a good quality Ampol
crimper ($38), warrants this discussion closed.
