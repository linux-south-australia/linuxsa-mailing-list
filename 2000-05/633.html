Hi...

Here's the story:

I administer a lab here that has 11 NT machines with access to the Internet and
a printer.  We also have around 120 other machines (owned by students that live
here) connected to our network.  The PDC is a Linux server running Samba, which
also handles the printing.  The server runs CUPS for printing, as it has some
page logging features.

I've written software that lets us charge the users for printing and Internet
access.  The Internet side is working nicely.  The printing side is a real pain.

This is how it works:
I have a mysql database that stores user credit.  When documents are printed
CUPS logs the number of pages printed to /var/cups/logs/page_log.  I have a
daemon that reads the file and deducts credit from whoever's used the printer.

That works fairly well, except for one problem.  CUPS gets the number of pages
in the document from the %%Pages: line in the postscript.  And Windows NT seems
to have a habit of setting the pagecount to 1.  Intermittently.  And some of the
users (may) have worked out that they can print to a postscript file, change the
%%Pages line from 75 to 1 and use lpr to print the file, getting charged for
only 1 page.

So I wrote a program (essentially a wrapper for lp and lpr) that scans the
postscript for %%Page: lines and counts them.  It then compares the count to the
%%Pages: line, and if they don't match it fixes the %%Pages: line in the
postscript file before it is printed.  This worked quite well for commands like
"lpr something.ps".  But when I looked at the logs that I was generating I
noticed that not everything was getting accounted for.  And I realised that
there was another problem: "cat something.ps | lpr".  So I made the wrapper
intercept stdin and dump it out to a file, then run the real lpr on the new
file.

The lpr wrapper works well in Linux in all standard situations.  But when an NT
machine prints to it from Samba, the wrapper dumps out a 0 length file from
stdin.  And then the file prints SUCCESSFULLY.  At first I thought it must have
been the way I was reading stdin so I tried using read() and write().  But still
0 length files from Samba, and good files when run from a command line.

So, my question:  Where is the input coming from?
- It's not coming from the command line.
- It's not getting printed from a file dumped from stdin.

So the only thing I can think of is that it is, in fact, coming from stdin, and
my code isn't intercepting it properly.  But my code doesn't even /call/ lpr
until all input from stdin has been dumped.  The code to dump from stdin is:

char buf[1024];
int infd, outfd, bytesread;

infd = fileno(stdin);
outfd = open(...);

while ((bytesread = read(infd, buf, sizeof(buf))) &gt; 0)
{
  write(outfd, buf, bytesread);
}
close(outfd);

I wouldn't be surprised if Windows is sending some ^Ds, but I'd have thought
that read() and write() would just pass them through.

So Unix C programming, CUPS, and Samba gurus: what do you reckon?

I'm expect this description is pretty poor.  If you think you might have an idea
of various options feel free to e-mail me for more details.

TIA.
