&gt; &gt;&gt; Email receipts are evil. So are vacation messages.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why evil?
&gt; 
&gt; For the reasons Richard listed, particularly mailing lists.  Do you
&gt; really want to know that 4000+ people got receipt of your message?
&gt; Or that you're on vacation?

Obviously not.  Perhaps the mailing list distribution software could
strip receipt requests from messages?  And while it's at it, it could
send a message to the offender telling them not to ask for receipts
when sending to a mailing list.  Is this feasible?

Thanks for pointing out the pitfalls.  I can see the potential
problems with receipts.  I can also see the potential benefits.


&gt; &gt; The reason I am interested in them is that I am having problems with
&gt; &gt; email reliability.  There have been email messages I have sent, which
&gt; &gt; have not reached their destination (and no message back saying "could
&gt; &gt; not deliver").
&gt; 
&gt; Then that would be the fault of one of the MTA's in the path.  A lot of
&gt; Unix MTA's (sendmail and qmail spring to mind) that go to _great lengths_
&gt; to ensure that they do not accept delivery of a message unless it has
&gt; been reliably written to disk.  Barring media failure, if the software
&gt; crashes it will still have a good copy of the message to work with.  This
&gt; has much to do with the ethos of the authors who care about the reliability
&gt; of email delivery.  Compare this to some other MTA's out there, which
&gt; might happen to store the mail in some sort of MDB ("you whistle and I'll
&gt; point", as my mother says), or crashes at the drop of a hat.  "Zen and
&gt; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" should be mandatory reading at
&gt; whatever software school these "engineers" went to.

This points out the need for receipts or some similar idea.  As much
as you try to design reliable MTA software, the successful operation
of the internet relies to a great degree on trust.  Unfortunately such
trust sometimes fails.  If people decide to install dodgey MTA
software then there's not much you can do about it.  Email receipts
don't solve all problems, but they do attempt to detect MTA failure
when it occurs.


&gt; &gt; Email receipts would seem to be the answer.
&gt; 
&gt; No, they're a hacked on kludge.

Well maybe they're only half an answer, but they do provide some
utility.  Perhaps the present email receipting ideas need redesigning
and refining, but the underlying idea is sound.

Cheers,

Mark.
