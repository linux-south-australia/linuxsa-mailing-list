<H1>modem drops out after 15 hours???</H1>

hello..

i was just wondering if anyone had any advice.

- suse 6.2, kppp, squid, ip forwarding etc, banksia 56k myfastmodem

we currently have a permanent modem connection which is meant to be a
trial (to be replaced by radio),  the problem is, it drops out or stops
working after about 20 hours or so... (depends really when we notice).

We are using it for internet connectivity thru squid. When you first start 
it up (connect), and for the first 3-5 hours it is fine, then at some point 
it stops working properly, either you can't get to pages hosted by it (it 
has a static IP), or you can't use it to surf out
through the internet.. (it is NOT squid here.. we can't use the gateway 
either at this point).

we have been trying to find the solution for about 2 weeks now,
different modem strings etc etc.. We have also changed the timeout (
or whatever, so it never SHOULD hang up ). I heard that maybe the
modem is getting tired after a period of inactivity and attempting
to re-establish the connection, only to screw it all up????

any ideas here would be greatly appreciated, the boss keeps talking
about changing to MSoft..

btw.. anyone have any definite opionion/experience on PHP v ASP? i have
read a lot, but it is pretty hard to tell??
