&gt;
&gt; &gt; - Legalities of setting it up. Is this going to be breaking privacy 
&gt;laws, or
&gt; &gt; anything like that? If we write up our acceptable use policies to notify
&gt; &gt; staff that their email is being recorded, does that make it legal? Where 
&gt;can
&gt; &gt; I find out more information about the entire topic?
&gt;
&gt;IANAL, but, as far as I know, there is no legal issue for you here.
&gt;Email sent/recieved by employees (at work, of course) is the property of
&gt;the employer, and can be treated like any other written work an employee
&gt;creates for you.

Here's what I understand from an article I read awhile ago..
An "external" user sent you an email, that email sitting in your InBox 
becomes the property of the company. The company has the right to backup, 
read, print or even take the whole drive with them to the court. However, 
the original sender still holds the copyright to that email.

When you forward an email, you are making a copy and send. There were some 
discussions that this may actually comes under the copyright law. Note that 
you are not actually breaking the law if you only read and print a hard copy 
of that email.

My former IT manager did just that after I taught him how to forward emails 
without opening them. So instead of pretending/lied about not able to tell 
whose emails he's reading (we share one computer and he did not know how to 
un-mark an read email) he got "clever" -- he forwarded them first, then read 
them, not knowing that he was actually breaking the law ?!

I still don't have the heart to tell him there are footprints allover the 
network with his snooping activity.... oh well, may be one day
