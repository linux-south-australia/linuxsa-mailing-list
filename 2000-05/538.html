&gt;&gt; Email receipts are evil. So are vacation messages.

&gt; Why evil?

For the reasons Richard listed, particularly mailing lists.  Do you
really want to know that 4000+ people got receipt of your message?
Or that you're on vacation?

Also, they are quite often incorrectly set.  At one particular ISP
that I know of, over 50% of the undeliverable mail is from return
receipts with incorrectly set or invalid domains.  Quite a few
MTA's don't allow "&lt;&gt;" in the MAIL FROM: clause, which causes more
problems for systems trying to deliver return receipts.  Non-RFC
compliant scum (TM).

&gt; The reason I am interested in them is that I am having problems with
&gt; email reliability.  There have been email messages I have sent, which
&gt; have not reached their destination (and no message back saying "could
&gt; not deliver").

Then that would be the fault of one of the MTA's in the path.  A lot of
Unix MTA's (sendmail and qmail spring to mind) that go to _great lengths_
to ensure that they do not accept delivery of a message unless it has
been reliably written to disk.  Barring media failure, if the software
crashes it will still have a good copy of the message to work with.  This
has much to do with the ethos of the authors who care about the reliability
of email delivery.  Compare this to some other MTA's out there, which
might happen to store the mail in some sort of MDB ("you whistle and I'll
point", as my mother says), or crashes at the drop of a hat.  "Zen and
the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" should be mandatory reading at
whatever software school these "engineers" went to.

&gt; Email receipts would seem to be the answer.

No, they're a hacked on kludge.
