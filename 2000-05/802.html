<PRE>
Sorry for the lateness of this email, I really intended to do it earlier in
the week, really I did, but work and Other Things got in the way...

----

here's a summary of what's been talked about so far... and some other
stuff... I decided not to attribute things to people -- look back over the
list yourself to see who brought up what when... (it also avoids me being
responsible for inccorect attributions, which are likely to get me in
trouble.. :) Also, please excuse the poor stucture of this mail -- I
cleverly put everything in here at once, and made structuring it hard for
myself.. if you want to reply to this, PLEASE cut out the bits that aren't
relevant to your reply... :)

I'd also like to tell you all that I have sent an email to
<A HREF="mailto:linux-aus@lists.linux.org.au">linux-aus@lists.linux.org.au</A> (an Australia-wide Linux list) to inform them
that we are doing an InstallFest in August or September, so hopefully, we
can get some Australia-wide co-ordination on this... could be good for
publicity -- I'll keep you all informed of any developments... Apparently
Broken Hill is a possibility :)

Also, it has been suggested that we create a mailing list specifically for
discussion of the installFest... it would be nice if this couldb e hosted on
linuxsa.org.au (geoffery?) but Matthew Tippet has also offered hosting for
such a list -- if some one could offer publicly, then we jsut shift this
thread to that list, that would be good... I'd also be appreciative if those
people who are seriously interested in being one of a handfull of organisers
for this could email me privately -- it's best (IMHO) if there's a small
group of people who can commit the itme and energy to be "core" people and
co-ordinate the efforts of the masses... :)



When?

Originally, I suggested we do it in about three months' time... I'd like to
suggest Sept the 23rd (Saturday) or 24th (Sunday) ... or even both... The
reasons for these dates are that they are in the middle weekend of
University holidays (for all three Universities) as well as being in School
holidays... To my way of thinking, this would mean that there would be more
students with more spare time, and they are more likely to come... And I
have more spare time then, due to no students being around to distract me...
:) It also gives us four months to prepare, which is more than enough...

If people disagree with my reasoning (maybe everyone goes on hoidays in the
school/uni holidays) then we could easily do it say around August
26th/27th... I'd prefer to do it either early in school/Uni term or in their
holidays, simply because students will form a large part of our target
audience, and they have deadlines at the end of terms, so won't be able to
spare the time to come along (or to help...)

It was also suggested off-list that we shoudl think about organising the
InstallFest to co-incide iwth some other more mainstream event... like
Generation Linux tied in with Science Week... Does anyone know of any
appropriate events that we could piggy-back?

As for whether we should have it over two days or one, I don't know -- two
would be good, but it involves twice the commitment... Time -- i suggest we
go 10am - 4 or 5pm... We could go later, but I doubt we could start
earlier... Remember that there's at _least_ and hour of setup to do before
we start, and probably significantly more than an hour cleanup to do before
we leave... and then there's pizza...

Where?

Paul Schulz has suggested Endeavour College out at Mawson Lakes, near the
Levels and Tech Park. Apparently there may be a 10Mb link there by the time
we get there, which could come in handy... Are there phone lines there? How
much $$$, etc?

Someone suggested a bowling club, and Robyn Manning suggested an RSL... I
think it wouldn't hurt to make some enquiries, as long as the list is aware
of what enquiries you are making, so we don't double up...

It has also been suggested that a central (as in CBD) location would be
good. Anyone know of anywhere who would be willing to sponsor us with a
room, desks, chairs, electricity, phones and network connection? Adelaide
Uni? Compaq? any Schools? BTW: we should probably be careful to co-ordinate
ourselves a little, so that we don't get 20 different people pestering
Aelaide Uni to let us have a room, so if you are planning to contact anyone
asking for things, please notify the list prior to doing so! :)

Note that any facility either needs to have plenty of desk space and chairs,
or we need to organise these from somewhere else (and I'd suggest that
bringing in enough desks and chairs would be a Pain In The Ass)...


Network:

switches, hubs, cables, etc.... if there is someone or an organisation
willing to help us out in one hit, this would be better than twenty people
bringing bits and pieces and us hacking away to get it working together...
any offers? Of course, individual offers are still appreciated, and as
someone suggested, having these bits and pieces available on the day, even
if everything else is planned and accounted for, can be a good idea if
something goes wrong, which it invariably does... but if some company could
sponsor the loan of a network infrastructure, it would be worth us putting
their name up in prominent places.. :)

Also, someone has offered that they could burn copies of important parts of
the AARnet mirror, so we could plonk them on a server on our
InstallFestNetwork, partially to make downloads of extra software faster,
and partially to demonstrate Linux as a server... if someone is interested
in donating a Linux Server for this purpose (obviously it's only needed for
a few days, but needs some decent disk space -- performance won't be a real
problem...)... Maybe someone who sells computers running Linux would be
interested in doing this to promote their services... maybe even Dell or
Compaq or SGI would be interested... Any offers of servers, or anyone know
anyone they could ask?

Labels:

Certainly nametags or hats or something distinctive for organisers, and also
labels for people's stuff... We've had an offer for printing nametags and
taking pictures, but maybe the photos aren't quite neccessary, and they seem
to be pretty controversial among our more photo-shy members, so I'll leave
that subject open to further non-violent discussion... :)


Other Facilities

Whiteboards/projectors etc... It would be really cool if we could have some
mini-tutes occasionally, maybe scheduled... just introductions to things
like the GPL, filesystems, Man pages, etc... 10 minute things, with time for
questions... Also for impromtu things, like when you are trying to explain
something to someone and could really do with something to draw on... if
anyone has whiteboards, or if any venues with whiteboards exist, that woudl
be dandy...

Someone suggested off-list that we should have phone lines as well/instead
so we can set people up ready to plug into their phone lines at home, and be
on the internet, fully tested and ready to go... It would be good if we can
simulate the environment where the computers will return to as much as
Possible, so as to make it easier for newbies...

Cheat sheets -- these are actually pretty important.. we need to be able to
give/sell people something to remind them of what to do. Sarah had some
sheets from Generation Linux, which we could use as a base (assuming that's
OK with you, Sarah). However, I think these were pretty specific to the
distro and (provided) PCs they were using at the venue there... we may need
a few different versions for different situations or distros, or maybe we
could just grab a generic document and make it a little more specific...
Also we need directions for installers... particularly a checklist and
directions on what not to forget or how best to go about introducing a
newbie to the wonders of Linux.... And of course, a legal disclaimer... see
<A HREF="http://www.vlug.org/ifht/waiver.html">http://www.vlug.org/ifht/waiver.html</A> for an eg... Also look at
<A HREF="http://www.vlug.org/ifht/">http://www.vlug.org/ifht/</A> for an InstallFest HowTo... David Lloyd has
offered to co-ordinate "cheat sheets", and that woudl be fine by me...
although his point about not needing 50 explanations of 'ls' is true for the
wider world also, so I suggest that as much use as possible is made of
existing documentation...



Food/drink:

We could use a coloured dot system, where people pre-pay on entry, and
receive a coloured dot, and only people with dots get pizza... Potentially,
we could offer helpers free pizza, but personally, I'd be happy with
everyone paying for their share... We could also do with Coke (& other soft
drinks) and Coffee (and tea, etc) being available... being a coffee lover,
I'd really like it if we could get hold of some sort of decent coffee (maybe
someone could talk the Adelaide Uni Computer Science department into loaning
us their coffee machine ;)  ... Or maybe someone who is involved in the
coffee industry (?) could work something out for us (Vittoria sponsorship,
anyone?) Anyone else got any ideas? I'm not adverse to involving
profit-making businesses (assuming there is no legal problems with that...)
in this, so if anyone runs a deli or something, and wants to sell snack
food... step forward! Otherwise, I suppose we could organise it ourselves...


What do we install?

OK... there's basically three options here... we promote and install ONE
(maybe two) distros of Linux (say RedHat and/or Debian)... this gives us the
advantage of consistency, but I personally don't like it as it removes one
of Linux's main advantages -- choice... Second, we could promote and install
any distribution of Linux... Individual installees and installers make their
own decisions, and installers with some experience in a distro do the
installs for that distro... We could have somehow equal information
available about all distros, so that newbies can make an informed choice,
rather than just defaulting to RedHat... Third option, is we do the same,
but include the *BSDs, and pretty much any other free OS (whether we make it
Open Source only or not, is (yet) another question -- we could theoretically
include Solaris x86 and BeOS, although I'm not personally in favour of doing
this)... I doubt the BSD family would be over popular, but I see no reason
not to incluide it if the interest is there, as long as no-one comes along
expecting to get Linux, but gets hoodwinked by BSD zealots and ends up with
the wrong OS... :)

Personally, I'm in favour of installing whatever Open Source OS people
want... I'd be inclined to promote it as a Linux event, sponsored by
LinuxSA, but have whatever people want being available at the event, and
maybe advertised in the fine print...


Publicity -- Name

Someone suggested off-list that we call it Install-O-Rama (or Install-A-rama
or some variant) rather than InstallFest... I like Install-O-Rama,
personally... :) Any opinions? would Install-O-Rama be too controversial?

Also, calling it the LinuxSA Install&lt;X&gt; would give us ownership of it, and
provide some publicity for LinuxSA... We'd end up with an influx of newbies,
both at meetings and on the list... I assume that attaching this user
group's name to the event will not be controversial...


Publicity -- slogans & Tshirts...

Many thanks must go to David Newall and Rebel.net for offering to sponsor
the TShirts and hosting a T-Shirt design competition... see
<A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~tuxshirt/">http://www.rebel.net.au/~tuxshirt/</A>  for details... If we can get Tshirt
details finalised early (Preferably by the June Meeting, or July at the
latest), we can get them printed and LinuxSA people can start wearing them
around the place as walking billboards... Please send designs in to the
address  on that page -- even if they are nothing more than hand-sketched
rough drawings -- If you ahve a good idea, but can't draw, send it in
anywat, and someone with more articstica talent can re-implement it... maybe
you can share the prize :)

Note that if we get any sponsorship from anywhere, the sponsors are likely
to want their names displayed both at the event and on any publicity
material, including Tshirts... I see no reason why we can't do this, and I
assume that if we were to get sponsorship in different forms from multiple
competing entities (say ISPs), then we should be able to put them all on
there -- they will all be promoted as Linux-friendly ISPs in that way... as
long as they don't get all ultra-competitive about it and demand that we
remove their competitor's logos... :)

slogans and tshirt ideas are listed below...

I went to InstallFest2000 and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt ... and root
access. Mwuh hah hah hah ha!

Web Page/preregistration

It was suggested that we hook up an RDBMS to let people pre-register... I
have no problems if someone wants to do that, so anyone who has the time and
know-how, put up your hand, and make sure we don't have two or more separate
pages doing this... ideally, it woudl be a really simple page, so don't go
overboard on the frames and grapics :) Also remember that is has to be
hosted somewhere -- any offers? Personally, I woudl think it quite
acceptable if we just had an email address for this purpose (although I do
see the advantage that a webpage offers)... This could be used for both
installers and installees... don't forget to discuss this a little before
just going ahead and implementing it -- we don't want multiple competing
registration pages... :) Also, it wouldn't hurt to have some sort of list of
people who help and what they know about -- maybe we need a list of major
areas where installers can rate themselves out of 10 (max rating is, of
course, 9, unless you wrote the software :) so people are accessible if
there is a problem...

the webpage itself... Michael Davies has kindly put together a webpage
(thanks Michael) at <A HREF="http://www.senet.com.au/~michaeld/installfest2000.html">http://www.senet.com.au/~michaeld/installfest2000.html</A>
... please provide input on it, and talk to him about that (or tell the
list)... It would be really good if we could get a tshirt design sorted
early, and get the page to look somewhat similar, so please think about that
as well when submitting designs. :) I also think it would be good if we
coudl get that page hosted on the linuxsa.org.au domain (Geoffery?), or at
least linked to there.. perhaps it should have a common look... perhaps the
LinuxSA pages should be redesigned too ?  Who knows -- as Matthew Tippet
said upon leaving, everyone is welcome to contribute in any way they can
think of, and I'm sure Geoffery wouldn't object to some help on the web page
(ok, I'm not sure, I'm just assuming, but anyway... :)


Advertising/other publicity

Full page spreads in the Advertiser and street press, APC, LinuxJournal,
etc... 30 second slots on Channel 9... hmm... maybe we better get real...
someone suggested that I walk naked through Rundle Mall with a giant penguin
stuck to my arse, holding a big sign saying "Come to InstallFest or I'll
remove the Penguin"... I don't think that's a really good idea, but thanks
to Michael Neuling for suggesting it :)

Geoffery -- can you get something in your APC column when we have better
details (or is there something even better you could wangle?)

There is potential for plenty more publicity here -- seems that there are
poeple on this list with CONTACTS... :) I've been informed off-list about
potential mainstream media plugging from more than one source... stay
tuned...


People...

Again, the most important aspect of this event is the people, so keep
offering your help.. please also inform others of this event, so we can get
a bit of a groundswell happening in preparation for it (I see no reason why
non-linuxSAers can't come along to help install things on the day, if they
know a little about what they are doing, so don't hesitate to invite other
Linux people not on the list...)

I could maintain a list of people who offered to help, but I haven't been
doing so, so be aware that you'll need to re-express your interest once
we've sorted more out...

Also, anyone willing to present for 10-30 mins on basic topics, and field
questions on them... preferably twice during the course of the day... I'd be
happy to hear from you -- remember, this isn't about tech stuff, or anything
cutting edge, it's about newbies, so basic Linux usage, what X is, the LDP,
mailing list ettiquette

VMWare

someone suggested that we run demos of VMWare... I think that is an
excellent idea... any voluteers? any VMWare resellers? Also, I think
technologies like WINE would be good things to demo, as well as StarOffice,
WordPerfect, ApplixWare, etc etc etc...

Commercial entities

I personally have no objections to commercial entities being involved in
various ways... Whether that's in terms of sponsorship (tshirts, internet
access, $$$ for venue hire, network gear, CDs, givaways, etc, etc) or in
terms of coming along and selling Linux-related stuff (software, hardware,
books, services, training, coffee, etc) I think that's great... We really
should encourage Adelaide businesses to get commercially involved in
Linux -- good for them, good for Linux, good for Adelaide, good for us...

Final words....

phew... that was long... At some stage this week, I will make up a list of
people and what they have offered to organise, so we can get a mapping
between individuals and areas of responsibility... hopefully, if we do this
right, we can get organised in record time... :)

Feel free to contribute anything... :)

time for bed... (too late to proofread, so excuse tyops and brainos)
