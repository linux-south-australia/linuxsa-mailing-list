anyone know anything about connecting multiple mother boards up to a single
power supply? We have a need (read: desire) to run quite a few PCs, without
video, keyboard, mouse, floppy, hard drive, etc (ie a mobo with CPU, RAM,
NIC and I/O card), but don't really want to fork out for a power supply for
each one, particularly as power supplies tend to be capable of 150 to 200
Watts, and a plain mobo such as the above would be unlikely to consume more
than 30W maximum (they're only 486DX2/66s -- yes, from Bryan Wetton). I
initially thought it would involve nothing but a bit of soldering and some
spare mobo power supply connectors and some wire -- simply connect them all
up in parallel... however, a friend indicated to me that it was likely to be
a little harder than that. I don't know exactly what it would involve, and
he didn't give me any specifics, so I was wondering if anyone here had done
anything of the sort, and would care to enlighten me?

Thanks

PS I'm not really into fur seal trading... at least, not much... :)
