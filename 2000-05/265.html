Hello to everyone on this list my name is Michael Kratz and I am new to 
Linux, I have a few questions if some people would not mind answering them 
for me.

Intro-
I am going to set up a webserver for my parents business using RedHat Linux 
6.1 (I got it from the RedHat Linux for Dummies book) I have yet to actually 
install and get linux running on the intended machine as this machine is 
still being used for another purpose. I am however wanting to install it 
onto my laptop which I have spare at the moment, my laptop has nothing on it 
and I would be happy making it an entire linux environment (no dos or win) - 
thats the background now heres the questions:

1. My laptop has a 1.25Gb HDD and a TFT active matrix screen, I would like 
to know how I can get Linux to install on my laptop. I cannot have my floppy 
disk drive and CDROM in at the same time, its one or the other, and a reboot 
is required each time I swap. My laptop bios does not support booting from 
the CD. However I have tried running autoboot.bat from the cd once dos is 
loaded on the machine but the GUI comes up all displaced and misalligned. I 
would like to know if there is some way that I can install Linux onto my 
Laptop?

2. Is it possible to set up a Linux webserver machine to respond to multiple 
IP addresses, eg. I have a telstra connection which uses an IP like this 
139.130.138.123 (has been altered) this ip address is for the computer which 
is connected to telstra. I also have several other IP addresses which I 
intend to use for the webserver and mail eg 203.38.200.123 and 
203.38.200.124 for www and mail respectively now what I would like to know 
is whether I can set up a linux machine to cater for all three of these ip 
addresses ?

3. I want to be able to set up the following on a single computer:
Website,POP3,Firewall,IP Masquerading,Gateway is this possible on a single 
computer. If so what FREE linux programs should I use, I have already 
decided to use APACHE for the webserver, and from what I have read SENDMAIL 
is a good email server, and IPMASQ is good for NAT.

Any suggestions are welcomed, if you wish to send the email directly to me 
you can address it to <A HREF="mailto:michael@westland.mtx.net">michael@westland.mtx.net</A>

Thanks to anyone who can answer any of these questions for me.
