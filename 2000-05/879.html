<PRE>
&gt; I shall coordinate the creation of the "Cheat Sheets". I invite "Cheat
&gt; Sheets" on all topics that anyone believes will be useful for a Linux
&gt; Newbie. "Cheat Sheets" should show the following qualities:

very cool -- please send anything along these lines to David. Also, please
take advantage of existing documentation! If someone was to spend an hour
trawling the net for good newbie doco, I'm certain we could adapt it in less
time than it would take to write our own... So please, in the spirit of Open
Source, use what's already there, enhance it, and contribute it back to the
community.


&gt; * ease of use
&gt; * easy to print [i.e. graphics are fine but if you use 
&gt; graphics, perhaps
&gt; to show how to use a GUI tool, produce one without graphics...ink is
&gt; VERY expensive]
&gt; * good English
&gt; 
&gt; As to the last point, it would be great if any truly 
&gt; multilingual people
&gt; could actually volunteer translation services if needed. We 
&gt; are, indeed,
&gt; a multicultural society and we may attract one or two people 
&gt; whose first
&gt; language (mother tongue :-P) is not English.

hmmm... Valid point, but realistically, I think that this will be more
trouble than it's worth... Perhaps if someone could find some pre-existing
doco on the web in various languages, and perhaps have a Laser Printer
available at the InstallFest for printing things like this on demand...

&gt; Unlike myself! [Oh, I couldn't resist it...anyone who wants to whip me
&gt; will have to get in line]

Oh, behaaave!

&gt; I can accept the following formats:
&gt; 
&gt; * Tex
&gt; * Latex
&gt; * Lyx
&gt; * sgml
&gt; * Star Office Writer
&gt; * RTF
&gt; * troff and nroff
&gt; * Microsoft Word (yes, I know, I know...please try NOT to use MS WORD)

IMHO, HTML would be excellent, as it can be put onlne with ease -- we could
enhance the LinuxSA webpages through our efforts :)

&gt; Your document should contain the following elements:
&gt; 
&gt; * author
&gt; * short description/abstract
&gt; * main body of the document
&gt; * references to more "in depth" documents

IMHO, I think a document of how to get help would be among the most valuable
things we could have. Particuarly if it covers examples of how to go about
solving certain types of problems (eg "I want to get a list of all the sizes
of files in my directory" and walk them through the thought process needed
to use apropos (man -k), info, the web, the mailing list... etc)... Also it
needs to have links to handy places to find help (RFCs, LDP, etc...)

&gt; I undertake to do the following:
&gt; 
&gt; * by the end of the week, I'll have an automatic topic submission form
&gt; up at my web page (<A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~lloy0076">http://www.rebel.net.au/~lloy0076</A>)
&gt; 
&gt; This will automatically catalogue who is working on what particular
&gt; "Cheat Sheet" and hopefully also contain downloadable 
&gt; versions of "Cheat
&gt; Sheets" for review PRIOR to the event

peer reveiw is important, even of documents obtained from elsewhere -- If
you think you can explain something better, do it...

&gt; * I shall work with the authors to correct any obvious content errors
&gt; and grammatical/English mistakes

again, others -- please feel free to contribute to this (the more the
merrier...)

&gt; I actually have edited a number of newsletters for various
&gt; organisations. I'm sure you would all be aware that I can 
&gt; speak English
&gt; with panache and verve; hopefully our "Cheat Sheets" will combine
&gt; usefulness with user-friendliness.
&gt; 
&gt; * At a certain point of time I shall prepare the documents 
&gt; for printing
&gt; 
&gt; I'm uncertain at the moment who will print the documents. I 
&gt; have a mind
&gt; to approach the business owner of Copies Now at North Terrace with a
&gt; view to some form of sponsorship. He is a friend of mine and has
&gt; sponsored a number of worthy causes before. Let me put it 
&gt; straight now -
&gt; I am flat broke so I simply can't afford to print the dang things so
&gt; someone, please [i.e. RICHARD], tell me BEFORE the point of 
&gt; time how I'm
&gt; supposed to pay for them.

_maybe_ we could convince someone to sponsor us for an onsite printer for
print on-demand... This would be ideal -- we just need to find the right
sponsor... any ideas?

&gt; 
&gt; I could, of course, hand write each one...but you'd need to have the
&gt; "How To Read David's Handwriting HOWTO" :-)))))
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this brings people up to date with what I'm thinking. I'm also
&gt; going to approach the owner of Market Plaza Computers (in 
&gt; Grote St) and
&gt; see what type of sponsorship I might be able to get from him...

cool.
