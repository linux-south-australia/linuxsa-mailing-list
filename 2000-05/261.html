&gt; People,
&gt; 
&gt; This is an announcement that I don't like to make, but in the same way I
&gt; am glad it is happening.
&gt; 
&gt; As of the end of this month I will be no longer in Adelaide.  I am moving
&gt; to Melbourne to do some contracting.
&gt; 

Melbourne's great gain is our great loss.


&gt; Four years ago, when I started LinuxSA, I wanted to create a group that
&gt; would teach people something on a regular basis, and a mailing list that
&gt; was open to all and useful to a lot of people.
&gt; 
&gt; I feel that LinuxSA has become just that.
&gt; 

It obviously has, with a good deal of success IMHO. In fact people like
me would often struggle without this resource.


&gt; Warmest regards to all,

And to you also. Having done a stint programming in Melbourne, I hope it
is as successful for you as it was for me (career changing), and I trust
that you will, like me, see sense eventually and return to sunny SA when
the time is right for you.

Thanks,

Bruce
