Sorry, but I am not really sure what you mean.

Seeing as it is not so late a night I'll try to explain again...

Me and my whole family use the Internet through my network at home. There
are three machines with web browers. Two are Linux, one is Windows. All
internet traffic is run through my server, which does IP Masq and also has
Squid for caching. At the moment, I can only tell how much traffic is
going in and out of my internet connection, not from which user.

As a result, I have no idea which user is responsible for the astronomical
use of the Internet over the past month (like about 600% higher than last
month). As a result, I just want to be able to keep track of who is using
how much in order to ensure responsible use.

As there is very little traffic apart from web browsing (everyone uses web
mail) using Squid to keep track seems a very sensible way of doing things.

I can't see why this would cause headaches or seem draconian to anyone.


Cheers,

Sam.

&gt; That may be fine. Nonetheless, how do your users "use" the Internet now?
&gt; Wouldn't there be less draconian ways to do this? Like...looking at
&gt; freshmeat.net one can find umpteen log analyzers for various purposes.
&gt; If you don't intend to restrict anything, why don't you just find a way
&gt; to find them without causing everyone headaches?
