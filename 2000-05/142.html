Hmmmm, sri that my sense of humour displeased you - just trying to
lighten your day :)

&gt; 2. HDD is not "rooted". After unpluging it and pluging back in and
&gt;    reformatting, it worked fine as before. New errors came up WITHOUT
&gt;    drive connected suggest it's not HDD that's damaged, but something
&gt;    wrong with m/board or ide controller.

With the greatest of respect, if you got "new errors" and think its m/b
or ide controller  and NOT the hdd, then the problem WILL occur again!!
If it was the hdd then mke2fs -c etc etc will fix it .. in my
experience, the errors you got happen, you clean up the hdd, and then if
you're lucky it doesnt happen again for a "while".

ALSO:
rooted: (Australian Colloquialism) Definition: broken, malfunctioning,
working unsatisfactorily.

Therefore it was "rooted" :)

&gt; 3. I believe someone on this list has "rooted" sence of humor. No reply
&gt;    at all would be more appreciated. Better still, why this is not
&gt;    possible.

If you had read my msg without getting grumpy you would have seen this
bit:
Seriously, sounds like a pretty standard case of a HDD dying - best
course is blank the lot then do lots of mke2fs -c /dev/xxx  AND mkdosfs
-c /dev/not_again

&gt; 4. Every other time I asked someone to recover data, people said it was
&gt;    not possible, and I ended up doing succeeding anyway.

????if you formatted your hdd, how did you recover the data?????
