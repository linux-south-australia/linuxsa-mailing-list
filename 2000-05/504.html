Hi all,

Yes you are correct, there is the "Power Good" wire (orange lead) which does
tell the motherboard when the power supply has become stable. Youll prolly
find though that many motherboards now ignore this signal. There is no
problem with connecting this wire to multiple motherboards.

As for the power supply needing a load to "turn-on", youll find that every
power supply brand is different when it comes to this.
Some will turn on and others wont.  As for how much load is needed, this
also depends on the power supply unit and who it is made by.

BTW... if your after a pinout for the AT connector, it is here:
<A HREF="http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/~putnam/pcpsu_connector.html">http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/~putnam/pcpsu_connector.html</A>
took me quite a while to find that :(

MWP

&gt; I don't think that this is quite correct. As far as I know, "Power Good"
&gt; comes from the PSU to the motherboard, and is supposed to go +5V when
*all*
&gt; PSU voltages have stabilised. This signal, coupled with some simple logic
on
&gt; the m/b will stop the CPU beginning to execute boot instructions when
before
&gt; the PSU is stabilised and all other logic chips have had a chance to
&gt; power-up to their initial state.
&gt;
&gt; The most likely cause of the problems is that, as far as I know, almost
all
&gt; AT PSU power-supplies are "switched-mode" PSU's, and need a minimum load
to
&gt; function. I think if you put a honking great full height, 5 1/4 inch old
&gt; SCSI or ESDI (ah, memories) drive or some such on the PSU, it will have
&gt; enough load to function.
&gt;
&gt; With the motherboard unplugged, there is probably not enough load to get
the
&gt; PSU to start.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; that information is wrong. 'power good' is required.
