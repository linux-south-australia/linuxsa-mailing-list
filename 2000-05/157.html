Alan,
    From the look of it, what you want to do looks similar
to what I had to do for an Operating Systems course a couple
of years ago, and it used semaphores to do it. We actually
used dual semaphores for the solution, and this worked quite
well with a class of about 90 students being able to
implement their solutions with a maximum of 10 semaphores
being available TO THE ENTIRE COMPUTER SCIENCE NETWORK.
(O.K. so our class were probably the only ones who needed to
use them but that is still pretty good). What you seem to be
doing in the second pseudo-block is implement semaphores
over an entire code block, and doing the machines work for
it while giving the process a license to control it's own
destiny, whereas in the first pseudo-block, the machine will
block the process until the critical area becomes available
and the process cannot hog critical areas. This is a much
safer way to do things as if a process controls it's own
destiny, then potentially it could endless loop inside
critical areas and no other processes would ever execute.
The secret is to semaphore only the CRITICAL areas, and
limit your processes into sharing some other way.
Semaphores, I am told, are a reasonably efficient way to
allow a user to have some control over the way his processes
run, without giving him access to a higher machine level
(eg. imagine if every user had root priveleges).

    I am no guru on this topic, but I found Andrew
Tannenbaum's "Modern Operating Systems" ISBN 0-13-588187-0
helpful in explaining the problems and some solutions, and I
also used "Operating Systems : Internals and Design
Principles" by William Stallings ISBN0-13-917998-4 helpful
when used with Tannenbaum. Good Luck
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;But it looks like all that semaphore stuff
&gt;resides in the kernel, and every time I want to
&gt;access the shared memory, I have to do a system call,
&gt;which has a fair amount of overhead, I assume.
&gt;Each time I go into critical code, I have to do
&gt;
&gt;===========================================
&gt;get exclusive access (system call)
&gt;do critical stuff
&gt;relinquish exclusive access (system call)
&gt;===========================================
&gt;
&gt;This can't be the most efficient solution surely.
&gt;I had hoped for something like:
&gt;
&gt;===========================================
&gt;try to get exclusive access (user-space code)
&gt;if busy, wait on access (system call)
&gt;do critical stuff
&gt;relinquish exclusive access (user-space code)
&gt;===========================================
&gt;
&gt;Form my operating systems book by Deitel
&gt;(<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/php3/e1.php3?o">http://www.topology.org/php3/e1.php3?o</A>=35950),
&gt;I had understood that there are Dekker's and Dijkstra's
&gt;algorithms that can be implemented without using
&gt;kernel mode to guarantee exclusive access.
&gt;I must confess that I did not do a compsci degree.
&gt;(I only attended about 5 lectures, and 4 of those were
&gt;by a long-haired Egyptian saxaphone player. I also did
&gt;a 2-week fortran course for mathematicians in 1972.)
&gt;Therefore I don't feel at all confident on these
&gt;serious comp-sci things.
&gt;(In 1972, multitasking was still regarded as a
&gt;modern breakthrough.)
&gt;
&gt;So my question now is:
&gt;Does anyone know of a set of library calls to implement
&gt;user-space mutual exclusion primitives?
&gt;Or where I can find a good book on this?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Alan Kennington.
&gt;
&gt;PS. The purpose of this is still to write an Apache module
to
&gt;do some serious bandwidth balancing/throttling.
&gt;The existing modules for this are educational but do not
&gt;do the right job.
