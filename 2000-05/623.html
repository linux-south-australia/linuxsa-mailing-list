&gt; Technically it's a web-server survey, but it might be worth pointing out
&gt; that 60% of those surveyed use some version of Apache on some version of
&gt; Unix. Another site that's worth taking a look at is:


does this include proxy/caches? or just web servers (i haven't looked)

&gt; I've no doubt that Windows NT could run your proxy server. Putting it
&gt; bluntly - and I am going to put my asbestos suit on here - I'd stick
&gt; with your bosses' idea. Let the boss install Windows NT. Let the system
&gt; fall over continuously and be quite inefficient. Just MAKE sure you are
&gt; the one who always fixes the problems.


unless your NT server is pitifully underpowered, it wont fall over.


Points to think about:


1.	My experience is that NT as a proxy server is a binary state thing. It
either works very well, or its a pig. To use it effectively you need to
use ACL (access control lists) to do accounting and autherisation (who can access the web and who
cant) on a per user basis.
	In the setups that I have seen, this means
installing a MSproxy client thing on the windows boxes. This in fact
replicates your winsock.dll to allow you to do things like port
replication, which allows you to, say, exist on a private
192.168.*.* network with your proxy being the only real IP machine, and
your ICQ will still work. In theory.

2.	Cost, free vs. $100's

3.	Ease or configuration - equal in my book. A
GUI-wizard-follow-your-nose thing, or a text file

4.	Reporting and accounting. Squid will log everything to a text
file, allowing simple scripts to compile info. MS proxy can log everything
into an .mdb, allowing to use Access perhaps, or even ODBC connections to
the .mdb.

5.	Cost. See above

6.	In the recent proxy bake-off, squid came third, after dedicated
poxy hardware.

7.	cost :)
