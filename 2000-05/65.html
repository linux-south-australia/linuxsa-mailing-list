&gt; Hi everyone, I've just installed Linux on my PC.

Excellent.

&gt; in Macintosh and recently in Windows, Linux's way of
&gt; thinking is quite different.

Yes, it is. In fact, Windows and Macintosh are Different Operating
Systems (aka DOS [tm]).

 Here's where I'm having
&gt; trouble... How do I setup and run Wine? (the Windows
&gt; emulator)

You install it and read the readme. Putting it slightly bluntly, why
don't you become familiar with Linux before attempting to have Linux
emulate Windows. If you really need to emulate Windows, why don't you
USE Windows...Windows emulates itself badly enough without having to
bother with having Linux emulate Windows...

I should point out that I am not imply that Wine which isn't an emulator
is an emulator. I am using the term emulate as in "run".

&gt; and secondly, I cant seem to change the proxy
&gt; settings in the Netscape Communicator that came in the
&gt; distribution.

Do you know how to change the proxy settings for Netscape Communicator
under another operating system? It's in
edit-prefererences-advanced-proxies where it has been since at least
version 3.0...

&gt; I have tried CorelLINUX 1.1 and I currently
&gt; have Mandrake 5.2 installed with the KDE GUI.

Excellent.

&gt; I have setup
&gt; the PPP dialer and the modem is connecting fine to the ISP,
&gt; but Netscape, or any other mail or browser isn't talking to
&gt; the ISP. Hope someone can help me.

Hmmm....not talking? As in you cannot resolve names such as
www.rebel.net.au or it just disconnects? You've probably buggered your
DNS settings up...add your DNS servers like this to the file called
/etc/resolv.conf:

nameserver [whatever the IP address your ISP says the name servers are
running on]

You could attempt to use a program called netcfg or linuxconf...you will
have to log in as root.

ALSO, at a command prompt try doing ping 203.20.69.66...if you start
seeing lots of funny numbers, press ctrl+c and see if there are any
errors. You should see something like:

 PING 203.20.69.66 (203.20.69.66) from 203.20.69.75 : 56(84) bytes of
data.
64 bytes from 203.20.69.66: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=226.1 ms
64 bytes from 203.20.69.66: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=190.4 ms

--- 203.20.69.66 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 190.4/208.2/226.1 ms

Yours may be a lot slower than mine. It's the IP of my own ISP...if you
see something similar (take note of the packet loss statistic at the
end) then you can see your ISP. Try again with ping
www.rebel.net.au...if it suddenly comes up with errors, reports nothing
then your name server is dead.

Quite simple really!!!

Incidentally, you should also know that there is a heap of documentation
in /usr/doc and also that in /var/log there is a file called "messages".
Check it....you can either do:

cat messages | less

OR tail -[some number] messages | less

some number gives you some number of lines starting from the end (most
recent) of the files.
