&gt; &gt; Perhaps the mailing list distribution software could
&gt; &gt; strip receipt requests from messages?
&gt; 
&gt; Or perhaps people could not send them in the first place.  It
&gt; depends on which problem you're trying to solve.  Trying to
&gt; solve the problem at the mailing-list end is a solution to
&gt; the wrong problem.

Whether this is the wrong problem or not is debatable as we shall see
later in this email.  At the very least my point demonstrates that
this particular pitfall might be avoided without getting rid of
receipts.  If I'm right about receipts having utility, then this might
be a sensible way of overcoming mailing list abuse.


&gt; &gt; And while it's at it, it could send a message to the offender
&gt; &gt; telling them not to ask for receipts when sending to a mailing
&gt; &gt; list.  Is this feasible?
&gt; 
&gt; How many people post HTML to lists, despite being asked not to?
&gt; One of the lists I subscribe to has this clearly appended to
&gt; each post, yet people still do it.  Why?  Most likely because
&gt; they're unaware that they're doing it.

Even if they don't do anything about it, you will only have one
additional email per post rather than 4000.  And _some_ people will
take notice of the message --- especially when they get sick of
receiving this message each time they post to the list.  The main
purpose of the message would be as a form of education.


&gt; &gt; Thanks for pointing out the pitfalls.  I can see the potential
&gt; &gt; problems with receipts.  I can also see the potential benefits.
&gt; 
&gt; There aren't that many.  As Glen pointed out, without them being
&gt; signed, how do you know if they are legitimate?  As a _diagnostic_,
&gt; they may have some benefit.  As a guarantee of successful delivery,
&gt; you would have to define "delivery" (sendmail.org goes into this
&gt; in some depth).

I freely admit that they are not a foolproof _guarantee_ of successful
delivery.  But they provide significantly more evidence of delivery
than with nothing.  The underlying idea is sound.  If you were to
design a system which _guaranteed_ delivery, operating on the net, it
would have to use some form of receipting mechanism.  Your arguments
lead me to believe that the current system is far from ideal, and
probably needs improving, but I still believe the current receipting
is better than nothing.  As you admit, current receipting has some
value as a diagnostic.  It also has value if you have an email you
want to send, and have some level of confidence that it arrived.  I
wouldn't use this for financial transactions for example, but suppose
you want to send details of a party to your friends, and you want to
be sure they all received it?  Perhaps you wouldn't get receipts from
some because their server disabled the option, but from the rest you
would have a reasonable level of confidence that the message was
received.


&gt; &gt; This points out the need for receipts or some similar idea.  As much
&gt; &gt; as you try to design reliable MTA software, the successful operation
&gt; &gt; of the internet relies to a great degree on trust.
&gt; 
&gt; So does banking.  When you deposit money into a bank, you're hoping
&gt; like hell that they remember this particular transaction.  You're
&gt; relying upon the systems that they have in place so that, come the
&gt; end of the day, your account still balances.

This is true, but the key point here is that a bank's infrastructure
is owned and controlled by a single entity: the bank company.  It is
able to ensure that every branch uses the same reliable software (the
"sendmail" of the banking world perhaps).  The internet is entirely
different.  There is no central control.  Even if most internet nodes
use reliable software, there are going to be sites that don't.  No one
has control of the internet.  This is in many ways a good thing, but
it has its bad points.  One of them is that trust only works up to a
point.  A receipting system is one mechanism for reducing the reliance
on trust.


&gt; &gt; Unfortunately such trust sometimes fails.
&gt; 
&gt; And this is where the analogy breaks down.  I believe that trust
&gt; _should not fail_.  Sure, the Internet email system is a "Best Effort"
&gt; delivery, but when you go from something like sendmail which has
&gt; a fairly large track record of reliability (albeit not security :-)
&gt; behind it, to NTMail which, at one point, was reliably losing about
&gt; 10% of my email messages, something is fairly wrong with this
&gt; picture.  The fact that people buy this crap is even more
&gt; disconcerting.

It would be nice to live in a world where people didn't use NTMail
etc, and stuck to MTAs that were reliable, but we can't depend on
this.  We can _encourage_ this, but at the same time we should be
looking at other mechanisms, like receipting.


&gt; &gt; Email receipts don't solve all problems, but they do attempt to
&gt; &gt; detect MTA failure when it occurs.
&gt; 
&gt; No, they don't.  They "detect" either the positive "delivery" of a
&gt; message, or a positive acknowledgement that the recipient has read
&gt; the message (which the user can refuse to send), either message of
&gt; which can fail while on the return path back to the sender.

I used the word "attempt" because I acknowledge receipts won't always
detect MTA failure, but you are much more likely to notice it with
receipts than without.  In my particular case, I was sending email to
a friend and he wasn't replying.  For a couple of months I though he
was either just being a bit rude, or that he was too busy to reply.
Then I sent him a message which was important enough that I was sure
he would reply.  When he didn't I felt very insulted, and was going to
get quite angry at him.  But then the possibility occurred to me that
perhaps he didn't receive the email.  And this turned out to be the
case.  Fortunately I averted a misunderstanding, but if I had been
using receipts the chances are my misconception would never have
happened.


&gt; &gt; Perhaps the present email receipting ideas need redesigning
&gt; &gt; and refining, but the underlying idea is sound.
&gt; 
&gt; It would have to be considerably different from the current
&gt; scheme.  Unfortunately, as a "mail administrator" I've seen
&gt; receipts abused too much to see much positive light in them
&gt; anymore.

Well perhaps my lack of experience, not being a mail administrator,
means I am missing something, but on the other hand, perhaps your bad
experiences are clouding your judgement about the overall principle.
That is, just because things have been done badly in the past, or
because there have been lots of problems with it, doesn't mean the
essential idea is bad.


&gt; [Hmmm, looking at the tone of this message, I'd say I'd need to
&gt; cut back on the caffeine, but unfortunately, with this damn
&gt; 'flu, I have been.  :-(]

Well it's good to hear your side of things.  I started this thread
knowing very little about email receipting.  Now I know a little more.
I still don't know how to use it with exim, procmail and mutt however.
Incidentally, would you regard exim as a good MTA or a bad one?

Cheers,

Mark.
