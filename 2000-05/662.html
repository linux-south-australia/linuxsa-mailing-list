&gt; Of course we do.  ``Everybody'' wants a t-shirt; but not 
&gt; everybody will
&gt; want to buy one.  If there are to be any, somebody will have 
&gt; to take a risk
&gt; and manufacture some number of them in the hope that sales 
&gt; cover expenses.
&gt; Orders up front will help, and perhaps there might be a 
&gt; limited design just
&gt; for the installers and organisers, but remember TANSTAAFL: 
&gt; everybody pays
&gt; for their own shirts.

TANSTAAFL? I'm not even going to attempt a guess...

&gt; An ``event'' t-shirt is likely to sell well, and the more you sell the
&gt; cheaper it's likely to be.  An exclusive design for 
&gt; organisers would give
&gt; a lovely mystique, but does divide the production run which 
&gt; would affect
&gt; the bottom line.

agreed... then again, an extra print on the back of organisers T's wouldn't
actually split the run... anyway... we can figure out those details later...


&gt; This is rather like the penguin badges, which were really 
&gt; neat.  And just
&gt; like those badges we need a design.  If I might suggest: the winning
&gt; designer should get a royalty, which could be in kind, such 
&gt; as the first
&gt; t-shirt produced.  Gotta get those designs happening.

One of the advantages with the Penguin badges was that they are just Linux
badges. There is nothing that ties them to LinuxSA or to any distro or to
any point in time... a shirt that said LinuxSA installfest 2000, &lt;date&gt;
&lt;place&gt; wouldn't be as adaptable to other LUGs, if that's what we want...
But maybe that's not important...

Perhaps if people have ideas for a design, it would be good to air them
sooner rather than later (we could make it a bit of a common theme for any
publicity...)

Ideas (not neccessarily original):

I went to InstallFest2000 and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt ... and root
access. Mwuh hah hah hah ha!

Got root? InstallFest2000

echo InstallFest2000 &gt; /dev/tshirt

umount /dev/mswindows
mount /dev/installfest2000
(and various fsck variations)

Windows98 $xxx (or whatever it is)
WindowsNT4 $xxx
MacOS 9 $xxx
MacOS X $xxx
Solaris $xxxxx
etc
Linux $free
InstallFest2000

Maybe we need to have a space for a sponsor -- someone to pay for hall hire,
bits and pieces, publicity(?), Tshirts, freebies, etc...

Any more ideas?
