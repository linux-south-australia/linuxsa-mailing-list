&gt; The InstallFest sounds like an excellent idea!  You can count me in for
&gt; support, help, co-ordinating, organising and all round enthusiasm.

Cool! thanks to all the other people offering help, too -- I will make a
summary email at the end of the week, describing who has offered to help
with what... Please continue to offer help, equipment, venues, ideas,
sponsorhips, etc...

&gt; As for identifying Linux Guru's... hats are a good idea, however I think
&gt; "InstallFest 2000" t-shirts would excellent.

yes, I like the shirt idea... do we want shirts only for installers, or do
we wnat to sell them to installees (possible Linux Marketing and sponsorship
selling here...) as well? If we want to sell them to installees, we may want
to give them a different colour -- or maybe we want to write "Installer" on
the back of the installers' tshrits...

I do agree with criticism of the two-colour nametag system, but think we
need some way of easily identifying those who are willing and (importantly)
able to help with hairy problems -- maybe we need a master list of skills so
when someone has a problem with getting their samba share to work right, we
can look up on a list (or a white/black board) and find an appropriately
skilled person quickly (first impressions last)...

&gt; What audience to you aim to attract to the fest?  What sort of people do
&gt; you want to cater for?  New users (never used Linux before), Novice users
&gt; (who want to know how to dial up to their ISP or configure their sound
&gt; card)?

I think we want to cater for anyone interested... particularly new Linux
users, and people with some experience of Unix, but no Linux... Universities
will probably give us a big audience, as could people already in the
computing industry -- programmers, sysadmins, IT managers, MCSEs, NCEs, etc,
people who could use Linux in a commercial environment, either in the short
or long term future (ie studnets incluided...  TAFE and schools as well)...
I suppose we really want to get people who will be interested in computers
in some way (it will be of little use to have Grandpa Jo there, who really
should get an iMac or Dell with MS Office and MS IE5, and everything that
makes it easy to do the things he wants to do... write letters to the
grandkids and look up encarta on the web)

&gt;
&gt; I will look into getting some more CD's to give away for the event.

cool cool very cool... Dan & others -- can you help with anything like this?

&gt; Install fests are a lot of fun and a great way for newbies to learn. I am
&gt; looking forward to the event!

myes... me too, and being a newbie to organising things, I'm expecting to
learn a lot in the experience, too... :)

Thanks again for all the offers of help, keep them coming, even if you
aren't sure you'll be useful... we need at _least_ 20 people jsut to help
people install stuff, but more would be much better...

Also, feel free to pass information about this on to other Linuxy people
that you may know (even plain old PC people...) Get them interested in
helping or just coming along... the more the merrier... :)
