Can you please turn off the HTML. I'm sure you're annoying more than just me
on this list.

Hi,

ASF is Microsoft's "Active Streaming Format" streaming video files.  To the
best of my knowledge ASF is only supported by Windows Medial Player, which
obviously won't run on Linux.  A search on google may turn up something that
will play asf's on linux.

If you've installed Lilo on a boot floppy, simply removing the boot floppy
and booting from the hard disk should load windows.  If you really want a
windows option on your boot floppy, you'll need to edit /etc/lilo.conf and
add a new section for your windows drive.  You should make a backup of
lilo.conf before editing it, and ideally have a rescue disk handy.  If you
screw up lilo.conf its possible your system won't boot.  "man lilo.conf"
will give you more info about the settings in this file, and also an example
of a section for booting a dos partition (Windows 9x is the same).  Once
you've made changes to lilo.conf, you need to run "lilo" to re-write the
boot sector and you're done.

Jim.

I am trying to read asf media files. Can anyone help direct me to an RMP
that will do it. I'm running Mandrake 7.0.

I have another problem. I recently installed Mandrake 7.0 on my box and have
win98 on as well. When I created a boot floppy (as apposed to a boot sector
menu on the hard drive for dual boot) the options are LINUX or RESCUE. How
do I add a boot to windows from the floppy.
Linux is at hd6 and windows is at hd1.
Thanks-
Stephen from Canada
