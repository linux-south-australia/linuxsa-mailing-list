&gt; I heard a company is asking its employees to sign a disclaimer saying that
&gt; they wont use thier work email address for personal email etc etc.

It usually isn't a disclaimer, but part of their employment contract.

&gt; 1. Is that Legal?????

You need to ask a lawyer.  There are complex laws covering contract
renegotiations and even more complex lawas covering employment
contracts.

"Personal" cannot apply to some content (such as union notices).

If you are asking "can an employment contract contain a clause restricting
employees from using e-mail for non-company purposes" then the answer is yes.
Equally, a contract can explicity allow such use -- as mine does.

&gt; 2. Is it legal for the company to pry into thier email if they don't sign it

As a rule, yes.

However, if the system administrator doing so views material covered
by the Crimes Act, Medicare Act, ASIO Act, Census and Statistics
Act then they can expect vigourous prosecution and a custodial sentance.
Many policies and government funding contracts also require that some
records be confidential.  If someone has e-mailed those records
(eg: a grades list) and the system administrator read them then
they may cause the disciplinary measures in the contract to be activated.

So a system administrator asked to undertake such a function should
seek written assurance from there employer that such material doesn't
exist on the e-mail system.  If they are directed to do the work, then
they should seek that direction in writing, as it will be a mitigating
factor at their trial.

The employer is also taking a considerable risk that the system adminisrator
will find material that is offensive to them -- let's say a naked woman
or a racial 'joke'.  That employer then faces being bought before the
EEO Commission by the system administrator.

The only solution to this is to rewrite the system administrator's duty
statement.  This has bad PR consequences in terms of job ads.  For
example, the Catholic Education Office advertising that system adminitsrators
should expect to be exposed to ....

Finally, the laws of libel also come into play.  If I e-mail you about Mr C
then I expect that communication to be between us.  If a system administrator
shows that e-mail to person X and person X's view of C is changed, then
Mr C can sue the system administrator for libel.

All this is why telephone company staff have an exemption from lots
of laws under the Telecommunications Act and the staff are also required
to sign a secrecy statement covering traffic over the network.

&gt; Does anyone have any documents or URL's i could goto and read up on this ??

Have a look in the law journals at an academic library.
