Hi Evan,
hope this hasn't already been answered on the list. Apologies if so...

You need to have a look at the .bashrc file in your home directory (bash Run Command file).
This is the file that is run every time a new invocation of the bash shell is started.
This can occur if you open a new terminal window, or run a bash script on the command line.
You can set an environment variable in the current shell you are working in, just by
typing:
export PCSGLIB=$HOME/i686_lib

for example. This will only apply to the shell that you typed this command in, so if you open
another shell, it will not have this environment variable set. However, if you put this export
line in the .bashrc file, everytime a shell is opened it will run the commands in this file,
and hence, set the environment variable for you. The same applies with the path variable, which
you almost got right, just put export in front of it and also stick it in the .bashrc file.

This sort of thing also applies to other shells (Bourne - sh, csh,tcsh, etc.) however, the syntax 
may be different for those shells.

hope this helps, and regards,
Andrew O'C

&gt; 
&gt; I need to setup some environment variables, Im using bash
&gt; of the form PCSGLIB = $HOME/i686_lib
&gt; and then extend my path
&gt; as PATH = $PATH:$PCSGLIB/cmd
&gt; 
&gt; I looked at the .bash_profiles (I think thats its name) but am unable to do
&gt; what I want
&gt; I suspect it's my lack of understanding of the environment as a whole
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone please explain how this stuff hangs together and how I can
&gt; achieve what I want
