Quoting Jeff Borkent &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jeffrey.borkent@adelaide.edu.au">jeffrey.borkent@adelaide.edu.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I\'m wondering if anyone knows of any problem in 
Mandrake Linux 7.0 that
&gt; causes the machine to flood the network with 
broadcasts pretending to be
&gt; every ip on a subnet. That is the same MAC but 
different ip\'s. It got so
&gt; bad that the University network admin at Flinders Uni 
shut down the entire
&gt; subnet.
&gt;
&gt; I\'m hoping like crazy that it might be software or 
even hardware rather
&gt; than an attack or compromise.
&gt;
&gt; This is important as the machine in question is one of 
three front ends
&gt; into an extremely large beowulf cluster. ( used for 
computational chemistry
&gt; )
&gt;
&gt; Any knowledge wil be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Yes we\'ve looked at log files and cannot find anything 
yet but we will look
&gt; harder and deeper if this request for comment comes up 
blank.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in Advance

I realise that this is hardly an ideal solution, but I 
personally don\'t have this problem.

You could try sticking it on another subnet, in it\'s own 
network (itself and a hub) and run tcpdump to try and 
find what types of packets are being sent. There are 
also a great deal of other free tools for network 
analysis (like iptraf - which will be good for this 
testing).

Try disabling absolutely everything in the Linux kernel 
that is not necessary (assuming you haven\'t already). 
There may be a bug or just something which reacts badly 
to something else.

I found a cool remote management tool (sorry, but I 
forgot the name) and it tried to ping every machine on 
the network. It was multi-threaded and could easily kill 
a network in no time. Is it possible that something like 
that has accidentally been installed?

I apologise if you have already tried these things, or 
if I was absolutely no help whatsoever.

Hope it helps,
Matt
