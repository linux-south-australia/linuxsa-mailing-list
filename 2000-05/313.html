&gt;
&gt; Has anyone heard any more? Does anyone know of any plans
&gt; to help linux in SA? Does anyone have any projects they
&gt; are working on themselves in the same field?

I've been resisting this, but what the hell...

Their performance during the IETF was miserable.

The background:

  Thousands of Internet specialists come to Adelaide after a
  decade of lobbying.  A few of these people are billionaires,
  quite a few are millionaires, even more make recommendations
  to CEOs, all of them are designing *the* driving force behind
  IT at the moment.

  Unlike most other IETF meetings, this one isn't bankrolled by
  a big IT firm.

The strategy:

  You'd think the government might shout them dinner, buy a few
  conference tickets and schmooze.  That way, the next time
  they are in the US giving a pitch about locating activities
  in SA they will have meet the people and have an advantage
  over competing groups.

The actuality:

  The government didn't want to know about the event when planning
  first started.  The Internet wasn't trendy a decade ago.

  Because the convention center is on North Tce, some government
  people ask what is going on.  They approach the organisers --
  is there some sort of dinner the minister can address?  Well
  no -- no one is paying for one and networking people are pretty
  self-sufficient and are happy enough to test out the local
  restaurants.

  They arrange a meeting with the Chair of the IETF, which is at
  such short notice that it is squeezed in on the afternoon of the
  last day of the conference.

  So they get to meet one person.  The thousands of others --
  the CEOs, the venture capitalists, etc -- they don't meet.

A pathetic performance during a golden opportunity.

I've been involved with international IT conferences held in
Queensland, and their governement is just so much better at
handling the schmoozing.  And then they follow up.  And they
handle the tourism possibilities.  And they help the conference
organisers rather than becoming an obstacle.

I haven't had one report of anyone from the IETF conference
being sent info on why they should consider locating IT
enterprises in SA.  So not even basic folow-up has occurred.

There wasn't even a tourism liason person at the conference
or at the conference hotels.  Yet we had people wandering
about Adelaide on the weekend before and after wondering what
to do.  And they spent serious money -- one group chartered
a jet to fly over Uluru departing and returning to Adelaide.

I'm glad to see IT jobs anywhere in Australia, so I'm not
annoyed at Queensland's people doing a much better job.

I am annoyed that my state taxes are paying for a group that
does a much worse job than could be expected.
