Hi
&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; Yep, I know this has been said for some time, but now the
&gt; mainstream are recognizing that MS should bring out
&gt; Office for linux.
&gt; This, in my opinion, will be the absolute worst-case
&gt; scenario for those who live and breath the linux life-style.
&gt; I reckon a lot of coders will turn off their computer
&gt; (no matter what `uptime` says) and take up another hobby,
&gt; like cooking or crochet.
&gt; Then people who cheered the Halloween leaks and the
&gt; Windows refund will be wishing they could turn the clock
&gt; back to the happier days when the suit-less talented
&gt; hobbyists ruled.
&gt; Someone should register the name "Linux Office 2000" before some
&gt; monopoly or other announces it!

Why should the fact that MS Office (or any other M$ product) existing
for Linux be a problem. It is a free market place, and it will shape how
popular it is.

Given that part of the success of M$ products derives from its market
domination of OSs it will have its work cut out for it to penetrate the
non-Windows market. It is unlikely to be a fdree product, and its
development costs will be significant, and thus the product won't be any
cheaper than the exisitng ones.

It also doesn't have the secret windows API to take advantage of for
speed, so it will have to write a tight stable application which will work
in a variety of configurations, and window managers, etc.

If it can achieve all this at a reasonable price, then I say this is a
good thing, we have another alternative for our desktop, it means I could
go to an organisation which is Windowes based with my Linux box and
exchange data with my CowOrkers with no problems.

Just my 2c woth :)

cya
