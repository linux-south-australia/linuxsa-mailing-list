People,

This is an announcement that I don't like to make, but in the same way I
am glad it is happening.

As of the end of this month I will be no longer in Adelaide.  I am moving
to Melbourne to do some contracting.  

Four years ago, when I started LinuxSA, I wanted to create a group that
would teach people something on a regular basis, and a mailing list that
was open to all and useful to a lot of people.

I feel that LinuxSA has become just that.

Although I will be taking leaving the organiser role that I have shared
with Geoffrey for most of the last four years, I am sure Geoffrey will 
continue to operate LinuxSA as we have in the past.  

What I would like the group to do as a whole?  If people want LinuxSA to
grow then stand up and be counted.  Many hands make light work, and so 
if there is anything that you think you can do then contact 
<A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A> and make a suggestion.

It has been a great four years, and I am sure that LinuxSA will continue
with great growth and will continue to be a valued part of the South 
Australian Linux community.

Warmest regards to all,

Matthew Tippett
LinuxSA Founder and exiting Co-organiser.
