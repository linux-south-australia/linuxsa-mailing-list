Hello Tristan

Just been attempting to set up Poptop.
Had some problems when trying to connect from the client side.  The server side seems
to be set up ok.
In your /etc/pptpd.conf file, what did you define as the local/remote ip addresses?
I'm a little confused as to what these refer to.  My understanding is the local remote
address=the address assigned to the server by the ISP, and the remote addresses are the
ones you want to assign to the clients.
Basically, because we havent got a static IP from the ISP yet, we were trying to set up
using my normal account.
The disadvantage is that the server gets a dynamic address this way, I put a range
(203.28.1.1-100) in pptpd.conf to try & counter this but still had no success.  Could
ping the client PC, but the client PC couldnt ping me.
Any ideas?

Thanks

&gt; &gt; Hi all
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just wanting to know if any of you have had much to do with setting up VPN through
&gt; &gt; a Linux server using Windoze clients?
&gt; &gt; I'm looking at trialing this scenario using a RH 6.2 server & giving VPN access
&gt; &gt; for our Teamware Office (groupware product) installation.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Any ideas, pitfalls, recommendations would be great.
&gt;
&gt; The linux pptp (PopToPop I think they call it) works really well, and
&gt; was very easy to install, however I understand pptp still has security
&gt; issues with authentication.
&gt;
&gt; I'm currently looking at the FreeS/Wan software, with a PGPNet client,
&gt; but it's a little more complicated (ok, lots), to setup.
&gt; <A HREF="http://jixen.tripod.com">http://jixen.tripod.com</A> has some examples.
