&gt; ADVERTISING
&gt; We can place posters in bookshops and computer stores.  I suspect we will
&gt; be able to get free publicity in The Advertiser, and maybe from a radio
&gt; station.  We should keep our message simple, but we must make it clear that
&gt; in order to install Linux we will probably have to remove Windows (to make
&gt; space.)

And universities, especially CS/IT departments/schools/organisational
units.

Most first year CS students won't know about linux, but will love the idea
of being able to do their assigments at home.

At least that has been my experience with first and second year CS/IT
students.

These are also the IT managers and developers of the near future, as well
as potential linux contributors.

&gt; What do we do if we make a profit?  I think we're aiming for a balanced
&gt; budget, and if there is a surplus there are a few obvious ways to
&gt; distribute it:
&gt; 
&gt;   1. Share it amongst the volunteers.
&gt;   2. Put it in a cookie jar to fund cookies for LinuxSA meetings.
&gt;   3. Donate it to charity.

Depends on the amount.

But anything more than about $100 I think it should be donated.

Ideally, donate it to a free software organistion.
My personal recomendation would be the FSF.

Or maybe the Apache project.

But I think the FSF is more worthy as they probably have less corporate
sponsors than most free software and have been doing it a long time.

Help perpetuate the tools we use and love.
