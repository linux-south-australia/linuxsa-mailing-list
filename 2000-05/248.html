Hi all,

Thank you to those who responded for my cry of help in
setting up my PPP and figuring out WINE. The result... I
changed my crappy old KTX ext 336 modem for a Auslinx
redback336E and it now works fine. As for the proxies in
netscape, once connected to the ISP, the proxies was
automatically setup by the connection (?).

As for WINE, I got quark xpress to run, photoshop and the
other pre-press apps I used, but I'm not impressed with the
way the handle, I'm going to try VMware soon, see how that
goes.

OK... After countless nights upto 2am, I have learned a
heck of alot about Linux, but after reading through all the
books I've got, reading the how-to's and man's, I can not
figure out how to access my internal IDE ZIP drive. All the
books/man's refer to a parallel or SCSI external drive. Has
anyone configured an internal IDE ZIP? if so, could you be
kind enough to let me know how you did it.

One other thing, I've been playing around with samba, to
try and hook up the other win98 machines on my LAN. It all
seems to work, except when the PC's go to log in as their
respective user name and password, a message comes up
saying invalid password. I've played around with the
smbpasswd file (putting NO PASSWORD and changing the
passwords within the file). I just can't seem to get my
head around this one, can anyone suggest anything?

I am using Caldera OpenLinux 2.3, the eth0 is all setup and
the linux box can read the win98's C-drive, and the Win98's
can see the linux and the user folder, public folder and
the printer attached to the linux box. 

If anyone can help out with the ZIP prob or with sorting
out the password probs, it'll be greatly appreciated... I
look forward to going to bed at a reasonable hour some
night soon!!

Cheers


Carl
