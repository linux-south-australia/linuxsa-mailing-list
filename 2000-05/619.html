Dear all,

I work at a university student computer dropin centre and my boss wants
to build an inhouse proxy server due to the fact that we are starting to
get billed greatly for our web usage by the university.

The boss (who is a bit of a one eyed Microsoft user) wants to put in an
NT proxy server whilst most of the employees that have had anything to
do with this sort of thing say that Linux is the way to go.

I need some UNBIASED, level headed facts and truths to put forward so
that the box becomes a LINUX one. The Boss's main argument is that as
soon as Linux becomes used in 60% of businesses for this task, then she
will think about it, but not before. The Boss says they will stick to NT
as they believe support is far more widely available.

The boss hasn't touched Linux or any sort of Unix type environment
before and I think it might just be a case of fear of the unknown.

Any comments along the above line would be greatly appreciated
especially from Glen Turner, ITS people or anyone that has done
something like this on a commercial level.


Kind regards

Darryl J Bosch
