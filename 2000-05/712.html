Thanks to those who replied to my question recently re losing sound
mixer settings through reboots.

I have researched the problem more thoroughly, found a solution, defined
the extent of the problem and got myself comfortable again. In case
anyone else faces this, here is the synopsis:

System affected: Manduck Linux 7.0 (possibly others)
Symptoms: mixer settings return to defaults when system rebooted.
Note:- this is not in itself a problem, it is the way things are. It is
perceived as a problem because other Manduck releases and RatHead
releases have had a mechanism for saving/restoring mixer settings
through a boot cycle.

I discovered that the init scripts as provided have been set up to use a
little prog 'aumix-minimal' to save/restore the current sound settings
to /etc/.aumixrc. Specifically /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit restores the
settings by reading them from that rc file, /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt saves
the settings there. Manduck 7.0-2 by default does not install
aumix-minimal, so that even though the init scripts are set up to do
this functionality there is no prog on board to run to do the work. I
have not hunted down aumix-minimal, there are some ugly stories on the
aumix site about resources being hogged, and it all sounds a bit
kludgey. My own personal solution is to use 'mixer', another little
simple proggy downloaded from the net. I am using /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt
as the vehicle to save the current settings in /etc/.mixerrc, and
/etc/rc.d/rc.local to restore them. If anyone really wants, I can post
those files somewhere, but really it's just some very simple scripting.

So, if anyone complains to you that their system is setting sound
settings back to defaults at reboot, ask and the solution is at hand.

Bruce
