Hi,

&gt;&gt; that you have JavaScript (a widely used security hole) enabled.  And
&gt;
&gt; Could you please quantify this? How is Javascript a security hole?

&gt;Good point.  JavaScript permits the web page designer to control your
&gt;browser much as if you were controlling it.  There should be limitations
&gt;to what can be done with it, but I'm skeptical and don't trust it.  I
&gt;observe that browser scripting languages are the enabling technology
&gt;behind the ILOVEYOU attack.

JavaScript (and other browser scripting languages) are generally "sand
boxed" so that they can't touch the local file system (and on windoze, the
registry, etc).  Nor can a scripting language affect any processes except
the browser.

ILoveYou (and also Melissa, etc) exploit holes in Microsoft's "sand boxing"
which allow scripts running in their email clients (or on the Windows
Scripting Host) to have access to the email address book, and create and
send email.  If Microsoft was to deny scripts access to the address book,
most worms like ILuvYou, etc simply would not be possible.  FWIW, M$ has
released (or will be releasing soon) a "security patch" for Outlook which
will force a script to seek permission from the user before it can gain
access to the address book. 

And of course, none of this affects Linux users, because I don't think any
Open source developer is stupid enough to provide scripted address book
access :)

Jim.
