<H1>How big will InstallFest be?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I've been assuming that InstallFest would attract about 50 people, but it
seems this is way too conservative.  Everybody who I talk to has said that
we should be expecting hundreds of people.

We need to work through the logistics.


GOAL
What are we doing?  We are running a one or two day event to which people
can bring their computers for us to install Linux, Star Office, PPP and
some games.  Our audience is home and small business.  We're not aiming to
teach MIS managers how to configure and administer AppleShare on Linux.


ADVERTISING
We can place posters in bookshops and computer stores.  I suspect we will
be able to get free publicity in The Advertiser, and maybe from a radio
station.  We should keep our message simple, but we must make it clear that
in order to install Linux we will probably have to remove Windows (to make
space.)


LEGAL & SECURITY
Before we touch any computer we need a signed waiver, absolving us from any
damages.  We ARE going to delete Windows...  We will also need security at
the venue, to make sure that all equipment brought in and out is properly
accounted for.

We also need insurance.  You never know what might happen, or who might try
to sue, so this is a wise precaution.  Being a loose group of enthusiasts,
with no official structure, no management committee, no paid up members,
and no articles of association, we don't legally exist.  If somebody were
sued it would be the volunteers at the event, or our insurers.  Although
insurance will be a big expense it will be necessary.


NETWORK
We've had a number of generous offers of free internet connection,
including one for multi-100mbps.  We haven't yet accepted any of these
offers, and indeed I'm not sure how to choose.  I know who made the first
offer, and I know who made the best one.  Should we accept offer number 1?
Should we accept the offer with of the biggest bandwidth?  Maybe the one
from the cutest operator? :-)

I don't think we are in a position to accept an offer for 100's Mbps.  How
we would take advantage of it?  We'd also need to borrow OnRamp, or
microwave, or something like that, and I don't think that we could get that
laid on for free for just one or two days.  We'll need the venue to have a
number of telephone lines, so a couple of MPPP connected modems or three is
realistic.


BOOTHS
We will have costs for this event, and there will be businesses wanting to
hawk their wares.  We should make a limited number of booths available, for
a fee, to book shops, computer retailers, ISPs, consultants, etc.  This is
our best opportunity to cover costs.


VENUE
How many people will be at the venue at any time?  How long will each
visitor stay?  We're going to need bench space for computers, and we'll
need power, and I think we'll need a number of telephone lines.  I now
think we should plan for a peak of 50 concurrent attendees.  We'll need 20
helpers, so that's a hall with benchspace and power for 50+ computers.
This sounds large.  Assuming our internet comes in via telephone, let's say
two lines.  In addition we should have at least one so that people can test
their dial-up connection, but these are minimums.  Let's try to find a
venue that can supply three telephone lines plus whatever we need for our
event internet (say five or six lines in total.)



STAFF
We'll need volunteers to install Linux, to help with security, to
evangelise, and an event co-ordinator.  We probably cannot have too many
installers, after all if we do have too many they can always stand around
talking about their favourite operating system, but if we have too few then
the event will be a failure.  Maybe fifteen installers?  We should have at
least two people on security, and I'd prefer more.  Let's figure on twenty
people.


FOOD & DRINKS
I think we can leave this for a third party, and sell them the rights too!
Most venues have a catering department.


EQUIPMENT
We'll need some machines on hand for downloading drivers, reading CD's,
burning CD's, showing how great Linux can be, and so on.  Who has a Linux
machine that can burn CDs, which they would be happy to bring?  We'll need
a network, which means ethernet cards, a hub, cables, and so on.  We'll
need power boards -- lots of them.  How many machines do we need?  I'm sure
if smile sweetly at Compaq they'd be happy to lend us some gear.  What do
we need?


MERCHANDISE & GIVE AWAYS
The major one is an event t-shirt.  Dare I say that we still need a design?
What other things can we sell at the event?  We already have some
give-aways promised to us, namely some Red Hat CDs.  We should approach Sun
for some Star Office disks, and also the other Linux distributions for
their CD's.  Anything that people can take with them will help make the
event memorable.  Ideas, please!


BUDGET
What do we do if we make a loss?  We should able to arrange the event so
that we don't actually loose money, but it might happen.  I think
merchandising is the riskiest factor, because it needs to be made up front
and we don't know how many we'll sell.  Given that we already have an
underwriter for t-shirts the risk is low.

What do we do if we make a profit?  I think we're aiming for a balanced
budget, and if there is a surplus there are a few obvious ways to
distribute it:

  1. Share it amongst the volunteers.
  2. Put it in a cookie jar to fund cookies for LinuxSA meetings.
  3. Donate it to charity.

We need to decide before the event.
