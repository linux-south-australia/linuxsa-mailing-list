&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, it will be that easy.
&gt; Since they are not ATX motherboards (AT) then the power 
&gt; supply is simple and
&gt; the wires to supply the motherboard are just power... there 
&gt; are no signaling
&gt; lines like ATX power supplies.
&gt; The only problem is getting hold of a AT style connector used 
&gt; to plug into
&gt; the motherboard.
&gt; 
&gt; MWP
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; anyone know anything about connecting multiple mother boards up to a
&gt; single
&gt; &gt; power supply? We have a need (read: desire) to run quite a few PCs,
&gt; without
&gt; &gt; video, keyboard, mouse, floppy, hard drive, etc (ie a mobo 
&gt; with CPU, RAM,
&gt; &gt; NIC and I/O card), but don't really want to fork out for a 
&gt; power supply
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; each one, particularly as power supplies tend to be capable 
&gt; of 150 to 200
&gt; &gt; Watts, and a plain mobo such as the above would be unlikely 
&gt; to consume
&gt; more
&gt; &gt; than 30W maximum (they're only 486DX2/66s -- yes, from 
&gt; Bryan Wetton). I
&gt; &gt; initially thought it would involve nothing but a bit of 
&gt; soldering and some
&gt; &gt; spare mobo power supply connectors and some wire -- simply 
&gt; connect them
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; up in parallel... however, a friend indicated to me that it 
&gt; was likely to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt; a little harder than that. I don't know exactly what it 
&gt; would involve, and
&gt; &gt; he didn't give me any specifics, so I was wondering if 
&gt; anyone here had
&gt; done
&gt; &gt; anything of the sort, and would care to enlighten me?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; rr
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; PS I'm not really into fur seal trading... at least, not much... :)
