Yeah! An InstallFest.. 

  Russell&gt; Hello fellow LinuxSAers...  

Hi Russell..

  Russell&gt; * A venue -- must be big enough to hold &gt; 100 computers
  Russell&gt; with parking for &gt; 100 preferably has a network connection
  Russell&gt; available (the faster the better, although a phone line to
  Russell&gt; connect a modem to would suffice) even better would be a
  Russell&gt; switching infrastructure...  handy to have a place where we
  Russell&gt; can have coffee, pizza, etc.  also a whiteboard or five
  Russell&gt; wouldn't go astray...  preferably has &gt;100 desks and &gt;200
  Russell&gt; chairs, otherwise we need them too.

I can suggest 'Endeavour College' at Mawson Lakes, opposite UniSA.
Hiring/booking the place shouldn't be a problem.. (I can do that)
and so far, they have been very supportive of community events.

Network access may or may not be a problem bepending on how fast Agile
works at getting their 10Mb microwave link into the levels.

  Russell&gt; * desks and chairs.

They will have this!

  Russell&gt; * Pizza, coke and coffee.

The bulk ordering of a pizza lunch (with people pre-paying and getting
a colored 'dot' on their nametag) worked really well last time.

  Russell&gt; Oh, I also thought that maybe we could aim to do a smaller
  Russell&gt; event, but make it a regular thing... perhaps
  Russell&gt; bi-monthly... that makes it a smaller job, and gives us an
  Russell&gt; ongoing installfest habit... but it could be too much
  Russell&gt; commitment to do it 6 times a year... what do people think?
  Russell&gt; Geoffery suggested we have a variety of Fests --
  Russell&gt; ConfigFest, SecurityFest, MailFest, etc...

What about a 'Newbe-fest' on the fortnights between LinuxSA nights.
Just somewhere where first timers can bring their machines for an
installation or tweeking or just getting the basics of linux.
You could offer helper a free feed of pizza, with a gold coin
donation from the participants. (Just need a suitable place with
power..)
