&gt; I don't think that this is quite correct. As far as I know, "Power Good"
&gt; comes from the PSU to the motherboard, and is supposed to go +5V when *all*
&gt; PSU voltages have stabilised. This signal, coupled with some simple logic on
	[...]

Mostly off-topic, but hopefully a useful comment:

While working with all sorts of embedded systems and hardware designers 
over the years, I've found that people tend to get the "logical" signal 
and the "physical" signal sense confused, and that if you take a 
moment to be careful in this area, then the confusion level can 
drop appreciably.  

In this case (signalling power available) the chances of being confused 
are very low, but in other cases it's a real issue.  For example, is 
"Power Good" an active high or an active low signal?  Does +5V mean 
power's okay or power's lost?  Sometimes designers might supply 
some power just so that an alarm can operate when everything 
else goes dead.  For example, the "idle" state with RS232 is 
+15V (or any positive voltage +5..+25V).  Active-low signals 
are common in many systems.  

I recommend that you separate the logical signal from the physical 
encoding, and use the terms "asserted" and "deasserted" when talking 
about the logical signal, and then state "active high" or "active 
low" to describe how the signal is physically encoded.  This 
makes it much easier to say what you mean, as otherwise the 
asserted/deasserted state and the physical high/low sense get 
tangled up quite easily.
