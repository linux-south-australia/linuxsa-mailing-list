Subject: Re: Citrix Metaframe for UNIX


&gt; Prolly the best thing is to create a filter which would junk attachments
&gt; with extension .vbs and replace it with a message to the user.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone got any ideas ?!?!
&gt;
&gt; Rob 'The complete sendmail numpty' Wuttke
&gt;
&gt;

This is stretching the original topic to breaking point, but I will keep it
the same in order not to break the thread (which I heard someone on the list
say once gave the archival search engine a hard time. Is this true, or is it
acceptable to change the subject line when the conversation gradually strays
of the original topic - ie can we say "Sendmail: Was - Citric Metaframe for
UNIX" ?). Anyway:

Sendmail 8.10.x has a new experimental feature which is not well known
called "milter" (Mail fILTER). You can hook into the various stages of a
sendmail transaction at almost any point from the tcp connection onwards,
and do various powerful manipulations of the messages. Mail filters are
built as dynamic librararies (shared object) files, so there is no need to
patch sendmail in order to use them.

I am waiting for a Perl interface, which was hinted at by ActiveState and
Sendmail Inc in a joint press release a few weeks ago, as seen here:

<A HREF="http://www2.sendmail.com/news/pr/release/2000041001/">http://www2.sendmail.com/news/pr/release/2000041001/</A>

Unfortunately at this stage it would appear that both of these companies are
guilty of, to put it politely, "ambitious anticipation" of the product, as
apart from the press release there is not any demonstratable product that I
can see (in terms of even an Alpha Perl module). Please correct me if I am
wrong and someone has seen some code come together, and I am not being
pushy - I am glad someone is doing it, and thankful that it will be
available as (presumably) GPL software. I still think it is remarkable that
products like Sendmail and Perl are given away so freely.

I believe that this will really help push Sendmail into new areas, as
combining the proven Sendmail MTA engine with power of Perl's text
manipulation will open up quite a few opportunities, including:

1 .. Ability to parse mail messages as remove arbitrary attachments, such as
VBScripts, JPEGS with &gt; 80% flesh tone (joking !) and AVI files (come on -
when was the last time someone sent an AVI file that had a legitimate
business use, unless you are in the "Worlds most amazing sex fetish and/or
people crashing/falling or generally making idiots of themselves" video
business.

2 .. Ability to truly integrate with Anti-Virus scanning programs. At the
moment Sendmail (generally) must be patched to integrate AV software. Some
people may point out AMAVIS or procmail filters, but these are not really
applicable when running as an intermediate MTA between other mail systems
(for example as a main mail router for an organisation)

3 .. Better anti-spam recognition using Perl regexp's to determine what mail
may be "suspicious" and flagging it as low priority, or deliverable to a
different folder.

4 .. Ability to take archival copies of mail as they are passing through the
MTA


And the list goes on. I am sure other people can think of many applications
as well. Whilst it is true that mail filters can be written in any language,
the ability to write them in languages like Perl will probably see a large
number of fairly useful modules become available fairly quickly. And whilst
some of the above can be done with other tools like procmail, some of them
may be "better" as part of the MTA (ie use the right tool for the job).

Note that the above can only apply to unencrypted email passing through a
gateway, so if you really want to send that trojan vbscript program to a
friend you probably can. However if your friend is cluey enough to know how
to install a digital certificate and publish a public key, they might be
smart enough to not open an executable attachement anyway..

Anyway this ramble was for two purposes:

1 .. To agree with the above author that I think a filter is a good idea. If
executable attachments are identified, I think that at the very least the
user could be made to jump through a couple of extra hoops if they *really*
want to run them, and a Big Fat Warning attached to the mail message. And
perhaps auto-partitioning the network port that the PC is attached to
immediately after successful delivery.

2 .. To let people know about the Sendmail milter feature, as it seems to
have gotten very little press to date.

Regards,

Andrew Speer
