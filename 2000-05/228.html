Generation Linux May 2000 has come and gone.  Overall the event was a HUGE
success!  The response from the children, parents and teachers was very
positive.  The attendance numbers were excellent, the lab was full for
most sessions.

More than a few people were surprised at how easily the children took to
Linux.  The children were enthusiastic and had fun!  I was amazed to see
one boy go through the first part of the installation in less then 5
minutes.

I am happy to say that Generation Linux was rewarding and the results well
and truly exceeded my expectations.

The photos are at:	 <A HREF="http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~sara/gl/images">http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~sara/gl/images</A>

Lee Anderson (journalist from LinuxWorld) flew out and did an interview,
he took pictures of the event and also participated by helping the
children.  He will be doing a full write up about the event.

Conrad Parker (president of the Sydney Linux User Group) gave an excellent
talk to the children about Free Software in Science.

Thanks to LinuxMall.com we had 1000 Linux CDs to give away and 250
penguins. The penguins arrived Monday, this was just in time for me to
give the penguins to the children who did the Monday sessions (actually
the first session missed out!)  The children loved them!

I spoke to a number of school teachers and they are keen to run more
sessions in the future.  I will put the documentation and Linux installation
instructions (which are specifically designed for children) on the web so
that other people can run their own events.

Thanks again to LinuxMall.com for the penguins and the CDs!
