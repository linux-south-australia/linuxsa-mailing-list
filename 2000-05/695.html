&gt; Yes, I also would be willing to contribute to this extent.

very cool

&gt; I reckon we can probably russle up a couple of hubs, a pile of BNC
connectors,
&gt; cables (10Base-T and 10Base-2) etc.

also very cool

&gt; A couple of things to consider:
&gt; 1) I seriously doubt that we'll need 100 desks and 200 chairs.  It's
possible
&gt; that 100 people may turn up to the event, but hopefully not all at once.
(I
&gt; assume it'd be a most-of-the-day thing).  But what we will need is a *lot*
of
&gt; extension cords and power boards.

it's really hard to know... it's be handy to know how many came to the last
one (anyone remember? -- Geoffrey or Matthew?)... becauce then we could
multiply that number by X where X is a real number between 2 and 10... :)

&gt; 2) I'm sure this isn't a show-stopper, but just something to consider:
What
&gt; happens when someone brings in their machine that has 3 months of work on
it
&gt; that hasn't been backed up and something goes horribly wrong and they lose
all
&gt; their work?  Can we get people to sign a disclaimer before we start?
Something
&gt; to the effect of "I have backed up all my data and will not hold LinuxSA
or any
&gt; of the event participants responsible for any data loss etc".

Absolutely! We need a disclaimer -- this isn't an urgent one, but we will
need it by the event... any lawyers could help here... there is one that
exists on the web somewhere (IIRC it's on the InstallFest HOWTO or
www.installfest.net (or .org) somewhere). It needs to be short and sweet,
understandable to the normal person, unambiguous, and make it OK for us to
blow up someone's hard disk and monitor... (BTW: we will also need detailed
pre-installfest instructions to tell people how to prepare -- back up data,
etc... AND we will need instructions for installers on how to go about
things -- a checklist : check if data backed up, check if hardware is
compatible, check if monitor is multisync, etc etc etc)

&gt;
&gt; I like the idea of installers having t-shirts and accepting orders for
t-shirts
&gt; on the day.

I like this also, but getting the tshirts to the people could be a hassle...
unless we make them come to LinuxSA meetings? :)

&gt; Or we could allow pre-ordering of t-shirts when installees register
&gt; in the RDBMS.  ;-)

I like this also, but

&gt; Was the plan to charge an entry fee, or get sponsorship to cover costs?

pre-registration with sponsorship would be ideal... realistically, we may
need to charge a "Pizza and Caffeine levy"... It would be good if the
installfest itself was free though...

&gt; In any case, there must be much pizza and caffeine.

yes, much.


&gt; And we'll probably want a couple of copies of Partition Magic.  Could be a
good
&gt; candidate for donation from a computer store.  Or is everyone happy using
fips?

someone who knows more than me should answer this :)

We may need to be partitioning multiple drives at once, so one licence will
have to be enough.. we will also have to be extra careful about licencing
issues with it -- not leaving it on people's computers, etc...
