&gt;  &gt; Why?
&gt; 
&gt; Because of what Sun has which Linux doesn't have:

All true.

You can see evidence of this in another way: Suns Enterprise family of
systems are eating into IBM's mainframe market bit by bit. Whether facts
bear it out or not, IBM's 390 series of machines have a very strong
reputation for providing ultra-reliable transaction processing, and
customers pay a huge premium for this. But with the high-end Suns getting
more high availability 390-like features all the time this market is
looking less secure for IBM. 390s don't run Unix natively, although via
two or three different mechanisms just about any Unix or AIX software will
run on them.

A common external analysis of this (which might not be at all accurate)
goes like this: There are early versions of Linux out for the 390,
developed pretty much entirely by IBM. This means that hardware with all
these reliability features can now run Linux, so once certain features
appear in Linux to better support a highly available environment the
overall package might fend off Sun's charge into 390 space. The reason is
that Sun's hardware isn't as suited to the application as IBMs, and with
Linux all the Unix advantages can be realised.

Is is true at any rate that IBM are aiming for Linux support on every
system they make, they've stated this at very high levels on numerous
occasions.

It is also true that there is quite a lot of serious work to be done
before Linux is well-prepared for this sort of environment. At the moment
Linux (like Unix) is not a predictable operating system, and people who
run 390s are paying a lot of money for what they believe is
predictability. I am using the word "predictable" in the technical sense,
meaning that one can be very certain a computer will continue to respond
in the expected manner as many factors change in a very large and
extremely high-volume environment. (A Linux print or web server is usually
as predictable a thing as you are likely to find, in the everyday sense of
the word!)
