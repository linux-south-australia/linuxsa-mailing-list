Hi.

This might not be the right place to ask such questions, but it happened
when I was using linux so I'll ask. If anyone can point me in right
direction please do! I realy want to recover data even if it costs me $$$.

My HDD did wierd things and lost all data.

I was editing a text file on a FAT16 when got this error:
	hdb: irq timeout: status=0xff { Busy }
	ide0: reset: success

And everything seemed to work, so I continued working. About 10 sec later:
	hdb: irq timeout: status=0xff { Busy }
	ide0: reset: success

I saved work, copied entire directory into another partition of same
drive. Also FAT16 and rebooted, but:

while rebooting, drive was doing same things but much more often now. and
intead of "ide0: reset: success" it'd say something like "Busy" or so.

After reboot nothing changed, drive was goint nuts, but this time it
started cliking like it does when it spins up after stand-by mode. And
after reboot all partitino messed up.

HDD setup:
hda no problems.
hda1 /
hda2 /home

hdb 6.4 Gb SeaGate.
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hdb1   *         1        39    313236    6  FAT16
/dev/hdb2            49       790   5960115    5  Extended
/dev/hdb3            40        48     72292+  82  Linux swap
/dev/hdb5            49        61    104391    6  FAT16
/dev/hdb6            62       272   1694826   f0  Unknown
/dev/hdb7           273       531   2080386    6  FAT16
/dev/hdb8           532       790   2080386    6  FAT16

Only hdb1 was ok. The rest was gone. I recreated all partitions exactly as
they were before, and:

hdb1		ok
hdb3		haven't looked at it yet. Running without swap now.
hdb5		badly messed up but worked.
hdb6 and hdb7	totaly gone
hdb8		perfectly fine.

I tried disk editor under dos to look at phsysical data on hdb6,7 but to
my surprise I found that from track 1 there was plain text of the same
text file that I was editing. As I randomly poked different sectors in
hdb6 they were all filled with with that text file or directory entries
from the directory that I copied.

I did "dd if=/dev/hdb6 of=/mnt/f/hdb6.img" and it copied ok, no
errors. But all it seems to contain that same text, spread over 1.5
Gb. Maybe more. I did not check hdb7 much. hdb6 was the only vital one.

After all this. I noticed something I never noticed before. When botting
linux I get messages:

hda: WDC AC2540F, ATA DISK drive
hdb: ST36531A, ATA DISK drive
hdc: no response (status = 0x80), resetting drive
hdc: no response (status = 0x80)
hdd: no response (status = 0x80), resetting drive
hdd: no response (status = 0x80)

those no responce things never appeared before. Now they appear if ide has
no drives on it. If at least one is connected it does not say that.

Now some of you gona scream "you @#$%@#$%" but I gotta say it cause this
might be relavant to why this happened.

That hdd has 4 position for jumber (master/slave/etc) and one of them is
not labeled. Cause in slave there is no jumpers at all, I thought, that
that positino is not used and stuck that pin in there so I don't lose
it. Then I put drive into removable rack and inserted it in while computer
was on. (!@#$%@#$^#@%^ &gt; /dev/null) No OS was loaded, it was going through
Memory test etc. When it came to check HDD (set to AUTO in BIOS) it
detected them all fine and worked.

That's all I can think of that could have caused it. I was pluggin drives
in and out for a while now. I thought that if no OS is loaded, it should
be OK, and for long time it was, untill...

It seems that somehow about 2 or so Gb of data got overwritten by same bit
of info that I saved. How it could happen, I don't know. I did not notice
any major disk activity. On other hand, when writes are sequential, it
worx very quetly.

I heared that Cops do some tricks by moving heads slitly off the track to
read "spill". Thus reading overwritten data. Maybe I am talking rubbish.

Anyway, If anyone can recover it for me, or tell me who can. I am prepared
to pay. (Well, not unlimited of cource, but name the price)

PLASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!

I think I told u everything, but if not, tell me what to supply.

Eugene
