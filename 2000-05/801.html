big-ass summary email coming, but I thought I'd reply to this email
specifically...

&gt; Well, might as well start asking some more installfest questions...
&gt;
&gt; 1) Should this be an Installfest only, or combined
&gt; installfest/configfest?
&gt; ie a few people I know say "Yeah, I can install, but I can't setup
&gt; [something]". Should we use this event to help them as well?

IMHO, yes, definitely... Any other opinions?

&gt;
&gt; 2) We've had suggestions of an RSL Hall (Robyn Manning) and Endeavour
&gt; College at Mawson Lakes (Paul Schulz).  Any other offers?  Are you two
&gt; ok to check out availability and pricing and conditions (and power
&gt; sockets) for a Saturday in early September?

Or late August... or late September :)

&gt; 3) Do we want a Saturday?  Or a Sunday?  Or even a Tuesday? :-)  [I'd
&gt; prefer a Saturday personally].

Saturday would be the most obvious day, but if we want to go a whole
weekend, this is conceivable...

&gt; 4) Who wants to come and be an installer?  If we do a configfest
&gt; simultaneously, who wants to be a configurer?  Who can do both and eat
&gt; pizza and drink coffee simultaneously.  Who has a cappacino(sp?) machine
&gt; :-)

all good questions... I've had lots of offers of help from individuals... If
someone wants to organise some sort of web page to register installers and
installees (and configur[ee|er]s) that would be dandy...

&gt; 5) What Linux companies are willing to sponsor?  How and with what?  CDs
&gt; are an obvious choice.  How about footing the rent bill?
&gt; Signs/Posters/Credit Card size recovery boot disks/Tuxs/Door Prizes etc
&gt; :-)  Thankx Rebel (aka David) for the T-shirt offer.

So far, I've had contact from Rebel, a few other ISPs, and some other
companies. I'm planning on contacting Dymocks in Rundle mall, to see if they
want to set up a Linux/Oreilly stand... (any objections?)

&gt; Let's get the ball rolling...  Richard, what are your thoughts?

more coming...
