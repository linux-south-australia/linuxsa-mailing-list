I get these netbios-ns probes all the time.
These quite often come from a few asian countries
whose webmasters never reply to my hacker reports.
I assume that as in the case of the chernobyl virus,
asian countries were particularly vulnerable because
they don't seem to take computer security very
seriously. It may also be that the language barrier makes
it difficult for the relevant info to travel there.

Either way, I get so many netbios-ns (TCP and UDP port 137)
probes, I just ignore them now.

But of more interest to linux users (esp. red hat derived
distributions) would be the equally frequent port 98
scans. These happen a couple of times a day on my IP address
spaces. Most of these are from Korea, in my experience.

The problem is that these are not at all innocent.
There's apparently a highly virulent DDoS program
being developed (Mstream - see
<A HREF="http://packetstorm.securify.com/">http://packetstorm.securify.com/</A> ) which has been found
on linux machines. I don't know if they use port 98 to infect
people's machines (linuxconf).
But according to

<A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000502-000005.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/000502-000005.html</A>

this Register article, and the notes:

<A HREF="http://packetstorm.securify.com/distributed/Mstream_Analysis.txt">http://packetstorm.securify.com/distributed/Mstream_Analysis.txt</A>
<A HREF="http://packetstorm.securify.com/distributed/mstream.txt">http://packetstorm.securify.com/distributed/mstream.txt</A>

it looks like it's red hat linux which is the vulnerable machine this time.

I think it's odd that although almost no virus (in the sense of
code infecting applications of boot records) ever seem to
infect linux machines, they do seem to have a particular
vulnerability to infection with DDoS zombies.

Not that I know anything about network security at all,
but if I were an RH linux server operator, I'd firewall
out port 98 immediately, and check that Mstream has
not yet infected your machine.

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS. I'm trying to give up writing a PS at the end of 
every mail, but on the subject of why it is bad to have your
whole web-site downloaded, there are two main reasons --
if a personal robot is downloading it, probably the user will
either just skim through 0.1% of it and discard the rest, which
is very wasteful, or else they'll put it up on a site and stick
advertising all over it and make money out of my good name.
[cough, cough.....]
