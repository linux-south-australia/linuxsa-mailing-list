&gt; Having maintained backups in the past through a haphazard copy to a spare
&gt; machine technique (hey! at least they where backups).  I have recently
&gt; acquired a DAT tape (as the email goes to press I am having the first
&gt; complete system backup that I have had in *MANY* years.
&gt; 
&gt; Now for those of you who use Linux in a more formal environment, I am
&gt; interested in canvassing opinions as to what is a good backup configuration
&gt; for Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; For the interim I will probably just do a rolling 4 week with the 1st week
&gt; rotation rotation (those who have done backup configs before will understand
&gt; that :).
&gt; 
&gt; But I am very interested in knowing what is considered best practice using
&gt; Open Source software?
&gt; 
&gt; Looking forwards to all sorts of interesting replies.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew
&gt; 
&gt; PS for a MUA, I have recently changed from elm to mutt.  It is well worth
&gt; the move!!

[Sorry if this post lags the rest of the discussion a little...
I read LinuxSA via the digest.]  

Basically, backups is a risk/expense trade-off: How much expense 
are you willing to incur doing backups, versus what cost or 
risk is there if you lose data?  

My very, very first job was "Assistant System Administrator" at 
Austek Microsystems, with someone named Richard Sharpe as my 
boss.  One of my main jobs was to manage the backups for the 
company.  Austek was designing custom VLSI chips and developing 
VLSI software tools in-house, so protecting the work of the 
large engineering team was very important.  

At Austek, we took a snapshot monthly of all the disks to tape, 
and those snapshots were performed with the system shut down to 
a single-user state, so that the tape image was capable of 
recreating a working, bootable disk if the data had to be 
restored to a new drive.  The snapshots were held for at 
least a year before being reused, and occasionally 
(quarterly?) a snapshot was put aside and never reused.  

We then had weekly incremental backups, which captured all the 
changes since the previous weekly backup (or the previous 
monthly snapshot).  These tapes were stored off-site, and 
rotated in a fairly long cycle (9 weeks or thereabouts, I 
think).  

And finally (in the backup regime) we had daily incremental 
backups, which were stored on-site.  Again, a  fairly longish 
rotation cycle was used -- the dailys covered around 4 weeks 
of data before being reused.  

A listing of each file backed up incrementally was held 
on-line in a disk file, including modification times, so that 
if we had to retrieve a file, we could search for the file 
in the listings instead of having to reread each tape.  

So if someone had finger trouble and deleted something, we could 
probably get it back off the incrementals or the previous full 
snapshot.  Up to a day's work might be lost in some 
circumstances, but that was a reasonable risk to take.  

If a disk died, we would restore a monthly shapshot, then restore 
the weeklys up to the current week (maximum of 4 weeks), then 
restore the dailys up to the current day (maximum of 4 weekdays).  
This seemed the best trade-off between effort to perform the 
backup and the hassle of reloading if there was an error.  

In addition to backups, we also had an archive facility, using 
a different set of tapes (which were duplicated).  Archiving 
data made a huge difference to the amount of stuff that was 
written to the monthly snapshots, and helped ease the pressure 
on disk space.  

Okay... so much for past practice.  Now for a bit of a look at 
the present:

You need to backup to defend against:

        1. Finger trouble.  An installation screws something up, 
                or you broke or deleted an important file.  
                You need to restore the file off of a backup.  

        2. Media dying, or suffering an accident.  I've had a 
                disk head crash only last month, so believe me, 
                it happens.  Or perhaps there might be a fire 
                which char-grills your disk drive.  

        3. Damage from outsiders, including viruses.  

Your backups should be onto removable media, either a tape, a 
CD, or perhaps a pluggable IDE drive.  At least some of your 
backups should be well away from the rest of your system, 
in case of big events like fire.  Tape is good, as it's 
fairly cheap and compact.  Burning the occasional CD is 
okay, but perhaps best left for archiving rather than 
for backups, since you can't reuse CDs (?? are the 
rewritable CDs much cop, yet?)  

For tapes, turn off data compression NOW: otherwise, if your 
backup is written as one big file to the tape, and an early 
block of the tape is unreadable, the rest of the tape is useless.  
(use mt(1) to control the data compression setting).  

You could get away with incrementals from one machine to 
another, or perhaps even one disk drive to another, but 
this carries some risk that an incident might take out 
the backups as well as the original.  There's a lot to be 
said for having the backups completely away and off-line 
from the originals.  

As part of setting up a new disk myself in the aftermath 
of the failure, I've set aside a partition as an "archive" 
partition.  RPMs and other sources downloaded from the 
net get stored in this partition, so that I can easily 
exclude these from the incremental backups if desired.  

Incidentally, I asked Glen Turner on this list a year or so 
ago how the big boys do backup.  His answer was to use 
dual-ported SCSI drives in a RAID configuration, then 
add your backup drive as a shadow of your working drive, 
let the system make the backup drive become a complete 
shadow of the original, then take the backup drive offline 
and store it in a safe place.  

Finally, Ross Williams of Rocksoft has much to say on this 
subject, including the question of guarding against 
creeping corruption that otherwise might slowly infitrate 
your backup copies until undamaged originals are lost.  See 
the Rocksoft site, "The Tao of Backup":

        <A HREF="http://www.rocksoft.com/taobackup/">http://www.rocksoft.com/taobackup/</A>

which includes discussing basic and advanced backup issues.  
For example, the web points out that you should encrypt your 
backup tapes so that your intellectual property remains 
secure even if a tape gets stolen.  

cheers,

Brenton
