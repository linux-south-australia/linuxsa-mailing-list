I think the use of receipts should be dictated by need and reason and not by
whether it peeves the recipient off. They do have their use and in some
environments can actually be considered worthwhile. (e.g. ISO 900*
environments)

I personally have them on by default for email I send from work as it
provides another bit of info to provide an audit trail and to help in
tracking whether imnportant emails have come through.  It is annoying to
turn them off so I tend to leave them on. 

Sorry in advance to all those that get the hated [Y/N] question.

In a corporate/business/[high QOS] environment Receipts definitely have
their place. Sending mails to mailing lists and other non-critical emails
doesn't really warrant receipts, however most email clients don't have the
option to easily set a "do not send delivery requests to these addresses
(e.g. insert &lt;linuxsa&gt; here) rule. This does tend to mean that if you have
receipting on it tends to stay on.

I personally keep every single one of email's and all my delivery receipts.
I do use delivery receipts quite regularly, and they can be very useful e.g.
debugging sendmail/majordomo configs the other day. 

Admittedly my email store is getting a bit bloated from all this but I much
prefer this to deleting and or archiving my emails, as I regularly end up
dredging old emails from years ago to find solutions/answers to things I can
no longer remember. 

I do run on an Exchange server ( which surprisingly works well and reliably,
even with my bloatmail mailbox) and I did look at using it to start a sort
of personal solutions library to reduce this email clutter only to discover
that writing a custom server side exchange rule is like making pigs fly
backwards through a blender and miss all the blades. 

My largest hassle with receipts has been in getting my filing rule right for
returned receipts. This can a bit of fun as different mailers all send them
back in different formats. I have it err on the cautious side and
occasionaly end up with my inbox cluttered up with system receipts due to
oddball variants. (I got about 20 wierd ones about an hour ago). Hardly
affects my inbox as I currently have 3500 unsorted emails in my inbox
currently anyway.

Or perhaps people could not send them in the first place.  It
depends on which problem you're trying to solve.  Trying to
solve the problem at the mailing-list end is a solution to
the wrong problem.

&gt; And while it's at it, it could
&gt; send a message to the offender telling them not to ask for receipts
&gt; when sending to a mailing list.  Is this feasible?

How many people post HTML to lists, despite being asked not to?
One of the lists I subscribe to has this clearly appended to
each post, yet people still do it.  Why?  Most likely because
they're unaware that they're doing it.

I was having problems with an _entire domain_ (government
department) that used malformed Return Receipts, and it took me
months to get in touch with someone who would even respond to
my posts (mails to postmaster@ went unanswered).  In the end they
considered it not a problem, because no-one else had complained
about it, then kept right on doing it.  I still get about 10+
bounce mails from this domain a day.

&gt; Thanks for pointing out the pitfalls.  I can see the potential
&gt; problems with receipts.  I can also see the potential benefits.

There aren't that many.  As Glen pointed out, without them being
signed, how do you know if they are legitimate?  As a _diagnostic_,
they may have some benefit.  As a guarantee of successful delivery,
you would have to define "delivery" (sendmail.org goes into this
in some depth).

&gt; This points out the need for receipts or some similar idea.  As much
&gt; as you try to design reliable MTA software, the successful operation
&gt; of the internet relies to a great degree on trust.

So does banking.  When you deposit money into a bank, you're hoping
like hell that they remember this particular transaction.  You're
relying upon the systems that they have in place so that, come the
end of the day, your account still balances.

&gt; Unfortunately such trust sometimes fails.

And this is where the analogy breaks down.  I believe that trust
_should not fail_.  Sure, the Internet email system is a "Best Effort"
delivery, but when you go from something like sendmail which has
a fairly large track record of reliability (albeit not security :-)
behind it, to NTMail which, at one point, was reliably losing about
10% of my email messages, something is fairly wrong with this
picture.  The fact that people buy this crap is even more
disconcerting.  Dan Shearer's talk on Email Vendor's standards
compliance was quite interesting in this regard.

&gt; Email receipts don't solve all problems, but they do attempt to
&gt; detect MTA failure when it occurs.

No, they don't.  They "detect" either the positive "delivery" of a
message, or a positive acknowledgement that the recipient has read
the message (which the user can refuse to send), either message of
which can fail while on the return path back to the sender.

&gt; Perhaps the present email receipting ideas need redesigning
&gt; and refining, but the underlying idea is sound.

It would have to be considerably different from the current
scheme.  Unfortunately, as a "mail administrator" I've seen
receipts abused too much to see much positive light in them
anymore.

[Hmmm, looking at the tone of this message, I'd say I'd need to
cut back on the caffeine, but unfortunately, with this damn
'flu, I have been.  :-(]
