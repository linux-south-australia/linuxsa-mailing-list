&gt;     Just had a query from someone in Perth regarding mail on an M$
&gt; Exchange server.  He's wanting to be able use Linux on the network but
&gt; has to be able to retrieve local mail from the Exchange server.  He's
&gt; not sure what they're using as the protocol, but the server is
&gt; configured for SMTP, MS and X400.

Fetchmail can handle both POP3 and IMAP4, but the Exchange server may
not be set up to allow it.  This usually needs the relevant connector
installed, thus the SysAdmin must be amenable[1] to this.

[1] Someone in the python newsgroup wrote a "screen scraper" that retrieves
his email over the web from Exchange and injects it back into his local
server.  When asked why, he told the group that his SysAdmin is apparently
a BOFH, and disabled access to IMAP and POP when he found the user using
non-Microsoft products to access email.  I think the SysAdmin needs a visit
from Dan Shearer and have a lesson on "Open Standards" with a 4by2 (not that
Dan does this sort of thing, mind you, but I think the market is there :-).
