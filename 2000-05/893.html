 &gt; Package management is one of the most importan things about an OS, when

I believe there's a role for a company like LinuxCare, or an organization
like Linux International here:  I think it'd be a good idea to convince
someone like SGI to liberate "inst", their package management tool.

Why?  Well, because inst includes the following features which Open Source
package management lacks:

    - Standardized namespace for packages, which treats each package-group
      of installable software as a "subsystem" (i.e.: entity of
      functionality) which is a member of an "image" (i.e.: entity of 
      purpose), which is a member of a product.  So, for example, 
      base_os.sw.named and apache.doc.admin_guide might represent names of
      two packages, the first one would be the nameserver software packaged
      as part of the base OS, the second one would be from the Apache
      product's documentation subset, specifically the administrator's
      guide.  Having a standardized namespace for all software packages from
      all vendors is a big win.

    - Each package has built-in versioning:  when you try to install a
      package, inst knows whether the software you're installing is an
      upgrade or downgrade to software you've already installed.  Furthermore,
      it can be told what to do with config files if you're upgrading 
      across version compatibility boundaries (for example, it'd know that
      if you upgrade base_os.sw.named from a version which uses named.boot,
      it'll need to do something clever to produce a named.conf instead).

    - Each subsystem has built-in knowledge of other subsystems which are
      necessary as dependencies (from the same product or other products).
      Furthermore, each subsystem knows about minimum and maximum versions of
      other subsystems it's prepared to work with, and can mark
      INcompatibilities as well as compatibilities (for example, if you're 
      installing a package which depends on XFree86, it can have fore-knowledge
      of the fact that it'll require AT LEAST v3.3.3 of XFree86, but nothing
      more recent than version 3.3.5.

    - Each subsystem can optionally have multiple actual versions inside the
      inst package, where each version can be for a different hardware type.
      For example, consider a single distributed version of apache which
      has built-in binaries for Intel, Alpha and PowerPC, and which "knows"
      which one to use when you install the software.  This idea could
      also be used to extend the concept to multiple operating systems on
      the same architecture, which would be great for enterprise-class
      installations with a collection of heterogeneous platforms where 
      version consistency is desired.  SGI uses it to install the right
      platform type for the various CPUs they support, and also to ensure
      that, for example, you don't inadvertently install device driver 
      support for RealityEngine2 graphics when you only have Extreme graphics
      hardware on your computer (imagine a world where you type 
      "install xfree86" and it figures out whether you need 3Dfx stuff, 
      Intel or PPC binaries, it'll check to make sure you don't already have
      applications on your system which depend on the old version of X you've
      already installed, etc.  Magic, eh?

    - A C library is provided which can be used to provide low-level software
      installation services for GUI or character-based user-interfaces
      (for example, SGI's "inst" command line tool and their "Software
      Manager" Motif GUI tool)
      
If someone could convince SGI to liberate the source code to this tool,
it'd be a big win for package management on Open Source operating systems.
