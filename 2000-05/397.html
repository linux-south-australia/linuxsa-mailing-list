We have to start somewhere.

  &gt;&gt; So, is anyone game to try to educate a polly or two?

I wouldn't mind sending a condensed version of this discussion (in
particular Glen's opening statements) to my local poly and seeing what
responce I get back.  I have written to him in the past, and it
will get refered to the government department it concerns, who will
then send out a broshure or two.

If such a letter though was received by several polititions at once,
it might trigger a different responce.

  Matthew&gt; I\'m game. Although I\'m not quite sure that politicians
  Matthew&gt; will be able to help as such. I don\'t believe they have
  Matthew&gt; anything to offer us. I do believe that marketing South
  Matthew&gt; Australia as a good place for I.T. based businesses will
  Matthew&gt; help our cause (ie, getting a job and *not* having to move
  Matthew&gt; to Sydney or Melbourne). I don\'t believe we have *any*
  Matthew&gt; hope in educating the abovementioned polly or two.  Just
  Matthew&gt; looking at the Censorship stuff that they tried, they
  Matthew&gt; aren\'t interested in understanding the way things work at
  Matthew&gt; all. If we target the people who have what we want, I think
  Matthew&gt; we have a chance.

  Matthew&gt; Maybe I\'m wrong.....

  Matthew&gt; Matt
