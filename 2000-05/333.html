Earlier in the month Matthew Geddes posted an enquiry regarding
Linux solutions in Adelaide.

I dislike receiving sales style responses on email lists as much as anyone.
However, Matthew's request was pretty specific.

Shaw Solutions is a software developer in Adelaide and ALL of our
applications are available to run on Linux.  The applications we have
available are comprehensive and include :-

o PROMADIS Financials,
o PROMADIS Distribution,
o PROMADIS Manufacturing,
o PROMADIS Transport,
o PROMADIS Courier,
o PROMADIS Medical,
o PROMADIS Hospital,
o PROMADIS Raven (Registry System for Births, Deaths and Marriages),
o PROMADIS Property Management, and
o PROMADIS Support Services.

All of these systems are integrated, fully functional corporate systems,
support multiple companies, multiple banks, multiple cost centres,
comprehensive on-line General Ledger, comprehensive management tools, and
much more.

The development team is located in Adelaide and the application is able to
be fully customised to suit specific needs.  The application can be
deployed across the Internet, operated as "green screen", via telnet and
much more.

We can build, supply and support Linux based servers.  We also develop web
based applications (mostly using PROMADIS).

The bottom line is that in answer to the email, yes we have the
applications, yes we can provide a full range of services and yes we can
help.

Sorry for the sales'y response, but it does answer the question.

&gt;Hi guys,
&gt;
&gt;I get a few people asking about linux related solutions in Adelaide. I'd
&gt;love to do it myself, but I really don't have the time. What kinds of
&gt;services do people provide? If you don't mind my passing you details on
&gt;on the occasions when people are after stuff, let me know what you do.
&gt;I'd also like to know out of interest.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Matt
