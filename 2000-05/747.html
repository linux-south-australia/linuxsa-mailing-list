&gt; &gt; Netscape cannot get out to the internet. The dial up, logging on, is all
&gt; &gt; working ok (kppp). PPP is started. But Netscape has stopped talking to
&gt; &gt; it. It just says something like host not found, or xxxx.net.au not
&gt; &gt; found. I have looked at a number of files without any luck
&gt; &gt; ....etc/hosts, etc/network, etc/resolv.conf. PPP just sits there waiting
&gt; &gt; -waiting -waiting for some data.

as David Newell pointed out, check your DNS.

next tim eyou have an internet related problem, try pinging. Its (one of)
the simplest internet things you can do, and it's broke then your links
broke. However, you should ping an IP address, not a machine name. If
you can ping an IP address, but not a hostname, then you have DNS
problems.


Okay, and now for the rest:


&gt; It's not entirely helpful BUT I am subscribed to about 5 different
&gt; general e-mail lists:
&gt; 
&gt; * PPP problems
&gt; 
&gt; Mainly caused by kppp. I don't care what KDE enthusiasts say...avoid it
&gt; like the plague. It causes unknown, unfixable, stupid problems..
&gt; 
&gt; * Netscape problems
&gt; 
&gt; Netscape itself on linux, is, essentially broken. Most Netscape problems
&gt; are induced by Java (that idiotic programming language which claims to
&gt; be universal but is really a Windows programming environment that's
&gt; somehow been ported to Unix). You don't seriously think Sun believed
&gt; they could make money out of the OpenSource community do you?


OHMIGOD. Davey babey, pull your head in dude. Sure Java is broken in
places, but I think you'll find its mostly to do with the VM on that
platform.

Also, you can quite fairly blame microsoft when it come to Java *script*.
They broke the standards, and are still not compliant (well either IE or
Netscape is non-compliant, but they certainly aint the same)

&gt; 
&gt; In other words:
&gt; 
&gt; i) DROP kppp imediately
&gt; 
&gt; This will probably fix your problem

This is probably true, but you'll have to replace it with something, and
since linux is trying to be warm and fuzzy, alot of people are not going
to replace it with good old "ifup ppp0".

&lt;rant&gt;
The new trend to be like microsoft and have a follow-your-nose GUI wizard
to do things is not something I'm terribly happy with. The only saving
grace is that these utils still work with plain text files, so you can
still "fix" things if you need.

I understand that these GUI utils are a Good Thing(tm) since it allows
more people to do more things.
&lt;/rant&gt;

Having said that however, I'm using kppp at the mo ;) BUT I also have the
ability to massage the scripts to do more things, like bring up and down
IP chains with interfaces.
