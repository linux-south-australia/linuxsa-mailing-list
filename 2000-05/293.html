Oops.

Try again...

If some of you applications aren't able to run, (most likely if your system
has run out of processes (incidentely a banner ad on slashdot pointed to 
this question (and it's five answers) 

  <A HREF="http://www.questionexchange.com/servlet3/qx.answer.showPreAnswer?position">http://www.questionexchange.com/servlet3/qx.answer.showPreAnswer?position</A>=4&exp_id=guest&qtn_id=15466

So long as you have one running you can still do pretty much anything that
ps, top and friends can do.

The /proc file system is a wonderful place :).  It allows you to look
inside the kernel.  So for your problem you can use internal shell
commands to see what is happening.  If you can run ls and cat then
you can find almost anything.

The most useful things are 'ls proc' to give you a list of all the 
pids that are running.  

Pick up one of the pid's and go to that directory.  All the 
files there tell you something about the process.  Most important for
you would be 

  /proc/xxx/cwd and /proc/xxx/exe which point to what is running and where.

The other entries are documented quite well in 

  /usr/src/linux/Documentation/proc.txt

(assuming you have a kernel installed.)

&gt; creep up, but I couldn\'t tell what was eating up 

BTW looking at the 's it looks like the web mail client you are using (IMP)
is thinking that it needs to escape text that might be mis-interpreted.

Regards,

Matthew
