&gt; I was asked to do a "What you need to know about performance
&gt; disk I/O" session.

:)

&gt; When is the next meeting?

16th of May, 2000

&gt; How much time do I have?  I'll then allocate the standard
&gt; one minute per slide.

Budget for about 1 hr (ish).

&gt; How many people usually attend (I'll print the slides as
&gt; there's a lot of numbers).

40-50 (or more)

If you provide the slides to <A HREF="mailto:g@netcraft.com.au">g@netcraft.com.au</A> they will end up
on the linuxsa web pages.

&gt; Could someone let me know -- I've written the slides but
&gt; I need to dig around my back shed for some ancient disks
&gt; and tapes.

:)  I can bring a couple of QIC 120 MB tapes :)


&gt;  - MagicPoint -- the input format sucks, a step back in
&gt;      time to the age of FORTRAN punched cards where you
&gt;      had to put content in the right column and line.
&gt; 
&gt; Unless someone suggests something reasonable, it's down to
&gt; SliTeX or MS PowerPoint.

I tend to just use HTML (with a little bit of PHP magic).  I just 
have 1.title, 1.body and so on and the PHP picks it up and does it
for me.  I even have a little script to convert the PHP slides to 
individual HTML files.

(Of course you have to click on a '&lt;' and '&gt;' to move from slide to
slide - but hey it is widely readable :).

&gt; Not just Linux but The World needs a half-way decent presentation
&gt; source format for developing presentations that have content rather
&gt; than graphics.
&gt; 
&gt; PDF is the ideal output format.

Of course if you end up doing the content in something that has the
notions of pages, you can print it and use ghostscript (ps2pdf is 
the command) can do convert your presentation to a pdf file that
you can use to present using acroread.  Not ideal, but the output
is ideal :)

Regards,

Matthew
