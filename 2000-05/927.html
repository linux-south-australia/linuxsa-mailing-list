Hi Tim

As far as the sound goes you could check out www.alsa-project.org they 
call themselves the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture and they have 
info/drivers on lots of cards.

&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; I am having some problems with RH 6.1 on a new Acer TravelMate 730TX.
&gt; 
&gt; 1) X
&gt; 
&gt; Seems to be fine.  The video card runs well off the Mach32 server and the
&gt; screen configures easily.  No probs here.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Mouse
&gt; 
&gt; It is a Synaptics PS/2 Touchpad.  On the first install, this was detected
&gt; and configured, and worked fine both in X and the vc's.  However, it no
&gt; longer works, after reinstalling.  When I try it (both in x and with gpm)
&gt; it skips wildly all over the screen with just the slightest touch.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Network Card
&gt; 
&gt; I think this is a fairly standard card.  It's detected during install and
&gt; already has a line in /etc/conf.modules:
&gt; 
&gt; alias eth0 eepro100
&gt; 
&gt; But when init reaches the stage of starting interface eth0, it just locks.
&gt; I had to reboot into single user mode and remove the conf.modules line
&gt; before I could boot into runlevel 3 (albeit with a bunch of /etc/sysconfig
&gt; modem error messages due to the changed conf.modules).
&gt; 
&gt; 4) Sound Card
&gt; 
&gt; is an ESS Solo-1 PCI AudioDrive.  This seems to be detected upon the
&gt; install and by sndconfig as a ESS Technology | ES1969 Solo-1 Audiodrive,
&gt; and it has an entry in /etc/conf.modules:
&gt; 
&gt; alias sound esssolo1
&gt; 
&gt; However when Linux boots, it starts squealing at me in the init and
&gt; doesn't stop.  It is a high pitched beep that does not stop.
&gt; 
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; That's about it.  Has anyone successfully set up an Acer laptop before?
&gt; Any suggestions would be greatfully appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
