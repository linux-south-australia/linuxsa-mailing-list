Quoting Darryl J Bosch &lt;<A HREF="mailto:darryl.bosch@adelaide.edu.au">darryl.bosch@adelaide.edu.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; I need some UNBIASED, level headed facts and truths to 
put forward so
&gt; that the box becomes a LINUX one. The Boss\'s main 
argument is that as
&gt; soon as Linux becomes used in 60% of businesses for 
this task, then she
&gt; will think about it, but not before. The Boss says 
they will stick to NT
&gt; as they believe support is far more widely available.
&gt;
&gt; The boss hasn\'t touched Linux or any sort of Unix type 
environment
&gt; before and I think it might just be a case of fear of 
the unknown.
&gt;
&gt; Any comments along the above line would be greatly 
appreciated
&gt; especially from Glen Turner, ITS people or anyone that 
has done
&gt; something like this on a commercial level.

I believe you can set up squid as a transparent proxy 
too, which would allow you to use the proxy without 
needing to change the workstation configuration.

We are running a single squid proxy (which also acts as  
a DNS, DHCP, router, firewall, test NT PDC and 
Fileserver) on a machine that MS Proxy server would not 
enjoy.

Your boss should know that most proxy servers in the 
world (I think it\'s around 75%) are running squid. I\'m 
sure that many of these are Linux based. I would also be 
happy for her (or anyone else) to contact me for 
specific answers to specific questions.

Hope it helps,
