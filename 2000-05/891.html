I didn't see the last one...

&gt; Package management is one of the most important (and potentially,
&gt; expensive) things about an OS, when considering its use in commercial
&gt; and/or large environments. I have some ideas I've formed through practical
&gt; experience over where things are, and I'd be interested in other peoples'
&gt; comments on what I'm forgetting or don't know about, which is probably a
&gt; lot.

I think you need to define what you mean by "Package management".
Looking further down, I don't know whether I should criticize what you
say or not, since I'm not sure how you use the term.

&gt; Something that is clearly not good is having perhaps 10 different
&gt; package specifications for things like GNU fileutils, which are
&gt; required by all Linux and BSD distributions.

BSD doesn't use fileutils.  It's not even available as a port,
apparently, one of the very few ones which isn't.  Note also that
those packages used as part of the base BSD system, such as GNU
binutils, aren't handled by this method: the base system is installed
differently, primarily by make(1).

&gt; pkg
&gt; ---

I got about this far and said "He said free OSs, not just Linux, but
he's omitted the BSD packaging systems".  I didn't recognize the name:
I don't know anybody who calls it "pkg".

&gt; I know the least about this, not being very experienced with BSD. It
&gt; is a very simple system, with a basic list of installed packages in
&gt; /var/db/pkg and commands like pkg_add and pkg_delete which handle a
&gt; package description file that is bundled with a tar.gz of the
&gt; binaries to be installed.
&gt;
&gt; pkg is not ported to any other OS that I know of.

In fact, pkg_add and friends are closely related to the System V
packaging tools, so closely that I don't understand why they're not a
complete clone.

&gt; There is good documentation, although being so simple not a lot is
&gt; needed. A good thing about pkg is that the collections of ports are
&gt; maintained in a consistent way and there aren't that many ports
&gt; collections.

Hmm.  There are about 3,300, which is a fair number in my book.  We
use the term "Ports Collection" to refer to the entire collection of
3,300 ports.

&gt; The rules for making a package are very clear. I don't _think_ there
&gt; is too much in the way of a framework for digital package signing
&gt; but it is such a simple thing to do that I presume I'm wrong :-)

We have MD5 signing on all ports.  I'm not so sure about the packages.

&gt; pkg appears to have similar base capabilities to apt with respect to
&gt; location and retrieval methods, but much less flexibility with the current
&gt; number of methods and ability to add in new methods [this might be wrong,
&gt; corrections welcomed]. So pkg too can look for a package on the CD ROM,
&gt; not find it and then go to a web/ftp site.

I think you've missed the point that pkg_add and friends are just one
relatively small part of the ports collection.  They only handle
binary packages, and it's perfectly possible to install all your BSD
ports without ever using pkg_add.  By far the most important part of
the ports framework is the Makefile.  In general, if you want to
install a third-party (i.e. not BSD) package, you use a port.  This
contains those files required to locate the source archive and build
and install it.  For example, the FreeBSD port for bash-2.04 contains:

$ ls -RFC
CVS/            Makefile        files/          patches/        pkg/

./files:
CVS/    md5

./patches:
CVS/            patch-ab        patch-ad        patch-af
patch-aa        patch-ac        patch-ae

./pkg:
COMMENT         CVS/            DESCR           PLIST

I've omitted the CVS directory contents.  The important things here
are:

Make<A HREF="file:">file:</A> Includes the real ports Makefile.  The main contents of this
          file are info on where to get the source archives, a
          post-install script, and generic information such as what
          kind of configure scheme it uses.

patches/: Lists of diffs which should be applied before installing.
	  I'm a little suspicious of the number here; I'll probably
	  try feeding them back to Chet.

md5:	  The MD5 signature.
COMMENT:  A one-line description.
DESCR:	  A more verbose description.
PLIST:	  "Packing list".  A list of the files which get installed,
	  may also contains shell commands for execution on install
	  and uninstall.

One of the Makefile targets is "package", which makes a binary package
suitable for installation with pkg_add.

&gt; Overall
&gt; -------
&gt;
&gt; Although there are a lot of problems to solve when designing packaging
&gt; tools, I think the big issue is maintaining the package archives. The fact
&gt; that the program "alien" works very well in translating between the major
&gt; Linux package formats proves that this isn't the major problem.
&gt;
&gt; In the archive maintainence area the apt and pkg approach is pretty good,
&gt; with apt being quite an advance on the ports collection concept in that it
&gt; is designed to be easily extended. The user can specify an arbitary number
&gt; of repositries and their location, and OSs that have base packages in
&gt; common just fit into the hierachy very neatly.

I don't really understand what you're saying here.  If you mean the
BSD Ports Collections, they are very much set up for independent
repositories.  A lot depends on the definition of the term "archive
maintenance".  The Ports Collection is maintained in a CVS repository,
but the archives themselves are spread around the Internet.
