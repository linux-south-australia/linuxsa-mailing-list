&gt; That may be a problem.  But it doesn't alter the fact that Dan is
&gt; right: if you want to persuade them to do something, you must first

&gt; that makes it all the more important to try to influence them.

Now is as good a time as you get to influence a state polly or a
political party (it is at party level that policy is made after all).

The next state election can be called anytime from January next year,
with a window of opportunity of about a year. There are a number of ways
that you can get attention. I suggest finding out who the IT portfolio
responsibilities fall to within the major parties and make a written
representation to each, inviting them to come and listen to members at a
Tuesday meeting. This assumes that enough members are willing to have a
meeting hijacked by politics, and that there are enough members who care
enough about the issue to want to use this group to make a difference.

I can help with contacts within one political party, but I caution that
the group should be aware of the danger of being aligned with one party
against the rest. This can happen without your knowledge or assent if
you don't set ground rules up front and if you let go of the steering
wheel momentarily. Political lobbying can be fun because it can be
dangerous. Done thoughtfully it can also be very productive.

Having chased work interstate twice in the last decade and having had to
do all sorts of work, including production-line factory work, to keep
mouths fed while persuing IT jobs in SA, I support the tone of the
thread to date.

So, is anyone game to try to educate a polly or two?
