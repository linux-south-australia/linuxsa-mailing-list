Thanks Guys!
Fixed! In the end it was a simple matter of changing the video card memory
that Linux saw then using manual Xconfiguration to up the res under 32bit.
Working perfectly! :-)

**start rant***
Just as an aside.... I dont know how many of you have looked at or installed
Corels Linux ( I dont like to diss, Corel have tried to make a User , read
Microsoft, friendly package and succeeded in parts), but the way in which
the libraries are situated and linked throughout the filesystem doesnt seem
to match what most applications are looking for, PLUS it doesnt allow for
upgrading of libraries when I tried to fix the problem (because the library
placement is hashed). Add this to the KDE debian binaries installer, thats
supposed to make it all that much easier (and which cant find the libs to
link to!), and your left with an 'almost' useless system on which its
'almost' impossible to install anything but the simplest apps on......In the
last 1/2 hour since I fixed the res problem RedHat has allowed me to install
all the apps Ive tried with NO grief...nada...zip. Speaks for itself really
:-)

This leads me to think that sticking to some kind of library placement
protocol could really go a long way in the opening up Linux to a wider user
group. Maybe most distributors do and Corel wasnt thinking, bad move really
since theyve got themsleves the title of the new user friendly dist.
**end rant***

&gt; Hi Kym
&gt; Try running "XF86Setup" which will give you a graphical configuration
&gt; option, or "Xconfigurator" which will give you an ncurses-based
&gt; configuration (the command line version of a GUI :-)
&gt; Occasionally XF86Setup will not start due to your video not being
&gt; detected properly or something, but I have had few probs with it.
&gt; (By the way, i guess you've tried the monitor on another PC or under
&gt; Windows (dont try that at home though! ;-) to make sure the monitor is
&gt; not at fault?)
&gt; Good luck
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi! Ive been trying to install RH6.2 after getting tired of having to
&gt; &gt; rewire libraries in CorelLinux and now have a flickering monitor. I
&gt; &gt; can see the screen, which starts at a high res, looks like at least
&gt; &gt; 1280x1024, but the flicker's going fritz my brain. :-) During the
&gt; &gt; install, which runs beautifully (and I might add kicks Corels user
&gt; &gt; friendly) Redhat finds my monitor as a DDC, which it is, but hashes
&gt; &gt; the scan freqs. Seems to flip the horizontal and the vertical, and
&gt; &gt; when I manually change the rates as given in my monitors manual, I
&gt; &gt; still get the flicker. Ive tried all kinds different freqs. Im
&gt; &gt; thinking its either 1) the monitors preset timing, or 2) the DDC (plug
&gt; &gt; and play) that Red Hat matchs to the monitor is a tad off. Is there
&gt; &gt; some way I can fix this while still running RedHat rather than doing
&gt; &gt; continuous installs? I looked for a display properties in RedHat but
&gt; &gt; found nothing. Is XF86config a good place to start?Any and all help is
&gt; &gt; as always REALLY appreciated.Kym
