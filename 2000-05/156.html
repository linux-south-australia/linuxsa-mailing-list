With all respect, don't assume.

&gt; 
&gt; This can't be the most efficient solution surely.

You're considering doing two system calls per page access, on
top of the ones that Apache is doing already (there are some
figures regarding this on Apache's web site, IIRC).  For each
component in the URL, consider that not only does Apache have
to stat() each directory/file, but also possible .htaccess
files as well.  If the end component is just a directory,
then it has to attempt to access index.html, index.htm, and
maybe even index.cgi (plus whatever else you may have added).
All of these stat()'s involves the file system, so the kernel
has to look in its cache for the blocks in question, and then
retrieve them off of disk if they aren't resident.

And _you're_ worried about adding an extra two system calls to
that entire process that doesn't involve any disk I/O, and would
therefore "most likely" execute very quickly in kernel space, on
a module that's designed to limit throughput in the first place?
Consider that any user space locking mechanism you come up with
probably won't be portable to other architectures anyway.
