My first experience with them was iin a Windows environment and it 
scared the hell out of me, because it started sending stuff without 
me doing a thing and I hadn't been expecting it (only after it had 
been sent did I realise what was happening)

However, now that I'm using CSCMail I get the choice if I want to
respond to the receipt or not. So at least I get some warning and
know who is gathering what info....

&gt; Hi,
&gt;  
&gt;  What do people know about email receipts?  That is, where an email is
&gt;  sent back confirming that the email you sent was received/read.
&gt;  
&gt;  A friend told me there are two types of receipts: server ones and user
&gt;  ones.  The first type is issued by the mail server to confirm that the
&gt;  mail has reached the user.  The second type is issued by the user
&gt;  themselves, or by their software, to confirm that the email has been
&gt;  read.  My friend is a MS-Windows user so I'm not confident that his
&gt;  explanation is accurate.
&gt;  
&gt;  Can anyone explain just how the receipts work, as well as what
&gt;  software needs to be operational to make it work.
&gt;  
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;  
&gt;  Mark.
