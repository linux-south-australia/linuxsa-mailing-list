&gt; I personally have them on by default for email I send from work as it

&gt; tracking whether imnportant emails have come through.  It is annoying to
&gt; turn them off so I tend to leave them on.

And this is the crux of my beef with return receipts.  I have never
advocated to ban them; my problem has always been with the users
who misuse them, and those that think they are a panacea.

&gt; Sorry in advance to all those that get the hated [Y/N] question.

Again, it appears to take less effort to apologise and annoy all the
recipients of a mailing list that to disable/enable receipting for
a single message (I don't know if this scenario played out; I filter
out Return-Receipts-To headers at my MDA).

&gt; Sending mails to mailing lists and other non-critical emails
&gt; doesn't really warrant receipts, however most email clients don't have the
&gt; option to easily set a "do not send delivery requests to these addresses
&gt; (e.g. insert &lt;linuxsa&gt; here) rule. This does tend to mean that if you have
&gt; receipting on it tends to stay on.

That would be one of those "Innovative" mail readers, I guess.  From the
same company that thought executable content was a good idea (well, it is,
it's just poorly implemented - before someone quotes me out of context).

  Daryl Tester
