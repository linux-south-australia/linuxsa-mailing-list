Subject: perl question (slightly off topic)


&gt;
&gt; Hi, this is not necessarily Linux but I'm sure there are some PERL wizards
on
&gt; this list.  I am wanting to convert netscape history file dates from the
&gt; unixdate (seconds since 00/00/1970) to local time.  I know that perl can
do this
&gt; and not Knowing anything about PERL or programming (anyone suggest a
starting
&gt; place?) I wonder if someone can help.
&gt;
&gt; I know it is simply something like...
&gt; print scalar localtime &lt;string of numbers&gt; /n,
&gt;

Jason Tan already gave a good example of how to convert Unix time from epoch
seconds to "local" time. Another way to do it just from the command line is:

[<A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>] perl -e 'print scalar localtime shift' -- &lt;unixtime here&gt;

There are probably already Unix utilities that do this, but you could make a
shell alias that converts time by using:

alias tc="perl -e 'print scalar localtime shift, qq*\n*' --"

The qq*\n* is just a quoted newline done in such a way as to not conflict
with double quotes used with the alias command. It is the sort of thing that
gives perl a reputation for being pre-obfuscated ! You can then just do:

[<A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>] tc 959258132
Thu May 25 22:05:32 2000

Hmmm. I just checked. "convdate -c" does the same thing. Probably better, as
it does not start a 700 pound Perl interpreter to do a tiny
conversion.Anyway it was an excercise...

If you want to get into perl further, Jason gave some good starters. The
"Camel Book", formally (formerly !?) known as "Programming Perl" cannot be
recommended highly enough.

If you will be doing significant work with the Netscape history files you
should look at the Netscape::History CPAN module. It gives excellent
examples of how to manipulate and extract information from the Netscape
history files (which are just Berkeley DB database files).

CPAN modules are just perl library files which "plug-in" to your program and
make many tasks easier. Check out the CPAN url at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com.">http://www.perl.com.</A> If
you want to do something in perl, chances are that someone has already
written a CPAN module that will either

1 .. Do it, or if not:
2 .. Make it easier for you to do.

It might be slightly tough going if you are just starting out with Perl, but
will be worth the effort if you intend to go on and use Perl further.


Regards,

Andrew Speer
