Quoting Hoffman Daniel 
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:drhof@Kildare.Adl.Catholic.Edu.Au">drhof@Kildare.Adl.Catholic.Edu.Au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Im just curious as to if anyone has any experience 
with LDAP

Me.

&gt;
&gt; At present I have a NT server and will be getting a 
new box soon that will
&gt; _have_ to do mail / proxy and www... I would PREFER to 
run squid over
&gt; MSproxy.

We use squid with proxy authentication.

&gt;
&gt; Therefore I need to run a mail system as well as 
apache and squid on the
&gt; new
&gt; box. No hassle. But apache and squid can authenticate 
from a NT domain with
&gt; a module. However, getting mail to sync passwords as 
well as mail accounts.
&gt; (needs to create a new email address when a new user 
is created on the
&gt; domain) This is the part im having problems with.
&gt;
&gt; Im looking at running LDAP as the Central 
authentication system for both
&gt; box\'s. There are LDAP plugins for apache and squid and 
qmail. I would have
&gt; to get NT however to auth from the LDAP server rather 
than its built in
&gt; user
&gt; for domains module. Importing the UserBase from NT is 
also an issue as I
&gt; have about 600 users and about 2500 directories setup 
with direct user
&gt; permissions that I do not want to re-do. Does anyone 
have any experience
&gt; with LDAP or can offer me alternate ideas?

Here\'s the way Xavier is headed (and almost there). A 
Samba TNG machine acting as the PDC. All other file 
servers (NT or Linux) will run Samba as a member of the 
NT domain controlled by Samba. Using the \'unix password 
sync = \' line in smb.conf, I will have the Unix password 
(stored in an LDAP directory) updated. I think this will 
work, because Windows apparently sends plain text 
passwords when changing passwords.

If the unix password sync thing won\'t work, I will hack 
the LDAP CGI scripts I am writing, to allow for a call 
to smbpasswd or samedit and have all password changes 
through a HTTP interface (which is the way the boss 
wants to go anyway).

we use PAM_LDAP, NSS_LDAP, LDAP_AUTH (squid) and soon 
mod_ldap_auth for Apache. Sendmail 8.10.x also supports 
mail routing and stuff through LDAP.

If you have any specific questions, I will happily 
answer them on or off the list (maybe a little time 
delay though).

Hope it helps,
