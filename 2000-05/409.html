Sorry

I read my copy of the short message first ( it hit my personal folder which
I read before LinuxSA and many others).

Others

I accept Daryl's criticism entirely.

I guess I come from the 'old school' of User Groupies where people help
others regardless ( or say 'Not Tonight - Sorry'}.

I seem to have hit some people's  'comfort zones' .

In my 'Model' a Web Page of LinuxSA Members Photos would include the
subjects that people would be happy to be questioned on. Some might even
offer their email address too!

People identified as 'newbies' wouldn't be asked as many questions I guess.

I will just keep plugging away. As Linux gets a wider audience than in its
early years MORE assistance will be required by ever less technical people.
If it is to get a wider audience the 'early adopters' will be challenged to
assist the 'new users' in a 'user friendly' fashion.

I support WINDOZE users and Genealogists from the 'Seniors Community' - very
frustrating but maybe it makes their lives a little more productive.

Whew - got that off my chest!  Just my 2c worth.

There was a comment made at tonight's meeting (I didn't see who actually
made the comment) that along the lines of a "disappointing turnout of
people who had/wanted their picture taken".  I took exception to this
comment (although it wasn't aimed at me personally), and while normally
I'd just forget this ("process and move on"), I do have the following to
say on the subject (of course it's IMHO).

When I used to take tutorial classes while studying at UniSA, I used
to get accosted by students outside of those tutorial times who'd want
help with their assignments or subject matter.  While I was only too
pleased to help (I'm an altruistic kinda guy, and I do get a buzz from
teaching), it was still a pretty tremendous strain on my time.

On a mailing list, I can pretty much do the same thing, except I get
to pick and choose the questions I can answer, and if I've had a
really long day (and I don't mean just a mere 8 hours of work), I can
just skip over a bunch of messages.  I like to think I put a bit of
thought into my answers (most times - there are the inevitable cockups),
and try to impart some Zen along the way.  I go to the LinuxSA meetings
as much for the social interaction as for the technical knowledge.  The
last thing I want is someone coming up to me asking for help on subjects
I know nothing about, or even on subjects I _do_ know about but don't
particularly care to answer because I've just spent a day and a half
rebuilding a system from scratch with no backups, a severe head cold
and matching head ache.  You may be lucky if I don't disembowel you
with my Krone tool.  To condemn people just because they don't fit
into your pattern of "helpfulness", however, is just plain wrong.

&lt;/vent organ="spleen"&gt;

Regards,
  Daryl Tester
