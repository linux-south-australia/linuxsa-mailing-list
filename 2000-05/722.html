I believe it is possible to take this one step further. By placing a cookie
on the client end after they have made a request from a non HTMP 1.1
compliant browser it can become possible to automatically provide
appropriate redirection on subsequent accesses to the site by name.

Hi,

Watch out for Virtual hosting, as in a purest sense you would be using HTTP
1.1.
This allowing a single IP to serve many websites.

As a result you will find that if the customers web browser does not support
HTTP 1.1 then they won't be able to get to any of your sites via DNS name.

I have seen an additional trick to get around this.
The method is to map a non HTTP 1.1 site to the IP which when the customer
with a non 1.1 compliant browser goes to, they get a list of the sites on
the server, not referenced by DNS name but by directory structure on the
server. They simply press the appropriate link and off they go.


Derek

Subject: Virtual Hosting


Hi...

I have been asked by the company that I work for to set up a linux based
machine to do virtual web hosting

I was wondering if there were any gotchas that I need to be aware of in case
the system falls over

At the moment we will just be running two sites (ie our corporate site and
our customers site) but we are hoping for more.

Email is currently being handled by the ISP and we won't be looking at that
at this stage however it is in the plans

Thanks

Damien
