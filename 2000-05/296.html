&gt; 2. Is it possible to set up a Linux webserver machine to respond to multiple
&gt; IP addresses, eg. I have a telstra connection which uses an IP like this
&gt; 139.130.138.123 (has been altered) this ip address is for the computer which
&gt; is connected to telstra. I also have several other IP addresses which I
&gt; intend to use for the webserver and mail eg 203.38.200.123 and
&gt; 203.38.200.124 for www and mail respectively now what I would like to know
&gt; is whether I can set up a linux machine to cater for all three of these ip
&gt; addresses ?

Yes, in short.  In detail, it is a little difficult.  I know that Apache is
able to be configured to respond to multiple domain names.  The Linux kernel
network drivers are what is configured to ACCEPT multiple IPs into the one
ethernet device.  I don't know how Apache deals with this tho.


&gt; 3. I want to be able to set up the following on a single computer:
&gt; Website,POP3,Firewall,IP Masquerading,Gateway is this possible on a single
&gt; computer. If so what FREE linux programs should I use, I have already
&gt; decided to use APACHE for the webserver, and from what I have read SENDMAIL
&gt; is a good email server, and IPMASQ is good for NAT.

For web you'll need Apache
For POP3, you'll need IMAP package from RH 6.1 CD
for firewall, masquerating, gateway, you'll need ipchains (and some other
stuff, and a kernel recompile, usually)

Sendmail is a real bitch to configure properly.  I used to get a number of
emails from my ISP (on my ISP mail account) saying that mail was
bouncing/being routed incorrectly, etc.  And I had a lot of trouble with
long BCC lists on it.  That was with the default config 6 months ago.  I
have been VERY slowly ironing out the bugs in the config and it is getting
better.  Be prepared for a STEEP learning curve if you don't know sendmail
because there are literally hundreds of options to tweak, and you need to
twiddle most of them to get it right for your site.  Just quickly, sendmail
is a SMTP server.  It does mail routing, not local delivery, so you may or
may not need to configure a local delivery agent of your choice sometime in
the future when your needs become very specific.

Other than that, welcome to the wonderful world of Linux, where everything
is possible, and for free.  You'll enjoy the support from software
developers, and lists/clubs like this one.  It is surprising how much
support is out there, even for supposedly "free" (as in speech, not beer...
lol) software.

If you need any help setting things up, email me direct.  I have a small net
here that has email domain, pop3/imap server, sendmail, ipmasq, and I am
about to add a very basic proxy/web server using Apache to make the net a
little quicker on the sites the family regularly visit (a 33.6 modem and 3
users simultaneously visiting is slow sometimes...)

Cheers,
Adam
