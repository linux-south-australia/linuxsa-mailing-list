Hi all

I am having some problems with RH 6.1 on a new Acer TravelMate 730TX.

1) X

Seems to be fine.  The video card runs well off the Mach32 server and the
screen configures easily.  No probs here.

2) Mouse

It is a Synaptics PS/2 Touchpad.  On the first install, this was detected
and configured, and worked fine both in X and the vc's.  However, it no
longer works, after reinstalling.  When I try it (both in x and with gpm)
it skips wildly all over the screen with just the slightest touch.

3) Network Card

I think this is a fairly standard card.  It's detected during install and
already has a line in /etc/conf.modules:

alias eth0 eepro100

But when init reaches the stage of starting interface eth0, it just locks.
I had to reboot into single user mode and remove the conf.modules line
before I could boot into runlevel 3 (albeit with a bunch of /etc/sysconfig
modem error messages due to the changed conf.modules).

4) Sound Card

is an ESS Solo-1 PCI AudioDrive.  This seems to be detected upon the
install and by sndconfig as a ESS Technology | ES1969 Solo-1 Audiodrive,
and it has an entry in /etc/conf.modules:

alias sound esssolo1

However when Linux boots, it starts squealing at me in the init and
doesn't stop.  It is a high pitched beep that does not stop.

--

That's about it.  Has anyone successfully set up an Acer laptop before?
Any suggestions would be greatfully appreciated.

Thanks

Tim Riley
