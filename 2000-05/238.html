I just checked out the photos.
Good Stuff Sarah, but a few of those "kids" looked older than what I
remember kids to be :)

&gt; Generation Linux May 2000 has come and gone.  Overall the event was a HUGE
&gt; success!  The response from the children, parents and teachers was very
&gt; positive.  The attendance numbers were excellent, the lab was full for
&gt; most sessions.
&gt;
&gt; More than a few people were surprised at how easily the children took to
&gt; Linux.  The children were enthusiastic and had fun!  I was amazed to see
&gt; one boy go through the first part of the installation in less then 5
&gt; minutes.
&gt;
&gt; I am happy to say that Generation Linux was rewarding and the results well
&gt; and truly exceeded my expectations.
&gt;
&gt; The photos are at: <A HREF="http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~sara/gl/images">http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~sara/gl/images</A>
&gt;
&gt; Lee Anderson (journalist from LinuxWorld) flew out and did an interview,
&gt; he took pictures of the event and also participated by helping the
&gt; children.  He will be doing a full write up about the event.
&gt;
&gt; Conrad Parker (president of the Sydney Linux User Group) gave an excellent
&gt; talk to the children about Free Software in Science.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks to LinuxMall.com we had 1000 Linux CDs to give away and 250
&gt; penguins. The penguins arrived Monday, this was just in time for me to
&gt; give the penguins to the children who did the Monday sessions (actually
&gt; the first session missed out!)  The children loved them!
&gt;
&gt; I spoke to a number of school teachers and they are keen to run more
&gt; sessions in the future.  I will put the documentation and Linux
installation
&gt; instructions (which are specifically designed for children) on the web so
&gt; that other people can run their own events.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again to LinuxMall.com for the penguins and the CDs!
