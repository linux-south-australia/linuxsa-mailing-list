[1] One thing that people, who have attended install fests before or have
installed Linux on their own, have said to me is "Well, I loaded it - it
looks good, but how {do I install apps | fix the broken links | get updates
| connect to my ISP | what are these "tar" things and how do I install them,
etc}".  What they seem to want is, for want of a better term, a
"Config-fest" so that they feel comfortable with Linux.

[2] With StarOffice a "freebie", should we perhaps offer this as an extra
installation for those who want to try an alternative to the competition?

[3] Whilst not wanting to start a religious war, having observed people
(some quite pc literate) trying out different flavours of Linux, my current
{personal} recommendation is Caldera, then Redhat|Mandrake then other
flavours as the user educates themself.  Why not have pc with each of the
"supported" distributions set-up so that newbies (and not so new) can have a
quick look at each one.

[4] Having had my say, I would normally offer my services (hey - I can
always stand there and make real coffee) but unfortunately I'll be in Sydney
from early June until early Oct working (in a technical capacity) on the
Olympics.  If I'm able (read allowed), I'll try and get some behind the
scenes info and photos for a talk when I get back - if anyone is interested.

Cheers,

Tony Riling
