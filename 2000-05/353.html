Recent governments (mostly conservative ones) have made a big thing
about government being a business and therefore anything that doesn't
make money should be closed down, and anything that does make money
should be sold off etc. etc. etc.

If government _were_ a business, then you could sue them for
harm caused by negligeance. But recent governments have always
said "we're just a business" when they want to be stingy, and
"we are a special sovereign entity" when they want to trample
over your previously-taken-for-granted rights or to defend
themselves against the kind of scrutiny which is applied to
any other institution.

By the way, on the linux front, I reckon that if the government
really wanted to do something entrepreneurial, they would
fund 50 open-source scholarships a year for open source authors
to write anything they like at the current average wage.
I'm sure this would lead to some excellent technologies that
could be exported. Now _that_ would be clever!

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
