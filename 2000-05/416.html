Hi All,
    I would like to add my support to those who offer their
time to help others on the list and at meetings. As a helper
and a helpee, I don't think it is very fair that a few
people will bag the helpers or flame the innocent newbie (or
even the experienced who maybe should know better) just for
the reaction or to make themselves look good. In the past in
the days of the BBS, these people existed as "Leeches" who
just sucked files into black holes at the other end of phone
lines, or played the online games and amassed the high
scores, and they still exist today. Most of these people are
quite knowledgeable and could help others and do it well,
but for some reason if it can't be done without making them
look good and others bad, then they are not interested.

    This group is about helping people get into Linux and
it's associated activities and knowledges. Last night I left
San Georgios just before 2:00 am because people wanted to
help me with my Laptop, and I thank especially Mike, Tim,
Geoffrey and any others who helped me out. This is the kind
of attitude we want in the Linux community and quite frankly
if you are not interested in it, then leave, we are better
off without you.

    Finally, since I too will be moving to Melbourne in a
weeks time for work, I would at this time like to thank
those who helped me in the last 2 years at LinuxSA, and also
those who are the general helpers in the List, Richard
Sharpe, Alan Kennington, Matthew Tippett and others. I will
be continuing to take part in the Linux Community over
there, and will probably still subscribe to this list. Keep
up the good work all.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;&gt; At Tuesday's meeting I will

&gt;
&gt;There was a comment made at tonight's meeting (I didn't see
who actually
&gt;made the comment) that along the lines of a "disappointing
turnout of
&gt;people who had/wanted their picture taken".  I took
exception to this
&gt;comment (although it wasn't aimed at me personally), and
while normally
&gt;I'd just forget this ("process and move on"), I do have the
following to
&gt;say on the subject (of course it's IMHO).
&gt;
&gt;When I used to take tutorial classes while studying at
UniSA, I used
&gt;to get accosted by students outside of those tutorial times
who'd want
&gt;help with their assignments or subject matter.  While I was
only too
&gt;pleased to help (I'm an altruistic kinda guy, and I do get
a buzz from
&gt;teaching), it was still a pretty tremendous strain on my
time.
&gt;
&gt;On a mailing list, I can pretty much do the same thing,
except I get
&gt;to pick and choose the questions I can answer, and if I've
had a
&gt;really long day (and I don't mean just a mere 8 hours of
work), I can
&gt;just skip over a bunch of messages.  I like to think I put
a bit of
&gt;thought into my answers (most times - there are the
inevitable cockups),
&gt;and try to impart some Zen along the way.  I go to the
LinuxSA meetings
&gt;as much for the social interaction as for the technical
knowledge.  The
&gt;last thing I want is someone coming up to me asking for
help on subjects
&gt;I know nothing about, or even on subjects I _do_ know about
but don't
&gt;particularly care to answer because I've just spent a day
and a half
&gt;rebuilding a system from scratch with no backups, a severe
head cold
&gt;and matching head ache.  You may be lucky if I don't
disembowel you
&gt;with my Krone tool.  To condemn people just because they
don't fit
&gt;into your pattern of "helpfulness", however, is just plain
wrong.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/vent organ="spleen"&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;  Daryl Tester
