&gt; I'm not sure can I agree that programs should not be able to send email

&gt; to type Y for every outgoing message.  Anyway, the problem isn't that
&gt; Outlook can send automated mail; the determined virus writer can open a TCP
&gt; connection to your configured SMTP host and thus avoid what you suggest.
&gt; The problem clearly is that people, unknown to the recipient, can send a
&gt; message containing a program, and Outlook is configured to execute that
&gt; program by default.

I think this is logically wrong.

You're thinking in terms of the unix model.
The windows world has clients and servers.
Therefore what we think of as ordinary and super users
is clearly separated physically in the windows world
into server boxes and client boxes.

On the ordinary mug's client box, you _can_ check everything
they're doing for sanity. Everything that happens there is
supposed to be user initiated.

So the solution is then to implement the "no mail transmission
before verification" rule, or the "no automatica mail transmission"
rule on client boxes only.

&lt;blurbage&gt;
Of course, there's no substitute for good design.
The fact that MS regularly distribute documents as
.exe files is not just a way of stopping non-MS users
from reading them, but also an encouragement to
negligeant behaviour.

Anyway, who would have thought about 18 months ago
at the time of the Halloween documents and Geoffrey's
refund [I hope he keeps the cheque for the
Australian National Linux Musuem], that public
consciousness could have moved so far in the right direction?
Even members of congress are starting to think like us.
I wouldn't be surprised now if the US congress considered
a bill in a year or two to outlaw closed source software.
&lt;/blurbage&gt;

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS. If anyone would like to see what an ordinary mug can
do with Apache modules in 5 days, take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/bwshare-trace">http://www.topology.org/bwshare-trace</A>
(But please don't click on the DNS translations.)
This module collects stats on bandwidth usage
by all clients of an Apache server.
The work remaining is to make it limit individual user
usage to reasonable levels, and to balance load
among users under load.
