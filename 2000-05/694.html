Hi,

I've installed MS Proxy into several of our clients sites and I've gotta say
that I'm not impressed with it.  In our own office, the proxy server
frequently goes into "stupid mode" and needs to be restarted to restore
normal operation (for some reason, it starts serving pages out of the
default intranet site rather than fetching them from the web).  Our clients
have a few problems with MS Proxy, but not as many as we do (they also don't
put nearly as much traffic through theirs as we do either).

I've also found that while IE works well through the HTTP proxy, many other
applications don't work through it at all.  I'm not sure what the story is
here.

MS Proxy also includes a "Winsock Proxy" service which is best described as
"poor man's IP-Masq'ing".  Internally, we run private IP's (10.0.0.x range),
and use the Winsock proxy service to provide internet access to all
machines.  Once installed the Winsock proxy is pretty transparent and works
with virtually everything I've tried it with.  ICQ, SETI, Yahoo Messenger,
Napster and Various IRC clients all work.  The only application that I
couldn't get working was Carbon Copy (a remote control program), which seems
to have some funky connection/authentication mechanism which didn't work
through the proxy.

Performance on a properly equipped server seems reasonable, although we've
only got 10-20 users using out proxies, so I'd be worried if the performance
was bad!  

Having said all of that, I intend to put a 3rd network card into our Linux
router as soon as time permits and set up squid and NAT.  MS Proxy is just
not up to the job.

MS Proxy is also pretty expensive to licence (from memory $2500 for the
server and $70 per client), and you'll need a gruntier machine on which to
run NT and MS Proxy than you will for Linux/Squid.  so there's an additional
hardware cost there as well.

No practical experience with squid, which seems to be the most popular
Linux/FBSD proxy.  I know its in use by a lot of ISP's (SE Net (SA's Largest
ISP apparently) runs their proxy system on Squid), so it can't be too bad.

Hope that helps.

Jim.

Subject: NT vs Linux for proxy serving


Dear all,

I work at a university student computer dropin centre and my boss wants
to build an inhouse proxy server due to the fact that we are starting to
get billed greatly for our web usage by the university.

The boss (who is a bit of a one eyed Microsoft user) wants to put in an
NT proxy server whilst most of the employees that have had anything to
do with this sort of thing say that Linux is the way to go.

I need some UNBIASED, level headed facts and truths to put forward so
that the box becomes a LINUX one. The Boss's main argument is that as
soon as Linux becomes used in 60% of businesses for this task, then she
will think about it, but not before. The Boss says they will stick to NT
as they believe support is far more widely available.

The boss hasn't touched Linux or any sort of Unix type environment
before and I think it might just be a case of fear of the unknown.

Any comments along the above line would be greatly appreciated
especially from Glen Turner, ITS people or anyone that has done
something like this on a commercial level.


Kind regards

Darryl J Bosch
