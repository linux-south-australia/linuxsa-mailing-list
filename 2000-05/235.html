No.  BSD and Linux use mmap() for shared libraries, which isn't
persistent across process lifetimes.

MINIX is historically absolutely a precursor to Linux;  there's no room
for debate on that issue.  Linux was created by Linus to settle a debate
between him and AST about whether the benefits of monolithic kernel designs
(like Linux's) were sufficient to outweigh the advantages of clean 
design inherent in modular kernels (like MINIX's).  AST essentially said,
"You've never written a kernel, so what makes you think you know better?"
so Linus ran away and implemented Linux in response :-)

 &gt; probably why it's still in the Linux kernel- as a text book example.

No, more for compatibility with the various standards out there -- It's
hard to convince people to run Linux if the APIs which permit them
to port their applications aren't present.
