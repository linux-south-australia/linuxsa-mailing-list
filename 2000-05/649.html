&gt; I work at a university student computer dropin centre and my boss wants
&gt; to build an inhouse proxy server due to the fact that we are starting to
&gt; get billed greatly for our web usage by the university.
&gt; 
&gt; The boss (who is a bit of a one eyed Microsoft user) wants to put in an
&gt; NT proxy server whilst most of the employees that have had anything to
&gt; do with this sort of thing say that Linux is the way to go.
&gt; 
&gt; I need some UNBIASED, level headed facts and truths to put forward so
&gt; that the box becomes a LINUX one. The Boss's main argument is that as
&gt; soon as Linux becomes used in 60% of businesses for this task, then she
&gt; will think about it, but not before. The Boss says they will stick to NT
&gt; as they believe support is far more widely available.
&gt; 
&gt; The boss hasn't touched Linux or any sort of Unix type environment
&gt; before and I think it might just be a case of fear of the unknown.
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments along the above line would be greatly appreciated
&gt; especially from Glen Turner, ITS people or anyone that has done
&gt; something like this on a commercial level.

Ouch, dobbed in by name.  Please note that I no longer work for IT
Services at the University of Adelaide.  What's more ITS has excellent
UNIX and NT professionals who will probably answer questions for
free if you log a task with the help desk on 8303 3000.  The free
consulting is in their interest (the feeling is that if you do
something silly then guess who will eventually be the one stuck
with sorting the mess out).

That said, there are regular tests of proxy server performance at
the IRCache Bakeoff.  See

  <A HREF="http://bakeoff.ircache.net/">http://bakeoff.ircache.net/</A>

MS did not participate, you can take that as a bad sign.

For your application, the best value/performance combinations
seem to be:

 - FreeBSD + Squid

 - Novell

 - Cisco (assuming you get the academic discount)

Given that you only want one cache, I'd trade performance for
simplicity of management.  So get some pricing on the Cisco stuff
if you have a Cisco router, and get some pricing on the Novell
stuff if you have Novell expertise.

Similary, simplicity probably leads to the replacement of FreeBSD
with Red Hat Linux.  There is a performance hit.  But the hardware
support is a lot better and you don't want any issues on that front
if you only have one machine.

I'd also look to someone else to set this up for you.  If it
isn't time-critical you can probably find someone who will set
the machine up gratis.  Do watch them do this and take notes
in the machine log [1].

Other alternatives are computing or engineering students or
just post a message to this list with you precise requirements
and ask the people that install this stuff for a living to e-mail
you an in-confidence estimate.

Do think about the hardware, especially the memory and disk
subsystems.  More memory and more disks (disks, not necessarily
disk space) is better.  Don't buy the hardware first -- get the
people sorted out and make their first task the specification
and acquisition of the hardware.

&gt; One other thought concerning NT vs Linux at Adelaide Uni: You'll find
&gt; that if you are using NT, it'll be covered under the Uni's SOE, and so
&gt; you can probably get support from ITS if required.

Not so.  The Standard Operating Environment is a specification
for ITS-supported desktop computers.  ITS are strongly encouraging
all faculties to adopt the SOE where they use IBM compatible
PCs and it reserves the right to develop administrative applications
only for the SOE (this stops silliness like spending heaps of
cash attempting to port the PeopleSoft client to BeOS).

  You'll notice the persuasion here.  Power over the computing
  environment rests with the faculties, not ITS.  I can't tell
  you the frustration of watching faculties do really dumb things
  against your best advice (WinNT mail servers, ATM to the desktop,
  believing AppleTalk has a future, running file servers on 486s,
  ...).
]

All servers, regardless of OS, are maintained on an annual fee
or fee-for-service basis.  The reason for this is historical
(faculties didn't want ITS undercutting them hiring their own
IT staff to maintain the faculty's servers).  The ITS annual
fee is a bargain.

As far as I know ITS currently offer support contracts for:
Windows NT, Solaris, Tru64 UNIX, the SGI UNIX, Red Hat Linux
and FreeBSD. Windows 2000 will probably be added.  HPUX and
AIX probably won't.

 [1] You should have an exercise book for each machine.  This
     is to record useful stuff like drive models, IRQs, software
     configuration rationales, etc.  You should update it whenever
     you change the machine's configuration (if only with the
     date and file name and let RCS manage the change tracking).
     This applies to all operating systems -- especially NT.
