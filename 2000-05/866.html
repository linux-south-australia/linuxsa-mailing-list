Following may be of interest to those looking for something better than
56k - no pricing info as yet


PS: I was considering chopping bits out to make it a bit less long winded
but then if I wasn't careful it might end up with me looking a bit biased.

&gt; Coming soon - high speed services over the phone network
&gt;
&gt; Telstra today revealed the first exchanges that will offer customers fast
&gt; access to internet and data services over the standard telephone line in
&gt; its drive to provide affordable and high quality internet access to all
&gt; Australians.
&gt;
&gt; From the end of August this year, the rollout of high-speed internet
&gt; access via Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) will commence in all
&gt; national capital cities and Toowoomba (Qld), Launceston (Tas) and Bunbury
&gt; (WA).
&gt;
&gt; Ziggy Switkowski, Telstra's Chief Executive Officer, foreshadowed the
&gt; rollout in March at Telstra's half year results when he outlined Telstra's
&gt; strategy to 'broadband' the country with cable, ADSL and satellite.
&gt;
&gt; Denis Mullane, Telstra's Data Product General Manager said the technology
&gt; would initially be installed in about 200 exchanges providing high-speed
&gt; internet access to about 3.5 million premises targeting residential,
&gt; small, medium, corporate and ISP customers.
&gt;
&gt; "About 90 per cent of Australian households and businesses will have
&gt; access to Telstra's high-speed media and data services by mid 2002," he
&gt; said.
&gt;
&gt; "The beauty of ADSL is that in most cases the line speed is 30 to 50 times
&gt; faster than standard dial-up services and customers can make and receive
&gt; telephone calls while surfing the net."
&gt;
&gt; Customers including small office, home office and small and medium
&gt; enterprises will be able to have 'always-on' access to Big Pond Advance
&gt; where they can enjoy high-speed access to the internet and CD quality
&gt; music, video clips and video games.
&gt;
&gt; Business customers will be able to establish high-speed links between
&gt; premises, such as the office and home (teleworking), via Remote Network
&gt; Access (RNA).
&gt;
&gt; Information on which exchanges will get ADSL will be available on the
&gt; Telstra website <A HREF="http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl">http://www.telstra.com.au/adsl</A> from Monday, 29 May or by
&gt; calling 1800 151 454.
&gt;
&gt; Internet Service Providers (ISPs) looking to offer high-speed upgrades to
&gt; their dial-up customers can call Telstra's ISP Sales and Service Centre
&gt; help line on 1800 624 512.
&gt;
&gt; "We are committed to a very aggressive rollout program to achieve
&gt; substantial high-speed coverage by the end of this year," Denis said.
&gt;
&gt; Customers who cannot get high speed internet access via ADSL or cable can
&gt; receive similar services via Telstra's satellite access. Each month as the
&gt; rollout gathers pace, details of additional exchange coverage will be
&gt; posted on Telstra's web site.  Telstra will unveil its customer pricing
&gt; plans by August.
&gt;
&gt; Telstra's wholesale customers will be offered a choice between two
&gt; products to deliver broadband on copper to their customers - QuickStream
&gt; and AccessLink.
&gt;
&gt; Frequently asked questions
&gt;
&gt; Telstra is bringing you great, new, fast internet access on your telephone
&gt; line
&gt;
&gt; *	It's non-stop. There's no dialling up.  And you make voice calls at
&gt; the same time as you surf the net, all on the one line.  It gives you
&gt; access to real-time, interactive multimedia and video.
&gt; *	Telstra will provide this using ADSL.  It will transform Telstra's
&gt; phone network for the digital age and will be available from August this
&gt; year.
&gt; [ADSL is an acronym for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line. The asymmetry
&gt; allows you to download a LOT faster than you send out - the perfect
&gt; symmetry for Internet users]
&gt; What can I use ADSL for?
&gt; *	High speed always-on internet access
&gt; *	Telecommuting (remote LAN access) and specialised network access
&gt; *	Interactive video, including video on demand such as delayed TV
&gt; segments
&gt; *	High speed video games, video catalogues, and video information
&gt; retrieval
&gt; *	Collaborative computing
&gt; *	Video conferencing
&gt; *	Distance learning
&gt; *	Internet and telecommuting applications for SOHO (Small Office/Home
&gt; Office) applications.
&gt;
&gt; How fast is it?
&gt;
&gt; *	High-speed always-on access gives a faster response to the internet
&gt; and is a more satisfying experience.
&gt; *	Or, about 30 to 50 times faster than standard dial-up services.
&gt; *	Playing computer games online will be much faster
&gt; *	Files are up-and-down-loaded much faster for instant sharing of
&gt; photo's, videos, and music
&gt; *	ADSL means always-on, high speed internet
&gt; *	It also gives you simultaneous internet and voice/fax capabilities
&gt; over a single phone line - so you don't need a second line for internet
&gt; use and you can still make calls while surfing the net.
&gt; *	Homes and businesses worldwide are already running out of spare
&gt; lines on existing telephone cables, so ADSL spares the expense of
&gt; providing new cable or copper lines for internet access.
&gt;
&gt; What will I need to use ADSL?
&gt;
&gt; *	Firstly, because ADSL is a distance dependant technology, you will
&gt; need to live within approximately 3.5 kilometres (cable distance) of an
&gt; ADSL equipped telephone exchange.
&gt; *	You will also need an ADSL modem and a computer with at least a
&gt; Pentium 133, 32 Meg RAM capacity with a CD ROM , capable of supporting
&gt; Windows 95 or upgrade to 64Meg RAM with NT 4.0. An external ADSL modem
&gt; will normally require a 10BaseT (Ethernet) interface card.
&gt; *	The modem connects over Telstra's copper phone lines to 'Customer
&gt; Multiplexer' equipment in Telstra's local exchanges which switch data to
&gt; and from a high speed backbone network.
&gt; *	Business customers will typically use a router instead of an ADSL
&gt; modem and provide internet or intranet access to a number of users
&gt; simultaneously.
