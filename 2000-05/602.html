&gt; I have a connection from a remote machine thats sitting in the "FIN_WAIT"

&gt; 
&gt; Is this a futile as trying to kill zombie processes? Or is it something
&gt; that can be done, or even should be done.
&gt; 
&gt; If I get heaps of these "FIN_WAIT" connections, will I run into problems

Read 'man netstat' to find out what the different states are.  

Depending how the way the kernel handles things, you might find that the 
file descriptor has been released from the kernel.  This is not the
case for SYN_RECV which has historically been the cause for some of the
TCP based DOS attacks of yesteryear.

There may also be a maximum limit ont he number of allocated sockets
on a system.  You might have to dig around in the kernel to see what
how things are allocated - it might well be that it is done dynamically
and your system is limited by physical memory.

I personally wouldn't worry about it, unless you start seeing funnies.

But even then /proc/sys/net/ipv4 has gots lots of goodies that allow
you to configure the way TCP/IP works.
