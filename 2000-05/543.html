&gt; Just remember that receipts are an optional part of the protocol.
&gt; Even for MTAs and clients that support them there are configuration
&gt; switches to silently discard receipt requests.  Larger e-mail sites use
&gt; these as a matter of course --  as irresponsible user behaviour
&gt; (asking for a receipt on every message) and poor user interface
&gt; design (allowing a receipt request to be generated only by altering
&gt; a default) would double the message counts of a large site.
&gt; 
&gt; So you cannot conclude that no receipt implies no delivery.

Thanks for the info.  Certainly receipts increase traffic, but perhaps
it's a justifiable expense --- you and others seem to be arguing
otherwise, but I'm not yet convinced.  For sure, responsible use of
receipts should be encouraged.

Certainly "no receipt" does not imply "no delivery", but "receipt"
does imply "delivery" (apart from deliberate deception).  The more
sites that disallow receipts, the less utility the receipts have, but
there still is utility there.

&gt; Equally, as the receipt has no crypto signature, a received
&gt; receipt is useless as a document that proves e-mail delivery
&gt; to any level of assurance beyond casual interest.

Ultimately it would be a good thing to have cryptography based
receipts, but till that time, this kind of receipt has some value.
Its value goes beyond casual interest.  The main time receipts are
going to be wrong would be if someone was deliberately trying to
mislead.  For 99% of emails there will be no motive for someone to
forge receipts.  Sure if you're sending emails involving potential
monetary gain etc you shouldn't rely on receipts, but for normal email
correspondence they should suffice.

Cheers,

Mark.
