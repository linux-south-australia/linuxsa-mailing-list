&gt; I'm in the process of setting up a new email server for work, which is
&gt; simple enough. However, I've been asked to see about logging every single
&gt; email that passes through the server, including saving the entire email to
&gt; disk. The reason why is that e-mails can be treated as legal documents, so
&gt; the boss wants to log everything, in case there are any questions asked.
&gt; I've identifed two areas I need to look into:

*snip*

&gt; - Legalities of setting it up. Is this going to be breaking privacy laws, or
&gt; anything like that? If we write up our acceptable use policies to notify
&gt; staff that their email is being recorded, does that make it legal? Where can
&gt; I find out more information about the entire topic?

IANAL, but, as far as I know, there is no legal issue for you here.
Email sent/recieved by employees (at work, of course) is the property of
the employer, and can be treated like any other written work an employee
creates for you.

A quick search round the 'net hasn't shown anything up immediately, but
you can try browsing from <A HREF="http://www.nla.gov.au/oz/law.html">http://www.nla.gov.au/oz/law.html</A> if you like.
