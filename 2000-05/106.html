Hey All,

I'm in the process of setting up a new email server for work, which is
simple enough. However, I've been asked to see about logging every single
email that passes through the server, including saving the entire email to
disk. The reason why is that e-mails can be treated as legal documents, so
the boss wants to log everything, in case there are any questions asked.
I've identifed two areas I need to look into:

- How to set it up (more on this in a minute)

- Legalities of setting it up. Is this going to be breaking privacy laws, or
anything like that? If we write up our acceptable use policies to notify
staff that their email is being recorded, does that make it legal? Where can
I find out more information about the entire topic?

About setting it up. I believe this is fairly straight forward:

- By rewriting some of the sendmail rules, get it to deliver each and every
message to a script that will save the message to a file, named based on the
username, date and a serial number of how many emails have been sent /
received that day.

 - When the size of the dumped emails reaches a preset size, send an email
to the administrator.

- The Administrator will then come in, stick a blank CD in the burner and
dump the archive onto CD for storage.

Can anyone see any problems with the above? Does anyone know of any programs
that will help in what I've got planned? Does anyone already do this and can
give me some pointers?

Darryl
