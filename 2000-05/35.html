Hello,

If they're downloading the whole site they're probably using something
like wget (ie a robot) - perhaps you could configure robots.txt to not
allow connections to certain files / directories?

Cheers,

&gt; From time to time, more and more frequently,
&gt; people browsing my site decide to download the whole site,
&gt; perhaps not realising that there are some 55 MB of files,
&gt; about 1000 html pages and so forth.
&gt; 
&gt; Someone just did that again at 6 a.m. this morning from Denmark.
&gt; They seem to have just seen a couple of pages they liked, and
&gt; thought - why not download it all and read it tomorrow.
&gt; The 75 minute download they did would have cost me
&gt; about 12 MB * (7c/MB) = 84 cents.
&gt; This doesn't sound like much unless it happens a couple of times
&gt; every night and day, in which case its going to cost me
&gt; in the thousands of dollars per year - to send people stuff
&gt; that they are either not going to read, or else they're going
&gt; to put it on their own server and put ads on it to make money somehow.
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked for a few months for some form of software which can prevent this.
&gt; What I'd like is an Apache module which can be configured to,
&gt; say, reject any request from a user who requests more than
&gt; 1 MB or 20 files in any one hour.
&gt; The exact numbers don't matter.
&gt; 
&gt; I've looked at the O'Reilly Apache book for inspiration,
&gt; and writing a new module does look a little daunting.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any ideas on the least time-and-energy
&gt; way to do what I want with this?
&gt; 
&gt; I've even thought of implementing this sort of access
&gt; limiting as a kernel module in the IP layer - once again,
&gt; this is a lot of work.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
