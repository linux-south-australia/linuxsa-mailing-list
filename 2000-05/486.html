&gt; I was only advocating POP from an ISP's perspective, where if you

It is possible to use IMAP for _everything_ that POP can do. Including
letting customers have access to an inbox and nothing else. This is one of
the enduring myths of IMAP. (Another one is that IMAP is less able to be
handled securely along the lines of kpop.)

Have a look at <A HREF="http://www.imap.org/papers/imap.vs.pop.brief.html.">http://www.imap.org/papers/imap.vs.pop.brief.html.</A> As it
points out, both POP and IMAP can be used in offline mode, which is what
you are talking about. The big and only drawback to IMAP was for many
years a lack of implementations. That is no longer the case.

In fact, IMAP is better at offline mode than POP due to the presence of
status flags that allow better error detection and correction (ie you can
be much surer of complete downloads.)

As far as I can tell, ISPs are rather like sheep on this topic, possibly
to their disadvantage. For example, if all mail customers were given an
IMAP mailbox by default, with privs set so that they could only use it for
offline mail access, a simple permission change turns the same account
into an upmarket "corporate account" with charges by the megabyte or
eye colour or whatever the latest scam is :-)

&gt; But that isn't a "corporate environment", which was counter
&gt; to Dan's theme for the night.

Many thanks for attempting to understand me, but clearly I got it wrong
again. I think medium-to-large ISPs fit right into "corporate" in the
sense that I tried to use the term, although their needs are somewhat
special (eg ISPs experience more burstiness, so issues like daemon
footprints are more important to them because absolutely everyone wants
to download their mail at 1900 every night.)
