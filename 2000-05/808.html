&gt; having recently installed Lintels Year of the Florid Artichoke on
&gt; my stone circle I was horrified to find that when I try to
&gt; calculate the sunrise at equinox, the entire system crashes and
&gt; requires a complete reinstallation...so far three druids have
&gt; been crushed and we are two weeks late in preparing the solstice
&gt; sacrifice...not that it'll matter because we are rapidly running
&gt; out of druids
&gt; 
&gt; the stone circle on the other side of the hills is operating
&gt; under Runex and they don't seem to have this problem...though,
&gt; admittedly, they have spent so much time setting up the circle
&gt; that the harvest has failed two years in a row and their chickens
&gt; have stopped laying
&gt; 
&gt; I am nostalgic for the good old days of DOS [1]
&gt; 
&gt; [1] dead old stones

&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like you need the latest service pack. Check MicaSoft's
&gt; slabsite. Of course, word has it that the latest service pack
&gt; introduces more bugs than it fixes. And if you complain to
&gt; MicaSoft, they'll just tell you your druids need to get MCSD
&gt; (MicaSoft Certified System Druid) certification.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; the stone circle on the other side of the hills is operating
&gt; &gt; under Runex and they don't seem to have this problem...though,
&gt; &gt; admittedly, they have spent so much time setting up the circle
&gt; &gt; that the harvest has failed two years in a row and their chickens
&gt; &gt; have stopped laying
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you mean. It's hard to get a good Runex admin these
&gt; days. Plus, since MicaSoft has all the quarries under its thumb,
&gt; you can't get a set of stones without getting Lintels already
&gt; installed. So now you have to uninstall Lintels before you can
&gt; install Runex. Even worse, the stones are tweaked to work better
&gt; with Lintels and some peripheral stones don't work at all with
&gt; Runex unless you can find someone to write a custom incantation.
&gt; 
&gt; And don't even get me started about all this contunuous upgrade
&gt; business. Seems like every time I get a circle up and running
&gt; the way I want it, a new set of stones comes out that's twice
&gt; as fast, packs twice the stones into the same area and costs
&gt; half the price.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, I heard recently that some druids have been
&gt; installing Runex on older, abandoned circles, then linking them
&gt; together in a cluster to make one big system that's more powerful
&gt; than the latest models. Sounds promising.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, all they seem to want to do with these systems is
&gt; summon up images of cavorting nymphs and trade illegal copies
&gt; of rock music.
