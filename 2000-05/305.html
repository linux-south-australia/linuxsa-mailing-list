Having given probably more Linux courses than anyone else in Australia :-),
I am continually coming up against new hardware problems.

We rent hardware for the courses, and the rental companies continually give
us newer hardware. The latest configuration had motherboards with 5 PCI
slots and 13GB disks, and 32MB NVidia TNT2 cards, etc.

The 13GB cards required a rethink on the way that we partition the disks,
but the 5 slot PCI mobo's required some debugging in a couple of cases.
This was because we had a misture of RTL8029 and 8139 cards.

Linux 2.2.14 off of the RH 6.2 install disk could not find both 8029 cards
on the couple of machines that had them in. After some messing around and
changing of slots, I formed the following opinion.

Since the PCI bus can only have 4 slots in it, these mobo's had two busses
and two PCI bridge chips. The cards had been installed in the last two PCI
slots and one was on the second bus. Moving the cards up so they were on
the same bus made all the difference.

Funny thing was, the RTL8139 cards had no such problem, despite also being
in the last two slots. So it looks like both a card and Linux problem.
Interestingly, when you install the drivers for the RTL8029 under Windows,
it asks for the etherent address of the card if there are more than one
card in the machine.
