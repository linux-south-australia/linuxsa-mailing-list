Quoting Darryl Ross &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dross@syc.asn.au">dross@syc.asn.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hey All,
&gt;
&gt; I\'m in the process of setting up a new email server 
for work, which is
&gt; simple enough. However, I\'ve been asked to see about 
logging every single
&gt; email that passes through the server, including saving 
the entire email to
&gt; disk. The reason why is that e-mails can be treated as 
legal documents, so
&gt; the boss wants to log everything, in case there are 
any questions asked.
&gt; I\'ve identifed two areas I need to look into:
&gt;
&gt; - How to set it up (more on this in a minute)
&gt;
&gt; - Legalities of setting it up. Is this going to be 
breaking privacy laws,
&gt; or
&gt; anything like that? If we write up our acceptable use 
policies to notify
&gt; staff that their email is being recorded, does that 
make it legal? Where
&gt; can
&gt; I find out more information about the entire topic?
&gt;
&gt; About setting it up. I believe this is fairly straight 
forward:
&gt;
&gt; - By rewriting some of the sendmail rules, get it to 
deliver each and every
&gt; message to a script that will save the message to a 
file, named based on
&gt; the
&gt; username, date and a serial number of how many emails 
have been sent /
&gt; received that day.
&gt;
&gt;  - When the size of the dumped emails reaches a preset 
size, send an email
&gt; to the administrator.
&gt;
&gt; - The Administrator will then come in, stick a blank 
CD in the burner and
&gt; dump the archive onto CD for storage.
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone see any problems with the above? Does 
anyone know of any
&gt; programs
&gt; that will help in what I\'ve got planned? Does anyone 
already do this and
&gt; can
&gt; give me some pointers?
&gt;
&gt; Darryl

Sendmail will allow you to forward each message to the 
intended recipient as well as another one. You could 
tell it to always send a copy to a storage account. 
Check out the Bat Book as well as sendmail.org, the 
links that are on both and the sendmail docs.

Hope it helps,
Matt
