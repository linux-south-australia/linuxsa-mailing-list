Quoting Bruce Moffatt &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bmoffatt@picknowl.com.au">bmoffatt@picknowl.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; So, is anyone game to try to educate a polly or two?

I\'m game. Although I\'m not quite sure that politicians 
will be able to help as such. I don\'t believe they have 
anything to offer us. I do believe that marketing South 
Australia as a good place for I.T. based businesses will 
help our cause (ie, getting a job and *not* having to 
move to Sydney or Melbourne). I don\'t believe we have 
*any* hope in educating the abovementioned polly or two. 
Just looking at the Censorship stuff that they tried, 
they aren\'t interested in understanding the way things 
work at all. If we target the people who have what we 
want, I think we have a chance.

I suppose it all just depends on what people want. Does 
everyone want Adelaide and SA to stand out in the I.T. 
industry? How do people want to go about it? If we all 
want the same things, let\'s work out the best way of 
getting there.

Maybe I\'m wrong.....

Matt

P.S. I was a member of the Labour party for a couple of 
months until I realised I didn\'t have the time to do 
anything of any value and have no vested interest in any 
party or other such thing. ;-).
