&gt; &gt; The reason I am interested in them is that I am having problems with
&gt; &gt; email reliability.  There have been email messages I have sent,
&gt; &gt; which have not reached their destination (and no message back saying
&gt; &gt; "could not deliver").  There have also been email messages which
&gt; &gt; have not reached me.  It seems to only happen occasionally, but it
&gt; &gt; would be nice to know when it happens, especially for important
&gt; &gt; messages.  Email receipts would seem to be the answer.
&gt; 
&gt; How do you know that the e-mail has not been recieved?  A better way
&gt; of solving this problem might be to trace the SMTP path of the
&gt; message that you believe to be missing, and find out where the fault
&gt; is. You might find (as I often do) that "missing" e-mails are
&gt; usually just e-mail clients that store the messages somewhere weird,
&gt; or user error.

Yes I would like to try and "trace the SMTP path of the message".  How
do you do that?

To answer your question: I know the emails have not been received
because of discussions with the people concerned.  I do not know the
full extent of email losses, but at least in a few cases it has
occurred, and I have suspicions about other cases.  You are right in
suggesting that it might be email client error, or some such thing,
the problem is I simply don't know.


&gt; It's often better to investigate and solve a problem than to "embrace
&gt; and extend" a protocol to patch a symptom.

Yes, true enough.  But I think the idea of email receipts is more than
just a patch of a symptom.  Regardless of the cause, user error or
other, the fact is that some emails have not reached their intended
destination.  At the moment I have no way of knowing precisely when
this occurs.  Email receipts would tell me presisely when this problem
occurs.  Moreover, it would help me in the investigation of the
problem for I would know exactly which emails were going astray.


&gt; Let us know the specifics of the missing e-mail.

Well the main example is mailing to a friend in Canberra, email
address &lt;<A HREF="mailto:philster@ynz.com.au">philster@ynz.com.au</A>&gt;.  On at least one occasion, probably
two, he never received the email I sent him.  On other occasions the
email has got through.

The other example is from a different friend emailing to me.  She
claims to have sent me a couple of emails which I never received.  I'm
not sure how I can investigate this one.

There have also been cases of extended delays to and from my email
account, and _possible_ email losses.

Cheers,

Mark.
