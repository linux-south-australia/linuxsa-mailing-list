Not to be perfectly flippant, but you should send the boss to this URL:

* <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">http://www.netcraft.com/survey/</A>

Technically it's a web-server survey, but it might be worth pointing out
that 60% of those surveyed use some version of Apache on some version of
Unix. Another site that's worth taking a look at is:

* <A HREF="http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/">http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/</A>

Go to the Kirch paper. It's a well thought out critique of Windows NT
4.0.

You might also want to talk to SeNet who claim to be the largest ISP in
South Australia. I know that they run Linux and I've no doubt that
they'd provide some type of dissertation if you asked them nicely.
They've always been very helpful. You could also talk to David Newall
who runs my ISP.

I've no doubt that Windows NT could run your proxy server. Putting it
bluntly - and I am going to put my asbestos suit on here - I'd stick
with your bosses' idea. Let the boss install Windows NT. Let the system
fall over continuously and be quite inefficient. Just MAKE sure you are
the one who always fixes the problems.

Benefits?

* You look like the good guy
* You are kept in a job
* If you play your cards right, you get to say "I told you so..." when
the inevitable switchover happens
