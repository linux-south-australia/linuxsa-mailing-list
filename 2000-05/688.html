Hi...

&gt; Just to formalise my offer - I'm willing to help coordinate things, be a contact
&gt; point, help design T-shirts, run around setting up the venue, install, configure
&gt; and help out any way on the day and evangelise Linux and open source!  I might
&gt; even go and collect pizzas! :-)

Yes, I also would be willing to contribute to this extent.

&gt; How about we set up a web page for the event?  Even hook up an RDBMS so people
&gt; can pre-register?  On the day, when people turn up, we can enter details into
&gt; the database so we can assign the appropriate person to help them
&gt; install/configure/whatever and make sure someone doesn't get stuck in a corner
&gt; with a non-installing PC without someone who knows what they're doing.  The
&gt; installers can also register their skill set so matches can be easily made.

Hehehe... sounds cool.  If someone's willing to put in the effort.  ;-)

I reckon we can probably russle up a couple of hubs, a pile of BNC connectors,
cables (10Base-T and 10Base-2) etc.

A couple of things to consider:
1) I seriously doubt that we'll need 100 desks and 200 chairs.  It's possible
that 100 people may turn up to the event, but hopefully not all at once.  (I
assume it'd be a most-of-the-day thing).  But what we will need is a *lot* of
extension cords and power boards.
2) I'm sure this isn't a show-stopper, but just something to consider:  What
happens when someone brings in their machine that has 3 months of work on it
that hasn't been backed up and something goes horribly wrong and they lose all
their work?  Can we get people to sign a disclaimer before we start?  Something
to the effect of "I have backed up all my data and will not hold LinuxSA or any
of the event participants responsible for any data loss etc".

I like the idea of installers having t-shirts and accepting orders for t-shirts
on the day.  Or we could allow pre-ordering of t-shirts when installees register
in the RDBMS.  ;-)

Was the plan to charge an entry fee, or get sponsorship to cover costs?

In any case, there must be much pizza and caffeine.

And we'll probably want a couple of copies of Partition Magic.  Could be a good
candidate for donation from a computer store.  Or is everyone happy using fips?
