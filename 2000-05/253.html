&gt; hi
&gt; I am looking through the archives atm, after being away from this list
&gt; for 2 months, however can anyone help?
&gt; 
&gt; I have an interview with a NEIS business support provider tomorrow and

NEIS?

&gt; am trying to think of the best small business proposal to 
&gt; sell them on.
&gt; So this is just some last minute research.
&gt; 
&gt; I will be working with Linux and perhaps other open source 
&gt; OS's such as
&gt; FreeBSD, so...

I assume that what you are getting at is that you want to start a small
business based on Open Source Software


&gt; What type of small business is Adelaide crying out for in this field?
&gt; please keep in mind that i dont want to take anyone elses business, so
&gt; where are the niches
&gt; 
&gt; turnkey?
&gt; opensource (OS) support?
&gt; OS installs/ set-ups?
&gt; pre-installed computers?
&gt; after (someone elses) sale service?
&gt; cheap routers (based on Linux Router Project)?
&gt; Complete networks?
&gt; value for money hosting?
&gt; other ideas?

methinks that a mixture of turnkey and support would be worthwhile -- if you
could provide people with a "server service", which fulfills all the generic
office server functions, then you could do this quite effectively, while
keeping each machine pretty similar. They wouldn't need root access at all,
you would just provide them with a simple user management tool that does the
basics, and do everything else yourself... I have lots of ideas on how to do
this, but don't have time to expound on them here and now...

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; or would a completely different focus be better, eg:
&gt; 
&gt; contacting windows business users and converting them to OS?
&gt; introductory lessons for new users in their home?
&gt; Database, language or application consulting?
&gt; 
&gt; there must be a niche somewhere for me.

There probably is -- it's in your area of expertise. Start with what you can
do well, and see if there is a demand for those skills , perhaps in a
different format. If you can do everything well, then that's fine and good,
and you could go into anything...
