&gt; Well I don't think thats right, JavaScript is _not_ a Microsoft
&gt; invention, and I don't think it was Sun's idea either, it 
&gt; first appeared
&gt; in a Netscape Browser and Microsoft IE had to support it as 
&gt; it soared in
&gt; popularity.  I think if you need to blame anyone for 
&gt; JavaScript, is has
&gt; to be Netscape itself, and as far as standards go , I am pretty sure
&gt; there isn't one for JavaScript.

JaveScript was Netscape's idea, and was originally called LiveScript. It
changes it's name when Netscape decided that it was similar to Java and
realised that they could capitalise on Java's marketing by using the
name.... I'm pretty sure that the MS implementation is called JScript, and
isn't quite the same (I don't know if there is actually a standard for it, I
think it's as proprietry as VBScript, but it's more commonly implemented...)
Of course, I could be wrong in eavery way here, so feel free to correct
me...

As far as Java itself goes, IMHO, it's a good thing, but the combination of
Netscape, Java and Linux spells disaster zone... (in fact, combine any two
of those three, and the results are less than ideal (although that is
changing, wiht the sun/blackdown JDK1.2 on Linux and the tease of Netscape
6...)
