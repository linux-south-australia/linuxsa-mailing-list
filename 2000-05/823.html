&gt; With regards to David's announcement of the AUUG meeting and whether
&gt; the Installfest could be held Sat, 1 July:
&gt; 
&gt; There seems to be enough of interest from helpers to make this 
&gt; work.  The venue could be finalised by the end of this week without
&gt; any problem. 

potentially, it could be done, but we need to think about these issues as
well:

-- is it _worth_ rushing it so we can get these people along (will they
come, and will we (and newbies) get value from them?
-- will we be able to get sufficient publicitiy in 1 month to reach all the
people we can? Remember that if we can organise an Australia-wide event, it
would be good (I've emailed a few other LUGs to see what they are up to).
Also remember that if we have enough time, we coudl probably wangle a
mention in mainstream media, which would reach a far greater audience...
-- if we invite these people, it involves _extra_ organising, which puts
twice the pressure on us... I work full time, and have other commitments as
well, and aren't confident about doing it in one month in my spoare time (OI
was hoping to be able to use the Uinverity holidays to get some extra fre
time to put into it...)
-- Also, is that a suitable time for our target audience? I'm not sure how
it fits in with Uni exams and Holidays, etc... Is there a _more_ suitable
time a bit later on?

Personally, I am wary of rushing this too much, and would rather have more
time htan less -- we could make this really good if we put the effort in...
but if poeple think it's worht rushing, then maybe we shoudl give it a go,
but it would mean being basically organised by the end of next week....
IMHO... In fact, I'll mark below the ones I think would need to be done a
few weeks in advance with a #

&gt; *   Installation Media / Give-a-way CD's
&gt; 
&gt; I would suggest that whatever quantity of CD's we can get will be the
&gt; distribution that gets used.

yeah, but I think that getting smegloads of CDs isn't a huge problem... I
reckon we could choose pretty easily...

What do people think aobut timing?? (this question needs to be answered ASAP
if we are going to do it in July...)
