You don't have to buy an SSL Certificate. You can generate one yourself.
However, this means that you will only have the encryption functionality
of the Certificate - no site authentication will be possible. Also, some
browsers may not be able to use SSL Certificates that have not been
issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).

&gt; the web client can verify that the certificate is from you based on your IP
&gt; address or some such thing. 

Indeed, both server and client authentication is possible, although
server authentication is normally used. In order to buy a SSL
Certificate, you need to configure your web/SSL server, and generate a
key request, which you then send off to a CA. The key request includes
the fully qualified domain name, so a SSL Certificate for
www.somesite.com would be different to sales.somesite.com.
Authentication is not based on the IP, but rather by checking the
digital signature of the key issued by the web server with the CA.

See <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/security/sslin/index.htm">http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/security/sslin/index.htm</A>
for a good run-down of the process.

&gt; And that the Certificate is of sufficient length (128 bits
&gt; or more), the data is for all practical purposes non-decipherable.

Although, chances are most people outside of the US still have browsers
that will only support 40 bit encryption. &lt;opinion&gt; But that's still
pretty good for the non-ulta-paranoid. &lt;/opinion&gt;

Cheers,
