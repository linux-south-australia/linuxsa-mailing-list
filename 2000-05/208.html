 &gt; Sorry to harp on about this rather technical topic
 &gt; (i.e. programming), but....
 &gt; It's starting to look to me as though when you create a segment
 &gt; of shared memory in linux, if for any reason you don't get around
 &gt; to marking the memory as to-be-deleted when the program exits,
 &gt; then the memory will never be recovered (especially if you don't
 &gt; know what key was used).
 
"Never" is a rather strong word.

 &gt; This seems to mean that any program which uses shared memory 
 &gt; (and "top" indicates that essentially _every_ program does
 &gt; use shared memory) may, if it exits strangely, cause memory
 &gt; to be irretrievably lost.

Two points:  Yes, almost every program uses shared memory in some
way (for example, using mmap() to map shared libraries into an 
executable's address space), but all uses of shared memory don't
have the problem which you're alluding to.

SysV shared memory segments outlive the processes that created
them.  To me, this is a huge design wart, but I'm sure some SysV
people will be able to explain it away.  It's a departure from the
way that other resources are freed when the process that owns them
died, though, and can cause confusion like that which you're 
finding at the moment.

The words "never" and "irretrievably" are where you're going wrong
at the moment -- The "ipcs" command can list SysV shared memory 
segments, "ipcrm" can delete shared memory segments which you think
aren't in use anymore.

Finally, you're not irretrievably losing "memory" when you forget
to free a shared memory segment, you're losing page table entries
(like, yeah... who gives a rat's arse?).  If this is a problem for
you use ipcrm;  in practice it'll only affect you if the unfreed
segments exceed the system's limit on the maximum number of shared
memory segments, or the maximum amount of shared memory.

 &gt; This also means that any ordinary user can just run programs
 &gt; which gobble up shared memory until it's all gone, thereby
 &gt; hanging the system.

Not so -- Firstly, there are kernel limits on the amount of SysV
shared memory segments which are smaller than the amount of physical
RAM, and secondly shared memory is paged-in and paged-out just like
any other memory:  You seem to be under the misconception that 
shared memory segments are somehow wired in to physical memory, 
but I can assure you that they are not.  Assuming your kernel is
configured appropriately, there's nothing stopping you from allocating
128 Mbytes of shared memory on a 64 Mbyte system.

And, again, bear in mind that the discussion above only covers SysV
shared memory.  The BSD shared memory API (mmap(), mprotect(), madvise(),
etc) works in the way you'd expect a UNIX resource to work, and benefits
from a much better design (lower system call overhead, automatic
deallocation, and so on).

 &gt; I can hardly believe that linux (and System V generally)
 &gt; has been designed with this major vulnerability.

SysV had a lot of crap design go into it -- It's what happens when
you contrast the results of commercial expedience against the results
of open-sourced peer review.  If you want to see something worse,
try looking at the STREAMS/TLI network specification, or the lpsched
printer system.  Yukko.

 &gt; There seems to be no way to makr shared memory to be re-cycled
 &gt; when no process is using it, without also making the memory
 &gt; unusable by further process that do want to use it.

You haven't read enough manuals :-)

 &gt; My questions:
 &gt; 1.	Is the situation really so chaotic and clumsy
 &gt; 	as it seems to me?
 
It alsmost never is :-)

 &gt; PS. On the subject of the worm/virus "iloveyou",
 &gt; what I'd like to know is why people (e.g. reporters)
 &gt; do not immediately point the finger at Microsoft.

Because Microsoft is so good at muddying the waters.  Bill Gates 
contributed to this yesterday by releasing a statement calculated
to capitalize on the irrational hysteria which has built up over
the ILOVEYOU virus, saying that the world could expect more viruses
if the company was broken up.

Non-sequiturs make me eat lampshades.
