[TOP NOTE]
The general consensus is that my previous reply was a little too
arrogant or patronising and therefore I have decided to reword the reply
such that it contains no or little content that could be described by
either of these terms.
[END TOP NOTE]

Hi Carl!

&gt; I've just installed Linux on my PC.

Congratulations! I'm sure you won't look back!

&gt; little messing about I think I've got it. Having a history
&gt; in Macintosh and recently in Windows, Linux's way of
&gt; thinking is quite different.

I agree wholeheartedly. Naturally the best way to learn/see the
differences is to use the various operating systems which you have
and/or are just about to do/done. Might I suggest that there's a lot of
prewritten help for Linux and here are two commands you can use from the
linux command line to find some of it:

man [a command name]

(in an xterm or the command prompt, type man ls...you can also type man
-k [keryword])

Try this out!

You can also try using info [a command name]

&gt; Here's where I'm having
&gt; trouble...

Danger Will Robinson! [excuse my vague reference to Lost in Space, but
that's where I'm sure a lot of people think I am, so heh...put the sense
of humour on].

&gt; How do I setup and run Wine? (the Windows
&gt; emulator)

The short answer is that you obtain a stable (or development)
distribution of Wine, install it, setup an appropriate wine.conf
configuration file and type in wine [some windows.exe file]. There is a
LOT of documentation about Wine. I suggest that you visit
<A HREF="http://www.wine.org">http://www.wine.org</A> and take a look at just some of the documentation
there. Choose one that you can understand and have a go at setting it up
by yourself.

I have no doubts that something/all/none of it will work. But if you've
attempted to set it up to the best of your ability AND it then
subsequently doesn't work, you can report to us the configuration you
are using and any relevant error messages.

I might gently suggest getting used to Linux BEFORE you attempt to setup
Wine. You might like to research dual-booting with Windows if you still
need/require that operating system. Take a look at office products such
as Star Office (<A HREF="http://www.sun.com">http://www.sun.com</A> are its developers) if you need an
Office Like Application [tm]. In my opinion you'll understand Wine
errors/misconfigurations much better IF you have a reasonable base in
Linux.

&gt; and secondly, I cant seem to change the proxy
&gt; settings in the Netscape Communicator that came in the
&gt; distribution.

It's in edit-&gt;preferences-&gt;advanced-&gt;proxies. You probably want to set
them manually. Contact your ISP to find out what the settings should be.
I presume from your statement you actually already know them...

&gt; I have tried CorelLINUX 1.1 and I currently
&gt; have Mandrake 5.2 installed with the KDE GUI. I have setup
&gt; the PPP dialer and the modem is connecting fine to the ISP,
&gt; but Netscape, or any other mail or browser isn't talking to
&gt; the ISP. Hope someone can help me.

I'm not familiar with the PPP dialer that you are talking about. I
assume that you mean kppp (which is the KDE PPP dialer). I have come to
the conclusion that you may have the following problem:

"You are not able to resolve DNS Names"

I'm not going to give a textual explanation of what THIS means. Try
this:

1) connect to your ISP
2) type in 203.20.69.66 in a web browser such as netscape (i.e. go to
that address...you can prepend <A HREF="http://">http://</A>)

You should see rebel or tellurian's home page.

If you DON'T then the problem I've stated may not be your ONLY problem.

Now, type in www.rebel.net.au in the address bar. If your browser hangs
or says it can't resolve names then you are not able to resolve DNS
names. Your computer - which uses numerical addresses - can't work out
how to resolve/figure out/deduce that www.rebel.net.au is the same
address as 203.20.69.66.

If you think that this is your problem the easiest way out of it is
actually to log in as root and manually edit a file called
"/etc/resolv.conf". Try using emacs or vi....

i.e.

#&gt; emacs /etc/resolv.conf

NOTE that your command prompt probably looks different.

Add a line similar to the following:

nameserver 203.20.69.2

YOU MUST SUBSTITUTE THE IP ADDRESS OF YOUR ISP'S NAME SERVER for the IP
address (the numbers!) above.

Save the file. And try looking up www.rebel.net.au or www.linuxsa.org.au
again. Hopefully it works. Note that if you start emacs in an X Window
you should be able to use the mouse to operate its menus :-)) (man
emacs...it's a complex program and some say it's an operating system
itself!)

HOWEVER, if this isn't your problem...check the following:

1) When you dial in, how long does the "OH" light stay on

Look at your log file. It's in /var/log/messages. A command called
"tail" will show you the last few lines of the log file (man tail to
find out more). You can do:

tail /var/log/messages

You'll probably need to login as root to do it. If you see an
"authentication" error, it's generally because your ISP requires PAP 
(or other type of) authentication but you've either:

* got a wrong username or password
* not setup the dialer to use PAP authentication

Consult the manual pages on how to setup PAP authentication...you may
need to contact your ISP's support service to work out what
authentication you need. Please note that most ISP's require at least
PAP...

If that doesn't appear to be the problem, give us a dump of
/var/log/messages....

Have a good day!
