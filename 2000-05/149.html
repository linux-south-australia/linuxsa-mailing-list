Phil and Eugene and the Others!

&gt; Do you believe in God?

Given the "Virgin Mary Debate [tm]", successfully created by David and
David LN [tm], I do believe in God. It would be illogical not to after
such a long, protracted debate which essentially was discussing people's
sensitivies.

&gt; If so I suggest you seek out an old looking
&gt; building with a point roof & a cross shaped thing on top.

I have seen some very modern, although hideous in my opinion, buildings
of suck ilk that are defined as churches. Please, feel free to enter
into that type of building ESPECIALLY if you can't cope with incense.
Older buildings are more statistically likely to use incense.

&gt; Upon entering
&gt; said building, drop to your knees and chant the following:

There is almost no requirement in the Christian God's bible or even
church's teachings for you to kneel. Please note, though, that kneeling,
washing one's self thoroughly, having a peaceful mind AND facing Mecca
will appeal to the greatest variety of "Christian Like" Gods. "Christian
Like" as in Jesus, His Father, Allah (Islamic), the Mormon's God and
such.

There is much new age literature if you choose to go the Wiccan way.
BEWARE, sacrificing your HDD may NOT recover it. I am told the Wiccan
Goddess is just as liable to be as unforgiving of such as silly act as
the more traditional, Christian Like Gods.

&gt; [Insert name of religious diety you support] forgive me for I have
&gt; sinned greatly. I have permitted M$FAT16-Evil to infect my sacrosanct
&gt; Linux partitions.

Might I suggest that you could call God, "Linus"? Given that most
religions - and I say most - bring you to the state of being at one with
God (atonement = at one moment with) or your concept of God - who is all
and will be all, surely the creator of the sacrosanct Linux partitions
should be the one deemed responsible for answering Linux type questions.

Maybe I should suggest to His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, that he
should elevate Linus to the status of Saint or Daemon, Patron of all
Free and Just Operating Systems?

The truth of the matter is that once I see a hard drive hiccough for
whatever reason I become very, very suspicious of all my hardware. The
whole lot gets marked as "replace as soon as possible". Acting
religiously to any God - even Linus - is no susbstitute for good, human
fix ups.

I agree with Phil and the others.

Replace the hard drive AND quick.

DAVID

[incidentally, why is it that warped senses of humour such as mine are
so commonly misunderstood?]
