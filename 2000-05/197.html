You may have seen it before but it is still worth a read.



UNIX Airways

Everyone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the 
airport.  They all go out on the runway and put the plane together
piece
by piece, arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed
to be
building.

Air DOS

Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and
let the plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push
again,
jump on again, and so on ...

Mac Airlines

All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look
and  act exactly the same.  Every time you ask questions about details,
you
are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to
know,
and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know,
so
just shut up.

Windows Air

The terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy
baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off.  After about 10
minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever.

Windows NT Air

Just like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and
takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it
explodes.

Linux Air

Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start
their own airline.  They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave
the
runways themselves.  They charge a small fee to cover the cost of
printing the
ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself.  When
you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a
copy of the seat-HOWTO.html.  Once settled, the fully adjustable seat
is very
comfortable, the plane   leaves and arrives on time without a single
problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful.  You try to tell customers of
the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, "You
had to do
what with the seat?"
