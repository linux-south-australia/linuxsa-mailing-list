Interesting. I had to go and have a look after your use of the phrase
"Bastion Firewall".

Normally it's a Bastion Host - a bastion being a specially fortified
part of a castle. Thus a Bastion Host being a specially
installed/fortified server - one that has the services that the world
has to be able to see on it (like email and web services), but nothing
else (like your in-house accounting package).

At a quick glance, it looks like a reasonable article, and, I suppose, a
firewall should be configured as a kind of "Bastion Host" - one where
the only service it provides is firewalling :-)

If you're really interested in firewalls, and how to set them up, the
O'Reilly book on Internet Firewalls (Ooh! New edition:
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/fire2/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/fire2/</A>) is outstanding.

(And yes, David D - I know the copy I have isn't mine, but no one has
asked for it back yet :-)
