&gt; [1] One thing that people, who have attended install fests 
&gt; before or have
&gt; installed Linux on their own, have said to me is "Well, I 
&gt; loaded it - it
&gt; looks good, but how {do I install apps | fix the broken links 
&gt; | get updates
&gt; | connect to my ISP | what are these "tar" things and how do 
&gt; I install them,
&gt; etc}".  What they seem to want is, for want of a better term, a
&gt; "Config-fest" so that they feel comfortable with Linux.

I don't see why we can't offer to do this at the same time -- it would fit
in well with the general aims of the event, and would show newbies that they
have a place to go for help when things get tough...

&gt; [2] With StarOffice a "freebie", should we perhaps offer this 
&gt; as an extra
&gt; installation for those who want to try an alternative to the 
&gt; competition?

What do people think about this -- I see no reason why we can't install
StarOffice, WordPerfect 8, whatever else people want, as long as it's
free... Obviously, these aren't OpenSource, but they are practically
neccessary tools for anyone wanting to replace Windows with an OpenSource
system

&gt; [3] Whilst not wanting to start a religious war, having 
&gt; observed people
&gt; (some quite pc literate) trying out different flavours of 
&gt; Linux, my current
&gt; {personal} recommendation is Caldera, then Redhat|Mandrake then other
&gt; flavours as the user educates themself.  Why not have pc with 
&gt; each of the
&gt; "supported" distributions set-up so that newbies (and not so 
&gt; new) can have a
&gt; quick look at each one.

I really like that idea -- if anyone knows of any PC retailers or
wholesalers who would be interesteed in donating (say) 10 idenical PCs, we
could have some basic demo boxes (we could use people's home machines, but
that means that the impression people will get of a distro will be tainted
by how good that user's PC is, and how much time they have spent customising
their setup -- if we show them what they will get, it will be better...)

I will contact Hallmark Computers to see if they are interested in being
involved in this manner, and if anyone else wants to contact some other
source, please feel free (but tell the list first so we don't all call A&R
at once or something... :)

&gt; [4] Having had my say, I would normally offer my services (hey - I can
&gt; always stand there and make real coffee) but unfortunately 
&gt; I'll be in Sydney
&gt; from early June until early Oct working (in a technical 
&gt; capacity) on the
&gt; Olympics.  If I'm able (read allowed), I'll try and get some 
&gt; behind the
&gt; scenes info and photos for a talk when I get back - if anyone 
&gt; is interested.

enjoy the olympics... :) I'm hoping SLUG wil be organising an installfest at
around the same time (still awaiting confirmation), so maybe you want to get
in touch with them... 

Thanks for the input...
