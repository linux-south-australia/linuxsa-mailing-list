&gt;
&gt;Software licensing costs are a minimal tax-deductible portion of IT
&gt;expenditure. IT users spend the least amount they can here to obtain maximum
&gt;benefit. At most of the clients I've been to, the expenditure of around $250
&gt;per annum (Select pricing averaged over the two-three year lifespan) per
&gt;desktop on software is completely minimal compared to the income derived
&gt;from the employee (my last client: about $650,000 pa). If training costs of
&gt;(say) $1250 for a two day course to introduce FrizzleWord 23 per employee is
&gt;compared to spending nothing on training and $250 for the next version, you
&gt;can guess what's going to happen.
&gt;
&gt;In the early 90's most temp agencies supplied people proficient with Word
&gt;Perfect. If you didn't have WP, you couldn't use most temp agencies for
&gt;overflow work. Today, the situation is similar wrt Word, Excel, etc.
&gt;Companies do not like taking risks when it comes to using additional staff
&gt;that might cost extra. For example, try and find a contract tech writer who
&gt;is proficient in the superior and more flexible Adobe Framemaker, and then
&gt;do the same costing for a person proficient with Word, and the Word person
&gt;will be a lot cheaper due to more people with that skillset. To
&gt;beancounters, this sort of argument will win out everytime, regardless that
&gt;the Frame person will likely be faster, and the resulting document more
&gt;cohesive and with accurate indexes and so on for the end users.
&gt;
&gt;At most of my clients, the IT function is outsourced, and a visit to reload
&gt;the desktop (regardless of OS: we had several choices based upon make and
&gt;type) was about $250, which is roughly the price you'd expect if you treat
&gt;your time as worth something.
&gt;
&gt;For server tasks, you use the servers that accomplish the business function
&gt;first and platform ideology second. If a server can do tasks a,b,c and do it
&gt;well, then you should use it. If another server comes along that just
&gt;happens to be "free" (as in cost, not "libre"/freedom) and it does a,b,c
&gt;well, then maybe at the next time it comes time for an upgrade or a new
&gt;server, then you should use it. But if you need to do a,b,c, and d, and the
&gt;free version can only do a,b,c then you are costing your company money
&gt;whilst you work around the platform limitations. That's not smart.
&gt;
&gt;For example, Stuart Edwards stated that Active Directory is equivalent to
&gt;Samba + Unix backend. It's not. AD is a directory, not a file store. In
&gt;combination with Win2K Server and clients, AD enables companies to reduce
&gt;the most significant costs associated with desktops: support. AD enables
&gt;remote automated software distribution, remote management (client and
&gt;server), large scale object management, file replication, fast diskless
&gt;automated client installs, global and local lockdowns, enforced security
&gt;policy, reduced WAN costs through more efficient object replication and so
&gt;on. IT users deploying Active Directory over a Samba (or NT 4.0) solution
&gt;will save money, even though Samba costs $0 and AD costs money because the
&gt;support costs are far more than the licensing costs, not to mention the WAN
&gt;savings. And again, the licensing costs are tax deductible.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, Microsoft are abusing their monopoly position to increase revenue from
&gt;traditionally friendly corporates, and expect them to voice their
&gt;displeasure, but realistically, MS desktop and server products are still
&gt;cheaper and more functional than the "free" competiton.
&gt;
&gt;For example, an Exchange server in a small-medium business (single site,
&gt;less than 400 employees) will take approximately 10 minutes to set up. The
&gt;last time I munged through a sendmail compile + m4 munge, it took me more
&gt;than 10 minutes. Try it yourself and see how long it takes to get a workable
&gt;sendmail 8.12 beta10 install going, or if you believe that comparing beta
&gt;software to release sofware is wrong, try sendmail 8.11.4 instead.
&gt;
&gt;Exchange server has more functionality out of the box than sendmail +
&gt;openldap + Cyrus IMAP + PAM LDAP + LDAP gui, and far greater reliability,
&gt;including transaction rollback etc. Exchange costs a goodly sum of money,
&gt;but its administration costs are fairly minimal and can be maintained by a
&gt;monkey, which is unfortunately often the case. But Exchange makes good
&gt;business sense rather than good platform ideology sense. If the "free"
&gt;software camp seriously wish to change this, they must make stuff as easy to
&gt;install, administrate, use and functional as Microsoft do today. It's no
&gt;good slagging software with unsubstantiated rumors as to its reliability,
&gt;scalability, etc.
