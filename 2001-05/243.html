Hmmm...

&gt; I am looking at the potential for 'office' staff to maintain a complex
&gt; tecnical document with something like Lyx or OpenOffice ...

The only problem is that things like StarOffice/OpenOffice and Microsoft
Word rely on the format, and not the content of the document. Hence you
can specify to the hundredth of a degree what heading one's will look
like, but they have no "document object model" and can be difficult to
work with programatically.

&gt; What would be good is if Lyx could understand stylesheets ...

LyX says that it is a "What You Say is What You Mean" editor. It was
never meant to render a document perfectly. On the other hand, what I
think you are saying is that you wish it would understand DTD's (such as
DocBook, MathML et al) and have some "point and click" or "drag combo
box down" method of adding in your tags.

I can't see why it _couldn't_ and I suppose someone (not me) could patch
in some code to do it.

&gt; However, another question is: Can you ever trust 'office' staff with no
&gt; knowledge of technical matters within 20 metres of a technical document?

To ensure that it doesn't fall apart, doesn't become unmaintainable,
yes. To add stuff hacked together by the technical team, yes. To write
the technical stuff, hmmm :-P
