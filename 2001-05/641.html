I've seen a few.

Me, Nick Morrison, for example, has been known as:

  morrisn
  nickm
  nmorrison
  morrinl
  nickelodeon
  nick.morrison
  stimpy

etc.

I've seen (I can't bloody remember where) a document arguing that
because of limiting factors such as "there will ALWAYS be two users
sharing the same name", you should have no 'standard' for naming
users.

You could conceivably let them choose their own usernames!  That's
certainly how I prefer it...

My suggestion: be as liberated as you can, considering (obviously)
the boss's perceptions :)

Other things to consider:  Do you care what the usernames are?
What will you use them for?  With a properly structured group and
alias system, you should seldom need to refer to users by their
username...  Do users care what their usernames are?  Does the
boss?

When I log on, I like to use as few characters in my username as
possible.. so I always try for "nickm" :)  (plus nickm sounds kinda
cool)


So - if you structure it properly - ie, never make the username the only
way to find a user - always record the person's full name and department
or office alongside it (/etc/passwd supports this, so does LDAP, so does
MS)

Remember the purpose of a username.  not that I know what it is... 
but I know what it isn't!  It isn't:  - a way to record the user's name,
- a way to record the user's function (often), - a way to record where
the user is...

But, that said, it all varies anyway, so I'll conclude by saying
"It's All Relative" ;)



Blah blah blah.

&gt; Guys, I need some opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know what some of you use as your username 
&gt; conventions.
&gt; 
&gt; There's a company wide "Organization" thing happening here 
&gt; and there's a
&gt; bunch of restructures involved in our IT department, and 
&gt; we're changing
&gt; our organization from being based around a little company with a few
&gt; people (where standardizations are less important) to a larger growing
&gt; company with standards in place.
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to get some opinions of what people are using 
&gt; out there in
&gt; the big wide world.
&gt;
