&gt; Alternatively, you might want to try Tom's Root Disk. I use it a fair bit,
&gt; and it is a great little disk. If you can't find it, I could probably find a
&gt; .zip of it somewhere that I can send to you.
&lt;snip&gt;

This is perhaps an overkill but the most usefull rescue disk I have ever
seen and used is HPA's super rescue cd. (from the guy who wrote
syslinux).  You can find it here:

<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/dist/superrescue/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/dist/superrescue/</A>

Unfortunatly that part of the kernel.org tree isn't mirrored by aarnet.

It's an entire redhat installation modified to work from a cd, with etc
and the like on a ramdisk. If you grab the image and burn it you can
boot a fully functional redhat installation and have more tools that you
can imagine for working out what is where on your system and fixing it.
I have found Toms root boot is a bit old and the version of lilo on it
couldn't support the hardware in some of my systems here, but the super
rescue cd hasn't let me down yet. (of course toms has the advange of
downloading over a modem in a couple of mins, where as a 477mb iso may
take a little longer :)
