&gt; But hang on, where are you putting the digital modems? Normally, you would

Looking at Cisco 3661. It has ethernet and 6 expansion slots. Digital
modem cards as well as PRI interfaces are optional modules that can be
added (albiet at a price).

&gt; Anyway, why don't you look into Telstra's Dial-Connect, and then just bring
&gt; one 2Mbps frame relay or some such into your premises.

Could this 'Dial-Connect' service be what is on their website as 'Dial
IP'. It seems to me that it's a 'Virtual ISP' type of arrangement,
except, not :-) 
They tunnel the dialup users to your network from which they can go out
onto the Internet using your link.

Seems almost like paying twice to me. I wonder if it would be acceptable
for the tunnel to go through a current Internet connection rather than a
Frame Relay connection. Being a school, the cost of Frame Relay is
somewhat of an issue.

&gt; You could even then use Linux with a Sangoma Frame Relay card ...

Maybe, though it'd not be after a hell of a lot of reassurance that that
card and its drivers are stable enough to be the core of a dialup pool.
