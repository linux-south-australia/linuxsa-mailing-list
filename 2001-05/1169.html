Hmmmm...

&gt; I still can't believe that he said that.  He's got to be trolling.  He's
&gt; one of the first to cry, "RTFM!"

I have approximately 2500 messages in my trash folder which is about 2
to 5 days' worth depending on what day it is. Having searched for:

"sender=lloy0076" AND "body contains minute"

I can't see any particular place where I said "5 minutes". What I did
say was:

"
a) it's online
b) it's fantastically long
c) it's simpler to ask when something seems to malfunction when it
shouldn't
"

I had sincerely convinced myself that bash wasn't doing "vi" mode
properly. Having discovered that readline apparently does the actual vi
emulation, and that it automatically puts you into insert mode AND that
I was expecting vi mode to put me into command mode immediately after I
said "set -o vi" { don't even think about flaming me on that one - I am
describing how I thought }, I was a little uncertain about whether vi
mode was working and so I posted a question to the mailing list.

So, it's far simpler to ask when something seems to malfunction when it
shouldn't on a mailing list. With a few tips from various people on the
list I've discovered what I was doing wrong and fixed it.

Conclusions:

1) I pointed out a legitimate time to start asking others (mailing
list/local guru etc) rather than read the man pages
 - I knew how to get FreeBSD's default shell into vi mode and presumed
that it would be the same for bash
 - That is to say I had an idea already of what I was doing and wanted
to to do

2) I did NOT say that I wouldn't take 5 minutes to read a manual

:-P
