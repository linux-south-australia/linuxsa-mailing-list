&gt; And while I am writing I might aswell ask, how is Redhat 7.1 on the playing
&gt; field in terms of 'net' servers, I heard some pretty bad stuff about 7.0 and
&gt; thus stuck with 6.2, I am most likely going to be building serveral
&gt; webservers over the next few months, should I move to 7.1 or stick with 6.2
&gt; and all the RPM updates???

An x.0 release should always be approached with caution.

Red Hat 7.1 seems fine.  Running the 2.4 kernel is a boon.
With 7.0 if you needed to recompile the kernel to gain
some extra features you were a bit stuck.

The 2.4 kernel does require more swap space.  If you
can sort this out before the upgrade by increasing the
size of the swap partition to double or triple the amount
of RAM.  This is pretty much in line with other Unixen.
You can have a swap partition bigger than 128MB in 6.2,
the excess simply isn't used.

The upgrade process does let you create a swap *file*.
This is slower than a swap partition, and the permissions
of the swap file are too liberal.

Red Hat have also done a decent job of getting the 2.4
user space programs to work right.  Thus although the
standard Red Hat kernel doesn't come with LVM, if you
rebuild a kernel then the user space tools in the
lnm-*.rpm work fine.  Similarly for QoS, rate limiting,
iptables, devfs, etc.  The init scripts also support
the new 2.4 features.

If moving from 6.2 you need to watch the .rpmnew and
.rpmsave files.  Red Hat seem to be adopting the
standard filesystem layout and some of the 7-series
upgrades move to this.  Notable is /home/httpd to
/var/www.

The X server also changes.  There seems to be a
fair bit of backward compatibility here.  Ironically
this isn't a good idea as you're never sure if you
are using XFree 3.3 or 4.0.  It's worthwhile backing
up XF86Config, deleting it and running Xconfigurator again.

They've buggered about with the fonts again.
Still not right :-(

The DocBook disaster has been sorted.  SGML DTDs
now install correctly and catalogs are correctly
maintained.

In 7, xinetd replaces inetd.  This is a good thing.
hosts.allow still works in addition to the xinetd
access lists.

The PAM configurations have be re-done and now
all point to a common PAM file, making changing
authentication methods (to NIS or LDAP or
whatever) much more certain.

In short, the 7-series seems to be a stability
release.  I imagine that an 8-series will appear
with devfs, root disk LVM and the other nice but
less compatible stuff out of 2.4.
