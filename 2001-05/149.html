Michael,

There's often been discussion of this over the years.
The arguments against permitting auth/ident access
are that it permits, like finger, the discovery of
user names on a remote machine, and tha means that remote
users could use the names to help in login attempts
with guessed passwords, or it could help in assembling
spam lists.

I haven't permitted ident for a few years.
But with my old default-accept firewall scripts,
the absence of ident in my /etc/inetd.conf file
(or whatever) meant that the kernel generated a 
TCP reset-packet in reponse to any SYN to that port.
That speeds up sendmail's sending to your machine.

I my current default-drop scripts, I found that
remote MTAs were generating several lines in my log file
every time I was receiving e-mail. That slows down e-mail
and wastes space in the log files. (And my time/effort while
I check to see if it's a hack attempt.)

So now I put a non-logging reject rule in my firewall script
for the ident port.
I think that this generates an ICMP packet response to the sender
rather than a TCP reset-packet.
But for most set-ups, this should have the same effect.

In purely protocol-theoretic terms, I think the "best"
solution is to not use ident at all, and let the kernel
generate the TCP reset-packet. But that's more bother,
and the result is about the same.
So I'd just firewall it out with a non-logging reject target.
Then you can still use ident locally on your LAN.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
