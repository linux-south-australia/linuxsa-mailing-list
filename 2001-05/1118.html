&gt; Hi list, font of all knowledge.
&gt; 
&gt; I have got to the stage with my system (Manduck 7.2) where it is time to
&gt; do a major refresh, and I seek some input from those with current
&gt; knowledge and recent experience. The need for refresh happens when so
&gt; many feral patches and non-standard updates have been applied that the
&gt; rpms for security updates constantly whine about broken (pah!)
&gt; dependencies etc etc. and eventually fail to load (Oh how I long for the
&gt; Slackware tarball days when I ran my own system and owned all the
&gt; decisions, but I digress...)

Perhaps something like FreeBSD (or any other BSD) would more suit you.
:-)

&gt; I have not seen a local review of Manduck 8.0. Any horror stories or
&gt; recommendations?

It's very nice. The install is a fair bit better, it supports ReiserFS
better, it comes with a 2.4.x kernel....

I wouldn't recommend using Nautilus unless you have a heap of system
resources to throw at eye candy (but it is *nice* eye candy).

&gt; Also, while I am at it, I must report the imminent demise of my once
&gt; trusty ex-Micro-arts box. Like george washington's axe it has had six
&gt; new handles and three new heads, but apart from that it is still the
&gt; same opld 486 i bought many years aog in Melb. (Actually it is now a
&gt; 6x86 PR200 in a Rhino 12+ MB with so many bits I ca't keep track of
&gt; them... but again I digress...) This old box is now greeting me with an
&gt; annoying beeeep beeep beeep on applying power 4 time out of 5, so I
&gt; guess it is time to finally look for a replacement. Any strong
&gt; recommendations re a desktop replacement box (strictly Linux only OS)
&gt; would be gratefully received.

All of my boxes start out as butchered old machines and usually turn
into unix machines with whatever hardware I can find lying around the
place.

HIHelps,
Matt
