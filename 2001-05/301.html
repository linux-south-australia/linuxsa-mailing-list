ADSL has been down since about 6 am this morning according to my log files.
The recorded message on the Bigpond support number says something similar.

Andrew,

My 2nd hand experience is that cable was fine till it got over-subscribed
which is consistent with what you say Andrew. Although recently a lot of
people have been going onto the DOCSIS network which require a different
(DOCSIS) modem. Their subsequent responce times have improved by an order
of magnitude. 

I don't want to get locked into a service which is going to degrade as it
did in the east people were suffering for months waiting for upgrade to
services to cope with the load.

Incidently I dont think optus ever suffered the problem Telstra did. As I
have friends on both and OPtus people were always wrapped with their
connection.

&gt;&gt; It seems attractive more so than ADSL at this point. Any opinions?
&gt;
&gt;If the Telstra/Optus cable services in other states are anything to go
&gt;by, I'd completely disagree.
&gt;
&gt;Once the cable service gets particularly popular, you've got a lot of
&gt;data moving through the network. My understanding is that Telstra/Optus
&gt;provided these services, but didn't upgrade the cable network to
&gt;accomodate for the extra traffic.

&gt;
&gt;The link between the 'Cable Users' and 'Telstra/Optus Network' has got
&gt;extremely congested. This meant that when you got home at 6pm, you'd
&gt;have nice long ping times and slow access.
&gt;
&gt;I'd be more likely to lean to ADSL. It's more likely to be taken
&gt;seriously by the providers.
