Yep, agreed. That's why I go with the backup system that is proven to
be as good as disk drives... Disk drives, located on another computer.

Then onto tape if anyone still cares.

This also lets you do an interesting little trick which I found useful.

If you copy the files across, you have a live filesystem which you can
chroot into. This lets you test out the real effect that a change would
have on the backed up machine, including all the modifications that you
didn't know about.

Instead of going "Umm, I remember that inetd was like that, so it should
do that...", you can do a backup, hop across and chroot into the backup,
then do the change. That way, you'll find out when Junior Admin has been
playing outside of his sandpit.

If you want to test out a more significant change, you can get more real
by rebooting into the backup filesystem. This needs a machine with the
exact same configuration, and make sure you disconnect the network cable
first to prevent duplicate IPs.

If you want to show off and you've done a complete backup, you could pull
the main machine's plug out just as the backup is finishing its reboot.
Then you've done a replacement in 1 second flat! (then point somewhere
else while you wait for the ARP refresh :)

When it's time for the next backup, you can "tar | bzip2 -9" the old
backup and really crunch the bugger down. This has the added benefit
of making a transfer to tape a quick copy, and lets you store many
more archival (not real) backups onto each tape.

It even scales up to RAID capacities. I used this technique on full
StorageWorks cabinets, and it worked very well through numerous stuff
ups and other problems caused by junior sysadmins.

It was a right game, writing tools to check our juniors. :)

Disk drives are a really good first stage backup device.
