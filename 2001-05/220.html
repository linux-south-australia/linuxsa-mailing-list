&gt;&gt; Companies are not moral entities, so, why should we expect them to engage
&gt;&gt; in moral behaviour?  Indeed, their very structure, and companies law in
&gt;&gt; most western countries, force amoral behaviour on all companies, and to
&gt;&gt; succeed, they must act amorally.  For example, it is immoral, and illegal
&gt;&gt; to kill someone. It is expected and required behaviour of a company to
&gt;&gt; destroy (kill) their competition.
&gt;
&gt;It's hardly a comparison. Without competition, you don't have business.

Ummm, without competition, you have a wonderful thing called a monopoly. 

&gt;People would go out of business. 

Umm, why do you think Microsoft is so interested in maintaining its monopoly.

Competition, from a businesses point of view, is bad! It reduces their
market share, which reduces revenue, and forces up their expenses, because
they have to do more product development and spend more on advertising and
other competitive activities.  Both of these affect the bottom line in
negative ways.

I cannot believe that you can have said the above. There is abundant
evidence that business does not like competition. We have the ACCC which
has laws against price fixing for example.  These laws were not enacted
because our kind and benevolent government was worries about the remote
possibility that our competition loving business community might one day,
possibly, mistakenly engage in price fixing behaviour!

When competition gets too tough, competitors merge. One of the main
advantages of this is reduction in competition, but it also has other
advantages to companies. Guess what, we also have laws about mergers that
are bad for the community by reducing competition. Again, these laws were
enacted after many years of experience with real businesses.

&gt;                                Killing people and killing companies
&gt;through providing a superiour service (or claiming to) are two different
&gt;things.

Ummm, Glen has already complained that Microsoft's product, for example, is
not superiour the the historical alternatives.

Superiour products and superior service are, historically, not the most
important, unless you have a stable environment with a few competitors, and
they all tend to have the same level of service to maintain their market
share.

History is littered with cases where the superior product did not make it.
Think Beta, think Motorola 68000, think Macintosh ...

&gt;&gt; We, as a group of societies, must decide whether or not this is acceptible,
&gt;&gt; or not, and act appropriately.  It seems to me that the majority of people
&gt;&gt; would be unhappy if they realized that companies not only are not moral
&gt;&gt; entities, they are actually required to act amorally.
&gt;
&gt;It's a double standard, though. Companies are expected to do there very
&gt;best to wipe out the competition, but they're expected to do this in a
&gt;moral mannar. "Do something that some may consider amoral, but make sure
&gt;you do it morally".
&gt;
&gt;Personally, I can't see the point in arguing this topic -- it's a fact
&gt;of life. It's how business works. If we all suddenly decide that trying
&gt;to take out the competition is bad and we shouldn't do it, we'll have a
&gt;colapsing business world.
&gt;
&gt;Take Internode, Picknowl or any other serious ISP. To stay in business,
&gt;they've got to offer a service that is more attractive than what "the
&gt;other guy" is offering. The fact that this results in other ISPs loosing
&gt;market share (and consequently money) is frankly, irrelevant.
&gt;
&gt;To keep everyone in "check", you need the competitors. Some will find
&gt;one offering better than the other, hence things are ballanced out.


Balance is very important, and competition is very important, but I would
suggest not for the reasons you advance.

Compentition is of most benefit to consumers and society, not to
businesses. Competition keeps business lean and efficient, but if they had
no competition, they would not need to be lean and efficient, and they
would be happy.

On the other hand, competition delivers prices to consumers that are close
to the lowest possible, however, too much competition can drive prices up
again, because the there is a cost to competing. So, we need a balance of
competition.

Secondly, competition increases employment, since each of these competitors
need to duplicate functions, and a natural consequence of any merger is to
shed employees. So society benefits from competition because there are more
gainfully employed people and less trouble makers :-)

Now, I'm off to find a monopoly that no one has discovered yet :-) Hmmm,
perhaps magnetic monopoles would do the trick.
