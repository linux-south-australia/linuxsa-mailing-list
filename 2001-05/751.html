&gt; 1. I am no ssh guru but on establisihing a session there is a minor lag in
&gt; key establishment but I wouldnt expect it to be noticeable.

On machines with slower CPUs it connects faster, so I think it's close to
being a NIC issue.

&gt; 2. Have you run tcpdump from a terminal window and just looked at how the
&gt; traffic was flowing? Was there noticeable lag between packets going from
&gt; one box to the celeron?
&gt; 
&gt; Depending of course on the volume of traffic you may need to filter things
&gt; so you can see it. 
&gt; Is the network switched? if so you may be ok in terms of noise traffic. 

It is a switched network, but the other Linux machines perform better.

Another problem is it doesn't happen that often which makes it more
annoying :), so I will setup a tcpdump &gt;&gt; some.log.file and when I do
see it happening I can note the time and then investigate the logs.

&gt; you may want to monitor each nic to see if one is interfering with the
&gt; other. (I have seen other devices sharing the same IRQ which resulted in
&gt; similar behaviour as they each took their turn.) You may want to check the
&gt; configs on the cards.

Ever since I found out the 8139 cards are very bad (even though they
have performed perfectly for me over the years), I've wanted to upgrade
all my machines to use a decent 3com card. So that is something I might
do anyway...

I'll see how I go, thanks for your help.
