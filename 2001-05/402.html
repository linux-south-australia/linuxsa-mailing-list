&gt; Cable is definately avaiable in SA.
&gt; 
&gt; We ordered it last Thurs and had it installed yesterday.
&gt; Not bad for a Telstra service.
&gt; 
&gt; I have not got it going with Linux yet, but I beleive there is a project
&gt; at sourceforge for the appropriate client for many operating systems.
&gt; 
&gt; The guy who installed it was not all that PC savvy and inssited I installt
&gt; eh telstra network card, even thought the problem he had installing it was
&gt; not host related.
&gt; 
&gt; In any case it was in and going within two hours including the install of
&gt; the cable form the street.
&gt; 
&gt; I tired to get it going under mac OS 9.x on a friends G3 laptop last night
&gt; and could not, but we didnt bother chasing tech support, because our phone
&gt; was not on yet.
&gt; The Mac software just could not connect.
&gt; *shrug*
&gt; 
&gt; We're at Mile End, I have other friends who have it at
&gt; Seacombe Heights.
&gt; 
&gt; Check out the web site I think it can tell you more or less straight away
&gt; if you can apply.
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure if that means you can defiantely get it, but I assume it
&gt; means it is avaialbe in your area/street at least.
&gt; 
&gt; With the plan we have it is a little cheaper than adsl, the latency
&gt; appears to be better, generally the download is in the region of 60KB+ per
&gt; second.
&gt; 
&gt; The infamous AUP applies for the plan we are on. You can have up to 2
&gt; extra users on that plan - the only restricton that annoys me about it is
&gt; that no servers restriction, but that is not really a huge issue, as I
&gt; dont NEED a server and the flat rate price more than makes up.

Why wouldn't the AUP apply to your plan. Or for that matter, any plan.
Without it, I could sit for weeks copying AARNet &gt;/dev/null and Telstra
wouldn't be able to do anything about it.[1]

&gt; It is slightly cheaper than telstra adsl, I think we pay $72 per month for
&gt; the base account and $11 per month for each of the two additonal
&gt; simultaneous users.

Why not go with Internode ADSL? I don't work for them, but there a
hellava lot better than Telstra on multiple counts. You're allowed to
run servers, they encourage NAT devices (and hence more users). Makes
sense to me.

But you've already got cable, so ripping it out and installing ADSL
might not be an option. Whatsmore, ADSL may not be available in your
area.

&gt; We do a bit of gaming and seem to get pings as low as 30ms in some
&gt; servers such as the wireplay ones, and no noticable packet loss even while
&gt; someone was streaming video.

For the time being :-)

&gt; We are very ahppy so far, but we have only had it for just over 24
&gt; hours, so  we dont really have enough experince to see if the service
&gt; level is typical.

"so far" is the keyword in this case, I feel. I am happy to be
corrected, but Cable doesn't seem like the technology that is going to
be the 'next big thing' like ADSL appears to have become.

I don't trust it, never will :-)
