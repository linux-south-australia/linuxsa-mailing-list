&gt;&gt; What about making sure that files are consulted before DNS in /etc/nsswitch.conf?

&gt; That is just for the initial connection to SSHD,

That's what I was referring to as well.  Probably not relevant, as DNS timeouts are
normally in the magnitude of tens of seconds, but there are more dependencies than
just /etc/hosts.

&gt; I'm assuming it is the NIC
&gt; because I have another machine with similiar specs that I can connect
&gt; instantly to SSHD (there is no delay),

The open sourced drivers tend to log events of a problematic nature - I don't
know about the Realtek drivers, having never used the cards (or likely to), but
I do know that the Intel pro drivers used to stall quite freqeuently whenever they
felt like it.  The "open sourced drivers" comment above was in reference to Intel's
own Linux drivers, which also stalled but never reported the problem.

If you want to find the problem, then it would be advisable to run tcpdump -n at
both ends of the link (I've seen switches foul up traffic before, so running it at both
ends helps reconcile what you're sending with what you're receiving).  The "-n"
prevents reverse name lookups, which may or may not be part of the problem, but
doens't hurt.

&gt; I'm not sure whether it is just for
&gt; that login (be it by SSH or a local tty login) or for the whole machine, 
&gt; but I don't think it would be good to have the machine freezing for other
&gt; processes as well, like it does for my logins.

Well, there is a huge difference, and it would go some way towards finding
what the problem is.

  Daryl Tester
