Oi :)

&gt; &gt; When I log on, I like to use as few characters in my username as
&gt; &gt; possible.. so I always try for "nickm" :)  (plus nickm sounds kinda
&gt; &gt; cool)
&gt; 
&gt; Why not go one step further and go for 'nm'?
&gt; It follows the unix convention of shortening everything to the minimum
&gt; possible number of characters, and you could almost get away 
&gt; with saying "my nm is nm". 
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, readability takes a bit of a hit.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember the Stonecutters episode of the Simpsons?
&gt; I can't quote verbatim, but a line went something like this..
&gt; 
&gt; "Marge, finally I've found a society that treats me like a real
&gt; person. They looked deep into my heart, and assigned me a 
&gt; number based on
&gt; the order in which I joined."
&gt;  -- Homer Jay Simpson
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, why can't you just give them a &gt;8 character username?
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:tjcorkin@ruiner">tjcorkin@ruiner</A> tjcorkin]$ telnet wiggum
&gt; Trying 10.0.3.20...
&gt; Connected to wiggum.internal.
&gt; Escape character is '^]'.
&gt; 
&gt; Red Hat Linux release 6.2 (Zoot)
&gt; Kernel 2.2.18 on an i686
&gt; login: this_is_a_test_long_username
&gt; Password: 
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:this_is_a_test_long_username@wiggum">this_is_a_test_long_username@wiggum</A> this_is_a_test_long_username]$ 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, so you're going to want to change your PS1 to something 
&gt; compact, say
&gt; PS1="[\w]$ "
&gt; but otherwise it seems fine to me?
&gt; 
&gt; 8 character limits just remind me of DOS...

yeeeeeah but I don't want to type "this_is_a_test_long_username" when
I log in ... and my point is, I don't HAVE to if I don't want to set 
it up that way.

Of course, I could set my systems up so that users logged in with 
something like:

  nicholas_luke_morrison_six_foot_two_brown_hair_great_skin

...  But I don't wanna :)  I want to log on with "nickm".

So - you could (possibly) implement something like a desired username
thing, like hotmail, where the user picks something they like - and
if it's taken, they can't have it - or if they want, they can just
choose the default...

My point is - it often doesn't *really* matter, nowadays, what with
all these new technologies.

If someone chooses the username "squidface", and you have no idea
who they are, you can simply do something like:

 $ ldapsearch "uid=squidface"

and you can get alllll the information you want.

The username isn't there (in my ((not that) limited) experience) to
give the systems administrator the person's name and address and 
blood type and sexual preference - it's there as an identifier - a
primary key, if you will - which should link to the user's useful 
information.

SO

If you want, if you'll find it easier to administer, use usernames
like "morrisn" and "smitha" and whatnot - but, if you prefer, let
the users choose their own usernames, like "fishface" and "eggnog".
Depending on your system, of course, it often makes nada
difference.  The choice is yours to weigh up and deliberate :)

Big disclaimer:  YMMV  :)   and IANAL.  and TNSTAAFL.  &c.


Anyway.

(blah blah :)



Nick!
