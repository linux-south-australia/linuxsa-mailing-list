&gt; I would like to know what some of you use as your username conventions.

I won't give you conventions, I'll give you the reasonable
requirements I have encountered over the years.  As you
want the "real world" there's no guaruntee that they lead
to pretty names.

The requirements result in login names that work for
UNIX, VMS, MVS, NDS, MS with suitable case changes
and work in institutions with 10,000s of people.

For maximum portability, user names should
 - be lower case
    - some Unix use an upper case user name to switch to
      a "convert upper case to lower case mode"
 - start with a, b, c, ..., z
 - contain only a, b, c, ..., z, 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
 - be six characters or less (that could be 8 if you don't
   use MVS)
 - not be a dictionary word, as these are often used for system accounts
 - not be a known system account on any operating system
   (root, sys, MANAGER, FIELD, SYS01, etc)

For maximum intelligibility, user names should
 - not contain adjacent characters that are easily confused: o0 l1
 - not be sequential
 - have a regular appearance, with numbers and characters in
   the same position in each name

For adherence to law, user names should
 - not be derived from the person's name
    - The HEOC has penalised firms that have not
      allowed recently-married women to alter their
      user name, but altering user names is impossible
      in some OSs.
 - not be derived from private data
    - employee or student IDs, tax file numbers,
      medicare numbers
 - not be an objectionable word, this includes words of
   cultural and religious significance
 - not expose the holder to risk

For ease of system maintenance, user names should
 - not be based on locality
 - not include a two-digit year
