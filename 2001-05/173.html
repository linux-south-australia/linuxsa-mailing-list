&gt; Microsoft is in defence mode, the article is a mixture of marketing, politics

I have friends that work for both Apple and Microsoft, so welcome
to my killfile.  If you can't write nicely about people, then I'm
not going to read you.

I could live with Windows being the dominant operating system if that
dominance came from overwhelming technical strength, rather than amoral 
business practices.

Andrew Reid replied:
&gt; The Tsars (the correct spelling escapes me) were the rulers of Russia
&gt; during it's Imperial days, if I rememmber correctly. They were regarded
&gt; as the most great people on earth -- like Gods even. Eventually, people
&gt; started realising that the quality of their lives was less than
&gt; fantastic and overturned them.

The Tsars were not God-like, they were believed to be appointed by
God to lead Russia.  Monarchs of the British Empire, France, Austria
and Prussia made similar claims, generically called the Divine Right
of Kings.

The end of Tsarist Russia is generally supposed to have had multiple
causes: poor conditions for industrial workers, a loss of confidence
in the government by the serfs from heavy losses in WWI, a loss of
confidence in the Tsar by the aristocracy due to the activities of Rasputin
with the Tsarina, the likelyhood of the Tzar's direct heir not reaching
maturity due to hemophilia, an emerging middle class undermining
the previous heirarchy of power, and the encouragement of revolutionaries
by Russia's competing European powers.

&gt; I wonder if history will ever repeat itself? :-)

I hope not.  Lenin and Stalin were effectively the next Tsars.
