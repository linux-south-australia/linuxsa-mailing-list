&gt; &gt; I've been attempting to setup stochastic fairness queues (SFQ) as a

&gt; &gt; an external link.
&gt; 
&gt; Toby,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't recall there ever having been discussion of the linux traffic control
&gt; in the linuxSA mailing list.
&gt; For that topic, I subscribe to <A HREF="mailto:diffserv-general@lists.sourceforge.net">diffserv-general@lists.sourceforge.net</A>,
&gt; which is theoretically limited to diffserv questions, but which seems
&gt; to range fairly widely over tc questions.

Ah ok.. I might give some other lists a try then.. 
I'll have another hit at the stuff over the weekend, and see how I go.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; using "iptables -t mangle -L -v" i can see that packets are not matching the
&gt; &gt; rules I setup. Can anyone suggest what rules are appropriate to match
&gt; &gt; packets coming in on a ppp interface, and leaving thru the eth interface,
&gt; &gt; after being de-masqueraded..
&gt; 
&gt; Without seeing your -L -v outputs, it's not easy to interpret what's
&gt; going wrong. Although I am often criticised for the garrulity of my posts,
&gt; that's better than having to eke out the details via a dialogue
&gt; of many posts on-list. Better to post one hundred-line explanation of
&gt; a problem than a dialogue of 5 posts elucidating the problem!

Indeed.. I'll endeavour to check this stuff out from home, and post a few
logs to work with them.
CUrrently things (according to iptraf) look fine on the eth0 and ppp0
devices.. on the ppp0 side its all heading to the external IP of the
gateway, and on the eth0 side you get
external_web_site_addy--&gt;internal_users_box_addy.. I wuold have thought the
rule saying 'all non-local IPs get marked' should have worked.. The only
thing i'm wondering is that maybe at the point where the mangle table is
called is that the source IP has been changed to be that of the
gateway.. although iptraf and tcpdump deny this.

I'll try using the u32 packet classifier instead and see how I go, since i
guess that occurs at a different stage.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The rules I have tried are using the mangle table (present in OUTPUT and
&gt; &gt; PREROUTING):
&gt; &gt; eg:
&gt; &gt; -t mangle -I PREROUTING -d users_ip -i ppp0 -j MARK --set-mark 1
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; -t mangle -I OUTPUT -d users_ip -s ! gateways_internal_ip -j MARK --set-mark
&gt; &gt; 1
&gt; 
&gt; This is just a hunch, but are you escaping the ! character?
&gt; It seems too obvious to mention. So no one else will mention it!
&gt; Are you running this in a csh or sh shell script?

it's a sh script, and what i typed above wasn't copy and pasted from my
actual shell script, unfortunately. (but i've typed it enuf times i know its
right, albeit with the IPs replaced)
When i do the iptables -t mangle -L -n -v, I can see that the rule does have
a ! in front of it, so i believe it's getting thru.

Good call thou - i certainly hadn't thought of that!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (users ip is of form 192.168.x.x, dialup IP is something like 203.x.x.x,
&gt; &gt; gateways_internal_ip would be 192.168.1.4 in this case..)
&gt; 
&gt; Do you have any NAT that might change destination IP address?

Yes... internal IPs are masqueraded before passing out thru the gateway..
So, external traffic looks like
203.1.2.3 -&gt; 203.6.7.8
internal traffic looks like
203.1.2.3 -&gt; 192.168.4.5



&gt; Can you run tcpdump to see whether there are packets coming out
&gt; in the right subnet etc.?

*nods* That appears to be right, i can check packets off various of the
internal machines, and things seem fine.. data's definately getting thru,
its just not going via the queues.. (checking the pkt count on the queues,
they are always zero.. plus the speeds aren't bounded)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; if i setup a rule on output and remove the -s ! gateways_int_ip, then it
&gt; &gt; matches all packets to the destination, but putting that rule back in stops
&gt; &gt; matching again..
&gt; 
&gt; The shell special-character ! could possibly explain this.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A second question, for Alan Kennington.. (I hope this hasn't already been
&gt; &gt; discussed, i haven't checked any archives)
&gt; &gt; Whereabouts did you get the statistics for the statement that any online
&gt; &gt; server is potentially cracked five times every hour?
&gt; 
&gt; My own 3 IP subnets are my primary source of evidence.
&gt; And other people have confirmed that they get probed that often too.
&gt; Of course, you have to set up your firewall to at least log all
&gt; probes. Otherwise you won't see them.
&gt; The rates change according to the time of week, time of day,
&gt; and special events, such as 4 May for chinese hackers.
&gt; Some people seem to be in regions of IP number space which
&gt; don't get so many hack attempts though.
&gt; And I think that masny people just don't have sensitive logging set-ups
&gt; for all the probes. So they just see very little of what's
&gt; going on out there.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll just summarise 2001 May 4 (things got hotter in the couple days after
&gt; May 4 actually).

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; Well, that's a tiny sample.
&gt; It's tiring to write this all out.

Thanks for the info ;)

&gt; The above amounts to only about 2 probes per hour.
&gt; But it's highly variable.
&gt; So some hours it is 5 or more probes in one hour,
&gt; and sometimes you go a whole hour without a (visible) probe.
&gt; I would say it averages 2/hour on an average day.
&gt; It all depends on whether the students are on holiday or not.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
