&gt; Companies are not moral entities, so, why should we expect them to engage
&gt; in moral behaviour?  Indeed, their very structure, and companies law in
&gt; most western countries, force amoral behaviour on all companies, and to
&gt; succeed, they must act amorally.  For example, it is immoral, and illegal
&gt; to kill someone. It is expected and required behaviour of a company to
&gt; destroy (kill) their competition.

It's hardly a comparison. Without competition, you don't have business.
People would go out of business. Killing people and killing companies
through providing a superiour service (or claiming to) are two different
things.

&gt; We, as a group of societies, must decide whether or not this is acceptible,
&gt; or not, and act appropriately.  It seems to me that the majority of people
&gt; would be unhappy if they realized that companies not only are not moral
&gt; entities, they are actually required to act amorally.

It's a double standard, though. Companies are expected to do there very
best to wipe out the competition, but they're expected to do this in a
moral mannar. "Do something that some may consider amoral, but make sure
you do it morally".

Personally, I can't see the point in arguing this topic -- it's a fact
of life. It's how business works. If we all suddenly decide that trying
to take out the competition is bad and we shouldn't do it, we'll have a
colapsing business world.

Take Internode, Picknowl or any other serious ISP. To stay in business,
they've got to offer a service that is more attractive than what "the
other guy" is offering. The fact that this results in other ISPs loosing
market share (and consequently money) is frankly, irrelevant.

To keep everyone in "check", you need the competitors. Some will find
one offering better than the other, hence things are ballanced out.
