&gt; &gt; No, I've made sure /etc/hosts have a fake name responding to the internal
&gt; &gt; IP address.
&gt; 
&gt; What about making sure that files are consulted before DNS in /etc/nsswitch.conf?

That is just for the initial connection to SSHD, I'm assuming it is the NIC
because I have another machine with similiar specs that I can connect
instantly to SSHD (there is no delay), but that is minor compared to the
real problem of the machine freezing. I'm not sure whether it is just for
that login (be it by SSH or a local tty login) or for the whole machine, 
but I don't think it would be good to have the machine freezing for other
processes as well, like it does for my logins.

&gt; There are no errors or messages, it is literally a hardware freeze for 
&gt; &gt; 5-10 seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; For all processes on that box, or just the process in question?

I assume for all processes. I could be just typing to the console or in an
SSH session and it just freezes, I keep typing and it bursts after 5-10
seconds.

I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but like I said it's a weird
intermittant problem and I just wanted to see if anyone else had
experienced it.

Thankyou.
