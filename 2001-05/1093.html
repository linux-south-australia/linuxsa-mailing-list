Hi list, font of all knowledge.

I have got to the stage with my system (Manduck 7.2) where it is time to
do a major refresh, and I seek some input from those with current
knowledge and recent experience. The need for refresh happens when so
many feral patches and non-standard updates have been applied that the
rpms for security updates constantly whine about broken (pah!)
dependencies etc etc. and eventually fail to load (Oh how I long for the
Slackware tarball days when I ran my own system and owned all the
decisions, but I digress...)

I have not seen a local review of Manduck 8.0. Any horror stories or
recommendations?

Also, while I am at it, I must report the imminent demise of my once
trusty ex-Micro-arts box. Like george washington's axe it has had six
new handles and three new heads, but apart from that it is still the
same opld 486 i bought many years aog in Melb. (Actually it is now a
6x86 PR200 in a Rhino 12+ MB with so many bits I ca't keep track of
them... but again I digress...) This old box is now greeting me with an
annoying beeeep beeep beeep on applying power 4 time out of 5, so I
guess it is time to finally look for a replacement. Any strong
recommendations re a desktop replacement box (strictly Linux only OS)
would be gratefully received.

All the best,

Bruce Moffatt
