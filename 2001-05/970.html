Topic: CVS over-the-net linuxSA links/FAQs thing.


Now before I start on this, if you want to tell
me that it's all been suggested/done/rejected/discussed
before, please e-mail me _off-list_ about it.
_Everything_ has been suggested/done/rejected/discussed
before. No need to waste bandwidth telling me that.
In fact, why am I wasting bandwidth telling you
that you should not waste bandwidth telling me that?
Hmmm. This might be getting recursive.
Where's the loop exit command....


Ah, now what I wanted to say was that at this point on
the www:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/links.html">http://www.linuxsa.org.au/links.html</A>

there's the potential to create a useful set of 
starting links and mini-FAQs etc.
(So far, so obvious.)
And what might be a good idea to create at that point
a useful set of links and FAQs could be some sort
of remote, over-the-net CVS sort of thing.
This would cut the administrative load down to
very little. Then a groups of trusted [well, relatively
speaking] individuals in linuxSA could contribute
page creations and modifications to build up a useful
set of links etc.
And if any garbage gets into it, the administrator
could back out the changes.

Personally, I don't think I'm old enough to
accept such a level of responsibility.
I just want to suggest things for other people to do.
I wouldn't mind being one of the contributors though.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. It's occurred to me that under the current and
pending authoritarian internet legislation, we'd have
to get a lawyer to check out all the contributions
before they go live on the net for all the 10-year-olds
to see.

PPS. Yes I know I suggested this idea once before, but not
with the suggestion of using CVS over-the-net.
Since I suggested this idea last time, I've worked out
how to use CVS.
