<H1>lost partitions?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->

I've checked the list archives and google but couldn't find anything 
specifically to help me out. Recently I must have done something stupid 
(more stupid than what I usually try) because my linux box won't boot up 
properly now. I get something like

"fsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/hdb6 
(null):
The super-block could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 
filesystem..."

then something about a corrupt super-block, and to try "fsck.ext2 -b 8193 
&lt;device&gt;" which I tried on all my failed partitions and generally get the 
error:
"fsck.ext2: Attempt to read block from filesystem resulted in short read 
while trying to open /dev/hdb&lt;take your pick from 5-9&gt;
Could this be a zero-length partition?"

I tried dumpe2fs &lt;device&gt; but I kept getting errors on all my failed 
partitions again (to be expected I figure), something about a corrupt 
superblock (forgot to write the err message). I have no idea what 
superblocks to try and fdisk / cfdisk won't let me view the hdb device, 
which is an IDE harddrive if you're wondering. hdba is fine. Only the root 
partition hdb1 (including /tmp, /etc et all other directories needed on / 
afailk) is mounting alright, so no /var, /home, /usr or even /boot (seems 
odd) but I can still get a shell.

I have 4 logicals, hdb6,7,8,9, hdb5 == swap and from memory, I believe hdb3 
is my extended
Can anyone help me out here? My backups aren't related to my linux distro.

I haven't checked out gpart lately, but I've used it before... I hope I 
don't have to use it again with all my logicals (bad memories).
Oh and also, at the start of the year I made a backup of my first few 
blocks (1 or 1-63.. i forget) just basically to backup my ptbl. I tried to 
dd it back, dd if=/dev/fd0/ptbl_backup of=/dev/hdb count=1 | 63, also no 
go.. don't know if that helped at all. It's 4:30 and I'm tired.. hope this 
helps you help me.
