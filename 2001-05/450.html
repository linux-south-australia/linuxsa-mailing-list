&gt;Adn that raises a further question about where you go
&gt;to get your IPv6 allocation.
&gt;I think I'd like to start with a /108 subnet of about 1 million
&gt;addresses - to allow for future expansion.
&gt;
&gt;By the way, I once worked out that there are 1000 IPv6 addresses
&gt;for every electron in every human being on earth.
&gt;That's probably down to about 950 by now, unless a lot of people
&gt;have lost a lot of weight recently.
&gt;
&gt;This is going to make those Internode allocations of IPv4 /30
&gt;subnets look distinctly stingy!
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Alan Kennington.


Damn, there goes the days of remembering ones ip address allocations in ones 
head. I manage 4 subnets of ip's (small telstra BPD ones) and I can remember 
each subnet, and it subnet mask and CIDR address, and on top of that the 
nameservers of my isp(s), and a few others. Try doing that with:

111.121.35.99.114.121.97.0.0.88.250.201.211.109.130.117

think of the subnetting possibilities,

once IPv6 is fully implemented allocations of IP addresses will either be 
very cheap or with that amount ip addresses can be afforded to allocate X 
amount of ip addresses to every person on the planet. Maybe it could come 
with your birth certificate or something, your lifetime allocation of IP 
addresses, that expire the day you die and are then moved onto another 
newborn!!! it could be seen as a way of tracking the population, forget 
names, use IPv6, oh hi, whats your Ip address?? &lt;g&gt;
maybe they will change communications within the computer bus even, instead 
of using pci or whatever, each hardware component in your machine will have 
an IP address, the cpu, the ram chips, the hard drive, and data is moved 
from one to the other via IP. Can you picture it, ten years from now, a 
connected home, you will be able to "PING" your telephone, stereo system, 
tv, vcr, airconditioner, automatic garage door, fridge, KIDS, PETS, maybe 
even your car, hell you might even be able to send a ping to a light globe 
to see if its working or not, image the possiblities.....

(yes this is a joke, bad thing is probably half of it will come true)
