In order for SUID scripts to be honoured the kernel needs to recognise
that it is a script and to invoke the interpreter accordingly.  Certainly
bash cannot honour that bit, nor can any non-SUID interpreter.  This is
why many sites install a SUID-perl as well as a regular perl.

Old SysV kernels did not recognise scripts at all, and they worked by
virtue of /bin/sh, which found the script after exec failed, and checked
to see if it started with : (which is a sh command).  Later, they adopted
the BSD convention of treating text files that start with #! as a script
(with the interpreter named after the #!.)  This change was made in the
userspace library wrapping the exec system calls (thus there could only
be SUID scripts on such a system if the interpreter itself was SUID.)

SUID scripts are easy to get wrong, and much has been written on that
topic.  If you really need a SUID script you can use a SUID wrapper to
invoke the shell SUID, thus:

  #! /home/me/bin/suid-me arg1 ...
  ...

and

  main() { *argv = "sh"; execvp("/bin/sh", *argv); perror("/bin/sh"); return 1; }

The C program is compiled to /home/me/bin/suid-me and is SUID me.

Obviously the fact that you utter "#! /home/me/bin/suid-me" means that
you are thinking carefully about the security implications.  (As if.)
