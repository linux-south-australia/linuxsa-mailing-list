Andrew,

My 2nd hand experience is that cable was fine till it got over-subscribed
which is consistent with what you say Andrew. Although recently a lot of
people have been going onto the DOCSIS network which require a different
(DOCSIS) modem. Their subsequent responce times have improved by an order
of magnitude. 

I don't want to get locked into a service which is going to degrade as it
did in the east people were suffering for months waiting for upgrade to
services to cope with the load.

Incidently I dont think optus ever suffered the problem Telstra did. As I
have friends on both and OPtus people were always wrapped with their
connection.

&gt;&gt; It seems attractive more so than ADSL at this point. Any opinions?
&gt;
&gt;If the Telstra/Optus cable services in other states are anything to go
&gt;by, I'd completely disagree.
&gt;
&gt;Once the cable service gets particularly popular, you've got a lot of
&gt;data moving through the network. My understanding is that Telstra/Optus
&gt;provided these services, but didn't upgrade the cable network to
&gt;accomodate for the extra traffic.

&gt;
&gt;The link between the 'Cable Users' and 'Telstra/Optus Network' has got
&gt;extremely congested. This meant that when you got home at 6pm, you'd
&gt;have nice long ping times and slow access.
&gt;
&gt;I'd be more likely to lean to ADSL. It's more likely to be taken
&gt;seriously by the providers.
