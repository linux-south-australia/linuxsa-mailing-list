&gt; I have not seen a local review of Manduck 8.0. Any horror stories or
&gt; recommendations?

Well, I installed it at work over the top of 7.2, and although I had the
disk space, I ran out of inodes. I was quite impressed that although the
installer crashed out my machine was still usuable. What I am currently
running is half 7.2 and half 8 although it identifies itself as 8. Not
that you want this of course, but all things considered thats a good
outcome. 

I have also installed 8.0 at home, with a fresh install. I have seen a
bug where the keyboard stops working and it requires a reboot. However I
think it was netscape that was causing this somehow as now I am using
netscape for mail and opera as the browser and havn't had a problem
since.
 
&gt; Also, while I am at it, I must report the imminent demise of my once
&gt; trusty ex-Micro-arts box. Like george washington's axe it has had six

Like the once-trusty company. I used to work for them. They suck now. :(
When they were a small family business they cared about their customers,
but alas no longer. Dont go back there (if you can find them).

&gt; guess it is time to finally look for a replacement. Any strong
&gt; recommendations re a desktop replacement box (strictly Linux only OS)
&gt; would be gratefully received.

Contact a company that'll let you specify the parts and list of hardware
that you know is good & supported. I personally swayed away from intel
chipsets and took up via and have had no problems. At work here im using
an i815 based box and, well, havnt had any problems with it either after
all :) Not as fast as a real box though, but cheaper and plenty fast for
a server.

If you want suggestions for hardware email me off list in order to stop
a pending religious debate like what happens around here too often.
