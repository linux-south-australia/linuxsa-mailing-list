&gt; Question 1:
&gt; It sounds like this means that a UPS is now of doubtful value,
&gt; if one is using a UPS for the sole reason of preventing
&gt; crash-time damage to file systems.
&gt; Is that right?
&gt; If that's true, I may have just wasted A$1350.

No. Many disks these days come with large caches. What happens if the
power goes out before it's flushed to disk? No matter how good a file
system is, if the wrong bit of the disk is corrupted, it's not easy to
recover from.

&gt; Question 2:
&gt; Is XFS usable as the /boot file system?
&gt; I found with ReiserFS on SuSE 7.1 that I couldn't really
&gt; use ReiserFS for /boot. Maybe that was because the minimum
&gt; size for a ReiserFS partition was 30 MB, or maybe there was
&gt; some other reason. But then again, one doesn't write
&gt; much to /boot anyway. So it doesn't matter...

What was the problem you had? Were there any error messages?

&gt; Back to question 1:
&gt; My real point I'm getting at is:  how good a guarantee
&gt; is there that you can turn off the power switch and
&gt; hope to get your system going again?
&gt; I did this once with my Reiser file system, and trashed my
&gt; /etc/rc.config file, which was currently being edited.
&gt; 
&gt; I.e. sometimes a file system may recover without fsck etc.,
&gt; but it might not be the file system you want!
&gt; As a file system, it might be structurally correct, but it
&gt; might be unbootable due to the files having the wrong contents.

If you have a large file system with most standard unix file systems
(I've noticed Solaris is often at the top of this list), after a machine
is powered back up, it can take hours to do a fsck. Our proxy server
here used to take 30 minutes each (easily) to fsck the cache partitions.
This doesn't happen with ReiserFS and I imagine, any other Journalling
file system.

Hope it helps,
Matt
