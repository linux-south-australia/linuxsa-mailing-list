i had the same problem with re-installing win2k after i had installed
mandrake 7.2. i got no response to my email, so i'm hoping someone will be
able to help with yours ;-) my original mail said:
"
i had to re-install win2k on my machine (it was dualbooting win2k and
mandrake 7.2). as expected, the windows install overwrote the MBR and got
rid of LILO. i figured i would just be able to boot off disk and run lilo
again to re-install it, but when i try to boot off the mandrake boot disk i
created when installing it, it gets partway through the boot and then gives
me this error message:

VFS: Cannot open root device 16:05
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 16:05

and stops there. it doesn't hang in terms of lockup, but it doesn't boot
into a prompt or anything usable.
"

i believe the partition mandrake is on is /dev/hdb1? i'm not 100% sure. my
system has 2 physical HDs (and a CDRom & floppy). the first HD is windows
only and is partitioned into 3 bits (these should be /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2,
/dev/hda3, is that right?) and the second is not partitioned and only has
mandrake on it (that should make it /dev/hdb1? i think?).

Things like distribution version etc. may be helpful.

In which order did you install the two Operating Systems? Windows likes
to install it's own MBR during the installation procedure which tends to
overwrite the old one.

What partition(s) has RedHat been installed to? (i.e. /dev/hda3)

&gt; Kindly help me to configure lilo on it

Certainly, as soon as you provide us with the necessary information.
