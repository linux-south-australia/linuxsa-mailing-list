The primus network was also broken this morning with authentication
problems, but it came back up at 9.

&gt; ADSL has been down since about 6 am this morning according to my log files.
&gt; The recorded message on the Bigpond support number says something similar.

&gt; Andrew,
&gt; 
&gt; My 2nd hand experience is that cable was fine till it got over-subscribed
&gt; which is consistent with what you say Andrew. Although recently a lot of
&gt; people have been going onto the DOCSIS network which require a different
&gt; (DOCSIS) modem. Their subsequent responce times have improved by an order
&gt; of magnitude. 
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to get locked into a service which is going to degrade as it
&gt; did in the east people were suffering for months waiting for upgrade to
&gt; services to cope with the load.
&gt; 
&gt; Incidently I dont think optus ever suffered the problem Telstra did. As I
&gt; have friends on both and OPtus people were always wrapped with their
&gt; connection.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It seems attractive more so than ADSL at this point. Any opinions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If the Telstra/Optus cable services in other states are anything to go
&gt; &gt;by, I'd completely disagree.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Once the cable service gets particularly popular, you've got a lot of
&gt; &gt;data moving through the network. My understanding is that Telstra/Optus
&gt; &gt;provided these services, but didn't upgrade the cable network to
&gt; &gt;accomodate for the extra traffic.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The link between the 'Cable Users' and 'Telstra/Optus Network' has got
&gt; &gt;extremely congested. This meant that when you got home at 6pm, you'd
&gt; &gt;have nice long ping times and slow access.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'd be more likely to lean to ADSL. It's more likely to be taken
&gt; &gt;seriously by the providers.
