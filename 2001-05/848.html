As a general comment (not specifically about Amanda and Arcserve) I have
found that there are more good backup solutions than good restore
solutions, and that people often mistakenly assume that the former implies
the latter.

As to Arcserve: is the on-tape format known? If not, has any work been
done to test that it is secure in the sense that the software knows for
sure that what it restores is what was backed up? And can the tape be read
without Arcserve? I've used Arcserve years ago under NT and it always
seemed to work perfectly for backup and restore. But I've no idea how hard
it is to recover from a media problem.

As to Amanda: As far as I have seen in the code it does not include any
form of checksumming information and therefore that Amanda has no way of
telling definitively whether a given restored file has been faithfully
restored or not. Modern hardware is pretty reasonable and often includes
some integrity checking transparent to the software, so hopefully restore
problems will be relatively rare. I know one site that backs up several
terrabytes nightly with Amanda and has done a lot of restores without any
known problem.

My suggestion is that unless you know for sure that a backup solution has
strong integrity checks that something like freeveracity provides
excellent insurance. Snapshots take very little room and can be stored in
enough different online places that they are unlikely to all be lost at
once.

If you aren't sure about the status of two collections of data that are
both on disk then rsync -n is a good way to check the differences without
transferring gigabytes around.
