&gt;  &gt; But hang on, where are you putting the digital modems? Normally, you would
&gt;  &gt; use a Cisco 5300 for that sort of thing, I though.
&gt;
&gt;Looking at Cisco 3661. It has ethernet and 6 expansion slots. Digital
&gt;modem cards as well as PRI interfaces are optional modules that can be
&gt;added (albiet at a price).

Its a relatively expensive way to skin that cat, but very convenient 
if you already have the 3661 and if price is no object.

Cisco offer some bundles of 36x0, PRI card and DSP modules which work 
out significantly cheaper than buying the bits separately. This is 
probably their way to make up for the absence of anything to directly 
replace the no longer current but once popular AS5260 - most stuff 
they make starts at 120 lines these days in the 'dedicated access 
server' line.

[actually not strictly true any more, with the advent of the Cisco 5350]

Anyway - the single cheapest hardware-based way to do this if you 
have low(ish) density requirements but enough to justify PRI at all, 
is to find a second hand 5260.

They ain't all that expensive any more - I think the last one we sold 
second hand here was something around the $9k mark - not bad value 
for 60 ports.  No I'm not offering to sell you one, I think we do 
have one or two left but they're actually useful as country PoP 
hardware - we install them to bootstrap some of our  small country 
PoP's and then put in 'big iron' when the customer base starts 
ramping up.

They aren't fast - but at (say) 30-40 lines in use, you can't tell 
the difference between them and something 'faster' in practical 
terms. Their CPU runs at freaky load levels but the boxes actually 
have quite effective PPP hardware assist in them so that modem PPP 
calls work very nicely indeed. In fact, it's only 'pure' ISDN calls 
that make them struggle a bit (which don't have the hardware assist) 
- these boxes were optimised for modem PPP indial.

Depending on the model, -some- 5260's support the sort of cool 
features people like in access servers these days (modem rate 
selection based on inward dialled number; ISDN data-over-voice, etc), 
and some don't - the 'MICA' based ones are a lot more featuresome 
than the older 'microcom' based ones in this respect).

The 36x0 based solutions and 5x00 systems for x&gt;=3 are all pretty 
nifty in feature set terms, just un-cheap. We should know, I we a 
huge pile of the 5x00 variety - for just about all available values 
of 'x' :) [the most impressive example is probably our 5850 system - 
a great way to keep a room warm but also ludicrously grunty]

&gt;  &gt; Anyway, why don't you look into Telstra's Dial-Connect, and then just bring
&gt;  &gt; one 2Mbps frame relay or some such into your premises.
&gt;
&gt;Could this 'Dial-Connect' service be what is on their website as 'Dial
&gt;IP'. It seems to me that it's a 'Virtual ISP' type of arrangement,
&gt;except, not :-)
&gt;They tunnel the dialup users to your network from which they can go out
&gt;onto the Internet using your link.
&gt;
&gt;Seems almost like paying twice to me. I wonder if it would be acceptable
&gt;for the tunnel to go through a current Internet connection rather than a
&gt;Frame Relay connection. Being a school, the cost of Frame Relay is
&gt;somewhat of an issue.

Oh, it -is- paying twice. That's their style. They have a number of 
products running on the same architecture - with charges per line to 
'enter' whatever 'cloud' the product is, and another set of charges 
to punch in a larger pipe to pull your data back out of the 'cloud' 
to your place.

There's nothing wrong with this in principle. What's wrong with it in 
practice is that you're describing a legacy offering from the most 
boring telco in the country, using inconvenient and expensive tail 
technology (frame or ATM) and it's relatively expensive for what it 
is.  The frame tail costs are indeed significant, especially at low 
utilisations.

The real core question here is the one raised by Richard - do you 
really want to build, or is it cheaper to rent?

OnRamp circuits aren't cheap. And they cost you whether you use the 
lines or not - Telstra charge what works out to be around $26 per 
line per month (minimum 10 lines, multiples of 10 lines going upward 
from that) for ISDN indial channels. No rebate for the huge amounts 
of money those lines make Telstra in inward local calls, of course.

That adds on to the acquisition and running cost of your digital 
access server (of whatever sort). And you have the issue of whether 
you get to keep up with the latest features that turn up (next month 
or so, that'll be 'V.92')

---

So in the name of reassuring people that Telstra aren't the only 
virtual port providers in the world, Internode (ahem) also offers the 
same service, minus the frame relay tail costs, and the grief of 
dealing with the boring people at Telstra.

[Begin Infomercial]

The mechanism we use, instead of the rather arcane Telstra one, is 
something called a "VPDN" - Virtual Private Dial Network - you dial 
in to our devices with your own realm (domain name) and a secure 
tunnel is created (using L2TP) between our access server and your 
nominated Cisco router (any Cisco running IP Plus).

You don't need a new tail circuit, yes you can use your existing 
Internet link or other carrier data service between our place and 
your place - of any sort at all.

The modems (or ISDN sessions, it supports both, plus Multilink) 
appear on your router (3600 or otherwise) just as if the modems were 
physically on the box - and you completely manage the authentication 
and IP allocations for your own users, exactly as if the modems were 
direct attached.

What you don't have to deal with are: OnRamp 30 costs, buying 
servers, fixing them, upgrading them, etc etc. And those virtual 
modems are available in lots of Internode PoP's. You also no longer 
need to care about having enough lines - we keep a hundred or so 
spare at any given time just to soak up spikes in demand.

The nifty-ness of VPDN mechanisms is hard to appreciate until you've 
tried them. Being able to virtual-dial back into my own office from 
all over the place, with full office access and no grief with access 
filters to do it is just wonderful.

For the few of us left without pure IP networks, this stuff supports 
any protocol operative over PPP (including IPX and Appletalk) as well 
as IP - all concurrently.

As you might expect, this mechanism is used by a number of companies 
to create a 'virtual ISP' over our infrastructure - but it's also 
highly, highly applicable to anyone who just doesn't want to babysit 
a bank of modems any more - and you can start with as little as one 
virtual 'line' or with a 'pay by the hour' basis, so there's not much 
grief in terms of financial commitment required

[/end Infomercial]

Down with the boring Telstra.  Don't buy things from them, it only 
encourages them.

:)

Cheers,
Simon
