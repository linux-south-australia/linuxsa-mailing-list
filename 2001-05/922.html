Hmmm...

&gt; I used to have an ideal (for me) laptop setup with Lilo booting to
&gt; either Win 98 (yes, apologies etc.) and Redhat 7. I have now moved to
&gt; Win 2000 (yes, apologies again etc.) but understand that a dual boot
&gt; configuration is not possible as Win 2000 want to hog the MBR.

Actually, you can get lilo back onto your MBR using the RedHat 7.1
rescue image. I had to do this because my house mate reinstalled Windows
2000 which promptly overwrote the MBR:

Pre-Configuration:
a) Do whatever you have to do to convince your computer to boot off the
CD ROM drive
b) If that fails, use "rawrite" to write an image to a floppy
 - there's better instructions for this on the CD itself
 - use Explorer (or something similar) to find the documentation and
read it carefully

Now, either reboot with the CD in the CDROM, the boot floppy in the
floppy drive or however you've managed to figure out how to get to...

1) Boot up to a lilo: prompt

2) Read the instructions, especially the one to get you into rescue mode

3) Get yourself into rescue mode

Now, here comes the interesting part. RH 7.1 mounts everything it
possibly can under /mnt/sysimage. That is to say, your normal system
root (the / in front of /etc for example) is now actually
/mnt/sysimage/. From here you need to:

1) Work out how to fix lilo (the Linux Loader) up
 - man pages do function
 - man lilo.conf, man lilo, man fsck, man fstab

2) Fix it up in /mnt/sysimage/etc/lilo.conf
 - I prefer the editor called "vi"
 - I suspect emacs would run too

3) Run lilo -r /mnt/sysimage/
 - the "-r" option causes lilo to "change root" to wherever you point it
at
 - your root is now in /mnt/sysimage/
 - therefore you have to cause lilo think that "/mnt/sysimage" is really
"/"
   [for the tech heads, this is for newbies and those who just want to
get
    a system running. flames about my abject description of what
"chroot"
    actually does are welcome, however the 5th Sheikh of the 16th
Dynasty
    by the 3rd Cousin of the Persian Maharajah, Falsifieh II happens to
be
    related to me and I have a lot of oil for flame wars and other such
    amusements]

4) Watch what lilo does

Throughout this process, especially if you fail again, you probably want
to write down (on paper perhaps) exactly what you've tried to do, look
in /mnt/sysimage/var/log/[any file in this directory is probably a log
file] for interesting information and package it off to us.
