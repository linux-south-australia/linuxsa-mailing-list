&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; The idea is that I am writing completely new code.
&gt; But there are areas of the linux kernel which are modular in the
&gt; sense that
&gt; they have clear internal interfaces which are well documented,
&gt; and therefore
&gt; I can easily add my module, but these are not modules in the
&gt; sense of a device driver module.
&gt; There's a specific exemption in the case of "loadable modules" which
&gt; are completely original code, but there are other parts which
&gt; are modules but not loadable modules.

IANAL (I am not a Llama) and all, but I _think_ that the GPL says that you
can't statically link non-GPL'd (or is it non-free?) code in with GPL'd
code. I think that the loadable module thing is because the code isn't
statically linked in... or something. I have a feeling that the idea behind
this is that you should be able to reproduce any binary code with free
source...

&gt;
&gt; This is analogous to writing an Apache module which is not
&gt; a shared-object module. In this case, your early have to compile
&gt; it into the Apache source tree. I.e. you really have to provide
&gt; source.

yep -- so loadable modules are ok (as are so modules), but not statically
linked libraries or modules.

&gt;
&gt; An interesting idea I thought of is this:
&gt;
&gt; -	It's okay to have commercial application software in linux.
&gt;
&gt; -	So I could write an application which:
&gt; 	-	downloads the latest kernel
&gt; 	-	patches in the changes
&gt; 	- 	recompiles the kernel
&gt; 	-	runs lilo etc. etc.
&gt; 	-	reboots the machine.
&gt;
&gt; Now there's an application program which just happens to
&gt; rewrite the kernel. The application could even boot back to the
&gt; original kernel and delete the modified kernel source
&gt; when it exits!

Ummm -- I don't think ESR would be happy :)

This is still linking in non-free code with free code... I think it's not
ESR-compatible... :)

&gt;
&gt; But the idea of writing a public domain stub patch to invoke
&gt; a loadable module is the simplest and sneakiest idea.

I don't know whether it's actually that sneaky... but I think it's legal,
and GPL-compatible...

&gt; All things considered, though, I think I'll ust publish my
&gt; source on the net, and not bother to tell anyone why it's
&gt; useful. It'll take years for anyone to work out what it's good for.

Well, that's a great idea, Alan -- why didn't MS think of that one? ;)

/me waits Mark Newton's corrections on the licencing thing :)
