&gt; Ok agreed, but by the same token 1.5gb is 276 etc. Who pays that? and for
&gt; most capped accounts @ 650mb its 117. The providers seem happy to offer
&gt; this for 24.95.

I don't know where the idea of capped accounts including 650MB came
from. $24.95 barely covers the cost of leasing the line from Telstra.
Providers *aren't* happy to offer this.

This issue has been beaten and stabbed at over and over again; I don't
think we need to continue discussing this.

&gt; We have used Inode at work for our ISDN link and they were great. We
&gt; changed to OPTUS for consoldation purposes but I am pleased Simon actually
&gt; listens to feedback if all thing's were equal I wouldnt hesitate to go with
&gt; internode.

Internode are a very attractive solution for a lot of situations. I'd
much prefer to have my link with a company that is based in the same
State that I am. Unlike other large Corporate ISPs (&lt;cough&gt;CCA&lt;/cough&gt;)
they actually have a decent number of technical people there to help
you.
Don't even get me started on CCA's lack of service and support...
(Amongst other things).

&gt; A very positive note of course, but are they just accepting what will
&gt; happen so may aswell condone it? 

Possibly, but you'll have to ask Simon that one. Internode still make
money from the bandwidth that those extra clients generate, though less
than what Telstra get (as Telstra charge [$x/client + bandwidth].

&gt; I assure you all other IP based services are shutdown so as not to detracet
&gt; from the gaming experience. The need for ping!

Receiving the odd email or sending out the occasional web page doesn't
affect the average ping rate that much.

&gt; &gt;Satellite is better, IMHO.
&gt; Why is that?

I prefer it. Most of the traffic that people download is pulled from the
US, so it'd be better to have a satellite connection which has an uplink
to the US. iHug's Ultra account would be OK if it weren't for the fact
that it seems slow.

&gt; In internodes case I suspect you're correct. Undersubsribed or
&gt; overconfigured is better than the reverse. Internode have always been
&gt; careful to stay within their capacity and provide a good service for every
&gt; customer.

How is Internode 'undersubscribed' or 'overconfigured'? I'm sure that
Internode either has or is rapidly developing a large ADSL client base.
And it's not that they 'stay within their capacity' either -- more that
they keep their network up to scratch. Sorry for being a pedant, but
it's important to note.

&gt; No it's been a matter of years in the east and as I mentioned the anecdotal
&gt; experience of a number of users of cable (in the east) has been taking on a
&gt; positive tone of late due to the DOCSIS implementations.  Mind you the TIO
&gt; intervention and non payment of accounts I suspect may have woken the
&gt; sleeping giant.

Has not always been the case. Anyhow, I feel that Cable is old, doomed
to be damned technology. I mean, with the advent of Digital TV and the
governments plans to use ADSL in conjunction with it, I can't see cable
being of much use. It's not comming to my house, that's for certain.

&gt; I can't find anything either. Do you suspect it was this which prompted
&gt; Telstra to introduce the service?

I assume you mean Telstra Satellite here. Then again, you could be
talking about ADSL.

If it were the former, then I think the answer would be no. Many other
companies had been offering Satellite access for a while, Telstra have
just started to market it, mainly at the 'Rural' sections of Australia.

If you were talking ADSL, I think the answer would also be no. xDSL has
been around for a while overseas, and Telstra just decided it would be
the best way to get the last remaining use out of their copper network.

&gt; PS: Has there been any comparisons between the two products contrasting the
&gt; merits of each both technologically and usability?

Again, which technologies? Satellite and Cable? ADSL and Satellite? ADSL
and Cable?
