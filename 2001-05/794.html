You can set 'reset configuration data' to yes in the bios, and on the
next boot the plug'n'pray will try to rework all the irqs. Then reset
configuration data will set itself back to no automatically, and then
you can see where you stand. 

You can also move the card to a physically different spot as some ports
are physically wired to others in the case of some motherboards. Usually
the pci slot closest to the agp will share the irq with agp, and the
furthest will share with onboard motherboard stuff. If you have more
than 4 pci slots then they will share with one of the first 4. Some
things will more happily share with each other than others, so you may
be able to swap things around, still have an irq conflict between other
things, yet find it works. It's all a bit of a juggling act.
Incidentally I think my ethernet card (a realtek 8139 based card) is
sharing with my agp vga and all is good. It just depends on your
hardware.

&gt; Okay, here's an update of the situation...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;From what people said, IRQ conflict is the most likely
&gt; problem, so this is what I investigated.
&gt; 
&gt; After a reboot, just before the LILO prompt I get the
&gt; following information:
&gt; 
&gt; Onboard Communications Device, IRQ10
&gt; Onboard Ethernet, IRQ5
&gt; Slot 2 Ethernet, IRQ11
&gt; Onboard Multimedia Device, IRQ9
&gt; Onboard IDE, IRQ14,15
&gt; AGP VGA, IRQ11
&gt; 
&gt; The ethernet card in PCI slot 2 is the RealTek RTL8139
&gt; card that I am using.  It would appear that I have
&gt; onboard ethernet as well, but it is not used, and I
&gt; did not discover any BIOS mention of it which is
&gt; strange.  From the above it would seem that the
&gt; RealTek ethernet card has an IRQ clash with the
&gt; IRQ given to the onboard VGA.  However, when I
&gt; cat /proc/interrupts I get:
&gt; 
&gt; 0:      timer
&gt; 1:      keyboard
&gt; 2:      cascade
&gt; 8:      rtc
&gt; 11:     eth0
&gt; 12:     ps/2 mouse
&gt; 13:     fpu
&gt; 14:     ide0
&gt; 15:     ide1
&gt; NMI:
&gt; 
&gt; So this doesn't show a clash at 11!  Indeed it does
&gt; not even show an interrupt for the graphics card!
&gt; 
&gt; I had another look at the BIOS and saw there was
&gt; an option to turn off IRQ assignment for VGA.  I
&gt; did this resulting in the follow at startup:
&gt; 
&gt; Onboard Communications Device, IRQ10
&gt; Onboard Ethernet, IRQ9
&gt; Slot 2 Ethernet, IRQ5
&gt; Onboard Multimedia Device, IRQ11
&gt; Onboard IDE, IRQ14,15
&gt; AGP VGA
&gt; 
&gt; So it seems three of the items have changed and that
&gt; the VGA card no longer has an interrupt --- I'm not
&gt; sure what effect this has except to say that
&gt; Windows didn't like it.  Anyway, for the purposes
&gt; of sorting out IRQ clashes this seemed a good option
&gt; to try --- as there should no longer be a clash.
&gt; Unfortunately I still could not connect with the
&gt; network (pinging the gateway didn't work, packets
&gt; lost).
&gt; 
&gt; As far as /proc/interrupts goes, the only change was
&gt; that eth0 moved to IRQ5.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that's where I'm up to.  I'm not really sure
&gt; what to try next!!  Any suggestions would be most
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; 
&gt; Mark.
