&gt; Well, yes they do, but it is a matter of cost and hassle etc.

I understand your point. I also understand where Telstra are pitching
this service. To the corporate environment, and no less is what I
surmise.

&gt; Do you want the hassle of owning the dial-up infrastructure your self, or
&gt; do you want someone else to do it for you?

We're a school, Richard. We've got it pretty good, considering what
other public schools have. 
The type of dialin service that I'm talking about will require me (or
someone else) to spend time managing and maintaining it.

We'll be stretching the moneybag a bit trying to do what we want to, let
alone Dial IP + Frame Relay + Managed Infrastructure.

&gt; &gt;Seems almost like paying twice to me. I wonder if it would be acceptable
&gt; &gt;for the tunnel to go through a current Internet connection rather than a
&gt; &gt;Frame Relay connection. Being a school, the cost of Frame Relay is
&gt; &gt;somewhat of an issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, the MegaLink is going to cost you, surely?

Indeed it will, but I'm not here to get something for nothing. The cost
of the MegaLink we hope to offset with revenues raised from
student-purchased dialup accounts.

Sadly, I don't think that DETE will let us tack the cost of ISDN PRI
link(s) onto their bill :-(

&gt; I doubt that Telstra would be interested in using someone else's tunnel,
&gt; and come to think of it, the Dial-Connect services I have been involved
&gt; with all involved a Telstra-managed Cisco as the endpoint of the tunnel.

Well, there goes that idea, then :-)

&gt; The cards are used world-wide. There is even someone in Adelaide using them
&gt; between Adelaide and Melbourne.

Sounds good then. Having never heard of the cards before I am/was a bit
reluctant to jump and call them the best thing since Open Source.
