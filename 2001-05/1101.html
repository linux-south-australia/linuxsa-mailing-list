&gt; My point is that the market price is being determined by the ignorance
&gt; of the customers. If everyone out there knew what was really involved
&gt; in setting up DNS, no ISP would be able to get away with charging such
&gt; a high fee for almost nothing at all.

If people needed the service, and it was worth $lots to them (eg,
microsoft.com is worth millions, if not more, to MS), and there are a
limited number of places that will sell them this service, then they will
pay whatever is required to get it done. Not dissing you, just correcting
you. eg -- everyone knows that each postmix Coke[tm] costs ~$0.10, yet we
still pay ~$2 for it...

&gt; &gt; Stop implying it's somehow evil or wrong -- it's a free market.
&gt;
&gt; Many factors make up the concept of "free market", and consumers talking
&gt; to each other and sharing information is one of them.

yes.

&gt; I think it's wrong to be charged $250 a year when I know it's really just
&gt; some sloth typing in a couple of lines and $249 of that money will end up
&gt; being pure profit for the company.

I guess that unless you find a supplier willing to sell you the service of
"some sloth typing in a couple of lines" for $1, you'll either have to pay
the extra or go without.

&gt; The more people who share my opinion, the more pressure is brought on ISPs
&gt; to charge a fair amount of money for their services. The more I talk about
&gt; this, the more likely more people will share my opinion. The more people
&gt; complaining about unfair pricing, the more likely it will be that I will
&gt; be able to pay a fair price in future.

not while there is a willing market out there willing to pay more...

&gt; So, this little segment of the free market is operating just fine.

indeed it is :)
