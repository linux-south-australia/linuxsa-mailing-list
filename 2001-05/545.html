I always explain it so.

I ask them to imagine they are blind and in a room they don't know in a
house they don't know.

Thier host(ess) asks them to have a seat.

Where do they sit?  They don't know where any chairs are in the room and
they have no idea what the layout of the house is and the host(ess) hasen't
provided them with any info so they search as much as they can and find
nothing.


However, if the host(ess) says 'have a seat to your right.' (./) then they
know where to look for the chair.

But if they are in thier own house and someone moves the chair what then.
Well, they know where all the rest of the chairs are in the house, but that
doesn't do them any good.  They need the chair that is in the same room so
they need to be pointed to it.

This may sound a bit wierd but it has helped me in the past to effectivly
explain the situation to beginners.

P.S. Sorry Daryl. hehe. Forgot the list emails default to the actual poster
of the message and was replying in thread fashion.

Subject: why "./" for cmd in current dir


&gt;
&gt; I'm trying to explain to someone via email why they need to use "./"
before
&gt; an executable
&gt; file in the current directory (which isnt in their path of course)
&gt;
&gt; just wondering what everyone's logical explanation would be
&gt;
&gt; thx
