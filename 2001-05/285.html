&gt; &gt; You may encounter problems with live streams -- they change from second
&gt; 
&gt; Err... yes...  live streams USUALLY do change from second to second... ;)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Dude - thats by definiton.
&gt; 
&gt; ...SWEET!
&gt; 
&gt; RTSP / RTP are really the only protocols you can use with live streams afaik, there are probly others but these are the best supported.
&gt; 
&gt; HTTP streaming is damn sweet though with static movies which have been hinted (Quicktime Pro, afaik quicktime is the best streaming, there are only two other main ones, those being RealProducer (imo realplayer sucks, the encoding utilities are nice tho) and M$'s media (which only runs on NT/2K, obviously sucky sucky. The streaming technologies are nice, but _very_ hardware intensive [which you'd expect with heavy compression]).
&gt; 
&gt; For broadband connections, which is what I'm working on, http streaming is 
&gt;pretty nice, as the content is being delivered exactly the way you want it 
&gt;(whereas rtsp/rtp optimises itself for the connection).  Only problem being the 
&gt;speed that it needs to be delivered to the viewer, which needs to be as 
&gt;fast/faster then it is being played.  It will stream to your machine, and then 
&gt;play from that.  In a sense, it is not live, it is simply playing from the buffer 
&gt;on your system.
&gt; 
&gt; However you cant fast forward/rewind http streams, and as said before it aint 
&gt;live.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence RTP/RTSP is needed, and to have a proxy/cache application to cache 
&gt;RTP/RTSP before it hits the viewer would be nice in many sceneraios, especially 
&gt;on a lan, especially if the machines are only capable of buffering so much.  I 
&gt;know this is possible as the players do it.
&gt; 
&gt; So yep... still lookin for a caching proxy for RTSP/RTP streaming.  If anybody 
&gt;comes across one, even if its not free, gimme a yell :)
&gt; 
&gt; Ta guys/girls...

man your formatting stinks. try a CR once and while :)

FreeBSD:  /usr/ports/net/rtsp_proxy/

I think what he is trying to say is that freeBSD kernel does RTSP
proxying.
