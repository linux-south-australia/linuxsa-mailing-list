Cable is definately avaiable in SA.

We ordered it last Thurs and had it installed yesterday.
Not bad for a Telstra service.

I have not got it going with Linux yet, but I beleive there is a project
at sourceforge for the appropriate client for many operating systems.

The guy who installed it was not all that PC savvy and inssited I installt
eh telstra network card, even thought the problem he had installing it was
not host related.

In any case it was in and going within two hours including the install of
the cable form the street.

I tired to get it going under mac OS 9.x on a friends G3 laptop last night
and could not, but we didnt bother chasing tech support, because our phone
was not on yet.
The Mac software just could not connect.
*shrug*

We're at Mile End, I have other friends who have it at
Seacombe Heights.

Check out the web site I think it can tell you more or less straight away
if you can apply.

I am not sure if that means you can defiantely get it, but I assume it
means it is avaialbe in your area/street at least.

With the plan we have it is a little cheaper than adsl, the latency
appears to be better, generally the download is in the region of 60KB+ per
second.

The infamous AUP applies for the plan we are on. You can have up to 2
extra users on that plan - the only restricton that annoys me about it is
that no servers restriction, but that is not really a huge issue, as I
dont NEED a server and the flat rate price more than makes up.

It is slightly cheaper than telstra adsl, I think we pay $72 per month for
the base account and $11 per month for each of the two additonal
simultaneous users.

We do a bit of gaming and seem to get pings as low as 30ms in some
servers such as the wireplay ones, and no noticable packet loss even while
someone was streaming video.

We are very ahppy so far, but we have only had it for just over 24
hours, so  we dont really have enough experince to see if the service
level is typical.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hi List,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen/had cable setup for net access in SA? If so which areas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems attractive more so than ADSL at this point. Any opinions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;
