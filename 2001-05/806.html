Thanks for the reply!  I looked all through the BIOS (it's AMIBIOS) and
couldn't find a "reset configuration data" entry anywhere!

In any case, I think the evidence is mounting up that it's not an IRQ
conflict problem.  My reasons:

1. /proc/interrupts doesn't show any conflict.
2. On bootup the only conflict that is shown is between the ethernet
   card and the onboard VGA.  As you say, it would seem that both
   may be able to share the same interrupt without problem.  But
   even if it is a problem, I got rid of the VGA interrupt so no
   conflict was shown on startup, and yet I still could not see
   the network.
3. I've played around with all sorts of BIOS options, turning off 
   onboard things like sound and modem --- meaning very few IRQs
   are used --- but the problem remains.

&gt; You can also move the card to a physically different spot as some ports
&gt; are physically wired to others in the case of some motherboards. Usually
&gt; the pci slot closest to the agp will share the irq with agp, and the
&gt; furthest will share with onboard motherboard stuff.

Thanks for the tips!  I suspect the problem lies elsewhere, but if I all
else fails, perhaps I can try moving the card around.  (It works fine
in windows the way it is mind you.)

Thanks,

Mark.
