&gt; &gt; These yearly costs seems to be a bit of a gouge to me - but perhaps I'm
&gt; &gt; misunderstanding the scope of the effort to make the initial DNS entry
&gt; &gt; (mmm...) and then cope with a volume of subsequent queries?
&gt; 
&gt; What you are paying for is infrastructure, bandwidth costs, wages, admins,
&gt; this, that and the other. Sure disk space is cheap, but bandwidth is not!

What you are really paying for is support.

It's not too difficult to offer a really cheap DNS registry.
edu.au is free for example.  But this is done by keeping
a lid of the clueless.

If you are offering a service to the puiblic, then the
support costs are huge.  Most people, even experienced
sysadms, manage to misconfigure DNs and sorting it out
can take ages.

You'll find that most of the cheaper DNS registries
do just that -- accept your details and register
them.  If it doesn't work, well that's your problem.
