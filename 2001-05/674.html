Not via the Telstra wholesale derived service - Telstra have chosen 
(at least at this time) to limit the service to 1.5 mb/s via their 
DSLAM equipment. I don't expect that to change for a long time, if 
ever.

If it was enabled at higher rates, higher costs would, 
unsurprisingly, also apply.

However, we have other options to drive data rates &gt; 1.5 mb/s - we 
can support wireless links with peak speeds approaching double ADSL's 
transfer rates, and symmetric options including 2mb/s, 4mb/s, 10mb/s, 
100mb/s and 1000 mb/s. If you're serious, so are we.  You just need 
to be prepared to pay for it.

If you have a specific need you want to solve, feel free to get in 
touch with our sales team, or directly with me, to tell me how fast 
you really need to go, where exactly the delivery point is, and what 
you want to spend on it.

I might also note that if you really need (as opposed to want) 500 
kbytes per second transfer rates, perhaps you should also consider 
the far cheaper option, which is to move the servers that need that 
speed 'to the net' to our place - where a 100 megabit link to the 
Internet is trivial - and leave the ADSL link as purely your office 
feeder channel, for which 1.5 mb/s is probably going to be ample.

Cheers,
Simon

&gt;  &gt; Given the frequent discussions on ADSL in this list in the past, I
&gt;  &gt; thought it might be a useful data point to note that Internode can
&gt;  &gt; now offer 512 kilobit per second ADSL links in addition to the other
&gt;  &gt; two common ADSL speeds (256k and 1.5 megabits per second)
&gt;
&gt;One thing I'd be interested in is bigger pipes. I'd like to be able to
&gt;use ADSL as my primary Internet connection, but 1.5Mbit just doesn't cut
&gt;it.
&gt;
&gt;Is there a posibility of having the 6Mbit (or whatever it is) that ADSL
&gt;is capable of delivered to consumers? It'd be nice to get the
&gt;  &gt;500Kbit/Sec out of ADSL that I (and I'm sure others) need...
