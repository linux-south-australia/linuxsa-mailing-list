&gt; I've seen (I can't bloody remember where) a document arguing that

You are no doubt thinking of this:

[ From <A HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section3.html">http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section3.html</A>#3.5 ]

Because full names are not unique. For example, the computer community has
two Peter Deutsches. At one time, Bell Labs had two Stephen R. Bournes
with offices a few doors apart. You can create alternative addresses
(e.g., Stephen_R_Bourne_2), but that's even worse -- which one of them has
to have their name desecrated in this way? And you can bet that one of
them will get most of the other person's email.

So called "full names" are just an attempt to create longer versions of
unique names. Rather that lulling people into a sense of security, I'd
rather that it be clear that these handles are arbitrary. People should
use good user agents that have alias mappings so that they can attach
arbitrary names for their personal use to those with whom they correspond
(such as the MH alias file).

The problem is even worse outside of America, where non-ASCII characters
(e.g., characters with umlauts or the Norwegian Ø) are used in names.
Since non-ASCII characters cannot be used in the SMTP envelope or e-mail
headers, the full names are mangled anyway.

Even worse is fuzzy matching in email -- this can make good addresses turn
bad. For example, Eric Allman is currently (to the best of our knowledge)
the only ``Allman'' at Berkeley, so mail sent to &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Allman@Berkeley.EDU">Allman@Berkeley.EDU</A>&gt;
should get to him. But if another Allman ever appears, this address could
suddenly become ambiguous. He's been the only Allman at Berkeley for over
fifteen years -- to suddenly have this "good address" bounce mail because
it is ambiguous would be a heinous wrong.

Directory services should be as fuzzy as possible (within reason, of
course). Mail services should be unique.
