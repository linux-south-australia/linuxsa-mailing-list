&gt; Hi Everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; I have just built a new gateway box using RH7.1. The simple IP
&gt; Masquerading works fine but there doesn't seem to be any modules for
&gt; masquerading ICQ,ftp or others. Has anybody found these modules
&gt; somewhere yet, I have looked at the How-To and the web page that
&gt; supports the Masquerading but have not seen mentioned any where the new
&gt; modules. I downloaded 2.4.4 and compiled that but also appears to be
&gt; missing the modules.
&gt; If any body has any leads or suggestions it would be greatly
&gt; appreciated.

you should read this iptables tutorial:
<A HREF="http://www.BoingWorld.com/workshops/linux/iptables-tutorial/">http://www.BoingWorld.com/workshops/linux/iptables-tutorial/</A>

If i understand it correctly, you no longer need that special modules
for ftp as most of it is handled by state machine and the connection
tracker.

You might also want to read the netfilter FAQ:
<A HREF="http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/netfilter-faq.html">http://netfilter.filewatcher.org/netfilter-faq.html</A>
and pay special attention to section 1.3 and 1.4.

for those who hate following URLs:

1.3 Is there an ICQ conntrack/NAT helper module? 

If you are used to masquerading on a Linux 2.2 box, you always used the
ip_masq_icq module in order to get direct client-to-client ICQ working. 

Nobody re-implemented this module for netfilter, because the ICQ
protocol is too ugly :) But I guess it's just a matter of time until one
is available. 

Rusty once pointed out that only modules for protocols with at least one
free client and one free server are going to get integrated into the
main netfilter distribution. As for ICQ, there
are only free clients, so it doesn't match this criteria. (free as in
freedom, not in free beer, i.e. RMS' definition) 

1.4 Where did the ip_masq_vdolive / ip_masq_quake / ... modules go? 

Some of them are not required, and some haven't been ported to netfilter
yet. Netfilter does full connection tracking even for UDP, and has a
policy of trying to disturb the packets at
little as possible, so sometimes things `just work'.

Jake
