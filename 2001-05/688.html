Hi folks.

Here is an outline of the course I have developed and will be presenting
here in Adelaide in July.

Please let me know what you think of the outline.

I am unsure if I will allow people to drop in and out as they see fit,
because of the impact on equipment hire and continuity, etc ...

COURSE DEVELOPER

This Advanced Samba course has been developed by Richard Sharpe for NS 
Computer Software & Services PTY/LTD.  Richard is a member of the Samba team
who has also been involved with two Samba books and has contributed to Samba
in a number of areas.

YOUR INSTRUCTOR

Richard Sharpe has over 20 years experience in the computer industry, and has 
delivered more than 70 hands-on courses over the last four years. During the 
same period, he has developed five courses.  Richard is a member of the 
Samba team and Ethereal team, and a regular open source software contributor.

Richard is also the main author or contributing author on two Samba books and 
regularly presents tutorials on Samba at conferences in Asia and Australia. 
He is dedicated to ensuring that delegates to his courses leave having 
achieved the greatest knowledge transfer as well as experiencing the topics
in 
a hands-on manner.

He is also the author of the SMB dissector in Ethereal, as well as a number
of other dissectors in Ethereal.

PREREQUISITES

Delegates to this course should:

 - Have a basic understanding of TCP/IP Networking

 - Be able to configure Windows clients to access Windows NT servers

 - Be able to log into and use a Linux system

DESCRIPTION

Samba is perhaps the main reason that most people install Linux, as it allows 
them to provide the same File and Print services that Windows NT does for 
Windows clients. In recent years, Samba has been extended to provide even
more 
functionality, with it being able to function as a Primary Domain Controller
for Windows NT and Windows 2000 clients.

This intense course by a Samba team member  aims to ensure that delegates can 
be more effective in supporting mixed UNIX and Windows environments, and 
that they can deliver the full  benefits of the cost-reductions Samba makes 
possible for organizations.  It does by providing a hands-on environment 
with courseware developed by a member of the team that develops Samba.

You will learn how to configure Samba to support Windows 9X, Windows NT and 
Windows 2000 clients.  You will also gain practical experience in 
troubleshooting mixed Windows and UNIX/Linux networks, as well as how to 
integrate Linux into a Windows network.

The course will be based around Samba 2.2.0 or better.

CLASS DURATION

2 or 3 days, depending on requirements. The course contains a strong 
hands-on component with delegates spending about half their time in 
hands-on sessions. There will be a test at the end of the course that 
assesses delegate's performance during the course.

OBJECTIVES

At the completion of this course, delegates will be be able to:

- Install Samba from binaries and sources
- Configure Samba manually as well as with SWAT and WebMin
- Understand NetBIOS, the SMB protocol and how clients access services
- Set up Samba as a logon and profiles server
- Diagnose a wide range of common problems with Samba 
- Configure Samba as a PDC for Windows NT and 2000
- Troubleshoot a wide range of problems with Samba

COURSE CONTENTS

The following provides an indication of the elements that can be included in
the course. A two-day course will not be able to cover these topics as 
extensively as a three-day course would.

1. Introduction to Samba, its genesis, how it is developed and support 
   resources available.

2. Installing Samba from binaries and sources, where the files go, and
   basic configuration of Samba and clients.

3. Using SWAT and WebMin to configure Samba, more complex configuration,
   plaintext vs encrypted passwords, Samba automation with config file
   substitutions.

4. Basics of sharing directories and printers, controlling access,
   controlling the modes and owners of new files and directories.

5. Advanced directory and printer sharing, using Samba substitutions to
   dynamically create shares, using scripts to perform actions when shares
   are mounted from clients, automatically generating logon scripts.

6. Introduction to NetBIOS and the SMB protocol, using packet sniffers 
   like tcpdump and Ethereal to monitor communications between client 
   and server, and the structure of Samba.

7. Setting up Samba as a logon server for Win9X clients, using Samba as 
   a WINS server, using Samba with DHCP, setting up logon scripts and
   using Samba as a profile server.

8. Setting up Samba as a Primary Domain Controller for Windows NT and 
   Windows 2000. Using profiles and logon scripts with them as well. 

9. Security in Samba, setting up the four security modes that Samba
   understands, controlling access on a per-system and per-user basis.

10. Accessing Samba from clients, including Windows 3.X, Windows 9X, Win NT,
    Win 2K and Linux, printing from Linux/UNIX to Windows, using smbclient, 
    using rpcclient.

11. Samba and browsing, setting up cross-subnet browsing, how browsing works,
    common browsing problems, and the interation between browsing and WINS.

12. Troubleshooting Samba, including common problems with browsing, 
    permissions, smb.conf syntax problems, joining the domain problems,
    connection problems, general troubleshooting techniques, using 
    packet sniffers and access to resources.

13. Advanced techniques with Samba, and Samba performance tuning.

EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS

Because of the advanced nature of this course, each delegate will need a PC
to work on.  In addition, some of the PCs will require Windows 98 or ME,
Windows NT or Windows 2000. Further, a small router (perhaps a Linux PC 
operating as a router will do the job).

An ideal set up is to have all machines set up dual-boot, with each having 
Linux on it, and also having one of Windows 98 or ME, Windows NT and Windows 
2000 on it. This will allow all delegates to have exposure to using all of 
these operating systems with Samba.

Another ideal setup would be to have all machines with Linux and then run
VMware on each of the machines, with Win98 and NT or Win2K images in VMware.

A diagram of the class setup is:
