 &gt; Not sure where exactly this one originated, but it might be worth checking 
 &gt; out. Not sure where to go on this one.

A web search for "602P" would have shown several hundred debunkings.

 &gt; Under proposed legislation, the Australian Postal Service will be
 &gt; attempting to bill E-mail users out of "alternative postage fees."
 &gt; Bill 602P will  permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge
 &gt; on every E-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source.

It's total garbage.  

   - there is no "bill 602P".  Indeed, Australian parliament gives bills
     names, not numbers.

   - There is no lawyer in Canberra who goes by the name "Richard Stepp".

   - There is no ad campaign with the slogan, "There's nothing like a 
     letter."  There was a US-Mail campaign with that slogan in 1998.

   - There is no "Free" internet in Australia :-)

   - There is no member of parliament by the name of "Tony Schnell".

   - The Sun Herald never carried a story which described an E-Mail surcharge
     as "a useful concept whose time has come" on March 6 1999 or any other
     day.

   - There is a press release on the DCITA web site denying the hoax:
     <A HREF="http://www.dcita.gov.au/nsapi-text/?MIval">http://www.dcita.gov.au/nsapi-text/?MIval</A>=dca_dispdoc&ID=5693

   - There is an almost word-for-word copy of the hoax on www.urbanlegends.com,
     where "Canberra" has been exchanged for "Washington".  Whoever
     Australianized it didn't even bother to change the bill number, the
     lawyer's name, or the representative's name.  They did remove the
     (r) for "Republican" after his name, however (although I did see another
     Australianized version of this a couple of days ago which didn't even
     contain that modification).

It's a hoax.  Contact whoever it was who forwarded it to you and get
them to tell the rest of their friends to stop forwarding it.
