Looking at putting Oracle 8.1.7 onto a Linux Box.
Firstly, has anyone in this list installed 8.1.7 on a Linux Box
successfully?
If so, what distribution/version? Any patches/changes required?

What about the 2.4 kernel? (upto 2.4.4 as far as I know). Supposed to have
improved I/O and memory management in these kernels which should help
Oracle.

Need this info as quickly as possible (the usual story).


Also, Looking at a Dell 6400 with 2-4 Xeon III 700's (2MB cache), 2GB RAM,
2x9GB and 4x73GB,
2x100Mbps. I have seen Dell's with Oracle on RedHat in a few places and they
seem to run well (and reliably).
I have never put Linux on a dual/quad box before. Once again kernel 2.4.x is
supposed to have better SMP as well, hence my interest in it. I have build
many 2.4 kernels sucessfully, but only for single CPU boxes.
Personally, I am a Debian person, but have used RedHat before if that is
what is required.

Seems I have included quite a few questions up there. Can anybody help me or
give me some URL's?


cheers,
