&gt;What potential do you think it has for documenting projects?

I don't know ... 

I still think that DocBook is the right tool, and have been hacking on the
DSSSL Stylesheets and on jadetex to get things looking good.

For example, I can now do separate title pages for each chapter, can have
different left and right side margins, can have rules below the header and
above the footer (without ugly space before or after the rule), plus handle
admonition graphics for warnings and notes etc. All of this took much
hacking, and much has now been contributed back to the DocBook project ...

However, I think that OpenOffice's presentation tool is better than
magicpoint, but has a compressed file format and is difficult to put into
CVS properly etc.
