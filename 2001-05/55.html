I seem to recall seeing something almost exactly like this circulating around
the US a couple of years ago and from my minimal research appeared to be nothing
more than a hoax.  Even if it is true, how does the government plan to police
this issue?  If it's anything like their censorship bill, then we have to wait
until someone points a finger and says "look, they are sending email!"

Even the wording of the email is almost identical to the one in the US so I'm
suspecting that someone just has far too much time on their hands (Not implying
Robyn, just the person(s) responsible for coming up with this crud)

If on the other hand it is true, then I can see an awful lot of people who just
won't bother using email on principle, or even better, using instant messaging
instead as a way to get around it.

There is always the distinct possibility that I'm wrong on this, but in reality
I don't see any other way to look at it sensibly.

just my $0.02c +GST
