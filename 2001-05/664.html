&gt; I've been attempting to setup stochastic fairness queues (SFQ) as a

Toby,

I don't recall there ever having been discussion of the linux traffic control
in the linuxSA mailing list.
For that topic, I subscribe to <A HREF="mailto:diffserv-general@lists.sourceforge.net">diffserv-general@lists.sourceforge.net</A>,
which is theoretically limited to diffserv questions, but which seems
to range fairly widely over tc questions.

&gt; using "iptables -t mangle -L -v" i can see that packets are not matching the
&gt; rules I setup. Can anyone suggest what rules are appropriate to match
&gt; packets coming in on a ppp interface, and leaving thru the eth interface,
&gt; after being de-masqueraded..

Without seeing your -L -v outputs, it's not easy to interpret what's
going wrong. Although I am often criticised for the garrulity of my posts,
that's better than having to eke out the details via a dialogue
of many posts on-list. Better to post one hundred-line explanation of
a problem than a dialogue of 5 posts elucidating the problem!

&gt; The rules I have tried are using the mangle table (present in OUTPUT and
&gt; PREROUTING):
&gt; eg:
&gt; -t mangle -I PREROUTING -d users_ip -i ppp0 -j MARK --set-mark 1
&gt; 
&gt; and
&gt; 
&gt; -t mangle -I OUTPUT -d users_ip -s ! gateways_internal_ip -j MARK --set-mark
&gt; 1

This is just a hunch, but are you escaping the ! character?
It seems too obvious to mention. So no one else will mention it!
Are you running this in a csh or sh shell script?

&gt; (users ip is of form 192.168.x.x, dialup IP is something like 203.x.x.x,
&gt; gateways_internal_ip would be 192.168.1.4 in this case..)

Do you have any NAT that might change destination IP address?
Can you run tcpdump to see whether there are packets coming out
in the right subnet etc.?

&gt; if i setup a rule on output and remove the -s ! gateways_int_ip, then it
&gt; matches all packets to the destination, but putting that rule back in stops
&gt; matching again..

The shell special-character ! could possibly explain this.

&gt; A second question, for Alan Kennington.. (I hope this hasn't already been
&gt; discussed, i haven't checked any archives)
&gt; Whereabouts did you get the statistics for the statement that any online
&gt; server is potentially cracked five times every hour?

My own 3 IP subnets are my primary source of evidence.
And other people have confirmed that they get probed that often too.
Of course, you have to set up your firewall to at least log all
probes. Otherwise you won't see them.
The rates change according to the time of week, time of day,
and special events, such as 4 May for chinese hackers.
Some people seem to be in regions of IP number space which
don't get so many hack attempts though.
And I think that masny people just don't have sensitive logging set-ups
for all the probes. So they just see very little of what's
going on out there.

I'll just summarise 2001 May 4 (things got hotter in the couple days after
May 4 actually).

00:27 probe of all UDP ports 53 on locnet 1 by 202.101.165.37
00:33 probe of all UDP ports 53 on locnet 1 by 202.159.26.162
01:12 probe of TCP port 111 on PPP subnet by 200.206.135.67
01:32 probe of all UDP port 53 on locnet 1 by 213.59.244.101
01:40 ICMP probe on PPP subnet by 212.118.133.134 
02:15 attempt to access port 25 on non-existent host by 64.4.14.168
02:17 probe of port 515 on PPP subnet by 210.236.92.77
02:16 two more port 25 attempts by 64.4.14.168
02:22 attempt to access port 443 on non-exist IP host by 195.92.95.23
Further attempts to access port 25 on non-existent host by 64.4.14.168
    every 10 minutes or so ad nauseam.
04:47 probe of locnet 2 port 53 by 202.99.170.34
05:59 probe of UDP port 1680 on PPP subnet by 139.130.87.241
06:05 probe of UDP port 31337 on PPP subnet by 145.236.193.45
07:11 probe of TCP port 515 on subnet 1 by 24.168.102.21

Plus various pings attempts to non-existent virtual hosts,
and untracked packets which are dropped by the NAT module.

Well, that's a tiny sample.
It's tiring to write this all out.
The above amounts to only about 2 probes per hour.
But it's highly variable.
So some hours it is 5 or more probes in one hour,
and sometimes you go a whole hour without a (visible) probe.
I would say it averages 2/hour on an average day.
It all depends on whether the students are on holiday or not.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
