Hi,

&gt; At work we currently have about 20 PC's dual booting win98/linux (rh 7.1),
&gt; and 5 mac's running OS8.6.  What I need is some sort of method to allow
&gt; ANYONE to login to any of those, and have several drives mapped.  The
&gt; drives would be on a server running NT4, and several linux servers with
&gt; kernels 2.4.2 and 2.2.14.
&gt; 
&gt; I am in favor of samba in this situation since we are catering to the
&gt; windows users for the most part.  The macs can use appletalk.

Incase you don't know of it, investigate netatalk for the Macs. There is
also a product to allow authentication to Unix server that I have ssen
running in Computing Science at Adelaide Uni. I've no idea what it is.

&gt; The main problem is authentication; what is the most graceful method for
&gt; authenticating users from a mac, linux or windows workstation?  The NT4
&gt; box is currently the PDC as well.  In the future we are going to be
&gt; providing FTP access to users as well.
&gt; 
&gt; All user management will be dome through a web interface.  I figured that
&gt; if I used samba for authentication it would simplify things.  A user
&gt; changes their password via the web interface, smbpasswd is called to
&gt; change their samba password, and their password would be changed in the
&gt; glftpd user file (or proftpd).
&gt; 
&gt; I do NOT want to install NIS/NFS on anything here.  Money is somewhat of
&gt; an issue, as well as my time.
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions?

For Unix Authentication use LDAP or NIS. There is a LADAP authentication
module for NT, but I've never used it. SAMBA can be a PDC, but you'll need
to look at SAMBA 2.  or Samba TNG (I don't know which has the better PDC
code in it. My understanding is that 2.2 has the TNG code merged into
it. I'm sure others will correct me if I'm wrong).

Hope this makes a start.

cya
