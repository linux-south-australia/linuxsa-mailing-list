Hi,

I've installed RH 7.1 on a new machine, and connected it to the network.
All seems well, the hub light is on, the machine can ping other hosts on our
network, and on the internet, and can also be pinged by hosts on the
network.  The machine has one 10Base-T PCI NIC configured as eth0, with a
static IP address.  The problem is that no services on the machine are
accessible via its network IP address.  i.e.. From the console a "telnet
localhost 25" gives me the sendmail greeting message, but "telnet
203.38.230.9 25" gives me a "Unable to connect to remote host: Connection
refused" message.

When I installed RH7.1 I selected "medium" firewall protection believing
that this would allow access to the services on the machine, and I've since
use lokkit to change the firewalling to "No Protection" but that doesn't
seem to have helped either...

Has anyone seen this before?  Any ideas on where to start?

Jim.
