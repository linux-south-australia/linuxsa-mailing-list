&gt; &gt; with some SMTP servers you can switch on case sensitivity for this

&gt; Unix userids are effectively case sensitive.  For example, my userid is
&gt; different to the another, DavidN, which I just created.  Userids are also
&gt; the standard mailbox name (ie to the left of the @).  A case insensitive
&gt; MTA would probably be broken.  I notice that sendmail very nicely sends
&gt; DavidN's mail to me.  That's what I mean by broken.

I've looked into this a bit.  Whatever you want to call this behaviour,
I'm quite sure that it is what every MTA of worth (and many of no worth:-)
does. Two extracts from authorities, authors of Postfix and Exim
respectively:

&gt; Wietse Venema schrieb:

&gt; However, you have to bear in mind that any Postfix address rewriting
&gt; that involves lookup tables or regular expressions is case insensitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Reason for the case insensitivity: even though RFCs say that the
&gt; left-hand side case should be preserved, it is not reasonable to
&gt; expect that remote senders will remember the "right" CaPiTaLiZaTiOn
&gt; of an email address. It just is not practical.

And Philip Hazel says in doc/spec.txt:

&gt; RFC 822 states that the case of letters in the local parts of addresses
&gt; cannot be assumed not to be significant. Exim preserves the case of local
&gt; parts of remote addresses. However, when it is processing an address in
&gt; one of its local domains, the case of letters in the local part is
&gt; significant only when locally_caseless is unset. This option is set by
&gt; default, and this causes Exim to lowercase local parts in local domains
&gt; before processing them.

If Postfix can't do case sensitivity and Exim and Sendmail don't by
default, I think that is a pretty authoritative sample of how things Are
To Be Done.
