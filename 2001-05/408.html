&gt;Supposing I wanted to have a "recursive resolver" out there
&gt;for one LAN which I don't have DNS on, can you recommend
&gt;which I might use?
&gt;Does it really annoy DNS server operators to have other
&gt;people sponging on their DNS bandwidth?
&gt;

Alan,

see these posts from Telstra about their nameservers, if you were subscribed 
to outage notices you should have got them a while back....

-----TELSTRA POST-----
Important DNS Infrastructure Change

In an effort to continue providing highly available Internet services, 
Telstra Big Pond Direct will be disabling recursive DNS lookups on 
ns0.telstra.net (139.130.204.47) and ns1.telstra.net (139.130.4.5) on 
Wednesday April 11th, 2001 at 0900AEST.

A recursive lookup is when a name server that does not have a domain name 
configured locally, is required to ask another name server on the Internet 
for the hostname or IP Address of a remote host.

You are not required to alter the delegation of your domain name(s). 
ns0.telstra.net and ns1.telstra.net will continue to function as the 
authoritative name servers for any of your domain name(s) that are delegated 
there.

DNS lookups directed towards 139.130.204.47 or 139.130.4.5 for domain names 
that are not hosted by those servers, will fail from this date onwards. 
Customers running any equipment configured to query these name servers for 
DNS information will be required to change the relevant settings to the 
following:

Primary DNS Server     139.130.4.4
Secondary DNS Server*     203.50.2.71

*These hosts are geographically separate and will provide added redundancy 
in the case of a name server or Point of Presence failure.

These settings should be used in the configuration of equipment such as:
Name Server settings for client devices within your network
/etc/resolv.conf on Unix-like platforms
"Specifiy Name Server settings" in any RRAS, Dial-Up Networking or other 
Dialer settings within Microsoft Windows or MacOS.
Forwarders statements in Name Servers located within your network
Firewalling equipment that requires DNS resolution
Router "ip name-server" statements
Any other application that requires the specification of a Name Server IP 
Address
ns0.telstra.net and ns1.telstra.net will continue to function as 
authoritative, hosting name servers for any domains configured and correctly 
delegated to them.

For further assistance, please contact Telstra Big Pond Direct on 1800 066 
594, or e-mail <A HREF="mailto:dns@telstra.net">dns@telstra.net</A> with your questions.

You may also be interested in this if you use ACL's on your Name servers 
that use ns1.telstra.net as a secondary.

-----TELSTRA POST-----
The Telstra Secondary (hosting/authoritative) Name Server ns1.telstra.net 
(139.130.4.5) has been relocated to Melbourne, Victoria, in order to provide 
location diversity within the network.

This change has occured with no expected customer impact.

NOTE: Some changes to the use of the DNS have also occured due to this 
outage.

1) Customers running Access Control Lists (ACL's) on their Name Servers for 
AXFR's from our secondary name server, are required to update them to 
include the following IP Addresses and ranges:

139.130.4.5 (unchanged)
203.50.0.24 (unchanged)
203.50.2.74
203.50.1.64-127 (203.50.1.64/26 or 203.50.1.64/255.255.255.192)

2) ns1.telstra.net will now reload ONCE every 24hrs, therefore the addition 
of NEW domain names or the removal of OLD domain names on ns1 will take up 
to 24hrs.

NOTE: this does not affect changes to domain names already in production on 
ns1.telstra.net

Hope this helps,


Regards,
Michael
