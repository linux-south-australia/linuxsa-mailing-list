Maybe my use of the term 'God-like' was incorrect. They certainly did,
however regard themselves many levels above the rest.

&gt; I hope not.  Lenin and Stalin were effectively the next Tsars.

One could say that, though there approach to 'leadership' was slightly
different. This did have a lot to do with the time in which they were in
power, though.

What this has to do with Linux I do not know, so I think I'll leave my
comments on Russian History at that.
