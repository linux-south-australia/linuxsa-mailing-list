&gt; &gt; My understanding is that /tmp is a virtual storage with its contents
&gt; &gt; deleted when the system boots.
&gt;
&gt; Your understanding is incorrect.  On a standard RedHat 6 system, /tmp is
&gt; a disk based file system, not memory based.  It could be that /tmp
&gt; resides on its own file system (or occupies the file system of another),
&gt; and may be approching full.  In either case, executing "df -k /tmp"
&gt; should show you the free space available.

Note for the unaware: on Sun Solaris (and presumably other Unices), /tmp is
actually an fs made of unused swap space -- you give the system swap space
(partition(s) or file(s)), then mount this as the /tmp filesystem. Hence, it
is disk-based, but is affected by RAM usage. A friend of mine (hi!) was
confused by this once when doig a `df -k /tmp` and noticing that the total
space on the /tmp partition changed over time... As I recall, he ended up
calling Sun Support, as no-one at his workplace had heard of this before,
and it took them some time to realise what was going on... :)

Note that in this case, /tmp is most certainly deleted on boot... Also note
that some Linux systems have a script set up to clear the directory on boot
(/var/tmp is usually persistent over boots). Also note that sometimes, /tmp
and /var/tmp are symlinked to the same place, so you can't make any
assumptions about this :) ... Finally, try `du  /tmp | sort -n` to see what
files and/or directories are taking up the most space in /tmp ... A bit of
experimentation, and you'll soon know what combination of swap fs, symlinks,
delete-on-boot and whatever else your system has :)
