Get it right people, as far as Telstra is concerned they
never ever have faults or outages,
they just have "UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE"

seems that lately they have been having a lot of unscheduled
maintenance on way4 :) routing problems, connectivitiy probs,
et al. ahhh thank god Whyalla is on way-core1 mind you that still ends up 
going through 4 anyway :( but I haven't experienced any problems so far from 
Whyalla. [touches wood]

A couple of weeks ago I did a trace from the SARNO looking glass to my 
server in whyalla, and it went from there to optus in Mel, then telstra Mel, 
then Telstra Adl, then Telstra Per, then Telstra Darwin, then Telstra Adl 
AGAIN then finally to whyalla. It appears that Way4 lost the ability to 
route to way-core1 :)

Telstra, hah, making life easier.... When??? I have yet to see that yet.

&gt;&gt;  &gt; Cynical response coming...
&gt;  &gt; Telstra: THANKS FOR TELLING US!
&gt;
&gt;Don't laugh.  They seem to have very little in the way of fault
&gt;monitoring, and rely on complaints from customers to get the
&gt;fualts into the system.
&gt;
&gt;I've lost count of the number of times they've only worked out that
&gt;way4.Adelaide.telstra.net is down because I've called in a fault (way4
&gt;is the router which most of Telstra's regional network is plugged in
&gt;to; when it's down, they usually lose Mount Gambier, Kangaroo Island,
&gt;Port Pirie and Murray Bridge, all places where we have infrastructure
&gt;connected to BPD...)
&gt;
&gt;I've often suggested that if they gave me their mobile phone numbers
&gt;I'd be able to arrange to have our own monitoring system send them
&gt;SMS messages when their routers go down.  But for some reason they're
&gt;reluctant to give me mobile numbers... :-)
