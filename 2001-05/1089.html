&gt; It's all about supply and demand. If an ISP has the capacity (in

&gt; $1000/year for this service, then that is the market price.

My point is that the market price is being determined by the ignorance
of the customers. If everyone out there knew what was really involved
in setting up DNS, no ISP would be able to get away with charging such
a high fee for almost nothing at all.

&gt; Stop implying it's somehow evil or wrong -- it's a free market.

Many factors make up the concept of "free market", and consumers talking
to each other and sharing information is one of them.

I think it's wrong to be charged $250 a year when I know it's really just
some sloth typing in a couple of lines and $249 of that money will end up
being pure profit for the company.

The more people who share my opinion, the more pressure is brought on ISPs
to charge a fair amount of money for their services. The more I talk about
this, the more likely more people will share my opinion. The more people
complaining about unfair pricing, the more likely it will be that I will
be able to pay a fair price in future.

So, this little segment of the free market is operating just fine.
