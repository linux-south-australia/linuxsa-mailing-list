John,

&gt; 1. I need to set up my NIC on eth0 on a Debian 2.2 system; I know
&gt; that I have to configure it via the /etc/network/interfaces file;
&gt; however I am unsure as to what information and how to put it in. (ip
&gt; address is 192.168.1.1)

Try something like in /etc/network/interfaces

---
  auto lo eth0

  # The loopback interface
  iface lo inet loopback

  # The ethernet interface, configured by etherconf
  iface eth0 inet static
	  address 192.168.1.1
	  netmask 255.255.255.0
	  gateway 192.168.1.2
---

Then run, as root, "ifdown -a; ifup -a".

Debian provides some examples in the /usr/share/doc/ifupdown/examples
directory (sorry this directory may be different for you as I'm
running Progeny on this machine.  Try running "locate
network-interface" if I'm wrong)

&gt; 2. How can I set up pon, or pppd to log to another file?? I've looked at 
&gt; syslog, but I am confused as to actually how to set it up...

Check out /etc/syslog.conf.. 

PPPD logs to facility daemon with level debug (from pppd man page).
Therefore by default in Debian you will see PPPD messages appear
/var/log/messages and /var/log/debug.  You'll need to pick these
sections out of /etc/syslog.conf if you want to log to different files
and restart syslogd.

&gt; 3. If I want to set up my own firewall settings on a debian 2.2
&gt; machine, how can I get them to load on boot?

If you want to load them at boot then you should create a script with
all of your rules and place it in the /etc/init.d directory.  Make
sure it runs properly and then place a symbolic link from a file in
the /etc/rcS.d directory to link to the actual file in /etc/init.d.
Make sure it runs before the interfaces come up otherwise you may open
your firewall up for a short time before the firewall scripts run
(slightly pedantic I know).  Make sure the name of the link starts
with a number less than the script that starts the interfaces
(S40network configures interfaces on my Deb box so S35myfirewallscript
is probably not be a bad choice).

BTW IPChains will allow you to create rules for interfaces before they
exist so should not be a problem.  

&gt; Thankyou in advance, for any help or suggestions

Regards in the present,
Michael
