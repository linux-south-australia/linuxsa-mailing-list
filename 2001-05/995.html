Nah, the DNS pricing is definitely a gouge. It's an identifiable service
that can be a separate item on a bill. If it didn't have the special name
"DNS", you'd be paying $1 a year for bandwidth/load.

All the links, redundancy, administrators, and other things that make
running an ISP an expensive endeavour are already required to support
the base services - dialups, bandwidth, and connectivity.

The true cost of running an ISP is a very complicated calculation.

Calling up on a dialin line on a Sunday night costs more for the ISP than
calling on a Monday afternoon. To cater for peak times, more lines have
to be installed than are needed at other times.

Getting data locally is cheaper than getting it from overseas, unless
it's over satellite or it's cached or it's from Telstra, or or or. So
many factors are involved in calculating the true cost, it pretty much
changes by the minute.

The bill that the ISP sends out to the customer is almost a fabrication.
Very little of the real costs the customer has run up translates directly
to the charges being imposed on the customer.

Charging more money for 16 IP addresses than 4 IP addresses has no
technical basis in reality. It's just something extra that can be put on
the bill. If the user has more computers, they're gonna NAT anyway.

Want a static IP? It's just a quick entry in a text file. Want some DNS?
Copy and touch up a couple of small files. Want a block routed to you?
Make a change in the user profile. It's all trivial, and in no way does
it translate to the $150 and $200 and $250's on the final bill.

Customers don't ask for these things often, but it's important when they
do - so every ISP out there feasts on these kinds of requests.
