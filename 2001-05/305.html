&gt;Last I heard, neither of the big players seem to have any interest so far
&gt;in any city that isn't Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.
&gt;
&gt;Don't know if this is going to change though.

&gt; &gt; Hi List,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen/had cable setup for net access in SA? If so which areas?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems attractive more so than ADSL at this point. Any opinions?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks
&gt; &gt;

This changed just a few weeks ago, with Cable access now available in areas 
with Foxtel cable laid in Adelaide - though, no new cable will be laid into 
areas that don't already have it.

Full details on availability (you can input your address to find out if you 
have access) and pricing & plans is at:

<A HREF="http://www.bigpond.com/broadband/">http://www.bigpond.com/broadband/</A>

If you already have Foxtel cable in your house (whether as a current 
subscriber to Foxtel, or the premises were previously connected) then there 
is currently a special offer with a connection fee discount ($50 off) if 
you sign up for at least 12 months - and you get the first month free if 
you sign up on an 18 month plan, as well.

Full details of the special offer is at:

<A HREF="http://www.bigpond.com/broadband/now/">http://www.bigpond.com/broadband/now/</A>


If you need an ethernet card, the tech. will slot in an SMC 1211TX card for 
you.

Speed may become an issue some time in the future, as the bandwidth is 
shared with your neighbours.  If you're the first one on the block with it, 
then I suppose you won't have a problem just yet.

Which leads to the question: How many users need to be connected before 
there is a noticeable degradation in the service?

Cheers,

Peter
