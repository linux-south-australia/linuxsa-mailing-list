&gt; You're right it's been done to death.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I don't know where the idea of capped accounts including 650MB came
&gt; &gt;from. $24.95 barely covers the cost of leasing the line from Telstra.
&gt; &gt;Providers *aren't* happy to offer this.
&gt;
&gt; Ozemail at least offer this via dialup with no time limits.
I think you should read the terms of service a bit closer,

"Dialup sessions may be limited to a maximum session length and idle time
out as published on the OzEmail Access Points Web page. Automated methods to
avoid disconnection due to inactivity are not permitted. "

"56Kbps X2 modems will only be able to connect to OzEshout POPs at a maximum
speed of 33.6Kbps. "

"This service is offered for use on a consumer basis only. It is not
intended to be used for commercial or other purposes. It is not for resale.
Indicators of commercial use are hours of use and data download volumes. As
a guide where 650MB of data or more is downloaded per month over two or more
monthly periods this is indicative of commercial use. We reserve the right
to have your access restricted or suspended for misuse of the service for
commercial purposes. "

"Subject to existing agreements this offer may be changed or withdrawn at
any time. "

"OzEmail Members subscribing to OzEshout may remain connected for up to 4
hours in a single dial-up session and can reconnect as often as required. A
20 minute idle timeout also applies"

Which they have done before (this offer is basically the same as the
Megasaver offe when it first came out , which they changed 3 times and now
is 150 hours per a month.
Also you have to agree to a 12 month contract, scared yet ? beacuse they can
change the prices, limits on you at any time. If you redial every four hours
to stay on 24 hours a day your looking at close to 40 dollars a month in
local phone calls.
