&gt; The server has a HP dds-3 scsi tape drive, with which HPs 
&gt; Tapeware XE was included.  I've yet to install Tapeware to evaluate
&gt; it but on first looks it seems to be a standalone version with not a 
&gt; whole lot of LAN functionality (ie, workstation control)

TapeWare (well, the version that I've tried) seems to be reasonable,
though I had some trouble backing up multiple hosts to one tape.

It has the Workstation control that you speak of -- the 'TapeWare
Administrator' runs on many platforms including Linux and Windows.

I've not tried it on a big server, only 6-7GB.

&gt; I must admit that I'm a bit spoilt in having another Samba server running
&gt; Arcserve f/ Linux, which is brilliant, but this server's owners arent going
&gt; to
&gt; shell out that much for backup software (dont blame them either)

How have you found Arcserve? I was looking at it at one stage to provide
multiplatform backup, ie:

+--------+        +--------+        +----------+
| Novell |-------&gt;| Linux  |&lt;-------| Linux W3 |
+--------+        | Backup |        +----------+
                  | Server |
                  +--------+

Essentially centralising backup to the one machine, which palms it off
to tapes. I'd imagine there may be problems (or 'issues') when you want
to restore something from the WWW server which is half way through the
tape. Don't know for certain, however.

&gt; I'm d/l Amanda at present to check that out, have heard some good 
&gt; reports about it.

Amanda seems really cool. I think the biggest detracting factor about
Amanda was how (seemingly) difficult it was to configure.
