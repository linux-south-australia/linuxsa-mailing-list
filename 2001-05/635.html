Its ok, I can live with a world in which Macs are only being used by 
creative people.

Its a bit like Linus' attitude to Linux - he doesn't really mind 
whether other people like Linux, as long as -he- likes it. That's my 
attitude with respect to my Macintosh. For me, its the most 
productive option available. That doesn't automatically make it yours.

Mac OS-X, running on a FreeBSD derivative open source operating 
system core, yet able to run nearly all Mac applications including 
microsloth office, is pretty close to heaven.

Finally, I have a laptop on which I can run word and excel (sorry, 
but they're necessary evils in my world), *and* code in perl and gcc 
at the same time, with  a pretty good and modern GUI. It comes 
pre-loaded with all the right tools, including apache and ssh etc etc 
- and it doesn't crash.

I use an intel PC emulator (Virtual PC) on it when I need to, which 
is 100% able to run Winblows applications, or indeed to run Linux, 
without a hitch.

I've waited for this for a long time. It'll change things in a major way.

I can't get this environment running Linux

I can't get this environment running Windows.

I -can- get it on my Mac.

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; On the negative side, he used a Mac.
&gt;  &gt; But it's ok, he's dead now.
&gt;
&gt;Mac users generally don't run MS Windows.  I see this as a positive.
&gt;Either way, he's learned his lesson now.
