*really* *really* Off-topic -- reply to me only, and I will CC it to anyone
else who gets involved in this thread...

IMHO, there are two ways to influence companies to act "morally":

1) Legislation -- the ballot slip
2) Market Forces -- the wallet/purse

Of course, each individual only has as much influence as their own ballot
slip (equal with everyone else, simplistically speaking) and/or wallet
(dependant on personal wealth). Of course, money buys votes too, but let's
not go there. In either of these cases, you generally need either a very big
(full) wallet (Packer style), or a lot of people's wallets and/or ballot
slips. Either way, you really need to influence lots of people.

Personally, I've always wanted to see a list, compiled by some trustworthy
body, that contains details of which companies indulge in what practices and
so on, so I can adapt my spending to suit. For eg, it would be nice to know
what proportion of goods made by company X are made in Australia, which
countries own it, what environmentally damaging (or potentially damaging)
activities are carried out by it, what proportion of software they use is
Australian-made, OS-made, Open Source, and so on... I don't know if this
really is sensible or not, and I don't know if it would be doable.

Any opinions? Would you pay for access to such a list? Would you advocate
the Government setting it up and funding it (ie paying via your taxes)?
Would it influence you? Do you think it could influence the market as a
whole? Would it be possible to do in an unbiased, fair manner? Is it
economically viable? Could someone make money from it -- perhaps on a
non-profit basis? Could I patent it? (I guess not, as this is a public forum
:)

rr

PS not that I'm proposing doing it or anything, I was just wondering about
the idea of increasing people's awareness of these issues and which
companies are doing what -- could help counter FUD like the Panadol/Herron
thing (where Herron are Aust-owned, but _apparently_ make most of their
product overseas)...

PPS I know, this is waaaaaaay off-topic, and it could easily blow up (or
fizzle), so please reply only to me... ta
