Hello! I haven't been subscribed for ages because I'm too undisciplined
and end up spending all my time on email when I'm on the list, but I've
run in to a problem and come begging for help :)

I don't have linux installed, and would like to boot into fdisk.  I don't
have any linux cds either. Can somebody please give me an indication of
something I could download and install to a floppy so I can activate
fdisk? Would picoBSD be a good thing to download? I don't need a
distribution, just enough to get fdisk working so I can recover some data.

(this is the story behind it, which is irrelevent but might be of
interest)
On the weekend I was playing around with QNX, and was using win2k to try
and delete the partiton I'd created (after I'd finished with it). Anyway,
win2k decided to destroy the whole partitioning arrangement when I wanted
it to just delete a single partition, and after panicing and doing some
silly things with various other operating systems, I haven't been able to
fix things properly and may well have made things worse. I suspect the
data is still there, and have been able to recover one partition (NTFS)
through rewriting an old partition table image in beos.  However, another
partition (fat16 I think) should be on the disk (and contains two years
work, nothing crucial, but lots of frustration to lose :) ). I figure if
the data on the ntfs one hadn't been destroyed, the fat data is probably
OK too. In the past I've noticed that if you use linux to create a
partition of exactly the same size as one you've just deleted, the data is
retained. I know the boundaries down to the cylinder I'd have to recreate
in order to 'refence' my fat partition (aah documentation).
