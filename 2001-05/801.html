&gt; Unless of course, you had a 'switched hub'. They were marketed quite a
&gt; bit a year or two ago. I believe they provided full duplex.

Quick Ethernet tutorial of duplex and auto negotiation.


EQUIPMENT TYPES

Coax and non-switching hubs are half-duplex.  These
can not do auto negotiation.  Speed is 10.

Switching hubs can be half-duplex or full duplex on each
port.  These ports can auto-negotiate.  Speeds are 10,
10/100 or 1000 (or rarely just 100).

NIC cards can be
 - half duplex with no negotiation capability
 - full duplex or half duplex with negotiation capability
Speeds are 10, 10/100, 1000.

Copper cabling for 1000 differs from that used for 10, 100
and 10/100 so we'll ignore 1000 for now.


AUTO NEGOTIATION PROCESS

Auto negotiation is simple
 - listen for negotiation from other end of wire
 - if found
     set duplex to highest common value
     (full if both NIC and hub port support full)
     set speed to highest common value
   else
     set half duplex (as you are connected to a
     non-negotiating non-switched hub)


DEFAULT SETTINGS

Manufacturers now ship hubs so that out-of-the-box the ports are
set to
  auto negotiate: on
  speed: (negotiate)
  duplex: (negotiate)

Because some otherwise-smart people don't get autonegotiation,
Linux makes it hard to set the NIC card to anything other than
  auto negotiate: on
  speed: (negotiate)
  duplex: (negotiate)


DEFAULT OPERATION

So you plug the two out-of-the-box devices together and the switch says
  auto negotiate: on
  speed: negotiated 100
  duplex: negotiated full duplex
and the NIC says
  auto negotiate: on
  speed: negotiated 100
  duplex: negotiated full duplex
and all is right with the world.

Things continue to be right if you plug that NIC into an old
non-switching hub, which have
  auto negotiate: off, can't do it
  speed: 10 (no other choice)
  duplex: half (no other choice)
  SQE: set it off!
so the NIC decides
  auto negotiation: on
  speed: no negotiation heard, so 10 for compatibility
  duplex: no negotiation heard, so half for compatibility

Similarly, things continue to be right if you have an old
NIC card
  auto negotiate: off, can't do it
  speed: 10
  duplex: half
and plug it into the an out-of-the-box switch port
  auto negotiation: on
  speed: no negotiation heard, so 10 for compatibility
  duplex: no negotiation heard, so half for compatibility

And of course, an old card in an old non-switching hub works too.
Card:
  auto negotiate: off, can't do it
  speed: 10
  duplex: half
Hub:
  auto negotiate: off, can't do it
  speed: 10
  duplex: half


THE COMMON ERROR

The major consequence of all the above is if you set your NIC to
  auto negotiate: off
  duplex: full
and the switch is still set to its default of
  auto negotiate: on
  speed: (negotiate)
  duplex: (negotiate)
then the switch will guess
  speed: no negotiation heard, so 10 for compatibility [1]
  duplex: no negotiation heard, so half duplex for compatibility
As the duplex settings don't match you will get ethernet
errors and thus sucky performance.

If you turn off auto negotiate then you must turn off
auto negotiation at the other end and manually set
both ends to be identical.


THE LESSON

Ethernet settings at both ends *must* be identical,
this includes the auto negotiate setting.


EXCEPTIONS

For some very old switches you need to explicitly turn
auto-negotiation on, they don't ship with it on out
of the box.

For some very early 100Mbps cards auto-negogitation doesn't
work (those cards based on the first revision of the DEC
Tulip). The simplest solution in this case is to acknowledge
that the chip design is faulty and bin the card.  Alternatively,
you can set the NIC to
  auto negotiate: off
  speed: 100
  duplex: full
and the switch port to
  auto negotiate: off
  speed: 100
  duplex: full
but you will buy a world of pain if the switch port or
NIC is ever used for any other connection.

All the above applies to copper.  There is no negotiation
over fiber, so you may as well set the best throughput
possible
  auto negotiation: not available
  speed: select first of: 1000, 100, 10
  duplex: select first of: full, half
  SQE: on for switches, off for non-switched hubs and coax
remembering that both ends need to have identical settings.


THE FUNDAMENTAL LESSON

Turn on auto negotiation AT BOTH ENDS.  Leave it on.  Don't fiddle
with it.  Don't tamper.  Don't touch the blinkenlights.


Hope this helps,
Glen

 [1] Although the speeds might show as "100" when the NIC card
     is asked, as ethernet frames are clocked so any card worth
     its salt will replace a "10" with a "100" if it has acquired
     that clock rate.
