&gt;&gt; But hang on, where are you putting the digital modems? Normally, you would
&gt;&gt; use a Cisco 5300 for that sort of thing, I though.
&gt;
&gt;Looking at Cisco 3661. It has ethernet and 6 expansion slots. Digital
&gt;modem cards as well as PRI interfaces are optional modules that can be
&gt;added (albiet at a price).

Yes, I have seen the 3600 before, I just wasn't aware that the 30-port
modem card went into one.

&gt;&gt; Anyway, why don't you look into Telstra's Dial-Connect, and then just bring
&gt;&gt; one 2Mbps frame relay or some such into your premises.
&gt;
&gt;Could this 'Dial-Connect' service be what is on their website as 'Dial
&gt;IP'. It seems to me that it's a 'Virtual ISP' type of arrangement,
&gt;except, not :-) 
&gt;They tunnel the dialup users to your network from which they can go out
&gt;onto the Internet using your link.

Well, yes they do, but it is a matter of cost and hassle etc.

Do you want the hassle of owning the dial-up infrastructure your self, or
do you want someone else to do it for you?

&gt;Seems almost like paying twice to me. I wonder if it would be acceptable
&gt;for the tunnel to go through a current Internet connection rather than a
&gt;Frame Relay connection. Being a school, the cost of Frame Relay is
&gt;somewhat of an issue.

Well, the MegaLink is going to cost you, surely?

I doubt that Telstra would be interested in using someone else's tunnel,
and come to think of it, the Dial-Connect services I have been involved
with all involved a Telstra-managed Cisco as the endpoint of the tunnel.

&gt;&gt; You could even then use Linux with a Sangoma Frame Relay card ...
&gt;
&gt;Maybe, though it'd not be after a hell of a lot of reassurance that that
&gt;card and its drivers are stable enough to be the core of a dialup pool.

The cards are used world-wide. There is even someone in Adelaide using them
between Adelaide and Melbourne.
