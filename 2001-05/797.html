Ben,

&gt; i believe the partition mandrake is on is /dev/hdb1? i'm not 100% sure. my
&gt; system has 2 physical HDs (and a CDRom & floppy). the first HD is windows
&gt; only and is partitioned into 3 bits (these should be /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2,
&gt; /dev/hda3, is that right?) and the second is not partitioned and only has
&gt; mandrake on it (that should make it /dev/hdb1? i think?).

That would be correct, from what you have said. When you boot the Mandrake
disk, you might want to type something like:

lilo:  linux root=/dev/hdb1

Alternatively, you might want to try Tom's Root Disk. I use it a fair bit,
and it is a great little disk. If you can't find it, I could probably find a
.zip of it somewhere that I can send to you.

I don't recall seeing your original message on the list...

Normally, yes, but I think this question is pre-version!  Doesn't matter
what version of redhat he has if he can't boot it... :)

&gt; What partition(s) has RedHat been installed to? (i.e. /dev/hda3)

This is perhaps the most important question. Where is your root partiction?
That will affect the command you would need to give the boot disk. See my
comments above.

Actually, re-reading your question, did you install lilo in the master boot
record, or did you install it in the root partition? If you did the latter
(which it sounds like) you will need to load FDISK under WinME and set the
Linux partition active.
