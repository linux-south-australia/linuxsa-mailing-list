Andrew et al,

&gt;
&gt;Why wouldn't the AUP apply to your plan. Or for that matter, any plan.
&gt;Without it, I could sit for weeks copying AARNet &gt;/dev/null and Telstra
&gt;wouldn't be able to do anything about it.[1]
&gt;
rhetrocial I think he said it does apply. A friend of mine on OPtus had his
account suspended because of excessive downloads in a short period, mind
you he is not a big user but it was coincidental new patches etc (and
probably mp3s, DivXs) all came out at the same time I think discipline is
called for with AUPs. 

In truth I can see the attraction for downloading the internet (because you
can) but realistically providers and consumers will eventually settle on
reasonable use. The one point about AUPs which is annoying is the
definition of acceptable use is in the minds of the provider. 

viz : 
	For a gamer 1 hour of online gaming with any of the Id games will result
in approximately 10-15 mb of data most gamers will average 2-3 hours a day
4 days a week, hardcore gamers 8/7 will clearly need around 400mb a week
for gaming allowing for other baggage such as surfing and downloads. It
becomes obvious you can easily get up to 2gb in a month, IMO this is
reasonable. The oocasional single gb download session like isos etc should
also be tolerated but not on a daily basis.


&gt;&gt; It is slightly cheaper than telstra adsl, I think we pay $72 per month for
&gt;&gt; the base account and $11 per month for each of the two additonal
&gt;&gt; simultaneous users.
&gt;
&gt;Why not go with Internode ADSL? I don't work for them, but there a
&gt;hellava lot better than Telstra on multiple counts. You're allowed to
&gt;run servers, they encourage NAT devices (and hence more users). Makes
&gt;sense to me.

1. Price (Internode (good that they are) are more expensive because of
their costs from Telstra). The additional value that they offer is
attractive to a lot of people but it is not for 'normal consumers'
2. You can run NAT etc with other ISP's (just don't tell them)
3. Servers are another issue tho, most common ones are smtp/ftp/http. All
of these are exposed via well known ports and subsequently detectable, but
do you really want to run such services as a home user? I can only think of
a need for smtp personally. I don't think game servers are realistic as the
upload speeds to the clients are not sufficient given the rate capping
imposed now on most 512/256 style connections you can't run a game server
for more than 2-3 people anyway and who wants to play on those servers.

&gt;But you've already got cable, so ripping it out and installing ADSL
&gt;might not be an option. Whatsmore, ADSL may not be available in your
&gt;area.

I have both available to me I just don't know which to choose. For a number
of reasons.
Costs are comparative. Except cable offers twice the rate that Adsl does
for the same dollars. But I know I would be happy with 256/64 ADSl or
512/128 cable.

Most people have phone lines, and an increasing number are getting paytv. 
The biggest leaning towards cable is the single feed into the house, which
means I can get paytv (groan nickelodean 24/7).

&gt;&gt; We do a bit of gaming and seem to get pings as low as 30ms in some
&gt;&gt; servers such as the wireplay ones, and no noticable packet loss even while
&gt;&gt; someone was streaming video.

&gt;
&gt;For the time being :-)
&gt;
This problem will exist with ADSL as well I think ultimately the capacity
of the network will be pushed with either. Underconfigured infrastructure,
bad interconnects etc will cause this!

&gt;&gt; We are very ahppy so far, but we have only had it for just over 24
&gt;&gt; hours, so  we dont really have enough experince to see if the service
&gt;&gt; level is typical.

&gt;"so far" is the keyword in this case, I feel. I am happy to be
&gt;corrected, but Cable doesn't seem like the technology that is going to
&gt;be the 'next big thing' like ADSL appears to have become.
&gt;
&gt;I don't trust it, never will :-)
&gt;
From the people I know in the east (yes gamers in the main) ALL the new BP
cable clients are on DOCSIS modems and they are happy. Other older BP
customers who have been using it for a good deal longer have even gone to
lengths of frying their old cable modems and calling up BP and saying 'the
internet is broken' out comes tech with new DOCSIS modem and they are happy.

I am still confused as ever I guess but which way to go if my kids have
their way it's cable + paytv
Apparently fox are offering paytv+cable deals aswell whch I may follow up on.

Regards


Evan
