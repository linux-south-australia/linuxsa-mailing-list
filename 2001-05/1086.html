<H1>[OT] Summary of DNS Delegation Pricing</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
The following is a brief summary of information I've received (some
off-list) on DNS delegation of an existing domain name collated here for
reference.

Disclaimers
-----------

- excludes domain name registration (though some ISPs include it 
  in the price ... see notes),
- just a random sub sample of ISPs.

Schools of Thought
------------------

- you get what you pay for... if its mission critical, consider the real
costs to the ISP of configuration assistance, redundancy, physical
separation of servers, uptime and be prepared to pay.
- this is a gouge, get your mates together and do it your self. Pricing
is plucked from the fundament.

Prices
------

Internode:

 $150 per annum + $65 one off setup 

 "The domain name maintenance fee includes Internode either registering
  a new domain name on your behalf, or redelegating an existing name to 
  our servers. The pricing is the same for either a new or existing 
  domain..." (this is from michelle at internode)


For Virtual Artists (va.com.au):

 ~$110 per annum ($99 + GST)


Senet:

 $275 per annnum + $275 setup (definitely excludes name rego)


BigBlue ISP (didn't check if this includes name rego too):

 $140 per annum + $45 one off setup


www.bur.st and www.mydomain.com:

 el cheapo but perhaps not great for mission critical stuff?


jtr.net.au:

 "Primary and Secondary hosting for $ 66 per domain per year.
 Price includes GST and the setup is $ 22, this only applies if 
 we have to fill out the INA forms to re-delegate. If you do it
 yourself there is no setup cost.


airnet.com.au

 $100 for the re-delegation, and then $150 every 2 years for
 .com.au domains after that, starting from whenever the domain 
 next expires

 ...also offer a DNS only service for $25 pa. So, if you are
 happy with being the domain contacts, and can deal with the
 registration/re-registration/payments/delegation for the domain
 with MelbourneIT/INWW, then you can get it really cheap!

Certainly an interesting spectrum of responses. My thanks to all who
responded and in particular to the ppl who generously offered to help
for free. 

Given that its mission critical, I would probably go for Internode
because I really like their service (and I've been really happy with
their ADSL offering). However, the feeling of "pricing is the same for
either a new or existing domain" bites after shelling out to Melbourne
IT for the name already. Choices, choices - and thank god theres no
monopoly.:-)
