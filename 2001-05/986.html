&gt;&gt; I shouldn't be able to punch non-authorative requests through

&gt; I'm afraid I don't have any idea whether that should or should
&gt; not be possible.

"Should not" - this is exactly what Telstra did to their "name
servers" recently, as you should recall, to reduce the load on
their servers.

I think it was Glen who stated it last time; name serving and
name resolving are two separate functions, that BIND combines
into the same package.

&gt; Where would I read up on what my "named" _should_ do?

Your name resolving should be limited to those people whom
you want to use it, namely your internal LAN.

&gt; I have the O'REilly BIND book, and have read lots of
&gt; docs and manuals on BIND.

I don't have BIND installed any conveniently, but it can
have an ACL applied somewhere to limit this.

&gt; That looks like what all DNS servers do.

No - again[1], resolving and serving are two different things.

Name serving is mapping names to values for which you are
authorative - topology.org and all those other myriad domains
you're probably hosting.

Name _resolving_ involves looking up other name servers
for those mappings - preferably the correct ones

&gt; Or do I have to lock down DNS against hackers too?

With BIND, that seems to be a given.

&gt; It's quite annoying that any
&gt; machine connected permanently to the net needs so much nursing.

Mine's fine, but I don't use BIND, and it's much less of a
pig on resources for a "firewall class box".

separate functions".
