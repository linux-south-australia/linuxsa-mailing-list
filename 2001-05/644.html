Nick burbled:
&gt; When I log on, I like to use as few characters in my username as
&gt; possible.. so I always try for "nickm" :)  (plus nickm sounds kinda
&gt; cool)

Why not go one step further and go for 'nm'?
It follows the unix convention of shortening everything to the minimum
possible number of characters, and you could almost get away with saying
"my nm is nm". 

Of course, readability takes a bit of a hit.

Remember the Stonecutters episode of the Simpsons?
I can't quote verbatim, but a line went something like this..

"Marge, finally I've found a society that treats me like a real
person. They looked deep into my heart, and assigned me a number based on
the order in which I joined."
 -- Homer Jay Simpson


Anyway, why can't you just give them a &gt;8 character username?

OK, so you're going to want to change your PS1 to something compact, say
PS1="[\w]$ "
but otherwise it seems fine to me?

8 character limits just remind me of DOS...

&gt; I've seen a few.
&gt; 
&gt; Me, Nick Morrison, for example, has been known as:
&gt; 
&gt;   morrisn
&gt;   nickm
&gt;   nmorrison
&gt;   morrinl
&gt;   nickelodeon
&gt;   nick.morrison
&gt;   stimpy
&gt; 
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen (I can't bloody remember where) a document arguing that
&gt; because of limiting factors such as "there will ALWAYS be two users
&gt; sharing the same name", you should have no 'standard' for naming
&gt; users.
&gt; 
&gt; You could conceivably let them choose their own usernames!  That's
&gt; certainly how I prefer it...
&gt; 
&gt; My suggestion: be as liberated as you can, considering (obviously)
&gt; the boss's perceptions :)
&gt; 
&gt; Other things to consider:  Do you care what the usernames are?
&gt; What will you use them for?  With a properly structured group and
&gt; alias system, you should seldom need to refer to users by their
&gt; username...  Do users care what their usernames are?  Does the
&gt; boss?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; So - if you structure it properly - ie, never make the username the only
&gt; way to find a user - always record the person's full name and department
&gt; or office alongside it (/etc/passwd supports this, so does LDAP, so does
&gt; MS)
&gt; 
&gt; Remember the purpose of a username.  not that I know what it is... 
&gt; but I know what it isn't!  It isn't:  - a way to record the user's name,
&gt; - a way to record the user's function (often), - a way to record where
&gt; the user is...
&gt; 
&gt; But, that said, it all varies anyway, so I'll conclude by saying
&gt; "It's All Relative" ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Blah blah blah.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Guys, I need some opinions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would like to know what some of you use as your username 
&gt; &gt; conventions.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; There's a company wide "Organization" thing happening here 
&gt; &gt; and there's a
&gt; &gt; bunch of restructures involved in our IT department, and 
&gt; &gt; we're changing
&gt; &gt; our organization from being based around a little company with a few
&gt; &gt; people (where standardizations are less important) to a larger growing
&gt; &gt; company with standards in place.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I would like to get some opinions of what people are using 
&gt; &gt; out there in
&gt; &gt; the big wide world.
