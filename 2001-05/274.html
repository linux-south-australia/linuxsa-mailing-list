Thanks to all who replied, both Glen and John have given me ideas to work
with.
As for your question Sean, yup you got it right there will be two physical
networks which must not be connected to each other period.  The primary goal
of my mail to to generate ideas on how to detect such connections (which will
happen when they are side by side throughout a large building.... don't
ask,... it's political)

I have controls by policy and procedure but needed the assurance of automated
rejection in case of error.  The second network for development and  training
will have BSD, LINUX, XP, and  WIN2000 on it for various purposes, however it
will be primarily Linux.

I can't stress enough just how fragile our truce is with the powers to be, if
we goof this one it could force us back to MS only for a long time for every
part of our network, hence my insistence of automated IP identification, and
obviously a shutdown of the Linux server/s with a message indicating to the
user that the physical connection is wrong.

Successful use for a few months will provide evidence (the only language
understood by management) that there is a cost/performance benefit for some
areas that are worth considering.

I know and you know we can subnet it, but, well... there are other influences
outside of our control...

PS the cable and fibre is already installed from many years ago and has not
been used, we are just putting it to some use.

&gt;
&gt; Do I read this correctly, in that you have two possible networks, two
&gt; possible DHCP servers, but you only want to be able to talk to one of the
&gt; DHCP servers?  Are the networks seperate subnets?
&gt;
&gt; If the networks are seperate subnets, add an ipchains rule to disallow
&gt; outbound packets to the forbidden subnet.  You won't be getting useful
&gt; packets out without an address on that subnet anyway.
&gt;
&gt; If the networks are on the same subnet, you want the flexibility of server
&gt; assigned IP addresses for the clients, but do not want to be able to use
&gt; any server as a DHCP server, only the specified one.
&gt;
&gt; How about you add an ipchains rule to reject any DHCP and BOOTP packets
&gt; not coming from the specified server?
