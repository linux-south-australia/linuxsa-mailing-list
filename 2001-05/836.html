Well it's time to give an update to everyone on the ethernet issue...

Finally I have connected to the network under Linux!  I am sending
this email from Linux.  Basically what I did was remove the ethernet
card that was in the machine (the RealTek one), and just use the
onboard (SiS 900) ethernet.  I don't know why the machine had two
ethernets --- I inherited this machine when I started work two weeks
ago.  Anyway, things work now.  I tried the onboard ethernet before
while the RealTek card was in the machine, but it didn't work.  It seems
they didn't like each other --- I don't know why as they had separate
IRQs and memory addresses (I'm pretty sure anyway).

Anyway, that's how things have worked out.  It would be nice to get
to the bottom of the problem and understand what went wrong, but
in the meantime --- I have access to the network!!!

Thanks everyone for your help.

Cheers,

Mark.
