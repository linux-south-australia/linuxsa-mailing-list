&gt; Hmmm, I really would like to have seen a raw capture with:

Sorry Richard, I'm a bit clueless there. Anyway the problem seems 'fixed'. 
I'm just not sure what the problem is...

&gt; Well, I have looked at the trace, and the interesting thing is that the MSS
&gt; for your SMTP connection is 1460, but the MTU for one of your links is 500.
&gt; Do you have a PPP connection to Big Pong? Have you set an MTU of 500?

Okay, I must have made a typo on the MTU of 500. It's been set at 540 for 
years, but I was playing with it today and must have left it at 500. MDK7.2 
didn't seem to worry about that for some reason.

With mdk8.0 and rh7.1 (on the main box), I played with various numbers (on 
the gateway). A 540 figure like normally used was still not working. I've 
pulled it out and it's defaulting to something like 1508 and now everything 
appears to be working - ie pages like www.bigpond.com load quickly and 
correctly. 

Anyway, it appears to be working. Thanks very much for that. Seems I need 
thing set a little differently on the gateway to handle the 2.4 systems.

BTW, not real happy with crappy bigpond, but it's hard to get an ISP I can 
afford in the rural area I'm in. The last was costing me about $70/month just 
for mail. 

thanks,

tim
