&gt; Reasonably often (not always), tape operations cause the following messages:
&gt; 
&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: ncr53c895-0: SCSI parity error detected: SCR1=65 DBC=50000000 STAT1=f

This is the original fault.  Parity on SCSI is done with a seperate signal,
so something is genuinely broken.

The only sane thing for the software to do is to print out as
much info as possible and to reset the SCSI bus.  This happens
here:

&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: ncr53c895-0:4: ERROR (81:0) (8-0-0) (28/77) @ (mem fa3ee1b8:ffffffff).

&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: ncr53c895-0: have to clear fifos.
&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: ncr53c895-0: restart (scsi reset).
&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: ncr53c895-0: Downloading SCSI SCRIPTS.
&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: ncr53c895-0-&lt;4,*&gt;: FAST-5 SCSI 4.0 MB/s (250 ns, offset 8)

Now the tape drive is half way through a tape and has got a
bus reset.  So it complains about that:

&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: st0: Error with sense data: [valid=0] Info fld=0x0, Current st09:00: sense key Unit Attention
&gt; Apr 30 09:47:31 barton kernel: Additional sense indicates Power on, reset, or bus device reset occurred

&gt; Is anyone aware of any settings/configurations which may be
&gt; causing this, or a way to fix it ?

Bus width, length and termination.  The Adaptec site
or the SCSI FAQ has a good description of all of these.

Your controller is Fast Wide SCSI2 at 40Mbps (Ultra SCSI2),
so the rules are:

 - the terminators must be Active Terminators not
   Passive (or standard) Terminators.

 - the total bus length must be under 150cm, this
   includes cabling within the boxes.

 - units should be spaced 30cm or more apart

 - use real SCSI cables (not Centronics printer cables)
   of one type (ribbon or cable).  No ribbon cable outside
   the chassis.

 - devices that are not fast wide need to come at the end
   of the bus.

Now it looks to me that you want to set up the following

  Disk1 --- Disk0 --- Controller === Tape

where --- is ribbon cable inside the chassis and
=== is SCSI cable outside the chassis.  To do this
you must:
 - disable the termination on the Controller (on by default)
 - disable the termination on Disk0 (off by default)
 - enable the termination on Disk1 (off by default)
 - enable the termination on Tape (off by Default)

If there is no "enable termination" jumper on the disk
or tape, then you must put an Active Terminator in the
empty SCSI connector.

In short, you are trying to establish a bus with
Active Terminators at both ends only:

  AT - Disk1 --- Disk0 --- Controller === Tape = AT

whereas most controllers come pre-configured for

  Disk0 with inbuilt AT --- Controller with inbuilt AT

so you need to re-jig the termination to suit.

It would be very useful is you could post some diagrams
of your SCSI bus.  For example:

&gt; PHYSICAL:
&gt;    Disk1 with inbuild AT ---15cm--- Disk0 ---15cm---&gt;&gt;
&gt;    &lt;&lt;--- Controller (AT disabled) ===80cm=== Tape === External AT
&gt; 
&gt; PROTOCOL:
&gt;   ID   Media          Protocol      Device
&gt;    0   Disk0        Fast wide 40   /dev/sd0
&gt;    1   Disk1        Fast wide 40   /dev/sdb
&gt;    6   Tape         Fast wide 40   /dev/st0
&gt;    7   Controller   Fast wide 40   ncr53c895-0

&gt; I've had the same problem with two different tape drives on
&gt; two different Proliants with two different cards.

So it's probably a misunderstanding of the SCSI requirements
then.  They *are* complex and you are much better off simply
putting only devices of the same type on the bus.

&gt; We've tried the 'official' channels, but run up against
&gt; the old finger-point scenario ("Run the diagnostics.
&gt; If they run OK, it's not our problem.")

Basically this is the job for the "systems integrator"
to sort out.  If you are doing that task yourself then
get used to the finger pointing.  Most suppliers can
barely afford to sell you the device, and if there's
not much margin in the sale then they can't give you
much help.
