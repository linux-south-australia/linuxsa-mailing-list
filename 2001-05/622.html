&gt; I do not understand why you can not load this file, I have loaded a 700Mb
&gt; data file in psql which was dumped using pg_dump.

Heyas all,

I've had a few people asking why it wouldn't load up, because they've loaded
big files before. I did work the problem out and you are right, it isn't a
filesize problem. The problem was to do with the way that pg_dump escapes
quotes that were in the database. It wasn't escaping them correctly. When I
used `pg_dump -d` it was giving things like:

INSERT INTO tablename VALUES (1,'test','test,'\'''te\'' st');

Which, if you can see the third 'test' which should be '\'te\' st' isn't.
When it is viewed in the end UI it _should_ be viewed like:

'te' st

Anyways, I loaded the sql dump into vi, ran:

:%s/\\''/\\'/g

And it fixed it, and I was able to load the entire file in one lot back into
the database using psql. Out of 970 odd entries in the database, about 940
of them had the problem, hence why it wouldn't load them in!

Anyway, I have the data back in the database, and it is much more organised
and I know to look out for this problem in the future!
