&gt; But I havent seen cheap fixed IP, unlimited host server allowed adsl
&gt; in .au yet.

depends what you mean by cheap...

I have one fixed IP, unlimited host etc (in fact, I don't think I have any
real AUP restrictions, apart from don't DoS, don't spam, don't do anything
illegal, don't use unapproved ADSL gear, and don't hold ISP liable) ADSL
right now. 256/64kbps, with 500Mb included, and no minimum contract length,
all for:

$129 setup
$89/month
$0.18/excess MB

+ cost of ADSL modem ($595 for Alcatel Ethernet Bridge -- you can now get a
DLink one for $495... damn!)

connected to my modem, I have a switch and two computers (one firewall, one
desktop), and plan to add a few more over time. I host a domain from home
over this, presently running bind, sendmail, apache and sshd, and have no
restrictions (AFAIK). I can even serve up as much data as I want, without
incurring a penalty (though at 64k, it's not going to be a lot of data ;) )

Just FYI.

(
	this compares to Telstra at $825 setup, $249/month, _plus_ usage at
$0.176/MB... and even then, you still need to buy an access device, and the
only one they support is the Cisco for $1537.80 (yes! save 20c -- our
margins are _that_ _low_) _plus_ $660 setup fee (Am I to assume that it
takes a highly skilled person at $220/hr (very highly skilled, I hope) 3
hours to set it up? perhaps someone just reasonably cluey, at $55/hour would
take 12 hours of hard labour... maybe this includes the cost of CCIE
certification...) _and_ an additional monthly fee for "maintenance" of the
router, for $66/month (BH) or $132/month (24x7)...  of course, there's
generous discounts available...

Even then, Telstra don't let you do whatever you want -- you must be
single-homed if you want their proxy rates, you can't serve more than 2.25
times what you download, and so on...
)

I suspect now would be a good time for my ISP to advertise this
comparitively... make people out there aware of the differences in cost and
service here...
