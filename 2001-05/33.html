&gt; hi
&gt; 1)Is it possible to use win98 to dial to isp, but using linux as
&gt; firewall &
&gt; server for file sharing?
&gt; 2)Can the linux box access the net too (simultaneously)?

Assuming you have 2 PCs, then I think what you mean is possible... what you
say is potentially possible, but not sensible :)

What I think you want is this:

Phone line
   |
 Linux Firewall/NAT fileserver box with modem
   |
 Windows client


What happens is the Linux box dials the internet, gets the dynamic IP
address, and performs NAT for your network... It also acts as a firewall,
and a fileserver. Conventional wisdom says that you don't mix things like
firewalls and fileservers on the one machine, but,like many home users, you
have to make do with what you've got. Your windows client sits behind the
firewall, with a static IP address like 192.168.1.1, and talks to the linux
box as its' gateway to the internet.

Of course, seeing as what is actually happening here is the Linux box is
accessing the net on behalf of the windows box, the linux box will be able
to access the internet for itself...

So, what I think you mean is:
&gt; 1)Is it possible to use linux to dial to isp, as
&gt; firewall &
&gt; server for file sharing, with win98 as a client?
&gt; 2)Can the linux box access the net too (simultaneously)?


and the answers are yes and yes....

I suppose technically, there's no reason why you can't make windows the
dialup box, as long as the right software to allow internet sharing with
linux is available for windows, but you'll find that unless your network is
more complex than the above, your firewall will not be protecting anything
but itself... for a firewall to work, it needs to sit _between_ the
untrusted network (internet) and the trusted network (your computers)...
hence, the reason you don't normally put a fileserver on the same machine as
the firewall -- it means that the fileserver is only protected by one layer
(software) rather than having a whole machine to get through... (I didn't
explain that well, but it's late... :)
