Thats a pretty wide spread virus. We get several hits from that virus
per day. Blocking that host will not help you as its spoofed.

I stop the virus by using amavis with mcaffee under linux.

<A HREF="http://www.amavis.org">http://www.amavis.org</A>
<A HREF="http://www.nai.com/naicommon/buy-try/try/products-evals.asp">http://www.nai.com/naicommon/buy-try/try/products-evals.asp</A>

Anyway that name & IP address are both wrong and thus blocking them wont
help you at all. The name sexyfun.net is spoofed, and I just looked at
the page. Someone has bought it since the virus and put info about the
virus on it in the hope you'll look at it and they can help you remove
it. You can look at the email header and you should get at least an IP
of the host it came from. If its a company you can inform them, and if
its a home user you can send the email to their support team with an
email along the lines of "one of your users has blah blah virus. They
were connected to IP xx.xx.xx.xx at xx:xx:xx time in time zone +9:30"

Heres an example of a real header of one of these viruses.

You can see the ip adress and name in the received line
(ip149.nashville17.tn.pub-ip.psi.net [38.33.15.149]) and you can see its
a user of an ISP (psi.net) so they are the ones to harass about it. You
can also see the from line is bullsh_t.

&gt; 
&gt; I am currently having a problem configuring my postfix server. staff are
&gt; receiving emails from a host called sexyfun.net with an ip address

&gt; this host from coming us. The version of linux is slackware 2.2.16.
