&gt;&gt;       For a gamer 1 hour of online gaming with any of the Id games will
result
&gt;&gt; in approximately 10-15 mb of data most gamers will average 2-3 hours a day
&gt;&gt; 4 days a week, hardcore gamers 8/7 will clearly need around 400mb a week
&gt;&gt; for gaming allowing for other baggage such as surfing and downloads. It
&gt;&gt; becomes obvious you can easily get up to 2gb in a month, IMO this is
&gt;&gt; reasonable. The oocasional single gb download session like isos etc should
&gt;&gt; also be tolerated but not on a daily basis.
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to know who's paying for this traffic if it isn't you. I don't
&gt;recall you paying circa $368/month for Cable, or wanting to. [2GB * 0.18
&gt;= 368.64]
Ok agreed, but by the same token 1.5gb is 276 etc. Who pays that? and for
most capped accounts @ 650mb its 117. The providers seem happy to offer
this for 24.95.

I personally do not go anywhere near this, and I am probably paying for
some via my unused time etc. 

&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Price (Internode (good that they are) are more expensive because of
&gt;&gt; their costs from Telstra). The additional value that they offer is
&gt;&gt; attractive to a lot of people but it is not for 'normal consumers'
&gt;
&gt;I'd disagree with that. Internode have a reputation for providing an
&gt;excellent level of service 99.9% of the time. I can't rememmber when one
&gt;of my Internode-connected clients had a problem.

We have used Inode at work for our ISDN link and they were great. We
changed to OPTUS for consoldation purposes but I am pleased Simon actually
listens to feedback if all thing's were equal I wouldnt hesitate to go with
internode.

&gt;Secondly, it *is* better for normal consumers. Firstly, it's Direct IP
&gt;over DSL. Essentially easier to setup.
I guess there are degrees of normal consumers. The issue about using direct
ip or ppoe is of no consequence for the non technical home user. Setup is
something they expect by putting in a disk and running setup.

&gt;Then, you've got the fact that you are allowed to run other clients
&gt;behind your firewall.
A very positive note of course, but are they just accepting what will
happen so may aswell condone it? 

&gt;Then, you've got a company who knows what they're doing. Telstra aren't
&gt;exactly the sharpest knife in the Telco drawer, as demonstrated by their
&gt;rollout of ADSL.

Without doubt!

&gt;&gt; 2. You can run NAT etc with other ISP's (just don't tell them)
&gt;
&gt;Indeed you could. It's a breach of contract, though. I don't know what
&gt;the consequences would be (if any).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; 3. Servers are another issue tho, most common ones are smtp/ftp/http. All
&gt;&gt; of these are exposed via well known ports and subsequently detectable, but
&gt;&gt; do you really want to run such services as a home user? I can only think of
&gt;&gt; a need for smtp personally. I don't think game servers are realistic as the
&gt;&gt; upload speeds to the clients are not sufficient given the rate capping
&gt;&gt; imposed now on most 512/256 style connections you can't run a game server
&gt;&gt; for more than 2-3 people anyway and who wants to play on those servers.

&gt;As a home user, no. As a person who is a 'hardcore gamer' you may be
&gt;interested in getting the most from your always-on link. SMTP/WWW may
&gt;not be such a silly suggestion. 

I assure you all other IP based services are shutdown so as not to detracet
from the gaming experience. The need for ping!

&gt;&gt; Costs are comparative. Except cable offers twice the rate that Adsl does
&gt;&gt; for the same dollars. But I know I would be happy with 256/64 ADSl or
&gt;&gt; 512/128 cable.
&gt;
&gt;Rememmber, you get what you pay for. TANSTAAFL.
&gt;

hmm ok, that is what I am trying to ascertain I guess.


&gt;&gt; Most people have phone lines, and an increasing number are getting paytv. 
&gt;&gt; The biggest leaning towards cable is the single feed into the house, which
&gt;&gt; means I can get paytv (groan nickelodean 24/7).
&gt;
&gt;Satellite is better, IMHO.
Why is that?

&gt;&gt; This problem will exist with ADSL as well I think ultimately the capacity
&gt;&gt; of the network will be pushed with either. Underconfigured infrastructure,
&gt;&gt; bad interconnects etc will cause this!
&gt;
&gt;Well, maybe. Internode have invested a heck of a lot of money into ADSL
&gt;just to get it off the ground. To loose customers and have their product
&gt;branded as 'second-rate broadband' wouldn't be a good business decision.
&gt;Internode have a proven record of not deciding that 'that network
&gt;upgrade can wait'.

&gt;I feel that this problem won't exist. Serious ISPs have monitoring
&gt;systems that let them know when their links reach capacity.


In internodes case I suspect you're correct. Undersubsribed or
overconfigured is better than the reverse. Internode have always been
careful to stay within their capacity and provide a good service for every
customer.

&gt;&gt; From the people I know in the east (yes gamers in the main) ALL the new BP
&gt;&gt; cable clients are on DOCSIS modems and they are happy. Other older BP
&gt;&gt; customers who have been using it for a good deal longer have even gone to
&gt;&gt; lengths of frying their old cable modems and calling up BP and saying 'the
&gt;&gt; internet is broken' out comes tech with new DOCSIS modem and they are
happy.
&gt;
&gt;I think you're still missing the point. It's been only a matter of days
&gt;since most people have had Cable installed. How you can come to a
&gt;conclusion based on fact from that, I don't know.

No it's been a matter of years in the east and as I mentioned the anecdotal
experience of a number of users of cable (in the east) has been taking on a
positive tone of late due to the DOCSIS implementations.  Mind you the TIO
intervention and non payment of accounts I suspect may have woken the
sleeping giant.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Apparently fox are offering paytv+cable deals aswell whch I may follow
up on.
&gt;
&gt;At one stage I think they were offereing Internet with Satellite TV. I
&gt;can't rememmber what happened to that offer, though.
&gt;
I can't find anything either. Do you suspect it was this which prompted
Telstra to introduce the service?

Evan

PS: Has there been any comparisons between the two products contrasting the
merits of each both technologically and usability?
