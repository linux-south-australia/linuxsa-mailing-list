Hi everyone,

We have two SCSI backup drives which we would like to use in two different
applications, one a Travan 10GB uncompressed, 20GB compressed backup drive,
and a Segate DAT 20GB Uncompressed, 40GB compressed.

When we installed the travan in the server we tried using the Taper backup
utility, and it says it doesn't support drives larger than 4GB. Has anyone
had any experience here ?

I haven't tried the DAT yet, but I thought I would ask for a general opinion
from people on the list which software they use to manage dailey incremental
backups, and weekly full backups either with DAT or Travan.

On either of the two computers requiring the tapes do not run any X servers
on them so all the X applications are out of the question.

I was hoping there is a GPL application similar to taper which supports
these size tapes. I was hoping that I wasn't gonna have to use Tar, and Cron
to manage the backups, I would like an application which is partially user
friendly as there will be a few people responsible for the backups.


Regards,
Jeremy
