Hi Alan,

&gt;It'll be a real hassle reading out your IPv6 address to people
&gt;over the phone though.

Not likely, IPv6 will require the use of dynamic DNS systems and only the
geekiest will ever need to memorise an address.

&gt;In fact, it looks like I've got my own subnets:
&gt;
&gt;fe80::200:21ff:fed4:4e25/10
&gt;fe80::21d4:4e25/10
&gt;
&gt;which bear a curious similarity to the ethernet address.
&gt;Already I get 2 nets of 2^118 nodes each.

Funny that :) By mapping an IPv6 address to your network card, there's a
certain amount of uniqueness ensured, as well as a mechanism for global
reachability.

&gt;By the way, I once worked out that there are 1000 IPv6 addresses
&gt;for every electron in every human being on earth.
&gt;That's probably down to about 950 by now, unless a lot of people
&gt;have lost a lot of weight recently.

There are currently enough IP addresses such that 2/3 people on earth can
have their own. The current problems arise from inefficiencies of routing
and subnet allocations rather than a lack of volume. IPv6 attempts to
address this with more than just sheer size.

&gt;Adn that raises a further question about where you go
&gt;to get your IPv6 allocation.
&gt;I think I'd like to start with a /108 subnet of about 1 million
&gt;addresses - to allow for future expansion.
&gt;
&gt;This is going to make those Internode allocations of IPv4 /30
&gt;subnets look distinctly stingy!

On the contrary, a fixed block of IP address space is going to look generous
by comparison.

The IPv6 future will see us all using dynamically allocated address space,
with only the bigger ISP's having their own allocation. Dynamic DNS and
better routing technologies need to become commonplace before this can
occur. DNS might be a bit misleading, it'll more likely be some sort of
registry host that all of your toasters log on to.

&gt;Does anyone just happen to knwo how you get connected
&gt;to the IPv6 network?

To answer the original question, have a read of:

<A HREF="http://www.6bone.net/6bone_hookup.html">http://www.6bone.net/6bone_hookup.html</A>

To summarise, you setup a tunnel to an existing 6bone network (including
Cisco and Microsoft..) and receive your IPv6 fix over the IPv4 Internet.

Don't forget to upgrade to a DNS that supports AAAA records, although given
your bind 9.1 troubles you've obviously done this :)
