Hi all...

I have a strange and possibly disturbing story to tell y'all... It happened
the other night... I was just heading to bed &lt;blah blah blah&gt; and my
computer powered itself up. I had not touched it, was not within two metres
of it, did not see any evidence of a change in the voltage on the lines that
could have caused an over-zealous ATX power supply to power itself up (my
ADSL modem is on the same powerboard, and it didn't reboot (it has a long
reboot cycle, so I would have see this), and my (incandescent) light was on
and I saw no flicker)...

I've also noticed that occasionally, my machine powers itself up during the
day...

some info on my machine:

I have a new LAN card. It has a WoL (Wake on LAN) facility. I have not done
anything to enable this though. I also have a WoL facility on my
motherboard. Again, I have not done anything to enable this. In fact, I
wasn't even aware that I had this until I checked just now.

My network card is connected through a switch to my Alcatel ADSL/Ethernet
modem. My modem and switch were powered on during the night, and the switch
showed a link to both the modem and the computer, so evidently my LAN card
was powered up even though my machine wasn't. My modem was connected to my
ISP (it connects when it's powered up -- the magic of ADSL), and I have a
static IP. Is it possible that some dork sent a WoL packet to my IP address,
and hence, powered up my PC remotely?

If so, it's true that the only safe machine is an unplugged one... :)
