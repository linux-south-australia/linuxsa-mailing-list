&gt; I dontknow where you get your $250 proice form,. but it does nto apper to
&gt; be overly competitve.

The fact there are lower prices out there goes to prove what I'm saying.

&gt; Say 3 hours at $20 per hour just tryignto find out the info you need,
&gt; and that the client should have if they had there doamin reistedered by
&gt; a reasonably reputable IPS or registry, theres half your $110 annual
&gt; fee already.

And what about customers like me where all this work isn't involved? Why
am I still paying the higher price? For the same reason I pay the higher
price of a flat rate account even though I mainly only get email.

I covered this earlier when I said the price charged to customers has
almost nothing to do with the real cost of running an ISP.

&gt; The machine that runs the nameserver also has to be maintained.

This is all stuff that has to be done anyway to provide the basic
services.

&gt; Your opinon woul have a little more validity if you had shopped around
&gt; a bit and quoted the lower prices.

Thank you for the unwarranted attack on my credibility. I used to run
an ISP so I think I've already done enough research, thanks.
