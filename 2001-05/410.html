&gt;       For a gamer 1 hour of online gaming with any of the Id games will result
&gt; in approximately 10-15 mb of data most gamers will average 2-3 hours a day
&gt; 4 days a week, hardcore gamers 8/7 will clearly need around 400mb a week
&gt; for gaming allowing for other baggage such as surfing and downloads. It
&gt; becomes obvious you can easily get up to 2gb in a month, IMO this is
&gt; reasonable. The oocasional single gb download session like isos etc should
&gt; also be tolerated but not on a daily basis.

I'd like to know who's paying for this traffic if it isn't you. I don't
recall you paying circa $368/month for Cable, or wanting to. [2GB * 0.18
= 368.64]

&gt; 1. Price (Internode (good that they are) are more expensive because of
&gt; their costs from Telstra). The additional value that they offer is
&gt; attractive to a lot of people but it is not for 'normal consumers'

I'd disagree with that. Internode have a reputation for providing an
excellent level of service 99.9% of the time. I can't rememmber when one
of my Internode-connected clients had a problem.

Secondly, it *is* better for normal consumers. Firstly, it's Direct IP
over DSL. Essentially easier to setup.
Then, you've got the fact that you are allowed to run other clients
behind your firewall.

Then, you've got a company who knows what they're doing. Telstra aren't
exactly the sharpest knife in the Telco drawer, as demonstrated by their
rollout of ADSL.

&gt; 2. You can run NAT etc with other ISP's (just don't tell them)

Indeed you could. It's a breach of contract, though. I don't know what
the consequences would be (if any).

&gt; 3. Servers are another issue tho, most common ones are smtp/ftp/http. All
&gt; of these are exposed via well known ports and subsequently detectable, but
&gt; do you really want to run such services as a home user? I can only think of
&gt; a need for smtp personally. I don't think game servers are realistic as the
&gt; upload speeds to the clients are not sufficient given the rate capping
&gt; imposed now on most 512/256 style connections you can't run a game server
&gt; for more than 2-3 people anyway and who wants to play on those servers.

As a home user, no. As a person who is a 'hardcore gamer' you may be
interested in getting the most from your always-on link. SMTP/WWW may
not be such a silly suggestion.

&gt; Costs are comparative. Except cable offers twice the rate that Adsl does
&gt; for the same dollars. But I know I would be happy with 256/64 ADSl or
&gt; 512/128 cable.

Rememmber, you get what you pay for. TANSTAAFL.

&gt; Most people have phone lines, and an increasing number are getting paytv. 
&gt; The biggest leaning towards cable is the single feed into the house, which
&gt; means I can get paytv (groan nickelodean 24/7).

Satellite is better, IMHO.

&gt; This problem will exist with ADSL as well I think ultimately the capacity
&gt; of the network will be pushed with either. Underconfigured infrastructure,
&gt; bad interconnects etc will cause this!

Well, maybe. Internode have invested a heck of a lot of money into ADSL
just to get it off the ground. To loose customers and have their product
branded as 'second-rate broadband' wouldn't be a good business decision.
Internode have a proven record of not deciding that 'that network
upgrade can wait'.

I feel that this problem won't exist. Serious ISPs have monitoring
systems that let them know when their links reach capacity.

&gt; From the people I know in the east (yes gamers in the main) ALL the new BP
&gt; cable clients are on DOCSIS modems and they are happy. Other older BP
&gt; customers who have been using it for a good deal longer have even gone to
&gt; lengths of frying their old cable modems and calling up BP and saying 'the
&gt; internet is broken' out comes tech with new DOCSIS modem and they are happy.

I think you're still missing the point. It's been only a matter of days
since most people have had Cable installed. How you can come to a
conclusion based on fact from that, I don't know.

&gt; Apparently fox are offering paytv+cable deals aswell whch I may follow up on.

At one stage I think they were offereing Internet with Satellite TV. I
can't rememmber what happened to that offer, though.
