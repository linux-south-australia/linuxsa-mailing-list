&gt; Hi all...

&gt; I have a strange and possibly disturbing story to tell y'all... It happened
&gt; the other night... I was just heading to bed &lt;blah blah blah&gt; and my
&gt; computer powered itself up. I had not touched it, was not within two metres
&gt; of it, did not see any evidence of a change in the voltage on the lines
&gt; that could have caused an over-zealous ATX power supply to power itself up
&gt; (my ADSL modem is on the same powerboard, and it didn't reboot (it has a
&gt; long reboot cycle, so I would have see this), and my (incandescent) light
&gt; was on and I saw no flicker)...
&gt;
&gt; I've also noticed that occasionally, my machine powers itself up during the
&gt; day...

G'day all - (first post to this list)

I found the above to be most interesting, as a friend of mine and my 
sister-in-law had similar problems.
Firstly (my friend), has a pc (win98) less than 6 months old connected by 
dial-up to the net.  About a week ago, all during the evening the box would 
switch on approximately 8-10 minutes after it was correctly shut down and 
then go through the incorrectly shut-down win98 start-up cycle.  Only way he 
could stop it was to switch it off at the power point.
I had a look at it the next day, and after running for about 30 minutes and 
then shut down it would do the same.  Being under warantee, he took it back 
to the suppliers who (suprise, suprise) couldn't find anything wrong.  It has 
been doing the same on a spasmodic basis ever since, whether connected to the 
net or not.
Secondly (my sister-in-law), has a similar set-up to the above, but has one 
of those 'surge-suppressors' in the power to the pc.  After turning on her 
printer the pc shut down and then proceeded to start-up on a similar basis to 
the above.  This went on for 3/4 day but has not happened since.
Could all of this be caused by low voltage from the supply authorities 
affecting the computer power supplies etc.?  In the above cases it had 
nothing to do with being connected to the net.
