I'd be willing to point from my DNS' for a small fee.  No big deal.  The
bandwidth required is next to nothing and the load is no big deal.

I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; misunderstanding the scope of the effort to make the initial DNS entry
&gt; &gt; &gt; (mmm...) and then cope with a volume of subsequent queries?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What you are paying for is infrastructure, bandwidth costs, wages,
admins,
&gt; &gt; this, that and the other. Sure disk space is cheap, but bandwidth is
not!
&gt;
&gt; Nah, the DNS pricing is definitely a gouge. It's an identifiable service
&gt; that can be a separate item on a bill. If it didn't have the special name
&gt; "DNS", you'd be paying $1 a year for bandwidth/load.
&gt;
&gt; All the links, redundancy, administrators, and other things that make
&gt; running an ISP an expensive endeavour are already required to support
&gt; the base services - dialups, bandwidth, and connectivity.
&gt;
&gt; The true cost of running an ISP is a very complicated calculation.
&gt;
&gt; Calling up on a dialin line on a Sunday night costs more for the ISP than
&gt; calling on a Monday afternoon. To cater for peak times, more lines have
&gt; to be installed than are needed at other times.
&gt;
&gt; Getting data locally is cheaper than getting it from overseas, unless
&gt; it's over satellite or it's cached or it's from Telstra, or or or. So
&gt; many factors are involved in calculating the true cost, it pretty much
&gt; changes by the minute.
&gt;
&gt; The bill that the ISP sends out to the customer is almost a fabrication.
&gt; Very little of the real costs the customer has run up translates directly
&gt; to the charges being imposed on the customer.
&gt;
&gt; Charging more money for 16 IP addresses than 4 IP addresses has no
&gt; technical basis in reality. It's just something extra that can be put on
&gt; the bill. If the user has more computers, they're gonna NAT anyway.
&gt;
&gt; Want a static IP? It's just a quick entry in a text file. Want some DNS?
&gt; Copy and touch up a couple of small files. Want a block routed to you?
&gt; Make a change in the user profile. It's all trivial, and in no way does
&gt; it translate to the $150 and $200 and $250's on the final bill.
&gt;
&gt; Customers don't ask for these things often, but it's important when they
&gt; do - so every ISP out there feasts on these kinds of requests.
