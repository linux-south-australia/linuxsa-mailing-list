&gt; Question 1:
&gt; It sounds like this means that a UPS is now of doubtful value,
&gt; if one is using a UPS for the sole reason of preventing
&gt; crash-time damage to file systems.
&gt; Is that right?
&gt; If that's true, I may have just wasted A$1350.

Pffft! A UPS does more than just protect the filesystem. What about
hardware protection? The UPS provides a level of power filtering. I'd
not ever trust a machine of value on the cruddy mains power. UPSs are
still _incredibly_ valuable.

&gt; Question 2:
&gt; Is XFS usable as the /boot file system?
&gt; I found with ReiserFS on SuSE 7.1 that I couldn't really
&gt; use ReiserFS for /boot. Maybe that was because the minimum
&gt; size for a ReiserFS partition was 30 MB, or maybe there was
&gt; some other reason. But then again, one doesn't write
&gt; much to /boot anyway. So it doesn't matter...

If this screenshot of the system installer from SGI is anything to go
by, I'd say so.

&gt; Back to question 1:
&gt; My real point I'm getting at is:  how good a guarantee
&gt; is there that you can turn off the power switch and
&gt; hope to get your system going again?

There isn't one. Nothing is guaranteed. It's just more likely that your
system is going to recover without too many problems, and a lot faster
that fsck.

&gt; I did this once with my Reiser file system, and trashed my
&gt; /etc/rc.config file, which was currently being edited.

Like I said, there's no guarantees. Most editors that I know don't write
to the file as you type -- they save it in memory. If you use vi,
normally it creates a .filename.swp file. Restore it from there.

&gt; I.e. sometimes a file system may recover without fsck etc.,
&gt; but it might not be the file system you want!
&gt; As a file system, it might be structurally correct, but it
&gt; might be unbootable due to the files having the wrong contents.
&gt; 
&gt; I bet this info is in some FAQ somewhere, but life is short,
&gt; and FAQs are long.

Netscape has a Find function, as do most browsers. (A-f).
