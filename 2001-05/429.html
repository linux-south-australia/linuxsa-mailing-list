Hey all,

At work we currently have about 20 PC's dual booting win98/linux (rh 7.1),
and 5 mac's running OS8.6.  What I need is some sort of method to allow
ANYONE to login to any of those, and have several drives mapped.  The
drives would be on a server running NT4, and several linux servers with
kernels 2.4.2 and 2.2.14.

I am in favor of samba in this situation since we are catering to the
windows users for the most part.  The macs can use appletalk.

The main problem is authentication; what is the most graceful method for
authenticating users from a mac, linux or windows workstation?  The NT4
box is currently the PDC as well.  In the future we are going to be
providing FTP access to users as well.

All user management will be dome through a web interface.  I figured that
if I used samba for authentication it would simplify things.  A user
changes their password via the web interface, smbpasswd is called to
change their samba password, and their password would be changed in the
glftpd user file (or proftpd).

I do NOT want to install NIS/NFS on anything here.  Money is somewhat of
an issue, as well as my time.

Any suggestions?

thanks,
.cfg
