&gt; Right tool for the job,

Exactly.  And from where I sit I see unis rollout huge
server farms to run Exchange, or three servers to
run LDAP/sendmail/Cryus and 50,000 accounts.

I see viruses sweep through the Exchange/Outlook combo
on a monthly basis.  And a vendor who isn't too
concerned about that.

I see a directory system that is designed for small
business and folds before the organisational complexity
of a large enterprise.

I see a vendor who doesn't play nicely with others.
A vendor who sees every non-MS purchase as a betrayal
and thus will do their best to stop you "buying the
right tools for the job" if it is not from them.

Because they don't play nicely, simple administrative
tasks like enrolling a new year of students into the
diretory has to be done manually rather than exported
from an administration system, munged about, and imported.

Because they don't play nicely, links to other systems
like PeopleSoft and SAP come as high-priced add-ons
rather than as part of the base product.

I see a vendor with contempt for standards.  Standards
are a compact between applications about the protocol
they use to comminucate.  So I see Microsoft products
communicating well within a walled garden, but miserably
outside of that.

And I see a vendor with the arrogance to assume that
you do not need any software beyond that walled garden.

I see a vendor that won't let you buy the "right tool
for the job" if that tool is SPARC or Alpha based or
ARM based.
