Hi grant,

I have seen slightly similar things happen as well.

1. I am no ssh guru but on establisihing a session there is a minor lag in
key establishment but I wouldnt expect it to be noticeable.

2. Have you run tcpdump from a terminal window and just looked at how the
traffic was flowing? Was there noticeable lag between packets going from
one box to the celeron?

Depending of course on the volume of traffic you may need to filter things
so you can see it. 
Is the network switched? if so you may be ok in terms of noise traffic. 

you may want to monitor each nic to see if one is interfering with the
other. (I have seen other devices sharing the same IRQ which resulted in
similar behaviour as they each took their turn.) You may want to check the
configs on the cards.

Regards

Evan



&gt;I have a celeron 566, 256 MB SDRAM (2 x 128 Kingmax), 20.5 GB IBM hard
&gt;drive, two realtek NIC's. This is over a 100 Mbps LAN.
&gt;
&gt;This isn't very specific, but I have two issues:
&gt;
&gt;1. When I ssh to the box, it waits for roughly 2 seconds before prompting
&gt;for login, where as another box I have it's instant. Is this a problem
&gt;with the NIC, continue to issue 2 :)
&gt;
&gt;2. Sometimes when I am typing in the ssh and also in the terminal, the
&gt;machine will "hang" for up to 5-10 seconds, and then burst all the typed
&gt;data.
&gt;
&gt;I have no idea where to start and this is a weird problem, but what could
&gt;it be... I know it could be many things but I'm hoping someone has seen
&gt;something similiar to this before, so I don't go testing every piece of
&gt;hard ware piece by piece, especially since this is a production machine.
&gt;
&gt;I know this is vague. Thanks :)
