&gt; Do these times look like they are around the same time as your dial-up
&gt; link goes up or down? Perhaps sticking a 'killall -HUP named' in your
&gt; dial-up script might help.

Yup. The dodgy Cisco 33k/56k permanent modem link software at the
Bigpond end goes into a retraining live-lock every couple of days,
and if the link is dropped as a result etc., BIND stops listening
on the PPP link.

The trouble is that BIND didn't drop the PPP link IP address binding
between May 11 and May 29, but it has been working (apparently) fine
during all of that time until the last couple of hours.

An odd thing is that every time this happens, it tends to be
the .au addresses which fail to resolve. But my machine isn't
even in the .au domain.



As an aside, the Cisco retraining bug has been a very substantial
nuisance to me for the last 2.5 years. But Bigpond don't
think it's worth looking at because no one else has reported
the same problem. And when they hear that I'm using linux,
they attribute the problem to linux and say that they can't
help me with that.
But on 11 May 2001, my Bigpond link dropped out 5 times, for a total
of 4.3 hours. 
(See <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/topohist.html">http://www.topology.org/topohist.html</A> .)
I phoned up and was told that someone else had the same
symptoms. So they were working to fix it!
So problems only get fixed if &gt;= 2 people have the same symptoms.
It's a curious support model. But they _are_ cheaper!

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
