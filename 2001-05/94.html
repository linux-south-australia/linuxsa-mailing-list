&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; My company is looking at some Linux solutions for some issues we have
&gt; with our current network.  Take for example, the fact that our major
&gt; company-wide enterprise management package is a Unix based program that
&gt; had been ported to NT...  It's a dog :-)
&gt; 
&gt; We're going to move that over to RH Linux, of which I'm pleased - it
&gt; should run like a charm now.
&gt; 
&gt; We're also looking to Linux to replace a few other services -- email,
&gt; internet, etc.  Eventually even the whole lot perhaps.  I don't know.

NT on Internet-facing servers is like a red flag to a bull. You're
asking for trouble. UNIX on the Internet facing servers is the way to
go.

&gt; As for e-mail, I keep hearing the words "Exchange" muttered around the
&gt; place.  Well to implement that system we'd have to dedicate an array of
&gt; super computers just to stop it from using all the system resources.

While I don't like Exchange in the slightest, it's not really that
resource hungry. You could easilly pickup a box (Say, Athlon 900, 256M
RAM) that would do the job for &lt; $1600. Exchange isn't on my list of
favourite applications, but sometimes it may be the only solution.

&gt; But anyway, I pursued the Exchange-type solutions around, and was
&gt; referred to HP OpenMail which provided very similar functions.  This
&gt; product is no longer supported by HP, and they will be no longer
&gt; releasing new versions, and only providing bugfixes for the next 5
&gt; years.

Yeah, that kinda sucks. OpenMail looked fairly cool.

&gt; This basically throws that solution out of the Window in management
&gt; eyes.  The remaining option is Exchange unless another solution can be
&gt; found.  Really what they want is to be able to use Outlook for email,
&gt; calendaring, scheduling, contacting 'n all that stuff Exchange and
&gt; OpenMail do.

Hrmm.. Don't know about group-calendaring. Exchange is kind of good out
that. They use it at work. You install an MTA on the firewall and use
Mailertables to forward it to the internal Exchange box.

&gt; What are your suggestions for Linux based solutions?  Otherwise it'll be
&gt; Exchange.

IMAP + LDAP any good? I'm sure that you can whip something up. The
calendaring is the only thing that I think you might have trouble with,
especially if you want to share the calendars in realtime.
