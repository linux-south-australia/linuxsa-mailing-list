Hi,
Following your story:
<A HREF="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0104/30/bizcom/bizcom5.html">http://www.smh.com.au/news/0104/30/bizcom/bizcom5.html</A>

I thought this would be of interest to you:

On Sunday 29th April, St George Bank "upgraded" their Internet Banking
facility only to work with Netscape 4.74-&gt;4.77 browsers. The only
problem was they gave no notice of this change nor researched if all
their customers were in a position to "upgrade" to NS 4.74, effectively
locking customers out of Internet banking.

St George's Web site claim Netscape has dropped support for anything
less than 4.74, & in a knee-jerk reaction, coded their Internet banking
to not accept 4.61, a common version used extensively by ANZ Bank.

Most people are looking to migrate to the Standards-based NS 6.0 browser
if they are currently running any version of NS 4.x. IBM haven't
bothered with the NS 4.7 strain, instead leveraging the open-source
Mozilla code to release a NS6 code-based browser.

No other Bank has implemented such draconian action as St George has.
ANZ, Commonwealth, Adelaide Bank still accept earlier browsers.

Customers of BankSA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of St George Bank were
also effected.
Formal complaints by its customers have either been ignored or put in
the "forwarded to the appropriate department for consideration..."
