THE ANSWER YOU WANT

I went through this nightmare myself yesterday.  I don't think
TFTP works at all as shipped by Red Hat in 7.0.

I downloaded the 7.1 RPMs and installed them (if you want to
be safe download the SRPMs and rebuild them).  I notice
that there's quite a few changes from 7.0.


A NEAT VARIATION ON THE STANDARD CONFIGURATION

It just worked, and it's now chroot-ed as well which
makes file naming easier.  My 7.1 configuration is
slightly different from as shipped.  I have a directory
/tftpboot with

     user=root
     group=tftp (which I created and put in the people that
       I want to create TFTP files.)
     access=rwxrwsr-x

as this means that people do not need to become root to
maintain the TFTP files, rather you can just do this if
you are a member of the tftp group.  In turn that "tftp"
group can be maintained by LDAP or NIS consistently across
the organisation.

Now put yourself into the "tftp" group, logout and in, and copy
across the files you want people to be able to TFTP GET.  You
can't symlink the files.  chmod them to rw-rw-r--.  To do this
use the command

  (umask 002; cp fred /tftpboot/fred)

To TFTP PUT a file, it must already exist and be globally  readable.
To do this firstly log into the TFTP server and say

  (umask 000; touch /tftpboot/fred)

this can be a one-liner

  ssh tftp0.net.example.edu.au 'umask 0; touch /tftpboot/fred'

and then write the file from the client

  tftp tftp0.net.example.edu.au
  tftp&gt; put fred fred
  tftp&gt; quit


MORE COMPLEX STUFF FOR REAL LIFE

If the client is a Cisco router then the basic command in
recent IOS is

  copy slot0:fred t<A HREF="ftp://tftp0.net.example.edu.au/fred">ftp://tftp0.net.example.edu.au/fred</A>

to backup a configuration before a change say

  copy running-config t<A HREF="ftp://tftp0.net.example.edu.au/backup/router-20010504-1.cfg">ftp://tftp0.net.example.edu.au/backup/router-20010504-1.cfg</A>

See how you can use subdirectories on the TFTP server to reduce clutter.
Subdirectories also allow you to have different groups of users maintaining
files on the TFTP server.

xinetd uses TCP Wrapper to control access.  If you give all
your routers loopback interfaces in the same range, say as host
routes in 130.100.255.0 - 130.100.255.255 as in:

  interface Loopback0
    description router.net.example.edu.au
    ip address 130.100.255.1 255.255.255.255
    no ip directed-broadcast
    no ip mroute-cache
    snmp ifindex persist
  router ospf 32700
    network 130.100.255.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
    passive-interface Loopback0
  ip tftp source-interface Loopback0

with a DNS saying

  $ORIGIN net.example.edu.au.
  router     IN  A      130.100.255.1
             IN  HINFO  "CISCO-2599" "IOS12.0(15)ST-aarnet"
             IN  TXT    "Serial=123223"
  $ORIGIN router.net.example.edu.au.
  loopback0  IN  CNAME  router.net.example.edu.au.
  ethernet0  IN  A      130.100.1.254
             IN  TXT    "OUI=112233445566"
             IN  LOC    34 56 00.000 S 138 36 00.000 E 40.00m 1.00m 10000.00m 10
  ethernet1  IN  A      130.100.2.254
             IN  TXT    "OUI=223344556677"
             IN  LOC    34 56 00.000 S 138 36 00.000 E 40.00m 1.00m 10000.00m 10

so that traceroute, graphical traceroute and ssh work optimally.
Recording the ethernet addresses for everything helps trace ethernet
switching bugs and you need the model, IOS version and serial number
to lodge a fault report with Cisco.

[where 130.100.255.0/24 is the topmost subnet in your address
 space 130.100.0.0/16 (loopback addresses should be at the
 top of your address range).  You should *never* allocate
 130.100.255.255 to anything, as this is the broadcast address
 pounded by idiots who won't use DHCP and who then misconfigure
 the subnet mask.  As this makes 130.100.255.0/24 useless as a
 standard subnet it is a good place to put the loopback addresses.]

You can then say in /etc/hosts.allow

  # Only routers can use TFTP
  in.tftpd: 130.100.255. EXCEPT 130.100.255.0,130.100.255.255

assuming a /etc/hosts.deny of

  ALL: ALL

rather than list every router individually.  Note
that you need to use IP addresses rather than DNS
name patterns, as there's a slight problem if the DNS
is down because the router is down and the router
needs a backup configuration restored :-)

Finally, if you get some time, then modifying the TFTP
daemon to run a filter when PUTing a file would be
good.  You could then use it to zap passwords/secrets/
community strings in configuration files.  At the moment
you need to do this from a cron job or by hand.
