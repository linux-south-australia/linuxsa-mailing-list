&gt; Also, Looking at a Dell 6400 with 2-4 Xeon III 700's (2MB cache), 2GB RAM,

&gt; seem to run well (and reliably).

I've not dealt with Oracle on Linux before as I've found
MySQL/PostgreSQL to be powerful enough for what I do. Possibly I could
suggest something in the hardware arena, though.

While Dell make decent equipment, I'd not put anything mission-critical
on a server made by them. For the sort of money the aforementioned Dell
box is worth, I'm sure you'd be able to pickup something that is quite
capable made by HP or IBM, possibly even a 'lower end' Sun box. It's up
to you though.

Sun gear would be good; very good even. Sun equipment is cool :-)

&gt; I have never put Linux on a dual/quad box before. Once again kernel 2.4.x is
&gt; supposed to have better SMP as well, hence my interest in it. I have build
&gt; many 2.4 kernels sucessfully, but only for single CPU boxes.
&gt; Personally, I am a Debian person, but have used RedHat before if that is
&gt; what is required.

Installing Linux on a multiprocessor machine isn't too much different
than installing it on a single processor machine. I've not had much
experience with 2.4/SMP, but you may want to take careful steps as I'm
not sure how strong the 2.4 SMP code is.

&gt; Seems I have included quite a few questions up there. Can anybody help me or
&gt; give me some URL's?

Oracle have a relatively useful developer website (I don't think they
call it that, though). Have a poke around at <A HREF="http://otn.oracle.com/docs/">http://otn.oracle.com/docs/</A>
