&gt; I've just installed Debian 2.2r2 on my PC here at work. 
excellent... Fine choice of distro.

All is fine
&gt; except I can't
&gt; get networking to work.  I believe the network card is based on the
&gt; RTL8139 (RealTek)
&gt; chipset.  Everything works fine under Windows, so the problem has to be
&gt; a Linux one.
&gt; The rtl8139 module loads okay.  Doing ifconfig shows that eth0 is up. 
&gt; The routing
&gt; table has been set up.  Just that pinging the gateway results in 100%
&gt; loss of packets.
&gt; I am also getting error messages, such as:
&gt; 
&gt; eth0: RTL8139  Interrupt line blocked, status 1.

suggesting IRQ conflict? Did you install any extra hardware, when you 
installed? Whats does cat /proc/interupts (sp?) say?


&gt; 
&gt; eth0: Transmit timeout, status 0c 0005 media 00.
&gt; eth0: Tx Queue start entry 10 dirty entry 6.
&gt; 
&gt; I can think of a number of possibilities:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Perhaps I've configured things wrongly.  But I believe I've done
&gt; everything 
&gt; correctly and use the same settings as for Windows.

If the driver loads OK, and the ifconfig looks OK, them perhaps not. Should the 
driver detect an IRQ conflict? 

&gt; 
&gt; 2. Perhaps there is a bug in the driver --- I would try upgrading to
&gt; kernel 2.4 
&gt; but, catch 22 --- I need to be able to access the net to properly
&gt; upgrade.  For
&gt; now I am stuck with kernel 2.2.18something.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. Interrupt conflict??  I don't think this is the problem though.w

cat /proc/interupts to see.

&gt; 
&gt; 4. Firewall not letting things through??  I doubt this is the problem. 
&gt; I haven't
&gt; setup any firewall --- unless Debian has done it for me.  

Doubtful. /sbin/ipchains -L to see what is set up by default.

Also I would
&gt; expect 
&gt; different messages from ping if this were the case.  Can anyone tell me
&gt; a quick
&gt; ipchains command to check this possibility?

see above
