&gt; It is possible to pay less than that for a 1.5 megbit ADSL service,

Sure, for the connection, but I could also download a few gig a month
without any extra cost or raising any eyebrows. There's the _big_
difference.  I'm not complaining about the cost here in Australia,
just disagreeing that its about the same as the US prices.

It does have it benefits though - who in the US would have thought it
necessary to develop rsync? :-) Now if we could just get some rproxy
servers setup in the US.

&gt; costs in the Internet space), the fact that we've hit cost parity is
&gt; nothing short of remarkable.
&gt; It says that the Australian situation represents -better- value for
&gt; money than the US situation does. Not worse.

I disagree with the 'cost parity' comment, but I do agree that the
costs which are being charged to end users by most ISPs are quite
reasonable given the situation.

&gt; Bullshit :) I've been there too, you can't fool me, they're -all- crap.

ok. maybe not everybody likes all-day Star Trek marathon's :-) And
still no sight in Australia of the other Gene Rodenberry inspired
sci-fi series (whose name escapes me at the moment) which has been
showing in the US now for literally years. Oh, for a feed of UPN!
