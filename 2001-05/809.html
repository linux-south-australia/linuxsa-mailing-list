If I remember correctly there are two realtek drivers, one which is more 
stable and another which supposedly has better performance. maybe try 
recompiling the kernel to use the other driver than the one you are using. 
(ie switch from 8139.o to 8139too.o or vice versa).

just a quess

&gt; &gt; You can set 'reset configuration data' to yes in the bios, and on the
&gt; &gt; next boot the plug'n'pray will try to rework all the irqs. Then reset
&gt; &gt; configuration data will set itself back to no automatically, and then
&gt; &gt; you can see where you stand.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the reply!  I looked all through the BIOS (it's AMIBIOS) and
&gt;couldn't find a "reset configuration data" entry anywhere!
&gt;
&gt;In any case, I think the evidence is mounting up that it's not an IRQ
&gt;conflict problem.  My reasons:
&gt;
&gt;1. /proc/interrupts doesn't show any conflict.
&gt;2. On bootup the only conflict that is shown is between the ethernet
&gt;    card and the onboard VGA.  As you say, it would seem that both
&gt;    may be able to share the same interrupt without problem.  But
&gt;    even if it is a problem, I got rid of the VGA interrupt so no
&gt;    conflict was shown on startup, and yet I still could not see
&gt;    the network.
&gt;3. I've played around with all sorts of BIOS options, turning off
&gt;    onboard things like sound and modem --- meaning very few IRQs
&gt;    are used --- but the problem remains.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; You can also move the card to a physically different spot as some ports
&gt; &gt; are physically wired to others in the case of some motherboards. Usually
&gt; &gt; the pci slot closest to the agp will share the irq with agp, and the
&gt; &gt; furthest will share with onboard motherboard stuff.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for the tips!  I suspect the problem lies elsewhere, but if I all
&gt;else fails, perhaps I can try moving the card around.  (It works fine
&gt;in windows the way it is mind you.)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
&gt;Mark.
