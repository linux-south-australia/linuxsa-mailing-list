&gt;
&gt;Common misunderstanding.  Companies are to maximise returns to
&gt;shareholders consistent with the constitution of the company.
&gt;Nothing prevents the company from having non-monetary objectives
&gt;listed in its constitution.

Well, of course, but non-financial objectives are expenses that go directly
to the bottom line. Eventually, they get eliminated ...

&gt;Furthermore, companies have non-tangible assets such as goodwill,
&gt;trust and branding.  Directors' responsibilities towards tangible
&gt;and non-tangible assets are the same.

Yes, but branding, trust, and goodwill, which are all really manifestations
of branding, can be maintained with advertising and a bevy of expensive
lawyers to sue the pants off anyone who exposes dirty linen in public.

&gt;Finally, I expect companies to act morally because I expect people
&gt;to behave morally.

Ahhh, this is a good principle, but one that society has been grappling
with for over one hundred years, unsucessfully, in my view. 

&gt;                   There's some justification for this in the
&gt;companies law -- for example, the ability of a court to overturn
&gt;or modify unconscionable contracts and the requirement that contracts
&gt;be entered into in good faith.

But these are a consequence of the trade practices act and other bodies.
They simply seek to regulate the more excessive forms of company behaviour
and they are very hard to apply.

The deck seems to be loaded in favour of companies :-)
