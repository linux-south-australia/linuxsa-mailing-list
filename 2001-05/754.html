&gt;1. When I ssh to the box, it waits for roughly 2 seconds before prompting
&gt;for login, where as another box I have it's instant. Is this a problem
&gt;with the NIC, continue to issue 2 :)


Ssh creates a new key for each session, and since it uses large keys
this can take a long time -- not on a Cray Y-MP, obviously, because
they are very fast machines, but on the sort of machine that you and
I get to play with it can take, well you said it, a couple of seconds.
There are two modes for running Ssh: In one mode it is started by inetd
every time somebody tries to connect, and before it can present a login
prompt it has to create the key.  In the other mode it runs as a daemon
and accepts connections for itself.  In daemon mode it creates a new
key on startup, thus when somebody tries to connect it can present
the login prompt immediately.  In daemon mode it also creates a new
key every session, but that key is for the next session to come in,
not the session that it just accepted.




&gt;2. Sometimes when I am typing in the ssh and also in the terminal, the
&gt;machine will "hang" for up to 5-10 seconds, and then burst all the typed
&gt;data.

The mysteries of pre-emptive, multi-tasking operating systems are deep,
as are those of carrier sense, multiple access networks, and should only
be questioned by those who are strong in mind and body.
