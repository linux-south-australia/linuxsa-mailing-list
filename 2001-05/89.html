Hi all,

My company is looking at some Linux solutions for some issues we have
with our current network.  Take for example, the fact that our major
company-wide enterprise management package is a Unix based program that
had been ported to NT...  It's a dog :-)

We're going to move that over to RH Linux, of which I'm pleased - it
should run like a charm now.

We're also looking to Linux to replace a few other services -- email,
internet, etc.  Eventually even the whole lot perhaps.  I don't know.

As for e-mail, I keep hearing the words "Exchange" muttered around the
place.  Well to implement that system we'd have to dedicate an array of
super computers just to stop it from using all the system resources.

But anyway, I pursued the Exchange-type solutions around, and was
referred to HP OpenMail which provided very similar functions.  This
product is no longer supported by HP, and they will be no longer
releasing new versions, and only providing bugfixes for the next 5
years.

This basically throws that solution out of the Window in management
eyes.  The remaining option is Exchange unless another solution can be
found.  Really what they want is to be able to use Outlook for email,
calendaring, scheduling, contacting 'n all that stuff Exchange and
OpenMail do.

What are your suggestions for Linux based solutions?  Otherwise it'll be
Exchange.
