Prepared Text of Remarks by Craig Mundie, Microsoft Senior Vice President
The Commercial Software Model
The New York University Stern School of Business
May 3, 2001

Basically, he's hyping Microsoft's source code access program.  Some
of the hype is comical:

 "- Research Source Licensing: For nearly a decade Microsoft
    Research has licensed Windows source code to more than 100
    academic institutions in 23 countries."

To put "100" into perspective, the US has 1,000 universities of note,
China has 5,000, Australia has 40.  Even if a researcher at a uni has
access the CompSci students at that uni won't see the source.  100
people would have access to the Linux source code in the building
where I work, Microsoft gives access to about 100 people globally.

 "- OEM Source Licensing: Windows source code has been licensed for
    years to leading OEMs to assist in the development and support
    of their consumer and server products"

Check The Register site for how Microsoft granted Bristol source access
and then removed it when they presented a competitive threat.  Hardly
the stuff of "viable business models" referred to elsewhere in the speech.

The second half contains a go at the GPL.  Basically complaining that
Microsoft can't use GPLed code and still maintain a viable business
model.  To which my response it: so, why does it even want to use GPLed
code?  Don't they have a "viable business model" already?

Very comical is:

 "- The OSS development model leads to a strong possibility of unhealthy
    "forking" of a code base, resulting in the development of multiple
    incompatible versions of programs,"

and yet there's more compatibilty between the BSDs and the Emacsen
(the two worst forks) than between Windows NT and Windows CE.

Finally, there's a strong dose of GPL FUD:

  "This viral aspect of the GPL poses a threat to the intellectual
   property of any organization making use of it."

and yet you've only got to look at what Microsoft did to knobble
interoperability with its adaptation of the free but non-GPL Kerberos
to see why the GPL forces software authors to make their modifications
available to their customers under the same rights under which they
were orginally given the code.  Microsoft's stance is that their
customers should have less rights to other people's source code
than Microsoft does.

Finally, the arrogance of Microsoft is amazing.  Lecturing other people
about the One True "viable business model" and what license other people
should use to protect their intellectual property.  And harranging their
customers to buy only from the One True Business Model and One True
Software License.
