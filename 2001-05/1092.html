&gt; I think it's wrong to be charged $250 a year when I know it's really just
&gt; some sloth typing in a couple of lines and $249 of that money will end up
&gt; being pure profit for the company.

I can find at least one ISP that does it for $110 per annum.
Another that does it for $165 per annum.
I dontknow where you get your $250 proice form,. but it does nto apper to
be overly competitve.

Are you sure this doesn;t include domain regisrration as well?

By the way hosting a domain is not necesarily just creating a zone file 
and editing named.conf.

Ever tried to redelgate a domain, from some other ISP that does want you
to?

Ever tried to redelgate a domain for a company who doenst know what a nic
handle is, or a registry key, let alone what the registry key for their
domain is, or what the nic handle of their aDmin contact is..or who their
admin contact is?

Its not that easy to get that info if they dont know it, or if the staff
have changed, or about a thousand othert thigns have happened.

It can take you a few hours doing the old phone extension shuffle.

Say 3 hours at $20 per hour just tryignto find out the info you need, and
that the client should have if they had there doamin reistedered by a
reasonably reputable IPS or registry, theres half your $110 annual fee
already.

You will also note that typically you are not charged for traffic for
your hosted service, or carriage to the NAP which could conceivably be
quite a bit for a popular site.

The machine that runs the nameserver also has to be maintained.

Presumably you dont want them to just install the OS, edit the zone files
and then leave any exploits that are later discovered on the server's OS
open?

After all if exploited, its your domain that wont be working.

An then there is all the normal sorts of day to day stuff that has to
happen, like adding new hotsts, creating and adminstering sub domains
etc,etc.

There is also the problem of having to have 2 DNS set up on separate
reliable-ish inks.

Most people cant do this themsleves for cost reasons, even if they do know
what files to edit and how to edit them.

You ISP will probably do it for you if you have a permanent link, ut that
still aassumes your own link is reasonably stable.

I used to assist in the registration, redelegation and administration of
a coupel of hundred domains, it is not as easy as you might
think,especially  with the non techinical client, who has lost all the
paper work they were or should have been  told to keep.

&gt; The more people who share my opinion, the more pressure is brought on ISPs
&gt; to charge a fair amount of money for their services. The more I talk about

Your opinon woul have a little more validity if you had shopped around a
bit and quoted the lower prices.

The prices I got were from two regional ISPs and it took me about 5
minutes to get them both.

&gt; this, the more likely more people will share my opinion. The more people
&gt; complaining about unfair pricing, the more likely it will be that I will
&gt; be able to pay a fair price in future.
