Hi,

I've just installed Debian 2.2r2 on my PC here at work. All is fine
except I can't
get networking to work.  I believe the network card is based on the
RTL8139 (RealTek)
chipset.  Everything works fine under Windows, so the problem has to be
a Linux one.
The rtl8139 module loads okay.  Doing ifconfig shows that eth0 is up. 
The routing
table has been set up.  Just that pinging the gateway results in 100%
loss of packets.
I am also getting error messages, such as:

eth0: RTL8139  Interrupt line blocked, status 1.

eth0: Transmit timeout, status 0c 0005 media 00.
eth0: Tx Queue start entry 10 dirty entry 6.

I can think of a number of possibilities:

1. Perhaps I've configured things wrongly.  But I believe I've done
everything 
correctly and use the same settings as for Windows.

2. Perhaps there is a bug in the driver --- I would try upgrading to
kernel 2.4 
but, catch 22 --- I need to be able to access the net to properly
upgrade.  For
now I am stuck with kernel 2.2.18something.

3. Interrupt conflict??  I don't think this is the problem though.

4. Firewall not letting things through??  I doubt this is the problem. 
I haven't
setup any firewall --- unless Debian has done it for me.  Also I would
expect 
different messages from ping if this were the case.  Can anyone tell me
a quick
ipchains command to check this possibility?

Well, they're the ideas I can think of.  Any suggestions would be most
welcome!

Cheers,

Mark.
