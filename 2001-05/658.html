&gt; With LDAP you also have an option of placing a tree structure in to reduce

Afraid not.  The placing of accounts in OUs is frowned
apon as people's Distinguished Names then change when
the organisation restructures.  Organisational-wide
user authentication also becomes more difficult.

Current trend is to give all users distinguished
names of

  uid=UID,ou=People,dc=exmaple,dc=edu,dc=au

where UID is a user name used to logon to equipment.

In short, the problem gets worse, not better, with LDAP.

It's worse because you should never change someone's
LDAP distinguished name.  That means that it has to
meet all the requirements I posted previously.  After
all, you don't want to buy a nice IBM mainframe in
a few years time and find that you now need to chop
all user IDs to six characters.  Nor do you want to
name user IDs after people's names and find yourself
being haulled before the HR&EOC and not able to plead
ignorance because it's a corporate-wide user ID and
your EEO officiers have been informed explicitly that
user IDs are not exempt.

User IDs are so hard that there is a lot of attractiveness
in simply using a meaningless name, like randomly
choosen three consonants (so you don't get words) followed
by three numbers.
