Hi all,

Not sure where exactly this one originated, but it might be worth checking
out. Not sure where to go on this one.

Robyn

Please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online, and
continue using E-mail. The last few months have revealed an alarming trend
in the Government of the Australia attempting to quietly push through
legislation that will affect our use of the Internet.

Under proposed legislation, the Australian Postal Service will be
attempting to bill E-mail users out of "alternative postage fees."
Bill 602P will  permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge
on every E-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source.
The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP. Canberra lawyer
Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this legislation from
becoming law. The Australian Postal Service is claiming lost revenue, due to
the Proliferation  of E-mail, is costing nearly $230,000,000 in revenue per
year. You may have noticed their recent ad campaign:
"There is nothing like a letter." Since the average person received
 about 10 pieces of E-mail per day in 1998, the cost of the typical
individual would be an additional 50 cents a day or over $180 per year-above
and beyond their regular Internet costs.

Note that this would be money paid directly to the Australian Postal Service
for a service they do not even provide. The whole point of the Internet is
democracy and non-interference. You are already paying an exorbitant price
for ordinary mail because of bad efficiency.
 It currently takes up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered anywhere in
Australia or longer If the Australian Postal Service is allowed to
 interfere with E-mail, it  will mark the end of the "free" Internet in
Australia.
Our Canberra representative, Tony Schnell ® has even suggested a "$20- $40
per month surcharge on all Internet service" above and beyond the
governments proposed E-mail charges Note that most of the major newspapers
have ignored the Story, the only exception being the Sun Herald which called
the idea of E-mail surcharge "a useful concept who's time has come" (March
6th, 1999 Editorial).

Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away!  Send this to E-mail to
EVERYONE on your list, and tell your friends and relatives write their
Canberra or local political representative and say "NO" to Bill 602P. It
will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be
instrumental in killing a bill we do not want.
