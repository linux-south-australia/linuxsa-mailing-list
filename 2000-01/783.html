&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;It would seem Richard has accepted the challenge and donated even more of
&gt;his time and expertise to the newbie community.

True ...

&gt;It also seems someone with an interest in helping the newbies on this list
&gt;could transform this information, already provided, free of charge, into a
&gt;resource for the new bunch of newbies that will find this list.

'tis being done.  Geoffrey is putting them up on the LinuxSA site.

Other things are also being discussed.  No expletives are being used in
this discussion :-)

&gt;It would not be too hard to (with Richards permission of course) construct a
&gt;navigatable www page with all these (free) "lessons" on it. The maintainer
&gt;of this site could even write his/her own "lessons" to add to the list. You
&gt;never know if this maintainer was really keen (and didn't alienate everyone
&gt;else) a (free) online course could be developed from it.

I am more than happy for people to do that, and would welcome others adding
info as well.

&gt;The LinuxSA site has had the same few hints and tips on it for years that
&gt;could be the ideal place to host this resource. This is no reflection on
&gt;those who wrote the initial hints and tips at all just sounds like the ideal
&gt;place to put it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Here is a challenge for some concerned person. A chance to do something
&gt;positive and beneficial for the newbie user before these postings become
&gt;lost in the archives.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Cheers

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt; UNIX had the concept of IO redirection long before DOS copied and
&gt;&gt; bastardized the concept.  The UNIX IO redirection concept if fundamental
&gt;to
&gt;&gt; many of the things that you can do with UNIX, and it is quite a
&gt;&gt; well-developed idea, so we will explore this concept here.
