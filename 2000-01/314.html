&gt; Just checked it out. $1,995 is a bit rich for me.  I think I'll make
&gt; do with the information the net provides until I can find an employer
&gt; who is stupid enough to pay it for me.

I'd be surprised if you could find a course of similar intensity, scope
and length for less than $1,995.  Also keep in mind this would probably
be a fairly well-recognised certification?  That's a guess..  but I was
impressed when I looked at the web site :)

And I think the idea /is/ that employers pay for this sort of course.
Similar to if I was to want to do an MCSE, or an Oracle DBA course, or
a Cisco ACRC...  they're all multi-thousands.

An employer "stupid" enough?  I think it would be a very wise investment
for an employer to send an IT employee in this field on this sort of
course!  I know that I'll be suggesting that a fellow employee takes on
one of these courses to become my backup..  he may end up learning more
than me tho :p

My 2.2c.

Nick!
