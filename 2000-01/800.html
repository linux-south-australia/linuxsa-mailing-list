&gt; 
&gt; Can anybody recommend a reputable company in Adelaide that will sell me a 
&gt; quality workstation, and allow me to supply the operating system software?
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody encountered a similar situation before? I know Geoffrey had his 
&gt; famous encounter with Toshiba a while ago, but this situation with 
&gt; Microbits isn't quite the same because I actually need to use NT on one 
&gt; machine.

Hi Steve I work for a  company called DrPc as a technician and I'm sure we can
quote you on a system with no OS installed,   Email me with the specs
your after. I'd have to check with the boss on thursday if there are any problems with this
but AFAIK it would be fine.
