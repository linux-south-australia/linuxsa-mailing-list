&gt; Why is that not a problem? The BIOS needs to know about FDD / HDD to be
&gt; able to boot. Without, it will usually do the NO ROM BASIC SYSTEM HALTED
&gt; thing. Once you get past LILO or DOS (to run loadlin), Linux will take care
&gt; of the rest.
&gt; 
&gt; A different (read weird) approach would be to obtain a Network card with a
&gt; boot PROM and boot Linux over a network (from another Linux box of course).
&gt; Now No hard drives in Bios = no problem.

Matt - at the risk of telling you stuff you already know.......
 
Due to the nature of the problem (cant save any bios settings) all I
have to work with is what is already in the BIOS - since my last
"effort" I have 1 x 1.44Mb floppy & NO HDD;s (bios has defaulted to
HDD's=NONE). 

As long as I can access a floppy I then DON'T need to have HDD's setup
in BIOS for LINUX to detect them - because the BIOS doesnt know they are
there merely means you CANNOT boot off the HDD's - BUT you can boot off
a floppy using either vmlinuz for /dev/hd?x or lilo AND linux will
access the "bios-undefined" hdd('s) The only error generated by the pc
on boot IF I dont have the linux floppy in /dev/fd0 is that I need to
insert a system disk in drive a:  It ignores the hdd's cos they arent
defined! Same principle as why windoze cannot see linux/unix
partitions(unless you run ext2dos or similar win apps)!
Try it sometime - add a hdd (jumpered for slave or 2ndary whatever of
course) - make sure AUTO is OFF for that drive in the bios, so it wont
be seen... then boot up linux... you will see it detected (use dmesg if
it whizzes past to fast;)) You can even fdisk  it, mount it etc etc.

Re bootp option - considered that but liked my fix better ;))

Oh btw- the box in question now has 3Gb hdd Linux & 1.6Gb FBSDUnix, 32Mb
ram  & 2network cards...goes like a rocket (once I do the f1 thing when
it first boots up ;))

Cheers, Phil
