&gt;On January 1, 1900, "The Advertiser" said that the very sound of 1900
&gt;indicated that we were drawing to the end of the 19th century, or words to
&gt;that effect.  Without doubt they were saying that 1900 was not in the
&gt;twentieth century.  How are they going to explain that the twentieth
&gt;century was thus only 99 years long?

"The Advertiser" was wrong back in Jan 1, 1900, just as they are so often
wrong in many other things :-)

&gt;Hold up your hands, fingers out, and ask a five year old child to count to
&gt;ten.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ...  Stop!  Ten
&gt;is the first number in the *second* ten.  The first ten only has nine
&gt;numbers.

Five year old children often have no concept of the most powerful number in
arithmetic.  I certainly do no base important decisions on what a five-year
old says :-)

&gt;Our calendar was meant to be written using Roman numbers.  Write down the
&gt;Roman number for zero.  Oh dear.  Better make our calendar start at year 1.
&gt;Apparently we have only 999 years in the first millenium?  Or does the
&gt;third millenium start in the year 2999?

We have had two calendar reforms in the last 2100 years.  The Romans did
not have a concept for zero.  We should not base the present on faulty
ideas from the past.

0 is the first number in the units, ten is the first number in the tens,
100 is the first number in the hundreds, and 2000 is the first year in the
new millenium.  The first millenium just missed out because of mistakes
made in the past.
