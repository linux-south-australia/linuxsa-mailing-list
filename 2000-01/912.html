I imagine the TNT2 board design lengend used is very very similar to the ref
board design for the TNT2 by NVidia. So I cant image the board itelf being
the problem.

The only other thing that makes a difference is the drivers. What drivers
are you using???
If you are using the drivers that came with the card... get rid of em.
Go download the latest NVidia reference drivers (3.72 at this time) from
<A HREF="http://www.reactorcritical.com">http://www.reactorcritical.com</A> .

Also, if you still cant work it out... go to <A HREF="http://www.rivazone.com">http://www.rivazone.com</A> and
post a message on thier hardware bbs stating your problem. You might find
that other people there refer you to other reference drivers that are know
to work with the Athlon.

If all this fails... check your bios... make sure "assign IRQ to VGA" is
turned on. Also make sure that your AGP bus rate is not over 83Mhz (run it
at 66Mhz if you can).

&gt; I have just bought a Riva TNT2 Ultra based card made by a local SA
&gt; company called Legend. It goes quite well, however I have fallen over in
&gt; a number of ways.
&gt;
&gt; 1) It works under X straight off - I have XFree86-3.5.5 and the support
&gt; is included in the SVGA server
&gt; 2) It renders X perfectly...it does hdbench graphics test very well (I
&gt; forget the home page, I always end up having to look it up at
&gt; freshmeat.net) without crashing
&gt;
&gt; However, Windows packs it in completely. Windows 95 SR 2.0 doesn't cope,
&gt; I've patched it with the USB supplement and it still doesn't cope. I
&gt; even bought Windows 98 First Edition and it doesn't cope (I bought the
&gt; first edition at $20 less than half price...it's cheaper to get the
&gt; upgrade to 2nd edition this way). NT Server 4.0 (I'm not sure what
&gt; Service Pack though...it may not have one) can't cope.
&gt;
&gt; All operating systems above simply go "blank" no matter how I set it up.
&gt; They then have to be rebooted and chuck wobblies to the effect that
&gt; "There is something wrong with the graphics driver" and give me the
&gt; setup dialog (display setup) and it runs at VGA settings. You should see
&gt; how irritated I get when I discover that my $300 accelerator card runs
&gt; SLOWER than my S3Virge DX...
&gt;
&gt; Now, how does this relate to Linux?
&gt;
&gt; I am trying to diagnose whether my card is dead. I *presume* that if my
&gt; card were seriously dead then I wouldn't be able to use X or even
&gt; console and therefore this *is* one of those pesky Windows problems...or
&gt; is it possible to have a dodgy card but still be able to run X?
&gt;
&gt; (i.e. because X doesn't utilise ALL the acceleration, could it be that
&gt; the stuff which crashes just isn't used?)
