&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Who says the scriptures existed in the first place?  And if they
&gt;&gt; definitely did, who said they're right at all?  Who says they weren't
&gt;&gt; written by some guy(s) as a joke?

This is getting way off topic.  Time to move it over to talk.origins :-)

&gt;If they are a Joke, then they have a remarkable degree of alternate
&gt;historical sources to back them up. For instance, there are Roman records
&gt;dating from the time of Jesus, giving some details of this
&gt;"troublemaker". 

Hmmm, I would be very interested in these 'Roman Records'.  Can you provide
me with references?

&gt;                There is also archeological evidence for some events. I
&gt;prefer to interperete the bible as part historical, part local translation
&gt;of events (given for personal and political biases of the author and the
&gt;time, and the translator), and part guide on how to live a good
&gt;life. (There is a lot of excelent advice given in the Bible.)

You know, I have a number of Science Fiction books, and there is
archaeological evidence for events referred to in them as well, but that
does not make them true :-)

Then of course, there are the many inconsistencies in the OT and NT.  For
example, how many women went to the tomb, and who/what did they see there?

&gt;The chances are that it is not a joke or a fiction, tho there is much room
&gt;for "poetic licence" in it.

The NT and OT are clearly not a joke, and are probably not fiction in the
traditional sense of the word.  However, there are a number of
(non-canonical) gospels that did not make it into the Bible.  For example,
the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, etc.  A question to ask is why
were Gospels such common currency back then, and on what basis did material
that got into the Bible get chosen?
