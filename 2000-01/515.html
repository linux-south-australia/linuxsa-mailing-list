&gt;Nope!!  You can save as password protected for editing. eg.  read-only
access.

Oh great!  Another carrier for macro viruses.  No thanks.

&gt;&gt; I would have thought that PDF would be the delivery method of choice for
the following reasons:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1. Not easily editable.
&gt;&gt; 2. Often reduces document size, thereby reducing transmission costs.
&gt;&gt; 3. Supports copy/paste, so the text can be used in tender documents.
&gt;&gt; 4. Viewable on almost any system.
&gt;
&gt;So is MS Word.   worddview etc.

MS datafiles are NOT viewable on almost any system.  Even where textual
content is read, tables, diagrams, fonts, formatting aren't.  Please don't
even think about print pagination.

&gt;&gt; Any linux system can create a pdf from a valid postscript file using the
ps2pdf script included with ghostscript. There are similar utilities for
other platforms, and I'm sure many Govt departments would have Acrobat
Distiller (or a linux box hidden in the broom closet) Maybe the creation of
the pdf could be ahieved by printing from word to a samba printer that
actually is a script that generates the pdf and emails it back to the user
(or drops it onto his hard drive)

&gt;Applixware creates Word docs I believe.

Provided you stick to text-only docs, yes.  Printer characteristics will
not transfer, however.

&gt;&gt; My next best would be RTF. MS supports this, and there are a couple of
editors that support it directly in linux: Ted and Abiword. Ted is pretty
stable, I haven't tried the latest Abiword but it must be getting pretty
good by now.

Abiword/rtf would work; but no 'bells & whistles'

Overall, the only fully-transferrable SMALL format is ASCII text.  Even
then, there a CR/LF vs L/F adjustment is necessary.  My view is that if the
only CERTAIN way to accurately transfer what is transmitted is to use plain
text, why not use the simplest implementation?
