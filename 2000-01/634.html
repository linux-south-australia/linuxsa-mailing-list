I've been using XWINPRO 5.1 as well, and I love it. Labtam really has their
act together. I am playing with VMware on a Redhat 6.0 box and some keyboard
keys don't work in the VMware session. VMware.com tells me that this is due
to a lack of support for the XKEYBOARD and XTEST extensions, a common
problem with Windows-based XServers. Labtam said they will be adding
XKEYBOARD support in the next few months (hurrah!)

MI/X is reputed to be reasonably inexpensive, but it doesn't support XDMCP
(which I use). If you want an X-session, you have to start MI/X, telnet to
linux, 'export DISPLAY=1.2.3.2 (or whatever), then start X on linux to have
it show up.

As mentioned already, Exceed is a solid, professional package (used heavily
in industry).

Depending on how ambitious you are, XAppeal is available, and runs in DOS
(Format and sys the drive, install XAppeal3, configure it, run it. It even
comes with packet drivers, TCP/IP and XDMCP). I am trying to get it running
this week, but not having a lot of luck. I'll get it, though.

There was also SuperXTerm, but I haven't heard much from them lately... I
don't really recall their specs.

What I look for in Xservers are:
- XDMCP -query, broadcast, indirect
- XDM authentication
- XKEYBOARD extension (this is still new to me)

&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure this question has been asked before - but does anyone have any
&gt; recommendations regarding X-Windows Servers for MS Windows 95/98/NT?
&gt; 
&gt; I'm currently using X-WinPro v5.1, and it's really really cool.  It works
&gt; almost flawlessly, and I've done groovy things like having my KDE start
&gt; menu over the top of my windows start menu on the same machine etc.. very
&gt; cool and useful.  Only drawback, and it's a minor one, is that it costs.
&gt; 
&gt; Which servers do other people use/like/recommend/hate?  I'd love a free
&gt; one *grin*
