 &gt; I tried to use it yesterday from my normal Linux account, and ended
 &gt; up getting redirected to <A HREF="http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/Ecomm/BadBrows.html">http://rls.roads.sa.gov.au/Ecomm/BadBrows.html</A>
 &gt; which tells me to upgrade my operating system to either Windows or MacOS!

This link works fine from any OS (it's where you end up with if you
pass the "You're welcome here because you have a broken operating system"
check)

The damn RLS site has been insanely stupid about this for years.  Every
time I've asked they say that there's some undefined bug caused by a 
difference between MS Java and everyone else's (yet they permit Netscape
as a browser!), so for that reason they're going to kick out anyone they
don't like.  It's almost, but not quite, as bad as refusing an online
renewal because you drive the wrong colour car.

They've been promising an upgrade to the Java code;  once again, they've
been talking about that for years too (since very shortly after the site
went live, at least; I raised it with them the first time I tried a 
renewal).  I don't believe them anymore, and, given that the link above
works fine, I can't really say that it's worth caring anymore either.
