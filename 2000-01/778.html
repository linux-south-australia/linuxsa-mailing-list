Perhaps it is :-).  However, I apologise if it is not general knowledge
that the LEAST qualification needed for such a position is PhD (with all
the previous study that qualification implies, especially in Education).

Yes, I did flame. I make no apology for objecting VERY strongly to what was
said.

I guess one other thing that 'made me see red' was that most people on this
list really do try to understand and be helpful.  The "don't be so stupid
and lazy - but don't think I'm flaming you" post was completely inappropriate.
