<H1>Video Card (Kinda On Kinda Off Topic)</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->

<PRE>
I have just bought a Riva TNT2 Ultra based card made by a local SA
company called Legend. It goes quite well, however I have fallen over in
a number of ways.

1) It works under X straight off - I have XFree86-3.5.5 and the support
is included in the SVGA server
2) It renders X perfectly...it does hdbench graphics test very well (I
forget the home page, I always end up having to look it up at
freshmeat.net) without crashing

However, Windows packs it in completely. Windows 95 SR 2.0 doesn't cope,
I've patched it with the USB supplement and it still doesn't cope. I
even bought Windows 98 First Edition and it doesn't cope (I bought the
first edition at $20 less than half price...it's cheaper to get the
upgrade to 2nd edition this way). NT Server 4.0 (I'm not sure what
Service Pack though...it may not have one) can't cope.

All operating systems above simply go "blank" no matter how I set it up.
They then have to be rebooted and chuck wobblies to the effect that
"There is something wrong with the graphics driver" and give me the
setup dialog (display setup) and it runs at VGA settings. You should see
how irritated I get when I discover that my $300 accelerator card runs
SLOWER than my S3Virge DX...

Now, how does this relate to Linux?

I am trying to diagnose whether my card is dead. I *presume* that if my
card were seriously dead then I wouldn't be able to use X or even
console and therefore this *is* one of those pesky Windows problems...or
is it possible to have a dodgy card but still be able to run X?

(i.e. because X doesn't utilise ALL the acceleration, could it be that
the stuff which crashes just isn't used?)
