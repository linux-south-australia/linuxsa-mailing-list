&gt; But not everybody runs linux - isn't the idea here to try to pick a good
&gt; universal standard for documents issued by govt departments etc?  But, as
&gt; somebody pointed out earlier, this could be a fruitless exercise.

OK change that to read: pick an operating systems that is commonly used on
the desktop that doesn't have a freely available pdf viewer.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; For the record, I think HTML is a pain in the butt when it comes to
&gt; formatting.  You just /can't/ make an HTML document look the same as a PDF
&gt; or a DVI or even a DOC.  HTML is great for some applications - but, IMO,
&gt; not for tender requests, job descriptions, resumes etc etc.
&gt;
&gt; *idle thought* I wonder if it's possible to make modules for MS Word that
&gt; allow you to change the format under the Document Type box in the Save As
&gt; dialogue?  Can you make custom input/output filters for Word?  If so, is
&gt; there one for DVI or PDF?

It would need to be an OCR module, as PDF / Postscript don't actually store
any text. This is the reason why PDF is so popular, people can't just copy
and paste text as they please (at all). It is possible for modules to be
created.

You'd have trouble keeping HTML standard (look at the whole Netscape /
Internet Explorer thing - not to mention frontpage and it's $%# extensions
;-)).
