&gt; 
&gt; 'Opinion' would have been a better word that 'passing judgement', but
&gt; then you'd have been agreeing with me. No individual on this list has the right to
&gt; pass judgement. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. Big difference.


bollocks. Passing judgment is a personal right everbody does everyday. 

example 1
Will I eat this banana? Hmm it's a bit mushy, my judgement is that it
would taste icky, so I wont eat this banana and I'll let people know
what I think about this banana.

example 2
Will i read this stoopid thread? Hmm it's a bit mushy, my judgement is
that it would taste icky, so I wont read this thread, and I'll let
people know what I think about this thread.

&gt; &gt; Nick will _not_ be putting any cockamame web page (will you Nick? :)).

I was just taking the words out of his mouth that you had inserted ;)


&gt; Still a quick look at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term">http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term</A>=sarcasm
&gt; should clear everything up.

Thanks, but I'm quite aware waht sarcasm means. ;) (my - was that an
example just then?)
