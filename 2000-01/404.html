&gt;&gt; All you write is OK, but can anybody tell me if MS claims hold water? Can
&gt;&gt; anybody tell me why these error messages appear? If not it will be
&gt;&gt; impossible to convince most IT managers to switch from NT to Linux. Because
&gt;&gt; of this FUD from MS and the lack of well proven arguments that the FUD from
&gt;&gt; MS is what it is (FUD), I'm bearly allowed to run a test box with samba in
&gt;&gt; our network.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Confused? Well, what I'm trying to say here is: There ARE grate scepticism
&gt;&gt; whit MANY IT-managers to Linux and other Open Source software. The main
&gt;&gt; reason for this is that is MS well working marketing strategies with FUD,
&gt;&gt; and the inabillety to prove MS statemens wrong. It does not help to say
&gt;&gt; Linux is faster, more reliable etc, Samaba can take care of your file
&gt;&gt; sharing as well or better than NT... You have to PROVE it is, not just
&gt;&gt; claim it! I will not try to find out how you can prove it, I just can say
&gt;&gt; that I personally are more comfortable with Linux than NT. So to get people
&gt;&gt; to turn their head we have to tell them why MS claims are not true...
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Comments?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Regards Jo
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;Yeah. Agreed.
&gt;
&gt;I know people who say "yeah - linux is cool" but when it comes to
&gt;actually putting it into place in a commercial situation - they
&gt;mysteriously just *opt* for NT....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;ANother thing people say, is "Yeah but in NT you just click away and you
&gt;can do blah blah blah." and I reply with, "sure, but in linux you
&gt;actually have to know what your doing."
&gt;
&gt;NT becomes - "knowing the tricks and trip hazards of the GUI"
&gt;Linux becomes - "just knowing your shit"
&gt;
&gt;Nt troublshooting is - "look in TechNet to find the bizaar combination
&gt;of bad error messages to find the solution"
&gt;Liux becomes - "read the doco/FAQ, contact the author/mailing list,
&gt;download fixes/patches and/or recompiling the source code."
&gt;
&gt;To some, the linux troubleshooting is way too hard. 
&gt;
&gt;Maybe a linux techNet would be cool.....


Yes, but who needs *more* software specific propaganda. ;-)

Seriously though, I think something like that would rock. It'd also make
more IT professionals sit up and take notice. And Geoffrey can do show off
some of his PHP3 / PostgreSQL magic ;-).
