&gt;Obi-wan's advice....
&gt;"Unlearn what you have learned."

Got it (almost &lt;g&gt;) in one.  Most newbies these days are coming from -
often quite extensive - knowledge and use of another OS.  What makes
matters worse is that for most of us we simply cannot dump the other OS and
transfer to the new one.  In my case I MUST continue to use NT, not because
I want to, but because I have to retain compatibility with the *&%&#$
defacto standard, WinDOS.
This makes switching to Linux much more difficult than starting from scratch.
