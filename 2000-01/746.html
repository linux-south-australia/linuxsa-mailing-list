&gt; Even though I kind of agree with you....
&gt; 
&gt; Some people just dont have the time to do such a thing as work out a whole
&gt; OS from scratch by themselfs.

But... most people seem to do it fine with Windows. I think the point
is that people are always more familiar with whatever they start with,
and an alternative is so much harder to cope with regardless of how
superior it is, or how easy it is to learn.

I think that UNIX is more user friendly and easier to learn that windows
will ever be. I say this because I've seen and helped people (very few of
them mind you) who have ONLY used Linux and have started on Linux. These
are the people who need not heed Obi-wan's advice....

"Unlearn what you have learned."

It's also quite amusing to hear comments like, "Windows has a server
version?, Are you saying that they have a non-server version as well?"

&gt; A 2 day course, i imagine, is about equal to 1 week of blundering around in
&gt; an OS and learing by mistakes which could end up being costly.

For you, certainly. For others, maybe not?

Cheers

Alex!
