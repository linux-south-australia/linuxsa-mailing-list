&gt; &gt; This sort of cretinous technical policy from Corporates & Government

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Another issue is Government departments that issue tender documents
&gt; &gt; in MS Word format (!).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Your thoughts please.

&gt; 
&gt; I share your frustration and irrits. The examples are more and more
&gt; numerous. The latest is M$Word format copies of draft rulings of regs
&gt; for the GST (just click the M$ icon and close your mind!!) The
&gt; assumption that M$Word is a standard, not a proprietary format, and is
&gt; supported by the Aus Government adds weight in my mind to my opinion
&gt; that the Aus governments at state and federal level are ignoramuses. But
&gt; that's just me ;))

What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?  PDF?  HTML?
TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(

I like the idea of DVI or PDF - but everyone uses Word!  And Word can't
save as DVI or PDF!  As the techie at a govt dept - how can I help?
*grin*

Remembering that MS Office is the 'standard' wordprocessing software..

Maybe somebody should write a user friendly program that converts DOC to
a nice standard?

MS has forced a "standard", and that's what they always do, and that
cheeses me off.

How can we fix it?  I'm sure there are enough influential people on the
list for us to actually start making some changes around here :)

Another point - MS Office 2000.  This is scarey to me.  It's defining new
standards everywhere.  Their Intranet package - which you're supposed to
be able to quickly and easily set up a corporate Intranet.. "In Under 60
Minutes"  ("while I was at lunch the tech guys set up the intranet")  BAH!
This is both frustrating and a bit scarey..   BUT it doesn't work at "full
capacity" unless /everything/ is windows 2000 and office 2000.  The server
has to be running 2000, the clients have to be running 2000 and IE5.

The "if it's not all Microsoft, it won't work as well" mentality is coming
heavily into play..

Thoughts?

Phew!  Time for a beer :)
