&gt; My error messages have now disapeared, to be replacesd by a kernel panic,

There are some things that must be compiled in the kernel in order for it
to boot, don't use modules for any of these:

	- ext2 file system support  (sounds like your can't mount root fs
                                     problem)
	- ELF binary Support
	- Support for the drive linux is on. If you have ide then it's the
          IDE Disk block device. If you have scsi then it's the scsi
          driver for your card and scsi disk support -If it's in the
          kernel then you won't need to use mkinitrd to load it as a
          module.
	
These basic things if not modules will boot your pc. You many get many
error messages as other things start to load, but linux will still give
you a login prompt.

My suggestions on other things to add:
	- Networking support
	- Unix Domain sockets (not as a module)
	- Virtual console support
	- Serial port support (mice are alway handy as are modems)
	- TCPIP networking

With all this your system should boot fine. You can add/change things
later for speed, flexibility.

Cheers,
