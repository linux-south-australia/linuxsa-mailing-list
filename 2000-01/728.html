Hi Richard & List Users

The appreciation of fellow linux users on this this list is so thick,
it's just too hard to swollow. And I thought we were against MS people.

Anyway, Richard I am not a rich bloke and I don't have a lot of money
but I would like to attend BOTH of your courses. Providing that you can
guarauntee that that loud mouth Prick Paul is not going to attend.
There's always one in a crowd and I get the feeling that it would be him
if he were there.

The reason why: (for all you on the list who think I am stupid spending
this much money), I have spent the better part of 10 years contending with
Microsofts software, I have gained nothing but problems one after the other.
Frustration frustration frustration, headache headache and generally nothing
but an all round pain in the F@#$ing ass software. :(

About 2 years ago I played a bit with BSD that was on a server, and slowly 
I have picked up bits'n'pieces on how to do certains things with RedHat &
FreeBSD.
Most of this help can from a friend from this list. Without his help I
probably
would not have gained the small knowledge that I currently have. Thanks MAN :)

To cut a long sob story short. I installed Samba on an old 486dx 16mb RAM,
which runs twice as fast as my Pentium 166 with 64mb RAM and Windoze 95.
I was impressed.
I then installed Samba on a couple of other company's machines, they where
impressed also. From then I though that this thing called Linux really has
something 
going for it. No crashes, no "you need to reboot this machine" while 20
people are 
logged in etc.

So, I know shit about linux, but I am on a mission to change over as many
servers
from that MS (Much Stress) software as possible. I actually get a kick out
of formatting 
a box that has MS software on it and installing Linux, getting it to
actually do what the MS
software did and a little bit more. I even enjoying going back to the
company and seeing
how things are going, knowing forwell that things are 99% of the time
perfect, and the 
boss is extremely happy, especially when prior to installing Linux I never
wanted to visit,
because all I get is an unhappy company as a whole, and occasionally the
only remedy
for their problem is to format the box and install Windows a-fresh.

So know all I want to do is fill in the gaps of my knowledge and learn more
so I have more
to offer. The more I have to offer the easier it is to convience companies
to make the change.


Anyway, before I started all of that twiddle I was saying to Richard, does
the Linux
Course cover enough Samba to consider it to be the first days training for
Samba ?

If so would it be possible to hold Samba a day or so after the Linux course ?
Maybe doing The Linux Course first will give beginners a better insight
into how
things work, and therefore may make learning Samba a tad easier!


Hey Paul   ;)

Cheers & Thanks

PS.  I sleep a lot better at night knowing my data is on a Samba box (not
Windows)
