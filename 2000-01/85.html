G'day,

Have you tried using SMART, the web based Mars Admin tool. It probably won't
let you do all you want to do but it's a good start. We've used SMART to get
MARS working and then edited the NWSERV.CONF once it's working.

We've used MARS because it is not possible to use SAMBA for our application.
While MARS it isn't as easy to configure as SAMBA we've had it running as a
server at one of our sites for two months with no problems.

Regards,

Dave

		first i'll describe the situation as the use of the mars_nw
package may not
		be the best solution.

		I have a laptop running win 95 that I use on 2 (and maybe 3
in future)
		networks that have a linux gateway / server, each network
has several
		different drives that I wish to map when connected, my idea
was to use a
		NetWare server and login script that would map the drives
automatically
		saving me having to worry about win95 telling me the network
drive is
		unavailable etc etc

		Firstly is this the best solution?? I welcome other ideas

		secondly with the setup of mars_nw of read all the "english
documentation"
		(including the ipx howto) but cant seem to get it working.
I've used win32
		clients version 3.11 and dos 2.1 and the supplied mars dos
util but none can
		find the server where should I be looking to find any
problems (the logs
		don't report any) what info would you need to tell me more?
		Any help greatly appreciated

		(think i'm in over my head with this one)
