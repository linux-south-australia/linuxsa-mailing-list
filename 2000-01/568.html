&gt; Another stupid thing that, strangely enough, seems to affect both
&gt; netscape and IE5 in different waysd is a random lockup of input. IE just
&gt; won't respond to mouse clicks for periods of time from a few secodns to
&gt; many minutes (it doesn't buffer them either). Netscape stops accepting

This happens for me when IE5 tries to log into an FTP server.

It's a ridiculous bug that MS should have done something about before
releasing IE5, but they didn't.

It drives me crazy.  I don't let IE5 browse to FTP sites any more - I
telnet to my linux machine and use ncftp.  I'm always very careful about
which links I click on under IE5.

I agree with you though - I really like using Internet Explorer.  It's a
pity there isn't a browser that sleek and fast for Linux...

Netscape BITES.  Its interface is clunky and it's not nice to use at all.
I don't like it.

&gt; input into text boxes on occasions (sometimes it buffers the input,
&gt; sometimes not; sometimes I can use X's middle mouse button to paste text
&gt; in there, sometimes not...) In both cases it is completely unpredictable
&gt; and unrepeatable... and, even more bizzare, it only affects some windows
&gt; -- other windows work fine the whole time... 
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, this whole browser business has me rather upset...

Let's hope that someone makes a nice one for Linux soon :)
