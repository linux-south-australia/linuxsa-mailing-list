Also, microsoft said this was a fantasic new feature pity sun have been
doing it for a very VERY long time, dont know about sun 3/X's, but my sparc
1+ will do multiple monitors (and i think the custom version of xfree that
comes with openbsd or netbsd supports multiple montiors not sure though.)

I think these machines were released around 1987 very expenive  at he time.

&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Does linux support the use of multiple monitors creating a seamless
&gt; &gt; large work space similar to the win98 feature?
&gt;
&gt; Oh very much so. In fact it was doing it years ago. I was just telling
&gt; Geoffrey and Tique (NetCraft) yesterday about how three or four years
&gt; ago, NetCraft was famous beacause it employed that 'Geoffrey guy' who
&gt; was the hardcore linux guru with three vid cards and monitors.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I intend to use caldera 2.3 for the machine I'm switching over from
&gt; &gt; win98, I'm a real newbie to linux so any help is greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not sure on the official word on which X servers do what, but I
&gt; know that metro-X supports at least 4 video cards in a linear or 2 x 2
&gt; format.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
&gt;
&gt; Alex!
