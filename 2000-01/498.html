Hi.

The missing information here is to do with the possibility of tampering with the content of the original document. If everyone has MS Word, then everyone can _change_ the document. I would have thought that PDF would be the delivery method of choice for the following reasons:

1. Not easily editable.
2. Often reduces document size, thereby reducing transmission costs.
3. Supports copy/paste, so the text can be used in tender documents.
4. Viewable on almost any system.

Any linux system can create a pdf from a valid postscript file using the ps2pdf script included with ghostscript. There are similar utilities for other platforms, and I'm sure many Govt departments would have Acrobat Distiller (or a linux box hidden in the broom closet) Maybe the creation of the pdf could be ahieved by printing from word to a samba printer that actually is a script that generates the pdf and emails it back to the user (or drops it onto his hard drive)

My next best would be RTF. MS supports this, and there are a couple of editors that support it directly in linux: Ted and Abiword. Ted is pretty stable, I haven't tried the latest Abiword but it must be getting pretty good by now.

My 2c

&gt;&gt; &gt; that the Aus governments at state and federal level are ignoramuses. But
&gt;&gt; &gt; that's just me ;))
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?  PDF?  HTML?
&gt;&gt; TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I like the idea of DVI or PDF - but everyone uses Word!  And Word can't
&gt;&gt; save as DVI or PDF!  As the techie at a govt dept - how can I help?
&gt;&gt; *grin*
&gt;
&gt; In the absence of the ability to write as PDF, RTF would be good. I have
&gt; the ability to read in RTF on each of the systems I use. HTML would be a
&gt; good alternative for me personally, and I should say that both RTF and
&gt; HTML are used for *some* of the docs available from the ATO (bless 'em).
&gt;
&gt; I'll join you for that beer.
