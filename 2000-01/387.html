Being that I do use camtech, I feel I should respond. Please ignore the fact
that this email is from yahoo as I prefer to keep linuxsa discussion mail in a
different account.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Besides the fact I'm still having trouble installing due to what appear to be
&gt; &gt; device mounting problems according to support form Linux central -what is
&gt; &gt; silly is that as a student using camtech internet service providing to get
&gt; &gt; access from home, I'm not only limited to Windows but have to use Explorer as
&gt; &gt; well.

Please ask around first if you needed help getting onto the internet through
camtech. And have to use Internet Explorer??????? I didn't use the cd camtech
sent to me. If you wanted to use netscape just put in the proxy servers address
and away you go.

&gt; Not using camtech myself, I couldn't say for certain, but I find it hard
&gt; to believe that they could force you to use one platform and one web
&gt; browser without highly customised (more than AOL) software. The might not
&gt; supply install disks for the alternatives, but anyone with a little
&gt; knowledge could probably work it out.

They don't force you to use what you don't want to use. With a bit of reading
(books/online help) you can set things up yourself. You just need to ask the
right information. The most important info I needed from camtech/ozemail to
setup internet connection with linux was camtech's DNS addresses.    

&gt; But of course every student uses windows, there
isn't anything else is &gt; there !

Not everyone;)
