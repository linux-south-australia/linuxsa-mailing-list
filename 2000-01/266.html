Hello maidhili,

mcna&gt; Hi,

mcna&gt; I recently bought the revised edition of Linux pocketbook which includes 3 cds,
mcna&gt; one of which contains Red Hat 6.0 to be installed on the PC. I followed the
mcna&gt; installation procedures but have run into a bit of trouble. I have installed
mcna&gt; it such that I have the choice of running either Win98 or Linux as my operating
mcna&gt; system. 
  I used  the same pocketbook to  start  playing with linux too
  
mcna&gt; The problem I have encountered is that I am unable to get the sound working
mcna&gt; when I am running on the Linux operating system (it works fine when runningwin98).
mcna&gt;  As instructed in the booklet I have enabled sound as one of the services that
mcna&gt; starts up when Linux boots. The sound card that is installed in my PC is Sound
mcna&gt; Blaster16.
mcna&gt; Please advise me as to how to enable the sound on the Linux operating system.


try  running sndconfig  at the root prompt either at the command line or
in a Xterm.  It  may help  to note down the resourses used  by the
soundcard under win98  if you need to manually enter  them if the
autoprobe doesn't work.

mcna&gt; Another problem is that I wish for the option of being able to shut down my
mcna&gt; computer entirely after a Linux session, however I only have the options of
mcna&gt; rebooting or halting the system when I log out. Hence I am forced to reboot
mcna&gt; the computer, choose to load Windows and then shut down from there. Is there
mcna&gt; a way of getting around this so that I can include shut down as one of my log
mcna&gt; out options in Linux?

I think you answered  y to the question about  starting linux with  a
 GUI  so you  now boot straight into the "X window system " , to shutdown
 your box, just start a terminal (  xterm or konsole etc  ) and if your
 logged in as a user  type su - root then enter your root password when
  prompted  then type  shutdown -h now  to halt the system, or
   shutdown -r now to reboot the system .

   I'm sure someone in the group could tell you how to change your
   default run level from 5  (X windows)  to 3 (command line) if you
   want to start at the command line instead of the GUI, you can start
   the GUI  by simply typing in startx.



mcna&gt; Thank You very much for your assistance. Any advice you can give me is greatly
mcna&gt; appreciated.

mcna&gt; Regards,
mcna&gt; Maidhili Chinnappan

no problems, and good luck
with linux
