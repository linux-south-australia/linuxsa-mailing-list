&gt;&gt; I'd be surprised if you could find a course of similar intensity, scope

&gt;&gt; be a fairly well-recognised certification?
&gt;
&gt;$400 per day for quality training is not hugely expensive in the commercial
&gt;arena. 

Indeed, Microsoft courses are more expensive ... :-)

&gt;      Intending no disrepsect to Richard, who I fully expect will give
&gt;great training, I doubt that any certificate resulting from attending his
&gt;course will be of much value.  I imagine that employers seek people who
&gt;know their unix, and having attended a linux specific course will be about
&gt;as useful as having done a Solaris course; which is to say that if you know
&gt;your unix then the particular flavour is unimportant.  And if an employer
&gt;is relaxed over whether it's Solaris or FreeBSD or HP/UX or Linux, they
&gt;will care more about your experience than any piece of paper you might or
&gt;might not have.  They pay you to do a job, not to have passed a course.

I cannot argue much with the above. The course was designed to get the
delegates in front of a PC (we provide one per delegate) for as much as
half of the time they are on the course, doing things with Linux.  We go so
far as to have dual NICs and a modem per machine.  

People learn best by doing things.

WRT certificates, the most useful certificates will be those that you get
from sitting the LPI exams, and I suspect that they will not be all that
relevant until 2001 or so.  For the rest of this year there will be a
shortage of people who really know Linux (or indeed, UNIX :-).

&gt;If you want to learn how to grok unix then Richard's course will surely be
&gt;as good as, if not better than, any other quality unix course.  Take his
&gt;course and learn your favourite OS.  But remember that you must practice
&gt;your art to be useful as an employee.  Also remember when attending an
&gt;interview that you are skilled in unix.  (Why limit yourself to linux?)

I can't agree more with the last comment.  Linux is a version of UNIX.  It
has its differences, but in the end of the day, you will be comfortable
with lots of versions of Unix as a result.

However, the course is not for the UNIX literate.  Such people really only
need a 2-day Linux for the UNIX sysadmin (course in preparation).
