May I just enquire something here?  I &gt;&gt;THOUGHT&lt;&lt;  LinuxSA, is a USER group.
My recollection of USER groups is to assist one another in the special
interest that we each have, in this case, Linux.  So...  I thinks to mesself
as I do, why don't we run our own NON-PROFIT course for our "members"?  This
commercial stuff is all very nice if you have company backing and/or can
charge it to your customer base.. but that means that there becomes those of
us who have, and the other those of us who will never have..

&gt;
&gt; Yeah, so what do you expect?  Training isn't cheap to do.  Look at
&gt; courses from commercial UNIX vendors and note that they're given at
&gt; between $700 and $1000 per day.
&gt;

Yes, that's all very nice for those of you to whom money is no object, but why
are you advertising, and at the same time trying your damndest to justify the
cost, on a USER group mailing, when it it obvious that you have no intention
of helping those in this user group?  Your fees are obviously "proffessional"
but your approach is not.

SO, I throw down the gauntlet.  Make it available, by other means if
neccessary, to us mere mortals, or get off the mailing list.  I will go so far
as to say those of you out there who ARE interested in learning about Linux
(but don't have the means to pay for a "proffessional" course - (you could go
and do a MSCE for about the same.. and have a "guaranteed" job at the end of
it!!)) Let me know directly and if I get enough interest I will investigate
further to see what resources I can pull together to make our OWN course
happen.  However, I can only do this in Adelaide, so I apologise to people
from elsewhere for missing out.

I BET we, as a group, could run a course too.  The User group meetings are a
great way to get info and see how things work, but a "course" would cover the
required topics in an ordelerly manner to ensure nothing was missed and of
course would do it in a shorter time frame.  The user groups meetings are but
once a month which means it would take a year or so to cover the "basics".
(I'M  &gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt; bagging the user group meetings at all, just suggesting there
may be another way to do this.)

I have already mapped out a multi-stage course for Linux training, as I have
had this in mind for quite a while.  I am sickened by the few people on here
who think they are just so o o oo  good and therefore expect the rest of us to
pay up or shutup because THEY are PROFESSIONALS.  I say Bah, Phooey to  you.
Get off your high horses and come down to user group (human being) level.

There, I've finally said it.

Even so, best reagrds to the Linux community,
PaulK.
