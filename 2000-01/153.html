Gaelyne,

Without seeing the sendmail m4 ".mc" file, from which your sendmail.cf was
generated, for your specific configuration, it is difficult to suggest
exactly what to try. I have put a few suggestions below which may help. Also
they may not ...

Subject: Sendmail config problem


&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I have a sendmail config problem that I'm hoping someone can help
&gt; with.
&gt;
&gt; The problem relates to relaying mail for an entire domain to a
&gt; specific user on our system.
&gt;
&gt; We've been doing this in the past with no problems, but in recent days
&gt; we've needed to make what I thought was going to be a minor change and
&gt; now things don't work as they should.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the details are as follows.
&gt;
&gt; Our main server is 'videocam.net.au' we also host other sites, such as
&gt; NAME.com.au and vcsweb.com All mail to anyone at NAME.com.au needs to
&gt; go to a user on our system called 'joeshmoe'. All mail to vcsweb.com
&gt; needs to go to 'rod'
&gt;
&gt; Currently our name server has all of these domains using the same IP
&gt; address (203.38.186.193).
&gt;
&gt; The MX records for all domains point to mail.videocam.net.au (also
&gt; 203.38.186.193).
&gt;
&gt; Our sendmail "access" file has the following entries
&gt;
&gt; NAME.com.au  RELAY
&gt; vcsweb.com  RELAY
&gt;
&gt; To compliment this out mailertable file has the following entries
&gt;
&gt; NAME.com.au   local:joeshmoe
&gt; vcsweb.com   local:rod
&gt;

This is one way of doing things. It would seem that the "virtusertable" may
be also suited to your requirements. From the sendmail-cf README:

**start**

 virtusertable   A domain-specific form of aliasing, allowing multiple
        virtual domains to be hosted on one machine.  For example,
        if the virtuser table contained:

            <A HREF="mailto:info@foo.com">info@foo.com</A>    foo-info
            <A HREF="mailto:info@bar.com">info@bar.com</A>    bar-info
            @baz.org    <A HREF="mailto:jane@elsewhere.net">jane@elsewhere.net</A>

        then mail addressed to <A HREF="mailto:info@foo.com">info@foo.com</A> will be sent to the
        address foo-info, mail addressed to <A HREF="mailto:info@bar.com">info@bar.com</A> will be
        delivered to bar-info, and mail addressed to anyone at
        baz.org will be sent to <A HREF="mailto:jane@elsewhere.net.">jane@elsewhere.net.</A>  The username
        from the original address is passed as %1 allowing:

            @foo.org    %<A HREF="mailto:1@elsewhere.com">1@elsewhere.com</A>


**end**

So perhaps in your case a virtusertable entry of

@NAME.com.au  <A HREF="mailto:rod@NAME.com.au">rod@NAME.com.au</A>

may be all you need to get things working again (don't forget to rebuild the
map files from the text entries, see the sendmail README for more info).
Please bear in mind that this feature (virtusertable) needs to have been
enabled in the .mc file (eg sendmail.mc) that was used to generate the
sendmail.cf config file.

One of the easiest ways to tell is to see if a line like:

#####  @(#)virtusertable.m4 8.8 (Berkeley) 10/6/1998  #####

is in your sendmail.cf file. If not, you will have to add the feature to the
xyz.mc config and regenerate the sendmail.cf file.

However you may want to also try just adding

NAME.com.au

to your sendmail.cw file, usually in /etc, or /etc/mail.

&gt; THIS WORKS FINE.  If I send mail to '<A HREF="mailto:test@NAME.com.au">test@NAME.com.au</A>' it is correctly
&gt; delivered into the 'joeshmoe' mailspool.
&gt;
&gt; Likewise mail to '<A HREF="mailto:test@vcsweb.com">test@vcsweb.com</A>' find its way into the 'rod'
&gt; mailspool.
&gt;
&gt; Now the problem.  For various reasons we need to give 'NAME.com.au'
&gt; its own ip address. No problem, we simply changed the "A" record so
&gt; that it has the new ip (we left the MX records as they were - ie,
&gt; pointing to 'mail.videocam.net.au').
&gt;
&gt; The new IP (for reference) is 203.38.186.199, so naturally we needed
&gt; to add this to our interface table.
&gt;
&gt; /sbin/ifconfig eth0:1 203.38.186.199
&gt;
&gt; So far, all is well - the web and ftp server both work, and mail to a
&gt; *known user on our system* is being accepted and delivered (eg
&gt; <A HREF="mailto:rod@NAME.com.au">rod@NAME.com.au</A> gets correctly delivered to 'rod (@videocam.net.au) -
&gt; BUT when we try to send mail to '<A HREF="mailto:test@NAME.com.au">test@NAME.com.au</A>' we are getting an
&gt; 'unknown user' error message - In other words, the relay mechanism is
&gt; now broken.
&gt;
&gt; In short, as long as NAME.com.au has the same IP address as
&gt; videocam.net.au then all is fine, but if we change the IP and nothing
&gt; else, the only mail that can be sent to NAME.com.au is if the user is
&gt; known to videocam.net.au.
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully I've written this so that it makes sense to someone, and if
&gt; anyone can give advise on what else I need to change in order to get
&gt; it working correctly again I'd be very very thankful.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
&gt; Rod
&gt;
&gt;

Hope this was of some help,

Andrew Speer
