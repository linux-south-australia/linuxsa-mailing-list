Hi All,
    This reminds me of a discussion I saw a long time ago
about all of the other mythology in *nix systems. Apparently
there is ALOT, apart from the usual daemons, ghosts, etc. I
remember that it was an interesting discussion at the time,
but neglected to keep a copy. I wouldn't mind seeing a
discussion again because it was very educational *nix wise
because it opened up some of the mysteries of humdrum *nix
that normally isn't mentioned, but becomes important if you
ever had a problem. Anyone out there know some of this other
mythology and it's origins?
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt;thanks, David...
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Zombies are processes that have ended, but for what ever
reason, bug or
&gt;&gt; something, haven't removed themselves from the active
process list, hence
&gt;&gt; the inability to actually kill them.
&gt;
&gt;I didn't realise that it was the process's responsibility
to do that
&gt;(remove itself from the active process list)... I would
have thought
&gt;that the kernel would maintain that, and as soon as a
process ceases
&gt;execution, it would be removed... I'm probably mistaken,
though...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; They take no memory, and no CPU time, so are generally
harmelss, tho I
&gt;&gt; don't know whether they can cause you to run out of
processes on a
&gt;&gt; machine.
&gt;
&gt;So for all intents and purposes, they are not there, apart
from an entry
&gt;in the active processes list... ?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sometimes they can clear themselves, sometimes they
disapear when a parent
&gt;&gt; process is completed, and sometimes the only disapear
when you reboot.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Generally ignore them, unless you are getting alot of
them, in which case
&gt;&gt; it could indicate a misbehaving program.
&gt;
&gt;Nah, just noticed one, and wondered (also remembered the
existence of a
&gt;previous thread, but don't remember the content of the
messages...)
