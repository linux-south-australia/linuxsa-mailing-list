Firstly, I did NOT target &gt;&gt;read: TARGET&lt;&lt; an individual.  Show me where
I mentioned NAMES.  Secondly, I THOUGHT that a user group was to cater
for ALL levels, not just the tech heads (read some of your own
transcripts carefully.. verrry technical..)  More often than not the
technically brilliant people reply in such a way that ordinary people
have no idea what you just said.  Now, before you all go getting upset
with me again, there is nothing wrong with that.  What I have suggested
is that the average person CAN NOT afford these sort of fee prices and
made, I &gt;&gt;thought&lt;&lt;, a positive solution response to that problem.

I too, think that people like Richard Sharpe, are a great asset and
benefactor of such a group and they are essential (as some have pointed
out).  Sadly, course fees of this nature rule out 99% (OK, maybe 98%..)
of the rest of us.

So I haven't contributed?  Ah, I see. We have short memories or mailing
lists.  Right now, I am (somewhat) upset and am not going to repeat my
offer (here and now) to the LinuxSA group, which still stands and which
would benefit ANYBODY who wishes to take up on it.  AND I have no
problems with making my previous offer good to people like Richard, or
anybody.

Let me just think for a moment what sort of people are here..
Probably: newbies, who want to know about Linux (don't we want to spread
the word?), people who aren't even Linux newbies, just interested before
they take the plunge, people like me who muddle through Linux but aren't
"proffessional" (a USER Group type..), and of course the tech heads
without whom no user group would be complete and are the backbone of the
technical support in that group.
Does that about cover it?

Now the newbies are not really catered for in the way of training other
than meets, which I hasten to point out are great and I'm not bagging
meets and those who organise and run them etc etc.  But it seems to be
that is the "sub"-group who are most desperate (not literally, I don't
want to offend anyone now) for good basic Linux info and training. BUT
they are also the ones least likely to be able to afford these
beautifully crafted gilt edged courses.  There is nothing wrong with the
courses themselves, they are just over the top price wise for those who
don't get company funding, paid time off work et al.

I have suggested to remedy the pricing problem that we, as a user group,
run a non-profit course (which has been done from time to time before)
for the benefit of our membership and those interested in Linux.

So my previous posting regarding my OPINION of these courses was cause
for flaming.  You say I'm small minded, fine.

My ultimate goal is to promote Linux, educate as many people as I can
that I come across, and do my bit to make it accessable.  And this has
actually COST me money but I am not trying to recoup it from the user
group.  Those technical people out there have no need of my limited
knowledge, so I guess they haven't had the opportunity to work with me.
(Right now, I really don't feel in the mood for them  either..)

It's all the little people, who, once again, are shunted from side to
side, have no access to affordable tech support (other than user
groups), have to pay full retail on everything they buy or do without,
and if something breaks, they have to do without or wait threee weeks
'till they can afford a new one or the repair.  These are the people I
help.  I do not cater to only those with sufficient financial impetus
and backing.  So that makes me altruistic. True. It might even make me a
do-gooder. Fine.  But I know these people appreciate my practical help
just as much as the tech heads responses here. (This does not imply that
"tech heads" are bad, nasty, greedy or otherwise, nor do I use this term
in an intentionally derogatory manner - I am simply using the venacular
so we are clear.  They are the ones with the knowledge in this area and
as I said, are the backbone of electronic information dissemination
support via a user mailing list such as this. I just do it differently.)

So if I have upset an individual yet again, there was no intention to do
so, and nor was this targeted at an individual, however you may read it.

So right now, I may just as well go shoot myself.  Happy?
