Not wanting to take anything away from Richard's course offering, there
was an announcement today that may be interesting to some, regarding
certified Red Hat training in Australia (not Adelaide mind you - and
twice the price of Richard's course :)

See below for further details...

Michael...

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Red Hat -- the market leader in Linux and open source software, services
and information -- is pleased to announce the first series of
Red Hat Certified Engineer (tm) courses in Australia.

The Red Hat Certified Engineer Program (RHCE)--the leading Linux
certification--is exactly what you need to build your skills and your
confidence. You'll learn through a comprehensive, performance-based
certification taught by certified Red Hat experts.  And you'll be the
first among your peers to earn the internationally recognised RHCE
qualification - the leading Linux qualification.

                                -oOo-

ABOUT THE RHCE PROGRAM

With the Red Hat Certified Engineer Program, you'll get the training you
need straight from the source--certified Red Hat experts. Through
intensive, hands-on courses you'll learn critical Linux skills,
including how to install and configure Linux and the X Windowing system,
how to conduct basic diagnostics and troubleshooting, and more. Then
we'll test you. Not using the multiple-choice questions like most
certification programs, but with actual tests on live equipment. Tests
that accurately gauge your abilities in simulated real-world situations.
You'll gain confidence in your skills and the confidence of your
clients.  The RHCE qualififcation will distinguish you as a professional
Linux practicioner.

Linux is the fastest growing operating environment. Learn it from the
company that knows it best. You can obtain certification at your own
pace through one of two certification tracks: The standard track
includes several in-depth skill-building courses, perfect if you're just
getting started as an IT professional. The Rapid-Track certification
(RH300) 
is ideal for Linux and UNIX system administrators, engineers and/or
power users, and will be the initial course offerring in Australia. 
(Standard track offerings will become available over the next few months
-
- stay tuned!)

The full RH300 course outline is available at
        <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/products/training_course.html">http://www.redhat.com/products/training_course.html</A>
