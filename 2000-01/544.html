Because it's not.

I remember when PostScript *was* the standard.

It was too device dependant, too resource intensive, and the
files were huge.

You would occassionally get documents that were unprintable
and have to go in and manually alter the PostScript.  For
example, someone would have their word processor to print
to tray 2, and your printer only had one tray.  Or it would
ask for US Letter paper and you only had A4.  Or it would
die because MysteryFont size 12 wasn't on your system -- not
that the document used it, but it just tried to load all the
fonts to cache them.

I'm glad we're moving away from that.

Personally:

 - HTML for most stuff.

 - PDF for when documents must preserve formating (and there
   are precious few of these).

 - The source format, whatever that is, for documents that
   exist to be altered.  This probably needs to be RTF for
   Microsoft products to avoid some inter-version compatibility
   issues, and similarly MIF for FrameMaker.

 - DXY for CAD and maps.

I like web pages that give choices, for example:

  &lt;a href="fred.html"&gt;Minutes of meeting between A and B&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;small&gt;
   (&lt;a href="fred.pdf"&gt;Abobe PDF&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href="fred.doc"&gt;MS Word 97&lt;/a&gt;)
  &lt;/small&gt;

And the release of FrameMaker for Linux will make this much simpler
(using fmbatch you can scan for *.doc files on the web site and
write .html and .pdf versions).  Although I understand why Adobe
did this, they hot themselves in the foot a bit by not releasing
the Frame beta with the filter and PDF components.
