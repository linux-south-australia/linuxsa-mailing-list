&gt; Hmmm, I seem to recall that part of the joke was that you, and the
&gt; interviewer, expected the boy to have been attacked by a cat, but it was a
&gt; bat.

Yes yes yes yes. You were supposed to play along... Your line was "No, a bat".

To which I would have probably said, "Have you considered substituting
the letter c for the letter k?"

You could have then said, "What spell bolour with a k?   Kolour?

Oh!

I wonder why I never thought of that before, what a silly bunt."

&gt; I do not have any Monty episodes, except on that old media that I can no
&gt; longer play (called records) so it is hard to check :-)

I'm sure the script is on-line, but I can't be bothered looking, and
the scripts are often different to the final recording they did.

Cheers

Alex!
