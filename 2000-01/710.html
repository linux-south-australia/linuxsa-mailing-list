Hi everyone,
  Just a short, personal comment.  

If you were trying to get a department manager interested in letting you
install a Linux box as an Internet gateway or for some other perpose would
that not be much easier if you could site a Commercially available course
to train someone else in its maintanace!

  Do you think it would be easier if we sited a usergroup training course!
I think not.

  I was lucky, I was able to introduce many Linux boxes for RAS, Proxy,
Firewall, DNS and VPN's without such support available.  However, I
recently organised for my Boss to attend one of Richards Courses which has
secured the use of Linux in my workplace for a long time to come!!!

  I am not asking for those who disagree to change their mind I am just
stating my personal opinion.

		Steven Ellison
