In answer to your query about AD anno dommini means in the year of our
Lord. The year he was born.

But I do like Beforo Christo!!

&gt; My final comment(s) on the Millenium ;)
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Andrew, you get 10/10 for your research.
&gt; 2) I think you are all wrong & Andrew is right & the millenium was in
&gt; 1994 and that still doesnt account for my "Papal Tardis" theory btw.
&gt; 3) I'll bet the Romans in 4BC didnt know it was 4BC
&gt; 4) If JC was born in 4BC or 2BC then  it wasnt 4BC or 2BC cos he was
&gt; born
&gt; 5) I still want to know where the other 32 years went between BC & AD -
&gt; AND ANDREW - I do not see why anno domini can not be "roughly"
&gt; translated to mean "after JC died" I see no data in your research to
&gt; contradict my translation ;)
&gt; 6)AND another thing... if AD is latin then BC should also be so...
&gt; Beforo Christo or something similiar
&gt; 7) After much deliberation based on the evidence before me, I have
&gt; concluded that the Millenium actually occurred in August 1963
&gt; a) 2000 - 32years we lost between BC & AD = 1968
&gt; b) 1968 - 4years cos Herod was dead in 4bc approx = 1964
&gt; c) 4 months cos Pope Gregory entered the Papal Tardis & whizzed forward
&gt; 4 months or so
&gt; d) The square root of the hippopotamus is equal to something beginning
&gt; with 3
&gt; I find it really rude that some ppl have trivialised this thread in an
&gt; effort to stop it :)
&gt; 
&gt; I am going to bed ...night all
