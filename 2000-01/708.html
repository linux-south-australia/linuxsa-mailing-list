Your shameless abuse of Richard and others is disgusting and childish to
say the least and yes I'm replying publicly so others can see this too.
I have received help from Richard and other regular contributors on this
mailing list. I've even taken my machine to a meeting where I received
some help, even though my questions were trivial to an experienced user
they were taken seriously and answered well.

&gt; May I just enquire something here?  I &gt;&gt;THOUGHT&lt;&lt;  LinuxSA, is a USER group.
&gt; My recollection of USER groups is to assist one another in the special
&gt; interest that we each have, in this case, Linux.  So...  I thinks to mesself
&gt; as I do, why don't we run our own NON-PROFIT course for our "members"?  This
&gt; commercial stuff is all very nice if you have company backing and/or can
&gt; charge it to your customer base.. but that means that there becomes those of
&gt; us who have, and the other those of us who will never have..

&gt; &gt;  &gt; That counts me out.
&gt; &gt;  &gt; almost the same price as the other linux course that was in this list
&gt; &gt;  &gt; resently
&gt; &gt;  &gt; $1995 for 5 days.. $399 a day.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yeah, so what do you expect?  Training isn't cheap to do.  Look at
&gt; &gt; courses from commercial UNIX vendors and note that they're given at
&gt; &gt; between $700 and $1000 per day.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, that's all very nice for those of you to whom money is no object, but why
&gt; are you advertising, and at the same time trying your damndest to justify the
&gt; cost, on a USER group mailing, when it it obvious that you have no intention
&gt; of helping those in this user group?  Your fees are obviously "proffessional"
&gt; but your approach is not.
&gt; 
&gt; SO, I throw down the gauntlet.  Make it available, by other means if
&gt; neccessary, to us mere mortals, or get off the mailing list.  I will go so far
&gt; as to say those of you out there who ARE interested in learning about Linux
&gt; (but don't have the means to pay for a "proffessional" course - (you could go
&gt; and do a MSCE for about the same.. and have a "guaranteed" job at the end of
&gt; it!!)) Let me know directly and if I get enough interest I will investigate
&gt; further to see what resources I can pull together to make our OWN course
&gt; happen.  However, I can only do this in Adelaide, so I apologise to people
&gt; from elsewhere for missing out.
&gt; 
&gt; I BET we, as a group, could run a course too.  The User group meetings are a
&gt; great way to get info and see how things work, but a "course" would cover the
&gt; required topics in an ordelerly manner to ensure nothing was missed and of
&gt; course would do it in a shorter time frame.  The user groups meetings are but
&gt; once a month which means it would take a year or so to cover the "basics".
&gt; (I'M  &gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt; bagging the user group meetings at all, just suggesting there
&gt; may be another way to do this.)
&gt; 
&gt; I have already mapped out a multi-stage course for Linux training, as I have
&gt; had this in mind for quite a while.  I am sickened by the few people on here
&gt; who think they are just so o o oo  good and therefore expect the rest of us to
&gt; pay up or shutup because THEY are PROFESSIONALS.  I say Bah, Phooey to  you.
&gt; Get off your high horses and come down to user group (human being) level.
&gt; 
&gt; There, I've finally said it.
&gt; 
&gt; Even so, best reagrds to the Linux community,
