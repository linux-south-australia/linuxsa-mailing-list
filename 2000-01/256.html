&gt; Hi,
&gt;

Hi,

&gt;
&gt; I recently bought the revised edition of Linux pocketbook which includes 3 cds,
&gt; one of which contains Red Hat 6.0 to be installed on the PC.

Congratulations ;-)


&gt; I followed the
&gt; installation procedures but have run into a bit of trouble. I have installed
&gt; it such that I have the choice of running either Win98 or Linux as my operating
&gt; system.
&gt;

Always good for those who are new to Linux.


&gt;
&gt; The problem I have encountered is that I am unable to get the sound working
&gt; when I am running on the Linux operating system (it works fine when runningwin98).
&gt;  As instructed in the booklet I have enabled sound as one of the services that
&gt; starts up when Linux boots. The sound card that is installed in my PC is Sound
&gt; Blaster16.
&gt;

Try opening up an xterm or some form of console screen and type:

    sndconfig

This is a quick program written by RedHat Software to detect and install your sound
card. It should find the Sound Blaster 16 without any hassles. The only problem you
may have is sndconfig complaining about your kernel not supporting modules. The
kernel is the core part of any operating system. With systems like Linux and even
FreeBSD, you have the option of including only what you need. For example, if you
don't have a network, you don't have to include support for networking. This means
there you can tailor your operating system exactly to your needs.

If sndconfig does complain about the lack of module support, you will need to
recompile your kernel. You do not need to know how to program to do this. You will,
however, need to have a few things installed.

    egcs
    bin-utils
    glibc-devel
    kernel-source
    kernel-headers and
    make

You may not have these installed (and if I have forgotten something you need, someone
else on this list will surely point it out). This is the hardest part for beginners
to get. You will find the rpms in the RedHat/RPMS directory on the CD. To install you
can use

    rpm -i [packagename]

where packagename is the file name of the package (eg egcs-1.1.2-12-i386.rpm). You
may also be able to use something like gnorpm (a graphical version of rpm), but I am
unfamiliar with it myself.

Once you have successfully installed these packages, open up another terminal window
and if you aren't logged in as root, do so with:

    su root

and typing in the root password.

then type:

    cd /usr/src/linux

which changes to the directory containing the linux source. If you are running
X-Windows type:

    make xconfig

Or if that doesn't work, type:

    make menuconfig

This is the bit where you select what is in your new kernel. Be sure to read the help
screens, as you can render your system unbootable. You probably won't need things
like ISDN or the like, so you can disable them.

You will want to include a lot of stuff as modules (that's the 'M' option), as this
makes your kernel smaller and less resource hungry. Be sure to keep basic things in
the kernel statically though (that's the '*' option). It will take a while, but take
your time.

once you have done this, you will want to quit the program (saving your changes, of
course!) and type:

    make dep clean modules modules_install ; depmod -a

and you will want to add some lines to a file called lilo.conf in the /etc directory
(you can use the editor gedit). You will need to be logged in as the root user.Yours
will look very similar to the following.

boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label=Linux
        root=/dev/hda3
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.5-22.img
        read-only
other=/dev/hda1
        label=Win95
        table=/dev/hda

You will want to add the new lines in before the first image line. The lines I added
were:

image=/vmlinuz
        label=Linux
        root=/dev/hda3
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.5-22.img
        read-only

You will notice that they are almost identical to the first image line. The only
difference is the image= bit. Once you have added these lines, change the *original*
label= line to say label = linuxOLD

This allows you to boot your system from the original configuration if you did some
thing wrong.

Now, finally, you go back to the terminal window you had open (this bit will take a
while) and type

    make zlilo

(still from the linux source directory) and when you see the

    Added Linux*
    Added LinuxOLD
    Added dos

Or whatever, and you are done.

The next time you reboot (this is one of the very few things you need to restart your
computer for), you can run sndtool again and live happily ever after.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Another problem is that I wish for the option of being able to shut down my
&gt; computer entirely after a Linux session, however I only have the options of
&gt; rebooting or halting the system when I log out. Hence I am forced to reboot
&gt; the computer, choose to load Windows and then shut down from there. Is there
&gt; a way of getting around this so that I can include shut down as one of my log
&gt; out options in Linux?
&gt;

Try the 'halt' option. It may ask you for a password. If you reboot, you can safely
switch off you computer when it is going through the self-test, before Windows or
Linux is started.


There are linuxsa meetings (check the linuxsa web site for details), there was talk
of there being meetings / parts of meetings specifically for very-beginners. If you
are interested, E-Mail the list, as I am sure it would happen if enough people were
interested.

I hope some of this help, I know it can seem pretty difficult, but if you read what
Linux is telling you and don't just rush into things, you rarely go wrong. If you
installed the Documentation, it's in /usr/doc (you can use something like the gedit
text editor to view it). You will want to look through /usr/doc/HOWTO.

Matt
