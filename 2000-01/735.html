Morning all... I have been following this thread with interest since it
started.Here's my 2c worth.

When I saw Richards original post I thought "bugger, wish I could afford
that!" Richard offering a course really had stuffall to do with newbies
per se..and I dont think his course is really geared for the virgin
newbie anyway!. He was just subtly (or maybe unsubtly!)"advertising" and
really, it was done rather well considering it was an ad ;) It is bloody
silly to think that a commercial course is going to cost  5/8ths of
stuff-all and yes it IS expensive but then you get what you pay for!! 

As someone who remotely administers 7 Linux Boxes & 1 FreeBSD box for an
ISP and another 4 linux & 2 FreeBSD for some other organisations,  I am
obviously NOT a newbie..however I have never attended a course, dont
have a uni degree & am totally self taught. It is a constant source of
aggravation to me that there is a shitload of stuff I dont know about
Linux/Unix. I would love to attend a "real course" but time & money do
not permit.... that doesn't give me the right to slag off at richard btw
(or anyone else who runs a commercial course )..it's not his fault I
cant find the money or get time off from my "real" job (which has
absolutely nothing to do with computers at all unfortunately! :(  ) Why
should he give his time & effort away for nothing..it's his bread &
butter!

I am currently learning the hard way exactly how much time & effort it
takes to set up a course...I have to a) set up a network of about 8
linux boxes at one of the local high schools and link it in to their
existing windoze network...& then b) run a course over 8 weeks to teach
4 teachers & 12 students HOW to install/setup/use linux . Whilst I am
being paid what I consider to be a large sum of money to do this, I can
assure you all that in terms of the time spent in preparation, I have
worked out that I am being paid MINUS $28-23 an hour!! I am sure that my
course will not even vaguely come near the quality of richard's.. if it
did I would be wanting a shitload more money for my time!!

With the greatest of respect to the various participants in this
"debate" who raised the "newbie" factor, I really wonder whether
Richard's course would be of value to a newbie anyway???? If someone
wants to run a "basic linux for newbies" course, good on them, I am sure
it will be well attended and I am equally sure that whoever runs it will
have a new & valuable insight into just how much time & preparation are
needed to run such a course.

In all seriousness, if you want to flame Richard for "advertising", go
for it, it was after all, a tad commercial (altho I was not bothered by
this fact and there are quite a few people on this list who are employed
in the industry & whose employers would pay for the course so what
better way to advertise ;))).. but to bring all this other crap into the
debate is really quite petty and somewhat irrelevant. 

Anyway, thats what I think abt all this!
Cya, Phil.
