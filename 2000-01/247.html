Sean,

Thanks for your help..

X is what uses most of the memory - it seems to creep up as I use the Net, from
35 megs to 50, before it seems to stabalise at 65..  Top also tells me that I
have 128 megs of RAM, most of which is used.  Linux runs like a dream until I
connect to the Net.  I suspect Netscape has something to do with it, and I can't
install it with RPM or gnoRPM, as they do not recognise the RPM formate
(update?  I have had a lot of trouble trying to udpate these applications, I am
quite lost - dependancies needed, conflicts, so forth).

Someone on IRC suggested that I have a memory leak, that some program is 'short
changing' and not releasing all the memory it uses, resulting in a net drain in
memory.  There are so many files that I can download for linux, that I don't
know where to start if I need to update my system.

Ian.

&gt; &gt; My RH 6.0 2.2.5-22 system tells me that it needs over 300 megs of memory
&gt; &gt; while I have PPP / netscape /  IRC and a few other small applications

&gt;
&gt; What tells you that you need over 300M of memory?  Rather than update
&gt; everything, lets find out what needs fixing.
&gt;
&gt; Run top, and press M to sort processes by memory usage.  Does anything
&gt; show up as using more than a few meg under the RSS heading?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;From memory: If top or cat /proc/meminfo says you are using all of your real
&gt; memory (300M? :), but not your swap, that is normal.  Linux uses memory
&gt; which is not needed by applications for file system caching.  If your
&gt; applications need more memory, the file system cache size shrinks.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, my favourite source of updates for Redhat is
&gt; ftp.au.redhat.com (which is on mirror.aarnet.edu.au).  Just grab the
&gt; rpm's that you want, not the whole thing.  It shouldn't come to more than
&gt; a few meg once you know what you want to update.  My second favourite
&gt; source of updates is the APM Linux Pocketbook CD's.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; PS
&gt;
&gt; If it says:
&gt;
&gt; Message from <A HREF="mailto:r00t3d@slide.com.au">r00t3d@slide.com.au</A> on ttyp1 at 00:14 ...
&gt; We need more memory, captain!

&gt;
&gt; Then it is time to update your system :)
