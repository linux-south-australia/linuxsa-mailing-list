Certainly true -- It's usually upwards of $1000 per day.

 &gt; Intending no disrepsect to Richard, who I fully expect will give
 &gt; great training, I doubt that any certificate resulting from attending his
 &gt; course will be of much value.  I imagine that employers seek people who
 &gt; know their unix, and having attended a linux specific course will be about
 &gt; as useful as having done a Solaris course; which is to say that if you know
 &gt; your unix then the particular flavour is unimportant. 

No, that's your position as a UNIX-literate individual.  However, 
as someone who has been involved with UNIX training for three and a 
half years with Sun and SGI, I can tell you that employers usually
don't think like that:  They see labels like "Solaris", "IRIX", "Linux",
"HP-UX", etc and say, "Well golly gee, they all sound different, I'd
better get my staff on courses for each of the OS's I use."

During my years as a trainer, I had *many* students who had been placed
on a System Admin or Network Admin course for, say, IRIX, who would
be back in the training lab doing the same course for, say, Solaris
six or twelve months later.  The two courses would be covering the same
stuff, with the same commands, because the two OS's are both SysV 
UNIXen derived from the same source code, but "Management" thought
it'd be a great idea to cover their bases (and the employee concerned
enjoyed the idea of a junket, a new certificate for their CV, and a
week away from work :-)

So, for people giving Linux courses this is great <A HREF="news:">news:</A>  Management is
too ignorant to understand that if you know one flavour of UNIX well
you usually don't need further training in other flavours.  It's probably
bad news for job seekers putting themselves through training, though:
If you've done a Linux course and you're going for a Solaris job, 
ignorant management and HR types won't necessarily understand that you'll
be competent in Solaris too.  

 &gt; And if an employer
 &gt; is relaxed over whether it's Solaris or FreeBSD or HP/UX or Linux, they
 &gt; will care more about your experience than any piece of paper you might or
 &gt; might not have.  They pay you to do a job, not to have passed a course.

Unfortunately, while this is the pragmatic and realistic view, there are
many employers out there who don't actually think that way.

It also needs to be said that there are a lot of lazy *employees* out 
there who, when asked to do something new, respond by saying, "I can't,
I haven't had any training in that," instead of just jumping in and 
doing it.  Yes, those sorts of people are fantastic sources of revenue
if you're a training company, but they also serve to reinforce in the 
minds of management that UNIX is a training nightmare, and that different
flavours require different training.  Think for a moment about what 
sort of dollars such a manager would associate with a migration to 
Linux, and whether they'd want to go ahead with the expenditure it'd
entail...

 &gt; If you want to learn how to grok unix then Richard's course will surely be
 &gt; as good as, if not better than, any other quality unix course.  Take his
 &gt; course and learn your favourite OS.  But remember that you must practice
 &gt; your art to be useful as an employee.  Also remember when attending an
 &gt; interview that you are skilled in unix.  (Why limit yourself to linux?)

This is all true.  And interview skills aren't usually covered in Sysadmin
courses (especially when current employers are paying :-)
