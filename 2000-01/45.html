Hi Alan,

That's because it is an old SunOS machine that probably
isn't Y2K compliant [1].

You are welcome to use

  ntp.saard.net

or

  ntp.adelaide.edu.au

as public stratum 2 time servers.  They are Y2K compliant,
and have good uptimes.  They sync using authenticated
connections to GPS and atomic clock derived stratum 1 servers.
They will eventually sync to an in-house GPS.

These are DNS aliases and the machine that they refer to
may change, especially if we buy an off-the-shelf IP GPS
system.

As far as hop-count goes, don't stress out.  Most of the
routers in the path are backbone-class routers with low-
latency hardware forwarding.  And we're working on getting
better connectivity to SAIX -- you're welcome to bother
your local politican about the Telco Act stiffling uni
and research connectivity.

Regards,
glen

[1] I don't work for Engineering at UoAdelaide, so I don't know
    anything beyond this.  They may have cold rolled the
    machine, forgetting its public function.
