To PHP3 experts:

Following Matt's talk on PHP3, and because
modifying a perl/CGI script is such a pain,
I've decided to give PHP3 a go.

Certain things don't seem to work as
advertised though.

I installed the RPM for PHP3 on my RH 5.2 system,
and it all seems to actually work, to my very
great astonishment and pleasure.
The server actually interpets a little test script
correctly.

However, I then thought I'd like to get
a bit of security into it, and prevent any other
users on my machine from using PHP3 scripts
in the other Virtual Hosts.

Therefore I thought it would be a simple matter to
put things like:

safe_mode               =       On
doc_root                = /home2/dog/httpd/php3

in the php3.ini file.
I put this file in /usr/local/lib, which is where the
INSTALL file says it usually goes.
But the last-read date on this php3.ini file does
not change, indicating that the re-started httpd
process does not read it.
So I tried copying the php3.ini file to
/etc/httpd, which is where SuSE 6.2 puts it.
Still no luck.

So I tried putting the following in the httpd.conf <A HREF="file:">file:</A>

php3_safe_mode               =       On
php3_doc_root                = /home2/dog/httpd/php3

Still no results.
But the line

php3_engine		     = off

_does_ work. It turns off php3 very nicely, even on
a per-virtual-host basis.

And if I make a typing error in a php3_ variable,
httpd refuses to start up.

I've read a whole bunch of manuals on the net
and in the distributions I have access to.
But they all say the same thing.
And it _doesn't_ work as advertised.

Someone else _must_ have got this all going.

Could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.
