 &gt; NetWorker is a network backup product from Legato Systems.
 &gt; They have a Linux port for the client.
 &gt; I've contacted both their Sydney and Melbourne offices
 &gt; and no one wants to sell it to me.  The salesperson is
 &gt; "overseas" or "in a meeting" or doing anything rather
 &gt; than tell me how much it is and where to send my cheque.
 &gt; Apparently no one else in the office can take an order.

You order the general legato product, without specifying anything
special about the client type.  They send you a client CD, which 
contains clients for lots of different architectures and operating
systems.  You then go to Legato's ftp site and download the Linux
client;  It'll work as long as you have a server license and 
sufficient numbers of client licenses.

 &gt; PS: I don;t think this is a Linux problem, I suspect it
 &gt;     is a Legato problem and I'd have just as much trouble
 &gt;     buying a WinNT client license.

Probably.  Legato seem to have amazing difficulty with actually 
selling anything.  You don't even want to know the hoops we jumped
through at work when we wanted to upgrade our DEC-OEM'ed VMS Legato
client...
