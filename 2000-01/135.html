Hi,

&gt; Who says the scriptures existed in the first place?  And if they
&gt; definitely did, who said they're right at all?  Who says they weren't
&gt; written by some guy(s) as a joke?

If they are a Joke, then they have a remarkable degree of alternate
historical sources to back them up. For instance, there are Roman records
dating from the time of Jesus, giving some details of this
"troublemaker". There is also archeological evidence for some events. I
prefer to interperete the bible as part historical, part local translation
of events (given for personal and political biases of the author and the
time, and the translator), and part guide on how to live a good
life. (There is a lot of excelent advice given in the Bible.)

The chances are that it is not a joke or a fiction, tho there is much room
for "poetic licence" in it.

Please note that this is opinion, flames should be directed to me off
list.

cya
