I had similar problems when my DNS server was switched off. It kept looking
and looking, but couldn't find it (funny that). I suggest checking there.

Also, the 2.2 Kernel and the stuff you get with 2.2 based dists is a lot
bigger / slower.

There was also this other time when I didn't uninstall LDAP properly it did
the same thing.

&gt; Dear colleagues,
&gt;
&gt; I have had some fun... and some heartache...over the Christmas
&gt; new-year break...  :-)
&gt;
&gt; I have recently installed Mandrake V6.1 to replace an earlier
&gt; installation of Red-Hat V4.5.
&gt;
&gt; The old system was dual boot. It had a 2.1GB HDD partitioned into
&gt; two partitions of approximately 1GB each. The default LILO boot
&gt; option was MS-DOS 6.0  and the other option was Red-Hat LINUX
&gt; V4.5.
&gt;
&gt; The first thing that I noticed is that Mandrake is very hungry for
&gt; resources. The box specs. suggest that I need &gt;= 64MB of RAM
&gt; and &gt;= 1.5 GB of HDD. (My largest partition was only 1.0GB)
&gt;
&gt; I installed an additional 64GB of RAM and I now have 96 MB of
&gt; RAM in the Linux machine.
&gt;
&gt; I installed an 8.4GB IDE HDD as master on port 0 and I moved the
&gt; CD-ROM to the slave on port 0.  My old 2.1GB SCSI drive, with all
&gt; the valuable data from my earlier work, is still installed as a
&gt; mountable drive.
&gt;
&gt; (The machine has an ethernet card but that does not have much to
&gt; talk to at the moment. The Linux host and a Win-98 machine are
&gt; both connected to a 10baseT hub. My plan is to set up a small
&gt; LAN and install SAMBA and allow the sharing of files and data
&gt; between the Win98 and Linux environments. )
&gt;
&gt; First the good news. The automatic installation was fairly easy. But
&gt; wait... There is more good news the systems seems to work quite
&gt; well and I have been able to carry out useful work. There are quite a
&gt; number of interesting applications with Mandarke 6.1 and most of
&gt; them seem to work quite well. I like the graphical environment,
&gt; called KDE.
&gt;
&gt; One other thing that I like is that the printer drivers work better than
&gt; the old Red Hat 4.5 installation. I can print post-script files to my
&gt; antique HP Desk-Jet 500.
&gt;
&gt; Now for the bad news.. The system takes a long... long time to
&gt; boot.. I have not timed it exactly but I would estimate that it takes
&gt; about 5 minutes to get a login prompt and another 15 minutes to
&gt; get the windows manager, KDE, up and running. (Xemacs is also
&gt; very slow to launch.)
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone suggest where I should start investigating to find the
&gt; cause of this slow boot problem.
&gt;
&gt; My suspicions are that the boot problem could be caused by :
&gt;
&gt; 1/ I may have installed software which has no corresponding
&gt; hardware? (The machine paused for a long time while launching
&gt; amd)
&gt;
&gt; 2/ Maybe the system is wasting time time polling the (non-
&gt; existent) network on the other side of the network card..
&gt;
&gt; 3/ The screen blinks and flashes while it boots and I see some
&gt; rather strange (large) fonts flash briefly onto the screen. There may
&gt; be a problem with video modes?
&gt;
&gt; 4/ Maybe the old processor (Pentium 133MHz) is too slow for
&gt; mandrake V6.1
&gt;
&gt; 4/ Any other theories?   :-(
&gt;
&gt; I would welcome any suggestions that the group may have. Given
&gt; that my valuable data is still stored on the SCSI drive I am not
&gt; adverse to a complete re-installation of LINUX  but I would want to
&gt; "get it right" next time. Can anyone advise me?
&gt;
&gt; Regards
