Few days back my sound card was damaged. I replaced it with Yamaha =
Mercury 3000. Now the problem that I am facing presently is that my new =
sound card (PCI sound card) is not recognized by Linux, I have tried the =
sndconfig command and it6 says that a sound card has been detected but =
the vendor is unknown and this sound card is not supported. Whereas my =
previous sound card was also from Yamaha (OPL3SAX, ISA slot) and it =
worked very nicely and without any problems. Will I have to reinstall =
Linux? Besides this their is one another problem in the Windows too. The =
previous sound card I possessed supported multiple instances of sound, =
that is if I was listening to a mp3 at the same time I was able to =
listen to other sounds that were made by minimizing or maximizing of =
windows or any other instances, I was even able to do mixing by starting =
two mp3 players. But it isn't possible now. If I am listening to mp3 or =
wav or midi and simultaneously I want to start another instance of sound =
a message is shown that the sound card is busy. Now please tell me what =
is the actual problem and besides that I will also like to know that =
what type of sound cards are better the ISA one or the PCI one.

Thanks in advance to all those will help me out.

Amit
