Hi all...........
Further to my previous post wherein I mentioned that I am self taught &
dont know everything abt Linux/Unix :) HELP! I changed my network over
to cat5 and a hub, from coax, a while back & left 1 pc on coax (the pc
is out in the garage abt 40 feet from the house) - I have only just got
around to sticking a 2nd network card in 1 of the pc's in my office to
bring the "garage pc" online.... connected everything up, configured the
card..DEAD..not a bloody sausage! All the cards I tried were dual
(ie/bnc & rj45) and it was very obvious that all the data was busily
flowing out the rj45 hole & not out the bnc!! :( 
I got around the problem by sticking in a "bnc only" network card
HOWEVER I would like to know how to re-educate my cards... they USED to
work fine on coax then I played with all of them on cat5....now they
wont do coax any more :( I have read the hardware, ethernet & networking
howto's and apart from 1 brief reference to ether paramaters for a 3c503
there is no mention of how to MAKE the bloody thing send data out the
BNC (NB: No, there are NOT any jumpers to switch).
So, this has obviously happened to someone else ... so please enlighten
and educate me:)
Phil
PS: Alex.... ;-)
