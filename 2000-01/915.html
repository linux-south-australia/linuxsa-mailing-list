A mate of mine has played with a beta version of millenium and then promptly
uninstalled it. It still had a splash screen of Win98.

The main problem was the hardware support was negligible with very little
drivers and the Win98 and NT drivers couldn't be used due a major difference
in the MicroPort driver from MS.

That was of course about 3-5 months ago..

&gt; &gt;   &gt;I think there'll be another DOS based Windows yet. Theres still too
&gt; &gt;many
&gt; &gt;   &gt;legasy programs out there, and light hardware that people will want
&gt; &gt;to use
&gt; &gt;   &gt;the features of Win2K on.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Yes, its called Windows Millenium and its currently in Beta2.
&gt; &gt;(Well they couldn't call it Windows 00 could they :)
&gt;
&gt; I've heard a few people talk about this "Windows Millenium" ... but does
it
&gt; actually exist ???
&gt;
&gt; I've searched throught the entire Microsoft site for any traces of
"Windows
&gt; Millenium" and haven't found a thing as of yet. Any pointes of where to
find
&gt; any info on "Windows Millenium" ???
