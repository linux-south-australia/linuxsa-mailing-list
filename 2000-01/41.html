Hello.

&gt; At 04:54  31/12/1999 +1030, you wrote:
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have a small network connected to the Internet via a Linux box
&gt; &gt; &gt; with IP Masquerading.  I am looking for a good Windows-based client
&gt; &gt; &gt; that will allow the connection to come up when I need it.

Hmmmm

&gt; A friend of mine wrote a little cgi script that was accessible
&gt; through any web browser - you need to have apache configured and able to
be
&gt; reached regardless of whether you're connected to the 'net or not, but it
&gt; works a charm.

Ie - an intranet situation is perfect.

&gt; One thing that you do have to be careful of in it's current form is that
&gt; you don't "enable" the interface twice or you won't be able to
&gt; disconnect....

If you "connect" twice, you have to "disconnect" twice.  Fix that if you
want.
Otherwise just be careful *grin*.  The problem is that the program doesn't
check to see if the link is already up

&gt; Not a major drama though, but Nick, if you're listening (reading), could
be
&gt; something worthwhile looking into *grin* - perhaps I should do it myself
as
&gt; well...

It was written very quickly and for a simple and specific purpose.  It's
easily configurable and works.  If you would like to try it, please feel
free!
Can I get you to put it on a server Kirsty?  How about
<A HREF="http://www.fully.cx/files/linkman-x.x.x.tar.gz">http://www.fully.cx/files/linkman-x.x.x.tar.gz</A> or something ;)

&gt; I'll ask my friend Nick if he minds me making it publicly available and
get
&gt; back to you...

Go nuts :)  Just keep my name in it somewhere ;)

Happy New Year everyone!!  I'll stay out of the millenium discussion for
now..  *grin*

Bye!

Nick.
