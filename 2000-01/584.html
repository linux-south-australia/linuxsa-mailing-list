&gt; me... My other problem is random, unpredictable, unrepeatable crashes on

You dont mention what version of NETSCRAPE you are running???? presume
4.61 or better, just reinstall the netscape-4.61.rpm (or whatever) with
--force to make it over write the existing one ** or you could be neat &
remove the old one first ;) *** your prefs cache etc should be retained.

(Something to think abt...netscrape was a windows product b4 it was
linux ;))) therefore if it misbehaves, treat it accordingly :) 
&gt; TIA

&gt; PS This is one of the major issues that forces me and many others to
&gt; keep one foot in the Windows camp -- IE5 is brilliant (though still not
&gt; perfect) when seen in the same room as netscape... If anyone has coding
&gt; skill, and copious quantities of free time, get involved in a Browser --
&gt; Mozilla, Konquerer, etc etc etc... Just anything to improve the Netscape
&gt; situation.

I have NEVER had any major issues with NETSCRAPE ever... not on win311,
win95, win98 or any distro of linux!! It generally performs faultlessly
(sometimes a tad slow tho!) HOWEVER, I run IE5 on a win98 box - it is a
piece of s**t - falls over, locks up does stupid stuff I dont want it to
do... so .... I think that ultimately the adage of "...your mileage may
vary" is probably relevant! ;)

I use MOZILLA & NETSCAPE on my FBSD box... interesting/ugly but seems to
work fine.
