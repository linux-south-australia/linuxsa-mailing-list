&gt; &gt; &gt; I think HTML is the way to go, or maybe RTF.  PDF really annoys me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Recently I had to uninstall Acrobat Reader 4 and then install
&gt; &gt; &gt; Acrobat Reader 3 since the PDF file had a password/encryption method
&gt; &gt; &gt; that was only supported by version 3. (this was on my windows
&gt; &gt; &gt; machine though). I also think that Acrobat is hard to read on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; screen. Maybe plain text is the way to go so nobody can complain.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't recal a recent distribution of linux that _doesn't_ come with
&gt; &gt; a .pdf viewer of some description?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; But XPDF doesn't support encrypted pdf. So you need to then go and get
&gt; version 3 pf acrobat reader......
Yes, it does.
It just doesn't ship with it because of the various stupid crypto laws.
Read the xpdf homepage for more info.

&gt; I agree, PDF is a pain. I like text myself. ;-). Although latex looks as
&gt; though it would be very easily converted to other formats.
