Brian,

&gt;&gt;I was just wondering why you assumed that David's comments were
&gt;&gt;directed at you personally?
&gt;
&gt; He responded to my quoted post.  Seemed clear enough to me.

Indeed I did quote your post, but please don't misunderstand me.  By no
means was I calling you lazy or stupid, and in fact if you examine those
words of yours which I quoted you will see that my point was in relation to
your claim that unix is difficult to learn.  I apologise if you felt I was
sluring your intellect or work-ethics.

Since it's apparent that you misunderstood the jist of my message I had
better clarify: I reject that unix is hard to learn.  It is as easy to
learn as any operating system that I know.  It has to it's advantage an
easily available, diverse range of quality documentation, and in fact this
makes it easier to learn than many alternatives.

I made a secondary point, namely that the documentation is far too often
left unused.  I described the refusal to even try the documentation as lazy
or stupid.  As an educator, how would you describe a student who expressed
difficulty despite failing to read the texts?  Presumably you would find it
in your heart to use less endearing terms than "gifted" and "dedicated".


&gt; the LEAST qualification needed for [the position of Visiting Research
&gt; Fellow] is PhD (with all the previous study that qualification implies,
&gt; especially in Education).

I understand the obvious pride that you take in your achievement.  Careful
lest you ride the slippery slide of intellectual snobbery.  Not everyone
can sustain the effort of gaining a PhD, just as not everyone with a PhD
can sustain the effort of learning to use unix.  Capisce?

Curiously you need no PhD to be eligible to be a professor at Flinders
University.  Those who care will find the requirement is a distinguished
career in research and industry.  (The least educated amongst us can have
that.)

Regards,

David
