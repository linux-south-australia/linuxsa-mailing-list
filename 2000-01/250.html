&gt; &gt; Go to <A HREF="http://www.grc.com">http://www.grc.com</A> and have it test your system!
&gt;
&gt; It's an amusing little set of tests.
&gt; There are two sets of tests:
&gt; "Shield" tests -- which seem to be very specific
&gt; to windows OS, and
&gt;
&gt; Port tests -- which tell you the completely obvious.
&gt;
&gt; But it's clearly just a promotional thing.
&gt; The language is designed to scare windows users.
&gt;
&gt; When you pass a test, it says that you shouldn't
&gt; be complacent -- and presumably you should buy
&gt; theri product anyway. If it finds that a port is
&gt; open (e.g. 80 for HTTP), it says that this is
&gt; a serious vulnerability as hackers can you attack
&gt; you at this point.
&gt;
&gt; It just has a look at ports 21, 25, 79, 80,
&gt; 110, 143 adn that sort of stuff.
&gt;
&gt; If you've got linux, this set of tests
&gt; is a big yawn.
&gt;
&gt; Cheerio,

I was told to watch out for the known exploits for personal web server and
frontpage extensions. It's a good job the proxy server it scanned was running
Apache ;-). nmap (by Fyodor?) is still one of the best port scanners in
existence.

I used to frequent a number of 31337 HaCkA SiTeZ (Elite Hacker Sites :)) that
were really good for security stuff. Rootshell was one, but now they mainly
point out Windows NT problems (like there are many of THOSE ;-)). Phrack
Magazine was also quite good, but now sucks a little. Does anyone know of any
reasonable places to keep up to date with security issues? I have tried
places like CERT in the past, but they really do suck. It's very Microsoft,
in that they tell you that there is a problem, but don't explain the problem
(I like to understand what's going on).

Thanks,

Matt
