Even though I kind of agree with you....

Some people just dont have the time to do such a thing as work out a whole
OS from scratch by themselfs.

A 2 day course, i imagine, is about equal to 1 week of blundering around in
an OS and learing by mistakes which could end up being costly.

&gt; This is no flame, although I realise many of you will choose to interpet
&gt; it as one.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; In an effort to gain something positive from an unfortunate beginning,
may
&gt; &gt; I suggest that Paul is expressing frustration that GNU/Linux is very
&gt; &gt; difficult for the neophyte to get to know, and that the beginner level
of
&gt; &gt; help is quite hard to find.
&gt;
&gt; I completely disagree.  I'm tired of people whinging about how difficult
&gt; unix is, and how expensive the training is, and how hard it is to find
good
&gt; help.  Damn it, help is not hard to find.  It's right there under
&gt; everyones' noses.  The source is freely available, as are man pages,
howtos
&gt; and info.  If that's not enough then perhaps the problem is stupidity, or
&gt; rank laziness.  Often it's the latter.  Unix is easy.  I learned it by
&gt; reading the manual and tickling the ivories.  I'm talented, but no genius;
&gt; it would have been easier with the source.  I had lesser resources than
are
&gt; now widely available and since I taught myself, so anyone else can do the
&gt; same.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps "beginner level of help is quite hard to find" because many
&gt; beginners refuse to help themselves.  Faced with the arrogance of a
demand
&gt; for an instant answer, or even abuse when pointing out the option of a
&gt; commercial course, it's not surprising that many people sit quietly back
&gt; and don't waste their time even trying.  Most questions asked here are
&gt; widely covered in available literature.  You'd think search engines were
&gt; novel.  How do you remove the file -f?  rm ./-f.  How do you remove the
&gt; file -f? rm ./-f.  How do you remove the file -f?  FOAD you stupid,
&gt; snivelling fool.  Well I feel sympathy, understand the frustration, that
&gt; evokes such an answer.
&gt;
&gt; It's lovely that so many of us freely give of our time.  It's hateful that
&gt; so many of us are flamed for giving the best of answers: Read, young
thing,
&gt; and you will learn.  Anybody who won't teach themself -- and it's not
&gt; can't, it's not too busy, it's not too difficult, it's simply willfully
&gt; won't -- should pay Richard, or any of the many other fine trainers.  Just
&gt; do it quietly; and stop whinging.
&gt;
&gt; Boy that sounded like a flame.  It wasn't.
