Paul,
  Very nice of you to volunteer to organize such a coarse.  I didn't think
that user groups were to use as a "soap box" either.  By all means
promote yourself as a wonderful person who will organize courses but why
degrade your standing by bagging someone else?

        Regards Steven Ellison

&gt; May I just enquire something here?  I &gt;&gt;THOUGHT&lt;&lt;  LinuxSA, is a USER group.
&gt; My recollection of USER groups is to assist one another in the special
&gt; interest that we each have, in this case, Linux.  So...  I thinks to mesself
&gt; as I do, why don't we run our own NON-PROFIT course for our "members"?  This

[rest of rant deleted]

&gt; 
&gt; There, I've finally said it.
&gt; 
&gt; Even so, best reagrds to the Linux community,
