 &gt; O knowledgeable one about censorship

 &gt; clients hanging off that connection?
 &gt; Would such a person be an ISP,

No, you're not providing Internet access to anyone, so how could you
be an ISP?

 &gt; because they
 &gt; are a content server (de facto, even though
 &gt; it's not a business activity, just a
 &gt; sharing of files among peers)

That's a different ballgame:  You'd be an Internet Content Host (ICH),
which is covered by the legislation.  You'd need to abide by the 
ICH portions of the IIA Code of Conduct, and respond to ABA take-down
orders which may be delivered in the event that someone complains
about content on your site, and the complaint is upheld by an R-or-higher
ruling from the OFLC.

 &gt; and are connected
 &gt; directly to the wide open Internet; or would
 &gt; they be an ISP customer, because they are
 &gt; using the connectivity granted to them by Telstra?

The source of your connectivity, or its nature as a permanent link,
matters naught.

 &gt; If the latter, then presumably
 &gt; Telstra would have to provide them with nanny
 &gt; software so that they don't see any nude women
 &gt; accidentally.

Unless you say you already have it.  Also, Telstra can bill you for it.
So, if asked, nod and say, "I'm using an ABA-approved Alternative
Access Prevention Device," and end the conversation.  If you say you don't
have filters, Telstra will probably need to supply them to you, *at your
cost*, whether you end up using them or not (indeed, whether they're 
actually capable of running on your computer or not!)

If you use an ISP which provides them for "free", they aren't really
free, the cost is just distributed over the entire subscriber base, 
whether or not censorware is actually delivered to the entire subscriber
base.

The end result of the BSA is that Australian Internet users will be
paying a mandatory Government-directed subsidy to US censorware
corporations to help them push their Religious Reich political agenda.
