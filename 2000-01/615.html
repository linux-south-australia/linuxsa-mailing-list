&gt; the two biggest issues for us with AOL^H^H^H Netscape are java and fonts.
&gt; 
&gt; 4.51 cures the java problems. Netscape uses it's own java, not anything you
&gt; may have unstalled on your system like kaffe (uuurgh)

well I have Sun/Blackdown 1.2 on my system, and I'd really rather use
that than Netscape's Java (uuurgh), due to the stability (not perfect,
but better than Netscape) and up-to-dateness of it. Netscape's Java has
little going for it IMHO -- all I've seen it do is run slowly and crash
Netscape. At least the Sun/Blackdown 1.2 JDK seems stable on its own...
(Of course, I have no idea if Netscape's Java problems are caused by the
Java implementation they use or by the way they integrate it with the
browser itself, but either way, it blows...) If I could be bothered
(which I can't) I'd see if it was possible to replace the Netscape Java
with the Sun/Blackdown Java, and see if that improved java stuff at
all...

&gt; 
&gt; the fonts issue actually causes a surprising number of hangs and crashes
&gt; and can be fixed by using xfstt (or a look alike)

hmmm... how would I know if it's fonts that are causing crashes (I'm
guessing that mine aren't font-related, as some sites works sometimes,
and not others... although the displaying nothing problem could
conceivably be a font problem...)

Thanks

 I guess the hard thing for a lot of people to accept
   is why God would allow me to go running through
