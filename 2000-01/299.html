Firstly, I can SEE ( via the binary ocular input sensors to my
biological CPU), that this ISN'T a Linux issue.  So I says to myself as
I usually do; so what.  Now here's my two cents worth.

Suppose, just suppose for a moment that you were a Roman soldier in them
there times, posted to the ends of the earth for a tour of duty.  You
may well be away from your family and loved ones, just as our people in
East Timor are today, and you may well be "stuck" there for even years,
which was fairly typical.  So it was most probable that the soldiers of
the day (this also happened in Vietnam) took on local girlfriends as
they weren't ACTUALLY at war with the local populations in most cases.
So let's suppose for a moment that our brave legionaire (probably
conscripted..) had an affair with a local lass of hebrew origin..  I
HAVEN"T mentioned any names just yet.

Now, for those of you somewhat unfamiliar with customs of the time, it
was quite a bad thing for a hebrew girl to fall pregnant - to ANYBODY,
let alone an occupational force legionaire.  Since at that time there
was still a fair amount of OTHER religions about (the Romans were in
fact very tolerant of all religions, unlike most groups of today), this
gave rise to an opportunity to explain away these undesired pregnancies,
like.. the gods did it, it was a fertility rite at the House of Diana,
it was a grape festival event and Pan did it, et al.  Being mostly
simple folk, these sort of explanations were quite plausible and
generally acceptable.

SO...., one just might find any number of excuses floating about, even
possibly the one of "immaculate conception", and a Hebrew girl couldn't
exactly use Pan or Diana as an excuse now could she?  Why not?

Now, before all you (Catholics in particular) start screaming, I din't
mention any names.  You  may draw your own conclusions, as you are free
to do, just as I am free to say what I say.

Nor does this imply by any means whatsoever, or provide by innuendo,
suggestion, belief or tenet, that I either believe or disbelieve in
certain theosophical issues and credences. I would just like to say that
I am open minded enough to consider other options.

Thankyou.

PaulK.
