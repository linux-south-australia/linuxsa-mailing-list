just a note - I also use TPG and about to try and connect a linux box. When
I contacted TPG they assured me that the settings of linux (i.e. ip address
etc) would all be the same as for windows i.e. ppp. However they also
stressed that they do not give support for linux connections.

&gt; Hi Nathan.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;              is there anyone else out there who uses TPG as their ISP.
&gt; &gt;I am trying to get the internet working but each time I dial up, the
&gt; &gt;connection tones complete and then the connection is severed about 10
&gt; &gt;seconds later. Is TPG detecting this as a Unix/Linux connection and
&gt; &gt;refusing it? (This question because I am not sure if TPG allows a shell
&gt; &gt;type access)
&gt;
&gt; I've just been browsing the TPG web pages and they don't specify any
&gt; help for a Linux connection that I can see. This doesn't mean you
&gt; won't be able to connect using Linux though.
&gt;
&gt; I'd be willing to bet that they don't offer shell accounts.
&gt;
&gt; I reckon the type of account you're looking at setting up will be a
&gt; PAP type PPP account.  I think the netcfg program you have already
&gt; used will let you setup one of these.
&gt;
&gt; The /var/log/messages file on your machine will probably give you some
&gt; idea about what was happening when you tried to connect.
