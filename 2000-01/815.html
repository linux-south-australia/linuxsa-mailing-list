I think it all depends on your company.  Where I work we sell primarily
microsoft, but we often sell machines with no OS, and will install our
copy
of windows in the service department on anyones machine who can produce
a PID
number.  We sell other OSs as well, on request. I have installed OS/2 on
request and
If anyone wanted linux we would do that as well (althugh unfortunatly it
hasnt happened yet. 
One of our larger customers often purches machines with no os, and i
know for a fact that most of those get linux :)

&gt; On this topic, a couple of months ago,
&gt; I bought a laptop, and was handed over a copy of
&gt; windows 95, which I said I didn't need.
&gt; It was also installed on this second-hand laptop
&gt; already.
&gt; They guy told me he had to give me an OS,
&gt; because otherwise he would get a $40,000 fine or
&gt; something.
&gt; He said I could come in and spend 3 hours installing
&gt; linux in his shop if I liked.
&gt; But he said that there was a presumption that
&gt; anyone who did not have a copy of an MS OS
&gt; certificate was going to use a pirate copy of
&gt; an MS OS.
&gt; 
&gt; I.e. there is a presumption of intent to steal, if you
&gt; don't buy an MS OS certificate.
&gt; So now I have a daggy old $50 wind95 OS
&gt; in an unopened packet at home, and MS has $50.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite Geoffrey's world-famous pioneering
&gt; tour de force (which filled up space
&gt; in newspapers which politicians would die for),
&gt; the practice is still that
&gt; computer vendors, even second-hand,
&gt; are intimidated by a kind of
&gt; mafia-like operation into hadning over money
&gt; for stuff that people don't want.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a bit like having to hand over money for
&gt; a crate of Coke every time you ahve a party,
&gt; because you need to have some
&gt; fizzy drink in the summer, and Coke is the dominant
&gt; vendor, and if you don't buy any, then
&gt; it is presumed that you will steal some Coke from
&gt; somewhere for your party.
&gt;
