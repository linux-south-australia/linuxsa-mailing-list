&gt;I think the original scriptures never said she was a virgin.  The word that
&gt;was used translates just as well as unmarried woman. 

Close, ... the original scriptural reference is from Isiah, and, AFAIK, it
is more correctly translated to young woman, who I admit, was probably
unmarried as well :-)

&gt;                                                      The church apparently
&gt;decided that being unmarried wasn't special enough and they instigated the
&gt;(incorrect) interpretation of virgin.

This is a little wider of the mark.  I am lead to believe that the error
crept into the Septuagint when a Greek translation was being made of the
OT.  The Greeks already had a whole virgin thing going with Diana, so it
resonated very well, it seems.

The gospel of Mark picked up the mistranslation, and Matthew and Luke
copied the mistake from Mark, and thus we have the legend as it stands today.

The church fathers simply went along with the material they already had,
and you must admit that given the time, the mythos was powerful.
