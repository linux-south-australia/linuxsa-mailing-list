Hi guys,

For those that cared about the reply I got from DRT. Here's my reply.

&gt;&gt;· MacOS version 8.0
&gt;&gt;· Unix/Linux (All versions that support the Java Virtual Machine).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Internet Registration Renewal web pages were developed as part of a
&gt;&gt;pilot project to test web technology and user acceptance of this type of
&gt;&gt;facility. Being a learning experience for 
&gt;&gt;Transport SA it was considered unfeasible to commit additional taxpayer
&gt;&gt;funds to  test all operating and browser systems. The abovementioned systems
&gt;&gt;have been tested and are supported.
&gt;
&gt;Linux is a free operating system that will run quite happily on any
machine that you have Windows on. It is also mostly posix compliant, which
means that most other flavours of Unix will work if Linux does. Netscape
runs on Linux as do a number of browsers written in Java (which could have
been tested on a Windows box).
&gt;
&gt;I can understand not being able to test MacOS, but given the cost involved
(a small amount of someone's time), I cannot see the reason why Unix isn't
supported. You can also get (for around $20 and non-commercial use) SCO
Unix and Solaris. I believe that for testing your web site, you aren't
using it for commercial purposes.
&gt;
&gt;You could also look to the Internet for help. In the spirit of open
source, I believe many people would quite happily test your system with
whichever systems they were running. This is also free.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;This is not to say users of other operating systems such as Unix, Linux,
&gt;&gt;etc. cannot access the site, more a case however that Transport SA has not
&gt;&gt;tested and therefore cannot support these systems at this time.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;When I visited your site with my Java-enabled Netscape Communicator 4.61
on Linux, I was told that I should enable Java. I know there are problems
with the Java Virtual Machines of both Netscape and Internet Explorer, but
these problems usually just cause the browser to dump core.
&gt;Thank you,
&gt;
