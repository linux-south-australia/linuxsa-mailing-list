Happy new millenium - the end of the would UTC/GMT is fast approaching !!!!

Doh !!! This argument is getting boring.....

It's a very simple concept, and is not dependent on a year zero.  When you
were born you began living in the first year of your life, in your first
decade, in your first century, etc.....  When you reached your first
aniversary you were 1 year old - then straight away you began living in your
2nd year, etc...

Thus, on 01/01/1999 we started to live in the 2,000 year (forgetting any
additions/subtractions from the calendar in previous times) the final year
of the 20th century and the 2nd millenium.  At 01/01/2000 and one second we
began to live in the 2,001 year and thus the first year of the 3rd millenium
and the first year of the 21st century.

&gt; On January 1, 1900, "The Advertiser" said that the very sound of 1900
&gt; indicated that we were drawing to the end of the 19th century, or words to
&gt; that effect.  Without doubt they were saying that 1900 was not in the
&gt; twentieth century.  How are they going to explain that the twentieth
&gt; century was thus only 99 years long?
&gt;
&gt; Hold up your hands, fingers out, and ask a five year old child to count to
&gt; ten.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ...  Stop!
Ten
&gt; is the first number in the *second* ten.  The first ten only has nine
&gt; numbers.
&gt;
&gt; Our calendar was meant to be written using Roman numbers.  Write down the
&gt; Roman number for zero.  Oh dear.  Better make our calendar start at year
1.
&gt; Apparently we have only 999 years in the first millenium?  Or does the
&gt; third millenium start in the year 2999?
