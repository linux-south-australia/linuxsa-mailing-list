&gt; Is this documented anywhere? I looked in 'man X' and saw nothing
&gt; relating to the -query option...

What does `X --help` say?

&gt; although I did try running it on my local machine to see what would
&gt; happen... I went to the virtual terminal on C-A-F1, and typed "X
&gt; -query dagar :1", and it brought up an X Server on vterm 8 (there's
&gt; already one running on 7). However, all I got was the stipple
&gt; pattern and an X Mouse icon -- no wm, etc..

Are you running xdm on your machine? It contacts xdm and give you a
login box.

&gt; I can still use the X on 7, but can't do anything on 8... Did I
&gt; misunderstand what you meant, or am I supposed to be able to get
&gt; access to my running desktop from another machine?

Not actually running, as in one that is already running under a
standard execution of X. You can just fire up your window manager and
you won't be able to tell that you're not on the machine console.

&gt; This seems unlikely to me, but then, I've been surprised by X before
&gt; (positively, and negatively)... Maybe it's not working because I am
&gt; on the one machine...

Probably not running xdm.

&gt; ooh ooh -- just got an error message... 
&gt; 
&gt; XDM: too many retransmissions

There you go!

&gt; I normally use gdm... hmmm -- I think this may have something to do
&gt; with either xdm/gdm or doing it all on the one machine...

try xdm.

&gt; any explanations?

I should read these messages before hitting reply so I don't repeat
myself!

Cheers

Alex!
