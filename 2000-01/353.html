&gt; The problem I have encountered is that I am unable to get the sound working
&gt; when I am running on the Linux operating system (it works fine when runningwin98).
&gt;  As instructed in the booklet I have enabled sound as one of the services that
&gt; starts up when Linux boots. The sound card that is installed in my PC is Sound
&gt; Blaster16.
&gt; 

I also purchased the pocketbook and had the same problem with RH 6.0.  My
sound card was too a SoundBlaster 16... sndconfig wouldn't detect it with
the settings (IRQs and the such) I had gleaned from win95, but after some
fiddling (guessing) with the settings, things seemed to be right.
However, the modules would not load at boot time, probably due to the
kernel not supporting sound.

With RH 6.1, sndoncifg detected my card perfectly, and the sound and midi
modules booted without fail.  If all else fails in your attempt to
configure sound, maybe you should try upgrading to the newer redhat
default kernel or sndconfig.


&gt; &lt;snip question about shutdown&gt;

Halt is the linux eqiuvalent of the windows shutdown.  You can halt your
system either from the graphical login screen, or the command line, with
the cammands of either 'shutdown -h now' or simply 'halt'  These require
your password to perform.

Cheers

Tim
