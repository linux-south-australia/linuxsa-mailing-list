&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to find out how much interest there would be in running a
&gt; couple of Samba courses here in Adelaide.
&gt; 
&gt; Having been involved in writing two Samba books (and finding it possible to
&gt; write some 400 pages in this last book :-), I think I am well qualified to
&gt; give such courses.  I am also giving a Samba tutorial in Singapore in
&gt; March, and have given one in Sydney last July at SAGE-AU.
&gt; 
&gt; I propose, if there is sufficient interest, running one or both of the
&gt; following here in Adelaide some time in Feb or Mar, or at any other time
&gt; there is interest.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. An introduction to Samba.  See below for outline.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Samba, a more advanced course.  See below for outline.
&gt; 
&gt; I would organize a venue, provide a PC per delegate, as well as other
&gt; amenities for the day.  I would also provide course notes.
&gt; 
&gt; IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST, PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL AND TELL ME WHICH
&gt; COURSE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN.  I will summarize after a few days.
&gt; 
&gt; OUTLINES
&gt; 
&gt; 1. An introduction to Samba.
&gt; 
&gt; In this one-day course, we will provide an intermediate-level introduction
&gt; to Samba.  It is designed to bring you up to speed with Samba quickly, so
&gt; you can be more productive in building Samba servers and know a lot more
&gt; about what you are doing.
&gt; 
&gt; We assume that delegates have some experience with Linux and Win9x and WinNT.
&gt; 
&gt; The course will use a combined lecture and hands-on format, with
&gt; approximately half your time being spent in hands-on activities.
&gt; 
&gt; We will divide the day up into four segments:
&gt; 
&gt; a. An introduction to Samba and the functions of an SMB server.  
&gt;  
&gt;    Here, we will explain what an SMB server does, how Windows clients and 
&gt;    Samba use TCP/IP to establish communication between each other, and what
&gt;    shares are, how you use them, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; b. How Samba provides security and how it provides access to shares.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here, we will explain what is perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of
&gt;    Samba.  You will come away knowing how Samba mediates access to files for
&gt;    users and how to provide access and restrict access.  We will also 
&gt;    explain the use of encrypted passwords
&gt; 
&gt; c. Advanced topics in share access. 
&gt; 
&gt;    Here we will look at advanced topics, like providing guest access, 
&gt;    running scripts when people access a share, using Macros in your
&gt;    smb.conf file, and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; d. Troubleshooting Samba problems.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here we will look at an approach to troubleshooting problems with Samba
&gt;    and look at common problems that occur in Samba.  We will ground it in 
&gt;    an overview of the SMB protocol and look at packet traces as a way to 
&gt;    perform some types of troubleshooting.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Samba, a more advanced course.
&gt; 
&gt; In this one-day course we will look at using Samba in ever more complex
&gt; environments. 
&gt; 
&gt; We assume that delegates have installed Samba before and have set up a
&gt; share for a few users.
&gt; 
&gt; The course will use a combines lecture and hands-on with about half your
&gt; time being spent in hands-on activities.
&gt; 
&gt; We will take an advanced view and illustrate the SMB protocol by looking at
&gt; packet traces with Ethereal.  Our focus will be to provide delegates with
&gt; enough information that they can resolve problems for themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; We will split the day into four segments.  These segments will deal with:
&gt; 
&gt; a. Setting up Samba as a logon server for Win9X clients and dynamically 
&gt;    generating logon scripts.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here, we will look at the Win9X logon process and contrast it with a 
&gt;    Win NT logon process.  We will explore what configuration is needed to
&gt;    support Win9X logons, and how to dynamically generate logon scripts.
&gt; 
&gt; b. Setting up virtual servers under Samba and using Samba as a profiles
&gt; server, 
&gt;    including roaming profiles for Win9X.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here we will look at how to set up Samba virtual servers, and why you might
&gt;    use them.  We will show how you can keep your profiles in a sub-directory
&gt;    the home directory, and will look at policies.
&gt; 
&gt; c. Troubleshooting Samba problems, and setting up Samba for browsing.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here we will examine browsing in some detail and look at how you can set 
&gt;    up Samba to do cross subnet browsing, and how to debug browsing problems.
&gt; 
&gt;    We will also look at a troubleshooting approach and look at many of the 
&gt;    common problems, and how you can simulate them, so you can recognize
&gt;    them.
&gt; 
&gt; d. Setting up Samba as a domain controller using Samba TNG and serving
&gt; Windows 
&gt;    NT and 2000 clients.
&gt; 
&gt;    Here, we will set up Samba TNG and then use it to set up a domain with 
&gt;    Samba as a PDC, Samba as a BDC, with NT and Win2000 clients.
