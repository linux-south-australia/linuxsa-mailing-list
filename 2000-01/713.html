Since you decided to malign me publically, you deserve all the flamage you

&gt;Yes, that's all very nice for those of you to whom money is no object, but
why
&gt;are you advertising, and at the same time trying your damndest to justify the
&gt;cost, on a USER group mailing, when it it obvious that you have no intention
&gt;of helping those in this user group?  Your fees are obviously "proffessional"
&gt;but your approach is not.

I think you just blew your credibility.  Others have jumped to my defence,
and I can assure you that I spend hours each week answering questions on
this list and other lists and newsgroups.  I can assure you that I am a
contributor. I have been a contributor on and off since 1986 or there
abouts.  You only have to look at my sig to get an idea.

&gt;SO, I throw down the gauntlet.  Make it available, by other means if
&gt;neccessary, to us mere mortals, or get off the mailing list.  I will go so
far
&gt;as to say those of you out there who ARE interested in learning about Linux
&gt;(but don't have the means to pay for a "proffessional" course - (you could go
&gt;and do a MSCE for about the same.. and have a "guaranteed" job at the end of
&gt;it!!)) 

Well then, if you can do an MCSE with a job guarantee for either of the
prices that my course run for, then please feel free.

&gt;Let me know directly and if I get enough interest I will investigate
&gt;further to see what resources I can pull together to make our OWN course
&gt;happen.  However, I can only do this in Adelaide, so I apologise to people
&gt;from elsewhere for missing out.
&gt;
&gt;I BET we, as a group, could run a course too.  The User group meetings are a
&gt;great way to get info and see how things work, but a "course" would cover the
&gt;required topics in an ordelerly manner to ensure nothing was missed and of
&gt;course would do it in a shorter time frame.  The user groups meetings are but
&gt;once a month which means it would take a year or so to cover the "basics".
&gt;(I'M  &gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt; bagging the user group meetings at all, just suggesting there
&gt;may be another way to do this.)
&gt;
&gt;I have already mapped out a multi-stage course for Linux training, as I have
&gt;had this in mind for quite a while.  I am sickened by the few people on here
&gt;who think they are just so o o oo  good and therefore expect the rest of
us to
&gt;pay up or shutup because THEY are PROFESSIONALS.  I say Bah, Phooey to  you.
&gt;Get off your high horses and come down to user group (human being) level.

1.  I do attend user group meeting and talk about various things.

2.  I had a course outline 12 months ago, and since that time I have 
    spent 300 hours putting my course together.  This was unfunded time.

    Since developing the course, I have given the course a number of
    times, but I still have not had my original investment paid back.

    I have also purchased 8 modems and 4 phone elimination devices so
    that we can do modem-based networking on the course.  I have still
    not been paid back for these.

    How do you propose to recompense me for all that, or do you think that 
    it is my bad luck and you will rip me off at your leisure?

3.  I don't think you have any understanding of how to put a course
    together that would have any pedagogoc value for people on the 
    LinuxSA mailing list. Having an outline is one percent of the
    effort.

    Mr Crawford suggested bringing his own hardware along and that 
    others should do the same.

    In my experience, this is the worst thing you could do, as the 
    instructor(s) would spend so much time resolving everyone's 
    hardware problems, any pedagogic value in the course would be
    lost.

4.  I expect to be paid for my time an effort. Don't you? I have a
    wife and two children to clothe and feed and educate.  But still
    I manage to donate time!

&gt;There, I've finally said it.

It wasn't worth waiting for :-)
