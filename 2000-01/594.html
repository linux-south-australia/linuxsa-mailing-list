i'm pretty comfortable with what he's trying to do here. He will have a
natural concern that real time means real time.

the g++ compiler comes ready shipped as part of the gnu c packaging on all
distros, there will be minor tweaks, He needs to get an IDE style interface
one like Code Crusader (www.bochs.edu) is excellent. That will give him
some closeness to his borland ide.

as for the matter of serial programming, he will have to come to terms with
the fact that directly attacking hardware ports, particularly serial, is
objectionable. You or he have to read 'serial programming howto', and to
save you both some time, you need to select 'non-canonical mode'

the abstract serial interface represented by the file inodes in Linux is
more than speedy enough. he does not need to attack the registers.

however if he's uncomfortable at this higher level, then he can use the
examples from setserial.c present in all kernel distros as a means of
changing his real time code. It is not that difficult, his application is
very common on linux style embedded systems. So much so, that I think he
will come to appreciate linux's closeness to dos in that regard, rather
than the windoze style gui's and api, which would be his only other choice.
