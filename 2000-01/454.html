&gt; What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?  PDF?  HTML?
&gt; TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(

how about ascii text, you can even do diagrams with |=+/-\ (you get the idea)
chars.

RTF is OK, but can you include picturey things? I like include diagrams - it
means I can write less.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I like the idea of DVI or PDF - but everyone uses Word!  And Word can't
&gt; save as DVI or PDF!  As the techie at a govt dept - how can I help?
&gt; *grin*
&gt;
&gt; Remembering that MS Office is the 'standard' wordprocessing software..
&gt;
&gt; Maybe somebody should write a user friendly program that converts DOC to
&gt; a nice standard?

I thought there was one. There are some for Windows which I'm sure wine could
cope with. Although, Word documents are notoriously hard to convert (that's
the complaint I'm forever hearing about Star Office).

It might not be as bad if we get Word Perfect Office 2000 for free. ;-)


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; MS has forced a "standard", and that's what they always do, and that
&gt; cheeses me off.
&gt;
&gt; How can we fix it?  I'm sure there are enough influential people on the
&gt; list for us to actually start making some changes around here :)

&gt;
&gt; Another point - MS Office 2000.  This is scarey to me.  It's defining new
&gt; standards everywhere.  Their Intranet package - which you're supposed to
&gt; be able to quickly and easily set up a corporate Intranet.. "In Under 60
&gt; Minutes"  ("while I was at lunch the tech guys set up the intranet")  BAH!
&gt; This is both frustrating and a bit scarey..   BUT it doesn't work at "full
&gt; capacity" unless /everything/ is windows 2000 and office 2000.  The server
&gt; has to be running 2000, the clients have to be running 2000 and IE5.

I tried installing some MS "extensions" for Apache once, for our web guy. It
replaced the httpd executable with one that was twice the size and wouldn't
start. The idea of Windows 2000 on one machine frightens me, let alone many.
Please note that this is not an MS-Hate thing. I've run Windows 2000 on a
Pentium PRO 200 with 64Mb of RAM and nothing else and it sucked (all of my
resources). Maybe they'll one day go back to the time when the GUI was
*optional* on a server.


&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The "if it's not all Microsoft, it won't work as well" mentality is coming
&gt; heavily into play..
&gt;

Might be a bad thing for them. I think the whole world is getting a little
pissed.

Matt

P.S. maybe we could hack up word compatability for vi.
