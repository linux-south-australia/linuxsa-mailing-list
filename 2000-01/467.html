&gt; &gt; What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?  PDF?  HTML?
&gt; &gt; TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(
&gt;
&gt; how about ascii text, you can even do diagrams with |=+/-\ (you
&gt; get the idea) chars.
&gt;
&gt; RTF is OK, but can you include picturey things? I like include
&gt; diagrams - it means I can write less.

Sounds beautiful - but remember we're talking about average joes who are
trained in using Microsoft Word.  They're not going to like having to save
documents as Plain Text or RTF, which can both lose either all or some
formatting properties.

Not that that should be a huge issue..

But imagine trying to tell a manager that we've decided to change to plain
text for saving standard documents..

Something which doesn't help matters is a software package broadly used
in govt departments called Quality Workbench - it's basically a package
designed to make maintaining policy documents, position descriptions, etc
etc easy and controlled.

It uses its OWN copy of Microsoft Word v6.0 to store documents in its
database.

Not Good.

&gt; &gt; I like the idea of DVI or PDF - but everyone uses Word!  And Word can't
&gt; &gt; save as DVI or PDF!  As the techie at a govt dept - how can I help?
&gt; &gt; *grin*
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Remembering that MS Office is the 'standard' wordprocessing software..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Maybe somebody should write a user friendly program that converts DOC to
&gt; &gt; a nice standard?
&gt;
&gt; I thought there was one. There are some for Windows which I'm
&gt; sure wine could cope with. Although, Word documents are notoriously hard
&gt; to convert (that's the complaint I'm forever hearing about Star Office).
&gt;
&gt; It might not be as bad if we get Word Perfect Office 2000 for free. ;-)

Ahh true...  lol  Wishful thinking I think...

&gt; &gt; MS has forced a "standard", and that's what they always do, and that
&gt; &gt; cheeses me off.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How can we fix it?  I'm sure there are enough influential people on the
&gt; &gt; list for us to actually start making some changes around here :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Another point - MS Office 2000.  This is scarey to me.  It's
&gt; &gt; defining new standards everywhere.  Their Intranet package - which
&gt; &gt; you're supposed to be able to quickly and easily set up a corporate
&gt; &gt; Intranet.. "In Under 60 Minutes"  ("while I was at lunch the tech guys
&gt; &gt; set up the intranet")  BAH!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is both frustrating and a bit scarey..   BUT it doesn't
&gt; &gt; work at "full capacity" unless /everything/ is windows 2000 and office
&gt; &gt; 2000.  The server has to be running 2000, the clients have to be
&gt; &gt; running 2000 and IE5.
&gt;
&gt; I tried installing some MS "extensions" for Apache once, for our
&gt; web guy. It replaced the httpd executable with one that was twice the
&gt; size and wouldn't start. The idea of Windows 2000 on one machine
&gt; frightens me, let alone many.
&gt;
&gt; Please note that this is not an MS-Hate thing. I've run Windows 2000 on a
&gt; Pentium PRO 200 with 64Mb of RAM and nothing else and it sucked (all of my
&gt; resources). Maybe they'll one day go back to the time when the GUI was
&gt; *optional* on a server.

I, too, have heard tell that 128M of RAM is the minimum realistic amount for
win2k :/  $$$$$$$$$$$

&gt; &gt; The "if it's not all Microsoft, it won't work as well"
&gt; &gt; mentality is coming heavily into play..
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Might be a bad thing for them. I think the whole world is getting a little
&gt; pissed.

But the whole world is still buying all their software and will continue to
do so until something better is offered.

&gt; Matt

Nick.
