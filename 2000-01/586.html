&gt; You dont mention what version of NETSCRAPE you are running???? presume
&gt; 4.61 or better, just reinstall the netscape-4.61.rpm (or whatever) with
&gt; --force to make it over write the existing one ** or you could be neat &

&gt; 

sorry, running 4.7

&gt; (Something to think abt...netscrape was a windows product b4 it was
&gt; linux ;))) therefore if it misbehaves, treat it accordingly :)

actually, I was under the impression that it grew from NCSA Mosaic,
which was a Unix product. I could be wrong here, but I'm pretty certain
that Netscape was originally more Unix than Windows.

&lt;snip&gt; 

&gt; I have NEVER had any major issues with NETSCRAPE ever... not on win311,
&gt; win95, win98 or any distro of linux!! It generally performs faultlessly
&gt; (sometimes a tad slow tho!) HOWEVER, I run IE5 on a win98 box - it is a

I'm sure you are unique in this regard. I don't think I have ever come
across someone who hasn't had netscape problems...

&gt; piece of s**t - falls over, locks up does stupid stuff I dont want it to
&gt; do... so .... I think that ultimately the adage of "...your mileage may
&gt; vary" is probably relevant! ;)

I also have plentry of IE5 problems, including having it fall over
(however, if I get over enthusiastic with netscape, and have too many
windows open at once, then my memory gets consumed, I enter deep swap,
and I either get rebooted, or I reboot myself... Bah! I hate all
software, OSes, hardware, peripherals and programming languages! Anyone
know where the nearest Luddite village is?
