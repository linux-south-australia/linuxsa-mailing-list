&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I think the original scriptures never said she was a virgin.  The 
&gt;&gt; word that was used translates just as well as unmarried woman.  The
&gt;&gt; church apparently decided that being unmarried wasn't special enough
&gt;&gt; and they instigated the (incorrect) interpretation of virgin.
&gt;
&gt;Wow - now *THIS* is flamewar material :)

Indeed ...

&gt;Who says the scriptures existed in the first place?  And if they
&gt;definitely did, who said they're right at all?  Who says they weren't
&gt;written by some guy(s) as a joke?

Hmmm, we have ample, and solid, evidence for the existence of the Jewish
Scriptures, including, but not limited to, the Dead Sea Scrolls.  There
are, of course, textual variants.

The quality of the evidence supporting the claims made in the Jewish
Scriptures, the OT and the NT, on the other hand, is open to considerable
question.  But then, the same is true of the Vedas, and all other religious
texts.

However, it is all very interesting ... As are the strong parallels between
Buddhist traditions and Christian traditions about Jesus.  Seems that
Alexander the Great had a powerful influence on the world for several
thousand years.  No wonder the Greeks are not content to let the
Macedonians have him all to themselves.

&gt;I have an idea :)  Let's write some scriptures of our own now, and in
&gt;2000 years' time everyone can argue about their validity on a mailing
&gt;list about something else.  Let's make Linus the God (just to keep
&gt;this thread /slightly/ linux-related) and Tux the Jesus.
&gt;
&gt;Sound good?
