My RH6.1 was doing that (the delete key, not 'c'!), but after I rebuilt the
machine, the delete and backspace keys now work as per M$.  Hmmm...dunno what I
did, but it's working.  I don't know how to remap keys, or even find out their
current mapping, so I'm probably not much help, unless you can tell me where to
look for a keymap mods file.
Also, anyone able to help with GNOME/KDE setups?
RH defaults to GNOME when I log in, but I would like to change this to KDE as
the default, and only GNOME when I deliberately ask for it.
Ideas?

Cheers.

Subject:  Rebinding Delete to delete-char for editing




Hi,

I have seen lots of Windoze types get very frustrated when they hit the
delete key to remove the character in front of the cursor, only to find
that it behaves like backspace.

I was interested to rebind that key to delete-char rather than
backward-delete-char as it currently is.

However, for the life of me, I have not managed to get bash to do it.

All I have succeeded doing is to unbind the 'c' key, so now I have to type
^Vc to get a 'c' recognized.  I feel like I am in a Monty Python skit :-)

I have tried:  bind "\C-?": delete-char

but it seems not to work ...

Has anyone had any success with this?


Regards
