&gt; bollocks. Passing judgment is a personal right everbody does
&gt; everyday. 
&gt; 
&gt; example 1 Will I eat this banana? Hmm it's a bit mushy, my judgement
&gt; is that it would taste icky, so I wont eat this banana and I'll let
&gt; people know what I think about this banana.
&gt; 
&gt; example 2 Will i read this stoopid thread? Hmm it's a bit mushy, my
&gt; judgement is that it would taste icky, so I wont read this thread,
&gt; and I'll let people know what I think about this thread.

If this is really your response to my comment about passing judgement,
then you get the award for 'consistantly missing the point'. (again)

We are talking about two completely different things. It's one thing
to express disinterest in a thread, its another to expect them to stop
cause you don't like it.

Rather than bothering to have this conversation with you *again*, just
read the archives. We went through this last time.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Nick will _not_ be putting any cockamame web page (will you
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nick? :)).
&gt; 
&gt; I was just taking the words out of his mouth that you had inserted
&gt; ;)

Some people *just might* see the use of sarcasm to figuratively
illustrte a point, and 'putting words in someones mouth' as different.

&gt; &gt; Still a quick look at
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term">http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term</A>=sarcasm should
&gt; &gt; clear everything up.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks, but I'm quite aware waht sarcasm means. ;) (my - was that an
&gt; example just then?)

I really don't think you do!

Still, it's entertaining.

Cheers

Alex!
