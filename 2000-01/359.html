Hi,

&gt; &gt; What is happening here ? It is important to be able to boot NT for the
&gt; &gt; moment. How do I fix this, or restore the MBR ?
&gt; 
&gt; I think it's actually telling you that it can't find a file specified in the
&gt; /mnt/0/etc/lilo.conf. Is there anything in there that it can't access? Remember
&gt; devices are files in Unix, so if your boot CD doesn't have these set up the same,
&gt; it won't work.

Yes that is the location of the file, incase I didn't make that clear,
/mnt/0/ should become my "/" for linux. But as you note, since I'm booting
from CD ROM, all the relative locations are changed, hence all the paths
in the lilo command.

&gt; Restoring the boot sector is easy with your local friendly DOS boot disk and
&gt; FDISK /MBR. 

Will that work ? Its an NTFS partition, and Win NT uses ntldr rather than
IO.sys, and MSDOS.SYS. What does an fdisk /mbr do ? (Yes I know fix the
Master Boot Record, what tdes that do tho, point the boot partition back
to being the primary one rather than lilo od the second hdd ?

It even leaves your data on the disk. NT should still boot (NT is the
&gt; second worst operating system to dual boot - Slowaris being the first. Neither
&gt; like any partition tables being touched much).

Yes, fortunately I haven't needed to muck with Slowaris partitions much.

Thanks for the help so far.
