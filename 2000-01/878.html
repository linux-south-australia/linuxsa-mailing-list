&gt; Go to the SUN site and register for StarOffice.  It comes with exactly 
what

Its not bad looking, though I had to remove the scheduler.

I'm not sure if it is just my system or what (Red Hat 5.2 on a 586 with 
48M Ram & a 6G hard drive), but Star Office would regularly (every hour 
or so) kick the CPU load up to a little over 1.0 & essentially lockup 
for about 10 minutes. This was under both Enlightenment/Gnome & Window 
Maker - the last I still run. I was able to jump to other virtual 
screens & do stuff with no problems though. &lt;shrug!&gt; There were never 
any error messages to suggest there was a problem & when Star Office 
came back to life, it worked fine - 'til the next time.

After a couple of months of trying various things to find/fix the 
problem, I gave up in disgust last Saturday, did an delete & 
re-install (minus the scheduler, as far as I can remember all other 
settings are the same) & all seems to be working fine. I realise that 
this problem could've been caused by the system configuration problems 
on my system (of which there are several that I'm slowly figuring out 
how to correct), but I don't know what or why! Judging by the fact 
that I've seen no one else complain of this problem, it probably is 
just me. :-(

I use Star Office for nearly everything I do under Linux: news, email, 
web browsing &c. I've had a look at the spread sheet & think it is 
perhaps better than excel. The other Office applications are 
reasonably good, some could do with some touch-ups here & there 
(especially the address book), but the same can be said of most Office 
suites. 

For all that I've said above, if you have a test system (or maybe even 
if you don't), my recommendation is to give it a go, if you don't have 
the trouble I had, I think you'll like the what you get.
