Paul,

&gt;SO, I throw down the gauntlet.  Make it available, by other means if
&gt;neccessary, to us mere mortals, or get off the mailing list.  I will go so
far
&gt;as to say those of you out there who ARE interested in learning about
Linux
&gt;(but don't have the means to pay for a "proffessional" course - (you could
go
&gt;and do a MSCE for about the same.. and have a "guaranteed" job at the end
of
&gt;it!!)) Let me know directly and if I get enough interest I will
investigate
&gt;further to see what resources I can pull together to make our OWN course
&gt;happen.  However, I can only do this in Adelaide, so I apologise to people
&gt;from elsewhere for missing out.

So who elected you as the arbiter of who is welcome to post to
this list?

I suggest that you try a little experiment.  Take a look at the
last few months worth of posts to this list and count the number
of helpful answers to user questions originating from you and
from each of the people you are criticising: then tell me who is
making the greater ongoing contribution to rank and file users!

Oh, and I look forward to attending your class when you get it
organised.  A positive contribution such as that is always
welcome.

Cheers, Dieter.
