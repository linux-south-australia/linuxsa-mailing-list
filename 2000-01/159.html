Greetings,

This problem has been resolved by other methods, but if someone can point
me in the direction of information I would be most greatful.

Server Setup... RH 6.0 box, running the standard ipop3 deamon.

Client Setup...

Widowze Box at home running Eudora with a POP connection. Email is
downloaded but not removed from server.
Windowse Box at work running Eudora with POP connection. Email is
downloaded and REMOVED from server.


Symptom...

On home box, get an email that has a corrupted attachemnt. Problem clears
itself before I get to look at it.

User returns to work, and downloads mail. Same message downloads and
causes Eudora to crash. Think the easiest way is to log onto server and
manually delete this message using pine or something.

Here is the problem, his mail spool in /var/spool/mail was )kb in size
!! Eudora said that there were 48 messages ther (and indeed downloaded 47
when I used netscape to delete the corrupted message using delete from
server when emptying trash POP setting).

Sending a message to this person didn't increase the mail spool file, it
remained at zero !

I tried doing a locate for files of the same name, but there was nothing
of the same name elsewhere.

My thoughts are that between the two clients, ipopd3 caches the mail spool
somewhere in a file of its own name, but there is a one page man page on
ipop3d, and I can't find any other documentation on it.

Has anyone else had similar experiences ? Can someone point me in the
direction of more helpful documentation ?

Thanks
