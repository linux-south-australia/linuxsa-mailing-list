&gt; &gt; Is this documented anywhere? I looked in 'man X' and saw nothing
&gt; &gt; relating to the -query option...
&gt; 
&gt; What does `X --help` say?
&gt; 

&lt;refrains from cutting amd pasting whole output here... :) &gt;

ahh... you know how sometimes you just don't think of the obvious...
well that jsut happened to me :) ...

&gt; &gt; although I did try running it on my local machine to see what would
&gt; &gt; happen... I went to the virtual terminal on C-A-F1, and typed "X
&gt; &gt; -query dagar :1", and it brought up an X Server on vterm 8 (there's
&gt; &gt; already one running on 7). However, all I got was the stipple
&gt; &gt; pattern and an X Mouse icon -- no wm, etc..
&gt; 
&gt; Are you running xdm on your machine? It contacts xdm and give you a
&gt; login box.

no, I'm running gdm

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can still use the X on 7, but can't do anything on 8... Did I
&gt; &gt; misunderstand what you meant, or am I supposed to be able to get
&gt; &gt; access to my running desktop from another machine?
&gt; 
&gt; Not actually running, as in one that is already running under a
&gt; standard execution of X. You can just fire up your window manager and
&gt; you won't be able to tell that you're not on the machine console.

ahh -- so that's not as exciting as I thought... I've seen that done
before... must have misinterpreted your mail... :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This seems unlikely to me, but then, I've been surprised by X before
&gt; &gt; (positively, and negatively)... Maybe it's not working because I am
&gt; &gt; on the one machine...
&gt; 
&gt; Probably not running xdm.

no, I'm running gdm...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ooh ooh -- just got an error message...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; XDM: too many retransmissions
&gt; 
&gt; There you go!

it's because I'm not running xdm, right? :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I normally use gdm... hmmm -- I think this may have something to do
&gt; &gt; with either xdm/gdm or doing it all on the one machine...
&gt; 
&gt; try xdm.

yep, I think that's it... gdm can't do XDMCP...

you should read these messages before hitting reply so you don't repeat
yourself...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; any explanations?
&gt; 
&gt; I should read these messages before hitting reply so I don't repeat
&gt; myself!
