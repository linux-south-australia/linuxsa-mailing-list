Hi,

&gt; card..DEAD..not a bloody sausage! All the cards I tried were dual
&gt; (ie/bnc & rj45) and it was very obvious that all the data was busily
&gt; flowing out the rj45 hole & not out the bnc!! :( 
&gt; I got around the problem by sticking in a "bnc only" network card
&gt; HOWEVER I would like to know how to re-educate my cards... they USED to
&gt; work fine on coax then I played with all of them on cat5....now they
&gt; wont do coax any more :( I have read the hardware, ethernet & networking
&gt; howto's and apart from 1 brief reference to ether paramaters for a 3c503
&gt; there is no mention of how to MAKE the bloody thing send data out the
&gt; BNC (NB: No, there are NOT any jumpers to switch).

Generally if there are no jumpers on the card, they should be auto sense,
however it is possible on some cards to turn off autosense, through the
Software configuration program. Sometimes there are also driver options.

If you no longer have the driver disk for the card try the 3com site (that
looks like a 3com driver), or other apropriate driver site if it isn't a 3
com card (www.windrivers.com contains links to all network card driver
sites on the web).

cya
