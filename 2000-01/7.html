&gt; 
&gt; Doh !!! This argument is getting boring.....
&gt; 
&gt; It's a very simple concept, and is not dependent on a year zero.  When you
&gt; were born you began living in the first year of your life, in your first
&gt; decade, in your first century, etc.....  When you reached your first
&gt; aniversary you were 1 year old - then straight away you began living in your
&gt; 2nd year, etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Thus, on 01/01/1999 we started to live in the 2,000 year (forgetting any
&gt; additions/subtractions from the calendar in previous times) the final year
&gt; of the 20th century and the 2nd millenium.  At 01/01/2000 and one second we
&gt; began to live in the 2,001 year and thus the first year of the 3rd millenium
&gt; and the first year of the 21st century.


And to add my (GST soon to be added) 2 1/2 cents worth:

all dates are arbitrary measurements based on a linear perception of
time...
there is more than the Gregorian calendar - the Vietnamese Calendar, for
example, has New Year (Tet) Jan 26(thinks)
all calendars are those which are ACCEPTED by the majority of that
society(or societies), and used as such...
if the majority says happy millenium, millenium it is....(arguments of
logic rarely hold sway with majority decisions!)

therefore..
happy millenium!!!!!!!

actually, so far, the whole y2k thang has been a bit, well, of a damp
squib(wet firework...)
which is fine by me:))))

from romana & shaun, with sagan (linux) doing fine(naturally), and
hal(win98) patched within an inch(25mm) of his life, also doing fine....
the kidlings, on the other hand, are showing y2k issues (having to do
with a very late night, and a rare overindulgence in chocolate)
