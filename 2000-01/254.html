<H1>Linux Installation Problems</H1>

Hi,

I recently bought the revised edition of Linux pocketbook which includes 3 cds,
one of which contains Red Hat 6.0 to be installed on the PC. I followed the
installation procedures but have run into a bit of trouble. I have installed
it such that I have the choice of running either Win98 or Linux as my operating
system. 

The problem I have encountered is that I am unable to get the sound working
when I am running on the Linux operating system (it works fine when runningwin98).
 As instructed in the booklet I have enabled sound as one of the services that
starts up when Linux boots. The sound card that is installed in my PC is Sound
Blaster16.

Please advise me as to how to enable the sound on the Linux operating system.


Another problem is that I wish for the option of being able to shut down my
computer entirely after a Linux session, however I only have the options of
rebooting or halting the system when I log out. Hence I am forced to reboot
the computer, choose to load Windows and then shut down from there. Is there
a way of getting around this so that I can include shut down as one of my log
out options in Linux?

Thank You very much for your assistance. Any advice you can give me is greatly
appreciated.

Regards,
Maidhili Chinnappan
