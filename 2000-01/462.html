&gt;&gt; What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?  PDF?  HTML?
&gt;&gt; TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(

I've read of an indexer that has backend convertors, so you can index
any type of document (provided you have the appropriate convertor, of
course).  Must rummage that URL up.

&gt; RTF is OK, but can you include picturey things? I like include diagrams - it
&gt; means I can write less.

As bitmaps, from memory.

&gt;&gt; Maybe somebody should write a user friendly program that converts DOC to
&gt;&gt; a nice standard?

&gt; I thought there was one.

There is a Perl and C library that someone has written that can read
Word 7 DOC file formats; they said it was basically a serialised OLE
format (which you would expect from Microsoft).  I'll see if I can
dredge up the links for that.
 
&gt;&gt; Another point - MS Office 2000.  This is scarey to me.  It's defining new
&gt;&gt; standards everywhere.

Or breaking existing ones.

&lt;Microsoft drivel returned&gt;

Since when was Host a mandatory header in HTTP/1.0?

&gt;&gt; The "if it's not all Microsoft, it won't work as well" mentality is coming
&gt;&gt; heavily into play..

Has anyone read the news that Bill is supposed to be stepping down
as CEO of Microsoft (according to Altavista)?  Only, he's putting
Steve Ballmer in his place, who is just as rabid as Gates (someone
once asked Ballmer was "adequate" market share for a Microsoft
product was.  His response: "100%").

&gt; P.S. maybe we could hack up word compatability for vi.

Do a user-friendly and add a paper-clip to it?
