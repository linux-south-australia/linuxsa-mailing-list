&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; weeeell - I agree it takes some getting used to, but if you know how to
&gt; &gt; use it, it can be pretty cool. My only gripe is that some information is
&gt; &gt; repeated with different detail levels....
&gt; 
&gt; My gripe is that your options for searching and refining are limited. You
&gt; can't back track through search levels. This would be a REALLY useful
&gt; feature.
&gt; 
&gt; A web page interface wouldn't be hard to write, and there are free index
&gt; programs for PC that could interface with it. They've already got most of
&gt; it done on their web site. It wouldn't take much to produce a CD version.

on the same topic - are there any GPL indexing software out there? I
wouldn't be surprised if there is alread one on my system.

What I want is a program (like `locate`) which when I run a maintenance
program (like `updatedb`) it will create an searchable index of the text
in the files of some directory.

Then you could run those searches like "string 1" && "string 2" && !
"string 3"

that would be cool.

Then - if it took off, all the websites around the place would use it
and we would achieve total world domination! mwa ah ah ah.
