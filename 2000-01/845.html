Something I read recently is that MS has basically made Active Directory use
extensions to LDAP. Also LDAP was waaaaaaaaaay before Active Directory, so
your statement should be Active Directory is another word for LDAP (or more
accurately, implements LDAP). So in a strict sense standard LDAP programs
attempting to utilise Active Directory are supposed to fail....

Of course this is the hype from Novell.

I know this is not in this response, but the Install on demand and other
fancy features of Win2000 are due to the Windows Installer module (available
for NT and Win9x), basically is a com standin and the installer monitors
attempts to access these features and then reaches out, installs the module
and allows the calling process to continue. This could be implemented under
*nix, don't think it is..

Subject: RE: Linux as an NT Server replacement


&gt; &gt; &gt; 9 MS Office server stuff (I know nothing about this, but can Linux do
it?)
&gt; &gt; Like .. ?  Are we talking Office 2000?  Linux probably can't manage it.
&gt; &gt; Office 2000 uses weird-ass stuff like Active Directory etc.
&gt; &gt; Other than that, MS Office doesn't need a server other than a file/app
&gt; &gt; server.
&gt;
&gt; Weird Ass meaning Not Invented Here or Weird Ass meaning a hacky work
&gt; around?  I think LDAP is another word for Active Directory, and there is
&gt; a Linux LDAP server available (www.openldap.org).
&gt;
&gt; Example: NIS/YP servers might be hard to replace with MS stuff (if that
&gt; is the way you go) because they are weird ass.
&gt;
&gt; I agree that Exchange is the only thing that is difficult to emulate, if
&gt; it is being used as more than a mail server.
