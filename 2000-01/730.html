Here's  how a friend who is on this list did it for me a few years ago .. it
should do what you want with appropriate tweaking.

# ----  script to invoke dialing in to ISP (/usr/local/bin/dialtpg  ???)------

#!/bin/sh
/bin/setserial /dev/cua1 spd_vhi
/usr/sbin/pppd /dev/cua1 115200
# ---- end of script to invoke dialing in to ISP ------

then you need for it to do the actuall connecting via a options file.  This
assumes second serial port for modem (cua1)

# ------  /etc/ppp/options.cua1 ----
-detach
asyncmap 0x00000000
defaultroute
netmask 255.255.255.0 /dev/cua1
crtscts
modem
connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v ABORT BUSY ABORT "NO CARRIER" "" ATZ OK ATM0L0 OK
ATDT82222222 CONNECT "" "ogin:" "username" "ssword:" "secret" ""'
# ------ end of   /etc/ppp/options.cua1 ----

the 'connect' line is one continuous line with a space after CONNECT.. not two
lines as above.
You'll need to edit the name, password and ISP phone number

Type 'dialtpg' and it should fire up!
hope this helps.

&gt; Hi Nathan
&gt;
&gt; I use both TPG and RH 6.1.  And yes, I too had some early problems
&gt; connecting.  However, the PPP howto assisted greatly with this.
&gt;
&gt; Basically, what I do now is this: run minicom to dial in.  TPG uses
&gt; text-based logins and not PAP, so this may be one reason that your
&gt; connects are failing.  After typing in my username and password, and
&gt; choosing 'ppp' as my choice, I leave minicom without resetting the modem
&gt; (ctr-a-q).  After this, I run pppd and everything seems fine.  Note that I
&gt; do this as root (ok ok, that's not good, but i don't think there's any
&gt; great security risk in doing this).
&gt;
&gt; I strongly recommend you read the PPP howto, as this gives a detailed
&gt; explanation of what to do.  It also goes into how to create scripts that
&gt; users can use to dial in and log on automatically.  These too worked for
&gt; me, but due to reinstalls and laziness I haven't bothered with them again
&gt; :)
&gt;
&gt; One thing to keep in mind is to run the pppd as soon as you leave minicom.
&gt; A good idea is to have it in your shell history so you can just tap the
&gt; 'up' key a few times.  I had some problems at one stage due to TPG
&gt; disconnecting me, which i think was due to not starting pppd quickly
&gt; enough.
&gt;
&gt; Another small but vital tip: make sure your modem's speed in both minicom
&gt; and pppd are identical.  The default init strings in minicom should work
&gt; ok with most modems.
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps, and once again, I stress you read to PPP howto.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
