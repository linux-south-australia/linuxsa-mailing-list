 &gt; I completely disagree.  I'm tired of people whinging about how difficult

I agree, although I suspect my point of view is colored by the fact
that I've been using it for over a decade, so of *course* it's going
to be easy :-)

That being said, I don't think UNIX's "competitors" are even the least
bit intuitive.  Could anyone care to explain to me why a picture of a
rectangle with a little diagonal line over one corner is code for
"Give me a new document"?  Or why a picture of a folder means "Save"
and a floppy disk means "load"?  (or is it the other way around?  I
can never remember, which kinda illustrates my point).  Or why the 
icons in a load/save dialog box look exactly the same as the icons
on the desktop, but inexplicably behave differently?  Or why following
a link in Internet Explorer requires a single-click, except when it's
being used to view your machine's directory tree, in which case it
needs a double-click?  Or why Windows Help never actually provides 
any help because the documentation is so bloody atrocious?  Or any
of the other bizarre inconsistencies in the OS that touts itself as
something that's "user-friendly," but which users almost universally
seem to loathe?

I'm sick of people saying that UNIX is hard -- because everything else
is bloody hard too, it's just that if you're coming from a Windows
background UNIX seems hard because you've already given yourself
years of training in the intricacies of Windows and no time at all
to learning about what makes UNIX tick.  Similarly, I find Windows to
be a pile of festering donkey turds because I'm accustommed to the 
UNIX way, and the Windows way is different, foreign and non-intuitive
as a result.  Do I complain about this and denigrate Windows for 
being complicated?  By and large, no -- it's only exchanges on mailing
lists like this that I vent my spleen about the almost total absence of 
user-friendliness in Windows. :-)

A fact of life is that *any* level of expertise with any operating
system on any platform is HARD -- The idea that it's easy is an
utter con-job that is only swallowed by the kind of people who believe
advertising.  Sure, Windows is so bloody simple that someone relatively
unskilled can use it to write letters and sort their CD list, but ask
them *why* they're doing what they're doing, and watch how they
get flustered whenever *anything* unexpected happens, or listen to them
say, "Oh, Word can't do that," when it *can* do it but they just don't
know how to make it happen, and it becomes obvious that they're able
to use Windows to write letters and sort CD lists because they've
learned how to do it by rote, not because it's intuitive, easy or
good for beginners.

The next step from that is to work out whether people who learn UNIX
applications by rote perform their tasks any worse or with any lower
level of understanding -- And the really staggering thing is that
they almost universally *DON'T*.  

It's all a matter of perspective.  Those who say, "UNIX is too hard
to learn!" are really saying, "I've spent years trying to learn how
to drive Windows, and I figure I'm only just starting to get the hang
of it, but I haven't invested any time or effort at all into UNIX so
it all seems like a black art."  Those who recognize that, and who
go on to display the same levels of flexibility and intelligent
experimentation that gave them their Windows skills in the first place
are the ones who are truly successful at making the switch from 'Doze
to *NIX.

The key realization here for newbies is that it isn't really any harder,
it's just different.  Play around, experiment, understand that you 
won't hurt the machine no matter how badly you screw up, and have 
fun with it -- you'll be able to go a long way all by yourself if
you have the right attitude, and the feeling of elation you get when
you look back and realize that you've learned a complicated "black art"
all by yourself is something that's impossible to get from any other
source.

 &gt; Boy that sounded like a flame.  It wasn't.
