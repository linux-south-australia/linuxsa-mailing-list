Hi - the Kppp in the latest KDE tells you to remove the lock in
/etc/ppp/options when you first boot it up - previous versions didnt -
it was in one of the readme's . Kppp does its own locking, as needed, so
it wont work properly with "lock" already in the options file.

&gt; Today I was able to get myself connected to the 'net via the rp3 dialer
&gt; without hassles.  I then proceeded to try ther kppp dialer and found
&gt; that it would disconnect as soon as the connection was established.  A
&gt; look at the log says it was expecting a secret from the other end (wierd
&gt; eh?).  I had a single entry in my /etc/ppp/options file .. 'lock'.
&gt; removing this file and creating an empty new on fixed the proble.  My
&gt; question is this. Why does one work and the other not?  Is it the option
&gt; line or is it that the default installed options file is assigned to the
&gt; daemon group but the empty one I created is just assigned to root?  It's
&gt; no big deal, just curious as they both work now.
&gt; regards ... Don
