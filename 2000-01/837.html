Bumper Bonus Issue! 2 replies in one!

David Drury:
&gt; One question here is are you integrating into an existing systen, or are
&gt; you starting afresh. If the latter, I think you've pretty much covered the
&gt; options and alternatives. If the former, then you've go to consider the
&gt; integration into existing systems, eg I don't know of an exchange server
&gt; for Linux, and it uses its own specific format.

could be either -- most likely a clean start or a straight replacement (ie
get rid of all NT except where Linux can't do it -- exchange, non-standard
stuff, etc)

Nick Morrison:
&gt; 1-8 *nods*
&gt;
&gt; &gt; 9 MS Office server stuff (I know nothing about this, but can Linux do
it?)
&gt;
&gt; Like .. ?  Are we talking Office 2000?  Linux probably can't manage it.
&gt; Office 2000 uses weird-ass stuff like Active Directory etc.

Yep, that's what I meant -- the fancy features of Office 2000 like
auto-install, and other things that they claim need NT Server, etc etc
(really don't know much about this at all)... is it likely that Samba would
support this eventually?

&gt; Other than that, MS Office doesn't need a server other than a file/app
&gt; server.

In which case, Linux/Samba would be fine...

&gt; &gt; 10 Other stuff -- MS BackOffice, etc (can Linux do everything
&gt; &gt; worth anything or not?)
&gt;
&gt; *nods*
&gt;
&gt; The only thing that you might have to look out for is replacing the
&gt; functionality of MS Exchange when it comes to schedule+ etc (or whatever
it
&gt; is now..)..  allowing multiple people to access each others schedule in
&gt; Outlook or MS Exchange etc.  The MS Exchange Server is required for that
to
&gt; happen.
&gt;
&gt; The only hard thing to completely replace is the Exchange Server.

Hmmm... I guess Notes would also be fun... I guess the basic functionality
(mail, news, etc) can be done with standard internet protocols, but when it
comes to fancy stuff, like using the workgroup features of Outlook2000 or
Notes, it becomes impossible... Anyone know of any plans to replicate this
functionality?

&gt; BEST of luck!

thanks -- I'll keep you all posted when I know what I'm actually doing... :)

Ta for the help
