&gt; &gt; For almost all web work, i simply use KDE's kfm integrated file and web

&gt; &gt; the grain of Linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lean and mean, keep it simple, stupid.
&gt;
&gt; Agreed, agreed, agreed. Yesterday I was doing some work and only had
&gt; my laptop with me. I was making phone calls and needed a basic
&gt; spreadsheet to record events, details, etc. I was going to use vi
&gt; because I didn't have staroffice or applixware or anything installed.
&gt; (and emacs is for wimps! :o] ). Instead I found the gnumeric
&gt; spreadsheet that comes with gnome. It is very small, very compact,
&gt; loads in less than a second, and when you look at the menus and lack
&gt; of buttons and crap, you could be excused for thinking it wasn't
&gt; feature rich. As with any spreadsheet, once you get started more
&gt; features are required and my example was no different. Thing is, it
&gt; could do everything that excel can do. I'm sure there are features it
&gt; is missing, but I havn't found them yet. I browsed the function help
&gt; page, and realised that this little spreadsheet is actually very
&gt; powerful.
&gt;

I found the same hing with LyX. It looks as though it's just another dodgy
X-based text editor, but it's actually quite advanced. Being quick helps too.
Again, there are many features that it includes (some you have to look for)
and I believe it can even spell check (not needed - me englij speek good).
Also has easy (yet completely customisable) conversion stuff (to and from ps /
dvi).

Quite good.

Matt
