Gidday folks...

A colleague of mine has written some real time software for DOS. It
reads and writes to 4 bar code scanners attatched to serial ports (soon
to be multiplexed to 8 or more scanners), 3 printers, a keyboard and a
display. He'd now like to move this to a platform that aloows him to use
the internet -- either Windows 95/98/NT or Linux. His experience with 95
is that it crashes after 20 minutes, and 98 is signifigantly better but
not perfect. NT is expensive. Linux is new to him (although he has
programmed all sorts of things, including multiple Unices since before I
was a sparkle in my parent's eyes...)

The software he has written pretty much standard C++, using Borland C++,
and should mostly be portable code. The only thing of concern to him is
the custom code he wrote to interface with the serial ports. He simply
opens a port, and reads and writes to various byte offsets... I'm pretty
sure (without having had any experience in this at all) that this should
be acheivable using Linux, but have no idea how much work it would
involve... does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing? Have
I provided enough information? Is there any other major questions
regarding porting of RT software from DOS to Linux that should be asked
before embarking on such a project?

TIA
