&gt; re our discussion a little while ago, I installed RH6.1 on a drive which
&gt; also contained a DOS partition.  Result:
&gt; Hdb1 Primary DOS
&gt; Hdb2 Primary DOS
&gt; Hdb5 Logical Linux Native (/boot)
&gt; Hdb6 Logical Linux Native (/)
&gt; Hdb7 Logical Linux Swap
&gt;
&gt; Note that there is no partition labelled 'Extended'
&gt; Note that Hdb5 is real - a primary partition in which data is stored.
&gt; Note - there are FIVE partitions ??

whooo slow down, you're getting some terms mixed up.

inviolable rule #1 PRIMARY partitions plural

there can only ever be four (4) primary partitions. The location of these
partitions on the disk are contained in the first bytes of the first sector
of every hard disk and it is called the master boot record (mbr), solely
because a bootable binary of some kind can co-exist there in the remaining
512 bytes of that sector. They are primary, and there are only (a maximum)
of four because that is the physical definition of their location and
structure on the disk.

these partitions correspond to hdX1,2,3 and 4, they cannot be called
anything else.

the fact that hdb4 is not used in your setup is irrelevant. hdb3 (although
unlisted) most certainly is. an entry exists in your mbr on hdb for
partition 4, it says 'zero bytes' and is ignored.

rule # 2 EXTENDED partition - singular

one of these 'primary' partitions, and only one, can be instead an
'extended' partition. (which is not a partition at all). It points to a
location on the disk which contains a linked list of 'logical' partitions.
You can have as many logical partitions as you care to endure but the
practical limit for linux at least is 16-4 due to the make up of major and
minor nodes in /dev directory that point to these partitions.

*any* of the four partitions hda1 through 4 can be an extended 'pseudo
partition and is generally indicated as such in listings as

&lt;hda2&gt; hda5

this syntax says, the first logical partition hda5 is in the extended
partition called hda2.

rule #3 LOGICAL partitions -many

logical partitions start at hdX5 and grow from there.

the reason why only one extended partition exists (if it exists at all) is
because more than one is silly, it could only ever duplicate the linked
chain present in the first one.

As for the naming conventions for these 3 partition types, i don't make the
rules, and they're confusing, but, by any measurement, the above are the
facts.
