&gt; Has anyone read the news that Bill is supposed to be stepping down
&gt; as CEO of Microsoft (according to Altavista)?  Only, he's putting
&gt; Steve Ballmer in his place, who is just as rabid as Gates (someone
&gt; once asked Ballmer was "adequate" market share for a Microsoft
&gt; product was.  His response: "100%").
&gt; 

Daryl - perhaps you are equalising rabid with ambitious. I do not mean
(or want) to start a flame war here. Just want to state that while
Ballmer's comment may come across as arrogant or zealous, any business
that has ambitions of being or remaining number one in their industry
wants to maximise their market share. I do not think that currently any
company honestly believes that they can achieve 100% of any market
unless they are granted a monopoly by government or patents. I also do
not believe that anyone can say that MS marketing has not been
exceptional and some of the past business decisions have put MS where
they are today - no matter the functionality, reliability or appeal of
their products. I my opinion the comment by Ballmer is therefore a
challenge to other companies to retain or increase their own market
share and therefore decrease the dominance of MS.
