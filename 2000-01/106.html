Hi,

&gt; PS.  The cold war was fought to save us from
&gt; Stalinist controls as seen in Romania.
&gt; Now we have worse controls than Ceausescu
&gt; could have dreamed of. ASIO hacking computers
&gt; to plant encryption software booby traps
&gt; (using melissa-style worms?), phone companies
&gt; obliged to make communications tappable,
&gt; and so forth. The loss of individual human
&gt; dignity will be complete if a law is passed to
&gt; compel people to part with their encryption
&gt; keys on pain of incarceration.

SBS Had an interesting program last night and last week on privacy, and
how, and in what manner we are surveyed and recorded in our day to day
lives.

Re your first comments, I think you were more right when you mentioned the
"It won't happen to me" sindrome. Australians are great at seeing
problems, but the sindrome often prevents us from doing anything about it,
so control can be exerted little by little. If we had a freedom of speach
clause in our constitution then there'd be something fundamental to rally
people around. Since there isn't, then it relies on a few "activists" to
make a fus for the rest of us.
