&gt; This happens for me when IE5 tries to log into an FTP server.

3, 4 and 5 have always sucked for FTP - I can't believe that
Microsoft still don't have it right (well, I try not to believe :-)

&gt; I agree with you though - I really like using Internet Explorer.  It's a
&gt; pity there isn't a browser that sleek and fast for Linux...

Has anyone used Opera yet?  Specifically, the Linux version?  Any
opinions?

Is there anything else for Unix (not necessarily Linux)?  I
recall seeing the source for Mosaic quite a while ago, but
of course HTML 2.0 is not as popular as it used to be.

&gt; Netscape BITES.  Its interface is clunky and it's not nice to use at all.
&gt; I don't like it.

Its IMAP support for the mail reader sucks as well.  I'd love a
browser where you could customise the UI (eg, add a button that 
could dump the current page to a script/program, instead of the
laborious save page to file and run program, or drag and drop as
I'm trying to implement now).
