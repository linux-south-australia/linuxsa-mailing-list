&gt; I'd be surprised if you could find a course of similar intensity, scope
&gt; and length for less than $1,995.  Also keep in mind this would probably
&gt; be a fairly well-recognised certification?

$400 per day for quality training is not hugely expensive in the commercial
arena.  Intending no disrepsect to Richard, who I fully expect will give
great training, I doubt that any certificate resulting from attending his
course will be of much value.  I imagine that employers seek people who
know their unix, and having attended a linux specific course will be about
as useful as having done a Solaris course; which is to say that if you know
your unix then the particular flavour is unimportant.  And if an employer
is relaxed over whether it's Solaris or FreeBSD or HP/UX or Linux, they
will care more about your experience than any piece of paper you might or
might not have.  They pay you to do a job, not to have passed a course.

If you want to learn how to grok unix then Richard's course will surely be
as good as, if not better than, any other quality unix course.  Take his
course and learn your favourite OS.  But remember that you must practice
your art to be useful as an employee.  Also remember when attending an
interview that you are skilled in unix.  (Why limit yourself to linux?)
