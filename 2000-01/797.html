If your card is a 3com 3c509 they do have a program (3c5x9cfg.exe) to
change the output from auto to either bnc or tp your card may have this
program too.

Hope this helps?

&gt; Hi all...........
&gt; Further to my previous post wherein I mentioned that I am self taught &
&gt; dont know everything abt Linux/Unix :) HELP! I changed my network over
&gt; to cat5 and a hub, from coax, a while back & left 1 pc on coax (the pc
&gt; is out in the garage abt 40 feet from the house) - I have only just got
&gt; around to sticking a 2nd network card in 1 of the pc's in my office to
&gt; bring the "garage pc" online.... connected everything up, configured the
&gt; card..DEAD..not a bloody sausage! All the cards I tried were dual
&gt; (ie/bnc & rj45) and it was very obvious that all the data was busily
&gt; flowing out the rj45 hole & not out the bnc!! :(
&gt; I got around the problem by sticking in a "bnc only" network card
&gt; HOWEVER I would like to know how to re-educate my cards... they USED to
&gt; work fine on coax then I played with all of them on cat5....now they
&gt; wont do coax any more :( I have read the hardware, ethernet & networking
&gt; howto's and apart from 1 brief reference to ether paramaters for a 3c503
&gt; there is no mention of how to MAKE the bloody thing send data out the
&gt; BNC (NB: No, there are NOT any jumpers to switch).
&gt; So, this has obviously happened to someone else ... so please enlighten
&gt; and educate me:)
