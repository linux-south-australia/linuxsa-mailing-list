&gt; &gt;&gt; The only thing that you might have to look out for is replacing the
&gt; &gt;&gt; functionality of MS Exchange when it comes to schedule+ etc (or whatever it
&gt; &gt;&gt; is now..)..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;This stuff has always been proprietory, usually involving weirdo RPC
&gt; &gt;calls.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm, there is some possibility that we will be able to decode this RPC
&gt; stuff later this year in Ethereal, which will make things interesting.
&gt; 

which is the whole point. People are forced to reverse engineer things
to make them work.

How much of samba was done by reverse engineering? How many examples did
you find of netbios not doing what it was supposed to do?

(This is not FUD, this is a question..)
