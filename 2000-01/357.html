I have a connection to bigpond direct, but only one computer up permanently
which masquerades (if this is the right term) a private network. Some
websites restrict access from some countries, by checking the IP address.
The problem is that the modem's IP is 139.whatever, and most places seem to
assume Australia is 203.whatever, or something similar. This means some
websites don't actually think I'm Australian.

With my bidpong connection, I have a few 203 addresses which I can use,
however, since I only have one computer that can have a 'real' IP address, I
can't use another computer as my gateway/proxy.

I know it's possible to use the dummy net driver to accept connections to my
203.whatever address, but is it possible to somehow use it as my gateway so
all packets sent over the 'net think it was sent from 203.x.x.x rather than
139.x.x.x?

I've been thinking about it for a while, but don't know a solution, and
wouldn't know which HOWTO might have that sort of problem in it.

Note, I can't add another computer with the 203 address and use that as the
gateway, unfortunatly.

Thanks,
Andy
