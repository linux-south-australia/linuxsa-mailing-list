&gt; &gt; &gt; Just please get it out of this list!!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; OK people, Nick has spoken.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Since Nick doesn't approve of this thread, it obviously needs to be
&gt; &gt; dropped now. Nick will be putting a guidelines web page up later today
&gt; &gt; to let you all know what is acceptable conversation and what is not.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, free thought, logical conversational extrapolation and non-linux
&gt; &gt; related talk, no matter how interesting it may be, must cease
&gt; &gt; immediately.....
&gt; .... including the right to pass judgement on what should and should not
&gt; be on the list.

'Opinion' would have been a better word that 'passing judgement', but
then you'd have been agreeing with me. No individual on this list has the right to
pass judgement. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. Big difference.

&gt; Nick has every right to say what ever he wants the list.

I agree.

&gt; Nick will _not_ be putting any cockamame web page (will you Nick? :)).

You just said he has every right to?

Still a quick look at

<A HREF="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term">http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term</A>=sarcasm

should clear everything up.

&gt; 
&gt; Really  Alex. Tsck.
&gt; 

*wink*

Cheers

Alex!
