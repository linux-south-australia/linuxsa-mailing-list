Hi,

&gt; Hmmm, I would be very interested in these 'Roman Records'.  Can you provide
&gt; me with references?
&gt;

Sorry, info provided by my RE teacher at school. He provided no
references, if I bump nto him in the next little while I'll ask.

&gt; You know, I have a number of Science Fiction books, and there is
&gt; archaeological evidence for events referred to in them as well, but that
&gt; does not make them true :-)

Sure, but they wouldn't have other means of referalverification in them
either.

&gt; Then of course, there are the many inconsistencies in the OT and NT.  For
&gt; example, how many women went to the tomb, and who/what did they see there?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;The chances are that it is not a joke or a fiction, tho there is much room
&gt; &gt;for "poetic licence" in it.
&gt; 
&gt; The NT and OT are clearly not a joke, and are probably not fiction in the
&gt; traditional sense of the word.  However, there are a number of
&gt; (non-canonical) gospels that did not make it into the Bible.  For example,
&gt; the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, etc.  A question to ask is why
&gt; were Gospels such common currency back then, and on what basis did material
&gt; that got into the Bible get chosen?

I believe (very faded memory here) that the Anglican church in the time
around the reformation "Standardised" the bible, which included what books
were true gosepels, and which weren't. I don't know much more than that,
like what the selection criteria for a true gospel was. When I've got a
spare hour I might research it a little more, but if you want the info
more urgently an internet search might provide soe light, or an
encyclopedia.

cya
