<H1>Xerox FP4 printer?</H1>

Hello!
I'm only 6 months into using linux so I'm still learning and am looking
for a bit of help......

I've got an old XEROX Fastpage 4 laser printer which still works fine on
my win-box, but as the ATX p/s in that pc died last week I'd like to do
some printing and can't get a new p/s just yet. Plus I'd like to share
the printer on this Linux box anyways.
So, does anyone know how I can get Linux to use this printer?
I'm hoping it's not a GDI-only printer...
The printer was originally available for windows 3.x (yes it's old)
I've managed after about 3 months of phoning and e-mailing Xerox to get
Win9x drivers a few years ago and these work as such:-
The install program sets up 3 printers: a GDI printer, a PCL printer and
a PS printer.
All these work well on the Win-box but the drivers won't access a
network port so sharing is not an available option. I've managed to hack
a share to get plain text to print but that's it..
What I want is to get Linux to print text and gfx (even PS) to this
printer but I've tried all the standard filters and they don't even
activate the thing.
Yes, I've read man pages and Howto's and searched for the info, but
no-one seems to want to even acknowledge its existance!
Can anyone please help?
I've about 12 years experience with computers (long enough to remember
installing SCO/Unix on and old 386 with 128 serial ports.....) and I can
program so don't be afraid to get technical with me! =)

Thanks in advance!
-Radan.

--ps, unless someone in SA has an old ATX power supply for cheap? =)
