Subject: Re: Linux as an NT Server replacement


First of I all I need to point out the Active directory (which is a feature
of Win2k not office 2k) has nothing to do with exchange (until exchange
2000 and win 2k comes out)
Active directory is windows trying to put all objects (computer related)
relating to your organisation into a easily accessable, replacatable (I
hope I spelt that right) and so forth.  it contains users, groups, settings
for machines and devices (ie printers), policys and odles and oodles of
stuff (most of course useless).
the LDAP extentions that MS has put into the AD is so that you can use your
active directory structure instead of using a seperate structure for LDAP.

&gt;In Linux 2.2 you do have to watch
&gt;the user count -- the limit is 16000 users (ie: not enough
&gt;to put every uni student into LDAP and authenticate from there).
&gt;Linux 2.4 will allow about a billion users, and the code has been
&gt;tested with 160,000 real user entries in LDAP.
According to MS there is no limit to the amount of objects in a domain (or
forrest as the MS dudes like to call it now), basically as long as you have
the HDD space the accomodate the AD it is limitless.

Please don't flame me for 'coming to MS's rescue' as I believe that
misinformation is as bad as no information.
my final comment is this (after playing with B3 and RC2): Win2k
SUX ---- -----  (I'll leave that to your imagination  :)
