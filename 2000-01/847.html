&gt; Yesterday I ordered a new workstation from Microbits in 
&gt; Adelaide. A good deal from a well established company.


I'd like to thank all those people who were kind enough to offer advice and
recommendations both on and off the list.

I did consider pursuing the matter with Microbits because I was pretty angry
with them for trying to push me into paying Microsoft for a second licence
for NT that I didn't need. But upon refection I decided that would have been
particularly stupid. What if I had been successful in pressuring them into
supplying me with a machine on my terms? I would then have been in the
position of dealing with a company that I had no confidence in.

A more sensible option is to take my business elsewhere.

Steve
