precisely. As such it is used as the internal conveyor in linux for porting
a print document around the network until printed. In every respect it's
purpose (under linux) is the same as GDI printing in windoze.

rather than develop umpty different input types for umpty different
printers (eg text, html, grafix, dvi, tex) to -&gt;lexmark, pci, bubblejet the
input types are all converted to postscript. Think up a new standard,
gobbldegook.asp, and you convert it, not to a pcl printer, but to
postscript. that way, people can concentrate solely on making a driver for
postscript to new-fangled printer rather than stuff about with 90 different
input formats.

Porting documents around is not the same thing (not that you said that),
Postrcript is the least likely candidate, it's sh*t, it's proprietary, and
it is *very* difficult to program in (steep reverse polish notation
learning curve). My guess is that html will become the defacto standard (if
it isn't already). It's not a question of 'goodness' but the sheer
convenience of transporting html accross any system, the readily available
viewers, and the just as readily available editors.

Of course, this is not the html that we know now, it is the later evolution
as it merges the 'fixed placement'  and presentation of documents inherent
in PDF, and to a lesser extent RTF. But I imagine, html is here to stay.
