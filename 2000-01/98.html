 &gt; &gt; What about Private Schools?

 &gt; At least some of them use the sa.edu.au domain. e.g. Annesley College.
 &gt; Anyone know of schools that don't?

sa.edu.au has nothing to do with the State Government's (very poorly
named) sa.edu service.

The solution to the filtering problem for schools involves two steps:

    (a) tell your ISP that you're now using filtering software, and
    (b) do nothing else.

The law covers ISPs and Internet Content Hosts;  It doesn't actually
impose any obligations on anyone who doesn't fit the definitions of
those terms.  If you tell your ISP that you're using filtering software
they'll be able to sit back, satisified that they're conforming to
the ABA-approved code of conduct, and you won't have to do anything.

That situation may change at some point in the next twelve months if
Alston decides that he wants to wave his willy around a bit to show
everyone how powerful he is;  he could pressure the ABA to revoke their
approval of the current Code, forcing the industry to come up with an
even more draconian one.  Even if he does that, though, there is 
no legal liability under the BSA on anyone who isn't an ISP or an ICH,
so feel free to lie your arses off to your ISPs so that they'll be able
to avoid filtering you.

Meanwhile, the BSA does foreshadow the idea that the states will be 
coming up with dovetailing laws to cover *users* of the Internet;  at
that point, schools (and everyone else) will need to start seriously
worrying...
