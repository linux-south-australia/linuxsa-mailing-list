&gt;&gt; Religious groups of all types have historically, as well as recently,
&gt;&gt; shown
&gt;&gt; a decided lack of respect for the views and sensitivities of non-believers
&gt;&gt; and other-believers.

This applies to any social groups: religion, race, politics, gender, 
operating system, big/little endian. It is the nature of our species to
blame those that are different.

&gt; As an atheist, I must agree that a lot of religious groups get severly
&gt; annoyed at non believers and will persist in trying to convert you

It is also the nature of enthusiasts (fanatics, extremists) to attempt to 
persuade those who are not enthusiastic about the same thing. For
example, I don't know why none of you are enthusiastic about
juggling. All non-jugglers should be persecuted, I say.


Stephen.
