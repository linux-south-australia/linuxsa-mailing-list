do you need real time linux? You can access the serial ports (as long as
you are running as root, or at least suid root) from normal C(++) code.

real time linux gives the ability to do *hard* scheduling. So if you
need the ability to *garantee* that some part of your code is run every
certain number of milliseconds (+/- a couple of micro-seconds) then you
need RT-linux. Typically this is done if you are doing some analogure to
digital conversion.

If ytou simply need to read the byte of the serial port, then you can do
this under normal linux.

An interesting point: When you write stuff for RT-linux, you are writing
a kernel module. This shouldn't freak you out too much, just have to
follow a template and adhere some rules, and do without somethings.
(like no printf, malloc etc)
