<H1>MONITOR (Card) Problems</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
I recently bought two new toys for my computer:

1) A monitor which claims it will do 72 hsync and 110 vsync

2) A Vide Excel i740 AGP card

My problem is this:

I have downloaded XFree86 3.3.5 which has a driver for this exact card.
I have used XF86Setup to set the silly thing up and it actually works.
However almost randomly it decides that the scroll bars in GNOME and
everything else is going to have the lovely ripple effect (especially at
1025x768)..the fix is to adjust the taller and shorter in xvidtune until
it stops it. 

However, once you've stopped it, it will work for that session. If I get
on a game such as StarCraft which is video intensive it suddenly decides
it needs adjusting again. Even though it was working (before reboot into
windows) perfectly.

My monitor reports sensible readings (80.56 vsync and 70.03 hsync) which
are both well within its range. This AGP card claims it can do 1280x800
or even 1600x1200 at a push...I just can't quite work out what might be
wrong.
