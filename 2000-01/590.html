Netscape: well, that was fun...

Thanks to those who tried to help. When I have the time and inclination
(or when Netscape pisses me off sufficiently) I will attempt to
re-install 4.7, and if that fails, return to 4.5 (yerg!) or 4.61 (which
I recall having bugs galore, too, but that's what we have come to expect
from AOL^H^H^HNetscape... What I was really hoping for was an option in
preferences that I had overlooked... something like "turn off random bug
generation" or "enable usability mode"...

Oh well...

Thanks also to those who replied to my colleague's request for help wiht
his RT system. He's decided to take the plunge and use "a real operating
system" (his words), and take the effort to port his software across as
needed... or run it in a dos emulator in the meantime... Anyway, thanks
all... Hopefully the Netscape thread will die a peaceful death before
escalating into a conflict about something pointless :)
