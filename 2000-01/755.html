this is a think the harshest thing I have read in a long time.

&gt; &gt;I'm tired of people whinging about how difficult
&gt; &gt;unix is, and how expensive the training is, and how hard it is to find good
&gt; &gt;help.  Damn it, help is not hard to find.  It's right there under
&gt; &gt;everyones' noses.  The source is freely available, as are man pages, howtos
&gt; &gt;and info.  If that's not enough then perhaps the problem is stupidity, or
&gt; &gt;rank laziness.  Often it's the latter.
&gt; 
&gt; That sure sounds like a flame to me.  Perhaps I am too stupid or too lazy
&gt; to properly interpret your intentions.
&gt; 
&gt; Without going further, please examine my sig.  Do you REALLY think a person
&gt; with the sort of background I MUST have to occupy the position I do even
&gt; suggests the possibility of stupidity or laziness?  Do you REALLY think
&gt; that the proportion of lazy and stupid newbies is high enough to justify
&gt; your comments?
&gt; 
&gt; You would be better occupied keeping your big mouth shut.  You have already
&gt; exposed yourself as a fool.
