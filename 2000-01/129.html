&gt; 
&gt; I think the original scriptures never said she was a virgin.  The 
&gt; word that was used translates just as well as unmarried woman.  The
&gt; church apparently decided that being unmarried wasn't special enough
&gt; and they instigated the (incorrect) interpretation of virgin.

Wow - now *THIS* is flamewar material :)

Who says the scriptures existed in the first place?  And if they
definitely did, who said they're right at all?  Who says they weren't
written by some guy(s) as a joke?

I have an idea :)  Let's write some scriptures of our own now, and in
2000 years' time everyone can argue about their validity on a mailing
list about something else.  Let's make Linus the God (just to keep
this thread /slightly/ linux-related) and Tux the Jesus.

Sound good?
