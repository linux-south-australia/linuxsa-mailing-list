Ha Ha Ha Ha......  That'll teach ya.

I actually managed to get IE 3.02 to run under WINE! It was fine locally, but
don't let it try to access the LAN. Stupid browsers. We should all use lynx. It's
quick and has many, many features.

Which version of IE was it?

IE 4 and 5 both replace the Windows kernel during the install. It really wouldn't
surprise me to find that it was trying to 'rm -f /vmlinuz' or 'cp user.exe
/vmlinuz'. He He He He.
