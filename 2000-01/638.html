<H1>Is there interest in a Samba course or two in Adelaide</H1>

Hi,

I am trying to find out how much interest there would be in running a
couple of Samba courses here in Adelaide.

Having been involved in writing two Samba books (and finding it possible to
write some 400 pages in this last book :-), I think I am well qualified to
give such courses.  I am also giving a Samba tutorial in Singapore in
March, and have given one in Sydney last July at SAGE-AU.

I propose, if there is sufficient interest, running one or both of the
following here in Adelaide some time in Feb or Mar, or at any other time
there is interest.

1. An introduction to Samba.  See below for outline.

2. Samba, a more advanced course.  See below for outline.

I would organize a venue, provide a PC per delegate, as well as other
amenities for the day.  I would also provide course notes.

IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST, PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL AND TELL ME WHICH
COURSE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN.  I will summarize after a few days.

OUTLINES

1. An introduction to Samba.

In this one-day course, we will provide an intermediate-level introduction
to Samba.  It is designed to bring you up to speed with Samba quickly, so
you can be more productive in building Samba servers and know a lot more
about what you are doing.

We assume that delegates have some experience with Linux and Win9x and WinNT.

The course will use a combined lecture and hands-on format, with
approximately half your time being spent in hands-on activities.

We will divide the day up into four segments:

a. An introduction to Samba and the functions of an SMB server.  
 
   Here, we will explain what an SMB server does, how Windows clients and 
   Samba use TCP/IP to establish communication between each other, and what
   shares are, how you use them, etc.

b. How Samba provides security and how it provides access to shares.

   Here, we will explain what is perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of
   Samba.  You will come away knowing how Samba mediates access to files for
   users and how to provide access and restrict access.  We will also 
   explain the use of encrypted passwords

c. Advanced topics in share access. 

   Here we will look at advanced topics, like providing guest access, 
   running scripts when people access a share, using Macros in your
   smb.conf file, and so on.

d. Troubleshooting Samba problems.

   Here we will look at an approach to troubleshooting problems with Samba
   and look at common problems that occur in Samba.  We will ground it in 
   an overview of the SMB protocol and look at packet traces as a way to 
   perform some types of troubleshooting.

2. Samba, a more advanced course.

In this one-day course we will look at using Samba in ever more complex
environments. 

We assume that delegates have installed Samba before and have set up a
share for a few users.

The course will use a combines lecture and hands-on with about half your
time being spent in hands-on activities.

We will take an advanced view and illustrate the SMB protocol by looking at
packet traces with Ethereal.  Our focus will be to provide delegates with
enough information that they can resolve problems for themselves.

We will split the day into four segments.  These segments will deal with:

a. Setting up Samba as a logon server for Win9X clients and dynamically 
   generating logon scripts.

   Here, we will look at the Win9X logon process and contrast it with a 
   Win NT logon process.  We will explore what configuration is needed to
   support Win9X logons, and how to dynamically generate logon scripts.

b. Setting up virtual servers under Samba and using Samba as a profiles
server, 
   including roaming profiles for Win9X.

   Here we will look at how to set up Samba virtual servers, and why you might
   use them.  We will show how you can keep your profiles in a sub-directory
   the home directory, and will look at policies.

c. Troubleshooting Samba problems, and setting up Samba for browsing.

   Here we will examine browsing in some detail and look at how you can set 
   up Samba to do cross subnet browsing, and how to debug browsing problems.

   We will also look at a troubleshooting approach and look at many of the 
   common problems, and how you can simulate them, so you can recognize
   them.

d. Setting up Samba as a domain controller using Samba TNG and serving
Windows 
   NT and 2000 clients.

   Here, we will set up Samba TNG and then use it to set up a domain with 
   Samba as a PDC, Samba as a BDC, with NT and Win2000 clients.
