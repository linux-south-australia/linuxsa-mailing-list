I find it interesting that people compare MacOS with Linux and Windows 9x
with Linux as far as ease of use is concerned. How can OSs that are as
different as these be compared? Linux isn't really designed to do what Windows
does, and by the same token Linux is _definately_ not designed to do what
Windows attempts to do.

    I think that most people think Windows is easier to learn/use because of
the way the user is shielded from the OS by the GUI. This results in a
so-called "easy to use OS", but also becomes very restrictive. It appears easy
to use because most of the tricky or potentially confusing parts are hidden
from the user.

    Linux on the other hand is totally opposite - everything is right there for
users to play with, without the "user friendly" OS holding their hand the whole
way.

    I feel that the people who find Linux not very user friendly are still
adjusting to the differences between windows and linux. I have been there - for
about 6 months i struggled to do anything useful in linux, but after i took the
time to sit down and read some of the documentation I began to achieve
something useful. This list has been very helpful when I didn't know where to
look, and usually when someone suggested something, even if it wasn't entirely
what i was after, i could often find the right way on my own.

    I guess it is just important to remember that sometimes Linux can be
confusing to beginners, especially if the user is used to something like MacOS
or Windows, and tolerance and a guiding hand will probably bring better results
than derogatory posts.
