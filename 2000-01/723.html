&gt;Remember that this is a User group.  Which includes &lt;HOME&gt;-User,

&gt;User and &lt;PROFESSIONAL&gt;-User (and many others who I can't think of at 
&gt;the moment).  Some things will be revelent and available to some types of
&gt;users, others won't.

That says it all, I think.

&gt;Richard has my support for what he has done and offererd to the group

So he should, IMHO.

&gt;if someone wants to do something targetted at the HOME-User, then they
&gt;will have my full support as well.

In an effort to gain something positive from an unfortunate beginning, may
I suggest that Paul is expressing frustration that GNU/Linux is very
difficult for the neophyte to get to know, and that the beginner level of
help is quite hard to find.
I would VERY much welcome the sort of course Paul wants, and I reckon such
a course would have a worthwhile attendance.
That said, IF I had the financial resources I'd grab Richard's courses with
both hands.
