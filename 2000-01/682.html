Hi,

Based on the interest expressed in the Samba course I have outlined, I
propose to run the following two courses:

1. 17-Feb-2000, An introduction to Samba.  See below for details.

2. 18-Feb-2000, Samba, a more advanced course.  See below for outline.

The Venue is Enterprise House, Greenhill road.

The course costs are $395 per day, with discounts available for
organizations sending three or more people to one course, and also for
those doing both courses.

To enrol, please send your details via email to me.  

If you have a problem with the dates, but would really like to go, please
contact me via email, and we will see whether or not we can change the
course dates or run the course again.

OUTLINES

1. An introduction to Samba.

In this one-day course, we will provide an intermediate-level introduction
to Samba.  It is designed to bring you up to speed with Samba quickly, so
you can be more productive in building Samba servers and know a lot more
about what you are doing.

We assume that delegates have some experience with Linux and Win9x and WinNT.

The course will use a combined lecture and hands-on format, with
approximately half your time being spent in hands-on activities.

We will divide the day up into four segments:

a. An introduction to Samba and the functions of an SMB server.  
 
   Here, we will explain what an SMB server does, how Windows clients and 
   Samba use TCP/IP to establish communication between each other, and what
   shares are, how you use them, etc.

b. How Samba provides security and how it provides access to shares.

   Here, we will explain what is perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of
   Samba.  You will come away knowing how Samba mediates access to files for
   users and how to provide access and restrict access.  We will also 
   explain the use of encrypted passwords

c. Advanced topics in share access. 

   Here we will look at advanced topics, like providing guest access, 
   running scripts when people access a share, using Macros in your
   smb.conf file, and so on.

d. Troubleshooting Samba problems.

   Here we will look at an approach to troubleshooting problems with Samba
   and look at common problems that occur in Samba.  We will ground it in 
   an overview of the SMB protocol and look at packet traces as a way to 
   perform some types of troubleshooting.

2. Samba, a more advanced course.

In this one-day course we will look at using Samba in ever more complex
environments. 

We assume that delegates have installed Samba before and have set up a
share for a few users.

The course will use a combines lecture and hands-on with about half your
time being spent in hands-on activities.

We will take an advanced view and illustrate the SMB protocol by looking at
packet traces with Ethereal.  Our focus will be to provide delegates with
enough information that they quickly can resolve problems for themselves.

We will split the day into four segments.  These segments will deal with:

a. Setting up Samba as a logon server for Win9X clients and dynamically 
   generating logon scripts.

   Here, we will look at the Win9X logon process and contrast it with a 
   Win NT logon process.  We will explore what configuration is needed to
   support Win9X logons, and how to dynamically generate logon scripts.

b. Setting up virtual servers under Samba and using Samba as a profiles
server, 
   including roaming profiles for Win9X.

   Here we will look at how to set up Samba virtual servers, and why you might
   use them.  We will show how you can keep your profiles in a sub-directory
   the home directory, and will look at policies.

c. Troubleshooting Samba problems, and setting up Samba for browsing.

   Here we will examine browsing in some detail and look at how you can set 
   up Samba to do cross subnet browsing, and how to debug browsing problems.

   We will also look at a troubleshooting approach and look at many of the 
   common problems, and how you can simulate them, so you can recognize
   them.

d. Setting up Samba as a domain controller using Samba TNG and serving
Windows 
   NT and 2000 clients.

   Here, we will set up Samba TNG and then use it to set up a domain with 
   Samba as a PDC, Samba as a BDC, with NT and possibly, Win2000 clients.
