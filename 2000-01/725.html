Hi,

&gt;       I am still running RedHat 5.2 on kernel-2.0.36-0.7
&gt; I am going to upgrade to RedHat 6.1  Is it recommended that I reinstall from 
&gt; scratch or just download the proper rpms and install them and things should 
&gt; be fine?  I visited upgrades.redhat.com and wasn't sure where the rpms would 
&gt; be in.  Am supposed to look in the 5.2 directory or in the 6.1  Which one 
&gt; contains the files that I need?
&gt; And what are the logical steps to follow, other than backing up my data?

I have taken both upgrade paths, and either can work depending on current
system configuration, and available HDD space.

Firstly, get yourself a CD if you can, it'll make things easier (you can
obtain from netcraft if you lack other sources).

Method 1..

If your system is highly customised, try an locate all the cusomisation
files, they should all get backed up anyway.
Run the RPM program to find out what packages you have installed.
Boot up with RH6.1, and upgrade.
Make sure the slocate package is installed.
Manually run the update database program.
Locate all the backup files.
Transfer all extra data from old to new files.
Enjoy system.

This can fall over if you have compiled binaries replaced by RPMS.

Method 2...
If you have lots of spare disk space, and a less highly configured
system. Create a tarchive or a copy of your
/etc,/sbin,/usr,/lib,/var,/boot directories somewhere else, then chose a
fresh install, onto a clean hard drive, then restor what files you need
back from your backup.

Hope this helps

cya
