Hi - got given a Pentium M/B with a "problem" - initially on bootup
first thing i saw was "NVRAM Failure" - next error msg was CMOS Battery
is gerstuvdt... press F1 for SETUP - got into setup - set up params &
save/exit - whammy - NVRAM Failure then CMOS Battery dead PRESS F1 for
SETUP - loop de loop! Not saving when I exited setup allowed the thing
to continue BUT next error was CMOS Battery dead - defaults loaded - and
the defaults were NONE for all 4 hdds & NONE for FLOPPIES :(  To cut a
very long saga short, I tried BIOS chips from some stuffed Pentium m/b's
til I found one that was set to AUTO-DETECT HDD's (sadly also set to
1.25Mb Floppy)!. 
The ODIN RTC/BATTERY (appears to be same as a DALLAS) is obviously dead
BUT its hardsoldered directly onto the M/B & I cant get it out!
(SOLDERING IRON TIP is TOOOOOO BIG)

SO&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does anyone know how to add BATTERY POWER to a Pentium Board with
NO external battery jumpers??
CAN I "add" some volts to pins 24 (vcc) & 12 (gnd) under the board with
out destroying something??????
WHAT happens to a pentium m/b if it has NO RTC (ie/ if I destroy the RTC
part of the thing??)

I have managed to get it to boot a 400Mb hdd with an old RH LINUX on it
- but I still have to press F1 etc etc to get there and I cant easily
install anything without a floppy drive etc etc
As to why I want to do this .... cos I can :) 
TIA, Phil
