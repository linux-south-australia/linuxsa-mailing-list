&gt; That sure sounds like a flame to me.  Perhaps I am too stupid or too lazy
&gt; to properly interpret your intentions.
&gt; 
&gt; Without going further, please examine my sig.  Do you REALLY think a person
&gt; with the sort of background I MUST have to occupy the position I do even
&gt; suggests the possibility of stupidity or laziness?  Do you REALLY think
&gt; that the proportion of lazy and stupid newbies is high enough to justify
&gt; your comments?

I was just wondering why you assumed that David's comments were
directed at you personally? I don't see any post from you recently
that suggests that you are lazy or stupid? 

(This is a genuine question BTW, I'm not wearing any flame proof clothes at
the moment)

&gt; You would be better occupied keeping your big mouth shut.  You have already
&gt; exposed yourself as a fool.

I'll leave this one for David.

Cheers

Alex!
