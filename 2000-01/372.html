Hi,

&gt; Besides the fact I'm still having trouble installing due to what appear to be
&gt; device mounting problems according to support form Linux central -what is
&gt; silly is that as a student using camtech internet service providing to get
&gt; access from home, I'm not only limited to Windows but have to use Explorer as
&gt; well.

Not using camtech myself, I couldn't say for certain, but I find it hard
to believe that they could force you to use one platform and one web
browser without highly customised (more than AOL) software. The might not
supply install disks for the alternatives, but anyone with a little
knowledge could probably work it out.

But of course every student uses windows, there isn't anything else is
there !

What is interesting here, is that Camtech was created by Adelaide Uni CS
Graduates, who are Unix trained, and was setup from the Apple and Sun
Shop, which was Mac based. For a long time Camtech internet had employees
that were Mac people, definitly when the contract for Uni dial up went
out. I am surprised that they have now limited it to one platform.

I must visit the web site again !!

cya
