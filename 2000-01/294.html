Hey all,

Whilst some of this thread is partly boring, I am not that interested in
theology, I feel it's a nice diversion to learn about the other people on
this list.


&gt; Religious groups of all types have historically, as well as recently,
shown
&gt; a decided lack of respect for the views and sensitivities of non-believers
&gt; and other-believers.  The Gnostics found this out to their detriment a
long
&gt; time ago, and we have plenty of examples over time of other religious
&gt; groups being less than tolerant, including some Hindus towards some rather
&gt; zealous Christians in India recently.
&gt;

As an atheist, I must agree that a lot of religious groups get severly
annoyed at non believers and will persist in trying to convert you and will
not leave you alone, basically you must slam the door in their faces at
times or turn and walk away (sometimes run). I am not bashing religious
groups, if you want to spend your time this way, good for you, I will treat
you like I treat everyone, the SAME, I will not try to convert you to
atheism..... I hate the implication that I am 100% wrong and they are 100%
correct...

I could go on, but there is no need.

Please everyone, enjoy the thread, if it dies, it dies...

&lt;get's off soapbox&gt;

Rob.
