The motherboard is definantly your problem !

The MSI-Athlon board (in particular the AMD chipset) is very dodgy with
video cards. I had the exact same problems with Riva TNT-2's on this same
board in windows. In the end I gave up on using TNT-2's on this board. The
other cards which are really dodgy on these boards are S3 Savage based
boards. All 3DFX cards run beatifully on the board however !

Kevin!

&gt; We tested these cards from legend and found them the equal of any other
&gt; with the same chipset yet Legend has them priced waaay over the top
&gt; A major problem we found with them is that they do not seem to get on at
&gt; all with the Legend Mainboards that use the K7 (Athlon) Processor.

Oh :-(

I am on a MSI-6167, ATHLON k7 Board using PC100 (generic branded)
memory. In addition to the card I have:

1) Ethernet Card (EP-325)

Windows likes it and so does linux

2) Creative Sound PCI64 Card

Windows and Linux like it

They are on totally different IRQs and don't seem to be causing any
conflict. I really can't work out what the problem is because Linux
XFree86-3.5.5 likes it...and with my past history with X, X is
extraordinarily finnicky about the hardware.
