&gt; &gt; Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeeell - I agree it takes some getting used to, but if you know how to
&gt; &gt; &gt; use it, it can be pretty cool. My only gripe is that some information is
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated with different detail levels....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; My gripe is that your options for searching and refining are limited. You
&gt; &gt; can't back track through search levels. This would be a REALLY useful
&gt; &gt; feature.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A web page interface wouldn't be hard to write, and there are free index
&gt; &gt; programs for PC that could interface with it. They've already got most of
&gt; &gt; it done on their web site. It wouldn't take much to produce a CD version.
&gt;
&gt; on the same topic - are there any GPL indexing software out there? I
&gt; wouldn't be surprised if there is alread one on my system.
&gt;
&gt; What I want is a program (like `locate`) which when I run a maintenance
&gt; program (like `updatedb`) it will create an searchable index of the text
&gt; in the files of some directory.
&gt;
&gt; Then you could run those searches like "string 1" && "string 2" && !
&gt; "string 3"
&gt;
&gt; that would be cool.
&gt;
&gt; Then - if it took off, all the websites around the place would use it
&gt; and we would achieve total world domination! mwa ah ah ah.

Try looking at htdig. I'm unsure of the URL, but there's search engines out
there. The brief (very brief) look I had looked OK.
