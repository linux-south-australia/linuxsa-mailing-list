I can't agree.

UNIX lacks consistency.  Alt-W closes a window in Netscape,
but not in Applix (which wants to use the Ctrl key).

Single-unit system administration is a crock.  Linuxconf
does this, but not the other.  If you use it on Samba or
sendmail you'll probably end up trashing things rather
than configuring them.  And the command line isn't
much better -- it seems that none of the files in /etc
have a common format.

Compared to the Mac, Linux is a user interface disaster zone.

I'm not saying that this is the way things have to be,
and I'm not saying that there aren't people working on
fixing the UI, but I am saying that the currently shipping
distributions need serious UI work to simply not to look
embarrasing.

What Linux does do wonderfully is large-count system administration
and provides a marvellous programming platform.

So it's great if you want hundreds of solid desktops, all
remotely and administered.

And it's good if you want to run something where the quality
of the program environment matters -- servers and experimental
applications spring to mind.

But the major advantage of Linux is simply its minicomputer
heritage.  Multiuser, multitasking, memory protection and
so on are all designed in.  Compare this to Windows, which
has grown up from microcomputer OSs and where multiuser
operation is still very dodgy.  Or the Mac, where they've
just got true multitasking.  Linux simply does the OS basics
very well, and this shines through for some applications.

Unfortunately, the infighting of the UNIX vendors and their
"I can do this better" wheel-reinventing attitude is also the
major reason for the horrible UI.

And at the moment, these vendors are holding us back.  Linuxconf
would work heaps better if the appropiate parts were maintained
by Sendmail Inc or the Samba Team.  But because Linuxconf hasn't
been picked up by other UNIX vendors, those groups have to provide
alternative (and thus inconsistent) graphical administration tools.
