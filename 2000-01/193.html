Well, if you meant the first statement, they made us study the
Airbus and the Xray machine that toasted people in Software
Engineering School (=UniSA, some subject).  I have a friend
who flew on one back from Melbourne, and apparently had to
spend half the trip in darkness because some computer had
crashed and they couldn't reboot it until they were safely on
the ground ("B*llsh&t or Not?  You be the judge!").

If you meant the second statement, it's a frivolous quote from
elsewhere (spot the quote and win a free packet of indifference)
(no Mark Newtons are eligible for this competition).
