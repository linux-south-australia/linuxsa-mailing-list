&gt;VMS has a remarkably consistent and good text interface, so much so
&gt;that it is invariably copied by vendors that need a command line
&gt;(such as on routers).

Hmmm, I have been in contact with people who contend that the Cisco command
syntax is more like the TOPS-10/20 command syntax, and for good reason.
Something to do with a certain engineer transferring from DEC to some
educational institution in the US and then to some router manufacturer ...

Seems money changed hands over that one.  But then, it seems that MS paid
heaps of money to Digital over a similar event.  Perhaps Digital should
have asked for recompense for other events as well :-)

&gt;Regards,
