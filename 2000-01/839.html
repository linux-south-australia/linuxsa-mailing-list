  1)   Dont like the clients that are already arround? Hack together you own
:)
  I was experimenting with a new one myself (when i had some free time heh)
and its
  quite a flexable server communication language.
One of my freinds put togther some simple shell scripts to dial and check
wether there ppp link at home was up or to  bring it up for his mother, so
there would be a link on here desktop to the web page she clicks on that
which loads of the local webserver on the dialout box clicks a button and it
akes te machine dialout

  2)

  Otherwise if you got the need for slowness in DNS resolution you can
  go to all the effort of making an internal domain in BIND for yourself.
Yuck! :)

There are some advantages i feel to running your own DNS server, it being a
cacheing nameserver if you have a number of machines on the internal network
point them all at it once one mahcine has looked up one a address its kept
in cache so lookups will be faster.

 Also when you add a new machine or decide to change the names of your
machine you have to change the hosts files on all th mahcines even on small
number of mahcines  this takes time. running your own dns changes a couple
of files restart and all machine see the the new chanes.

Last but least it makes it slightly easier in sendmail to allow mailing out,
specify one domain instead of  the ips of your different computers.
