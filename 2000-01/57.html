My final comment(s) on the Millenium ;)

1) Andrew, you get 10/10 for your research.
2) I think you are all wrong & Andrew is right & the millenium was in
1994 and that still doesnt account for my "Papal Tardis" theory btw.
3) I'll bet the Romans in 4BC didnt know it was 4BC
4) If JC was born in 4BC or 2BC then  it wasnt 4BC or 2BC cos he was
born
5) I still want to know where the other 32 years went between BC & AD -
AND ANDREW - I do not see why anno domini can not be "roughly"
translated to mean "after JC died" I see no data in your research to
contradict my translation ;)
6)AND another thing... if AD is latin then BC should also be so...
Beforo Christo or something similiar
7) After much deliberation based on the evidence before me, I have
concluded that the Millenium actually occurred in August 1963
a) 2000 - 32years we lost between BC & AD = 1968
b) 1968 - 4years cos Herod was dead in 4bc approx = 1964
c) 4 months cos Pope Gregory entered the Papal Tardis & whizzed forward
4 months or so
d) The square root of the hippopotamus is equal to something beginning
with 3
I find it really rude that some ppl have trivialised this thread in an
effort to stop it :)

I am going to bed ...night all
