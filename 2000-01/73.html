Heyas
I've got some bits n pieces that are going to get thrown out soon if I
don't sell them or give them away. ;(
I need a new ATX power supply though. And a 10/100 network card would be
nice too. ;)

I have:

2 DEC VT320 dumb terminals. As dumb terminals go, these ones are pretty
good. Loads of different emulation settings, etc. in the options menus.
Works perfectly with Linux.

A Sun SparcPrinter laser printer. Needs a new developer cartridge. Maybe
someone can use it for parts?

An IBM RS/6000 desktop server, needs a SCSI harddrive and some 72pin RAM
to work. If you've got one, you could use it for parts? Or if you've got
the hardware needed to finish it, then make it into a cheap server. Dual
processor, model 7012.

Several graphics tablets, PS/2 connectors.

A 15" monitor that doesn't display green properly. Runs hi-res, etc.
fine though, so if you don't mind the colours, it's good for a server or
something.

and probably some AT keyboards, used.

If you're interested in any of the above, let me know!
I've also got another 15" monitor that works fine, but I'm not giving it
away. I'll sell it for about 50-80 $, but I'd like to replace it with a
17" or 19" monitor, so if anyone wants to sell one of those secondhand,
please let me know. 

Hope someone finds these things of use,
Toby
