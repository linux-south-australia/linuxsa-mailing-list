Hi Nathan.

&gt;              is there anyone else out there who uses TPG as their ISP.
&gt;I am trying to get the internet working but each time I dial up, the
&gt;connection tones complete and then the connection is severed about 10
&gt;seconds later. Is TPG detecting this as a Unix/Linux connection and
&gt;refusing it? (This question because I am not sure if TPG allows a shell
&gt;type access)

I've just been browsing the TPG web pages and they don't specify any
help for a Linux connection that I can see. This doesn't mean you
won't be able to connect using Linux though.

I'd be willing to bet that they don't offer shell accounts. 

I reckon the type of account you're looking at setting up will be a
PAP type PPP account.  I think the netcfg program you have already
used will let you setup one of these.

The /var/log/messages file on your machine will probably give you some
idea about what was happening when you tried to connect.
