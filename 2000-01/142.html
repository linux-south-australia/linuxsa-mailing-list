&gt;On the subject of the political significance of
&gt;the net censorship, I think that the government

Scapegoating a group is precisely the game the control freaks play.
PLEASE avoid using it yourself (even by accident).
ALL SORTS of people are being hoodwinked, many of them fine conscientious,
morally upright, and even intelligent and thoughtful, citizens. 

&gt;I think the real point is that the govt wants
&gt;to assert sovereignty over the net.
&gt;It was a domain over which they had no control,
&gt;and they wanted to control it.

Of course.  A free citizenry with access to worldwide information networks
cannot be subject to the thought police.

&gt;The weakness of the argument of protecting the
&gt;kids is no accident. It isn't govt stupidity.
&gt;They know it won't work, but in the meantime,
&gt;they have made the Internet bow down before them.
&gt;This will make future control easier.

Again, how obvious - and how strange (?) that our Murdoch and Packer
dominated media have not raised a public outcry about it.

&gt;The same goes for the GST. It increases govt 
&gt;monitoring of the economy enormously.

IMHO, not so much monitoring of the economy as CONTROL of people.

&gt;Similarly, forcing the unemployed to do boring
&gt;work is an assertion of sovereignty

Of course.  Work for the dole now, work for less pay OR the dole, later.

&gt;I remember every clearly that when Gough's
&gt;free education was unwound by Fraser and Howard,
&gt;they started by making overseas students pay more.
&gt;Very few complained. Then they made the postgrads
&gt;pay more. And no one complained. Then they made the
&gt;postgrad diploma students pay more. And few complained.
&gt;Because they thought it wouldn't affect _them_.
&gt;And then they made all tertiary students pay more.
&gt;But that was just the tertiary students.

and so on ...
Problem: people will not act to protect OTHER PEOPLE'S FREEDOM or rights.
Then - too late - they find they have lost their own.
I have a particular interest in education.  However, I was particularly
angered by the deliberate criminalisation of law-abiding citizens (to hide
abominable mental health facilities and irresponsible inactivity by police
and neighbours) inherent in the gun buy-back scheme.  WHY did only
gun-owners protest?
Do the majority of our population want a society in which we are all free
do do anything we like, provided it is approved-of by government?
Would most people be prepared to have Linux banned, in favour of
'approved', guaranteed non-subversive M$ software?
Could we use the Internet (while we still have it) to stir people in
Australia on the dangers of totalitarianism?
