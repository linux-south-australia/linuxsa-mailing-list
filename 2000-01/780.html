Hi

It would seem Richard has accepted the challenge and donated even more of
his time and expertise to the newbie community.

It also seems someone with an interest in helping the newbies on this list
could transform this information, already provided, free of charge, into a
resource for the new bunch of newbies that will find this list.

It would not be too hard to (with Richards permission of course) construct a
navigatable www page with all these (free) "lessons" on it. The maintainer
of this site could even write his/her own "lessons" to add to the list. You
never know if this maintainer was really keen (and didn't alienate everyone
else) a (free) online course could be developed from it.

The LinuxSA site has had the same few hints and tips on it for years that
could be the ideal place to host this resource. This is no reflection on
those who wrote the initial hints and tips at all just sounds like the ideal
place to put it.


Here is a challenge for some concerned person. A chance to do something
positive and beneficial for the newbie user before these postings become
lost in the archives.


Cheers


Kevin Hancock

&gt; UNIX had the concept of IO redirection long before DOS copied and
&gt; bastardized the concept.  The UNIX IO redirection concept if fundamental
to
&gt; many of the things that you can do with UNIX, and it is quite a
&gt; well-developed idea, so we will explore this concept here.
