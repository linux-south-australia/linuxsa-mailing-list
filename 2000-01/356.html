&gt; Greetings,
&gt;
&gt; I have done a new RH6.1 install onto the second hard drive of a PC also
&gt; running WindozeNT on HD 1. Having carefully read several HOWTOs, it seems
&gt; that lilo can boot WinNT on HDD 1 whilst residing on HDD 2.
&gt;
&gt; The install of RH froze shortly prior to the completion of the install
&gt; (the performing of the post install procedures, before
&gt; creating the rescue disk). Rebooting, boots to lilo, then to linux, but I
&gt; get a Kernel panic, unable to mount the root FS.
&gt;
&gt; Since this install is just for mucking around with, the kernel panic is
&gt; noat a problem at the moment now, but Lilo is. I tried using the NT
&gt; install disk to restore the MBR (NT is on an NTFS partition taking the
&gt; entire first HDD), but it didn't, so I get out with the handy LinuxCare
&gt; boot CD ROM, and after remounting the HDD in RW mode, edit /etc/lilo.conf
&gt; to add in an entery for Win NT on the primary HDD.
&gt;
&gt; I then go to run lilo to intialise the canges using the following
&gt; command. HDb1 is my linux partiton, and mounted on the linuxcare disk as
&gt; /mnt/0
&gt;
&gt; lilo -C /mnt/0/etc/lilo.conf -m /mnt/0/boot/map -r /mnt/0 -i /mnt/0/boot/boot.b
&gt;
&gt; The lilo man page seems to indicate that that is the correct format of the
&gt; command, however when I run it (or variations), I get the error message
&gt;
&gt; /mnt/0/etc/lilo.conf: No such file or directory
&gt;
&gt; Adding a -t -v to it, only gives the lilo version (21).
&gt;
&gt; What is happening here ? It is important to be able to boot NT for the
&gt; moment. How do I fix this, or restore the MBR ?

I think it's actually telling you that it can't find a file specified in the
/mnt/0/etc/lilo.conf. Is there anything in there that it can't access? Remember
devices are files in Unix, so if your boot CD doesn't have these set up the same,
it won't work.

Restoring the boot sector is easy with your local friendly DOS boot disk and
FDISK /MBR. It even leaves your data on the disk. NT should still boot (NT is the
second worst operating system to dual boot - Slowaris being the first. Neither
like any partition tables being touched much).

Hope it helps....

Matt
