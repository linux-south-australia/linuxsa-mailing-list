&gt; &gt; I think HTML is the way to go, or maybe RTF.  PDF really annoys me.
&gt; &gt; Recently I had to uninstall Acrobat Reader 4 and then install
&gt; &gt; Acrobat Reader 3 since the PDF file had a password/encryption method
&gt; &gt; that was only supported by version 3. (this was on my windows
&gt; &gt; machine though). I also think that Acrobat is hard to read on the
&gt; &gt; screen. Maybe plain text is the way to go so nobody can complain.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't recall a recent distribution of linux that _doesn't_ come with
&gt; a .pdf viewer of some description?

But not everybody runs linux - isn't the idea here to try to pick a good
universal standard for documents issued by govt departments etc?  But, as
somebody pointed out earlier, this could be a fruitless exercise.

For the record, I think HTML is a pain in the butt when it comes to
formatting.  You just /can't/ make an HTML document look the same as a PDF
or a DVI or even a DOC.  HTML is great for some applications - but, IMO,
not for tender requests, job descriptions, resumes etc etc.

*idle thought* I wonder if it's possible to make modules for MS Word that
allow you to change the format under the Document Type box in the Save As
dialogue?  Can you make custom input/output filters for Word?  If so, is
there one for DVI or PDF?

Nick.
