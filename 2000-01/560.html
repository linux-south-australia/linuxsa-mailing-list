Hello Subba,

My favorite for showing ASCII characters outside the normal range
is "cat -vet" , it can be used with a filename or tacked on the
end of a previous command with a pipe "|".

Your symptoms sound very much like a Y2K problem I experienced.  My
machine stopped during reboot.  The last message it issued concerned
mounting filesystems but that was not where the problem came from.
When I finally convinced myself that the mounts were working, I traced
the boot process to a script that set the hardware clock.  Point I'm
making: if you don't find the fault in the script you suspect, try
running the ones after it!

For those interested in my Y2K problem: the script in question was 
running a command like "hwclock --adjust $GMT" ; this even crashed my
PC when run from the keyboard.  The hwclock man page described that if
/dev/rtc didn't exist, then the program would go straight to the
hardware, the work-around was to hide /dev/rtc .  I have subsequently
downloaded the latest version of hwclock and upgraded my kernel from
2.0.34 to 2.2.13 expecting that this would fix it, but it DIDN'T!
The problem first appeared on the morning of 31 December 1999, a Y2K
diagnostic program reports both the hardware and BIOS as compliant.
Work-around still in place.

&gt;
&gt;During the system bootup, the init script /etc/rc.d/rc.M is partially executed.
&gt;The last 3rd of the file does not get executed. When I run those remaining commands
&gt;manually, they work fine. Why is that happening?
&gt;
&gt;Assuming there are some hidden characters in the rc.M file, I deleted the problem
&gt;portion of the file, and retyped them. That did not help either. If there are some
&gt;hidden characters in a text file, how do I find them out?
&gt;
&gt;Thank you in advance.
&gt;
&gt;Subba Rao

Regards,
