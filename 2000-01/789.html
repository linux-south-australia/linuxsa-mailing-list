<H1>Buying a workstation</H1>

<PRE>
Yesterday I ordered a new workstation from Microbits in Adelaide. A good 
deal from a well established company.

My current machine is a 120 Pentium with a wonky monitor or video card. The 
O/S on this machine is NT 4.0. So the plan is to format the disc and 
install Linux on this machine.

That leaves me with an unused legitimate copy of NT 4.0 that I paid for a 
while ago. So I specified that I would supply Microbits with the operating 
system software. Kylie - the salesperson at Microbits said that was no 
problem, so I placed the order.

Today I had a phone call from Kylie to tell me that Microbits would not 
sell me a computer unless I paid for another copy of NT 4.0 that they would 
supply.

Not being keen to pay Microsoft $289.00 for another copy of their operating 
system that I don't need I cancelled the order.

Can anybody recommend a reputable company in Adelaide that will sell me a 
quality workstation, and allow me to supply the operating system software?

Has anybody encountered a similar situation before? I know Geoffrey had his 
famous encounter with Toshiba a while ago, but this situation with 
Microbits isn't quite the same because I actually need to use NT on one 
machine.

Steve
