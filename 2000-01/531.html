&gt; &gt; I think HTML is the way to go, or maybe RTF.  PDF really annoys me.
&gt; &gt; Recently I had to uninstall Acrobat Reader 4 and then install
&gt; &gt; Acrobat Reader 3 since the PDF file had a password/encryption method
&gt; &gt; that was only supported by version 3. (this was on my windows
&gt; &gt; machine though). I also think that Acrobat is hard to read on the
&gt; &gt; screen. Maybe plain text is the way to go so nobody can complain.
&gt;
&gt; I don't recal a recent distribution of linux that _doesn't_ come with
&gt; a .pdf viewer of some description?
&gt;

But XPDF doesn't support encrypted pdf. So you need to then go and get
version 3 pf acrobat reader......

I agree, PDF is a pain. I like text myself. ;-). Although latex looks as
though it would be very easily converted to other formats.
