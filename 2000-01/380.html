Hi,

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; SO&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; does anyone know how to add BATTERY POWER to a Pentium Board with
&gt; NO external battery jumpers??
&gt; CAN I "add" some volts to pins 24 (vcc) & 12 (gnd) under the board with
&gt; out destroying something??????

If you are adept at the soldering iron (in which case what are you doing
using a computer, the two skills don't mix I tell you :), get a BIOS
batery on some jumper leads, abd solder that to the MB.

**Please note that this is what I would try, not what I have tried in the
past. but I can't see that it could cause more dammage than already
caused**

The only problem I could see is that having a dead and a live batery in
parallel could cause some inpedence problems. Can you solder the entire
batery socket out ?

&gt; WHAT happens to a pentium m/b if it has NO RTC (ie/ if I destroy the RTC
&gt; part of the thing??)

UMM, check the BIOS guide on the web. Its my bible. Results may vary I
think, but RTC should get powered from mains when on, just lose its time
when off.

&gt; I have managed to get it to boot a 400Mb hdd with an old RH LINUX on it
&gt; - but I still have to press F1 etc etc to get there and I cant easily
&gt; install anything without a floppy drive etc etc
&gt; As to why I want to do this .... cos I can :) 

Without a flat battery, the system may boot into BIOS without error. You
may not need a battry to run, but you can not run with a flat battry.

cya
