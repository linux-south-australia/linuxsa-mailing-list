Hi all - have been vaguely following this thread (which I innocently
started) - have to raise a contentious issue here - at the risk of
offending heaps of people ;))

&gt; It all comes down to the fact that there was no year 0, there was 1 BC

&gt; 0:00:01 January 1st 2001.

Now ...... :) as I recall from Sunday School, J.C. lived to be 32 years
old or thereabouts. SOOOOOOOooooooooo.... there must have been 1BC then
1 to 32DC (DC=During Christ) & then 1AD 1 year after he died! You cant
just leave out 32 or so years btw...SO... what was the period of time
called between when he died and 1 year later (which theoretically is the
true 1AD) and what did people (anywhere/everywhere) call their years
while JC was still alive - hmmmmmmmmm ....so, there could not have just
been 1BC THEN 1AD....for example those living in africa were totally
oblivious to what was going on in rome/jerusalem etc therefore they
certainly werent aware it was 1BC or 7DC or 1AD hmmmmmmmmmmmmm! And then
Pope Gregory the whatever screwed things around in his Papal Tardis & so
if you discount what he did its still mid 1999 or something isnt it. AND
then, since when can humans ever keep their shit together long enough to
actually accurately the passing of time... so it is really proably 1983
or perhaps 2019!

But I digress.....Now, JC died... start the clock.... 1 year later it
becomes 1AD, 2000 years later it is 2000AD which is 2001 years since JC
died (therefore the year we call 2000 is actually 2001SJCD (since jc
died)

It is also interesting to note that hexadecimal notation has been used
throughout history..
eg/ 1BC 0BC/0AD 32DC 1AD etc ad infinitum ad nauseum ;)

And for those of you who got this far... seriously, who gives a toss -
its called 2000, last year was 1999 and an excellent year for fireworks
makers &  the computer industry... the advent of 2000 was an excellent
opportunity to get pissed & party on and life is to short to debate what
frigging year/century/millenium it is or isnt.... THIS WAS MY THREAD & I
STARTED SO NOW I END IT ;)
Phil
Happy 02/01/2000AD or 02/01/2032SJCWB (since JC was born)  or
02/01/2001SJCD (since JC died)

PS: For god's sake take this in the spirit its intended ;-)
