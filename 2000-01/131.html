Nick, this is too easy.  Posit that the scriptures do now exist; I doubt
you will argue this since I can easily send you a copy if you don't already
have one.  If they now exist then there must have been a time when they
were first said, which is the "first place" you mentioned.

&gt; And if they definitely did, who said they're right at all?  Who says they
&gt; weren't written by some guy(s) as a joke?

I certainly don't vouch for their veracity.  As far as I can tell they
could easily have been a joke.  This is quite irrelevant to the topic
I introduced, namely that our current translation is (deliberately)
inacurrate.
