&gt; Hi All,
&gt;     Using the allegedly flawed calendar we have in use today
&gt; :
&gt; 
&gt; Please bear with me -
&gt; 
&gt;     " In those days Ceasar Augustus issued a decree that a
&gt; census should be taken of the entire Roman world. (This was
&gt; the first census that took place while Quirinius was
&gt; governor of Syria.) " Luke 2:1-2
&gt; 
&gt; Ceasar Augustus : Gaius Octavius was born on September 23,
&gt; 63 BC,  he died on August 19, 14AD. Encyclopedia Britannica.
&gt; 
&gt;     " After Jesus was born in Bethlehem  in Judea, during
&gt; the time of King Herod, ..." Matthew 2:1
&gt; 
&gt; HEROD THE GREAT, Latin HERODES MAGNUS (b. 73 BC--d.
&gt; March/April, 4 BC, Jericho, Judaea), Roman-appointed king of
&gt; Judaea (37-4 BC). Encyclopedia Britannica.
&gt; 
&gt;     " When Herod realised that he had been outwitted by the
&gt; Magi (Wise Men), he was furious, and he gave orders to kill
&gt; all the boys in Bethlehem  and it's vicinity who were 2
&gt; years old and under, in accordance with the time he had
&gt; learned from the Magi. " Matthew 2:16
&gt; 
&gt; Star of Bethlehem  : celestial phenomenon mentioned in the
&gt; Gospel According to Matthew as leading "wise men from the
&gt; East" to the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Natural events that
&gt; might well have been considered important omens and
&gt; described as stars include exploding stars (novae and
&gt; supernovae), comets (Halley's Comet was visible in 12 and 11
&gt; BC), meteors, and planetary conjunctions--i.e., apparent
&gt; close approaches of two or more planets to each other.
&gt; The year of Jesus' birth is uncertain but can be narrowed
&gt; down to probably between 6 and 4 BC. The biblical account
&gt; indicates two sightings of the star, one before the wise men
&gt; began their journey (probably from Babylonia or Persia) and
&gt; the other near their journey's end, when the omen "came and
&gt; stood over where the young child was." A celestial object
&gt; near the horizon of any given observer might be considered
&gt; by him as pointing out some spot on Earth below.
&gt; 
&gt; Chinese annals record novae in 5 BC and 4 BC; in the early
&gt; 17th century, Johannes Kepler advanced the view that the
&gt; Star of Bethlehem  may have been a nova occurring in or near
&gt; some conjunction of bright planets.
&gt; 
&gt; Several striking planetary conjunctions also took place
&gt; within 10 years of the chronological point now taken as the
&gt; beginning of the Christian era. A triple conjunction in
&gt; early 6 BC, in which Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn stood at the
&gt; points of a triangle, has often been mentioned as a possible
&gt; explanation of the star. Prior to that, in 7 BC, Jupiter and
&gt; Saturn were for eight months within three degrees of each
&gt; other and three times within that period passed within one
&gt; degree. Several years later, on June 17, 2 BC, the bright
&gt; planets Venus and Jupiter would have appeared to observers
&gt; in Babylon to have merged just before setting in the general
&gt; direction of Bethlehem  to the west.
&gt; 
&gt; Encyclopedia Britannica
&gt; 
&gt;     So. Augustus called the census in the time of Herod.
&gt; Herod died in 4 BC (these dates are supposed to accurate and
&gt; verifiable by some other method). The wise men told him they
&gt; saw the star about 2 years prior to seeing Herod. Various
&gt; celestial phenomena about that time. Herod killed all
&gt; children under the age of 2 accordingly, and died sometime
&gt; after. So this puts the birth at least at 5-6 BC in real
&gt; terms. This means that the Y2K actually occurred in 1994 AD,
&gt; or 1993 if you want to be argumentative. AD means Anno
&gt; Dommini, NOT After JC Died, my Latin is rusty, but not THAT
&gt; rusty. And finally, strictly speaking the end of the year
&gt; should be at Midnight on December 24th, not 7 days after if
&gt; it is an exact number of years after JC's birth, but that
&gt; date is dodgy anyway since it was selected by some early
&gt; Christian church leaders to replace the Pagan ceremonies of
&gt; the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere anyway. Not
&gt; to mention that the Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, Indian,
&gt; Arabs, and the Mayans, just to name a few, all have
&gt; different calendars, that they still use (not sure about the
&gt; Mayans), and the Khymer Rouge instituted the Year 0 (or 1 if
&gt; you want to argue) in about 1979AD in Cambodia. Just for the
&gt; hell of it, the last I heard, the shortest measurable period
&gt; of time is about 16 femptoseconds (which is ten to the minus
&gt; some number, ie small)
&gt; 
&gt;     Here endeth the lesson.
&gt;

&gt; &gt;Hi all - have been vaguely following this thread (which I
&gt; innocently
&gt; &gt;started) - have to raise a contentious issue here - at the
&gt; risk of
&gt; &gt;offending heaps of people ;))
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; It all comes down to the fact that there was no year 0,
&gt; there was 1 BC
&gt; &gt;&gt; followed by 1 AD. Therefor 1 plus 2000 means that the 3rd
&gt; millenim starts
&gt; &gt;&gt; 0:00:01 January 1st 2001.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;Now ...... :) as I recall from Sunday School, J.C. lived to
&gt; be 32 years
&gt; &gt;old or thereabouts. SOOOOOOOooooooooo.... there must have
&gt; been 1BC then
&gt; &gt;1 to 32DC (DC=During Christ) & then 1AD 1 year after he
&gt; died! You cant
&gt; &gt;just leave out 32 or so years btw...SO... what was the
&gt; period of time
&gt; &gt;called between when he died and 1 year later (which
&gt; theoretically is the
&gt; &gt;true 1AD) and what did people (anywhere/everywhere) call
&gt; their years
&gt; &gt;while JC was still alive - hmmmmmmmmm ....so, there could
&gt; not have just
&gt; &gt;been 1BC THEN 1AD....for example those living in africa
&gt; were totally
&gt; &gt;oblivious to what was going on in rome/jerusalem etc
&gt; therefore they
&gt; &gt;certainly werent aware it was 1BC or 7DC or 1AD
&gt; hmmmmmmmmmmmmm! And then
&gt; &gt;Pope Gregory the whatever screwed things around in his
&gt; Papal Tardis & so
&gt; &gt;if you discount what he did its still mid 1999 or something
&gt; isnt it. AND
&gt; &gt;then, since when can humans ever keep their shit together
&gt; long enough to
&gt; &gt;actually accurately the passing of time... so it is really
&gt; proably 1983
&gt; &gt;or perhaps 2019!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;But I digress.....Now, JC died... start the clock.... 1
&gt; year later it
&gt; &gt;becomes 1AD, 2000 years later it is 2000AD which is 2001
&gt; years since JC
&gt; &gt;died (therefore the year we call 2000 is actually 2001SJCD
&gt; (since jc
&gt; &gt;died)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It is also interesting to note that hexadecimal notation
&gt; has been used
&gt; &gt;throughout history..
&gt; &gt;eg/ 1BC 0BC/0AD 32DC 1AD etc ad infinitum ad nauseum ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;And for those of you who got this far... seriously, who
&gt; gives a toss -
&gt; &gt;its called 2000, last year was 1999 and an excellent year
&gt; for fireworks
&gt; &gt;makers &  the computer industry... the advent of 2000 was
&gt; an excellent
&gt; &gt;opportunity to get pissed & party on and life is to short
&gt; to debate what
&gt; &gt;frigging year/century/millenium it is or isnt.... THIS WAS
&gt; MY THREAD & I
&gt; &gt;STARTED SO NOW I END IT ;)
&gt; &gt;Phil
&gt; &gt;Happy 02/01/2000AD or 02/01/2032SJCWB (since JC was born)
&gt; or
&gt; &gt;02/01/2001SJCD (since JC died)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;PS: For god's sake take this in the spirit its intended ;-)
&gt; &gt;
