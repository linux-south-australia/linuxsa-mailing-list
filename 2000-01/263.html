Read the HOWTO's .

Sorry not to give you more help here... but whats the point in re-typing the
procedures which are included in a text file you allready have??

look in "/usr/doc/HOWTO" and read the Soundblaster howto.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I recently bought the revised edition of Linux pocketbook which includes 3
cds,
&gt; one of which contains Red Hat 6.0 to be installed on the PC. I followed
the
&gt; installation procedures but have run into a bit of trouble. I have
installed
&gt; it such that I have the choice of running either Win98 or Linux as my
operating
&gt; system.
&gt;
&gt; The problem I have encountered is that I am unable to get the sound
working
&gt; when I am running on the Linux operating system (it works fine when
runningwin98).
&gt;  As instructed in the booklet I have enabled sound as one of the services
that
&gt; starts up when Linux boots. The sound card that is installed in my PC is
Sound
&gt; Blaster16.
&gt;
&gt; Please advise me as to how to enable the sound on the Linux operating
system.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Another problem is that I wish for the option of being able to shut down
my
&gt; computer entirely after a Linux session, however I only have the options
of
&gt; rebooting or halting the system when I log out. Hence I am forced to
reboot
&gt; the computer, choose to load Windows and then shut down from there. Is
there
&gt; a way of getting around this so that I can include shut down as one of my
log
&gt; out options in Linux?
&gt;
&gt; Thank You very much for your assistance. Any advice you can give me is
greatly
&gt; appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Maidhili Chinnappan
