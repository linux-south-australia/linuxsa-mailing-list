    Nick&gt; What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?
    Nick&gt; PDF?  HTML?  TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(

I think the problem here is that people want the document source, not a
rendered (cf compiled for C source) document.  This make PDF, PS, DVI
unsuitable.  In the case of responding to tenders, having editable
source can greatly reduce the amount of work required by the respondent.

If the problem was providing an electronic version that can be viewed or
printed, then PDF or PS would be a good choice I think.  PDF and PS
format files are quite easy to create with existing commercial or open
source tools under windows.  They can also be printed and viewed with
free (speech) and free (beer) tools on many platforms.

To output a PS file under windows, you simply print to a postscript (eg
Apple LaserWriter) printer connected to FILE:

You can then convert this PS file to a PDF file using ghostscript or gnu 
ghostscript (ps2pdf.bat).

You can also purchase Adobe Acrobat, which includes a driver that allows
you to print directly to a PDF file.

This works with pretty much everything that can print to a printer under
windows.


    Nick&gt; I like the idea of DVI or PDF - but everyone uses Word!  And
    Nick&gt; Word can't save as DVI or PDF!  As the techie at a govt dept -
    Nick&gt; how can I help?  *grin*

These tools have been available for some time.  Unfortunately, I don't
think that they address the problem, as most people want the document
source.


    Nick&gt; Remembering that MS Office is the 'standard' wordprocessing
    Nick&gt; software..

Hmm.  Unfortunately, this situation is a bit circular.  Most people want
documents in MS Word format because that is what they have.  Therefore,
most people want MS Word because that is what reads MS Word format
documents best, and the MS Word documents are available.  And so on.

Martin
