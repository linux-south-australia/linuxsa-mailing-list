thanks, David...

&gt; Zombies are processes that have ended, but for what ever reason, bug or
&gt; something, haven't removed themselves from the active process list, hence
&gt; the inability to actually kill them.

I didn't realise that it was the process's responsibility to do that
(remove itself from the active process list)... I would have thought
that the kernel would maintain that, and as soon as a process ceases
execution, it would be removed... I'm probably mistaken, though...

&gt; 
&gt; They take no memory, and no CPU time, so are generally harmelss, tho I
&gt; don't know whether they can cause you to run out of processes on a
&gt; machine.

So for all intents and purposes, they are not there, apart from an entry
in the active processes list... ?

&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes they can clear themselves, sometimes they disapear when a parent
&gt; process is completed, and sometimes the only disapear when you reboot.
&gt; 
&gt; Generally ignore them, unless you are getting alot of them, in which case
&gt; it could indicate a misbehaving program.

Nah, just noticed one, and wondered (also remembered the existence of a
previous thread, but don't remember the content of the messages...)
