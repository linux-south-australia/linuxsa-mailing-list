&gt;&gt; re our discussion a little while ago, I installed RH6.1 on a drive which
&gt;&gt; also contained a DOS partition.  Result:
&gt;&gt; Hdb1 Primary DOS
&gt;&gt; Hdb2 Primary DOS
&gt;&gt; Hdb5 Logical Linux Native (/boot)
&gt;&gt; Hdb6 Logical Linux Native (/)
&gt;&gt; Hdb7 Logical Linux Swap
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Note that there is no partition labelled 'Extended'
&gt;&gt; Note that Hdb5 is real - a primary partition in which data is stored.
&gt;&gt; Note - there are FIVE partitions ??
&gt;
&gt;whooo slow down, you're getting some terms mixed up.
&gt;
&gt;inviolable rule #1 PRIMARY partitions plural
&gt;
&gt;there can only ever be four (4) primary partitions. The location of these
&gt;partitions on the disk are contained in the first bytes of the first sector
&gt;of every hard disk and it is called the master boot record (mbr), solely
&gt;because a bootable binary of some kind can co-exist there in the remaining
&gt;512 bytes of that sector. They are primary, and there are only (a maximum)
&gt;of four because that is the physical definition of their location and
&gt;structure on the disk.

Hmmm, I am sure that you didn't mean the above to sound as confusing as it
looks.

The first sector of each HD is called the MBR, or master boot record, and
its structure is as follows:

446 bytes are the master bootstrap.
 64 bytes are the four partition table entries as you mention
  4 bytes are a signature ...

Then there is a boot sector at the first sector of bootable partitions like
DOS, Windows NT, Win95.  Win98, or FAT 32 partitions have a three sector
boot record, plus a copy a bit further into the disk ...

&gt;these partitions correspond to hdX1,2,3 and 4, they cannot be called
&gt;anything else.
&gt;
&gt;the fact that hdb4 is not used in your setup is irrelevant. hdb3 (although
&gt;unlisted) most certainly is. an entry exists in your mbr on hdb for
&gt;partition 4, it says 'zero bytes' and is ignored.
&gt;
&gt;rule # 2 EXTENDED partition - singular
&gt;
&gt;one of these 'primary' partitions, and only one, can be instead an
&gt;'extended' partition. (which is not a partition at all). It points to a
&gt;location on the disk which contains a linked list of 'logical' partitions.
&gt;You can have as many logical partitions as you care to endure but the
&gt;practical limit for linux at least is 16-4 due to the make up of major and
&gt;minor nodes in /dev directory that point to these partitions.

Hmmm, I just looked at /dev/hda?, and the minor numbers start at 1 and grow
sequentially to 9 in the case of my system.  I can also see other devices
with minor numbers up to 175 or so ...

Now I have not looked at the code, but it would seem that IDE minor numbers
could go all the way up to 255, thus allowing up to /dev/hda255?  Perhaps
there is some other limit in the code ...

&gt;*any* of the four partitions hda1 through 4 can be an extended 'pseudo
&gt;partition and is generally indicated as such in listings as
&gt;
&gt;&lt;hda2&gt; hda5
&gt;
&gt;this syntax says, the first logical partition hda5 is in the extended
&gt;partition called hda2.
&gt;
&gt;rule #3 LOGICAL partitions -many
&gt;
&gt;logical partitions start at hdX5 and grow from there.
&gt;
&gt;the reason why only one extended partition exists (if it exists at all) is
&gt;because more than one is silly, it could only ever duplicate the linked
&gt;chain present in the first one.
&gt;
&gt;As for the naming conventions for these 3 partition types, i don't make the
&gt;rules, and they're confusing, but, by any measurement, the above are the
&gt;facts.
