Hey Andrew, I've got this Postscript program; wanna run it on all of your
printers for me?  It doesn't do anything nasty, really it doesn't.  (I
don't think it's nasty to add "copyright (c) david newall" to the bottom of
every page printed.)

PostScript is an alternate [sic] to HTML just like Sun Microsystems is an
alternative to Sunbeam mixmaster.

I think no competent PostScript programmer would dream of putting PS in the
same basket as HTML, and certainly not call it "of similar primitiveness".
The idea is laughable.  HTML doesn't do what PostScript does because HTML
doesn't "do" anything; it's not a programming language.  You can do
anything you need to a display using PS, assuming what you need is static,
because PS is a complete programming language.  HTML, by contrast -- and I
mean all versions -- is quite incapable of putting a page break between this
paragraph and the next.

People tinker with browsers, adding JavaScript for example; but make no
mistake: JavaScript is not HTML.  It is for this reason that many web sites
have a Netscape version, and an IE version, and a text only version, and
they are all different and with maintenance problems attendant thereto.

Don't even *think* of suggesting, oh but you can add a ShockRave Acid Tab
II plug-in and like wow it makes everything sooo freaky.  Plug-ins,
active-X and that whole nasty gammit of couldn't leave well enough alone is
the reason why it matters that Netscape is losing the browser war.  If
people only write using standard HTML then it wouldn't make any difference
what browser you used.

Your comment about Sun Java being proprietary was so much fluff and
hand-waving.  Adobe is already unreasonable with Postscript, to the point
that if you want to make a commercial product that incorporates a PS engine
you had better be prepared to pay a licence to Adobe for every unit shipped.

HTML is an adequate document display format if you comprimise (a great
deal) on page layout.  I do my manuals in HTML and that's okay, they look
good enough, and as a bonus they can be viewed from any browser on the
internet.  I would not dream of doing an invoice in HTML because it would
terrible.  When people give me a huge amount of money the least I can do is
give them an invoice that looks great.

That said, PS is widely available and perhaps I would prefer to receive a
PS "document" than a Word document.  There's no guarantee that you could
edit such a document, and that's not because of any password protection,
but because there it's really a PS program.  PDF, by the way, is very
similar to PS in a way that I am still to fully understand.  I think it's
easy to convert between PS and PDF.
