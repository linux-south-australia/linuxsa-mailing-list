Im intrested for sure.

I would even be willing to bring in one or two spare box's i have laying
around for people to use, maybe if anyone else has a spare box or two they
are not using, they could bring a few in for others to use also, only need
10 or so people to bring 3 or so box's and we could have a class of 30 each
with a computer.


&gt; SO, I throw down the gauntlet.  Make it available, by other means if
&gt; neccessary, to us mere mortals, or get off the mailing list.  I will go so
far
&gt; as to say those of you out there who ARE interested in learning about
Linux
&gt; (but don't have the means to pay for a "proffessional" course - (you could
do
&gt; and do a MSCE for about the same.. and have a "guaranteed" job at the end
of
&gt; it!!)) Let me know directly and if I get enough interest I will
investigate
&gt; further to see what resources I can pull together to make our OWN course
&gt; happen.  However, I can only do this in Adelaide, so I apologise to people
&gt; from elsewhere for missing out.

Also, just a suggestion, maybe we could have a install-fest like meeting
soon
maybe a POST-INSTALL fest or something, a get together of people that now
have linux install, and may need a little help in some areas
and help other users that are having problems in an area they have had
problems with before, or know all about.

Food for thought...

Oh, and mark, I do not expect anything from linux, it comes to me as it is,
training may not be cheap,
but then again this is linux, not a "commercial UNIX vendor" list

Putting together a training course may be costly, but it does not have to be
if everyone chips in.

Richard, more then likely, someone on the list would be able to provide a
venue at a lost cost, if any, lunch could be told to "bring your own" and
maybe give directions to a shop neer by, refreshments, as above.
PC's could be aquired, like I said, Im willing to bring a few PC's if i was
coming to your course, and if im willing to do that, how many others would
be?
Hubs & cables - hmm, bring own computer, bring on cables. ahh, hub problem?
I've got an 8port sitting here that i could bring along, once again, how
many others would be willing to bring in a hub to cascade off each other?
Printed course materials: not to hard, my mum works for a design and
printing place in goolwa, photocopyers are not to hard to use, & dont cost
much to get copys.
Samba t-shirts: Personaly, I would rather learn something then walk out with
a t-shirt.

so what does that leave us with.. Devloping the course materials & setting
up computers before the event begins.
Oh I almost  forgot, your time. Add that to the total cost.

and the cost? how much would ALL of that bring your course cost down to?
I'll let you do the figures.

As for your comment on me "making a decision that the course is too
expensive"
There was no decision to be made, I simple do not have money to spend on
courses.
Personaly, If i had that sort of money laying around, I would of jumped at
the chance to sign myself up.

And yes, I do feel I was jumped on by a few unnamed people after sending my
first mail about this course.
sorry if it seems that i was jumping straight out and saying "your crazy"
what i should of said was something along the lines of
"We need free, or lost cost or free courses within Adelaide, and probably
the rest
of Australia too"

Regards,
Adam
