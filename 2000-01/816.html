Hi,

&gt; Yes. I have the DNS numbers in the DNS section of TCP ip &lt;u r talking about
&gt; the ones used through an isp aren't u?&gt;.
&gt; I haven't got any suffixes though.
&gt; I added the host name on its own to the "Domain Name Suffix order".
&gt; That didn't work.
&gt; 
&gt; Wait up, maybe I'm getting things confused here. when u say name server are
&gt; u talking about the DNS I go through
&gt; at my ISP? eg that are defined in /etc/resolv.conf
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;If so, is your name server set up so that the names define IPs as well as
&gt; &gt;IPs defining names (look at the DNS HOWTO for information on this).

Ok, your linux gateway needs to provide two functions to your wintel box.
A means to transfer packets from the PPP interface to the ethernet
interface, and trranslate IPs

Something to resolve names to IPs both inside and outside your network.

It looks like you've done DNS instide your network with a hosts file. This
is fine on a small network, but unworkable on a large.

You have two options.

Place the same enteries in the HOSTS file (located in the windows
directory), or setup a name server. For the second you'll require a
caching name server for external, and make it a primary for your local
network (the DNS HOWTO will tell you how to do this).

You simply then set your DNS entry in TCP/IP setup in windows to be your
linux box, not SENET.

&gt; When the Linux Machine boots up I also get this error message...
&gt; 
&gt; "Cannot determine localhost name
&gt;  Use the Server name Directive to set it mannually"
&gt; 
&gt; Maybe this has something to do with it?

It means your hostname hasn't been set. Do a man on the hostname command
to find out how to set it. If you use linuxconf, you can also set it
easily there. It shouldn't necausing your nameserving problems.

cya
