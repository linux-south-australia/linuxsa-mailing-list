&gt; Nick, this is too easy.  Posit that the scriptures do now exist; I
&gt; doubt you will argue this since I can easily send you a copy if you 
&gt; don't already have one.  If they now exist then there must have been
&gt; a time when they were first said, which is the "first place" you
&gt; mentioned.

Oh yeah :/

&gt; &gt; And if they definitely did, who said they're right at all?  Who 
&gt; &gt; says they weren't written by some guy(s) as a joke?
&gt; 
&gt; I certainly don't vouch for their veracity.  As far as I can tell they
&gt; could easily have been a joke.  This is quite irrelevant to the topic
&gt; I introduced, namely that our current translation is (deliberately)
&gt; inacurrate.

lol ok ok, I'm staying out of this now!

*takes marshmallow from campfire*

Nick..
