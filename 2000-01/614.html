&gt; For almost all web work, i simply use KDE's kfm integrated file and web
&gt; browser. It's simple, plain. with a minimum of bullsh*t buttons. In many
&gt; ways the integrated environment behind both IE5 and Netscape goes against
&gt; the grain of Linux. 
&gt; 
&gt; Lean and mean, keep it simple, stupid.

Agreed, agreed, agreed. Yesterday I was doing some work and only had
my laptop with me. I was making phone calls and needed a basic
spreadsheet to record events, details, etc. I was going to use vi
because I didn't have staroffice or applixware or anything installed.
(and emacs is for wimps! :o] ). Instead I found the gnumeric
spreadsheet that comes with gnome. It is very small, very compact,
loads in less than a second, and when you look at the menus and lack
of buttons and crap, you could be excused for thinking it wasn't
feature rich. As with any spreadsheet, once you get started more
features are required and my example was no different. Thing is, it
could do everything that excel can do. I'm sure there are features it
is missing, but I havn't found them yet. I browsed the function help
page, and realised that this little spreadsheet is actually very
powerful.

And the interface is so clean and nice, and you can drive it
completely with keystrokes. No mouse required, (unless you really want
to).

Typical day in Linuxland

Cheers

Alex!
