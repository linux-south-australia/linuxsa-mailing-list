&gt;Firstly, I can SEE ( via the binary ocular input sensors to my
&gt;biological CPU), that this ISN'T a Linux issue.  So I says to myself as
&gt;I usually do; so what.  Now here's my two cents worth.
&gt;
&gt;Suppose, just suppose for a moment that you were a Roman soldier in them
&gt;there times, posted to the ends of the earth for a tour of duty.  You
&gt;may well be away from your family and loved ones, just as our people in
&gt;East Timor are today, and you may well be "stuck" there for even years,
&gt;which was fairly typical.  So it was most probable that the soldiers of
&gt;the day (this also happened in Vietnam) took on local girlfriends as
&gt;they weren't ACTUALLY at war with the local populations in most cases.
&gt;So let's suppose for a moment that our brave legionaire (probably
&gt;conscripted..) had an affair with a local lass of hebrew origin..  I
&gt;HAVEN"T mentioned any names just yet.
&gt;
&gt;Now, for those of you somewhat unfamiliar with customs of the time, it
&gt;was quite a bad thing for a hebrew girl to fall pregnant - to ANYBODY,
&gt;let alone an occupational force legionaire.  Since at that time there
&gt;was still a fair amount of OTHER religions about (the Romans were in
&gt;fact very tolerant of all religions, unlike most groups of today), this
&gt;gave rise to an opportunity to explain away these undesired pregnancies,
&gt;like.. the gods did it, it was a fertility rite at the House of Diana,
&gt;it was a grape festival event and Pan did it, et al.  Being mostly
&gt;simple folk, these sort of explanations were quite plausible and
&gt;generally acceptable.
&gt;
&gt;SO...., one just might find any number of excuses floating about, even
&gt;possibly the one of "immaculate conception", and a Hebrew girl couldn't
&gt;exactly use Pan or Diana as an excuse now could she?  Why not?
&gt;
&gt;Now, before all you (Catholics in particular) start screaming, I din't
&gt;mention any names.  You  may draw your own conclusions, as you are free
&gt;to do, just as I am free to say what I say.
&gt;
&gt;Nor does this imply by any means whatsoever, or provide by innuendo,
&gt;suggestion, belief or tenet, that I either believe or disbelieve in
&gt;certain theosophical issues and credences. I would just like to say that
&gt;I am open minded enough to consider other options.
&gt;
&gt;Thankyou.

It's probably a good job that you didn't say anything that would imply that
people these days who have "visions" of people coming and talking to them,
telling them to do things, generally 

a) swallow/inject/smoke things they shouldn't
b) are considered to have some kind of mental illness.

Again, not trying to point fingers at anyone/anything and this certainly
does not reflect the views of anyone in particular (especially my wonderful
and marvelous employer). Likewise, I don't care what people believe. If
they like it, then good for them.
