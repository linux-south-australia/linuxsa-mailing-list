&gt;I'm tired of people whinging about how difficult
&gt;unix is, and how expensive the training is, and how hard it is to find good
&gt;help.  Damn it, help is not hard to find.  It's right there under
&gt;everyones' noses.  The source is freely available, as are man pages, howtos
&gt;and info.  If that's not enough then perhaps the problem is stupidity, or
&gt;rank laziness.  Often it's the latter.  

That sure sounds like a flame to me.  Perhaps I am too stupid or too lazy
to properly interpret your intentions.

Without going further, please examine my sig.  Do you REALLY think a person
with the sort of background I MUST have to occupy the position I do even
suggests the possibility of stupidity or laziness?  Do you REALLY think
that the proportion of lazy and stupid newbies is high enough to justify
your comments?

You would be better occupied keeping your big mouth shut.  You have already
exposed yourself as a fool.
