&gt;  &gt; &gt; What about Private Schools?
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; At least some of them use the sa.edu.au domain. e.g. Annesley College.
&gt;  &gt; Anyone know of schools that don't?
&gt;
&gt; sa.edu.au has nothing to do with the State Government's (very poorly
&gt; named) sa.edu service.
&gt;
&gt; The solution to the filtering problem for schools involves two steps:
&gt;
&gt;     (a) tell your ISP that you're now using filtering software, and
&gt;     (b) do nothing else.
&gt;
&gt; The law covers ISPs and Internet Content Hosts;  It doesn't actually
&gt; impose any obligations on anyone who doesn't fit the definitions of
&gt; those terms.  If you tell your ISP that you're using filtering software
&gt; they'll be able to sit back, satisified that they're conforming to
&gt; the ABA-approved code of conduct, and you won't have to do anything.
&gt;
&gt; That situation may change at some point in the next twelve months if
&gt; Alston decides that he wants to wave his willy around a bit to show
&gt; everyone how powerful he is;  he could pressure the ABA to revoke their
&gt; approval of the current Code, forcing the industry to come up with an
&gt; even more draconian one.  Even if he does that, though, there is
&gt; no legal liability under the BSA on anyone who isn't an ISP or an ICH,
&gt; so feel free to lie your arses off to your ISPs so that they'll be able
&gt; to avoid filtering you.
&gt;
&gt; Meanwhile, the BSA does foreshadow the idea that the states will be
&gt; coming up with dovetailing laws to cover *users* of the Internet;  at
&gt; that point, schools (and everyone else) will need to start seriously
&gt; worrying...

We may be looking at providing dial-up access for staff to work, but the will
most likely be able to access the net as well. Does that change anything?

Thanks for your help,
