&gt;&gt; The course costs are $395 per day,
&gt;
&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt;That counts me out.
&gt;almost the same price as the other linux course that was in this list
&gt;resently
&gt;$1995 for 5 days.. $399 a day.

While I respect Adam's right to make a decision that the course is too
expensive for him, I feel that I must respond to the implied criticism.

In putting these course on, I have to:

1. Hire a venue
2. provide lunch for the delegates
3. provide refreshments for the delegates
4. hire a PC for each delegate,
5. Set up the PCs, half with Win98 and Linux, the other half with NT and Linux
6. Provide hubs and cables
7. Provide printed course materials
8. Provide Samba tshirts or something else
9. Develop the course materials

WRT 9, experience in the training industry, and my experience, is that it
takes something like 8 hours per contact hour to develop a high quality
course like the one I an putting together (every thing has to be tested).

In any event, I estimate, that even with all the material I have to hand,
it will take me 60 hours or so to put the course together.

That being the case, I will not break even on the course being given on
17-18 Feb, and I will have to give the course something like 5 times before
my time is paid for.

In addition, the prices are quite competitive compared with M$ course, and
a bargain compared with Oracle courses ($659 to 700 a day).  And how many
courses do you know of where the course developer gives the course :-)



&gt;Anyone out there want to pay for me too? &lt;grin&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;Adam
