I'm compelled to respond. The delete key is not far away... Use it
rather than flaming me...

This kind of debate is known as Apologetics. It is a waste of time. It
is one of those things that turns christianity into a religion. God
hates religion. Apologetics creates more religiousity. People debate
from their religious positions (Catholic, Protestant, Atheistic,
Scientific, Pure Logic, Agnostic, Linux, etc) and attack other religious
positions, hoping to shore up their own positions through their efforts.
Debates centre around Creation, Evolution, Miracles, The Flood, The
validity of the Bible, and a million other trivialities. If you're a
Christian, do yourself and others a favour -- get off your religious
high horse, forget the debates, the theology, the intellectual
christianity, and get on with relating to the living God. If you're not
a Christian, do yourself a favour -- get off your religious high horse,
forget the debates, the theology, the intellectual christianity, and get
on with relating to the living God.

Just my humble opinion, and will not be followed by any more public
postings by me on this topic.

&gt; Firstly, I can SEE ( via the binary ocular input sensors to my
&gt; biological CPU), that this ISN'T a Linux issue.  So I says to myself as
&gt; I usually do; so what.  Now here's my two cents worth.
&gt; 
&gt; Suppose, just suppose for a moment that you were a Roman soldier in them
&gt; there times, posted to the ends of the earth for a tour of duty.  You
&gt; may well be away from your family and loved ones, just as our people in
&gt; East Timor are today, and you may well be "stuck" there for even years,
&gt; which was fairly typical.  So it was most probable that the soldiers of
&gt; the day (this also happened in Vietnam) took on local girlfriends as
&gt; they weren't ACTUALLY at war with the local populations in most cases.
&gt; So let's suppose for a moment that our brave legionaire (probably
&gt; conscripted..) had an affair with a local lass of hebrew origin..  I
&gt; HAVEN"T mentioned any names just yet.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, for those of you somewhat unfamiliar with customs of the time, it
&gt; was quite a bad thing for a hebrew girl to fall pregnant - to ANYBODY,
&gt; let alone an occupational force legionaire.  Since at that time there
&gt; was still a fair amount of OTHER religions about (the Romans were in
&gt; fact very tolerant of all religions, unlike most groups of today), this
&gt; gave rise to an opportunity to explain away these undesired pregnancies,
&gt; like.. the gods did it, it was a fertility rite at the House of Diana,
&gt; it was a grape festival event and Pan did it, et al.  Being mostly
&gt; simple folk, these sort of explanations were quite plausible and
&gt; generally acceptable.
&gt; 
&gt; SO...., one just might find any number of excuses floating about, even
&gt; possibly the one of "immaculate conception", and a Hebrew girl couldn't
&gt; exactly use Pan or Diana as an excuse now could she?  Why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Now, before all you (Catholics in particular) start screaming, I din't
&gt; mention any names.  You  may draw your own conclusions, as you are free
&gt; to do, just as I am free to say what I say.
&gt; 
&gt; Nor does this imply by any means whatsoever, or provide by innuendo,
&gt; suggestion, belief or tenet, that I either believe or disbelieve in
&gt; certain theosophical issues and credences. I would just like to say that
&gt; I am open minded enough to consider other options.
&gt; 
&gt; Thankyou.
