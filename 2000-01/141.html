Agreed.  Why DO you persist?

&gt;&gt;You can choose to teach your two-year-old daughter the concept of zero, so
&gt;&gt;that when she is asked to count the number of digits on her hands, she
&gt;&gt;first waves the said hands aimlessly in the air to indicate zero before
&gt;&gt;touching the first digit and saying "one".  What the poor child will do
&gt;&gt;when asked to continue with toes, Heaven knows.
&gt;
&gt;An amusing thought ...

But has a lesson you have missed.  (deliberately?)

&gt;Well, we have, as you point out below, a decimal numbering system.  Now,
&gt;what are the first ten numbers?
&gt;
&gt;   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?
&gt;
&gt;Why have you left out 0?

Because that would make ELEVEN numbers, of course.

Look, there is NO virtue whatsoever in applying a value to something that
means "no value".  Particularly when all you wish to establish is that 2000
is the begining of a millenium, rather than the end of an old one.

You are allowing the logical oddity of computing science, where zero is the
only way to express "all switches off" and therefore counting of bits &
bytes commences at zero, to cloud your judgement.  (Yes, I know theoretical
mathematicians also have occasional use for zero as an abstract value,
similar in kind to infinity.)

&gt;I assert that they are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9!

Then you are wrong.
No amount of wriggling, fiddling, prevaricating, sophisticating or perverse
velleity can change that.

What people have been celebrating is the change from 1900s to the 2000s -
and why not if they wish?  That some of them think they have been
celebrating the beginning of the third millenium is irrelevant to the truth.
