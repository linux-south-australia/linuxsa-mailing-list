&gt;  &gt; In an industry where we are mostly on contract work, and can therefore move
&gt;  &gt; around more easily, which employers would like to make you more employable
&gt;  &gt; to others?
&gt;
&gt; Those which are confident that they are treating their people well enough
&gt; that there's no real incentive for them to leave.

Yes. Yet you will still get the majority of people that will be willing to give
it up for a higher paying job.
