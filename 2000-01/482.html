Zombies are implemented in order to ensure that last-gasp 
information about the child process can be captured by the parent 
process.  In particular, this includes the exit status 
and the net resource usage of the child.  These are 
part of the complete support for multiprocessing provided 
by Unix.  

However, this feature creates a (smallish) management 
problem for the programmer: where a program spawns 
child processes, it must also register a signal handler 
to receive the child process exit, and must call 
waitpid(2) to finally dispose of the carcass of the 
child process.  This call can be difficult to 
schedule amongst other activities unless you've 
designed your program really, really carefully, 
and there are tricky race conditions that can lead 
to these exit signals being missed (can happen with 
wait(2)).  

Zombies must be reaped, as otherwise all the slots 
in the kernel's process table will (eventually) be 
filled.  The init process will reap any zombies if a 
parent process exits without properly cleaning up.  

So your code must handle zombies as part of its 
normal operation.  If some package is leaving zombies 
lying around, it suggests that the package has 
become tied up on some operation and isn't cleaning 
up properly after itself -- if operations don't 
complete in a reasonable time frame, you can assume 
that the code's got its knickers in a twist somehow, 
and by killing the parent process, the zombies will 
be cleaned up as well.  

cheers,
