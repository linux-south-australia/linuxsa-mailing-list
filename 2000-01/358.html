I'm not really sure about this (I haven't tried anything like this) but wouldn't
it be possible to use IP aliasing to attach the 203 IP to the same device as the
139 address? Then you could just use ipchains to IP masquerade all of your other
computers through the one perminantly connected computer.
Hope this helps,
            Sam Silvester.

&gt; I have a connection to bigpond direct, but only one computer up permanently
&gt; which masquerades (if this is the right term) a private network. Some

&gt; The problem is that the modem's IP is 139.whatever, and most places seem to
&gt; assume Australia is 203.whatever, or something similar. This means some
&gt; websites don't actually think I'm Australian.
&gt;
&gt; With my bidpong connection, I have a few 203 addresses which I can use,
&gt; however, since I only have one computer that can have a 'real' IP address, I
&gt; can't use another computer as my gateway/proxy.
&gt;
&gt; I know it's possible to use the dummy net driver to accept connections to my
&gt; 203.whatever address, but is it possible to somehow use it as my gateway so
&gt; all packets sent over the 'net think it was sent from 203.x.x.x rather than
&gt; 139.x.x.x?
&gt;
&gt; I've been thinking about it for a while, but don't know a solution, and
&gt; wouldn't know which HOWTO might have that sort of problem in it.
&gt;
&gt; Note, I can't add another computer with the 203 address and use that as the
&gt; gateway, unfortunatly.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Andy
