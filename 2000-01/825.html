Personally, I reckon that if a company has signed an agreement that says
they must sell an MS OS for each machine they sell is a Bad Sign.

Forgetting any MS bias, why would any company sign an agreement that
prevents them from making any choices later on?

cf: Uni of SA, Levels Campus, Food Contract. They (the food people) have
(or had whan I was last there) a complete contract for *all* food and
drink on campus. That meant we had to fight to have a Coke machine in
our club room, that we filled and collected profit from.

Are there many companies Out There with this kind of contract? (I spose
it would be hard to tell - they wouldn't be on this list ....)

anyhoo.
