&gt; I shouldn't enter this silly discussion (there is *no* "best" universal

&gt; they succeeded in becoming the de facto standard, which no doubt pleases
&gt; them immensely, but it's hysterical to believe that *Microsoft* forces
&gt; people to use MS Word.

No, they don't, and yet, somehow, everyone has to have word.
It's called version incompatability. After a while, various competetors
to MS products will come out supporting their file formats, eg Applix
or StarOffice or Corel or any number of free projects as well. Then a
new version of Office comes out, and funnily enough, all of those 
other programs don't do the latest format. And the company whose
business you *have* to have just sent you some files in that format.
You have to buy the latest Office.  

(Don't even get me started on the operating system "upgrades" you
have to do to to install it.)
