Hello Michael et. al.

&gt; Hi.
&gt;
&gt; The missing information here is to do with the possibility of tampering with the content of the original document. If everyone has MS Word, then everyone can _change_ the document.

Nope!!  You can save as password protected for editing. eg.  read-only access.



&gt; I would have thought that PDF would be the delivery method of choice for the following reasons:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Not easily editable.
&gt; 2. Often reduces document size, thereby reducing transmission costs.
&gt; 3. Supports copy/paste, so the text can be used in tender documents.
&gt; 4. Viewable on almost any system.

So is MS Word.   worddview etc.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any linux system can create a pdf from a valid postscript file using the ps2pdf script included with ghostscript. There are similar utilities for other platforms, and I'm sure many Govt departments would have Acrobat Distiller (or a linux box hidden in the broom closet) Maybe the creation of the pdf could be ahieved by printing from word to a samba printer that actually is a script that generates the pdf and emails it back to the user (or drops it onto his hard drive)
&gt;

Applixware creates Word docs I believe.


&gt;
&gt; My next best would be RTF. MS supports this, and there are a couple of editors that support it directly in linux: Ted and Abiword. Ted is pretty stable, I haven't tried the latest Abiword but it must be getting pretty good by now.
&gt;
&gt; My 2c
&gt;

PDF would be my choice as it is pretty much useable and creatable on any platform and non-editable.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; assumption that M$Word is a standard, not a proprietary format, and is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; supported by the Aus Government adds weight in my mind to my opinion
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that the Aus governments at state and federal level are ignoramuses. But
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that's just me ;))
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; What sort of format would be best?  Plain text?  RTF?  DVI?  PDF?  HTML?
&gt; &gt;&gt; TEX source??  DOC pisses me off infinitely :(
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I like the idea of DVI or PDF - but everyone uses Word!  And Word can't
&gt; &gt;&gt; save as DVI or PDF!  As the techie at a govt dept - how can I help?
&gt; &gt;&gt; *grin*
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the absence of the ability to write as PDF, RTF would be good. I have
&gt; &gt; the ability to read in RTF on each of the systems I use. HTML would be a
&gt; &gt; good alternative for me personally, and I should say that both RTF and
&gt; &gt; HTML are used for *some* of the docs available from the ATO (bless 'em).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I'll join you for that beer.
