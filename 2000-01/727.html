&gt; &gt;       I am still running RedHat 5.2 on kernel-2.0.36-0.7
&gt; &gt; I am going to upgrade to RedHat 6.1  Is it recommended that I reinstall from
&gt; &gt; scratch or just download the proper rpms and install them and things should
&gt; &gt; be fine?  

I've also upgraded, but I use a different technique to David.

When I change a config file I place it under RCS control.
   (umask 007; mkdir RCS)
   ci fred.conf
   co fred.conf

   co -l fred.conf
   vi fred.conf
   ci -u fred.conf

Before upgrading I remove all the RPM backup files:
   find / -name "*.rpmnew" -print -exec rm {} \;
   find / -name "*.rpmold" -print -exec rm {} \;

Then upgrade by booting off the installation floppy/CD for the
new version and selecting "upgrade".  If you want to do it
owver then net, download the floopy image and write it to
disk using "dd" (see www.redhat.com for the instructions in
the Installation manual).

Now I find the changes
    find / -name "*.rpmold" -print
    find / -name "*.rpmnew" -print

RCS will now tell me what the change was
    rcsdiff fred.conf

and I can decide if I want to keep the change or not.

    To keep it, check in the new file
        rcs -l fred.conf
        ci -u fred.conf

    To discard it, back it up, then get back the old version
       rcs -l fred.conf
       ci -l fred.conf          &lt;-- save new version
       co -r1.2 fred.conf       &lt;-- get back old version
       ci -u fred.conf          &lt;-- make it the current version

The nicest thing about this approach is that if you decide
a few days later that the new config file was the one you
wanted, it is in the RCS history and you can fetch it back.

As David notes:
&gt; This can fall over if you have compiled binaries replaced by RPMS.

which is exactly why it is verboten for RPMs to touch /usr/local
and exactly why code you compile should be located there.  It
it just *has* to be located in a specific place, then use a
symlink into a file in /usr/local/somewhere.  This is also nicely
self-documenting.

&gt; I visited upgrades.redhat.com and wasn't sure where the
&gt; rpms would  be in.

There's no such web site.  You are probably thinking about
updates.redhat.com.  Other manufacturers would call these
"patches" or "fixes", so the updates are by no means all
the files you need for an upgrade.

You just want the stock-standard installation directory,
as in
  <A HREF="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-6.1/i386/">http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-6.1/i386/</A>
or thousand of other mirror sites.

When you are done, apply all the updates (ie: security patches) with:
  mkdir fred
  cd fred
  wget <A HREF="ftp://anonymous:">ftp://anonymous:</A>@mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/linux/redhat/updates/6.1/i386/*.rpm
  wget <A HREF="ftp://anonymous:">ftp://anonymous:</A>@mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/linux/redhat/updates/6.1/noarch/*.rpm
  rpm -Fvh *.rpm
  rm *.rpm
  cd ..
  rmdir fred

You might find it both cheaper and faster to buy a CD, especially
from a supplier that offers one with all the updates already applied.
