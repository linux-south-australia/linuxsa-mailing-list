&gt;&gt; Zombies are processes that have ended, but for what ever reason, bug or

&gt; I didn't realise that it was the process's responsibility to do that
&gt; (remove itself from the active process list)...

It's actually their parent's responsibility to collect the termination
status through wait() or waitpid(); if their parent has terminated,
then they're usually reaped by process 1, which coincidently happens
to be init.

&gt;&gt; They take no memory, and no CPU time, so are generally harmelss, tho I
&gt;&gt; don't know whether they can cause you to run out of processes on a
&gt;&gt; machine.

They can cause you to run out of process table space; I've seen
zombies take a machine down before, especially on Unices that
that have a fixed table size.
