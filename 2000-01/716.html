&gt; May I just enquire something here?  I &gt;&gt;THOUGHT&lt;&lt;  LinuxSA, is a
&gt; USER group.  My recollection of USER groups is to assist one another
&gt; in the special interest that we each have, in this case, Linux.
&gt; So...  I thinks to mesself as I do, why don't we run our own
&gt; NON-PROFIT course for our "members"?  This commercial stuff is all
&gt; very nice if you have company backing and/or can charge it to your
&gt; customer base.. but that means that there becomes those of us who
&gt; have, and the other those of us who will never have..

It's all pretty much been said, but so as not to sound like a "me too"
post, I thought I'd just throw my support in for Richard and his work.

1) Richard is a major contributor to the samba project, software that
has made my life easier from the day it was released. (Cheers Richard)

2) Richard has given talks at LinuxSA which I found interesting and
useful, because of their technical depth, subject matter and
presentation. I must have missed yours.

3) Richard answers many questions on this list, with his samba
configuration advice being second to none. I'll spare you the grep
results of the linuxsa mail folder.

4) Your (inadequate) definition of a user group makes Richard's
announcement perfectly valid, and I'm sure there are people here who
will go to, and benefit from, this course, who may not have know about
it otherwise.

Basically, in one post you have managed to insult someone who doesn't
deserve it, piss off many more people, show your ability as someone who
has lttle understanding of open source financial recouperation
methods, conveniently forget or miss Richards contribution to this
group and to samba, and prove how little you thought about what you
said.

However, you may prove myself and everyone else wrong by holding a
course, and I suggest you give it a serious go. That way you can
understand why you have been so publicly flamed.

Cheers

Alex!
