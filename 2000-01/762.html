If you look in the menus for gnome - there is a desktop switching tool
which allows you to nominate kde (as long as you installed it) as the
default desktop.

&gt; My RH6.1 was doing that (the delete key, not 'c'!), but after I rebuilt the
&gt; machine, the delete and backspace keys now work as per M$.  Hmmm...dunno what I
&gt; did, but it's working.  I don't know how to remap keys, or even find out their
&gt; current mapping, so I'm probably not much help, unless you can tell me where to
&gt; look for a keymap mods file.
&gt; Also, anyone able to help with GNOME/KDE setups?
&gt; RH defaults to GNOME when I log in, but I would like to change this to KDE as
&gt; the default, and only GNOME when I deliberately ask for it.
&gt; Ideas?
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers.

&gt; Subject:  Rebinding Delete to delete-char for editing
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have seen lots of Windoze types get very frustrated when they hit the
&gt; delete key to remove the character in front of the cursor, only to find
&gt; that it behaves like backspace.
&gt; 
&gt; I was interested to rebind that key to delete-char rather than
&gt; backward-delete-char as it currently is.
&gt; 
&gt; However, for the life of me, I have not managed to get bash to do it.
&gt; 
&gt; All I have succeeded doing is to unbind the 'c' key, so now I have to type
&gt; ^Vc to get a 'c' recognized.  I feel like I am in a Monty Python skit :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried:  bind "\C-?": delete-char
&gt; 
&gt; but it seems not to work ...
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any success with this?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
