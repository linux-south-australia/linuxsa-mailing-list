&gt;David,
&gt;Your knowledge of Linux FAR exceeds your knowledge of theology.

&gt;The point about sensitivity is that insulting sacred items or contexts is
&gt;NOT humorous, niether is it thoughtful or kind.
&gt;The RSL should not be expected to 'have a sense of humour' over the
&gt;desecration of a war memorial with funny cartoons.  Christians should not
&gt;be expected to 'have a sense of humour' over insensitive comments about the
&gt;birth of Christ.
&gt;Moslems should not be expected to 'have a sense of humour' over disparaging
&gt;comments on the life of Mohammed.

Unfortunately, all of this is rather like the pot calling the kettle black. 

Religious groups of all types have historically, as well as recently, shown
a decided lack of respect for the views and sensitivities of non-believers
and other-believers.  The Gnostics found this out to their detriment a long
time ago, and we have plenty of examples over time of other religious
groups being less than tolerant, including some Hindus towards some rather
zealous Christians in India recently. 

Secondly, there are valid lines of enquiry that religious adherants get
very hot under the collar about, and on occassions, get violent about.  For
example, looking at the borrowings of ideas between religions (cf
Hellenistic Mysticism and the cult of Diana ideas that seem to crop up in
Christianity, or the walking on water event that has a very clear, and
earlier, precursor in Buddhism).  Other examples include questioning the
current, popular, conception of Jesus (as Burton Mack does in 'The Lost
Gospel: The Book of Q'), is likely to get you a black eye in some
congregations.

Thirdly, while many religions loudly proclaim the need for 'sensitivity',
when they are in the majority, they put subtle and not-so-subtle
impediments in the way of other belivers, especially when they dominate the
government etc.

In addition, to hold the RSL up a paragons of tolerance, seems somewhat
tongue in cheek.

&gt;Trampling on other peoples belief systems deminishes you and requires that
&gt;you also accept crass insults to principles you might embrace now or later.
&gt;Please desist.

This is a useful concept, but one wonders what the boundaries are.  For
example, flat-earthers seem not worthy of much respect.

I certainly try to deal with these topics with sensitivity.

&gt;OK?
