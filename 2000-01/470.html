&gt; &gt; Although I've never actually used more than one window manager at

&gt; Ahh, but if you have lots of linux machines in your office and no
&gt; windows machines at all (yummy), and you come back from lunch to find
&gt; that certain people have commandeered your console, you can just pull
&gt; up the nearest linux machine, run `X -query hostname :1` and you get
&gt; your desktop back without moving anyone.

Is this documented anywhere? I looked in 'man X' and saw nothing
relating to the -query option... although I did try running it on my
local machine to see what would happen... I went to the virtual terminal
on C-A-F1, and typed "X -query dagar :1", and it brought up an X Server
on vterm 8 (there's already one running on 7). However, all I got was
the stipple pattern and an X Mouse icon -- no wm, etc.. I can still use
the X on 7, but can't do anything on 8... Did I misunderstand what you
meant, or am I supposed to be able to get access to my running desktop
from another machine? This seems unlikely to me, but then, I've been
surprised by X before (positively, and negatively)... Maybe it's not
working because I am on the one machine...

ooh ooh -- just got an error message... 

XDM: too many retransmissions

I normally use gdm... hmmm -- I think this may have something to do with
either xdm/gdm or doing it all on the one machine...

any explanations?

TIA
