This is no flame, although I realise many of you will choose to interpet
it as one.

&gt; In an effort to gain something positive from an unfortunate beginning, may
&gt; I suggest that Paul is expressing frustration that GNU/Linux is very
&gt; difficult for the neophyte to get to know, and that the beginner level of
&gt; help is quite hard to find.

I completely disagree.  I'm tired of people whinging about how difficult
unix is, and how expensive the training is, and how hard it is to find good
help.  Damn it, help is not hard to find.  It's right there under
everyones' noses.  The source is freely available, as are man pages, howtos
and info.  If that's not enough then perhaps the problem is stupidity, or
rank laziness.  Often it's the latter.  Unix is easy.  I learned it by
reading the manual and tickling the ivories.  I'm talented, but no genius;
it would have been easier with the source.  I had lesser resources than are
now widely available and since I taught myself, so anyone else can do the
same.

Perhaps "beginner level of help is quite hard to find" because many
beginners refuse to help themselves.  Faced with the arrogance of a  demand
for an instant answer, or even abuse when pointing out the option of a
commercial course, it's not surprising that many people sit quietly back
and don't waste their time even trying.  Most questions asked here are
widely covered in available literature.  You'd think search engines were
novel.  How do you remove the file -f?  rm ./-f.  How do you remove the
file -f? rm ./-f.  How do you remove the file -f?  FOAD you stupid,
snivelling fool.  Well I feel sympathy, understand the frustration, that
evokes such an answer.

It's lovely that so many of us freely give of our time.  It's hateful that
so many of us are flamed for giving the best of answers: Read, young thing,
and you will learn.  Anybody who won't teach themself -- and it's not
can't, it's not too busy, it's not too difficult, it's simply willfully
won't -- should pay Richard, or any of the many other fine trainers.  Just
do it quietly; and stop whinging.

Boy that sounded like a flame.  It wasn't.
