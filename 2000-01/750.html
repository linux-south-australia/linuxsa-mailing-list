Sometimes people react badly to my posts that flame people who make
comments that go along the lines of "We should drop this thread
because of blah". Most people know how much I hate those type of
posts, and that I always give my opinion on them. Invariably there
will be a few people who miss my point and say "You're no better,
you're doing it too".

The point is that it is one thing to give your opinion on a subject,
and it is another thing to expect people to discontinue a discussion
becuase your opinion differs from that of the person discussing.

I thought I'd highlight an example of the (rarer) opinion *WITHOUT*
the accompanying "so we should drop it" remark that to be honest
pisses me off almost as much as the people who chime in with the "but
your no better" remarks. (I expect them to follow this post too
*sigh*)

&gt; In all seriousness, if you want to flame Richard for "advertising", go
&gt; for it, it was after all, a tad commercial (altho I was not bothered by
&gt; this fact and there are quite a few people on this list who are employed
&gt; in the industry & whose employers would pay for the course so what
&gt; better way to advertise ;))).. but to bring all this other crap into the
&gt; debate is really quite petty and somewhat irrelevant. 

A "This topic is pointless" without a "so lets drop it".

Onya Phil.

Cheers

Alex!
