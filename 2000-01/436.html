Hi,

&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; 	- ELF binary Support

Thankyou that helped.

&gt; 	- Support for the drive linux is on. If you have ide then it's the
&gt;           IDE Disk block device. If you have scsi then it's the scsi
&gt;           driver for your card and scsi disk support -If it's in the
&gt;           kernel then you won't need to use mkinitrd to load it as a
&gt;           module.

And compiling in the SCSI drivers seems to have now fixed the
problem. Many thanks to all thos who contributed comments to this problem.

What is interesting here is that Redhat has provided this RAMdisk option
to preload modules, many others haven't. I had downloaded a standard
kernel from kernel.mirror.aarnet.edu.au, but things like the HowTos are
fairly brief on SCSI supprot for a pure SCSI system. None of the
documentation seems to say you might need this option or not for a pure
SCSI system.

It now can't find module st, but that doesn't seem to have slowed or
stoped any devices (I assume its a SCSI mudule for something Segates ?),
but I think that is driver stuff for the CDROM or Tape Drive, already
compiled into the kernel.

It is now down to a module problem anyway.

Tanks
