Just thought it would be worthwhile to discuss *why* LinuxSA exists and what
I was trying to achieve when I started LinuxSA.

LinuxSA is a user-group.  It is a usergroup of people who use Linux in *any*
capacity.  

Irrespective of what the cost is, he is making the informing the group (and
yes I have asked him to add a COMMERCIAL or TRAINING tag to the subject which
he has agreed to comply too).

There are all sorts of people out there, and as a consequence there are some
who want some sort of monetary return for their work. Other will do it for the
sake of it.  We can have both, but if someone has gone to the effort then 
they are entitled to make the choice.

By the looks of it there is enough interest on the list for Richard to 
consider running the the course filled possibly with LinuxSA people alone.

Remember that this is a User group.  Which includes &lt;HOME&gt;-User, &lt;OCCASIONAL&gt;-
User and &lt;PROFESSIONAL&gt;-User (and many others who I can't think of at 
the moment).  Some things will be revelent and available to some types of
users, others won't.

Richard has my support for what he has done and offererd to the group, but
if someone wants to do something targetted at the HOME-User, then they
will have my full support aswell. 

&gt; Yes, that's all very nice for those of you to whom money is no object, but why
&gt; are you advertising, and at the same time trying your damndest to justify the
&gt; cost, on a USER group mailing, when it it obvious that you have no intention
&gt; of helping those in this user group?  Your fees are obviously "proffessional"
&gt; but your approach is not.
&gt; 
&gt; SO, I throw down the gauntlet.  Make it available, by other means if
&gt; neccessary, to us mere mortals, or get off the mailing list.  I will go so far
&gt; as to say those of you out there who ARE interested in learning about Linux
&gt; (but don't have the means to pay for a "proffessional" course - (you could go
&gt; and do a MSCE for about the same.. and have a "guaranteed" job at the end of
&gt; it!!)) Let me know directly and if I get enough interest I will investigate
&gt; further to see what resources I can pull together to make our OWN course
&gt; happen.  However, I can only do this in Adelaide, so I apologise to people
&gt; from elsewhere for missing out.
&gt; 
&gt; I BET we, as a group, could run a course too.  The User group meetings are a
&gt; great way to get info and see how things work, but a "course" would cover the
&gt; required topics in an ordelerly manner to ensure nothing was missed and of
&gt; course would do it in a shorter time frame.  The user groups meetings are but
&gt; once a month which means it would take a year or so to cover the "basics".
&gt; (I'M  &gt;&gt;NOT&lt;&lt; bagging the user group meetings at all, just suggesting there
&gt; may be another way to do this.)
&gt; 
&gt; I have already mapped out a multi-stage course for Linux training, as I have
&gt; had this in mind for quite a while.  I am sickened by the few people on here
&gt; who think they are just so o o oo  good and therefore expect the rest of us to
&gt; pay up or shutup because THEY are PROFESSIONALS.  I say Bah, Phooey to  you.
&gt; Get off your high horses and come down to user group (human being) level.
&gt; 
&gt; There, I've finally said it.
&gt; 
&gt; Even so, best reagrds to the Linux community,
&gt; PaulK.
