&gt; All you write is OK, but can anybody tell me if MS claims hold water? Can
&gt; anybody tell me why these error messages appear? If not it will be
&gt; impossible to convince most IT managers to switch from NT to Linux. Because
&gt; of this FUD from MS and the lack of well proven arguments that the FUD from
&gt; MS is what it is (FUD), I'm bearly allowed to run a test box with samba in
&gt; our network.
&gt; 
&gt; Confused? Well, what I'm trying to say here is: There ARE grate scepticism
&gt; whit MANY IT-managers to Linux and other Open Source software. The main
&gt; reason for this is that is MS well working marketing strategies with FUD,
&gt; and the inabillety to prove MS statemens wrong. It does not help to say
&gt; Linux is faster, more reliable etc, Samaba can take care of your file
&gt; sharing as well or better than NT... You have to PROVE it is, not just
&gt; claim it! I will not try to find out how you can prove it, I just can say
&gt; that I personally are more comfortable with Linux than NT. So to get people
&gt; to turn their head we have to tell them why MS claims are not true...
&gt; 
&gt; Comments?
&gt; 
&gt; Regards Jo
&gt; 

Yeah. Agreed.

I know people who say "yeah - linux is cool" but when it comes to
actually putting it into place in a commercial situation - they
mysteriously just *opt* for NT....


ANother thing people say, is "Yeah but in NT you just click away and you
can do blah blah blah." and I reply with, "sure, but in linux you
actually have to know what your doing."

NT becomes - "knowing the tricks and trip hazards of the GUI"
Linux becomes - "just knowing your shit"

Nt troublshooting is - "look in TechNet to find the bizaar combination
of bad error messages to find the solution"
Liux becomes - "read the doco/FAQ, contact the author/mailing list,
download fixes/patches and/or recompiling the source code."

To some, the linux troubleshooting is way too hard. 

Maybe a linux techNet would be cool.....
