As was pointed out last year on this list, at least several times, (and
all present in the archives, I presume...), zombie processes are a
normal part of the operating of the O/S.
A process exists in its zombie state when it terminates, but it's parent
process has not yet acknowledged it's death, by doing a wait,waitfor, or
similar command. (This is neccessary to collect return codes, etc.)

The processes actual code and memory pages, etc. are all unloaded, and
it is not considered a candidate for being swapped to. Thus, they don't
load your system down in any way. They do use a PID up, but since you've
got a lot, this generally isn't a problem.

If you had a (very) badly written program, that kept spawning child
processes and never checking on them, then theoretically you could fill
up your process table. However, as soon as this parent process died, it
would take all the zombies away with it. Users have a maximum process
limit anyway, so a user would not be able to bring your system down by
trying to exploit this.
If you do see heaps of zombies appearing, then do a ps list with the
parents being shown in a tree, and you should see the offending app.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Zombies are processes that have ended, but for what ever reason, bug or
&gt; &gt; something, haven't removed themselves from the active process list, hence
&gt; &gt; the inability to actually kill them.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't realise that it was the process's responsibility to do that
&gt; (remove itself from the active process list)... I would have thought
&gt; that the kernel would maintain that, and as soon as a process ceases
&gt; execution, it would be removed... I'm probably mistaken, though...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; They take no memory, and no CPU time, so are generally harmelss, tho I
&gt; &gt; don't know whether they can cause you to run out of processes on a
&gt; &gt; machine.
&gt; 
&gt; So for all intents and purposes, they are not there, apart from an entry
&gt; in the active processes list... ?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sometimes they can clear themselves, sometimes they disapear when a parent
&gt; &gt; process is completed, and sometimes the only disapear when you reboot.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Generally ignore them, unless you are getting alot of them, in which case
&gt; &gt; it could indicate a misbehaving program.
&gt; 
&gt; Nah, just noticed one, and wondered (also remembered the existence of a
&gt; previous thread, but don't remember the content of the messages...)
