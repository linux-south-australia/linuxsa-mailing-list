&gt;The previous sound card I possessed supported multiple instances of sound,
that is if I was listening to a mp3 at the same time I was able to listen to
other sounds that were made by minimizing or maximizing of windows or any
other instances, I was even able to do mixing by starting two mp3 players.
But it isn't possible now. If I am listening to mp3 or wav or midi and
simultaneously I want to start another instance of sound a message is shown
that the sound card is busy. Now please tell me what is the actual problem
and besides that I will also like to know that what type of sound cards are
better the ISA one or the PCI one.



In most cases PCI sound cards are better than ISA's (eg, SB Live PCI opposed
to SB16 ISA) only really because the PCI's are newer, therefore the
technology is more developed. It sounds like your ISA card was a full duplex
sound card, and your PCI is either not a Full Duplex sound card, or Full
Duplex is not enabled. I would recommend a SB Live Value ($105) for use with
Linux. They are definantly a full duplex card, plus Creative have linux
drivers for the SB Live(opensource.creative.com).
