Greetings all,

I am updateing a RH6.0 (Hardware details on demand), including the kernel
to version 2.2.13.

I've sucessfully downloaded the source, and built a kernel, that works
perfectly except that nfsd doesn't load.

A bit of research on the net indicates that that in &gt;2.2.4 this is now
built into the kernel as knfsd, and access it by adding the option of
prompting for development and/or incomplete code/drivers, then adding in
NFS serving (and SUN nfs serving as this is what it will be sharing to).

The problem here is that when trying to load this kernel, an error message
of two lines continually scrolls up the screen too fast to see before
logging starts, but seems to be involved with being unable to find or load
some module or other.

I've tried re-building with all important stuff in the kernel rather than
modules (networking, SCSI support, NFS support), but the same error
occurs.

I've even tried a clean source directory.

Does anyone else have experience/suggestions in solving this problem ?
As a related side issue, what are the relative merits of having devices
compiled into the kernel vs kernel loadable modules ?

thanks
