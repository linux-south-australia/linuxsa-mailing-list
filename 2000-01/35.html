&gt; Linux NTP server experts:
&gt; 
&gt; I've just been trying to get an NTP time sync off
&gt; augean.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au, without success.
&gt; In fact, it doesn't answer to ping either.
&gt;
&gt; Even if it's going to come back up some time soon,
&gt; I still need a good NTP source to replace this some day.
&gt; 
&gt; All of the Adelaide NTP servers which I've looked up in
&gt; lists before have been "by invitation only", or need
&gt; some sort of arrangement with the people running the server.

The irony of using an 'Adelaide' based system is that the being 
a Telstra customer you actually go through the melbourne 
Telstra/Optus gateway.

&gt; Can anyone please tell me just which computers in Adelaide
&gt; are available for use as time standards?

Don't think physical geography, think Network Geography.

Some of the NTP sources that I have found on public lists are..

129.127.28.4 augean.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au (11 hops)
203.21.37.18 ns.saard.net (10 hops)
192.189.54.17 yarinna.connect.com.au (8 hops)
130.155.98.1 tictoc.tip.csiro.au (13 hops).

Of these, I use yarinna (which is close network wise).
NTP can be configured to use mutliple time servers and makes 
decisions on a number of metrics.

&gt; If there are equally good servers outside Adelaide, I could
&gt; you those instead, I suppose.
&gt; I'm really looking for a server that I can use without
&gt; having to enter into some sort of "arrangement".

Most are either, send an email or something similar.

In general though, unless you have *absolutely* hard time constraints
working of a stratum 2 or 3 server suffices for most purposes.

My systems typically are running with an offset of +- 20 ms to yarinna.
Which IMHO is better than the 1194 set the clock to the telstra voice
technique.

Also keep in mind that some hosts syncronise to other hosts (yarrina
synchronises to tictoc so it is pointless having both).

Regards,

Matthew
