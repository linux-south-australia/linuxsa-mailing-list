&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree with you though - I really like using Internet Explorer.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's a pity there isn't a browser that sleek and fast for Linux...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone used Opera yet?  Specifically, the Linux version?  Any
&gt; &gt; opinions?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, specifically no tho - I've used the Windows version, after it was
&gt; mentioned on slashdot a while ago.
&gt;
&gt; My opinion?  Well - I uninstalled it after two days..  try it and you'll
&gt; see what I mean :(  I don't think it's nice to use, anyway :)  That's
&gt; just MHO tho - anyone else?  Does anyone enjoy using it for any reason
&gt; other than it's not MS?
&gt;

Well I've got to say that Opera is my browser of choice when I venture down
the dark pit that is windows. It's small, wickedly fast, allows things like
tiling and cascading windows (god I miss that), doesn't take up 20 spaces on
the pop up status bar at the bottom (just the one), has supposedly got great
security, is far more stable than IE or Nutscrape and the whole thing fits on
a floppy.
The biggest down side to it is that ya have to fork out the dollars to get it
for more than 30 days, but I'm sure there are ways around that, not that I'd
ever suggest that people try :)
Im pretty keen (as you can probably see) to give it a try but I'll wait until
it gets to at least a Beta release.
