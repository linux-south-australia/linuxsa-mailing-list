It all comes down to the fact that there was no year 0, there was 1 BC
followed by 1 AD. Therefor 1 plus 2000 means that the 3rd millenim starts
0:00:01 January 1st 2001.

&gt;&gt;0 is the first number in the units, ten is the first number in the tens,

&gt;Perhaps you ought to join the Sophist Party?
&gt;Your argument is erudite, but also erroneous.
&gt;
&gt;You can choose to teach your two-year-old daughter the concept of zero, so
&gt;that when she is asked to count the number of digits on her hands, she
&gt;first waves the said hands aimlessly in the air to indicate zero before
&gt;touching the first digit and saying "one".  What the poor child will do
&gt;when asked to continue with toes, Heaven knows.
&gt;
&gt;Your hybrid system would also have us engage in the logical absurdity of
&gt;the first hundred ending at 99 and the SECOND hundred starting at ONE
&gt;hundred.  Happy counting!
&gt;
&gt;Hopefully you will forgive the rest of us, who will continue to use the
&gt;system which has served us well (AND ACCURATELY) for several thousand
&gt;years.  In our DECIMAL system. the first digit is ONE.  In our system the
&gt;first hundred starts at one and ends (logically) at 100.  The second
&gt;hundred starts at 101 and ends (also logically) at 200.
&gt;Thus the second millenium ends (logically) at 2000.
&gt;The third milleniun begins at 2001.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The first millenium just missed out because of mistakes
&gt;&gt;made in the past.
&gt;
&gt;The "mistakes" seem to have provided us with a highly acceptable level of
&gt;accurate measurement and calculation over a considerable period.  Please
&gt;note that ours is a DECIMAL system, ie to the base 10.  Your system would
&gt;have us use 11 digits (0 plus 1-10) some places and 10 in most others, ie
&gt;to the base whatever-you-need-at-the-time.  You can use it if you wish.
&gt;
&gt;Happy millenium (when it arrives) :-)
