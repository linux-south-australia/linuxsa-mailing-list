Hi,

I have seen lots of Windoze types get very frustrated when they hit the
delete key to remove the character in front of the cursor, only to find
that it behaves like backspace.

I was interested to rebind that key to delete-char rather than
backward-delete-char as it currently is.

However, for the life of me, I have not managed to get bash to do it.

All I have succeeded doing is to unbind the 'c' key, so now I have to type
^Vc to get a 'c' recognized.  I feel like I am in a Monty Python skit :-)

I have tried:  bind "\C-?": delete-char

but it seems not to work ...

Has anyone had any success with this?


Regards
