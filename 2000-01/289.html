&gt; &gt;David,
&gt; &gt;Your knowledge of Linux FAR exceeds your knowledge of theology.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The point about sensitivity is that insulting sacred items or contexts is
&gt; &gt;NOT humorous, niether is it thoughtful or kind.
&gt; &gt;The RSL should not be expected to 'have a sense of humour' over the
&gt; &gt;desecration of a war memorial with funny cartoons.  Christians should not
&gt; &gt;be expected to 'have a sense of humour' over insensitive comments about the
&gt; &gt;birth of Christ.
&gt; &gt;Moslems should not be expected to 'have a sense of humour' over disparaging
&gt; &gt;comments on the life of Mohammed.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, all of this is rather like the pot calling the kettle black.
&gt; 
&gt; Religious groups of all types have historically, as well as recently, shown
&gt; a decided lack of respect for the views and sensitivities of non-believers
&gt; and other-believers.  The Gnostics found this out to their detriment a long
&gt; time ago, and we have plenty of examples over time of other religious
&gt; groups being less than tolerant, including some Hindus towards some rather
&gt; zealous Christians in India recently.
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, there are valid lines of enquiry that religious adherants get
&gt; very hot under the collar about, and on occassions, get violent about.  For
&gt; example, looking at the borrowings of ideas between religions (cf
&gt; Hellenistic Mysticism and the cult of Diana ideas that seem to crop up in
&gt; Christianity, or the walking on water event that has a very clear, and
&gt; earlier, precursor in Buddhism).  Other examples include questioning the
&gt; current, popular, conception of Jesus (as Burton Mack does in 'The Lost
&gt; Gospel: The Book of Q'), is likely to get you a black eye in some
&gt; congregations.
&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, while many religions loudly proclaim the need for 'sensitivity',
&gt; when they are in the majority, they put subtle and not-so-subtle
&gt; impediments in the way of other belivers, especially when they dominate the
&gt; government etc.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, to hold the RSL up a paragons of tolerance, seems somewhat
&gt; tongue in cheek.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Trampling on other peoples belief systems deminishes you and requires that
&gt; &gt;you also accept crass insults to principles you might embrace now or later.
&gt; &gt;Please desist.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a useful concept, but one wonders what the boundaries are.  For
&gt; example, flat-earthers seem not worthy of much respect.
&gt; 
&gt; I certainly try to deal with these topics with sensitivity.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;OK?
