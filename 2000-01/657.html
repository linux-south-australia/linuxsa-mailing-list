Hi all - yeah I know, we already knew windoze sux! HOWEVER, I have
discovered to what degree windoze actually sux.  I built up a Pentium
for a win98 box for 1 of my kids. (They already have their own linux
boxes btw!) and discovered how "touchy" windoze is! I CANNOT INSTALL ANY
VERSION OF WINDOZE 95 or 98 on this PC! They all crash/lockup/bsod
endlessly 

Here's whats in the box:
Pentium-75cpu 
P5MP4 MotherBoard (PCI/EISA)  (Has an AWARD 4.50 PCI/EISA BIOS) (its an
old M/b btw)
SMC-ULTRA Network Card
S3 928 PCI Video Card
Standard Multi-IO/HDD Controller card
32 Mb FP-RAM
IDE Quad Speed CDROM
The BIOS can *see* hdd's up to 1.6Gb but doesnt seem to report them
correctly cos DOS/WIN FDISK only finds 
504Mb (NB: I cannot get lilo to install on a hdd larger than 504Mb
either btw - but runs fine on 408Mb)

I can install Linux on it & everything works fine! When I installed 98
on it, it crashed on the "starting ur system for the 1st time" screen -
crashed again when looking for PNP etc, crashed again halfway through
giving network card its IP number & basically every time I tried to
install anything bigger than abt 5Kb!!
After 2 hours of crap I gave up & tried to stick 95 (OSR2) on it....
same sort of problems... so tried WIN31 to 95 Upgrade... again same
probs. So, I stripped everything out & replaced all the cards & the CPU,
and the cdrom & the harddrive - same probs again! I even downloaded the
ecu (EISA Configuarion Utility just in case the eisa stuff was
screwed...no change - even tried to flash a bios upgrade - wouldnt take
it ;(  ) In short, there is something in the motherboard config that the
various flavours of windoze cant cope with!!
So.... has anyone come across this sort of prob before... is it
something to do with eisa??? I know that LINUX addresses hardware
directly - tried to get some clues but found stuffall abt Eisa in any
howto's etc. I have given up on making it a windoze box cos its a great
linux box (jsut stuck a 1.6Gb slave in which linux uses fine) BUT I am
really curious why windoze really wont work on this pc.

TIA, Phil
