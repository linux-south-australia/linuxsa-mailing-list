&gt; have to point out that you are almost two thousand years too late to
&gt; change that) we are now starting to live in the 2,000th year.  Next
&gt; year we will start the 2001st year.

I would like to have been there when Christ was born, and count the
number of times people said "Hey, it's year one...!!!" or "Hey, it's
really year zero!!!!!!!" 

Of course they didn't. The whole concept of us counting upwards from the
birth of Christ is an entirely arbitrary and arguably wrongly based
concept, that it seems to me to be utterly fallacious to be arguing that
this year or next year or any other year is really the end/start of a
millenium. Please, accept the arbitrary-ness of the start and milestone
points, celebrate this major date-change milestone, and celebrate with
like-minded 'true millenium' believers next year as well. I certainly
will be! And I bet Rick Walford will too, if asked ;)))

Oh, and my cat and cockatiel have proved to be Y2K compliant as well. I
just thought you'd like to know that.
