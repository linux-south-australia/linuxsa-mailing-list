&gt; On the subject of the political significance of
&gt; the net censorship, I think that the government
&gt; has hoodwinked even the intellectuals again.
&gt; I think the real point is that the govt wants
&gt; to assert sovereignty over the net.

Other intellectuals suggest other motives, for example
Marr suggests that the hardline Christians are sucessfully
lobbying government at present, and the increased level
of censorship is a reflection of their success at attempting
to cleanse Australian society of what they view as sin.

&gt; The same goes for the GST. It increases govt
&gt; monitoring of the economy enormously. The extra
&gt; reporting requirements are not an unfortunate
&gt; overhead - they are actually the main aim.

Doubtful.  Transaction-based statistics necessarily
have a delay of 1-2 months before they are reported.
Historical statistics are not of much use.  Governments
are much more interesting in indicators that "lead" real
economic activity, such as electricity usage by industry,
new housing approvals, and utilisation of international
airline flights.


&gt; Personally I think that this [GST] is a socialists' dream.

Which would explain PM Thatcher's and Milton Friedman's
enthusiasm for the VAT?


&gt; Everyone on the Internet has been fooled into thinking
&gt; that the censorship Bill is about censorship.
&gt; It isn't.

This is actually the common view, not an extraordinary
one.
