&gt; They don't so much plummet as land, but not necessarily on
&gt; the runway, as the pilot fatally discovered at the
&gt; Airbus's launch at the Paris Air Show when he attempted a
&gt; low pass over the runway and the computer misjudged
&gt; his intentions.

Flying at a height of 35 feet, at maximum angle of attack, below
the height of nearby trees, probably didn't help ;-)

&gt; The fault was attributed to poor user interface design --

*Partially* attributed.  I've got some detailed information about
this at home somewhere that I'll have to dig up some time.

&gt; it was not immediately apparent to the pilot that the
&gt; avionics computers had entered their landing mode.  And
&gt; the pull-up action of the pilot didn't automatically
&gt; disengage this mode.
&gt;
&gt; No not entirely unfounded FUD.  But no worse than the design
&gt; of the 747's engine mount.

Don't you mean the DC10's?  If so, from memory, that was mainly
due to ground crew not following documented procedure in engine
removal/refitting.  If you *do* mean the 747, then ignore me ;-)
