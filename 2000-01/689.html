Dear list,
              is there anyone else out there who uses TPG as their ISP.
I am trying to get the internet working but each time I dial up, the
connection tones complete and then the connection is severed about 10
seconds later. Is TPG detecting this as a Unix/Linux connection and
refusing it? (This question because I am not sure if TPG allows a shell
type access)

    I am dubious to whether any connection is made at all because after
the tones have stopped even before the diconnection is recognised it is
impossible to ping any hosts. I have configured the connection using the
network conf. util from the control panel and not the ppp dialer with
6.1 because I could not get my modem to initialise via that means. I
have an external Swann Smart 56k/V.90 modem. using init strings which
are as suggested by the manufacturer although no mention of Linux is
made.

Can anyone help me with this?

Regards,
            Nathan Millhouse
