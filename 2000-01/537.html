&gt; &gt; &gt; I think HTML is the way to go, or maybe RTF.  PDF really annoys me.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Recently I had to uninstall Acrobat Reader 4 and then install
&gt; &gt; &gt; Acrobat Reader 3 since the PDF file had a password/encryption method
&gt; &gt; &gt; that was only supported by version 3. (this was on my windows
&gt; &gt; &gt; machine though). I also think that Acrobat is hard to read on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; screen. Maybe plain text is the way to go so nobody can complain.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I don't recall a recent distribution of linux that _doesn't_ come with
&gt; &gt; a .pdf viewer of some description?
&gt; 
&gt; But not everybody runs linux - isn't the idea here to try to pick a good
&gt; universal standard for documents issued by govt departments etc?  But, as
&gt; somebody pointed out earlier, this could be a fruitless exercise.

You missed the subtlety of the post. This was in response to a
post about the annoyance of installing acrobat in windows on a Linux
mailing list.

You probably get it now!

Cheers

Alex!
