Hi Nathan

I use both TPG and RH 6.1.  And yes, I too had some early problems
connecting.  However, the PPP howto assisted greatly with this.

Basically, what I do now is this: run minicom to dial in.  TPG uses
text-based logins and not PAP, so this may be one reason that your
connects are failing.  After typing in my username and password, and
choosing 'ppp' as my choice, I leave minicom without resetting the modem
(ctr-a-q).  After this, I run pppd and everything seems fine.  Note that I
do this as root (ok ok, that's not good, but i don't think there's any
great security risk in doing this).

I strongly recommend you read the PPP howto, as this gives a detailed
explanation of what to do.  It also goes into how to create scripts that
users can use to dial in and log on automatically.  These too worked for
me, but due to reinstalls and laziness I haven't bothered with them again
:)

One thing to keep in mind is to run the pppd as soon as you leave minicom.
A good idea is to have it in your shell history so you can just tap the
'up' key a few times.  I had some problems at one stage due to TPG
disconnecting me, which i think was due to not starting pppd quickly
enough.

Another small but vital tip: make sure your modem's speed in both minicom
and pppd are identical.  The default init strings in minicom should work
ok with most modems.

Hope this helps, and once again, I stress you read to PPP howto.

Cheers, 

Tim Riley, TPG connectivity expert :)
