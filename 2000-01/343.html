 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Those which are confident that they are treating their people well enough

 &gt; 
 &gt; Yes. Yet you will still get the majority of people that will be willing
 &gt; to give it up for a higher paying job.

&lt;shrug&gt;  Whether that's the case or not, the training industry seems
to be booming nonetheless.  While there are exceptions to every rule, 
I suspect a quite large cross-section of companies and employees don't
think that way (and if you work for a company which does, why are you
still there? :-).  The fact that the workforce *is* so mobile is a 
fairly savage inducement for employers to treat them properly anyway,
and it isn't hard to negotiate a package you'll be happy with prior
to signing a contract with a new employer.
