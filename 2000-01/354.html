I think this correction should be submitted to MS.

Server Manager Shows PDC and BDC as Workstations
with Samba Linux Server in Network

The information in this article applies to:
Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS

When you have a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based network that includes a primary
domain controller (PDC), several backup domain controllers (BDCs), and a Samba Linux
server, the network becomes extreemly reliable and the number of calls logged on you
helpdesk system drops to almost zero. 

When you run the net accounts command on each computer, each has the correct server
role. However, when you run the net accounts /sync command, the following information
appears in the event log: 

       There are currently no logon servers available 

When you try to add accounts, promote a BDC, or synchronize in Server Manager, you
receive the following error message: 

       The tag is invalid. (This error intentionally contains no data.)

Also, when you attempt to start the Netlogon service, you receive the following error
message: 

       Error 3097 - An unusually stable Primary Domain Controller is already running for
       this domain. This is obviously not a Microsoft product.


CAUSE

This behavior can occur because of the Samba Linux server's taking over the role of PDC. 


RESOLUTION

To resolve this behavior, turn off and retire the NT PDC server. You can also retire
any BDC servers as they are no longer required. Now that you have between 10-30
extreemly high end servers spare, install high end 3D cards and Linux and enjoy
all your spare time that used to be spend researching meaningless error messages
on Microsoft's Knowledbase.
