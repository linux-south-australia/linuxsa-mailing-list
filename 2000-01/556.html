Hi Georgia,
    I am not sure what you mean exactly by setting Linux up,
maybe a cheap cd version to do it for you is what you need,
but I have a slightly different solution to your problem.
Since this is not just a Linux newslist I can probably get
away with this outrageous suggestion (we frequently speak of
BeOS and other Open Source Projects). I am studying Computer
Science part time at present, and recently finished the
Computer Architecture and Operating Systems part of the
Course. One of the resources my lecturer offered was
"Operating Systems: Design & Implementation" by Andrew S.
Tannenbaum - ie. the Guy who taught Linus Torvalds
everything he started with. This book has a copy of Minix II
on CD, all you need is a 386 to install it on. Minix was the
Operating System that Linus started out on when he talked
about starting Linux. The book is great, relatively cheap as
it is a student textbook, and inside has a complete Source
code listing for Minix, and talks about Architectural and
design tradeoffs using a real example, the code for the OS
you are using. I have not seen this done yet for Linux
(maybe someone should). I found it extremely useful in my
course, but haven't had time to play with it properly yet. I
find most of Andrew Tannenbaums books very good for study
resources so maybe you should check it out.

    Cheers!
        Andrew.

P.S. The ISBN for the book is 0-13-630195-9 It is a Prentice
Hall Book.

Subject: How to set up SPIM on Linux


&gt;I'd like to use Linux for my Computer Architecture class
&gt;but I'm having problems getting it set up.
&gt;
&gt;I've managed to 'unzip' the tar file but haven't figured
out
&gt;how to compile them to get a working version.
&gt;
&gt;Has anyone done this?  Does anyone have any suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Georgia
