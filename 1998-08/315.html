Hello everyone,

After only a few short days, an idea has become a reality and we are now
open for business. :) I am going to get a bit formal now because I have
been overwhelmed by the number of responses to the idea. (In excess of
100 people wanting more than 600 badges.)


PURPOSE FOR EMAIL:
This email is designed to let everyone know exactly what is happening,
when it is happening, and what to do about it.


RECIPIENTS:
This email is going to be posted to the LinuxSA email list and anyone
who
has contacted me directly. Also could it please be forwarded to HUMBUG,
SLUG, LUV, etc.


PRICING:
Prices for the badges have dropped due to the volume of orders.
*Small pat on back deserved by all.*
2 - 4		$2.00
5 - 9		$1.50
10 - 19		$1.20
20 - 100		$1.00
100+		$0.90

These prices will hold assuming that most orders already placed are
confirmed or increased.


ORDERING:
ALL ORDERS SENT TO ME BEFORE NOW WILL NEED TO BE RESENT/CONFIRMED!!!
I feel this is necessary for two reasons;
1) The price drop will result in many people wanting to change their
order.
2) Some people from outside of SA may want to save money by get in with
   their local usergroup's order instead of ordering from me directly.

All orders must be placed by email to <A HREF="mailto:nick.stock@dsto.defence.gov.au">nick.stock@dsto.defence.gov.au</A>
You will receive an email reply to verify that you order has been
received.

In your email you must include the following information:
1) Quantity (2 or more)
2) Method of payment. (cash, cheque, OZ Post money order...)
3) Method of pickup/delivery. (LinuxSA meetings, OZ Post...)

Orders payed for by cheque or money order must be for 6 badges or more
(eg, $9, I would rather not turn up to my bank with 100 cheques for $4).
Checks should be made out to "Cybernet Systems".
Money orders should be made out to myself "Nicholas Stock".

If you are unable to attend LinuxSA meetings you can receive you badges
by sending me a cheque and a stamped self addressed envelope.
This will mean that you will get you badges back quickly and
sent to the correct address assuming you know where you live. :)
Please make sure the return envelope is large enough and strong
enough to accommodate your order.


PAYMENT:
No payment is required at this time. You will be notified when it is
necessary, probably in about 2 weeks time. At this time I will supply
the address to post your envelopes to.

GRAPHIC:
The graphic on the webpage will be used since there has been no real
objections to it. (I have just realised that you really need to view
it in 16bit colour or it looks awful.)

WWW PAGE:
These details will appear on the web page, hopefully within the next
day.

Nick Stock
Cybernet Systems
