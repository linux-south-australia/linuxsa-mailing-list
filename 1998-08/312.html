&gt; While we're on the subject of dual motherboards, SMP computing, etc...
&gt; Does anyone have a dual pentium 1 board they'd be interested in parting

I have a Soyo Dual P100 motherboard, but only have one P100 CPU
for it. (Loaned the other one out and got a P200 in return). It only
takes up to 100MHz chips, but perhaps with a crystal change, who
knows. PCI and EISA slots, no onboard IO tho.

&gt; If it's cheap enough I'll buy it outright, or is anyone interested in
&gt; swapping it with a Sun3/50, or something?

Hmm. Anyone on the list want some Sun 3/50's? I have "several".

&gt; I've always been curious to play with multi CPU machines - I've built them
&gt; for other ppl, but only run NT4 on them.

SMP Linux is interesting for a while, but after spending $700 on the
board and $500 each on the two P100's the system was soon out of
date (as with everything in the PC world). I've heard the latest SMP
code is much more efficient, but I used to find that two CPU's
were approximately 170% the performance of one.
