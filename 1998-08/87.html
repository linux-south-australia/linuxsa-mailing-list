Hi everyone,

Many of you have already heard about my Toshiba/Microsoft saga.  Well,
it has finally come to an end.  Here's the story...

I purchased a Toshiba notebook on February 2nd this year from my local
Linux-friendly supplier (Nick Stock at Cybernet Systems).  Being the
devoted Linux user I am, I didn't want to pay for a copy of Microsoft
Windows if I wasn't going to use it.  Unfortunately, Nick informed me
that it was impossible to purchase a Toshiba (or practically any brand
of notebook) without Windows coming along for the ride.

When I received the computer, I noted that the License Agreement for
Microsoft Software stated that I did not have to accept the
agreeement, and if I didn't agree to its terms, I could contact the
manufacturer for instructions on returning the software for a refund.
That seemed just like what I wanted, so I contacted Toshiba in
Adelaide and spoke with Kon Karanastasis.  Apparently he'd never heard
of anyone wanting to return just the software for a refund, so it took
a while to explain what I wanted.  "I want to give you back the
Microsoft software and receive a cheque in return", "We don't do
that", "The license agreement supplied with the software says you
will".  Kon asked that I send him a letter explaining what I wanted,
along with a copy of the invoice for the notebook and he'd find out
what could be done.

Kon got back to me and the word from Sydney was that Toshiba would be
happy for me to return my notebook and receive a full refund, but they
were not willing to give me a refund on just the Microsoft Software.
I explained that this was unacceptable; the license agreement for the
Software specifically said that I could return just the Software.  Too
bad apparently; Toshiba have a contractual agreement with Microsoft
where they can't unbundle the software from the hardware.

I obviously wasn't happy with this, so Kon said that the person to
talk to was Laurence White (the Toshiba Product Manager).  I sent him
an email explaining the situation and was told essentially the same
thing.  I can return the notebook, but I can't return just the
Software.

If at first you don't succeed... so I asked again, explaining why his
reasons for refusing a refund were not valid.  He obviously didn't
like my arguments:

&gt; Geoffrey,
&gt;     
&gt; Toshiba is happy for you to return the complete computer system for a 
&gt; refund to the place of purchase. We are not willing to sell just the 
&gt; computer system to you.
&gt;  
&gt; If you have any further questions regarding this matter you will need 
&gt; to talk with our legal department.

I spoke to the ACCC & Consumer Affairs, and ended up going to see
someone from the Legal Services Commission who said that I could take
my case to the small claims court and I'd probably win, but if I
didn't then I'd be up for their expenses (plane trip from sydney plus
hotel accomodation).  I definately didn't want to take that risk, so I
decided to give in.

By this time, the model of notebook I had purchased was discontinued
(it had been about two months since I purchased it) and the next model
up was $700 cheaper than what I had paid for mine.  Since Toshiba were
offering me the chance to return the entire computer, this was
obviously a good deal.  They were effectively offering me $700 and a
notebook upgrade :-).  I didn't really want to pursue this option,
since I would still be paying for a copy of Microsoft Windows that I
didn't want (it's the _principle_ of the thing!), but I didn't see any
other option.

So I contacted Nick, who was quite happy to take the computer back
from me provided that his supplier would take it back from him.
Unfortunately, his supplier didn't like this idea and were quite
ticked off that Toshiba would say to me that I could return a
pre-loved, two-month old, and discontinued computer at their expense.
They wanted to know who at Toshiba told me this.

I then get an email from Kon who told me that "In respect to your
formal request for a refund for unused software on your Toshiba Laptop
Computer the matter is currently being assessed by our General Affairs
Division."  I thought that this was a bit strange, and I wrote back:

&gt; I'm a bit confused here, because my refund for unused software has
&gt; been assessed and denied three times already, each time with an offer
&gt; for me to return the entire computer, and the last time also telling
&gt; me that I'd need to contact Toshiba's Legal Department if I wanted to
&gt; take the issue of returning just the software any further.  After the
&gt; three refusals, I decided to take up the multiple offers of returning
&gt; the computer, so I contacted my supplier to arrange doing so.
&gt; 
&gt; Are Toshiba now reconsidering the refund for the unused software?  If
&gt; so, that is fine, but if it is refused (for the fourth time), I will
&gt; be again wanting to take you up on your offer for me to return the
&gt; entire computer.

The next day I received an email from Kon saying that Toshiba's
General Affairs Division had assessed my claim and were prepared to
offer me AUS$110.00 for not using the bundled software.  After
confirming that I'd be happy with their offer and waiting a while, I
got an email from Kon on the 21st of May saying:

&gt; Hi Geoffrey
&gt; 
&gt; Your refund cheque has arrived in Adelaide.
&gt; 
&gt; If you would like to return all documentation/software relating to
&gt; MS Windows to
&gt; Our office at 5 Hurtle Square you can pick up your cheque.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; 
&gt; Kon Karanastasis

I was satisfied with this, and since it was the principle of the thing
and not the money, I wasn't in any particular hurry to grab the
cheque.  After some hassling from a couple of LinuxSA members at the
last meeting, I finally went to Toshiba on Monday to pick up my
cheque.

Lo and behold, I now have a cheque for $110 from Toshiba in return for
an unused license for Microsoft Windows!

Many thanks to:
- Paul Ashton (of Samba fame).  Paul was the one who told me in
  January that when I purchase a laptop I should read the Microsoft
  Licence Agreement, and take note of the bit about a refund.
- Kon Karanastasis at Toshiba for being patient with such a strange
  request.
- Nick Stock at Cybernet Systems for being an all-round good guy.

No thanks to:
- Laurence White at Toshiba for three times denying my request for
  Toshiba to honour the license agreement they included with my
  computer.

If there's anyone else wanting to do a similar thing, note that you
must not have accepted the license agreement.  The way to not accept
it is to boot from a floppy disk and erase all partitions on the disk
as the *very first* thing you do with the computer when you receive
it.  If you boot Windows from the hard disk, you are deemed to have
accepted the agreement.

I should have a web page up soon with a bit more detail plus all the
letters & emails that went back and forth.

Regards,
