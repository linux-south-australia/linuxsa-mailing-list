Thanks to those who replied -- I have now discovered that the G100/G200
cards currently have no drivers available (unless you pay Xi, which I
won't -- I'm planning to use linux because it's free...), and the
Millenium II is pretty damn good -- I thinnk I'll go for the MII

&gt; 
&gt; I am about to buy a new PC, and will install NT4 and RH5.1 on it. My
&gt; question is about video cards: I am planning to get a Matrox Millenium
&gt; G200 (which uses a very different chipset to the Millenium II, and costs
&gt; much less) or a Matrox Productiva G100 (again, new chip), but am not sure
&gt; about the XFree86 driver situation. I can't see either of them listed on
&gt; the RH website, and I don't think that any other cards use this chip. They
&gt; are likely to be popular chips, so I would assume that some support is
&gt; likely at some stage, but would liek to know where I should go to find out
&gt; the latest info. I have also checked the Matrox site, and it has nothing
&gt; on Linux Drivers. My other Main options are the Diamond Viper 330 and
&gt; Matrox Millenium II, which are both supported by the SVGA server on the RH
&gt; website. Does this mean that I would get no acceleration from them? 
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any advice, recommendations or theories?
&gt;

&gt; Thanks!
&gt; 
&gt; PS If this is against the list rules, please accept my apologies -- I have
&gt; to order the machine tomorrow, and need the advice now...
