&gt;&gt; Its all pretty much in the title, for a PPP server what does everybody
&gt;&gt; else run to handle the Dial-in access part? I have currently got mgetty
&gt;&gt; handling a modem [it has problems].
&gt;
&gt; Yes.  Check out the AutoPPP option to mgetty.  It presents the login

I run uugetty, not mgetty, and it doesn't (didn't) support auto ppp
detection, so I grafted some bits from mgetty into uugetty.  Now it
seems to work like a champ.  I have a patch for getty_ps-2.0.7h, which
makes it recognise PPP the same way that mgetty does.  It also permits
you to add a new option to the uugetty.conf file, PPP=path, which is
how you tell it what program to execute when it detects a PPP session.
(It's analogous to a FIDO session.)  If you would like it, the patch is
at <A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/getty_ps-2.0.7h-rebel.patch.">http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/getty_ps-2.0.7h-rebel.patch.</A>

Apart from installing the patched version of uugetty, you must also
modify your uugetty.conf file(s): Add PPP=path, where path points to
your ppp daemon which must be configured to login using PAP + /etc/passwd
(so put the login option into your /etc/ppp/options file); or else point
path to a shell script which invokes pppd with the login option.  My users
all used to login to a shell prompt and then exec pppd, and they no doubt
will expect that to continue to work; so I have PPP=/etc/ppp/autoppp in
my uugetty.conf files, where /etc/ppp/autoppp is an executable shell
script containing:

   #!/bin/bash
   exec /usr/sbin/pppd +pap login

Probably +pap is not needed; but it doesn't hurt.

I found that I also had to modify pppd because it wasn't compiled for
shadow passwords, nor for Microsoft's extension which permits the client
to querey for DNS addresses.  In addition, when you specify the login
option to pppd, and if the secrets file exists, and if the client doesn't
have a secret in the secrets file, pppd would refuse access to the client.
I want to be able to have a secrets file for some clients, while also
allowing my users to authenticate themself with their password, so I also
modified pppd so that it permits a client to have no secret if the login
option is given.  For those who are interested, the patch is available at
<A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/ppp-2.2.0f-rebel.patch.">http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/ppp-2.2.0f-rebel.patch.</A>

As this is a new facility I have only told a small number of people about
it: staff plus three reliable subscribers.  It was installed August 2, has
been used successfully 10 times and has failed to permit a login three
times: once when I was testing; once for an unknown user; and once when
the password had expired.  It seems okay to me.
