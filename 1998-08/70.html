Hi all,

Forwarded from the Sydney Linux User's Group list.  It's a plug for
next month's Australian Personal Computer magazine, which will be
including Linux stuff (as always).

Um, I feel sort of slimy doing this, but...

FYI -- KDE 1.0, Enlightenment 0.14 (and supporting libs), kernel 2.0.35,
GIMP 1.0, (probably) latest SAMBA, as well as a whole host of other apps
are going to be on APC's cover CD. I only mention this because they were
demonstrated at the last SLUG meeting, and it might save some download time
and $. There's also a feature covering different Linux distributions. And
don't ask why a distribution wasn't included on the cover CD -- I tried
(really hard). There is something in the works, however, and that's all
I'll say.

Disclaimer: I am not APC's Linux consultant, so if I say, think or post
something stupid, it don't have nothin' to do with them ;-). I just make
databases. Now, if Geoffrey or James posts something stupid ... (just
kidding, guys).

Cheers,
Travis

PS -- It might be a good idea to let the editor (<A HREF="mailto:jwhite@acp.com.au">jwhite@acp.com.au</A>) know
that there is a great deal of interest in Linux coverage, and that we all
buy APC because we're all so interested in Linux, and that the cover CD
with Linux software is great value, and that it's nice to see a mainstream
computing magazine giving more than just token coverage to Linux, and that
because of this, some of us were thinking of renewing our subscriptions. If
these claims were outright lies, he probably wouldn't know the difference.
Not that you should lie or anything. You know ... hypothetically. And you
should probably wait until the issue is actually out (last Thurs. of the
month).
