Hi,

I have an IBM Thinkpad and I recently re-compiled the kernel, because it's
supposed to reduce the size of the kernel and make your computer run that
extra bit faster ;)

I run RedHat 5.0 and decided to download the rpms for the 2.0.35 kernel.
might as well get the best while you're at it! So, i did the "make
menuconfig", chose all my options. I then did the "make dep;make clean'make
zImage;make modules;make modules_install" and everything went fine. i copied
the new kernel over to /boot and changed /etc/lilo.conf to read it, ran lilo
then rebooted the computer using it. As far as i know, i've cone everything
correctly.

Then, i go back into the sourse directory, go into the pcmcia bit, do the
"make config;make all;make install" and then reboot again. it works (i
thought). the lights on my PCMCIA network card light up, but it never said
"adding device eth0..." which it used to say before i recompiled the kernel.
Meanwhile, I had been checking the PCMCIA-HOWTO and the Kernel-HOWTO,
because it was my first time making a kernel, and i wanted to get it right
(obviously). The PCMCIA HOWTO said i need to keep the ethernet devices on in
the kernel setup, but i can turn off all the devices in there, including the
portable ones. So i did that, but like i said above, it didn't make device
eth0 when it saw my pc card in it's slot. i then re-compiled the kernel with
_every_ ethernet device as modules, but when i rebooted again (and
re-complied the PCMCIA module) it didn't add my card again.

my questions are:
did I do somthing wrong?
does the 2.0.35 kernel or the pcmcia-cs for that kernel not support my pc
card anymore (it's an IC-Card)? It was supported by the initial kernel and
pcmcia stuff which was kernel 2.0.32
is there anything I can do to get it to work? (i'd still like to use the
latest kernel, incase there's things that are more useful, or security holes
fixed, etc) By the way, i can't write a driver for my pc card, nor will i
learn to (i'm learning for my exams currently, i don't have time ;)  )

thanks,
Andy
