Hi again,

OK, well basically I am getting a very positive response to the idea of
Linux PC badges but a few questions are starting to appear so I hope
this will answer them.

Q)	How many do you have to buy?
A)	As may as you can afford. :)
	I will structure the pricing towards multiple units but at the
end
	of the day, all orders, large or small will be accepted.

Q)	What is the "reasonable quantity"? - (See original email below.)
A)	Well lets just say it is in the hundreds. :) Hence the answer to
	the question above.

Q)	How can I get hold of the badges when they are ready?
A)	At this stage I intend to distribute them at the LinuxSA
meetings.
	Special arrangement are possible, eg courier/pick-up.

Q)	Is this a commercial money making scheme?
A)	Hahaha... In tune with the whole Linux mentality, this is a non-
	profit process so if necessary I will reduce the pricing to
remove
	any risk of making any money.

Q)	Is there a bulk discount?
A)	Yeah, why not.
	This is my initial idea of pricing. Please keep in mind that
this
	is very rough... but remember the more you buy the cheaper
	they become. The expense is in the printing run not the
	quantity.

	1	$3.00
	2 - 3	$2.50
	4 - 9	$2.00
	10 - 19	$1.80
	20+	$1.70 (maybe less)

Q)	Are there any legal issues I should keep in mind when using
	the Linux penguin?
A)	I don't have the answer... I am asking you guys!
	Hysterical scream over the intercom. "If there is a lawyer on
	board could they please come to the cockpit."

What I am looking for now is an idea of how many to order, so could
people please email me to let me know if they would like to take part
in this once in a life-time opportunity. :)
Responses of 2 or 4-6 (eg numbers) are preferred to "yeah I will have
some". Don't be afraid of responding, at this stage I am just interested
in a rough idea of the quantity, you are not obligated in any way!
Once I have a reasonable idea of how many to get I will find out an
exact price and mail everyone who has shown interest. Please be
aware that I don't intend to buy many more than are ordered so if
you want some please let me know to avoid disappointment.
Don't end up wiping your child's eye as the say "Why didn't Santa
come this year daddy?" &lt;\emotional blackmail&gt;

Also if anyone belongs to multiple Linux user groups and feels that they
may also be interest in this, either to do it themselves or to jump in
on our order (could result in significant price drops) please feel free
to
forward this email.

Since this looks like it will go ahead I will try and get an image up by
the weekend, for public review.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I was contacted the other day by a printing company that makes
&gt; those little badges that go on the front of PCs, trying to drum up
&gt; some business, and this started me thinking about printing up a
&gt; Linux badge. Something along the lines of the Linux Penguin
&gt; sitting on the word "Linux" also possibly having the words
&gt; "Powered by" floating above.
&gt; 
&gt; I have done a bit of inquiring and they should come in at about $2
&gt; each assuming we order a reasonable quantity. So what I am
&gt; wondering is, is there enough interest in something like this to
&gt; make the order viable?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I would make the final picture available on the web in
&gt; advance so that we end up with a design that pleases all (or at
&gt; least the greater %).
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know if people think this is a good idea. At $2 each
&gt; everyone should be able to buy plenty for themselves, friend, family.
&gt; Think of them as the perfect birthday/wedding/fathers-mothers day...
&gt; present. :) Be the envy of work mates, make a powerful statement!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway enough of the hype, now let the flame wars begin. :)
