I have a feeling that this question may violate the etiquette, but I have
an urgent need for an answer, and this is my best hope...

I am about to buy a new PC, and will install NT4 and RH5.1 on it. My
question is about video cards: I am planning to get a Matrox Millenium
G200 (which uses a very different chipset to the Millenium II, and costs
much less) or a Matrox Productiva G100 (again, new chip), but am not sure
about the XFree86 driver situation. I can't see either of them listed on
the RH website, and I don't think that any other cards use this chip. They
are likely to be popular chips, so I would assume that some support is
likely at some stage, but would liek to know where I should go to find out
the latest info. I have also checked the Matrox site, and it has nothing
on Linux Drivers. My other Main options are the Diamond Viper 330 and
Matrox Millenium II, which are both supported by the SVGA server on the RH
website. Does this mean that I would get no acceleration from them? 

Does anyone have any advice, recommendations or theories?

Please mail me: <A HREF="mailto:richard.russell@student.adelaide.edu.au">richard.russell@student.adelaide.edu.au</A> or
<A HREF="mailto:rarussel@cs.adelaide.edu.au">rarussel@cs.adelaide.edu.au</A>

Thanks!

PS If this is against the list rules, please accept my apologies -- I have
to order the machine tomorrow, and need the advice now...
