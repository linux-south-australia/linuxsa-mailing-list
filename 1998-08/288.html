(Andy, I hope you don't mind; I'm forwarding this email back to the
LinuxSA list as other people might find the information useful)

&gt; &gt; &gt;From what I remember, when you do a 'make install' of the pcmcia
&gt; &gt; stuff, it overwrites your /etc/pcmcia/network script with the default
&gt; &gt; pcmcia one.  Does 'rpm -V kernel-pcmcia-cs' show any errors for
&gt; &gt; /etc/pcmcia/network?  You may need to get just that file reinstalled.
&gt; 
&gt; Yay! you were right. that was the problem. now, i have one final question.
&gt; :)
&gt; 
&gt; I use the computer at school, and from home. At home, I use a different IP
&gt; from at school. Normally, i go into x windows and use netcfg, but i need to
&gt; reboot, because I don't know how to make the changes go into effect without
&gt; rebooting. could some one tell me please?

With PCMCIA, the easiest way is to pull out the ethernet card and put
it back in again.  For those who don't have PCMCIA ethernet cards, you
can run:
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart
Or if you're in the netcfg program: click on the interface, click
deactivate, then activate.

&gt; also, I would like to make 2 scripts, to make this easier. how do I make
&gt; them? As far as i know, you make a normal text file that does the commands
&gt; you want (and I think you need "#!/bin/bash" as the top line, or something
&gt; like that) then run run some command to make it executable? Well, if that's
&gt; right, what command do I run to make it executable?

That's right.  The command to make it executable is:
chmod +x yourfile

The commands in the shell script need to replace
/etc/sysconfig/network (for the hostname & gateway configuration) and
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 (for the interface
configuration).

BTW, you can switch netcfg PPP configs by switching between different
copies of:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/chat-ppp0
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets

&gt; Finally, at school i use a gateway, but at home i don't (that's why I don't
&gt; just switch my home network to use the same IP numbers). In Windows95 i just
&gt; put the gateway machine number in the gateway box. In Linux, i just do
&gt; "ifconfig eth0 gateway a.b.c.d" right?

No; you can use the network configurator to do this, or the commands
are:

route del default
route add default gw a.b.c.d
