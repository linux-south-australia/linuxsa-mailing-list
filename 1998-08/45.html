People,

Just making sure that I am not out of touch with the new Linux User.

I am doing a number of 'Introduction to Linux' talks over the next
month.  I am interested in hearing what people who have just started
with Linux would have been interested in doing just before they
started using Linux.

So far I have got this short list.  They will all be just on light side
during the talk.
	
	Linux as an Internet Client
		Netscape, IRC, TCP, IP Masq...
	Linux as a desktop machine.
		GIMP, Applix, Corel Office
	Linux as a games machine 
		Quake II, Quake, Doom
	Linux as a Development Environment
		Java, Fortran, C, C++, X
	Linux as a Server
		HTTP server, SAMBA, NFS, Oracle, Informix
	Linux as something else
		Beowulf, ports-ports-and more ports, emulation (wine, SNES)...
	Linux as a community
		Linux User Groups, contributing to Linux,
		Linux Community.

Any other areas people can think of?

On the demo side, I was thinking Netscape, Applix, Quake II, wine, SNES/N64
demos.  (Does any know of a good Quake II on Linux site?).

But anyway, I will be giving the first run of the talk at the Installfest on
Saturday, 15 August at about 11:30 AM.  

Comments on the content are more than welcome.

Cheers,

Matt
