&gt; My feeling on the subject of "is a PC badge the best option?"
&gt; is that it is probably the most professional looking choice.
&gt; Any other sort of extra "sticker" style of badge would look a
&gt; little like an amateur afterthought instead of a proud statement
&gt; of defiance (against the MS dominance of the PC industry)!
&gt; 
&gt; Coming from a reseller point of view (as a Linux provider)
&gt; it would be the perfect sort of thing to have going out on
&gt; Linux PCs or used as a promotional item. It would really
&gt; have that feel of professionalism ("they believe in their
&gt; product enough to have gone to the trouble") to have a
&gt; Linux PC badge.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that although most cases do have a spot for a badge,
&gt; the ones that don't should still look alright if it is carefully
&gt; placed in on of the top corners.

How about a simple clear sticker, like the "intel inside" and "Made for
Windows 95" ones? I suspect that most PCs would have a place for these...

&gt; 
&gt; But this is just my two cents.
