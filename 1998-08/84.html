&gt; Hello all.

Hi Nick,

you wrote:

&gt; A question for anyone who knows... 
&gt; 
&gt; I've got an S3-868 video card, and a monitor.  I also have a nother
&gt; monitor.  I want both of the monitors to work simultaniously from
&gt; one PC, for such fun appolications as moving the mouse between
&gt; screens, dragging windows between screens, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a feeling this email is going to look bad, because I haven't
&gt; ended any lines with CR... sorry if this is true...

Yes, it looked bad.

First, although you can move the mouse between screens, you can't drag
windows between screens, and each window can only be on one screen.

As for what you need...

XFree86 doesn't yet do multiple screens.  Apparently Metrolink have
donated their multi-head code to the XFree86 team, but it will be a
while before it appears in a released server.

Xi Graphics (<A HREF="http://www.xigraphics.com/">http://www.xigraphics.com/</A>) sell a multi-head (up to
eight screens) version of their Accelerated-X X server
(<A HREF="http://www.xigraphics.com/products/mxdata.html">http://www.xigraphics.com/products/mxdata.html</A>) for US$375.  There is
a list of supported boards available at
<A HREF="http://www.xigraphics.com/board/mx/bdindex.html.">http://www.xigraphics.com/board/mx/bdindex.html.</A>  I have no experience
with this product.  I once considered purchasing it, but it's waay
expensive, and I couldn't be sure that it'd work with my hardware
beforehand.

Metrolink's (<A HREF="http://www.metrolink.com/">http://www.metrolink.com/</A>) X server
(<A HREF="http://www.metrolink.com/metrox/ess.html">http://www.metrolink.com/metrox/ess.html</A>) supports up to 4 screens as
is (multihead is not a separate product).  Red Hat used to supply
Metro-X with their Boxed Set (up to and including RHL 5.0), but not
anymore.  The cost for Metro-X is US$39, and it supports the following
cards:
- Matrox Millennium 
- Matrox Millennium II 
- Matrox Mystique 
- Matrox Mystique 220 
- NOTE: Only one Mystique or Mystique 220 (not both) may be used in
  the combination. 

I use Metro X all the time with a Matrox Millennium and a Tseng
ET4000W32.  It's not supported, but it's working fine.  I'm running
whatever version came with Red Hat Linux 4.2.  I have no idea whether
later versions would work with this combination of video cards.

One of the issues with multiple screens is that the video cards must
not conflict.  For example, a VGA card (or similar) is expected to be
located at a particular address in memory.  If you have two of these
cards, there will obviously be problems if they both expect to reside
at the same location in memory.  On my Milennium, there is a switch
that lets you disable the BIOS.  That way, the ET4000 can be used to
boot the system unless X starts and turns on both cards.

In theory, a Millennium plus any other card should work, but perhaps
this unsupported feature of Metro X has disappeared in later versions.

I once tested two Millennium's plus the ET4000.  That worked okay too
(and it was pretty cool having a 2428x800 desktop), but there was a
bug in the version of Metro-X I was using that would cause the server
to lock up under particular circumstances.  The bug should have been
fixed by now, but I haven't tried a later version yet.
