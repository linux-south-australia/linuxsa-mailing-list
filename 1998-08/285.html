Hi again everyone,

	As I understand the manufacture, these badges are
	made and then attached to the pins/clips ..
	perhaps they can be supplied as "kit form"
	i.e. if you want a badge for your computer .
	stick it straight on, if you want a badge 
	adhere the badge to it ..

I am just a little concerned that there are a small number
of people who are unclear on what a "PC Badge" is.

It is the small (exactly 1" square) little plastic bubble that
that sticks to the front of your computer case in the
just slightly larger (1.x" square) depression. I have learnt
that when this sort of coordination occurs in the computer
industry, it is usually dumb luck. :) They usually have the
manufacturers logo on it.

It is not quite the same as the "Intel Inside" sticker
which although is cool enough tends to look like an after
thought because it doesn't have a nice little spot to
stick to.

It is possible to make just normal badges (sticker) as
opposed to PC badges but I don't think it would look
as good. If anyone already has a badge on their PC
because they bought it from a brand name supplier
and are concerned about removing it, I have a
hammer/chisel/knife that should do the job. :)
Seriously, they can be difficult to remove but it is
possible with a bit of effort. Some cases have a
hole behind the badge which you can push a
a skewer or similar through to remove the badge.
