Thanks Bill. But this didnot work either. can you explain what is nolinear option
means pls?
I simply don't understand why my the system doesnot work for SVGA. Anyway one
of the problems I noticed is that when I configre using Xconfigurator or xf86config
they don't return "clockchip values" ( or whatever) correctly. Always complain
about somethig when I try to probe clocks. For only instance it work xf86conif
returned a very low clock freq. value.

So is there a smart guy who can recognise my problem?

Below I attach my original problem and Bill's answer.




&gt;Try using the svga or S3 server (cant quite remember, I'm not on my
&gt;linux box at the moment), but use the nolinear option. I needed to do
&gt;this for my diamond S3 based card.
&gt;
&gt;ie to start xwindows type:  startx --nolinear -bpp 16
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;hope this is of some help
&gt;
&gt;Bill

**********************************************
I have encountered  problems in configuring Xwindows for Redhat 5.0. My video
card is Diamond  Stealth 3D 4000 (S3 Virge GX2). After unsucessfuly trying to
congiure this card, I downloaded a new driver for S3V GX2. But now, even though
system detects the video card, Xwindows simply does not work. The screen goes

blank and the system does not respond . 

I also tried to configure the system for a "SVGA" server but I came out with
a very bad resolution(something like 320*200),and I could not chage it to any
other video mode. Now finally the system works for "VGA_16" , but that doesnot
has multiple video modes. On the other hand the desktop is larger than the monitor.

I have already inquired few people but still no one came with a answer. 

I am a complete beginer to Linux and hope any one of you could help me.
