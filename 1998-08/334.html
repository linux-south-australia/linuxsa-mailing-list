Hi everyone...

&gt; 	I have been playing with the linux badge design, while I am no
&gt; expert
&gt; graphics designer I like most of us can tell what looks good and what
&gt; doesn't.
&gt; 	The original badge design looks good but some people have made
&gt; comment
&gt; about the penguin sitting on a reverse "L", perhaps a normal "L" would
&gt; be
&gt; more appropriate.
&gt; 	I have spent considerable time playing with the design, namely
&gt; reversing
&gt; the "L" and come to the conclusion that a reverse "L" is best.
&gt; 
&gt; 	My reasoning for this is as follows;
&gt; 
&gt; A reverse "L" means "Linux" horizontal on the bottom in the prime
&gt; position
&gt; with the "Powered" vertically up the side.
&gt; A normal "L" means "Linux" is vertical on the side while the "Powered"
&gt; bit
&gt; goes across the bottom.
&gt; It is for this reason I think the Reverse "L" is best, I would much
&gt; prefer
&gt; the word Linux to be most prominent.
&gt; 
This is exactly what I was thinking but as far as the "Linux" needing to
be
more prominent, doesn't the penguin (Tux) say it all.

&gt; There is also an issue of the image, I have built a high resolution
&gt; image
&gt; with nice shades and so forth but looking at the badge on my own
&gt; machine I
&gt; noticed that its design has only two colours, Question to Nick Stock
&gt; here
&gt; can the people who are going to print this make a photographic image
&gt; or are
&gt; we limited to two or three colours non photographic type?
&gt; We might have to stop and re think the design.
&gt; 
I have already sent the printer a copy of the image on the web page (to
give
them an idea of what we want) and they said that it would not be a
problem
so colour is not an issue.

&gt; I have knocked up a WEB page with all of the designs I have come up
&gt; with, I
&gt; intended to put the URL here but I cannot ftp into my WEB Site at the
&gt; moment, as soon as I get the jigger to work I will let you know,
&gt; hopefully
&gt; real soon.
&gt; 
I will ask Paul and anyone else for that matter to please email me any
graphics that they want to be considered for this project as soon as
possible and I will put it up on the web page, or at least the URL so I
can add a link. I would prefer just the graphic though, because think
it is best to have just one URL for this thing.

If you want to send me an image or a link to your work then please
email to me both at home and work since I cannot edit the web
page from work.

<A HREF="mailto:nicks@lynx.net.au">nicks@lynx.net.au</A>

As I have said before I would like to have the order in very soon
(couple of days) so as soon as I get the images from Paul I will
start taking votes on which one to use.

Nick Stock
