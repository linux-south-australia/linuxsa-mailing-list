&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I was contacted the other day by a printing company that makes those
&gt; little badges that go on the front of PCs, trying to drum up some
&gt; business,
&gt; and this started me thinking about printing up a Linux badge. Something
&gt; along the lines of the Linux Penguin sitting on the word "Linux" also
&gt; possibly having the words "Powered by" floating above.
&gt; 
&gt; I have done a bit of inquiring and they should come in at about $2 each
&gt; assuming we order a reasonable quantity. So what I am wondering is, is
&gt; there enough interest in something like this to make the order viable?
&gt; 
&gt; Of course I would make the final picture available on the web in advance
&gt; so that we end up with a design that pleases all (or at least the
&gt; greater %).
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to know if people think this is a good idea. At $2 each
&gt; everyone should be able to buy plenty for themselves, friend, family.
&gt; Think of them as the perfect birthday/wedding/fathers-mothers day...
&gt; present. :) Be the envy of work mates, make a powerful statement!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway enough of the hype, now let the flame wars begin. :)
