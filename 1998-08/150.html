&gt;  BM&gt; Has anyone got any idea how to control the sound volume of the

&gt;  BM&gt; beast under that sort of environment??

&gt;

&gt;I'm not sure I understand the question, (because my answer is so

&gt;easy), but anyway, here goes:

&gt;

&gt;  Have you tried `kmix' the KDE mixer?


Phil,

You certainly did understand the question, and the answer was the one I was
looking for. (trees, forest, blah blah :)))))

Thanks, the volume switch in kmix was my godsend. My old sound card had a volume
dial built into the back of the card, so I was thinking hardware and low-level
hardware control. Trust those KDE guys to have done the hard work for me!!!

I now have what to me is the ultimate desktop solution, given the state of
technology at the moment. Boy am I impressed. I have to use win95 all day at
work as a business tool and a front-end to AIX and Mainframe systems, and you
just have to experience the difference every day to know how far Linux + KDE +
Applix + (insert favourite free software here) comes out in front, and the
only software I paid for was Applix, and so cheap it was as well!!!.

I have been discussing the future of Linux at a philosophical level with
work-mates lately. I think the advent of large mid-range style apps when
Oracle etc come on line will be a huge quantum leap in the user base at server
level. I also think that if Applix was made available free for non-commercial
use on Linux, it would provide that missing link and cause a large-ish exodus in
the desktop market. It would not necessarily be a nett loss for Applix, as the
people who use it free would all then know how well it stacks up, and cause
(by weight of opinion) the market to grow commercially. My opinion is that
that is, by default, what Gates did with Microsoft products, by not
copy-protecting them for so long. Food for thought?????

(falls off soapbox)

Cheers,

Bruce
