If all you need is PPP with PAP then you could permently
attach pppd to your serial port with the modem on auto answer.

Very simple, clean and easy!

/etc/ppp/options 
	Your.Host.IP.address:10.0.0.5
	asyncmap 0
	+pap
	-mn
	#ipcp-accept-remote   (uncomment this if remote is allowed 
	crtscts			to specify their own address)
	lock
	modem
	lcp-echo-interval 30
	lcp-echo-failure 4	(How many failures before forced
	-detach			disconnect)

A small script with an endless loop that restarts pppd in case it dies and
away it goes!

Set the pap secrets file to
 
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets

# Secrets for authentication using PAP
# client        server  secret                  IP addresses
demo            *       ""                      10.0.0.5

^^^		^	^			^^^^^^^
|||		|	|			|||||||
Login name   anyhost Use /etc/passwd		The only allowable address
						Leave blank if any allowed

No shell access and low overhead ;-)

&gt; &gt;&gt; Its all pretty much in the title, for a PPP server what does everybody
&gt; &gt;&gt; else run to handle the Dial-in access part? I have currently got mgetty
&gt; &gt;&gt; handling a modem [it has problems].
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes.  Check out the AutoPPP option to mgetty.  It presents the login
&gt; 
&gt; I run uugetty, not mgetty, and it doesn't (didn't) support auto ppp
&gt; detection, so I grafted some bits from mgetty into uugetty.  Now it
&gt; seems to work like a champ.  I have a patch for getty_ps-2.0.7h, which
&gt; makes it recognise PPP the same way that mgetty does.  It also permits
&gt; you to add a new option to the uugetty.conf file, PPP=path, which is
&gt; how you tell it what program to execute when it detects a PPP session.
&gt; (It's analogous to a FIDO session.)  If you would like it, the patch is
&gt; at <A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/getty_ps-2.0.7h-rebel.patch.">http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/getty_ps-2.0.7h-rebel.patch.</A>
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from installing the patched version of uugetty, you must also
&gt; modify your uugetty.conf file(s): Add PPP=path, where path points to
&gt; your ppp daemon which must be configured to login using PAP + /etc/passwd
&gt; (so put the login option into your /etc/ppp/options file); or else point
&gt; path to a shell script which invokes pppd with the login option.  My users
&gt; all used to login to a shell prompt and then exec pppd, and they no doubt
&gt; will expect that to continue to work; so I have PPP=/etc/ppp/autoppp in
&gt; my uugetty.conf files, where /etc/ppp/autoppp is an executable shell
&gt; script containing:
&gt; 
&gt;    #!/bin/bash
&gt;    exec /usr/sbin/pppd +pap login
&gt; 
&gt; Probably +pap is not needed; but it doesn't hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; I found that I also had to modify pppd because it wasn't compiled for
&gt; shadow passwords, nor for Microsoft's extension which permits the client
&gt; to querey for DNS addresses.  In addition, when you specify the login
&gt; option to pppd, and if the secrets file exists, and if the client doesn't
&gt; have a secret in the secrets file, pppd would refuse access to the client.
&gt; I want to be able to have a secrets file for some clients, while also
&gt; allowing my users to authenticate themself with their password, so I also
&gt; modified pppd so that it permits a client to have no secret if the login
&gt; option is given.  For those who are interested, the patch is available at
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/ppp-2.2.0f-rebel.patch.">http://www.rebel.net.au/~davidn/ppp-2.2.0f-rebel.patch.</A>
&gt; 
&gt; As this is a new facility I have only told a small number of people about
&gt; it: staff plus three reliable subscribers.  It was installed August 2, has
&gt; been used successfully 10 times and has failed to permit a login three
&gt; times: once when I was testing; once for an unknown user; and once when
&gt; the password had expired.  It seems okay to me.
