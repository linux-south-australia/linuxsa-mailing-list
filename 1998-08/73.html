If you are interested in Linux (thats all of us)
and you are interested in developing software (thats most of us)

Then I can highly recommend getting -
- The latest GTK+ 1.0.5   (see <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</A>  for details)
- GLADE  builder             (see
<A HREF="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~damon/builder/index.html">http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~damon/builder/index.html</A> for details)

GTK+ is good enough now for any GUI development you want to do,
and GLADE offers a very nice VB-look-a-like screen painter and
application editor

Note that GLADE is only at 0.3 at the moment, but it is quite useable. 
If you have ever used VB / VC++ / Delphi under windows, and you like
IDE's, then I think that you will find that GLADE has come a long way
very quickly.

It is also quite easy to hack GLADE at this stage to make it do what you
want.

GLADE will output C code, include a configure script and Makefiles, etc
to build the application that you have drawn up, or will save in an
intermediate form that looks like SGML / HTML / XML. There are other
plug-ins being developed for GLADE that will allow it to output other
languages. Guile, C++, Python and Perl are all 90% there.

The intermediate form is nice because you can write other tools to
automatically generate applications in this markup form, and then invoke
GLADE on it to fiddle with the details.

Also worth getting is the Python-GTK interface. Python is a wierd
high-level language that is extremely simple to learn & use, but very
powerful and quick. Python is included with most RH installs (and
probably other distros as well). But you can get more details from
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</A>

Using Python + GTK you can create powerful GUI apps in no time at all.

All looks very promising. ...  I knew years 4 ago that Linux would make
it, but I never thought that it would get this slick.

have fun.
