&gt;Linux.

I thought I might offer some advice that, although not specific to your
configuration, might be of interest to some people.

If you are creating a Linux _server_ for more than a few users, be they
dial-in or LAN, this is the configuration that I have found works best
after many years of chopping and changing and experimenting. This is the
configuration I found worked best when we had only the one machine doing
all the work

Assumptions:

	* A fair bit of mail passes through this machine - it's probably the
central mail server for the site.

	* All users have at least _some_ crap in their home dirs, including the
system admin's

	* Logging is fairly important and as such logs are large and kept for
lengthy periods.

Configuration for a 4.3 Gig:

		/				100
		/home			750
		/home/u		1000
		/tmp			100
		/usr			600
		/usr/src		200
		/var/log		750
		/var/spool		500
		*swap*			64

/home/u is where all the user home directories go (/home/u/a /home/u/b
/home/u/c), which leaves /home free for ./ftp ./httpd ./squid and ./samba

/var/spool contains ./mail and ./news and /var/log will have heaps of space
to take all the ftp, httpd, squid and message logs.

Just a different approach to the 'how do I partition' debate!

Cheers

Alex!
