Hi Mike
Just got back to my desk
I see Geoff has pointed you to the nub of the problem.

a bit of investigation suggests a nest of problems which
could take you a while to uncover so I've made some
more specific comments which I hope will help

The short answer
- you have set your host to the wrong ip, should be 203.38.186.33,
  not 32 (according to domain authorities)
- your netmask is one of 255.255.255.224 or .240 or .248 or .252
- your netaddress is almost certainly 203.38.186.32
 (another reason why you must change your host address)
- your broadcast address can't be 203.38.186.40 possible options
  corresponding to the above netmasks are 203.38.186.63 or .47
  or .39 or .35 
- you need to change your local nameservers domain files to match
  the authoritative ml.org allocation of 203.38.186.33 for your host
- you need to set telstra's reverse lookup "in-addr.arpa" for
  203.38.186.33 to pineview.ml.org using their web form
- once all this is done & working plug the right numbers into
  the DHCPD conf file
- add the 255.255.255.255 host route & some of the trimmings I
  mentioned before if you want all windows boxes to dance 
- the joys of DHCP should be all yours

the long answer, explanations & my reasoning (and CAVEAT) are:

a net/subnet has a series of addresses
there used to be a minumum of 256 called a class C but now this can
be cut into bits.
these bits or classless nets must be 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128
addresses long.
all addresses on one of these nets are contiguous.
each net has:
 a net address - the first address in the range 
 a broadcast address - the last address in the range
 host addresses - any addresses in the middle
 a netmask - a way to describe how many host addresses are
 in the net

looking at the addresses in your DHCP config we know the
addresses aren't right.

an IP address is really a 32bit number which is best viewed as
binary bits

  203   .   38   .   186  . 32
11001011 00100110 10111010 00100000

All ip adresses are treated as two parts
the network number
and the host address

in nets like ours most bits are the network number (all at the top)
and a few bits at the bottom are addresses we can use for hosts etc.

the netmasks purpose is to define where the split occurs
it is always a string of ones followed by a string of zeros

a netmask of 255.255.255.192 
11111111 11111111 11111111 11000000
describes the split where the top 26 bits are the number of the
network the bottom 6 bits are numbers you can use for hosts. 
--- 64 except the smallest & largest numbers are reserved 
remember so you can use 62

a netmask of 255.255.255.224 
11111111 11111111 11111111 11100000
ie the top 27 bits are the number of the network
the bottom 5 bits are numbers you can use for hosts. 
--- 32 except ... so you can use 30

a netmask of 255.255.255.240 
11111111 11111111 11111111 11110000
ie the top 28 bits are the number of the network
the bottom 4 bits are numbers you can use for hosts. 
--- 16 except ... so you can use 14

a netmask of 255.255.255.248 
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
ie the top 28 bits are the number of the network
the bottom 4 bits are numbers you can use for hosts. 
--- 8 except ... so you can use 6


the network address is allocated to you and is of course
all zeros at the bottom.
if you have been given a netmask of 255.255.255.192 or
255.255.255.64 or 255.255.255.0 (the whole class C) 
you could have a host 203.38.186.32 but if its anything
greater than 192 you can't because .32 is all zeros in the host
part, all zeroes has to be the smallest address in the range.
This all zeros host is the special reserved number to describe
the network. Using it for a host will confuse the hell out of
networking software (like DHCP). 

I have concluded you have 5 bits or less of network space
by looking at other people on the net around your addresses.
a quick check shows there are several domains squashed below yours
in the same class C IP space!
viz: 
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38.186.1
&gt; Server:  localhost
&gt; Address:  127.0.0.1
&gt;
&gt; Name:    ilc.gov.au
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.1

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38.186.17
&gt; Server:  localhost
&gt; Address:  127.0.0.1
&gt;
&gt; Name:    bronkowitz.keghouse.net
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.17

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38.186.25
&gt; Server:  localhost
&gt; Address:  127.0.0.1
&gt;
&gt; Name:    patricias.norks.net
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.25

there are also hosts/domains not far above your server. viz:

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38.186.65
&gt; Server:  localhost
&gt; Address:  127.0.0.1
&gt;
&gt; Name:    konectanet-gw.konectanet.com.au
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.65

so unless you are hosting multiple domains and hosts &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=the CAVEAT
(in which case my assumptions fall apart!)
I have you sandwiched between 32 & 63 a max of 32 addresses (5 bits)
  203   .   38   .   186  . 32
11001011 00100110 10111010 00100000
to 
  203   .   38   .   186  . 63
11001011 00100110 10111010 00111111

...32 is reserved to indicate for the network address.
...63 is reserved for the broadcast address.

if you have less than 5 bits in your net (a distinct possibility)
the tighter mask and broadcast addresses would apply!!

I think therefore it is highly likely 203.38.186.32 is the
first address in your range which must be reserved! 

so RENUMBER YOUR HOST to 203.38.186.33

Also a broadcast address can never be 203.38.186.40
in binary this is 11001011 00100110 10111010 0101000
a broadcast address must be the last number in the net
therefore all 1's in the "host" part
I suspect it is 
  203   .   38   .   186  . 63
11001011 00100110 10111010 00111111

again if you have less bits in your net 
the tighter mask and broadcast addresses would apply!!


Supporting my view that you have used the net address for the server
I see from nslookup and dnsquery's that your machines IP's are
confused in the domain name system as well!!!

according to the domain authorities your host it is supposed to be
.33 not .32  -  This is a CRITICAL problem

The "world" thinks pineview.ml.org & themaster.pineview.ml.org
are the one machine with an IP of 203.38.186.33 viz:

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup pineview.ml.org
&gt; Server:  localhost
&gt; Address:  127.0.0.1
&gt; 
&gt; Non-authoritative answer:
&gt; Name:    pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.33

&:

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup pineview.ml.org d.ns.ml.org
&gt; Server:  ns.brainstorm.fr
&gt; Address:  193.56.58.253
&gt; 
&gt; Name:    pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.33

&:

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup themaster.pineview.ml.org
&gt; Server:  localhost
&gt; Address:  127.0.0.1
&gt; 
&gt; Non-authoritative answer:
&gt; Name:    pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.33
&gt; Aliases:  themaster.pineview.ml.org
&gt; 

The world however can't find a machine at this address

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ ping 203.38.186.33
&gt; PING 203.38.186.33 (203.38.186.33): 56 data bytes
&gt; ò
&gt; --- 203.38.186.33 ping statistics ---
&gt; 5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$

nor can it find a reverse lookup

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38 186.33
&gt; ò

there is however a machine on 203.38 186.32

viz:
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ ping 203.38.186.32
&gt; PING 203.38.186.32 (203.38.186.32): 56 data bytes
&gt; 64 bytes from 203.38.186.32: icmp_seq=0 ttl=124 time=191.7 ms
&gt; 64 bytes from 203.38.186.32: icmp_seq=1 ttl=124 time=192.7 ms
&gt; ò
&gt; --- 203.38.186.32 ping statistics ---
&gt; 2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
&gt; round-trip min/avg/max = 191.7/192.2/192.7 ms

This thinks it is called pineview.ml.org & themaster.pineview.ml.org

viz:

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup pineview.ml.org 203.38.186.32
&gt; Server:  themaster.pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.32
&gt; 
&gt; Name:    themaster.pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.32
&gt; Aliases:  pineview.ml.org

The world doesn't have a reverse lookup for it
viz

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38 186.32
&gt; ò

but it has one for itself!

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@grissom">adrian@grissom</A> adrian]$ nslookup 203.38.186.32 203.38.186.32
&gt; Server:  themaster.pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.32
&gt;
&gt; Name:    themaster.pineview.ml.org
&gt; Address:  203.38.186.32


Hope all this helps!

Adrian
