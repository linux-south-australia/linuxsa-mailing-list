Hi everyone,

I was contacted the other day by a printing company that makes those
little badges that go on the front of PCs, trying to drum up some
business,
and this started me thinking about printing up a Linux badge. Something
along the lines of the Linux Penguin sitting on the word "Linux" also
possibly having the words "Powered by" floating above.

I have done a bit of inquiring and they should come in at about $2 each
assuming we order a reasonable quantity. So what I am wondering is, is
there enough interest in something like this to make the order viable?

Of course I would make the final picture available on the web in advance
so that we end up with a design that pleases all (or at least the
greater %).

I would like to know if people think this is a good idea. At $2 each
everyone should be able to buy plenty for themselves, friend, family.
Think of them as the perfect birthday/wedding/fathers-mothers day...
present. :) Be the envy of work mates, make a powerful statement!

Anyway enough of the hype, now let the flame wars begin. :)
