Guys,
	I have been playing with the linux badge design, while I am no expert
graphics designer I like most of us can tell what looks good and what doesn't.

	The original badge design looks good but some people have made comment
about the penguin sitting on a reverse "L", perhaps a normal "L" would be
more appropriate.
	I have spent considerable time playing with the design, namely reversing
the "L" and come to the conclusion that a reverse "L" is best.

	My reasoning for this is as follows;

A reverse "L" means "Linux" horizontal on the bottom in the prime position
with the "Powered" vertically up the side.

A normal "L" means "Linux" is vertical on the side while the "Powered" bit
goes across the bottom.

It is for this reason I think the Reverse "L" is best, I would much prefer
the word Linux to be most prominent.

There is also an issue of the image, I have built a high resolution image
with nice shades and so forth but looking at the badge on my own machine I
noticed that its design has only two colours, Question to Nick Stock here
can the people who are going to print this make a photographic image or are
we limited to two or three colours non photographic type?

We might have to stop and re think the design.

I have knocked up a WEB page with all of the designs I have come up with, I
intended to put the URL here but I cannot ftp into my WEB Site at the
moment, as soon as I get the jigger to work I will let you know, hopefully
real soon.

Kind Regards
	Paul
