Heyas
I just bought myself an i740-based agp video card.
For those of you who are interested, it supports opengl and direct3d, works
in a window or fullscreen, and has 8Mb of ram onboard. Running timedemo
demo1 in quake, at 640x480 in 16bit, i got the following results:
no acceleration: 26 fps
3Dfx voodoo   35 fps
i740        46 fps

Running Forsaken, I was getting around 40-60 fps, depending on amount of
objects, explosions, lasers, etc. on screen. The image quality is noticeably
better than my 4Mb voodoo card, probably because of the larger amount of
texture memory. (Most textures stored in system ram, and accessed thru agp
port. Thus, large textures dont need to be swapped in and out, or shrunk
down in size.)

Only question is, of course, is linux support. The i740 is a 2d and a 3d
card, so it replaces my ET6000.
I don't suppose anyone has seen an X-server that supports the i740? Or a
MESA lib that support it?
Running this card under X would be ideal for an opengl project I am working
on at the moment. I switched to developing under win98 recently, since there
I could use the lame MS opengl stuff to run in a window until I got a card
that supported windowed opengl. (this one does. the voodoo had to switch to
full screen.) Plus of course, the old 'but everyone who is gonna use this is
gonna be running win98'.
But if I can release dual for windoze and linux/unix/X at the same time, I
would choose that option. OpenGL, unlike directx, is at least very portable
between platforms.

Anyway, I'm off to browse to try and find X support for this card. How hard
is it to write your own mesa driver, anyway? I mean, if you can get the
source code for the 3dfx one, it wouldn't be too hard to make it use the
i740 functions instead, I think.
