I've set up dumb terminals (eg 286's with telix) over null-modem cables,
and modems, before. The main problem I had was just making sure
everything was talking to each other at the right speeds, etc.
Have you tried loading minicom on the linux machine, and telix/minicom on
the dumb terminal, and tried typing stuff and seeing if it turns up at the
other end?

If your inittab is correct, have you checked to see what it is doing with
syslogd, etc? I havent used the xmodem config util, and my modem is
external, so I'm not sure there. 

Depending on how new the PC that is acting as a dumb terminal is, you may
or may not have FIFO buffers on the uarts. Internal modems usually come
with a decent one, but I found my 286s could not cope with very fast
serial speeds at all. I had to run them at 19200 in the end, or else you
dropped characters every now and then. Still, that was far and away
enough for most applications. (eg. IRC, remote debugging.)

Make sure you dont have gpm or other mouse apps loading, since they will
be trying to use the same serial ports. Check /etc/rc.d/rc.&lt;yourrunlevel&gt;
for them. Since I sometimes wanted to have a mouse, and sometimes run
remote terminals, I set up a runlevel with no mouse drivers, and inittab
loading for remote axs, and another runlevel with no remote axs, and mouse
drivers. a quick telinit can switch between them.


good luck,
Toby


...Careful with that axe, Eugene!

&gt; Nah, that's not what I meant :)
&gt; The terminal and the modem are both connected to my linux box.  The
&gt; terminal has nothing in it except video and io cards, and a floppy.
&gt; the terminal is connected to the linux boss via serial null modem, which
&gt; was wired correctly, and tested. 
&gt; 
&gt; I need to know where these things are defined (inittab & gettydefs are ok)
&gt; Why wouldn't my modem work? - I forgot to mention it's plug & panic
&gt; I've set up nastier modems before with rh4.2, now i get 5.0 and a 'decent'
&gt; modem and it doesn't respond to even ATA or ATDT?!?! 
&gt; 
&gt; I Asked: 
&gt; &gt;&gt; i'm trying to set up a modem and a vt100/38400bps dumb term (486running
&gt; &gt;&gt; telix) and a usr 33.6 internal sportster modem.  the terminal keeps
&gt; &gt;&gt; bringing up a modem string (ATQ0...) and the modem don't work at
&gt; &gt;&gt; all.this is strange, cause the modem did work ok before, and does in
&gt; &gt;&gt; windows also.   i think i'm missing some config files somewhere, i'm
&gt; &gt;&gt; using the xmodem config in rh5.0  - setserial returns correct values
&gt; &gt;&gt; re:irq/port etc.

&gt; &gt; FWIW I use Telix and send my modem absolutely nothing. I took it out of
&gt; &gt; the box and it worked.  (Amazing scenes). I'd use Telix to return it to
&gt; &gt; factory settings, kill the modem ini string and see what happens. If
&gt; &gt; it's already broken you can't break it.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have had the darn modem working working on an XT with a 360K floppy
&gt; &gt; simply using a VT100 terminal emulation. You have to key ATDT... to dial
&gt; &gt; up, but it works.
