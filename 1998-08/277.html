&gt; 
&gt; I think its a great idea...
&gt; 
&gt; However, I wondered if a "Penguin" sticker of some type would be more 
&gt; cosistant with other "rival" products. Those who buy Compaq, IBM or
&gt; even
&gt; Sun and DIGITAL rather than clones haven't got the "little square" to
&gt; place
&gt; a badge. Whereas  a sticker with "Penguin Power" or something might
&gt; appeal
&gt; to a larger audiance?
&gt; 
&gt; Just a sugestion..... :-)
&gt; 
This is a fair point. The computer I am typing on at the moment
does not have the little square spot to put the badge.

My feeling on the subject of "is a PC badge the best option?"
is that it is probably the most professional looking choice.
Any other sort of extra "sticker" style of badge would look a
little like an amateur afterthought instead of a proud statement
of defiance (against the MS dominance of the PC industry)!

Coming from a reseller point of view (as a Linux provider)
it would be the perfect sort of thing to have going out on
Linux PCs or used as a promotional item. It would really
have that feel of professionalism ("they believe in their
product enough to have gone to the trouble") to have a
Linux PC badge.

I think that although most cases do have a spot for a badge,
the ones that don't should still look alright if it is carefully
placed in on of the top corners.

But this is just my two cents.
