Hey All,

I've been given the task of setting up a mySql server, on an Acer EISA
server, which has an Adaptec 1740 EISA SCSI card in it. 

When the machine boots up, it shows: (note, '&gt;' denotes screen output)

&gt;Adaptec AHA-1740 BIOS v1.40
&gt;Copyright 1992 Adaptec, Inc.
&gt;[Enhanced Mode]
&gt;
&gt;Target 0 - SEAGATE ST11200N - Drive C: (80h)
&gt;Target 4 - NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:841

When the linux kernel boots, it comes up with:

&gt;scsi : 0 hosts.
&gt;scsi : detected total.

Sometimes, when it does an autoprobe, it dies and says:

&gt;Kernel panic: aha1740.c: Irq from unknown host!
&gt;In interupt handler - not syncing

and other times it just comes up with a message saying it can't find it
in my system and goes back to the screen where I can try to select the
scsi card again. Once the cdrom light has flashed, but that time it said
it couldn't find the device in my system.

I have tried running the default installation and also the 'expert'
installation, doesn't make any difference. Actually, I just tried doing
some more stuff on it. It gives the kernel panic when in expert mode,
and just the error message when not in expert more.

I know all the termination and everything is set, as I had to fix it
myself, it wasn't right when I got the system. It was not finding the
CDROM and stuff like that until I set the termination properly. Now the
BIOS finds all the drives 100% of the time.

More info about the computer is:

Acer EISA 486/50 (1 CPU installed)
64Mb RAM
1Gb SCSI HDD 
SCSI CDROM
Netgear EA201 (Ne2K compat.) NIC
not a lot else

The hard drive already has DOS and Windows 3.1, which work fine (and
damn fast I must say! Faster than I remember anyways, although that
could be because I'm used to Windows 9X being so damn slow...)

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated, as this project is for a church
camp.

TIA
Dazz
