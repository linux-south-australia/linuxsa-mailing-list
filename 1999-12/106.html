I found that setting this card as a Sound Blaster compatible worked ok.

Hope this helps

&gt; Hi has anyone else had luck configuring a CM18330/C3D AudioAdapter card for
&gt; Linux.
&gt; I ran the /usr/sbin/sndconfig tool, which probed and found my (onboard?)
&gt; card, but when It tried the wav sound for a test it came back with the
&gt; following error:
&gt; 
&gt; "    sh: insmod: command not found
&gt;      sound: No such file or directory     "
&gt; 
&gt; the 1st thing I did after this was restore the backups of the
&gt; /etc/conf.modules and /etc/isapnp.conf files.
&gt; I did notice that the I/O port that the probe detected seemed diferent from
&gt; what Windows reports ie 530 rather than 534 (who should I believe?).
&gt; Aside: how do I (or can I) find out the IRQ and DMA settings for my card?
&gt; 
&gt; I am running the redhat 6.0. Is this already set up for modularised support
&gt; or do I have to recompile the kernel ?(I haven't got around to that yet). I
&gt; also found some red-hat documentation for setting up sound for this card but
&gt; I don't know enough (yet) to understand this well enough to confidently play
&gt; around without stuffing up all of the plug-n-play devices.
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone point me in the right direction?
&gt; 
&gt; Nic B         %-)
&gt; 
&gt; p.s. sorry if there have been too many queries from me, but I am just trying
&gt; to get it all set up. Thanks for all the help so far Linux-SA
