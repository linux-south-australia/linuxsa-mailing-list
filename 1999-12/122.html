&gt; genuinely interested in an alternative to the crud they are using at
&gt; the moment. If you must exchange information, you should be doing it

aww come ON!

be real! I know of a large number of IT professionals in Adelaide who do
*not* frequent this list, and instead are as biased againt Linux as alot
are against MS. In fact, I think the comment I was told was, "Geez, it
slow - must be running on a Linux box"

Now, I'm not sure how serious this was, but it shows that there are
people on the other side of the fence, and they aren't looking this way.

So I think - Grow up. Realise that linux is not the all mighty industry
standard yet, and play nice with others.
