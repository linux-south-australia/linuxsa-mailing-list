My 5c worth ( I have advanced in money reference terms to current fiscal
policy which states that the lowest common denominator is 5c not 2c).


&gt; I would say that NT has in no way reduced the need for sys admins.

This is not what was said at all, what was said is that it is killing the
job, ie making it seem worse because there is now people who shouldn't be
doing the job doing it, ie people who have just "played" and think they know
enough. I did an NT server course and still have shed loads to learn about
NT.

&gt;
&gt; Example
&gt; So while it may be relatively easy to enable IP forwarding(just tick a
&gt; checkbox no kernel recompile) you still have to understand the concept of
&gt; IP forwarding and still have to understand the implication(which may be
&gt; subtle).

Kernel recompile, I am sure that there is something in /proc that you can
cat 1 into to turn on ip forwarding, in fact it has been mentioned on this
very list. (Maybe /proc/ip_forward or similar)

&gt;
&gt; What NT may have done is introduced a need for more system admins with
&gt; NT/Windows experience and perhaps more SYs Admins overall as all the
&gt; businesses who buy NT thinking they can now have aserver of whatever sort
&gt; without an admin, realise the folly of their decision.

I think this was already said anyway.

&gt;
&gt; &lt;/2 cents&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; JT
