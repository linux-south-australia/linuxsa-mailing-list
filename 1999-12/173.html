&gt; I have a colour laser printer attached to my machine. When printing out
&gt; large postscript jobs the machine seems to time-out. It will print these out
&gt; if logged in as root or to other printers. It will also print smaller jobs
&gt; to the colour laser printer.

It seems odd that printing the job as root works.  This suggests
that you are running out of disk in the /var/spool/lpd partition
(root can use more disk than your average user).


Printing works as follows:

 - lpr sends the job to lpd

 - lpd puts the job into /var/spool/lpd/lp/

The file then sits there.

Later on lpd

 - scans the spool directory for unprinted jobs,

 - grabs the oldest,

 - sends it to the printer via some filters.

These filters do accounting and format transformation.

Is the laser printer PostScript -- that is, do you need to run
a GhostScript as a filter to turn the job from PostScript into
some raster-oriented printer control language?  If so, you might
be running out of resources at this step.  However, it shouldn't
matter if you are root or not -- you would expect the filter to
be run by the owner of lpd.

You can test this by converting the job manually and setting up
a second print queue, say lp0, defined as text only (that is,
send the job straight through, don't filter it).
