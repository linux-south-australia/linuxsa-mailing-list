 &gt; BSD is for me. Any offers of advice on this?

BSD doesn't have a journaled filesystem (which Matt has spoken about
separately) -- it has something which is a bit like a cross between an
async mount (which goes spectacularly fast) and a journaled filesystem
(which is spectacularly stable), namely Kirk McKusick's SoftUpdates
facility.

SoftUpdates are enabled by building them into your kernel and setting
a mount option on an existing filesystem (i.e.: you enable them on a 
mount-by-mount basis:  using them doesn't make your filesystem incompatible
with non-SoftUpdates).

When you have SoftUpdates enabled, the buffer cache is used much more
aggressively, much like in an async mount (where filesystem metadata
is written to the cache instead of direct to disk -- Traditional 
UNIX filesystems treat metadata like directories and inodes as special
cases and write them through to disk, which is one reason why creating
and deleting thousands of directories takes much longer than creating
and deleting thousands of files).

The difference between SoftUpdates and an async mount lies in the way
the cache is flushed to disk:  In an async mount, the cache flushes are
effectively random, leading to the case where the physical disk might 
have inconsistencies (like the ones which hosed your filesystems this
week).  With SoftUpdates enabled, the cache flushes are sorted and 
clustered according to a dependency tree which makes sure that the 
physical disk is always in a self-consistent state.

For example, if you modify a file by appending to it, the modified
version of the file's inode will be flushed to disk at the same time
as the data you've appended, instead of what happens with an async mount,
which is that the data might be flushed, and the inode might potentially
be flushed many minutes later.

This isn't as good as a true journaled filesystem, because there are 
still race conditions where failures can occur, but it reduces those
race conditions to windows lasting a few milliseconds instead of a few
minutes, while permitting most of the performance benefits of an async
mount to shine through.

That being said, I've been using async mounts on my home server for
years now and have never lost a file -- different strokes for different
folks.  Keep good backups and enjoy the speed :-)
