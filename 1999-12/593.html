Since my initial posting I have purchased Partition Magic, but this has
not worked out so well. 

The instructions seemed incomplete and dominated by references to
Windows. I am not sure if PMagic is really worthy yet for consideration
by the wider PC community. 

The process requires the creation of a boot disk and run (PMagic) disk.
These are copied from files on the CD. One file seemed to be missing
(PQPB.RTC). Once located and added to disk 2 I was able to get to the
default screen. This screen would show no partitions only #error. I
delved back into Linux and found the following. PMagic probably refuses
to show anything because of the problem of cylinder boundaries. This may
also apply to my Linux drive, see below.  


Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 524 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1   *         1       514   4124704+   b  Win95 FAT32
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(513, 128, 63) should be (513, 254, 63)
/dev/hda2           515       524     80325    5  Extended
/dev/hda5           515       524     80293+  82  Linux swap

Command (m for help): 


My Linux disk reports the following

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 4177.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)


This drive also showed problems with cylinder boundaries-- 


Disk /dev/hdb: 32 heads, 63 sectors, 4177 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2016 * 512 bytes

   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hdb1             1       478    481446   83  Linux
Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(1018, 14, 63) should be (1018, 31, 63)
/dev/hdb2           478      4178   3729442+   5  Extended
Partition 2 does not end on cylinder boundary:
     phys=(1023, 14, 63) should be (1023, 31, 63)
/dev/hdb5           478      1800   1331946   83  Linux
/dev/hdb6          1800      3121   1331946   83  Linux
/dev/hdb7          3121      4178   1065456   83  Linux



My first Linux installation was RH 5.2 and partitions were set up by
Disk Druid. Did it do something wrong?
