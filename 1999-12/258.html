Ah, that's different :-)

Get a second SMTP server for dial-on-demand mail.  Configure it so that
it only runs its queue every 24 hours (use "sendmail -bd -q24h" at
boot-time)

For each domain served by dial-on-demand, set up its MX records like this:

     domain.com.au.		IN	MX	10 mail.domain.com.au.
				IN	MX	50 mail-dod.isp.net.au.

(i.e.: the highest priority MX is the customer's own mail server, but
if that's unreachable (because they aren't logged in) use your 
dial-on-demand SMTP server).

When customers login, they need to send "ETRN domain.com.au" to
the SMTP port on mail-dod.isp.net.au.  That will cause its SMTP 
server to start attempting to deliver any mail destined for
<A HREF="mailto:username@domain.com.au">username@domain.com.au</A>, leaving any mail which doesn't match that
description alone.

Why do you need a second SMTP server?  Because DoD mail may sit in 
the queue for many days in an undeliverable state.  It takes roughly 
60 seconds for a mail server to work out that a DoD customer is 
unreachable ('cos they're not logged in).

Let's say you have 2000 messages in your queue waiting for DoD delivery.
Each one takes 60 seconds to time-out when your mail server tries to send
them, that means a queue run takes 2000 minutes...

... which is a shame if you're running the queue every 30 or 60 minutes
(which is the normal way of doing it):  You'll end up creating a situation
where the load on the machine gradually increases, never catching up with
the work it's supposed to be doing, until you reboot it.

So, use a second machine.  Run the queue on it less often (it still needs
to run so that old messages will bounce, but it doesn't need to run
every 30 minutes like the way it usually does).
