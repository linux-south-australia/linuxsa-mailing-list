sorry for coming on that strongly. ISAPNP has been a
bugbear for Linux, most of the documentation reflects that fact and more or
less insists you a) don't use pnp aware os, and b) dont use pnp if at all
possible. These howtos are (now) severely out of date

times change. (rapidly with the penguin). I use the word must,
because I believe it is now the best option. I use the word to forestall
a long discussion of if's and maybes. In any mailer, can you imagine pointing
out all the options that you and i both know when really, what we're trying to
achieve is a quick answer to fix a problem? If the pnpdump procedure is followed
correctly by the new comer, then that entire issue is a non-issue for any
subsequent installs they may do. (in much the same way your answer to disable
all pnp would be, if they could)

For my money, we don't say disable PCI (auto configuration) so isa should also
now be dragged kicking and screaming into the next century as well because it's
the 'better' long term solution. Linux systems (generalisation) run better on
older equipment because the drivers are out there. This means ISA cards are
going to be around awhile.

Your mileage and experience can obviously differ to mine. I respect that.
