ouch! I always thought that an exchange of ideas and opinions helped
people in this world learn and expand. Even if those ideas are flawed,
the resulting discussion is nearly always beneficial. Blatant flaming is
not.

&gt; Grow up.
&gt; 
&gt; You're in danger of making yourself look like an idiot.
&gt; 
&gt; You said yourself:
&gt; " One of the great things about a
&gt;  free product that is superior to its commercial alternative, is that
&gt;  you don't have to market the fact. It suceeds automatically. "
&gt; 
&gt; so whats the point of your message?
&gt; 
&gt; Lets turn this around. You've just descovered that you can breath under
&gt; water. You dont need air at all. Whats more, you've found that living
&gt; under water is so much better. In fact, its so much better, you switch
&gt; to living under water permenantly. No tell me, are you going to ignore
&gt; the ability to breath air? No!  Because there are still 4 billion people
&gt; who still breath air.
&gt; 
&gt; My point is, sprouting shit off is not productive.
&gt; 
&gt; this comment:
&gt; 
&gt; " Now this community,
&gt;  in the spirit of free software, makes available its collective
&gt;  knowledge to anyone who cares to use it, "
&gt; 
&gt; and this one:
&gt; 
&gt; " I'm just presenting an alternative viewpoint in which
&gt;  linux users may answer that question with "Who cares!" "
&gt; 
&gt; are diametrically opposite.
