Hi all.

I currently fetch all my mail from my ISP using fetchmail.  My local
mailer is Sendmail.  My ISP was nice enough to give me a multi-post
mailbox, so all email to my subdomain ends up in one mailbox.

When I download the mail, the mail system decides (based on the
To: field in the email) where to route the mail locally.  The
problem with this is that any mail to a list address (such as
LinuxSA) or any BCC'd mail does not have a valid To: field that
maps to a user on my system.

When I receive these messages, they end up in the mailbox of
the user calling fetchmail (mailuser), and not the mailbox of 
the user they were indended.

I have asked this question before, but did not receive the
answer that I was looking for.  Is thers any way of configuring
the mail system to use the envelope headers to deduce where the
mail was originally intended to end up, rather than simply
looking at the to field?

My ISP recommended a program called MDaemon for Winblows, but
I really would prefer (please, no, don't make me take that
route) not to use Winblows software for routing mail.

Cheers

Adam
