This is a forwarded message my mate wrote to Andrew about the back
channel charges.  I thought it would be best to forward it to the list 
for others interest. 


&gt;Hi Guys,
&gt;    As the owner of a Telstra Big Pond Permanent Connection,
&gt;I have been reading this discussion with interest, but I
&gt;think I should clear up a few discrepancies and half truths
&gt;that I have seen bandied around. O.K. here goes :

Methinks you should read the Telstra pages a little more carefully
because you have made one big mistake that could cost you dearly.

&gt;$20 Telstra Connection - this INCLUDES first 100Mb data
&gt;(approx), and then charged at 19c/Mb.

Correct.

&gt;This is modified if my
&gt;Download:Upload ratio is better than 1:2.75, ie for each 1
&gt;Mb I Download, I Upload 2.75 Mb, in which case the data
&gt;charge drops to 9c/Mb.

NO!

&gt; In English, if I Upload 550 Mb, then
&gt;I get 200 Mb for my $20 per month. It still costs me $20,

NO!

This 2.75 ratio is what telstra calls "back channel" charges - It was put in
place about a year ago to prevent people with Satellite links from using the
Satelite to recieve all data, and Telstra's
19c/meg plan for outgoing -   In other words these people are/were getting a
a fulltime telstra connect for outgoing data (not chargable) even though
they were recieving virtually no data from them at all - Thus giving them a
very cheap connect.

How it works is as long as your OUTGOING data doesn't exceed your INCOMING
data by 2.75 then you only pay for the incoming data. However, if your
outgoing data exceeds this 2.75 ratio then you PAY telstra 9c/meg
for all outgoing data in excess of this.

If we use your example above and you SEND 550meg (ie, serving up WWW
pages) and you RECIEVE 100meg, your bill for the month will be:

$20 for the 100meg recieved - then because 500meg is over the 2.75
ratio (by 225meg) you'd be paying an additional $42.75 on top
(225x$0.19) = So rather than getting 200meg for your $20 - you'll be
getting the same 100meg but paying almost 3 times as much as you'd be
expecting.

In short, what this means is if you plan on doing WWW hosting you'll
need to take careful note of what is going in and out - We got caught
one month by putting streaming video on one of our web pages. This
boosted our outgoing data tremendously - we greatly exceeded the 2.75
ratio, and our monthly bill which usually runs at about $100-$150 per
month went up to nearly $400 &lt;ouch&gt; 

Needless to say we took the streaming video offline - those
backchannel charges can be a real trap!  (We still use live cams, but
we don't stream them - they now get updated every 10mins or so
instead.

Cheers
Rod
