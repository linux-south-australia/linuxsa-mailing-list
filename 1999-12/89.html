Matt,

Many thanks for that reply.

&gt; Once you get through the teething problems, I am sure that you won't
&gt; be regretting it.  I know I certianly haven't. 

In fact, linux on the laptop is in most respects very positive.
In particular, I've got OpenSSH going now, and for the traveller
wanting to access their home machine securely, the is superb.
I think that the legacy MS OSs can also run SSH clients, but it's
still good to know that linux has this and most other functionalities
for the laptop.

&gt; Are you keeping the file in Powerpoint format?  If you are then what
&gt; you may be doing is doing a PPT -&gt; SO -&gt; PPT conversion each time.
&gt; In this process there may be 'quirks' in either format that means
&gt; that they cannot be displayed exactly.

&gt; On thing to try is going the 'whole' SO way, and then only converting
&gt; on demand.  Also have a look at the export filters, since if you can
&gt; export as PDF that is a better format for data interchange.

I tried precisely that.
It failed even _more_ miserably when I saved in SO all the time,
but then exported to a "normal" MS ppt 97 user.

Now I've tried also to do HTML export as you suggest.
That works fine.

So my conclusions are:
-	SO cannot save correct PPT 97 format files.
-	SO _can_ save slides quite nicely in HTML, especially with frames.
-	SO can do everything (so far) correctly in its native slide format.
-	SO _cannot_ be used in the most important way, which is
	for import/export with MS users.
-	SO apparently has no PDF export format, but even if there was,
	other users wouldn't be able to incorporate my slides anyway.

If I don't want to be able to exchange slides with other people
(approx 99% legacy MS users), then I mgiht as well use any old thing.
In fact, since HTML can be seen live over a network, creating
and maintaining slides in HTML format makes the best sense,
which is what very many LinuxSA presenters have done.

But then I can't just hand on my HTML slides to MS people to
incorporate into their slide sets, unless they have the same
editing tools as me. Generally, "authored" HTML slide sets have
hints in them to help in their import into the authoring tool.

Ultimately, the only way the non-monopoly operating systems
and office software suites can beat the monopoly is to
settle on industry standards. That's how ultimately IBM was
reduced a little. 10 years ago, IBM used to go along to
standards meetings to slow them down and thwart them in
any way possible. Now they can't do that anymore.
In the same way, MS tries to thwart any development of
standards, for the same reason as IBM.

Some people think that to beat the MS monopoly, what we need
is linux and other unixes. But that's not really true.
What we need is standards, standards, and more standards.
MS fears standards vastly more than linux.
The disparate nature of the linux world implies that MS has little
to worry about.
If the linux world started to hold significant
file format and protocol standards meetings (at the level of
seriousness of the internet protocols), then _that_ would
pose a threat to MS.

-------------------------------------------------------
Anyway, I'll stick to native SO slide format now, and just hope
that no MS users ask me for a copy!

Cheerio,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  When the SO source is published, I don't think it will matter
one tiny bit who "owns" the source.
If Sun incorporate the bug fixes, that is the important thing.
