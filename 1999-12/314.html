Esteemed LinuxSA persons:

My old Sparc SLC is on its last legs.
After running at my home since about 1992/93 for 24 hours a day,
the tube is now flickering badly, and the picture is distorted.
It's clear that it's shortly to breath its last breath.

Maybe it will still work on the net okay after the tube
(black/white) has blown. But it won't be the same.

Question:

Does anyone have an old SLC in good condition?
I'd be happy to take it off your hands for a modest consideration.

The linux connection here is the fact that I got a PC and
stuck linux on it a few years ago as a replacement for the
inevitable day when the old SLC goes to the place where all good
Unix boxes go.

Not everything on the old sparc station will run on a linux box though.
Most of the binaries will be of no use any more.

The thing I'll miss most on the old SLC is the Ludwig editor.
Certain boisterous persons think that the Ludwig editor is no good.
But I can write over 500 lines of code a day with it -- much faster
than with other text editors.

Currently I'm doing a port of linux, trying to finish it in time
before the old SLC expires. If the author of Ludwig approves,
and if I get the software well enough ported to linux, some of
you developers out there might like to give Ludwig a try, to see
if it might be suitable to release to the linux world.
I haven't been told if this is okay yet though.

I'll have to tend to the old SLC now.
I don't know if it's going to make it through the night....
It just shows that you should appreciate your computer while you can....
Try to settle your differences while there's still time....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. Please don't reply on-list to this drivel.
