Hi has anyone else had luck configuring a CM18330/C3D AudioAdapter card for
Linux.
I ran the /usr/sbin/sndconfig tool, which probed and found my (onboard?)
card, but when It tried the wav sound for a test it came back with the
following error:

"    sh: insmod: command not found
     sound: No such file or directory     "

the 1st thing I did after this was restore the backups of the
/etc/conf.modules and /etc/isapnp.conf files.
I did notice that the I/O port that the probe detected seemed diferent from
what Windows reports ie 530 rather than 534 (who should I believe?).
Aside: how do I (or can I) find out the IRQ and DMA settings for my card?

I am running the redhat 6.0. Is this already set up for modularised support
or do I have to recompile the kernel ?(I haven't got around to that yet). I
also found some red-hat documentation for setting up sound for this card but
I don't know enough (yet) to understand this well enough to confidently play
around without stuffing up all of the plug-n-play devices.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

p.s. sorry if there have been too many queries from me, but I am just trying
to get it all set up. Thanks for all the help so far Linux-SA
