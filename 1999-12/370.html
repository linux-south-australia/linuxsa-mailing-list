Rip off 'eh? Most ISP's I have looked at for Permanent connections charge at
least $500 for permanent modem connectivity, in fact Chariot charge $500 for
&lt;=33.6 and $1000 for 56K (the same for ISDN).

Option 1 of 19/c says Upto 64Kbps in the header of the table.

Subject: RE: ISP Recommendations


&gt; &gt; A bit of interesting thing about the permanent connection thingy. I was
&gt; &gt; talking to a Big Pond type of person who stated that the $500
&gt; &gt; connection and
&gt; &gt; $20/m for the modem dialup (now inlcuding 56K) also is the same for
ISDN.
&gt; &gt; According to him there was no extra charges for the ISDN. Not what the
web
&gt; &gt; pages say, but then no-one at Telstra actually seems to say what the web
&gt; &gt; pages have written on them anyway.
&gt;
&gt; For permanent connections, this is half true (the $20 a month bit). It's
&gt; actually $20 a month, MINIMUM! You're charged 19c per meg you download, no
&gt; matter where you download it from (internationally, within Australia, or
&gt; within Telstra's own network). They also offer a flat rate per month, so
you
&gt; can download as much as you want, but that costs $390 a month for modem,
or
&gt; $990 for 64k ISDN. They do not do flat rates for faster connections. The
&gt; 'initial' (setup) costs are a rip off too, $500 for a modem, I think it's
&gt; $1000 for ISDN, and probably more for faster connections too.
&gt;
&gt; This is a Linux list, so here's my Linux bit of the mail: Telstra do not
&gt; officially support Linux (or at least haven't in the past), but on their
web
&gt; site is scripts you can use to establish a ppp connection to them. All you
&gt; need to do is to add one line to /etc/ppp/options to make Linux maintain
the
&gt; connection (reconnect when it disconnects) :)
&gt;
&gt; If you're looking for a cheap permanent connection, I suggest to go either
&gt; with Big Pong Direct, or Optus' permanent connection service. As far as I
&gt; know, they're basically the only people with international connections, so
&gt; everyone else within Australia goes with them, so you'll pay higher than
&gt; Telstra or Optus rates. This is assuming you want 'unrestricted' access.
&gt; Telstra currently charge 19c/meg (min $20 a month) and I think Optus
charge
&gt; 18c/meg, but I'm not sure about Optus.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't mind having dynamic IPs or having some ports blocked (such as
&gt; 80, so you have to use their proxies), I think Eisa (www.eisa.com.au) used
&gt; to have good prices (they have/had dynamic IPs, don't know about blocking
&gt; ports). There are some others too, but their names escape my mind. BTW, if
&gt; you didn't know, if you have dynamic IPs or if ports are blocked it can be
a
&gt; lot harder to host domains (not impossibly, but not practical).
&gt;
&gt; I think Eisa used to be (I keep saying used to, because I haven't checked
in
&gt; ages) flat rate. Telstra offer flat rate modem ($390/month) and 64k ISDN
&gt; ($990/month) access, but not flat rates for higher speeds. This is a
shame,
&gt; because Eisa offer $400 a year for unlimited time, unlimited download to
&gt; dial-up users. I host a domain and I'm the only one that downloads (a
&gt; significant amount of) data, so we have to pay $0.19/meg because of the
&gt; domain.
&gt;
&gt; Also, as far as I know, Big Pond Direct (the people who do permanent
&gt; connections) only offer 33.6k modem access, not 56k :( I could easily be
&gt; wrong, and hope I am. :)
&gt;
&gt; By the way, if anyone knows of better priced permanent connections, that
&gt; gives me a static IP and allows me to host a domain (ie doesn't block any
&gt; ports), please e-mail me. Also, if anyone wants to talk about perm
&gt; connections, please include me, I find it all very interesting :)
&gt;
&gt; Hope this helps,
&gt; Andy
&gt;
&gt; PS. I hate having to pay per meg. Since Telstra was the only backbone in
Aus
&gt; in the past and they charged per meg, anyone offering perm connections did
&gt; the same. Optus now is a backbone as well, and they no doubt copied
Telstra,
&gt; because they can make more money this way. I remember seeing an ad on a
&gt; web-site that gives USA customers a permanent 128k ISDN connection for $50
a
&gt; month. That was a long time ago, and I didn't look at what conditions
there
&gt; were, but it sounds excellent. *sigh*
