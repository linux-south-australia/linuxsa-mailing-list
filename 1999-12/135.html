I installed Corel Linux over the weekend and would like to present the
results:

- Using the ISO image downloaded and burned onto CD, the CDROM is bootable
(nice feature)
- A few clicks to select all packages, type in the username, and come back
in an hour. Nice install.
- Selecting all of the packages, expect approximately 600MB of HD used.
- KDE under this Debian variant is very fast (P133,32MB,2GB SCSI 1542,4MB
Mystique)
- Did not attempt to detect my Sound Card (SB16 non PNP) but I didn't expect
it to
- Still trying to config modem. The KPPP setup looks really nice, but even
though my USR X2 Ext appears to "pass" the modem test, I can't get any
result codes back from any commands in the built-in term. (no minicom or
/dev/modem or MAKEDEV either)
- Haven't really tried to set up my DE-220 NIC yet (It didn't pick it up on
the install).
- STOffice 5.1 installed nicely from a Sun-provided CD
- Samba installed by script and has a nice gui front end
- Gui user manager
- Comes with Netscape 4.7

Aside from some config problems (but what OS doesn't have that), I haven't
seen it easier to get the OS onto the hard drive. One could hope that future
versions from Corel will include install scripts for sound card selection,
modem selection, NIC selection, etc, but the large and changing number of
peripherals out there means that at least for now, a little post-install
tweaking is still required.

One last curious thing: I installed it on two PCs: the clone TXP-4 listed
above, and a Digital "applicationDEC 400xP". Both installs froze during the
first attempt, but completed successfully the second time through.

I'd be interested in hearing from others who have had good (or bad)
experiences, as well as anyone who may have advice on the #$%^& modem
problem. I still have a scanner to install. The SA archive has info on that
if I remember.
