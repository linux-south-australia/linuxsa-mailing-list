&gt; &gt;you *must* run ISAPNP first before attempting this.

&gt; &gt;in case you didn't read above
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;you *must* run ISAPNP before even attempting to install an isa card of any
&gt; &gt;description. sound, nic, or otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; AFAIK, this is just not true! At least, the *must* part is not.
&gt; 
&gt; I *never* set adapters into Plug and Pray mode.  I have lots of old
&gt; adapters that do not know about PnP.
&gt; 
I agree with Richard - if the adapter is NOT a plug-n-pray  then isapnp
is pointless...
and...regardless of whether its plugnpray - modprobe ne io=0x300 will
still work for isa network cards & oss will still detect non-pnp
soundcards...and...most of my adapters (and there's 8 pc's on my network
at home) are antiques as are the numerous non-pnp soundcards!

I am sure there is probably a good reason for running isapnp but I
havent seen one yet that was applicable to the many &varied bits of
hardware I have in my boxes.

Although I own antiques ;) I did buy myself a hub for xmas & turfed all
the coax & t-pieces etc and upgraded another 486dx2/66 to a Pentium90
(only got 2 x 486dx2/66's left now - rest of boxes are now Pentium 75's
or 90;s ;))

On a different note - who has had a peek at what the millenium will do
to their no-y2k linux/unix boxes???? hmmm.????.. I couldnt resist so
rolled 'em all over yesterday arvo - today is the 2ndJanuary 2000 ;) One
windoze 98 box didnt cope - it locked up & after rebooting it decided it
was 19/05/2023 - it doesnt do anything important so it can stay 23 years
ahead of itself ;)

Phil
