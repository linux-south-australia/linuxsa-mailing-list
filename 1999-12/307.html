Richard,

Yup. I know about those links.
I put in about 5 links to the new page, which was 
created only about an hour ago.

The problem is that this was not time enough for
any of the search engines to grab a link to it --
in fact, this person was the first to access the page
apart from myself.

The person concerned, at pub56k-25-51.dialup.umn.edu,
had not accessed any other file before.
In fact, no one in the domain dialup.umn.edu has
made an access in the last 3 weeks or so.
About 10 days ago, someone in csom.umn.edu did
make an access.

Nope. Clearly this person did not get this link
from any other source than my http connection.

What worries me is that there are no umn.edu
links on that netmon.html page of mine.
this means that the packets were almost 
certainly intercepted en route.

I imagine that someone has worked out that people
who make http accesses to network security
monitoring software sites must be somehow useful
to them -- maybe as targets!!!


Of course, I know in theory that the net is insecure.
But to see it in action is a bit scary.
It's like hearing someone read out a paragraph of your diary
on the radio. You start to wonder what
else they've been reading too.

This makes me _extremely_ glad that I've got
OpenSSH installed for me overseas trips now.
Otherwise I'm sure that I'd come home to
a bunch of cleanly re-formatted disk drives!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

=======================================================
PS.  Just thought I'd mention an idea as a PS.
At the end of each LinuxSA meeting next year,
I reckon a panel of experts should be made to
stand/sit at the front and answer any questions
about linux that may be concerning anyone.
