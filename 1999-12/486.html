Am I the only person here who thinks that spending $20 on a brand new
PCI network card is well worth it? More reliable, less headaches,
simpler installation, configuration, etc, etc.

Admitedly I paid a bit extra to get some 3com 10/100 cards, but i've got
budget 10baseT cards in most of my other boxes, and I'm pretty sure the
cards were sub $20 each. It all works fine, boot from windows to linux n
back again on those machines and neither has problems with PCI devices
changing IRQs. (surprisingly)

&gt; &gt; I want to set up a small network & thought it would be a GOOD idea to have
&gt; &gt; cards with jumpers so I could be CERTAIN of the IRQ and address each card
&gt; &gt; was using.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, Messrs Westan advise:
&gt; &gt; "None of the PCI ethernet cards have jumpers on them. I think it's the same
&gt; &gt; for all brands of PCI ethernet cards. On most ISA ethernet cards, you can
&gt; &gt; run the SETUP driver disk to configure it to Plug 'n' Play or Jumperless
&gt; &gt; (legacy)."
&gt; 
&gt; This is probably an ugly hack:
&gt; 
&gt; Consider configuring each card from within your startup scripts.  Linux
&gt; ethernet card configuration tools, to modify the settings in the EEPROM,
&gt; are available from
&gt;  <A HREF="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/diag/diagnostic.html">http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/diag/diagnostic.html</A>
&gt; There are tools for reconfiguring ne2000 and 3c5x9 cards.
&gt; 
&gt; If the reconfiguration requires a reboot, the card will have the wrong
&gt; settings for the first boot.  Perhaps reboot if the network card module
&gt; does not load, after reconfiguring the card and creating a flag file (to
&gt; prevent reboot loops if it does not load for some other reason).
&gt; 
&gt; Experiment to determine if reconfiguration requires a reboot.
