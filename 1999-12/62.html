Perhaps this is the issue.  However, I thought that was more related to just
getting the system to acknowledge the existence.  My driver, IRQ and address
information is located in /etc/conf.modules and is used by the kernel to
configure eth0 and eth1.  But like anything else, I will try that this
evening and see if passing it during LILO boot makes a difference.

&gt; I have a Pentium box with RedHat 6.1 loaded with 2 ethernet cards.  Both

&gt; communicates on my external network just fine.  Eth1 can ping itself but
is
&gt; unable to ping anything on the internal network.  In ifconfig the tx and
rx
&gt; stats are 0 all the way across.  I can take eth1 up and down with ifup
&gt; (ifconfig).  I have changed eth1 cards with an identical card, I have
&gt; swapped cables and hubs with no success.  Any ideas??
&gt; 
&gt; eth0 is an Intel EtherExpress PCI 100 using eepro100.o for the driver.
&gt; RedHat used plug and play for IRQ and address.
&gt; eth1 is an Intel ISA EtherExpressPro10/10+ using the eepro.o driver.  I
used
&gt; the DOS IRQ and Address settings for this device.

Don't you have to pass some specific information to the kernel (at boot
time?) to get it to _use_ more than one NIC at a time? I remember
reading this somewhere, but I'm not sure if it's still relevant :)
