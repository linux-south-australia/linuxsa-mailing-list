&gt;Specifically, if you create a linux partition, or (I assume) a swapfile in
&gt;hda5 ie, first logical partition of an extended partition. Dos fdisk cannot
&gt;remove it. It is as simple as that. Any partition beyond 4 is by default an
&gt;extended-logical partition since only 4 physical partitons can ever exist
&gt;on a hard drive. 

ie, on an IDE drive you can have a maximum of 4 Primary partitions (which
GNU/Linux calls /dev/hdx1-4, if they are present), ONE of which can be (or
is it MUST be? - see below) an Extended partition.  By default, GNU/Linux
calls the Extended partition /dev/hdx5 even if there are no Primary
partitions present.
GNU/Linux also numbers logical partitions within the extended partition
from /dev/hdx6 onwards, without regard for the presence or absence of
Primary partitions.
Not sure whether it is a DOS. BIOS or IDE limitation, but my experience is
that the normal arrangement is for the second partion to default to
Extended, so you CAN have Primary, Extended, Primary, Primary, but NOT
Primary, Primary, Extended, Primary.
So far so good? 

So our discussion revolves around whether or not DOS fdisk can see into a
GNU/Linux Extended partition in order to remove a Logical partion inside it.
The answer to that question is NO, it can't. (We agree!)
However, I'm still sure DOS fdisk CAN remove the non-DOS Extended
partition, particularly if it does not have Logical partitions within.

All a bit problematic now I use Partition Magic to do all this stuff - MUCH
easier &lt;grin&gt;.

&gt;The limit in linux for useable partitions of all types
&gt;16-1 due to its node structure.

Wots this mean?

&gt;I dont imagine dos, or linux, fdisk are concerned whether you're prepared to
&gt;listen or otherwise &lt;grin&gt;

:-)  or perhaps :-(
