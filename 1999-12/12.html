&gt; Hi I tried to install Caldera Open LInux 2.2 on two computers without

&gt; not run Win95 any more.  I applied DOS fdisk /mbr, but unfortunately
&gt; no luck there because system said: "NO FIXED DISK PRESENT". DOS fdisk
&gt; on its own does not display anything. Involved Partition magic, which
&gt; replied: "Critical Error#114: Start of Logical vs. EPBR is not
&gt; correct". Otherwise I can access C drive and I can also run Linux
&gt; after booting through floppies. The second computer displayed L only
&gt; and went straight into reboot again for many times until I intervened.
&gt; With this one, DOS fdisk /mbr worked and I can go into Win98 again. If
&gt; I boot linux through floppies I notice that I have problems with X
&gt; server because of AGP Video Excel ag240 8MB video card which is not
&gt; supported but that is a third problem, which I hope to handle with
&gt; running XF86Setup. Could anyone assist me with first two problems to
&gt; start with? Thanks Frank

The no fixed disk present message means that there is no active
partition (the DOS MBR tries to boot the active partition on the first
disk). In any fdisk type programmy thing, just set the Bindows partition
active. This will allow you to boot Windows. If you can't (which
I gether is the case) and you know a little about the partition table,
you can use Norton's Diskedit to edit the partition manually.
THIS IS NOT ADVISED IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS. You can also
just write down the data in the partition table on paper (what's that?)
before changing it. If you are comfortable using the Text based
interface, try getting hold of a mini Linux distribution. CCLinux is
quite good, as is pocket Linux and Sunsites have a couple around (Sorry,
I lost all my bookmarks). booting off one of these disks should let you
fix up any configuration problems with LILO (see LILO-HOWTO). Caldera
doesn't show you the output of the lilo command, so it's not easy to
tell if it actually did it properly. Running it from a text window is
good to see why it isn't working (warnings, errors, etc)

I also had a similar problem when I had a machine that supported a
maximum of 2Gb disks (mid-pentium) and I tried booting off my 10Gb drive
(Linux was past the 2Gb point on the disk).

Anyway, I hope I helped in some way

Matt
