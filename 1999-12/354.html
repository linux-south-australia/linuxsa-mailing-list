The guy I mentioned is actually on the phones / E-Mail doing 1st level support. I
believe he also does some 2nd level.


&gt; be looking at soemone like connect or telstra direct.
&gt;

Telstra didn't have very good support (none in fact) when I called them 12 months
ago. I had to explain what Linux was before they put me through to someone that
could tell me they didn't support it.

Connect are very good for small businesses / schools. We've had no problems, and
if they change phone numbers (for example) they even send across a little fax
letting us know how to reconfigure our router. Even if we don't need it.

&gt;
&gt; Of course the network operations/sys admin staff of SENET and most
&gt; other ISPs know tons about linux, but they are not likely the people who
&gt; will be solving your day to day support issues.

I disagree. But does it really matter? PPP is a not platform specific for most of
the world, so you shouldn't need too much support from the ISP. You can find out
whatever you need to know from the Linux Community and request DNS entries and
things when you know what you are doing. I don't think ISPs really need to
"support" particular operating systems (with the exception of the majority of
their customers, who don't know where the any key is).
