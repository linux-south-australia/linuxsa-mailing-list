All,

I posted my original cry for help on this list, and I thought that I would return my findings. Yes I have the share mounted and firstly let me thank all who replied and a special thanks to Andrew Tridgell for sending me in the right direction.

BHP has an Australian domain called BHP_AU but my workgroup is BHPWHY a domain/workgroup for Whyalla. My smb.conf file had a setting for workgroup set for BHPWHY. 

Since the Samba team is doing new things with their NT Domain code it seems to take the domain from your current workgroup setting. However my account in the NT world is validated by the BHP_AU domain controller. 
Thus when trying to mount the share my username was passed and verified in the BHPWHY domain which I don't have an account in. 

After a few network capture sessions, I found the only difference between what NT was trying to do and linux was the domain it was passing.  Changing the workgroup parameter in the smb.conf from my workgroup to my domain fixed the problem.

There probably is another fix or another way to specify your domain when attempting to list or mount shares.  I'm also sure that the samba team will polish up the code and parameters necessary to make it more obvious. :)
There used to be an option in both smbclient and smbmount to supply the domain, however it looks missing in the current 2.0.6 version.

Hope this helps someone so that they don't have to suffer the same agony I did. :^)
