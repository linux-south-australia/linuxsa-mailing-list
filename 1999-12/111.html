&gt; I have to say that Powerpoint is not now, nor has it ever been, a feature
&gt; of Office.  At best it's a bug, at worst it's a cruel joke.  Give up on
&gt; it and use HTML instead.  HTML makes a perfectly fine slideshow, and the
&gt; chances are that everybody already has the software needed to view it.
&gt; And it works over the Internet.

I have written presenations in PowerPoint, Applix, StarOffice,
and at least half a dozen other packages.  PowerPoint is simply
the best package for a beginner to write an acceptable presenation.

If you don't like that, then write something better.

The StarOffice presentation program *looks* as good as PowerPoint,
but crashes far too often to be a serious contender.  MagicPoint
has a disaster of an input format.  Applix is simple and stable.
I'd recommend Applix at the moment.

Non-begineers could use SliTeX to generate a PDF file -- Acrobat
has a good slideshow mode, and XPDF does an OK job.  You should
add LZW compression support to GhostScript if you want to follow
this route.

If you are wedded to HTML, then Cascading Style Sheets and W3C's
`tidy' program are the way to go.  But as browsers only implement
the screen media type, you can't have slide notes.  And you still
have the browser ocuppying huge amounts of display real estate.
This is a major issue for serious presenations -- the browser
border can be a foot tall on a fourteen foot screen and you
can't remove the border when producing slides for larger screens.

See:

  <A HREF="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/~gturner/papers/calu1999-smb/">http://www.adelaide.edu.au/~gturner/papers/calu1999-smb/</A>

for Tridge's SMB presenation to Conference of Linux Users
in HTML/CSS format.  The URL won't work by the end of this
week (as I've moved employeers).

You also have to be conscious of browser versions.  CSS support
is patchy but improving and it's no shock at the moment to
have radically different displays from a 0.01 increment in
a browser version.

As you may have guessed, I take presentations seriously.
An unprofessional presenation (of which slides are only
a small part) is a sure way to stuff up making your case
or getting the sale.

I am happy to demo the various slide packages at a
future LinuxSA meeting.  I suggest we make it in a
few months time -- as I can then give an update on
the state of Internet censorship [the situation is
too unclear for an update to be profitable at the
moment.]

Regards,
Glen
