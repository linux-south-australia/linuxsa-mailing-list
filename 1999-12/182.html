&gt; Hi Kristian,
&gt; 
&gt; I have done this at two sites now and it works extreamly well.
&gt; However I did find it very tricky to setup the first one but all as
&gt; been working without problems for about 6 months now.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically on the RedHat box you will need to run the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 	sendmail				# to deliver local mail
&gt; and outgoing internet mail to your ISP
&gt; 	fetchmail				# to receive internet
&gt; mail from your ISP
&gt; 	diald					# to perform diald on
&gt; demand
&gt; 	openldap				# if you want to have a
&gt; local email address directory
&gt; 	apache or squid			# if you also want to run web
&gt; and ftp proxy to the Windows PC's
&gt; 
&gt; On the Windows PC's I use Microsoft Outlook Express 5, using IMAP to
&gt; connect to the Linux mailboxes rather than POP as this allows the mail
&gt; to remain on the server and also allows people to move from PC to PC
&gt; and still access their mail.  Outlook Express 5 also supports LDAP
&gt; which allows local addresses to be verified using openldap on the
&gt; Linux box.
&gt; 
&gt; The main difficultly in setting up the system is configuring sendmail
&gt; and fetchmail.  Diald can also be a bit of a pain to get working with
&gt; sendmail and fetchmail because of timeout problems with dial on
&gt; demand, but I wrote a couple of shell scripts that are run by cron
&gt; that resolved this.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope this may be of some help.  Let me know if you need further
&gt; help.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Steve Tee.

&gt; Subject:	SEC: U Settings up RedHat 6.1 box as mail server for
&gt; Windoze PC's
&gt; 
&gt; Hi All.
&gt; 
&gt; I have been asked to look at a mini network that comprises 1 RedHat
&gt; 6.1
&gt; linux box and two Windoze PC's.
&gt; 
&gt; The RedHat box is set up so that it periodically will dial the ISP and
&gt; download mail, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What I'd like to do then is set the linux box up so that it can the
&gt; act
&gt; as a mail server for the Windoze PC's. So, after the linux box has
&gt; downloaded the new mail, the Windoze machines can then use whatever
&gt; client to access that email from the linux box.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone done this...or can anyone help with suggestions as to how I
&gt; could accomplish this ?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Kristian.
