Disable DMA.  DMA works 95% oif the time, but on my old drive/PC
combination, it did things like that. hdparm has options to turn it on
or off from the command line, but you really want to have it disabled
from startup, which means you need to add something to your lilo config.
Check the hd doco in /usr/src/linux/Documentation anyway for more info.
If you recompile the kernel you can turn off the "Enable DMA by default"
option, but that's overkill for you.

&gt; I keep getting this message similar to:
&gt; 
&gt;     EXT2-fs error (device 03:01): ext2_new_block: Free blocks count
&gt; corrupted for block group 9
&gt; 
&gt; This is looking very software (I can tell: there's no fire). After
&gt; re-partitioning / reformatting / re-installing linux (the last guy had
&gt; used the defaults), I got this one....
&gt; 
&gt;     EXT2-fs warning (device 03:03): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not
&gt; in datazone - block =  xxxxxxx: count = 1
&gt; 
&gt; where xxxxxxx is anywhere between 2 million and 3 million.
&gt; 
&gt; When I re-installed I ran badblocks, which didn't complain, further
&gt; pointing the finger at the software (never had any problems before
&gt; though).
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody got any ideas? Know of any bugs in the IDE / File system drivers
&gt; that need patching (and where to find said patches)? I am running RedHat
&gt; 5.2 with kernel 2.0.36. The machine is a 300MHz Pentium type thing with
&gt; some RAM and a Hard disk. It's doing mail and not a lot else.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks
