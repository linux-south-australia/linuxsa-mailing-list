Linux handles PCI quite ok. There are some very few early release modules
that incorporate pci into their code and hence cause confusion between
themselves and the kernel (but they've mostly been re-written).

ISAPNP is a different story.

The immediate temptation is to simply (ha!) disable pnp, jumper it for exact
resources and viola!

The reality is, that regardless of OS you have to tweak the bios/cmos to
account for NON PCI cards, forget whether they're pnp or vanilla. You can't
get round it, and you can't step sideways, you must configure your cmos.

Since you have to go down this tunnel, and since any? isa card still
manufactured incorporates pnp (you have to jump this hoop each time), you
might as well get it right the first time. We aren't talking OS here, we're
stating that the cmos, followed by correct pnp config paramaters, have to
be setup on your computer regardless.

when the kernel boots up and passes control to init , the very first thing
it does is sniff out ISA PNP cards. So, you might as well take advantage of
it for painless installs each time, every time.

After all, any other alterative begins like this.......

"boot into dos" HUH?

"insert the special whizz bangy floppy and use it to configure your XYZ
to jumperless" (OH Yeah? right, another meaningless techo term.)

"if your driver comes on CD install the atapi driver in congig.sys then in
autoexec.bat, fire up CDROM"

good learning curve for linux right?

have a look at the site below for ISAPNP
