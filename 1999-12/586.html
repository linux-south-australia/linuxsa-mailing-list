only for those configured to 0x300 obviously. Irq 10, obviously.

sb16 yes. SBAWE32 / 64 is almost essential to use pnp because of the 620,A20
and E20 (undocumented) addresses. CMI1838 (almost any crystal audio?)
snaffles io 0x300 by default. ESS1868? (not too sure of the number) has only one
8 bit dma channel. The invocation modprobe blah dma=1, dma16=-1 is almost
useless without pnp. Some of the notorious Sis onboard chipsets require pnp
(bit difficult to cripple  them with no bios or jumper options &lt;grin&gt;). The
aha1520E ultra wide can only run in pnp, making scsi problematic without it.
Your mileage varies on this one dependant on the aha chip(set) employed.
Most nics have jumpless mode, but their eeprom can only be accessed by a dos
utilty. nasty nasty. (there is a linux eeprom binary available for _some_
eeprom chips, you go figure which ones, nice pastime). Some of the newer isa
modems are pnp configured for irq 9, nice excercise to change that, unless you
love setserial and enjoy killing the exit 0 statement hidden craftily at the
top of rc.serial

 &gt; I am sure there is probably a good reason for running isapnp 

Despite the above. My view is that many new comers use dual boot windoze.
Suddenly depending on the phase of the moon, whether it's wednesday, your io
config is changed by windoze on the fly. Second, clearing cmos ram, or, 'set
cmos defaults' does fascinating things to the stored paramaters of where
existing (isa) devices are. When Linux suddenly goes belly up 'for no apparent
reason' it's a good excuse to drink coffee, tear hair, and mutter a few curses.
It's also an illimunating experience,  but it is not productive. The problem is
solved, permanently, by using /etc/isapnp.conf because you are not dependant on
what the systems' bios 'thinks' is ok.
