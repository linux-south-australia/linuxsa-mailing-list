Hi,

&gt; Back to the security issue, I have checked the syslog,
&gt; and the .login ( we use bash shell not csh ) I have
&gt; check in the system and user bash profile and found
&gt; nothing have changed since I setup.
&gt; Do you think I'm being monitor from the sunbox? I have
&gt; no authority from the sunbox except a regular user id?

I would think there is a good chance. Check your login scripts on the Sun
Box as well, and systems login scripts for funny programs. SUNOS/Solaris
isn't that diferent from linux that you shouldn't recognise most of the
commands. Given you don't trust a particular cow-orker and he runs that
box that would be one of the first places I look.

&gt; 
&gt; Is there any program from the network that can audit
&gt; user across the network? 

There are several programs to watch the network. Enligtenment is one, and
TCP Dump another. It depends what you are trying to do. I would think
there are hacker programs out there that do a good job of logging all
packets related to something or other as well.

&gt; Do you think it is better you use ssh to replace bash
&gt; ?

Ssh is not a shell like bash, its a replacement for telnetd (tho not
exclusivly). It is only really useful if you ssh all the way tho..ie

ssh client to sun box (unloss doing a console login on sun box). If this
is a PC use tssh as an add on to TeraTerm.
Ssh from sun box to linux box (you'll need to get cow-orker to install ssh
on his box).

You will now be able to use your linux box as if you had telnetted to it.

You can also send data through ssh streams, but I haven't looked into that
yet. I would think that there would be man pages, web pages and HOWTOs
dedicated to that tho.

cya
