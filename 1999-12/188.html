&gt; Matt, would it be possible to ellaborate on the autoexec.bat solution?
&gt; thanks

Some sound cards (I know the ESS cards before the Solo did) come with DOS-BASED
drivers that get loaded by config.sys. Then they quite often have an executable
which will configure the mixer volume and IRQs and DMA channels and things. If
your sound card comes with such utilities, you can load them through DOS. For
some reason, Linux detects the existence of quite a few cards a lot better when
you do this.

For example,
A friend of mine had a generic SB compatible. Linux wouldn't acknowledge it's
existence when booting from LILO. He changed his machine to boot Windows 95 and
bring up a menu asking if he wants to boot Linux or Windows (easy to do - check
your local DOS 6.x manual). If he chose Linux, the config sys was set to load
the DOS based driver, and then the autoexec.bat would run loadlin to boot his
Linux Kernel.

Mine (an ESS-1868) was the same, except I had an extra command in the
autoexec.bat to run another utility (before loadlin ;-)), which would configure
the I/O ports and things. It initialised them each time to the same values, but
that's because Windows insisted on changing them (randomly) when I booted it.

Hope that's clearer.

Matt
