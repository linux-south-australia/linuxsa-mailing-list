Grrr....
I wish I'd asked you about this before.
The Internode rates for global roaming seem better than
for connect.com.au.
In the past, I've found that everything from Internode is high
price. But maybe this is one service which is cheaper.

This is linux-relevant because the first few global
ISPs I checked out (Compuserve, AOL etc.) said they could not
give simple, standard PPP access for linux. They needed their own
MS-OS software to be run.
That's why I ended up with connect.com.au, which offers connection
to the GRIC.

The connect.com.au rates seem to be:

$7.95	up front
$10	per month forever
$8	per hour of connection to GRIC

The Internode rates seem to be:

$29	up front
$10	per month in which usage is non-zero
$6	per hour of connection to GRIC + $0.50 "flagfall".

Considering that I'm unlikely to use the access in most
months of the year, it looks like the Internode rates
come out better after a typical 12 months.

Now I'll have to create a web page of bookmarks for
all the global roaming ISPs and compare/contrast.
What a bother!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  This _is_ linux-relevant.
The moment you get linux on a laptop and want to
wander round the planet and stay in touch, life becomes
tougher than for the sheep.
I bet there might be other people who have also asked if
they can have linux on their laptop and still do all the things
that the conformists do.
