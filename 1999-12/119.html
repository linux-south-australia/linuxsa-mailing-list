 &gt;The Older sparc's will only boto from a 512byte block CDROM.
 &gt;I have a Sparc SLC, with 16mb at home running OpenBSD 2.5 quite nicely.
 &gt;and I used to have a Sparc Station 5 with 64M running SparcLinux (Redhet 
4.2)
 &gt;it was _very_ much faster than running Solaris on the box.

I have several SPARC Classics and a couple of IPX's, and the regular routine
of creating boot disks from the Linux for SPARC CDROM is all I need to
do to enable the process of booting these old machines to up to the external
CDROM Drive.  Many people told me before I tried this, was that the only way
to install an OS on these machines was to find a operating system that
would boot from the CDROM Drive. So I installed Solaris on them, And it was
terribly  slow.  I them got my hands on a copy of Linux for SPARC, made the
boot disks and it installed off from there. And yes it does run a lot faster.
