&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently looking to learn a cross platform scripting language and was
&gt; wondering which one

Perl is very powerful, and very portable. Possibly not the easiest one
to learn, but still easier than many "real" languages. Also depends what
you mean by cross-platform, and what you actually want to script. If you
are just talking cross-unix, then any of the shells (csh, bash, ksh,
etc) would be OK, as would awk, sed, etc. If you want Windows as well,
then Perl is your friend. I don't know about Mac. You could look into
Tcl as well, but I personally have no knowledge of that... If you are
really looking for some web-page scripting, then JavaScript is the one,
although you need to be careful with IE/Navigator differences. Or if you
want server-side web page scripting, then try Perl, PHP3, or just any
language with CGI...

&gt; 
&gt; I also want a cross platform toolkit Tk?

Perl/Tk bindings exist... Again, it really depends what you are trying
to do... I have no idea if Tk exists for Windows. Qt does, but I doubt
Perl bindings exist...

HTH
