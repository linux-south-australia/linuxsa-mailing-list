OK, reports aren't designed to have Parts, thus the problem.

The simplest answer is to use /section /subsection and
/subsubsection.

If you really need Parts, then initialise the Part counter
manually.

If you are just beginning, I'd suggest working withing the
confines of the predefined styles.


&gt; Or - does anyone have any good LaTeX FAQ's that actually address this?  I
&gt; would think that someone else must have come up with the problem, but the
&gt; FAQs I searched didn't even mention section numbering problems :(

1.
  Lamport, Leslie
  LaTeX, a document preparation system.  User's guide and reference manual.
  Addison-Wesley.  1986.

  There may be a later version that describes LaTex2e rather than 2.09.

2.

3.
  The TeTeX installation has

    /usr/share/texmf/doc/

  which is many, many files of documentation.


&gt; Btw - once I've got this problem sorted out, TeX is going to become my
&gt; only typesetting program..  Word can finally get the kick :)  Hoorah :)

In which case I'd suggest using LyX or XEmacs+AUCTeX as well.

Most serious document producers end up using either LaTeX or FrameMaker.
The limitations of other packages really don't kick in unless you are
writing a book or thesis.


&gt; Is there such a thing as a DVI-to-Word.DOC converter?

No.  You can generate PDF.  You probably want to recompile GhostScript
with LZW support and use the Adobe fonts if you are doing that.
