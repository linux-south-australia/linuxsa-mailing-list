Hi
Hoping someone can help, I admit I'm a Newbie I've been reading heaps
but I don't understand some of the lingo or where to make the
modifications required.
Here's the basics
I've just installed Mandrake Linux with KDE and I've run into a few
problems.
1. Modem Installation
2. Sound card Configuration
3. Scanner Set up
4. and a query PCI Devices not Identified by system
5. A suitable Smaller Linux Installation using RPM style for 486 w 4 mg
ram 170 mg HDD i.e. can be loaded by floppy  prefer Xwindows.
Before you read on be warned It's a long Email I've included all the
details I think relevant and probably some that aren't.If there are
details i should hae provided please ask me for them.
What I've seen so far I like but I do like to have my system setup so
everything works. (I mean all the time not like MS)
PS I've managed to setup my 3Dfx Banshee to run in 16bit color 1024 x
764 and boot direct to KDE but that was minor compared to the above



1. I have a ISA Dynalink Internal modem
I have altered the Bios to set this card up as ISA
I have run isapnp dumped it to etc/isapnp.conf and ended up with a heap
of options
In W98 it setup as (IRQ 11) ( IO 03e8h-03e8h)
so I Unhashed the appropriate options and got a conflict , tried all the
other option and either got a conflict or denied access I rehashed the
(IO) option and it sets up on IRQ 11
QUESTION Do I need the (IO) set here or not?
If so How?
(/proc/ioports Appendix A  below)
(/proc/interupts Appendix B below)
(/proc/dma Appendix c below)
Having determined the above correctly how do I find which port it is set
up in; I gather from the documentation(and I admit I have misinterpreted
it ) that each IO port is a different ttys?? which then needs to be
linked to /dev/modem by inserting a line something like,  ln
/dev/ttys??  /dev/modem .
I am using KDE and/or Gnome, I haven't decided which way to go yet so If
I need to do something in either of these i.e.. to use Kppp and Netscape
Communicator Please let me know.
PS I am using these as the most similar to what I am used to I know
there are other tools and I will try them my immediate concern is to
replace this system from MS.




2. I have a cmi8330 onboard sound system which I am having problems
setting up In part it relates to the above as isapnp dumps the settings
for this when I was trying to set up the modem.
I chose the following options
LD 0
IO  0     0 x0530   IRQ 12
IO  1     1 x 388
DMA 0

LD1
IO 0    0x330    IRQ 9

LD 2
IO  0   00x200

LD 3
IO  0   0x220    IRQ 5
DMA 0  ch3
DMA 1  ch5

after a lot of "playing" before it was accepted by isapnp however it
still throws a line something like  "LD does not ..... this may not
matter ...please insert the line (...) after doing as this suggests it
appears to load correctly but still does not play.
PS I tried sndconfig and it wouldn't set up properly either although it
did give me some sound at test it would not play midi or wav file later.

pss I noticed on reboot I am getting a red fail for
/module 2.2-9-19 mdk/misc  mpu401.0 mit_module     (or something to this
effect)
I'm wondering if this setup is conflicting with my modem setting up,
just a thought!

3. I have a Microtech Scanmaker E6 on its proprietary SCSI card which
does not get recognized at setup by the SCSI detection portion of the
setup. This is an ISA Card with the Bios set to ISA for it. The set up
in W98 is
IRQ 9 - Adaptec AHA -150X/1510/152X/AIC-6x60 SCSI host adapter using IO
0140h - 015Fh
Can someone please guide me where to go next, or even howto configure
this manually if required.

4. While meandering through files trying to find more relevant
information on the above I found /proc/pci listing 6 devices 2 of which
are registered as unknown devices. Does this mean I need to modify the
system to work properly with these devices or are they identified
elsewhere. I think judging from the names given (acer Labs) they are
system parts of the Alladin M/B. Anyway I included the portion of
proc/pci file as Appendix D below.
Actually a few of the settings I expected in the following files i.e.
printer on IRQ 7 dont appear to be present .

5. I have a smaller system  that I would like to set up for the kids I
am looking for a small Linux system to set up on it but Redhat/Mandrake
is far to big for the HDD and when the cut down xwindows is applied far
to slow on 4 mg is there a smaller version using RPMs as I would like it
to be compatable or at least similar to set up. Any Ideas or Sites to
pick up these from would be appreciated.Or the basic list of Rpms
required to put together my own small system if necessary
