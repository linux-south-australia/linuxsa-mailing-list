well, while we're on this inane topic... 

I find that the combination of useless CDs and a microwave can be quite
pretty. I believe that in order to get the best effect, you place the CD
shiny side DOWN on top of a cup of water, turn the kitchen lights off,
and turn the microwave on for a couple of seconds, quickly switching it
off after you have seen the show (You'll know when you see the show --
it looks vaguely remeniscent of the Quad Damage effect in Quake 3). A
word of caution, though... make sure you don't have a smoke detector,
and try to have decent ventilation -- Aluminium vapour doesn't smell too
good.

My experience has been that your normal CDs are quite good, but the best
effects are with CDRs. Take one that didn't work too well (you had a
buffer underrun or something), and use it. I find that the silver-green
SONYs work better that the dark blue TraxData (both as CDRs and as light
shows... :)

Also, the patterns that are left on the CDs when you finish can be quite
attractive... Again, the CDRs look much better than the normal CDs...
But, the best bet is to try this yourself...

enjoy (and don't come running back to me if your microwave
self-destructs -- Microwaves aren't really meant to have bits of
aluminium put in them...)

&gt; &gt; Perhaps we should have a contest at the next meeting to
&gt; &gt; see how far an AOL CDs can be rolled on its side.  Winner
&gt; &gt; gets to keep the CD :-)
&gt; 
&gt; What about a competition like:
&gt;   "Most innovative use for unused/useless CD's"
&gt; 
&gt; I've always wanted to see how they would fly if spun up to some
&gt; ridiculous speed first, and if it would be possible to get them to
&gt; hover/takeoff with some appropriate remanufacturing of the disk.
