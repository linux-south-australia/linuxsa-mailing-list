&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; AFAIK, this is just not true! At least, the *must* part is not.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I *never* set adapters into Plug and Pray mode.  I have lots of old
&gt;&gt; adapters that do not know about PnP.
&gt;
&gt;Read the StepByStep before pronouncing it's not
&gt;necessary. The cmos (here's that word again) *must* be set up for isa on
almost
&gt;all modern pc's. (ok so that's not strictly an isapnp issue) Some cards
cannot
&gt;be removed from pnp. You can also jump  through hoops loading dos, running
&gt;ethernic Jumperless mode floppy disks, you can get lucky and let a dual boot
&gt;windoze system do all the hard work so that linux just happens to work ok.

OK, let me say in my defence that I have systems I administer out there
that have 2.0.x kernels on them with RH 5.2, as well as systems with 2.2.x
kernels on them for TurboLinux and RH6.0.  I also have a number of recent
motherboards where I have not had to tell them not to use PnP.

And since I got my scars the hard way, why shouldn't they also :-)

&gt;And, until the advent of the 2.2 kernels isapnp.conf was something you added 
&gt;to
&gt;your system, now, it is the very first binary called out of
&gt;/etc/rc.d/rc.modules The fact that you don't use pnp mode is fine, the fact
&gt;that many newcomers to linux are hit with this problem is not fine. They have
&gt;the choice of using your method (which works) or taking advantage of the new
&gt;kernels ability to do so.

But it is still not the case that you *must* use isapnp ...

However, I will *agree* that it does make life easier for newbies, but then
so do PCI cards, and most systems come with PCI cards these days ...

There was nary an ISA card among the four DELL systems we purchased at one
site recently ... Indeed, the Dell PowerEdge 1300 had 6 PCI slots and only
one ISA slot in it.
