 &gt; After reading what you guys wrote about permanent connections, I 
 &gt; thought I'd ask my ISP (BOLDWeb - bold.net.au) what, if anything, they 
 &gt; could come up with that would suit me. The following two options are 
 &gt; what they came up with:
   [ option one deleted -- too expensive ]
 &gt; 2)     Line rental: $25/month + $60/month (to 150 Meg) + 22c/Meg
 &gt;        "total cost": $85.00 (to 150Meg) + data.
 &gt;        $100 = 218.2 Meg/month (7.17 Meg/day average)
 
For the same monthly fee you get about half a gigabyte per month 
through Telstra on option 2 billing.  *AND* it runs at 56k (if Bold are
installing a dedicated PSTN modem for you, you'll get 33.6k at most).

If you take the fact that Telstra will charge you $500 setup in the
first year into account, you still get an extra 10 Mbytes/month out of
them than you do out of Bold at those prices, then in the second year
you get over twice as much traffic for the same price.  You only
commit to $20 per month in traffic too, so if you decide to go on 
holidays for a few weeks you won't have to pay WetSpot $85 for the 
privilege of having an unused account open.

 &gt; Benefit: A permamnet (live) IP number.

&lt;shrug&gt;  Option 2 billing with Telstra Wet Spot gives you a whole
subnet.

 &gt; Requirement 1: Two weeks (maximum) to set things up (lines are only 
 &gt; being
 &gt;                connected as required). 
 
I'm astonished that they're still using modems.  I thought anyone of
any decent size these days used digital access servers so that they
could provide 56k.

A WetSpot connection takes about 24 hours to set up, incidentally.

Now, let's recap:

                      WetSpot                  BoldWeb
Setup time            1 day                    2 weeks
Speed                 56k                      33.6k
Per megabyte rate     $0.19/Mbyte              $0.40/Mbyte for first 150 Mbytes
                                               $0.22/Mbyte thereafter
Port rental           $0.00                    $25
Minimum monthly cost  $20 (incl 105 Mbytes)    $85 (incl 150 Mbytes)
Minimum contract      6 months                 12 months
Setup fee             $500                     $0.00


So, given that you asked Bold to come up with something to suit you,
and they've given you a package which is inferior to WetSpot in almost
every measurable respect, do you plan to take their package up?

I'm no fan of Telstra, as virtually anyone will be able to tell you.
But, if you require raw, basic 56k permanent net connectivity with
no extras (i.e.: no domain hosting, setup assistance, ongoing support;
you just want a raw net connection) they're pretty hard to beat.  If
you're a business with little in the way of in-house technical ability
(so you can't fix it yourself if it falls over), or if you want something
faster than 56k (the ISDN price from Telstra isn't quite as attractive
as what you can get elsewhere) then go with a real ISP (especially the
ones who are serious about the "S" part), but if you just want a
permanent net link at home you may as well use WetSpot.
