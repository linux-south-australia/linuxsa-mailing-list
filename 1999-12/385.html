 &gt; Hmmm, I am sure that Make knows the difference between the access rate and
 &gt; the bandwidth that you have purchased.

&lt;shrug&gt;  We don't draw a distinction:  If we install a 100 Mbps service,
it's because we've purchased 100 Mbps of bandwidth.

 &gt; So, is all of that 100Mb/s available to Internode, and just what is the
 &gt; rate for 100Mb/s? :-)

If you wish to buy a 100 Mbps link to Internode, we'd be delighted to
sell it to you (and you'd be delighted with the speed of the resulting
net link too).

Internode's connectivity currently consists of:

    - A 100 Mbps FDDI connection to Telstra
    - A 100 Mbps Agile Carrier Data Service to connect.com.au
    - A 100 Mbps Agile Carrier Data Service to SAIX (yes, these are
      separate 100 Mbps services, even though they terminate in the
      same room :-)
    - 2 x 2 Mbps Megalink connections to Telstra (which we use for
      domestic non-web traffic and some of our backchannel)
    - 2 Mbps Satellite bandwidth direct from the US

Additional 100 Mbps connections are currently in development.

So yes, we have several 100 Mbps connections coming into our computer
room.  We can pull external bandwidth over any of them, which is one
of the redundancy features we offer:  If an upstream feed goes down,
we can switch to a different one.

As I said in a previous message, anyone who's thinking of becoming
an Internode customer is welcome to visit the facilities and have a
(rather geeky :-) tour of the server room.  If there's interest, I
can organize something a bit more formal (but obviously not for the
entire body of people at a LinuxSA meeting, for example - the room
isn't that big;  but groups of fifteen or so are fairly easy to deal
with, and we often have IT classes through...
 
 &gt; &gt;different sources of bandwidth (Telstra, connect.com.au and SAIX),
 &gt; &gt;Satellite bytes direct from the US, very fast internal infrastucture
 &gt; &gt;based exclusively around Cisco 100 Mbps switches, backup power, backup
 &gt; &gt;airconditioning (very important :-), backups of all of our servers, 
 &gt; &gt;a professional controlled environment with pin-number and swipe-card
 &gt; &gt;security, 24 hour monitoring, 24 hour support, a "No busy signals, EVER"
 &gt; 
 &gt; Hmmm, it is true, I don't get busy signals, but one of those damn modems
 &gt; will never lock on, and I occassionally get kicked off, as well.

Has it improved in the last couple of weeks?  We did a modem firmware
upgrade in one of our access-servers...
