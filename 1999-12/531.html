&gt; Hi all,
&gt;     I have a 486 that has been functioning as a proxy server that seems
&gt; to have died horribly - on power-up the power supply just makes
&gt; repetitive clicking noises - even the cooling fans fail to start.
&gt; Sometimes though, it will seem to switch on (ie the fans start, and the
&gt; hard drives spin up) but the power indicator (which is connected to the
&gt; power supplies 5 volt rail) still fails to light, and nothing happens on
&gt; the motherboard (the network card lights stay off etc)
&gt;     I vaguely remember someone talking to me about how the motherboard
&gt; has control over the power supply via the reset line or something like
&gt; that. Could it be that the motherboard is stuffed?
&gt; Thankyou,
&gt; Sam Silvester.

Your thinking of an ATX	power supply  [switchable via a lead to M/B]
in a 486 I would bet  you have an AT power supply [switched by a 240v
line and switch , often at the front of the case].   Either way the PSU
is no good,  buy a new one  straight away [their not that expensive]
or as a temp measure rip one out of an unused 486,  386, etc you have
lying around. Just be carefull with the 240 line and switch.
