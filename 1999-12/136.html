&gt;  &gt;I have a Sparc SLC, with 16mb at home running OpenBSD 2.5 quite nicely.
&gt;  &gt;and I used to have a Sparc Station 5 with 64M running SparcLinux (Redhet
&gt; 4.2)
&gt;  &gt;it was _very_ much faster than running Solaris on the box.
&gt;
&gt; I have several SPARC Classics and a couple of IPX's, and the regular
routine
&gt; of creating boot disks from the Linux for SPARC CDROM is all I need to
&gt; do to enable the process of booting these old machines to up to the
external
&gt; CDROM Drive.  Many people told me before I tried this, was that the only
way
&gt; to install an OS on these machines was to find a operating system that
&gt; would boot from the CDROM Drive.
Actully depending on which os u choose, you can install over a network
connection , from the floppy drive itself, form tape as mentioned or from a
external hardrive. Nearly all the older sparcs machines can be netbooted and
run xterms without local harddrives.

I do mine by network as i dont have a external scisi cdrom =].

oh btw OpenBSD 2.6 was realeased on december the 1st, lot faster then 2.5 or
so it seems.

brad
 So I installed Solaris on them, And it was
&gt; terribly  slow.  I them got my hands on a copy of Linux for SPARC, made
the
&gt; boot disks and it installed off from there. And yes it does run a lot
faster.
