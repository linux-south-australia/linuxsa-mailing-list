&gt; Your advice, please.
&gt; I want to set up a small network & thought it would be a GOOD idea to have
&gt; cards with jumpers so I could be CERTAIN of the IRQ and address each card
&gt; was using.
&gt;
&gt; However, Messrs Westan advise:
&gt; "None of the PCI ethernet cards have jumpers on them. I think it's the same
&gt; for all brands of PCI ethernet cards. On most ISA ethernet cards, you can
&gt; run the SETUP driver disk to configure it to Plug 'n' Play or Jumperless
&gt; (legacy)."
&gt;
&gt; What should I do?
&gt; Your advice will be MUCH appreciated.

Try Netgear cards. They come with Linux drivers (ours did anyway). Most cards
that are supported by the kernel will be fine. Try looking at the help files
for each network card drivers in the kernel:

    cd /usr/src/linux
    make menuconfig
    select Network Device Support
    pick a driver for a card you think might be good and hit 'h'

Personally I have only ever had a few problems with 3com cards (10 or 100).
Occaisionally we are forced to bring down the network interface and bring it
back up again, but that machine is evil anyway.

Also, when you go to buy your card (even if you know the answer), try asking
the sales guy if it will work with Linux. Eventually if we all do this, he
will ask the same thing of his wholesaler, who will ask the card
manufacturers, which will give people like Donald Becker a chance to see
daylight.
