Hi Nic,
it sounds like you have a win-modem. If your modem is plugged into a PCI
slot then you can be about 99% sure that it is one of these beasts.
I would recommend that you purchase an external modem. There are two
good reason for this, the first being it easier to upgrade modem as
nessacary and secondly if your phone line gets hit by lightning then you
whole computer wont get zapped.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; Just installed RedHat 6.0 yesterday. I was trying to configure my modem.
&gt; I removed the lock line int the /etc/ppp/options file and started up the
&gt; KDEppp tool
&gt; after having made a symbolic link to the port COM3 using modemtool. I went
&gt; to setup and the Devices tab to make sure it was pointing to /dev/modem, set
&gt; the speed, then went to the Modem tab, and clicked Query Modem, and all I
&gt; got was 'modem is busy' message.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a built-in Rockwel with 56Kflex modem. Is it something to do with me
&gt; not being able to turn it on manually? I hope someone can lead me to a
&gt; solution, as i don't want to have to reboot into this sluggish windows all
&gt; the time just to check my emails.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks in anticipation,
&gt; 8-[]    Nic
