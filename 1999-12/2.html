&gt; Where can I find 'understandable' information about chmod and what it does?

------
it's an archaic octal convention that's thrown you.

if you are absolutely desperate to move forward, you can type in

chmod 777  whatever

some programs however are smart enough to look at their own permissions
and say no way, i'm not running open to the world like that. The above is
not a good idea, unless you're flat desperate.

here is a safe one if 'just you' plan to use the file

chmod 664 whatever (for 'text' type files)
and
chmod 774 whatever (for executing a program of that name)
--------

&gt; How do I mount a drive when not logged in as root? Can I do this in a bootup
&gt; script??

yes, certainly. the file you are most interested in is /etc/fstab and
scripting aint necessary.

as root you can edit /etc/fstab

1)
mkdir /mnt/whatever      (makes a directory for you)

chmod 777 /mnt/whatever 
(this is a rare occasion you really do want to do this)

in etc fstab you want to insert (or modify) a line looking like this

/dev/hdXY /mnt/whatever  iso9660  defaults,auto, user  0 0

"iso0660" is for cd's, "vfat" would be for a windows partition.

the thing to focus on here is "auto,user" It automatically mounts at boot
time and allows you, not just root, to mount it.

hdXY is a little tricky. it means drive and partition as in hda1. For a
cdrom it will be something like /dev/hdd. (no numeric)

I suspect you're trying to automount windows. It is most likely to be
/dev/hda1 in your system.

&gt; 
&gt; What should be the permissions etc for /dev/modem because I changed them and
&gt; don't know how to change them back again?

it is perfectly safe, and very sensible to 

chmod 777 /dev/modem

it is actually a link to a specific serial port. you can find out which one
by typing

ls -l  /dev/modem

it is also a good idea to change the serial port to

chmod 666 ttyS?   (? = 0,1,2 or 3)

dialling software that use the modem link, alter the permissions 'on the
fly' but they don't get past first base if the permissions are wrong to
begin with.
