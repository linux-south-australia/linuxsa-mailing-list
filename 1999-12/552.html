&gt; Hi Bruce
&gt; 
&gt; I just read your post to the linuxsa mailing list about problems you
&gt; were having with the mouse once dialed up. I appear to be having the
&gt; same problem with both Open Linux and Red Hat 6.0. I am guessing it is
&gt; something that i have configured incorrectly, were you able to get a
&gt; resolution?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in Advance
&gt; Jeroen

Hi Jeroen,

The problem I was having was that once I had dailled in and made a
connection to the ISP, I was not able to start any more X programs by
selecting them from screen or menu icons. I could start from the command
line, provided I had done `xhost +` in that command shell prior to
dialling up.

This problem came about because the dailup software I use, kppp, had
been configured to set my PCs hostname from the ISP once connected. This
then confused X into thinking that it did not have permission to start
any X clients on the newly named X server, i.e. my PC. I am not sure if
this is your problem, or if my explanation is clear enough. If not, send
more info and i will try to help.

To fix this I unchecked a box in the configuration of kppp and away i
went. I'll try to find that now...

kppp -&gt; setup -&gt; &lt;select the account&gt; -&gt; edit -&gt; IP
uncheck the box that says "Auto-configure hostname from this IP"

Give that a go and let me know how you go.

Bruce
