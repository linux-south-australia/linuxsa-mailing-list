Well, not exactly...

I've never had this 'feature' on the LinuxSA list, but I've noticed that on
some (less than 10%) of messages I get from the linux C and C++ lists, that
my e-mail client says the from address is from my own domain!

Start with the info about my setup:
I have a win98 box, which i do all my work from, including reading e-mail,
with Outlook 2000. I get my mail from a Linux box, installed with RedHat 6.0
(but some packages were upgraded from the 6.1 CD). I run a permanent 'net
connection on it, with my own domain, which is where the mail gets delivered
to. it's running sendmail 8.9.3-10.

I find this all strange, because it only happens to some e-mails. I'll
select the message, and it'll be displayed in the preview pane. In the From
field, it'll say something like <A HREF="mailto:user@mail.my.domain">user@mail.my.domain</A> (where my.domain is my
real domain, but this is shorter to type) :) Also, the user part is the
person's user name, at his own ISP, and user is not a valid user on my
machine.

If I double click on the message to open it in another window, the From
field says "<A HREF="mailto:user@mail.my.domain">user@mail.my.domain</A> on behalf of Some Person
[<A HREF="mailto:user@their.own.isp">user@their.own.isp</A>]". If I go to view -&gt; options, to look at the headers,
there's a header that says "Sender: <A HREF="mailto:user@mail.my.domain">user@mail.my.domain</A>", but also "From:
"Some Person" &lt;<A HREF="mailto:user@thir.own.isp">user@thir.own.isp</A>&gt;".

I checked the mail list's archive, and the from address is
<A HREF="mailto:user@their.own.isp">user@their.own.isp</A>, so I think it's something my mail server is doing. The
mailing list uses a reply-to header, so if I click on reply (or reply to
all), it'll only come up with the mailing list's address, not the senders :(

Like I said, this only happens to a small number of e-mails (possible from
the same user(s), but I'm not sure, since I havn't really taken too much
notice and since it doesn't happen very often). I'm not sure what could be
causing this, so any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks,
Andy
