&gt; My friend tried to install RH6.0 on his brand new PC. Installation fails
&gt; to find his hard disk. When going to partition HDD it says something
&gt; like "No hard disks". He's got 4 ports for hdd?! Mboard manual says 2
&gt; are 33 and other 2 are 66 something? So he connected his drive to 66
&gt; which supposed to be faster. I don't know what it is all about, just

I had a similar problem which I emailed the list about before. As it turns
out, ATA/66 drives require drivers other than your normal IDE drivers to
work. Of course, these are going to be dependent on the kind of ATA/66
BIOS that the motherboard has.

I had an Abit motherboard with the HighPoint Tech HPT366 BIOS - Linux drivers
are available from the hipoint-tech.com web site, as well as links to Linux
drivers for other ATA/66 BIOSes.

Also, bear in mind that you should not be running a normal IDE drive from
the ATA/66 controllers - these are for ATA/66 drives only.

(You can run an ATA/66 drive from a normal IDE controller, but you may need
to download a drive utility to turn off the ATA/66 function of the drive - 
my Western Digital ATA/66 drive came with the ATA/66 function enabled, even
though the documentation says that it ships disabled by default.)

For those that are interested: I contacted VMware about raw disk partition
booting on ATA/66 drives (as this is not supported currently with SCSI drives)
and they think that is should work, even though it's not tested. I opted in
the end to run my drive in normal IDE mode, although I had to change 
motherboards in the end - has anyone else ever seen the HDD parameters
change in the BIOS after rebooting as a result of partitions on the drive?

&gt; Windows boots and works from that drive

Windows 95 and 98 seem to have ATA/66 support built in - Windows NT will
not install without suppling the ATA/66 drivers during install.

Cheers,

Andrew
