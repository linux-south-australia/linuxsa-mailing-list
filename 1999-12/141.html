&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; A friend has a motherboard that insists on playing "Happy Birthday" if
&gt; &gt; it is booted on Nov 13th. He has stripped it down to just the M/B and a
&gt; &gt; video card but this annoying behaviour continues. The board is a VLB
&gt; &gt; with 16 Mb RAM 486DX2-66 with a 1993 AMI BIOS. The only markings, on the
&gt; &gt; reverse side, are
&gt; &gt; SJ-DG 486/3VLS
&gt; &gt; Korea
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; On any day other than Nov 13 it will boot and run quite happily. Virus
&gt; &gt; checkers do not seem to find it and no damage seems to be done in any
&gt; &gt; case.
&gt; &gt; Can anyone shed any light on this problem?
&gt; &gt; Where is it living and how can it be eradicated?
&gt; &gt; We have tried to get the CMOS to reset but this has no effect.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is not really off topic. The intention was to use the board to run
&gt; &gt; a Linux Server.
&gt; 
&gt; Cool, I thought I was the only one who'd ever seen this problem. I had a
&gt; problem with a legend computer with exactly this problem. It seems to be
&gt; in the BIOS. Solution, replace the BIOS, replace the motherboard, or if
&gt; you must boot on november 13th, press DELETE, reset the date to November
&gt; 14th, boot then reset back once it is booted. Was this a Legend brand PC ?
&gt; 
While we don't know what machine this board originally resided in I
would almost be prepared to bet that it was the same board. 

Further tests reveal that replacing the BIOS chip stops the behaviour.
Obviously the tune resides in the BIOS chip. Place the BIOS chip in
another identical board and it functions normally. i.e. no tune. If
someone can read this chip and would like to have a go at decoding it I
sure it can be arranged.

The BIOS is an AMI BIOS 1993, version AB.

Why did you resign from the human race? I simply stopped running.
