Hi All,
    Merries and all that Christmas stuff. I have just
finished setting up a new box for my home network. The
problem I have is that the Linux Drive is very small, only
about 300 Mb, and so I have done a minimum install of RH6.0
and got the network bits running fine, but I want to be able
to run X, as my wife isn't Linux Literate (not yet... &lt;Evil
Smirk&gt;). I am not sure of the best way to do this, my
thoughts are to mount the X directory tree from the server,
and symbolic link to it from the new box, or just straight
mount the server's X directory tree as the new box's X
directory and use it without a symbolic link. Also I am not
sure where to put the hardware X init files since the Video
and Monitor on the new box are obviously different from the
default server settings. Ideally I would like to boot
straight into X so that all my wife gets is an X login box
and no stuffing around with command line stuff directly
(this comes later..ie. crawl, walk, run).

    Having said all of this, I also need to know which
directory to mount from the server to get access to all of
the tools not default installed on a minimum install, like
Emacs, Ghostview, Gimp etc. I would like to do it cleanly so
that I don't have to change default paths etc, or in other
words make it look like a full install to the new box, but
mounting the server's files.

    O.K. this should be a simple procedure, hopefully. If
anyone can help, much appreciated, and if there is an easier
way, please let me know. At present I have a server with a
permanent Net connection, and two boxes hanging off it. One
is a full install of RH 6.0, and the other is a minimum
install. I don't have NIS working yet (I am somewhere
between crawl and walk in experience....probably drunk)

    Cheers!
        Andrew.
