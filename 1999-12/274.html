&gt; &gt; &gt; This is something the Linux community will have to address if
&gt; &gt; &gt; they want Linux to move to the desktop.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The thing I find interesting about comments like this is the attitude
&gt; &gt; that the "Linux Community", especially Commerical Linux support
&gt; &gt; companies, have certain obligations so that Linux will be "accepted by
&gt; &gt; the MS Windows community".
&gt; &gt;

I wasn't aware that there was a Windows community. If we assume you get what
you pay for, you are actually much better off not going with Windows, because
even if you don't feel you are getting absolutely everything done for you,
you're not paying a vast amount of cash for something less functional.

A computer is a tool. A very general purpose tool, but a tool all the same.
How many people do you know that expect to turn on a lathe and have it create
exactly what you want? I honestly believe that there should be some amount of
knowledge before using such a tool. You don't get to drive a car without a
license.  It really pisses me off when we are expected to do everything for
people. It isn't their fault though, I put the blame squarely on the industry
for making the average person feel retarded.

Windows NT has really killed the job of Systems Administration and will
probably give IT people a bad name for a while. I'm not just talking about
the crashes and data lost, but more about the fact that you get Sys admins
who believe that because they have used Windows 95, they can run an entire
LAN or WAN. I have seen this happen. If they are having a problem with
something, they upgrade the hardware. These people won't sit down and work
out that there is too much traffic on the network because each client has 3
protocols installed, they just upgrade to 100BaseT. They are costing the
world a fortune and us our jobs.


But that's enough out of me.....
