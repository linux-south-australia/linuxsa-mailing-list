The military has a saying "Time spent in reconassaince is seldom wasted".
That certainly rings true for software, imho.

The aptly named readme often contains info such as the RH 5.2 perl
distibution being flawed.
I am sure I ahve read about this in many readme's including
majordomo's(but that was at least 12 months ago).

In other words, read the readme! And save time.

Compile and install is often easy. Often configuration and
incompatabilies are the hard bits.
And the readme often covers them.
What is 5 or 10 mintues against hours of frustration?

Regards 
JT

&gt; Users of Redhat 5.2:

&gt; If you still have machines running this OS, and you
&gt; haven't upgraded your Perl yet, I think you should.
&gt; 
&gt; I've just wasted quite some time and stress trying to
&gt; install "majordomo" on a redhat 5.2 machine, and finally
&gt; found in an FAQ that the completely incomprehensible
&gt; messages our of "sendmail" etc. were caused by the
&gt; buggy version (5.00404) of Perl on RH 5.2.
&gt; I upgraded to 5.00503 and it all works fine now.
&gt; 
&gt; I had the same problem some months back with Perl/Tk.
&gt; I wasted huge gobs of time/stress/anguish on this, until
&gt; the Perl/Tk author told me that I should complain to redhat
&gt; about their buggy Perl. Once again, upgrading Perl
&gt; fixed the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,

&gt; PS.  About the "problem" of linux users not being able to
&gt; run the ISP-provided censorware on their machines
&gt; (because not all machines run legacy OSs), 
&gt; the talk in an anti-censorship group is that linux users
&gt; should just pay their $5 and keep quiet about it,
&gt; because otherwise, they'll be censored at the ISP.
&gt; (Hopefully by next Christmas, the upsurge of anger at the
&gt; crippling of the net by the government will get the
&gt; law repealed and the net will be safe for adults again.)
