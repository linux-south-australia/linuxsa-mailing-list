Hello Nick,

I have had quite a bit of experience with a PAM module called pam_smb,
originally written by David Airlie, and I believe still maintained by him.
It may or may not be similar to the pam_ntdom module, but I think it will do
what you want. My understanding is that pam_ntdom is/was a subset of the
Samba development, but pam_smb was developed seperately. Maybe Richard
Sharpe could shed some light on the lineage ?

The last URL I had for pam_smb is: <A HREF="http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/">http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/</A>

You do not mention what type of problems you have with the module. Are they
compilation problems, or problems in the actual use of the module ? Can you
give some examples of the problem, and also the version of pam_ntdom you are
using ? Have you tried pam_smb ?

The pam_smb module also comes with a daemon that caches passwords, making it
work effectively with applications that (rightly or wrongly) repeatedly
verifiy passwords at short intervals (earlier versions of squid were guilty
of this). Caching successful password queries means that your NT or Samba
servers do not get hammered with password verification requests. pam_smb can
validate against a Samba daemon or NT (3.51/4.0) server/workstation.

pam_smb also supports Unix &lt;-&gt; NT username translation (I wrote that part of
the code. Well actually I shamelessly lifted the db example code and stuffed
it into pam_smb ..), eg the mail account on the Linux box may be under the
username "smithf", who is actually the NT User "GHERKIN\Fred_Smith". It *is*
possible to have pam_smb authenticate people who have valid NT accounts (and
passwords), but no Linux credentials, however this is not recommended unless
you are particularly sure of what you are doing. I am not sure how this
would work with mail. Does sendmail/procmail work if the mail user has no
account on the target host ? Hmm ..

I have successfully used pam_smb on a Linux server to validate NT user
account information for people using POP mail, squid proxy servers and the
Apache web server. Theoretically any application that is PAM enabled should
work with pam_smb, although some applications will only support the Unix
accounts as usernames. Eg in Squid I can use the username "Andrew_Speer" (my
NT account), put with the POP server I can only use "aspeer" (but it is
still translated to NTDOM\Andrew_Speer and passwd validated against an NT
server)

I don't see any reason why you can't do what you have requested in you
email, and feel free to email me privately if you have problems getting
pam_smb to work. Which you may have, as I believe that RH6.0 uses Berkeley
DB2, and pam_smb was written for Berkeley DB1.85 - but I can probably help
if you get to that bridge and want to cross it.


Regards,

Andrew Speer

&gt; Hello everyone.
&gt;
[snip]
&gt;
&gt;  - I've seen a PAM module called pam_ntdom.  Now *that* is really what
would
&gt;    be the most useful for me for the immediate future - it is /supposed/
to
&gt;    authenticate user logins using a Windows NT Domain Controller.
&gt;    Unfortunately, though, even after loads of discussion with the author,
I
&gt;    could *not* make it work correctly with my RedHat 6.0 system.  The
author
&gt;    gave up on me :(
&gt;
&gt;    Has anyone heard of anything similar?  Or in fact had pam_ntdom
working?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; The main problem is the whole authentication thing.  I want everyone to
have
&gt; access to email, but they don't all have Linux accounts.  If their NT
&gt; password changes, the Linux password has to be changed seperately.  Yuk.
&gt;
&gt; Thankyou for your time :)  All thoughts are /very/ welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Bye for now.
