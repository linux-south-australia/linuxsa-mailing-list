 &gt; Does anyone else in SA feel like an underdog in terms of Cable Modem type

Cable modems will be limited technology -- The only reason they're
so prevalent in the US is because, like, everyone has cable:  The
infrastructure is everywhere, just about everyone has cable running
past their doorstep or into their building.  Pity the technology sucks
donkeys' balls, but thems the breaks.

Wait for ADSL.  That'll be available everywhere (eventually), because
it uses the same copper your phone line uses, so you don't need to be
lucky enough or rich enough to live in one of the suburbs that were
privileged enough to get served by the insanely stupid cable rollout
that happened a few years ago.  The ADSL roll-out will happen slowly,
because each local telephone exchange needs to be fitted out with
a DSLAM and ATM connectivity back to whatever ISP owns it, but in
the end it'll at least *be there*, which is more than you'll ever be
able to say for Cable.

 &gt; Why us ??

Because we're west of the Vic/NSW border, so we don't exist.
We're not profitable, and even if we were profitable there aren't 
enough of us to raise much of a stink about the poor service.
Like it, lump it, or move to Sydney.

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
