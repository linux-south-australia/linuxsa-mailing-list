&gt; About a week ago, I decided to take courage and buy a laptop,
&gt; stick linux on it, and accept the risk that I'll be embarrassed
&gt; by some lack of MS functionality in the linux
&gt; software mega-klump. 
&gt; Now I'm wondering if I am after all going to regret this.

Once you get through the teething problems, I am sure that you won't
be regretting it.  I know I certianly haven't.

&gt; Well, I've found that every time I save a Powerpoint 97 format
&gt; file (*.ppt) in Star Office and read it in again, the lines
&gt; in bullet items (the most important thing that presentation
&gt; slides must be able to do!) get closer each time.
&gt; Eventually the spacing between lines of a multi-line bullet item
&gt; shrink to about 1/4 of a line -- so that they are unreadable.

Are you keeping the file in Powerpoint format?  If you are then what
you may be doing is doing a PPT -&gt; SO -&gt; PPT conversion each time.
In this process there may be 'quirks' in either format that means
that they cannot be displayed exactly.

On thing to try is going the 'whole' SO way, and then only converting
on demand.  Also have a look at the export filters, since if you can
export as PDF that is a better format for data interchange.

&gt; Trouble is, it isn't open source. So it's not likely
&gt; to get fixed in a hurry. 
&gt; (I downloaded my copy a few days ago from Sun's site.)

Well, in the not too distant future it will be SCL, so source will
be available, but Sun will make claims on any contributed changes

&gt; By the way, I also find that SO displays MW-word 97 format files
&gt; incorrectly on screen (e.g. quote marks seem not to show),
&gt; although they seem to print out okay.
&gt; So has lots of other quirks also.

Again, I would use SO format and export to MS or another suitable
format (PDF or PS) for providing it to other people.

&gt; I should also mention that I tried to find MS-format read/write
&gt; (import/export) capabilites in software like Applix and a couple of
&gt; other office things under linux - but no luck....

There are a number of products 'in development'  Applix should be able
to do at least word (I am not sure about PPT though).

&gt; The recent electricity failures in Adelaide caused two out of
&gt; my three linux machines to fail to re-boot due to
&gt; file-system damage requiring super-user fsck rescue.

Funny, my four Linux systems came up perfectly (I was at work
so I was waiting eagerly to see the links come back up).
To be honest I have hardly ever had a 'inconsistent filesystem'
problem on power outages (caused either by me or ETSA :).

The only time that you would get that sort of crash is if you 
system is caught doing some file system write activity before it
flusshes the disk cache to disk.

&gt; I was in the Flinders Ranges at the time. so this caused
&gt; 24 hours of disconnection from the net.

Ooooohhh the pain!!!!

&gt; Methinks linux needs to acquire better default file systems
&gt; to be able to weather such storms. Not everyone can be expected
&gt; to get a UPS unit.

There are at least 3 journalling filesystems underway. (ReiserFS, ext3
and SGI's xfs)

These journalling filesystems will allow a system to lose power and
be ready to restart almost immeadiately.  I think the options are going
to be *MUCH* better in the late 2.3 kernels or 2.4.

Regards,

Matthew
