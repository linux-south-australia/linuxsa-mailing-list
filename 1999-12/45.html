It was terrible.  You started by saying, if I may cast it into an easy
interpretation, that if security gets in your way just chmod 777.  What
next?  Put the root passwd into /etc/motd, maybe?

If you are in a desparate hurry you can get there quickly by driving as
fast as your car will go and running red lights.  True; but it would be
more responsible to start by saying that in an emergency, when life is
threatened, you can suspend some of the road-traffic rules that normally
apply.

The question was really rather simple: Where do you get good information
on chmod.  A suggestion to use chmod 777 did not answer that question,
not in any way.  The answer, as I suggested before, is to recommend a
good book.  I'm delighted that you tried to help, even though your answer
was poorly conceived.  At this point I think you could do better than to
try to defend that mistake.  Nothing wrong with making a mistake; the
crime is to deny when you are wrong.
