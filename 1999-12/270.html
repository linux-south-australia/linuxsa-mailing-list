&gt; The thing I find interesting about comments like this is the attitude
&gt; that the "Linux Community", especially Commerical Linux support
&gt; companies, have certain obligations so that Linux will be "accepted by
&gt; the MS Windows community".
&gt;

I have to concur with Alex. Linux has certainly been accepted by _MY_
community, and as for the comment that Linux will have to change to meet
someone else's expectations so it can "move to the desktop," well it
very successfully moved to _MY_ users desktops in 1996 and has stayed
put ever since. 

A reflection... my 12 year old daughter now has a laptop for schoolwork.
It is required kit at her new school next year. My wife and I did all
the right things in exploring all the hardware and software options, and
duly reported back to my daughter with a shortlist of two preconfigured
options. After the spiel, her comment "That's all well and good Dad, but
can I load Linux on it?" She was serious. Her new IT teachers might be
in for a bit of a ride.

I wonder what desktop it should be moving towards, if it already
successfully meets our soho/education/household needs?
