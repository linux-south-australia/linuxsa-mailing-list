&gt; The question was really rather simple: Where do you get good information
&gt; on chmod.  A suggestion to use chmod 777 did not answer that question,
&gt; not in any way.  The answer, as I suggested before, is to recommend a
&gt; good book.  I'm delighted that you tried to help, even though your answer
&gt; was poorly conceived.  At this point I think you could do better than to
&gt; try to defend that mistake.  Nothing wrong with making a mistake; the
&gt; crime is to deny when you are wrong.

In fact if anyone cares to search there is a lovely example of David
admitting great wrongness some months back. I remember the moment
well. It was a sunny day back in....

But seriously, I tend to find that admitting being wrong is one of the
greatest factors in flames and general maillist/newsgroup nastyness.
It is hard to do and I know this through experience. It would be nice
not to see a nasty reply to David's e-mail, although I'm probably
being too optomistic.

Of course one could argue that flames are more interesting!!

*waits*

Cheers

Alex!
