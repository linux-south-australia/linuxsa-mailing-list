Same same. The guys who are in other words liekly to be the ones who
answer the tech support line.

I set up one of them home linux permanaent connection and the other I went
to kindergarten with!
I think it is reasnable to say I know them well.
And they really are average tech support guys.

&gt; Telstra didn't have very good support (none in fact) when I called them 12 months
&gt; ago. I had to explain what Linux was before they put me through to someone that
&gt; could tell me they didn't support it.

Was this normal BigPong or BigPong direct, threre is a considerable
difference, normal big pong support virtuall nothing - sure keeps their
support costs down.

&gt; 
&gt; Connect are very good for small businesses / schools. We've had no problems, and
&gt; if they change phone numbers (for example) they even send across a little fax
&gt; letting us know how to reconfigure our router. Even if we don't need it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course the network operations/sys admin staff of SENET and most
&gt; &gt; other ISPs know tons about linux, but they are not likely the people who
&gt; &gt; will be solving your day to day support issues.
&gt; 
&gt; I disagree. But does it really matter? PPP is a not platform specific for most of
&gt; the world, so you shouldn't need too much support from the ISP. You can find out
&gt; whatever you need to know from the Linux Community and request DNS entries and
&gt; things when you know what you are doing. I don't think ISPs really need to
&gt; "support" particular operating systems (with the exception of the majority of
&gt; their customers, who don't know where the any key is).

No PPP is not platform specific, but its configuration cerainly is, and   
there is a world of difference between configuring PPP for linux and
configuring PPP for WinXX or MacOS.

No defaultroute or detach options under Win95 if you see what I mean?

And this is where it seems many people seem to have problems with linux
dial up - in their ppp and NS configuration.

And while it is true you can get oodles of supprt from user communites,
that is not always helpful if you problem is specific to your ISP, stuff
which only there network operation people might know, and make avaialbe
to their tech staff in the form of configuration guides...for popular
platforms eg "...always make sure the user has this turned in the in DUN
connection...". Not much help for a linux user.

Also if you don't have any 'net access 'til the coinfuiguration you are
trying to set up isis up, then user communities are a bit unaccessable.

And people who know about routing, DNS etc etc do not do $12 an hour tech
support telling peopel to turn on their proxies, they do $50K+ a year
network operation and try like hell to avoid taking user calls.
