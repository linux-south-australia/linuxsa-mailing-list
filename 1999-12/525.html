&gt; &gt; Using EPP and ECP modes for the parallel port (set normally in the bios
of
&gt; &gt; newer machines) allows for rates of up to 2MBytes/second.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Ive had EPP working at up to 1.2Mb/s.
&gt;
&gt; Is the theory the same for serial and parallel just on different
&gt; devices?

No... its not.
Serial COM ports are very slow, and theres not much that can be done to fix
that.
Printer Ports always had enough free lines (and partly used ones) that it
could be expanded and remain backwards compatible.
Youll find most newer printers and other devices that use the printer port
will support EPP and maybe ECP.
BTW ECP was designed to be used with multiple devices simultanously (it
includes a kinda address bus).

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recently purchased a cheap laptop in order to put linux onto it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Problem is it's only got a 520mb hdd and no cd.  I do have a xircom
10mb
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PCMCIA card that works under dos, but I decided I'd learn more by
doing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an installation over a null modem cable using pppd and then smb
shares
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a windows machine with the cd.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  I have been playing around with this, and read the serial how to,
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also the modem how to, but they dont go into much detail about how
it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; works with NO modem.  What I need too know is what, for my purposes,
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a good getty to use, and also what the best way for the linux
machine to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense an incoming connection is - since there is no connect string
(do
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you set it to wait for an enter, or is there another way?).
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; A null modem cable is VERY slow. In my experiance it seems to transfer
1MB
&gt; &gt; &gt; in about 30minutes. Try using a null printer cable. (same as a null
modem
&gt; &gt; &gt; cable just uses the printer port and can transfer 1MB in about 3
minutes)
&gt;
&gt; Ive been getting 20k/s with laplink 5 under dos, but thats using the
&gt; hardware flow control lines too send data as well under dos. I dont
&gt; really care about the speed, i'll leave it over night, I just want too
&gt; learn how too do it.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The PLIP howto will help you work out how to set one of these cables
up.
&gt;
&gt; I'll take a look..
