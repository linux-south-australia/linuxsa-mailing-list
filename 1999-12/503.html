Seasons Greetings to all.... just bought myself an IBM 486dx4/100
Thinkpad_370C Notebook with 20Mb RAM, 770Mb hdd & a couple of pcmcia
ethernet devices (and NO CDROM ;(  ). Sole purpose of getting the device
was to split hdd in 2 & stick Linux (SuSE) on 1 partition & FreeBSD on
the other. Sheeeesh! 8 hours later I have finally achieved it!

There are a lot of these notebooks appearing on the market so thought I
would share my newly acquired knowledge with everybody.

Thinkpads have some wierd quirk (bug???) with the floppy drive & Linux
installs crash when you try & read the modules floppy to get pcmcia
ethernet up & running. I did a search on the net on installing Linux on
IBM Thinkpads and found the fix... you MUST add this option to the Lilo
boot prompt when the pc boots off the first floppy :

boot: linux floppy=thinkpad

After that everything was fine... found my pcmcia cards and then
installed via ftp over my network 

Next was FreeBSD - same problem..slightly different fix - even if you
use the PAO install disks for FreeBSD-3.3 (designed for
notebooks/laptops - available on the net - dont come with the distro) it
will boot up fine until you hit the first "graphical" page then the
keyboard locks bigtime. Fix is to set the flag 0x2 in the config options
screen for atkbd0.

Next problem is XWindows - on both Linux & FBSD I could not get X to
start - running SuperProbe told me that I only had an MCGA Video Adapter
with no ram - in reality its a wd-something with 1mb video ram & runs
very well in 640x480 8bit (16 would be nicer :))  I finally located an
XF86Config built for the Thinkpad-370c which worked brilliantly for both
Linux & FreeBSD.

Conclusions:

1. The price of $450 was GOOD (at least its good for Mt Gambier!)
2. ONCE you get Linux &/or FBSD installed on the thing it goes like a
rocket
3. Both LINUX & FBSD both Support nearly all PCMCIA Cards these days.
4. Both Linux & FBSD installed relatively easily across the network -
Linux works with both NFS & FTP whereas I could not get FBSD to use ftp
to install so had to run NFS which IS much slower!
Anyway, hope this is of interest/help to someone.

Have a Merry Christmas/Happy Millenium.

Phil
