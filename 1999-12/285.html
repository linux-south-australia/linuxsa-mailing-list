Subject: Re: NT and Linux user authentication


Hi,

&gt;  - I believe Samba can be a PDC, and therefore is able to authenticate
&gt;    username/password pairs from a windows 95/98 client.  Has anyone had
&gt;    real-life experience with this and had it working well?  I'm not after
&gt;    walk-throughs or anything, I'm just after a general feeling from
people.
&gt;

Yes. I have have done this with RedHat 6.0 without too many dramas (there's
a
few features I'd like, but hey).

&gt;
&gt;  - If Samba/PDC *does* work well, I'd love to be able to just duplicate
the
&gt;    bloody user database from Windows NT and dump the whole lot into my
&gt;    Linux user account database.  I can't have everyone having to re-enter
&gt;    their passwords etc, and I don't want to manually duplicate the
accounts.
&gt;
&gt;    Can you do it?

There is a utility called pwdump, which will create a samba password file
from
an NT SAM. try <A HREF="http://www.samba.org/">http://www.samba.org/</A>

&gt;
&gt;  - I've seen a PAM module called pam_ntdom.  Now *that* is really what
would
&gt;    be the most useful for me for the immediate future - it is /supposed/
to
&gt;    authenticate user logins using a Windows NT Domain Controller.
&gt;    Unfortunately, though, even after loads of discussion with the author,
I
&gt;    could *not* make it work correctly with my RedHat 6.0 system.  The
author
&gt;    gave up on me :(
&gt;
&gt;    Has anyone heard of anything similar?  Or in fact had pam_ntdom
working?
&gt;

Never tried, sorry

&gt;
&gt; The main problem is the whole authentication thing.  I want everyone to
have
&gt; access to email, but they don't all have Linux accounts.  If their NT
&gt; password changes, the Linux password has to be changed seperately.  Yuk.
&gt;

Have these lines in your smb.conf

Unix password sync = yes
passwd chat = [crud]
passwd program = /bin/passwd
encrypt passwords = yes
smbpasswd file = /etc/smbpasswd (the file created by pwdump)

the smb.conf manual page will help a lot. Also try reading the NT Domain
documentation / Encrypted password stuff in /usr/doc/samba-2.0.5a.

I have found the NT-DOM Samba mailing list more than helpful as well.

Good luck.

Matt

Oh yeah, you can also make your NT servers members of the Samba-controlled
domain. This is handy (and funny).
