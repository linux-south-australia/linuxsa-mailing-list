Damn but I wish this was true.  Regrettably, if I had a dollar for every
person who bought a copy of MS Windows I'd be about as rich as Bill Gates.
Even most real IT people just love Windows, or at the least they quietly
compromise any dislike they may feel for it and embrace the beast.

It's sad, but as far as I can see it's true, that the standard document
interchange format for word processing documents is Word 90-something; and
the standard interchange for spreadsheets is Excel; and I suppose
Powerpoint is the standard format for slide shows.

Well what are the alternatives?  Word Perfect?  Probably you'd get worse
results than if you just used Word.  RTF?  Not bad, I'm surprised this
hasn't taken off more.  WordStar?  Ha f-ing ha!  TeX?  Gxkquuca24.
PostScript? Actually, it's damn close to PDF, which seems to be about as
ubiquitous as MS Word, but of course that's for finished documents only.
It truly is very difficult to find a format, that isn't MS Word, that will
not embarrass you in front of most important clients.

HTML works almost adequately for word documents.  Obviously it's very basic
-- and I shall just say that CSS is not part of the answer, particularly as
Microsoft own the patent on it.  To see an example of HTML as a serious
alternative to Word, I refer you to <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/dhcpdNT/doc.">http://www.tellurian.com.au/dhcpdNT/doc.</A>

HTML is ubiquitous, even more so that MS anything; it's basic but often you
can live with less than fine control over layout.  It's a standard; okay,
it's many standards, but there is an acceptable (to me) tradeoff between
least common denominator and function.

I don't know what the answer is for spreadsheets, but it does for word
processing, and I think it does for presentations.
