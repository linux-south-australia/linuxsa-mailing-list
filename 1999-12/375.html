Hi Guys,
    As the owner of a Telstra Big Pond Permanent Connection,
I have been reading this discussion with interest, but I
think I should clear up a few discrepancies and half truths
that I have seen bandied around. O.K. here goes :

Background :
My business partner and I am in the process of setting up a
small business with the intention of setting up a permanent
Internet based Retail Outlet. I live in Adelaide, and my
partner lives near Gawler, but both of us want Internet
access (ie Mail, News, Web etc). Gawler will mean STD dial
up rates, and we want to set up a permanent web site ASAP.
There may be cheaper options, but we chose a Telstra
Permanent Connection, and went live in August. This is what
it costs to set up and run at present 1 Linux server with a
permanent connection and a small network hanging off it, and
1 remote dial in for my partner.

Costs for set up $500 for Telstra Connection : 1 off cost.
Costs for 2 Lines 1 in and 1 out $175 (first line) + 128
(each subsequent line).
Costs for .com.au Domain Name Registration $125 for 2 years
Costs for Business Name Registration $105 for 3 years

Monthly costs:
$20 Telstra Connection - this INCLUDES first 100Mb data
(approx), and then charged at 19c/Mb. This is modified if my
Download:Upload ratio is better than 1:2.75, ie for each 1
Mb I Download, I Upload 2.75 Mb, in which case the data
charge drops to 9c/Mb. In English, if I Upload 550 Mb, then
I get 200 Mb for my $20 per month. It still costs me $20,
but if I maintain 1:2.75 ratio, I don't pay any extra for
extra data. Basically any pure web site will get the ratio,
and so Mail and news for the user should be "free".  In my
experience, I don't yet have the web site up yet, but I
broke the 100 Mb barrier once when I was updating a heap of
software and downloading source and patches (170 Mb that
month), but with normal usage I (and my single dial in user)
normally use about 70 Mb per month. Any excess data charges
are split proportionately.

Telstra phone line charges : $23.30 for 2 lines / month
Telstra phone call charges: about $1 / month. The only catch
with Telstra is that from time to time, they kick you off
your line. Their excuse is it will happen about every 72
hours for "technical reasons". My experience is that on
average once per week in a bad month I have to redial, but
it doesn't happen excessively.

On Telstra connections, Telstra will only Guarantee 33.6K
Connections, however they are in the process of Upgrading
their service to 56K connections. I don't think I have got a
connection slower than 56K yet (touchwood). I am also in the
process of setting up my second line to run Fax software
concurrently with the Dial in, and so I also effectively
have a Fax too.

In summary, it costs me $45 per month after initial setup
costs to run a permanent connection with a dial in and a
fax. My partner pays $25 per month for unlimited access and
any excess data charges we incur, he also pays for his own
phone charges (STD call from Gawler). I pay the other $20
per month for an unlimited access. The first 100Mb is
"free", and then 19c/Mb. There are no other ongoing charges.
Even with normal usage we don't incur any excess data
charges. If we compare ISP prices, we would average in
excess of 10 Hours a week between us, and so over a month it
costs us less than $1 per hour to use, which is competitive
with many ISPs (especially if you take into account the call
charges).

Some Linux people already have a system like this set up,
and by asking around at meetings, which is how I made my
final decision, the initial setup cost is a bit steep for
low usage, but a permanent site becomes very economical for
higher usage levels, especially if your next door neighbour
wants to throw an ethernet cable over the back fence and
share the costs (which no one would do because it is
apparently illegal), or you want to do what I do and act as
a limited ISP (ie just a few friends) and share the costs.

Overall I am happy with my set up. Telstra stuffed me around
with the additional Phone line installs, but the system side
of things was good. They gave me all the dial in scripts and
LIMITED help information, but thanks to Tim Aslat at OzTek,
we got the system going in less than a week. Domain Name
Registration was a bit of a problem, but they have some
funny ideas in Melbourne. The thing that suprised me was
that the Big Pond people were quite helpful. I rang up and
asked about IP addresses for a 5 machine network and they
said ask for 64, which I did, and I received, but I get the
feeling if I had asked for a full class C address range,
they would have given it to me no problem. I hope this has
clarified things a bit for people out there. I would
recommend a permanent connection. Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I apologize in advance since this is not strictly a linux
issue.  I am
&gt;currently looking for a good Internet Service Provider for
home in the
&gt;Adelaide metropolitan area, where price is not necessarily
the only
&gt;selection factor.  Any suggestions ?
&gt;
