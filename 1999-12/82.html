Star Office users:

About a week ago, I decided to take courage and buy a laptop,
stick linux on it, and accept the risk that I'll be embarrassed
by some lack of MS functionality in the linux
software mega-klump. 
Now I'm wondering if I am after all going to regret this.

Specifically, I wanted to create and show Powerpoint-like
slides, _and_ be able to give other people copies of the slides
after showing them. This is a normal kind of activity in the
IT R&D world.

Well, I've found that every time I save a Powerpoint 97 format
file (*.ppt) in Star Office and read it in again, the lines
in bullet items (the most important thing that presentation
slides must be able to do!) get closer each time.
Eventually the spacing between lines of a multi-line bullet item
shrink to about 1/4 of a line -- so that they are unreadable.

Since bullet items are literally the most important kind of
graphical object in ppt slides, I am stunned that Star Office
and/or Sun Microsystems could release software with
this serious bug.
Trouble is, it isn't open source. So it's not likely
to get fixed in a hurry. 
(I downloaded my copy a few days ago from Sun's site.)

Q1:
Has anyone else found this problem with Star Office under linux,
saving files in ppt 97 format?

Q2:
Does anyone know how to work around this bug?

By the way, I also find that SO displays MW-word 97 format files
incorrectly on screen (e.g. quote marks seem not to show),
although they seem to print out okay.
So has lots of other quirks also.

Conclusion:
In an international trip meeting people in the IT R&D area
in the next few weeks, I'm going to have to say such things as:
"Sorry, I've got linux" and/or
"Sorry, I've got Star Office".
Admittedly, SO is not linux's fault.
But linux can't take over from MS until linux acquires software
which can do a better job at reading/writing MS format files.

SO seems to work okay with its native SO formats, I think.

I should also mention that I tried to find MS-format read/write
(import/export) capabilites in software like Applix and a couple of
other office things under linux - but no luck....

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS.  Many thanks to those who helped with my previous problems.
It turns out (thanks to Martin Sheppard) that the file /etc/pam.d/other
under RH 5.2 prevents OpenSSH from working, and this file needs
to be modified. Pretty obvious really.... (not).

PPS.
The recent electricity failures in Adelaide caused two out of
my three linux machines to fail to re-boot due to
file-system damage requiring super-user fsck rescue.
I was in the Flinders Ranges at the time. so this caused
24 hours of disconnection from the net.
My SunOS 4.1.3 system came through unscathed after the two
power-loss/reboot cycles.
Methinks linux needs to acquire better default file systems
to be able to weather such storms. Not everyone can be expected
to get a UPS unit.
If BSD has the sort of file system that (almost) always
recovers nicely from sudden power failures, then maybe
BSD is for me. Any offers of advice on this?
