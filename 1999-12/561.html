&gt; I have noticied a meta character named file in the root's home directory 
&gt; and another user's home directory. They were created on December 23rd. 
&gt; The file ownership permissions are perfectly normal. The dreaded 
&gt; meta-character is '*'.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know how this file got created. What is the best way to trace 
&gt; the creation of such files? I want to know the process that is creating 
&gt; it. External login is impossible to this box. It has to be one of the 
&gt; several tools I have downloaded and compiled.  How do you search for 
&gt; files, with meta characters as their names?

The trick to understanding this is that you the meta characters you are
talking about are *shell* meta-characters.  The *, ?, ' and so on are
all interpreted by the shell *before* they get to the program in question.
(Note this is only valid at the shell prompt).

Once you remove the shell from the picture (say be in an editor or 
something), if the shell-metacharacter is not understood by the application
as having special meaning, it will treat it as a standard character.

So what you may have done is saved a document as * under vi or someother
editor.

To remove (and create) in the shell it is as simple escaping the character
in question.

	rm \* 
	rm \?

and so on.  The other ways people have suggested do pretty much the same
thing and in some cases works a bit more reliably.

On a similar vein, you can create files that like '-rf *' which when a
naive user tries to remove them they unknowingly do a 'rm -rf *'.  Which
causes the obvious problems.

Regards,

Matt
