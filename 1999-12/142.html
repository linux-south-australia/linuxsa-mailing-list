Hi,

&gt; &gt; Cool, I thought I was the only one who'd ever seen this problem. I had a
&gt; &gt; problem with a legend computer with exactly this problem. It seems to be
&gt; &gt; in the BIOS. Solution, replace the BIOS, replace the motherboard, or if
&gt; &gt; you must boot on november 13th, press DELETE, reset the date to November
&gt; &gt; 14th, boot then reset back once it is booted. Was this a Legend brand PC ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; While we don't know what machine this board originally resided in I
&gt; would almost be prepared to bet that it was the same board. 
&gt; 
&gt; Further tests reveal that replacing the BIOS chip stops the behaviour.
&gt; Obviously the tune resides in the BIOS chip. Place the BIOS chip in
&gt; another identical board and it functions normally. i.e. no tune. If
&gt; someone can read this chip and would like to have a go at decoding it I
&gt; sure it can be arranged.

Sorry I can't help there. Its interesting that combo MB and BIOS work
together. Almost sounds like a disgruntled employee or something.

&gt; 
&gt; The BIOS is an AMI BIOS 1993, version AB.

I dug out our MB, the BIOS is the same make and year. Model number on the
MB is SJ-DG486/3VLS I'm guessing the Chipset has something to do with it,
if it works in another MB. I had actually tried another BIOS in, but the
BIOS didn't work. Probably wasn't similar enough.

&gt; Why did you resign from the human race? I simply stopped running.

More dramatic statment :)

cya
