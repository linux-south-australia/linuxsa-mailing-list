&gt; This is something the Linux community will have to address if
&gt; they want Linux to move to the desktop.

The thing I find interesting about comments like this is the attitude
that the "Linux Community", especially Commerical Linux support
companies, have certain obligations so that Linux will be "accepted by
the MS Windows community".

How about looking at the situation from the point of view of a group
of people, we'll call them "the linux commiunity" who have been
happily _not_ using any Microsoft products for many years, and instead
use a cheaper, faster and better OS called Linux. Now this community,
in the spirit of free software, makes available its collective
knowledge to anyone who cares to use it, (with a few minor rules like
not asking often repeated questions and not expecting someone else to
do all the work for you).

If someone then tells them that the OS they use is hard to install for
windows users, and that there are certain obligations that the
user community must fill to change this fact, then some of them may do
this, but others may say "so what, it works for me".

The only loser in this situation is the Windows user cause they are
still stuck using Windows, which they know to be inferior otherwise
they wouldn't have tried Linux.

Please don't take this as a personal flame or anything, this is
addressed at anyone who's made that "is Linux ready for the desktop
market" comment. I'm just presenting an alternative viewpoint in which
linux users may answer that question with "Who cares!" They already
use Linux, they already get more from their computing experience than
windows users, and they may not be interested in whether or not their
OS of choice is "accepted". In other words "Keep using NT as much as
you like, as long as you do, I have a competitve edge."

Luckily this situation is almost never the case and the Linux
community as a whole will almost always offer help in situations where
it is nothing short of comercially silly to do so. No one gets paid.

It's just worth bearing in mind that it's not often the Linux
community clawing for acceptance and market share, it's the MS
community looking for an alternative. One of the great things about a
free product that is superior to its commercial alternative, is that
you don't have to market the fact. It suceeds automatically. 

&gt; I know everyone moans at MicroSoft, and so do I,

I don't! I don't use it!

&gt; but MS do at least try and maintain backwards compatibility.

And backwards compatibility is the main reason that MS windows is the
inferior product that it is. This is a whole (very interesting)
discussion in itself. I suggest a read of
<A HREF="http://www.ncworldmag.com/ncworld/ncw-06-1998/ncw-06-lastten.html">http://www.ncworldmag.com/ncworld/ncw-06-1998/ncw-06-lastten.html</A>
for an interesting discussion on the future of Windows and Microsoft.

In anycase, backward compatibility with kernel versions is very rarely
an issue, as you can just use the source to recompile against your
newer kernel and libraries.

&gt; Now I am aware of the problem, I will be more careful, but I thought
&gt; I would pass my experience to all.

And you are commended for doing that, espeically since no-one paid
you! :o)

Cheers

Alex!
