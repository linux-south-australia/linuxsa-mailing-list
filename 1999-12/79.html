People,

If people could take the following survey I am sure the author would be
very grateful.

&gt; Subject: Linux Users Group Article
&gt; Date: Fri, 03 Dec 1999 05:32:55 -0700
&gt; 
&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm writing an article on Linux User Groups for Linux Magazine and
&gt; I'm trying to get as  much feedback as possible from people who are
&gt; actually members of LUGs. If you could take the time to answer some of
&gt; these questions, I'd greatly appreciate it. If you'd like to pass the
&gt; questions on to other members of your group that would be helpful as
&gt; well. If there are questions I've missed asking, or comments that you
&gt; want to add, please feel free to do so.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; When was your LUG founded?
&gt; 
&gt; When did you attend your first meeting?
&gt; 
&gt; What is your role in the group? (Officer, member at large?)
&gt; 
&gt; How has your user group contributed to your use of Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; Were you using Linux before you attended LUG meetings?
&gt; 
&gt; How much of Linux's popularity / success is related to Linux User Groups?
&gt; 
&gt; How many people attend on average?
&gt; 
&gt; Out of the people who attend your meetings, how many (percentage-wise)
&gt; are regulars, and how many are new each time?
&gt; 
&gt; How often do you have meetings?
&gt; 
&gt; What is a typical meeting like for your LUG? What type of activities,
&gt; speakers are typical? Is it formal, informal?
&gt; 
&gt; Has your LUG done any special activities (installfests, demo day) and
&gt; are there any that really stand out? If you have pictures available
&gt; of these events, please let me know -- we may want to publish them in
&gt; Linux Magazine.
&gt; 
&gt; How would you describe the "average" person in your LUG? (Yes, I know,
&gt; Linux Users aren't just "average," but what type of person makes up your
&gt; user group?)
&gt; 
&gt; Have you seen more or less interest in participating in a user group as
&gt; Linux becomes more popular?
&gt; 
&gt; Why do you personally use Linux?
&gt; 
&gt; Please include your name as you'd want to see it in print, your age,
&gt; where you live and the name of your Linux User Group. If you have photos
&gt; of meetings or special events that you think might be something we want
&gt; to include, please let me know where I can download them from.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thanks for your help!
&gt; 
&gt; Best,
&gt; 
&gt; Zonker
&gt;
