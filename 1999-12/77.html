Hi

I am not sure of the accuracy of this, but maybe is=20
something you may wish to act upon.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please read the following carefully if you intend to
stay online and continue using email:  The last few
months have revealed an alarming trend in the
Government of the United States attempting to quietly
push through legislation  that will affect your use of
the Internet. Under proposed legislation  the U.S.
Postal Service will be attempting to bilk email users
out of "alternate postage fees". Bill 602P will permit
the Federal Govt to charge a 5 cent surcharge  on
every email delivered, by billing Internet Service
Providers at  source. The consumer would then be
billed in turn by the ISP. Washington D.C. lawyer
Richard Stepp is
working without pay to prevent this legislation from
becoming law. The U.S. Postal Service is claiming that
lost revenue due to the proliferation of email is
costing nearly $230,000,000 in revenue per year. You
may have noticed their recent ad campaign "There is
nothing like a letter". Since the average citizen
received about 10 pieces of email per day in 1998, the
cost to the typical individual would  be an additional
50 cents per day, or over $180 dollars per year, above
and beyond their regular Internet costs. Note that
this would be money paid directly to the U.S. Postal
Service for a service they do not even provide. The
whole point of the Internet is democracy and
non-interference. If the federal government is
permitted to tamper with our
liberties by adding a surcharge to email, who knows
where it will end. You are already paying an
exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic
efficiency. It currently takes up to 6 days for a
letter to be
delivered from New York to Buffalo. If the U.S. Postal
Service is allowed to tinker with email, it will mark
the end of the "free" Internet in the United States.
One congressman, Tony Schnell (r) has even suggested a
"twenty to forty dollar per month surcharge on all
Internet service" above and beyond the government's
proposed email charges. Note that most of the major
newspapers have ignored the story, the only exception
being the Washingtonian which called the idea of email
surcharge "a useful concept who's time has come"
March 6th 1999 Editorial) Don't sit by and watch your
freedoms erode away!

Send this email to all Americans on your list and tell
your friends and relatives to write to their
congressman and say "No!" to Bill 602P.  Kate Turner
Assistant to Richard Stepp, Berger, Stepp and Gorman
Attorneys at Law 216 Concorde Street, Vienna, Va.

PS.....The US Postal Service is privately owned, like the
          Federal Reserve end the IMF..... Not Govt owned
          as most people believe.
