&gt; 1. I have a ISA Dynalink Internal modem
&gt; I have altered the Bios to set this card up as ISA
&gt; I have run isapnp dumped it to etc/isapnp.conf and ended up with a heap
&gt; of options
&gt; In W98 it setup as (IRQ 11) ( IO 03e8h-03e8h)
&gt; so I Unhashed the appropriate options and got a conflict , tried all the
&gt; other option and either got a conflict or denied access I rehashed the
&gt; (IO) option and it sets up on IRQ 11
&gt; QUESTION Do I need the (IO) set here or not?

Since you mention it's an Isa modem I'll assume it's not a winmodem (A
modem which makes the cpu do the work and the drivers specifications are
so secret that there is no drivers available for linux). You shouldn't
need to worry about an IO. 3e8 is normally com 3 under dos/windows. Which
would be /dev/ttyS2 under Linux.

Have you tried setting the IRQ using: setserial 

&gt; 2. I have a cmi8330 onboard sound system which I am having problems
&gt; setting up In part it relates to the above as isapnp dumps the settings
&gt; for this when I was trying to set up the modem.
&gt; I chose the following options

Since you have a 2.2 kernel have a look in:
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sound/CMI8330 

It has an isapnp setup for you and instructions on how to get the sound
working.

&gt; 4. While meandering through files trying to find more relevant
&gt; information on the above I found /proc/pci listing 6 devices 2 of which
&gt; are registered as unknown devices. Does this mean I need to modify the
&gt; system to work properly with these devices or are they identified
&gt; elsewhere. I think judging from the names given (acer Labs) they are
&gt; system parts of the Alladin M/B. Anyway I included the portion of
&gt; proc/pci file as Appendix D below.
&gt; Actually a few of the settings I expected in the following files i.e.
&gt; printer on IRQ 7 dont appear to be present .

The 2.2 kernels by default don't use an irq for the printer port. They use
what is known as a polling mode. This is a bit slower printing but it
reduces a lot of overhead for the rest of the system. You can turn on the
irq but adding a line like: options parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7
to /etc/conf.modules

&gt; 5. I have a smaller system  that I would like to set up for the kids I
&gt; am looking for a small Linux system to set up on it but Redhat/Mandrake
&gt; is far to big for the HDD and when the cut down xwindows is applied far
&gt; to slow on 4 mg is there a smaller version using RPMs as I would like it
&gt; to be compatable or at least similar to set up. Any Ideas or Sites to
&gt; pick up these from would be appreciated.Or the basic list of Rpms
&gt; required to put together my own small system if necessary


&gt; Appendix A    (IO ports   /proc/ioports)
&gt; 02f8 - 02ff    serial (auto) com2
&gt; 03c0 - 03df    vga +
&gt; 03f6 - 03f6    ide 0
&gt; 03f8 - 03ff    serial (auto) com1

Hmm, since 3e8 is not listed I am begining to suspect your modem is a
winmodem. Is it a 56k? if so it probably is.

&gt; APPENDIX D (/proc/pci) 
I agree with you. These are different things on your motherboard.

I must commend you. As someone who is new to Linux it is nice to see you
have really tried hard to solve your problems yourself before asking the
list.  Keep up the good work :)

Cheers,
