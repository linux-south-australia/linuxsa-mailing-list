&gt; After reading what you guys wrote about permanent connections, I
&gt; thought I'd ask my ISP (BOLDWeb - bold.net.au) what, if anything, they
&gt; could come up with that would suit me. The following two options are
&gt; what they came up with:
&gt;
&gt; 1)     Line rental: $25/month + $40/month + 22c/Meg
&gt;        "total cost": $65.00 plus data.
&gt;        $100 = 159 Meg/month (5.22 Meg/day average)
&gt;
&gt; And the option I've chosen:
&gt;
&gt; 2)     Line rental: $25/month + $60/month (to 150 Meg) + 22c/Meg
&gt;        "total cost": $85.00 (to 150Meg) + data.
&gt;        $100 = 218.2 Meg/month (7.17 Meg/day average)
&gt;
&gt; Benefit: A permamnet (live) IP number.
Actully to me sounds quite expensive.

Consider $85 a month for 12 months alone not including download costs is
$1020 dollars.
Even with the first $500 fee (which is a once only) and to download the data
of 150meg a month for 12 months which you get with the second option (at
19cents a meg on telstra (or 13 from there squid cache), would cost you a
extra $342 thats still $178 dollars less then your yearly cost for option
2.(plus any other data you download will be cheaper.)

$100 = 526meg a month

Option 1 is $65 a motnh for 12 months = $780
once off fee on telstra is $500, if you dont download more then $20 that all
you get charged a month else its 19cents a meg.

A few questions how much are extra ips/are they avalible ? are any ports
blocked ?
Is it a 56k or 36.6k connection ?

Is reverse mapping of dns for the ips avalible form a web page ? or routing
avalible from a web page ?
As far as i last knew extra ips didnt cost anything with telstra (and
routing and reverse mapping of dns are avalible from a web page so no
customer tech support contact is involved)

gets off soap box.
and no i dont work for telstra i generaly think there very evil.

But ive been looking at perm connections for about 6 months, and mos teither
wont give you extra ips without charging you money, for reverse mapping (eg
so you apear as your.domain.somthing) instead of you.isp.somthing), your
have to ring them or fax then lists which then takes them time to process or
they have ports blocked (eg you cant run a web server on your machine that
is publicaly accessable outside your network.
