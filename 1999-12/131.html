&gt; &gt; The correct line you should be using is
&gt; &gt; "Sorry, you've got Windows" and/or
&gt; &gt; "Sorry, you've got Office"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you're working with _real_ IT people they will either already be
&gt; &gt; exposuing the wonders of open source/standards, or at least be
&gt; &gt; genuinely interested in an alternative to the crud they are using at
&gt; &gt; the moment. If you must exchange information, you should be doing it
&gt; &gt; with the existing tools and protocols, in other words NOT powerpoint
&gt; &gt; binaries, and even NOT Staroffice or Applixware binaries.
&gt; 
&gt; aww come ON!
&gt; 
&gt; be real! I know of a large number of IT professionals in Adelaide who do
&gt; *not* frequent this list, and instead are as biased againt Linux as alot
&gt; are against MS. In fact, I think the comment I was told was, "Geez, it
&gt; slow - must be running on a Linux box"
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I'm not sure how serious this was, but it shows that there are
&gt; people on the other side of the fence, and they aren't looking this way.

So what if there are people "on the other side of the fence", it
doesn't mean I have to buy a copy of word.

This was not advice, this was an explanation of what I do in the same
situation. I do not and will not exchange information in microsoft
binaries, if you do not like that, then tough. I am in the lucky
position in the IT industry that I can say that, but many other people
are in the same position, they just don't realize it.

&gt; So I think - Grow up.

Grow up? Are you saying that I'm being childish? I appreciate your
comments and I'm happy to reply to them, but comments on my ability to
act my age, do nothing for your credibility. 

&gt; Realise that linux is not the all mighty industry standard yet, and
&gt; play nice with others.

I never said that it was? Now you are putting words in my mouth?

*directs attention to previous post*

Cheers,

Alex!
