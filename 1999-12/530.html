&gt;&gt;&gt; Would "delete non-DOS partition" help?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;No.. Dos fdisk cannot delete a 'non-DOS' linux partition resident on
&gt;/dev/hda5
&gt;&gt;it's simply an oversight in that program. The only way i know is to use linux
&gt;&gt;fdisk to remove that partition.
&gt;
&gt;Then I must have a most peculiar DOS or a peculiar fdisk.  I've used DOS
&gt;6.22 fdisk to do just what you say is not possible.  Or are you saying that
&gt;/dev/hda5 is ALWAYS an extended non-dos partition and that DOS fdisk cannot
&gt;delete EXTENDED non-dos partitions, only PRIMARY non-dos partitions?
&gt;If the latter, I'd be prepared to listen, though I still think you are
&gt;mistaken.

I suspect that this issue arrives depending on the type of partition
/dev/hda5 is (and there is no way it will be of a particular type, as you
can set Linux up so that the first primary partition on a drive is
/dev/hda5 if you want to). Every drive can have a maximum of 4 partitions,
being up to 4 primary partitions, or up to 3 primary partitions and one
extended partition. You can create many logical drive "partitions" inside
the extended partition.

However, you may have noticed that DOS fdisk won't let you create more than
one primary partition per drive. This is because things like DOS, Windows
9x, and Windows NT don't like more than on primary partition per drive -
they like everything else to be in logical drives in an extended partition
(thus the joys of trying to make Windows 9x/Windows NT dual-boot machines
without the wonderful feature of (primary) partition hiding provided with
products like Boot Magic).

So, if you use Linux, and create more than one primary partition on a
drive, which is perfectly acceptable, DOS fdisk is likely to have problems
accessing all the partitions correctly, and thus in removing it.

Cheers,
