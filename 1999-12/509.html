Subject: By opening this email you agree to the following......(Xmas
Greeting)


&gt;
&gt; Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit my best wishes for
&gt; an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low stress,
&gt; non-addictive, gender neutral, celebration of the summer solstice
&gt; holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the religious
&gt; persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice, with
&gt; respect for the religious/secular persuasions and/or traditions of
&gt; others, or their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions
&gt; at all...
&gt;
&gt; A N D
&gt;
&gt; A fiscally successful, personally fulfilling, and medically
&gt; uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted
&gt; calendar year 2000, but not without due respect for the calendars of
&gt; choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make
&gt; Australia great, (not to imply that Australia is necessarily greater than
&gt; any other country), and without regard to the race, creed, color, age,
&gt; physical ability,
&gt; religious faith, or sexual preference of the wishee.
&gt;
&gt; By accepting this greeting, you are accepting these terms. This greeting
&gt; is subject to clarification or withdrawal. It is freely transferable
&gt; with no alteration to the original greeting. It implies no promise by
&gt; the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for her/himself or
&gt; others, and is void where prohibited by law, and is revocable at the
&gt; sole discretion of the wisher.
&gt;
&gt; This wish is warranted to perform as expected within the usual
&gt; application of good tidings for a period of one year, or until the
&gt; issuance of a subsequent holiday greeting, whichever comes first, and
&gt; warranty is limited to replacement of this wish or issuance of a new
&gt; wish at the sole discretion of the wisher.
