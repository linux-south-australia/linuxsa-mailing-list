Hi,


&gt; A friend has a motherboard that insists on playing "Happy Birthday" if
&gt; it is booted on Nov 13th. He has stripped it down to just the M/B and a
&gt; video card but this annoying behaviour continues. The board is a VLB
&gt; with 16 Mb RAM 486DX2-66 with a 1993 AMI BIOS. The only markings, on the
&gt; reverse side, are 
&gt; SJ-DG 486/3VLS
&gt; Korea
&gt; 
&gt; On any day other than Nov 13 it will boot and run quite happily. Virus
&gt; checkers do not seem to find it and no damage seems to be done in any
&gt; case. 
&gt; Can anyone shed any light on this problem?
&gt; Where is it living and how can it be eradicated? 
&gt; We have tried to get the CMOS to reset but this has no effect.
&gt; 
&gt; This is not really off topic. The intention was to use the board to run
&gt; a Linux Server.

Cool, I thought I was the only one who'd ever seen this problem. I had a
problem with a legend computer with exactly this problem. It seems to be
in the BIOS. Solution, replace the BIOS, replace the motherboard, or if
you must boot on november 13th, press DELETE, reset the date to November
14th, boot then reset back once it is booted. Was this a Legend brand PC ?

cya
