Thanks Matt, I didn't, because I don't have access to an NT machine. I did
follow the instructions of another SA-Linux member (sorry forgot name and
lost email), to look at the /proc/interrupts, /proc/ioports and /proc/dma.
This told me all I neede to know about the IOs, IRQs and DMAs for the MSS
and MPU.
I had to edit the /etc/isapnp.conf file because sndconfig would not let me
set the MSS' IRQ to 11, it wasn't an option. Then something strange
happened. On trying to run sndconfig again, it could not open /dev/audio.
On doing a ls -l on /dev/audio the file type is reported to be 'c' or a
character special file, whereas I was expecting it to be a block special
file.

Does anyone know how I would have done this, and more importantly what can I
do to remedy it?

thanks everyone,
=)      Nic

&gt;Did you grab that NTHQ thing off my server? It's one of those magic (free)
&gt;disks that I keep. <A HREF="http://alpha.xavier.sa.edu.au/download/NTHQ/">http://alpha.xavier.sa.edu.au/download/NTHQ/</A> *
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Was Linux easier or harder to set up before plug - n - play???
&gt;
&gt;Easier, because you had jumpers for a start. You could tell Linux to use
&gt;set addresses and it would. Plug and Pray was good in theory....
&gt;
&gt;Also a lot of vendors appear to have mixed up Windows 95 compliance with
&gt;Plug and Pray.
&gt;
&gt;Matt
&gt;
&gt;P.S. If you continue to have real troubles, try booting a Microsoft OS on
&gt;the machine and configure it with the drivers that it should have arrived
&gt;with. Assuming it's not one of those Generic PCI Windows Driver sound
&gt;cards. A friend of mine have his machine boot DOS 7 (Win95 without the GUI)
&gt;and configure the Sound Card in the Config.sys. A line at the end of
&gt;autoexec.bat ran loadlin and Linux worked fine with sound.
&gt;

Matt, would it be possible to ellaborate on the autoexec.bat solution?
thanks
