&gt;Hello people,

&gt;My friend tried to install RH6.0 on his brand new PC. Installation fails
&gt;to find his hard disk. When going to partition HDD it says something
&gt;like "No hard disks". He's got 4 ports for hdd?! Mboard manual says 2
&gt;are 33 and other 2 are 66 something? So he connected his drive to 66
&gt;which supposed to be faster. I don't know what it is all about, just
&gt;want to know if someone has an idea or had same prob before, let me know
&gt;where can I read about it. Or if it's a simple solution some
&gt;instructions would be helpfull too.

Three simple solutions:
1. Check that the data tape cable is properly connected at the motherboard
AND the HD.  Especially check that the cable is connected such that the red
(or blue) edge is at position #1 on the drive (NOT #40). Check that the
power cable to the HD is properly connected. If possible, connect to a
known good power connection.  Try again to see if the HD is now recognised.
 If it IS:-
2. Use Partition Magic to partition the drive the way you want. Advantage
is that PM might give you a clue if anything is wrong after (1). SFAIK it
doesn't matter whether you leave the space reserved for Linux as free space
or format it as ext2. You WILL need to make a further small partition (100M
or so) formatted as Linux Swap.
3. Use DOS fdisk to partition the drive, leaving the spaces reserved for
Linux and its swap file, empty and unformatted.

You said something about Windoze works OK on that drive.  Are you trying to
install RH onto a fully-formatted WinDOS disk?  That won't work.  The error
message might be indicating that there is nowhere free for RH to go.
There are distros which let you install Linux to a DOS directory.  RH isn't
one of them.

BiBi,
Brian
