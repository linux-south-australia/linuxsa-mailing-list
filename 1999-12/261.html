I've said it once, and I'll say it again.

Grow up.

You're in danger of making yourself look like an idiot.

You said yourself:
" One of the great things about a
 free product that is superior to its commercial alternative, is that
 you don't have to market the fact. It suceeds automatically. "

so whats the point of your message?


Lets turn this around. You've just descovered that you can breath under
water. You dont need air at all. Whats more, you've found that living
under water is so much better. In fact, its so much better, you switch
to living under water permenantly. No tell me, are you going to ignore
the ability to breath air? No!  Because there are still 4 billion people
who still breath air. 

My point is, sprouting shit off is not productive. 


this comment:

" Now this community,
 in the spirit of free software, makes available its collective
 knowledge to anyone who cares to use it, "

and this one:

" I'm just presenting an alternative viewpoint in which
 linux users may answer that question with "Who cares!" "


are diametrically opposite.
