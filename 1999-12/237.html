&gt; Unfortunately, there is one little minor problem that needs to be spelled

Let's be fair.  The problem was simply due to attempting a
close coexistence with Windows whilst chopping and changing Linux
distributions.  This sort of operating system mixing is never conducive
to stability and always buys problems that the bulk of people who follow
a more conventional course never meet.

If you walk on the edge, you have to expect to slip further than
someone walking on the plains.

&gt; This is something the Linux community will have to address if
&gt; they want Linux to move to the desktop.

Not at all.  The point of desktop Linux is to run a capable
and cheap operating system.  The major issues are consistency
of user experience, stabilty, performance, and cost of ownership.
Using Windows as an expensive boot loader doesn't help the "cost
of ownership" case, so a desktop Linux is very unlikely to
use LOADLIN.

LILO copes with multiple kernel versions just fine.  I can
boot into three kernel versions on this machine.  The big
version jumps (2.0 --&gt; 2.2) tend to be one-way, as the
ancillary programs tend to be tied to major Linux versions.
