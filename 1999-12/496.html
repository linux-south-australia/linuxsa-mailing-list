I recently purchased a cheap laptop in order to put linux onto it. 
Problem is it's only got a 520mb hdd and no cd.  I do have a xircom 10mb
PCMCIA card that works under dos, but I decided I'd learn more by doing
an installation over a null modem cable using pppd and then smb shares
to a windows machine with the cd. 
 I have been playing around with this, and read the serial how to, and
also the modem how to, but they dont go into much detail about how it
works with NO modem.  What I need too know is what, for my purposes, is
a good getty to use, and also what the best way for the linux machine to
sense an incoming connection is - since there is no connect string (do
you set it to wait for an enter, or is there another way?).  

Another problem I hit was that keys were doing wierd things.  Eg I'd
type the login name, hit enter, and then the link would stop, or it'd as
me the login name again.  Wierd stuff anyway - it works enough for me
too know the baud etc is correct, but I am unsure what else is going
on.  I was using mingetty and also uugetty for this.  Is there any other
linux -&gt; dos translation needed, or do I just need too use another getty
with a correct config?

Also has anyone done this who can recommend a dos program for the tcp/ip
stack etc on the dos side? (for when Im running dos and want too telnet
into the linux box.

I presume for the linux install I'd need too custom make a boot disk
with the pppd on it, and samba, but i'll cross that hurdle when I come
too it.
