&gt; Hi. I have been given a (10 year old) SUN workstation (with 21 inch

&gt; Kevin, if you have a SCSI connector on the back of the station why don't
&gt; you try and locate and old/secondhand external SCSI CDROM Drive.
&gt; They are few and fair between but reasonably cheap. From there install
&gt; a copy of Linux for sparc or what ever operating system is made for
&gt; the workstation you have.


To do this, you will need to find a CDROM that allows you
to set the Block Size to 512bytes instead of the now standard
2048bytes.

The Older sparc's will only boto from a 512byte block CDROM.

I have a Sparc SLC, with 16mb at home running OpenBSD 2.5 quite nicely.
and I used to have a Sparc Station 5 with 64M running SparcLinux (Redhet 4.2)
it was _very_ much faster than running Solaris on the box.

As for the booting from tape, you've obviously figured out that you can
use "stop a" to get a prom prompt on boot, and then type 'boot tape'
I'm unsure how to get into the install from there, normally it should
proceed into the setup or at least run a script and ask questions.

Although I've never had to install SunOS from tape. Which I assume is
what you have there..

Personally, I'd recommend saving yourself the headaches, and get SparcLinux or OpenBSD/NetBSD
whichever is your fancy. It'll be more fun :)

Am I right in thinking the IPX a BW console ?   

Cheers,
