&gt; Rip off 'eh? Most ISP's I have looked at for Permanent
&gt; connections charge at
&gt; least $500 for permanent modem connectivity, in fact Chariot
&gt; charge $500 for
&gt; &lt;=33.6 and $1000 for 56K (the same for ISDN).
&gt;
&gt; Option 1 of 19/c says Upto 64Kbps in the header of the table.

I've found that most, if not all, ISPs charge similar prices for initial
setup fees. I think this may just be a case of follow the leader (why make a
smaller profit on purpose?). I understand that they also need to do various
things on their end, but generally, when people get a connection, they stick
around for a while, so why not let people be able to afford the connection
in the first place?

Things I think they need to do:
buy a 33.6k modem - since it's old technology, it's not that expensive. They
probably have spares lieing around anyway.
set up the receiving end so I get the same IP every time i connect - This
takes what? about 2 or 3 lines at most in various config files?
add my username and password to the receiving end - oooohhhh.. that's tough!
get another phone line? - in my opinion it's unlikely as they've probably
got a whole heap of lines physically installed already, so all they need to
do is call their phone company and ask them to connect it.
Pay someone to do all this - The above takes connectiong a serial cable, 5
minutes at a computer and one phone call, it can't take that long. How much
does this person earn/hr?

This leaves me with one last thought - insurance/loyalty. Since it costs so
much to set up (and change services), they want us to stick around and they
make that happen by making us not want to change providers. We PAY (money)
to be loyal. Doesn't seem right to me.

I see the problem being the backbones. Why do they charge per meg? I don't
know if/what Telstra/Optus pay their internation links (MCI for the US?).
Living in Australia, we unfortunatly need big cables going under the water
to other countries. I'm sure the maintenance on the cable(s) from here to
the US is a lot, but I don't see more maintenance needed if we send more
data through them?

Now that I'm coming close to the end of the message, I want to apolagise for
this e-mail. I'm pissed off with the backbones, making every ISP in the
country have to increase their prices for them. Telstra made a $10 billion
profit the other year, didn't they? Can't they 'afford' to give better
prices to their customers? (51% of the money goes to the government to pay
for all those services the government tries to give, but Telstra is not the
only source of money). I'm not trying to flame anyone on this list, and
having read this mail, I shouldn't send it, but I'm in a bad mood. :P

Sorry,

Andy
