&gt; &gt; I have noticied a meta character named file in the root's home directory 
&gt; &gt; and another user's home directory. They were created on December 23rd. 
&gt; &gt; The file ownership permissions are perfectly normal. The dreaded 
&gt; &gt; meta-character is '*'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't know how this file got created. What is the best way to trace 
&gt; &gt; the creation of such files? I want to know the process that is creating 
&gt; &gt; it. External login is impossible to this box. It has to be one of the 
&gt; &gt; several tools I have downloaded and compiled.  How do you search for 
&gt; &gt; files, with meta characters as their names?
&gt; 
&gt; The trick to understanding this is that you the meta characters you are
&gt; talking about are *shell* meta-characters.  The *, ?, ' and so on are
&gt; all interpreted by the shell *before* they get to the program in question.
&gt; (Note this is only valid at the shell prompt).
&gt; 
&gt; Once you remove the shell from the picture (say be in an editor or 
&gt; something), if the shell-metacharacter is not understood by the application
&gt; as having special meaning, it will treat it as a standard character.
&gt; 
&gt; So what you may have done is saved a document as * under vi or someother
&gt; editor.
&gt; 
&gt; To remove (and create) in the shell it is as simple escaping the character
&gt; in question.
&gt; 
&gt; 	rm \* 
&gt; 	rm \?
&gt; 
&gt; and so on.  The other ways people have suggested do pretty much the same
&gt; thing and in some cases works a bit more reliably.
&gt; 
&gt; On a similar vein, you can create files that like '-rf *' which when a
&gt; naive user tries to remove them they unknowingly do a 'rm -rf *'.  Which
&gt; causes the obvious problems.
&gt; 

Thanks for the suggestions. When I am uncertain about the files to be deleted,
I prefer to use the '-i' option. That would atleast guarantee the safety of my
other files. I have learnt quite a bit too, regarding the various techniques to
delete the meta-character named files.

I guess it is time to implement the 'wastebasket' idea on linux users $HOME.

Thanks everyone.
