Dear All,

	I have finally solved my problems, thanks to a lot of help from many
people.  While I am a newbie at Linux, I have used in the past OS/9, a
Unix-like clone for 6809 and 68000 processors.  I am familiar with the
concepts of piping, redirection and foreground and background use.
Unfortunately, there is one little minor problem that needs to be spelled
out loud to newbies.   There is relatively little backwards compatibility
in Linux kernels.  This is where in fact I came to grief.

	I feel I should present my problem as a cautionary tale.  It all started
because I believed that one should not use LILO with a Win FAT32 drive.
Please see the HOWTOs for details.  (Also, I believe that Caldera and Red
Hat LILOs are not compatible with each other - if I am wrong, please let me
know).  In fact, I believe that one can use LILO with Win FAT32, but as a
newbie, I didn't know this.  I therefore started the LOADLIN technique.
This technique is well described in the HOWTOs and I refer the reader to
that.  The problem is, that you end up using a permanent version of the
kernel, which I now know is vmlinuz, as your boot kernel.  In future, it
should be easy enough to write a DOS batch file in DOS to take care of the
varying kernels, if you are so inclined.

	Having started off with Caldera ver 2.2, I then tried Red Hat ver 6.0 and
things became worse.  I then tried Caldera ver 2.3, only to discover that
it was a one session wonder, as I now realise it was booting for the first
time off of the CD-ROM and the next time I booted it booted off
vmlinuz-2.2.5.  This lead to subtle errors like being unable to mount
CD-ROMs the second and subsequent times and only being able to contact the
Internet once.

	Newbies need to learn this as a cautionary tale.  If you use the LOADLIN
method, be aware you need to change your batch files to take care of the
new kernels.  In other words,  there is very little backwards compatibility
in kernels.  This is something the Linux community will have to address if
they want Linux to move to the desktop.  I know everyone moans at
MicroSoft, and so do I, but MS do at least try and maintain backwards
compatibility.  Now I am aware of the problem, I will be more careful, but
I thought I would pass my experience to all.

	The major symptoms of the problem can be relatively subtle, so diagnosis
can be difficult.  It was only when an error message came up referring to
ver 2.2.5 that the penny dropped.

Cheers,   Rick
