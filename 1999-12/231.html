Generally speaking, this is a truly horrible way of doing mail.  There's
essentially no way of getting mail delivery right if you're using 
info in the headers to work out how to deliver it.

Consider what happens when you send mail through Australia Post.  The
letters you send usually have two destination addresses on them:  One
of them is at the top of the letter itself, where it's traditional to
write the name and address of the recipient;  the other one is on the 
front of the envelope.  There's no actual requirement that these addresses
bear any relationship to each other whatsoever:  The only address 
Australia Post uses when it's working out how to deliver the message is
the envelope address.

Internet email is the same:  The addresses you see in the mail headers
are there for your information only... They need not bear any relationship
at all to the addresses which are used for the actual delivery of the 
mail.  Bcc: lists and mailing lists are two mechanisms which cause the
headers to "lie" about the mail's destination, but there are other reasons
for it as well ("masquerading" firewalls, anonymous remailers, etc).

SMTP and ESMTP (the protocols used for delivering mail to an Internet
user) both have a method for specifying an "envelope address".  Also,
the protocols don't actually recognise headers at all;  when they send
mail, they transmit a sender envelope address, a recipient envelope
address, then a block of data which one *assumes* is a set of headers
followed by message text, but there's no strict requirement that that
assumption is an accurate one (just like Australia Post never assumes
that the letters contained within envelopes begin with the sender's
address, the recipient's address, and "Dear Sir/Madam").

When you channel all mail for a certain domain into a single mailbox
and then attempt to use the info in that mailbox to funnel the mail
to its end recipients, you lose the envelope information.  That's a
pity, because the envelope information is the only reliable method in
existance for determining who the mail should really be delivered to!

 &gt; I have asked this question before, but did not receive the
 &gt; answer that I was looking for.  Is thers any way of configuring
 &gt; the mail system to use the envelope headers to deduce where the
 &gt; mail was originally intended to end up, rather than simply
 &gt; looking at the to field?

Yup -- Ask your ISP about SMTP delivery:  You should be able to obtain
a service whereby the ISP queues the mail for you until you dial-in,
then attempts SMTP delivery.  SMTP preserves the envelope addresses
(it absolutely depends on them!), so you'll end up with reliable mail
delivery.

If you can't get that, try another ISP.  Fiddling around with software
on your own system to "solve" this problem will not work -- there will
always be failures.
 
Your situation is slightly better than some, actually:  At work we
have a couple of customers who have misconfigured MDaemon, such that
unrecognised destination addresses (like the ones you're complaining
about) get treated as mail which is supposed to be delivered externally,
so they punt it back up to our mail server.  Consider the problems you're
likely to get if, say, someone at those companies subscribes to a mailing
list without modifying the configuration of their mail software:  Mail
comes in saying "To: <A HREF="mailto:mailinglist@mailserver.somewhere.com">mailinglist@mailserver.somewhere.com</A>", their 
MDaemon says, "Hmm - That doesn't look like <A HREF="mailto:someuser@companyname.com.au">someuser@companyname.com.au</A>,
it must be one of our users trying to send outbound mail, so I'll 
send it upstream...", and, as a result, "<A HREF="mailto:mailinglist@mailserver.somewhere.c">mailinglist@mailserver.somewhere.c</A>om"
ends up recieving a copy of the message... which will then be redistributed
to all the mailing list recipients, which will cause the cycle to 
begin anew.  Any Internode customers on this list who wonder why they
sometimes receive multiple copies of our user bulletins now know the
answer (but we think we've fixed it for good now :-)
