&gt; I agree - floppies should not even be a "last resort". Maybe I'm just
&gt; unlucky, but generally in a box of 10 disks, one or more is bad to start
&gt; with, and the rest usually seem to fail to hold data for more than
&gt; rand()*42 minutes.
&gt;
&gt; I made a boot disk at home the other day, and was booting off it quite a
&gt; few times. By about the 8th boot in an hour, it started reporting data
&gt; errors. ;P
&gt; Either my magnetic personality is acting up, or else floppies are just
&gt; an technological dinosaur that deserves to die.
&gt;
&gt; Multi-session cdroms are the way to go. ;)
&gt; You can boot 'em, you can store a lot more data on 'em, they've got a
&gt; decent transfer rate, and when you don't want them anymore, you can even
&gt; use them as a frisbee or placemat etc.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've always found the concept of *backup-up* onto a floppy slightly
&gt; &gt; amusing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I trust floppys about as far as I can throw them, which is not ar
&gt; &gt; considering they always do that funny flippy-around thing in the air....

I have to agree: I have a nice pretty set of coasters (ex. backups). I really
hate spending money on hardware, but burners are very cheap compared to 18
months ago.
