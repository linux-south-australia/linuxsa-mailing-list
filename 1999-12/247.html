 &gt; &gt;Yup -- Ask your ISP about SMTP delivery:  You should be able to obtain
 &gt; &gt;a service whereby the ISP queues the mail for you until you dial-in,
 &gt; &gt;then attempts SMTP delivery.  SMTP preserves the envelope addresses
 &gt; &gt;(it absolutely depends on them!), so you'll end up with reliable mail
 &gt; &gt;delivery.
 &gt; 
 &gt; How does one set the above feature up?

Pretend you have a permanent link.

You'll need an SMTP server:  Sendmail, qmail, etc fit the bill admirably.
Configure it so that it understands what its internet domain name is 
(i.e.: set it up in exactly the same way that you'd set it up if you
had a permanent link).

You'll need a fixed IP address for your dialin;  That will probably have
been supplied as part of the SMTP delivery service.  Once again, this is
just like a permanent link.

You'll also need to modify your DNS info so that your machine is listed
as the most-preferred MX.  Again, this is the same as what you'd do if
you had a permanent link.  (are you getting the idea? :-)

To get your ISP to send the mail to you, there are two main methods:

  1.  Do nothing.  Some ISPs will automatically start delivering mail
      to dial-on-demand SMTP customers shortly after they login, which
      means that you'll be able to simply login, wait a short while, 
      and watch the mail come in;  or

  2.  Send an "ETRN" message to the ISP's mail server.  I have a program
      for UNIX boxen which will do that if anyone wants it (or, more to the 
      point, I have a program which can do lots of things, but can be 
      configured to send ETRN messages);  You basically say,
      "ETRN yourdomain.com.au" to the ISP's mail server to tell it t
      deliver any mail which ends in yourdomain.com.au.

The method you need to use will vary from ISP to ISP;  check with them
when you're setting it up.

Basically, the only part of the description above which differs from
what you'd do if you had a permanent link is the last step.  This 
makes it especially easy to deal with if you're not sure whether you need
a permanent link, so you're trying a dial-on-demand connection until
you work it out:  When you make your decision, you won't require any
reconfiguration for your email to use it optimally.
