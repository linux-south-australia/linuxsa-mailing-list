&gt;Star Office users:
&gt;
&gt;Specifically, I wanted to create and show Powerpoint-like
&gt;slides, _and_ be able to give other people copies of the slides
&gt;after showing them. This is a normal kind of activity in the
&gt;IT R&D world.
&gt;
&gt;Since bullet items are literally the most important kind of
&gt;graphical object in ppt slides, I am stunned that Star Office
&gt;and/or Sun Microsystems could release software with
&gt;this serious bug.
&gt;
&gt;Q1:
&gt;Has anyone else found this problem with Star Office under linux,
&gt;saving files in ppt 97 format?

Yes.

&gt;Q2:
&gt;Does anyone know how to work around this bug?

One thing that helps is using pp95 format instead.  The difference in
functionality between 95 & 97 is trivial, and SO seems to cope better with
the earlier version.

&gt;By the way, I also find that SO displays MW-word 97 format files
&gt;incorrectly on screen (e.g. quote marks seem not to show),
&gt;although they seem to print out okay.
&gt;So has lots of other quirks also.

Yup - the 97-SO functionality AIN'T 100% by any means,

&gt;Conclusion:
&gt;But linux can't take over from MS until linux acquires software
&gt;which can do a better job at reading/writing MS format files.

Not sure this is sound logic, bearing in mind that:
&gt;SO seems to work okay with its native SO formats, I think.

If so - why use M$ at all?

&gt;I should also mention that I tried to find MS-format read/write
&gt;(import/export) capabilites in software like Applix and a couple of
&gt;other office things under linux - but no luck....

For WP Wordperfect8 works just fine.  Can't help you with a Presentation
equivalent, I'm afraid.

Brian
