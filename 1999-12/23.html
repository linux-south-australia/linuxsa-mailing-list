Terrible!  Don't tell people to do that.  If the person doesn't know what
they are doing, and Robyn said this is the case for her, tell them to do
that and they will, and almost certainly they will do so indiscriminately.

Don't ever ever ever ever EVER chmod 777 unless it's what you really want.
Never!  Not ever!

If you find yourself fighting with security you should learn what the
problem is rather than turning off all security.

In brief answer to your question, Robyn, the answer is in the man pages,
but probably you need to get the BSD man pages because Linux people often
don't believe in them.  Probably the answer you are really hoping to get is
the title of a good Linux book, which I don't know.  Have a look in Dymox
and The Bookshelf, browse and see what book seems to answer your questions.
