 &gt; &gt; The ADSL roll-out will happen slowly,
 &gt; &gt; because each local telephone exchange needs to be fitted out with
 &gt; &gt; a DSLAM and ATM connectivity back to whatever ISP owns it, but in

 &gt; &gt; able to say for Cable.
 &gt; 
 &gt; ATM??

Yup.  ADSL architecture looks like this:


              Subscriber
ethernet  ----	ADSL  ---- DSLAM ----- Aggregator ------- ISP
                modem
	     |&lt;-------------- ATM PVC ------------------&gt;|

It essentially extends an ATM PVC from the ISP's backbone back to the
subscriber's ADSL modem, which provides ethernet connevitity to the 
subscriber's equipment.

 &gt; Does that mean that all that work going into linux ATM drivers
 &gt; is going to pay off?

Probably not :-)  The end-user just sees ethernet.  There may be 
a place for it back on the ISP's backbone, but hey! there's already
a place for Linux back on the ISP's backbone anyway :-)

 &gt; And does that mean that we can write native ATM applications
 &gt; in linux to go over the net?

Doubtful.

 &gt; People had been saying for a while that ATM would stay in
 &gt; the backbone.

Yup!

 &gt; If ADSL is going to bring ATM to the user's home,
 &gt; ubiquitously, then this is reason for me to take an interest in
 &gt; linux ATM again.

Blurgh.  It's only going one-hop closer to the subscriber than it does
at the moment:  In some cases ATM is in the telco's network between the
local switch and the rest of their core, and a copper loop hooks up the
subscriber;  In ADSL's case, the "copper loop" bit will be an ethernet
cable, and the ATM side will extend to the end of their local subscriber
line.

 &gt; Can you give any info on low-cost ATM cards that would be
 &gt; suitable for ADSL?

None.  But there are standards-based ADSL modems available from just
about everywhere in the US;  It's quite mature technology now.

I tried an internal modem,                    <A HREF="mailto:newton@atdot.dotat.org">newton@atdot.dotat.org</A>
     but it hurt when I walked.                          Mark Newton
