ok this isn't a flame war, or even kindling.

but

if someone who hasn't yet fully come to grips on how the UNIX security
system works, needs a solution *right*now* then chmod 777 will work. 

My advice would then be however to immediately fix the problem, and lock
the security down as soon as possible.

Saying that chmod 7777 is "terrible" is saying "its an ugly fix" which
is true, but it "fixed" the problem. I say "fixed" becuase it might
(will) cause more problems later.

I think here we delve into the "quality" of UNIX admin - and for those
that have read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance will understand
this.

Both fixes, the chmod-777-everything and the
read-man-page-and-do-it-properlly are both solutions, just one has more
quality.



Must be this damn heat :)

&gt; It was terrible.  You started by saying, if I may cast it into an easy
&gt; interpretation, that if security gets in your way just chmod 777.  What
&gt; next?  Put the root passwd into /etc/motd, maybe?
&gt; 
&gt; If you are in a desparate hurry you can get there quickly by driving as
&gt; fast as your car will go and running red lights.  True; but it would be
&gt; more responsible to start by saying that in an emergency, when life is
&gt; threatened, you can suspend some of the road-traffic rules that normally
&gt; apply.
&gt; 
&gt; The question was really rather simple: Where do you get good information
&gt; on chmod.  A suggestion to use chmod 777 did not answer that question,
&gt; not in any way.  The answer, as I suggested before, is to recommend a
&gt; good book.  I'm delighted that you tried to help, even though your answer
&gt; was poorly conceived.  At this point I think you could do better than to
&gt; try to defend that mistake.  Nothing wrong with making a mistake; the
&gt; crime is to deny when you are wrong.
