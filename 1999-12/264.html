<H1>NT and Linux user authentication</H1>

Hello everyone.

I have an NT PDC and two BDC's.  I also have a Linux box.  Currently, all
user authentication is done by the NT PDC.

The linux box is currently our email server, proxy server, and dhcp server.
I want to keep it this way.  It's running RedHat 6.0, with a (very) few
upgraded RPM's.

I want everyone on the NT user database to have access to the email server,
because I don't want to waste money, time, effort, energy etc on MS
Exchange.

My questions are:

 - I believe Samba can be a PDC, and therefore is able to authenticate
   username/password pairs from a windows 95/98 client.  Has anyone had
   real-life experience with this and had it working well?  I'm not after
   walk-throughs or anything, I'm just after a general feeling from people.

 - If Samba/PDC *does* work well, I'd love to be able to just duplicate the
   bloody user database from Windows NT and dump the whole lot into my
   Linux user account database.  I can't have everyone having to re-enter
   their passwords etc, and I don't want to manually duplicate the accounts.

   Can you do it?

 - I've seen a PAM module called pam_ntdom.  Now *that* is really what would
   be the most useful for me for the immediate future - it is /supposed/ to
   authenticate user logins using a Windows NT Domain Controller.
   Unfortunately, though, even after loads of discussion with the author, I
   could *not* make it work correctly with my RedHat 6.0 system.  The author
   gave up on me :(

   Has anyone heard of anything similar?  Or in fact had pam_ntdom working?


The main problem is the whole authentication thing.  I want everyone to have
access to email, but they don't all have Linux accounts.  If their NT
password changes, the Linux password has to be changed seperately.  Yuk.

Thankyou for your time :)  All thoughts are /very/ welcome.

Bye for now.
