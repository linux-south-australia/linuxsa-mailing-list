&gt; ------
&gt; it's an archaic octal convention that's thrown you.
&gt;
&gt; if you are absolutely desperate to move forward, you can type in
&gt;
&gt; chmod 777  whatever
&gt;
&gt; some programs however are smart enough to look at their own permissions
&gt; and say no way, i'm not running open to the world like that. The above is
&gt; not a good idea, unless you're flat desperate.
&gt;
&gt; here is a safe one if 'just you' plan to use the file
&gt;
&gt; chmod 664 whatever (for 'text' type files)
&gt; and
&gt; chmod 774 whatever (for executing a program of that name)

Mike - you didn't explain what chmod was doing!  This could turn into one of
those 'a little information is a dangerous thing' situations..

Robyn, I think you should check the chmod man page (type `man chmod`), which
gives you a description of how the octal doofeys work.  It's actually quite
simple, and even logical, when you know what it's doing.

There's not a CHMOD-HOWTO, is there?  :-)

Quickly though -

Do you recognise this?

-rwxrwxrwx         - it appears when you do an `ls -l`.

- r w x  r w x  r w x
- 4 2 1  4 2 1  4 2 1
- [ U ]  [ G ]  [ O ]

U = User, G = Group, O = Other

The first column?  It defines systemy things that I don't know enough about
to write about.

Basically - add up the numbers of the relevant permissions and use them in
the chmod command.  eg -

to set -rwx------ (ie user can read, write, execute, but nobody else can..)
use `chmod 700`

to set -rwxrwx--- (ie user and users in the file's group can r,w,x, but
others cannot..) use `chmod 770`.

to set -rwxr-xr-x (ie everyone can read and execute, but only owner can
modify) use `chmod 766`.

That will start you off.  Want to know more?  (Starship Troopers...  gotta
buy that DVD..)  Read the man page etc.

Who wants to argue/be more specific?

Nick
