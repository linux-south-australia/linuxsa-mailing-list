LinuxSA persons:

Q1:
Does anyone know of any suites of network probe tools
for linux?

Q2:
Is it commercially viable to use the Artistic
Licence for open source tool development?

=============================================
Q1:
I haven't seen the kind of tools I'm looking for,
but some of you may have seen this kind of thing.

What I'm looking for is a set of tools which
will probe network components.
This is not like the NMAP tools and other
tools which probe nodes to see what is running
on network components (e.g. computers) and finds
their weaknesses etc.

I'm looking for performance tools -- tools to see
how many IP packets per second can be handled
continuously or in a surge (bursty traffic) by
things like routers (either purpose-designed
routers or IP hosts acting as routers, or even
ATM switches or ethernet hubs etc. etc. etc.).

What I'm trying to study is _throughput_ performance,
not _response_ performance. I guess "traceroute"
has some of this functionality.

The idea is that if I can probe and characterize 
every node in a network, then I can
simulate the whole network.

==============================================
Q2:
Suppose I find that there is no such suite of
IP-probe tools and I spend 6 months developing my
own from scratch.
How wise would it be to use the Artistic Licence
rather than the GNU Public Licence?

Ignoring (if possible) all the religious zeal
associated with the GPL, is it possible that
I can get the same benefits out of AL as out of GPL?

As I understand it (and have just read in 360 comments
in slashdot.org), a principal difference between the
two licences is that the AL permits commercial forks,
whereas the GPL does _not_ permit commercial forks.

If I develop a tool which I use in contract work,
and if a competitor with more resources creates
a closed-source commercial fork from that tool
which my compeitors use to put me out of business,
then I will have worked very hard to give
other people a free benefit. It would not be in
their interest to freely give back the improved
code to the public domain.

It seems like GPL _would_ prevent competitors from
marketing a commercial probe program -- which I then
have to buy to keep up with my competitors.
Paying for my own software (with other people's
improvements, kludges, bugs and lack of access to
the source) seems very unpleasant to me.
I think the BSD licence has the same problem.

So it seems like GPL must be best -- but I don't like
the dictatorial nature and oppressiveness of the
GPL terms and wording.

Can anyone see a way out of this?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
