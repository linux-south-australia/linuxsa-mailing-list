Good Folks,

I asked for help the other day when I found I could not start any X apps
after connecting to the net. Thanks to Rick Walford, a happy accident,
and the Mandrake-Linux Users page, I have rectified the problem.

For the record, in case any other poor souls find themselves in this
situation, the answer was to uncheck the box in kppp setup that says
'configure hostname from server' (or words to that effect). The answer
was obvious once found, but curious and annoying until then. 

The final lightbulb-generating clue came when doing su in an xterm so as
to check /var/log/messages. I was cursing not having done so prior to
dialling up, as I was in the habit of tailing that file to check
progress. When the prompt changed in that shell reflecting a hostname
based on the ISPs system, the penny dropped and all was quickly made
well again.

Thanks again all for support,

Bruce
