&gt;Brian, re your reference to Partition Magic.

&gt;Purchased a copy yesterday. Using RH 6.0 Dual Pentium 450, Two HDs -
&gt;Drive 1 Win95, Drive 2 Linux. Will not start at all in Win95. 

I have two systems similar to your configuration, and PM v4 (.01?) works
just fine with them.  You could use the working version to make a PM
"Rescue Disk".  This is actually a Caldera DOS boot disk with PM DOS
version installed and automatically invoked.
That Rescue Disk could then be applied to the non-working system without
the interference of the WinDOS OS.  Worth a try.

&gt;Partition
&gt;Magic complains that their is unknown geometry on Drive 2, and that it
&gt;cannot proceed. I think it is refering to my Linux drive.

You should know!  Use Partition Info and see whether it is Drive 1 or Drive
2 that cannot be seen properly.  PM will also indicate whether it is trying
to view Drive 1 or Drive 2.

&gt;When booting into Linux Drive I use 2 Floppies as well. However 3/4 of
&gt;the way in I get Error #1874 Unable to open A:\ PQPB.RTC required for
&gt;operation. It then closes.

Sorry I don't understand what you are describing here. I'm a bit confused
by the 2 floppies bit.  PM will produce 2 floppies, but the Help Disk is
not needed (I think it is all help files, from memory).

&gt;Have you come across any of these problems ? 

Only difficulty I have had was with an originally MAC-formatted drive
someone had tried to re-format to DOS.  That WAS a mess!

&gt;Would you have a copy of this file that I can try ?

You mean you think your original PM CD is faulty?  (It doesn't look like it
if the other system is OK).  I'll be glad to help you if all else fails,
but may I suggest ... ?
Use a PM Rescue disk (as above).
Take the troublesome disk and attach it to the trouble-free system.  Use PM
then.
The CD contains a Linux version.  Try that.
If nothing works, would it be better to complain to your software supplier
and obtain a replacement?
Failing that, if you are not too far away from Port Adelaide, you could
bring me the offending disk and I'll examine it on my system (which has a
3.5" HD caddy).
Failing that ....  I'm running out of ideas  :-(
