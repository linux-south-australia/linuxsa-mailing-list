Thank you heaps Anrew and others who replied.

What Andrew dercribed seems like it. And later I noticed that Tom's Single Floppy
linux does see something on hdc but says it needs a driver :)

One more question on HDD partitioning that has pazzeled me for a while. I worked
around it but still don't know what I did wrong in the first place. First I
thought fdisk in RH5.0 had a bug, but now I used fdisk on RH6.0 and had same prob.

I take a brand new unpartitioned Fudjitsu 10Gb HDD and use fdisk (RH6.0) to
partition it. Was not doing anything tricky
hda1 pramary FAT16
hda2 primary linux
hda3 primary linux (for /home)
hda4 extended
hda5 logical FAT16
hda6 logical FAT16
hda7 logical FAT32
hda8 logical linux swap

All created in the order listed, after I finish creating them, I press "v" for
verify and it reports that partitions are ovelapping!

Well, It does not let me enter illigal values to start with, and all cylinder
starts and end in sequence

eg
1 - 300
301 - 600

Why would it overlap them? I then used Partitoin Magic and recreated same
partitions and noticed that one of them was .1Mb smaller according to Partition
Magic. All cylinder starts and end kept the same (exepct that PM calls first
partition 0 and fdisk 1)

Anyone knows what it is or what I might be doing wrong?

Similar story happaned with my old 540 Mb disk when using RH5.0. Back then I just
ignored the message and kept using it anyway and for 1.5 years nothing bad
happened.
Now I am just curios

Thank you all

Eugene

&gt; &gt; My friend tried to install RH6.0 on his brand new PC. Installation fails
&gt; &gt; to find his hard disk. When going to partition HDD it says something
&gt; &gt; like "No hard disks". He's got 4 ports for hdd?! Mboard manual says 2
&gt; &gt; are 33 and other 2 are 66 something? So he connected his drive to 66
&gt; &gt; which supposed to be faster. I don't know what it is all about, just
&gt;
&gt; I had a similar problem which I emailed the list about before. As it turns
&gt; out, ATA/66 drives require drivers other than your normal IDE drivers to
&gt; work. Of course, these are going to be dependent on the kind of ATA/66
&gt; BIOS that the motherboard has.
&gt;
&gt; I had an Abit motherboard with the HighPoint Tech HPT366 BIOS - Linux drivers
&gt; are available from the hipoint-tech.com web site, as well as links to Linux
&gt; drivers for other ATA/66 BIOSes.
&gt;
&gt; Also, bear in mind that you should not be running a normal IDE drive from
&gt; the ATA/66 controllers - these are for ATA/66 drives only.
&gt;
&gt; (You can run an ATA/66 drive from a normal IDE controller, but you may need
&gt; to download a drive utility to turn off the ATA/66 function of the drive -
&gt; my Western Digital ATA/66 drive came with the ATA/66 function enabled, even
&gt; though the documentation says that it ships disabled by default.)
&gt;
&gt; For those that are interested: I contacted VMware about raw disk partition
&gt; booting on ATA/66 drives (as this is not supported currently with SCSI drives)
&gt; and they think that is should work, even though it's not tested. I opted in
&gt; the end to run my drive in normal IDE mode, although I had to change
&gt; motherboards in the end - has anyone else ever seen the HDD parameters
&gt; change in the BIOS after rebooting as a result of partitions on the drive?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Windows boots and works from that drive
&gt;
&gt; Windows 95 and 98 seem to have ATA/66 support built in - Windows NT will
&gt; not install without suppling the ATA/66 drivers during install.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Andrew
