&gt; Windows NT has really killed the job of Systems Administration and will
&gt; probably give IT people a bad name for a while. I'm not just talking about
&gt; the crashes and data lost, but more about the fact that you get Sys admins
&gt; who believe that because they have used Windows 95, they can run an entire
&gt; LAN or WAN. I have seen this happen. If they are having a problem with
&gt; something, they upgrade the hardware. These people won't sit down and work
&gt; out that there is too much traffic on the network because each client has 3
&gt; protocols installed, they just upgrade to 100BaseT. They are costing the
&gt; world a fortune and us our jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; 

&lt;2 cents&gt;

I would say that NT has in no way reduced the need for sys admins.
Sure you may not have to use a text editor  or a command line tool change
a config of some sort,
but you still have to know what it is you are doing, what it effects are
etc etc.

In other words, it may be "easy" (probably meaning you don't need to learn
a text editor ) to do something, but you still have to know what all
those words in the dialog boxes mean, and the effects of changing the
settings.

Example
So while it may be relatively easy to enable IP forwarding(just tick a
checkbox no kernel recompile) you still have to understand the concept of
IP forwarding and still have to understand the implication(which may be
subtle).

What NT may have done is introduced a need for more system admins with
NT/Windows experience and perhaps more SYs Admins overall as all the
businesses who buy NT thinking they can now have aserver of whatever sort
without an admin, realise the folly of their decision.

&lt;/2 cents&gt;

JT
