&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cool, I thought I was the only one who'd ever seen this problem. I had a
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with a legend computer with exactly this problem. It seems to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the BIOS. Solution, replace the BIOS, replace the motherboard, or if
&gt; &gt; &gt; you must boot on november 13th, press DELETE, reset the date to November
&gt; &gt; &gt; 14th, boot then reset back once it is booted. Was this a Legend brand PC ?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; While we don't know what machine this board originally resided in I
&gt; &gt; would almost be prepared to bet that it was the same board.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Further tests reveal that replacing the BIOS chip stops the behaviour.
&gt; &gt; Obviously the tune resides in the BIOS chip. Place the BIOS chip in
&gt; &gt; another identical board and it functions normally. i.e. no tune. If
&gt; &gt; someone can read this chip and would like to have a go at decoding it I
&gt; &gt; sure it can be arranged.

Umm I dont have the hardware too read it, but it may be able too be
aranged.  I have been reverse engineering software for years, and I'd
love too see what makes it tick! Particularly if someone can just send
me the ROM as a binary file.  Still let me know if you can only supply
the chip.
