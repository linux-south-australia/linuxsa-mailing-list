My bet with the people here is that ETSA's attempts to save
money will cause more disruption than Y2K.

I'm ahead on points so far with half of Adelaide without
power for half a day when ETSA turned off their Port
Augusta generators on a day of extreme temperatures (and
thus a greatly increased risk of equipment faults).

Someone else here has a bet on talk show hosts whipping people
into a ATM withdrawal frenzy.

Optus list their #1 Y2K risk as hordes of Y2K lemmings all
testing their PBX systems at 00:01 2000-01-01 and causing
network congestion.  They've allocated testing windows to
ameliorate this.

At University of Adelaide, the biggest Y2K network threat is
system administrators powering down their Novell servers,
not realising that without a server to give a IPX Get Nearest
Server response then no one in their building can start an
IPX client.

Y2K is a no-win situation.  If nothing happens, then Y2K
expenditures on contingency plans were a waste of money.
If it all falls apart, then programmers won't look too hot.
