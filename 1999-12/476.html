&gt; OK, reports aren't designed to have Parts, thus the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; The simplest answer is to use /section /subsection and
&gt; /subsubsection.


Thankyou guys!

Ok - I've done some adjusting.
========
\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}

\title{xx}
\author{xx}
\maketitle

\tableofcontents

\section {Introduction}
asdf
\section {Considerations}
	
	\subsection {Hardware}
	
		\subsubsection {ARLAN Microwave Bridges}

I still get 0.x and 0.x.y

But - if I use \chapter instead of \part, I /almost/ get what I want. I
say /almost/ because it numbers everything /perfectly/, exactly as I want,
but it puts "CHAPTER x" at the top of each chapter, which doesn't look
good in a report!  So - I'm guessing I can tell the \chapter command to
not write "CHAPTER x", right?  I'm going to have a look, but tell me if
it's not possible or totally complicated *grin*

&gt; If you really need Parts, then initialise the Part counter
&gt; manually.

I /may/ look into this..  unless I can think of another way to format and
section this document!  I need one more level of numbered sectioning than
section/subsection/subsubsection will give me.  I think.

&gt; If you are just beginning, I'd suggest working withing the
&gt; confines of the predefined styles.

I'm trying to!!  lol..  TeX looks like the sort of tool you could study
at uni for a year..  :)

&gt; &gt; Or - does anyone have any good LaTeX FAQ's that actually 
&gt; &gt; address this?  I would think that someone else must have come up
&gt; &gt; with the problem, but the FAQs I searched didn't even mention
&gt; &gt; section numbering problems :(
&gt; 
&gt; 1.

[snipped resources] A million thanks..

&gt; &gt; Btw - once I've got this problem sorted out, TeX is going to become my
&gt; &gt; only typesetting program..  Word can finally get the kick :)  Hoorah 
&gt; 
&gt; In which case I'd suggest using LyX or XEmacs+AUCTeX as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Most serious document producers end up using either LaTeX or FrameMaker.
&gt; The limitations of other packages really don't kick in unless you are
&gt; writing a book or thesis.

Groovy.  I will do some research :)

&gt; &gt; Is there such a thing as a DVI-to-Word.DOC converter?
&gt; 
&gt; No.  You can generate PDF.  You probably want to recompile GhostScript
&gt; with LZW support and use the Adobe fonts if you are doing that.

Ahh PDF :)  Wonderful :)

*dives into the world of doco formatting*

Thankyou again people..

Nick!
