&gt; AOL CD's make brilliant COASTERS!

Perhaps we should have a contest at the next meeting to
see how far an AOL CDs can be rolled on its side.  Winner
gets to keep the CD :-)

When OS/2 was young and less than stable (as opposed to now,
when OS/2 is a dead product and therefore totally stable),
a coworker used to take the CDs with bad bugs, pin them to
his noticeboard and fling darts at it.  The point being *not*
to hit the bullseye.  Maximum points if the dart when through
the CD at the IBM logo.  It used to really upset the IBM sales
reps that would occassionally wander through the systems division
thinking to cozy up to the technical staff.  (Not that IBM
sales reps had a clue what OS/2 was, and some of them didn't
know that you could store data on a CD, it was the dart through
the logo that set them off).
