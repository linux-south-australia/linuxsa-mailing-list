&gt; &gt; There is no real solution to democracy. Rule by the majority if that
&gt; &gt; majority is decided by people who have been persuaded by a minority
&gt; &gt; simply upsets the whole idea of this type of representation.
&gt;
&gt; True. There are too many ifs... IF you can devise a perfectly fair
&gt; system, and IF all the electors make their choices based on an
&gt; intelligent, rational assessment of the various candidates' merits,
&gt; and IF the politicians, once elected, put the welfare of those
&gt; governed before their own career... and IF you can solve all these
&gt; without coming across a whole next level of IFs...

Will never happen, so "ifs" are a little superfluous. When has a politician 
ever done what his pre- election platform promised. Laws need to put in place 
to require politicians to honour their pre-election promises, or be removed 
from office. We would never get bored with them then, they would be changed 
regularly.

&gt;
 simply pick a new leader at
&gt; random every month, from a pool of the entire adult population
&gt; excluding criminals and the insane. (How do you define insanity?)

Put all candidates in large muslin bags and remove every other one till we had 
enough left would not be any worse than what we have now. (method of removal 
entirely open, suggest cheapest way available)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; For example, the Christian Churches have a significantly
&gt; &gt; disproportionate amount of influence over the current Australian
&gt; &gt; system and whilst, thank God (!), we're not a theocracy last time I
&gt; &gt; looked the Christians happened to form a minority in our modern society.

The vocal minority is evident in all facets of life. Law is a good example.



&gt; Rule One: No Poofters! :-)
 Sorry Rule One is : Anyone who believes anything a pollie says should be 
barred from voting on the grounds of mental incompetence.
Interesting Graffitti near my mothers , : "Dont vote it only encourages them"


Take care, and I hope everyone on the list has a very safe and peaceful 
Christmas.
