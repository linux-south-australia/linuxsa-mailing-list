I have to agree - Outlook makes a good effort at messing up text emails..

sorry guys - I have tried to get it to behave but apparently that is not
permitted on my present platform...

It's not that I am not aware of the Outlook MUA issue..

&gt;&gt; What makes me curse is the fact that doing just about anything is so
&gt;&gt; painful.  Just replying to a mail message is thwarted by the lack of a
&gt;&gt; real editor.  How do I reformat paragraphs?  How do I remove the
&gt;&gt; blanks in the "&gt; &gt;" of doubly quoted text?  How do I turn upside-down
&gt;&gt; messages the right way again?  How do I convert the text \"Mcleod,
&gt;&gt; Ian\" to Ian Mcleod?  Like other people forced to use Microsoft, I
&gt;&gt; give up and send out a messy message, but it goes strongly against the
&gt;&gt; grain.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have trimmed my email message so Mutt doesn't crash
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; No, mutt doesn't crash.  The point I was making was that careful
&gt;&gt; trimming is difficult in a toy environment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope that's okay..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; By throwing the baby out with the bath water, you've rather proved my
&gt;&gt; point.
&gt;
&gt; hey I completely agree
&gt;
&gt; But the Windows user interface is vastly more easy to use and
&gt; unified across Windows platforms.

That's where we will have to disagree.

&gt; BTW - is this email messed up?  I tried to turn off all the
&gt; 'enhancements' that Outlook forces one to use against their will..

Well, your text was completely separate from what you were replying
to, so I'm not sure what you're referring to.  And it's missing an
In-Reply-To: header, which means that it doesn't get threaded
properly.  And it doesn't contain answers to a number of questions.
But it doesn't have mutilated formatting this time.  That's a matter
of luck, though: I don't know of any easy way to ensure that Outlook
doesn't mutilate text.
