&gt; Congratulations to Ian.    :)

Many thanks and many thanks to th folks from Sun and Linux.conf who 
have put this together.

I am stunned to have been selected and feel humble to be able to attend 
this conference.

I have already registered for the education mini-conf which will be 
held on the Monday and Tuesday of conference week.

I have asked for a BOF (Birds of a Feather) gathering to talk about 
bringing Linux into the community. Hopefully there will be folks from 
ComputerBank and other like-minded organisations who will be at the 
conf. Be nice to get together and share notes on our various projects.

This is such a great opportunity to also talk about the Community 
Software Network and our desire to build a distribution network to put 
copies of community software into the reach of the community.

Now, I am planning on flying out Sunday arvo the 19th and back on 
Sunday 26th. Anybody else going to the conf that is planning to go on 
the same days? 

Who said penguins cant fly? &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
