&gt; That's so funny.  I'm sure the lyrics really describe the man's physique,
&gt; not his latest meal.  Mind you, given the reputed powers of molluscs,
&gt; it's easy to see why David could appreciate the deglutition conundrum
&gt; solving properties of a watery bint who is really a six foot four man!
&gt; Such a woman would help me decide what to eat, too.  And, if it really
&gt; was Vegimate (sic) that was spread on the sandwich, perhaps David was
&gt; correct when he claimed it contains meat extract.


And sometihng crossed my mind, if the watery tart did infact hand out a
vegemite sandwich, wouldnt the sandwich be a tad soggy, thus lessening its
quality? Unless, it seems that all the fungus and bacteria in the vegemite
(albeit single cell, or multicell) had created a "outer sheath" that protected the bread
(of which i have it on good information also contains yeast, and tiny
fibres of something that make kids healthy, even though they cant see them
with a microscope)

Maybe phillip morris use the yummy vegemite taste in their cigerettes to
make them more addictive to kids, who can resemble the taste to something
they eat everymorning (assuming they are not in a house where rugby
players and cricket players line up for weetbix)

Smoking is Kuckey, but vegemite is yummy. im confused. But i wouldnt mind
meeting said watery tart, say on friday night if she is still giving free
sandwiches.

Cheers,

drew
