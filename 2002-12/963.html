&gt; Yeah, I was in Los Angeles during the last set of riots. (There was an

&gt; Having only been to Windsor and Edmonton in Canada, I would say that 
&gt; there is a smaller gap between the rich and the poor. People are very 
&gt; well taken care of there. Most people can afford a home, are well fed, 
&gt; and happy. Its a bit different in South Central. &lt;g&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; People of economic disadvantage form groups, i.e. the Crypts and the 
&gt; Bloods in Los Angeles.  These groups scare the economically advantaged, 
&gt; so they go out and get a gun to defend themselves. Its a downward spiral.

And you are allowed to use it, or it's easy to get away with using it;
an ex-boss of mine has a tale of a Texas ranch owner: apparently it's
legal to shoot an intruder you find inside your house, but not in the
grounds. This ranch owner found someone acting suspiciously outside,
shot him, dragged the body indoors, called the law and they said
"that's fine, boy". A farmer in England recently, who had been
repeatedly burgled and had no help from the police, shot a burglar and
is now in prison for it.

&gt; Also, there are some mythos in U.S. history, that if marketed, will 
&gt; promote gun sales.  The Declaration of Independence...
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created 
&gt; &gt; equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
&gt; &gt; Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of 
&gt; &gt; Happiness -- That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted 
&gt; &gt; among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the 
&gt; &gt; Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of 
&gt; &gt; these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, 
&gt; &gt; and to institute new Government, 
&gt; 
&gt; Some argue that the government has too much power. The only way to 
&gt; preserve the right to abolish the government,  is to own a gun. They 
&gt; remind that teh revolutionary war was fought with a militia of common 
&gt; folk carrying guns.

Well that "right to bear arms" amendment was designed for that, so
that common folk could form a militia and bring their own guns. It's a
bit irrelevant these days, so you don't see the first part of the
phrase quoted as much as the last part.

&gt; There are more reasons why USIANS have an affinity for guns, but you get 
&gt; the picture. Economics and history all play a part.

Yes - much of it was colonised by people who absolutely depended upon
guns for their survival. But Hollywood and the media play a part in
glamourising it, which is why Mafia bosses etc can inspire hero
worship instead of revulsion.
