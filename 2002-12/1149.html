Hmmm...

&gt; 1. Where should configuration files go?

Where the Filesystem Hierachy Standard says so.

&gt; 2. How should installations work

Huh?

&gt; 3. Pick a standard .Deb or RPM and stick with it

But choice is good...stick something like apt on top of the bonnet.

&gt; 4. Pick a boot sequence standard and stick with it

Like the SysVInit we have?

&gt; 5. Documentation standards

But the Linux Documentation Project has already chosen DocBook as its
documentation standard.

&gt; 6. Ease of use standards

Bah!

Such as point and click at things? Fancy dialogs that don't have half
the options of find...

&gt; 7. Justification for changing the command line systax of your
&gt; applications

I dare you to change the syntax of mv to:

# mv TO_FILE FROM_FILE

...don't, I warn you, give out your address.

&gt; 8. Development roadmaps

What? Plans?

&gt; 9. Elect a leader at large to give some direction

Yeah, right, and one everyone will look up to and agree with.

&gt; But then he said..."Well I think it would actually be nice if the
&gt; Linux community charged for their work, that way, the operating system
&gt;  would  &gt; be funded enough so I or many other people could use it.
&gt;  Just look at OSX."

Apple funds OSX through hardware sales.
