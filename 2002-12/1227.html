hey don't get me wrong - we all know MS just take existing protocols and
bloat them - like the X protocol and Terminal Server - it's no secret.

But for better or worse - MS do standardise things - just in their own way.
That's where the competition of Linux comes in to play..

I can send documents, etc to anyone in the country by Outlook because
everyone uses it in office buildings - or almost everyone..

I suggest that Linux needs to adhere more to MS standards if it has to - to
ensure compatibility and then eventual competition - that's a strategy not
strange to MS - they did it to everyone else..

&gt; And since when could Windows do these things?
&gt; 
&gt; A)  STANDARD EMAIL FORMATS
&gt; 
&gt; Outlook is full of inconsistent formats.  From RTF to HTML, to Plain
&gt; Text -- If you set Outlook to PLAIN TEXT MODE it will *always* reply to
&gt; an RTF email in RTF.

My "favourite" Microsoft Mail Mangling of the Moment -

    <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid</A>=KB;en-us;q265230

And then they have the audacity to pin the problem on SMTP.  Are
these guys *ever* going to get MIME working correctly? 

Ian, the one thing Microsoft mail clients are barely, and have never
been, are standards compliant.  The deficiencies in IE are just as
bad.
