There is only one way to settle this..

I have plenty of the real Marmite here, since everytime my family visit 
from the UK they bring me some over, so I propose The *nix Users *Mite 
Taste Test to settle this once and for all!!

if we have interested I can organise a bbq (hopefully I will have caught 
some of the large snapper I am fishing for later!!) and put on the Taste 
Test..

If anyone knows where we can get some Bovril to add to the mix, but it 
is a totally different ballpark (I used to drink it as a hot drink!!)

we can also get some Sanitarium Marmite and other alternatives to throw 
in the mix..

any takers?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It's a spread for toast that is derived from meat products. Australians
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;seem to love it but everyone else hatest it. You can probably find it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;over in Canada :-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Meat Products?!!?  I always thought, from fairly relaible sources, that it
&gt;&gt;&gt;was made from the leftover yeast from making beer.  Anyone who has made home
&gt;&gt;&gt;brew will know about the yeast paste that settles on the bottom of the brew
&gt;&gt;&gt;barrel.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyone in a better position to confirm this?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Vegemite is indeed made from yeast waste (what would otherwise have
&gt;&gt;gone into XXXX I believe).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Bovril, an English version is made from trypsinised (read
&gt;&gt;enzymatically digested) cows. Tastes sort of the same - lots of
&gt;&gt;salt, but a bit beefyer.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No, Bovril is not the English version of Vegemite.  That's undoubtedly
&gt; Marmite, which is also a yeast extract.

&gt;&gt;&gt;     The Vegemite story is truly inspiring. It's chock full of Aussie

&gt;&gt;&gt;....
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The yeast extract spread we all know and love first appeared on our
&gt;&gt;&gt;shelves in 1923. It was made from many essential ingredients apart
&gt;&gt;&gt;from yeast extract.

&gt;&gt;here is the real stuff..

&gt; 
&gt; Much as I hate to admit it, Vegemite is just a clone of Marmite.
&gt; Follow the link above for relative dates.  Even the name was adapted.
&gt; Vegemite doesn't mean anything; Marmite is the French word for "stock
&gt; pot".
&gt; 
&gt; More interesting is why Vegemite is so popular here.  I used to eat
&gt; Marmite when I lived in the UK, but most of the Poms thought I was
&gt; crazy.  Even more interesting is that the original extract was
&gt; developed in Germany by the chemist Justus von Liebig.  There's not
&gt; much trace of his stuff in Germany any more.
