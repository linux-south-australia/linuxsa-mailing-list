&gt; &gt;OK. Dare I even suggest (seeing as we are, for all intents and
&gt; &gt;purposes, a Microsoft shop, at the moment) that SQL Server is even
&gt; &gt;worth thinking about? I've never worked with it in a development
&gt; &gt;sense, but I can imagine that it will be raised as an option at some
&gt; &gt;stage in the future.
&gt;
&gt; SQL Server is good and very capable of dishing out data in volume. There
&gt; are certain caveats. 
&gt; 1. Good DB design (of course)
&gt; 2. Good Indexing
&gt; 3. Good DISK Partitioning/Striping and SCSI if you want more than 5 users!

Heh :-) I think most of the commercial database servers are going to
require mammoth amounts of power in order to support a notable user
base.

&gt; I would stack SQL server up against the others for maintenability most days
&gt; (unless it pisses me off :P). The management side is minimal so long as the
&gt; design is sound. 

Yeah, I can't say that I've had too many complaints about it during
the time that I've been looking after servers with SQL Server
applications running on it. The only issue that took a bit of thinking
about was database backup, but even that was relatively painless in
the end.

&gt; &gt;... not that I'm particularly keen to use it (the number of security
&gt; &gt;advisories directly relating to SQL Server in the last few weeks is
&gt; &gt;quite frightening), but it'll have to be a consideration.
&gt; 
&gt; Security issues are minor irritations from my end as ours is solely
&gt; internal and it's simply a matter of load patch and possibly reboot. It
&gt; does need the occasional reboot (2-3 times a year is probably the worst case)

Yeah, I think that it's probably going to be the same in our case,
too. The server and/or application that runs the interface would be
the main one that you'd have to worry about as far as security goes,
as that's possibly the one that'd be facing the Internet (though
probably after authentication).

Hmmm!

&gt; Also if you are using MS languages and are looking at moving to .NET the
&gt; NATIVE SQL classes in .NET are about 5 times faster than the ODBC drivers.

Interesting. Microsoft actually managed to implement a feature that
works more efficiently than the alternative? Well, I guess there's a
first for everything :-)

&gt; No matter how good Linux is we have to satisfy all Masters and ourselves
&gt; last. So we are forced into the 'NO GOT FIRED FOR BUYING IBM' syndrome.

Heh :-)

&gt; Don't dismiss SQL server I'd sooner use it than Oracle. 

I won't dismiss anything until I've looked at it in more depth (hence
my comments that seem to have DSL all upset).

&gt; &gt;&gt; How are you going to get the existing Windows clients to talk to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; new database?
&gt; 
&gt; XML is a targetted in the .NET langs so you can open a cursor which returns
&gt; XML you can also open XML as a cursor and export it. 

Yay.

&gt; &gt;Still thinking about that. Perhaps, as was suggested to me by Dan
&gt; &gt;Shearer, the backend can produce data in XML format to be rendered by
&gt; &gt;whatever application we so choose, whether it be a Windows-native
&gt; &gt;client, a web-based client, or something made out of toothpicks and
&gt; &gt;creamcheese.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course you can forget about all this and pick MySQL and various
&gt; combinations of C/JAVA/php/Apache for your reporting and processing needs.

Perhaps; MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database engine and then Java
spitting out XML via Apache or Tomcat to an interface somewhere else.

      I now know how I get the funding approved for the project (think
      Buzz Words :-) ]
