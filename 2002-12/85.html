&gt; &gt; 2:30pm, I decided to spend another half hour on hold, to find out that
&gt; &gt; he's coming tomorrow.
&gt; 
&gt; Free money!
&gt; 
&gt; From the Telstra CSG: "You may be entitled to a CSG payment for every
&gt; working day of delay beyond an agreed connection date." It's $12/day for
&gt; residential, $20/day for business for a standard phone line install, up
&gt; to 5 working days - then it goes up to $40/working day.

Wow. $12. Handy. :)

&gt; 
&gt; They really do pay, too! I've managed to get a few hundred $ out of
&gt; Telstra before for this situtation, where they don't show up on the
&gt; agreed day. To maximise your benefit, you should ensure that you are
&gt; unable to work from home again for a few weeks!

The unfortunate thing is that I have no proof that they said Monday
apart from the fact that I recall them saying Monday, and I wrote
Monday down...

&gt; 
&gt; See the back of the White Pages for all the details.

Cheers ... :)
