&gt; This isn't out of the question.  Keeping right away from the Linux vs.
&gt; Microsoft debate, it makes more sense to me to implement a Windows
&gt; ActiveDirectory and incorporate Unix into it.  We run Windows Desktops,
&gt; and will also require at least one Windows server to support some
&gt; services.

I'd be interested to hear which services.

&gt; To get the most out of the Windows environment for the users, using
&gt; Windows would allow me to do a lot more across the Windows side of
&gt; things when it comes down to implementing NT policies, or even
&gt; deployment of some software in the Microsoft part of our environment.

You'll actually find that things like profiles and policies are (on the
server side at least) just files that are copied from the server and
work no matter which platform the server is. Remote application
deployment tools will also generally work in a similar fashion, rather
than implement their own network protocols.

&gt; I can't see why an authentication system based on Unix is advantageous
&gt; at this point.  I'm open to feedback ;-)

We could talk for days about security, stability and scalability, but I
think we're all sick of pointless discussions about who's is better
(when we all know that the answer is ********). Obviously it depends a
lot on the task at hand, but here's a couple of things I like about this
kind of thing being done on Unix.

Unix systems are typically much more flexible than most others. In a
Unix environment, I have a filesystem of mostly useless tools (cat,
grep, cut, find) by themselves, but I can put them all together like
lego set and make them do the job that's necessary. Whereas under
Windows, I have to look at the handful of GUI tools available that have
been created with specific things in mind and shape my problem around
the tools or buy a more expensive tool that may do the job better, but
may not.

As far as authentication goes, it's not all that difficult to have
Windows authenticate from a unix machine (using Samba) and have Samba do
some trickery to keep the accounts synchronised.

Here's a file server example. Let's say you're running a legacy 16-bit
Windows application (like certain recent versions of Office). You can't
change the application for another, the company that wrote it won't
support it for whatever reason and you have a problem. The problem is
that you need to store the data files for this application on a file
server, so that many people can access the data. This in itself is fine,
but due to a feature of the software you have problems.

Before writing the data to disk when you click save, this application
checks to see if there's enough disk space left. A good thing, you'd
think. Unfortunately, when the application was written, Windows was
still only using FAT16. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the network
file system had a number of GB of disk free, which overflowed the
variable used to store the amount of free space left, which made the
application think that there was a negative amount of disk space free.
It barfed.

If you had a Windows server, how would you solve the problem?

How would you solve the problem on Novell's Netware?

How about Unix?


The way we fixed this particular problem was to tell Samba to use a
shell command to find out how much space was free, instead of native OS
calls. We just told Samba to run a command that would always return a
number less than 2GB for the amount of free space. Hey presto, the
application worked.

Standards are also a reason why one might choose a Unix system over
anything else.

Hope it helps,
Matt
