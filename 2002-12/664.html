heh.

Without showing my bias one way or the other (this could get out of
hand...)

I think Australia would need a better policy than a-gun-in-every-cupboard
if we were going to defend ourselves from an invasion. That would be a
recipie for a walk-over, we just don't have the right psyche or training
within the non-military community

Hell, maybe the crims who still have guns would stand up and defend us! :)

&gt; also if everyone hands in their guns, the crooks keep theres cos they're
&gt; crooks anyway, duh.  also if indonesia feel like invading, they'll just walk
&gt; all over us.  (anybody seen any funerals/weddings in australia where they
&gt; fire off their automatics into the air in celebration?)  anyway just my
&gt; mumblings...  of course the goverment's got that covered with our state of
&gt; the art defense program. hahahah.

&gt; &gt;(I'm not suggesting gun control is a bad thing, in fact I agree with it
&gt; &gt;wholeheartedly if it's done in the correct way, but in this country at

&gt; &gt;understanding of what they were on about)
