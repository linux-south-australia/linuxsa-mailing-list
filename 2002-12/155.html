&gt;       The Vegemite story is truly inspiring. It's chock full of Aussie
&gt; ingenuity, hard work and innovation.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The yeast extract spread we all know and love first appeared on our shelves
&gt; in 1923. It was made from many essential ingredients apart from yeast
&gt; extract.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the main ones was Fred Walker - a man before his time.
&gt; 
&gt; He was an entrepreneur and business visionary. Fred tried many different
&gt; businesses from selling hat accessories to managing an agency for racehorses
&gt; & jockeys. He then branched out into canning. Under the company name of Fred
&gt; Walker & Co, Fred started canning everything that could be canned- meat, ox
&gt; tongue, macaroni and vermicelli.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1918, the war delayed imports of popular yeast extracts. Walker saw an
&gt; opening in the market and pounced. Fred enlisted the help of a brilliant
&gt; young chemist, Dr Cyril P Callister, to work on a yeast extract and a cheese
&gt; that had a long shelf life. After many attempts, they developed a spread,
&gt; and Vegemite was born.
&gt; 
&gt; While Dr Callister was working on a cheese with a long shelf life, he found
&gt; a viable patent that was registered by James Kraft, a Canadian who was based
&gt; in Chicago. Fred went to America to talk to James Kraft. James Kraft and
&gt; Fred Walker were two peas in a pod and in 1926 they decided to start a joint
&gt; venture -The Kraft Walker Cheese Company.
&gt; 
&gt; Kraft has been making Vegemite here in Australia since 1926 and continues to
&gt; do so today.
&gt; 
&gt; Fred Walker's and James Kraft's values still pervade through Kraft Foods
&gt; today and their famous spread continues to put a rose in every cheek
&gt; 
&gt; Dosn't quite say what's in it but in intresting non the less
