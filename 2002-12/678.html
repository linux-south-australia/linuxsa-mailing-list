&gt; Andrew,

&gt; &gt; What does the "t" at the end of the permissions  " drwxrwxrwt "  mean?
&gt; 
&gt; It sets the sticky bit on the directory. Any files created in that
&gt; directory will get the directory owners and group rather than the
&gt; default owner and group of the process creating the directory.

Isn't that the SetUID and SetGID bits on the directory? From the chmod
man page:

       The letters `rwxXstugo' select the new permissions for the
       affected users: read (r), write (w),  execute  (or  access
       for directories) (x), execute only if the file is a direc­
       tory or already has execute permission for some user  (X),
       set  user  or  group  ID on execution (s), sticky (t), the
       permissions that the user who owns the file currently  has
       for it (u), the permissions that other users in the file's
       group have for it (g),  and  the  permissions  that  other
       users not in the file's group have for it (o).

[snip]

STICKY FILES
       On older Unix systems, the sticky  bit  caused  executable
       files  to  be  hoarded in swap space.  This feature is not
       useful on modern VM systems, and the Linux kernel  ignores
       the sticky bit on files.  Other kernels may use the sticky
       bit on files for system-defined purposes.   On  some  sys­
       tems,  only the superuser can set the sticky bit on files.

STICKY DIRECTORIES
       When the sticky bit is set on a directory, files  in  that
       directory may only be unlinked or renamed by root or their
       owner.  (Without the sticky bit, anyone able to  write  to
       the  directory can delete or rename files.) The sticky bit
       is commonly found on directories, such as /tmp, which  are
       world-writable.


Hope it helps,
Matt
