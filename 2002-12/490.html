&gt; I completely concurr that the Debian install procedure is awful. Once

I agree. The convenience of 'apt-get update' and the knowledge that the 
update packages have been thoroughly examined for any possible defects 
makes it truly useful, as opposed to the distributions that offer a 
similar update service but without similar stringent checks on the 
packages.

If I wanted a solid Linux system as a server, Debian would be one of my 
first choices. It's a long way out of date for features, but it's up to 
date for security and reliability. For a user machine, I would go for 
multiple reinstallations of a popular feature stuffed distribution like 
SuSE, knowing that I'll have to reinstall the lot on a regular basis 
like a Windows machine.

&gt; 1. minimal base install (from a boot-floppies CD + very fast network,
&gt; often a mirror setup on the local LAN from the CD set).

Yep, we have the same approach. I've talked a lot of people through the 
Debian install and it's much easier with the system you've detailed. 
I've hung out in the #debian channel and it's amazing the number of 
people who do full installs of an old system then whinge about the huge 
number of packages incurred when they upgrade.

&gt; but none of these have been adopted. I think the reason in each case 
&gt; had
&gt; to do with the software architecture not being quite right, which
&gt; demonstrates again the Debian project's technical stubbornness. They do
&gt; seem to care a lot about fundamental design.

Up to a certain point. I was involved in the Debian project before the 
first public release and we all had some terrible arguments about the 
package management scheme. Half the group wanted file level, the other 
half wanted package level. When Ian Jackson came out with the overly 
complicated package based scheme, along with the incredibly long 
checklist to shift the technical problems onto humans, quite a few of 
us left the project.

Florian La Roche started Jurix (which I started using), and that 
eventually became SuSE. When SuSE started using rpm's, that left me 
without any distributions I liked... Obi Wan Gentoo is my last hope, 
but not yet. :)

&gt; Now, speaking of awful installers, we could talk about OpenBSD... :-)
