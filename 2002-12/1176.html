&gt;&gt; Sadly - the user-unfriendly philosophies have not changed at all in

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I hope it does - before it's too late..

&gt; Too late, for what? Linux can't lose money or go out of business.

&gt;I think it's terrible.  If you're sitting in the next room, you can
&gt;tell by the cursing and swearing when I have to use that kind of
&gt;interface.  
&gt;
I am against any gui that is forced upon highly skilled people that 
don't need them.
The option to use them should be easily availble and apparent to use.
Nobody should be forced to use an unfavorable interface.

I'll probably never have an understanding of Unix in which a GUI would 
slow me down.
But I have a lot of respect for someone with that high level of skill.  

Wow.

Hats off...

&gt;But it's obviously too difficult to trim mail
&gt;messages with the MUA you're using, right?  I've tried using various
&gt;Microsoft-based MUAs, and I can't find any that doesn't slow me down
&gt;by a factor of about 10.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;

This made me think to myself and ponder....why don't I use Pine instead 
of Netscape for email?

I don't know really.  Maybe I like the way Netscape looks, or that I am 
familiar with the layout.

But if there were an email program that looked and worked in a manner in 
which I both prefered and was used to,  but at the same time, trimmed 
the mail down in a proper manner,

I would be very dissapointed to see that people weren't using it because 
some outside factor made it too difficult for a great number of people 
to use.  It would be disrespectful of yoour knowledge and the merits of 
your point.

&gt;
&gt;Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't. You are attempting to take the
&gt;Windows paradigm of "someone will help us SUPPOSEDLY for nothing" into
&gt;the Unix/Linux paradigm of "we will help those who help themselves".
&gt;

The problem right now is that paying to switch to Linux does not make 
sense for my company. If I were to get Red Hat out here to my company 
and ask them to turn it into a Linux shop exclusively, it would cost 
much more than simply buying 10 PC's from Dell. Furthermore, we would 
not have an income tax preparation, trial balance, depreciation or 
financial statement programs to use, all of which are critical and 
essential to our company's survival.


I want Linux to make sense, stubbornly so.

I have made a personal choice to pay for these costs by spending a lot 
of my free time figuring Linux out. It has been an unreasonable amount 
of time in fact. But I do it because I want to respect the knowledge and 
skills people have generously donated to the community.
