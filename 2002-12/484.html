&gt; Funny, I get fully working workstations after doing Debian installs.

Yes I was.

&gt; How is that different from any other distro, or from any of the BSD's, 
&gt; for that matter?

It isn't. They all suck.

&gt; That's an odd statement as well, I've found Debian to be *the* best 
&gt; distro in terms of consistency and integration of all packages with 
&gt; the system as a whole.

If you can't install a package and have all the other packages 
recognise it's there and start using it, there's no integration.

&gt; Why would you do that instead of building the package from source with 
&gt; your tweaks applied?

The latest version of Apache from CVS may not be (and isn't) tweaked 
for Debian packages.

&gt;&gt; and want you to install the Apache package even though a simple probe 
&gt;&gt; of the live filesystem would reveal the information that it's already 
&gt;&gt; installed.
&gt;
&gt; LOL! A simple probe? I have a 5Gb /usr partition. That's 5Gb of 
&gt; installed debian packages.

ls -l /usr/sbin/apache... error = not installed, no error = installed.

&gt; If I wanted to get a list of installed packages by scanning that lot, 
&gt; I'd be waiting for years. *Because* dpkg keeps it's own database of 
&gt; installed software, I can get that list within a useful period of &gt; time.

Bet the filesystem is better optimised for access than the internal 
database that dpkg is using. If I'm wrong, why not write dpkgfs and 
become famous?

&gt; I've not had to do that once in my 4+ years of using Debian.

You've never had to create a dummy package? Have you only ever used 
Debian's packages then?

&gt;&gt; Try and compile the latest Gnome sources and it's a massive exercise 
&gt;&gt; in frustration
&gt;
&gt; But surely that's an argument *for* binary distros, of which Debian is 
&gt; an example.

Not really. If Gentoo can compile Gnome source, there's no difficulty 
for the end user there.

It might help to understand that I'm pointing out a common deficiency, 
not championing any one distribution over another. I think all the 
distributions suck, all Unixs suck, and all computers suck. When 
they're functional to the level shown in Iain Banks' Culture series or 
Greg Egan's Diaspora, then I'll stop whinging.
