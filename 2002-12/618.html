Hi all,

Big thanks to Daryl and nik for helping me solve this one.



The Problem: As a preliminary to setting up an NFS server, I was making
sure that the portmapper for RPC was working as it should. However, the
command 'rpcinfo -p', which should show all the RPC services the
portmapper knows about, would time out.



The Details: Helpful hints suggested that I look at the
/etc/hosts.{allow,deny} and at my firewall rules. It was also suggested
that I use the 'rpcinfo -u' and 'rpcinfo -t' versions of the command
(see man page) to see if UDP/TCP worked independently. It turned out
that UDP did work, while TCP did not.

Finally, after turning on logging for my firewall rules, it was noted
that the 'rpcinfo -t' option was logging a denied packet that was the
REPLY from the portmapper service to the rpcinfo command.

As it turns out, it would appear that the rpcinfo command, when using
TCP, (sometimes?) sends a request to the portmapper (on port 111) using
a port number LESS THAN 1024.

Of course, I had firewall rules set up that denied access to ports less
than 1024, other than for services that I had specifically opened. The
fact that rpcinfo (sometimes?) uses a port number less than 1024
prevented 'rpcinfo -p' from working on the local host as a result.



The Solution: Don't firewall communications that are both to and from
127.0.0.1 on a machine.



Thanks again all!

This may seem a bit weird, but that's okay, because it is weird.
