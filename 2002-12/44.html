&gt; I've got a database (well, my employer does, anyway) that is,
&gt; unfortunately, a rather critical part of the business. It supports
&gt; over 350 retail stores nationwide; all the gory details like sales,
&gt; blah, blah, blah.


&gt; To give you an idea of what's involved:
&gt; 
&gt; * There's a Windows-based interface to the database, giving all of our
&gt;   users buttons to press in order to get the reports that they want. 
&gt;   Everything that you'd want to know, particularly financially, about
&gt;   a particular store or the organisation as a whole, seems to live
&gt;   here. 

You could build all the report generation stuff into a series of
Perl scripts and put them on an internal web server - with session
based logins - so they could be accessed by all clients/customers 
inhouse or via dialup.

&gt; * About 30 users in different areas of the country are sent a few CDs
&gt;   containing the entire database, which they then load onto their
&gt;   laptops, each week. Yeuck.

This could be achieved by a similar set of Perl scripts but using
flat text file DBI interface... (include the Perl installer for
windows clients)
 
&gt; * Another Windows-based utility dials into cash registers weekly,
&gt;   sucking out sales data and feeding it back into the database. I
&gt;   daresay that the entire project (when it does eventually get going)
&gt;   will involve working out a better way of doing that. Making 300+ STD
&gt;   calls each week gets reasonably pricey. I'd reckon that the Internet
&gt;   could be involved.

It would be possible to use an Internet connection over a VPN
to dump updates to a data collection point then update that to
your main database...

&gt; At this stage, I'm particularly interested in hearing about people's
&gt; experiences and recomendations when it comes to database servers. I've
&gt; been thinking PostgreSQL from the Open Source world, and probably
&gt; Oracle from the commercial world, as options.

PostreSQL will scale comforatbly with sensible table design,
even with a couple of million rows per table...

MySQL is fast, but slower with lots of users, 
PostgreSQL does row locking, MySQL does table locking 
so think of speed versus concurrent users.

&gt; My knowledge of Btreive is fairly minimal (and I'd like to keep it
&gt; that way, thank-you-very-much), so I thought I'd ask: has anyone had
&gt; any experience in moving data out of Btrieve and into a more
&gt; heavy-duty SQL server like PostgreSQL or Oracle? How much hair do you
&gt; have left?

I might suggest you have a look at the DBI interface that Perl offers,
IIRR there was talk about it a couple of years ago.

&gt; If anyone has any general comments and/or ramblings, please; I'd love
&gt; to hear from you. It makes it look as though I'm doing something,
&gt; which pleases my boss ;-)

While I am not a fully fledged Perl coder, I would suspect that a
Perl data munging type tool on a windows client would be capacble
of extracting the data from your existing database and then inserting
it into you new shiny SQL DB on a Linux/BSD/Solaris box...

cheers,

Kim
