&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a spread for toast that is derived from meat products. Australians
&gt;&gt;&gt; seem to love it but everyone else hatest it. You can probably find it
&gt;&gt;&gt; over in Canada :-)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Meat Products?!!?  I always thought, from fairly relaible sources, that it
&gt;&gt; was made from the leftover yeast from making beer.  Anyone who has made home
&gt;&gt; brew will know about the yeast paste that settles on the bottom of the brew
&gt;&gt; barrel.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anyone in a better position to confirm this?
&gt;
&gt; Vegemite is indeed made from yeast waste (what would otherwise have
&gt; gone into XXXX I believe).
&gt;
&gt; Bovril, an English version is made from trypsinised (read
&gt; enzymatically digested) cows. Tastes sort of the same - lots of
&gt; salt, but a bit beefyer.

No, Bovril is not the English version of Vegemite.  That's undoubtedly
Marmite, which is also a yeast extract.

&gt;&gt; The yeast extract spread we all know and love first appeared on our
&gt;&gt; shelves in 1923. It was made from many essential ingredients apart
&gt;&gt; from yeast extract.

Much as I hate to admit it, Vegemite is just a clone of Marmite.
Follow the link above for relative dates.  Even the name was adapted.
Vegemite doesn't mean anything; Marmite is the French word for "stock
pot".

More interesting is why Vegemite is so popular here.  I used to eat
Marmite when I lived in the UK, but most of the Poms thought I was
crazy.  Even more interesting is that the original extract was
developed in Germany by the chemist Justus von Liebig.  There's not
much trace of his stuff in Germany any more.
