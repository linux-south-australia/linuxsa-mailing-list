Yeah, they picked up a leak from the FBI.

I received this from a reliable family friend this morning. 10/28/01 BIG
TROUBLE !!!! DO NOT OPEN "Microsoft Windows" It is a virus that will erase your
whole hard drive. It will come to you in the form of a CD-ROM from a familiar
person. I repeat a friend sent it to me, but called and warned me before I
opened it. He was not so lucky and now he can't even start his computer!
Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would rather receive this 25
times than not not all. If you receive a CD called "Microsoft Windows" do not
open it. Delete it right away! This virus installs dynamic link libraries
(.dll files) on your computer. This is a serious one.
