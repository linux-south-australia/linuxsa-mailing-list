&gt;&gt; AUTH SERVER: 	*nix OS, hosting an LDAP directory
&gt;&gt; WINDOWS:		on the workstations only
&gt;&gt; UNIX:		PAM_LDAP to allow Unix systems to 
&gt;authenticate against
&gt;LDAP.
&gt;
&gt;This isn't out of the question.  Keeping right away from the Linux vs.
&gt;Microsoft debate, it makes more sense to me to implement a Windows
&gt;ActiveDirectory and incorporate Unix into it.  We run Windows Desktops,
&gt;and will also require at least one Windows server to support some
&gt;services.

It comes back to the age old "best tool for the right job".  That's 
why I suggested the above, not necessarily because it might be "best",
but just as another option if it fitted the situation.  Obviously if
you're running other MS server-based apps already then sticking with
ADS as the authentication server is probably the way to go, unless 
you're doing a wholesale migration of mail (Exchange??), proxy and so
forth all at the same time, good luck if you are ;)


&gt;To get the most out of the Windows environment for the users, using
&gt;Windows would allow me to do a lot more across the Windows side of
&gt;things when it comes down to implementing NT policies, or even
&gt;deployment of some software in the Microsoft part of our environment.

We run Win2000 desktops across the board, and while having the whole 
Group Policy scenario would be useful in some respects, when we weighed
up the pros & cons plus cost factors, it wasn't really worth it.  We still
load policies on login for Windows/Office settings, but this happens off
the Samba PDCs using poledit and templates, however this is still 
limited in comparison with the full GPO management from a central source, 
but it does what we want.

As far as application management, there are a number of different products
out there, like Altiris etc, they can integrate with MS server systems or
run their own management consoles, heck you could even buy a Novell box so
you
can run Zenworks :) j/k

The bottom line is that Windows workstations do interoperate better with
Windows servers (funny bout that.... :P ), it's just a matter of doing the
sums
and working out what suits your particular situation, and if a box running
Windows 2000/XP/.NET server with ADS suits and fits the (large) budget, then
who's going to argue if it works?
