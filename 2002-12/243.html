Hiya...

I'm trying to do something that might sound really wierd, but it really does
have a good reason behind it.

Basically, the end result I want is to have a machine on my home network act
as if it was part of a remote samba domain, complete with a correct IP,
profiles, the lot.  Just like if it was physically plugged in.

What I've done is to setup poptop (pptp server) on the gateway on the remote
end, running Debian (which is also the PDC), and I can successfully VPN into
it from my XP workstation and act just as if I was on the local network.

I figured if I ran XP inside a VMWare virtual machine, I could trick it into
thinking that the VPN connection was its network connection, and I'd have a
machine acting just like it was on that network (and successfully finding
the domain controller, etc.)

Its not as easy as I thought ;-(

VMWare seems to want to use my network card (and NOT the VPN connection)
when I set it to bridged, NAT doesn't do what I want at all (for obvious
reasons), and trying to set metrix's on the VPN interface doesn't seem to
do much at all either.

I'm completely lost.. anybody else ever done this / have any ideas on how it
could be done?

Thanks

R
