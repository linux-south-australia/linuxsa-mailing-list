So is either RH or Mandrake doomed?  I sincerely hope not.

It would just be another rallying cry for Uncle Bill to the security of
closed source (financial security - not network!)

&gt; I received this in my email today directly from Mandrakesoft:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Despite the many financial challenges of maintaining a fully open source
&gt;&gt; business model, MandrakeSoft has always followed the Free Software 
&gt;&gt; approach,
&gt;&gt; but in this normally joyful holiday season we are experiencing a serious
&gt;&gt; short-term cash crisis.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; This troubles me.
&gt;
&gt; Right now Mandrake is asking for financial help, and I hope that they 
&gt; receive it.
&gt;
&gt; I am concerned that their request for help might leave the general 
&gt; public with some general confusion that may dampen their effort to 
&gt; raise funds.
&gt;
&gt; Some people will hold that because Mandrakesoft is legally organized 
&gt; as a business, and not a public charity, that this is a bad 
&gt; investment, and not see it for what it is: a request for donations.
&gt;
&gt; That being said, I feel very stronly that Mandrake should follow 
&gt; Debian's lead and organize as a not-for-profit public charity.

&gt; I have also read recent reports that Red Hat has turned a profit this 
&gt; quarter.
&gt;
&gt; But I have also noticed that a Robert Young has been selling his Red 
&gt; Hat shares in a spurt that started on 8-29

&gt;
&gt; I will continue, I have to go to a clients...
&gt;

Ok, I am back.

Now the suprt of stock sales may be just a coincidence.


Anyway, here are the results from last quarter...

It appears that they lost 1,951,000, last quarter, so this report looks 
doable:

One nore of Red Hat's financial statement notes was interesting:

&gt; NOTE 6—Discontinued Operations
&gt; During January 2002, the Company adopted a formal plan to discontinue 
&gt; its network consulting operations. Accordingly, the network consulting 
&gt; operations were accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning 
&gt; with the fiscal year 2000 consolidated financial statements. The 
&gt; Company completed the disposal of the network consulting operations in 
&gt; February 2002 through termination of associated employees. Loss on 
&gt; disposal of discontinued operations of $10.3 million in fiscal year 
&gt; 2002 included the write-off of goodwill recorded in the acquisition of 
&gt; ENS of $9.6 million, severance and related costs of $0.4 million, and 
&gt; a provision against accounts receivable of $0.3 million. An additional 
&gt; provision against accounts receivable of $261,000 was recorded during 
&gt; the three months ended May 31, 2002. Network consulting revenues were 
&gt; $2.2 million and $6.4 million during the three and six months ended 
&gt; August 31, 2001, respectively.
