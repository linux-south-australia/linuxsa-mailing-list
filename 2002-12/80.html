Hi.

Just a note to you guys to say ThankYou! 

Your discussion of nagios prompted me to investigate, and I have to say
this is the most empowering thing I have done on the wan for a long time.
On top of that, it has been a pleasure to implement. (that doesn't mean
'cinch' it means 'clear, achievable and logical') I now have the
beginnings of a central place to monitor my linux and windows servers,
routers, switches and printers. Joy!

I have nearly 40 hosts, and 100 services monitored now. The ease of adding
monitoring to this thing from varied sources is a revelation. Why isn't
all software like this?

Regards,

Michael

&gt; &gt; If i want to write a script or something that does this exploration that i
&gt; &gt; want, what on earth would i use to generate the graphics for a web page.
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't get carried away with graphics.  The maps are useful
&gt; for newcomers, but text screens tend to be more useful once people
&gt; know the topology.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; all i want to monitor is basically a periodic ping as we don't care about
&gt;  &gt; services at this stage...
&gt; 
&gt; You'll need to monitor at least the DNS service.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; i've used jpgragh to generate a graph of ping times with averages, quite
&gt; &gt; proud of that  :)
&gt; &gt; cheers to the jpgraph boys.
&gt; 
&gt; More commonly, MRTG is used to monitor SNMP variables independently
&gt; of Nagios.  The number of SNMP variables you need to monitor for
&gt; capacity planning and finding the cause of faults is truly astounding
&gt; and you don't want all these cluttering up Nagios.
&gt; 
&gt; The other bit of recommended software is gnokki and a old mobile
&gt; phone.  Then nagios can SMS you with network faults, even when the
&gt; network is really, really broken.
&gt; 
&gt; Installing good network monitoring and recording is really,
&gt; really worth the effort.  Every time AARNet extends its
&gt; network monitoring efforts we find out something really
&gt; useful -- to the extent that we've improved TCP goodput
&gt; on the network by 4 or 5 times.  Put another way, we could
&gt; be paying for five times the current capacity if we had
&gt; less monitoring.
