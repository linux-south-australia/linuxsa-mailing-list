&gt;It seems that my current ideal setup looks like the following:
&gt;
&gt;WINDOWS:	Windows 2000 ActiveDirectory domain containing users and
&gt;groups.
&gt;UNIX:		PAM_NTDOM to allow Unix systems to authenticate against
&gt;an NT Domain.
&gt;SAMBA:	SAMBA possibly using XFS, which supports ACLs

Just out of curiosity, not being critical or anything as we're looking
at similar options with directory services, but why wouldn't you consider
the
following (unless you absolutely have to have Win2k server for other apps):

AUTH SERVER: 	*nix OS, hosting an LDAP directory

WINDOWS:		on the workstations only

UNIX:			PAM_LDAP to allow Unix systems to authenticate
against LDAP.

SAMBA:		SAMBA possibly using XFS, which supports ACLs, and
authenticating
			against the same LDAP directory.

To my mind and from what I've gathered from others who have used ADS, it's
no
cakewalk, and tends to be a little inflexible compared to similar *nix based
options.  Maybe I talk to the wrong people, but nothing I've heard in the
same
sentences as Windows ADS makes me want to consider it for our needs.
However, as
I haven't had any first hand experience with it, I'll be the first to admit
that
I could be wrong in my assumptions.


&gt;Suddenly, it seems so simple.  At least for testing.  It'll 
&gt;still take a great deal of testing and running in yet :-)

Everything's simple in theory, theoretically speaking of course :)


&gt;I'll keep the list posted as to my progress, because I'm still a little
&gt;nervous about taking this venture ;)

Maybe a little toast & vegemite will calm the nerves......heh heh ;)
