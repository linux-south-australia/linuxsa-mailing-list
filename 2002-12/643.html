&gt; &gt; It's worth noting that Macs are not "Macs" anymore.

&gt; &gt; In the same way that installing Linux onto a PC means it has absolutely
&gt; &gt; nothing in common with a Windows machine, the current OS X Macs have
&gt; &gt; absolutely nothing in common with MacOS machines.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd agree with that from the perspective of the underlying software.
&gt; 
&gt; However, the Apple philosophy (which has alway been circumventable -
&gt; though note some difficulty more recently eg.
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.resexcellence.com/hack_html_01/04-23-01.shtml">http://www.resexcellence.com/hack_html_01/04-23-01.shtml</A>). They still
&gt; believe that you don't need or want to know and that should should sit
&gt; down and shut up. I recall at one of the pre-release developer showings of
&gt; MacOS X at Adelaide Uni that Apple weren't convinced that the terminal
&gt; should be included in the standard release.
&gt; 
&gt; In that regard MacOS X is still very much a MacOS.

I remember that Apple were pretty parsimonious in handing out
information to programmers, as well as users. The company where I came
into contact with Macs were doing mainly word-processing type stuff.
So we had enough programming manuals to write things like word
processors, but we couldn't, for instance, have written any networking
software.

I think it's something of a shame that Apple have always had such a
small share of the market; I would find it nicer if the machines which
sold in telephone numbers and were correspondingly cheap were based on
the 68000 rather than the 8086. It's a much nicer chip to program, and
it doesn't have this demented segmented memory architecture which
screwed up the PC for so long. But I'd have been absolutely gasping
for Linux to come along and give me my command line back and some
decent docs.
