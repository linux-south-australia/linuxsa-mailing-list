&gt; This is SuSE Linux 8.1 Professional, but is probably not isolated toSuSE

&gt;     * It appears that Codeweavers Cross Over Office 1.3.1 works best

&gt;       would not print Microsoft Office or Excel. However, this did make
&gt;       an excellent segway for using Open Office.
&gt;     * I couldn't resolve a dependency libcrypto.so.0 for Yahoo Instant
&gt;       Messenger, although I did follow the symbolic link instructions
&gt;       provided at Yahoo.com. I would give my eye candy addicts the java
&gt;       version, except that I don't know how to make something to click
&gt;       on for the icon lovers here.
&gt;
&gt; Of more use: APT for SuSE.
&gt;
&gt; Note that I found that the larger the list of packages to install, the
&gt; more I favored using the CD's because I knew how to pick more than one
&gt; package at a time. As a result, it was a lot faster for me to use it.

This is where synaptic excels....you can pick and choose.


&gt; 1. Synaptic is far too buggy for practical use, it crashes often.
&gt;
&gt; 2. The SuSE apt repository had a few dependency differences then what my
&gt; system reported and it also used different build numbers. So, for the
&gt; short time I had used Synaptic it listed almost all of my packages
&gt; available for upgrade, but in reality the only difference was the build
&gt; number. It made the list ineffective.

It is working well here on both Suse 8.0 (version 0.24) and 8.1 (version 
0.26). Apt4rpm should be installed on a relatively new Operating System 
Install. This way it does not have to contend with software installed using 
tar.gz or rpm's installed using --force-nodeps. On a clean system it is 
excellent  and synaptic complements it very well.

&gt; Siga - This is a nice little application found in SuSE 8 & 8.1 and maybe
&gt; more. As root, simply type siga at the command prompt. Siga will display
&gt; more than everything you ever wanted to know about your computer's
&gt; hardware and Linux software. It will produce a text file and HTML file
&gt; in /tmp.  You can copy this file over to your hme directories and change
&gt; owners to the local user.
&gt;
&gt; LyX will import the text file, and if you print it, it will look like it
&gt; was professionally typeset.

Tried siga - I like : )
