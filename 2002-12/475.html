Yeah. A command line. I can get that with rescue disks too.

&gt; True, it was missing X which was a total pain
&gt; but I managed to work it out. I should note I'm not exactly a newbie.

That's not all it's missing. It's missing an entire set of installed 
software that is ready to use. Want another package? apt-get it, then 
you have to wade through its configuration files to get it going. 
That's not even starting on the issue of integration into the rest of 
the system.

&gt;&gt; advantage is eaten away by the braindead packaging system that Debian
&gt;&gt; insists on using, which depends on a library of archived details
&gt;&gt; rather than examining the live filesystem.
&gt;
&gt; Brain dead?

Very braindead. It violates the principle of "DRY" by having two sets 
of information which are then allowed to drift out of sync. There's the 
live filesystem, and there's an imitation filesystem in Debian's 
package database. When the live filesystem is changed, say, by an admin 
installing a hand compiled version of Apache, Debian's packaging system 
will still barf and want you to install the Apache package even though 
a simple probe of the live filesystem would reveal the information that 
it's already installed.

That's why people have to stuff around with dummy packages to update 
apt's internal database by manually forcing it to ape the live 
filesystem with ever increasing baggages of cruft and interdependence.

&gt;&gt; I cannot recommend Debian. It sucks, plain and simple.
&gt;
&gt; Own that. You mean: "I think it sucks, plain and simple.".

I wrote it. Or should I say "I think 'Of'. I think 'course'. I think 
'I'. I think 'own'. I think 'it'."?

&gt; ..a central repository style system? Huh? Sounds like archived details.
&gt; Debian's archived details tend to be binaries, Gentoo's source. This is
&gt; something that Dan Shearer touched on in a talk he gave at the last 
&gt; AUUG
&gt; meeting.

With respect to Dan, I think we're talking about different things here. 
Compiled source code generates binaries. To generate new binaries, you 
recompile the sources. Therefore it is possible to derive a system from 
source code without violating the DRY principle as there is one 
definitive source of information. Add another package, that's more 
source code. Download and install another program, that's more source 
code.

When it comes to Debian's database, you cannot generate binaries from a 
collection of file paths and date stamps. This information is available 
from the filesystem, so it is braindead to replicate the details. It 
would make more sense to probe and compare to an internal database that 
lists file level related dependencies rather than package level 
dependencies. Much of the same information would be kept, but it would 
be used a different way.

&gt; Miguel de Icaza is making a marketable product; kicking or screaming 
&gt; the
&gt; Linux community will eventually realise that it's not elitist and that
&gt; other people not so technically adept will want to use Linux.

That's a different argument. There are other ways of making good 
programs than imitating software techniques that have already been 
proven not to work. Try and compile the latest Gnome sources and it's a 
massive exercise in frustration with Gnome specific compilation 
switches being required from many common packages without any regard 
for how these packages may be configured elsewhere. This doesn't have 
much to do with Debian, but is more of a comment about how Ximian and 
Gnome chooses to approach software development.
