I agree and it looks exactly what I was after.
I'm looking forward to trying this out and the other many good
suggestions people took the time to post.

Thankyou
David
    &gt; As well as installing VNC (as many have suggested), this kind of
    &gt; functionality is built into The X Window System. If you have a machine
    &gt; with a display manager running (gdm, kdm or xdm) and it's configured
    &gt; to listen on a UDP socket (usually port 177), you can start your X
    &gt; Server(the part of X that's responsible for displaying stuff on the
    &gt; screen) like so:
    &gt; 
    &gt;   X -query 10.0.0.1
    &gt; 
    &gt; Where 10.0.0.1 is the machine that has the desktop you'd like to
    &gt; display. The advantage of this over VNC is that it's multi-user.
    &gt; 
    &gt; I use another cool X trick at home. I am running a few different
    &gt; versions of the following operating systems:
    &gt; 
    &gt;  Solaris
    &gt;  FreeBSD
    &gt;  NetBSD
    &gt;  OpenBSD
    &gt;  SCO (unixware and openserver)
    &gt;  Linux
    &gt; 
    &gt; As well as a few Windows boxen. When each of the (headless) UNIX
    &gt; machines boot, they start a display manager (the graphical login
    &gt; screeny thingo), which is configured to allow XDCMP queries (the X
    &gt; -query thing). I then have one of my machines accept indirect queries.
    &gt; This allows me to run the following command:
    &gt; 
    &gt;   X -indirect 10.0.0.1
    &gt; 
    &gt; On a NetBSD-pmax installation on a 20MHz DECStation. X starts, queries
    &gt; the machine 10.0.0.1, which broadcasts, looking to see which UNIX
    &gt; machines are running display managers and then gives my DECStation a
    &gt; list of machines to select from. I just click one and log in. Quite
    &gt; handy and quite usable over a 10Mb network (even over my
    &gt; Collision-Master 2000 hub).
    &gt; 
    &gt; Hope it helps,
    &gt; Matt
