I agree totally any broadband plan &lt; 1gb is dangerous and possibly
irresponsible on the ISPS part to even offer it. Justifying it by comparing
to dialup plans is really not correct as people will get thrilled with the
speed and will go further than they normally would in their browsing at
least until they get bored.

I have friends and family who are light users and would enjoy broadband
speeds but they would flip at the excess they would get hit with as they
would do &gt; 500mb in a month and you can't make it more expensive to
increase the allowance because it prices them out of the ball park.

&gt;Whilst the changes suit me and I am happy with an extra 1.5 gig, I am a bit
&gt;dissapointed that the low end of the plans didn't get anything modified at

&gt;
&gt;I was hoping that the 500 Meg plans would incorporate some form of shaping
&gt;( At the existing price point ). If that had happened both my Father and a
&gt;few friends who are not heavy users would have signed up. As it is I find it
&gt;too "dangerous" to suggest to anybody ( even low "once a internet" week
&gt;users ) that they sign up with the cheapest plan, as newbies are foolish and
&gt;can easily do something stupid like connect to s streaming video site to
&gt;watch the eclipse (or similar ) and end up racking up the downloads ( Excess
&gt;$$ ) too easily.
&gt;
&gt;Whilst there are people out there ( and lots of them ) that dont comprehend
&gt;Mb and Gb and that they are "downloading" when they use the Internet, I
&gt;would find it impossible to recommend a Cheap ADSL plan in the current
&gt;offering. Whilst Data caps are in place for many Dial up accounts, the
&gt;average home user is unlikely to reach them as they usually share the modem
&gt;line with their phone line, so dont stay connected for long periods.
&gt;
&gt;ADSL makes it too easy to end up with Excess usgage charges for the Stupid
&gt;or ill informed and until those users are shielded from their stupidy I for
&gt;one would find it hard to recommend them.
