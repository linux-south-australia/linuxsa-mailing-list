I don't recall Michael Moore stating either of the above in
the film (not that I have a perfect memory!), but anyway...

&gt; Sounds like a Hollywood Statistic.  Let's work the numbers, using
&gt; UN statistics from 1998.  [The UN doesn't collect these stats, it
&gt; only collates them from national agencies.  Errors would probably
&gt; understate US firearms, understate US firearm deaths.]
&gt; 
&gt;                     Canada     USA
&gt;   Population         30m      270m
&gt;   Firearms            7m      222m
&gt;   GUNS PER CAPITA    .25       .82
&gt; 
&gt; So "canada has more guns per captia than america" is false.

as I recall, in the film, he says the rate of gun ownership
between Canada and the US is roughly the same.
Perhaps it's changed since 1998 (date of your figures)?
don't know

&gt;                                            Canada    USA
&gt;   Firearms-related deaths, per 100,000       4.3    11.4
&gt; 
&gt; And "less than 1% of the gun deaths" is false.

well I don't recall him saying that in the film, but nevertheless
I just checked the website, www.bowlingforcolumbine.com
(have a look, and play the flash intro too)

His figures are:
guns deaths: Canada 165, USA 11,127
(he goes through more countries too, see the flash intro,
it's quite educational), so going by your population figures:

Canada 165 deaths / 30million people = 0.55 per 100,000
USA 11,127 deaths / 270million = 4.12 per 100,000

which I make to be 1/8th or 13%.

&gt; There's a good case for a simple correlation: "Canada has one-third
&gt; of the guns than the USA and Canada has one-third of the gun-related
&gt; deaths than the USA".

that conclusion is not in accordance with the figures presented
in the film.  In the film he doesn't mention per capita figures,
that I recall, as I remember thinking at the time that it would
be relevent to do so.

&gt;  &gt; this, from the movie, which I plan to see again next monday :)
&gt; 
&gt; Let's hope it wasn't a documentary.

it kind of is (except it doesn't readily fit into a simple
category IMO).  Just saw the review of it on the Movie Show
BTW, 5 stars from Margaret and 4.5 from David.  They also
featured a small interview with Michael Moore.

But don't get bogged down on the gun nut figures, the film
is about more than that, social justice, haves and have-nots,
american foreign policy, defence spending, the public health
system, something that seemed to be the equivalent of the
work-for-the-dole scheme, etc etc.  And that canadians leave
their doors unlocked and yanks lock themselves in even when
they're home (another quirky little thing I found amusing).

Dave.
