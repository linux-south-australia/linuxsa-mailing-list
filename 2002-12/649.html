Carrier Bird,

&gt; I think it's something of a shame that Apple have always had such a
&gt; small share of the market; I would find it nicer if the machines which
&gt; sold in telephone numbers and were correspondingly cheap were based on
&gt; the 68000 rather than the 8086. It's a much nicer chip to program, and
&gt; it doesn't have this demented segmented memory architecture which
&gt; screwed up the PC for so long. But I'd have been absolutely gasping
&gt; for Linux to come along and give me my command line back and some
&gt; decent docs.

Yes, the Motorola 68000 seems like a much more sane chip than the 8086
based chips. It also had nicer addressing models and was just generally
better.

It's a pity though that it's not always the technically best that end up
being the winners.
