&gt; I'd be interested to hear which services.

I'm not talking specifically fundamental network services, more like
"Application" services that run on Windows.
 
&gt; You'll actually find that things like profiles and policies 
&gt; are (on the server side at least) just files that are copied 
&gt; from the server and work no matter which platform the server 
&gt; is. Remote application deployment tools will also generally 
&gt; work in a similar fashion, rather than implement their own 
&gt; network protocols.

I agree -- But Windows 2000 allows me to configure a whole array of
"YES" and "NO" options which define what people are and aren't allowed
to do across the network.  Samba can't, as far as I am aware.  I doubt
these features are extremely important, but they can ease the pain a
little.  It seems more logical to implement a GPO than it is to change
some registry setting every time a user logs in, even though the end
result is probably the same thing.

&gt; We could talk for days about security, stability and 
&gt; scalability, but I think we're all sick of pointless 

These arguments are better served in an environment where one is going
to run "purely" Microsoft or "purely" Unix.  I'm only talking about one
server ;-)

&gt; Unix systems are typically much more flexible than most 
&lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; If you had a Windows server, how would you solve the problem?
&gt; 
&gt; How would you solve the problem on Novell's Netware?
&gt; 
&gt; How about Unix?

I'm arguing this kind of thing to my manager constantly.  I showed him
my RRDTool graphs that were monitoring my unix systems.  They were
impressed.  I told them this was not as nice to set up running on
Windows.

I showed them my RRDTool graphs that are logging disk usage every few
hours using RRDTool.  They were impressed.  Then I told them that at the
moment those RRDTool graphs were checking disk usage by running an
smbmount because there's no easy way to check disk space automagically
in Windows that I know of, unless you're using SNMP or something.

I think we're all aware how crap Windows is, and I get hell on this
Windows NT list all the time whenever I ask support because I
continually say "I never have problems like this with Unix . . ."

&gt; Standards are also a reason why one might choose a Unix 
&gt; system over anything else.

You mean I should throw out all my MS-RFC's?

:)



~~~~In response to Peter Freeman:

&gt; We run Win2000 desktops across the board, and while having the whole 
&gt; Group Policy scenario would be useful in some respects, when 
&gt; we weighed up the pros & cons plus cost factors, it wasn't 
&gt; really worth it.

Perhaps not.  My situation is going to call for running a Windows server
of some sort anyway, perhaps even for the pure convenience of having one
there to support anything that comes along.  If it's there, I might as
well utilize it.  The overall cost of software licensing will be
probably $2000 including Client Access Licensing, and while it's a cost,
it's not extraordinarily enormous.  It's enormous, but it's not
humungous.  Well, it's humungous,  but it's not ginormous.  Well, it's
ginormous, but it's not completely obscene.  Well, it's completely
obscene, but it won't send us bankrupt.

So if we're going to 'invest' (hmm choice of words...) in a Windows 2000
server for 'supporting' the Windows 2000 environment, it seems that we
can use the added 'features' of Windows across the domain.

&gt; situation.  Obviously if you're running other MS server-based 
&gt; apps already then sticking with ADS as the authentication 
&gt; server is probably the way to go, unless 
&gt; you're doing a wholesale migration of mail (Exchange??), 
&gt; proxy and so forth all at the same time, good luck if you are ;)

Luckily we're not runnning too much of that slop.

&gt; The bottom line is that Windows workstations do interoperate 
&gt; better with Windows servers (funny bout that.... :P ), it's 
&gt; just a matter of doing the sums and working out what suits 
&gt; your particular situation, and if a box running Windows 
&gt; 2000/XP/.NET server with ADS suits and fits the (large) 
&gt; budget, then who's going to argue if it works?

It's sad but true, and I agree that the Windows desktop would probably
interoperate a lot better under a Windows Server environment, but you
know, I have no experience to back that up.  But I'm really talking
about the "Domain" environment.
