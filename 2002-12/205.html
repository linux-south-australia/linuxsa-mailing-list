&gt;Well I tried the experts and all I have left are you guys (no, I'm
&gt;joking.. lol)

That's if there's any brain cells left after the vegemite thread, hard
work reading thru that lot ;)

&lt;skips bits about passwd synching, most interested in any replies tho...&gt;


&lt;shuffles a bit around to suit the thought processes.... ;) &gt;

&gt;I am imagining that moving our current NT system over to Samba is going
&gt;to be nightmarish, and is going to take careful planning to be
&gt;successfully achieved in one swift motion.

If careful planning isn't undertaken then you're probably guaranteed of
a nightmare, however you'll probably find (not knowing how complex you're
exising NT setup is...) that you lost all that sleep for nothing.  Most 
of the hard work in migrating is done with scripts to export/import users
and so forth.  The only big issue you'll likely have is folder/permission
structure, unless there are utilities around to migrate this info.  If there
is I'll be a bit annoyed that I didn't know about them before now... :)

We recently migrated one of our sites from NT PDC to Samba (40 odd wkstns), 
apart from the issues of rejoining PCs to the new domain there were very 
few teething problems.  The old NT system had no roaming profiles which we 
implemented under the Samba system and so far, fingers crossed, this has 
been working pretty well.



&gt;We're about to purchase a file server with a rather large amount of
&gt;storage space in it.  I'd like to run FreeBSD on it.  I've set up Samba
&gt;several times before and I'm quite comfortable in using it, 
&gt;however I've
&gt;never used it on a corporate scale.  I'm very wary of what I 
&gt;should look
&gt;out for when it comes to managing a "Windows-like" environment under
&gt;Samba.
&gt;
&gt;According to what I am aware of, under Unix you have permissions that
&gt;are divided into OWNER/GROUP/EVERYONE.  If I have a file that is, for
&gt;example:
&gt;
&gt;-rwxr--r--   1 adam  www    8030 Nov 25 22:00 index.php
&gt;
&gt;It's readwriteexecute by adam, readable by 'www,' and readable by
&gt;everyone else.
&gt;
&gt;How do you modify permissions to incorporate multiple group-level
&gt;access?  I've read somewhere once, that Samba supports "NT-Like"
&gt;permissions.  I am curious about it, but could live with Unix
&gt;permissions as required.

You'll need to investigate Samba and ACLs.  Up until recently we haven't
run any of our Samba sites with full ACL capabilities.  Now that I've had it
running in a few sites with no problems I'd never go back to Unix user/group
permissions.  I am unsure of how FreeBSD handles acls at the filesystem
level
as my experience has only been with the Linux implementation.

As far as managing the ACLs post-implementation, the easiest way
is with a root-level share at the base level of your samba shares.  This is
accessible ONLY by a specific group, IT admins only in our case, and the
force
user parameter is set to "root".  Then you can use a normal Win2k
workstation
and the file security tools to manage the permissions for the whole tree.

The other issue you'll have is backing up the ACL structure, again I'm
unsure
of the implications on FreeBSD, but with the Linux utils you can export the
ACLs of an entire tree to a file, and restore them from the same file.
(This
is only necessary if you're backup software doesn't recognize ACLs)
