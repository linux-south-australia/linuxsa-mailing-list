Are there any?

I would gladly use ANY alternative to Telstra for local telephone
lines? All I want is a frickin phone line so I can get ADSL on it. I
don't even want to make phone calls. Telstra has been a right pain in
the arse. My experiences have been as follows:

1) Called their 13 22 00 number to get line connected. After waiting
for 15 mins or so, got told to call back the next day, as their
computers had crashed.

2) Called again, and the trained monkey on the other end of the line
(sorry, I'm feeling bitter -- hope it's not showing too much) couldn't
handle the fact that the place where I live has multiple buildings,
and the building I am in used to have a phone line connected, but no
longer does, and I didn't know the number of the old phone line
anyway. She kept asking me to go home and call from home so she could
tell what number I would be calling from so she'd know which line to
re-enable. I kept telling her my home number (which is connected to a
PABX that has an OnRamp 30 behind it, as well as a few analogue
lines, none of which I can use, as they are already in use), and she
said that that's an ISDN number... I knew that. She couldn't grasp the
fact that I needed a _new_ phoneline in an old building. This took
about an hour, including 30 minutes of waiting for service, listening
to musak. Was told that I would see someone connecting my line on
Monday (today).

3) Called back again the following day, as requested, to tell them
what the old number was. They told me that that line was already
connected to this address, and I told them that I knew that, but it
went to a different building, and was integrated into the PABX anyway.
They patronisingly informed me that I would have to get a new line.
Thanks. They said the linesman would be here on Monday (today).

4) Worked from home, putting a few things off until tomorrow, so I
could see the Telstra techo, let him in, and tell him where to stick
it (er... the phone connection, that is), but by the time it got to
2:30pm, I decided to spend another half hour on hold, to find out that
he's coming tomorrow. I said that's not good, as I had been told
today, and asked to make a complaint. She said OK, could you hold. I
held for another 10 mins, and then she said OK, thanks... I asked what
she had been doing all that time, and apparently, she was writing the
complaint. Bizzare.

I'm quite pissed off now. On principle, I would choose to cancel the
Telstra connection, and get ANY other company to do it instead. I have
no other way of letting them know that I am not happy. I spent half my
day at home, rather than at work, just so they could come tomorrow.
How crap is that?

Alas, our brain-dead Government wants to maintain a non-competitive
monopoly on local lines, so it can inflate the T3 sale price, and buy
more votes. Why is it that I feel so disenfranchised? Snuh. Show me
the protest march!
