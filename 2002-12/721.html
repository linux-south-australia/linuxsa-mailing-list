Well I finally got my system to behave and got Lycoris Desktop?LX beta build 66 working. The problem was a poor burn with the CD-RW my son regularly abuses &lt;sigh&gt;

The previous version I was running, build 52, was great but since that build they have really been doing some background work.

For starters I was able to do a full probe install, last time I had to set it to not probe as there was some incompatibly with my HP Pavilion 6425. Now I just set it running and it went straight through without a hiccup. 

Then the opening page comes up and it looks the same except there is an offer to do a tour. Do I need this? OK, so lets be the newbie and tour. 

WOW! A full Flash experience starts up, a friendly voice describes what I am seeing on the screen and I am taken through most of the features and the setup routines for several vital options. These folks are serious about making this a great desktop experience.

The backgrounds are a newer collection and really something to see. The icons and graphics are still as great as before and the basic setup leaves nothing out that an average desktop user might be looking for.

A hiccup came when I wanted to build a new rescue disk. I caught the problem of having to unmount/mount the floppy till I found one of my older disks that would format properly. How is a newbie supposed to know this &lt;sigh&gt;

Another hiccup is that it doesn't seem to want to install on my lower spec machines - P166 with 1.2 G drives. Pity.

I know it is beta but the release version is not far away and if this is any indication then the release is going to show up on quite a few desktops. It really is a great distribution. I expect the release (with KDE 3 expected to be included) is going to be something else.

Oh, did I say desktop? It isn't meant to be a server though it has great network capability even Desktop Sharing and Remote Help as options. It is a Desktop distribution aimed at helping a newcomer to Linux feel right at home. It achieves this target very well and I am very happy with it.

Anyone looking for a CD can ask the Community Software Network for their nearest distributor around South Australia. Or email me and we can make arrangements. Or download your own.
