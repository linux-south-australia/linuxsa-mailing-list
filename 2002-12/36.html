I thought that there might be a few people around these parts that
might be able to share a few pearls of wisdom when it comes to
migrating databases.

I've got a database (well, my employer does, anyway) that is,
unfortunately, a rather critical part of the business. It supports
over 350 retail stores nationwide; all the gory details like sales,
blah, blah, blah.

It's not your regular retail management system, as it was designed, in
house, years and years ago. Needless to say, the database has grown
somewhat, and the current format, Btrieve, is somewhat lacking. The
fact that we're constantly having locking problems (not to mention
interoperability issues -- who supports Btrieve these days?) combined
with the fact that all query processing and report generation is done
on client machines has lead me to start investigating moving this
database to a slightly more robust backend.

To give you an idea of what's involved:

* There's a Windows-based interface to the database, giving all of our
  users buttons to press in order to get the reports that they want. 
  Everything that you'd want to know, particularly financially, about
  a particular store or the organisation as a whole, seems to live
  here. 

* About 30 users in different areas of the country are sent a few CDs
  containing the entire database, which they then load onto their
  laptops, each week. Yeuck.

* Another Windows-based utility dials into cash registers weekly,
  sucking out sales data and feeding it back into the database. I
  daresay that the entire project (when it does eventually get going)
  will involve working out a better way of doing that. Making 300+ STD
  calls each week gets reasonably pricey. I'd reckon that the Internet
  could be involved.

At this stage, I'm particularly interested in hearing about people's
experiences and recomendations when it comes to database servers. I've
been thinking PostgreSQL from the Open Source world, and probably
Oracle from the commercial world, as options.

My knowledge of Btreive is fairly minimal (and I'd like to keep it
that way, thank-you-very-much), so I thought I'd ask: has anyone had
any experience in moving data out of Btrieve and into a more
heavy-duty SQL server like PostgreSQL or Oracle? How much hair do you
have left?

If anyone has any general comments and/or ramblings, please; I'd love
to hear from you. It makes it look as though I'm doing something,
which pleases my boss ;-)

TIA,

   - andrew
