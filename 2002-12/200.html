&gt; Here come the bits about password synchronization:
&gt; --------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; According to what I've read, this can be done with PAM on the Unix side
&gt; of things, and something like Microsoft's "Services for Unix."  What
&gt; other alternatives are there to "Services for Unix?"  How do they rate
&gt; in comparison?  I had a package called Cygwin referred to me but from
&gt; what I've read I don't think it supports password synchronization.  I
&gt; don't think that running Services for Unix would be a problem, and
&gt; ideally it's probably preferred because who better than Microsoft to
&gt; know how to integrate something into Windows?  Funly enough, it makes
&gt; sense.  Their closed-source environment has made me feel like I can
&gt; trust their product better than any third party's in this case.

Cygwin does nothing for you in this area. What you probably want to do is 
to make the Win2K DC carry all the accounts and password hashes, or use 
LDAP. Using LDAP might me more work than you want peform right now. 
PAM_NTDOM will allow your UNIX users to authenticate against a Win2K DC 
and to modify their passwords from UNIX if you need to.
 
&gt; (Here come some questions! . . .)
&gt; 
&gt; Once installed, how exactly does this process work?  
&gt; If I have two systems running a flavour of Unix, what happens now when a
&gt; user changes his/her password?  

It is changed on the central password server.

&gt; According to a couple of MS Whitepapers on SFU, Windows changes the
&gt; password under NT, and then sends a request to PAM listening on all
&gt; relevant Unix boxes to synchronize the password.  What happens then?  Is
&gt; their password change rewritten in /etc/passwd?  Is some sort of system
&gt; function called that changes the password?

Don't listen to MS. That is the crapiest way to do it.

&gt; What happens to accounts that don't exist?  If I go about creating an
&gt; account under NT, do I then have to go and create it on -all- my Unix
&gt; boxen that require it?  What is the best way to address account
&gt; conformity across Unix?

Use winbindd. That way you never have to say sorry^W^Wcreate accounts on 
the UNIX machines.

&gt; 
&gt; Here come the bits about Samba:
&gt; -------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; We're about to purchase a file server with a rather large amount of
&gt; storage space in it.  I'd like to run FreeBSD on it.  I've set up Samba
&gt; several times before and I'm quite comfortable in using it, however I've
&gt; never used it on a corporate scale.  I'm very wary of what I should look
&gt; out for when it comes to managing a "Windows-like" environment under
&gt; Samba.
&gt; 
&gt; According to what I am aware of, under Unix you have permissions that
&gt; are divided into OWNER/GROUP/EVERYONE.  If I have a file that is, for
&gt; example:
&gt; 
&gt; -rwxr--r--   1 adam  www    8030 Nov 25 22:00 index.php
&gt; 
&gt; It's readwriteexecute by adam, readable by 'www,' and readable by
&gt; everyone else.
&gt; 
&gt; How do you modify permissions to incorporate multiple group-level
&gt; access?  I've read somewhere once, that Samba supports "NT-Like"
&gt; permissions.  I am curious about it, but could live with Unix
&gt; permissions as required.
&gt; I am imagining that moving our current NT system over to Samba is going
&gt; to be nightmarish, and is going to take careful planning to be
&gt; successfully achieved in one swift motion.

Current versions of Linux include ACLs which give you some compatibility 
with MS ACLs, but not full compatibility. FreeBSD 5.0 will also have ACLs.
