On Wed, 11 Dec 2002, stephen white wrote (&lt;snip&gt;ed in places):

&gt; I've re-read my original post to linuxsa, and I can see that it could
&gt; be perceived as an attack on Debian and Linux. I've seen so many names
&gt; of people I know in here that I assumed that I could answer an issue
&gt; without the usual disclaimers and apologies and caveats. I apologise
&gt; for this mistake.

fair 'nuff.

&gt; I use OS X because I want to concentrate on the task of writing my own
&gt; programs and I need a stable well documented platform. There are other
&gt; tradeoffs that Apple have made to achieve this, so I still have an
&gt; interest in Linux in order to ensure my continuing freedom to use
&gt; computers how I want. OS X allows me to develop working code, then port
&gt; it to Linux so I can stage the development process into two parts.

I'd have to say that of the OSes I've used, Debian has probably the best
documentation (leaving aside CP/M where I had the entire source in the
back of the User Reference Guide and the C64 where I had the whole memory
map, system call set and circuit diagrams in third party books and the
reference manual - sigh).

&gt;  From what you have said about your brother, OS X sounds like what he's
&gt; looking for. I don't think Linux is really suitable for the
&gt; point'n'click crowd yet, so a premature hustle towards a hard core
&gt; hacker's distribution will only result in disappointment. If he sees OS
&gt; X and thinks "that's Unix", then he may have more understanding of why
&gt; you like Linux so much.

There are other issues in 3rd world software sourcing that that though.
Probably (if he had a Mac), I would suggest he use OS X, provided he
avoided the wildly broken MS apps that seem to have been foisted on the
Mac community in the transition from 9 to X. However, the greater concern
is a transition away from proprietary software:

quoting Irfan Kortschak:
&gt; Now that I think about it, I once did an article on a couple of very
&gt; sweet university kids here who set up a little linux consultancy a few
&gt; years back. Later, they did extraordinarily well for themselves, some
&gt; angle on the dot.com hysteria that I couldn't quite catch. They have
&gt; established a fairly loud lobby group, trying to convince the government
&gt; to promote linux as a cheap alternative to microsoft products and thus
&gt; making compliance with intellectual rights economically possible.
&gt;
&gt; At the moment, everyone still just uses pirated software. You can buy
&gt; compilations in our local market, right next to where the carrots come
&gt; in.

This is concordant with my own experiences in Nepal where I helped an NGO
with their IT infrastructure. After about a week I asked the boss if they
were worried about being sued for all the copyright violations they had
(/everything/ was pirated). His response was that Nepal is one of the 25
poorest countries in the world and that there was nothing the software
companies could take. However, the world is changing, and particularly in
emerging (re-emerging? after the Asian collapse) economies, DRM issues
could seriously hamper economic development if the software giants can
lobby strongly enough to force trade sanctions on countries that allow
extensive software piracy (as was seen a while back in China resulting in
that government cracking down - at least in appearance - on piracy).

anyway, enough from me.

cheers
Dan
