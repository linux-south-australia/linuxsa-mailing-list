&gt; &gt; Sybase can do this - very well actually.  Can I brag a bit?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  dbid  dbname         segmap dlog size      sizemb notused devname      phyname
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  ----- -------------- ------ ---- --------- ------ ------- ------------ -----------------
&gt; &gt;      9 event               3 data   1024000   2000    667  xisdata4     /dev/rxisdata4
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;      9 event               3 data   1024000   2000    948  xisdata5     /dev/rxisdata5
&gt;
&gt; Out of curiosity, can it write to files as well as physical volumes?

yep.  we use a file (/tempdb/tempdb) for the tempdb (see that coming? :)) and in ibm land, it gets
its own little section of the shark.  this way, you get benifet of the shark's cacheing, which is
unreal (like 96% read IIRC)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Out biggest DB by far: EFM  103997.0 MB
&gt;
&gt; &lt;DSWar brewing&gt;
&gt;
&gt; One of our clients has a 1.7 TB filesystem that takes roughly 20 hours
&gt; to back up to 3 LTO drives (it gets backed up once a week); it would

thats big, but does it accept 10,000 rows an hour as input? this input then goes through about 7
tables before coming to rest in the main storage table...

&gt; &gt; We are using IBM AIX (blech)
&gt;
&gt; I don't mind AIX - it's reasonably orthogonal in its non-standard Unix
&gt; command set (e.g. the disk management stuff), you can grow a JFS without
&gt; taking it offline (for HP it's a value added product), and tweak a lot
&gt; of its kernel settings without a reboot.


let me qualify.  the admin side is _unreal_.  I love it.  the FS is amazing, smit is not too
painfull, and interoperability (sp?) with other IBM gear rocks.

For me, I spend most of my days tracking down inconsistancies in the C libraries.  Like deciding
which malloc to use.  or finding out that IBM has a different idea of what a shared library is,
i.e. its not.  upgrading a .so should not require a recompile IMHO.

&gt; &gt; The Shark as it is known (<A HREF="http://www.storage.ibm.com/">http://www.storage.ibm.com/</A>) is amazing.
&gt;
&gt; Especially its fin.  :-)

especially the fin.  and apparently, this is the hardest thing to get out of them.  the sysop at
my client has a mini fin on his monitor, because he has $10 million of IBM gear :)


&gt;  The above client is in the process of having
&gt; one installed on their S390, and from the flight deck the protuding fin
&gt; is quite impressive.  I wonder if IBM include that in their physical
&gt; specs?

S390.  where does that stack up against the F80?  We have F80's S80's an S78 (dog) and an F50.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  SQL Server is built on Sybase, IIRC (either that or Ingres; I get the two confused),
&gt;
&gt; &gt; stolen is the right word there.
&gt;
&gt; Kind of goes without saying.  Microsoft have pulled this same stunt with
&gt; Spyglass (Internet Explorer) and a similar one with STAC (disk compression),
&gt; as well as other products.  Up until 7.0 you could still use Sybase's Unix
&gt; ODBC drivers to talk to SQL Server.

whats more - in sybase open/client API you can write RPCs, which in MSSQL with a little deft
wrapper, you've the DLL equivalent.  Everything is _exactly_ the same.  Made porting our product
to MSSQL quite easy actually :)

&gt;  If Microsoft can't acquire the company
&gt; to get into the marketspace (and thus own it outright), they'll "partner"
&gt; with the company until they've acquired the key technology and/or knowledge,
&gt; then it's "Bon Voyage" as they puncture the partner's floaties.

or even worse.  anyone out there who knows MIDI and the Amiga probably has heard of bars and pipes
professional which was quite simply the best thing ever ever ever.  MS bought it and shelved it. 
no more versions, no porting, no support and no more downloads (I'm happy to say that this is not
true any more - <A HREF="http://www.amigau.com/c-music/barsandpipes.htm">http://www.amigau.com/c-music/barsandpipes.htm</A>)


&gt; Andrew,  if your reading this, I just remembered one thing against SQL Server -
&gt; you can't run multiple instances of the database on one server.  If you buy
&gt; a grunty machine, and then decide to do a migration to a later version of
&gt; Sybase, then you'll need another machine to port to, rather that use any
&gt; spare capacity that your existing machine may have (plus CAL costs, etc.).

Sybase rocks for this.  5 dataservers on 6 CPUS works best for us :)
