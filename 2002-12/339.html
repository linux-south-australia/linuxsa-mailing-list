Out of curiosity, can it write to files as well as physical volumes?

&gt; Out biggest DB by far: EFM  103997.0 MB

&lt;DSWar brewing&gt;

One of our clients has a 1.7 TB filesystem that takes roughly 20 hours
to back up to 3 LTO drives (it gets backed up once a week); it would
take less time if we could get the theoretical maximum of 50 gig an hour
to the drives from the Suns like we can with the HP kit.  I think the
largest database on that is around 400 Gig.

&gt; We are using IBM AIX (blech)

I don't mind AIX - it's reasonably orthogonal in its non-standard Unix
command set (e.g. the disk management stuff), you can grow a JFS without
taking it offline (for HP it's a value added product), and tweak a lot
of its kernel settings without a reboot.

&gt; The Shark as it is known (<A HREF="http://www.storage.ibm.com/">http://www.storage.ibm.com/</A>) is amazing.

Especially its fin.  :-)  The above client is in the process of having
one installed on their S390, and from the flight deck the protuding fin
is quite impressive.  I wonder if IBM include that in their physical
specs?

&gt;&gt;  SQL Server is built on Sybase, IIRC (either that or Ingres; I get the two confused),

&gt; stolen is the right word there.

Kind of goes without saying.  Microsoft have pulled this same stunt with
Spyglass (Internet Explorer) and a similar one with STAC (disk compression),
as well as other products.  Up until 7.0 you could still use Sybase's Unix
ODBC drivers to talk to SQL Server.  If Microsoft can't acquire the company
to get into the marketspace (and thus own it outright), they'll "partner"
with the company until they've acquired the key technology and/or knowledge,
then it's "Bon Voyage" as they puncture the partner's floaties.

Andrew,  if your reading this, I just remembered one thing against SQL Server -
you can't run multiple instances of the database on one server.  If you buy
a grunty machine, and then decide to do a migration to a later version of
Sybase, then you'll need another machine to port to, rather that use any
spare capacity that your existing machine may have (plus CAL costs, etc.).
I have heard rumours that Microsoft were supposed to be introducing that
feature in the last release of SQL Server, but then that's typical of the
"Buy Us, We'll Eventually Get It Right" tactic that MS employ.
