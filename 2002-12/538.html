&gt; Perhaps I could make a general point to no one in particular that if

&gt; system

I've re-read my original post to linuxsa, and I can see that it could 
be perceived as an attack on Debian and Linux. I've seen so many names 
of people I know in here that I assumed that I could answer an issue 
without the usual disclaimers and apologies and caveats. I apologise 
for this mistake.

It's not hard for me to figure out that this point was addressed to me, 
as I'm the only one who has mentioned OS X (which is very different 
from MacOS). I've been using Linux for a long time, so I don't have any 
axes to grind, only technical comments about technical points.

I read the original complaint about Debian and answered the question of 
why there was a problem and why it wouldn't get better. There are 
fundamental flaws in the design of the Debian packaging system, not 
just the installer. Dan Shearer has explained a few more of the issues 
involved (eg, no specific identifiable upstream for sources).

There are other disadvantages stemming from the use of packaging 
systems, but I think this topic is a bit worn out already. I'll just 
mention that the main difficulty stems from trying to create a modular 
hierarchal system when the underlying code establishes arbitrary links 
between programs. If the combination of sendmail/procmail has been set 
up, it's very difficult to arbitrarily rip out sendmail and replace it 
with exim without needing to modify procmail's configuration files.

I use OS X because I want to concentrate on the task of writing my own 
programs and I need a stable well documented platform. There are other 
tradeoffs that Apple have made to achieve this, so I still have an 
interest in Linux in order to ensure my continuing freedom to use 
computers how I want. OS X allows me to develop working code, then port 
it to Linux so I can stage the development process into two parts.

Without Linux and BSD, Apple could choose to go down the path of DRM or 
any number of other unsavoury schemes. The fact is that OS X couldn't 
exist without Linux/BSD providing the original sources that Apple have 
massaged and documented into a single system. I'm anticipating that I 
will migrate back to Linux at some point, when I can read documentation 
that says "the file can be found at /etc/blah/blah" and it'll actually 
be there.

&gt; I just got a not from my brother saying he was going to go with RH (he
&gt; says the CDs are readily available there - I'm sure others are too
&gt; though). So I'm a bit disappointed that he hasn't gone with a debian 
&gt; based
&gt; system (dispite the venomous garbage being spouted by some on this 
&gt; group
&gt; about the quality of debian).

 From what you have said about your brother, OS X sounds like what he's 
looking for. I don't think Linux is really suitable for the 
point'n'click crowd yet, so a premature hustle towards a hard core 
hacker's distribution will only result in disappointment. If he sees OS 
X and thinks "that's Unix", then he may have more understanding of why 
you like Linux so much.
