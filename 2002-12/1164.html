who cares?  Microsoft ripped off Apple, Apple ripped off Xerox and the
circle just goes around and around.  Just a whole bunch of people ripping
off each others user interfaces because the previous group did not market or
sell their ideas properly - either to a community (i.e. - open source) or
commercially.

I think a decent interface on Linux that people without PhD's in computer
science can actually operate is not an unhealthy thing.

The windows interface works, it's easy to understand - it's just good.
Linux can learn a lot from the user friendliness of Windows..

&gt; Rant: 'Linux is too much like Windows'
&gt; By ron carlson, Insanely Great Mac
&gt; December 22nd 2002
&gt;
&gt;  Once every other blue moon Dvorak says something intelligent
&gt;
&gt;  In a column titled "Microsoft, Innovation, and Linux", John
&gt;  Dvorak opines that "Linux is too much like Windows." That
&gt;  this is true is obvious and it's a matter of some wonder
&gt;  that no one -- at least no one notable -- has publicly noted
&gt;  this before.
&gt; &lt;&lt;------------------------
&gt;
&gt; I think he and Dvorak have got it wrong but that is just my POV, what
&gt; are your thoughts on the matter?

I think they're right, for a certain definition of "Linux".  What does
the average user see?  The screen.  And the applications that people
use are looking more and more like Microsoft: Gnome and KDE imitate
the Microsoft screen layout, OpenOffice and AbiWord repeat the
mistakes Microsoft made with its user interface approach.

These applications have their uses to attract people from the
Microsoft space.  But more and more Linux (and BSD) people are using
them, and that's not healthy.  You can't beat Microsoft at its own
game, but come with a different game and you might be able to.  The
real issue is, what would a desktop approach based on UNIX principles
look like?

At the last AUUG conference, I asked Rob Pike (of the Plan 9 project)
what he thought of the free UNIX operating systems.  He said he was
disappointed how little innovation they had shown.
