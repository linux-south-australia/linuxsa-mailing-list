Hey all,

I'm going to give you a run down of some thoughts going around my head,
and because I've never done any of the things outlined below before, and
some of you probably have, I'd love to get some feedback to make sure
I'm heading our company in the right directions.


Our current project at work is getting Windows and Unix to interoperate
better.  We are undergoing a reasonable topology change and I figured I
would talk to the experts to get any feedback on what we want to do.
Well I tried the experts and all I have left are you guys (no, I'm
joking.. lol)

Anyway, I've been running FreeBSD and Red Hat in our network environment
for probably a year or so.  I've migrated services from a Windows
environment over to Unix, and the most significant one was moving our
ERP system over from Windows NT to Red Hat (where it now runs like a
dream, rather than crashing once a week.)  Other services such as
(DNS/DHCP/Routing/Proxy/Firewall/Faxing/Intranet) have all moved to
FreeBSD.

We are now basically operating in two 'separated' environments.  One, a
unix environment, and two, a Windows NT 4.0 Domain.  The users currently
authenticate against Unix when logging into our ERP system, and Windows
for everything else.  I think our best option is to run a 2K Domain
which has the ability to synchronize passwords to the Unix systems.
That way if a user changes her domain password, that change is apparent
on all systems, Windows and Unix alike.


Here come the bits about password synchronization:
--------------------------------------------------

According to what I've read, this can be done with PAM on the Unix side
of things, and something like Microsoft's "Services for Unix."  What
other alternatives are there to "Services for Unix?"  How do they rate
in comparison?  I had a package called Cygwin referred to me but from
what I've read I don't think it supports password synchronization.  I
don't think that running Services for Unix would be a problem, and
ideally it's probably preferred because who better than Microsoft to
know how to integrate something into Windows?  Funly enough, it makes
sense.  Their closed-source environment has made me feel like I can
trust their product better than any third party's in this case.

(Here come some questions! . . .)

Once installed, how exactly does this process work?  
If I have two systems running a flavour of Unix, what happens now when a
user changes his/her password?  
According to a couple of MS Whitepapers on SFU, Windows changes the
password under NT, and then sends a request to PAM listening on all
relevant Unix boxes to synchronize the password.  What happens then?  Is
their password change rewritten in /etc/passwd?  Is some sort of system
function called that changes the password?
What happens to accounts that don't exist?  If I go about creating an
account under NT, do I then have to go and create it on -all- my Unix
boxen that require it?  What is the best way to address account
conformity across Unix?


Here come the bits about Samba:
-------------------------------

We're about to purchase a file server with a rather large amount of
storage space in it.  I'd like to run FreeBSD on it.  I've set up Samba
several times before and I'm quite comfortable in using it, however I've
never used it on a corporate scale.  I'm very wary of what I should look
out for when it comes to managing a "Windows-like" environment under
Samba.

According to what I am aware of, under Unix you have permissions that
are divided into OWNER/GROUP/EVERYONE.  If I have a file that is, for
example:

-rwxr--r--   1 adam  www    8030 Nov 25 22:00 index.php

It's readwriteexecute by adam, readable by 'www,' and readable by
everyone else.

How do you modify permissions to incorporate multiple group-level
access?  I've read somewhere once, that Samba supports "NT-Like"
permissions.  I am curious about it, but could live with Unix
permissions as required.
I am imagining that moving our current NT system over to Samba is going
to be nightmarish, and is going to take careful planning to be
successfully achieved in one swift motion.


Here comes the finale:
----------------------

Is there anything I should watch out for, or any good reading references
to the above, specifically something like a HOWTO for password
synchronization.

Ummm I can't really think of anything else, but advice from people
who've done this before would be really really really really
appreciated.
