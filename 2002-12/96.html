Andrew,
&gt;
&gt;OK. Dare I even suggest (seeing as we are, for all intents and
&gt;purposes, a Microsoft shop, at the moment) that SQL Server is even
&gt;worth thinking about? I've never worked with it in a development
&gt;sense, but I can imagine that it will be raised as an option at some
&gt;stage in the future.
&gt;
SQL Server is good and very capable of dishing out data in volume. There
are certain caveats. 
1. Good DB design (of course)
2. Good Indexing
3. Good DISK Partitioning/Striping and SCSI if you want more than 5 users!

I would stack SQL server up against the others for maintenability most days
(unless it pisses me off :P). The management side is minimal so long as the
design is sound. 

&gt;... not that I'm particularly keen to use it (the number of security
&gt;advisories directly relating to SQL Server in the last few weeks is
&gt;quite frightening), but it'll have to be a consideration.

Security issues are minor irritations from my end as ours is solely
internal and it's simply a matter of load patch and possibly reboot. It
does need the occasional reboot (2-3 times a year is probably the worst case)

Also if you are using MS languages and are looking at moving to .NET the
NATIVE SQL classes in .NET are about 5 times faster than the ODBC drivers.

No matter how good Linux is we have to satisfy all Masters and ourselves
last. So we are forced into the 'NO GOT FIRED FOR BUYING IBM' syndrome.
Don't dismiss SQL server I'd sooner use it than Oracle. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt; How are you going to get the existing Windows clients to talk to the
&gt;&gt; new database?

XML is a targetted in the .NET langs so you can open a cursor which returns
XML you can also open XML as a cursor and export it. 

&gt;Still thinking about that. Perhaps, as was suggested to me by Dan
&gt;Shearer, the backend can produce data in XML format to be rendered by
&gt;whatever application we so choose, whether it be a Windows-native
&gt;client, a web-based client, or something made out of toothpicks and
&gt;creamcheese.

Of course you can forget about all this and pick MySQL and various
combinations of C/JAVA/php/Apache for your reporting and processing needs.

Evan
