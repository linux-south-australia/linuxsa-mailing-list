&gt; Another advantage is that you can point and Mac OSX clients you may have

&gt; using the UNIX user accounts.

You can also gateway RADIUS and TACACS+ into LDAP, which
we find handy for authenticating access to the network
equipment.

The downside to a single password environment is the need
to keep that password secret -- there are still a surprising
number of protocols with use plain-text passwords.  So
whatever mechanism you use, you also need to get your
head around SSL and TLS and their use of certificates.

As one nasty example, there doesn't seem to be a way to
authenticate with a web proxy that doesn't put a plain
text password on the wire.  Ouch.

On the plus side, one you've tied all the protocols down
you can place a lot more services in the DMZ, making it
a lot easier to support out-of-office users and having
no fear that they'll leak their passwords or traffic into
a WLAN sniffer.

I suppose I'm suggesting that you'll need to allow more
effort for transition to unified user authentication
system than is initially apparent.  However the pay-off
does considerably repay the effort.

I suppose that's the biggest objection to AD.  It doesn't
play nicely with others, so you can't get the maximum
benefit for your effort.
