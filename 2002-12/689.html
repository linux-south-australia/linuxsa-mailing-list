&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone should go and see "Bowling for Columbine",
&gt;&gt;&gt; a film opening at the Palace/Nova on Dec 26th.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (it's by a yank, Michael Moore, he had a short series
&gt;&gt;&gt; on SBS a while ago, it's all about yanks obsession
&gt;&gt;&gt; with guns).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Said issue is, of course, not amenable to simple analyses.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; See for example: <A HREF="http://reason.com/0211/fe.jm.gun.shtml">http://reason.com/0211/fe.jm.gun.shtml</A>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have also heard it said that Canadians have a higher percentage of
&gt;&gt; private gun onwership than Americans, but with a lower percentage of
&gt;&gt; deaths related to gun violence.
&gt;
&gt; I remeber "Reason Magazine" at USC.
&gt;
&gt; I used to work at the Hoose Library of Philosophy there, and the Library
&gt; was a subscriber to Reason Magazine.
&gt;
&gt; The magazine was first acquired at the request of Professor John
&gt; Hospers, who's claim to fame is having received one Electoral Vote for
&gt; President of the United States in 1972.
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.sots.state.ct.us/RegisterManual/SectionVIII/Pol3b.htm">http://www.sots.state.ct.us/RegisterManual/SectionVIII/Pol3b.htm</A>)
&gt;
&gt; It is a right beautyful library, and I was lucky enough to work there to
&gt; earn some much needed $ to get myself through school. The sayings on the
&gt; wall are neat, and there is a full collection of the works of Saint
&gt; Augustine under the stained glass windows they show on "the web tour of
&gt; the library."
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/isd/locations/ssh/philosophy/phil_libbldg.html">http://www.usc.edu/isd/locations/ssh/philosophy/phil_libbldg.html</A>)
&gt; Although there is a picture of Professor Hospers on the wall, "the web
&gt; tour" does not seem to provide it.
&gt;
&gt; And someone that I learned the most from while at USC, Dr. Ross Scimeca
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/isd/locations/ssh/philosophy/ross.jpeg">http://www.usc.edu/isd/locations/ssh/philosophy/ross.jpeg</A>) the librarian.
&gt;
&gt; Oh well, enough daydreaming for me...

It's becoming increasingly obvious how many overseas people there are
on this list.  As I observed earlier, I don't think anybody "here" has
a problem with this, but I'm curious: you overseas blokes, why did you
join LinuxSA?  Why do you stay on the list?
