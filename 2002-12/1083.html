I'll add to what Rhett says too,

I used the rs232 port as I was not quite sure how to get the modem
working under USB. I did do insmod acm and it installed fine with Redhat
detecting the modem (i ran kudzu after insmod-ing ACM) just fine, funny
thing was I was unsure what to do next! *grin*
 Was I supposed to link the /dev/modem to /dev/USBtty0? I'd be happy to
here form someone who has done it?

Using the RS232 post under Redhat does not work using Redhats ISDN
configurator I needed wvdial to to tell me what AT commands would work. 
The ATZ command was not enough to get the NT1 to go.

If you need them let me know I have them written down somewhere, but
just run wvdial and all will be well.

If you use e-smith, it is busted, else weird. e-smith adds an AT command
to any additional commands you put in during install. eg if you needed
"AT &C1 &D1" what you would get from e-smith would be "ATAT &C1 &D1" and
that is wrong.


Keep me posted

&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am needing a little help in getting this beast working, I have it working
&gt; under winblowz in DVO mode and would like to setup a dialupserver to my isp
&gt; with it.
&gt; I have two ways of doing this and need a little help in the working.
&gt; 1. is via the rs-232 connector
&gt; 2. is via the USB
&gt; 
&gt; I believe I only need the at commands to send to the NTU unit and treat it
&gt; like a modem, this is where I go ?????
&gt; 
&gt; Has anybody got one of these units working under linux, I dont want to go
&gt; and buy a pci card when the unit has many connectors that could be used.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks In Advance Paul Mullins
