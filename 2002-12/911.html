&gt; One system favoured by Saphologists (?) is multi-seat electorates. 
&gt;  Imagine every  5 current adjacent electorates combined, with electors 
&gt; casting thir vote to elect 5 people in each such large electorate.  The 
&gt; outcome would be likely to be a far greater number of minor parties and 
&gt; independents in Parliament, far more representative of the electors 
&gt; views than is possible at present.

This is what Tasmanian has for their state parliament, IIRC. It's also
approximately how the Senate works (each state is a multi-seat
electorate). The trade-off for representing more people's veiws is
usually stability -- suppose we had a more representative system
federally, we'd end up with something like 35% libs, 5% nats, 40%
labour, 5% one nation, 5% green, 5% democrat, 5% independant, and you
wouldn't be able to form a government very easily -- you'd end up with
the same situation we often have in the senate, where the minority
parties hold a disproportionate amount of power, holding the majors to
ransom. Not that I neccessarily think that that's a bad thing, but it
doesn't make for a particularly stable or responsive government
(extreme cases include Israel, where coalitions are made and broken
regularly, and the government changes more often than they have
elections).

Personally, i like the preselection elections or whatever they are
(primaries?) in the USA, as it gives more emphasis on the person than
the party.

&gt; The reason we don't have this or any other more representative system is 
&gt; that it doesn't suit the major parties, and they unfortunately have all 
&gt; the power.

and because the designers of our parliamentary system favoured
stability over representativity... :)

Anyway, how did this get so off-topic?
