There was nothing unusual about the email except for the characters.

&gt;Perhaps. It could just be that it was a large e-mail, or that your
&gt;system was under load, or that there's some kind of hardware problem.
&gt;What were you using to check your mail? There's typically not a great
&gt;deal to worry about in regards to mail clients automatically doing
&gt;things to make your life easier (?), like you get with Outlook.
