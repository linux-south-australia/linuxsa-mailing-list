It's those kinds of situations that sustain my interest in Linux. I 
believe that Apple would actually be worse than Microsoft if they had 
anywhere near the same market share. It's only because they're small 
and struggling that they do have to toe the line to some extent.

I'm annoyed at Apple for software locking the capabilities of my iBook 
- eg, I've applied this hack: 
<A HREF="http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/ibook_e.html">http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/ibook_e.html</A> , but why should I 
have to do this? The capability is there so I should be able to use it 
by default, regardless of what their marketing morons think.

I stuck with a pure Linux system for nearly 10 years based on 
philosophical ideals but I didn't get much accomplished in this time. 
For practical reasons, I needed to find a well documented system where 
I could actually achieve something without continuously running into 
huge roadblocks. I almost bought a RiscPC to get back to the good old 
days of the Archimedes, but OS X answered my immediate requirements.

What Apple do provide is a single standard platform without 100 
variations. If you like the platform, there's a synergistic effect 
where all programs are well integrated because they're all using the 
same libraries and protocols. If you don't like the platform, then 
you're out of luck since it cannot be easily modified.

The analysis here is the same as when talking about multiple Linux 
distributions... flexibility requires more modular systems which 
results in less integration. Standardisation results in fixed ingrown 
systems with integration. The difficulty is how to achieve flexible 
modular systems with good integration, and that's not a solved problem 
yet.

So I have my Apple iBook for the benefits of a fixed platform and a 
Linux box for the benefits of a truly free (politically, idealogically 
and in every other way, not just money) flexible platform. Apple got 
some of my money but they don't have my wholehearted approval.
