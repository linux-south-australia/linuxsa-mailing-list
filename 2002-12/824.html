&gt;&gt; Those are normal enough temperatures inside a computer cabinet.  The
&gt;&gt; fan output of the cabinet of my Athlon 1700XP is 39°, and xmbmon shows
&gt;&gt; a processor temperature of 49°.  And that's in an air-conditioned room.
&gt;
&gt; For what it's worth, my Athlon 2000XP varies between 50-58** with 50
&gt; being the temp during winter.  Admittedly its not in the greatest
&gt; position for air circulation, the room isn't airconditioned, and I
&gt; don't have any PCI slots free, so it's a little cramped inside.
&gt;
&gt; Quite often it'll get past 60 in this sort of weather if I'm playing
&gt; 3D intensive games (BF1942 etc).  So far I've had no problems with
&gt; lockups and so forth as normally happens with excessive CPU
&gt; temperatures.

In my experience, 60° is where it starts becoming a problem.

&gt; A7V333), and also the BIOS info at startup, which incidentally is a
&gt; few degrees lower than what the Windows monitor reports.

I think they all use the same interface.  Processor temperature does
vary, though I don't have anything much to show.  Attached are graphs
of the parameters for my two main machines, which unfortunately don't
show more than minor fluctuations.  When a system does a lot of work
and then stops, you can often see significant differences in the
temperatures as a result.
