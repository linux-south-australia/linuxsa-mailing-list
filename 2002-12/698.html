&gt; As I understand it, rsync will compare the two files [...]

Yes, rsync compares two files and transfers only the differences, without
any one process having access to both files in order to do a conventional
diff. So notionally maybe today I download a file containing AAA, and
tomorrow it is changed on the master to be ABA. The rsync program (which
implements the rsync algorithm, like many other programs with all sorts of
different names) can notice patterns a bit like this and just transfer
'B'.

But imagine if the notional file containing AAA is compressed.  After the
master is changed to ABA, it is compressed again. The way compression
algorithms work, if you do a diff of the two compressed files there will
be many differences throughout, even though just one little part of the
file was changed from A to B. So, rsync doesn't really help for compressed
files. What people could do in order to get very fast updates with
minimum data transferred is never compress any files and never download
files with anything other than rsync. But this doesn't sound terribly
realistic, especially given that there is a CPU hit when running rsyncd as
compared to ftpd or httpd. (Some might notice as well that this also
involves people giving away a very small amount of information about what
happens behind their firewall.)

In the case of an ISO, rsync can help depending how much was updated in
the image. If some compressed files were changed in contents without
shifting other files around much then rsync may be able to just download
the changed files (in their entirety, as shown.) But if many files were
changed, or the file sizes changed such that the block layout of the ISO
is quite different, rsync isn't going to be much of an improvement over
wget and may be much worse overall given the CPU impact on the server.

There are two practical answers. The first is a thing called jigdo
(<A HREF="http://home.in.tum.de/~atterer/jigdo">http://home.in.tum.de/~atterer/jigdo</A>), which is a tool specially made for
mirroring ISO images. It is a kind of a special-case solution to the
compressed files problem. Its motivation was to avoid storing ISOs at all
while still letting users download ISOs, but one of the benefits is that
updates have rsync-like benefits. Jigdo isn't rsync, and runs over the
HTTP or FTP protocols.

The second is a new parameter to gzip callled "--rsyncable" which is very
nearly as efficient as ordinary gzip, but does its compression within
variable block sizes that match what rsync looks for. Improvements not far
from those available for uncompressed files are possible. Search for
"rsyncable" at
<A HREF="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/rsync-and-debian/rsync-and-debian.html">http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/rsync-and-debian/rsync-and-debian.html</A> for a
description of how it works. More detail including a link to the code is
at <A HREF="http://moin.conectiva.com.br/CompressedRsync.">http://moin.conectiva.com.br/CompressedRsync.</A> It isn't surprising that
the two distros that rely completely on apt-get for maintenance are the
ones keen on pushing this technology.
