Luke,

&gt; Reading on this group and speaking to a few people, I've picked up the
&gt; notion that debian isn't the easiest to install.

It isn't; especially Woody because it has an infamous "I'm not going to
install X" bug.

&gt; I chose debian because I want to evaluate different linux
&gt; distributions and I have heard positive things about it.

It is a very good distribution.

&gt; First a rescue.bin image is needed, then an image applying to your
&gt; machine, in my case root.bin. That's 2 floppies.

It took me aeons to work out that you start a Debian installation from a
"rescue.bin" image. And then further aeons to work out which one...the
Installation instructions are woeful. They are so detailed that you get
lost in the quagmire.

&gt; Next 4 driver disks are needed. I had quite a problem finding their 
&gt; whereabouts and there were no clues in the README or INSTALL files. 
&gt; After loading them I was able to configure the network, which is where
&gt; I needed to be. 

Not necessarily all 4 drivers. Most can get by with just the first two
disks.

&gt; A tool called "dselect" is used, which takes a bit of getting used to.
&gt; When it comes to installing the packages there is a lot of action but
&gt; no prompting for the further 6 (of 7) debian disks. As soon as the
&gt; install program fails to find a package through 'ftp' it goes 'http'
&gt; out on to the net.

You obviously hadn't set your apt sources up correctly. Every Debian
installation I have made has asked me how I wanted to setup my
apt-sources. This involves scanning 7 disks, it's tedious but it works.

Now on a network install it could assume you don't have disks but that
doesn't strike me as Debian like. It tends to assume nothing.

&gt; All I wanted to do initially was to install ssh, so I could ssh in
&gt; from my other box, however the simple fact of installing a package
&gt; became a total upgrade of all software.

No, it was installing the stuff it needed to install ssh. No more and no
less.

&gt; After the whole install process hung because 'libc6' couldn't be
&gt; loaded, I decided to try another machine with a bootable cdrom. Only
&gt; the 7th cdrom booted, then after inserting disk 1, I came across a
&gt; corrupted file on the cdrom.

Which simply proves that you had 6 non bootable disks and a 7th corrupt
one.

&gt; I decided to abandon the debian install.
&gt; 
&gt; I will need to get a new set of disks (debian woody),

Where did you get them from?
