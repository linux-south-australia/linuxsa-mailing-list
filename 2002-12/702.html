&gt;It's becoming increasingly obvious how many overseas people there are
&gt;on this list.  As I observed earlier, I don't think anybody "here" has
&gt;a problem with this, but I'm curious: you overseas blokes, why did you
&gt;join LinuxSA?  Why do you stay on the list?

:-)   No doubt, this is a good group of folk.

&gt;My joining this group was the best mistake I ever made.  When I first
&gt;joined, I had no idea what a Linux Users Group was.  From my
&gt;perspective, I was used to calling customer support for answers, but I
&gt;soon realized that Linux community works together as a group to come up
&gt;with solutions that benefit the group as a whole. It is in this way that
&gt;no one here really receives free support because help is exchanged in an
&gt;almost barter type fashion, but without a strict adherence to an
&gt;accounting or measure of the value of the help given; the members of the
&gt;group are fundamentally very friendly with each other and aren't petty
&gt;in that way AFAIK.
&gt;
&gt;  From what I have seen, Linux User Groups mailing lists are very
&gt;efficient and effective way for people to help each other find answers
&gt;to important computing questions. The knowledge base is vast, and
&gt;multiple people reap the benefit of the answer given.  With that in
&gt;mind, if the question is not Linux related, and is asked by an
&gt;unfamiliar name, one might conclude, correctly or incorrectly, that if
&gt;they answer, the favor will not be returned, to the group.  One might
&gt;conclude, correctly or incorrectly, that this type of dialogue is no
&gt;longer an efficient contribution to a group effort, but rather a drain
&gt;on the collaborative resource.
&gt;
&gt;With that in mind, kind responses were given none the less, and there is
&gt;something to be said for that.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;When I joined Linuxsa, I had been using Linux for about 6 months,
&gt;struggling the entire time.  I had searched the Internet for hours,
&gt;trying to find out how I might log into my company's Netware 4 server
&gt;from Linux. During my search,  Linuxsa was one of three boards that had
&gt;the same question I had, but was apparently unanswered.  SILUG, the
&gt;Southern Illinois Linux User Group and SVLUG, the Silicon Valley Linux
&gt;User Group were the other two.
&gt;
&gt;When I finally found the answer I was looking for, I felt morally
&gt;obligated to provide it to as many people as possible, given that I had
&gt;to work so very hard to find the answer. So, I joined all three groups
&gt;and posted my solution.
&gt;
&gt;As time went on,  I realized that the topics discussed on this board
&gt;were most relevant to me and that I was most comfortable with the people
&gt;on this board than any other. I believe very strongly, that it is more
&gt;important to consider the group dynamic than Geographic location when
&gt;becoming a part of a collborative support  network like Linuxsa. Weather
&gt;Australian or American, we are all people first, with a common set of
&gt;questions and unique ideas that can benefit us all.
&gt;
&gt;Linuxsa has been nothing but a real blessing.  I have learned far beyond
&gt;what I ever imagined,  learned an ethic that is helpful to others
&gt;because others were helpful to me, and from that ethic, I have had a
&gt;greater sense of fulfillment and purpose as a computer user.
&gt;
&gt;I hope that your computing experience will be similar.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
