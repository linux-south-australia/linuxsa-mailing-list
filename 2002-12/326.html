During the whole Impeachment Circus, I had a friend that worked in the 
Clinton White House in the Legislative Affairs Office.

So, two friends of mine and I took a vacation and went to visit him at 
work....

One of these friends was a student at Berkeley who was able to find a

"Not Milk" T-shirt to give to him before we arrived...

I don'y know what would have happened if he brought it with him to my 
friend's work...

&gt;Bush-bin Laden 'sex act' t-shirt confiscated.
&gt;
&gt;Queensland Police have confiscated a t-shirt apparently
&gt;depicting a sex act involving US President George W Bush
&gt;and Osama bin Laden, at a popular Brisbane market.
&gt;
&gt;Police say they received a complaint about the t-shirt
&gt;from a customer at the Riverside Markets yesterday
&gt;morning.
&gt;
&gt;Officers spoke to the stall vendor who was selling the
&gt;t-shirt before confiscating the garment.
&gt;
&gt;No charges have been laid.

&gt;
&gt;Unknown author of these words. 
&gt;Just the words to take along to any seasonal bash
&gt; and get a good sing song going.
&gt;
&gt;(Sung to the tune of "If You're Happy and You Know it,
&gt; Clap Your Hands")
&gt; 
&gt; If we cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.
&gt; If the markets hurt your Mama, bomb Iraq.
&gt; If the terrorists are Saudi
&gt; And the bank takes back your Audi
&gt; And the TV shows are bawdy, Bomb Iraq.
&gt; 
&gt; If the corporate scandals growin', bomb Iraq.
&gt; And your ties to them are showin', bomb Iraq.
&gt; If the smoking gun ain't smokin'
&gt; We don't care, and we're not jokin'.
&gt; That Saddam will soon be croakin', Bomb Iraq.
&gt; 
&gt; Even if we have no allies, bomb Iraq.
&gt; From the sand dunes to the valleys, bomb Iraq.
&gt; So to hell with the inspections;
&gt; Let's look tough for the elections,
&gt; Close your mind and take directions, Bomb Iraq.
&gt; 
&gt; While the globe is slowly warming, bomb Iraq.
&gt; Yay! the clouds of war are storming, bomb Iraq.
&gt; If the ozone hole is growing,
&gt; Some things we prefer not knowing.
&gt; (Though our ignorance is showing), Bomb Iraq.
&gt; 
&gt; So here's one for dear old daddy, bomb Iraq,
&gt; From his favorite little laddy, bomb Iraq.
&gt; Saying no would look like treason.
&gt; It's the Hussein hunting season.
&gt; Even if we have no reason, Bomb Iraq.
&gt;
