      The Vegemite story is truly inspiring. It's chock full of Aussie
ingenuity, hard work and innovation.



The yeast extract spread we all know and love first appeared on our shelves
in 1923. It was made from many essential ingredients apart from yeast
extract.

One of the main ones was Fred Walker - a man before his time.

He was an entrepreneur and business visionary. Fred tried many different
businesses from selling hat accessories to managing an agency for racehorses
& jockeys. He then branched out into canning. Under the company name of Fred
Walker & Co, Fred started canning everything that could be canned- meat, ox
tongue, macaroni and vermicelli.

In 1918, the war delayed imports of popular yeast extracts. Walker saw an
opening in the market and pounced. Fred enlisted the help of a brilliant
young chemist, Dr Cyril P Callister, to work on a yeast extract and a cheese
that had a long shelf life. After many attempts, they developed a spread,
and Vegemite was born.

While Dr Callister was working on a cheese with a long shelf life, he found
a viable patent that was registered by James Kraft, a Canadian who was based
in Chicago. Fred went to America to talk to James Kraft. James Kraft and
Fred Walker were two peas in a pod and in 1926 they decided to start a joint
venture -The Kraft Walker Cheese Company.

Kraft has been making Vegemite here in Australia since 1926 and continues to
do so today.

Fred Walker's and James Kraft's values still pervade through Kraft Foods
today and their famous spread continues to put a rose in every cheek

Dosn't quite say what's in it but in intresting non the less
