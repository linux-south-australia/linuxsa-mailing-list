&gt;&gt;There is in fact a great installer used on a (now defunct) Linux distrib,

&gt;&gt;your own install cd's using it).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;apt-get install pgi
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Not sure if it still works though, last time I looked at it was in early 2.2
&gt;&gt;days...

&gt; That last sentence sums it all up. Another Debian installer was the Corel
&gt; Linux installer, very nice if you like that sort of thing but it died of
&gt; bitrot long ago.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Most people that bash (no pun intended) Debian simply don't open their eyes
&gt;&gt;wide enough ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They also might be looking for things that Debian simply can't deliver,
&gt; and there's a lot of things in that category.

This is exactly the point people need to take into account when they 
point at x86 installers for debian based systems and say "why can't 
debian do it like that?". Debian supports many more architectures than 
just x86, so to keep things consistent the installer needs to be 
portable across all those architectures.

IMO The main problems with the debian installer are:

1. It implies that you should use tasksel and/or dselect to install your 
optional packages.

2. The X setup normally leads to X getting set up to use /dev/mouse 
which doesn't exist by default and so X never usually starts first time.

3. There is essentially no hardware detection, which is ok if you know 
what hardware you have and what drivers are required, but otherwise can 
be more annoying.

The hardware detection can be done manually, at least on x86 using 
apt-gettable tools (or what is becomming my preferred method - stick 
knoppix in and see what drivers it comes up with) but is not portable 
obviously. Package selection through apt/aptitude is much nicer than 
dselect, and doesn't pull in a plethora of packages you didn't really 
want, as happens when installing stuff using tasksel.
