My thanks to everyone who has replied to this, both on and off list.

It seems that the system works great, and everyone likes the
convenience that comes from the on-street running.

In the UK there is renewed interest in tramways, using a combination
of disused railway formations and on-street running. The construction
costs for a tramway and a guided busway are about the same, it seems.
Again, everyone likes the convenience of the on-street running, and
the systems work pretty well except in Birmingham where they keep
getting vandalised.

Of course, it's much harder to vary the route of an on-street tramway,
but given the reluctance of UK bus companies to vary their routes
anyway, this doesn't make that much difference.

The proposed Cambridge-Huntingdon scheme is quite different in
character from Adelaide. Cambridge in particular is an ancient town
all crammed up together, and driving any sort of vehicle in it is a
nightmare. There is no possibility of building a guided busway to
drive buses at high speed through the city, because there's no space,
and the distances between stops would be too small for speed anyway.
Both buses and trams would be running in the streets, and trams
possibly have an advantage in motivating cars not to get in the way.
Outside the cities, both types of vehicle would be running at high
speed.

I shall definitely summarise people's responses and pass them to the
editor of RAIL. Thanks to you all.
