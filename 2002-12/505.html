Yes, but drinking beer without a glass/bottle/can/drip is difficult
too. :)

Debian's main advantage is the discipline with which packages and
dependencies are created and maintained. This enables apt to work --
and apt is the visible benefit of the real advantage. RedHat and
friends are less strict in how they package things and so on, so even
an apt-like tool is less likely to work. There are other subtle
things, too -- dpkg and the .deb format seem to have more flexible
pre- and post- install scripting, and almost invariably, they
correctly stop and start services as needed, and deal relatively
sensibly with config files (FreeBSD is slightly better with config
files here, but then it suffers because it doesn't seem to just update
unchanged ones...)... anyway, rant over.
