  "Due to the way that a TCP/IP stack is designed, the fastest IP number to
resolve is 125. This means that the more 125's that you have in your IP
address, the faster your network is going to be. Here's how to set up your
network with the fastest possible IP addresses. Select the Specify an IP
address radio button. In the IP field, input an IP address in the format
125.125.125.X. Make X a different number between 0 and 255 on each computer
on your network. If your network just happens to have more than 256
computers on it, you will also need to use more than one sub-domain
(125.125.x.x). "

  I was curious to hear what others have to say about the validity of this
claim ?

The phrase popularised by Rove comes to mind: "What The?!".

The only benefit I see to using 125 is that it's going to pass through an
AND statement approximately one cycle sooner than addresses starting with
128 or higher on a system that compares 1 bit at a time (hint: there aren't
a lot of those in use in modern PC's). Even if you did have such a system,
you probably wouldn't want to use a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask as suggested
in the article.

Given that an IP address is a 32 bit value, maybe there's some arguement for
speed of lookup on a 16 bit OS. On a 32 bit (or higher!) system like linux,
you can use any address you like without fear of lookup-prejudice.

If you are going to arbitrarily number your local network, I'd suggest
having a read of RFC1918, which you can see at:
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html.">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html.</A> 125.125.125.0 falls in an IANA
reserved block and should not be used. NAT doesn't care which numbers you
use anyway.
