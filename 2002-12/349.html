Michael,
I agree with you, and it makes me wonder, are all americans this way?? :)

Keith,
you post to a linux list about M$ technology, without mentioning any 
reference to /anything/ you have looked at, or for, searched the web, 
read doco's etc..

then, you sit down and try and blame your programming inadequacies on 
Australians, because we didnt help.. and then what? did you sit back and 
think why you might not have got the right answer and how you could 
maybe re-phrase your question, NO, you started wingeing on about someone 
flaming you for posting to the wrong list. Did that help the problem??

go on, have a guess..

even then, did you consider for a second, that the people in this list 
offer help at their own cost and time?? they are not obligated to help 
you, but I bet 50% of the people on this list could have, in fact one 
person did if I recall correctly..
and the reasons they didnt help??

1) you posted to the wrong list
2) you didnt show /any/ evidence of where you might have searched already
3) you didnt show any evidence of any doco's you may have read
4) you made no effort to show you have tried to find the problem to no 
avail.(or at least it appeared that way)
5) and you just expected people to help you (big mistake)

now I have wasted too much time on this email, but before I finish I 
will say this, go away and dont come back until you have read this; 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html&gt">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html&gt</A>; then go RTFM, go 
STFW and then, go and post to the relevanant list with your problem, or 
maybe try and ask some 'smart questions' to find out what you need to d, 
do anything, but dont come back here slating people for not helping you 
on what I consider a pretty simple problem.

and dont sit there trying to slate Australians cos YOU dont know what 
your talking about, try and think about your problem and the best 
methods for you to work it out.

PS yes, its late, I am tired and felt it needed to be said.
PPS if you think I am being rude, wait til you upset 'the DSL' P

&gt;&gt;Now for one person to ask 3 different lists for 
&gt;&gt;information about how to do something in a 
&gt;&gt;certain language (ENGLISH AHOLE) this person
&gt;&gt;must think he knows everything.  GUESS WHAT?
&gt;&gt;I dont think he knows Jack #$&$&!!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Yes I am ticked off by this jerk and I AM VENTING!
&gt;&gt;If you dont have the knowledge about a certain topic
&gt;&gt;and you ask a question to the list then what the heck
&gt;&gt;is the use of the list?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;With all due respect, Ben; KMA! If you dont know

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;hmm, sent to 3 lists, one linux, one JSP, and one visual basic. only 
&gt;&gt;managed to get the right *company* on one out of 3. and it was a "please 
&gt;&gt;do my homework for me" question.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;welcome to nothing-better-to-do-than-other-people's-work-sa.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;other lists snipped to reduce the spam.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;ahh, keith, you idiot, you might do better sending this to an actual ASP 
&gt;&gt;mailing list. as far as i can see, you haven't sent it to any - you've 
&gt;&gt;sent it to a linux user group, a JSP list, and a visual basic list. i'll 
&gt;&gt;give you a clue: ASP is a microsoft-only technology. linux people are 
&gt;&gt;very very likely not going to help you with it. same with the sun JSP 
&gt;&gt;list; ASP is a competing technology, and they very very likely won't 
&gt;&gt;help you either. the visual basic list might be closer to what you want 
&gt;&gt;(at least you got the right company, gee, good work).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;sending an email to 3 lists in the same mailing is very bad practice. 
&gt;&gt;we're not some free help-me-with-my-homework resource. particularly if 
&gt;&gt;you're an "applications consultant", you should be able to do this stuff 
&gt;&gt;by yourself (you're a big boy, i'm sure).

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am using an asp form post application to send numerous sql variables to a search asp page.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The page will need to be broken down into numerous pages as the list obtained is too large for one page.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Most of the examples that I have seen do an open of the same page by passing an URL with a query string.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;The items that I would be passing would be too large.  
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there some way to do the same thing by using a form post procedure?
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;TIA,
