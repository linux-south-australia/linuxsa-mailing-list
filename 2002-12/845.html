&gt; &gt; Now that summer has hit us, im a little conserned about the temperature of
&gt; &gt; a few rooms at home and at work.  One box died thisafternoon due to the
&gt; &gt; heat, bugger, and the discussion on LinuxSA today reminded me to ask this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is available for FreeBSD hardware and software wise that I could use
&gt; &gt; to monitor and log temperatures?  Is there a place in SA that sells this
&gt; &gt; sort of stuff or could one be built?  I would consider running it on Linux
&gt; &gt; (if i had to).
&gt;
&gt; There are two ports I know of for using the onboard temp sensors and the
&gt; like - healthd, xmbmon.

These are Intel boards and the last time I checked, programs like those
just refused to work with it.

&gt; If you want to plot an external data source them mtrg or rrdtool are
&gt; good.

Yep, already use those :)

&gt; For external monitoring you could make your own using Dallas 1-wire temp
&gt; sensors.. They have a serial port kit and talking to the individual
&gt; chips is pretty easy..

This is what I was really after, a sensor I can chuck in a room..  Do you
have any details, sites, etc. on hand?  I did a quick Google around and
didn't turn up any too technical.

Thanks,
