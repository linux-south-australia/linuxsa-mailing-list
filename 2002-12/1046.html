no Sparc Alpha etc suck (for home use anyway).

Why use SCSI drives for a single user, etc?  Sounds like a lot of money for
little if no gain in performance for desktop applications.

x86 hardware is better because one can afford more of it and can just pump
out sheer grunt.  Esoteric hardware like Mac's, Sun, etc are just more
expensive because they can be or need to be because of lower volumes, niche
market, monopoly, etc - not necessarily because their benefits are
commensurate with the price difference.

In a server environment that's a completely different story.  For personal
use - we just need to shift around massive amounts of data to render little
people with big guns on our screens in high detail.

But Sparc sucks at home - they don't have GeForce 4 graphics cards and I
can't play Unreal Tournament 2003 and therefore it sucks bad - even it cost
$10,000 and had a RAID array, multiple CPUs, registered ECC RAM, blah blah
blah.  If it aint' play UT 2003 - it sucks..

(let the FLAMES ROLL!!)

all quite true, but that's just x86-based computers, which suck.
Sparc or alpha (and so on) are way better in every respect,
except x86 stuff is cheap.

But that's a different thing than what I took the article to be
on about (and it's not about different word doc formats either).
Linux is trying to copy M$ to "win marketshare" from M$.
We all know M$ never innovates anything, they just copy or
buy things done by other companies/people.  Well linux is
doing the same thing.
In recent times Apple has been more innovative in some ways.

Which shouldn't be taken to mean I don't like linux, I do
(quite a lot, although in some ways I like solaris better
but as a desktop OS (with crossover office to run M$ word
and excel (which works brilliantly BTW (is there an award
for the number of nested brackets?))) linux is perfect for me).

Dave.
