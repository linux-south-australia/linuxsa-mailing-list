I first bought Lycoris when it was called Redmond Linux. I called the 
guy on the phone and ordered the software. I coulc hear his baby crying 
so I called back...

He then wrote me back and said....

&gt; Funny thing....
&gt;
&gt; I only live a few blocks from you on the other side of the Whisman 
&gt; Bridge...
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

They seem very personable and competent over there...

&gt;Hi everyone, 
&gt;
&gt;I heard from Ian Loxton that you are demoing Lycoris this weekend at the installfest.
&gt;Over the past few days I have been talking to one of the Techs at Lycoris about some unsupported hardware issues.
&gt;
&gt;The responese have been nothing but excellent and extremely prompt. I thought that others on this list may also like to see
&gt;the emails and responses that I have sent and recieved. Read from the bottom up.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, and if I don't make it to the installfest I hope it all goes great

&gt;No worries thanks you all your help, if you could let me know in the future when a solution has been
&gt;
&gt;developed for this issue it would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;Nathan,
&gt;
&gt;I just talked with our CTO.  One of our volunteer developers has been tasked with the Promise MB project.  
&gt;I know he has at least one other project with a higher priority, so I can't say when we will see something.  Hopefully soon.

&gt;Wayne,
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for your prompt response.
&gt;
&gt;With regard to the MB support issues I will patiently await a response as working within the IT industry myself I realize that
&gt;
&gt;solutions to problems may not arise as quickly as we all may like even though people may be working hard to solve them.
&gt;
&gt;With what you have said about the NIC being detected later and working OK makes much more sense even though it initially said “None”
&gt;
&gt;next to that device type during initial hardware detection. I was very surprised that it wasn’t picked up but as you have said this should work later.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks once again.

&gt;
&gt;Nathan,
&gt;
&gt;I've been doing some research on your MB, but I have not come up with any good news yet.  Some of our community members thought they had it taken care of last month, but it did not work.  I have 
&gt;contacted Promise but have not received an answer yet.  I'll do some more searching and keep you informed.  Unfortunately, I do not have that MB, so I can't do any testing myself.
&gt;
&gt;In the install, I'm not entirely certain the NIC is picked up in that initial probe.  I believe only enough hardware is detected to continue the install, so that may be why your NIC was not 
&gt;recognized.  I just went into the "Add Hardware" section and via-rhine was listed, so I think there is no problem there.
&gt;
&gt;
