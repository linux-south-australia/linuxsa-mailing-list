<H1>ssh public key auth</H1>

<PRE>
I have a couple boxen at work (one is slackware and the other I think is
redhat) both have the same version of sshd and no differences between
/etc/ssh/sshd_config. Both machines have a user called backup and on
each machine I used that user to generate an ssh keypair. Used scp to
copy ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the remote machine.

The problem is this: logging in from one machine to the other doesn't
prompt for a password, yet the other way around it still asks for a
password[1].

Seems very weird to me, as (as far as I know) they are both set up the
same. I used the exact same commands to create the keypairs, to copy the
public key over, and I double checked the permissions.

If anyone has any suggestions for when I next get to have a go at
getting the thing working, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Daniel Mundy


[1] I'm not sure just now which one accepts pubkey auth, as I don't have
access to the network today... But I *think* it's the redhat one that
won't allow the slack box to connect without manually entering the
password. (But it's possible I have the two mixed up..)
