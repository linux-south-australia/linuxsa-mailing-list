&gt; Yeah, I was in Los Angeles during the last set of riots. (There was an

&gt; Having only been to Windsor and Edmonton in Canada, I would say that 
&gt; there is a smaller gap between the rich and the poor. People are very 
&gt; well taken care of there. Most people can afford a home, are well fed, 
&gt; and happy. Its a bit different in South Central. &lt;g&gt;
&gt;
&gt; People of economic disadvantage form groups, i.e. the Crypts and the 
&gt; Bloods in Los Angeles.  These groups scare the economically 
&gt; advantaged, so they go out and get a gun to defend themselves. Its a 
&gt; downward spiral. 


Got it - nearly in ONE!
There was an article by Philip Adams in the Weekend Austraian a few 
months back entitled "A deadly cocktail of values".  He was referring to 
the US and it's weird mixture of Christianity/Calvinism and brutal 
uncontrolled Capitalism.  eg hard work inevitably leads to wealth - it 
therefore follows that the poor are lazy an that their poverty is their 
own fault.  We should love our Christian brothers and sisters, and 
exploit them for gain whenever we can! WE hold these Truths to be 
self-evident, that all Men are created equal, except bone idle southern 
negros.  Land was not allocated in an orderly manner on settlement, but 
grabbed by the quickest/smartest/most ruthless.  Such contradictions abound.
It is no wonder there is a problem of violence in the USA.

Brian.
