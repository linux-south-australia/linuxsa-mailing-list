I think that is what they USED to have.  IIRC the two major parties 
colluded to reduce the chances of the minor ones a year or two back. 
 Dunno what they finished up with.

&gt;approximately how the Senate works
&gt;
VERY approximately.  Different purpose, as you know.

&gt;&gt;The reason we don't have this or any other more representative system is 
&gt;&gt;that it doesn't suit the major parties, and they unfortunately have all 
&gt;&gt;the power.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;and because the designers of our parliamentary system favoured
&gt;stability over representativity... :)
&gt;
Hence the Senate?  Not sure about the motives of our parliamentary 
designers.  They seem somewhat ambivalent.

&gt;Anyway, how did this get so off-topic?
&gt;
This is the LinuxSA list.  How come you are even asking such a question 
on such a list?   :-)

If it helps, you could consider Open Source as a democratic movement. 
 Thus we users of Open Source Software are naturally interested in 
issues of democracy.
Hey!  That nearly makes this discussion ON topic! &lt;proud look&gt;

Brian.
