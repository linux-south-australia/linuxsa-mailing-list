Hi Reginaldo,

Can you give us some information about your network?

eg:
what network is connected to each card?
What IP address is assigned to each card?
what does your /sbin/route look like? 

Your english is fine.

Regards,

Michael

&gt; Hi, folks!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;      I'm a network administrator typing from Brazil and I'm facing a crazy problem with Red Hat 6.2.
&gt;      I installed two ethernet cards (already tried a lot of models of 3Com (905b, 905c, 980) and also Realtek (8129, 8139)) on a PIII-1.13GHz, and the situation is the following:
&gt; 
&gt; - The cards doesn't work if both are enable, but if I disabled (ifdown) one, the other begins to respond to ping;
&gt; - I'm using static IPs on both interfaces (eth0 is 200.251.242.1 and eth1 is 10.0.0.1);
&gt; - Ifconfig detects both (eth0 and eth1) at irq10 and irq11, respectively;
&gt; - I tried to swap the cards to different slot positions to avoid conflicts, but fails;
&gt; - There's no conflict between the cards, cause I tried to install other versions of Red Hat (7.2, 7.3) and the machine works well;
&gt; - I tried to compile the driver sources into the kernel instead of modules, but anyway without success;
&gt; - I also tried to upgrade the original kernel (2.2.14-5.0) to the newer version (2.4.20). Guess what? Same problem;
&gt; - At last, I tried to do all these things in a complete differente machine expecting hardware incompatibilities... Same situation;
&gt; 
&gt;      Has anybody experienced similar problems using two ethernet cards with Red Hat 6.2? Am I doing something stupid? Is there some secret in this version that I don't know?
&gt;      I would like to justify that I need too much that this thing works because I have an outdated commercial software that runs well just on Red Hat 6.2.
&gt; 
&gt;      Please, somebody help me! I would be greatly thankful.
&gt;      Happy new year!
&gt; 
&gt; PS: Sorry about my poor english :-)
