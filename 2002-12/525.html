Hi Ant, well as I write this, 9 am something, I have the whole thing down. 560 Meg of it. Left the beast on all last night while it was quiet time.

I think I will do the full download next time but perhaps if I just tickle the ISO each week that should keep me up to date with any changes, same as you used to do with Mandrake cooker.

So, those looking for the latest ISO for Lycoris, here it is. Now I just ned to work out how to get the burner to work &lt;sigh&gt;

Cheers,  Ian

&gt; rsync is better suited to where you have a bunch of files that some or
&gt; parts of some are changing often. In this case rsync will work out
&gt; which bits of which files have changed and only download them. If your
&gt; getting an iso, and the iso is not going to change but rather be
&gt; completely replaced by the next release then I dont think rsync is an
&gt; advantage over anything that can just resume a file transfer like ftp
&gt; (or even http). I used to use rsync on the mandrake cooker, to just
&gt; keep the tree of RPMs up to date, which it was perfectly suited too.
