&gt; Which one (or more?) of the dozen or so is published on the MSDN site?

Prior to 1999 Microsoft published the binary file formats for all of
Microsoft Office files, however they now only publish it for Excel.
I have a copy of MSDN Library prior to then, from a slightly old copy
of Visual Studio, and it has plenty of documentation.

I'm disappointed that they've taken the step to 'de-publish' binary
file formats.  I presume they've done this because they consider Office
to be the jewel in their crown (which it is), and they want to make it
hard for people to compete with them.  For example, many word processors
read and write MS Word format files which makes it easier for people to
survive on a non Windows platform.  (I take it for granted that Word is
the world's dominant word processor, and to survive you have to be able
to exchange Word documents with others.)

I can actually see the point: there is now a growing number of excellent
word processors which compete well with Word.  If you followed a slightly
twisted line of thinking, and I think Microsoft does think this way, you
could conclude that the purpose of Word is to make people buy Windows,
so you mustn't let Word run on any other platform and you mustn't publish
information to help anybody else write a compatible word processor on
competing platforms.  (Macintosh Office is just to satisfy the DOJ that
Microsoft isn't a monopoly.  Wink wink.)

The irony is that I'd love to be able to give Microsoft my money for a
version of Word that runs on Linux, FreeBSD and so on.  Pity that DOJ
didn't separate Windows OS and everything else into different companies.
I think the world would be richer, and I think all of the Microsoft
shareholders would be richer, too.
