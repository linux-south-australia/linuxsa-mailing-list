I just finished reading the rather long thread, thinking "you guys 
really need to look at OS X". Any Microsoft vs Linux argument is out of 
date these days. It's Microsoft vs Linux and Apple and BSD and Sun and 
IBM and all the other companies that are using free software.

Yes... and Microsoft too - by incorporating BSD code into their OS and 
programs, they're competing against themselves in this area. When the 
Microsoft version is just a BSD project plus a few incompatible tweaks, 
the question of "why use it?" is a lot more prominent than if they'd 
developed the software entirely by themselves.

For that matter... imagine if yes, all the predictions of doom were 
right, and Linux loses favour, and it dies and everyone in the whole 
wide world, including Linus, stops developing for it... (how likely is 
that!)

So what?

The code is still there and it's still freely available. That's the 
real legacy of GNU, BSD and Linux. It's not the brand name, it's the 
reality of people co-operating and writing free code that makes this 
interesting.

Some people, like James Leone, will try and switch to Linux before it's 
suitable for their purposes, and yes... if Linux doesn't improve fast 
enough, they'll be forced to look elsewhere. OK, so come back in 2 or 3 
years (or buy a Mac).

I don't think there is any time limit on how long Linux has. It'll just 
keep getting better, and more people will find it's good enough to use.
