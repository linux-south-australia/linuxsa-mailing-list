&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; has anyone checked out xpde (www.xpde.com)? i installed it (very easy to
&gt; install for me, just unzip and modify one file - i did it under a different
&gt; user just to make sure i didn't blow away any of my normal users settings).
&gt; 
&gt; It's a desktop environment that's trying to look exactly like windows XP. They

Just for the record, the fvwm-themes project has had an XP clone theme
for months now and it looks pretty identical from what I can tell
although I haven't ever used winXP. And with fvwm-themes you can still
use your favourite gnome or kde environments if you want. *shrug* You
can get fvwm-themes from <A HREF="http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net">http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net</A> if you want
to check that out.

&gt; appear to be copying a lot of flak for it over at slashdot, and I can
&gt; certainly see why. However, GNU/Linux is an open platform and people are free
&gt; to do whatever they wish...
&gt; 
&gt; For what its worth, the DE loads very quickly (about as quick as icewm i'd
&gt; say), and looks scarily like XP (in windows classic mode). For me the task
&gt; manager and network monitor didn't work, but oh well. Most of the buttons and
&gt; things don't work, they appear to be placeholders. But I could create a
&gt; shortcut to mozilla on my desktop and start a terminal etc...
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, interesting to checkout, as a novelty at least.
