read it somewhere - there is some absolute dribble on the Net - one guy said
do a google search - your NIC card is stuffed for Linux.

I did a google search and saw nothing of the sort - just not DETAIL on how
others got their MA311 cards working..

So you are right!!!  Yes - I know WEP sucks - but if someone has such a
boring life they have nothing better to do than key sniff my network for 6
hours or whatever is required - good luck to them!!  I will even bring them
a drink to ease the boredom :-)

I just don't want some script kiddie sucking down data at my expense or
thinking its funny to change passwords or move /change files or whatever.

I think the first time I find someone trying to do something like that - I
will send a directional EMP pulse in their direction and blow their card.  I
imagine a high gain pringles can would do more than just amplify my weak
signal.

Hey - can Linux be set up to target EMP pulses at script kiddies?  EMPD or
something..

Seriously though - from what I have gathered - frees/wan is the way to go -
have some reading though..  Sounds like another Linux Epic Adventure on the
way  (oh God - someone just write a GUI - wait!! - only joking!!!)

Ian,
WEP _does_ work with Ad-Hoc.  Well, it's working for me right now with a W2k

client and a linux server ... dunno where you heard this ...

&gt; Apparently WEP won't work on ad-hoc networks - which to borrow from Linux
&gt; methodology - is crap.  I'm sure there is a work around, fudged driver to
&gt; make an Access Point or something.  I've learnt that nothing is impossible
&gt; with Linux - just impossible to configure what is possible.
