&gt;Perhaps you should have more lunch breaks :-)

Perhaps you should be my boss.... :)


&gt;One system favoured by Saphologists (?) is multi-seat electorates. 

Saphologists??  What/who are they?  A new protocol or a plant of some kind?
:)


&gt; Imagine every  5 current adjacent electorates combined, with electors 
&gt;casting thir vote to elect 5 people in each such large 
&gt;electorate.  The 
&gt;outcome would be likely to be a far greater number of minor 
&gt;parties and 
&gt;independents in Parliament, far more representative of the electors 
&gt;views than is possible at present.

Interesting concept, kind of a powersharing arrangement, somehow I don't
think the powers that be would like that, even if the electorate did.  
Oh, that's right, theyre our representatives so if the electorate wanted
it to happen then that would mean it must happen right?? hmmmmm.....

Maybe if Linuxsa should become a political party instead of incorporating
itself, or do you need one before the other? :)
