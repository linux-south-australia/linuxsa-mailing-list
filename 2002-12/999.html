Heya,

Any Cobalt users on this list?  There's been talk for quite sometime of
making a new "OS" for the Cobalt units, due to a hell of a lot of
shortcomings in Sun's offering... and this especially has been highlighted
recently, with the pink slipping with pretty much all of the dominant Sun
employees that really did help out Cobalt owners.

In the past month they've released at least three "patches" I know of that
either completely break a box (for example, the recent kernel update on the
XTR's, which causes the machine to never boot up again, and in many cases
the '/home' raid partition to be completely trashed), and other "security
fixes" that introduce even bigger, more obvious security holes into the
boxes.

I'm not into slagging a company for no reason, but its got completely and
utterly riduculous.  Its like Sun don't give a rats ass about us anymore, so
we're all stuck with overpriced boxes which are near useless.

Few months ago I started work on a project called 'Qbalt', which is
basically going to be a "Cobalt conversion" based on Debian, with our own
packages which will emulate cobalt functionality (making them act like
current Cobalt units, web interface to go with it, etc).

URL is here (although, not much up on the page at the moment heh):

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbalt">http://sourceforge.net/projects/qbalt</A>

Biggest hurdle for me at the moment is not having physical access to one of
these units - I have access to various cobalts remotely (RaQ
XTR/4/550), but being in other countries, it really doesn't help me get over
the installation/restore CD issue, which is a pretty big thing if this is to
get anywhere.

Any disgruntled Cobalt owners out there want to help out?  Having somebody
locally with a Cobalt I can use to test restore CD's on would be *hugely*
appreciated - right now its my biggest hurdle, and no other developers on
this thing seem to know much about it, unfortunately :-/
