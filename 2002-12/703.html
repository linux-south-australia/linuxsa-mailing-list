&gt; &gt; It's becoming increasingly obvious how many overseas people there are
&gt; &gt; on this list.  As I observed earlier, I don't think anybody "here" has
&gt; &gt; a problem with this, but I'm curious: you overseas blokes, why did you
&gt; &gt; join LinuxSA?  Why do you stay on the list?

I joined because a Google search for some problem I was having threw
this list up... I stayed because I like the other people on the list,
and the fact that the list is not so deadly serious that people can't
spend a day talking about Vegemite or something now and then.

&gt; For me it's nostalgia. 
&gt; 
&gt; However, I must say that I like the radio stations where I am. Well, 
&gt; alright, one radio station. The selection of music here is great.
&gt; 
&gt; I listen to 107.7 The Bone. Only station I have ever heard that plays 
&gt; tracks like Jethro Tull's Locomotive Breath, not to mention Jimmy Hendrix, 
&gt; a lot of Led Zepelin, Deep Purple Smoke on the Water (extended mix), a 
&gt; wide selection of Lynard Skynard (not just Sweet Home Alabama), a wide 
&gt; range of Bad Company, and so on.

That sounds like a very good reason to live within The Bone's service
area (forks mental subprocess to consider homemade relay satellites),
but forgive me for not understanding: why is it a reason to be on
LinuxSA?
