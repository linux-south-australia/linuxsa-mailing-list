Hi Brian,
    As a general rule you should always download from the closest site, the
theory being that the less hops you do to the server, the less bottlenecks
you will encounter. Unfortunately this doesn't really work to sites in the
states unless it is in California (and even then it can be slow), because
the lines to the US from Australia are some of the most heavily used links
from Australia to anywhere else. The link to California can be quick if you
pick your time to download, but once you pass through there to somewhere
else in the US, you pick up all the US traffic on those links as well,
slowing the links even more.

    This means that from Australia going to Europe can often be much faster,
because even though the distance is longer, the traffic is lower. The major
reason that the traffic is lower is that most traffic in Asia is going to
other sites within Asia (or away from your link to Europe), whereas you
would be skirting around the edges to get to Europe and there is much less
traffic being picked up from Asia going to Europe. Again if you pick your
download time, you can get a very quick link.

    As for the links you list, the US sites are in Wisconsin, Virginia,
North Carolina, Minnesota and Arizona. All of these sites from Australia are
on the "other side" of California and so are likely to have very heavily
traffic. The Czech Republic would be the physically closest, followed by
Switzerland and Belgium. I don't know what the links are like to Prague, but
I suspect they may be slightly slower that elsewhere in Europe because it
was a Communist country not that long ago and so likely to be a little
archaic in some of its communication systems (maybe not, just pure
speculation there). Belgium is in the middle of Europe from Australia and
would suffer from the same problems as with the US with extra traffic, but
not as bad, and finally Zurich would be the best compromise site as next
closest to Australia, and also likely to have good communication systems.

    Of course these ideas would be subject to download times and amounts of
data being downloaded. A small file probably doesn't make alot of
difference, but a slow reliable line will always be better than a slightly
faster line that keeps dropping or timeing out. Personally I would try
Zurich, and if I had problems, I would try Belgium before I next went for
Arizona and then Minnesota. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If you wish to download something from Sourceforge you are presented with
&gt; these mirrors.  I wonder what is the best option to use here in Australia
?
