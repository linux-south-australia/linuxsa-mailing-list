I sort of have to agree - but like I maintain - I think some people are
stuck in the past.

It does not apply to multi-GHz laptops and the like that have more high
speed RAM than a i386 had in hard disc space only 10 years ago.

I like my fading menus and pretty colours - otherwise why pay big bucks for
capacity one will never use?  May as well stick with ol' faithful and save
some money..

I know - flame war imminent - but GUIs, graphics requirements, etc - the
'greedy ignorant' desktop user with massive processing requirements to make
fading menus is one big driver of the computer hardware industry.

Don't flame me
a) I said 'one' big driver
b) I know we have discussed this before
c) I am never wrong :-)

Now - can someone tell me where to get the most resource hungry screen saver
so I can leave it running and watch people explode in horror?

Honestly - it sounds like you guys would be happy with your own mainframe.
NO GUI but insanely powerful.

Don't know how the missus would feel about one in the shed though..

&gt; What on EARTH for??

Because some people/companies still write software that relies on it.  For
instance, to flash a BIOS, or talk to a RAID SCSI Controller (although
I should point out that Adaptec are using Linux from a bootable CD
these days, at least on the 29160 controller I was using the other day).

&gt; A bit like still developing C=64 software eh??  Still some die hards out
&gt; there that believe 64K of RAM is sufficient if not an overkill.  No one
&gt; should ever need more than that and a 1.2 MHz 8 bit processor.

I used to code on lower end platforms, because I was impoverished
and it kept my skillset sharp.  All XP seems to spend its excess of
cycles on is fading dialog boxes in and out, a "great innovation" of
UI  :-/
