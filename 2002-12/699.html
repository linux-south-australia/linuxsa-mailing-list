&gt; &gt; I have a couple boxen at work (one is slackware and the other I think is
&gt; &gt; redhat) both have the same version of sshd and no differences between
&gt; &gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Both machines have a user called backup and on
&gt; &gt; each machine I used that user to generate an ssh keypair. Used scp to
&gt; &gt; copy ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the remote machine.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is this: logging in from one machine to the other doesn't
&gt; &gt; prompt for a password, yet the other way around it still asks for a
&gt; &gt; password[1].
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Seems very weird to me, as (as far as I know) they are both set up the
&gt; &gt; same. I used the exact same commands to create the keypairs, to copy the
&gt; &gt; public key over, and I double checked the permissions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone has any suggestions for when I next get to have a go at
&gt; &gt; getting the thing working, it would be much appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; ssh -vvv
&gt;
&gt; from each host to the other will give you an idea of where things are
&gt; going wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Hope it helps,

mmm . . . yes a very handy little command.  

I'm having problems establishing an ssh connection with a remote website and 
the -vvv addition to the line worked well to get the feedback up on the 
screen in shell.  I wanted to print this feedback directly to a file in a 
directory though, and wondered if there was a way to go about this ?

I've tried using tee to get this input into a file but am not sure this is the 
right way to go.  For instance,

I tried:

tee /home/andrew/myfile.txt
ssh -l andrew <A HREF="mailto:andrew@mydomain.com">andrew@mydomain.com</A> -vvv

but to no avail.  A file called myfile.txt gets created but that file is 
empty.  Furthermore, none of the debugging output is printed to screen.

I'd welcome pointers on where I'm going wrong here please.

Cheers,

Andrew Lord
