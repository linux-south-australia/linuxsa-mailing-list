&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i686 is AMDs Athlon and all Pentiums after the PentiumPro including II,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; III, IV and Celeron. 
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; And the PPro, I believe.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Yes, I meant this but didn't say so.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure I totally agree. I used to own a pentium pro and could not
&gt; run anything compiled for i686 (illegal instruction).

I can't explain this at all. Unless maybe it was a PPro without MMX (if
there was such a thing, I know there were different PPro versions) and the
binary had MMX switched on.

&gt; Unfortunately the same happens on my AMD K6-2 machines. :-(

I think that is to be expected as per the original post, which listed K6-2
as an i586. K6 == 5 in Intel's language.

&gt; It's also worth noting that i686 (architecture) is different from 6x86
&gt; (Cyrix MII CPU). Stuff compiled for the i686 architecture no worky on
&gt; Cyrix 6x86.

Unless I'm missing something that also seens to agree with the original
post (which included Cyrix/VIA along with the other i586s.) As far as I
can work out i586 also covers every Pentium-class chip that Cyrix/VIA have
ever made. I suppose the gcc docs would give details about any
architecture differences with Cyrix from other i586s.
