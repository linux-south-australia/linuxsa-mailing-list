Ian,

&gt; People choose Windows because the available (commercial) 
&gt; support is much
&gt; more mature and the platform is unified.
&gt; 
&gt; Unix people can't even agree on standard email formats let 
&gt; alone a standard architecture - it's the great undoing of 
&gt; Linux and Window's strength.

And since when could Windows do these things?

A)  STANDARD EMAIL FORMATS

Outlook is full of inconsistent formats.  From RTF to HTML, to Plain
Text -- If you set Outlook to PLAIN TEXT MODE it will *always* reply to
an RTF email in RTF.  And use those annoying blue lines.  It's most
frustrating.  Consistency, maturity, unified?  Hah!  It even removes
line breaks for you and messes up emails unless you turn that feature
off.

B)  ARCHITECTURE

Unix has a brilliant cross-platform architecure that allows flexibility,
like being able to run Linux programs under BSD, or being able to copy
configs from any distribution and throw them straight into another.  I
wouldn't dare do that on Windows.  Imagine copying registry settings
from Windows NT4.0 to Windows 2000!

Or are you referring to the fact that there are different locations for
/etc directories, and the like, according to distribution?  If so, let's
take a look at Windows.

INSTALL DIRECTORY

Windows 98   - C:\WINDOWS
Windows NT   - C:\WINNT
Windows 2000 - C:\WINNT
Windows XP   - C:\WINDOWS
Red Hat	 - /
FreeBSD	 - /
Debian	 - /

HOME DIRECTORY

Windows 98	 - C:\WINDOWS *or* C:\WINDOWS\Profiles\login name
Windows NT	 - C:\WINNT\PROFILES\%username%
Windows 2000 - C:\Documents and Settings\%username%
Windows XP	 - C:\Documents and Settings\%username%
Red Hat	 - /home, /usr/home
FreeBSD	 - /home [symlink], /usr/home
Debian	 - /home

TEMP DIRECTORY

Windows 98	 - C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
Windows NT	 - &lt;not sure, possibly
C:\WINNT\Profiles\%username%\Local Settings\Temp
Windows 2000 - C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Local Settings\Temp
Windows XP	 - C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Local
Settings\Temp
RedHat	 - /tmp
FreeBSD	 - /tmp
Debian	 - /tmp

OK, so you could also argue that Windows 95 and Windows NT are different
architectures, and you're right, they are.  But overall consistency?
Not really.  I'd say that's comparitively gross.  Sure you can specify
where you want to install Windows to, but at least under Linux, it's
consistent.  You have specific directories that do specific things, and
although they all exist in the same logical directory, their mount
points are irrelevant.  Windows is entirely different.  Windows'
Strength?  NO! WEAKNESS!!


Additionally, why are you responding to emails without quoting anything?
I have no idea what you're responding to if you don't quote.
