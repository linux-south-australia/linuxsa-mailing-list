Hi Ian (& All),
    I don't know about this virus in particular, but I
recognise the Level3.net reference. My network has been
probed over the last few days from several places around the
world (some last night while I was online, but I failed to
catch it in time). Logins at Level3 occurred 4 times out of
9 different probes using several different protocols. From
the look of it the "attacks" looked like script kiddies. All
of the attacks failed, but I would suggest that some of
these script kiddies have just "discovered" a new area to
play in where they think they  may not be caught. If they
continue to probe my network over the next few days I will
email <A HREF="mailto:abuse@Level3.net">abuse@Level3.net</A> and send them my logs. Apart from
this, I don't think that there is much you can do.

    Last time I was seriously probed and a hack attempt was
made (from Malaysia and another from Thailand) I contacted
the Federal Police who told me it wasn't their problem and
to contact the State Police. The Qld. State Police Computer
Crime Unit told me to contact the Malaysian and Thai Police
and that they didn't want to know either. So what can you
do?

    Even though a crime was being committed in this country
(by state and federal Law) through the Internet, there was
nothing the State or Federal Authorities would do about it.
I know this doesn't help, but...
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: [OT] Virus, who has the virus?


&gt; This just turned up on my previous LinuxSA access account.
Has to be a
&gt; virus but was wondering if anybody could work out where it
had come
&gt; from. Must have been somebody from this list though
perhaps not a
&gt; current member.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
