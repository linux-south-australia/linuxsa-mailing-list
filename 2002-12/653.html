&gt;I have also heard it said that Canadians have a higher percentage of 
&gt;private gun onwership than Americans, but with a lower percentage of 
&gt;deaths related to gun violence.

At the risk of starting a rather long thread, Switzerland is in a similar
situation to Canada, with very high rates of private gun ownership, I'm 
unsure of the exact figures and how they compare to the US (and if I 
remember correctly it's something to do with their military reserves, 
weekend warriors and so forth)  They also are purported to have very low 
percentages of gun-related deaths.

Certainly I think the perception we have of Americans being gun-crazy is
a little overdone, perceptions tend to be a little biased when all you 
have to rely on is media reports.  We just hear about all the mass shootings
when they happen.  One would think that road deaths would be more of a 
problem in the US than gun-related ones.....

(I'm not suggesting gun control is a bad thing, in fact I agree with it
wholeheartedly if it's done in the correct way, but in this country at 
least the issue was hijacked by a bunch of bureaucrats who had very little
understanding of what they were on about)

just my 2c ;)
