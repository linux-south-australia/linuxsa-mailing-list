&gt; The only reason you curse is because you can't find the terminal

No.  I don't find anything right.  I do know about the MS-DOS window,
but that's a toy.

&gt; I've seen that happens at times - sometimes I hide it deliberately
&gt; just to watch someone go in to withdrawal and run around in circles
&gt; making a big point about it.  Quite amusing..

You're missing the point.  The MS-DOS window is as good as useless.

What makes me curse is the fact that doing just about anything is so
painful.  Just replying to a mail message is thwarted by the lack of a
real editor.  How do I reformat paragraphs?  How do I remove the
blanks in the "&gt; &gt;" of doubly quoted text?  How do I turn upside-down
messages the right way again?  How do I convert the text \"Mcleod,
Ian\" to Ian Mcleod?  Like other people forced to use Microsoft, I
give up and send out a messy message, but it goes strongly against the
grain.

&gt; I have trimmed my email message so Mutt doesn't crash

No, mutt doesn't crash.  The point I was making was that careful
trimming is difficult in a toy environment.

&gt; I hope that's okay..

By throwing the baby out with the bath water, you've rather proved my
point.
