&gt; At the risk of starting a rather long thread, Switzerland is in a similar
&gt; situation to Canada, with very high rates of private gun ownership, I'm 
&gt; unsure of the exact figures and how they compare to the US (and if I 
&gt; remember correctly it's something to do with their military reserves, 
&gt; weekend warriors and so forth)  They also are purported to have very low

ah look I didn't mean to start a great long thread/debate.
In short both you and Richard are right and the things/issues
you mention all feature in the film.  In fact it's sort of the
point, eg. that Canadians have just as high gun ownership as yanks
but a far lower rate of guns deaths.  The film examines why this
might be the case, obviously there's no simple reason.

It's a combination of a very funny film (where does he find all
those complete nutters? not to mention Bush and other pollies get
a good serve, and corporates like Kmart and Lockheed Martin) and
very disturbing/tragic (eg. he chronicles the US' involvement since
the 1950s in overthrowing foreign govts and the resulting deaths of
millions of civilians, and murders like the Columbine thing of course).
Oh and the bank in Michigan (I think it was) where you open an account
and get a free gun, and he does. In short (or shorter): go see it!

Dave.
