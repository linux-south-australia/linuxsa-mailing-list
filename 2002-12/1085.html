The settings i used were, Q0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2  add this to the
additional options to pass to the modem when asked.

This is without the AT at the start as e-smith puts this in.

This will get you e-smith working just fine.
it took me hours to figure out what e-smith was doing and I only found
it out by looking through the /etc/ppp/peers file.

Have fun

&gt; Thanks so the infomation as it is i was using an e-smith server to do the
&gt; internet sharing, well you have shead light on to the suject, did you get it
&gt; working under linux as i would like to get the full speed of the 128k
&gt; working as the rs232 will only allow about 115.2k.
&gt; I will do a new reinsatall of e-smith 5.5, I do like this product as it is
&gt; very easy to install and configure get it working .
&gt; 
&gt; I has having some problems finding the documents on the linuz sa listings I
&gt; have no idea what month/year
&gt; 
&gt; Do you need to add anything special in to esmith apart from the at commands
&gt; as you have stated in the rest of the email.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers Paul Mullins

&gt; Many thanks

&gt; 
&gt; I'll add to what Rhett says too,
&gt; 
&gt; I used the rs232 port as I was not quite sure how to get the modem
&gt; working under USB. I did do insmod acm and it installed fine with Redhat
&gt; detecting the modem (i ran kudzu after insmod-ing ACM) just fine, funny
&gt; thing was I was unsure what to do next! *grin*
&gt;  Was I supposed to link the /dev/modem to /dev/USBtty0? I'd be happy to
&gt; here form someone who has done it?
&gt; 
&gt; Using the RS232 post under Redhat does not work using Redhats ISDN
&gt; configurator I needed wvdial to to tell me what AT commands would work.
&gt; The ATZ command was not enough to get the NT1 to go.
&gt; 
&gt; If you need them let me know I have them written down somewhere, but
&gt; just run wvdial and all will be well.
&gt; 
&gt; If you use e-smith, it is busted, else weird. e-smith adds an AT command
&gt; to any additional commands you put in during install. eg if you needed
&gt; "AT &C1 &D1" what you would get from e-smith would be "ATAT &C1 &D1" and
&gt; that is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Keep me posted
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hello,
&gt; &gt; I am needing a little help in getting this beast working, I have it
&gt; working
&gt; &gt; under winblowz in DVO mode and would like to setup a dialupserver to my
&gt; isp
&gt; &gt; with it.
&gt; &gt; I have two ways of doing this and need a little help in the working.
&gt; &gt; 1. is via the rs-232 connector
&gt; &gt; 2. is via the USB
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I believe I only need the at commands to send to the NTU unit and treat it
&gt; &gt; like a modem, this is where I go ?????
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anybody got one of these units working under linux, I dont want to go
&gt; &gt; and buy a pci card when the unit has many connectors that could be used.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks In Advance Paul Mullins
