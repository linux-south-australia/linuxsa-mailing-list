Hi everyone, 

I heard from Ian Loxton that you are demoing Lycoris this weekend at the installfest.
Over the past few days I have been talking to one of the Techs at Lycoris about some unsupported hardware issues.

The responese have been nothing but excellent and extremely prompt. I thought that others on this list may also like to see
the emails and responses that I have sent and recieved. Read from the bottom up.

Oh, and if I don't make it to the installfest I hope it all goes great

Nathan Millhouse

Wayne, 

No worries thanks you all your help, if you could let me know in the future when a solution has been

developed for this issue it would be greatly appreciated.

Nathan,

I just talked with our CTO.  One of our volunteer developers has been tasked with the Promise MB project.  
I know he has at least one other project with a higher priority, so I can't say when we will see something.  Hopefully soon.

Wayne,

Thank you for your prompt response.

With regard to the MB support issues I will patiently await a response as working within the IT industry myself I realize that

solutions to problems may not arise as quickly as we all may like even though people may be working hard to solve them.

With what you have said about the NIC being detected later and working OK makes much more sense even though it initially said “None”

next to that device type during initial hardware detection. I was very surprised that it wasn’t picked up but as you have said this should work later.

Thanks once again.

Nathan,

I've been doing some research on your MB, but I have not come up with any good news yet.  Some of our community members thought they had it taken care of last month, but it did not work.  I have 
contacted Promise but have not received an answer yet.  I'll do some more searching and keep you informed.  Unfortunately, I do not have that MB, so I can't do any testing myself.

In the install, I'm not entirely certain the NIC is picked up in that initial probe.  I believe only enough hardware is detected to continue the install, so that may be why your NIC was not 
recognized.  I just went into the "Add Hardware" section and via-rhine was listed, so I think there is no problem there.

Dear Lycoris Inc, 

I am writing to congratulate you on a fantastic product. 
I have been using Linux for about 5 years now and I have used many distributions which are designed with all kinds of purposes; secure servers, firewalls, and also desktop workstations. I believe that 
your product is a fantastic step towards creating a Linux distribution aimed squarely at the workstation sector of businesses, especially for those with minimal or no Linux knowledge. Since 
discovering your product I have recommended it to countless other friends of mine as a great place to begin using a Linux environment as a replacement for Microsoft products both at home and in the 
workplace.

Unfortunately the main machine which I use at home has two major components which are not supported by the OS. 

Firstly I have an ASUS A7V333 MB with an onboard Promise 20276 ATA133 RAID controller which supports RAID 0 and 1. Although I have both my system hard drives plugged into this device neither of them 
are using the controller for RAID, both just function as separate IDE devices. My CD-ROMs are connected to the standard IDE controllers and they will not work on the RAID controller so changing them 
is not an option. You can imagine my disappointment when the installer refused to detect any HDDs on my system at all and refused to proceed any further. Being aimed at desktop PCs I can understand 
lesser a focus on RAID support, but many other current Linux distributions will automatically detect this device and use the drives as straight IDE without any issues.

Secondly, the NIC which I use is a DLINK DFE-530TX Rev B which is based on the VIA RHINE chipset. According to the Lycoris installer, it showed "None"

next to network adapters during the hardware detection process before no IDE controller was detected. The machine was probed for NICs during the beginning of the installation process so it is not 
possible that the card was going to be probed after the HDDs were detected.

The fact it appears that there is no support for my NIC has me completely dumbfounded as it is supported by every Linux distribution I have used over the last few years, and is also supported by the 
Linux 2.4 kernel itself. Also, with the product being based at workstations I would have thought that as much support as possible would have been built onto the distribution.

Does the company have any intention of including support for these devices in the near future releases of Lycoris? I certainly hope so as I would love to use the product as my main OS on my computer 
as I cannot use any other distros without windows as my wife currently has only basic Linux knowledge.

I understand that you may not be able to respond to this letter immediately, 
but I would really appreciate some form of response even it is only "Yes" or "No"



Sincerely, 
Nathan Millhouse
