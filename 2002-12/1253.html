&gt; I will argue that this is because Linux is not percieved as a user

&gt; I will also argue that steps need to be taken to change this 
&gt; perception, otherwise, a great number of computer related items will

&gt; user friendly as possible.

Well actually the uptake problem is not a matter of user friendliness 
or not, but rather that PC manufacturers don't ship linux as the 
default OS. Joe Homeuser and the other 98% of the general public won't 
install a different OS if the one they already have does what they want.

If it was a userfriendly thing the PC wouldn't have taken off in the 
home market at all, everyone would have bought Mac's or Amiga's instead 
of those nasty command line driven PC's running DOS.

A home user will invariably learn to use the computer he has purchased 
regardless of what it's running, especially if he's not familiar with 
anything else.
