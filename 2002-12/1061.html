&gt; &gt; Subject:	free beer (as in 'free beer' :-) ) for Linux help this or
&gt; another weekend
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I have a shed full of home brew stouts, ginger beers (alcoholic) and
&gt; standard beer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I need help with setting up my firewall and ADSL wireless gateway and file
&gt; (etc) server.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Compiling drivers, diagnosing driver / network problems, tuning network
&gt; parameters (especially wireless), setting up a firewall, proxy, etc
&gt; optimally for 1 - 2 desktop Internet users and multi-platform secure file
&gt; sharing (FreeSwan or whatever).  Also interested in IPSec to 'tunnel' my
&gt; connection over the wireless link, and how to ensure that the gateway is
&gt; secure from the Internet as well as wireless medium (authentication,
&gt; encryption, etc).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Apparently WEP won't work on ad-hoc networks - which to borrow from Linux
&gt; methodology - is crap.  I'm sure there is a work around, fudged driver to
&gt; make an Access Point or something.  I've learnt that nothing is impossible
&gt; with Linux - just impossible to configure what is possible.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've read up a lot on wireless technology so I am quite familiar with the
&gt; hardware and concepts, but I still need guidance in configuring and tuning
&gt; all of the above..
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; At the moment I am running a Win2000 gateway - and sure - spend lots of
&gt; $$$ for firewall, VPN, authentication, encryption etc software (all standard
&gt; but hard to configure Linux stuff) - it really sucks.  I would not trust
&gt; that gateway as far as I could throw it (at least in the default Win2000
&gt; state which seems to be designed to make one spend lots $$$ on training or
&gt; software to get it to do anything useful - like actually be secure).  I am
&gt; also resigned to using XP for the client machine (REALLY nice screen fonts -
&gt; but that's the only main advantage) which sucks.  Lots of $$$ or dodgy
&gt; software or cripple ware to actually make it reasonably secure and useful.
&gt; I hate it.  I want Linux back - I can actually do stuff with that (once I
&gt; have deciphered the required config files).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Basically I don't want some stingy sod ripping off my ADSL connection or
&gt; file server over wireless or being hacked in to over the Internet (the
&gt; latter is the relatively easy bit!)
&gt; &gt;
