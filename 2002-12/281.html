&gt; &gt; Fair enough. I mean, asking a hardware question isn't unreasonable,

&gt; Take side swipes at me if you will.

Alright, if you're offering.

&gt; But are you coming to the InstallFest to help out? Wrote a significant
&gt; amount of its documentation? Organised its show bags? Setup a community
&gt; software distribution network?

Sadly, this InstallFest is schmack-bang in the middle of a prearranged
personal event. I'd be lynched (then probably used as a floor
polishing device) if I didn't attend because of "work" :-)

&gt; &gt; I didn't realise that that made a dual-way PIV motherboard. What are
&gt; &gt; you looking at specifically in the PIV department?
&gt; 
&gt; They don't make Dual PIV boards at all.

That's what I thought, though Even seems to think that they make some
for the higher-end PIV processors. Hmm!

&gt; &gt; I'd say a box based on a similar platform would be more than adequate
&gt; &gt; for your SQL Server, particularly if it is currently surviving on
&gt; &gt; 450MHz PIIs.
&gt; 
&gt; LOL - reading between the lines, it's not suriving.

True, but you see what I'm angling at, right? It's *running* on the
PIIs, so I'd expect it to fly on PIII Xeons.

&gt; &gt; Also, I'd say you'd want to go for something with a SCSI backplane,
&gt; &gt; rather than IDE. You get all the groovy hot-swap features, as well as
&gt; &gt; a faster I/O platform.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure I've seen IDE hot swap drives.

Yeah, I think I've seen these jobbies that take two IDE drives and
spit them out as a single SCSI device. I'm not sure that Intel do that
kind of thing with there IDE stuff. I'm yet to pop out a drive whilst
the machine is running to see what happens. I might do that shortly.
