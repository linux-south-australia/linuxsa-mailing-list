&gt; Dang, you get to loiter with some cool people.

Come to the AUUG conferences!  We always have cool people there.  BTW,
do any of you have suggestions for next year?

&gt;&gt;   He said he was disappointed how little innovation they had shown.
&gt;
&gt; Were his comments directed at the UI, or Unix in general (e.g. kernel
&gt; features)?

He didn't say much; we got distracted.  Knowing Rob, I suspect he was
thinking about kernel features.  He runs Plan 9 on his laptop, and it
looks *very* bare (no icons, colours, hardly even frames), but there
are some interesting things he can do with it which I haven't seen
elsewhere.  Unfortunately, I don't know much about Plan 9, and I don't
have time to look at it, but I'm sure there are some interesting
lessons to be learnt there.
