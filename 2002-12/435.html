This 'virus' has been registered as a hoax discovered in June 2001.

McAfee AVERT Labs would like to inform you of a new email HOAX.
We are advising users who receive the email to delete it and DO NOT pass it on
as this is how an email HOAX propagates.

Below is the actual text from the message that may be received via email.

I received this from a reliable family friend this morning. 10/28/01 BIG
TROUBLE !!!! DO NOT OPEN "WTC Survivor" It is a virus that will erase your
whole "C" drive. It will come to you in the form of an E-Mail from a familiar
person. I repeat a friend sent it to me, but called and warned me before I
opened it. He was not so lucky and now he can't even start his computer!
Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would rather receive this 25
times than not not all. If you receive an email called "WTC Survivor" do not
open it. Delete it right away! This virus removes all dynamic link libraries
(.dll files) from your computer. This is a serious one. 

Again, if you receive this email delete it and DO NOT pass it on. 

McAfee AVERT 
Removal Instructions

Ignore or delete this email and do not forward to others.

Subject: Warning?


Is this genuine or just spam FUD?

"  PLEASE FORWARD TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. For those that don't 
know, 'WTC' stands for the World Trade Center. This is very dangerous 
because people will open it right away, thinking it's a story relating 
to 9-11. Do not open WTC Survivor"...It is a virus that will erase your 
whole "C" drive. It will come to you in the form of an E-Mail from a 
familiar person."

Brian
