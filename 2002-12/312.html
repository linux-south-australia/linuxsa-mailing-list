&gt;That's probably more accurate, in fact.  I pulled that figure out of my
&gt;backside because I was too lazy to go and look it up while I was
&gt;composing that email :-)
&gt;
&gt;However, Windows 2000 + 25 CALs comes to about $2350.

Sounds about right, it was 2,997 or something for 2000 + 40 CALS for us.

Point still being, do you get $2350 worth of functionality with the 
server?  Even if you take into account the value added 'features' such
as GPO management and so forth.  Remember on the Unix side of the equation
there are many more value added 'features' that you can plug in down the
track for the cost of your time and not the cost of the software.

This is probably the main reason I would favour a Unix based solution more
than
a Windows based one, as Glen touched on in his post.  If you asked me 2
years
ago then probably I'd have said Windows wins that argument, however 2+ years
of using *nix in our environment for web/proxy/file serving (and a whole
heap
of other minor tasks here and there) has proven many of my original
assumptions 
to be wrong.  


&gt;&gt; it sounds like the 
&gt;&gt; 2000 box would be going in for the sake of it, rather than to 
&gt;&gt; fulfil a need.  Doesn't add up to my mind.
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes I think the same could be said about running Unix 
&gt;for the sake of running it, but of course, not every circumstance is
identical.

Absolutely right there.

That is why I'd be sitting down and ignoring the Windows/Unix argument,
and writing down all the things you must have in your new server
environment,
all the things you'd like to have, and then all the things you haven't yet
thought of that you'll need in 3-5 years time.

After that, go out and find the OS that will do all that for you.  Windows
will probably look after the first two ok, but looking after you in 3-5
years
time?  I'd back *nix in anyday for future proofing..... just my opinion.....
