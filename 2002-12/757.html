Of course it's worth knowing what's happening on your network, sometimes 
just to be able to proactively fix things and/or log things to look at after 
the fact.  Some of these things may just be broken configs on 
machines/routers/etc


It's possible to do the proactive stuff, but it's difficult to tune 
correctly and ultimately may not be worth it (as described before).

&gt; hmm. so is it worth even running an intrusion detection thing at all?  for
&gt; example, Symantec has an all in one device that 'proactively responds to
&gt; intrusion detections' or some drone.  i've posted to the winblows list
&gt; asking if anyone there runs any such devices....  if one doesn't do anything
&gt; except log and read, it seems to be a waste of time..  
&gt; 
&gt; i do appreciate the feedback tho.

&gt; You really want to be VERY VERY careful about proactive stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; eg. What if I start flooding you with icmp packets which are supposedly from
&gt; 
&gt; one of your more important client's email servers?  It'll drop a rule in 
&gt; blocking from the machine .. no email from client.
&gt; 
&gt; Personally, I don't see the risk is worth it:
&gt; - adding rules doesn't prevent traffic getting to you and thus costing you 
&gt; money or degrading link performance.
&gt; - it shouldn't stop anymore things that aren't already being stopped by your
&gt; 
&gt; firewall.
&gt; - most of the issue can be dealt with by using ratelimiting options on 
&gt; iptables which is really what you want anyway.

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; I've got snort going nicely and seeing all kinds of bad stuff when i test
&gt; &gt; it.  My question does anyone on this list have the snort server do
&gt; anything
&gt; &gt; proactive?  i'm sure it would be possible to add iptables rules and all
&gt; &gt; kinds of other things, but i'm wondering what do others do?   seems
&gt; logical
&gt; &gt; to if a CodeRed was seen coming though to add an iptable rule and log that
&gt; &gt; you've added a rule...  any other ideas?
