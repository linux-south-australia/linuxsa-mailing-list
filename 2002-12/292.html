&gt;I agree -- But Windows 2000 allows me to configure a whole array of
&gt;"YES" and "NO" options which define what people are and aren't allowed
&gt;to do across the network.  Samba can't, as far as I am aware.  I doubt
&gt;these features are extremely important, but they can ease the pain a
&gt;little.  It seems more logical to implement a GPO than it is to change
&gt;some registry setting every time a user logs in, even though the end
&gt;result is probably the same thing.

Realistically speaking though, if you sat down and worked it out, is this
(GPOs) actually necessary or could it be accomplished in some other way?  
Are you just using them because they're there, or is there a fundamental
need to have them because PHB Joe Bloggs keeps doing stuff on the network
that he shouldn't be?
Just a thought, not accusing you of anything, but IT always seems to be
doing things just for the sake of it without any "need" to do it in the 
first place (I'm first in the dock for that too... ;)

And on the registry changes when people log in, it's all template based 
through Poledit, and there's templates for just about everything you 
can think of, the main ones we use are for Office/IE, to force proxy
settings and disable menus, stuff like that, but it's all check boxes
pretty much, no hacking logon scripts with .reg files....stuff that...!


&gt;These arguments are better served in an environment where one is going
&gt;to run "purely" Microsoft or "purely" Unix.  I'm only talking about one
&gt;server ;-)

Is there any such environment outside of computer labs??  Any takers? :)
Hence this whole discussion.....


&gt;You mean I should throw out all my MS-RFC's?

You mean you have a copy??  I thought there were none left....dang, you 
better hang on to them, they'll be worth a fortune :P


&gt;there to support anything that comes along.  If it's there, I might as
&gt;well utilize it.  The overall cost of software licensing will be
&gt;probably $2000 including Client Access Licensing, and while 
&gt;it's a cost, it's not extraordinarily enormous.  It's enormous, but it's
not
&gt;humungous.  Well, it's humungous,  but it's not ginormous.  Well, it's
&gt;ginormous, but it's not completely obscene.  Well, it's completely
&gt;obscene, but it won't send us bankrupt.

I'd love to know where you buy your software from.  We did a side-by-side
comparison when we put in a new server for around 40 workstations. 
The cost of Windows 2000 Server + 40 CALs came in at close to $3000.
That kinda tipped the scales in favor of a $200 retail copy of Redhat
for OS software (we used my downloaded version for free, but thats
beside the point...).


&gt;So if we're going to 'invest' (hmm choice of words...) in a 
&gt;Windows 2000
&gt;server for 'supporting' the Windows 2000 environment, it seems that we
&gt;can use the added 'features' of Windows across the domain.

Invest? Hmmm, I can see why you're in IT and not stockbroking ;)

Seriously though, I'd be sitting down and having a think about whether
all those added 'features' are actually needed.  I could be taking you
the wrong way, but it sounds like the 2000 box would be going in for the
sake of it, rather than to fulfil a need.  Doesn't add up to my mind.


&gt;Luckily we're not runnning too much of that slop.

What you said.  Poor old SAG runs too much of it....sigh....
