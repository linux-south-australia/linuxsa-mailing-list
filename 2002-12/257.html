Hey everyone =)

I've been running Gentoo on and off since 1.0 (switching between Redhat and Gentoo)...  There are a few things I really like about Gentoo.

Gentoo is a bleeding edge distro, and I guess I'm a compulsive upgrader =)

At the end of the basic installation for Gentoo, a very minimal amount of packages are installed.  More disk space for other applications =)

The whole idea with Gentoo is to compile every package installed on the computer, using a global set of GCC options, so you can optimise settings for your processor for everything compiled.  I have no idea how much extra performance you can get by doing this, but it seems to be faster for me... (System compiled for an Athlon XP with GCC 3.2)

The portage system makes installing programs easy, and I no longer have to worry about dependencies.  'emerge &lt;programname&gt;' is generally all I need to do =)

Gentoo is an interesting distribution, however, it's not very friendly on dialup connections =(  If you want to install from a Stage 3 install (www.gentoo.org), it will take several hours to download Gnome/KDE, and whatever else you wish to install.  However, I think it's worth the wait =).

&gt; This is a post copied from the CompuServe Linux Forum. Just wondering 
&gt; what the response might be from this list.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
&gt; 
&gt; ============= start post =====================
&gt; Has anyone tried Gentoo?
&gt; 
&gt; I have read some good things about it.
&gt; 
&gt; It appears to be attracting experienced users from the other distros.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the current top 10 ranking from distrowatch
&gt; 
&gt; Rank Distribution hpd
&gt; --------------------- 
&gt; 1 Mandrake 463 
&gt; 2 Red Hat 441 
&gt; 3 Gentoo 300 
&gt; 4 Debian 296 
&gt; 5 Sorcerer 257 
&gt; 6 SuSE 247 
&gt; 7 KNOPPIX 234 
&gt; 8 Slackware 208 
&gt; 9 Lycoris 204 
&gt; 10 Lindows 149 
&gt; 
&gt; A year ago source based distros were almost non existent now 2 are in 
&gt; the top 5.
