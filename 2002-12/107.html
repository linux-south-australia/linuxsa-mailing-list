&gt; Richard / Paul,

&gt; Unfortunately for all of us even though you can get your phone line put in
&gt; by someone other
&gt; than Telstra, if you wish to have ADSL your phone line will still have to be
&gt; used with Telstra.

You can? (the phone line)? Who? I thought telstra was the only gorilla
in that game... Looking at Optus' (really bad) website, I can see no
option for connecting a phone line...

&gt; 
&gt; (Just in case you don't know) Telstra are the only people with CMUXs and
&gt; DSLAMs at the exchanges
&gt; which is what you have to get your phone line jumpered into to be able to
&gt; get ADSL line sync.
&gt; I have heard rumours about Optus starting to deploy these devices themselves
&gt; but as yet I have seen
&gt; or heard nothing to substantiate that beyond a rumour. Request are an
&gt; Australia wide company which
&gt; does ADSL provisioning, but they would have to use Telstra equipment also in
&gt; the case that they have none at the exchange.
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.request.com.au/">http://www.request.com.au/</A> Request are not big in Adelaide yet though as
&gt; they don't even have a POP here so I don't think that any
&gt; Adelaide ISP would be using them to provision ADSL services.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately as you can see there is pretty much no way in which Telstra
&gt; can be avoided if you require ADSL.
&gt; Even if you don't see the contact, your ISP will have to provision the
&gt; service through them. This is rather disappointing
&gt; as it doesn't allow for much if any competition. Telstra bill you for the
&gt; phone line per month, then they slug your ISP about $50
&gt; per month to have a 512/128k ADSL link connected to your line. That money of
&gt; course comes out of your monthly ISP fees.

Any way that I can choose a Telstra competitor is a way I'm interested
in following... :)

Note: I am not, and do not want to be, a Telstra shareholder.

&gt; &gt; Hi Richard,
&gt; &gt; I can certainly understand this complaint as I too have Telstra phones,
&gt; &gt; and I am looking for broadband, after being told a heap of lies about my
&gt; &gt; existing and defunct cable connection I am looking at ADSL and at this
&gt; &gt; stage Optus are looking like the go to me.
&gt; &gt; The problem I have experienced is Telstra does not care once they have
&gt; &gt; your money, the smaller operators can be woeful to get support from due
&gt; &gt; to staffing levels, does not leave many choices.
&gt; &gt; For my 2c worth.
&gt; &gt; Cheers
&gt; &gt; Paul

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would gladly use ANY alternative to Telstra for local telephone
&gt; &gt; &gt; lines? All I want is a frickin phone line so I can get ADSL on it. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't even want to make phone calls. Telstra has been a right pain in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the arse. My experiences have been as follows:
