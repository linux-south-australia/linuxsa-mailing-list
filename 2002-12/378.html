If I were there I'd definitely go for Debian, but unfortunately he is in
Jakarta and I'm in Canberra, so what I'm trying to find is something that
is likely to have relatively clear and available community support.

I'm there for him, but as I'm sure you're all aware long distance support
(one-on-one) can be difficult at the best of times.

I've sent him the suggestion of Mandrake that Andrew made (he now has 3
distros to investigate and he's a bright guy, so I reckon he should be
able to sort things out with a nudge every now and then).

cheers
Dan

&gt; In my opinion, if you're going to assist with the install and setup of
&gt; this distro, then you should be suggesting the distro that you're most
&gt; comfortable with.
&gt;
&gt; And, I'd just like to add that considering it's your brother, you will
&gt; more than likely be assisting whether you want to or not *g*.
&gt;
&gt; Don't know much about localisations so can't help you there, but one of
&gt; the windoze guys at work has quite enjoyed Mandrake as his first foray
&gt; into Linux (hardly had to ask me anything at all, which is always a good
&gt; thing *g*).....
