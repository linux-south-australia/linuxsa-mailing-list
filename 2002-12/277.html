&gt; Just out of curiosity, not being critical or anything as we're looking
&gt; at similar options with directory services, but why wouldn't you consider
&gt; the
&gt; following (unless you absolutely have to have Win2k server for other apps):
&gt; 
&gt; AUTH SERVER: 	*nix OS, hosting an LDAP directory
&gt; 
&gt; WINDOWS:		on the workstations only
&gt; 
&gt; UNIX:			PAM_LDAP to allow Unix systems to authenticate
&gt; against LDAP.
&gt; 
&gt; SAMBA:		SAMBA possibly using XFS, which supports ACLs, and
&gt; authenticating
&gt; 			against the same LDAP directory.
&gt; 
&gt; To my mind and from what I've gathered from others who have used ADS, it's
&gt; no
&gt; cakewalk, and tends to be a little inflexible compared to similar *nix based
&gt; options.  Maybe I talk to the wrong people, but nothing I've heard in the
&gt; same
&gt; sentences as Windows ADS makes me want to consider it for our needs.
&gt; However, as
&gt; I haven't had any first hand experience with it, I'll be the first to admit
&gt; that
&gt; I could be wrong in my assumptions.

The main problem with the above scenario that our customers tend to have
is migration of user accounts. Most of them would be running Samba PDCs
with an LDAP backend if they had the opportunity to start from scratch,
but unfortunately, they can't. Funnily enough, there isn't a Native
Windows tool to export all of the accounts to a standard, text-based
format. :-)

Tridge wrote a little utility called pwdump a few years back and that's
not too bad, but doesn't suit all situations.

Up until recently too, there were problems with remote administration
and scalability. Because not all of the RPC protocol crud had been
implemented, it meant that User Damager, Server Damager and other
"essential and easy to use" tools wouldn't play nicely with Samba.
That's no longer necessarily the case. :-)

Scalability used to be a little bit of a problem too. The support for
Backup Domain Control wasn't there a little while ago. Thankfully
there's a few workarounds (documented in the Samba BDC HOWTO from
Samba.org).

Another reason is if you need to run *any* Microsoft network service
that does authentication. Things like MS Exchange, MS Proxy and possibly
MS SQL Server all use magic to talk to the domain controller and
certainly a while ago, it was quite difficult to have an Exchange server
authenticate off a Samba PDC. Not sure if that's still a problem. If
anyone out there has tried this sort of thing recently, I'd be
interested in knowing:

	* The various operating system platforms involved
	* The version of Samba
	* Which passdb is being used
	* Which MS apps work and/or don't work

thx,
Matt
