&gt;&gt; Just wondering if anyone has a Satellite connection to the net running
&gt;&gt; into a Linux box.
&gt;&gt; I have a client that can't get ADSL (too far from the exchange) and we
&gt;&gt; are looking at Satellite as an alternative.
&gt;&gt; After looking a Big Pond's website it appears they only support Windows.
&gt;&gt; They have a note saying they DON'T support Linux and also don't support
&gt;&gt; a solutions that allows you to plug it into a hub.
&gt;&gt; Internode tell me they don't do Satellite, is there any other way of
&gt;&gt; doing this and getting it to work with a Linux box. ie. what I really
&gt;&gt; want is something like the DSL-300 that just plugs in the Ethernet card
&gt;&gt; on the PC.
&gt;
&gt; I have used the IHug satellite option. Again, this was a 56K modem
&gt; back channel. The card that the satellite dish plugged into was just
&gt; like a LAN card and acted as an device that could be brought up and
&gt; down with an ifup and ifdown command. (It has been a while, so I
&gt; can't remember the actual card name.)

Telemann SM200

&gt; The people at IHug also unofficially had support and drivers for
&gt; Linux, if you spoke to the right people. You just have to make sure
&gt; that you get the satellite frequencies right or you would have hours
&gt; of pulling your hair out. :-)

The drivers are a bit of a mess, but the main issue is the
instructions.  I've done a fair amount of work both on the code and on
the instructions; I'm attaching the latter to give you an idea of
what's involved.

The drivers are delivered partially in binary form, which is why I'm
running them with Linux rather than FreeBSD.  I find that after about
two months, the machine wedges.  I suspect that this is the old
version of Linux I'm running (RH 7.0), not the driver: there's a
memory leak somewhere.  Apart from that, though, the service works
well, and I often get more than the advertised bandwidth.  I have a
nominal 400 kb/s downlink, but I've had up to 1.2 Mb/s occasionally.
