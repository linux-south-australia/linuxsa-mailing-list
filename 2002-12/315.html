&gt; Point still being, do you get $2350 worth of functionality with the 
&gt; server?

Which brings back the argument, we'll be running at least one Windows
2000 server regardless :-)  The cost will be fairly similar.

&gt; If you asked me 2 years ago then probably I'd have 
&gt; said Windows wins that argument, however 2+ years of using 
&gt; *nix in our environment for web/proxy/file serving (and a 
&gt; whole heap of other minor tasks here and there) has proven 
&gt; many of my original assumptions 
&gt; to be wrong.  

This thread has been fairly lengthy now, of which I've enjoyed because
it's allowed me to broaden and do a hell of a lot of thinking.  You
mentioned here web/proxy/filesharing, but in my environment web/proxy
are already running under FreeBSD, and so thankfully part of the work is
already done.  I came into an environment running WinGate and I danced
and sang the day I let Squid take over ;)

&gt; That is why I'd be sitting down and ignoring the Windows/Unix 
&gt; argument,
&gt; and writing down all the things you must have in your new server
&gt; environment,
&gt; all the things you'd like to have, and then all the things 
&gt; you haven't yet
&gt; thought of that you'll need in 3-5 years time.

That's something that I've done, and now after this thread, I'm going to
have to do again :-)  Although we have an entire company department that
develops on the Windows platform, I can't even think of a good reason to
hang on to Windows for that.

&gt; After that, go out and find the OS that will do all that for 
&gt; you.

------------------------------
*CLAUSE*
Writing emails helps me think.
I ranted a lot.

Did you know I recently learned that since NT4, it's been often the case
of a Windows NT RAS client to dial up, and be elected as the master
browser for their own (dialup) subnet?

That's why half the time when a Windows 2000 client dials up to a
Windows 2000 RAS Server, they can't see any of the servers or shares for
ages and ages.  LOL.

Yeah, I like Unix.  In my honest opinion, I feel very much like a baby
tortoise at the moment.  I'm flippety flopping toward the ocean and I
know where I want to go, but I'm not sure what I'm going to encounter on
my way there yet.  I might even get eaten by a seagull!  But I think
right now Windows is doing that charm thing, and giving me a false sense
of security and I've got this feeling that I know that Windows *will*
work, and I know that Unix *might* work.  And the reason I am thinking
like that is because of these, reasons: 

(and it all comes down to experience.)


1.  I know that if I install Windows 2000 Server and start DCPROMO I'm
going to have a system in place.  I know that I am going to be able to
plug it straight into my DNS, and I know that I'm going to be able to
create a "Domain" environment for my Windows 2000/XP workstations, and
while everything will still be Windows, I'll be confident that it works.

2.  I know that if I install Samba as a Domain Controller I'm still not
sure of what I'm going to expect.  I know that I have to work out how
things like PAM_NTDOM work and I'd not have all the tools I needed in
front of me [That's debatable in itself -- the internet is my toolkit,
and learning how things WORK is what makes Unix so great!]

I know that if I get it up and running I'll be extremely unsure of just
'how well' it's working.  I've assembled the thing myself and I'm not
100% confident it's working exactly right.  It might break.

Are these confidence barriers or experience barriers?
Do I really have anything to worry about?  Is it really that hard?  It
feels like a big step in my own progression with Unix.
Maybe I should start attending those regular meetings ;)  But first, I
need to reassemble my entire master plan.


Off to the planning board.


Keeping you all informed!


Adam
