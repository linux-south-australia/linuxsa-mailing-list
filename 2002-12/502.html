&gt; What is the best way to go and still allow for the future, ISDN, ADSL or stick with the POTS?

ADSL is cheap, good, and fast enough (and upgradable enough) for some
time in the future, depending on your needs... by the time you need
over 1500kbps down, there'll be something newer and cheaper, or ADSL
will be up to 8Mbps or so.

Unless you have a reason not to go with ADSL, go with it. Between the
lists' two favourite ISPs (Adam and Internode, both of whom contribute
to this community significantly), I'm certain you can find something
that suits -- Internode have recently increased their data allowance,
and Adam have the 18 month no setup cost "Turbo ADSL" at the moment.
Personally, I just went with Adam, and their service has been
excellent (certainly the equal of Internode's excellent service, which
I had the pleasure of last time I had ADSL -- I've moved a few times
for unavoidable reasons). Of course, other ISPs have their deals,
which I'm sure are competitive, but I've not had any experience with
them, so I can't comment.

ISDN is good if you've got the cash, and really really want some
ISDN-specific advantage (like call quality, or something) or can't get
ADSL. POTS is dead, IMHO -- unless you have very low-end
requirements... which, indeed, may be the case -- if you dial up once
a day to get the weather and your email, POTS is probably the way to
go... If it's more than three times a day, or you find yourself
needing a second phone line, ADSL could be cheaper anyway (don't
forget to count the cost of phone calls when calculating costs). If
you can't get ADSL, it may also be worth considering the various
wireless options -- and there are quite a few...

Of course, ISP's could probably tell you that they still sell lots of
POTS accounts, so they can't quite be dead yet (but then, I'm sure
they'd all prefer to sell you an ADSL account anyway :).
