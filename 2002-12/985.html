&gt; &gt; Looking at Thatcher and Blair, I'm quite in favour of no one party
&gt; &gt; having an overall majority!

&gt; There is no real solution to democracy. Rule by the majority if that
&gt; majority is decided by people who have been persuaded by a minority
&gt; simply upsets the whole idea of this type of representation.

True. There are too many ifs... IF you can devise a perfectly fair
system, and IF all the electors make their choices based on an
intelligent, rational assessment of the various candidates' merits,
and IF the politicians, once elected, put the welfare of those
governed before their own career... and IF you can solve all these
without coming across a whole next level of IFs...

Arthur C. Clarke had an interesting idea; his colony of a few thousand
people on an otherwise uninhabited planet reckoned that since anyone
who wanted to be a politician was ipso facto unsuited for the job, the
best way was to remove all the gubbins and simply pick a new leader at
random every month, from a pool of the entire adult population
excluding criminals and the insane. (How do you define insanity?)

&gt; For example, the Christian Churches have a significantly
&gt; disproportionate amount of influence over the current Australian
&gt; system and whilst, thank God (!), we're not a theocracy last time I
&gt; looked the Christians happened to form a minority in our modern society.

Course, there's nothing wrong with a TRUE theocracy... but what we
always end up with is a humanocracy with a funny hat, leading to
Inquisitions, jihads, Bloody Mary, etc.

&gt; And if the majority did rule, Australia would still be White, the
&gt; Aborigines would be exterminated, single mothers would probably be put
&gt; in hostels and woe betide those who weren't straight...

Rule One: No Poofters! :-)
