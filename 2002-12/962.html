&gt; No - that would be a lesbiologist :-)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Imagine every  5 current adjacent electorates combined, with electors 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;casting thir vote to elect 5 people in each such large 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;electorate.  The 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;outcome would be likely to be a far greater number of minor 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;parties and 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;independents in Parliament, far more representative of the electors 
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;views than is possible at present.

&gt; &gt;I'll have to think about this, must admit I don't quite understand
&gt; &gt;what's supposed to happen.

Well, what else do you call someone who thinks it's a good wheeze to
ignite a hundred litres of a stoichiometric mixture of oxygen and
acetylene, and allows pigeons to nest on his bed?

&gt; Imagine each of the five original electorates would elect one Labour 
&gt; member with 51% of the vote.  Labour would "win" 5 seats.
&gt; 
&gt; Now amalgamate the electorates.  51% will now only guarantee 2 seats, 
&gt; but on a preferential system would probably "win" 3.  The remaining 
&gt; seats would be allocated to the next most popular candidates - perhaps 
&gt; one Conservative and one Independent.
&gt; Thus whereas before those who voted Conservative or Independent would 
&gt; not have their preference recognised, they would now.
&gt; The overall result would almost certainly be that no one party had more 
&gt; than 50% of the seats in parliament, but maybe that's not a bad idea.

Oh, right, I get it. How to do proportional representation but still
make sure everyone's MP is reasonably local. I think you'd have to do
something a bit more complicated than simply amalgamating existing
electorates, but it seems like a reasonable idea.

Looking at Thatcher and Blair, I'm quite in favour of no one party
having an overall majority!
