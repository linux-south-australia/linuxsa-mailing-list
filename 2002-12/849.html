&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a working samba on a redhat 6.2 box running version 2.0.6-9:
&gt; 
&gt; samba-2.0.6-9
&gt; samba-client-2.0.6-9
&gt; samba-common-2.0.6-9
&gt; 
&gt; Samba is not running as a pdc, it is running filesharing and some
&gt; printing. There is one share that houses the files for a small sybase sql
&gt; db. There is about a dozen clents, mostly W98, but a couple of 2K and XP
&gt; boxes as well. There has been no access issues to date.
&gt; 
&gt; Should I upgrade this to a newer version, and by which method (src or rpm)

I personally upgrade when the newer version:

  a) fixes a known problem I have
  b) has a feature I need
  c) contains security fixes

By the sounds of things, you don't need to worry about a) or b). c) may
be a good reason. There may have been a security advisory since 2.0.6
(we're up to at least 2.2.7 now). If Samba is on a trusted network (is
there such a thing), you may decide that following change management
procedure (planning, testing, etc) makes an upgrade less worthwhile.

As for which media to use:

  * Both source and RPM will work
  * It's probably best to go with what you know, in case of emergency
  * I usually compile from source (but that's more to do with some of
	the compile-time options that package maintainers frequently
	leave turned off)

The good thing about compiling from source over RPMs is rollback. Should
you do the upgrade and find that it makes things worse, it's easier to
revert to an older copy of Samba if you've taken this into account at
compile time. This can also lead to a system that has dozens of copies
of dozens of applications and services installed and which ones are
which is anyone's guess, but if you have some kind of process in your
mind, and stick to it, you should be fine.

&gt; Will the existing smb.conf file still work ok with the newer version?

There may be one or two changed parameters, but if you use the testparm
utility that comes with the Samba distribution you end up using, you'll
know for sure.

Hope it helps,
Matt
