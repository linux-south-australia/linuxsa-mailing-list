Stephen,

&gt; It's not going to get any better. Debian really sucks for getting a 
&gt; workable system from install. Its only real advantage is that it tends

I got a workable system straight from install the first time I ever
installed Debian Woody. True, it was missing X which was a total pain
but I managed to work it out. I should note I'm not exactly a newbie.

&gt; to install what you asked for, so you're free to modify configuration 
&gt; files without stomping on some distro specific "feature". Even this 
&gt; advantage is eaten away by the braindead packaging system that Debian 
&gt; insists on using, which depends on a library of archived details
&gt; rather than examining the live filesystem.

Brain dead?

&gt; I cannot recommend Debian. It sucks, plain and simple.

Own that. You mean: "I think it sucks, plain and simple.".

&gt; If you want Debian's features, I'd suggest you look at Gentoo or some 
&gt; other distribution where the entire system is compiled from source. Or

..a central repository style system? Huh? Sounds like archived details.
Debian's archived details tend to be binaries, Gentoo's source. This is
something that Dan Shearer touched on in a talk he gave at the last AUUG
meeting.

&gt; The bottom line is that Linux is not in a good state when it comes to 
&gt; distributions. Everything sucks in one major way or another. I really 
&gt; miss the system I built up by hand, but KDE and Gnome are ridiculously

Oh really?

&gt; hard to compile, and Miguel's slavish devotion to imitating Microsoft 
&gt; have brought along the delights of Microsoftian cruft to the Linux 
&gt; world.

Miguel de Icaza is making a marketable product; kicking or screaming the
Linux community will eventually realise that it's not elitist and that
other people not so technically adept will want to use Linux.

&gt; That's why I got a Mac, and OS X rocks.

Yeah, and a lot of money too...
