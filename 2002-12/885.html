Pull down your skirt, dear - your prejudice is showing.

The '38 Police Special was designed specifically NOT to kill people, but 
to stop without killing.  That handgun, beefed up to be powerful enough 
to shoot black bear is the .357 magnum.  (Which is why the SA Police are 
armed with 357 magnums &lt;sigh&gt;).

The 44 magnum is designed as a hunting and competition handgun, being 
far too heavy and difficult to handle for anything much else, 
notwithstanding Dirty Harry.

.22 handguns were designed for "plinking", but there are now many 
variants designed specifically for competition.  For quite different 
reasons to those applying to the 44 magnum, these firearms are pretty 
useless for anything much else.

The 45auto was first issued as a self-protection handgun for US Air 
Force aircrew in case their aircraft were shot down in enemy territory - 
basically to give the opportunity to shoot back and run away, or 
threaten people to provide sustenance.

Handguns generally were designed as a cheap and portable alternative to 
longarms (ever carried a blackpowder rifle?) which would provide 
protection against bandits but would more likely be used to put down 
injured/diseased stock, or simply to provide meat for the table.  

Accuracy is always a problem with handguns.  If you want to kill people, 
a rifle is far superior.  Or a bomb, or ...

BTW.  The HUGE difference in the level of firearms crime in the US vs 
Canada shows very well that violence (whether that be with firearms or 
anything else) is s SOCIAL problem, not an availablility issue.
