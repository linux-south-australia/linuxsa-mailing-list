Whilst the changes suit me and I am happy with an extra 1.5 gig, I am a bit
dissapointed that the low end of the plans didn't get anything modified at
all.

I was hoping that the 500 Meg plans would incorporate some form of shaping
( At the existing price point ). If that had happened both my Father and a
few friends who are not heavy users would have signed up. As it is I find it
too "dangerous" to suggest to anybody ( even low "once a internet" week
users ) that they sign up with the cheapest plan, as newbies are foolish and
can easily do something stupid like connect to s streaming video site to
watch the eclipse (or similar ) and end up racking up the downloads ( Excess
$$ ) too easily.

Whilst there are people out there ( and lots of them ) that dont comprehend
Mb and Gb and that they are "downloading" when they use the Internet, I
would find it impossible to recommend a Cheap ADSL plan in the current
offering. Whilst Data caps are in place for many Dial up accounts, the
average home user is unlikely to reach them as they usually share the modem
line with their phone line, so dont stay connected for long periods.

ADSL makes it too easy to end up with Excess usgage charges for the Stupid
or ill informed and until those users are shielded from their stupidy I for
one would find it hard to recommend them.

My 2c worth
