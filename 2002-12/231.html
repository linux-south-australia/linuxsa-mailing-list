Hi

I'm currently going through very similar situation. I client of mine has
a combination of Linux (Debian) and winXP and Win2000 servers and are
after a single file share for all users. Currently they have a Deb box
running NFS and Samba. That all works well, however you can't set the
finer grained permissions they are after (similar to what you are
after). We are currently having a play with RedHat 8.0 and SGI-XFS (with
NFS and Samba). These support ACLs and appear to be working for both
Windows and Linux users. The permissions (ACLs) can be set easily in
both windows and Linux. The bit we haven't tested yet is getting the
permission groups to map between linux and windows. But it is looking
promising.

Password sync. If you are using MS Services For Unix 3.0 you will be
able to do password sync between both linux and windows. This is two
way, eg. Password changes in linux will sync with windows and
visa-versa. Version 2.0 only supports one way sync. As far as I'm aware
you'll need to create new users accounts on each system (making them the
same username) and it will take care of the password sync from there. 
This works by a small deamon listening on linux and windows. When a
password change occurs on windows, it will inform the linux system
(deamon) of it and the relevant changes made to the passwd file. Changes
to linux passwords will be picked up by the same deamon and sent to the
windows system. I'm not sure how it would go under NIS but I can't see
it being too much of a problem.

So have a look at XFS (a filesystem) that supports ACLs. It comes with
it's own backup and restore utils aswel.

I'd be very much interested of what solutions you are able to find as we
have been working on this prob for a few weeks now.

Cheers
Adam

Hey all,

I'm going to give you a run down of some thoughts going around my head,
and because I've never done any of the things outlined below before, and
some of you probably have, I'd love to get some feedback to make sure
I'm heading our company in the right directions.


&lt;SNIP Lots of orig message&gt;



Is there anything I should watch out for, or any good reading references
to the above, specifically something like a HOWTO for password
synchronization.

Ummm I can't really think of anything else, but advice from people
who've done this before would be really really really really
appreciated.
