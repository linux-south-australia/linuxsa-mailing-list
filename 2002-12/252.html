&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to give you a run down of some thoughts going around my head,
&gt; and because I've never done any of the things outlined below before, and
&gt; some of you probably have, I'd love to get some feedback to make sure
&gt; I'm heading our company in the right directions.

[snip]

As you've probably already seen, there are a number of ways of achieving
what you're after:

	* Using third party software such as NISGINA and commercial
	alternatives
	* Using Microsoft's SFU and other UNIX compatibility stuff
	* (As Richard mentioned) Run Winbindd
	* Use a unix box as the PDC

NISGINA (or any Windows GINA) is kind of like a PAM module. It is used
to replace the Windows login screen / authentication DLL and allow you
to authenticate through different means. Novell's Netware client for
Windows NT/2K ships with a GINA for Windows (hence the login screen
changing). NISGINA is a GINA that allows a Windows machine to
authenticate using NIS or NIS+. Unless you have a reason to go with
NIS/NIS+, this probably isn't an option worth pursuing.

Microsoft's SFU and other UNIX software is probably also not worth
pursuing. At MCSE school, they'll teach you that Windows NT is
completely UNIX compatible. By "completely UNIX compatible", they mean:

	* It comes with a telnet and an FTP client
	* Microsoft TCP/IP printing is mostly LPR/LPD compatible
	* standard tools (with not-so-standard syntax) such as route and 		arp
exist.
	* There's a POSIX subsystem under Windows that allows you to 		compile
and POSIX compliant application on Windows. I've 		never heard of this
working.

I haven't come across a copy of SFU, but looking at their website, the
list of features is quite small and probably won't be a complete
solution. Besides, you have to pay for it :-)

Richard's suggestion of using Winbindd is a good one. When using
winbindd (check out the documentation that's included with the latest
version of Samba from samba.org), your UNIX machine effectively creates
a workstation trust with the NT domain (the same way an NT workstation
or a Member server would), which allows something like this:

	Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 linuxserver tty1

	login: Administrator
	password: ********

	<A HREF="mailto:Administrator@linuxserver">Administrator@linuxserver</A>:~$ 

So, instead of having a seperate UNIX and Windows accounts database,
it's possible to use the Windows accounts database for the UNIX users.
Because winbind uses PAM, you can turn this behaviour on or off for
individual services.

The final method for managing authentication between Windows and UNIX is
to configure Samba to act as a PDC for the domain and to have Samba
store it's accounts in an LDAP directory. This has a number of
advantages.

The first of which is that you can also store your UNIX accounts in the
LDAP directory and set up the 'unix passwd sync' Samba option, which
will tell Samba that whenever a user changes their password from within
Windows, to also change it in the UNIX accounts database

Another advantage is that you can point and Mac OSX clients you may have
lying around directly at the LDAP directory and they can authenticate
using the UNIX user accounts.

Any UNIX system that supports PAM (Solaris, Linux , FreeBSD and
apparently HP/UX, to name a few) can authenticate off the LDAP directory
using the pam_ldap and nss_ldap modules available at padl.com.

Yet another advantage is the availability of GUI administration tools.
There's heaps of LDAP admin tools written for most platforms, but if
you're running a platform that has GTK+ available (possibly including
Windows), you can use Directory Administrator, which is designed for
administering UNIX and Windows user accounts in an LDAP directory.

As you can see, you've got plenty of options when it comes to
authentication. I doubt that any will provide a perfect solution, but
given the nature of the problem, that's expected. As I mentioned before,
the documentation that comes with Samba (grab the latest version) has a
huge amount of documentation on how to do the above and also comes with
a soft-copy of 'Using Samba' from O'Reilly.

You will also find plenty of people around Adelaide who are willing to
volunteer help, as well as commercial companies that support this sort
of thing.

Hope it helps,
Matt
