Bush-bin Laden 'sex act' t-shirt confiscated.

Queensland Police have confiscated a t-shirt apparently
depicting a sex act involving US President George W Bush
and Osama bin Laden, at a popular Brisbane market.

Police say they received a complaint about the t-shirt
from a customer at the Riverside Markets yesterday
morning.

Officers spoke to the stall vendor who was selling the
t-shirt before confiscating the garment.

No charges have been laid.

There's an idea for attracting publicity to the installfest :-)

Subject: Very OT: A new song for the silly season


Unknown author of these words. 
Just the words to take along to any seasonal bash
 and get a good sing song going.

(Sung to the tune of "If You're Happy and You Know it,
 Clap Your Hands")
 
 If we cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.
 If the markets hurt your Mama, bomb Iraq.
 If the terrorists are Saudi
 And the bank takes back your Audi
 And the TV shows are bawdy, Bomb Iraq.
 
 If the corporate scandals growin', bomb Iraq.
 And your ties to them are showin', bomb Iraq.
 If the smoking gun ain't smokin'
 We don't care, and we're not jokin'.
 That Saddam will soon be croakin', Bomb Iraq.
 
 Even if we have no allies, bomb Iraq.
 From the sand dunes to the valleys, bomb Iraq.
 So to hell with the inspections;
 Let's look tough for the elections,
 Close your mind and take directions, Bomb Iraq.
 
 While the globe is slowly warming, bomb Iraq.
 Yay! the clouds of war are storming, bomb Iraq.
 If the ozone hole is growing,
 Some things we prefer not knowing.
 (Though our ignorance is showing), Bomb Iraq.
 
 So here's one for dear old daddy, bomb Iraq,
 From his favorite little laddy, bomb Iraq.
 Saying no would look like treason.
 It's the Hussein hunting season.
 Even if we have no reason, Bomb Iraq.
