Regarding Marmite, the oriiginal name for Vegemite was

Pawill - source Dick Smith.

Let's face it Australians like Vegemite. It is an acquired taste.

I was born in France, and I never developed a taste for it. My
younger brother born in Australia thinks it's great. I think it
has something to do with putting Vegemite on toast crusts for
young babies.

My first understanding of this phenomenum was a friend telling me
that X who he met in a backpackers in London was really great
because when X was on his way home to Oz he gave Andrew his nearly
full jar of Vegemite.
Having spent nearly the past 5 years sending care package to the
UK it's amazing what they don't have O/s apart from Vegemite. 
twisties, butter menthols, fruit tingles, macadamias, dried pears
have been part of the special requests.
