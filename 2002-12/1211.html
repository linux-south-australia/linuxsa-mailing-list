you mean recycled air I think.

&gt; Windows is fine

windows is "fine" if you have experience in using it.
same as unix in other words.
I too can't "get anything done" using windows and doing simple
things (or finding them) take me at least twice as long as
simply typing the command.  But I'm lucky and have never had
to "get used to" windows.  Obviously some people manage with it.

&gt;  The standard 'RTFM' Linux community
&gt; reply and archaic interfaces can send anyone's head in to a spin..  So my
&gt; point is I don't blame people for choosing Windows - at least until Linux
&gt; can be used without being told to bugger off and read the 500 page manual
&gt; that assumes prior knowledge in computer science.

rubbish, you trying to tell us that the "average M$ user" rings
M$ support when they can't work something out?  of course not,
they ask someone they know how to do it, or do a web search 
etc etc.  Same as unix, in other words.
Anyway I don't see anything wrong with telling someone to RTFM
if they haven't made any attempt to help themself.

&gt; And my MUA rocks - because everyone uses it.  No one uses Mutt - so it's
&gt; useless to me.

a very strange statement!  so you choose your MUA (whatever it is)
based on popularity?  I choose things like features I require,
stability and so on (I use mutt if via ssh or evolution if on
my desktop).

Dave.
