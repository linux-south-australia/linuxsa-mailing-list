Hi,

Forgive me for this off-topic post, which was prompted by geography.

The British magazine RAIL recently ran an article about whether the
closed Huntingdon-Cambridge line should be reopened as a railway or
converted to a guided busway. Naturally for a rail magazine, the
article favoured the rail option, and cited the poor accident record
of guided busways in various parts of the world.

A subsequent issue printed a letter in reply to the article, from one
of the promoters pushing the guided-busway scheme. The letter was
mainly commercial puff, with only an oblique reference to safety,
saying they planned to use "tried and tested technology that has
worked for over 20 years in Adelaide, not mentioned in [the original
article]."

I'd be interested to know some background on this. Do they really
work, or is the guy thinking that Adelaide is far enough away for
nobody to be able to refute his point? Do they rock? Do they suck?

May I point out the existence of my own email address in the interests
of not cluttering up the list with OT stuff. The article didn't say
whether the buses' destination blinds would be written in HTML.

I might want to pass responses on to the editor of RAIL, with email
addressed blanked of course, so please indicate if this is OK or not.

Cheers,
Pigeon
