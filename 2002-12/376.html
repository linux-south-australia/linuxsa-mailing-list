In my opinion, if you're going to assist with the install and setup of 
this distro, then you should be suggesting the distro that you're most 
comfortable with.

And, I'd just like to add that considering it's your brother, you will 
more than likely be assisting whether you want to or not *g*.

Don't know much about localisations so can't help you there, but one of 
the windoze guys at work has quite enjoyed Mandrake as his first foray 
into Linux (hardly had to ask me anything at all, which is always a good 
thing *g*).....

&gt; Hi All, my brother, who lives in Indonesia, has just asked me about which
&gt; distros I could recommend as a move away from MS. At the moment, he says
&gt; he runs XP on a PIII 450 (!). Can any one recommend a good distro for a
&gt; newbie who would ideally not have to spend _too_ much time getting
&gt; aquainted with it. Bahasa and Indonesian localisation are important too. I
&gt; would personally recomend Debian to him, except he'd probably disown me
&gt; when he saw the installer. I've told him to look at the debian and redhat
&gt; websites just to get a look at the install manuals.
&gt;
