&gt; Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hi all, I have a Umax Astra 2200 USB scanner that is listed as fully 
&gt; supported under Linux 
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html&gt">http://www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html&gt</A>; but I have been 
&gt; unable to get it to run. I installed SANE and XSane but no luck. From 
&gt; what I have read, that should be all I have to do. Anyone else get a 
&gt; USB scanner to work? If so, HOW IN THE HECK DID YOU DO IT?!! This is 
&gt; really frustrating.

&gt; Are you running 3.0? I think it dos better with USB stuff. Not sure on 
&gt; that though.

&gt;
&gt; Have you tried typing in a console window sane-find-scanner
&gt;
&gt; I have the same problem with my HP ScanJet 6250 cse. Under USB 
&gt; devices, Lindows sees the scanner. And the sane-find-scanner command 
&gt; finds the scanner but Xsane keeps telling me that there is no device. 
&gt; According to an engineer at Lindows they will have to get some more 
&gt; files from the Xsane web site to fix the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Hang tight this will get resolved.

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; as I was mentioning in another post, now that we have
&gt; a lot of new users, there will be questions about a
&gt; lot of hardware. If it is supported under Linux, we
&gt; need to know if Lindows has included support for it as
&gt; a module. Then the problem is which module to load,
&gt; and perhaps if any aliases need to be set up. One good
&gt; path to research is to see if any other users under any
&gt; Linux distro has gotten it to work (search google) or
&gt; if the hardware vendor knows anything, or if any
&gt; particular branch of GNU/Linux implementation has developed
&gt; or posted a particular way to get the device to work,
&gt; or has some facts, how-to's or modules for it. This is
&gt; a tough challenge, but I'm sure there are some good
&gt; answers now for a lot of these devices.

&gt; Well I guess I should of added the comment from David at Lindows to my 
&gt; post.
&gt;
&gt; "Well, at least they're *different* errors! But seriously, we'll get 
&gt; on the USB scanning issues soon. I suspect there are drivers from the 
&gt; sane project that we need to add. SCSI scanning works fine for me."

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ok that tells me that you have from Click N Run Xsane but do not have 
&gt; the Sane libraries. Once you are in CNR type Sane into a search window 
&gt; and click on go. CNR any libraries for Sane. After you have CNR'ed the 
&gt; Sane libraries to your computer then you can type sane-find-scanner. 
&gt; You should get a report something similar to this:
&gt;
&gt; sane-find-scanner: found USB scanner (vendor = 0x03f0, product = 
&gt; 0x0201) at device /dev/usb/scanner0
&gt;
&gt; Also check to see if Lindows finds your scanner on the USB port by 
&gt; clicking on the "L" then "settings" then "advanced settings" then 
&gt; "information". Now click on USB Devices. When the USB Devices window 
&gt; comes up you should see in the left window a USB hub then under it 
&gt; "scanner". In the right window there should be a description of the 
&gt; device.

&gt; Ok, making progress. The command "sane-find-scanner" finds my scanner

&gt; Any ideas what to do next? (by the way, you guys have been great)

&gt; Any ideas what to do next?...... Yes wait for an update to Xsane in CNR.
&gt;
&gt; Here is a copy of the email that I received from Kai Chen at Lindows:
&gt;
&gt; "Hi! Thank you for your reply. We are working on those problems, and 
&gt; will put a new version of Xsane to warehouse. Hopefully that will 
&gt; solve your problem(s). I will let you know when it up and ready for 
&gt; CNR. Thanks again."
&gt;
&gt; Some work still needs to be done to Xsane so it will work with USB 
&gt; scanners. As for now SCSI scanners work.

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Forgive me but I've not understood too much of these posts.
&gt;
&gt; I followed the advice given here 
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html&gt">http://www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html&gt</A>; and bought an 
&gt; Epson Perfection 2400 Photo USB scanner. The Epsons are strongly 
&gt; recommended for Linux/Lindows and are fully supported in SANE.
&gt;
&gt; The scanner is showing under USB Devices in the advanced setting but 
&gt; there is no way I can find of actually using my new scanner. Are we 
&gt; saying here that although this make and model are fully supported by 
&gt; SANE and are strongly recommended for Linux/Lindows because of Epson's 
&gt; support that they still won't run in Lindows?
&gt;
&gt; Please forgive me for not being not too quick on the uptake here, 
&gt; having a bit of a rough time, but I would really appreciate if someone 
&gt; could explain simply what I'm doing wrong and need to do .. or why 
&gt; Lindows isn't supporting a piece of kit that is fully supported for 
&gt; this platform? I am running v3!

&gt; Michael:
&gt; No there is nothing wrong with Epson. The problem is that some extra 
&gt; files need to be added to Xsane so it will work with USB scanners. 
&gt; Currently Xsane works with SCSI (scuzzy) scanners. An update to Xsane 
&gt; will be coming and it is quite possible that when the update has been 
&gt; added to CNR a Lindows engineer will post here to let us know. If for 
&gt; some reason they do not then I will let you guys know.

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I Would like somebody to try this and see if it works:
&gt;
&gt; Installation of USB scanners in LindowsOS... (provided they are 
&gt; supported by SANE!)
&gt;
&gt; Instructions:
&gt;
&gt; * First of all, check that your scanner is supported by SANE:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html">http://www.buzzard.org.uk/jonathan/scanners-usb.html</A>
&gt; * Power on your scanner.
&gt; A scanner file should appear in /dev/usb.
&gt; You can also run 'usbview' and check that your scanner is properly 
&gt; recognized (install usbview from CNR).
&gt; * Download and compile SANE from its sources.
&gt; To download go to: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mostang.com/pub/sane/sane-1.0.9/">ftp://ftp.mostang.com/pub/sane/sane-1.0.9/</A>
&gt; the newest file is: sane-backends-1.0.9.tar.gz
&gt; *Go to the directory where you downloaded the file and uncompress it, 
&gt; then open a console windows and
&gt; type:
&gt; ./configure
&gt; make
&gt; make install
&gt;
&gt; * Edit the /usr/local/etc/sane.d/.conf SANE configuration file 
&gt; corresponding to your vendor
&gt; (epson.conf in this example). Add the below line and comment out all 
&gt; the rest: usb /dev/usb/scanner0
&gt;
&gt; it will look something like this:
&gt;
&gt; # here are examples for how to configure the EPSON backend
&gt; # scsi EPSON
&gt; # option color_correction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
&gt; #
&gt; #pio 0x278
&gt; #pio 0x378
&gt; #pio 0x3BC
&gt; #scsi EPSON
&gt; # /dev/scanner
&gt; usb /dev/usb/scanner0
&gt;
&gt; *to check if the scanner is working open a console window and type:
&gt; cat /proc/bus/usb/devices
&gt;
&gt; it should output something like this (check the P: output):
&gt;
&gt; T: Bus=01 Lev=00 Prnt=00 Port=00 Cnt=00 Dev#= 1 Spd=12 MxCh= 2
&gt; B: Alloc= 0/900 us ( 0%), #Int= 0, #Iso= 0
&gt; D: Ver= 1.00 Cls=09(hub ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS= 8 #Cfgs= 1
&gt; P: Vendor=0000 ProdID=0000 Rev= 0.00
&gt; S: Product=USB UHCI Root Hub
&gt; S: SerialNumber=dc00
&gt; C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=40 MxPwr= 0mA
&gt; I: If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 1 Cls=09(hub ) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=hub
&gt; E: Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS= 8 Ivl=255ms
&gt; T: Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#= 2 Spd=12 MxCh= 0
&gt; D: Ver= 1.00 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff MxPS=64 #Cfgs= 1
&gt; P: Vendor=04b8 ProdID=010b Rev= 1.04
&gt; S: Manufacturer=EPSON
&gt; S: Product=Perfection1240
&gt; C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=40 MxPwr= 2mA
&gt; I: If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff Driver=(none)
&gt; E: Ad=81(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 64 Ivl= 0ms
&gt; E: Ad=02(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS= 64 Ivl= 0ms
&gt;
&gt; * To check if the scanner is working, from a console windows type
&gt; scanimage -L
&gt;
&gt; if it is working it should output something like:
&gt; device `epson:/dev/usb/scanner0' is a Epson Perfection1240 flatbed 
&gt; scanner
&gt;
&gt; now type: scanimage -T
&gt; (it will scan an image from your scanner)
&gt;
&gt; * Install:
&gt; xsane from CNR (version 0.84-2) -this is the frontend (GUI)
&gt; if you have a Epson scanner go 
&gt; to:<A HREF="http://www.epkowa.co.jp/english/linux_e/lsd_dwn_e.html">http://www.epkowa.co.jp/english/linux_e/lsd_dwn_e.html</A>
&gt; and download their program (frontend)

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; if after you issue the 'scanimage -L' command you get the following 
&gt; message
&gt;
&gt; No scanners were identified. If you were expecting something different,
&gt; check that the scanner is plugged in, turned on and detected by the
&gt; find-scanner tool (if appropriate). Please read the documentation 
&gt; which came
&gt; with this software (README, FAQ, manpages).
&gt;
&gt; follow these instructions:
&gt;
&gt; Open a console window and type:
&gt;
&gt; modprobe scanner vendor=0x04b8 product=0x010
&gt;
&gt; The vendor and product id copy it from the table below:
&gt;
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0103) - Perfection 610
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0101) - Perfection 636
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x010c) - Perfection 640
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0104) - Perfection 1200U/Photo
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x010b) - Perfection 1240
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0112) - Perfection 2450 (GT-9700 in the Japanese market)
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0106) - Stylus Scan 2500
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0107) - Expression 1600
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x010a) - Expression 1640SU/Photo
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x0110) - Perfection 1650
&gt; * (0x04b8, 0x010e) - Expression 1680
&gt;
&gt; after that type: lsmod
&gt; You should get something like this:
&gt;
&gt; Module Size Used by
&gt; scanner 4768 0 (unused) &lt;---(this is the important info)
&gt; ppp_deflate 40352 0 (autoclean)
&gt; bsd_comp 4080 0 (autoclean)
&gt;
&gt; if everything is working modify the /etc/modules.conf adding the 
&gt; following line:
&gt;
&gt; options scanner vendor=0x04b8 product=0x010b &lt;---(these numbers 
&gt; depending on your scanner model)
&gt;
&gt; Now try it again,type:
&gt; scanimage -L
&gt; it should output:
&gt; device `epson:/dev/usb/scanner0' is a Epson Perfection1240 flatbed 
&gt; scanner
&gt;
&gt; if it does, type:
&gt; scanimage -T
&gt; and it should scan something from your scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Let me know.

&gt; Kwelness! Looks good. One thing you might want to add for people that 
&gt; are new to this is the unzip command:
&gt; tar -zxvf sane-backends-1.0.9.tar.gz
&gt; or
&gt; gzip dc sane-backends-1.0.9.tar.gz | tar xvf -
&gt;
&gt; Whichever you prefer.

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Chris, THANK YOU for your research into this issue. Because of your 
&gt; info, I now have my Epson Perfection 610 USB scanner working! I think 
&gt; I may have found a much easier way to get USB scanners working. See 
&gt; what you think.
&gt;
&gt; 1. Download the "libsane" library from CNR. You'll have to do a search 
&gt; for it, it's listed under Untested.
&gt; 2. In "My Computer" go to etc/sane.d and click on the icon that 
&gt; represents your scanner manufacturer (in my case, it was EPSON.CONF). 
&gt; The configuration file will open in Text Editor.
&gt; 3. Look for any lines that do not have a pound sign (#) in front of 
&gt; them, and put one there.
&gt; 4. Look for a line that begins with #USB and REMOVE the pound sign. 
&gt; Also, make sure that there is a forward slash between 'usb' and 
&gt; 'scanner'. In my case, the line was "#usb /dev/usbscanner0" and I 
&gt; changed it to "usb /dev/usb/scanner0". Save the changes and exit Text 
&gt; Editor.
&gt; 5. It wouldn't hurt to REBOOT Lindows (do not do a Quick Restart) at 
&gt; this point. I'm not sure if this is absolutely necessary, but I 
&gt; recommend it.
&gt; 6. After Lindows reboots, open a Console window and type "scanimage 
&gt; -L" to see if your scanner is now listed.
&gt; It will look something like "device `epson:/dev/usb/scanner0' is a 
&gt; Epson Perfection610 flatbed scanner".
&gt; 7. Download XSANE from CNR. Enjoy!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Well I tried your suggestion of Remming out all lines in the hp.conf 
&gt; file and I had to add the line usb/dev/usb/scanner0 After a reboot 
&gt; scanimage -L does not find the scanner but sane-find-scanner and usb 
&gt; devices, in Lindows, both see the scanner.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to hear that you still have problems. I would like to know what 
&gt; sane-find-scanner reports to you. On my system, all I have showing in 
&gt; the hp.conf file is:
&gt;
&gt; scsi HP
&gt; /dev/scanner
&gt;
&gt; Whereas, in my epson.conf file, there was already a line starting with 
&gt; 'usb'. I wonder if that's an indication that you do not need to place 
&gt; 'usb' in front of your line? It's worth trying. Of course, I don't 
&gt; have an HP scanner. I'm just wondering if your .conf file shows more 
&gt; content.
&gt;
&gt; In your reply, you are not showing a space between the first 'usb' and 
&gt; the rest of the line. Make sure that you have a space there, and 
&gt; whatever sane-find-scanner reports as a device, place it after the 
&gt; 'usb ' on that line.
&gt;
&gt; After you check all this and if it still doesn't work, I saw where 
&gt; your driver was still considered to be in Beta. Hopefully it won't be 
&gt; too long before it is finalized and it will work for you. Good luck.

&gt; Maybe a script can be made for this. Let me know if that is what you 
&gt; would like.

&gt; Re: Umax Astra 2200 USB Scanner
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; sane-find-scanner: found USB scanner (vendor = 0x03f0, product = 
&gt; 0x0201) at device /dev/usb/scanner0
&gt;
&gt; Vendor = 0x03f0 is HP
&gt; product = 0x0201 is the ScanJet 6200 or 6250 The only difference is 
&gt; the 6250 is a 6200 with a document feeder on it.
&gt;
&gt; Also USB Devices in Lindows shows the scanner as an HP 6250
&gt; scanimange -L comes back with no device.
&gt;
&gt; And the HP.conf file only shows
&gt; scsi HP
&gt; /dev/scanner
&gt;
&gt; So I added the line usb dev/usb/scanner and remmed out the other two 
&gt; lines. So it looks like
&gt;
&gt; #scsi HP
&gt; #/dev/scanner
&gt; usb /dev/usb/scanner0
&gt;
