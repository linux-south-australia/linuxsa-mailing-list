&gt;&gt;I don't think there is any time limit on how long Linux has. It'll 
&gt;&gt;just keep getting better, and more people will find it's good enough 
&gt;&gt;to use.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Not sure how many takers there will be on the 'buy a Mac' suggestion, but I think you're inline for the best comment of the thread here.
&gt;
&gt;Sure, James is impatient, and Ian is, well ... Ian, but as long as the whole linux shooting match continues to move forward, (and there is no sign of it stopping), it will only become a more and more pervasive and persuasive force in the IT world, including for your Gran.

I am impatient.  

I think the general public is not accepting Linux as rapidly as would be 
expected. Given the level of quality software developed for Linux today, 
I would argue that most home users do not need Microsoft at all.  Linux 
has quality email clients, web browsers, word processing software, and 
bookkeeping applications available for it, at an affordable price. I 
would expect therefore, that home use would have steadily increased and 
would have grown to perhaps 25% from 1999 to now. At this point, the 
gaming industry would start to fall in line and then the snowball would 
start to roll.  But instead, this type of story comes up, and it makes 
me anxious:

It does make me wonder weather what seems to be a conclusion will 
actually materialize. I honestly do not think so, unless there are 
significant improvements in people's experience with Linux.

I will argue that this is because Linux is not percieved as a user 
friendly operating system, and in some ways that perception has merit. I 
will also argue that steps need to be taken to change this perception, 
otherwise, a great number of computer related items will remain 
unsupported due to lack of demand, all the more reason to be as user 
friendly as possible.

Hopefully, these will be concerns I can sing Auld lang syne to by the 
end of 2003.
