However,

&gt; &gt; In fact, any attempt by the Mother of Parliaments to amend
&gt; &gt; unilaterally the Act of Settlement could have severe consequences on
&gt; &gt; the Dominions -- sort of like amending a base library during a
&gt; &gt; kernel compile :-)

The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act:

...
2. The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her
Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.
...

Her Majesty was none other than Queen Victoria herself, who, when her
husband died became Empress of the British Empire. Regardless of which,
Australian law clearly recognised Victoria as the right and proper
monarch of the United Kingdom. Regardless of whatever the United Kingdom
might attempt posthumously now, even if they concluded that Queen
Victoria was but a commoner in Buckingham Palace, the Australian law
would still recognise her as the proper heir.

Now the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, Section 4 essentially
says the no law enacted in the United Kingdom after its enactment may
apply to a Dominion-of which the Commonwealth of Australia is recognised
as such-without  e x p r e s s  permission of that dominion

Hypothetically, let's say the United Kingdom's Parliament passed a law
that said "The Monarch of England, after the death of Elizabeth II, is
Sir Paul McCartney".

Our Australian  constitution clearly refers to Queen Victoria, who was
then the constitutional monarch of the Commons and the Lords. Whilst it
could be argued that it doesn't specifically mention Queen Victoria or
say"The Sovereign of the United Kingdom" it would be signficantly
frivolous to argue that it referred to, say, the Queen of Denmark.

Currently, the law of the United Kingdom recognises Elizabeth II as the
Queen of the United Kingdom. In other words, the United Kingdom
recognises Elizabeth II as Victoria's current heir so we recognise her
as Queen of Australia under our constitution.

But what if the United Kingdom now passed this law we have two options:
accept the new law and His Majesty, King Paul or keep our current law
and invite Charles to be King. 

We would most likely have our own, real monarchy. If Charles were to
abdicate-I don't think it's legal for monarchs to renounce the
monarchy, it's a "given" but they can, as Edward did, abdicate-I am
certain we would get someone as monarch of Australia given the number of
relations Charles has. 

Someone somewhere in the line of succession must be "big headed enough"
or"self-important enough" to accept the monarchy of this country.
Eventually, I guess, it would somehow get to me (the 6666th in line of
succession maybe) and I would certainly say "Yes, thank you. Call me
King David the Second" (in deference to the biblical King of the same
name).

Realistically, though, we would most likely say "King Paul" has written
many number one hits, is a fair person who supports charitable
causes-although is frightened away by terrorists attacks occuring
nowhere near Melbourne-and indicate we accept the new state of affairs.

I think we would have a greater conundrum if the United Kingdom were to
become a Republic....

This would clearly make Charles the Monarch of Australia.
