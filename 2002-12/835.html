Windows is probably driving it harder.  Unix kernels go into a halt wait
state when they have nothing to do (e.g. tasks waiting on disk I/O), and
are woken up by interrupts.  Windows doesn't appear to be built on this
model (or is always so damn busy it never gets the opportunity to halt).

&lt;Insert wildy apocryphal tale here&gt;  In the days when 166 MHz Pentiums
were bleeding edge, I had the fan fall off of one that was running DNS
under Linux; its CPU was still cooler than the one next to it running
NT (mind you, its CPU was less than 5% busy at most times).
&lt;/tale&gt;
