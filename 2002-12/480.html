&gt; Yeah. A command line. I can get that with rescue disks too.

Funny, I get fully working workstations after doing Debian installs. 
Maybe you weren't doing it right?

&gt; Want another package? apt-get it, then 
&gt; you have to wade through its configuration files to get it going.

How is that different from any other distro, or from any of the BSD's, 
for that matter?

&gt; That's 
&gt; not even starting on the issue of integration into the rest of the system.

That's an odd statement as well, I've found Debian to be *the* best 
distro in terms of consistency and integration of all packages with the 
system as a whole.


&gt; When the live filesystem is changed, say, by an admin 
&gt; installing a hand compiled version of Apache, Debian's packaging
 &gt; system will still barf

Why would you do that instead of building the package from source with 
your tweaks applied?

&gt; and want you to install the Apache package even though a 
&gt; simple probe of the live filesystem would reveal the information that 
&gt; it's already installed.

LOL! A simple probe? I have a 5Gb /usr partition. That's 5Gb of 
installed debian packages. If I wanted to get a list of installed 
packages by scanning that lot, I'd be waiting for years. *Because* dpkg 
keeps it's own database of installed software, I can get that list 
within a useful period of time.

&gt; That's why people have to stuff around with dummy packages to update 
&gt; apt's internal database by manually forcing it to ape the live 
&gt; filesystem with ever increasing baggages of cruft and interdependence.

I've not had to do that once in my 4+ years of using Debian.

&gt; Try and compile the latest Gnome sources and it's a 
&gt; massive exercise in frustration

But surely that's an argument *for* binary distros, of which Debian is 
an example.
