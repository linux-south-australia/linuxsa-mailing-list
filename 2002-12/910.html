Hi Steve,

I have used the IHug satellite option. Again, this was a 56K modem back
channel. The card that the satellite dish plugged into was just like a LAN
card and acted as an device that could be brought up and down with an ifup
and ifdown command. (It has been a while, so I can't remember the actual
card name.)

The people at IHug also unofficially had support and drivers for Linux, if
you spoke to the right people. You just have to make sure that you get the
satellite frequencies right or you would have hours of pulling your hair
out. :-)

Cheers,
Brad.

Just wondering if anyone has a Satellite connection to the net running 
into a Linux box.
I have a client that can't get ADSL (too far from the exchange) and we 
are looking at Satellite as an alternative.
After looking a Big Pond's website it appears they only support Windows. 
They have a note saying they DON'T support Linux and also don't support 
a solutions that allows you to plug it into a hub.
Internode tell me they don't do Satellite, is there any other way of 
doing this and getting it to work with a Linux box. ie. what I really 
want is something like the DSL-300 that just plugs in the Ethernet card 
on the PC.

Steve
