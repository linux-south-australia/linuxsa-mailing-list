I deal with Mel Turner down at Programs Plus. He does stacks of these 
deals each week and was happy to give me detailed information and 
prices as well as explain how to 'show' compliance.

And just getting back to the theme. Sometimes it is necessary to show 
clients that they can have cheaper Windows solutions if that is what 
they want, they can also have cheaper Open Source solutions.

One group that I was quoting for decided to run W2K on their network to 
manage their computing suite (10 terminals). We quoted all MS for it 
because there was a clear criteria, "none of the free software 
downloaded from the Internet". I did tell them that I could provide Red 
Hat for their server and that their XP Pro terminals would not be 
likely to see any difference.

Next thing I hear is that we didn't get the job but also that they were 
not doing W2K on the server but Red Hat or Mandrake. Now they think 
that they will use me to voluntarily set up their network that they 
bought off an Adelaide-based company. Fat chance &lt;G&gt;

Oh, I am prepared to sell them the CDs through CSDN &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian
