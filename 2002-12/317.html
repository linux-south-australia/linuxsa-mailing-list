The best thing you could do for yourself is set up a test server on a 
spare piece of junk lying around the office. If I were you I'd install 
FreeBSD from the net, install samba from ports and go from there. 
There's nothing like experience to overcome the confidence barrier. Then 
you should try to f#(K with it, see if you can fix it, see if it does 
really work. Once you've finished the hack work, you'll know enough 
about it to decide if it's going to do the job for you, because really 
at the end of the day you are the only one who can decide if it meets 
your needs...
Daniel.


&gt;1.  I know that if I install Windows 2000 Server and start DCPROMO I'm
&gt;going to have a system in place.  I know that I am going to be able to
&gt;plug it straight into my DNS, and I know that I'm going to be able to
&gt;create a "Domain" environment for my Windows 2000/XP workstations, and
&gt;while everything will still be Windows, I'll be confident that it works.
&gt;
&gt;2.  I know that if I install Samba as a Domain Controller I'm still not
&gt;sure of what I'm going to expect.  I know that I have to work out how
&gt;things like PAM_NTDOM work and I'd not have all the tools I needed in
&gt;front of me [That's debatable in itself -- the internet is my toolkit,
&gt;and learning how things WORK is what makes Unix so great!]
&gt;
&gt;I know that if I get it up and running I'll be extremely unsure of just
&gt;'how well' it's working.  I've assembled the thing myself and I'm not
&gt;100% confident it's working exactly right.  It might break.
&gt;
&gt;Are these confidence barriers or experience barriers?
&gt;Do I really have anything to worry about?  Is it really that hard?  It
&gt;feels like a big step in my own progression with Unix.
&gt;Maybe I should start attending those regular meetings ;)  But first, I
&gt;need to reassemble my entire master plan.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Off to the planning board.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Keeping you all informed!
&gt;
&gt;
