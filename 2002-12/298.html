This made my day :)

Enjoy

&gt; In a landmark decision, the Australian Commercial Practices Court today
&gt; ruled that Toyota is no longer allowed to run its advertising campaign
&gt; based on the word "bugger".  Explained Court spokesman Loof Lipra, "Some
&gt; time ago Microsoft took out an injunction against the use of the word
&gt; 'bugger' in Toyota's ad.  It was argued that 'bugger' had been associated
&gt; with Windows far longer and far more deeply than with Toyota's utes."
&gt;
&gt; Lipra went on to suggest that every Windows user in the world uses the

word

&gt; at least once a day as a direct result of using Windows.  "No other

product

&gt; has ever achieved that degree of market recognition and for Toyota to
&gt; muscle in on it was clearly a breach of commercial etiquette and, ipso
&gt; facto, copyright."
&gt;
&gt; Microsoft is now planning a media-wide campaign using their catch-word.  A
&gt; copy that has been leaked to us shows several familiar faces Steven King

is

&gt; shown saving the last page of his new
&gt; 800 page blockbuster in Word and then re-opening it to find that it has
&gt; been reduced to three smiley faces and half a dozen Japanese
&gt; characters.  He smiles wanly to the camera and says "....."
&gt;
&gt; Kerry Packer is shown shaking his head knowingly and muttering "....."

when

&gt; he discovers that the spreadsheet on which he based his latest $4 billion
&gt; takeover has suffered from the notorious Excel 'four times seven equals
&gt; thirty six' feature and that the Ayer's Rock Pie Company is somewhat
&gt; overvalued.
&gt;
&gt; The head of the CIA (face pixilated) is shown shouting "....." on finding
&gt; that Outlook has just emailed the entire contents if his hard drive to the
&gt; head of the KGB.  She, in turn, says, "byugyah" when the file is found to
&gt; be in last year's Access format.
&gt;
&gt; A spokesthing for Microsoft commented, "This is a logical move for the
&gt; company that used "You make a grown man cry" as its advertising slogan for
&gt; its software.  We anticipate establishing the slogan in the marketplace by
&gt; including a T-shirt with "Bugger Microsoft" in every box of our software."
&gt;
