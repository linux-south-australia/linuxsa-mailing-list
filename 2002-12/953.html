&gt; &gt;This is what Tasmanian has for their state parliament, IIRC. 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I think that is what they USED to have.  IIRC the two major parties 
&gt; colluded to reduce the chances of the minor ones a year or two back. 
&gt;  Dunno what they finished up with.

Hmmm... nope... see the description here:

<A HREF="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/Backg/HAElections.htm">http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/Backg/HAElections.htm</A>

or

<A HREF="http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/ha3.htm">http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ha/ha3.htm</A>#Electoral%20System

They still have five members in each of five electorates in their
lower house (House of Assembly)... Their upper house (Legislative
Council) is also different to ours, having fifteen single-member
electorates, and elections every year for two or three of them.
Weird.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;approximately how the Senate works
&gt; &gt;
&gt; VERY approximately.  Different purpose, as you know.

Isn't it partly to help represent the minority groups?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;&gt;The reason we don't have this or any other more representative system is 
&gt; &gt;&gt;that it doesn't suit the major parties, and they unfortunately have all 
&gt; &gt;&gt;the power.
&gt; &gt;&gt;    
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;and because the designers of our parliamentary system favoured
&gt; &gt;stability over representativity... :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Hence the Senate?  Not sure about the motives of our parliamentary 
&gt; designers.  They seem somewhat ambivalent.

Well, the senate only ever has half its members change at a time.
Tasmania's equivalent only has two or three change at a time. I like
the Tasmanian system...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Anyway, how did this get so off-topic?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; This is the LinuxSA list.  How come you are even asking such a question 
&gt; on such a list?   :-)

 :)


&gt; 
&gt; If it helps, you could consider Open Source as a democratic movement. 
&gt;  Thus we users of Open Source Software are naturally interested in 
&gt; issues of democracy.
&gt; Hey!  That nearly makes this discussion ON topic! &lt;proud look&gt;

well done, sir brian.
