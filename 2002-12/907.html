Yeah, I was in Los Angeles during the last set of riots. (There was an 
inch of smoke dust that lie on the roof of USC's parking structures as a 
result or the riots.)

Having only been to Windsor and Edmonton in Canada, I would say that 
there is a smaller gap between the rich and the poor. People are very 
well taken care of there. Most people can afford a home, are well fed, 
and happy. Its a bit different in South Central. &lt;g&gt;

People of economic disadvantage form groups, i.e. the Crypts and the 
Bloods in Los Angeles.  These groups scare the economically advantaged, 
so they go out and get a gun to defend themselves. Its a downward spiral.

Also, there are some mythos in U.S. history, that if marketed, will 
promote gun sales.  The Declaration of Independence...
  

&gt; WE hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created 
&gt; equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
&gt; Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of 
&gt; Happiness -- That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted 
&gt; among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the 
&gt; Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of 
&gt; these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, 
&gt; and to institute new Government, 

Some argue that the government has too much power. The only way to 
preserve the right to abolish the government,  is to own a gun. They 
remind that teh revolutionary war was fought with a militia of common 
folk carrying guns.

There are more reasons why USIANS have an affinity for guns, but you get 
the picture. Economics and history all play a part.
