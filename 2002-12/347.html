OK, So I don't Know EVERYTHING! I admit.
THAT IS WHY ONE ASKS QUESTIONS!!!

Now for one person to ask 3 different lists for 
information about how to do something in a 
certain language (ENGLISH AHOLE) this person
must think he knows everything.  GUESS WHAT?
I dont think he knows Jack #$&$&!!!

Yes I am ticked off by this jerk and I AM VENTING!
If you dont have the knowledge about a certain topic
and you ask a question to the list then what the heck
is the use of the list?

With all due respect, Ben; KMA! If you dont know
what that means (L@@K it UP)


Sincerely,

Subject: 	Re: Another ASP Question

hmm, sent to 3 lists, one linux, one JSP, and one visual basic. only 
managed to get the right *company* on one out of 3. and it was a "please 
do my homework for me" question.

welcome to nothing-better-to-do-than-other-people's-work-sa.

other lists snipped to reduce the spam.

Subject: 	Re: Another ASP Question

ahh, keith, you idiot, you might do better sending this to an actual ASP 
mailing list. as far as i can see, you haven't sent it to any - you've 
sent it to a linux user group, a JSP list, and a visual basic list. i'll 
give you a clue: ASP is a microsoft-only technology. linux people are 
very very likely not going to help you with it. same with the sun JSP 
list; ASP is a competing technology, and they very very likely won't 
help you either. the visual basic list might be closer to what you want 
(at least you got the right company, gee, good work).

sending an email to 3 lists in the same mailing is very bad practice. 
we're not some free help-me-with-my-homework resource. particularly if 
you're an "applications consultant", you should be able to do this stuff 
by yourself (you're a big boy, i'm sure).

&gt; I am using an asp form post application to send numerous sql variables to a search asp page.  
&gt; 
&gt; The page will need to be broken down into numerous pages as the list obtained is too large for one page.  
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the examples that I have seen do an open of the same page by passing an URL with a query string.  
&gt; 
&gt; The items that I would be passing would be too large.  
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some way to do the same thing by using a form post procedure?
