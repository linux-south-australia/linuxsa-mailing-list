I would like it to work for everyone - competition / free market is good -
especially competition of vastly different business models and philosophies.
Both MS and *nix benefit in my opinion from healthy competition between the
two..

There have been a number of articles about OSS and business plans
lately, many of them still grappling with 'how to make money' from free
software. Redhat and Mandrake play in a game of making money, both went
through an IPO and, Redhat particularly, made a great deal of money.
They are now a 'relatively large OSS company' with all the baggage that
comes with that, eg high overheads, salaries, shareholders, fiducial
duty and so forth.

What "we" must remember is that as companies come and go, Linux does not
depart with them. Debian, *BSD, KDE GNOME, and all the hundreds of other
OSS contributors will still be alive and well thanks to the nature of
people who work with OSS and the licenses that protect the software.

Governments who are committing themselves to OSS will contribute through
contracting out development, working to make changes to software that
suits them and meets their cultural needs. The list is endless.

So don't get too worried about business ventures that fail, wall street
might not be too happy,  the headlines in the papers/main web-portals
might not be too happy, but in the end we lose little, except for some
marketing hype. The source is still with us.

And if your akin to some Linux users, don't worry about who's doing what
with Linux, as long as it working for me.

&gt; &gt; I received this in my email today directly from Mandrakesoft:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Despite the many financial challenges of maintaining a fully open
source
&gt; &gt;&gt; business model, MandrakeSoft has always followed the Free Software 
&gt; &gt;&gt; approach,
&gt; &gt;&gt; but in this normally joyful holiday season we are experiencing a
serious
&gt; &gt;&gt; short-term cash crisis.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This troubles me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Right now Mandrake is asking for financial help, and I hope that they 
&gt; &gt; receive it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am concerned that their request for help might leave the general 
&gt; &gt; public with some general confusion that may dampen their effort to 
&gt; &gt; raise funds.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some people will hold that because Mandrakesoft is legally organized 
&gt; &gt; as a business, and not a public charity, that this is a bad 
&gt; &gt; investment, and not see it for what it is: a request for donations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That being said, I feel very stronly that Mandrake should follow 
&gt; &gt; Debian's lead and organize as a not-for-profit public charity.

&gt; &gt; I have also read recent reports that Red Hat has turned a profit this 
&gt; &gt; quarter.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But I have also noticed that a Robert Young has been selling his Red 
&gt; &gt; Hat shares in a spurt that started on 8-29
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I will continue, I have to go to a clients...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, I am back.
&gt; 
&gt; Now the suprt of stock sales may be just a coincidence.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, here are the results from last quarter...

&gt; 
&gt; It appears that they lost 1,951,000, last quarter, so this report looks 
&gt; doable:

&gt; One nore of Red Hat's financial statement notes was interesting:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; NOTE 6—Discontinued Operations
&gt; &gt; During January 2002, the Company adopted a formal plan to discontinue 
&gt; &gt; its network consulting operations. Accordingly, the network consulting 
&gt; &gt; operations were accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning 
&gt; &gt; with the fiscal year 2000 consolidated financial statements. The 
&gt; &gt; Company completed the disposal of the network consulting operations in 
&gt; &gt; February 2002 through termination of associated employees. Loss on 
&gt; &gt; disposal of discontinued operations of $10.3 million in fiscal year 
&gt; &gt; 2002 included the write-off of goodwill recorded in the acquisition of 
&gt; &gt; ENS of $9.6 million, severance and related costs of $0.4 million, and 
&gt; &gt; a provision against accounts receivable of $0.3 million. An additional 
&gt; &gt; provision against accounts receivable of $261,000 was recorded during 
&gt; &gt; the three months ended May 31, 2002. Network consulting revenues were 
&gt; &gt; $2.2 million and $6.4 million during the three and six months ended 
&gt; &gt; August 31, 2001, respectively.
