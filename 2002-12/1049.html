&gt; all quite true, but that's just x86-based computers, which suck.

Technically, they suck a lot less than they used to. It was the case 
that x86 architecture was held back because of the requirements of 
backwards compatibility - eg, the ISA bus lingered on for far longer 
than it should have. The whole point of having sucky hardware was so 
that at least everyone was using the same sucky hardware.

Modular hardware only makes sense when the software can drive it 
properly, which is why hardly any machines today are being driven to 
anywhere near their full capacity. Users are effectively getting 
designer hardware without designer software because publically 
available software is written to the lowest common standard.

There's a lot more you can do on standard sucky hardware than you can 
on a range of varying hardware - there's a lot of issues the 
programmers don't have to worry about. This is where Apple are treading 
dangerously... they have a standard platform, but they're being forced 
to upgrade regularly so they're in danger of losing the benefits of 
specialised software for specialised hardware.

&gt; Linux is trying to copy M$ to "win marketshare" from M$.
&gt; We all know M$ never innovates anything, they just copy or
&gt; buy things done by other companies/people.  Well linux is
&gt; doing the same thing.

I don't think Linux is deliberately copying Microsoft. For a group of 
people to work together, they must have a good idea of what they're 
trying to achieve. Since documentation is typically very poor, the 
easiest way for people to tell each other what they're trying to do is 
to point to an existing example. "Have you seen Word? Yeah? Well, we're 
programming one of them!".

In contrast, it'd be nearly impossible for me to explain to you what 
I'm trying to write, via emails.
