I'm afraid I don't understand what you are getting at.

I thought that the Royal Succession was governed by the Act of 
Settlement which was passed in (from memory) 1701 when it became highly 
likely that Queen Anne would die childless.

AFAIK, the Act of Settlement is law in ALL parts of the Realm.

In fact, any attempt by the Mother of Parliaments to amend unilaterally 
the Act of Settlement could have severe consequences on the Dominions 
-- sort of like amending a base library during a kernel compile :-)
