&gt; &gt; I use OS X because I want to concentrate on the task of writing my own
&gt; &gt; programs and I need a stable well documented platform. There are other
&gt; &gt; tradeoffs that Apple have made to achieve this, so I still have an
&gt; &gt; interest in Linux in order to ensure my continuing freedom to use
&gt; &gt; computers how I want. OS X allows me to develop working code, then port
&gt; &gt; it to Linux so I can stage the development process into two parts.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd have to say that of the OSes I've used, Debian has probably the best
&gt; documentation (leaving aside CP/M where I had the entire source in the
&gt; back of the User Reference Guide and the C64 where I had the whole memory
&gt; map, system call set and circuit diagrams in third party books and the
&gt; reference manual - sigh).

C64 - yeah, I had similar quality docs for the BBC Micro - which
unlike the C64 was designed as a hacker's machine. Wish I still had it
really. Add disk drive, use high res graphics, you've got about 4K of
program memory left and you can STILL WRITE USEFUL CODE in that space!

I chose Debian because I wanted a stable well documented platform to
write code on, and Debian seemed like a hacker's distro rather than a
breadhead's one. So far I'm quite happy with it. Sometimes it can be a
PITA to set things up, but once it's working it continues to work. I
consider this preferable to the Windoze situation of stuff which is
easy to set up but repeatedly suffers random failures for no
apparent reason.

Macs - in the late 80s I worked for a company that used mostly Macs
with a few PCs. I considered myself fortunate to be programming PCs.
When we started to use the TOPS networking software in a peculiar way
which confused its protection code into thinking we were breaking the
licence, I had to do some hacking on the Mac to get it working again.
This made me even more glad that I was programming PCs.
