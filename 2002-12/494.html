Hi Stephen,

I agree that the installer needs some work, and it's getting it, a beta
installer for unstable was released just the other day.

I've installed a few linux boxes, the first was a laptop with slackware,
and most of the rest have been redhat.

Like you, I have been hearing for some time that debian is the way to go,
so I decided to install it as an alternate boot on my home workstation.
This box has plenty of resources, and a bootable cd. Even so, my install
was quite messy, but I did get an install with broken X, and a heap of
extra gnome stuff I didn't intend to load. I fixed X and tipped out
anything I didn't want and I was away. The system runs like a clock, and
updates are a cinch.

So impressed with that install (result) was I that I built 2 floppy boot
images and installed debian on the laptop over my network after creating
an archive from the install CD's That install went better, I still had to
fix X though. Maybe it's better the second time around, but all I can tell
you is that there is a RedHat distibution on the drive that hasn't been
booted since X came up.

The take home message is that debian can be painful to install, but once
it's up, it's sweet. I guess if people wast a complete ready to run system
off the install, they should try RedHat and co, or perhaps knoppix with
the install to HD script.

Regards,

Michael
