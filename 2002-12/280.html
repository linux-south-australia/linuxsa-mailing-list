Andrew,
I may have misled some. We have the latest fandangled SCSI hot swap &lt;insert
cool buzzword here&gt; raid arrays alread all we're really doing is swapping
mobo and cpus

After a lot of feedback and realistically costing it. We decided to go for
2 x Xeons 2.4 ghz on an Intel SHG2 dual processor board
with 2gb of RAM.

I read a review on comparison of the 2.0 MP (multi) and 2.x DP (dual) and
we decided a decision best left till later as the MP outperformed all by
virtue of the 4 cpus and hyperthreading (also on the DP version) But Cost
etc came into it and paying 3.5k for cpu was too much when u add mobo and
ram etc. So we went down to 2.4ghz.

Considering what we run well on ATM we needed something to ease the bumps
on the heavy load which Im sure will be more than covered with the setup.

&gt;
&gt;I didn't realise that that made a dual-way PIV motherboard. What are
&gt;you looking at specifically in the PIV department?
&gt;

They do apparently for 3.0 ghz and some around for 2.8 non hyperthreaded
ones but supply is thin (no demand I guess) seeing people use Xeons.

&gt;
&gt;I've just bought four genuine Intel rackmount servers. These are only
&gt;IDE (in RAID), but they're pretty quick. Depending on what you're
&gt;looking for in the footprint department, there are quite a number of
&gt;nice options available.
&gt;
We have a FRIDGE (looks like one) server with more fans than (whatever has
lots of fans) they dont like rack mounts for some reason (aesthetics?) or
our system guy (who is close to clueless) may have some fetish for fridges. 

&gt;We purchased:
&gt;
&gt;1 x 1U Chassis (SR1300), 2.0GHz PIII Xeon, SE7500WV2 Server Board,
&gt;    2 120GB 7200RPM cold-swap HDDs, onboard IDE RAID, 1GB RAM
&gt;
&gt;3 x 5U Chassis (SC5200), 2.0GHz PIII Xeon, SE7500WV2 Server Board,
&gt;    2 120GB 7200RPM HDDs, onboard IDE RAID, 1GB RAM
&gt;
&gt;All three are dual-processor capable and will take another 11GB of
&gt;RAM. We bought the IDE versions, but much sexier SCSI versions are
&gt;available, including hot-swap and RAID capabilities.

&gt;The build quality is quite outstanding. I'm really happy with them so
&gt;far, particularly the 1U box; I wish I'd bought more of them instead
&gt;of more of the 5U's.
Setup sounds good how many concurrent users hang odd them?


&gt;I'd say a box based on a similar platform would be more than adequate
&gt;for your SQL Server, particularly if it is currently surviving on
&gt;450MHz PIIs.

It survives and I think it is adequate but the new &lt;nameless&gt; acc package
we got is a dog SQL wise doesn't fully utilise the SQL 7.0 things like
clustered indexes and they have &gt; 1000 tables in a database all terribly
inefficient IMHO. 

&gt;Also, I'd say you'd want to go for something with a SCSI backplane,
&gt;rather than IDE. You get all the groovy hot-swap features, as well as
&gt;a faster I/O platform.
&gt;
SCSI RAID in place :) but we'll probably will need more disk shame scsi is
so expensive.

We'll prol use this new beast for next 3 years then upgrade again - it
seems about the max life expectancy of a well designed server.
