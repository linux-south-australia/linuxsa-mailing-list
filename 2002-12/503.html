Call for Requests - 2003 Funding Program

Funding Requests due 24 January 2003

The IMB Community Foundation is once again calling for community
and
business groups to put forward community projects for funding in
2003. The
Foundation is interested in projects that relate to its objectives
and meet
the funding criteria. The IMB Community Foundation is particularly
keen to
promote partnerships and collaborative efforts in the community.

Criteria for Funding

The IMB Community Foundation will fund projects that meet its
objectives.

Preference will be given to projects which demonstrate a high
degree of
self-help, either in the form of the applicant's own efforts and
work
already undertaken, or in the form of actual physical or financial
resources
committed to the project. The maturity of the applicant
organisation will be
considered in determining the level of support for the project.

The IMB Community Foundation will generally fund projects that:

  a.. Emphasise and achieve the transfer of skills in the
community;
  b.. Create or initiate information, facilities or activities
that would
not otherwise occur;
  c.. Become self-sustaining over time.
Projects must appeal to a broad sector of the community and the
benefits
generated by projects should be available across a number of
sectors of the
community. The IMB Community Foundation may also consider projects
that
address a particular sector of the community to achieve broader
community
benefits.
The IMB Community Foundation will generally fund tax exempt bodies
under the
Income Tax Act, although it may consider funding bodies that do
not meet
this requirement if the benefits of their projects are adequately
established against other criteria.

The IMB Community Foundation will generally not fund:

  a.. Projects that involve advocacy for particular groups or
sections of
the community;
  b.. Sporting activities or programs;
  c.. Capital items such as major equipment or buildings;
  d.. Commercial or profit seeking projects;
  e.. Budget deficits;
  f.. Transport, accommodation and meal expenses;
  g.. Projects from public sector organisations, organisations
with specific
political objectives, organisations that maintain discriminatory
practices
and other Foundations that are grant seeking bodies.



The IMB Community Foundation retains the discretion to fund other
types of
projects as it sees fit.
Objectives

The objectives of the IMB Community Foundation are:

  a.. To encourage and assist the economic diversification and
development
of the various communities in which IMB operates;
  b.. To support social, cultural, environmental, educational,
tourism and
economic initiatives within those communities, which will
ultimately provide
economic benefits;
  c.. To provide those communities with tangible skills, new
physical
resources or new knowledge;
  d.. To identify and support specific activities that provide the
best
opportunity for those communities to be more self-sufficient and
self-supporting;
  e.. To encourage government and other key enterprises operating
within
those communities to plan for the future.



Procedures for Applying

All applicants must submit a Letter of Request to the IMB
Community
Foundation by 5pm Friday 24 January 2003, describing the project
in two
pages or less and addressing the funding criteria.

The IMB Community Foundation Committee will consider all Letters
of Request
and invite selected applicants to lodge formal submissions.

The IMB Board will decide which projects will receive funding.
