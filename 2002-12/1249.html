Hi all,  
could anyone here imagine this discusion being carried out on a Windows list??  
:-)
Sure Linux has a few problems;

1. Not as easy to use straight out of the box..... Time will fix this.

2. Any help needed in using it is not available from the fellow next door (in 
most cases).............. But there IS help available from many knowledgeable 
people, don't know too many very knowledgeable people using Windows,
for most people it doesn't encourage too much interest in the workings of the 
operating system.

3. Probably the biggest hurdle is that it is very difficult for the average 
computer buyer to buy a machine without Windows installed. If a new user was 
to start from scratch using say Mandrake 9 or similar without the habits 
gained from Windows use, the learning curve would be a lot 
smoother.........maybe another senate inquiry would fix this, or the Trade 
practice act.


Could anyone imagine anyone from the Windows camp telling someone that they 
would be willing to burn them as much Windows software as was needed for an 
exchange of a foreign home brew kit.  Last I heard that would probably be 
Illegal, still illegal is only a sick bird.
The willingness this community has in providing assistance to others will 
never be found in a system that has no interested backing.

&gt; Come around to my house - I have home brew beer - 512k ADSL connection -
&gt; unlimited access to the Internode mirror that has the bulk of Linux / OS
&gt; software you could want or need and plenty of updates, etc - and wireless
&gt; Internet / network connection too..
&gt;
&gt; We have room to spare if you need to crash too - no worries at all..
&gt;
&gt; I also have the entire Project Gutenberg (free etexts) and soon an updated
&gt; copy of the human DNA just in case you need something to put on your coffee
&gt; table to impress your friends back home..
&gt;
&gt; And about a tonne of music to send you on your way too - as long as you
&gt; bring some music and beer from your part of the world - home brew kit from
&gt; where you are would be VERY appreciated..
&gt;
&gt; I suggest you either bring a lot of CDs or a VERY big hard drive - you will
&gt; have enough open source software and free literature to keep you going for
&gt; a while..
