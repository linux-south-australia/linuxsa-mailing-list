&gt; &gt; I would gladly use ANY alternative to Telstra for local telephone
&gt; &gt; lines? All I want is a frickin phone line so I can get ADSL on it. I
&gt; &gt; don't even want to make phone calls. Telstra has been a right pain in
&gt; &gt; the arse. My experiences have been as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;usual sorry saga snipped&gt;

the conclusion of my sorry saga was a relatively happy one -- the
technician eventually came around, and spent quite some time finding
the cable box, which was hidden in an extraordinarily non-obvious
place, but then installed everything and wired me up for free
(normally they charge many $ for anything beyond wiring to the box
itself).

&gt; Richard
&gt; 
&gt; As one who has been there, I sympathise ( though my saga is with Mobilenet).
&gt; However, have you talked to Internode? (or whoever you choose as your ADSL
&gt; provider). For one, they will have a vested interest in getting you connected,
&gt; and two, they have channels open to facilitate this. Might be worth considering.

I haven't spoken to Adam about this, no... too late now anyway. I have
a feeling that inserting another intermediary between me and telstra
woudl complicate things further anyway... even if they are intelligent
and well-connected. If the saga continued longer, I might have tried
that though... :)
