Quoted text wrapped incorrectly, text out of sequence.

I reformatted this message so that it was in correct sequence.  Then I
realised that you had not referred to anything I said, probably
because it's too difficult to find the text when it's somewhere
completely different.  So it's gone again.  Still, it gave an example
of text mutilation, so it's not completely wasted.

&gt; My main aim is to let some fresh air in to this very stale debate.
&gt; Windows is fine - as I have said before - I have been using Linux
&gt; since I brought my first 'IBM' type computer about 4 years ago - I
&gt; took all of 1 month to switch to Linux - even before I had a clue
&gt; how Windows works.
&gt;
&gt; My point is - that's my choice.

Not a problem.

&gt; And my MUA rocks

Because it does things like this?

&gt;&gt;&gt; who cares?  Microsoft ripped off Apple, Apple ripped off Xerox and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; circle just goes around and around.  Just a whole bunch of people ripping
&gt;&gt;&gt; off each others user interfaces because the previous group did not market
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt;&gt; sell their ideas properly - either to a community (i.e. - open source) or
&gt;&gt;&gt; commercially.

&gt; because everyone uses it.

"Eat shit, 1,000,000,000 flies can't be wrong"?

&gt; No one uses Mutt - so it's useless to me.

Even if your claim were true (and it's obviously not), why?
