That last sentence sums it all up. Another Debian installer was the Corel
Linux installer, very nice if you like that sort of thing but it died of
bitrot long ago.

&gt; Most people that bash (no pun intended) Debian simply don't open their eyes
&gt; wide enough ;-)

They also might be looking for things that Debian simply can't deliver,
and there's a lot of things in that category.

Here's an example, on a trivial micro level, of a set of problems that
the design of Debian has which the design of the BSDs doesn't.

For some strange reason I once thought I'd look at ping in Woody. So:

 dpkg -S /bin/ping
 netkit-ping: /bin/ping

Then I looked at <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/Bugs">http://www.debian.org/Bugs</A> for the package netkit-ping.
That's odd, there are lot of bugs for such a basic thing. Do a bit of
testing and you can quickly find at least one that is still a problem. Ok,
let's fix it then.

 cd /tmp
 apt-get source netkit-ping

Before poking around in the source too much it would be nice to find out
what the upstream package is. After all, maybe this bug is fixed in the
original. A bit more poking around and guess what, there more-or-less
*isn't* an identifiable upstream. Debian's ping is a patched version of an
orphaned ping written for something else by an unknown person, and it
isn't being maintained. (Which isn't a disaster, because we do have the
source, and it does work mostly as expected, but still it isn't the best
source management strategy.)

So I talked to the netkit-ping maintainer (face to face as it happened)
and it turns out that his plan is to leave netkit-ping as it is now even
with its documented years-old bugs and adopt the OpenBSD ping for the next
release instead.

In contrast, if I am running xBSD, I know exactly what ping it is and
there is one unambiguous copy of the source I can fix. And if I fix an
obvious bug in a BSD ping there is a pretty fair chance that a version of
my fix will find its way into the tree. There are some real advantages to
having a single source tree for the base OS.

Debian takes the point of view that other people are expert in their own
particular area, such as ping or inetd or whois etc and that this work can
be reused, with patches if required and the hope that the patches might
eventually be accepted by the upstream source. BSD believes that the only
way to really be in control is to be the authoritative source (even though
of course the BSDs borrow code freely.)

This story is just one example where people could be looking for things
that Debian can't deliver.
