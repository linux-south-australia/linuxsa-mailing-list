Well written.  I think I quite agree.

Happy New Year.

&gt; I have long observed, and I note that one of my colleagues plagiarised
&gt; me on this, that Windows keeps getting harder the more you use it.
&gt; Unlike unix, most people find that their first experience with Windows
&gt; is painless.  They quickly learn how to point and click and the fact
&gt; that it has a highly consistent user interface makes it easy for them to
&gt; transfer knowledge of one application to another.  Unix shares little of
&gt; these benefits, for example twm is utterly unlike gnome; how better could
&gt; you design confusion for the new user?  However once you move past the
&gt; superficial aspects of Windows and unix you discover that it's actually
&gt; easier to do things in unix than in Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; Windows is very much of the black box mentality, whereby each application
&gt; does what it does and nothing more and you can't see how it does it
&gt; because you don't need to know.  By contrast, unix's tool set mentality
&gt; is entirely different.  Obviously each primitive unix application is
&gt; a black box whereby you don't know how it works, but when it comes to
&gt; actually getting a task done unix permits--even encourages--you to click
&gt; together these primitive applications to create your own bespoke solution
&gt; that solves your own needs.  It is the pipeline, and to a lesser extent
&gt; the scripting languages, that makes unix easier to use than Windows.
&gt; 
&gt; I recently brought a unixphobiac Windowsphile into the fold.  I'd long
&gt; been telling him that unix was the light for server applications while
&gt; admitting that I thought Windows was the best sensible choice for the
&gt; desktop for most users, and he normally responded by saying that he agreed
&gt; in principle but that in practice you could get no unix machine through
&gt; a corporate server-room door, even if you had a seven foot barge pole.
&gt; Last week I loaded RH8.0 on his stinky old Think Pad 600E and it went on
&gt; with only one problem, namely that the audio didn't work out of the box.
&gt; He searched the web and found the solution within a few minutes, and
&gt; so now he has a working Linux machine.  After we had loaded the correct
&gt; modules to make audio work, he said, "I suppose we don't need to reboot,"
&gt; which I almost found funny because it was obvious that cognitively he
&gt; knew we wouldn't, but emotionally he couldn't quite believe it.
&gt; 
&gt; Along the way to solving his audio problem I browsed his system, and he
&gt; was just blown away with how easy it is to do things.  I think he was
&gt; more impressed with /proc than anything else! :-)  He loves the look
&gt; of Gnome and KDE, and is now convinced that we have to collaberate on a
&gt; project using unix for the server and supporting Windows, Mac and unix
&gt; for the client.  I find it interesting that what tipped him to convert
&gt; to the one true light was a mixture of unix's innate superiority, namely
&gt; ease of use, coupled with a Windows-like glitz, namely eye candy.
&gt; 
&gt; Is Linux too much like Windows?  I think in at least one area it is, and
&gt; much to its detriment.  I am annoyed beyond belief at the increasingly
&gt; poor standard of documentation that I see in Linux.  Perhaps it's the
&gt; fault of the distributors and not of the project authors, although
&gt; I cannot really believe that, but the fact is that for decades unix
&gt; had a clear advantage over every other operating system in that it's
&gt; documentation was stored in a single type of repository and it was
&gt; easy to search that repository to answer "how do I" type of questions.
&gt; I'm talking of man pages.  Unfortunately we now have to contend with
&gt; info pages, HTML pages, and I shudder to think what else.  I don't
&gt; dispute that these all provide a nicer user experience is some way or
&gt; other, but they cost us loss of utility.  It's no longer obvious how
&gt; to find documentation, and in many cases documentation is no longer
&gt; being provided.  If the answer is some particular KDE application, just
&gt; what question do you have to ask?  Certainly you can't ask "man -k".
&gt; Neither can you ask "man kview" (or whatever.)  Likewise "kview -?",
&gt; while giving output, actually tells very little.  The result is that
&gt; KDE applications become difficult to integrate into a command pipeline
&gt; because you can't discover that they solve a section of the problem and
&gt; even if you could, you can't discover how to invoke them in a pipeline.
&gt; This growing tendency, which by the way is not directed at KDE in
&gt; specific, approaches the Windows-like black box mentality.
&gt; 
&gt; Microsoft go to much effort to make Windows easy for non-technical users.
&gt; I think that explains much of their black-box mentality.  When they
&gt; say, "you don't need to know how this works," what they really mean is,
&gt; "we don't want you to play with this because you'll break it."  Well of
&gt; course they are right, and the more you coddle your users the less they'll
&gt; truly understand what it is they have and so the less they'll realise
&gt; its true value.  There's a very good reason why RTFM is so often trotted
&gt; out as the answer to most newbie questions, and although this answer
&gt; is often accompanied by a flame, the reason is not because we're bored
&gt; answering the same questions, or that we're annoyed that our time should
&gt; be abused by people who do nothing to find the answer for themselves.
&gt; The very good reason why RTFM is so often trotted out as the answer is
&gt; that when you do RTFM you learn more about the system.  If we just told
&gt; the answer to every newbie-style question then the newbies would remain
&gt; newbies forever, and eventually they'd probably conclude that unix is no
&gt; easier to use than Windows and comes without their favourite applications
&gt; (e.g. Microsoft Office for Windows.)
&gt; 
&gt; I think Linux is in danger of becoming too much like Windows in trying
&gt; to dumb down and glitz up the user experience.  We're trying to convince
&gt; people to switch to unix and we're not primarily arguing our technical
&gt; superiority, rather we're arguing that we're just as pretty, and just as
&gt; feature rich, as Windows.  The user says Quicken and we say GnuCash; or
&gt; they say Office and we say Open Office.  Yes, it is important to point
&gt; out that we have the same breadth of solutions (in fact we probably
&gt; win on that score), but are we pushing good solutions or pretty ones?
&gt; Is Open Office's claim to fame that it is a great word processor?
&gt; Compare it with, say, LaTeX, and I wonder if it doesn't come out poorly.
&gt; It sure is a big program.  It takes for-e-ver to launch!  The all-singing,
&gt; all-dancing applications of Windows are migrating to unix, and that
&gt; might be a good thing but I'm not wholly convinced.
