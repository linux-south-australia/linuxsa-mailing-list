Fair enough. I mean, asking a hardware question isn't unreasonable,
despite suggestions to the contrary. If it's this or car adverts, I
pick this ;-)

&gt; We are looking at upgrading our SQL server duel p2-450 50gb raid etc
&gt; We initially thought dual p4-3ghjz to use the hyperthreading but that
&gt; requires Windows XP and there lies the problem there isnt an XP server
&gt; around it's either win2k or Win .NEt server not release)

I didn't realise that that made a dual-way PIV motherboard. What are
you looking at specifically in the PIV department?

&gt; Anyway someone proposed a dual XEON 2.8 ghz option but I have no knowledge
&gt; about these things and I'm seeking peoples comments about them. We will go
&gt; INTEL but at this point dual p4 board isnt available and supplier is not
&gt; interested because of support and one off order etc. Whereas XEONs seem to
&gt; be the suggested options.

I've just bought four genuine Intel rackmount servers. These are only
IDE (in RAID), but they're pretty quick. Depending on what you're
looking for in the footprint department, there are quite a number of
nice options available.

We purchased:

1 x 1U Chassis (SR1300), 2.0GHz PIII Xeon, SE7500WV2 Server Board,
    2 120GB 7200RPM cold-swap HDDs, onboard IDE RAID, 1GB RAM

3 x 5U Chassis (SC5200), 2.0GHz PIII Xeon, SE7500WV2 Server Board,
    2 120GB 7200RPM HDDs, onboard IDE RAID, 1GB RAM

All three are dual-processor capable and will take another 11GB of
RAM. We bought the IDE versions, but much sexier SCSI versions are
available, including hot-swap and RAID capabilities.

The build quality is quite outstanding. I'm really happy with them so
far, particularly the 1U box; I wish I'd bought more of them instead
of more of the 5U's.

I'd say a box based on a similar platform would be more than adequate
for your SQL Server, particularly if it is currently surviving on
450MHz PIIs.

Also, I'd say you'd want to go for something with a SCSI backplane,
rather than IDE. You get all the groovy hot-swap features, as well as
a faster I/O platform.
