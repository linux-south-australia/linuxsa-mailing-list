I'm really glad I went to Installfest 2002, thanks to all those that got it
together & helped me on the day.  Much appreciated.

Hey, to all the gang that helped put on the Installfest, big thanks, it 
was a great day and I enjoyed it.

Still trying to get down the Lycoris iso but thanks to the tech team 
for trying to get it done for us. Soon as I get all of it we will have 
copies of Lycoris Build 64 available through the CSDN if anybody else 
is looking for it.

To those who took copies of the CD today, thanks for taking the chance, 
hope you enjoy a very interesting distro.

An extra thanks to those who took the time and effort to put on special 
interest talks, and to those who took the time away from their toys to 
be in the audience and participate. I only managed to make it into a 
couple of them and I was impressed with what I saw. I found them to 
enhance the Installfest and make it just that much more an information 
sharing day.

Here's looking forward to the 2003 Installfest!  Count me in!

Cheers,  Ian
