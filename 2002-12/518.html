Thanks Richard,

I just got a not from my brother saying he was going to go with RH (he
says the CDs are readily available there - I'm sure others are too
though). So I'm a bit disappointed that he hasn't gone with a debian based
system (dispite the venomous garbage being spouted by some on this group
about the quality of debian).

Perhaps I could make a general point to no one in particular that if you
want a glossy installer that tells you that `you don't need to know and
you should just shut', up MacOS probably _is_ the right operating system
for you &lt;<A HREF="http://www.motogrrl.com/humor/OS_airline.html&gt">http://www.motogrrl.com/humor/OS_airline.html&gt</A>;, and if you want
_everything_ installed on your machine, including
`security-flaw-x-with-no-particular-benefit_v0.01a', stick with Windows.
&lt;/rant&gt;

&gt; Debian has a lot of I18N and L10N features, and IMHO it's not

&gt; RedHat, you can see what's going on easier, and hence, learn
&gt; quicker... IMHO). If you want a glossy installer, use one of the
&gt; debian-based distros... Or, do a Mike O'Connor, and make a magic CDROM
&gt; that simply installs a pre-setup debian image... Mike, what was that
&gt; tool called that you used to do that?
