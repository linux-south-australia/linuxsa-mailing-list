On the too late issue, Palladium was but one example off of the top of 
my head. But, from the consumer's point of view, too late is a 
subjective point of realization.

I'd say that in about a year, if our company can't run our essential 
applications in Linux, we will probably come to the conclusion that open 
source solutions are not suitable for our business. I don't want that to 
happen.

But despite best efforts, I am going to be forced to go out and buy 
Quickbooks 2003 so we can access our client's data in house. I have gone 
as far as trying out Appgen and and installing Internet Explorer in 
Cross Over Office just so we can use Quickbooks for the Web. We don't 
have a choice, if we want to work with clients efficiently. If a client 
gives us a Quickbooks data file to work on,  only Quickbooks can read 
it, if we have a version of Quickbooks later than theirs.  

It really gets me angry!  

Yes, Appgen can read the Quickbooks data, but Appgen will lump the 
transactions by day, so we can't look at individual transactions when it 
comes down to it. And the data will not convert to QIF format so we can 
get the bloody thing into Gnucash.


Gnucash will work just fine for the accountants on our end, we don't 
have to generate invoices, ect.  But until Gnucash can do what 
Quickbooks can for our clients, our company policy will be to not 
recommend it. Quickbooks does not export QIF files to be imported into 
Gnucash.

The last time Kbooks was worked on was December of 2001.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Too late, for what? Linux can't lose money or go out of business.

&gt;
&gt;Sorry, I've said this before, and I'll say it again - the company
&gt;developing this has a very poor history of writing secure applications,
&gt;and their last effort at secure hardware now has Linux running all
&gt;over it.  Unless they buy in the technology from elsewhere (which
&gt;they have done in the past), Palladium has vapourware/latest-
&gt;marketing-scam written all over it.
