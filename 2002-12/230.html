Hi Guys,
	Thanks for all the tips, I have had my head down working lately and I
am sifting through all the email.
I don't use call waiting I learned that one long ago but a good point to
check up on as this service has changed over the years and is now
included free I believe, these things have a habit of being turned back
on but it was not the case this time, caller waiting was not the cause.
	Thanks to Steve for your suggestions on etc/ppp/peers but this file was
almost empty, at least I am learning where things are kept, I am also
trying to remember what I did with my modem manual, changing some of the
registers might be the go.
I have also discovered that the problem occurs mostly with one
particular ISP namely SeNet, however when connected to Picknowl I hardly
experience a problem, maybe someone has an insight into that one :-)
SeNet have some init strings on their help page as well some other
settings, not sure how up to date these are but when I get some free
time I will play with these and see what happens.

Thanks heaps Guys :-)

&gt; You'd probably know if the dropouts were caused by call waiting.  Call
&gt; waiting introduces a beep on the line when a call is waiting, and this
&gt; causes the modem to hang up.  When you hang up while a call is waiting,
&gt; your line immediately starts to ring, so if your *don't* get a ring
&gt; signal immediately after your modem hangs up it's fairly safe to assume
&gt; the dropout was *not* caused by call waiting.
