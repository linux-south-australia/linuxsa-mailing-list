On the whole the links to the US aren't that bad anymore.

If you have a choice of somewhere not in Australia, I'd choose somewhere on 
the west coast of the USA - eg. California because most bandwidth out of Oz 
goes via the west coast of the USA.  Zurich is most likely the furthest part 
of the Internet from Oz.

If you're not sure, do a "traceroute" and see.

&gt; Hi Brian,
&gt;     As a general rule you should always download from the closest site, the
&gt; theory being that the less hops you do to the server, the less bottlenecks
&gt; you will encounter. Unfortunately this doesn't really work to sites in the
&gt; states unless it is in California (and even then it can be slow), because
&gt; the lines to the US from Australia are some of the most heavily used links
&gt; from Australia to anywhere else. The link to California can be quick if you
&gt; pick your time to download, but once you pass through there to somewhere
&gt; else in the US, you pick up all the US traffic on those links as well,
&gt; slowing the links even more.
&gt; 
&gt;     This means that from Australia going to Europe can often be much faster,
&gt; because even though the distance is longer, the traffic is lower. The major
&gt; reason that the traffic is lower is that most traffic in Asia is going to
&gt; other sites within Asia (or away from your link to Europe), whereas you
&gt; would be skirting around the edges to get to Europe and there is much less
&gt; traffic being picked up from Asia going to Europe. Again if you pick your
&gt; download time, you can get a very quick link.
&gt; 
&gt;     As for the links you list, the US sites are in Wisconsin, Virginia,
&gt; North Carolina, Minnesota and Arizona. All of these sites from Australia are
&gt; on the "other side" of California and so are likely to have very heavily
&gt; traffic. The Czech Republic would be the physically closest, followed by
&gt; Switzerland and Belgium. I don't know what the links are like to Prague, but
&gt; I suspect they may be slightly slower that elsewhere in Europe because it
&gt; was a Communist country not that long ago and so likely to be a little
&gt; archaic in some of its communication systems (maybe not, just pure
&gt; speculation there). Belgium is in the middle of Europe from Australia and
&gt; would suffer from the same problems as with the US with extra traffic, but
&gt; not as bad, and finally Zurich would be the best compromise site as next
&gt; closest to Australia, and also likely to have good communication systems.
&gt; 
&gt;     Of course these ideas would be subject to download times and amounts of
&gt; data being downloaded. A small file probably doesn't make alot of
&gt; difference, but a slow reliable line will always be better than a slightly
&gt; faster line that keeps dropping or timeing out. Personally I would try
&gt; Zurich, and if I had problems, I would try Belgium before I next went for
&gt; Arizona and then Minnesota. Hope this helps.
&gt;     Cheers!
&gt;         Andrew.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you wish to download something from Sourceforge you are presented with
&gt; &gt; these mirrors.  I wonder what is the best option to use here in Australia
&gt; ?
