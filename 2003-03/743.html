&gt; &gt; o Emulation technologies (Wine, VMWare, CrossOver etc)
&gt; 
&gt; VMware / Crossover are probably bad examples (being closed 
&gt; source and all), but is copying something (a runtime 
&gt; environment in the case of
&gt; WINE) really innovation?

IMHO, this reveals the problem at the heart of the question being asked
-- what IS innovation? Is email innovation? It just copies real-world
mail. Is a desktop environment innovation? It just copies a real-world
desktop... Is one click shopping innovaton? It's just like having an
account at a retail store... I can't think of many innovations that
can't be explained away as incremental improvement, copying, or Just
Plain Obvious. However, that strict definition of innovation is not very
useful.

The definition that I would choose to use would depend on what I was
trying to say or discover. Generally, though, an innovation is only
important if it changes the life of the user -- whether that user is a
programmer or a desktop user, doesn't matter. In fact, whether they know
what the technology is, or how it works, doesn't matter. On top of this,
it can only be called innovation if it brings something to the user that
they didn't previously have access to. A port of a program to a new
platform is not innovative, as they had access to that previously (less
conveniently, mind you). A feature-for-feature copy of a program is not
innovative on its own for the same reason. You also need to consider the
scale something needs to be to be considered an innovation. Does it have
to be a whole product, or just a feature within a product?

I would claim that TeX and LaTeX were innovative for the academic and
scientific communities. I would claim that PHP is innovative for the web
development community (it doesn't really affect the end users). Perl is
innovative for the programming, systems admin, and web communities. The
GPL is innovative for programmers and users alike.

gcc is not innovative on its own. It may contain innovations on a
smaller scale though, which give C programmers access to functionality
or features that they wouldn't have otherwise. I would claim that the
Linux Kernel is not innovative, though putting it under the GPL was. I
would claim that the modules mechanism is innovative (though I don't
really know how this differs from (say) Windows device drivers).
