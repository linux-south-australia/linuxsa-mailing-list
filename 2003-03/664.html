Hi,

Windows email programs don't like being stopped 1/2 way through and
neither does Evolution or Kmail in Linux. 

They can do all sorts of things such as downloading all your mail a
second time because it's only after all mail is downloaded is it deleted
from the source.

Lock files are set up so that a second program can't access those files
while they are in use. It's the old scenario of a word processing
document being opened and edited by 2 different computers at the same
time and when it's saved which version is saved as they are now both
different.

Find where Outlook Express saves its email, some of those files might be
read-only, look for the ones called Inbox.* and Outbox.* etc.

I'm not sure if it was the mail server the linux box that had the lock
file.

The comment by Outlook Express that it couldn't open because it was
already running is that it found a lock file which was supposed to be
cleaned up when Outlook Express closes. 'Cause the previous Outlook
Express was killed the lock file remained.

Can someone else comment on that please, where you'd find those lock
files and what could they be called?

Thanks

Robyn

&gt; The log of the mail server was saying "could not get the lock of the 
&gt; file", suggesting that it may have been locked by some one. On trying to 
&gt;     reopen the Outlook express6 on the first computer (where he 
&gt; partially had downloaded and killied the Outlook Express), it cannot be 
&gt; opened  ; an instance of outlook express was still there.
&gt; 
&gt; Only on restarting the first computer, he managed to download mail from 
&gt; the second one.
&gt; 
&gt; It is not the problem of sendmail, but between POP3 and Outlook Express.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it the problem of Outlook express? or POP3 server? or both? or the 
&gt; client's action of stopping it right in the middle? How pop3 handles 
&gt; situation like this?
&gt; 
&gt; Any suggestions, or pointers to relevant documents, are highly appreciated.
