&gt;&gt; [and correct typesetting is out of the ordinary]
&gt;
&gt; Yes. Unless you are in the habit of writing lengthy documents, and
&gt; preparing them for printing yourself, the learning curve is too
&gt; steep - in fact for one job, it's probably better to pay someone
&gt; else to do it. (the typesetting)

And if you are in the habit?

&gt; One of the gotcha's is not the tool being used at all, it's the
&gt; ability of the user to keep the formatting sane. An idiot editor's
&gt; output will be crap regardless of the tools being used. (no grog, I
&gt; am not talking about you!)

There are plenty of ways a program could help promote good
typesetting.  Style sheets, for example.  The problems we're seeing
with OpenOffice, "Word" and Co. is that they don't offer enough help
even for experienced users.

&gt; The other issue is that for a one-off production (like a thesis)
&gt; there isn't neccesarily time or resources to go through the learning
&gt; curve to typeset the text 'properly'. A good approach is to use an
&gt; effective, but not great WP tool - AbiWord is a good example, we did
&gt; it on a Mac with Clarisworks, and make sure to save the final
&gt; version as a pdf for posterity's sake. Regular lengthy document
&gt; authors will need something better.

A better approach is to use an effective and great WP tool.  As you
observer, it doesn't guarantee good results, but it makes things
easier.

&gt; My experiences in this area with Word are not good, once the
&gt; document size gets large, it kills the ability to edit it. We had
&gt; some consultants at work a couple of years ago who managed to
&gt; assemble a 14mb word doc that they couldn't open again!

I think this has more to say about "Word" than it does about the
consultants.  And yes, I've heard similar stories.
