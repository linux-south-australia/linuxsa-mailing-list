&gt; &gt; Hey all,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This isn't designed to be flamebait, but we've all seen in the media
&gt; &gt; claims that Open Source rarely innovates, but typically just copies
&gt; &gt; innovation by others. Whether that's true or not is really irrelevant,
&gt; &gt; but I was hoping that people could pass on some of the areas where they
&gt; &gt; think Open Source software is and has been innovative (preferably stuff
&gt; &gt; that's happened over the last couple of years).
&gt; 
&gt; I believe your colleague at Tellurian, Dan Shearer, has prepared and delivered 
&gt; a presentation on such a topic.  You may like to check with him.

That's true actually, but not in Australia.  You might be thinking of
"Things Open Source can do that Closed Source cannot", which is the
closet I can think of (but not the same.)

I don't find it hard to find lots of open source innovations, but I
haven't found evidence that open source is more innovative. In fact many
would say -- and maybe have, I haven't read all this thread yet -- that
one of the proofs of how good open source is lies in the fact that it
encourages people not to innovate, or re-invent the wheel.

Quickly looking at your list:

&gt; As for innovation, I think the following are good examples:
&gt; o Beowulf (cheap supercomputing power)

  This is innovative in the sense that it was the first real
  massmarket packaging of well-explored ideas. I don't think any of the
  clustering work was new, it was the accessibility. 

&gt; o i18n and accessibility through atk/pango on GNOME

  I think you'll find (in open source) that Qt was there long before
  Pango, and in closed source that other toolkits have been providing
  similar functionality for a long time. The high-level text widgets in
  MFC for example can print any Unicode string as far as I know
  including non-latin orientations and scrolling.

&gt; o kernel performance (Linux and BSD)

  I don't know about QNX vs BSD going back years (gets complicated
  because it is a matter of comparing non-Intel with Intel
  architectures) but certainly QNX outperformed Linux for a long time,
  much of which was due to its very quick microkernel design.

&gt; o Emulation technologies (Wine, VMWare, CrossOver etc)

  I realise that there are no other systems with the range of emulation
  technologies that free OSs have, but does that make them innovative?
