On this topic, what is generally seen as the "best" way to authenticate
users?

I have set up a Samba domain as you all know from recent posts (Regarding
the thread "FW: I just can't do it.")  No decisions have been made about
that yet.

I still need to think about the bigger picture.  What is the best method
for integrating authentication into one central place?  PAM, using what
method?

I will be authenticating the following:

	o  A Red Hat server with clients connecting via Telnet
	o  Clients connecting via SSH
	o  Clients authenticating from Windows workstations via a Samba
	   Domain
	o  VPN through Cisco 827/IPSEC (TBA)
	o  Dial-Up clients

The one big piece of the puzzle which is missing so far is centralized
authentication.  I have a big idea of exactly how this should work, but
what is the solution I'm looking for?

I was reading up on integration with PAM on FreeBSD with Samba, and the
idea behind PAM is to provide a layer between the clients who are
authenticating and the authentication system behind it.

Mostly, I find references to Samba/PAM/MySQL (such as
<A HREF="http://www.isber.ucsb.edu/~randall/personal/samba_mysql_pam.html,">http://www.isber.ucsb.edu/~randall/personal/samba_mysql_pam.html,</A>)
Samba/PAM/LDAP (<A HREF="http://www.unav.es/cti/ldap-smb-howto.html">http://www.unav.es/cti/ldap-smb-howto.html</A>)

I've been taking this project step-by-step.  I've got to know Samba stage
by stage, because I felt that taking it all on at once was probably the
worst angle to come from.  At this point I've managed to create a fully
functional Samba environment, and now I'd like to make it integrate better
into our network.

With LDAP Authentication, I can make better use of directory based services,
but I'd like to know kinds of things I can do (starting at say, a personnel
directory) with LDAP.  I'd love to see some examples.

I think I have got quite the ability to implement this, but I would like to
learn more, but I learn best by example.  LinuxSA meets on the third Tuesday
of every month; the 17th.  I'd like to know what I can attend that would teach
me more about Samba and the things related to it, whether they be at LinuxSA
meetings, Installfests or otherwise.  As you've all known from my previous
mail about my boss's shaky feet, I'd like to get on top of this as best
that I can, but I need to learn, learn, learn!!

Thanks for your insights guys, I should put you all on the payroll ;)
