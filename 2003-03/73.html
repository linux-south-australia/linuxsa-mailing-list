&gt; My question is whether there are in fact some people here

I am.  All of AARNet will run IPv6 natively by mid-year.
We ran a training workshop in Adelaide last year to
prepare the unis and local ISP community for this.

There are notes online
&lt;<A HREF="http://old.www.aarnet.edu.au/rd/advanced-internet-workshops/aiw02-2/presentations/&gt">http://old.www.aarnet.edu.au/rd/advanced-internet-workshops/aiw02-2/presentations/&gt</A>;

&gt; When I tried a couple of years ago to determine how to connect
&gt; up to the 6bone in Adelaide or some such network, I couldn't easily
&gt; work out how to do it.

There's a heap of autoconfiguring 6bone tunnel servers,
probably linked to from the 6bone site.  Use one of those.

&gt; I'd be interested to know if there are people using it in earnest.

The main use is for news feeds.  US academic networks
don't charge for IPv6 (ie: it doesn't contribute to the
calculation of the 95th-percentile of 5 minute average
bandwidth) and newfeeds are a big capacity hog.

&gt; But the IPv6 features don't seem to get compiled in by default.
&gt; I need to do more homework on this.
&gt; But it makes me think that IPv6 is not yet mainstream.

Red Hat version 7.3 and later have IPv6 compiled for
just about everything.  You need to set some /etc/sysconfig/network
variables and reboot.

  NETWORKING_IPV6="yes"
  IPV6FORWARDING="yes"
  IPV6AUTOCONF="yes"

The major piece missing at present are IPv6 root nameservers
(that is, your name resoluion for an IPv6 address needs to
use IPv4).  So you need to run both IPv4 and IPv6 on a box
and can't in practice have an IPv6-only box.  This will change,
as the mobile phone handset vendors are annoyed about this.

Also, if you run a IPv4+IPv6 mail primary mail exchanger,
run a IPv4-only secondary mail exchanger.  Otherwise people
that configure IPv6 but have no IPv6 connectivity won't
be able to send you e-mail (eg: my laptop from a conference
WLAN or commercial ISP).  As e-mail is store-and-forward
this is a tricky configuration error for users to find.
