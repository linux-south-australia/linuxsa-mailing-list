&gt; Hello All
&gt;
&gt; I would like to appeal to the FreeBSD advocates within the Linuxsa
&gt; group.

I deleted this message without reading it, because it didn't have a
subject line.  It wasn't until I saw Dan Shearer's reply that I went
and pulled it out of the waste paper basket.  You might like to take a
look at <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/questions.html">http://www.lemis.com/questions.html</A> for some ideas on how to
make people read your messages.

&gt; I am new to FreeBSD. I have had a small amount of contact with
&gt; redhat Linux when I was going through uni. Currently, I am trying to
&gt; set up a home heterogeneous network, and then use these gained skills
&gt; in my workplace. I have been trying to push FreeBSD on to an old 166
&gt; for a firewall and router, and on a Celeron 1Gb PC, however I've been
&gt; unsuccessful for if it's not one thing it's another. I was wondering
&gt; (& hoping) if there is anyone ( either before a meeting, or at a LAN,
&gt; or an informal group, etc ) that would be willing to physically spend
&gt; some time with me installing FreeBSD 4.7 on my machine?

Well, I see you've already discovered BUGA, which is probably a better
place to ask this kind of question.

&gt; Any experienced takers? Please email me, I'm sure we can work
&gt; something out. I've spent a lot of time on these machines
&gt; already. I've even bought a FreeBSD unleashed book. I'm hoping I can
&gt; be fast tracked by some gurus, and continue on my path.

Here too you'll find the URL above to be of use.  I'd guess that most
people would prefer to help via email rather than on site, though the
latter's possible as well.  The obvious question is: what's wrong?
