&gt; &gt; to me...
&gt; 
&gt; I agree, however the proof is already in the pudding, because we currently
&gt; *do* run a Windows NT domain.  It's only that if I were to put in a FreeBSD
&gt; server, configure it all with UFS2 and then share it out with Samba, *IF*..
&gt; and I mean *if* something were to go wrong and I needed to revert back to
&gt; windows, it would be a major major piece of work to turn that BSD server
&gt; back into a Windows machine with as little interruption to data as
&gt; possible.

ok, maybe you need a different angle on the "issues at hand"

how are you going to back this up? 
 - we use amanda, it does tape changeers, i about to put in a 8 slot LTO or SLTD driver soon
 - cost of backup software for windows server is ... 5K+ per year

how do you get that data to the users fast enough?
 - multiple gigabit netowrk cards, IIRR freebsd supports the intel dual
   "server" gigabit copper or fibre cards

what do the windows client access licences cost now? *per*year*?

my work place is commited to Linux and Freebsd as development platforms.
for reasons that Redhat Linux is the required build/compile server
environments, from embedded development environments.

we get a lot of extra milage out of our servers because we can spend
twice as much on the hardware instead of particular software licences.

for example i am able to spend about 20K on a new mail server,
because it will still cost less than a fifth of the cost of a
slightly lower spec'd MS Exchange server on a Windows Server...
and from that i'll have spare change in the budget to by a 
bigger tape backup server for about 15K!

ok, so you will have to invest the time yourself up front to setup some
of the software the hard way, but you will have more available time
later down the track to implement more *interesting* things =)

someone mentioned earlier about 1/2 a TB of data ... thats a *lot*!
you need to find folks who can give you referneces to info on those kind
of systems ... there have to be folks at Unis that have that kinda
data... i know UQ and QUT have large repos, but im not sure about that
big. i will have three concurrent projects running with 150GB each
shortly, but i will be putting that over three separate servers.
just from a management point of view and "load sharing"

from my experience, if you want fast data on the network, one thumping
big server is not a bad move, but if you want it reliable, you may have
to have a bit more redundancy that that.

maybe you could get some large server "wisdom" from folks at the next LinuxSA/AUUG meet
=)

cheers,

Kim
