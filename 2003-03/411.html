&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "BAN PHON KHAM, Laos (AP) -- Villagers in this remote jungle hamlet
&gt; &gt; have lived for years without electricity or telephones, relying on
&gt; &gt; occasional visitors and a sluggish postal system for news of the
&gt; &gt; outside world. But soon many of its residents will be jumping on
&gt; &gt; stationary bikes to pedal their way onto the Information
&gt; &gt; Superhighway. Custom-built computers -- running on bicycle-powered
&gt; &gt; generators -- will transport villagers from rice fields to chat
&gt; &gt; rooms and Web sites worldwide. They'll be able to monitor rice and
&gt; &gt; vegetable prices, sell handicrafts and e-mail relatives. "
&gt;
&gt; That's a pretty cool idea, but it looks like hard work...
&gt;
Note from the Lao peoples point of view.

&gt; The pic of Tavee Pularmjit pedalling such a generator seems to show
&gt; that it is driven by a fairly small-diameter shaft turned by friction
&gt; from the back tyre. Most of your energy is gonna go in heating the
&gt; tyre up. (Compare how long it takes a bottle dynamo and a hub dynamo
&gt; to bring the wheel to a halt.)
&gt;
&gt; Would it not be much better to unhook the chain from the rear sprocket
&gt; and hook it over a sprocket attached directly to the generator?
&gt;
&gt; Power available: 100W more or less indefinitely, 700W sprint (ie.
&gt; roughly 1hp) (with me pedalling). So a laptop's OK, a desktop more
&gt; awkward and would definitely need a more efficient drive system.
&gt;
Hard work?? Only from the western world point or view, farming rice
by hand in inches of mud and hot, humid conditions is what I'd call
hard work but are part of the Lao Calendar.

Laos is a very isolated country and mountainous country and a lot of
villages do not have power from the national grid (generators only,
possibly only a few hours a day in the evening) or schools. The other
problem is lack of roads, in the more remote provinces (states).

The article states that a customised laptop is being used. Pedalling for
40 minutes for an hour of internet use isn't bad for those with very few
modern amenities.

The whole system must be simple enough to be maintained by the village
and portable enough to be carried on foot. Replacing a bearing can be
trouble.

Question: Why take so long to post a response to Romana's link? or am I
responding to a troll?
