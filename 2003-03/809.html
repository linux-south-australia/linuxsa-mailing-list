&gt; What's innovative about that?  IIRC, Microsoft got a foothold in China
&gt; early on because their software worked in Chinese.

You don't recall correctly according to a very persistant story I heard
at the time, which I cannot verify for myself because I don't read
Chinese. The story goes that Microsoft got a slap in the face from China
around Windows 95 because they employed Taiwanese i18n/l10n people to do
the work, and these people embedded some nationalistic slogans into 
their work.

&gt; There's nothing specially innovative about Wine.  VMWare is not Open
&gt; Source, and I haven't heard of CrossOver.

VMware and CrossOver may illustrate a point that Open Source is an
environment that encourages people to build on in innovative ways. There
are many examples that could be cited. Neither involve any new
approaches or concepts, both make something difficult very accessible.

&gt; Most software is not innovative.  I don't see much innovative
&gt; commercial software either.  Microsoft is innovative, of course: they
&gt; keep coming up with new ways to lock out the competition.

I do see quite a lot of innovative commercial software, but it is more
and more likely these days that it will have been produced with, or run
on, or exist because of Open Source. Google and FAST, for example, Linux
and FreeBSD respectively.
