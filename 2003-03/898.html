Hi.

* Steve Pryde &lt;<A HREF="mailto:steve@prydelinuxsoftware.com">steve@prydelinuxsoftware.com</A>&gt; [2003-03-17 15:23]:
&gt; &gt; &gt; What features that are above and beyond what a word processor should
&gt; &gt; &gt; have and can have, and the optimal ways to present them to the user,
&gt; &gt; &gt; does Open/Star Office 'copy' from  MS Word?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The entire look and feel.
&gt; 
&gt; terribly sorry.  what if this meant that 90% of desktop users could use it 
&gt; without having to learn a new program?
&gt; Keep on using what you use.  It seems to work for you (phew!).
&gt; But understand that most of the public DO make a choice in what they use.  And 
&gt; most people choose Microsoft Office, mainly because either that's what they 
&gt; are used to or because that's what someone they know uses, or even because 
&gt; that's all they know exists - but they still _choose_ to buy it...

Well, they choose to buy an office suite, yes. If you happened to live in a town
that only had a Skoda dealer, and you went into town to buy a car, you would land
up with a Skoda. Maybe you would be happy, but your choices were a red skoda or a
blue skoda (Office SBE, or Office Premium).

That's not choice really. It's a monoculture, and it's boring. We are dealing
with a situation that has been wrought upon the IT using public by one of the
slickest-marketing monopolies to ever exist on the planet. Grog's example tells us
that ther are, and have been alternatives that have been ignored even when they
might have been better, because they weren't owned by 'the company', which 'owned'
the mindset of the people making the decisions. 

Of course, ignorance is bliss. Some people are extremely happy with their Skoda's.
(to be fair to Skoda, modern Skoda's are actually quite good cars, but we haven't
seen any here since the Renault 10 copy-car some years back)

Michael

&gt; Some of the more adventurous ones are now trying out StarOffice 6, because it 
&gt; 'looks and feels' familiar (which you say is a bad thing).
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to say it, but the general public couldn't care less about emacs, much 
&gt; less learn how to use it.  Terribly sorry but that's how it is.  Me included.
&gt; I choose not to use it, because as far as I'm concerned, I dont need it...and 
&gt; never will.
&gt; 
&gt; -Steve.
