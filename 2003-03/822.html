&gt; &gt; &gt; dont agree.  MS Word crashes quite a lot for me (well it used to -
&gt; &gt; &gt; havent used word xp but some friends of mine who know how to use
&gt; &gt; &gt; word and not much else, say that word xp is no better in this
&gt; &gt; &gt; department).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've had more crashes with OpenOffice.
&gt;
&gt; yep openoffice sucks, it's a pity really but there you go.
&gt; I think the project goals/aims were all wrong from the
&gt; start anyway (with just copying M$), but again, there you go.
&gt;

OpenOffice seems very stable to me, but I guess other's mileage does vary, as 
with MS Office also.  If there is anyone else on this list that believes 
OpenOffice is a more stable alternative to MS Office, please let us know. ;-)

OpenOffice looks/works like MS Office because that's what people are used to.  
If it was different, people would view it as 'hard to use' and it would never 
have been as popular as what it is today.  I didn't like StarOffice 5.2 for 
that reason....it was too different from what i was used to and therefore was 
perceived to be 'harder to use'.

Its the same problem i mentioned before.  If OpenOffice lacked a feature that 
word has, you would say 'see? openoffice isnt as good because it doesnt do 
this'.  Now that OpenOffice has 90% of the functionality/features as word, 
all you can say is 'they just copied MS'.

I dont know of any features I need that aren't in MS Word or OpenOffice.  
There is therefore no reason whatsoever to do anything differently.
If you think it SHOULD be different to MS Office, please state HOW it should 
be different, rather than just criticizing.

As long as the 2 are very similar, then OpenOffice will be viewed as an 
'alternative' to MS Word, which is what they want.  But lets also not forget 
that OpenOffice wasn't created to be some 'MS Office' viewer.  It has its own 
file formats and as a word processor, spreadsheet, or whatever, it works very 
well without the need for anything MS at all.

&gt; Instead I use crossover office with M$ word and excel

Here is the flaw in your argument.  You first said that OpenOffice's problem 
is that its a copy of MS Office.  Now you are saying you would prefer MS 
Office - which would immediately indicate that OpenOffice isnt a good enough 
'replacement'....ie. that it *isnt enough like MS Office*?

to use a hypothetical example, this is like someone saying they dont like car 
A because it is too much like car B, yet they are happy to drive car B.

I think that since MS Office has proven itself to be very useful, it is 
therefore a perfect basis for OpenOffice to work from.  The aim is to provide 
a high-quality office suite for solaris, linux, and an alternative to MS 
Office on windows.  You would have to be ignorant to say that this has not 
been accomplished at least to some degree.

I personally wish the OpenOffice / StarOffice projects all the best in future 
in offering a choice to consumers worldwide, and providing some much-needed 
competition for MS.
