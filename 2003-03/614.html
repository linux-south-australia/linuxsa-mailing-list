&gt; Part of the reason the LinuxSA list and community is so vibrant is
&gt; because we don't limit discussion on the list to purely technical
&gt; matters, nor are we overtly upset by humour.

Or lack of it....

&gt; 
&gt; Forums (such as IRC) where the censorship of humour happens every so
&gt; often are silent, dull and boring. 

That depends entirely on which irc channels you hang out in. On EFNET
(one of the busiest groups of irc servers) there are many linux help
channels which have large numbers of people coming or going or simply
lurking, and humour plays an important role in the health of the channel
conversation. Humour to the detriment of channel participants however,
is strongly discouraged. As is racist, sexist, and other socially
inappropriate comments that are just as unacceptable in real life as
they are on irc. See www.irchelp.org for some docs on irc ettiquette.

The #linuxsa channel where some find it amusing to denigrate others by
abusing a priviledge is an exception. In the 7 years I've been on EFNET
such behaviour would automatically result in a kickban from the channel.
Repeat offenders would recieve a permban. In #linuxsa however no such
sanctions are ever enforced, and so the behaviour could be construed as
having tacit approval.

Similarly flame wars on this mailing list are not moderated at all, but
if they continue for too long, over too trivial a matter, they
eventually get complaints from other list members.

&gt; Besides which, I'm reasonably certain
&gt; I haven't seen other people helping out at InstallFest, Conference
&gt; Organisations or such...

Your point is....?

I help out literally hundreds of people on a daily basis with their
linux problems on EFNET's #linuxhelp and #redhat, and I'm reasonably
certain I haven't seen you in those forums either! Just because you are
active locally, doesn't grant you any more rights than others who may
prefer anonymity over ego gratification. Does it? Or do you feel that
your local contributions grants you authority over, and to speak for,
the masses?

Besides which I was told point blank by yourself my help was neither
wanted NOR required. So am I to be blamed for taking you at your word?
Or was that another example of "humour"? Can you please make at least
some attempt at making it obvious when something is a joke?

&gt; 
&gt; *hmmm*
&gt; 
&gt; DSL

Hmmmm?
