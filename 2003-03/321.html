&gt;may i ask how ppl back up a TB of data?  sure you can build a box that holds
&gt;a TB of data, but back it up every night like i would have thought is
&gt;expected??  that's the problem we have, not about disc space, but the cost
&gt;of buying new tape drives all the time.
&gt;
&gt;yeah i've heard all the wind about mirroring it to another machine etc etc,
&gt;but a fire doesn't care about a mirrored server.  :)  just a thought.
&gt;

Have a look at rsync to mirror to a second box. If you're just comparing 
regular files and documents etc, not that much is going to change in a 
day, and you can probably back up that much data over whatever links you 
have [1] available to a remote location if you do the initial 
synchronisation over ethernet [2] first.

[1] If you have enough staff to create 1TB worth of regular files, 
presumably you have plenty of bandwidth somewhere for them to do other 
stuff during the day.
[2] At 100Mbits/s, 1TB will take approximately 1 day to copy, you might 
want to consider that in your disaster recovery plans!
