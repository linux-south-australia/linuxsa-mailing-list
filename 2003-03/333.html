&gt; I'm curious as to how you're defining a 'large deployment'. I have a 
&gt; sendmail box and a qmail box each with a large number (&lt; 20,000) mail 
&gt; accounts, and virus+spam filtering nearly cripples a 1.6Ghz system with 
&gt; the kind of volume required by that many users. It would seem that the 
&gt; answer is a 'toaster' style system with multiple front ends for SMTP, 
&gt; but sendmail's mbox has a history of being less than ideal over NFS.

The issue with mbox files on NFS is simply one of making sure
that every thing that touches the mbox agrees on the mailbox
locking mechanism.  That used to be really hard to do.  Nowdays
there's only two processes involved -- the MTA's local delivery
program and the IMAP mail store server -- so it's much easier.

Also, sendmail will write to Maildir files if you use maildrop
or procmail as the local delivery agent.  As RHL uses procmail
you can write Maildir files using out-of-the-box sendmail
in that distribution.

The Maildir/mbox files do have differing I/O profiles, so
you can pick that best one.

&gt; I'd also be interested to hear how 'ideal' setups from a year ago are 
&gt; handling the current volumes of spam. I'm seeing more than twice the 
&gt; volume of bounced messages in the queue than the stats showed for 12 
&gt; months ago.

Spam checking isn't a huge hit, at least through sendmail's
milter interface, as there's no disk I/O involved and current
CPUs are ridiculously fast.

Virus checking is a massive I/O hit.  Someone needs to take
a cluestick to the virus scanner authors -- we're not interested
in checking files anymore so much as MIME streams.  There's
no reason for the Aho-Corasick state machine at the heart
of the virus scanner to do disk I/O and there's no reason
for the MIME detangling and file decompression to do file
I/O either.

My personal hope is that the free software virus scanners
will build up a decent signature libarary so that it's worth
someone's while to write a virus scanner specifically designed
for MIME streams.

&gt; Is having to fiddle with the source really a large issue by comparison 
&gt; to the other problems to solve in a mail system handling thousands of 
&gt; users?

There's a difference between fiddling and merging a number
of large patch sets (and this requiring an understanding
of any recent API changes in Cyrus SASL and OpenLDAP).

It can be done, but means that you're getting less bang for
your sysadmin dollar.
