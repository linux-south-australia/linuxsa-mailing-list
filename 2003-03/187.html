&gt; Mirroring and Red Hat.  Feel the pain....  We poll the mirror

Glen,

At 02:20 (UTC+1030) on Wed 5 March 2003, sendmail 8.12.8 is not yet
available at <A HREF="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sendmail/">http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sendmail/</A>
although I grabbed it from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz</A>
at 15:43 (UTC+1030), Tue 4 March.
That's not a complaint, of course. Just a comment to lead me into
this little ramble....


I've had it with sendmail!!
That's the last straw!!!
Sendmail is wearing out my exclamation key!!!!

Anyway....
That security scare on sendmail yesterday sounded so urgent,
I immediately downloaded the latest sendmail and tried to install
it on top of my SuSE 7.1 installation.
Unfortunately, every sendmail configuration is differently wierd.
And sendmail has changed a fair bit (not backwards compatibly) since 8.11.x.
(Now you've got to create a user+group smmsp, and fiddle with all
the file owners/permissions, and move the alias files and config files,
and the readme files form a small network in themselves!)

After about 5 hours of trying to figure out the new "features" of
sendmail, I just gave up and downloaded postfix instead.

Result: bliss!
Postfix is easier to get going for a complete postfix beginner than
sendmail is for someone who's been using it since the 1980s.
Not only that, postfix has all the features I've been wanting for
many years:
-	separate access lists (to block spam) for
	-	the SMTP client
	-	the SMTP To-address (before aliasing)
	-	the STMP Form-address
	-	the mail header
	-	the mail body
	(sendmail only offers the first 3 in a combined db, I think)
-	human-readable config files instead of sendmail.cf gobbledygook
-	comprehensible documentation

Question:
Can anyone tell me if I'm going to miss out on anything by changing
over the postfix?
If my perception is right, then there's no need for sendmail to 
hang around any more. It should go the museum of 1980s memorabilia.
If there's ever a software museum of the 20th century, one of the
hands-on exhibits could be a unix computer with sendmail.
The task - to modify the sendmail.cf file to achieve a specified objective.
Smelling salts and counselling should be available, of course.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. My cris du coeur during my failed sendmail 8.12.8 install/config
attempt are summarised here:
