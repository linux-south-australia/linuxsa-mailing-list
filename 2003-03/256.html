" In a spat at LinuxWorld last month, Sun and Dell bared their
 collective teeth, as Dell Chief Information Officer (CIO)
 Randy Mott opened his keynote with the declaration "Unix is
 Dead".

 The irony of the remark was not lost on Sun Microsystems'
 Jonathan Schwartz, who noted that Dell ran its supply chain
 on Sun-based systems. In a tit-for-tat reply, Mott said that
 Dell was in the process of migrating away from Sun machines.

 Mott's point was, however, serious. He argued that
 innovation was needed when investing firms' IT resources;
 "maintenance of the status quo", he said, led to
 obsolescence. 85% of a company's resources should be devoted
 to development and innovation, Mott said. He also stated
 Dell was on track to achieve this goal, with a 25:75 status
 quo:innovation split.

 Oddly enough, Dell is moving to Red Hat Linux and Oracle,
 hosted on its own servers. Odd because, last time we looked,
 Linux was a *nix. Mott's key point, however, is that while
 Linux is open-source, Unix isn't."
