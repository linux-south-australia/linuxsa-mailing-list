<H1>Monitors: a week on</H1>

<PRE>
Last week I asked about monitor repairs and got a large number of
replies.  As I mentioned, I took it to the Adelaide Monitor Center in
Henley Beach Road.  Sadly, they were unable to repair it (and despite
investing a lot of work, didn't charge me anything).  The monitor is
an iiyama VisionMaster 21, now about 6 years old.  It was quite cheap
at the time, and the specs were good.  The down side shows itself now:
it's cheap to assemble, almost impossible to repair.  The adjustments
are between two circuit boards which can't be separated when running.
It looks like it's a goner.

So: what should I replace it with?  LCD panels still have too low a
resolution to be interesting.  I find that I can get the following
monitors relatively easily.  They're all 21" (i.e. 20" visible),
though some claim to be 22".

Model		Dot pitch		Horizontal freq.	price 

Benq P211	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,080
NEC FP1355	  0.24"			121 kHz			$1,300
Mitsubishi 2115E  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,200
Mitsubishi 2060u  0.25"			121 kHz			$1,500
Samsung 1100P+	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,300
Philips 201B	  0.25" 		107 kHz			$1,060
Philips 202B	  0.24" 		130 kHz			$1,660
Sony CPDG520      0.24"			?			$1,900
Hitachi CM 823F	  0.25"			121 kHz			$1,550

On the face of it, there's not much to choose between any of them
except the Sony, which is too expensive for my liking.  The only of
these manufacturers I've had experience with is Hitachi (with whom I'm
quite happy; I have two 813 monitors with 115 kHz scan).  On the face
of it, Benq or maybe Mitsubish look like being the best bet.  Does
anybody have experience with any of these monitors?
