&gt; P.S. So I guess the best way to secure wireless network is via
&gt; specific MAC address lists in the AP's ???

Depends what you're using the wireless network. As someone else said in
the thread, MAC addresses can be changed in software, so all you need to
do is sniff the airwaves to find out what MAC addresses are allowed on
the network.

I'm looking at setting up a point-to-point wireless link to a friend's
place (mainly for the learning experience, but also to play games, etc)
and the way we've decided to do it is run two APs in bridged mode and
plug them directly via a crossover cable into a Linux/BSD machine. We've
worked out a cost of approx $300 per end, including a directional
antenna and AP.

We will run some private range on wireless link that is totally
different to what we're using (eg 10.255.255.0/24) and then run an IPsec
tunnel between the linux/bsd boxes for the actual traffic. For us WEP
isn't going to add anything and it slows the link down. So what if
someone connects to the AP, they won't be able to do anything except
ping our firewalls :)

Anyway, what I've described above would even work if you're not bridging
two networks but are actually using it as a wireless network. The AP
connects directly to a firewall machine and uses a network address
you're not going to use/route (important to NOT route that network) and
then use IPsec tunnels or PTPP tunnels on the clients.

Cheers
Darryl
