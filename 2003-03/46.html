David,

That's almost a complete howto.
It sounds like it's a bit more complex than I had even been expecting though.
All in all, it sounds like the way to go is to first get IPv6 all
going locally within the home LAN, and then try to get connectivity to the net.
(My home lan is less interesting than yours - I have 10 machines which
are IP-capable, and I only keep 6 of them running because it's just
too much admin to patch all the vulnerabilities every time they're announced.)

My ssh log messages already say something like this:

Mar  2 16:11:33 dog sshd[26799]: Accepted publickey for abcdefgh from ::ffff:203.38.xyz.52 port 36318 ssh2

This kind of message (with some fields modified for obscurity) already
suggests that there's a fair amount of my linux software already
itching to get going with IPv6.

In some contract work I'm doing at the moment, I'm supposed to get some
software working for IPv6 over cellular mobile (like 3G stuff basically).
I know from past experience that if I see some new technology in the
research papers for a year, then in specialist newsgroups, then in
mainstream IT industry articles for a year, and so forth, that some day
soon it's going to be bundled with kiddies' computers at Xmas; so I'd better
work out how it works if I don't want to get too far behind the times.

Anyway.... so it looks like the best strategy is:

1.	Get it going on the home LAN.
2.	Get it going to/from the real internet.

But when I get to stage 2, I'd still like to know what are the choices
for getting connected.
If I want native IPv6 on my PPP link, I guess I've got to discuss
that with my ISP.
But for IPv6 over IPv4 connectivity in Adelaide, what are the current 
options and how much do they cost?
I last asked this question on Sunday 13 March 2001.
Hmmm. Someone else asked a similar question on 30 May 2001.
(It seems like they didn't get an answer.)

I imagine that anyone who provides IPv6 connectivity is going to want money.
And to be efficient, the connection point should be in the same city.
Intriguingly, I found this:
<A HREF="http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/SEHS.html">http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/SEHS.html</A>
That some sort of gobbledygook information about IPv6 at my old high school!
Now I know for sure that I'm behind the times already.
I found that here:
<A HREF="http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/bycountry.html">http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/bycountry.html</A>#AU
But that still doesn't tell me who to contact in Adelaide for connectivity.

Is there a list of publically available (commercial or not) IPv6
access points in Adelaide?

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
