&gt; I'd be more than interested in any local developments people have done

&gt; a lot of the nitty gritty stuff like distro used their war stories etc.

Well, my encounters are as follows:

I have a small network of various pieces of hardware at home. So far, 
I've got most of it on IPv6 (but also dual-stacked on IPv4).

OS/Distros are as follows:

OpenBSD 3.2 i386
Windows 2000 SP3
SuSE Linux 7.2 and 8.1
MacOS X 10.2.3 (and now 10.2.4)

Things not on my IPv6 net just yet:

Solaris 8 x86
Cisco 2503 access router. (I suspect it doesn't have enough flash/RAM 
to handle an IP6 aware IOS).
Mac IIci running NetBSD 1.6
A couple of other PCs not currently running ;)

What I did:

I started out just enabling IPv6 in the kernel on the SuSE 7.2 machine 
(as I'd compiled a new kernel a while back minus IPv6 support).

The Mac OS X box already supported IPv6, as did the OpenBSD machine.

I downloaded the Win2k tech preview for IPv6 and installed it. (I later 
downloaded a modified version for SP3 which works better).

Initially I just played around with link addresses seeing if I could 
ping6 another machine on the wire.

Bolstered by my initial successes, I implemented Site addressing using 
the fed0::/16 block and subnetting that into three /64 networks. (as I 
have three distinct networks at home, routed by the central Linux box 
with 3 interfaces in it).

I configured radvd on the central linux machine to advertise the three 
subnets I'd chosen. All the IP6 aware hosts assigned themselves 
addresses in the relevant subnets as per the router advertisements.

I configured AAAA records (and PTR records) in my DNS (a SuSE supplied 
bind 8 that has been patched by SuSE for IPv6), for the Site addresses 
using a separate domain.

I then modified inetd.conf for a couple of services to use "tcp6" as 
the protocol rather than "tcp". I also modified /etc/nsswitch.conf to 
use "files dns6"  instead of "files dns" for the "hosts" and "networks" 
fields.

Tests showed I could ssh, telnet, ping6 between subnets and to my main 
linux machine.
ssh needed to be recompiled to support IPv6 both on the linux machine 
and MacOS X (but not on OpenBSD).

However, Site addressing is not meant to be routed on the 6bone (like 
private addressing in IPv4).

So my next step was to get me some real world addresses. I chose the 
tunnel broker: www.freenet6.net  and got a /48 subnet routed over my 
6to4 tunnel.

Then it was just a matter of modifying radvd.conf, adding a couple of 
zones on my name server and a "default" route on the linux machine 
(2000::/3 -&gt; openbsd box (which is the tunnel terminator).

I'm now looking at converting to Bind9 so I can have a DNS server 
listening on my IPv6 addresses (bind8 doesn't seem to).
