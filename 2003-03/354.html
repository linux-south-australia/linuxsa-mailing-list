&gt; Lots of people complain about Realtek.  I have a number of them

&gt; to get it going again.  One of the problems appears to be the lack of
&gt; reliable docco.

Wierd.  I've used these cards before in Linux boxes without problems, 
but sometimes with problems - thought it may have been a BIOS setting, 
but nothing I did seemed to help.  Replacing one card's easy enough; 
replacing three cards in a client's server isn't as easy (cost wise).

The reason there's three cards is because there's three segments of the 
network; the ADSL (through Internode), the wired network, and the 
wireless network.  Wierd thing is that the cards seemed to work 
perfectly under 2.2, but I loathe ipchains (and 2.4's a hell of a lot 
better anyway).

What do people recommend for cheapish (i.e. &lt; $50ea), reliable cards 
that are suitable for use in a Linux server that won't have loads of 
traffic going through it?  I try to use Intel cards where possible, but 
they're not exactly cheap, especially when I'll need three NIC's.  
Recommendations on where I could pick one up cheaply/quickly would be 
great too, as I'll need to grab the cards first thing Monday morning.

In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of
people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
