Glen,


Just to give you comfort I won't mention the name of a person who
deleted the main "Packages" file in our "apt database". Not a major
drama I hear you say? Simply use apt-ftparchive to get it back...except
there's about 10 absolutely random packages that we just delete (because
they cause us grief and we really should just delete them but that's
another story) and the only way to find out which ones were to rebuild
and reinstall our distribution, each of which takes a minimum of an hour
to do...

Or better yet, build a Debian package that has more than [some arbitrary
number] of conffiles. It totally fsck's up your /var/lib/dpkg/status
file and apt (and dpkg) both complain: "Corrupt status file." The fix
for this shenanigans is delete the conffile entries in the status
file...not so hard. Until you forget what mode in "vi" you happen to be
in and delete 5000 lines instead of 500 and then :wq without thinking...

A few days ago I was running Sarge at work and it decided [yes, it
decided] that it was no longer going to build Gnome applications. One
minute it did. Next minute it didn't. Not a major drama until you remove
the Gnome2 apt-sources, start to download and install Gnome 1.4, realise
that it's not Gnome at all but it's the stupid autoconf/automake
packages and then land in a state where you get the stupid circular
dependency problem [it's difficult to get in Debian but it can be got].
The solution? Pick something and just force install it...

The moral of the story: "apt" and "the Debian packaging" system are
great, wonderful and stable. Well, most of the time. If it weren't for
users...
