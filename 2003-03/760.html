&gt; &gt; As for innovation, I think the following are good examples:
&gt; &gt; o Beowulf (cheap supercomputing power)
&gt; 
&gt; Supercomputing isn't an innovation.  What's special about Beowulf?

what was nice about it, in say 1994, was for 10K you could put more CPU
grunt on a resaerchers desk at uni(where i worked) then could be
supplied any other way. ok so it was kinda the begining of pvm and mpi
on linux but a hooj leap forward in the way parrallel computing
researchers though, i suppose Sun and the "the network is the computer"
came a few years before, but folks realised actual use of the concept.
hell our first beowolf cluster was based on C/CGI on apache IIRR...
then pvm, so .. that was a hooj step forward =)
 
&gt; &gt; o i18n and accessibility through atk/pango on GNOME
&gt; 
&gt; What's innovative about that?  IIRC, Microsoft got a foothold in China
&gt; early on because their software worked in Chinese.

as did apple and the macintosh several years before them ...

&gt; &gt; o kernel performance (Linux and BSD)
&gt; 
&gt; That's evolution, not innovation.

true the kernel is a building block, but these have enabled lots of
other things to follow ...
 
&gt; &gt; o Emulation technologies (Wine, VMWare, CrossOver etc)
&gt; 
&gt; There's nothing specially innovative about Wine.  VMWare is not Open
&gt; Source, and I haven't heard of CrossOver.

crossover is a browser plugin thingy is it not?

&gt; &gt; o Network Storage Devices (commodity hardware)
&gt; 
&gt; There's nothing specifically Open Source about them.

&gt; &gt; o Jabber (service delivery, not just IM)
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know this.

instant messaging+ 
 
&gt; &gt; ...there's a lot really.  Just hard to think on the spot :)
&gt; 
&gt; We've seen some other examples.
&gt; 
&gt; Most software is not innovative.  I don't see much innovative
&gt; commercial software either.  Microsoft is innovative, of course: they
&gt; keep coming up with new ways to lock out the competition.

bigger companies have fallen, now if only the DOJ was not a political
puppet =( remember the late 70's and IBM ...

cheers,

Kim
