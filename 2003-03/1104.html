&gt;I have a basic wireless network here, and it's started slowing down

&gt;changed -- I still have a wall between the nodes, and reception is still
&gt;not great. There are no new electrical devices nearby (though one
&gt;network dropout coincided with a workers' walkie talkie being used).
&gt;Nothing has been moved, and I am certain I haven't changed any settings
&gt;(no, really)...
&gt;
&gt;Where should I start looking to fix this? It's driving me slightly
&gt;insane...

When you say performance has suffered, is it intermittent or consistent? 
Devices like cordless phones, leaky microwave ovens and garage door 
openers are not likely to remain on constantly. If you believe that the 
culprit that is causing interference is constantly on, it's more likely 
to be a video/audio sender of some kind, or possibly another access point.

Have you tried using a different channel for the wireless kit? I havn't 
had a lot of experience with 802.11 etc, but if someone locked down 
their AP to only use certain mac-addresses for pseudo-security, then it 
probably can't autodetect for you - maybe you can put your wireless 
interface into a promiscuous mode and see what's floating around.
