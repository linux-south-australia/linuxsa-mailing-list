&gt; Last week I asked about monitor repairs and got a large number of
&gt; replies.  As I mentioned, I took it to the Adelaide Monitor Center in
&gt; Henley Beach Road.  Sadly, they were unable to repair it (and despite
&gt; investing a lot of work, didn't charge me anything).  The monitor is
&gt; an iiyama VisionMaster 21, now about 6 years old.  It was quite cheap
&gt; at the time, and the specs were good.  The down side shows itself now:
&gt; it's cheap to assemble, almost impossible to repair.  The adjustments
&gt; are between two circuit boards which can't be separated when running.
&gt; It looks like it's a goner.
&gt; 
&gt; So: what should I replace it with?  LCD panels still have too low a
&gt; resolution to be interesting.  I find that I can get the following
&gt; monitors relatively easily.  They're all 21" (i.e. 20" visible),
&gt; though some claim to be 22".
&gt; 
&gt; Model		Dot pitch		Horizontal freq.	price 
&gt; 
&gt; Benq P211	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,080
&gt; NEC FP1355	  0.24"			121 kHz			$1,300
&gt; Mitsubishi 2115E  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,200
&gt; Mitsubishi 2060u  0.25"			121 kHz			$1,500
&gt; Samsung 1100P+	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,300
&gt; Philips 201B	  0.25" 		107 kHz			$1,060
&gt; Philips 202B	  0.24" 		130 kHz			$1,660
&gt; Sony CPDG520      0.24"			?			$1,900
&gt; Hitachi CM 823F	  0.25"			121 kHz			$1,550
&gt; 
&gt; On the face of it, there's not much to choose between any of them
&gt; except the Sony, which is too expensive for my liking.  The only of
&gt; these manufacturers I've had experience with is Hitachi (with whom I'm
&gt; quite happy; I have two 813 monitors with 115 kHz scan).  On the face
&gt; of it, Benq or maybe Mitsubish look like being the best bet.  Does
&gt; anybody have experience with any of these monitors?

Having done warranty repairs on Samsung monitors, I'll say: don't get
the Samsung. The joke in the workshop was that Samsung is Korean for
"disposable". Personally, I'd go Philips or NEC.
