&gt; &gt; What features that are above and beyond what a word processor should
&gt; &gt; have and can have, and the optimal ways to present them to the user,
&gt; &gt; does Open/Star Office 'copy' from  MS Word?
&gt;
&gt; The entire look and feel.

terribly sorry.  what if this meant that 90% of desktop users could use it 
without having to learn a new program?
Keep on using what you use.  It seems to work for you (phew!).
But understand that most of the public DO make a choice in what they use.  And 
most people choose Microsoft Office, mainly because either that's what they 
are used to or because that's what someone they know uses, or even because 
that's all they know exists - but they still _choose_ to buy it...
Some of the more adventurous ones are now trying out StarOffice 6, because it 
'looks and feels' familiar (which you say is a bad thing).

I hate to say it, but the general public couldn't care less about emacs, much 
less learn how to use it.  Terribly sorry but that's how it is.  Me included.
I choose not to use it, because as far as I'm concerned, I dont need it...and 
never will.

-Steve.
