&gt;&gt; I agree that KDE does have features that some people seem to want.
&gt;&gt; Thing is, copying another desktop environment isn't exactly

&gt;
&gt; this is true.
&gt; Sorry if i've been unclear... ;-)
&gt;
&gt; My point is this:
&gt; The parts of kde / the linux gui in general, that have been directly 
&gt; copied,
&gt; are not innovative, except in some cases where something has been first
&gt; copied, but then improved upon.

Absolutely, but almost all things in KDE are blatant copies :)  It 
isn't a completely bad thing, as it does encourage more people to use 
Linux, and makes the desktop experience all that much nicer.  
Personally, I'll stay away, but I've got nothing against it.

&gt; However, not ALL parts of the linux gui have been copied and in my 
&gt; opinion
&gt; there is plenty of innovation in many small ways in the linux gui.  
&gt; See my
&gt; brief list way back at the beginning of this thread for a few 
&gt; examples. :-)

Sure, you did mention plenty of innovative things that "KDE did", but 
as someone else pointed out in another mail, a hell of a lot of these 
were already in X long before KDE was even thought of.

&gt; Even if it wasnt innovative, I'd still use it.  Innovation is not 
&gt; really a
&gt; necessity in my books.  I use it mainly because for me it works well 
&gt; and
&gt; works better than windows. :-)

Well, sure, innovation isn't everything, there's absolutely no reason 
why features shouldn't be there that people want - just that a lot of 
the points you're making aren't completely relevant to *this* thread.  
Definitely worth mentioning, though.
