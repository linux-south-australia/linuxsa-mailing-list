&gt; Hi folks,
&gt;  
&gt; I'm after any advice on setting up a wireless network for the teachers 
&gt; who will be getting new laptops soon, about 19 of them.
&gt;  
&gt; We need to network the staff room, easy plug an AP into the 3Com switch 
&gt; there. Also the Library on the other side of the school, ditto to adding 
&gt; an AP off the Library.

Remember to put the APs into their own VLAN/subnet.  The subnet
should be shared between the two APs, but not with any
wired ports.  This is to minimise the amount of broadcast
traffic hiting the WLAN whilst allowing a PC to hear
both APs without needing to change IP address.

I'd strongly recommend external antennas whomever's AP
you get.  This goes a long way to eliminating dead spots.
You don't need to buy the antennas from the AP provider.

Ask about crypto upgrade paths.  When the WEP mess is sorted
out you don't want to have to buy new AP hardware.  This applies
to the laptops as well.

You also need a access control and authentication strategy.
That will depend on the abilities of the client OSs and
the AP.  Try to get an AP that will do 802.1X, even
if that is in a future firmware upgrade.
