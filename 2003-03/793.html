Glen,

I think that's completely correct. The whole point has been
to unlock advances in software so that everyone can have it,
not just the people with lots of money.
And the other point of open source is that programmer creativity should
not be used to re-create the same solutions thousands of times
over, once for each proprietary company that wants to sell software.
So the point of open source is to stop the waste of programmer talent
that used to occur with the "trade secret" software approach.

That said, it's surprising that so little real innovation has
come out of the OSS world.
The main examples I can think of are:

-	TeX: perhaps the first serious piece of open source software,
	which showed the way for others.
-	X Window System: given away as source on tapes from the beginning,
	and the first generally available network-transparent windowing
	system as far as I know.
-	Perl

But these go back into ancient history.

Were these OSS innovations? (I really don't know.)

-	e-mail, SMTP
-	SNMP
-	IRC
-	HTTP/HTML
-	PHP
-	Python

CHeers,
Alan Kennington.
