&gt; Interesting... but allow me to play the devil's advocate here. ;)

that's ok ;) ;)


&gt; Does it compress the responses for storage on disk (or in memory) to 
&gt; save space? If so, isn't that a bit redundant given the browser will 
&gt; also cache content on that same machine?

no... jigg doesn't do any cacheing of data to disk. it's basically a
"wrapper". it wraps around squid (or any web cache program). it
compresses the HTTP responses to a web browser (given the type of
content it has), and any text/html responses it sees, it
will gather up the "src img" links (objects), and then do GET <A HREF="http://...">http://...</A>
HTTP/1.1 request on those links to force the web cache to go get them
(before the web browser has had time to do this).


&gt; Or does it compress responses to save bandwidth? If so, why bother 
&gt; when you'll typically be sending the content over a 10/100Mb LAN?

you're right... but it was designed for our dialup users in mind.
our wireless clients will get no speed difference ;). if
we only had our wireless customers (we run a multi cell wireless
network in darwin), i wouldn't bother ;).

our dialin base is quite large.

besides, it was a fun project. kept me off the streets when
i was bored at work with nothing to do ;). stopped me getting
up to mischief ;) LOL.


&gt; &gt; and when it sees a
&gt; &gt; TEXT/HTML response, it will look for any IMG SRC links and tell them
web
&gt; &gt; cache to go get them (this is called "looking ahead")...
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds like a generalised version of Mozilla's pre-fetching.

but when this feature is being executed on the far end of a 33-40 kbps
dial up connection, this kind of look ahead feature will have small
effect. the look ahead in jigg's case is done on the same machine as the
web proxy (on a fast network). given it's location, it will always be
doing things ahead of the slow web browser on the other end of the
dialup connection.


&gt; How does this interact with HTTP 1.1's keep-alive and pipelining 
&gt; features?

how does jigg interact with HTTP 1.1 keep-alive ?.

the same way as squid does. jigg will hold up connections if squid 
tells it too (if the response header doesn't have a "Connection: close"
or "Proxy-Connection: close" directive).

&gt; Eg, if a page has been partially loaded by the browser and it 
&gt; has started to request objects embedded in the page (e.g., images), 
&gt; using the same keep-alived'ed connection that the HTML came down, and,
&gt; say, using pipelining to request the additional objects before the
HTML 
&gt; has even been completely transferred. Does jigg deal with this kind of
&gt; situation properly?

yes. each time the web browser opens up a TCP connection to jigg
it creates a new thread to handle the request/response. and it will
do request/responses until a response comes down telling it to
"Connection: close" or "Proxy-Connection: close".

a connection will not be closed by jigg unless the web browser
closes the connection, or if it expects a normal termination (with
the above directives).

if the web browser "fans outs" by openning multiple connections
to jigg, then jigg doesn't care. it just treats each connection
as a request/response.
