&gt;&gt;From my understanding, wep is still a good choice. Tools 
&gt;&gt;like the BSD 
&gt;&gt;Airtools WepCrack and air snort, still take a large amount of data to 
&gt;&gt;crack keys without 21bit weak iv's. I just think all the hype 
&gt;&gt;about how 
&gt;&gt;insecure wep is getting is out of hand. Rolling wep keys do a 
&gt;&gt;great job 
&gt;&gt;of solving the problems. Sure there is still problems but lets not 
&gt;&gt;instantly discount a security measure. If you want security 
&gt;&gt;use IPSec, 
&gt;&gt;but don't discount a first line of defence.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I guess you read my last post. I would suggest the same that WEP is a feature and it has a use.  I would think that anyone who has the responsibility for assuring the security of a network would take steps to build on WEP (perhaps VPN, etc) and not assume its going to prevent someone from seeing your network traffic.
&gt;
&gt;In many ways, its the way it's implemented in an environment more so then the technology its self. For example, changing the key by some means on a regular basis (there is no standard way to do this as far as i know) is a good start.
&gt;  
&gt;
There is support for key changing in the 802.1x authentication protocol 
standard. Getting this into the unixes however could be a little harder.

Cheers,
    Benjamin
