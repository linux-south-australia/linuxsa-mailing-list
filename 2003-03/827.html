&gt; I think we're looking at things from different perspectives.
&gt; Innovation and copying are two different issues, and I personally
&gt; would rather see good tools coming out than copies of bad ones.
&gt;

&gt; &gt; I dont know of any features I need that aren't in MS Word or
&gt; &gt; OpenOffice.  There is therefore no reason whatsoever to do anything
&gt; &gt; differently.
&gt;
&gt; Because *you* don't know of any others?
&gt;

sorry, the focus here was on _my_ needs.  Others may have needs which 
OpenOffice / Word dont fulfil.  Obviously you are one such person.

&gt; &gt; If you think it SHOULD be different to MS Office, please state HOW
&gt; &gt; it should be different, rather than just criticizing.
&gt;
&gt; I don't have time for all of them, but here are a few:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  It ignores directory structures, just like Microsoft.  It doesn't
&gt;     seem to understand the concept of a cwd at all.  If I create a new
&gt;     document, it will always try to save it in my home directory.

is there really a concept of cwd in the linux gui?  This is an innocent 
question...not trying to push a point here.  What I mean is that I could be 
working on a word doc and typing an email at the same time.  if i went to add 
an attachment to the email, should that start at the directory the word doc 
was in?  if i select an attachment from a different dir, should openoffice go 
to this new dir when you select 'save as' ?  My StarOffice 6 (as you've said, 
and i agree, openoffice should be no different) always points to the last 
directory used _within StarOffice_.  For example, when i click 'open' it goes 
to the last place i opened a doc from previously.  When I click 'save as' it 
will go to the directory i opened the _current_ doc from.  That is exactly 
how I want it.  Not sure if that is what you meant though :-)

&gt; 2.  It doesn't have an editor.

I thought that's what it was...unless you mean 'code editor' or something like 
that.  Well it wasn't designed to be a programmer's tool nor was it designed 
to replace tools like Tex etc.  They have a different focus and its like 
comparing apples with oranges.  Maybe OpenOffice should have 'plugins' or 
something so that this functionally could be possible....dunno - that's just 
a suggestion.

&gt; 3.  Its text formatting is extremely primitive.

its built to be a word processor, for typing up reports, letters, even web 
pages...and as such it is quite good.  Not sure what you're exactly after 
here.

&gt; 4.  The user interface is slow and difficult to use.
&gt;

Havent had that problem.  Maybe my PC is fast enough that i dont notice...
I dont find it difficult.  But that all depends on the individual and what 
you're used to.

&gt; I use OpenOffice for exactly one thing: compatibility with Microsoft.

??  why?  if you dont like the word compatibility in openoffice (or lack of) 
then use word.  though the cursing and swearing would probably increase :-)

&gt; You can tell when I'm using it from the cursing and swearing.  Even
&gt; something as simple as entering non-ISO characters, such as em-rules
&gt; or curved quotation marks used in normal printed text, is a pain.
&gt; Putting in a Greek sentence into an English text is possible, but it
&gt; takes about 30 seconds of mouse pushing for each character.

These requirements seem slightly heavier than those of the average OpenOffice 
user.  You might find (you already have found) that other software is better 
suited to this task.

&gt; I wish people would do some thinking about really innovative
&gt; alternatives.

You obviously have confidence in your unix ability....why not create an 
alternative program yourself?  Its very easy to criticize, but much more 
difficult to do a better job yourself.

-Steve.
