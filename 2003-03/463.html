Glen,

Just replying to the original question, this
kind of issue used to come up a lot when I was programming
a 68k to do Bresenham's line algorithm, which you probably
know uses a couple of integer comparisons to simulate
floating point comparisons to keep a graphics line as close
as possible to a straight line.
I used a fairly sophisticated technique to improve the
the standard algorithm by a factor of 2.6 in the critical loop.
But this expanded about 6 lines of assembly language out to
about 250 lines.
(A guy in England - where I was then working - had just finished
a PhD on graphics optimization, and he showed me the first page of his
thesis where he had stated _the_ optimal implementation of 
Bresenham's line algorithm. He had breathing difficulties when
I showed him 4 or 5 optimization tricks which he hadn't yet used.
He told me I was "mad". Anyway, I just state this to give you some
idea of my previous fanaticism for optimisation.)

The first trick in my bag of tricks for optimizing conditional code
where the control parameter changes rarely but is inside a loop
is to, of course, have two loops and choose which loop to enter 
rather than choosing actions within the loop.

if (collecting_counters) {
	while (...) {
		/* lots of stuff */
		counter1++;
		counter2++;
		/* lots more stuff */
		}
	}
else {
        while (...) {
                /* lots of stuff */
                /* lots more stuff */
                }
        }

This approach _may_ be faster.
But the costs are:
-	difficult to maintain because code is duplicated
-	may actually go slower because of program text cache interactions

This approach can be extended into a huge code tree with a different copy of
the inner loop for each set of control variable values.

It seems to me like the linux kernel is the most difficult place to
do any optimization at all.
You have unknown processors, unknown compilers, unknown optimization levels,
unknown cache sizes and architectures, unknown numbers of CPUs etc.
How could anyone predict the run-speed impact of any change in kernel code?
Your comment about it being political sounds right.

My main point was, in fact, that the variability in runtime provides such a
huge level of background noise that you just can't detect improvements from
code optimization by doing speed tests. Although I still do try to optimize,
I (almost) never waste time doing speed tests.

In my readings of those parts of the kernel which should be written
to go like the clappers, I've been astonished at the huge amount of
useless guff and sloppy unoptimized code. Especially in network device drivers
(e.g. ethernet, ATM), but also further up in the IP stack, I've seen code that
looks as leisurely as applications software. It's only the "modern CPU" which
saves the linux IP data paths from code bloat.

By the way, the last trick in by bag of tricks for loop optimization was
to recompile the assembly language code of the inner loop
before each entry into the loop. If the loop runs often enough, it's
beneficial to recompile before entering the loop - but you have to
count cycles. And then you have to test each time whether it's beneficial
to do the optimization.
(It was at this point in my explanation that the Computer Engineering PhD
from [old] York told me I was "mad".)

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
