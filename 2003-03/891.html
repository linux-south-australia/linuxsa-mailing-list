&gt; [and correct typesetting is out of the ordinary]

Yes. Unless you are in the habit of writing lengthy documents, and preparing them
for printing yourself, the learning curve is too steep - in fact for one job, it's
probably better to pay someone else to do it. (the typesetting)

One of the gotcha's is not the tool being used at all, it's the ability of the
user to keep the formatting sane. An idiot editor's output will be crap regardless
of the tools being used. (no grog, I am not talking about you!)

The other issue is that for a one-off production (like a thesis) there isn't
neccesarily time or resources to go through the learning curve to typeset the text
'properly'. A good approach is to use an effective, but not great WP tool -
AbiWord is a good example, we did it on a Mac with Clarisworks, and make sure to
save the final version as a pdf for posterity's sake. Regular lengthy document
authors will need something better.

My experiences in this area with Word are not good, once the document size gets
large, it kills the ability to edit it. We had some consultants at work a couple
of years ago who managed to assemble a 14mb word doc that they couldn't open
again!
