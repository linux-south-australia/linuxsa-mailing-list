&gt;&gt; Troff was based on roff, which was based on a program of the

&gt; OK, but why "run off"?

I don't know.  I assume it was for the same reason that people say,
"run off a copy on the printer"


&gt; OK, ye people who are familiar with both *roff and [La]TeX, why did
&gt; Knuth write TeX if troff existed?

Knuth was writing the definitive text to computing.  He wrote volumes 1
and 2; and despairing of the poor quality of document setting applications
at the time, took a decade off to write TeX, before writing volumes 3, 4
and 5.  I don't know why he didn't use troff, but recalling the previous
mini-discussion about TeX's operating system of origin, particularly
that it wasn't unix, perhaps he didn't know of it or felt it was not
conveniently available to him.  Seems a bit of a stretch, I'll grant you.
Maybe he just didn't like troff's cryptic and arcane language and decided
to write his own cryptic and arcane typesetting language.  :-)


&gt; Are they pretty much equivalent?

Yes, in the same sense that an Alfa and a VW are pretty much equivalent.
Actually, the two motor cars are probably more equivalent than the two
typesetting systems.
