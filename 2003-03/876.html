Hi All,

Is there a config option in Sendmail to change/strip the header of a mail
message as it passes through a sendmail system?

Eg: A standard RedHat V7.3 running a firewalled dial-up modem link to the
Internet and is allocated a dynamic IP address each connection. No mail is
delivered to this host from the Internet side, the users inside the network
access a couple of POP3 accounts on the ISP. The outgoing mail from hosts
inside the network is sent to the firewall host for delivery to the
Internet. They dont have direct SMTP access to the Internet.

The network behind this host uses private address space (192.168.1.x) and
NAT.
When a host inside the network sends an email, the private address is added
to the header of the email.

If the email is destined to a BigPond address, it is rejected with this
message...

&gt; The original message was received at Mon, 17 Mar 2003 09:16:08 +1030 from
host1 [192.168.1.97]
&gt;   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:xxxxxxxxx@bigpond.net.au">xxxxxxxxx@bigpond.net.au</A>&gt;
&gt;    (reason: 500 access denied; your IP is listed by
rbl-plus.mail-abuse.org.)

As you can see, the internal network address range is being used by the
bigpond MTA to reject the message, even though it wasnt sent from that IP
address, it came from a valid IP address belonging to the ISP.

Can sendmail be configured to strip off the internal IP address range and
make the email appear to come from the IP address allocated by the ISP to
the dial-up link. ?
I dont think I have much hope of getting BigPond to change their config to
let it through..

Cheers,
Darryl
