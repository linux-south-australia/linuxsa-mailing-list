&gt; &gt; This is typically true of user interfaces; typically desktop 
&gt; &gt; environments, some moreso then others (*COUGH*KDE*COUGH).
&gt; 
&gt; Just copying the look'n'feel of Windows isn't innovation IMHO :-)

i have been following englightenment since DR0.9 which is about 6-7
years. englightenment and imlib have been two of the most innovitive
pieces of software in the desktop areana. most of the features you see
in XP were done first in enlightenment, then other X window managers
then windows ...

transperant window borders, non-rectagular windows, shading, texture
mapping etc the list is endless =) ok, so some of these features were in
games, but enlightenment and imlib probably did it first onthe
desktop... anyone remember renderman and whats'isname who went to work
at redhat/mandrake?

lots of firewalling and filter research has been done on linux, as it
has a lot less restricitve licencing for Universities etc ...
the first gigabit switches outside cisco and ibm were at unis on linux
boxes ... development of the 64bit pci bus was pushed along by these
guys =) the networking in the 2.4 linux kernel has been heavily pushed
by unis looking for inexpensive phd projects =) (in europe)

it might not be called innovative, but lots of projects under linux and
*bsd have been out there to implemnt the complete APIs for various
standards, to push the commerial world into using the standard APIs
properly ... well they tried =)

linux and to some extent *bsd has pushed the research world closer to
realisation of grid computing especially at places like CERN who
implmented a 5000CPU computation farm on redhat etc ..

anyhow ...

cheers,

Kim
