&gt; I've had pretty extensive experience implementing/developing using

&gt; 
&gt; That samba mysql howto may work, but there's a much, much better way of 
&gt; doing it.  I need to write up the howto/documentation for the guy who 
&gt; wrote a dedicated samba mysql module, just keep running out of time :(

I forgot to mention a couple of things in my last e-mail :-)

The less pieces in the puzzle, the better. If you have one service
talking to another service, talking to another service, which reads some
crud from a database and all of these services are on different
machines, whenever any of these services fails or any of the hosts
fails, nothing works.

This is why I like to implement LDAP. I will usually have an LDAP
service running on most/all of the hosts I'm dealing with. I will then
set one up as the master and have it replicate to all of the others over
LDAPS (LDAP with SSL). This provides more tolerance to fault, as you can
have each machine configured to try a different LDAP server if the one
on localhost fails, and it helps to keep network traffic and login
latency down to a minimum.

The databases used to store the contents of LDAP directories are
typically read optimised databases that perform very, very well with
large amounts of data when reading and perform badly when writing. Most
SQL RDBMS systems are not optmised this way to the same extent and try
to find a happy medium. MySQL is probably the best RDBS for the job, but
I still think that an LDAP-based solution might outperform it. Flat text
files are just evil.

Incidentally, I also have a policy of never storing root and other
system accounts in anything other than the standard text files on that
system. This is for (hopefully) obvious reasons.

I hope it helps,
Matt
