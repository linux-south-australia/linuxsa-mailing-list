&gt;&gt;It would seem that the
&gt;&gt;answer is a 'toaster' style system with multiple front ends for SMTP,
&gt;&gt;but sendmail's mbox has a history of being less than ideal over NFS.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;What's the NFS component for?  Couldn't the front end SMTP systems
&gt;(the virus checkers) just deliver to the backend stores over SMTP/QMTP?
&gt;  
&gt;

They could, but then the POP3 and IMAP servers would need to be running 
on the backend stores as well, increasing complexity and reducing some 
of the 'modularityness' and inherent scalability of the toaster 
approach. Using NFS means that the client access and authentication can 
occur on a different system, and not interfere with mail delivery. It 
also means that you can take advantage of NAS equipment to store mail 
(some of which have nifty snapshot backup routines, RAID systems and 
methods of expanding volumes without downtime, all with the promise of 
lower maintenance requirements than traditional servers). I also like 
the idea of checking things like mail quotas and forwarding rules on the 
edge systems and leaving the mail store to do storage only.

&gt;I must admit, I think Milter is great.  It's a shame it's not a
&gt;defacto/dejure
&gt;standard for other MTAs, although I'm not sure how easy it would be
&gt;to integrate into qmail's modularityness (take that, Funken Wagnall).
&gt;  
&gt;
I don't think it's that hard, but it is non-standard. There are popular 
patches for qmail-queue to pipe all received mail through an arbitrary 
program, or you can just rename it and run your own program named 
qmail-queue that delivers messages to the renamed qmail-queue-original.
