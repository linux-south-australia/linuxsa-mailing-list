&gt; &gt;&gt; [and correct typesetting is out of the ordinary]
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes. Unless you are in the habit of writing lengthy documents, and
&gt; &gt; preparing them for printing yourself, the learning curve is too
&gt; &gt; steep - in fact for one job, it's probably better to pay someone
&gt; &gt; else to do it. (the typesetting)
&gt; 
&gt; And if you are in the habit?

Depends on your needs. I guess there are choices to be made in 2 areas:

  How will you become proficient at document design?
    ie. So you know what design you need to achieve to suit the job.

  What tools will you use to make that design a reality.

Of course, if you are 'in the habit', you will have made these choices already...
:)

If the documents are one-off's, I would suggest a good page layout program from
the likes of Adobe. As you have already pointed out, this could become tedious if
it was a book such as yours where new editions are quite likely - in that case
perhaps framemaker or something like what you are doing. You are comfortable with
groff etc, (and that is fine), but I can't see a non-technical person taking to it
in quite the same way.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; One of the gotcha's is not the tool being used at all, it's the
&gt; &gt; ability of the user to keep the formatting sane. An idiot editor's
&gt; &gt; output will be crap regardless of the tools being used. (no grog, I
&gt; &gt; am not talking about you!)
&gt; 
&gt; There are plenty of ways a program could help promote good
&gt; typesetting.  Style sheets, for example.  The problems we're seeing
&gt; with OpenOffice, "Word" and Co. is that they don't offer enough help
&gt; even for experienced users.

Hmm. Not sure I agree with that. If I was experienced, I'd want the editor to 'get
out of the way' so that I could format my document with the least amount of
hassle. Inexperienced users tend to pick an existing template and work from there
- perhaps by the time they have some experience they have created a pretty good
library of templates to suit their style. Generally, the WP's don't get into the
same degree of control of typesetting the text as a 'proper' page layout system. 

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; The other issue is that for a one-off production (like a thesis)
&gt; &gt; there isn't neccesarily time or resources to go through the learning
&gt; &gt; curve to typeset the text 'properly'. A good approach is to use an
&gt; &gt; effective, but not great WP tool - AbiWord is a good example, we did
&gt; &gt; it on a Mac with Clarisworks, and make sure to save the final
&gt; &gt; version as a pdf for posterity's sake. Regular lengthy document
&gt; &gt; authors will need something better.
&gt; 
&gt; A better approach is to use an effective and great WP tool.  As you
&gt; observer, it doesn't guarantee good results, but it makes things
&gt; easier.

Ok. I didn't know there were any, which is why I suggested using something that
doesn't market itself as 'Great', just 'Competent'.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; My experiences in this area with Word are not good, once the
&gt; &gt; document size gets large, it kills the ability to edit it. We had
&gt; &gt; some consultants at work a couple of years ago who managed to
&gt; &gt; assemble a 14mb word doc that they couldn't open again!
&gt; 
&gt; I think this has more to say about "Word" than it does about the
&gt; consultants.  And yes, I've heard similar stories.

Sure, except they chose the tool, not us, and then failed to work within it's
limitations... They both lose either way :)
