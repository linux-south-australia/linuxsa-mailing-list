&gt; That's true.  

Not really - we have over 1TB on one Linux machine that serves it's data 
through another Linux machine running samba by using NFS (us *nix users 
just NFS mount it *g*).

We do have a lot of data, and at the moment it's spread
&gt; across Windows servers in a kind of gross way, and I didn't want to get in
&gt; over my head with Windows and start setting up a distributed file system --
&gt; I wanted to run BSD and do things the right way :)
&gt; 
Ya know, it was ridiculously easy to build this 1TB machine...

We made use of a PIII 450 that was lying around, put it in a huge case 
with a bunch of hot swap bays and a RocketRaid IDE raid card (make sure 
you use the driver from highpoint instead of relying on the OS).  We used 
software RAID 5 and started dumping data to it.  It was empty 5 months ago 
and now it is full!  So, we built another one, just over 1TB actual 
capacity and by using symlinks, users don't know the difference *g*.  Very 
sweet.

It's just sooooooo easy in *nix generally to do pretty much anything that 
you want to do... I'm not sure if this helps you at all.  Our entire 
infrastructure is basically Solaris/BSD/Linux and our users are extremely 
demanding (all engineers).  Wanna come to Sydney?
