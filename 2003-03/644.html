&gt; This e-mail's quite long and hopefully some use. I've tried to address
&gt; the first question and most of the rest in the first chunk and I'll try
&gt; to address the bits I've missed as I get to them.

Big long useful ones are the best :-)

&gt; &gt; On this topic, what is generally seen as the "best" way to authenticate
&gt; &gt; users?
 
&gt; My recommendation for a Windows system would be to make use of it's own
&gt; native protocols. Many applications make an assumption that this will be
&gt; the case and it will save you much grief later.

When you say a "Windows system," are you talking about a purely Windows
environment?  If so I couldn't agree more.

&gt; For Linux and other PAM-enabled systems, I'd go with whatever you like
&gt; :-). LDAP is quite popular and a personal favourite of mine and has
&gt; other advantages which I'll try to cover a little further down this
&gt; page.

I think LDAP offers the most functionality across the board.  I think LDAP
takes quite a bit of getting used to, however, if you've never set it up
before.

&gt; &gt; 	o  Clients authenticating from Windows workstations via a Samba
&gt; &gt; 	   Domain
&gt; 
&gt; When using the 'encrypt passwords = no' option in smb.conf, Samba can
&gt; (if compiled to do so) authenticate using PAM. If you have the 'encrypt
&gt; passwords' option set to yes, you cannot.

Encrypt passwords is set to yes.  I think with Windows XP it is a
requirement for Samba to have "encrypt passwords" set to yes.  Is this a
complication when authenticating with PAM, if so, how so, and what do you
do about it?

&gt; &gt; 	o  Dial-Up clients
&gt; 
&gt; This one kinda depends on what the modems are plugged into. If it's some
&gt; kind of RADIUS speaking device, it can use RADIUS :-).

They're currently connected to a NT RAS server on serial ports, and they're
just modems, but I'd like to move them to FreeBSD eventually.  I assume
that if I configure that NT server to authenticate against the Samba
domain, which authenticates to LDAP through PAM, those current RAS users
can still authenticate against NT, through PAM to LDAP, right? :)  ...
without any additional configurations.

&gt;   * Authenticate the users of UNIX services using PAM, where possible.

I agree.

&gt;   * Have PAM configured to authenticate the users based on information
&gt; 	stored in an LDAP directory (doesn't have to be on UNIX
&gt;  	machines)

LDAP to me is the most difficult part at this time.  It's one of the
reasons I never bothered with it when I began this project, because I
didn't want to tackle too much at once.  It seems like something reasonably
complicated.

&gt;   * Turn on password encryption on the Samba PDC

(as above) how does this integrate with PAM?

&gt;   * Have Samba compiled and configured to store it's authentication in
&gt; 	the same LDAP directory

Oh -- so Samba authenticates outside of PAM, directly into LDAP, whereas
everything else authenticates through PAM into LDAP?

&gt;   * Configure Samba to update unix passwords (unix passwd sync smb.conf 
&gt; 	option) in the LDAP directory when Samba password changes

Well that answers that, it must, or that wouldn't work.  If I turn on "unix
password sync," is that all I need to do once Samba is compiled with
--enable-ldap (or whatever it is?)

&gt;   * Let users change their passwords using the Windows control panel

Is there any functionality for strong passwording or forced password
changes every n days, because as far as I know, PAM can do this.  Can Samba
do it when querying LDAP directly, or do I still have to wait for Samba
3.x?

&gt;   * Use Directory Administrator or some custom tool for your own
&gt; 	management purposes.

Directory Administrator?  An LDAP tool?

&gt;   * The dialup lines can use one or more of the above methods or you can
&gt; 	set up FreeRADIUS on one of the UNIX machines and tell it to use
&gt; 	PAM and therefore the LDAP directory.

That was the option I was considering for these users.


Thanks for your input so far :)
