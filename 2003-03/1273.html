Does this mean I'll have to switch off my LG internet fridge?

&gt;  As many of you know, each year the Internet must be shut
&gt;  down for 24 hours in order to allow us to clean it. The
&gt;  cleaning process, which eliminates dead email and inactive
&gt;  ftp, www and gopher sites, allows for a better working and
&gt;  faster Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;  This year, the cleaning process will take place from 12:01 a.m.
&gt;  GMT on April 1st until 12:01 a.m, GMT on April 2nd.
&gt;  During that 24-hour period, five powerful Internet search
&gt;  engines situated around the world will search the Internet
&gt;  and delete any data that they find.
&gt; 
&gt;  In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask
&gt;  that you do the following:
&gt; 
&gt;  1. Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from
&gt;  their Internet connections.
&gt; 
&gt;  2. Shut down all Internet servers, or disconnect them from
&gt;  the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;  3. Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any connections
&gt;  to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt;  4. Refrain from connecting any computer to the Internet in
&gt;  any way.
&gt; 
&gt;  We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some
&gt;  Internet users, and we apologize. However, we are certain
&gt;  that any inconveniences will be more than made up for by the
&gt;  increased speed and efficiency of the Internet, once it has
&gt;  been cleared of electronic flotsam and jetsam.
&gt; 
&gt;  We thank you for your cooperation.

&gt; event so they too will be prepared.
