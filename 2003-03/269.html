So can you put it on Windows and make it a fileserver only, then use 
Unix for processing? Windows is quite capable at serving files, so you 
just want to have a Unix environment for handling data as part of your 
sysadmin duties.

It's amusing to make jokes at Windows' expense, but you have to stop 
thinking about operating systems and start thinking about money if you 
want to make any headway in an argument based on business 
considerations.

David has pointed out duplication of effort. Technically, he's right... 
but another perspective would be that it protects you against any 
attacks that don't disable Unix and Windows at the same time.
