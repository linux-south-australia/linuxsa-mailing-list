&gt; Hi all, slight problem.
&gt;
&gt; My manager and I have been working to implement a Samba environment to

&gt; Until I received this "Back-out" email this morning.  You can see my
&gt; rebuttle.  I seriously do not want to lose this project, because I don't
&gt; want to shrivel up and die as an NT Admin for the rest of my life.
&gt;
&gt; It's extremely long winded.  I wanted to *PROVE* everything I could.
&gt; Before I send this off, can I please get some feedback, corrections,

OK, here goes.  I haven't trimmed the text, in the expectation that
others might like to add to the comments.

&gt;&gt; Adam,
&gt;&gt; After much thought I realised I approved the usage of FreeBSD for you and no
&gt;&gt; other reason.

Do you understand what he's trying to say here?  I don't.

&gt;&gt; We have been, are, and probably always will be a Microsoft house.

That's a very short-term view.  It also doesn't explain why.

&gt; This is all very sudden.  While we may be a 'Microsoft house,' I don't
&gt; believe that's necessarily relevant when it comes to our network
&gt; Administration. 

I think it's possibly worth mentioning that it's only worth being a
Microsoft house as long as it makes sense.  Your challenge is to let
him see that it doesn't make sense in this particular case.

&gt; I had still wanted to get to know it, and that's why I teamed up
&gt; with one of my friends to help me Fasttrack into getting to know it.
&gt; Ever since doing that, I've seen how powerful it actually is.
&gt; Everything Microsoft has released, Unix has either released prior,
&gt; or has a technology that is equally as powerful.  Microsoft often
&gt; copies Unix technology, and Unix often copies Microsoft technology.

You're treading on thin ice here.  Samba implements a Microsoft
protocol, one which doesn't exist under UNIX.  I don't think this is
important.  Consider that your manager may not want to read the
message, so make it as short as possible while retaining the important
points.

&gt; Were you aware that the original TCP/IP stack in Microsoft Windows
&gt; NT was written by Berkley Software Distribution, a company who are
&gt; now better known for releasing their Open Source product, FreeBSD.
&gt; It wasn't until Microsoft realized they were violating the BSD
&gt; License by closing their source code, that they rewrote the TCP/IP
&gt; code in-house.

As I've said elsewhere, this is incorrect.  I also don't think it will
interest him.  You can point out that BSD was the original
implementation platform for the Internet Protocols, and thus infer
that it's the most reliable.

&gt; Unix has been around for 30 years.  It was never developed for the
&gt; desktop until the last few years, and it was certainly never pushed
&gt; like Microsoft have with their products.  In terms of age, Unix is
&gt; superior to Microsoft.

In terms of age, an abacus is superior to either.  Again, not
something that I'd use as an argument.

&gt; Now that I have come to get to know FreeBSD better, I am much more
&gt; comfortable using it.  I even now write scripts to help me automate
&gt; my work, and I know how to begin troubleshooting problems as they
&gt; arise.  When I can't answer a question, I use the LinuxSA mailing
&gt; list, or the advice of those around me.

Make more of the "around you".  It's one of his concerns that such
people don't exist.  Also explain how the scripts make things so much
easier than under "Windows".

&gt; Even now, I use X running Gnome2 on FreeBSD as my workstation.  I
&gt; only ever boot back into Windows when I absolutely *have* to.

Fine, but not relevant.

&gt;&gt; It doesn't make sense when we have all these expertise in-house to
&gt;&gt; move away from what we know and love.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know about 'love.' :)  In the time that I've moved further towards
&gt; Unix and away from Windows, I've learned just how much easier the
&gt; environment is to work with.  Unix is a complicated place,

Go easy on "complicated".

&gt; and you have to have more than blonde hair to use it.  Unix is a
&gt; powerhouse.  It's full of tools that Bill Gates never even thought
&gt; of.  Once I started using FreeBSD and learning more and more about
&gt; the contents of that /bin directory, I began to start realizing
&gt; exactly what I would be able to do with it.
&gt;
&gt; The software development team is used to using Windows, and granted they
&gt; develop using it, however this is not relevant when it comes to
&gt; administering the network.  If they require a service that runs on Windows,
&gt; that's why in our plan, we made room for a Windows server.
&gt;
&gt; Take a look at this:
&gt;
&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:bugman@jerome">bugman@jerome</A> /home/bugman]$ uptime
&gt;  9:33AM  up 126 days, 13:14, 2 users, load averages: 0.08, 0.13, 0.06
&gt;
&gt; Jerome, our web server, providing 75% of services to our network, has been
&gt; online for 126 days without failing.  I have hardly even had to touch it in
&gt; the last six months.  I believe it has been rebooted once.  It's just
&gt; cruised on by all on its own without any major intervention from me.

You might follow this up with a reference to
<A HREF="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/today/top.avg.html,">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/today/top.avg.html,</A> in particular the
"OS" column.

&gt; Megatron, running PRONTO, was online for 176 days before I rebooted
&gt; it two weeks ago.  In that time, it had only had one fault with it,
&gt; a fault which I have since repaired.  Grouchy fell over about once a
&gt; week.  It required constant rebooting, and all it was doing was
&gt; running PRONTO.

Can you present this in %age downtime?  Or total down time per month?
Ask him to estimate how much that costs in lost productivity.

&gt;&gt; I have no dispute FreeBSD may be technically superior, faster, more
&gt;&gt; flexible
&gt;
&gt; Do I need to say any more? :-)

No.

&gt;&gt; but I would still have to live with the fact if you left the
&gt;&gt; company I would have to find someone with the expertise to manage
&gt;&gt; the system.
&gt;
&gt; If I left the company, you'd be able to re-hire my position like
&gt; *snap* &lt;-- That.  I'll even tell you how ;) Post a job vacancy on
&gt; the LinuxSA mailing list (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A>) telling them
&gt; that a Unix/NT Systems Administration position has become available,
&gt; and you'll get dozens of skilled applicants.  They're all looking
&gt; for the job I'm lucky to have.

You might also mention companies like Tellurian that can help if they
can't find an appropriate person.

&gt;&gt; I also don't believe FreeBSD can keep up with Microsoft and its
&gt;&gt; technologies which could restrict us in the future, especially with
&gt;&gt; .NET style products on the market.
&gt;
&gt; There is no reason that .NET products can't still be supported.  So
&gt; far there has been no evidence of a market shift towards this
&gt; "technology," and it will probably end up being another Microsoft
&gt; Passport.

Note that Microsoft has singled out FreeBSD as a good example of an
open source project which would be compatible with .NET.  This was
some time ago, and it was obvious that they were trying to play off
BSD against Linux, but the statement can be used for other purposes as
well :-)  See
<A HREF="http://www.crn.com/sections/BreakingNews/breakingnews.asp?ArticleID">http://www.crn.com/sections/BreakingNews/breakingnews.asp?ArticleID</A>=27727:

  The implementation of Microsoft's core .Net development tools on
  FreeBSD and Windows are expected to be published as source code
  under Microsoft's recently released Shared Source licensing
  framework.

&gt; Unix has got heaps of developments going on, the XFS file system,
&gt; which supports journalling and ACLs, CODA, which transports only
&gt; parts of files which have changed, so that your overall network
&gt; traffic is reduced.  I won't bore you with more examples, but I
&gt; believe that statement to be untrue.

XFS doesn't run on FreeBSD.  I also think that this issue is somewhat
irrelevant to the discussion.

&gt; Windows, by default, can't even rotate its own error logs.  You have to do
&gt; that manually.
&gt;
&gt; Windows, by default, can't send out emails, or allow users on the system to
&gt; communicate.
&gt;
&gt; Windows, by default, is an insecure operating system that opens itself up
&gt; to the world, instead of opening up only those services that are required.
&gt;
&gt; Windows is still juggling around 16bit/32bit environments.  I can't believe
&gt; we're still dealing with NT Virtual DOS Machine environments.
&gt;
&gt; Windows, by default, does not integrate its command prompt system and it's
&gt; gui very well at all.  You can't develop much for it.  It has all sorts of
&gt; weird different environments going all at once -- the GUI environment, with
&gt; an application with buttons and menus; the vbs environment, where a script
&gt; executes and uses Windows API's and other connectivity to get information
&gt; out of Windows; the command environment, where you are extremely limited in
&gt; the way you can script information, and extremely limited in the kind of
&gt; information you can get out.

I'll leave it to you to decide whether your boss will understand these
issues.

&gt;&gt; We are spending a lot of time and effort trying to mimic a Windows
&gt;&gt; domain when we can have the real thing.

I think you should address the "time and effort" statement.  It looks
as if whatever time and effort you have spent is already over, so this
issue loses its importance.  If you can show the time and effort to be
very little, all the better.

&gt; Samba isn't about mimicing a Windows domain.  It's about providing a server
&gt; interface to Windows clients using the smb protocol.  Windows rules the
&gt; desktop.  As such it is clearly obvious that some sort of integration is
&gt; necessary when trying to serve Windows clients.  In comes Samba.
&gt;
&gt; One of the reasons Samba may be one step behind integrating itself with
&gt; Windows is that Windows is completely closed source.  Samba has been
&gt; developed by reverse engineering the way Windows communicates, and because
&gt; it has been so strong on the market for so long, it has proven itself to be
&gt; strong, robust and flexible.
&gt;
&gt; I have set up a Samba Domain environment on FreeBSD which allows users to
&gt; authenticate, share files, and maintain permissions.  If I wished, I could
&gt; add on printing to that.  I had decided not to pursue that avenue at this
&gt; point, because I did not want to lose my automated printer installation
&gt; program from the Intranet.  That's a function that IIS provides that I
&gt; adapted into.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I know you will find this disappointing but I know this is the right
&gt;&gt; decision and will be able to sleep again at night.
&gt;
&gt; Administering Windows was why I didn't sleep at night.  I believe it would
&gt; be reason enough for an employee's manager, however afraid of how his
&gt; systems are running in an alien environment, to sleep at night knowing his
&gt; IT Officer is sleeping properly.  I'd be more worried if he was the one
&gt; tossing and turning.

Heh.

&gt; I'd like to finish off with a few additional points if I may:
&gt;
&gt; Our Intranet
&gt; ------------
&gt;
&gt; Jerome, which is running FreeBSD 4.7, has proven itself.
&gt;
&gt; Apache:  Serving our Intranet.  Running php, I have an extraordinary amount
&gt; of power at my fingertips.  PHP is another skill I have picked up in the
&gt; last 12 months.  It's been a wonderful tool and at this stage I think it is
&gt; one of the more endeering features of the Intranet, however server-side it
&gt; may be.  It automates a lot more than I ever could have done without it.
&gt;
&gt; If you have a look at the Intranet's "Fax Resource" page, it will show you,
&gt; live, the last 50 faxes that were sent, the current status of the network
&gt; fax, and throw some statistics at you.  They're all done automatically, and
&gt; I never have to touch them again.

How much work does this save you?  Rub his nose in it.

&gt; One of the reasons that is so wonderful for me, is that Unix works on the
&gt; principle of stdin and stdout.  Windows does too, but because Windows runs
&gt; "services,"  uses an "Event Log," configures objects via the GUI and a
&gt; registry, I can't integrate other systems in with it easily.  As for that
&gt; page, I just had PHP collect the information I needed to provide, and
&gt; present it on screen.  I can look in on my entire network by way of this.
&gt; I was hoping to implement this kind of functionality once FreeBSD was in
&gt; place permanently.

Is this relevant?

&gt; Network Faxing:  A system automated by open source.  Had it not been for
&gt; the code, I would be restricted to using a product the way it was designed.
&gt; Fortunately for me, I was able to edit the scripts that Hylafax uses
&gt; and add a backup sequence to the script which meant that any faxes were not
&gt; only emailed to reception, but were also dumped up on the Intranet.  I have
&gt; the power and the flexibility to do whatever I want.
&gt;
&gt; I adapted the technology of that script, and created a PDF Printer.  Users
&gt; can now, without installing additional software onto their computers, print
&gt; a PDF document that is automatically emailed back to them.  The script is
&gt; simple:  I set up a printer using Samba on jerome, and configured it to
&gt; execute a script when a job was spooled.  The PDF Printer takes the
&gt; PostScript file, converts it with a utility called ps2pdf, which is a
&gt; native utility to FreeBSD.
&gt;
&gt; (Funny how FreeBSD just has all the tools you require day to day as a part
&gt; of a standard installation.. eh?  POWER!!)
&gt;
&gt; So I wrote a script that generated the correct headers to compose an email,
&gt; converted the PostScript file to PDF, encoded it as a MIME attachment, and
&gt; added it to the email i was creating.  I then completed the email, and
&gt; piped all that I had generated into sendmail.  Sendmail then sends the
&gt; attachment out to the originating user, who's username was supplied by
&gt; Samba.
&gt;
&gt; It took me less than a day to write it.  On Windows, I'd have to deploy a
&gt; 'free' PDF printer from the Internet, or the Acrobat software on *every*
&gt; client.  With this system, a user can install this printer straight over
&gt; the Intranet, and I never ever have to answer a question about creating a
&gt; PDF document ever again.  Ever.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; DNS / DHCP:  Ah but of course, the tools which hold our network together.
&gt; Set up almost a year ago, never touched since :-)
&gt;
&gt; Squid:  The Open Source Proxy software.  And has this been a brilliant
&gt; investment (of $0) or what! 

How long did it take you to install?  How long would a Microsoft
alternative have taken?

&gt; Since we have implemented a proxy server, I have seen a significant
&gt; increase in speed.  There are currently 3.7Gb of cached files stored
&gt; on our server, and that means any clients within our network who use
&gt; websites frequently will get much faster access to those frequently
&gt; requested pages/graphics.  I can run squid reports, and in fact, I
&gt; do, and I can see exactly who used what, when.  I've turned squid on
&gt; once, and never, ever touched it since.
&gt;
&gt; E-Mail:  Native, of course!  Unlike Windows, Unix has the ability to send
&gt; emails out automatically!  That means a script that I write can generate an
&gt; email, and send it out from *any* of my servers directly.  It wouldn't have
&gt; to try and interface and authenticate with an external SMTP server or
&gt; anything like that.  It just works.
&gt;
&gt; RRDTool:  Let me collect information from programatical output.  EG!
&gt;
&gt;         NUMS=`users | wc -w | sed 's/\ //g'`
&gt;
&gt; Set the variable $NUMS for the output of `command`.
&gt;
&gt; users:  lists the users on the system, pipe it through wc, which is a
&gt; utility that counts the number of words you put through it (you can't just
&gt; *do* that on Windows.)  Pipe *that* through sed, which is a text parser.
&gt; sed in this case is getting rid of the spaces, because 'wc' had left some
&gt; spaces at the beginning.  The result of this is a number.  I can now pump
&gt; that into the database and hey presto!  I can generate a graph.
&gt;
&gt; Windows just doesn't make a job like that pleasant.
&gt;
&gt; I know you said you understand the power of FreeBSD, and I just felt the
&gt; need to prove it.  Millions of people are using Unix from day to day, and
&gt; every one of them would go back to Windows if it wasn't worth hanging on
&gt; to.

Hmm.  That's not that simple.  Saying so weakens the overall argument.

&gt; The things I've illustrated above excite me.  They excite me a lot
&gt; more than clicking in the Microsoft management console and managing some
&gt; system.  Unix is what makes my job fun, flexible, and automated.  Windows
&gt; makes my job clunky, underpowered, and frustrating.
&gt;
&gt; Considering the Samba project has been around for many years, and has been
&gt; used by so many people, I can't accept it's dismissal.  I believe that
&gt; perhaps because you know me so well, you knew I would come back at you with
&gt; a response like this one.  I'm hoping it's enough to help you reconsider
&gt; your decision.  You're a software developer who's been using the Windows
&gt; platform for a long time now.  If you dug your head around Unix you'd
&gt; understand what I'm talking about and why I get so excited about it :)
&gt;
&gt; I believe this company can benefit from the integration of FreeBSD into our
&gt; server side systems.  I've seen it happen in the past and I don't want to
&gt; stop it.  I want to see this system go forward and I want to see it
&gt; succeed!

Good luck.

It might be instructive to understand where his real fears lie.  I
don't know how to find that out, unfortunately.
