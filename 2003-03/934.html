Hi All..

I am currently administering a Redhat 7.2 server and generally I keep the
server up to date with the latest security errata via Redhat's up2date RHN
service.  Kernels of course don't get upgraded via this service and I do
this manually from time to time.

What I would like to know is what philosophy to adopt with kernel upgrades.
If I upgraded every time Redhat released a new kernel update, I would not
have uptime extending beyond 20-30 days on average.  Even if I left out the
"bug fix" kernel upgrades that perhaps don't effect my configuration and
only upgraded the kernel on security errata, I would still be upgrading
around once a month, and it's becoming a real nuisance as the server has
many users and kernel upgrades involve service interruptions.

What do other system admins do in this situation??  How do other servers
manage to accrue such massive uptimes but still be kept secure without the
need to install updated kernels based on newly found security
vulnerabilities?  Any light anyone can shed on the matter would be most
appreciated because at the moment I feel like I'm chasing my tail with these
kernel upgrades and I'm starting to wonder if I'm being "over zealous" with
the kernel updates?

Many thanks,
Graham Smith
