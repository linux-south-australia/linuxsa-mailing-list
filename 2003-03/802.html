&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't designed to be flamebait, but we've all seen in 

Heh -- certainly caused a big discussion though :)

&gt; the media claims that Open Source rarely innovates, but 
&gt; typically just copies innovation by others. Whether that's 
&gt; true or not is really irrelevant, but I was hoping that 
&gt; people could pass on some of the areas where they think Open 
&gt; Source software is and has been innovative (preferably stuff 
&gt; that's happened over the last couple of years).

So what you're trying to combat here is the popular idea that it
requires closed source and capitalism to actually innovate. The
unfortunate thing here is that the people who hold these views have
their ideas of computing dominated by one self-proclaimed "innovative"
company. Anything that they don't experience in their homogenous
environment isn't yet comprehensible (eg try explaining the innovations
of X, TeX, Perl, Unix, or even the GPL to a MS junkie). And anything
that they do already experience is claimed by MS to be an MS innovation,
so saying that Unix/OSS had it earlier is insignificant -- "it took MS
to actually get it into the real world..."

The thing is that for the most part, the real innovations happen as
research projects, and then get commercialised by proprietry companies
(like GUIs), or else they are implemented and popularised by OSS (like
the BSD TCP stack). In reality, neither REALLY innovates. The things
that people think are innovations are really just implementations of
other people's innovations, and that is what software development is
really about. The real question is not who innovates most, but who
implements innovations the best. In answering this question, I find two
main differences between the philosophies.

Firstly, they have different foci. OSS has tended to be focussed more on
the server, the programmer, and the systems admin. It has more geeky
software, and panders less to the terminally stupid. This is changing,
but it is likely to always be the case in some degree. Proprietry
software is driven by marketers and sales people, not geeks. It's
usually more polished and shiny looking, and is more likely to have mass
appeal.

Secondly, they have different licences. (duh). Do you want your
innovations for free, or do you want to pay for them? Do you want your
innovations to be free, or do you want a profit-motivated company
controlling them? A little from column A, a little from column B. Mostly
A though.

Realistically though, the choice comes down to personal taste (or
rather, exactly what your needs are) and philosophical approach...
