&gt; So: what should I replace it with?  LCD panels still have too low a
&gt; resolution to be interesting.  I find that I can get the following
&gt; monitors relatively easily.  They're all 21" (i.e. 20" visible),
&gt; though some claim to be 22".
&gt; 
&gt; Model		Dot pitch		Horizontal freq.	price 
&gt; 
&gt; Benq P211	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,080
&gt; NEC FP1355	  0.24"			121 kHz			$1,300
&gt; Mitsubishi 2115E  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,200
&gt; Mitsubishi 2060u  0.25"			121 kHz			$1,500
&gt; Samsung 1100P+	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,300
&gt; Philips 201B	  0.25" 		107 kHz			$1,060
&gt; Philips 202B	  0.24" 		130 kHz			$1,660
&gt; Sony CPDG520      0.24"			?			$1,900
&gt; Hitachi CM 823F	  0.25"			121 kHz			$1,550
&gt; 
&gt; On the face of it, there's not much to choose between any of them
&gt; except the Sony, which is too expensive for my liking.  The only of
&gt; these manufacturers I've had experience with is Hitachi (with whom I'm
&gt; quite happy; I have two 813 monitors with 115 kHz scan).  On the face
&gt; of it, Benq or maybe Mitsubish look like being the best bet.  Does
&gt; anybody have experience with any of these monitors?

the sony may be expensive, but i would say they are the best monitors in
my office. we do have a range of similarly spec'd monitors, and i would
choose the mitsubishi or the philips ... or an ADI. don't go for the
cheaper Benqs or LGs. i have replaced more of those over the years thand
i care to mention. 

oh and check the warranty period, some manufacturers offer up to three
years by default, others only six months ...

if you're tempted by an LCD take a first look at the Samsung, they are
the biggest manufacturer ATM and have just brought online several new
plants in SE Asia to fill the demand, they're the ducks nuts and better
priced than most others, especially in the larger formats. IIRR the
17" LCDs just released? are the cheapest for $/inch =)

Cheers,

Kim
