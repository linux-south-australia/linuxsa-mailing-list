We have 2 Hewlett Packard PIII's (650mz) and I have never liked them.  I 
found them to have a decent speed,  but  it always felt like I had to 
fight the mouse, especially in Windows 2000.

Anyway,  one of the computers while in Windows 2000, would loose its 
connection to the network printers.  That, combined with a complaint of 
loosing connections to the network, I felt it was about time to consider 
changing network cards.

I went out and got a Netgear 10/100 ethernet card for the machine and 
installed it in Linux first.

Easy as pie.  Easy, easy easy. No problem.

Now to Windows 2000.   *New hardware detected.*  I click the next button 
as necessary, and then insert the manufacturer's floppy disk into the 
drive to supply the driver, and it seems to go ok, yeah it said 
something about the driver being digitally signed, but it asked if I 
wanted to go on, and I said yes.

But when I clicked finish, it said....

*New hardware detected.*  This crap went on, so I went and exchanged the 
card for an Intel card.

Again no problem in Linux, but in Windows 2000 same crap.

&lt;Sarcasm&gt;

Boy do I look forward to the day that every piece of software on my 
machine is approved by someone else!!! That way I won't be able to fix 
things myself!!!   :-)

Oh happy day.

&lt;/Sarcasm&gt;

Well, I am going to enjoy the rest of my Saturday.
