&gt;how are you going to back this up? 
&gt; - we use amanda, it does tape changeers, i about to put in a 
&gt;8 slot LTO or SLTD driver soon
&gt; - cost of backup software for windows server is ... 5K+ per year

Or you can still buy enterprise quality backup software for Linux
anyway if management don't like the idea of "free" backup solutions.  
We use Arcserve on our Linux boxes, mainly because it was
already used on our MS servers and we could integrate servers with 
client agents and so forth.  Works well, if a little on the expensive
side of the equation.


&gt;we get a lot of extra milage out of our servers because we can spend
&gt;twice as much on the hardware instead of particular software licences.
&gt;
&gt;for example i am able to spend about 20K on a new mail server,
&gt;because it will still cost less than a fifth of the cost of a
&gt;slightly lower spec'd MS Exchange server on a Windows Server...
&gt;and from that i'll have spare change in the budget to by a 
&gt;bigger tape backup server for about 15K!

This is one of the major selling points of open source for us, we saved
enough on our last fileserver to change from the rather unreliable DAT
tapes to AIT.  Those savings were just from W2k CALs and OS costs...


&gt;ok, so you will have to invest the time yourself up front to setup some
&gt;of the software the hard way, but you will have more available time
&gt;later down the track to implement more *interesting* things =)

Value added services, where open source kicks some proverbial :)
