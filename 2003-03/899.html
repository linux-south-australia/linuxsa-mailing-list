&gt; &gt;Take an example: would you give a complete newbie Emacs to write texts
&gt; &gt;with?  I suspect not.  But why not?
&gt; 
&gt; Because the learning curve is too great.  Doing something
&gt; simple should be simple -- text processing under Emacs is
&gt; not simple.

remember the average vi *or* emacs user only knows about
ten commands.

the vi ones i can remember are;
:sp file  open a new buffer in a new window pane
:wqa write, and quit all files
{gq} reformat current paragraph
:/%s/sometext/someothertext/g  with regexs as per usual 
( regex replace would be the most often used commands =) )
i fer insert @ current position
I fer insert @ begining of line
a fer insert after current character
A fer append @ end of line
yy copy current line
p paste after current character/line
P paste before current character/line
D delete to end of line
dd delete current line
:gUU conver line to upper sace.
hjkl or arrow for movement

thats about it, certainly the only nes i use on a 
regular basis ..

an i can do everything i ever need to do on a daily basis
with that. now why do we need WYSIWYG interfaces again?

&gt; As a contrast you might take FrameMaker -- writing a
&gt; letter is easy.  But when the user has grown and
&gt; feels the need for markup rather than WYSIWYG, well
&gt; it turns out that FrameMaker has been doing markup
&gt; under the hood all along.
&gt; 
&gt; My problem with StarOffice is that it doesn't aim
&gt; high enough.  On the plus side, I notice that it's
&gt; not precluded from doing so (eg: file format allows
&gt; semantic markup) and that many of the people involved
&gt; want to make StarOffice a deeper tool.

when i first started using word processors on a regular
basis i sorta settled on word perfect 5.1 + various tools.

i mostly typed up the text, then applied fairly standard
formating to it... then tweaked the markup with the markup 
window at the bottom.

shortly afterwards i found TeX and between VI and emacs
I could produce damn near perfect documents very similar
to that of WP51, but in sensible fonts in a similar amount 
of time =)

it took me a couple of weeks to learn all WP51 had to offer
and about a month to figure out what TeX had to offer, then
another week to get the MathTeX sorted.

but now i am required to use Orifice 2000, which can't even
get its header number consistent, or do consistent paragraph
formatting.

im at the point of telling my cow orkers that they can expect
text or pdf documents in the near future cause word can't even
do what WP51 and TeX could more than ten years ago =(

cheers,

Kim

PS - i am now about to embark on a staroffice 6.0 test and
somehow am not looking forward to it =/
