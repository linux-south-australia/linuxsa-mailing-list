There are some areas where innovation is not a good idea, and this is one of
them.

I have noticed that car manufacturers are not very innovative in the layout
of their controls either. They all seem to put the major controls in the
same positions relative to the driver's seat!

The open source community could always use the excuse theat the commercial
developers use. "We did it because that is what our users were demanding".
If our users want our environments to look like some commercial offering
then who are we to decide otherwise?

There is no reason why open source needs to be innovative per se, so gibes
from MS about not being innovative can be ignored.

We have certainly been innovative on price and development organisation. The
book "Rebel Code" which traces the history of the open source movement
certainly leaves you with the feeling that there certainly has been a very
real innovation in the building of volunteer communities to develop
software. And it rolls on despite the attempts of the commercial side to
break it up.

Gnome's stretchy icons... mmmmm... stretchy icons...

Err, yeah, anyway, but as people said previously, there isn't much
innovation going on in the mainstream free and non-free DE's.

They are all based on the 2D desktop WIMP metaphor, which I think is
containstraining factor. It has been done to death, most changes are
going to be tweaks and incremental improvements. This is why it is hard
to point at anything Gnome and KDE are going and call it innovation.

To get real user interface innovation, you need to look at the alternate
metaphors. Document streams is a good example, that weird-arse 3D
environment MS's research division was playing with a few years ago is
another.
