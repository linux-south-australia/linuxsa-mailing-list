 &gt;Hi all, slight problem.
 &gt;
 &gt;My manager and I have been working to implement a Samba environment to
 &gt;replace our Windows domain.  So far everything's been rippa!
 &gt;
 &gt;Until I received this "Back-out" email this morning.  You can see my
 &gt;rebuttle.  I seriously do not want to lose this project, because I don't
 &gt;want to shrivel up and die as an NT Admin for the rest of my life.
 &gt;
 &gt;It's extremely long winded.  I wanted to *PROVE* everything I could.
 &gt;Before I send this off, can I please get some feedback, corrections,
 &gt;additions and amendments? :)
 &gt;
 &gt;
I will try to respond from the point of view of a guy in a similar
situation. :-)

I think that your approach should match the AU government policy with
open source. Anything else invites defeat on political grounds.

I am with you at least in moral support..... I hope this comes accross
friendly and not critical. :-)

 &gt;&gt;Adam,
 &gt;&gt;After much thought I realised I approved the usage of FreeBSD for you 
and no
 &gt;&gt;other reason. We have been, are, and probably always will be a Microsoft
 &gt;&gt;house.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
Ok, it sounds like this is tough for your boss. You two seem to be good
friends.

*Enemies* are often the best critics.  An enemy he is _not_.

He doesn't want to hurt your feelings, for whatever reason.

 &gt;This is all very sudden.
 &gt;
Ditto on last...

 &gt;While we may be a 'Microsoft house,' I don't
 &gt;believe that's necessarily relevant when it comes to our network
 &gt;Administration.  The server-side network is in place to provide a 
front-end
 &gt;to services for the clients.  As long as a client can plug in, and do what
 &gt;he or she needs to do, it does not matter what is running on the back-end.
 &gt;
 &gt;

You need a critic.   You need to be told what _he_ is not satisfied
with, so you can answer his concerns directly.  You need to be able to
tell him why he will not be 'kept up at night' by expanding upon the
differences between his perception and reality.  You have to be able to
sort out if he has valid concerns about past experiences,  or if his
decision is based more upon his opinion, rather than, or contrary to, fact.

Because your boss is gun shy[1], it may be best to ask a neutral outside
person to look at the big picture unemotionally and help both of you
discover the reality of the situation. A meeting of the minds.  Answers
to questions. Expectations.  Benchmarks for sucess and failure.

During this talk, you have to step outside the attachment you have to
your craftsmanship.  After all you don't want to see everything you had
accomplished and built go to dust.


 &gt;I had chosen Samba as a server choice because, while not having used
 &gt;Linux or FreeBSD actively up until about a year ago, I was always keeping
 &gt;my head in.  I knew that, while seen by some as the 'baby' of the server
 &gt;market, it will grow into the Einstein.
 &gt;
 &gt;
You want to sell Samba.

Make a list of everything that Samba can do that will benefit the
company.  Change that paragraph above to read like that.

Ideas:

1. Samba does what you need it to do. (Why pay for a fancy [2]GUI or an
FTP or SQL server that comes with Windows NT when you don't need one. )

2. (I don't know enough about Samba's security but if its better than
Windows NT, mention it!)


 &gt;I've been a member of the LinuxSA mailing list for the last four years.
 &gt;The only reason it took me up until last year to begin experimenting with
 &gt;Unix was for two reasons:
 &gt;
 &gt;a)  I was comfortable with what I knew, ie. Windows
 &gt;b)  Linux was overwhelming to me, and seemed a little overcomplicated for
 &gt;    my liking.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Ok, two important things.   Where do you do your experimenting?  Have
your skills grown to require you to do less? (That answer has _got_ to
be yes, because I know what its like...and I love to experiment and
learn myself...but some of this, if not most of this has to be done
after hours, because of the doubled up effort you have to put in during
the migration. You have to maintain _both_ Unix and Microsoft now.  That
gives hie the misconception of total cost of ownership being _higher_
BECAUSE OF Unix.  :-) )

Second thing. If you are comfortable with the plans as they were, you
should eliminate any kind of message that is contrary to your comfort
level.  That just detracts from the message, which is that you are
honestly confident.

If you are not honestly confident that you can satisfy your boss, you
should accept his decision.

 &gt;I had still wanted to get to know it, and that's why I teamed up with one
 &gt;of my friends to help me Fasttrack into getting to know it.  Ever since
 &gt;doing that, I've seen how powerful it actually is.
 &gt;
Objection your honor!  Don't make this a personal arguement.
Remember Captain Picard!.... Remember Captain Picard!...


 &gt;Everything Microsoft
 &gt;has released, Unix has either released prior, or has a technology that is
 &gt;equally as powerful.  Microsoft often copies Unix technology, and Unix
 &gt;often copies Microsoft technology.
 &gt;
 &gt;Were you aware that the original TCP/IP stack in Microsoft Windows NT was
 &gt;written by Berkley Software Distribution, a company who are now better
 &gt;known for releasing their Open Source product, FreeBSD.  It wasn't until
 &gt;Microsoft realized they were violating the BSD License by closing their
 &gt;source code, that they rewrote the TCP/IP code in-house.
 &gt;
 &gt;Unix has been around for 30 years.  It was never developed for the desktop
 &gt;until the last few years, and it was certainly never pushed like Microsoft
 &gt;have with their products.  In terms of age, Unix is superior to Microsoft.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Objection your honor!

Go for the meat,  point out the direct benefits. Nothing that can be
construed as hearsay or propaganda.


 &gt;Now that I have come to get to know FreeBSD better, I am much more
 &gt;comfortable using it.  I even now write scripts to help me automate my
 &gt;work, and I know how to begin troubleshooting problems as they arise. 
  When
 &gt;I can't answer a question, I use the LinuxSA mailing list, or the 
advice of
 &gt;those around me.
 &gt;
 &gt;
YES. :-)   These scripts should have a compounding effect in reducing
cost of ownership and the need to maintain. They have also completed
studies, maybe Microsoft even admits, that it takes less people to
maintain a Unix house. You have to demonstrate to him that life
continues to get easier.  That means LAY OFF THE R&D FOR A WHILE.

Yeah, that's my biggest temptation, R&D.  And its hella fun!   :-)  But
now might be a good time to call your knowledge base "stable" and show
him how efficient you are with what you know. Demonstrate the gains
found by Unix, without letting it get lost in expirimentation.


 &gt;Even now, I use X running Gnome2 on FreeBSD as my workstation.  I only 
ever
 &gt;boot back into Windows when I absolutely *have* to.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Objection!

 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;It doesn't make sense when we have all these expertise in-house to
 &gt;&gt;move away from what we know and love.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
Definitely a good time to mention that it takes less people to maintain
a Unix house _and_ that Unix knowledge is _real_ knowledge. Knowing
which wizzard to use or what to click is NOT EXPERTISE.

On the practical side, the guy probably doesn't want to fire his windows
administrators and replace them with Linux people. (Seems that is the
way he might see it) No one wants to plan on firing people!


 &gt;I don't know about 'love.' :)  In the time that I've moved further towards
 &gt;Unix and away from Windows, I've learned just how much easier the
 &gt;environment is to work with.  Unix is a complicated place, and you have to
 &gt;have more than blonde hair to use it.
 &gt;
Tell him how blonde your hair has become.


 &gt; Unix is a powerhouse.  It's full of
 &gt;tools that Bill Gates never even thought of.  Once I started using FreeBSD
 &gt;and learning more and more about the contents of that /bin directory, I
 &gt;began to start realizing exactly what I would be able to do with it.
 &gt;
 &gt;The software development team is used to using Windows, and granted they
 &gt;develop using it, however this is not relevant when it comes to
 &gt;administering the network.  If they require a service that runs on 
Windows,
 &gt;that's why in our plan, we made room for a Windows server.
 &gt;
Maybe he wants to use a known commodity. Thus the phenominon of many
bosses not knowing that they were using open source systems. :-) A
prototype is a bettter approach IMHO.

 &gt;
 &gt;Take a look at this:
 &gt;
 &gt;[<A HREF="mailto:bugman@jerome">bugman@jerome</A> /home/bugman]$ uptime
 &gt; 9:33AM  up 126 days, 13:14, 2 users, load averages: 0.08, 0.13, 0.06
 &gt;
 &gt;Jerome, our web server, providing 75% of services to our network, has been
 &gt;online for 126 days without failing.  I have hardly even had to touch 
it in
 &gt;the last six months.  I believe it has been rebooted once.  It's just
 &gt;cruised on by all on its own without any major intervention from me.
 &gt;
Not directly relevant from me: You do security updates, right... or not
a problem with Free BSD?

 &gt;
 &gt;Megatron, running PRONTO, was online for 176 days before I rebooted it two
 &gt;weeks ago.  In that time, it had only had one fault with it, a fault which
 &gt;I have since repaired.  Grouchy fell over about once a week.  It required
 &gt;constant rebooting, and all it was doing was running PRONTO.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;I have no dispute FreeBSD may be
 &gt;&gt;technically superior, faster, more flexible
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;Do I need to say any more? :-)
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;but I would still have to live
 &gt;&gt;with the fact if you left the company I would have to find someone 
with the
 &gt;&gt;expertise to manage the system.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;If I left the company, you'd be able to re-hire my position like 
*snap* &lt;--
 &gt;That.  I'll even tell you how ;)  Post a job vacancy on the LinuxSA 
mailing
 &gt;list (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A>) telling them that a Unix/NT Systems
 &gt;Administration position has become available, and you'll get dozens of
 &gt;skilled applicants.  They're all looking for the job I'm lucky to have.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Bingo. Maybe expand upon the talent pool here at LinuxSA, and how it has
the ability to even rub off on clueless individuals such as myself, at
least to the point that I can pretend....a bit....


 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;I also don't believe FreeBSD can keep up
 &gt;&gt;with Microsoft and its technologies which could restrict us in the 
future,
 &gt;&gt;especially with .NET style products on the market.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
Objection! Calls for speculation.


 &gt;There is no reason that .NET products can't still be supported.  So far
 &gt;there has been no evidence of a market shift towards this 
"technology," and
 &gt;it will probably end up being another Microsoft Passport.
 &gt;
 &gt;While that is my opinion, you do raise a point, but again I believe each
 &gt;server we provide here should be tailored to meet it's requirements.  Why
 &gt;did we move PRONTO from Windows NT to Red Hat Linux?  We moved it because
 &gt;we'd heard, mind you, heard, that it outperformed Windows by a long shot.
 &gt;Upon doing so, we haven't regretted it since.  I certainly haven't.  I 
have
 &gt;only needed to do maintenance to that server once in the time it's been
 &gt;online.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Right on!


 &gt;If it were so far ahead, why is it always Windows that crashes, Windows
 &gt;that doesn't give you useable output, or Windows that just plain doesn't
 &gt;work, or Windows that requires manual intervention all the time?
 &gt;
 &gt;Unix has got heaps of developments going on, the XFS file system, which
 &gt;supports journalling and ACLs, CODA, which transports only parts of files
 &gt;which have changed, so that your overall network traffic is reduced.  I
 &gt;won't bore you with more examples, but I believe that statement to be
 &gt;untrue.
 &gt;
 &gt;Windows, by default, can't even rotate its own error logs.  You have to do
 &gt;that manually.
 &gt;
 &gt;Windows, by default, can't send out emails, or allow users on the 
system to
 &gt;communicate.
 &gt;
 &gt;Windows, by default, is an insecure operating system that opens itself up
 &gt;to the world, instead of opening up only those services that are required.
 &gt;
 &gt;Windows is still juggling around 16bit/32bit environments.  I can't 
believe
 &gt;we're still dealing with NT Virtual DOS Machine environments.
 &gt;
 &gt;Windows, by default, does not integrate its command prompt system and it's
 &gt;gui very well at all.  You can't develop much for it.  It has all sorts of
 &gt;weird different environments going all at once -- the GUI environment, 
with
 &gt;an application with buttons and menus; the vbs environment, where a script
 &gt;executes and uses Windows API's and other connectivity to get information
 &gt;out of Windows; the command environment, where you are extremely 
limited in
 &gt;the way you can script information, and extremely limited in the kind of
 &gt;information you can get out.
 &gt;
I think a lot of these can be disregarded as immaterial. Sure, it
crashes, but its not bad enough to keep me up at night. I wouldn't focus
on anything but the benefits of using Unix here.


 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;We are spending a lot of
 &gt;&gt;time and effort trying to mimic a Windows domain when we can have the 
real
 &gt;&gt;thing.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
You know what you ought to do..... :-)   Come in about an hour early and
put Samba on that Apache server. Then when he starts talking about how
much time it will take to set it up, tell him that you already set a
sample one up this morning. Apologize for the excessive waste of company
time. Dobby.   :-D


 &gt;Samba isn't about mimicing a Windows domain.  It's about providing a 
server
 &gt;interface to Windows clients using the smb protocol.  Windows rules the
 &gt;desktop.  As such it is clearly obvious that some sort of integration is
 &gt;necessary when trying to serve Windows clients.  In comes Samba.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Address his concern, the time it will take to set up and maintain.

 &gt;One of the reasons Samba may be one step behind integrating itself with
 &gt;Windows is that Windows is completely closed source.  Samba has been
 &gt;developed by reverse engineering the way Windows communicates, and because
 &gt;it has been so strong on the market for so long, it has proven itself 
to be
 &gt;strong, robust and flexible.
 &gt;
 &gt;
Remember, make the words that are on paper appear as confident as you feel.
If you are confident that Samba is good enough, let him know that is how
you feel.  It also has to be behind on technologies you will use.


 &gt;I have set up a Samba Domain environment on FreeBSD which allows users to
 &gt;authenticate, share files, and maintain permissions.  If I wished, I could
 &gt;add on printing to that.  I had decided not to pursue that avenue at this
 &gt;point, because I did not want to lose my automated printer installation
 &gt;program from the Intranet.  That's a function that IIS provides that I
 &gt;adapted into.
 &gt;
 &gt;
So you already have one!  What does he think about it?

 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;I know you will find this disappointing but I know this is the right
 &gt;&gt;decision and will be able to sleep again at night.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
Don't know the circumstances, but what ever he thinks is the cause, it
should be the focus of your answer.



 &gt;Administering Windows was why I didn't sleep at night.  I believe it would
 &gt;be reason enough for an employee's manager, however afraid of how his
 &gt;systems are running in an alien environment, to sleep at night knowing his
 &gt;IT Officer is sleeping properly.  I'd be more worried if he was the one
 &gt;tossing and turning.
 &gt;
 &gt;I'd like to finish off with a few additional points if I may:
 &gt;
Put this stuff right up front where he can read it. Stuff below too!


 &gt;
 &gt;Our Intranet
 &gt;------------
 &gt;
 &gt;Jerome, which is running FreeBSD 4.7, has proven itself.
 &gt;
 &gt;Apache:  Serving our Intranet.  Running php, I have an extraordinary 
amount
 &gt;of power at my fingertips.  PHP is another skill I have picked up in the
 &gt;last 12 months.  It's been a wonderful tool and at this stage I think 
it is
 &gt;one of the more endeering features of the Intranet, however server-side it
 &gt;may be.  It automates a lot more than I ever could have done without it.
 &gt;
 &gt;If you have a look at the Intranet's "Fax Resource" page, it will show 
you,
 &gt;live, the last 50 faxes that were sent, the current status of the network
 &gt;fax, and throw some statistics at you.  They're all done 
automatically, and
 &gt;I never have to touch them again.
 &gt;
 &gt;One of the reasons that is so wonderful for me, is that Unix works on the
 &gt;principle of stdin and stdout.  Windows does too, but because Windows runs
 &gt;"services,"  uses an "Event Log," configures objects via the GUI and a
 &gt;registry, I can't integrate other systems in with it easily.  As for that
 &gt;page, I just had PHP collect the information I needed to provide, and
 &gt;present it on screen.  I can look in on my entire network by way of this.
 &gt;I was hoping to implement this kind of functionality once FreeBSD was in
 &gt;place permanently.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;Network Faxing:  A system automated by open source.  Had it not been for
 &gt;the code, I would be restricted to using a product the way it was 
designed.
 &gt;Fortunately for me, I was able to edit the scripts that Hylafax uses
 &gt;and add a backup sequence to the script which meant that any faxes 
were not
 &gt;only emailed to reception, but were also dumped up on the Intranet.  I 
have
 &gt;the power and the flexibility to do whatever I want.
 &gt;
 &gt;I adapted the technology of that script, and created a PDF Printer.  Users
 &gt;can now, without installing additional software onto their computers, 
print
 &gt;a PDF document that is automatically emailed back to them.  The script is
 &gt;simple:  I set up a printer using Samba on jerome, and configured it to
 &gt;execute a script when a job was spooled.  The PDF Printer takes the
 &gt;PostScript file, converts it with a utility called ps2pdf, which is a
 &gt;native utility to FreeBSD.
 &gt;
 &gt;(Funny how FreeBSD just has all the tools you require day to day as a part
 &gt;of a standard installation.. eh?  POWER!!)
 &gt;
 &gt;So I wrote a script that generated the correct headers to compose an 
email,
 &gt;converted the PostScript file to PDF, encoded it as a MIME attachment, and
 &gt;added it to the email i was creating.  I then completed the email, and
 &gt;piped all that I had generated into sendmail.  Sendmail then sends the
 &gt;attachment out to the originating user, who's username was supplied by
 &gt;Samba.
 &gt;
 &gt;It took me less than a day to write it.  On Windows, I'd have to deploy a
 &gt;'free' PDF printer from the Internet, or the Acrobat software on *every*
 &gt;client.  With this system, a user can install this printer straight over
 &gt;the Intranet, and I never ever have to answer a question about creating a
 &gt;PDF document ever again.  Ever.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;DNS / DHCP:  Ah but of course, the tools which hold our network together.
 &gt;Set up almost a year ago, never touched since :-)
 &gt;
 &gt;Squid:  The Open Source Proxy software.  And has this been a brilliant
 &gt;investment (of $0) or what!  Since we have implemented a proxy server, I
 &gt;have seen a significant increase in speed.  There are currently 3.7Gb of
 &gt;cached files stored on our server, and that means any clients within our
 &gt;network who use websites frequently will get much faster access to those
 &gt;frequently requested pages/graphics.  I can run squid reports, and in 
fact,
 &gt;I do, and I can see exactly who used what, when.  I've turned squid on
 &gt;once, and never, ever touched it since.
 &gt;
 &gt;E-Mail:  Native, of course!  Unlike Windows, Unix has the ability to send
 &gt;emails out automatically!  That means a script that I write can 
generate an
 &gt;email, and send it out from *any* of my servers directly.  It wouldn't 
have
 &gt;to try and interface and authenticate with an external SMTP server or
 &gt;anything like that.  It just works.
 &gt;
 &gt;RRDTool:  Let me collect information from programatical output.  EG!
 &gt;
 &gt;        NUMS=`users | wc -w | sed 's/\ //g'`
 &gt;
 &gt;Set the variable $NUMS for the output of `command`.
 &gt;
 &gt;users:  lists the users on the system, pipe it through wc, which is a
 &gt;utility that counts the number of words you put through it (you can't just
 &gt;*do* that on Windows.)  Pipe *that* through sed, which is a text parser.
 &gt;sed in this case is getting rid of the spaces, because 'wc' had left some
 &gt;spaces at the beginning.  The result of this is a number.  I can now pump
 &gt;that into the database and hey presto!  I can generate a graph.
 &gt;
 &gt;Windows just doesn't make a job like that pleasant.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;I know you said you understand the power of FreeBSD, and I just felt the
 &gt;need to prove it.  Millions of people are using Unix from day to day, and
 &gt;every one of them would go back to Windows if it wasn't worth hanging on
 &gt;to.  The things I've illustrated above excite me.  They excite me a lot
 &gt;more than clicking in the Microsoft management console and managing some
 &gt;system.
 &gt;
 &gt;Unix is what makes my job fun, flexible, and automated.  Windows
 &gt;makes my job clunky, underpowered, and frustrating.
 &gt;

You can't make this a personal arguement, its got to be a business
decision, or it will loose on political grounds.


 &gt;
 &gt;Considering the Samba project has been around for many years, and has been
 &gt;used by so many people, I can't accept it's dismissal.
 &gt;
This is evidence!


 &gt;I believe that
 &gt;perhaps because you know me so well, you knew I would come back at you 
with
 &gt;a response like this one.  I'm hoping it's enough to help you reconsider
 &gt;your decision.  You're a software developer who's been using the Windows
 &gt;platform for a long time now.  If you dug your head around Unix you'd
 &gt;understand what I'm talking about and why I get so excited about it :)
 &gt;
 &gt;I believe this company can benefit from the integration of FreeBSD 
into our
 &gt;server side systems.  I've seen it happen in the past and I don't want to
 &gt;stop it.  I want to see this system go forward and I want to see it
 &gt;succeed!
