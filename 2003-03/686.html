&gt;&gt;That samba mysql howto may work, but there's a much, much better way of 
&gt;&gt;doing it.  I need to write up the howto/documentation for the guy who 
&gt;&gt;wrote a dedicated samba mysql module, just keep running out of time :(
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I guess the problem is, what are the "standards" when it comes to this kind
&gt; of thing?  Where my boss might be thinking he's comfortable with Windows, he
&gt; knows that wherever he goes, Windows will be configured in a similar way,
&gt; because the interface provides the standards (ie Active Directory, and
&gt; that's about it.)
&gt; 
&gt; Under Unix, you have total flexibility, so you can do whatever you want.
&gt; But is that always good?  Sure it is, if you have a complex setup or a
&gt; problem you need to workaround, but I am trying to develop something from
&gt; scratch, so I don't really have a lot of "integration issues" yet.  Because
&gt; of this, I want to adhere to some 'standards.'  In this case, should I be
&gt; following the Samba documentation, the PAM documentation, or something
&gt; else?  It loses my confidence a little when I am stringing things together
&gt; -- I'm trying to find a big solid guide that will help me build an
&gt; environment with PAM, Samba & LDAP.

There also the issues of standards and what works today.

Basically the "standards" in the Unix world are are:

  - local authentication on a Linux/Sun machine -- PAM

  - directory services for people -- LDAP

  - directory services for hosts -- DNS

And you can make all of this work nicely.  For example,
a local service will request PAM to do some authentication
and PAM will satisfy this by doing a query against a
remote LDAP.

Interoperating with Windows can be done two ways -- pretend
to be a Windows authentication server (various technologies,
currently AD) or use Windows GINA API to replace Windows
authentication with LDAP authentication.

I can't comment on the first, Samba is a moving feast
in this area.  I use the second on my home network
(ie: easy to patch all hosts) and it works very well.

If you are using LDAP search Google for "LDAP recipe"
and "eduPerson".  This will tell you how to structure
the LDAP database (the "schema").  Also remember that
LDAP can do replication, so there's no need not to have
the authentication subset of the LDAP database on lots
of machines.

There is one very big gotcha.  Once you have common
authentication then if you expose someone's password
then you've given the interceptor access to everything.

So as part of the common authentication project you also
need to roll out secure protocols and kill plain text
passwords everywhere.  You should start this now, as
I've found tat this takes the longest amount of time
(as you need to get people to reconfigure their client
software).

On the plus side, once you have common authentication
you can use authentication rather than access control
for allowing use of SMTP servers and access to the
"intranet".  This solves a whole stack of "roaming
staff" issues -- your network's services are available
no matter what path people take to get to the network.

A minor gotcha is scheduled password changes.  We have
a three month interval and it's amazing just how many
programs salt away passwords (from e-mail clients to
PPP).  If you are going to do password aging, think
carefully about the time period.  It's probably better
to give everyone infinite lifetime passwords and then
at sometime when business isn't too frantic go and
set everyone's password lifetime to a week, asking
everyone to change their password in that week.

Finally, think about user IDs.  These are a real pain
as the desire to have them readable runs right up
against the system's requirements that they be unique
and unchanging.  If you're a hardarsed BOFH you'll make
them random, avoiding a lot of policy issues at the
cost of some user pain (not as much as you'd suppose
as random userids in base 26 are short).  Again
this is something you can fix now.
