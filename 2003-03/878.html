This is being replied through a webmail client, so apologies
in advance if it comes out spack (or worse, HTML).

It's *very* unlikely that the email is being rejected because of private IP
addresses in Received By headers (if it is, their MTA is severely broken).
It's probably a lot more likely that (if I've understood your network correctly)
that your email is being rejected because you're trying to deliver from
a dynamic IP address obtained via dialup, and that IP address is listed
in someone's RBL blacklist (I seem to recall that there was a similar
list for dialup adresses, but was never very accurate).  Typically in this
situation, you deliver your email to your ISP's MTA, and they deliver if on
your behalf, provided they're not blackisted either.
