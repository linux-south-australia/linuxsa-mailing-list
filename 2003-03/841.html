&gt;&gt;&gt;I think we're looking at things from different perspectives. Innovation
&gt;&gt;&gt;and copying are two different issues, and I personally
&gt;&gt;&gt;would rather see good tools coming out than copies of bad ones.
&gt;&gt;&gt;      
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;From my perspective, the first time I saw a LaTeX document, I was
&gt;&gt;extremely impressed.  My favorite word processor is LyX.   Granted,  if
&gt;&gt;I knew my LaTeX macros my favorite would just be TeX, but I need the GUI
&gt;&gt;training wheels. I do realize that if I already knew the macros the GUI
&gt;&gt;would in fact slow me down, even though I would consider LyX and my
&gt;&gt;machine to be "fast." The training wheels got me to the point where I
&gt;&gt;can do a very simple, minimal LaTeX job.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I cut my teeth on plain TeX.  It's like sendmail: once you get the
&gt;*&&*( thing to work, you've invested so much effort that you don't
&gt;want to change.  I tried to convince O'Reilly to let me write my first
&gt;book in TeX.  They refused.  I later thanked them.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;But there was a time in my life when I knew nothing of LaTeX or LyX
&gt;&gt;, a time when I had no concept of one of my favorite tools.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I am sure this is true of Troff, in my case.  I haven't been around
&gt;&gt;long enough to know what it means to create a quality printout.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;One of the problems with TeX, and LaTeX in particular, is that the
&gt;finished document reaches out, grabs you and shouts, "Look at me!  I
&gt;was formatted with TeX!".  It doesn't have to be that way, of course.
&gt;It's at least partially the fonts, but nearly every TeX document I've
&gt;seen is recognizable.  That's bad in my book.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I have an older Hayden Series book formatted with troff, or some
&gt;&gt;such, and I like the print.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;troff gives you more control over the appearance.  That's why I use
&gt;it.  For example, take a look at
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-jan2003.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-jan2003.html</A>#2, which shows the first
&gt;page of a chapter on Email.  As you can see from the description, it
&gt;wasn't easy to get it to perform this kind of formatting.  I doubt you
&gt;could do it with any other formatting package, however, possibly
&gt;excepting TeX or Frame.  This is the point I was making to Steve
&gt;earlier today: I have better tools than OpenOffice.  I want ones which
&gt;are even better.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;So my question is this: Is there a LyX type tool for Troff, that is,
&gt;&gt;a GUI based set of training wheels that will ease me into learning
&gt;&gt;Troff?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;No, that's really the wrong way to go.  I don't like LyX for some of
&gt;the same reasons I don't like OpenOffice: it hides things from you.
&gt;
&gt;The good news is that troff is much easier than TeX.  Also, you can
&gt;get the definitive book, by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty, at
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.alltel.net/~kollar/utp/.">http://www.alltel.net/~kollar/utp/.</A>
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Is Troff a good tool to use, or has it been improved upon by another
&gt;&gt;Unix tool?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;troff is considered obsolescent.  I use it because it works and I can
&gt;do the things that I want with it.  The modern "replacement" is SGML,
&gt;usually with the DocBook DTD, but it's a bit like a straitjacket.  I'm
&gt;beginning to think that it's a step in the wrong direction.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;P.S. What do you edit your web pages with?
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Emacs.
&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;
&gt;&gt;How do you get it to have the look it has?  It uses the white space
&gt;&gt;very well.
&gt;&gt;    
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Are you talking about the source or the finished page?  I don't think
&gt;my pages look particularly good, but the source is easier to read,
&gt;which is important because that's what I edit.  After editing it, I
&gt;pass it through the W3 Consortium's HTML tidy program, which reformats
&gt;it and also validates the HTML.  I used to have lots of syntax errors
&gt;in the HTML, which typically didn't make any difference for most
&gt;people, but which did very strange things to some people on occasion.
