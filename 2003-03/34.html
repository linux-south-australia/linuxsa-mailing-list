Alan,
&gt;These are just a few comments/queries on IPv6 for linux.
&gt;Seeing as it's Saturday night, why not...
Why not - the cricket was interesting up to about 1ish.

&gt;Sometimes some people on this list do mention the possibility
&gt;of using IPv6 on their linux box - particularly connecting
&gt;up to the 6bone or some such IPv6 backbone.

I WANT TO DO THIS. Time is my enemy atm. Also fart assing about with
distros for lack of anything better to do. I also want to bring in the MS
based pc's into the picture too. 

&gt;What prompted my query is this little news item:
&gt;<A HREF="http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID">http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID</A>=7400069

HAHA - They'll never give up trying to change the world Bill is No 1 again
in Forbes list 
&gt;
&gt;When I tried a couple of years ago to determine how to connect
&gt;up to the 6bone in Adelaide or some such network, I couldn't easily
&gt;work out how to do it.
&gt;I'd be interested to know if there are people using it in earnest.

I plan on doing this once I get off my ass and manage to enrol at uni as my
work will be on ipv6 and there will be a means for me to hook into 6bone.

&gt;But it makes me think that IPv6 is not yet mainstream.

Wouldn't it be nice if our friendly local ISP offered a hook into 6bone via
our DSL connections? :D

&gt;Recently there was an announcement of this IPv6 version of Slashdot:
&gt;<A HREF="http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/">http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/</A>
I also heard this and was informed you need ipv6 running to resolve to it.

&gt;I can't even get my DNS to translate this to anything sensible.
&gt;(It's a CNAME to some undefined domain name apparently.)
&gt;This seems to suggest that to get IPv6 going, there are many tasks
&gt;along the way:
&gt;1	Get IPv6 to go over my Internet connection.
&gt;2	Get IPv6 going in my DNS.
&gt;3	Get an IPv6 gateway to connect to with IPv6-inIPv4 encapsulation.
&gt;
&gt;I guess 1 and 3 are alternatives.
I think 3 is more likely as that is going in a lot of places.

&gt;But I can't even get IPv6 going from one end of my home office to the other.
at least you have it running.

I'd be more than interested in any local developments people have done and
a lot of the nitty gritty stuff like distro used their war stories etc. 

Has ipv6 @ home been covered in LinuxSA user meetings? Should it be?


Regards
Evan
