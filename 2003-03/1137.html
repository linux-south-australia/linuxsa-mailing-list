Oh, right. Thanks for pointing that out. I've had no contact with Macs
for years, and I'd never have guessed that OS X was actually BSD.
Although I think it was someone on this list who said that in this
context - ie. hiding low-down-and-dirties from the user - OS X is
still "very much a Mac OS".

&gt; Remapping won't help because this is the most keyboard intensive 
&gt; machine I've ever used. Holding down 3 or 4 keys at the same time is a 
&gt; fairly common event.

What musical instruments do you play? :-)

Hmmm... if you have 6 IBM keyboards... maybe take a couple of them
apart, and fit a couple of keyswitches from one in the gaps between
the Control and Alt keys. Then buy a squidgeboard with "Windows keys"
and swap its microcontroller into the modified IBM. Compare the key
matrix layouts, modify if necessary and connect in the two new keys.

&gt; I love it... I learned Wordstar purely because of its extensive 
&gt; keyboard contortions, but it unfortunately means that the command key 
&gt; is one of the most used buttons on the Mac.

Right... by the way, why does a cloverleaf motorway interchange mean
"command"? :-)
