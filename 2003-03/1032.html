Hi Russell,

You did some work for Hallmark a few years ago didn't you ?.

&gt; OK, I officially don't understand what the difference between this
&gt; functionality and a packet sniffing tool like tcpdump or ethereal in
&gt; promiscuous mode is... Anyone care to enlighten me?

The kernel places limits on how big it's internal linked lists
can grow (the sk_buff struct that queues frame data for the upper
network levels to process). This limit is normally very small (see
/proc/sys/net/core/hot_list_length and
/proc/sys/net/core/netdev_max_backlog).

A 300 or 128 sk_buff size limit is too small, because as soon as the
user space monitoring program is starved of CPU (ie VM swap, or when a
hacker ping floods machine), it will drop most of them.

You could increase this size, but, the sk_buff facility uses kmalloc(),
and you don't really want to use alot of this space as it can be
unreliable in large qualities, plus it's uncertain what the kernel would
do (behave) if i started using it for things it's wasn't designed for.

Due to billing, and to get the exact events that happen on our networks,
i was easier for me to modify the kernel and add the facility i wanted.
It was very easy to do. So that at the network layer, cut down versions
of the IP header and contents would be stored in a circular queue (60000
entries). This size buffers most adverse events and all packets are
accounted for.

Accept for the occasional time when iptrk does an archive, the VM and FS
operations will starve the iptrk program of CPU, and it won't be able to
pull all the packets from the queue, and hence queue will overflow, but
this is rare and happens in a short interval (once a week if you are
lucky). Also, iptrk will tell you how often this overflows occur so you
can either upgrade the hardware, segment the network, or increase queue
size.

Hope that helps ;).
