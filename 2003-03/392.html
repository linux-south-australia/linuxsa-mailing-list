&gt;I want to investigate how to build a own domain name and handle emails in that name for our project. I have an offer of space on a site with a fixed IP. What do I do now?
&gt;
&gt;Go Daddy tells me the name is available and they can do it for US$8.95 a year - it is in the .net domains.
&gt;
&gt;Now what do I need to do? Anybody do this domain/email address stuff for free?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,  Ian

Hi Ian,

Just wanted to let you know what I did to get my own domain name, 
www.linuxtax.com,  and to receive emails, etc.

Basically, after you pay for your domain name, they will ask you what IP 
address the domain name is for.

There is some "[1]big Internet god in the sky" that keeps a big list of 
domain names and the numbers associated with the names. The guy you give 
your US $8.95 to, will submit your name and associated number to the 
"big Internet god in the sky" so his list is up to date.

Periodically, your ISP will download the list from the  "big Internet 
god in the sky" and store their own list of domain names and ip numbrs 
associated with them, and this list will include your domain name and ip 
number.

When someone types your web address into their browser, your isp sends 
the name "www.Ian's-site.com" to its domain name server and it will look 
up the ip number associated with the domain name submitted.   Then the 
browser is directed to your web page. Same for email.


[2] As an example,  take a look at your /etc/hosts file.  

If you made an entry to it that read:

66.187.232.56   microsoft.com

If someone went to microsoft.com from that machine, they would get the 
Red Hat home page.

In effect,  you would be overriding the DNS information provided by your 
ISP.


************************************************************************

So I think that all you have to really do is set up email accounts and a 
web page on a box where the fixed IP is located.

HTH,

James Leone







[1] I don't know how this works exactly, but that's not material now...

[2] I did this as a gag once.   :-D
