Problem with WEP is basically a naive usage of RC4.  RC4 has an issue with 
certain key values that means you should skip the first X bytes (X dependant 
on keylength).  WEP doesn't do this for some reason.   This is made worse by 
the fact that the IV is 24bits and basically for certain values of the IV 
the key is weak.  (Basically for certain values of the IV the keystream will 
leak certain values of the key at a certain probability level).

RC4 would have been fine except for that and using an IV of 32bits.

Also, shared, unchanging keys aren't a good idea as they're too hard to 
change.  The keys ideally should be per session, per user and rotating 
within the session.

There are various standards efforts to improve this which will address these 
issues without having to add IPSEC ontop as well.  WPA (WiFI Alliance 
Protected Access) will be around late this year early next in 802.11i

Cisco have LEAP and other support things like EAP, EAP-TLS etc

&gt; &gt; Re  b) and c) I have no idea about how it is done. I ask techies to
&gt; &gt; answer questions like that, my job is to roll out the BS &lt;G&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; You are facing the classic security "problem". Namely how "secure" do
&gt; you want the system to be in the forseeable future. Some algorithms (eg.
&gt; IDEA) claim that they are so secure, with large enough keys, that it
&gt; would take longer than the Universe would exist to break them using an
&gt; automated brute force cracking mechanism with current techniques and
&gt; hardware.
&gt; 
&gt; However, this introduces another problem. This makes it more likely that
&gt; social engineering, or the thugs, become a more believable option. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is possible to make anything secure against anyone except the most
&gt; hardened attacker (who I tend to consider to be people like ASIO, the
&gt; CIA, the NSA, MI# and so forth)...
&gt; 
&gt; Just remember one thing - if it's so secure that it's not USEABLE it's
&gt; not USEABLE. And an unuseable system is NOT secure - it's either useless
&gt; or someone will eventually work out how to break the security.
