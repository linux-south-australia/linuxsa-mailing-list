&gt; &gt; Redhat Network has them.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, but do the local mirrors?

No..  because Redhat has not released them to mirrors yet. Or they released
them after the updates happened. (our mirror servers autoupdate daily)

Redhat network usually has stuff out earlier than the mirror distributions.


FYI here is the Redhat Network Alert:

Red Hat Network has determined that the following advisory is applicable to

Security Advisory - RHSA-2003:073-06
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
Summary:
Updated sendmail packages fix critical security issues

Updated Sendmail packages are available to fix a vulnerability that
may allow remote attackers to gain root privileges by sending a
carefully crafted message.

These packages also fix a security bug if sendmail is configured to use
smrsh.

Description:
Sendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) which is included
in all Red Hat Linux distributions.

During a code audit of Sendmail by ISS, a critical vulnerability was
uncovered that affects unpatched versions of Sendmail prior to version
8.12.8.  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message
which, when processed by sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be
executed as root.

We are advised that a proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist, but
is not believed to be in the wild.

Since this is a message-based vulnerability, MTAs other than Sendmail
may pass on the carefully crafted message.  This means that unpatched
versions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if
they do not accept external connections directly.

In addition, the restricted shell (SMRSH) in Sendmail  allows attackers to
bypass the intended restrictions of smrsh by inserting additional commands
after "||" sequences or "/" characters, which are not properly filtered or
verified.  A sucessful attack would allow an attacker who has a local
account on a system which has explicitly enabled smrsh to execute arbitrary
binaries as themselves by utilizing their .forward file.

All users are advised to update to these erratum packages.  For Red Hat
Linux 8.0 we have included Sendmail version 8.12.8 which is not vulnerable
to these issues.  For all other distributions we have included a backported
patch which corrects these vulnerabilities.

Red Hat would like to thank Eric Allman for his assistance with this
vulnerability.
