&gt; Has anyone figured out what things you have to worry about
&gt; when you compile a kernel on one machine and then install it
&gt; to another machine?
&gt; 
&gt; My scenario is this:
&gt; 
&gt; -	I build kernel 2.4.20 on a fast machine A - well, fast by
&gt; 	my standards. The .config file is chosen to be appropriate to
&gt; 	machine B, which is about 6 times slower.
&gt; 
&gt; -	Then I want to install the kernel on very slow machine B.
&gt; 	It's easy enough to ssh the bzImage file and System.map
&gt; 	file to /boot on machine B.
&gt; 
&gt; The kind of problems I'm thinking of are:
&gt; 
&gt; -	The kernel image might not be quite right for the CPU on machine B,
&gt; 	even though I've indicated the right CPU type in the
&gt; 	.config file. Machine A has an Intel P3/933. 
&gt; 	Machine B has a mobile pentium MMX/300. (It _is_ 6 times slower!)

I appreciate your apprehension, but I think it is groundless.

&gt; -	The "make modules_install" doesn't go to the right place.
&gt; 	I'd have to ssh the files across from A to B somehow.

I would install them to a temporary directory, make a tarball of it
then unpack the tarball in /lib/modules/2.4.20 on machine B.

&gt; -	In the directory /lib/modules/2.4.20 on machine B, when I do
&gt; 	compile the kernel on B, there's this symbolic link:
&gt; 	
&gt; 	build -&gt; /usr/src/linux-2.4.20
&gt; 
&gt; 	This makes me suspicious that the modules will not work in practice
&gt; 	without the kernel source being there on machine B.

This is partly true; you don't need the whole source, just the
headers. I think it would work to make a tarball of all the .h files
in /usr/src/linux-2.4.20 on machine A, then unpack said tarball on
machine B.

&gt; I've been reading the documentation, and so far there's nothing much
&gt; enlightening. 
&gt; What would have been useful would have been some sort of 
&gt; "make remote_modules_install" Makefile target.
&gt; There's clearly no such thing in the kernel Makefile,
&gt; although it can be forced to go to a directory other than /lib/modules.
&gt; 
&gt; My purpose in all of this is, of course, to be able to do quick
&gt; re-makes of the kernel on one machine, and then install the kernel
&gt; onto the slower machine.
&gt; 
&gt; Yes I realise that I could just do "make modules_install" on machine A
&gt; to a non-standard temporary directory and then do a recursive ssh
&gt; and "see what happens", but I'm sure that someone out there can tell me
&gt; if there is a standard way of doing this task. I like standards!

&lt;PLUG&gt;Install Debian... it's called "make-kpkg" - it makes it a doddle to
create Debian packages containing your custom kernels. You then copy
the custom package to the target machine and issue one command to
install it.&lt;/PLUG&gt;
