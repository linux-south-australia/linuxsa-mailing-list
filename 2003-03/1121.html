I have been a little critical of smoothwall during their anti-GPL crusade 
of the past.
So now I will give them some credit where credit is due.
Below is an article from their news link at smoothwall.org.

Friday 28th February 2003
Over the last two years SmoothWall and it's supporters have donated sums of 
money for using GPL versions of SmoothWall products to two charities; the 
Dorothy Miles Cultural Centre — a charity supporting deaf and hard of 
hearing children — and since November 2001, the Free Software Foundation. 
Following discussions with the executive and the donations team at the Free 
Software Foundation this week, it has been decided to increase our funding 
support with immediate effect. As a company, SmoothWall Ltd is making a 
second donation, and hope to follow this over the following calendar months 
with significant funding sums via the new GPL 2.0 product, which we will be 
releasing in May. Thanks to Bradley Kuhn, RMS and Ravi at the FSF for their 
continued support of our work, and to Dr Eben Moglen for his support on the 
GPL stance we've taken with several ADSL equipment manufacturers. We hope 
SmoothWall GPL can provide funding to the FSF for many years to come. This 
is a first for any GNU/Linux project to act as an financial incubator for 
other projects and resources in the Free Software community. We hope other 
projects follow "
