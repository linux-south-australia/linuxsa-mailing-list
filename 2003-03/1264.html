Hi

First let me introduce myself as I'm new to the list.  I'm 24 and a
programmer at Stratco.  I finished a Bsc of Comp. Science at Flinders Uni in
1999 and am a keen Linux user ;-)

I do apologise coming straight in and asking a question, but it is very
important to me and is quite urgent:


In late February I bought a Toshiba 1110 laptop.  Right from the beginning I
noticed the hard drive would spin down every now and then after only 30
seconds of inactivity.  I didn't pay enough attention to this early on as I
was focused on the regularly crashing ATi Mobility Radeon M6 drivers
(beware, this chipset is awful).

Despite all the Power Management settings in WinXP being set to Never spin
the drive down, every day or two the HDD would spin down after just 30
seconds of inactivity, over and over again.  Nothing would make it stop
doing this, and it didn't matter whether the laptop was running on battery
or AC power.  Sure, the drive spins back up again when accessed but this
introduces a 2 second delay that stops whatever the PC is doing (including
playing DVDs).  It also can't be doing much good for the drive itself.

I returned the laptop to Harvey Norman on the 8th of March with the crashing
drivers and spinning down HDD problem.  It went down to BMS Technology who
claimed they saw the fault and fixed it (despite the service report saying
_no fault found_).  I got the laptop back on the 20th and was dismayed that
the HDD spinning down fault was still there.  At this stage I decided to
deal with Simon Glassenbury at BMS Technology personally, instead of playing
Chinese Whispers with Harvey Norman.  Simon is the main technician who takes
care of Toshibas at BMS.  He has so far been courteous and professional in
his dealings with me.

Simon agreed that this is a problem and should be fixed (March 21), but
later when he consulted with the technicians in Sydney (March 28) they said
the constantly spinning down HDD is a _standard feature_ on all Toshiba
laptops.  This doesn't make any sense.  Why would the laptop make the HDD
spin down so often, especially when running on AC power?  To make sure, I
grabbed the Intel Application Accelerator utility and modified the Advanced
Power Management settings in the HDD itself (this made no difference).  Thus
I'm sure it's not a software setting anywhere causing the problem.

A friend recently relayed to me the information that his cousin had the same
HDD problem on his Toshiba and managed to get a refund.  Toshiba phone tech
support in Australia said "that's the first I've heard of it" and Toshiba
USA agreed on their forums that it is a fault.

Has anyone else experienced this on their Toshiba laptop?  (or another
laptop which uses Toshiba drives, such as Dell?)  Does anyone think this is
a 'standard feature' to keep spinning down the drive even when not requested
to?  There are no PM settings in the BIOS either.

I will install Linux on this machine if (when?) it's running properly.  If I
install it now Toshiba will just blame Linux for the problems and leave it
at that.  I'm deliberatly using their WinXP setup with almost no third party
software installed.

Any thoughts?

THank you,
