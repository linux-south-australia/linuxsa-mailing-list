  Bill Gates dies.

 Well, Bill,"  said God, "I'm really confused on this one.
 I'm not sure  whether to send you to Heaven or Hell! After all, you
 helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost  every
 home in  the world, and yet you created that ghastly Windows.

 I'm going to do something I've never done before.  I'm going to let
 you decide where you want to go! You can take a peek at both places
 briefly if it will help you decide. Shall we look at Hell first?"

 "Sure!" said Bill. "Let's  go!"

 Bill was amazed!  He saw a clean, white sandy beach with clear
 waters. There   were thousands  of beautiful women running around,
 playing in the water,   laughing and frolicking about. ..
 The sun was shining and the temperature was perfect!

 Bill  said, "This is great! If this is Hell, I can't wait to see
 Heaven!" To which God replied, "Let's go!" and off they went.

 Bill saw puffy white clouds in a beautiful blue  sky with angels
 drifting about playing harps and singing.  It was nice, but surely
 not as enticing as hell.

 Mr. Gates thought for only a brief moment and rendered his decision.

 "God, I do believe I would like to go to Hell."

 "As you desire", said God.

 Two weeks later, God decided to check up on the late billionaire to
 see how things were going.

 He found Bill shackled to a wall, screaming among the hot flames in a
 dark cave.He was being burned and tortured by demons.

 "How ya doin', Bill?  asked God.

 Bill responded with anguish and despair. "This is  awful!  This is
 not what   I expected at all! What happened to the beach and the
 beautiful women playing  in the water?"

 Oh, THAT!" said God.
 "That was the  screen saver."
