Had a very pleasant win with Wine last night.
Studying Mech. Engineering @ TAFE and one of my current subjects is 
Finite Element Analysis.
TAFE supplied me with a demo version of Strand7 
<A HREF="http://www.strand.aust.com/strand7/">http://www.strand.aust.com/strand7/</A>
which we are supposed to install at home to increase our familiarity.
Got home and thought "well, I'll try it with Wine first 'coz I don't 
really want to re-boot into Window$"
... and guess what.... it installed and ran beautifully.
It's a touch slower than running under native windows but very useable, 
the highlight was the stability, it's a bit flakey while running under 
win98 with the odd lockup and wierd errors popping up occasionally 
requiring a restart, but under wine it seems (fingers crossed) rock solid.
So there is some excellent news for aspiring engineers who love the penguin.

"Wine.... a better Window$ than Window$"

Cheers,
DBC
