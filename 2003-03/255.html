Hi all, slight problem.

My manager and I have been working to implement a Samba environment to
replace our Windows domain.  So far everything's been rippa!

Until I received this "Back-out" email this morning.  You can see my
rebuttle.  I seriously do not want to lose this project, because I don't
want to shrivel up and die as an NT Admin for the rest of my life.

It's extremely long winded.  I wanted to *PROVE* everything I could.
Before I send this off, can I please get some feedback, corrections,
additions and amendments? :)

&gt; Adam,
&gt; After much thought I realised I approved the usage of FreeBSD for you and no
&gt; other reason. We have been, are, and probably always will be a Microsoft
&gt; house.

This is all very sudden.  While we may be a 'Microsoft house,' I don't
believe that's necessarily relevant when it comes to our network
Administration.  The server-side network is in place to provide a front-end
to services for the clients.  As long as a client can plug in, and do what
he or she needs to do, it does not matter what is running on the back-end.

I had chosen Samba as a server choice because, while not having used
Linux or FreeBSD actively up until about a year ago, I was always keeping
my head in.  I knew that, while seen by some as the 'baby' of the server
market, it will grow into the Einstein.

I've been a member of the LinuxSA mailing list for the last four years.
The only reason it took me up until last year to begin experimenting with
Unix was for two reasons:

a)  I was comfortable with what I knew, ie. Windows
b)  Linux was overwhelming to me, and seemed a little overcomplicated for
    my liking.

I had still wanted to get to know it, and that's why I teamed up with one
of my friends to help me Fasttrack into getting to know it.  Ever since
doing that, I've seen how powerful it actually is.  Everything Microsoft
has released, Unix has either released prior, or has a technology that is
equally as powerful.  Microsoft often copies Unix technology, and Unix
often copies Microsoft technology.

Were you aware that the original TCP/IP stack in Microsoft Windows NT was
written by Berkley Software Distribution, a company who are now better
known for releasing their Open Source product, FreeBSD.  It wasn't until
Microsoft realized they were violating the BSD License by closing their
source code, that they rewrote the TCP/IP code in-house.

Unix has been around for 30 years.  It was never developed for the desktop
until the last few years, and it was certainly never pushed like Microsoft
have with their products.  In terms of age, Unix is superior to Microsoft.

Now that I have come to get to know FreeBSD better, I am much more
comfortable using it.  I even now write scripts to help me automate my
work, and I know how to begin troubleshooting problems as they arise.  When
I can't answer a question, I use the LinuxSA mailing list, or the advice of
those around me.

Even now, I use X running Gnome2 on FreeBSD as my workstation.  I only ever
boot back into Windows when I absolutely *have* to.

&gt; It doesn't make sense when we have all these expertise in-house to
&gt; move away from what we know and love.

I don't know about 'love.' :)  In the time that I've moved further towards
Unix and away from Windows, I've learned just how much easier the
environment is to work with.  Unix is a complicated place, and you have to
have more than blonde hair to use it.  Unix is a powerhouse.  It's full of
tools that Bill Gates never even thought of.  Once I started using FreeBSD
and learning more and more about the contents of that /bin directory, I
began to start realizing exactly what I would be able to do with it.

The software development team is used to using Windows, and granted they
develop using it, however this is not relevant when it comes to
administering the network.  If they require a service that runs on Windows,
that's why in our plan, we made room for a Windows server.

Take a look at this:

[<A HREF="mailto:bugman@jerome">bugman@jerome</A> /home/bugman]$ uptime
 9:33AM  up 126 days, 13:14, 2 users, load averages: 0.08, 0.13, 0.06

Jerome, our web server, providing 75% of services to our network, has been
online for 126 days without failing.  I have hardly even had to touch it in
the last six months.  I believe it has been rebooted once.  It's just
cruised on by all on its own without any major intervention from me.

Megatron, running PRONTO, was online for 176 days before I rebooted it two
weeks ago.  In that time, it had only had one fault with it, a fault which
I have since repaired.  Grouchy fell over about once a week.  It required
constant rebooting, and all it was doing was running PRONTO.

&gt; I have no dispute FreeBSD may be
&gt; technically superior, faster, more flexible

Do I need to say any more? :-)

&gt; but I would still have to live
&gt; with the fact if you left the company I would have to find someone with the
&gt; expertise to manage the system.

If I left the company, you'd be able to re-hire my position like *snap* &lt;--
That.  I'll even tell you how ;)  Post a job vacancy on the LinuxSA mailing
list (<A HREF="http://www.linuxsa.org.au">http://www.linuxsa.org.au</A>) telling them that a Unix/NT Systems
Administration position has become available, and you'll get dozens of
skilled applicants.  They're all looking for the job I'm lucky to have.

&gt; I also don't believe FreeBSD can keep up
&gt; with Microsoft and its technologies which could restrict us in the future,
&gt; especially with .NET style products on the market.

There is no reason that .NET products can't still be supported.  So far
there has been no evidence of a market shift towards this "technology," and
it will probably end up being another Microsoft Passport.

While that is my opinion, you do raise a point, but again I believe each
server we provide here should be tailored to meet it's requirements.  Why
did we move PRONTO from Windows NT to Red Hat Linux?  We moved it because
we'd heard, mind you, heard, that it outperformed Windows by a long shot.
Upon doing so, we haven't regretted it since.  I certainly haven't.  I have
only needed to do maintenance to that server once in the time it's been
online.

If it were so far ahead, why is it always Windows that crashes, Windows
that doesn't give you useable output, or Windows that just plain doesn't
work, or Windows that requires manual intervention all the time?

Unix has got heaps of developments going on, the XFS file system, which
supports journalling and ACLs, CODA, which transports only parts of files
which have changed, so that your overall network traffic is reduced.  I
won't bore you with more examples, but I believe that statement to be
untrue.

Windows, by default, can't even rotate its own error logs.  You have to do
that manually.

Windows, by default, can't send out emails, or allow users on the system to
communicate.

Windows, by default, is an insecure operating system that opens itself up
to the world, instead of opening up only those services that are required.

Windows is still juggling around 16bit/32bit environments.  I can't believe
we're still dealing with NT Virtual DOS Machine environments.

Windows, by default, does not integrate its command prompt system and it's
gui very well at all.  You can't develop much for it.  It has all sorts of
weird different environments going all at once -- the GUI environment, with
an application with buttons and menus; the vbs environment, where a script
executes and uses Windows API's and other connectivity to get information
out of Windows; the command environment, where you are extremely limited in
the way you can script information, and extremely limited in the kind of
information you can get out.

&gt; We are spending a lot of
&gt; time and effort trying to mimic a Windows domain when we can have the real
&gt; thing.

Samba isn't about mimicing a Windows domain.  It's about providing a server
interface to Windows clients using the smb protocol.  Windows rules the
desktop.  As such it is clearly obvious that some sort of integration is
necessary when trying to serve Windows clients.  In comes Samba.

One of the reasons Samba may be one step behind integrating itself with
Windows is that Windows is completely closed source.  Samba has been
developed by reverse engineering the way Windows communicates, and because
it has been so strong on the market for so long, it has proven itself to be
strong, robust and flexible.

I have set up a Samba Domain environment on FreeBSD which allows users to
authenticate, share files, and maintain permissions.  If I wished, I could
add on printing to that.  I had decided not to pursue that avenue at this
point, because I did not want to lose my automated printer installation
program from the Intranet.  That's a function that IIS provides that I
adapted into.

&gt; I know you will find this disappointing but I know this is the right
&gt; decision and will be able to sleep again at night.

Administering Windows was why I didn't sleep at night.  I believe it would
be reason enough for an employee's manager, however afraid of how his
systems are running in an alien environment, to sleep at night knowing his
IT Officer is sleeping properly.  I'd be more worried if he was the one
tossing and turning.

I'd like to finish off with a few additional points if I may:

Our Intranet
------------

Jerome, which is running FreeBSD 4.7, has proven itself.

Apache:  Serving our Intranet.  Running php, I have an extraordinary amount
of power at my fingertips.  PHP is another skill I have picked up in the
last 12 months.  It's been a wonderful tool and at this stage I think it is
one of the more endeering features of the Intranet, however server-side it
may be.  It automates a lot more than I ever could have done without it.

If you have a look at the Intranet's "Fax Resource" page, it will show you,
live, the last 50 faxes that were sent, the current status of the network
fax, and throw some statistics at you.  They're all done automatically, and
I never have to touch them again.

One of the reasons that is so wonderful for me, is that Unix works on the
principle of stdin and stdout.  Windows does too, but because Windows runs
"services,"  uses an "Event Log," configures objects via the GUI and a
registry, I can't integrate other systems in with it easily.  As for that
page, I just had PHP collect the information I needed to provide, and
present it on screen.  I can look in on my entire network by way of this.
I was hoping to implement this kind of functionality once FreeBSD was in
place permanently.



Network Faxing:  A system automated by open source.  Had it not been for
the code, I would be restricted to using a product the way it was designed.
Fortunately for me, I was able to edit the scripts that Hylafax uses
and add a backup sequence to the script which meant that any faxes were not
only emailed to reception, but were also dumped up on the Intranet.  I have
the power and the flexibility to do whatever I want.

I adapted the technology of that script, and created a PDF Printer.  Users
can now, without installing additional software onto their computers, print
a PDF document that is automatically emailed back to them.  The script is
simple:  I set up a printer using Samba on jerome, and configured it to
execute a script when a job was spooled.  The PDF Printer takes the
PostScript file, converts it with a utility called ps2pdf, which is a
native utility to FreeBSD.

(Funny how FreeBSD just has all the tools you require day to day as a part
of a standard installation.. eh?  POWER!!)

So I wrote a script that generated the correct headers to compose an email,
converted the PostScript file to PDF, encoded it as a MIME attachment, and
added it to the email i was creating.  I then completed the email, and
piped all that I had generated into sendmail.  Sendmail then sends the
attachment out to the originating user, who's username was supplied by
Samba.

It took me less than a day to write it.  On Windows, I'd have to deploy a
'free' PDF printer from the Internet, or the Acrobat software on *every*
client.  With this system, a user can install this printer straight over
the Intranet, and I never ever have to answer a question about creating a
PDF document ever again.  Ever.


DNS / DHCP:  Ah but of course, the tools which hold our network together.
Set up almost a year ago, never touched since :-)

Squid:  The Open Source Proxy software.  And has this been a brilliant
investment (of $0) or what!  Since we have implemented a proxy server, I
have seen a significant increase in speed.  There are currently 3.7Gb of
cached files stored on our server, and that means any clients within our
network who use websites frequently will get much faster access to those
frequently requested pages/graphics.  I can run squid reports, and in fact,
I do, and I can see exactly who used what, when.  I've turned squid on
once, and never, ever touched it since.

E-Mail:  Native, of course!  Unlike Windows, Unix has the ability to send
emails out automatically!  That means a script that I write can generate an
email, and send it out from *any* of my servers directly.  It wouldn't have
to try and interface and authenticate with an external SMTP server or
anything like that.  It just works.

RRDTool:  Let me collect information from programatical output.  EG!

        NUMS=`users | wc -w | sed 's/\ //g'`

Set the variable $NUMS for the output of `command`.

users:  lists the users on the system, pipe it through wc, which is a
utility that counts the number of words you put through it (you can't just
*do* that on Windows.)  Pipe *that* through sed, which is a text parser.
sed in this case is getting rid of the spaces, because 'wc' had left some
spaces at the beginning.  The result of this is a number.  I can now pump
that into the database and hey presto!  I can generate a graph.

Windows just doesn't make a job like that pleasant.



I know you said you understand the power of FreeBSD, and I just felt the
need to prove it.  Millions of people are using Unix from day to day, and
every one of them would go back to Windows if it wasn't worth hanging on
to.  The things I've illustrated above excite me.  They excite me a lot
more than clicking in the Microsoft management console and managing some
system.  Unix is what makes my job fun, flexible, and automated.  Windows
makes my job clunky, underpowered, and frustrating.

Considering the Samba project has been around for many years, and has been
used by so many people, I can't accept it's dismissal.  I believe that
perhaps because you know me so well, you knew I would come back at you with
a response like this one.  I'm hoping it's enough to help you reconsider
your decision.  You're a software developer who's been using the Windows
platform for a long time now.  If you dug your head around Unix you'd
understand what I'm talking about and why I get so excited about it :)

I believe this company can benefit from the integration of FreeBSD into our
server side systems.  I've seen it happen in the past and I don't want to
stop it.  I want to see this system go forward and I want to see it
succeed!
