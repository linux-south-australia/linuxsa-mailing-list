&gt; I received a few comments on using flash from members of this list, the gist 
&gt; of which is not to use it.
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of open source or not, I find Macromedia software incredibly 
&gt; versatile and useful. In particular flash is an advanced vehicle for 
&gt; presentation of all sorts of Multimedia with minimal file sizes.
&gt; 
&gt; Take a look at this URL, which holds a simple flash menu,
&gt; (it's something I made with Flash 5 recently, however trivial, but useful),
&gt; 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.comstech.com/~slidejam/flash/menuPersonal.html">http://www.comstech.com/~slidejam/flash/menuPersonal.html</A>
&gt; 
&gt; and let me know how you would otherwise achieve this (with equally simple 
&gt; means, let's say we exclude javascript if you can resist).

Just because it's easy, doesn't mean it's right.

As others have said, many people will leave as soon as they see the
flash loading. Even if they have the browser plugin working, there is a
lot of stigma associated with having flash based content. It's often
(rightly or wrongly) associated with a flashy but content-free site.

Worse, if you are using flash for a menu, and don't provide an
alternative for flash-less people to navigate with, then you are
limiting your audience. And you are alienating those of your existing
audience who don't like flash.

Standards are there for a reason. It's your choice whether you want to
adhere to them, but don't be surprised if you loose a good percentage of
your potential visitors.
