&gt;&gt;&gt; This had lead me of course to warchalking, for those who don't know
&gt;&gt;&gt; warchalking is wondering around with a wireless PDA or laptop finding
&gt;&gt;&gt; AP's. Then placing a chalk mark on the sidewalk or wall of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; building with the AP, the mark shows how secure the network is.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wardriving same concept but in a car. Can be done in a light aircraft
&gt;&gt;&gt; too they say.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Nobody warchalks, its a myth.  I've only done it a few times as a
&gt;&gt; joke.. and... lets not go any further :)
&gt;
&gt; maybe noone warchalks here in adelaide or even AU, but in london and
&gt; ney york, little warchlken graffitti were everywhere ...
&gt; i put some there my self occasionally too...
&gt; if only to indicate "this is a consume node thats publically accesable"

Heh, no kidding, cool :-)

I know it definitely doesn't happen in AU, at least not at a serious 
level.

&gt; so, it does happen, maybe adelaide is not populated densely enough for
&gt; you to notice. and yes i have seen warchaliking symbols about the place
&gt; ;)

...wasn't me, honestly :-)

&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's certainly less Airnet hotspots then there were.  I've
&gt;&gt; still managed to pick up over 200 other AP's in the city, though (not
&gt;&gt; counting suburbs).
&gt;
&gt; only 200 =)

Yeah, only 200, but for Adelaide, it's pretty impressive.  Guys in 
Sydney I know have over 3000 AP's on their netstumbler lists, and 
netstumbler sucks (works by broadcasting its own packets, doesnt pickup 
hidden nodes/tunnels).

&gt;&gt; I'll probably be making <A HREF="http://www.wardriving.com.au">http://www.wardriving.com.au</A> live pretty
&gt;&gt; shortly, I had plenty of suggestions to do the latter, but there's no
&gt;&gt; way in hell I would.
&gt;
&gt; and the point behind this site would be?

More of a resource/news site for wardrivers, focusing on both the doing 
it side of things (antennae, software, custom utilties, etc) and 
security for those worried about wardrivers.  It's planned to be a very 
community driven site, just haven't had time to finish off the CMU.

&gt; i would agree with this. but i wouldn't bother with WEP really.
&gt; although WEP is not trivail to break, it can be done if you have
&gt; enough patience and time or a coulpe of 3GHz p4s handy ...

WEP's useless as a security measure, but it stops just anybody 
associating with your AP.  It can be useful.

&gt; IPSec is another alternative, but using IPv6 would foil most
&gt; casual browsers also =) but a real firewall instead of a HW AP
&gt; is certainly the way to go =)

Nod, I loathe HW AP's :-(

&gt; cheers,
