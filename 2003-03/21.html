<H1>IPv6 activity in Adelaide?</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->

These are just a few comments/queries on IPv6 for linux.
Seeing as it's Saturday night, why not...

Sometimes some people on this list do mention the possibility
of using IPv6 on their linux box - particularly connecting
up to the 6bone or some such IPv6 backbone.

My question is whether there are in fact some people here
on linuxSA running IPv6 on linux.

What prompted my query is this little news item:
<A HREF="http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID">http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID</A>=7400069

The above article talks about "Enhancements to IPv6" by the evil one.
I gather they mean enhancements to their _implementation_ of IPv6
rather than the protocol itself. (In the MS world, the distinction
between protocols and software does not exist.)
But if the forces of evil are advancing in IPv6, it makes me think
that the forces of good must get going quick also.
Otherwise "they" _will_ change the protocols.
Enough of philosophy....


When I tried a couple of years ago to determine how to connect
up to the 6bone in Adelaide or some such network, I couldn't easily
work out how to do it.
I'd be interested to know if there are people using it in earnest.

A couple of days ago, I compiled pppd version 2.4.1 from source on
a couple of machines and tried to use the IPv6 features.
But the IPv6 features don't seem to get compiled in by default.
I need to do more homework on this.
But it makes me think that IPv6 is not yet mainstream.

Recently there was an announcement of this IPv6 version of Slashdot:
<A HREF="http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/">http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/</A>
I can't even get my DNS to translate this to anything sensible.
(It's a CNAME to some undefined domain name apparently.)
This seems to suggest that to get IPv6 going, there are many tasks
along the way:
1	Get IPv6 to go over my Internet connection.
2	Get IPv6 going in my DNS.
3	Get an IPv6 gateway to connect to with IPv6-inIPv4 encapsulation.

I guess 1 and 3 are alternatives.
But I can't even get IPv6 going from one end of my home office to the other.

By the way, this is my set of links for IPv6:
<A HREF="http://www.topology.org/comms/ip.html">http://www.topology.org/comms/ip.html</A>#ipv6
I know there's a heap of info out there.
But I was sort of hoping to avoid the hard work and stress which always
occurs when I try to work out something from all the howto documents on the net.
It's always much easier to just ask someone who has got something working
how they did it.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
