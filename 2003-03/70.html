&gt; After browsing through this I read through all the /var entries.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I've read various configuration guides as to how to split
&gt; these file systems across disks/partitions, and I've wondered
&gt; about whether or no to split /var off onto its own disk.
&gt; Especially for a mail server or log server ...
&gt; 
&gt; Some guides say "don't do it", others are fairly vague on the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; So, the question is, what is the experience of the list on this?

Partitioning varies according to machine application.  Which
explains the vagueness -- what is suitable for a machine dedicated
to web or database serving is totally unsuitable for a desktop
machine.

The tradeoffs are
  - ease of administration
  - robustness
  - disk performance
  - platform requirements.

1) Ease of administration

Compare having just / with having /, /home, /var, /var/log, /var/spool,
/home, /usr, ...  In the second case you must size each of the partitions
exactly so that the partitions fill nicely.  You don't want to
repartition the disk because /home is 95% full but /var is 15% full.

So for a machine where ease of administration is important there's
a good argument for just one partition -- / -- and making a swap
file rather than a swap partition.

Linux is increasingly getting tools for resizing of partitions
(LVM, ext2resize, etc), but these are not yet as convenient as
one big partition.  If you going to have multiple partitions,
then using LVM or similar is a good idea -- this might influence
choice of distribution, distribution version and filesystems.

2) Robustness

You can improve robustness by use of partitions.  For example,
you can prevent a mega e-mail or a large file upload or a
process writing thousands of log messages from totally filling
the disk by good use of partitions.

For example, many production servers have /var/log and /var/spool
on their own partitions.  The mail spool might fill, or writing
log messages might fail, but the remainder of the system will
continue to run.

3) Disk performance

Disk I/O is dominated by disk head movement.

The primary objective is to keep disk head movement to a minimum.
On a signle disk machine this argues for one big partition.

It also argues for using the right filesystem for the job.
So you might find using a swap partition or using a journalling
filesystem gives better results.

On a multiple disk system reducing head movement can be done
by looking at the I/O patterns of the application.  For example,
Apache serves a web page and writes a log message.  So the web
pages and the system log should be on different disks -- otherwise
the disk heads are guarrunteed to move for each web request.

On a multiple disk system the secondary objective is to keep
all disks and buses equally busy.  Then your system isn't
constrained by the performance of one heavily used disk or
bus.

This is again done by

  - looking at I/O patterns

  - buying appropiate hardware

     - you'll find high performance machines have lots of disks
       and busses, to minimise applications waiting for disk
       or bus availability

  - using the right RAID mix

     - if you need 2 disks to store your web pages, then using
       striping rather than concatenation automatically shares
       the I/O load across the disks.

These interact somewhat.  For example a RAID5 system issues
simultaneous I/Os to each disk in the RAID5 disk set.  So
those disks should be spread about the buses so bus congestion
is minimised.

4) Platform requirements

The IBM PC is a classic for this.  Old BIOSs can't boot
a operating system image from anywhere on the disk.  This
is fixed by puting all the boot-time data into the /boot
partition and putting that partition in the disk sectors
that the BIOS can address.

Even if you have a new BIOS, there's a robustness argument
for still having a /boot partition (as you can then fix an
issue by dropping the disk into a spare machine and hacking
at it).


My personal preference for a desktop machine is
  - 2 * IDE disk, configured
      ide0 (controller) -- hda (disk, IDE master)
      ide1 (controller) -- hdc (disk, IDE master) -- hdd (cd-rom, IDE secondary)
  - each disk partitioned with
      /boot -- 50MB
      MS-DOS format -- 5MB for BIOS upgrades (in place of floppy)
      swap -- 2 * maximum RAM supported by motherboard
      / -- remaining capacity, ext3 filesystem (xfs when in stock kernel)
  - software RAID to mirror /boot and / partitions, hda as first disk,
    hdc as second
  - swap partitions listed in priority hda, hdc.

Paritions are mounted by disk label, so disks can change
bus order without drama.

I choose not to RAID the swap space, so a disk failure does
interrupt the continued running of the machine but this
is fixed with a reboot (which takes the failed disk off-line).
That seems fine for a desktop machine.  This gives a massive
amount of swap space available to applications on a normally
running system.  Upgrading RAM doesn't require reparitioning
the disk.

My personal preference for a laptop machine is a single disk
with:
  /boot -- 50MB
  MS-DOS format -- 5MB for BIOS upgrades (in place of floppy)
  unused -- whatever your BIOS needs for "suspend to disk"
  swap -- 2 * maximum RAM supported by motherboard
  / -- remaining capacity, ext2 filesystem (ext3 drains batteries)

I run FreeDOS in the MS-DOS partition.  The Dell BIOS updater
seems OK with it.  You might be more cautious and use MS-DOS.
If you have a floppy disk or if your PC boots from a USB
storage device you can do without this.

&gt; Is there a good reason not to split /var onto its own disk from
&gt; the root volume? Like it needs to be mounted at boot time for
&gt; XXX reason.

The rules for booting are

  - the files needed to load the image file containing the
    Linux kernel are in /boot.

  - once the image is started, the files need to boot the
    Linux kernel are in /*, /etc, /bin, /sbin, /lib.  Nothing
    in the directories /usr, /var, /opt, /home is needed.

    This is why the shell is the file /bin/sh but the C
    compiler is in /usr/bin/cc.  There's a hack (see dmesg)
    so that errors which occur during kernel boot are written
    to the log file /var/log/messages later on.

  - once the Linux kernel is booted the init system is started.
    This looks in /etc/inittab for its configuration, which
    mentions the system startup scripts.

    Those scripts mount the partitions in /etc/fstab
    (including the partitions containing directories /usr, /var,
    etc) and then run the application startup scripts in
    /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S* (if init is booting to run level 5).

The fileysystem layout rules are a lot less vague then mentioned
here -- search Google for "linux fhs" and "linux standard base".
You can generally trust applications to follow the rules with two
exceptions:

  - trying to make / read-only after system startup.  Some
    applications write to /etc rather than /var.

  - puting files in /usr rather than in /opt.  In theory
    distributions put files in /usr and third-party applications
    put files in /opt.  In practice, everthing ends up in /usr.
    Suggests that /usr and /opt should be on the same
    partition.
