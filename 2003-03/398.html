I don't think its too bad (please correct me if if i've overlooked a
posability). Your allowing any local user to make a connection to your X
server, so different processes under different usernames can display
stuff I suppose. If you still check that all connections are coming from
your server then theres nothing remote people can do. All the local
users can do is really run an x program, which is probably only a minor
annoyance. Attackers I guess would need to find a way to get a shell,
then use the more lax access controls together with some other bug like
one of the xterm title bar buffer over flows or something. So, as usual,
you can never be 100% sure your safe, but I wouldn't be too worried.

&gt; Greetings Peoples,
&gt; Have a SUN Server running Oracle 9iAS witch has a Java service component. 
&gt; According to our DBA guys, there is a bug in SUN/Oracles code that means 
&gt; that the service doesn't run properly with properly unless the command xhost 
&gt; + is run. I can get into Oracle's metalink to check this, but it fixed the 
&gt; problem on the server I was running this on when I ran "xhost + mincepie" 
&gt; (mincepie being the server name). 
&gt; 
&gt; What I am wondering is at what risk does this place the server. The network  
&gt; is private and firewalled, so there is no access from the big bad Internet 
&gt; (tm). As I understand the XHost command, you must have access to the server 
&gt; to take advantage of this. 
&gt; 
&gt; My questions would be:
&gt; What security risk does this place to the server from users, if any (and if 
&gt; it does, how might they take advantage of this so I can block it) ?
&gt; What security risk does this place the server at from non users (ie people 
&gt; who might be scanning the network or something) ?
&gt; Is there a way I can start the service without running Xhost ? 
&gt; 
&gt; Much thanks in advance.
