&gt;&gt; Were you aware that the original TCP/IP stack in Microsoft Windows NT was

&gt;&gt; Microsoft realized they were violating the BSD License by closing their

&gt; I don't think anyone pointed out that this was incorrect.  BSD licenses
&gt; don't require you to publish the modified sources code (that's the GPL's
&gt; job).  They only require an acknowledgement which, IIRC, Microsoft abided
&gt; by.

More to the point, it turned out that we were wrong in deducing that
Microsoft based their stack on the BSD implementation.  But nobody has
accused them of license violation.

On the other hand, look at the ftp client that comes with "Windows"
98%, and probably with later versions:

  $ strings -a FTP.EXE | grep Cali
