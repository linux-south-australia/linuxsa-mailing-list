&gt; I have installed and played with Lindows V3.0 (and yes, it's a licenced

&gt;
&gt; To be perfectly honest, apart from its extraordinarily fast
&gt; installation it looks like you get a Debian Sid + KDE 3.1 + Lindows
&gt; Theme.

Haha, it was a joke.  Lindows is terrible, played with 2.0, didn't like 
it at all, and its wine installation was broken, so Windows apps would 
run.

Click'n'Go subscription might be a great idea, but it looks incredibly 
like apt-get with a nice gui interface.  It's a complete marketing 
scam, correct me if I'm wrong, but I sure haven't seen Lindows giving 
*anything* back to the open source community.  At least the commercial 
wine guys (codeweavers, transgaming) do give back a hell of a lot.

Is there going to be a GPL copy of your distrib (I'm assuming you guys 
have finished it now?)... would be interesting to look at.

&gt; I've not tried "click and run", however I'm not sure how this has any
&gt; benefit over installing a tool such as "kpackager" or "synaptic",
&gt; connecting to the Internet and twiddling your thumbs depending on how
&gt; fast your Internet connection is.
&gt;
&gt; And "click'n'run" costs money.
