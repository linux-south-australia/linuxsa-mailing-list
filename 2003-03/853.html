&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;I'm having a problem mounting a usb mass-storage device and am after any help you can offer.
&gt;
&gt;I'm running RH7.3 and using a USB-IDE notebook drive mass-storage device but can't seem to get Linux to mount it properly.
&gt;
&gt;- lsusb shows info about it fine
&gt;- usbview shows info about it fine
&gt;- usbmodules sees it as 'usb-storage'
&gt;- hotplug can be seen running when I plug it in 'on the fly'
&gt;
&gt;I've set the mount type as vfat (it was formatted in Win98) but it still doesn't like it.
&gt;

Hi Chris,

I don't have an explanation, but I can at least verify what you are saying.

A few of my clients have dropped off zip disks with their data on it and 
they didn't work, even though other zip disks worked.

On both occassions I was told that the zip drive was formatted in Windows.

It could be a coincidence, but my guess is that if you had not formatted 
your disk in windows it would work out of the box.

But then again, I could be way off... but if you have an unformatted 
disk, give it a try.

&gt;The device is a Skymaster USB portable hard disk (very handy I might add).
&gt;
&gt;Below is the output of my system startup when it is booted up with the usb device plugged in.
&gt;A similar message is shown when I try to mount the device when it has been hotplugged.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, Win98 found it...hassle free. But I'd like to be able to read data from it without having to boot back into windows.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions?
&gt;Do I need a hotplug script for usb-storage device (I currently only have one for usb_camera - default install)
&gt;Or some sort of firmware for hotplug?
&gt;I can attatch more info from lsusb/usbmodules/usbview if required.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
