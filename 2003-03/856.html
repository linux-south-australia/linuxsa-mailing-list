&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; yeah i realize that, and most of what i listed wasn't specific to KDE, i
&gt; &gt; was quite aware of that...
&gt;
&gt; so why did you claim it to be?

i did?  read my post.
i was claiming that there are a lot of features in the _linux gui_ that were 
not copied from windows.  I later focussed on KDE, as compared to windows, 
but the list i gave did not all relate specifically to KDE (though all of it 
can be demonstrated through using kde) and nor did i claim that it did.


&gt; Nope, but it is pretty close.  If you read my post you'll see I wasn't
&gt; specifically targeting KDE, but Linux desktops in general.  You KDE guys
&gt; get pretty sensitive! :-)

they are like windows because they are all GUIs.  There are a lot of features 
in windows that a lot of people want.  Therefore those features have been 
implemented in kde because of demand (kde is developed by people who use it - 
there is no company behind it saying it must have this and that feature).  
Not all of these features are implemented exactly as in windows, (eg. window 
manager behaviour) some have been improved upon - although many just ignore 
this and say its 'not significant enough to call it innovation'...

i dont think you'll find too many GUIs that aren't like windows in some way.  
dont forget windows 95 wasnt original either.
it would be interesting to know what you use as a desktop.

&gt;
&gt; And from another post:
&gt; &gt; Gnome 2 is nice too....but lacking in features.  I like it and have
&gt; &gt; used it in the past, but i missed kde's rich feature set and groovy
&gt; &gt; eye candy so i switched back again.... (does the 'ability to choose'
&gt; &gt; qualify as 'innovation'?).
&gt;
&gt; Not just sensitive but can't wait for a chance to put down other desktop
&gt; projects.  *sigh*
&gt;

sorry, lets just say it has 'less features than kde' rather than 'lacking in 
features'.  That should make my point clearer.  Actually, this is probably 
the ONLY reason i dont use gnome 2.  gtk2 looks very nice and i used gnome 2 
for some time until i wanted to do something it couldnt do....and so i 
switched back to kde.

&gt; &gt; The basic functionality is very similar but kde has a lot of its own.
&gt;
&gt; KDE, Gnome, Enlightenment all have their own distinctive features, but
&gt; not much is innovation.  A lot is cross-copied.  From all of them.
&gt;

so its not innovation.  big deal.  its copied because its either needed or 
wanted.  just because not _everything_ in the open source world is 
innovation, doesnt mean open source doesnt innovate at all...

had everything in linux been an 'innovation' and every single program did 
things differently, and you had to do everything some new way (because 
innovation often involves a change in the way you do something - see the 
dictionary definition), well linux may well have remained as just a hobby.
It would never have been where it is today.
(even beos, which had some innovation of its own (eg. the file system, BFS), 
failed to get anywhere...)
