Damien,

&gt; From this attack description, it seems you don't even need to break
&gt; the encryption to bypass WEP (but then as Ryan pointed out, you have
&gt; your next level after that).  Would anyone know if the problems
&gt; described in that article have since been fixed?

There are flaws in WEP, we all know that. RC4 has been cracked and so
forth. But WEP does stop the innocent bystander who can accidentally see
stuff he or she is not meant to. Notice that the so called "war drivers"
tend to be technically savvvy...they (we?) are the type of people who
given ANY kind of connection to a network might be able to crack it.

Remember that.

Dump the "WIRELESS" and think "they can connect to my network"...then it
becomes more clear. We're quite happy to put our gateways on the
Internet even though we know they're under constant attack. But more
frightened with wireless. If you apply as much diligence as you would
with an Internet gateway or firewall you'll be fine - if you trust third
parties (such as Microsoft) to do so then it's up to you.

Is it not?
