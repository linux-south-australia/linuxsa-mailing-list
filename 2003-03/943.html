&gt; Hi All..
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently administering a Redhat 7.2 server and generally I keep the
&gt; server up to date with the latest security errata via Redhat's up2date RHN
&gt; service.  Kernels of course don't get upgraded via this service and I do
&gt; this manually from time to time.
&gt; 
&gt; What I would like to know is what philosophy to adopt with kernel upgrades.
&gt; If I upgraded every time Redhat released a new kernel update, I would not
&gt; have uptime extending beyond 20-30 days on average.  Even if I left out the
&gt; "bug fix" kernel upgrades that perhaps don't effect my configuration and
&gt; only upgraded the kernel on security errata, I would still be upgrading
&gt; around once a month, and it's becoming a real nuisance as the server has
&gt; many users and kernel upgrades involve service interruptions.
&gt; 
&gt; What do other system admins do in this situation??  How do other servers
&gt; manage to accrue such massive uptimes but still be kept secure without the
&gt; need to install updated kernels based on newly found security
&gt; vulnerabilities?  Any light anyone can shed on the matter would be most
&gt; appreciated because at the moment I feel like I'm chasing my tail with these
&gt; kernel upgrades and I'm starting to wonder if I'm being "over zealous" with
&gt; the kernel updates?

It depends on the circumstances.

* Most sys admins I know tend to update the kernel by hand and don't
trust binary kernel updates (RedHat's particularly good at justifying
any paranoia we might have).

* Most don't run development kernels on production systems

* Most don't upgrade without an easy way of rolling back the changes

* Most don't do major upgrades without very good reason (ie, 2.2 to 2.4)
and planning/testing.

* Most don't like doing it, because it's one of the few things that can
ruin your uptime :-)
