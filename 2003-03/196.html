Hello All

I would like to appeal to the FreeBSD advocates within the Linuxsa =
group. I am new to FreeBSD. I have had a small amount of contact with =
redhat Linux when I was going through uni. Currently, I am trying to set =
up a home heterogeneous network, and then use these gained skills in my =
workplace. I have been trying to push FreeBSD on to an old 166 for a =
firewall and router, and on a Celeron 1Gb PC, however I've been =
unsuccessful for if it's not one thing it's another. I was wondering (& =
hoping) if there is anyone ( either before a meeting, or at a LAN, or an =
informal group, etc ) that would be willing to physically spend some =
time with me installing FreeBSD 4.7 on my machine? Any experienced =
takers? Please email me, I'm sure we can work something out. I've spent =
a lot of time on these machines already. I've even bought a FreeBSD =
unleashed book. I'm hoping I can be fast tracked by some gurus, and =
continue on my path.

I'm looking forward to your replies & thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Darren
