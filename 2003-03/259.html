&gt; sendmail does the MTA component out of the box, just by fiddling with
&gt; sendmail.mc.  I've looked at Qmail and postfix and both require
&gt; source code fiddling to meet my reasonable requirements.
&gt;
&gt; If you have a more traditional list of requirements then Postfix
&gt; is the better choice.  For large deployments you must configure
&gt; Linux to run 1000s of processes.

Hi Glen,

I'm curious as to how you're defining a 'large deployment'. I have a 
sendmail box and a qmail box each with a large number (&lt; 20,000) mail 
accounts, and virus+spam filtering nearly cripples a 1.6Ghz system with 
the kind of volume required by that many users. It would seem that the 
answer is a 'toaster' style system with multiple front ends for SMTP, 
but sendmail's mbox has a history of being less than ideal over NFS.

The qmail box does tend to have less show-stopper problems than the 
sendmail system, mostly because of the modular nature of qmail. 
Components of qmail can fail without end users noticing that SMTP, POP3 
or IMAP are unavailable, and there are never locking issues on their 
mailboxes!

I'd also be interested to hear how 'ideal' setups from a year ago are 
handling the current volumes of spam. I'm seeing more than twice the 
volume of bounced messages in the queue than the stats showed for 12 
months ago.

Qmail is still less than ideal 
(<A HREF="http://www-dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/~ma/postfix/bench2.html">http://www-dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/~ma/postfix/bench2.html</A>) but 
the Maildir approach to mail storage appears to be better address 
scalability requirements for large installations.
Apparently a new version of qmail is on the way 
(<A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/2001/04/msg00516.html">http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/2001/04/msg00516.html</A>) 
but I won't be holding my breath.

Is having to fiddle with the source really a large issue by comparison 
to the other problems to solve in a mail system handling thousands of users?
