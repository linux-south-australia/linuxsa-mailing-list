&gt; Just copying the look'n'feel of Windows isn't innovation IMHO :-)

So you think that:
-multiple desktops
-desktop pager
-resizable panel (and themable)
-completely themed gui (all widgets and window decorations)
-email client that supports mailing lists and threading (not saying they are 
the first but outlook STILL doesnt do this (havent seen version 6 so correct 
me if i'm wrong).
-ability to select text and middle click to paste it.
-grouping of application windows on the taskbar (actually beos is probably the 
first OS that supported this - and probably in the _opentracker_ project too! 
(open source) - and KDE featured it before the release of winxp)
-window 'shading'
-automatic window positioning (in kde - if you have a window open in the top 
left corner, the next one you open will likely appear in the bottom right 
etc.)
-windows 'click onto' borders of screen or other windows.
-hold down ALT and click on any part of a window to move it.
-middle click the 'maximize' button to only enlarge the window vertically
-right-click the 'maximize' button to only enlarge the window horizontally
-and i dont have the time to list off the billion other things that windows 
doesnt have...

are not innovation?  They certainly weren't copied from windows!!
KDE does have a look of its own. IMHO it looks MUCH nicer than any windows!
To make it look and work completely different to windows is to make it 
different to what most of us are used to and yet another learning curve for 
people switching to linux (and those of us who have used linux for years).
KDE is developed by people who use it.  There is a LOT in KDE that isn't in 
ANY other GUI!  It is unique, not a clone.
And if they didn't copy the basic functionality of windows, people would turn 
around and say 'see? your gui doesn't do that'.  So they really cant win can 
they?

Gnome 2 is nice too....but lacking in features.  I like it and have used it in 
the past, but i missed kde's rich feature set and groovy eye candy so i 
switched back again.... (does the 'ability to choose' qualify as 
'innovation'?).

anyway, my last point is one that many people will relate to:

The ability to triple-click to select an entire line of text.

Again, i think this was in beos as well but dont know where it actually 
originated exactly....still not in windows so it obviously didnt come from 
there.

So there are LOTS of innovations in just the GUI.  And i haven't mentioned the 
multitude of features in the kernel that are put there because the developers 
thought it would be cool.

IMHO microsoft is way down the bottom when it comes to innovation.  all too 
often they copy other's ideas and claim them as their own....

innovation in open source?  you bet!
