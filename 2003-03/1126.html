Hi all,

I am not a PHP programmer, and do not want to become one -- I wish to
learn as little as humanly possible about PHP, while still doing what I
want to do. However, I'm trying to install a package that requires PHP
and the "Smarty" Template Engine. I'm trying to follow the directions
for installing Smarty here:
<A HREF="http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/installing.smarty.basic.php">http://smarty.php.net/manual/en/installing.smarty.basic.php</A> , and I have
a problem...

Specifically, it says:

----
Smarty uses a PHP constant named SMARTY_DIR which is the system filepath
Smarty library directory. Basically, if your application can find the
Smarty.class.php file, you do not need to set SMARTY_DIR, Smarty will
figure it out on its own. Therefore, if Smarty.class.php is not in your
include_path, or you do not supply an absolute path to it in your
application, then you must define SMARTY_DIR manually. SMARTY_DIR must
include a trailing slash. 
----


Now, I don't really want to edit the package to set up the "SMARTY_DIR"
variable, otherwise upgrades will cause hard-to-follow failures. So, I
really want to use this include_path (which would seem the obvious thing
to do). However, I don't know what include_path actually _is_...

I looked in the php.ini file (/etc/php4/apache/php.ini on my Debian
Woody system), and the only mention of include_path is:

----
;include_path = ".:/php/includes"
----

... which is commented out, and besides, /php doesn't exist on my
machine.

So, I tried installing the package without Smarty, in the hope that
there would be an error message that would shed some light on the
situation. The error message I got was:

----
Fatal error: Failed opening required 'Smarty.class.php'
(include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in &lt;php file&gt; on line &lt;line&gt;
----

I also discovered that if I looked through the libphp4.so file, I found
this string (".:/usr/share/pear") in it. Great. So it's compiled in.

So, I assume that this pear directory is not the "appropriate" place to
put a template engine, and I have no idea what "." is supposed to be
relative to. I can't seem to find any reference to this on php.net
either. Surely I'm missing something damned obvious here?
