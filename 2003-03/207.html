&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; I have an ssh portforward set up over a SNATed link. It looks like this:
&gt; 
&gt; remote machine (10.x.x.x)
&gt; runs `ssh -NR 2525:server:25`
&gt;  |
&gt;  |
&gt; SNAT Router
&gt;  |
&gt;  |
&gt; server here (port 2525 -&gt; remote 25)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now what happens is that the ssh command seems to time out after about 1
&gt; minute, and then the mail fudge we have in place stops working. I have a
&gt; similar issue with ssh access -- which means that I can't get to the
&gt; remote machine easily, and it's an hour's drive away. Due to this, I'm
&gt; not sure if the ssh command is accurate, as I'm typing it from memory of
&gt; what's there, so if there's a minor syntax problem, ignore it.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there perhaps some sensible way of making ssh hang about for longer?
&gt; Is this likely to be a timeout problem (I can't check the logs remotely,
&gt; as the port forward doens't stay up for long enough to check...)
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, if someone's got a simple idea, I'd be keen to hear it. :) In
&gt; the meantime, I'm driving down there, and will see what I can do onsite.

i assume you're doing the port forward for mail...

i have used in the past stunnel under linux and bounce under freebsd
to forward a specific port for session based stuf like smtp, pop and
imap. setup an entry in (x)inetd to accept on localhost on a port of
your choice, connecting to  the remote server on a high port of your
choice, where (x)inetd runs another copy of stunnel or ...
which terminates the connection to the local service.

what app/service are you trying to forard?

cheers,

Kim
