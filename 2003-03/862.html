&gt;Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;We've had some dicussion about text formatting recently, and I noted
&gt;some mention of troff. I've never been able to figure out quite what the
&gt;*roff tools are... The only time I've seen them used (at least, the only
&gt;place I'm conscious of their use) is in man pages. I was under the
&gt;impression that they are historical artifacts, and have since been
&gt;effectively replaced by TeX and friends (which has, in turn, been
&gt;largely replaced by WYSIWYG word processors).
&gt;
&gt;Can anyone give me or point me at some sort of comparison or
&gt;introduction to the roff stuff? Can anyone tell me what the hell the
&gt;name means? :)
&gt;
If I knew, I would make you tell me what awk meant first! :-D

&gt;
&gt;Cheers

Well I got my first lesson today, so maybe that is a start. :-[  

I will tell you all I know which is practically zero...

I also looked for a troff based GUI because I am not quite ready for the 
commands yet.

I saw this page:

<A HREF="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~AUIS/">http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~AUIS/</A>

It says that the latest release is in beta testing.  I couldn't find any 
RPM's for it, but I saw something about Red Hat 3.

Anyway, it says that it produces troff output, and that is something I 
would like to try, but I might have some trouble compiling the program.

But back to troff...

Grog linked to a page that has some troff source code on it:

<A HREF="http://www.alltel.net/~kollar/utp/">http://www.alltel.net/~kollar/utp/</A>

About 1/4 down it says:

&gt;
&gt; groff source &lt;<A HREF="http://www.alltel.net/">http://www.alltel.net/</A>%7Ekollar/utp/utp_beta2.1a.tar.gz&gt; 
&gt; (460K tar/gz) - type make to build a PostScript file



&lt;Infomercial&gt;

So I downloaded it, and it went really fast!  It said the book was 500 
pages, and that usually takes a couple of minutes or so, so I didn't 
think I had it.  

That 460k, that's got to be an error.

Too light on the bandwidth.

Impossible.

I am going to try again.

Duuude! No, way. There it is.  

That's a 525 page book, took a few seconds!

I gotta see this....

I decompressed the file and went in the console and typed make.  And all 
of a sudden,  there was a postscript file!  Then ps2pdf a few seconds 
later, I had a PDF file.

Wow! If this were a new technology, I would say that is quite an 
innovative way to save bandwidth and time!

&lt;/Infomercial&gt;

Ok, time for another beer. :-)
