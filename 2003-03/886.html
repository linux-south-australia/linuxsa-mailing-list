No.  It was a Stanford-only OS on a DEC-10.

You can find more on WEB by serching Google for "literate
programming".  It's pretty popular amoung programmers where
the documentation is part of the delivered programming
product or where you need to show traceability between
documentation and program.  So you might use it if writing
code to meet the higher levels of the Common Criteria
or, in Knuth's case, if you wanted to publish your code
in a book.

Most big projects include some elements of literate programming;
such as tools like JavaDoc, e-lisp definitions or Doxygen.  If
you start to push these technologies to their limit you end up
reimplementing WEB.

At the coalface, the Literate Programming movement was the
final nail in the coffin for line comments in coding standards
(where each minor aspect of the program is detailed) and rise
of block comments (where the big picture of each module is
painted and the code allowed to substantially speak for
itself).

I've used both WEB-like systems for building cryptographic
code and Doxygen for writing modules for Net-SNMP.  WEB
is a boon if you need to do serious source code inspection;
it saved hours at external code review meetings.

The biggest flaw with Doxygen is that it's optional.  There's
simply too much scope for people not to add or alter the
documentation.  It's also very poor at describing function
call contracts, which is one of the main purposes of
program documentation.  Doxygen is extendable, so its
easy but annoying to add code to allow parameters to
be explained well.
