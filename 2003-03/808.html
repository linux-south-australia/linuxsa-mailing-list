&gt; hi all,

&gt; Seen grid computing mentioned a few times, occasioanally as a punchline,
&gt; occasionally as the Next Big Thing. What is it? (or was this discussed
&gt; just weeks ago?)

Grid computing is being used as a lovely term for making marketings
noises about, and for selling expensive equipment from companies like
Sun and IBM.

Grid computing is also a very real area of research, even if
Sun/IBM/friends want to blow it out of all proportion. It's clustering
spread over many disparate nodes, networks and administration regimes.
SETI is a massive example. As a recent illustration, there is some
company in the US that has set up to sell CPU cycles to companies that
run big online game engines, which is like SETI in rough concept but
much more real-time. 

The traditional Uni system administrator who uses spare cycles in
everyone's screen saver for calculating primes doesn't count, because
everything is under his control. Grid computing is when lots of people
who don't trust one another can share cycles according to some safe
protocol.
