&gt; No, you're missing the alternatives.  But I'd prefer the command line
&gt; for a lot of things.

same.

&gt; I do that too.  But I don't want to have to position on a widget to do
&gt; so.  I've been using X for 13 years now, and from the beginning I've
&gt; been able to use the mouse to iconify or deiconify windows.  But now
&gt; people are removing this functionality, and I can't see a good reason
&gt; for it.

good point.  is it worth contacting the developers concerned?  or maybe as you 
have said previously, the solution probably comes down to using an 
alternative window manager.

&gt; I'm not criticizing other people's views.  But in many cases, I think
&gt; they're formulated without knowing the alternatives.  That's the kind
&gt; of lock-in which Microsoft has achieved, and I don't like it.

As far as the general public is concerned, Microsoft is all they know.  I dont 
like it either.  I do believe linux offers a very good alternative to 
windows.  I also believe it is _different_ to windows but not so different 
that discontented windows users (isn't that all of them?) cannot switch with 
a minimum loss in productivity.  I see this as being an advantage for linux.
I'm as interested in freeing people from MS lock-in as you are.

-Steve.
