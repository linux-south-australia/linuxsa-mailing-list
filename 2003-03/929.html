Peer,

&gt; Those particular packages may no longer be "pointed to" in the pool
&gt; from SID as  they are not latest.. 

Damn. The packages file then is old. Confound.

&gt; (and hopefully it's still actually on one of the mirrors in your
&gt; sources.list)

But it's not.

&gt; There is a LOT of activity around the testing suite at the moment
&gt; which has had me hopping to keep up
&gt; Including gcc and libc6 stuff .. it may pay you to pin your libc6 and
&gt; gcc stuff down for a while.

Possibly.

&gt; I believe that everything now uses the "new" pool system including SID
&gt; which used to be a sort of open "CVS" ....on a seperate branch.

It does. It seems to be mostly working.

&gt; Why not use unstable where currently I am watching  what _was_a
&gt; perfectly good nautilus spawning about 10 new processes a second  :)
&gt; On another box ...

Actually I've seen that happen on a box at work. I'm not sure what
triggers it - it appears to be totally random. Luckily it's on an ext3
file system and doesn't mind being hard rebooted if it gets too out of
control.
