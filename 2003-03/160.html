&gt;there are other solutions but OSPF s a stable solution now, ok so

OSPF can be a terrible solution for links that might have intermittent 
issues (such as the issues found with residential wireless links..). 
Because it has no sort of session, an OSPF route can appear ok even when 
the link is dropping 80% of packets and is otherwise unusable.

BGP is a nicer solution, as the underlying TCP protocol won't function 
over bad links, so they drop out properly during intermittent failure. 
Unfortunately the loop-detection properties of BGP make it unsuitable as 
an IGP (routes aren't propogated more than 1 hop within the same AS) and 
it requires manual configuration for every unique pair of nodes that can 
see each other.

IGRP wouldn't be so bad, but it's Cisco proprietary..

There are a few white papers and projects out there that define 
protocols better suited to a wireless mesh, it should be interesting to 
see which ones become commonplace. See also some of the recent articles 
on 'selfish routing' for other issues that may affect mesh networks.
