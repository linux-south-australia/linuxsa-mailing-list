&gt; I don't know much about mesh, other than the few web pages I've read. 
&gt; So I can't really answer your questions, other than pointing out that 
&gt; it's an interesting avenue that appears relevant to your project.

mesh routing aims to and mostly delivers a setup and go with tiny
amounts of maintenance self healing network.

now in reality, it delivers the minimal configuration side, it is moslty
maintenance free, but monitoring the network is not as striaght forward
as a conventional fixed (p-t-p) network, like a dial-up net, for
example.

another issue that is still a fuzzy problem is bandwidth limiting and
congestion control. but routing protocols take into account bandwidth
avaiable and route traffic around them. newer (experimental) routing
protocols are more sophisticated and offer more control over this
problem...

but, you are more like to have problems initially with hardware and the
roaming AP doing channel mangling =( this was a serious problem in
london actually.  we had a bunch of wireless routers running in Ad-Hoc
mode, they were all using channel 1.  they were running mobile-mesh and
routing just fine, we could wonder around the different nodes and they
would continue to stay connected to the network and route traffic to
given server and maintain a tcpip session, ie video streaming.

but, what would happen is from time to time (im still assuming it was)
an AP would pass by various nodes, and all the wireless routers would
change to a different channel. one of the consume.net guys suspected an
XP box, but we could not duplicate the problem with an XP box =(

so some of the wireless routers would dissapear for a while until a
cronjob would force the cards back onto the right channel =/ (by
dropping and relaoding the lucent driver and reinitialising the wireless
settings) very messy hack ... but it worked. we also used dhcp to pass
messages to the routing software to notify that new clients were online
and let other wireless routers know about clients coming and going...
another messy hack, but it'd be nice if could have integrated it a bit
more. but it removed any requirement for a dozer box to have any
specific software installed...

we used a mixture of onmis, patches and directional antenna to setup the
wireles network, all boxes were linux and running lucent pcmcia cards in
ISA pcmcia bridges (that was what was available at the time)

it was mostly a success, there were a few problems, cable and pc hardware
failures, muppet sysadmins (mostly me) and strong wind blowing antenna
the wrong way =)
 
&gt; &gt;One thing we want to be able to do is provide broadband internet access
&gt; &gt;to the communities. How can we do that through mesh?
&gt; 
&gt; Route through all the interconnecting points in between.

this is not an easy task ATM, especially if you have multiple entry
points to the "Internet". If the goal is not the "Internet", then that
makes life somewhat easier. you'll need to make your own "fake" root
name servers, some content on web servers etc and plenty of time to make
it work =) but don't worry there are lots of folks about to sign up to
Air-Stream who are on tyhe verge of doing this too, so there will be
lots help available just arround the corner (i hope =).

oh, and you already know about licenced carrier "issues". i need to get
up to speed on these, as its all changed since i last looked a couple of
years ago =/

&gt; &gt;We want to provide a regional Intranet, can we do this with a mesh?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.

yep =) the "hard" part is the clients discovering the servers and
services on the intranet ... there are now clients out there to do this.
there is one by apple and there is a windows client service on 1069
IIRR.

&gt; &gt;We want to provide community servers with online training. Information.
&gt; &gt;Community resources access etc. Will your mesh allow this to be
&gt; &gt;provided?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.

why not? if you want this service over the network then its just like
doing it on any wired network, IMHO. (except more hops =)

&gt; &gt;We want the clients to not have to worry about any of the technical
&gt; &gt;stuff, just turn their computers on. Can the mesh do this?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.

this is where "little black box" theory comes in. if you can make a
little black box to do the job, then its easy. if the "user" needs to
maintain a "unix" box then ... you'll need a bigger training program =P

it is achievable. time needs to be put into planning where nodes need to
go anyway, that planning needs to include deployment details about
links, like; where is the best place to deploy long haul point to point
likes and where to deploy onmis to maintain coverage for "users" or
groups... maybe you could draw up a map of all the communtiy projects
and schools on the area, draw lines between them, say those are point to
point links, then see if the areas you want to cover "wirelessly" are
covered around those groups and schools...
that is assuming you can place an wireless router there ... hmmm
this is where consume was only starting to get a toe hold.

with a project like this there is always concerns and building
confidence in the target audience is the hardest part. the technical
side will probably be trival once your ready to go =)

cheers,

Kim
