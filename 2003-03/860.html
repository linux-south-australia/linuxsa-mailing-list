Hi.

After the death of our old laser printer today, I decided to plug an
epson stylus colour 760 into the network and serve it up to the other
boxes on the network. I ran into problems that there is no clear answer
to in the cups documentation, or the web by google-ing.

The stylus is connected via DLink DP101 print server to the network.
The cups server is a debian woody box with a bunch of cups debs
installed, including the cupsys-bsd.

I struck 2 problems:

1. After setting it up in cups, I could not print from the server - the
light would wink, but nothing printed.

Resolution #1
-&gt; apt-get install cupsys-driver-gimpprint
-&gt; Reconfigure the printer to use the gimp-print driver
-&gt; Restart cups

Printing in full colour now!

2. The network clients could print, but their postscript output was
printing postscript as text. (spooling the jobs was no problem)

Resolution #2
-&gt; Waste hours searching the cups doco and the web to no avail.
-&gt; Start tracking what the spooled jobs are being identified as with the
file command - they are identified as postscript, but the filters are
not activated for some reason.-&gt; Eventually, track the lpd daemon
'cups-lpd' and find it's configuration in the /etc/inetd.conf.-&gt; Read
the man page for cups-lpd, which delivers the following gem:

OPTIONS
       The -o option to cups-lpd inserts options  for  all  print
       queues.  Most often this is used to disable the "l" filter
       so that remote print  jobs  are  filtered  as  needed  for
       printing:

           printer stream tcp nowait lp /usr/lib/cups/daemon/cups-lpd   
       cups-lpd -o document-format=application/octet-stream

       The  example shown resets the document format to be appli­
       cation/octet-stream, which forces  auto-detection  of  the
       print file type.

-&gt; make the change, and kill -HUP the inetd, and everything is working!

Interestingly, with the standard entry in inetd.conf, the file
identification in /var/log/cups/error_log is application/vnd.cups-raw. I
searched the web for that string, and all I could find was a few people
with similar, but unresolved problems. Hopefully, this post will find
it's way into google and save some people a bit of time and frustration.

Michael
