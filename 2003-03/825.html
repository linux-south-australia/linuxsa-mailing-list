&gt;&gt; No, that's not agreeing with me :-)  I think that window widgets are a

&gt; Really?

Really.

&gt; Glad to hear that you would rather do all of your word processing,
&gt; web browsing, spreadsheets, image editing, 3d modelling, and audio
&gt; editing from the command line. ;-)

No, you're missing the alternatives.  But I'd prefer the command line
for a lot of things.

&gt;&gt; Sure, making them bigger would make it easier to position on them,
&gt;&gt; but that's not the issue.
&gt;
&gt; You mean that's not _your_ issue.  There are a lot of people who DO
&gt; prefer to use their mouse for even simple things like resizing,
&gt; maximising or minimising a window.

I do that too.  But I don't want to have to position on a widget to do
so.  I've been using X for 13 years now, and from the beginning I've
been able to use the mouse to iconify or deiconify windows.  But now
people are removing this functionality, and I can't see a good reason
for it.

&gt; You do a very good job of portraying _your_ views...and there is
&gt; nothing wrong with that...but lets not forget to respect other's
&gt; views as well.  It is equally as important. ;-)

I'm not criticizing other people's views.  But in many cases, I think
they're formulated without knowing the alternatives.  That's the kind
of lock-in which Microsoft has achieved, and I don't like it.
