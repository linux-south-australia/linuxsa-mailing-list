&gt; Of course they're not innovation.
&gt;
&gt; Someone that could drive a 1973 Xerox PARC Alto could
&gt; drive a 2003 KDE desktop.  That's evolution.
&gt;
&gt; Someone that could drive a IBM 3270 or DEC VT100 terminal
&gt; would see the Alto as something quite different, requiring
&gt; a deep change in the way they think about computing.  That's
&gt; innovation.
&gt;
&gt; There are recent innovations in computing -- MP3 music,
&gt; all-digital cameras and the like.
&gt;
&gt; I don't view Linux as innovative, but as making the past
&gt; 30 years of computing innovation available to everyone.

definition:  'Innovate' = to make changes; bring in something new or new ways 
of doing things...

You are focussing on the 'new ways of doing things', and I agree that looking 
at the bigger picture, linux is on the surface similar to earlier or other 
technologies in the way we use it.

However, I was pointing out things in the linux desktop experience that stand 
apart from windows in particular.  The most useful out of the list i used was 
probably 'multiple desktops' (or 'virtual' desktops).  This was definitely a 
change in the way we use our desktops.  I often have between 3 and 10 windows 
open at once and to try and manage those on windows' single desktop would be 
a nightmare!  Virtual desktops enable better desktop / window 
management...and as such, are an innovation...however small or insignificant 
others might think it is.

Other things like eye-candy and desktop widget themes were certainly a 'new 
thing' but clearly not everyone sees these as important.

Again, the main thrust of my post was in answer to the one before it....and 
that is, the linux desktop/gui is NOT just a clone of windows.....maybe a 
little aside from the 'innovation' topic but kind of related since it is MS 
that originally brought up the whole 'innovation' thing. :-)
