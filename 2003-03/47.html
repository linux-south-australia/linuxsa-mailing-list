&gt; David,
&gt;
&gt; That's almost a complete howto.

Well I wouldn't go that far... more like a Readers Digest style 
Condensed HOW-TO.  ;)

&gt; It sounds like it's a bit more complex than I had even been expecting 
&gt; though.

Ah, well, it is... but not overly so. There's an initial "wtf?" moment 
and then it should all seem pretty clear.

&gt; All in all, it sounds like the way to go is to first get IPv6 all
&gt; going locally within the home LAN, and then try to get connectivity to 
&gt; the net.

I figured it was easier this way.

&gt; (My home lan is less interesting than yours - I have 10 machines which
&gt; are IP-capable, and I only keep 6 of them running because it's just
&gt; too much admin to patch all the vulnerabilities every time they're 
&gt; announced.)

Well I have about the same number of machines, on and off the net 
(roughly), but security patches aren't what stop me running all of 
them, rather ETSA/AGL ....

&gt; My ssh log messages already say something like this:
&gt;
&gt; Mar  2 16:11:33 dog sshd[26799]: Accepted publickey for abcdefgh from 
&gt; ::ffff:203.38.xyz.52 port 36318 ssh2
&gt;

Ok, so it looks like you already have an IPv6 capable kernel and an 
IPv6 capable ssh daemon and client.

You'll find that if you do an `ifconfig eth0` you'll see an address 
starting with fe80:  which is an IPv6 link address.
&gt;
&gt; In some contract work I'm doing at the moment, I'm supposed to get some
&gt; software working for IPv6 over cellular mobile (like 3G stuff 
&gt; basically).
&gt;

That's jumping into the deep end somewhat ;)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway.... so it looks like the best strategy is:
&gt;
&gt; 1.	Get it going on the home LAN.
&gt; 2.	Get it going to/from the real internet.
&gt;
&gt; But when I get to stage 2, I'd still like to know what are the choices
&gt; for getting connected.
&gt; If I want native IPv6 on my PPP link, I guess I've got to discuss
&gt; that with my ISP.
&gt;

Yep.

&gt; But for IPv6 over IPv4 connectivity in Adelaide, what are the current
&gt; options and how much do they cost?
&gt;

I'm not sure there is a provider of IPv6 tunnel connectivity (tunnel 
broker) in Adelaide (someone correct me please, I'll be pleasantly 
surprised).
&gt;
&gt; I imagine that anyone who provides IPv6 connectivity is going to want 
&gt; money.
&gt;

Well currently, because it's all experimental, you should be able to 
get IPv6 connectivity for next to nothing (freenet6 is, as the name 
implies, free; but it's in Canada).

&gt; And to be efficient, the connection point should be in the same city.

Ideally, yes, but sometimes you just need to go with whatever is 
available.

www.hs247.com has a list of tunnel brokers.

&gt; Intriguingly, I found this:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/SEHS.html">http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/SEHS.html</A>
&gt; That some sort of gobbledygook information about IPv6 at my old high 
&gt; school!

Yeah I saw that too... Was quite stunned.

&gt; I found that here:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/bycountry.html">http://www.cs-ipv6.lancs.ac.uk/ipv6/6Bone/Whois/bycountry.html</A>#AU
&gt; But that still doesn't tell me who to contact in Adelaide for 
&gt; connectivity.
&gt;
&gt; Is there a list of publically available (commercial or not) IPv6
&gt; access points in Adelaide?
&gt;

Your best bets are I suppose, connect.com and aarnet.

Being commercial, connect.com is not likely to be a free provider.
