&gt; &gt;Is there a "jigg" mailing list? I think sourceforge may let you host
&gt; &gt;something on their site and a number of local ISPs in Australia might be
&gt; &gt;willing to donate some resources if you don't have any. Also, Linux
&gt; &gt;Australia or The AUUG Inc might donate resources if for some reason
&gt; &gt;sourceforge does not (or another similar, probably better setup system
&gt; &gt;[because sourceforge's purpose is to support OS software])...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;DSL
&gt; &gt;
&gt; To echo this sentiment, it looks like their is some good code there that 
&gt; people would like to preserve and enhance.
&gt; 
&gt; I am glad DSL made this post. :)

All i can say is-- WOW, what a positive response !!.

..and i've only announced it on this list server
and no where else.

No, there's no list server... no anything. jigg implements
a few ideas my boss had (late 2001), which were inspired 
by somebody else with an idea.

When i asked squid developers late 2001, they
weren't really interested. they said it wasn't
in the squid scope.

These concepts really need to be in squid.. because
it's very expensive to fork processes and open TCP
connections. much time is lost doing this.

..but, a year ago (and i should really find this out and
see what robert collins has been up to), squid wasn't able 
to do TE without internal modifications... and as for
look ahead, that wasn't even bothered to be asked.

this is from the horses mouth-

--$---------------------------------------------
&gt; You can see some code in the te and te_modules branches of
&gt; cvs.devel.squid-cache.org. (see <A HREF="http://devel.squid-cache.org">http://devel.squid-cache.org</A> for all
the
&gt; in progress patches to squid).
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately due to the internal request path in squid, TE cannot
&gt; operate consistently, and I halted development on that code around 12
&gt; months ago. If/when we fix the squid request path, then it can be
&gt; reinstated easily.
&gt;
&gt; I'm very interested in having the generic TE coding capability in
squid
&gt; (the implementation I did has identity,gz,compress codings) but it
will
&gt; be very hard to make work reliably at the moment :[.
--$---------------------------------------------


TE is such an obviously beneficial implementation by
caches... but some of the squid authors look hard headed,
and not open to new ideas. reading roberts email, it
seemed to me like he was pushing shit up the hill... 
which in my experience is quite normal for 
"foundations" to protect the direction of a project 
and to keep it RFC/convention pure (have a read
of squids "becoming a developer" page.. it's like
joining the free masons ;) -- 
<A HREF="http://devel.squid-cache.org/howto.html">http://devel.squid-cache.org/howto.html</A>).

..which is why i went off and wrote my own program.

There are a few refinements that need to be done for
it to run even better... if we are still around, 
then i'll refine jigg. but..

ultimately, i want to bang on squid developments
door and say look at this jigg thing-- it's goood shiiit.
Fuck squids scope, why don't you just implement 
it ???. it really works !.

that's my goal... either for them to implement
it, or for me to join the development team.

having failed that, there's always jigg ;) ;) ;)

but if i'm no longer in the ISP game, then there's
no point in it for me. we shall see in the next
few days or so ;)
