I don't cop out to make myself sound right. I'm eager to be proven 
wrong so I can learn more.

You're comparing your 21" display against my 12" display. With those 
sizes, CRT vs LCD isn't a direct comparision.

&gt; To display 110 lines on a 768 scan line deep display, there would only
&gt; be 7 scan lines, including gap, per character.  There's no way you can
&gt; display characters properly in that format.

You can't analyse display resolution like that. For example, I could 
counter-point that your 7 scan lines on a CRT would be smeared up 
against a bunch of blobby glowing chemicals brutually hacked into 
"somewhere around here" coloured regions, whereas each pixel on an LCD 
is precisely controlled.

As much of an idiot Steve Gibson is, he did a good writeup of how LCD 
extends its resolution:

So this may help you understand some of the factors that an LCD can 
bring into play that isn't available for CRTs.

The thread has exceeded my interest, so good luck with your subsequent 
purchase.
