Robyn,

&gt; The age old question rises again, how can a person express humour in a
&gt; print medium where people can't see facial expressions etc?

Quite easily.

&gt; it was and he'd handle it. So David was it you? Do you remember? I
&gt; know David better now and I'm not so touchy, not that I'd let anyone
&gt; get away with bad behaviour.

It wasn't me from my memory.

&gt; "Can my meaning/intention here be misconstrued?" You might think why
&gt; should I bother with what they think about what I wrote. 

Meaning and intention can always be misconstrued. I accept that and
whilst I might diligently support my own point of view I do take others'
points of view into account.

&gt; Alex, more than a couple of years ago someone was kicked off this list
&gt; for being rude, obstrepolous and nasty, he hasn't come back. There are
&gt; those of us who tell David to pull his head in occasionally.

I am generally not rude, often obstreporous [i.e. noisy and stubbornly
defiant] but rarely nasty without reason. I don't suffer fools gladly,
never have but maybe in my old age I will.

Woe when this day comes!
