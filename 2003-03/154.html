the issue with wireless is it requires a certain amount of redundancy.

anyone who has a any experience with netwerking will know that 
"shit happens" on a regular basis and putting a single simple fixed
infraswtructure in place will not cut it in the long term,
talk to anyone in the medium to large ISP arena...

so, now with a complex netork with redundancy you need a routing
structure that can deal with a complex cyclic nets.

"erm ... but thats a mesh"  i hear you say ... funny that.

whether or not you run omni-directioal antenna on your nodes,
you need a routing protocol or more likely a set of protocols that will
deal with the issues in a complex network and cope with failed links
or trees blowing in the breeze killing signal strength (don't laugh
it happened to us) and dropping the link and all the sessions =(

there are a buncha protocols that can deal with this now.
in fact there are a buncha wireless groups that are already deploying
this, barcelona, guadalahara and madrid (when i visited them last year)
were rolling out OSPF+BGP over 802.11b +  bridging HW AP + linux/bsd routers.

there are other solutions but OSPF s a stable solution now, ok so
its still in development, but you can roll it out and its mostly
stable, there are heavily loaded routers in LINX that run zebra!

sydney wireless and airstream are looking to deploy OSPF over sydney and
adelaide ...

i'm sure that lessons learnt from airstream will apply equally well to 
what Ians in mind ... 

cheers,

Kim
