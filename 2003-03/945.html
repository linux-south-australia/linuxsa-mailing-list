&gt; Anyone who has a shell can be considered a "local" user. This, of
&gt; course, includes those who first get authorisation by "ssh".

Thanks for clearing that up.  That was the way I read it but it was good to
get it clarified!

&gt; &gt; upgrade and disrupt my server, or leave it be.  It would be great if
&gt; &gt; the CVE system accommodated some form of "severity" gauge which, for
&gt; &gt; example, could be based on how much time, effort and knowledge would
&gt; &gt; be required, on behalf of the cracker to exploit the vulnerability.
&gt;
&gt; I thought it did :-)

Maybe I missed it! :)

&gt; One thing you could do is accustom your users and management to the fact
&gt; that the system will go down [one time per year | two times per year |
&gt; three times per year | some other regular period] for security
&gt; maintanence. Set the dates and times and keep to them (even if you have
&gt; nothing to update - in which case I'd go on a witch hunt to find other
&gt; things).
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought.

This is definitely a worthwhile suggestion.  I guess I have always taken the
approach that security fixes should be implemented ASAP and for most of
them, this is relatively easy to achieve and requires little service
disruption.

I think my mistake has been applying the same philosophy to the kernel
security fixes which, of course is giving me the heartburn! :)  I can
certainly see merit in your suggestion and it probably strikes a good
compromise between security vulnerability and service availability.  It also
probably means I will be able to fix 5 or 6 security vulnerabilities in one
kernel upgrade too, which will save me a lot of time and kernel recompiles!
:)

Thanks for your thoughts David!

Cheers,
Graham
