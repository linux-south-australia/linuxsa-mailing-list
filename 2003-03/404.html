Michael,

&gt; To state the obvious, "All X input devices are handled through X".  If
&gt; you leave your display open I can grab your keyboard and mouse, log
&gt; everything, and pass through key presses and mouse movements.  I'll
&gt; have your root password before you know it... :-)

Of course. I forgot about that; it's not altogether obvious. Humans are
visual creatures and they'll see windows popping up on other displays
before they make the connection that this involves input devices too.

&gt; xhost is not secure enough IMHO.  

It depends who is on the network. If everyone else is running a dumb
terminal (or equivalent) that can only do things that couldn't possibly
hijack a remote X display and no alien machines are ever added to the
network then enhancing X security is like taking preemptive measures for
a situation that will never happen. Simply because one of the world's
leaders can take preemptive measures for something that may never happen
doesn't mean we have to...

&gt; C is for cookies, they're good enough for me.  
&gt; See Xsecurity(7) [on Linux, section 1 on Solaris] for details :-)

Icck.

One of the reasons that few use MIT-MAGIC-COOKIES is because they're
significantly user-unfriendly. It's bad enough trying to get seasoned
administrators to understand that the X Server is the display+input
devices and the X Clients are the programs....
