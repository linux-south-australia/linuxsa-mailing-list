&gt;&gt;&gt; If you think it SHOULD be different to MS Office, please state HOW
&gt;&gt;&gt; it should be different, rather than just criticizing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't have time for all of them, but here are a few:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; 1.  It ignores directory structures, just like Microsoft.  It doesn't
&gt;&gt;     seem to understand the concept of a cwd at all.  If I create a new
&gt;&gt;     document, it will always try to save it in my home directory.
&gt;
&gt; is there really a concept of cwd in the linux gui?

Yes.  You can't get rid of it.  Every process has a cwd.  The X
server's cwd is less interesting than that of the window manager.  But
starting all programs from the window manager is flawed for exactly
that reason.  It's much easier to start from an xterm, and that can
easily change cwds.

&gt; This is an innocent question...not trying to push a point here.
&gt; What I mean is that I could be working on a word doc and typing an
&gt; email at the same time.  if i went to add an attachment to the
&gt; email, should that start at the directory the word doc was in?

No.  That's the whole point: they're (presumably) independent
activities, so they should not be tied together by a common directory.

&gt; if i select an attachment from a different dir, should openoffice go
&gt; to this new dir when you select 'save as' ?

No, that would never happen anyway.  The cwd is per process, not per
desktop.

&gt; My StarOffice 6 (as you've said, and i agree, openoffice should be
&gt; no different) always points to the last directory used  within
&gt; StarOffice .

Hmm, that's not what I see.  Before sending the last message I tried
this:

  cd some/random/directory
  openoffice &
 
  Open new file, try to save.  It offers my home directory to save.

Maybe if I had changed it, it would have stayed, but it should know
its cwd from the start.  That's also why I don't like this
~/OpenOffice.org1.0.1 directory: it's OK to have, say, a directory
~/.OOo for config stuff, but OpenOffice creates a whole directory
structure separate from the UNIX space, as if to further isolate
itself.

&gt; For example, when i click 'open' it goes to the last place i opened
&gt; a doc from previously.

Yes, that's not the UNIX way.  I've noticed it'll forget what I'm
doing now (as witnessed by the cwd) and go to something I did last
time, which in my case could be weeks ago.

&gt; When I click 'save as' it will go to the directory i opened the
&gt;  current  doc from.

That's reasonable.

&gt;&gt; 2.  It doesn't have an editor.
&gt;
&gt; I thought that's what it was...unless you mean 'code editor' or something like
&gt; that. 

Well, what I meant by that was that it's so primitive that I wouldn't
even use it to write mail messages.

&gt; Well it wasn't designed to be a programmer's tool

Agreed, but why should a programmer's editor be different from any
other kind?

&gt; nor was it designed to replace tools like Tex etc.

No, that's not an editor, it's a text formatter.  It doesn't perform
that function well either.

&gt; They have a different focus and its like comparing apples with
&gt; oranges.

Well, if you can't use it for editing or text formatting, that takes
away a lot of its utility.

&gt; Maybe OpenOffice should have 'plugins' or something so that this
&gt; functionally could be possible....dunno - that's just a suggestion.

The trouble with "plugins" is that, from the user's point of view,
they're static.  There's a certain number available, they may or may
not be configurable, but that's the end of it.  Other systems have
macros in source form which you can modify to your needs.  Sound
familiar?  It's rather like the difference between a menu and a
command line: if you're satisfied with a small choice, menus are
better.  If you want to have control, the command line is better.

&gt;&gt; 3.  Its text formatting is extremely primitive.
&gt;
&gt; its built to be a word processor, for typing up reports, letters, even web
&gt; pages...and as such it is quite good.  Not sure what you're exactly after
&gt; here.

What you're saying is "it's limited".  Why should I stop there?  Why
can't I use it for more complicated things?  It means I need another
tool for the complicated things.  But I can use that tool typing up
reports, letters, even web pages too.  So what use is OpenOffice?

I've just tried editing a web page with OpenOffice.  I thought it had
hung, but then it came back saying "No corresponding external
application could be found for the given file type.  Pleas check the
OpenOffice.org settings."

I don't know what that means.  It let me edit the file anyway.  Then I
tried another file, which happened to be read-only.  No message, I was
just unable to change it.  I was able to save it, of course, and
changed only the main heading.  The original is
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-mar2003.html,">http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-mar2003.html,</A> and it's an XHTML
document.  I added one line and saved it as
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/xdiary-mar2003.html.">http://www.lemis.com/grog/xdiary-mar2003.html.</A>  It changed the entire
document format, from XHTML to what it calls HTML 3.2, but according
to HTML tidy it's more like HTML 4.01 transitional.  It also changed
the character set and language and reformatted the HTML so that it's
hard to read (though by no means as bad as what Microsoft produces).

This is exactly the kind of editing which is more trouble than it's
worth.

&gt;&gt; 4.  The user interface is slow and difficult to use.
&gt;
&gt; Havent had that problem.  Maybe my PC is fast enough that i dont
&gt; notice...

It's nothing to do with the speed of the machine.  It's the clumsiness
of the interface.  I'm constantly having to use the mouse for things
where the keyboard would do.  Even keyboard "short cuts" require
things like the cursor pad, which means that I have to move my hands.
That's about 5 times as much time as pressing something directly under
your fingers.

&gt; I dont find it difficult.  But that all depends on the individual
&gt; and what you're used to.

Indeed.  If you don't know anything better, it beats the hell out of
using a typewriter.

The real problem I have here is that it's "good enough" for most
people.  They don't realize that they can do so much better with other
interfaces, and the other interfaces require them to rethink, so they
don't bother.

&gt;&gt; I use OpenOffice for exactly one thing: compatibility with Microsoft.
&gt;
&gt; ??  why?  if you dont like the word compatibility in openoffice (or
&gt; lack of) then use word.  though the cursing and swearing would
&gt; probably increase :-)

I don't want to use "Word".  You shouldn't need special programs to
read files.  But people send me documents in Microsoft formats, and
it's the easiest way of reading them.

&gt;&gt; You can tell when I'm using it from the cursing and swearing.  Even
&gt;&gt; something as simple as entering non-ISO characters, such as em-rules
&gt;&gt; or curved quotation marks used in normal printed text, is a pain.
&gt;&gt; Putting in a Greek sentence into an English text is possible, but it
&gt;&gt; takes about 30 seconds of mouse pushing for each character.
&gt;
&gt; These requirements seem slightly heavier than those of the average
&gt; OpenOffice user.  You might find (you already have found) that other
&gt; software is better suited to this task.

Exactly my point.

&gt;&gt; I wish people would do some thinking about really innovative
&gt;&gt; alternatives.
&gt;
&gt; You obviously have confidence in your unix ability....why not create an
&gt; alternative program yourself?

It's very easy to criticize, but much more difficult to do a better
job yourself.  There are two main problems: manpower and a better
design.  But that doesn't mean people should accept the status quo.
FWIW, I do have something better.  I want something better still.

&gt; Its very easy to criticize, but much more difficult to do a better
&gt; job yourself.

Exactly.
