&gt; &gt;over my head with Windows and start setting up a distributed file system --

&gt; So FreeBSD has a distributed file system of some kind?  that's what i'd like
&gt; to do, linux clustering of some kind so there is one or two virtual servers,
&gt; but behind it we can just keep adding servers to the cluster, and no config
&gt; changes.  they all just get more space on the intranet or mapped samba
&gt; drives...

my plan is to use Samba aliases. each "project" that we enbark on has a
fixed folder heirachy that stores all the Docs and stuff in... so when a
given server runs outa poke, we slap in a new server then move the data
and the Samba alias over to the new machine =)

for example; samba server A has three aliases, Sales, Marketing and
Development. The delevopment aliased server is growing rapidly and will
eat all the diskspace "soon". so we drop in a new server, B, and as above
copy the data, move the alias and as long as your using DNS + DHCP for
clients, with no static IPs in config files, no one will know that
anything has changed =) i have done it here =)

so the new server B has the alias Development, and server A retains Sales
and Marketing. the actual samba servers have their own names, and they
appear like any other samba server on the browse list.

the catch is if folks insist on having lotsa shares mapped to driver
letters ... (will they ever abandon DOS and step into the real world?)

samba has some very handy features =) easy load balancing by slight of
hand =) well its easier to manage. having more boxes, does mean a bit
more overhead, but it reduces the cost of one thumping big machine and
makes the upgrade cycle a little easier. it also helps on the "*the*
server died", when you have several servers, only one is down and other
users aren't affected...

there are other down sides to maintaining more servers, but with
sensible package management, ssh, some scripts a single sysadmin can
maintain over a hundred *remote* unix (web/mysql/fw) servers =) i did.

cheers,

Kim
