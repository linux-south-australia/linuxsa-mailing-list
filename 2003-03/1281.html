&gt; &gt; laptop make the HDD spin down so often, especially when running on AC
&gt; &gt; power?  To make sure, I grabbed the Intel Application Accelerator
&gt; &gt; utility and modified the Advanced Power Management settings in the HDD
&gt; &gt; itself (this made no difference).  Thus I'm sure it's not a software
&gt; &gt; setting anywhere causing the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Not entirely a wise move. Toshiba may attempt to claim you've broken the
&gt; drive regardless of whether you have or not.

Just to be sure I have reverted the setting back to the way it was
originally and removed the IAA application from the PC.  I do acknowledge
Toshiba could interpret any fiddling with software settings as somehow
breaking the hardware if they get desperate enough to avoid taking action.

&gt; &gt; Has anyone else experienced this on their Toshiba laptop?  (or another
&gt; &gt; laptop which uses Toshiba drives, such as Dell?)  Does anyone think
&gt; &gt; this is a 'standard feature' to keep spinning down the drive even when
&gt; &gt; not requested to?  There are no PM settings in the BIOS either.
&gt;
&gt; I'd be inclined to say that it may simply be a stupid computer. Greg
&gt; Lehey has a good quote: "Never attribute to malice what you can atribute
&gt; to stupidity" and you're describing something that sounds stupid to me.

At this stage I cannot tell whether it's a fault or design feature.  I'm not
sure what warranties say about design faults although we all know that
design faults in computers (aka bugs) are not covered by warranties.

Initially Toshiba's reaction to the HDD problem was to claim that something
I installed caused it (system has the fault straight off the recovery CDs)
and then to deny it's a problem at all.

&gt; &gt; I will install Linux on this machine if (when?) it's running properly.
&gt; &gt;  If I
&gt; &gt; install it now Toshiba will just blame Linux for the problems and
&gt; &gt; leave it at that.
&gt;
&gt; They will try to blame it on Linux--as a company they're not entirely
&gt; Linux friendly. On the other hand talk to us if they do because at worst
&gt; we could have a PR nightmare on Toshiba's hands or a regulatory body
&gt; (such as the Office of Consumer Affairs) might find their tactics a
&gt; little "strange" and deserving of compensation.

I will talk to Simon Glassenbury at BMS Technology today.  If Toshiba still
refuse to take appropriate action I'll write to the service manager in
Sydney, and if this still does not yield results the next step is to shake
the Consumer Affairs stick and see it Toshiba twitch.

See ya
