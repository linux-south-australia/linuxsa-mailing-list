&gt; &gt; That sounds like it shoudl do it -- except that NFS is on my list of
&gt; &gt; deprecated technologies, like telnet and ftp.

i would expect that it'd only be deprecated if there was a much better
thing to replace it that behaved like NFS with the functionality of ssh
or summat

&gt; &gt; As one Mark Newton once pointed out, if someone can break into one
&gt; &gt; machine, then NFS gets them some access to other machines.
&gt; 
&gt; ... so that's why you'd share it while you're installing, and then
&gt; unshare it when you've finished. Or you'd use SMB, or similar...
 
sharing via NFS for a short period would be fine, just remember to turn
off all thos portmap and nfs services when you've finished.

&gt; &gt; It sounds from the comments that there is not standard technique for
&gt; &gt; cross-installing the kernel.
&gt; &gt; So I guess I'll use a data-stamp file and then run "find" to 
&gt; &gt; make a list
&gt; &gt; of files changed relative to the data-stamp, and then "scp" these
&gt; &gt; across at an appropriate point in the installation - either
&gt; &gt; just before the "make modules_install" or just after.
&gt; 
&gt; OK Alan. You have me confused. What you've said here is that seeing as
&gt; there's no "standard" way of doing it, you're going to ignore the
&gt; well-thought-out and tested solutions that some people have suggested
&gt; (eg NFS or scp, among others -- perhaps rsync), and try some completely

yes rsync would be my choice if NFS was not an option. better and faster
than find and scp =)

&gt; bizzare method instead. If you really don't want to copy unchanged files
&gt; across, perhaps rsync would be a better option than date-stamp, find and
&gt; scp? As far as I can tell, this would have the same effect, but be
&gt; easier, more reliable, and faster.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I prophesy that in 20 years' time, cross-installation of kernels will
&gt; &gt; be fully standardized. Mark ye!
&gt; 
&gt; So, we'll all be running debian?

as mentioned elsewhere, the *bsd debian project would make things a
little more portable, and make-kpkg would make life simpler =)

cheers,

Kim
