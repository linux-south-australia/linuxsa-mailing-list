&gt;&gt;&gt; I dont find it difficult.  But that all depends on the individual
&gt;&gt;&gt; and what you're used to.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Indeed.  If you don't know anything better, it beats the hell
&gt;&gt; out of using a typewriter.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The real problem I have here is that it's "good enough" for most
&gt;&gt; people.  They don't realize that they can do so much better with
&gt;&gt; other interfaces, and the other interfaces require them to rethink,
&gt;&gt; so they don't bother.
&gt;
&gt; Been following this debate with interest... I always find Greg's
&gt; opinions thought-provoking, though I don't always agree with
&gt; them. This snippet is an example. Greg, why do you have a problem
&gt; with the fact that OO (or Word, for that matter) is "good enough"
&gt; for most people? If it's not good enough for you, then I could
&gt; understand that that would be a problem... however, you have said
&gt; you do use a better tool (which, according to you, still isn't good
&gt; enough, but that's not what we're talking about)... So why would it
&gt; matter to you that other people choose to use OpenOffice?

The problem is that the OpenOffice approach is a dead end.  Much
graphically interfaced software is easy to use initially and becomes
progressively more difficult as you try to do more complicated things
with it.

An example (which may be possible, but I haven't found a way to do
it): I import an ASCII text and want to mark it up for publication.
In particular, I want to replace -- with an em-rule and "" pairs with
left and right quotes.  How do I do it?  To make things easier, there
are also some " characters in there that I don't want to convert.  How
do I tell the document where to avoid widows and orphans?  These
aren't complicated functions, they're pretty basic, but I haven't
found a good way to do them in OpenOffice.

&gt; What if the fact that they don't have to rethink is a real bonus for
&gt; them?

If they're not used to computers, they'll have to rethink to use any
kind of software.  Neither OpenOffice nor troff are things that more
than vaguely resemble what existed before computers.

&gt; What if the fact that it's the same as what they're used to means
&gt; that they don't need to think about their tools, and only about
&gt; their work?

I suppose it depends on how much they care about their work.  In the
example I give above, most people would give up, leave the "" as they
are, and change the em-rule to a hyphen.  They may go to the trouble
to manually remove orphans and widows, but it doesn't take more than a
little bit of modification to break those fixes.

&gt; For many people, in fact, most non-tech people, the tools are merely
&gt; tools, and the less thinking they cause, the better (after all, any
&gt; thinking about tools is wasted thinking that they could have spent
&gt; on the real work).

I think that goes for us too.  I certainly don't want more work than
necessary.  That's why I hate OpenOffice :-)  Admittedly, in my case
it helps that I have other tools.

&gt; I'm not sure what you are trying to acheive by objecting to their
&gt; choice (apart from when it directly affects you by making you use
&gt; the same tool to read their format documents).

If people make their choice based on an understanding of the issues,
fine, I don't have any problems with it.  But for most people, it's
not so much a choice as a default.  I'd like to give people the choice
of which software they use, and copying Microsoft doesn't help there.

Take an example: would you give a complete newbie Emacs to write texts
with?  I suspect not.  But why not?

Greg
