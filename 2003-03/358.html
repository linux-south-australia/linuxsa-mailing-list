&gt; Gidday all,
&gt; Have recently experienced the wonders of RedHat 7.1, Mandrake 8 & 9
&gt; and desire to go much further as Windows does not "do it for me" any
&gt; longer.

Good for you! I hope you like to read? Everything you really need is at
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org">http://www.tldp.org</A>

&gt; Having said that, have a small Windows network at home and wish to set
&gt; up RedHat 7.1 as my file and mail server (Wife and kids don't want to
&gt; leave security of Windows for now).

Redhat 8.0 is much slicker, more user friendly, and very windows-like.

&gt; Issues facing me at present are
&gt; 
&gt;   1. getting Network to talk to redhat (not sure if it is my NIC,
&gt;      protocol, or settings)

I guess you want a NAT firewall? Redhat ships with lokkit which can be
accessed by typing into a root prompt the command "setup".

RH7.1 by default ships with ipchains enabled if I recall correctly, so
first you should turn that off and enable iptables instead. At a root
prompt do....

chkconfig --level 123456 ipchains off ; service ipchains stop ; rmmod
ipchains

...and then do....

chkconfig --level 35 iptables on

An extremely quick and very newbie friendly iptables NAT/firewall script
can be found at <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/quicktables.">http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/quicktables.</A> Just
download and run the script and it'll generate an rc.firewall script for
you. Then you simply run it like...

chmod +x rc.firewall ; ./rc.firewall

Another very good firewall that I personally use on my rh8 box is at
<A HREF="http://monmotha.mplug.org">http://monmotha.mplug.org</A>

Once the firewall script has been run once you have to save the rulesets
so that redhat will use them on every boot.

service iptables save

And that should get your network all setup and running.

&gt;   2. setting file permissions on server

File permissions are pretty well already setup for you. Just make sure
to ONLY use root for admin tasks like running services and installing
packages, and dont use it for normal tasks like running user apps and
especially not X. Do man chmod for details if you need to change
anything yourself.

&gt;   3. Setting up modem/dialup from redhat to internet

Redhat 7.1 uses wvdial as it's default dialer, but that can be
configured from the gui. Do man wvdial for more details on it. The
config for it is in /etc/wvdial.conf
Another very user friendly gui dialer is kppp.

&gt;   4. Setting up a mail server (sendmail or qmail?)

Sendmail is a Mail Tranfer Agent. To setup an actual mail server you
would need an MX record pointing to your machine which is problematic on
a dialup. I use www.no-ip.com to get around the dynamic IP limitations,
which is a free service that provides a small app to update your IP
every time you dial-in. So you can use a hostname like mine is
awol.no-ip.org and you can also setup a MX (Mail eXchange) record there
too. Then you can have mailbox accounts like <A HREF="mailto:user@yourname.no-ip.org">user@yourname.no-ip.org</A> and
set your family's windows mail software to get their mail from the
gateway machine.

Then you need to run mail server software like pop or imap. I personally
use imap as you can then have a webmail interface running on your apache
web server called squirrelmail. Once installed you can set it to start
on every boot with a quick "chkconfig imap on" command. Do man chkconfig
for details and "chkconfig --list" will show you what's set to start at
what run level. Do "less /etc/inittab" for a quick rundown on what run
levels mean.

&gt; 
&gt; Main problem for me is learning the "linux-speak", understanding how
&gt; devices are configured, how do I check them, make sure they are
&gt; working etc.

I have a quick list of common linux commands is available on my home
machine at <A HREF="http://awol.no-ip.org/commands.html">http://awol.no-ip.org/commands.html</A>
But I stole most of that from <A HREF="http://www.cafecomputer.com/faqindex.htm">http://www.cafecomputer.com/faqindex.htm</A>

&gt; Any assistance and guidance would be greatly appreciated.

You can get instant help & answers on Internet Relay Chat, the so called
"chat rooms" your mother warned you about. The linuxsa mailing has a
channel on irc.freenode.net called #linuxsa so fire up xchat and make
your way there to speak to me or someone else. We're mostly lurkers
there so you may have to make some noise to get our attention. Saying a
person's nickname usually works. There's also channels #redhat &
#linuxhelp on EFNET (<A HREF="http://www.efnet.org">http://www.efnet.org</A> for a list of servers) where
there's always 100+ people ready and willing to help with any linux
probs.

&gt; Am located in country SA, in Mt Gambier district - if there is anyone
&gt; local here would love to get together for a "look" at a working system
&gt; to learn.

Too far from Adelaide for me I'm afraid, but if you're ever coming back
towards "civilization" at any time let me know and perhaps something
could be arranged. I'm sure others will be willing too.

&gt; thanks in anticipation
&gt; Trev

I hope I haven't confused you, and that this has helped.
