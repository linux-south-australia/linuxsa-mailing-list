&gt;&gt; What's the NFS component for?  Couldn't the front end SMTP systems
&gt;&gt; (the virus checkers) just deliver to the backend stores over SMTP/QMTP?

&gt; They could, but then the POP3 and IMAP servers would need to be running
&gt; on the backend stores as well,

I was thinking POP3/IMAP running on the backend only.  The frontends
run the virus checker, then forward the email to the correct box
(with LDAP pointing to the correct destination for any particular
server).  The backends then really become IMAP mail stores, and
the frontends standalone SMTP servers.  With equivalence MX settings,
scale to suit.

&gt; I also like
&gt; the idea of checking things like mail quotas and forwarding rules on the
&gt; edge systems and leaving the mail store to do storage only.

Yeah, but application type policies sometimes really need to be
done within the application (e.g. what to do when a mailbox is
over quota).

&gt;&gt; I must admit, I think Milter is great.  It's a shame it's not a
&gt;&gt; defacto/dejure standard for other MTAs, although I'm not sure
&gt;&gt; how easy it would be to integrate into qmail's modularityness
&gt;&gt; (take that, Funken Wagnall).

&gt; I don't think it's that hard, but it is non-standard. There are popular
&gt; patches for qmail-queue to pipe all received mail through an arbitrary
&gt; program, or you can just rename it and run your own program named
&gt; qmail-queue that delivers messages to the renamed qmail-queue-original.

But Milter offers more than that - it's able to participate in the
SMTP conversation, which allows you to bounce spam at a point where
it's more likely to count (for open relays, anyway, he said hopefully).
