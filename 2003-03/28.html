&gt; David,

&gt;&gt; That's a cop out.
&gt;
&gt; I know that it is a cop out but it was relevant to the question that 
&gt; was
&gt; asked. I don't see any point for my five or so machines on my private
&gt; network to have IPV6 addresses. In fact I don't need IPV6 for anything;
&gt; if I were to implement or use it I'd probably end up with a seriously
&gt; broken system, a lot of headaches and something where:
&gt;
&gt;  ssh linux.localhost
&gt;
&gt; ...still works.
&gt;

actually, IPv6 co-exists with IPv4 quite happily. I can ssh to the v6 
addresses on my LAN, but externally I ssh to my v4 address to gain 
remote access.  I'll grant you it's more of an academic issue at the 
moment, but I think it's worthy to gain some level of understanding and 
experience before the time comes where we're forced to use it.

&gt;&gt; How can you expect it to become more mainstream if nobody uses it ?
&gt;
&gt; Until we actually need IPV6--which we clearly don't (or we'd all be
&gt; forced to actually use it, d'oh, or things would break)--I tend to
&gt; consider it something that I'm not going to fix because at the moment
&gt; it's not broken.
&gt;

Nobody suggested it was broken. However, more people using IPv6 means 
more people testing the technology which hopefully means less technical 
fsckups in the implementation.

&gt;&gt; The more people that become familiar with it now, the more likely it
&gt;&gt; is to come to fruition sooner.
&gt;
&gt; The sooner that the so-called IP shortage actually affects us the more
&gt; likely it will come to fruiting sooner...
&gt;

There is no shortage, well, technically there isn't a shortage. The 
shortage is imposed by stupid decisions and companies that have A class 
addresses assigned to them, but clearly don't need them. If everyone 
used private addresses internally, and a small block of real addresses 
externally, much of the "address shortage" bull&$*# would disappear.
But then of course you get the marketing folks who think everything 
should have an internet accessible IP address (including your fridge), 
and to them I say Pbbtttt!  ;)
