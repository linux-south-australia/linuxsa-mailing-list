&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; This isn't designed to be flamebait, but we've all seen in the media
&gt; claims that Open Source rarely innovates, but typically just copies
&gt; innovation by others. Whether that's true or not is really irrelevant,
&gt; but I was hoping that people could pass on some of the areas where they
&gt; think Open Source software is and has been innovative (preferably stuff
&gt; that's happened over the last couple of years).

It's just the simple innovations that have been around for a long time.

 o  Simplified Window managers (like twm!)
 o  xinit
 o  stdin/stdout/stderr
 o  The way your hardware and file system are useable under the same
    heirachy, which means you can use them through applications and
    manipulate them at their most basic level 
    (eg 'cat /dev/urandom &gt; /dev/hda0')
 o  Permissions based upon mathematics

If I were to delve a little deeper, I'd say things like

 o  Gnome panels
 o  FreeBSD Ports

But there are some innovations about Windows that I like:

 x  Start Menu (if they used it properly)
 x  Wizards

Un-Innovations:

 !  Non-standard drop-down menu types (ie OfficeXP vs Office 2000)
 !  Convoluted dialogue boxes that have too many options buried too deep
 !  The inability to modify core components of Windows without a GUI
 !  NetBIOS names
 !  Changing an existing standard into a Microsoft standard
 !  The overall user model
 !  Backward compatibility
 !  Non-central directories for binary files, so when you try and load an
    installed program you have to navigate to that directory first.
 !  The way that the start menu will install icons in the user-space, so
    they're not available for other users.
 !  The way the Start Menu will let you remove icons from your start menu,
    but if they're part of 'All Users,' you can't remove them without
    removing them for everyone.
 !  The Microsoft Management Console.

Here's an un-innovation for both of them (well at least Gnome2 &  Windows)

 *  THREE levels of volume control.  The application, the slidebar, and the
    speakers.
