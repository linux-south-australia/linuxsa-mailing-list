&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh, so its like Lindows?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have installed and played with Lindows V3.0 (and yes, it's a licenced
&gt;&gt; copy).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; To be perfectly honest, apart from its extraordinarily fast
&gt;&gt; installation it looks like you get a Debian Sid + KDE 3.1 + Lindows
&gt;&gt; Theme.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Haha, it was a joke.  Lindows is terrible, played with 2.0, didn't like 
&gt; it at all, and its wine installation was broken, so Windows apps would run.

In my opinion, 2.0 was their best release yet. They are working in 3.1.


&gt; 
&gt; Click'n'Go subscription might be a great idea, but it looks incredibly 
&gt; like apt-get with a nice gui interface.  

Yeah, but you've got to know your packages, and Lindows tells you what 
they are.

I had a Netbsd setup but didn't want to spend the time to figure out how 
to mount the CD or install additional packages, because it was not clear 
from the documentation or the setup, so I installed Solaris 8 instead.

&gt;It's a complete marketing scam, 

Yep, they rely on marketing to be the end all. And they change business 
plans without batting an eyelash, but I think it has to do with knowing 
what they can and cannot accomplish, and not being too apologetic about 
their change in direction.  In the user testimonials section, the chief 
software architect says that he only has less than 2 years under his 
belt, so maybe they were honest mistakes. But some of them look really bad.

Anyway, they seem to get everyone angry at them at one time or the 
other. But after a while, they do listen to a degree.

&gt; correct me if I'm wrong, but I sure haven't seen Lindows giving 
&gt; *anything* back to the open source community.  At least the commercial 
&gt; wine guys (codeweavers, transgaming) do give back a hell of a lot.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there going to be a GPL copy of your distrib (I'm assuming you guys 
&gt; have finished it now?)... would be interesting to look at.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I've not tried "click and run", however I'm not sure how this has any
&gt;&gt; benefit over installing a tool such as "kpackager" or "synaptic",
&gt;&gt; connecting to the Internet and twiddling your thumbs depending on how
&gt;&gt; fast your Internet connection is.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; And "click'n'run" costs money.
