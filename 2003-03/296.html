Dave,

I didn't set relayhost to anything because I saw this in the readme files:

"If you're behind a firewall, you should set up a relayhost."

But my machine is right on the net. 
It is itself my main mail server which is specified in the MX
records for all the other machines.

My guess is that the relayhost parameter is used for _outgoing_ mail,
in this case from the postfix software itself to send the bounced message to
the from-address.

In the main.cf file, it says this:

# The relayhost parameter specifies the default host to send mail to
# when no entry is matched in the optional transport(5) table. When
# no relayhost is given, mail is routed directly to the destination.

It looks like the postfix "smtp" process is trying to bounce the mail
back through the "smtpd" process on the same machine.
As you say, this would happen if I set up "relayhost" to point to myself.
But the above note claims that if no relayhost is given, then the
bounce mail should go directly to the destination, which is exactly what
happen with all mail which I send myself from "dog.topology.org".

It's only this exploit-mail which is somehow tricking postfix into
sending mail in this curious way from process to process until it gets to
the bogus from-address.
(Now I can see the advantage of sendmail being a single-process MTA as opposed to
this complicated network of processes in the postfix software.)

It looks like I've got two problems then:

1.	Instead of bouncing directly to the original SMTP client,
	the "smtp" process is bouncing to the bogus from-address.
2.	Instead of bouncing to the bogus from-address directly,
	the "smtp" process is relaying it via the "smtpd" process
	on the same mail-server machine.

None of the README files seem to give enough detail to figure this out.
Further study of the online documents, the main.cf comments, the README
files and the man-manuals doesn't yield anything comprehensible to me.

What I'm really looking for is:
How do I make postfix send bounce messages to the SMTP client - not the from-address.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
