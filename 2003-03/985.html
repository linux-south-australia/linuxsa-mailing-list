ANNOUNCEMENT

The Public availabilty of-

iptrk- A promiscuous IP packet tracker for networks
Copyright (C) 2000-2003 Jason Nunn &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jsno@arafura.net.au">jsno@arafura.net.au</A>&gt;
Originally Written as a commercial product for Arafura Connect 
Perl scripts written by Peter Green &lt;<A HREF="mailto:peter@arafura.net.au">peter@arafura.net.au</A>&gt;


I am releasing Arafura Connects commercial flagship as GPL software. This
has been agreed to under the current Management. This is the heart of our
ISP and RadioLAN operation. Without it, we would be unable to track static
network connections for billing, detect hackers doing nasty stuff to our
equipment (a weekly happening), detect equipment outages, unusual traffic,
and various viruses that wrath havoc on our (and customers) networks.

What started in December 2000 as a hack to trace a hacker (who at the time
costed the company $3000 in traffic), has grown into a very powerful tool.
Many thousands of hours has gone into this project. It has slowly evolved
into a very powerful networking instrument. I trust you will find this
program of great value in your organisation.

Please don't be discouraged by the lack of documentation and difficulty in
installation. It's a rock solid program with 1000's of hours of up time.  
It runs under the most heavy hacker attacks.

So, bare in mind (when you are pulling your hair out trying to install it
;), that it's an internal project that has only be made available to the
public. Documentation will be scarce for a while !. Patience !.
