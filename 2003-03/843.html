&gt; 
&gt; yeah i realize that, and most of what i listed wasn't specific to KDE, i was 
&gt; quite aware of that...

so why did you claim it to be?
 
&gt; but i was really answering the previous post.
&gt; notice the first line of my post, it said:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Just copying the look'n'feel of Windows isn't innovation IMHO :-)
&gt; 
&gt; I just wanted to clarify that kde isnt just a windows clone (nor are most 
&gt; linux WM's / DE's).

Nope, but it is pretty close.  If you read my post you'll see I wasn't
specifically targeting KDE, but Linux desktops in general.  You KDE guys
get pretty sensitive! :-)

And from another post:
&gt; Gnome 2 is nice too....but lacking in features.  I like it and have 
&gt; used it in the past, but i missed kde's rich feature set and groovy
&gt; eye candy so i switched back again.... (does the 'ability to choose'
&gt; qualify as 'innovation'?).

Not just sensitive but can't wait for a chance to put down other desktop
projects.  *sigh*

&gt; The basic functionality is very similar but kde has a lot of its own.

KDE, Gnome, Enlightenment all have their own distinctive features, but
not much is innovation.  A lot is cross-copied.  From all of them.

&gt; As a linux desktop user, eye candy and other niceties are very important in my 
&gt; books.

Eye candy is nice.  Important.  But it's fundamentally the same
interface that Xerox PARC had.
