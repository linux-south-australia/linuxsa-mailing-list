It's not going to get any better. Debian really sucks for getting a 
workable system from install. Its only real advantage is that it tends 
to install what you asked for, so you're free to modify configuration 
files without stomping on some distro specific "feature". Even this 
advantage is eaten away by the braindead packaging system that Debian 
insists on using, which depends on a library of archived details rather 
than examining the live filesystem.

I cannot recommend Debian. It sucks, plain and simple.

If you want Debian's features, I'd suggest you look at Gentoo or some 
other distribution where the entire system is compiled from source. Or 
if you want the system built for you, have a look at SuSE, Mandrake or 
some other "friendly" distro where you don't get to make any changes 
without incurring the wrath of the braindead rpm packaging systems they 
use.

The bottom line is that Linux is not in a good state when it comes to 
distributions. Everything sucks in one major way or another. I really 
miss the system I built up by hand, but KDE and Gnome are ridiculously 
hard to compile, and Miguel's slavish devotion to imitating Microsoft 
have brought along the delights of Microsoftian cruft to the Linux 
world.

That's why I got a Mac, and OS X rocks.
