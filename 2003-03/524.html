&gt; In summary:  If you want to produce jazzy content with animation, 
&gt; sound effects, full-on user interaction, and all the bells and whistles,
&gt; then by all means run away to your Flash authoring suite and go for your
&gt; life.

But being a Linux user, wouldn't you be able to prefer to support such
things?  You may choose not to run flash, but what about when you can't?
An article I once followed when trying to install flash told me not to go
to the shockwave.com website, or Mozilla would crash.  Of course, I did,
and sure enough it crashed!

The problem here was that the plugin was written by some unknown, and not
by Macromedia.  It was unstable and buggy, and there is just no version
available for my OS/Browser combination that is supported.

&gt; But if you're going to use Flash for something as mundane and essential
&gt; as a navigation menu (especially if it's the only navigation menu you 
&gt; plan to provide), then think seriously about what you're doing any why
&gt; you're doing it.  Perhaps, just perhaps, it's the completely wrong tool
&gt; for the job.

What about when it's the right tool?  Sure, navigation is questionable, but
then there are those websites that I simply could never visit, just because
of lack of support, and they're designed with Flash for a reason, not just
because they can be.  And i'm talking about games/cartoons -- that kind of
thing.  Not necessarily the front end of a big corporate website -- I'm
talking about all the crud that fills the Internet ;P

On a similar note:

I went to the BankSA website and I had no java-vm.  Mozilla led me to a
page which would let me install it, but of course without my root
privileges, I wasn't able to.  Is the next course of action to load mozilla
with root privileges whilst running X?

Why wouldn't the authors of Mozilla write their plugin installations in
such a way that accommodates Unix users, allowing them to install the
plugin and allow Mozilla "on the fly" privileges to install the package by
prompting the user (assuming all the basic rules were met -- the user was
in the wheel group and knew the root password.)

Does this kind of functionality lead to turning Mozilla into what Internet
Explorer has become by way of Active/X plugins, Gator/GAIN, or those
wonderful "unsigned" program installation dialogue boxes that come up
whenever you visit a crack website?

I don't want my Mozilla to turn into that, but I do want it to work.  Now
that I can't dynamically install the plugin, I have to figure out a way of
getting around this trivial matter, either by trying to locate the correct
item in my ports, doing a search on google, or trying some other method of
installing the plugin (by way of finding out what it downloaded and seeing
if I can install it manually or something.)

Even though I love unix for the fact that I have so much control over my
system, and so much flexibility, I find some of the lack of automation
irritating.  But it's getting better.

Like sands through the hourglass . . .
