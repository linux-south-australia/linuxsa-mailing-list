&gt; Thanks for the hint.  I've tried this, and after about 5 minutes
&gt; managed to understand what it wanted (the help button doesn't work).

Just choose the event you want to have a shortcut for, click the "Custom" 
radio button, then press the key combination you want. Done. Oh, and help 
worked for me and was more helpful than any help you would find on a windows 
box.

There is a problem with setting key combinations for a lot of things, I've had 
programs (e.g sim-icq) hijack certain key bindings and so while I was in a 
completely separate program I couldn't do what I wanted because sim-icq 
intercepted the key bindings first.

&gt; As far as I can tell, I can only use a key combination: it doesn't
&gt; understand mouse buttons in combination.  This makes it useless, since
&gt; Emacs already uses all key combinations.

I believe people are working on mouse gestures for window managers. Only a 
matter of time until Kwin gets that functionality. IIRC somebody was already 
hacking kwin (not part of official tree) to try out some of these ideas, e.g. 
holding down one of the mouse buttons and drawing an N would launch netscape 
(or mozilla). Personally I wouldn't use mouse gestures (I don't use them in 
opera, so why would I anywhere else), but it'd be good for people who like 
that sort of thing.

Damien
