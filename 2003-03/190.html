Hi Alan,

to fix your sendmail issues why dont you try out qmail (www.qmail.org).
Its a bit different, but it is secure, stable and fast. Also his DNS
package is also ment to be very good, I just havent had a chance to look
at it yet!

Cheers,

Ben.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, but do the local mirrors?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mirroring and Red Hat.  Feel the pain....  We poll the mirror
&gt; &gt; servers every four hours, and it's still not on mirror.aarnet.
&gt; &gt; Arrrgh.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The URL in the Errata notice works and performance is OK.

&gt; At 02:20 (UTC+1030) on Wed 5 March 2003, sendmail 8.12.8 is not yet
&gt; available at <A HREF="http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sendmail/">http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/sendmail/</A>
&gt; although I grabbed it from 
&gt; <A HREF="ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.8.tar.gz</A>
&gt; at 15:43 (UTC+1030), Tue 4 March.
&gt; That's not a complaint, of course. Just a comment to lead me into
&gt; this little ramble....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I've had it with sendmail!!
&gt; That's the last straw!!!
&gt; Sendmail is wearing out my exclamation key!!!!
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway....
&gt; That security scare on sendmail yesterday sounded so urgent,
&gt; I immediately downloaded the latest sendmail and tried to install
&gt; it on top of my SuSE 7.1 installation.
&gt; Unfortunately, every sendmail configuration is differently wierd.
&gt; And sendmail has changed a fair bit (not backwards compatibly) since 8.11.x.
&gt; (Now you've got to create a user+group smmsp, and fiddle with all
&gt; the file owners/permissions, and move the alias files and config files,
&gt; and the readme files form a small network in themselves!)
&gt; 
&gt; After about 5 hours of trying to figure out the new "features" of
&gt; sendmail, I just gave up and downloaded postfix instead.
&gt; 
&gt; Result: bliss!
&gt; Postfix is easier to get going for a complete postfix beginner than
&gt; sendmail is for someone who's been using it since the 1980s.
&gt; Not only that, postfix has all the features I've been wanting for
&gt; many years:
&gt; -	separate access lists (to block spam) for
&gt; 	-	the SMTP client
&gt; 	-	the SMTP To-address (before aliasing)
&gt; 	-	the STMP Form-address
&gt; 	-	the mail header
&gt; 	-	the mail body
&gt; 	(sendmail only offers the first 3 in a combined db, I think)
&gt; -	human-readable config files instead of sendmail.cf gobbledygook
&gt; -	comprehensible documentation
&gt; 
&gt; Question:
&gt; Can anyone tell me if I'm going to miss out on anything by changing
&gt; over the postfix?
&gt; If my perception is right, then there's no need for sendmail to 
&gt; hang around any more. It should go the museum of 1980s memorabilia.
&gt; If there's ever a software museum of the 20th century, one of the
&gt; hands-on exhibits could be a unix computer with sendmail.
&gt; The task - to modify the sendmail.cf file to achieve a specified objective.
&gt; Smelling salts and counselling should be available, of course.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
&gt;

&gt; attempt are summarised here:
