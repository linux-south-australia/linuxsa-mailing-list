&gt; &gt; That's true.

&gt; Not really - we have over 1TB on one Linux machine that serves it's data 
&gt; through another Linux machine running samba by using NFS (us *nix users 
&gt; just NFS mount it *g*).

Correct. Not really a lot. My test shelf, which is about 5U high, has 
1.2TB in it. We took the same size shelf to Connectathon. It has 3.9TB in 
it. A whole 19" rack would have 30TB in it. 

Storage sizes are growing and storage companies are aiming for prices of 
several cents per MB, all up for the lot. I think one of the on-line 
magazines pointed out that Spinnacher was aiming at 2-3c/MB. Figure at 
less than AUD0.06 per MB, or AUD60/GB (including all the infrastructure, 
like GigE, power supplies, GigE switch, software, etc). I am sure you can 
figure the cost of 1TB which will, in some cases, fit in 5U of space, and 
do NFS, CIFS, NFSv4, NDMP, parallel IO (aggregate bandwidth per shelf of 
say 300MB/s), snapshots, ACLs, etc.  

However, some of the gov't labs make outrageous demands, like multiple 
GB/s read and write IO bandwidth for Linux clusters. The cost of the 
Extreme BlackDiamond switches becomes a big part of the equation then, but 
they can certainly shift the data.
