<PRE>
&gt; This isn't designed to be flamebait, but we've all seen in 
&gt; the media claims that Open Source rarely innovates, but 
&gt; typically just copies innovation by others. Whether that's 
&gt; true or not is really irrelevant, but I was hoping that 
&gt; people could pass on some of the areas where they think Open 
&gt; Source software is and has been innovative (preferably stuff 
&gt; that's happened over the last couple of years).

The answer I've seen most often to this is something of a cop-out. Open
Source IS the innovation. The business models built around it are
innovations. The community is an innovation.

Most technical innovations I've seen cited tend to be cut down by
someone quoting some commercial software (popular or not) that did it
earlier. Even if that's not the case, usually, it's been done by some
PhD student in the 80s, well before it's been done commercially or in
open source. Perhaps the real innovations that happen in software
(commercial or not) are in the packaging, implementation and
popularisation of pre-existing ideas?
