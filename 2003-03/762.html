&gt;&gt; Hey all,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; This isn't designed to be flamebait, but we've all seen in the media
&gt;&gt; claims that Open Source rarely innovates, but typically just copies
&gt;&gt; innovation by others. Whether that's true or not is really irrelevant,
&gt;&gt; but I was hoping that people could pass on some of the areas where they
&gt;&gt; think Open Source software is and has been innovative (preferably stuff
&gt;&gt; that's happened over the last couple of years).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; thx,

&gt; Sireous answer:
&gt;
&gt; Debian's APT.
&gt; Its an innovation to have software delivered, rather than picked up.

And on the flip side,  what mind baffling scientific wonders has 
Microsoft come up with?

Its too easy to think of what they copy.

Here is a golden example.

Shame, shame, shame (That's so David doesn't have to do it....) :-D

Ok....

There is a web site called Dr. Dobb's Technetcast.

Here is a page full of software technicians that view themselves as 
scientists somewhat, ding their work to INNOVATE and create open 
standards.  But their is one oddball in the group that gave an 
interview, and he was from MICROSOFT.

If you listen to the one guy from MICROSOFT you will figure out that his 
job was to take the INNOVATIONS from the convention and turn them into 
Microsoft proprietary formats.

A real life example of the opposite of what is being said....
