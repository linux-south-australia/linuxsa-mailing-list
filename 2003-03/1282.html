Hmm. Im using a toshiba satelite pro right now, sitting out in my
greenhouse :) Ive recently wired cat 5 down here from the house. Cost me
less than 1 wireless card, and goes approx 10 times as fast, and with no
security concerns other than someone sneaking in to my yard and tapping
the cable! Anyway this toshi seems to spin down after not very long. I
havnt measured it though. Its not spinnig now, but Im actually running
NT4, with Xwin 5, and using it as a remote x server for apps running on
my main pc inside the house.This means that disk access is rare.
Unfortunatly I have to run NT4 to get any decent speed out of the laptop
because its got one of those sis video chipsets with poor performance
under linux due to lack of specs or drivers from sis. Anyway, I find it
wierd that yours would spin down that much. Did you check the bios? It
sounds like you've been pretty thourour, but you didnt mention it. I
think there is usually options for spin down in there. The fact it does
it off AC is a bit of a giveaway that its a fault tho. Toshiba make good
quality products (generally) but linux support is a bit hit and miss
with some of their chosen chips.

&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; First let me introduce myself as I'm new to the list.  I'm 24 and a
&gt; programmer at Stratco.  I finished a Bsc of Comp. Science at Flinders Uni in
&gt; 1999 and am a keen Linux user ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; I do apologise coming straight in and asking a question, but it is very
&gt; important to me and is quite urgent:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In late February I bought a Toshiba 1110 laptop.  Right from the beginning I
&gt; noticed the hard drive would spin down every now and then after only 30
&gt; seconds of inactivity.  I didn't pay enough attention to this early on as I
&gt; was focused on the regularly crashing ATi Mobility Radeon M6 drivers
&gt; (beware, this chipset is awful).
&gt; 
&gt; Despite all the Power Management settings in WinXP being set to Never spin
&gt; the drive down, every day or two the HDD would spin down after just 30
&gt; seconds of inactivity, over and over again.  Nothing would make it stop
&gt; doing this, and it didn't matter whether the laptop was running on battery
&gt; or AC power.  Sure, the drive spins back up again when accessed but this
&gt; introduces a 2 second delay that stops whatever the PC is doing (including
&gt; playing DVDs).  It also can't be doing much good for the drive itself.
&gt; 
&gt; I returned the laptop to Harvey Norman on the 8th of March with the crashing
&gt; drivers and spinning down HDD problem.  It went down to BMS Technology who
&gt; claimed they saw the fault and fixed it (despite the service report saying
&gt; _no fault found_).  I got the laptop back on the 20th and was dismayed that
&gt; the HDD spinning down fault was still there.  At this stage I decided to
&gt; deal with Simon Glassenbury at BMS Technology personally, instead of playing
&gt; Chinese Whispers with Harvey Norman.  Simon is the main technician who takes
&gt; care of Toshibas at BMS.  He has so far been courteous and professional in
&gt; his dealings with me.
&gt; 
&gt; Simon agreed that this is a problem and should be fixed (March 21), but
&gt; later when he consulted with the technicians in Sydney (March 28) they said
&gt; the constantly spinning down HDD is a _standard feature_ on all Toshiba
&gt; laptops.  This doesn't make any sense.  Why would the laptop make the HDD
&gt; spin down so often, especially when running on AC power?  To make sure, I
&gt; grabbed the Intel Application Accelerator utility and modified the Advanced
&gt; Power Management settings in the HDD itself (this made no difference).  Thus
&gt; I'm sure it's not a software setting anywhere causing the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend recently relayed to me the information that his cousin had the same
&gt; HDD problem on his Toshiba and managed to get a refund.  Toshiba phone tech
&gt; support in Australia said "that's the first I've heard of it" and Toshiba
&gt; USA agreed on their forums that it is a fault.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone else experienced this on their Toshiba laptop?  (or another
&gt; laptop which uses Toshiba drives, such as Dell?)  Does anyone think this is
&gt; a 'standard feature' to keep spinning down the drive even when not requested
&gt; to?  There are no PM settings in the BIOS either.
&gt; 
&gt; I will install Linux on this machine if (when?) it's running properly.  If I
&gt; install it now Toshiba will just blame Linux for the problems and leave it
&gt; at that.  I'm deliberatly using their WinXP setup with almost no third party
&gt; software installed.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt; THank you,
