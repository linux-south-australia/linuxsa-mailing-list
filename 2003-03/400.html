&gt; "BAN PHON KHAM, Laos (AP) -- Villagers in this remote jungle hamlet have lived 
&gt; for years without electricity or telephones, relying on occasional visitors 
&gt; and a sluggish postal system for news of the outside world. 
&gt; But soon many of its residents will be jumping on stationary bikes to pedal 
&gt; their way onto the Information Superhighway. 
&gt; Custom-built computers -- running on bicycle-powered generators -- will 
&gt; transport villagers from rice fields to chat rooms and Web sites worldwide. 
&gt; They'll be able to monitor rice and vegetable prices, sell handicrafts and 
&gt; e-mail relatives. "

That's a pretty cool idea, but it looks like hard work...

The pic of Tavee Pularmjit pedalling such a generator seems to show
that it is driven by a fairly small-diameter shaft turned by friction
from the back tyre. Most of your energy is gonna go in heating the
tyre up. (Compare how long it takes a bottle dynamo and a hub dynamo
to bring the wheel to a halt.)

Would it not be much better to unhook the chain from the rear sprocket
and hook it over a sprocket attached directly to the generator? 

Power available: 100W more or less indefinitely, 700W sprint (ie.
roughly 1hp) (with me pedalling). So a laptop's OK, a desktop more
awkward and would definitely need a more efficient drive system.

There doesn't seem to be an email address on the page I could send
such a suggestion to. You wouldn't happen to know one?
