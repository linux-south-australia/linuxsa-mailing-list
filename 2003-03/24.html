&gt; These are just a few comments/queries on IPv6 for linux.
&gt; Seeing as it's Saturday night, why not...
&gt;
&gt; Sometimes some people on this list do mention the possibility
&gt; of using IPv6 on their linux box - particularly connecting
&gt; up to the 6bone or some such IPv6 backbone.
&gt;
&gt; My question is whether there are in fact some people here
&gt; on linuxSA running IPv6 on linux.
&gt;

I am.  Also on OpenBSD, Win2k and MacOS X (10.2.x)

&gt; What prompted my query is this little news item:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/">http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/</A>
&gt; showArticle.jhtml?articleID=7400069
&gt;
&gt; The above article talks about "Enhancements to IPv6" by the evil one.
&gt; I gather they mean enhancements to their _implementation_ of IPv6
&gt; rather than the protocol itself. (In the MS world, the distinction
&gt; between protocols and software does not exist.)
&gt; But if the forces of evil are advancing in IPv6, it makes me think
&gt; that the forces of good must get going quick also.
&gt; Otherwise "they" _will_ change the protocols.
&gt; Enough of philosophy....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; When I tried a couple of years ago to determine how to connect
&gt; up to the 6bone in Adelaide or some such network, I couldn't easily
&gt; work out how to do it.
&gt; I'd be interested to know if there are people using it in earnest.
&gt;

Use 6to4 tunnelling (unless your ISP supports IPv6 - mine doesn't).

The absolutely easiest way to setup a tunnel is to go to
www.freenet6.net and follow the instructions.
&gt;
&gt; Recently there was an announcement of this IPv6 version of Slashdot:
&gt; <A HREF="http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/">http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/</A>
&gt; I can't even get my DNS to translate this to anything sensible.
&gt; (It's a CNAME to some undefined domain name apparently.)
&gt; This seems to suggest that to get IPv6 going, there are many tasks
&gt; along the way:
&gt; 1	Get IPv6 to go over my Internet connection.
&gt; 2	Get IPv6 going in my DNS.
&gt; 3	Get an IPv6 gateway to connect to with IPv6-inIPv4 encapsulation.
&gt;
&gt; I guess 1 and 3 are alternatives.
&gt; But I can't even get IPv6 going from one end of my home office to the
&gt; other.
&gt;

You may also want to look at radvd (the Route ADVertisement Daemon)
which once configured advertises routes and prefixes to other machines
on the wire, who, due to the coolness of IPv6, automatically assign
themselves EUI addresses from that prefix.


&gt; By the way, this is my set of links for IPv6:
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.topology.org/comms/ip.html">http://www.topology.org/comms/ip.html</A>#ipv6
&gt; I know there's a heap of info out there.
&gt; But I was sort of hoping to avoid the hard work and stress which always
&gt; occurs when I try to work out something from all the howto documents
&gt; on the net.
&gt; It's always much easier to just ask someone who has got something
&gt; working
&gt; how they did it.
&gt;

I followed the IPv6+Linux HOWTO.
