actually, websites can *never* write to files on your HD, unless it's a 
(major) security hole[1].

what actually happens with mozilla's prefs.js is that it gets read on 
startup, and gets written on shutdown, every time. so if something 
happens and mozilla screws up somehow, it can write out a corrupt 
prefs.js file on shutdown, thus screwing up your settings. there's a bug 
filed on this currently ( 
&lt;<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id</A>=17053&gt; ) that should be 
fixed before the 1.3 release. (checks bugzilla...) in fact, it's fixed 
now. fantastic.

&gt; Although I have seen this on 
&gt; Netscape. You will find that an older prefs.bak may do just fine. 
&gt; Otherwise, some people just rename their unique directory that is under 
&gt; .mozilla and they see a performance boost. If you make the file read 
&gt; only,then people can't set bookmarks.

i'm not quite sure why this would be - the bookmarks are actually stored 
on the bookmarks.html file under your mozilla profile dir.

&gt; As a side note, its my opinion, that Mozilla has two major flaws to it. 
&gt; 1) a configuration file exposed to the Internet (prefs.js)

i'm pretty sure this isn't actually true.

&gt; 2) trying to turn the browser into an application engine

this is a slightly valid accusation - mozilla-the-platform has probably 
detracted from mozilla-as-purely-a-browser. but, look at the massive 
positive outcomes - there's gecko-based browsers for almost every 
platform (mozilla itself being one of them), the multitude of projects 
at mozdev.org, heck, there's even an IDE based on the mozilla platform. 
pretty impressive for what was ostensibly a "browser".

then again, netscape has always been focussed on being more than just a 
browser. that's why MS went after them in the first place, they 
threatened the proprietary-mess of windows with a generic interface.

James, if you really want a mozilla that is just a browser, phoenix 
(soon to be renamed) could be the go for you. it's a browser-only app, 
no bloat, and fast. it's pretty good.

[1] there was a somewhat famous case of the MS IE javascript engine 
allowing a malicious script to overwrite any arbitrary file on your 
machine - including the krnl32.dll (or whatever the windows kernel 
library is called) just by visiting a page. scary.
