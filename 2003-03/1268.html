thank you mike for having a look at it ;).

this is what opensource is all about.. 
having an idea to improve something, and
then having it proven or disproven ;)

could you give me the url of that file, so
i can fault it ? ;)

nb/ http is a complicated monster. there
will be problems with jigg.

jigg is what people call an "alpha release"--
it's hot off the press !! ;).

and when i looked at the squid code last
year and saw all the little microsoft
hacks to make squid these web browsers,
it made my hair stand up on the back of my
neck ;).

oh.. one thing i should mention...

when it goes to compress response
content... please note that jigg
has to grab "all" content before it
can compress it and then send it to
your client.

which means there is going to
be a period where your browser
reports no progress..

i can't figure out a any way to
incrementally send compressed
content, as compression involves
a revamp of the response header
including values as content size,
which you can only know when you
have compressed something ;) ;) ;).

i'm still working on this problem..
maybe a pre-auto-pulling page
can be sent first the notifies
of a compressed image ??.

&gt; Good questions :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'm playing with it right now, there is a bug with it. I was unable to
do a
&gt; download of winamp from the winamp site with IE 5.5 pointed at it as a
&gt; proxy.
