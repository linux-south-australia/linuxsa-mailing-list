Robyn,

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;I'm not sure if it was the mail server the linux box that had the lock
&gt;file.

In this instance it would be the server.  The RFC covering POP requires that
the server "lock" the main file during a POP session.  These will eventually
(after anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour) time out and clear themselves.

&gt;The comment by Outlook Express that it couldn't open because it was
&gt;already running is that it found a lock file which was supposed to be
&gt;cleaned up when Outlook Express closes. 'Cause the previous Outlook
&gt;Express was killed the lock file remained.
&gt;
&gt;Can someone else comment on that please, where you'd find those lock
&gt;files and what could they be called?

Most windows apps that do this don't use lock files, and instead examine the
process list and look for other instances of themselves.  I occasionally see
instances of this using Outlook where an old instance is still in memory and
showing no UI, but Outlook refuses to start because the previous instance is
still running.  In NT (i.e.. NT4, 2000, and XP) going to the "Processes" tab
in Task Manager (rather than the normal "Applications" tab) and killing the
process from there usually helps.  I've also seen 9x systems believe that an
application is still running after its been forcibly closed, and there's
nothing other than a reboot that will fix that.

Jim.
