Well, we have a whole week ahead of us 'till the weekend, so here is 
some drama that may get the blood flowing.  (Mine is @ 350/250 right now...)

********************************************************************************************************************

A few days ago some of the Lindows customers noticed that a new game, 
Marble Blast, suddenly was not on their computer any more.

The explanation from the President of the Company was:

&gt; The uninstall was a mistake on our end. As I posted, we are building a 
&gt; refund system where you can choose to get a refund and have a product 
&gt; uninstalled. This sort of ran away with itself here. When we introduce 
&gt; this, it will be a very cool thing for users and vendors alike, as 
&gt; they will be able to offer FULL products for demos, with a money-back 
&gt; guarantee.
&gt;
&gt; One difference between us and MS. We have 50 people trying to make an 
&gt; OS work and we lose money every month doing it. Sorry we don't have 
&gt; the resources to do it perfectly. 



Then the discussion began:


&gt; from the publish page &lt;<A HREF="http://info.lindows.com/publish/publisher.html&gt">http://info.lindows.com/publish/publisher.html&gt</A>;:
&gt;
&gt; we even have a Digital Rights Management API (DRM) where, by embedding 
&gt; a tiny bit of code in the program, the software developer can have 
&gt; their program call to check with our Click-N-Buy server to make sure 
&gt; an authorized user is running the program.
&gt;
&gt; imho this is worst than Windoze big brother...
&gt;
&gt; :-( 


A customer:

&gt; This is my current understanding of the Lindows.com tracking and 
&gt; profiling system:
&gt;
&gt; When you sign up with Lindows.com you are issued a membership number 
&gt; such as 103942794424199 (I of course changed some of the numbers).
&gt;
&gt; This membership number is tied to your email address, real address, 
&gt; credit card info, etc. There is no way to use Click-N-Run without 
&gt; giving Lindows.com all of this information.
&gt;
&gt; Each computer that you install LOS on is assigned a unique machine 
&gt; number that is stored on your hard drive and associated with your 
&gt; membership number.
&gt;
&gt; When you startup LindowsOS, Click-N-Run starts automatically, phones 
&gt; home, and checks your 'machine number' (and presumably your IP 
&gt; address) to make sure your 'membership number' does not have too many 
&gt; 'machine numbers' running or listed. If there are too many your CNR 
&gt; login is shut down and you have to call support.
&gt;
&gt; A list of all software that you have ever installed from Click-N-Run 
&gt; is kept by Lindows.com and organized by 
&gt; membershipNumber/machineNumber/softwareApp. Lindows.com promises that 
&gt; they will keep this list for the rest of your lifetime. So far they 
&gt; have been unwilling to promise that they will never sell or share this 
&gt; list with their 'business partners'. So maybe they will sell your 
&gt; profile some day.
&gt;
&gt; Software you purchase using Click-N-Buy will include embedded code 
&gt; that will phone home to Lindows.com every time you start the software. 
&gt; Lindows.com will check your membershipNumber/machineNumber/softwareApp 
&gt; database and decide if you should be allowed to run the software.
&gt;
&gt; Lindows.com has developed a feature of Click-N-Run that lets them 
&gt; automatically uninstall software from your computer without your 
&gt; approval or knowledge. Because of the uproar this caused they have 
&gt; said that they don't plan on doing this.
&gt;
&gt; The AOL/Netscape web browser is integrated into LindowsOS and is 
&gt; impossibly difficult for the average user to remove.
&gt;
&gt; One of the marketing slogans Lindows.com has used is "no Microsoft 
&gt; Activation codes". With this system they have more control over our 
&gt; computers and our personal information than Microsoft has ever had.
&gt;
&gt; Looks to me like Lindows.com is doing things Microsoft can only dream 
&gt; of doing. If Microsoft set up a system like this they would be 
&gt; crucified by their customers and the press.
&gt;
&gt; This is certainly not what I thought I signed up for when I became an 
&gt; Insider last June. 

A customer

&gt; I have not used CNR since the Marble Blast take it back incident, in 
&gt; hopes to see some clarity and underatanding in it all. It has been a 
&gt; few days of deep analysis and consideration of not only the facts at 
&gt; hand but the general global perspective concerning DRM, software and 
&gt; the Internet.
&gt;
&gt; It is becoming alarmingly apparent that we are seeing the way of the 
&gt; future, after all digital subscriptions give vendors all the controls 
&gt; they need to effectively reduce piracy to almost non existence, as 
&gt; demonstrated by the "take it back" incident. We can hardly blame them 
&gt; for wanting to protect their hard work, and considering the piracy 
&gt; that takes place nowadays, they can certainly justify the need to take 
&gt; EFFECTIVE steps to ensure compliance with the licensing agreement.
&gt;
&gt; As an individual, expectant of certain rights and privacies, we are 
&gt; taken aback by the thought that someone else can gain access to, and 
&gt; add or remove data from our PC. As a business it is downright 
&gt; unacceptable to allow such actions to happen, in that you would risk 
&gt; compromising sensitive or confidential customer records. I cannot 
&gt; imagine ever attaining a level of trust with anyone individual or 
&gt; company to allow them any possible access to my business records.
&gt;
&gt; I am going to consider with more investigation the merits of this 
&gt; digital subscription move that is growing in popularity, but I no 
&gt; longer shocked by it, although I will not use CNR again on anything 
&gt; but my testbed, it is Lindows only, and has no important or personal 
&gt; data on it.
&gt;
&gt; It is not going to away either, I see now they have BIOS intergrated 
&gt; licensing, and Intuit (I think, C_dilla) and other vendors have 
&gt; developed licenced installations that write to the MBR (something LOS 
&gt; seems to change all to often??). I really looks to me like copyright 
&gt; infringement is going to become passe and we can either take it with 
&gt; the licensing hooks or do without.
&gt;
&gt; It is no longer a private world, there are video cameras abound, 
&gt; satellites than can count your nose hairs and digital spying as well. 
&gt; CHOICE, may soon just become the lesser of two evils.
&gt;
&gt; I am numb!


 From a cob:

&gt; I think we need more than a COMMENT !
&gt;
&gt; I dont like this at all !. My computer is like my house, if you dont 
&gt; knock first you dont get in !
&gt;
&gt; I also find it inconceivable that a two bit poxy game can have access 
&gt; through MY provider to MY modem to MY PC at MY expense only to check 
&gt; MY morals ?
&gt;
&gt; Pistooli is correct, Kevin needs to think long and hard before he 
&gt; answers the questions here, but answer these questions he must and soon.
&gt;
&gt; If its the wrong answer I for one will not be logging into CNR again, 
&gt; and without CNR LOS is not much use.
&gt;
&gt; Trust - is a double edge sword, if LOS doesnt trust the user, how can 
&gt; the user trust LOS ?

Who's this clown? :-D

&gt; He's keeping a list....
&gt;
&gt; Checking it twice....
&gt;
&gt; (Sing everybody....!)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Going to find out who's...
&gt;
&gt; naughty and nice....
&gt;
&gt; Ashcroft's claws are coming to town...
&gt;
&gt; He knows when you install a demo...
&gt;
&gt; He knows what you've been reading
&gt;
&gt; So unsubscribe from Playboy for goodness sake!
&gt;
&gt; Ohhhhh.....yooooooou.....better not pout
&gt;
&gt; Ya better not cry.....
&gt;
&gt; Ashcroft's claws are coming to town...
&gt;
Customer:

&gt; I recall I sent a e-mail to Kevin at Lindows.com, about that Marble 
&gt; Blast "Uninstall" Thing. He told me, he already pointed it out. Here 
&gt; is what he said in the forum -
&gt;
&gt; " The uninstall was a mistake on our end. As I posted, we are building 
&gt; a refund system where you can choose to get a refund and have a 
&gt; product uninstalled. This sort of ran away with itself here. When we 
&gt; introduce this, it will be a very cool thing for users and vendors 
&gt; alike, as they will be able to offer FULL products for demos, with a 
&gt; money-back guarantee."
&gt;
&gt; " One difference between us and MS. We have 50 people trying to make 
&gt; an OS work and we lose money every month doing it. Sorry we don't have 
&gt; the resources to do it perfectly. "
&gt;
&gt; "We do not mess with your computers."
&gt;
&gt; "Maybe I shouldn't share so much info with forum users?"
&gt;
&gt; "I'm not "making excuses," I'm telling it like it is. We are FAR from 
&gt; perfect. We are FAR from having the resources to roll things out 
&gt; perfectly. That's the way it is. If you're not interested in helping 
&gt; us test products, you should wait until the official release of 
&gt; products (not the informal one here on the forums) or try us in a year 
&gt; or two when we have more money to build a better system. For now, this 
&gt; is the best we can offer. No excuses, just the reality. "
&gt;
&gt; " We have no knowledge of what you have installed on your computer 
&gt; unless it came from our servers, so we certainly couldn't remove it." 


The President responds!

&gt; imho this is worst than Windoze big brother...
&gt;
&gt; We have to have a copy protection option available to get certain 
&gt; commercial programs in the Warehouse. A good example is Sims, which 
&gt; we're working on with EA and Transgaming. Sims uses a "key CD," but 
&gt; because we want the warehouse to be a 100% digital distribution 
&gt; system, we give software vendors an option if they feel they must have 
&gt; some sort of copy protection. If you like digital distribution, then 
&gt; our approach is required since it doesn't use annoying USB keys, 
&gt; unlock CDs, authorization codes, etc. Our approach is very simple, as 
&gt; it works with the existing warehouse membership login process. It's a 
&gt; tiny bit of code that simply checks to see if the person has purchased 
&gt; the program. The only data it returns is a simple "yes" or "no," and 
&gt; it only returns that info to the program, not the vendor. So, this is 
&gt; hardly "Big Brother."
&gt;
&gt; Like it or not, if you want to use the software from certain 
&gt; commercial vendors (particularly games), they'll require this. If we 
&gt; didn't offer it, then LindowsOS users wouldn't get access to these 
&gt; programs. If you don't like programs that use it, simply don't 
&gt; Click-N-Run those programs, but those who do want them should have 
&gt; that option. We don't want LindowsOS users to be limited in their 
&gt; software choices.
&gt;
&gt; ...if they make it to easy they won't get any publishers with their 
&gt; program.
&gt;
&gt; Correct. It's hard enough convincing commercial software vendors to 
&gt; port to Linux and also to trust a 100% digital distribution method as 
&gt; is, so we need to provide this option.
&gt;
&gt; I'd rather have it limited to my Library in the CNR warehouse, so they 
&gt; don't "invade" my privacy and my machine with this software.
&gt;
&gt; As I said, it's a simple API that the commercial program you're trying 
&gt; to run calls to get a simple "yes" or "no" response as to if it's a 
&gt; licensed copy or not. No data is passed to the software vendor or even 
&gt; to us for that matter.
&gt;
&gt; Will the products still work if we are off line or does it have to 
&gt; phone home before it is usable?
&gt;
&gt; That's up to the software vendor. If a program required anything 
&gt; special like this, we'll try to clearly list this on the product page 
&gt; (I'm not aware that MarbleBlast requires this, that would be total 
&gt; news to me if it did. I'll look into this.) Again, we don't control 
&gt; this, the software vendors get to choose. We can't force those with 
&gt; proprietary software to do something they don't want to do. I suppose 
&gt; we could boycott their software, but then say good-bye to having a lot 
&gt; of the games and other Linux software ever being available via 
&gt; Click-N-Run.
&gt;
&gt; I'd rather have a serial or CD-Key
&gt;
&gt; This is for those who want a totally digital system. If you like the 
&gt; old, traditional way, I'm sure most of these software companies will 
&gt; still be selling their software like that for some time yet.
&gt;
&gt; I agree Lindows.com should not be doing this.
&gt;
&gt; It's not our choice. This is something AE and other commercial 
&gt; software companies insist on. It's not like LindowsOS is in a position 
&gt; to be telling much much larger companies how to run their businesses. 
&gt; Again, simply don't buy these products if you don't support them. But 
&gt; please don't ask us to deny those who want to be able to have access 
&gt; to these programs.
&gt;
&gt; It's hard enough asking software vendors to support Linux as is. They 
&gt; see it as only about open source and they don't want to port their 
&gt; programs to Linux because they fear there is no market for it. Not 
&gt; offering some basic protection for them only makes selling Linux to 
&gt; these vendors even more difficult.
&gt;
&gt; Kevin
&gt;

A customer.....note the mention of encrypted debs licensed under the GPL.

&gt; Kevin,
&gt;
&gt; This stuff really makes me angry. Your protection is a two step 
&gt; process already and I don't have a problem with that.
&gt;
&gt; 1. The .cnr is encrypted so it can not be installed without CNR thus 
&gt; not transferable to someone that doesn't have a CNR account.
&gt; 2. CNR has to approve the installation of the software, making sure 
&gt; the users account has a valid license or membership to install the 
&gt; program.
&gt;
&gt; No software vendor requires you to make a system that checks the 
&gt; program every time it is run. I will boycott it, but I'm talking about 
&gt; boycotting the program doing the checking. Guess who's program that is?
&gt;
&gt; "If you like digital distribution, then our approach is required since 
&gt; it doesn't use annoying USB keys, unlock CDs, authorization codes, etc."
&gt;
&gt; That was your choice, not ours or the vendors.
&gt;
&gt; "Like it or not, if you want to use the software from certain 
&gt; commercial vendors (particularly games), they'll require this."
&gt;
&gt; Let's get this straight. You are requiring it, the vendor is not.
&gt;
&gt; "If we didn't offer it, then LindowsOS users wouldn't get access to 
&gt; these programs."
&gt;
&gt; Yes we would. If the vendor wanted additional protection above and 
&gt; beyond the two step process already in place we would just get "USB 
&gt; keys, unlock CDs, authorization codes, etc." as you say.
&gt;
&gt; "We don't want LindowsOS users to be limited in their software choices."
&gt;
&gt; As if they would be limited without this thing.
&gt;
&gt; "No data is passed to the software vendor or even to us for that matter."
&gt;
&gt; Looking better, but I still don't like this thing nor do I think it is 
&gt; neccessary.
&gt;
&gt; Do we have a choice to kill this thing and get a authorization code if 
&gt; we would rather have that or is CNR not about our choice?
&gt;
&gt; If you tell me to get it from outside of CNR like you just stated. 
&gt; I'll do just that and get everything outside of CNR and I mean 
&gt; everything.
&gt;
&gt; Anything I do for my personal use with a program after it is installed 
&gt; is my business. CNR is checking on me after I've made a legitimate 
&gt; purchase and installation. I won't stand for it.


Ok, that's a good snapshot of the thoughts going on in people's heads.

This is _not positive_. :-(
