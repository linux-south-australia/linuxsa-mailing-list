&gt;&gt; you can point to the much higher "membership" of LinuxSA, but that's

&gt;&gt; &lt;out on a limb&gt;
&gt;&gt; When you look at it objectively, it doesn't really make sense to have
&gt;&gt; both AUUG and Linux organizations.  Logically, we're the same group of
&gt;&gt; people.  On the other hand, I know that a number of LinuxSA people
&gt;&gt; look on us as "opposition".  This is unfortunate, since we're all
&gt;&gt; pointing in (roughly) the same direction.  It would be nice for us to
&gt;&gt; come closer together, and I'd welcome suggestions about how to do
&gt;&gt; that.
&gt;&gt; &lt;/out on a limb&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I think you answered your own question.  To join AUUG (and thereafter form a
&gt; SIG) would cost each member of the SIG $110 pa.  I think we need some kind of
&gt; associate membership relating to the SIG(s) only. eg becoming a member of the
&gt; LinuxSA SIG would involve a membership fee of $25 pa, but provide all the
&gt; advantages of AUUG backing.  Or maybe the SIG could become the AUUG member?
&gt;
&gt; We do need to work together and be - and be seen (heard?) to be - speaking
&gt; with one voice which is big enough and loud enough to be
&gt; influential.

I've been thinking about this for a while (obviously :-).  We have
other situations where it would seem to be a good idea to have SIGs
with only a minimal payment.  Our concerns here are not so much taking
on the SIGs as that we might lose paying members as a result.
Currently, as you observe, the membership costs $110 a year.  Starting
on 1 July, that will go up to $125, though people who renew before the
end of the half year will continue to pay only $110.

What do members get for this?

 - AUUGN magazine.
 - Access to member discounts.
 - Cheaper entry to AUUG events.
 - Cheaper entry to events of affiliated associations.

$125 is by no means excessive for people in the IT business, but it's
obviously a significant hurdle for hobbyists and students.  Note,
however, that if you go to a LinuxSA or AUUG SA chapter meeting and
then go out for a pizza afterwards, you're looking at between $10 and
$15.  Multiply that by 12 and you have significantly more.

I'd like to solicit ideas on how we can open AUUG SIGs for little or
no cost without losing members.
