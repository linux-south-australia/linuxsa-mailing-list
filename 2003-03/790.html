I believe its always helpful to return to the meaning of the words in
question to help clarify things.

Innovation
  1 : the introduction of something new
  2 : a new idea, method, or device : NOVELTY
Invention
  1 : DISCOVERY, FINDING
  2 : productive imagination : INVENTIVENESS
  3 a : something invented : as (1) : a product of the imagination;
especially : a false conception
(2) : a device, contrivance, or process originated after study and
experiment b
: a short keyboard composition featuring two or three part counterpoint
  4 : the act or process of inventing
Invent
  1 archaic : FIND, DISCOVER
  2 : to devise by thinking : FABRICATE
  3 : to produce (as something useful) for the first time through the use
of the imagination or of ingenious thinking and experiment

Has the IT industry been inventive? That is certainly under question.
Has the open source movement been innovative? A resounding Yes! That is the
most amazing thing about this stuff.  People are adding new things all the
time. (New things meaning stuff we didnt have before obviously.)

Another area not covered in the topic so far is also whether or not this
allows the end user to be innovative. I have certainly found in my
experience with Linux and Opensource that I always had a way to innovate
and invent new ways of doing things that just werent possible using other
operating systems some Unix included.

In summary my vote is Yes. ;)
