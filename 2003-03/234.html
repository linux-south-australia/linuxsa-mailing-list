&gt; I take it that NAT gateway doesn't forward port 22 to the internal 
&gt; machine ?
&gt; 
&gt; If it does (or can be made to do so), you could use something like:
&gt; 
&gt; ssh -2 -C ext-ip-of-NAT-gw -L 2525:10.x.x.x:25 -L 2510:10.x.x.x:110 -L 
&gt; 2543:10.x.x.x:143


It probably can do that from a technical viewpoint, but it's not under
my control (or even my influence)... so that's not possible.

&gt; 
&gt; (you'd then point your mail client at localhost:2525 on the remote 
&gt; machine to get to port 25 on the 10.x.x.x machine)

Which is what we are doing ... kinda -- using the ssh, mail goes onto
our internet-accessable server, then to port 2525 on that same server,
which is ssh portforwarded to the remote 10. server, but only when the
ssh tunnel is up.

&gt; 
&gt; But if it doesn't forward port 22 traffic, things become more difficult.

I've got an unhappy kludge here, which works ok, but still isn't
satisfactory. My problem, I beleive, is because of the network
performance and packet loss I mentioned in another email...

&gt; 
&gt; If you have access to the 10.x.x.x machine, you could initiate an ssh 
&gt; connection to the remote machine and us -R mapping to map ports on the 
&gt; remote machine to the real ports on the 10.x.x.x machine.

Which is what I'm doing... but the connection keeps dying -- and I've
recently discovered that the satellite link is screwy, and I'm having
major performance issues .. 10-15 second pings, 80% packet loss.. I
think this is the problem :)

&gt; 
&gt; However it sounds like you don't have the luxury of that access either.
&gt; 
&gt; In that case I'm a bit stuck...

so am I -- as far as I can tell, the network issue is not anything I can
do anything about. All I can do is call the satellite company, and
howl at them... which I have done, and they have put all hands on deck,
and I'm hoping it fixes itself soon :)
