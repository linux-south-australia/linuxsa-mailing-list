&gt; Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; Can anyone suggest some hardware for wiring an external push-button up 
&gt; to a modern PC, one running Linux or FreeBSD, that will allow me to 
&gt; easily run some shell scripts when the button is activated? In order of 
&gt; preference I'd want the PC interface to be: USB, serial, parallel, or at 
&gt; worst PCI.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm faced with the situation that I need a doorbell, but why just buy 
&gt; one when I can do something cool, like rig up a SMS notification as well 
&gt; as getting a boring old chime? :)

By far the easiest way to do this sort of thing is to use a parallel
port. Often the input lines are fitted with pull-up resistors so your
doorbell push button is a two-wire no-twiddles installation to ground
one of the lines.

Ideally, the parallel port you use is on an expansion card. I think it
is a good idea to use expansion cards rather than motherboard
resources for this sort of thing as it greatly reduces the chances of
buggering up your motherboard if someone carrying a large static
charge presses the doorbell. If you want to be really cool you could
always use an optoisolator.

Then you simply poll the parallel port every 50ms or so and take
appropriate action if the relevant line goes low.

It's pretty much the same using a serial port in this way, just a
little more awkward talking to the port.

USB is probably going to be an expensive pain in the butt, and going
all the way to PCI isn't necessary!

If you like I can send you some stuff I have on parallel port
programming. It's DOS-related, but the chip is the same under Linux of
course, so it's still useful. I could also send a couple of possible
circuit diagrams (untested).
