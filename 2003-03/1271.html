Michael,

&gt; laptop make the HDD spin down so often, especially when running on AC
&gt; power?  To make sure, I grabbed the Intel Application Accelerator
&gt; utility and modified the Advanced Power Management settings in the HDD
&gt; itself (this made no difference).  Thus I'm sure it's not a software
&gt; setting anywhere causing the problem.

Not entirely a wise move. Toshiba may attempt to claim you've broken the
drive regardless of whether you have or not.

&gt; Has anyone else experienced this on their Toshiba laptop?  (or another
&gt; laptop which uses Toshiba drives, such as Dell?)  Does anyone think
&gt; this is a 'standard feature' to keep spinning down the drive even when
&gt; not requested to?  There are no PM settings in the BIOS either.

I'd be inclined to say that it may simply be a stupid computer. Greg
Lehey has a good quote: "Never attribute to malice what you can atribute
to stupidity" and you're describing something that sounds stupid to me.

&gt; I will install Linux on this machine if (when?) it's running properly.
&gt;  If I
&gt; install it now Toshiba will just blame Linux for the problems and
&gt; leave it at that.

They will try to blame it on Linux--as a company they're not entirely
Linux friendly. On the other hand talk to us if they do because at worst
we could have a PR nightmare on Toshiba's hands or a regulatory body
(such as the Office of Consumer Affairs) might find their tactics a
little "strange" and deserving of compensation.

BTW, their later laptops are mostly compatible with modern Linux kernels
:-)
