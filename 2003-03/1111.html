Hi.
* David Lloyd &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dlloyd@microbits.com.au">dlloyd@microbits.com.au</A>&gt; [2003-03-24 12:04]:
&gt; 
&gt; Michael,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Go back and read the message again. It is I who is doing the praying,
&gt; &gt; and it is not for their god to give them permission to fight.
&gt; 
&gt; I realise that--I'm saying you have no need to. Allah already protects
&gt; them from the infidels.

Apart from being a little bit patronising, that statement would only work for me
if Allah was also my god. I think it's pretty clear that that is not the case at
the moment.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm a little bit more concerned about innocent skins than godly or
&gt; &gt; otherwise justification for defense.
&gt; 
&gt; The innocent will die and that is for certain. We don't live in a fair
&gt; or just world, we just live in the world and need to adjust to it
&gt; accordingly.

Humph. Tell that to the Iraqi's who are about to cop it. I think you have
completely missed my point, turning my shared thoughts and concerns over the
conflict into some sort of point scoring competition.

&gt; 
&gt; This reminds me of Galadriel's monologue in The Two Towers:
&gt; 
&gt; "...the people of Rohan will be destroyed by Sauron's puppet Saruman.
&gt; Isengard has been unleashed."
&gt; 
&gt; I think the next holocaust is upon us; I was hoping I might get away
&gt; with not seeing a world at war.

I'd hope not, but the crystal ball is a bit cloudy at the moment...

Returning you to your regular linuxsa content...

Having had no replies to my SAN question last week, I built up a box with
P4/512M/80+180GB and debian woody+samba. Works very well in test, it's on it's way
to Melbourne and should be in place this afternoon. I'll advise the list of
progress... (I get 300mb/min copying the contents of my w2k laptop's crappy HD
over samba to the new box, should hopefully get better than that from the servers)
