David,

&gt; That's a cop out.

I know that it is a cop out but it was relevant to the question that was
asked. I don't see any point for my five or so machines on my private
network to have IPV6 addresses. In fact I don't need IPV6 for anything;
if I were to implement or use it I'd probably end up with a seriously
broken system, a lot of headaches and something where:

 ssh linux.localhost

...still works.

&gt; How can you expect it to become more mainstream if nobody uses it ?  

Until we actually need IPV6--which we clearly don't (or we'd all be
forced to actually use it, d'oh, or things would break)--I tend to
consider it something that I'm not going to fix because at the moment
it's not broken. 

&gt; The more people that become familiar with it now, the more likely it
&gt; is to come to fruition sooner.

The sooner that the so-called IP shortage actually affects us the more
likely it will come to fruiting sooner...
