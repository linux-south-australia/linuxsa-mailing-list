Sure, you can ask...

We use Legato Networker, running on Linux controlling 6 SDLT drives and 
258 slots.

SDLT drives hold 110Gb uncompressed - some of our tapes have up to 350Gb 
on them (mainly finance data and indexes).  We do a quarterly full and 
incrementals everyday.  The tapes go offsite and all is well with the 
world.  Really easy...

Of course, this box is not the only box that is backed up.  There are 
workstations and other servers that also get backed up.  That's probably 
another TB or so... no biggie (just painful putting all those tapes into 
the jukebox every week, but someone has to do it...)

&gt; may i ask how ppl back up a TB of data?  sure you can build a box that holds
&gt; a TB of data, but back it up every night like i would have thought is
&gt; expected??  that's the problem we have, not about disc space, but the cost
&gt; of buying new tape drives all the time.
&gt; 
&gt; yeah i've heard all the wind about mirroring it to another machine etc etc,
&gt; but a fire doesn't care about a mirrored server.  :)  just a thought.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone mentioned earlier about 1/2 a TB of data ... thats a *lot*!
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; That's true.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not really - we have over 1TB on one Linux machine that serves it's data
&gt; &gt; through another Linux machine running samba by using NFS (us *nix users
&gt; &gt; just NFS mount it *g*).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Correct. Not really a lot. My test shelf, which is about 5U high, has
&gt; &gt;1.2TB in it. We took the same size shelf to Connectathon. It has 3.9TB in
&gt; &gt;it. A whole 19" rack would have 30TB in it.
