&gt; Hard work?? Only from the western world point or view, farming rice
&gt; by hand in inches of mud and hot, humid conditions is what I'd call
&gt; hard work but are part of the Lao Calendar.

All the more reason to avoid wasting effort on less essential tasks!

&gt; Laos is a very isolated country and mountainous country and a lot of
&gt; villages do not have power from the national grid (generators only,
&gt; possibly only a few hours a day in the evening) or schools. The other
&gt; problem is lack of roads, in the more remote provinces (states).

Sure, otherwise you wouldn't need the bike generator.

&gt; The article states that a customised laptop is being used. Pedalling for
&gt; 40 minutes for an hour of internet use isn't bad for those with very few
&gt; modern amenities. 

But we're talking _major_ efficiency gains. Why pedal for 40 minutes
when you need only pedal for 20?

&gt; The whole system must be simple enough to be maintained by the village
&gt; and portable enough to be carried on foot. Replacing a bearing can be
&gt; trouble.

Sure. It would be pretty much like the device in the picture: a stand
for the bike attached to a box with a shaft sticking out. Main
difference is the shaft sticks out in a different place and has a
sprocket on the end. The derailleur gear system of the mountain bike
in the picture should allow enough slack to unhook the chain from the
rear wheel and hook it over the generator sprocket.

It looks to me as if the box in the picture contains some form of
gearbox to match the speed of the input shaft to the generator, as
would also be required by the sprocket drive method.

So, for ease of maintenance, the two methods are as good as each other
- ie. about as easy as maintaining the bike. But the components in the
sprocket drive version are likely to be more lightly loaded, so will
require less maintenance.

&gt; Question: Why take so long to post a response to Romana's link? or am I
&gt; responding to a troll?

I've been away for a couple of weeks, and am now wading through a
great pile of email...
