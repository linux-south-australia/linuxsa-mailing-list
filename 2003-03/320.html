Ouch!  Alleged copyright infringement shuts down a free software/oss project...

&lt;-- from <A HREF="http://microbsd.net/">http://microbsd.net/</A> --&gt;
The MicroBSD Project has Shut Down! All works have been removed. 

To the OpenBSD developers, There was no intent to modify any copyright in the 
CVS tree. We have publically acknowledged the issue and have shut down this 
project. We apologize for the inconvience and commotion this has caused the BSD 
community. It was never our intent to be at odds with anyone in the community 
to start. All MicroBSD code has been removed from our servers. The web site 
will go away. The project will cease to exist. This decision is based on time, 
efforts involved, the lack of developers, and lack of interest. I personally do 
not have the time, nor am I inclined to continue with a project that has caused 
this much negativity in the community.


At the suggestions from various repected people in the industry who supported 
us, we are sorry. We feel it is not in the best interest of the project to 
continue its exitance. To those that opposed us from the start, We will just go 
away as you wish. 

Specific developer(s) who committed files with those copyright violations were 
planning on rectifying the issues. Instead, I have decided to completely remove 
the source tree and all traces of code commited. 

There is currently no CVS, cvsweb or downloads available due to a copyright 
issue being brought to our attention. We have ceased all development activity 
to address the issue and remove any violations from the cvs tree. This was an 
unfortunate oversight on our part, and was not intended to violate any 
copyright issues. We have taken pain staking measures to be sure to not 
modify/violate any copyrights. We assure you this copyright issue, was an 
oversight on our part and was not intentional.


In closing we simply ask the the community carry on as it were, and all person
(s) with MicroBSD installed, Please remove the code, and install OpenBSD. We 
will be providing locations to the various apsect of code we had initially 
committed in features to get the project off the ground before we continued 
with our planned unique additons to the BSD community. As of now there will be 
no further contributions to the BSD community as a whole. In closing, Again we 
apologize for such oversights, and have removed all code.
