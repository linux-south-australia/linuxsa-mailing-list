&gt;I think we're looking at things from different perspectives. Innovation and copying are two different issues, and I personally

 From my perspective, the first time I saw a LaTeX document, I was 
extremely impressed.  My favorite word processor is LyX.   Granted,  if 
I knew my LaTeX macros my favorite would just be TeX, but I need the GUI 
training wheels. I do realize that if I already knew the macros the GUI 
would in fact slow me down, even though I would consider LyX and my 
machine to be "fast." The training wheels got me to the point where I 
can do a very simple, minimal LaTeX job.

But there was a time in my life when I knew nothing of LaTeX or LyX , a 
time when I had no concept of one of my favorite tools.

I am sure this is true of Troff, in my case.  I haven't been around long 
enough to know what it means to create a quality printout.

I have an older Hayden Series book formatted with troff, or some such, 
and I like the print.

So my question is this:  Is there a LyX type tool for Troff, that is, a 
GUI based set of training wheels that will ease me into learning Troff?

Is Troff a good tool to use, or has it been improved upon by another 
Unix tool?

P.S. What do you edit your web pages with?  How do you get it to have 
the look it has?  It uses the white space very well.
