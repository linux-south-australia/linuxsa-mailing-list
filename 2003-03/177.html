My idle and incomplete thoughts for a mesh-network routing protocol 
would be one that works on Geography and GPS coordinates rather than 
advertised routes. A node could advertise "I have 5000K bandwidth from 
the west, 2000K bandwidth from the north (based on vector components)" 
along with "5km west, 20km north are the extremeties" and "my position 
is x,y".

This way your own node could make a choice of where to send data based 
on the position of the remote IP address. Larger networks (ie: 
0.0.0.0/0) might be better suited to routing over tunnels on the mesh, 
or something like ebgp-multihop, since they're likely to be made 
available via specific static entities anyway. If you wanted to send 
data to an unreachable node, your routing process would know that it's 
out of range based on available hosts.. it would also stop leaf nodes 
from being a sink for traffic that can't reach it's destination.

It might also allow some degree of mobility for nodes.

I base this on the idea that a residential node shouldn't have to know 
the route to everything else in the network, but it should know roughly 
what it's neighbours know to make a decision .. something of a paradox 
in an infinite and volatile system. Anyway, that's just an armchair view 
that probably has serious shortcomings when compared to real routing 
protocols (like: how do you see DNS to know what the Location of a 
remote IP is?), but I'd be interested to see if any real efforts have 
had similar ideas.
