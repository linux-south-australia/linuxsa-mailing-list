&gt; Instead of making it a head to head, which you'll lose, why not think 
&gt; about his concerns and address them?

I think the letter's great; addresses all of the concerns he seemed to 
have, and from a corporate perspective, its quite enlightening.  Nice 
letter, Adam.

&gt; 	If you leave, he can't replace you with a Microsoft person.
&gt;
&gt; 	The back end can't keep up with Microsoft 'innovations'.
&gt;
&gt; So offer to set up a Microsoft based back end in parallel with the 
&gt; Unix stuff, so if anything goes wrong, you can switch back to 
&gt; Microsoft at any time.

Ugh.  Why do everything twice?  The reason he *doesnt* want to 
provide/support Microsoft solutions is all the stuffing around and 
limitations that seems to happen.

Microsoft works (sometimes).  But it sure as hell isn't flexible, and 
things do stop working for no apparent reason.  I'm in the middle of 
killing off a Windows 2000 (domain server+exchange) box as I speak.

R

&gt; Then you can do your day to day with Unix, and keep Microsoft waiting 
&gt; in the wings for any moment that it may be needed.

In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of
people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
