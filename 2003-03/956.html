&gt; 
&gt; Peer,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Those particular packages may no longer be "pointed to" in the pool
&gt; &gt; from SID as  they are not latest.. 
&gt; 
&gt; Damn. The packages file then is old. Confound.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (and hopefully it's still actually on one of the mirrors in your
&gt; &gt; sources.list)
&gt; 
&gt; But it's not.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; There is a LOT of activity around the testing suite at the moment
&gt; &gt; which has had me hopping to keep up
&gt; &gt; Including gcc and libc6 stuff .. it may pay you to pin your libc6
&gt; &gt; and gcc stuff down for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I believe that everything now uses the "new" pool system including
&gt; &gt; SID which used to be a sort of open "CVS" ....on a seperate branch.
&gt; 
&gt; It does. It seems to be mostly working.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why not use unstable where currently I am watching  what _was_a
&gt; &gt; perfectly good nautilus spawning about 10 new processes a second  :)
&gt; &gt; On another box ...
&gt; 
&gt; Actually I've seen that happen on a box at work. I'm not sure what
&gt; triggers it - it appears to be totally random. Luckily it's on an ext3
&gt; file system and doesn't mind being hard rebooted if it gets too out of
&gt; control.
&gt; 
It happens when I launch from an Enlightenment menu but not from a
terminal.
The fact that it happens reliably from the Emenu is useful (though I
can't see any real difference Eshell would be doing the work)
Monitoring some other (latest Unstable) stuff I see a stack of warning
about extra lines at the end of files.
(but NOT just now when I was going to include the out put....%^$##$ !)
I suspect this may be a theme thing I will report it and attempt a fix 
some of the new Gnome2 themes are enough to make me use a panel and
maybe a desktop :)

launch Nautilus from eterm: (I opens quickly and fine but I get this )
extra content and the end of the document 
*** attempt to put segemnt in horiz list twice 
(repeated once)
Then
Extra content at end of doc. repeated very many times.

Lauch from an Enlightenment menu and It's either reboot or a very slow
wait for a terminal &gt; killall nautilus
I will try to gbd / strace this tonight..
