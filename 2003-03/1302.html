Hi,
The company I work for has a small office area (suit 8-10 people) we're 
looking to sublease (previous tennant relocated) on Greenhill Rd in Unley.

(We leased a much to big area several years ago to get a good rate)

The area is divided up into a small reception area, office/meeting room and 
an open area with a compactus. 

We can provide access to another meeting room and boardroom if required.

It's secure, first floor space, with undercover parking (number of spaces
negotiable from 3 up).  

It's cabled (Cat5e) and is currently fitted out with about a dozen digital
handsets from our PABX (we can arrange a partition of it as we provided to
the previous tennant). The building is serviced by Telstra and Optus and has
ETSA/UECOMM fibre running past the front door.  It probably has LOS to
SANTOS in town from the roof (haven't ever checked). We have analogue phone
lines that have ADSL so that's an option too.

We're a Cisco reseller and provide maintenance services, so we can probably 
offer cheap maintenance with good SLAs as well :-)

If you've got any questions or want to have a look email or call me at work:
08 82915211 or <A HREF="mailto:mmc@au.logical.com">mmc@au.logical.com</A>
