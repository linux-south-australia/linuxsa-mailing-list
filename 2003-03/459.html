Hi Alan,

I think you've overstating matters for effect, but
we're in general agreement.

I'm usually content to leave optimisation to the compiler
to sort out.  It's just that I need this code to be quick
for policital reasons as well -- you can imagine how
welcome new instructions are in the TCP fast path, and
to not have the best set of instructions would doom
the entire patch (after a suitable period of flaming on
linux-kernel).

I'm not entirely convinced that optionally-collected
variables are a good idea.  It does make the security
model simpler (no need to track all the kernel-space/
user-space APIs).  The Extended Statistics TCP MIB is
one of the few MIBs where reading a variable presents a
massive security risk [1], so we want it off by default
even if SNMP is running.

Regards,
Glen

  [1] Think about it -- you've got all the sequence numbers
      for all the TCP sessions.  Want to insert some data?  Even
      if they use crypto you can still reset every connection.
