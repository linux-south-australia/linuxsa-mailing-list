&gt; You may be over zealous. Things to think about:
&gt;
&gt;  1) Is the security flaw going to hit me?
&gt;  2) Is there anything that I really need in the new kernel?
&gt;
&gt;   - remembering the don't fix what ain't broke principle

I think that is very wise advice David and I have been trying to apply that
philosophy.  The tricky bit for me is, for example, at the moment Redhat
have released the following kernel errata for an upgrade:

<A HREF="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name</A>=CAN-2003-0127

This is a good example of an instance where I am finding it hard to
determine just what the potential threat is.  The CVE states:

"The Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4 kernels have a flaw in ptrace. This hole allows
local users to obtain full privileges. Remote exploitation of this hole is
not possible. Linux 2.5 is not believed to be vulnerable."

Now I'm not sure how they define "local" and "remote" users.  Is a user
logged into a shell via SSH a remote or local user?  Also it gives very
little information about how easy it is for this exploit to be utilised.
They include the full source of the problematic area of code, but I'm not a
programmer so I cannot use this to determine the likelihood of being
attacked.

So I often feel, like in the above example, I'm left in a situation where I
can't make an "informed" decision about whether to apply the upgrade and
disrupt my server, or leave it be.  It would be great if the CVE system
accommodated some form of "severity" gauge which, for example, could be
based on how much time, effort and knowledge would be required, on behalf of
the cracker to exploit the vulnerability.

Cheers,
Graham
