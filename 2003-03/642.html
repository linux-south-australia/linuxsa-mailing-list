&gt; &gt;This had lead me of course to warchalking, for those who don't know 
&gt; &gt;warchalking is wondering around with a wireless PDA or laptop finding 
&gt; &gt;AP's. Then placing a chalk mark on the sidewalk or wall of the 
&gt; &gt;building with the AP, the mark shows how secure the network is. 
&gt; &gt;Wardriving same concept but in a car. Can be done in a light aircraft 
&gt; &gt;too they say.
&gt; 
&gt; Nobody warchalks, its a myth.  I've only done it a few times as a 
&gt; joke.. and... lets not go any further :)

maybe noone warchalks here in adelaide or even AU, but in london and
ney york, little warchlken graffitti were everywhere ...
i put some there my self occasionally too...
if only to indicate "this is a consume node thats publically accesable"

but, whats worse is in london folks do use their laptops on the train
and bus, so you have 802.11b clients blipping past everyso often and
your trying to figure out why these thing happen ... i even had a drive
by spamming once on my node. wasn't connected to the internet and it
stoped working when /var was filled with 100+MB of spam email =(

so, it does happen, maybe adelaide is not populated densely enough for
you to notice. and yes i have seen warchaliking symbols about the place
;)

&gt;  
&gt; &gt;This is a funky computer nerd thing to do.

its also a ham/amatuer radio kinda thing to do too ...
 
&gt; &gt;Anyways I know Airnet ISP did have a few open hotspots in Adelaide 
&gt; &gt;(Rundle Street East Coffee shop, West Tce. Servo) but I think these 
&gt; &gt;are dead now.
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, there's certainly less Airnet hotspots then there were.  I've 
&gt; still managed to pick up over 200 other AP's in the city, though (not 
&gt; counting suburbs).

only 200 =)

&gt; &gt;Anyone know any current hotspots in Adelaide or some weblinks that 
&gt; &gt;might list this stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Community?  nodedb.com.  Actual advertised open hotspots?  No idea, 
&gt; although this would be nice.  Hotspots that perhaps aren't there for 
&gt; the public to use?  As far as I know, there isn't a site with "adelaide 
&gt; maps", as such, and I'd personally be pretty pi**ed off with anybody 
&gt; who made something like this.  Half the fun in wardriving is finding 
&gt; the AP's, and if there's a site saying "hey, look here, you can go 
&gt; leech off this poor guy and make him poor", that's just stupid.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll probably be making <A HREF="http://www.wardriving.com.au">http://www.wardriving.com.au</A> live pretty 
&gt; shortly, I had plenty of suggestions to do the latter, but there's no 
&gt; way in hell I would.

and the point behind this site would be?

&gt; &gt;News on the wirlpool site say Maccas and perhaps some franchise coffee 
&gt; &gt;shops are looking to offer wireless (of course through a particular 
&gt; &gt;ISP).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;Life on the semi-bleading edge, nerdy but fun.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;P.S. So I guess the best way to secure wireless network is via 
&gt; &gt;specific MAC address lists in the AP's ???
&gt; 
&gt; That's one way.  Best "security" in my opinion is WEP (although, this 
&gt; does take bandwidth overhead, but stops anybody associating with your 
&gt; AP), + mac filtering + vpn.

i would agree with this. but i wouldn't bother with WEP really.
although WEP is not trivail to break, it can be done if you have 
enough patience and time or a coulpe of 3GHz p4s handy ...
its an arse to debug when wyrd things happen on different wireless
clients. not to mention that not all manufacturers map the ascii text to
WEP key in the same way =(

IPSec is another alternative, but using IPv6 would foil most
casual browsers also =) but a real firewall instead of a HW AP
is certainly the way to go =)

cheers,

Kim
