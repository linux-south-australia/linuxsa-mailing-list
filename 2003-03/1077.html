&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I am very new to Linux and have just purchase a copy of Linux Mandrake 8.2
&gt; for workstations and I am wondering how one installs it to a slave Hard
&gt; Disk Drive.  I have Win98SE on my Master drive which is only a dinky little
&gt; 2.5gig thing and I would like to install Linux Mandrake onto the my second
&gt; Hard Disk which is slightly bigger (4 gig).  How does one go about doing
&gt; this?  I Put the bootable CD in and selected to install the non expert way
&gt; and the Linux wanted to partition my Master Hard Disk so I removed the CD
&gt; from the drive and then turned off my machine .. no changes had been made

Hi John,

Welcome to the group.

I have always installed linux Mandrake in expert mode, though the term expert 
i think falsely describes my level of expertise with linux!

Nevertheless, 'should you choose to accept this mission', when you are 
prompted at installation, choose 'expert' mode.

Then once the installer asks you about partitioning ( I think it's called 
'Mount Points' or something of that ilk) of your hard drives, this is where 
you can designate the slave drive as your installation target.
 From memory, you will need to click 'hdb'.  Don't do 'hda' as this is your 
master drive and any steps thereafter will wipe its contents and be 
guaranteed to displease you.

Having selected hdb, this *should* be your slave drive.  You will need to 
define various partitions on hdb using the various options presented on that 
page.  

For your swap partition, try it at about 500 MB size and define it as 
linux-swap using the drop down menu.  For your main partition, call it "/" 
and define it as linux-native', again using the drop down menu.  Let it 
occupy the rest of the space on hard drive hdb (use the slider to adjust).  
Alternative to making '/' the rest of your hard drive, you could make it just 
say 2GB and create another partition '/home' (also make it linux-native) to 
occupy the rest of the drive.  Doing this can help later should you need to 
do a reinstall or to install a later version of linux from scratch, since it 
means you don't need to wipe the contents of your 'home' directory, where 
all/most user data is stored.

Hopefully I've left out nothing important from the drive designation and 
partitioning stuff but I do stand to be corrected if I have.

There are many steps subsequent to these and most depend on the various bits 
of hardware you are using/have connected.  It's usually fine just to accept 
the various defaults that the install presents you with . . . it's pretty 
good at sensing your hardware.  Printers can be a pain to get right but you 
can finalise those after the install, if you like, through the Mandrake 
Control Centre.  

Oh,  and did I mention how important it is to make sure everything you value 
on *any* *any* *any* connected hard drives is backed up before you do an 
install.  This is particularly true when just starting out since an error 
(either by you or in the advice shown above), particularly when choosing 
which drive to install upon or in creating partitions, can be a bit nasty.  

Proceed with caution but keep alive your adventure with linux :-).  

Cheers & good luck,

Andrew Lord


&gt; .. I was in aw at how fast the Linux OS installation program ran to that
&gt; point, considering I have an old machine Pentium II 233.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers
