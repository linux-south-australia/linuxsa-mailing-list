Web Accessibility Training Event

I missed out on last year's event but it was very well done and lots of 
people have learned from participating.

If you are into web site design then accessibility is something you 
should be aware of and be building into your sites. Not just because 
you should be, because you should want to be making your sites 
accessible to as many people as you can reach out to.

Cheers,  Ian

 Ian Loxton-

 WebAIM is pleased to announce its 2003 Online Web
 Accessibility Training Event.

 Hello to everybody that participated in last year's online
 Web Accessibility Training Event by WebAIM.

 We hope that you have been able to benefit from what was
 presented last year and that it was a good experience for
 you.

 As you may have heard, WebAIM is sponsoring another online
 training event this year. The 3-week event will take place
 between March 31 and April 18.

 Detailed information about the WebAIM Online Web
 Accessibility Training Event 2003 can be found at
 www.webaim.org/training2003.

 *How is this year's event different from last year's?*

 The purpose of the event is the same--to provide in-depth
 Web accessibility training--but the content and approach
 this year are new. We have expanded our resources
 considerably, and enhanced our tutorials with video
 demonstrations, showing how to apply the techniques step by
 step.

 We have divided the information into three tracks: one for
 developers, one for administrators/managers, and one for
 accessibility trainers. The track for accessibility trainers
 is completely new, with advice, techniques, and resources
 that trainers can use when they are training others about
 Web accessibility. If you are in the role of accessibility
 trainer, you won't want to miss out on the chance to
 interact with other accessibility trainers and learn about
 strategies that others are employing. There will be plenty
 of new information, even for those who attended last year's
 event.

 Like last year's training, we will have live, captioned,
 Web-based audio broadcasts each week, during which
 participants will be able to call in and ask questions.

 Register now for this year's event, and encourage colleagues
 and friends to participate as well.

 Although we are not able to offer the training at no cost
 this year, the prices are reasonable and discounts are
 available for groups as well as for those who are in
 education.

 For registration or more information see
 www.webaim.org/training2003.
