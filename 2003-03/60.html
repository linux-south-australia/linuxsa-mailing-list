&gt; &gt; Now, I've read various configuration guides as to how to

&gt; &gt; disk. Especially for a mail server or log server ...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Some guides say "don't do it", others are fairly vague on the issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm... surprised to hear guides saying "don't do it", unless these are
&gt; for desktop systems...

I think it suffers from the Perl mentality, "there aer many ways to do
it" ... but thats not a bad thing =)

&gt; &gt; So, the question is, what is the experience of the list on this?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; For a mail server for example, should /var be a separate 
&gt; &gt; disk, or should the IMAP/POP server have its mail folders in 
&gt; &gt; home on its own disk ... or is there a better scheme?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is there a good reason not to split /var onto its own disk 
&gt; &gt; from the root volume? Like it needs to be mounted at boot 
&gt; &gt; time for XXX reason.
&gt; 
&gt; /var is commonly separate from /. This is because you do NOT, under any
&gt; circumstances want to fill / up. That would be bad. Filling /var up is
&gt; also bad, but won't kill your server entirely, just most of the daemons.
&gt; /var does need to be mounted as daemons come up, but usually it would
&gt; come up at a similar time to /usr, and most daemons would be run from
&gt; /usr... so it should be fine...

thats what i thought. so on boot up, if theres a problem and /var is
a separate partition, and theres a problem mounting it, nothing gets
logged? so i suppose that would make debugging via the logs harder =(

&gt; One thing to think about is that if a server has a specific other
&gt; function, like it's a proxy, or a mail server, then the relevant
&gt; directory there could be made its own partition with some real benefit.
&gt; For eg, /var/spool/mail or /var/cache/squid could be separate. This
&gt; means that if that particular function goes wrong somehow, and the
&gt; partition fills up, everything else keeps working, so it's easier to
&gt; fix.

ok this is along the lines as i have implemented before on my old mail
server with over 60GB, of IMAP data...

but policy there was to compile and install app+data into /usr/home/APP/
and mount that on its own disk =) which was fine, until you run outa 
soace on the disk =/

&gt; Also consider backups -- you may not want to backup /var/cache/squid at
&gt; all... and if you're using dump, putting it on a separate partition
&gt; helps. Perhaps there are different file access patterns, and you want to
&gt; use reiser for the squid cache, as it's fast for small files, and ext3
&gt; on a software RAID mirror for reliability...

this is in the plan. im looking at a dedicated backup server with an
8 slot LTO or SDLT drive and amanda over GB NICS =)

&gt; Of course, you must balance this with the simplicity and flexibility of
&gt; one partition for everything, esp on a insignificant server or a
&gt; desktop...

no, this be a new (set of) servers specifically for the task.
moving everything to rackmount as space is an issue at the moment.

&gt; Anyway, that's some food for thought.

yes thanks =)

cheers,

Kim
