&gt; &gt; Still, as rr pointed out, is this the kind of thing I want to install
&gt; &gt; outdoors? The door it will be located on has no cover from
&gt; &gt; the rain. And
&gt; &gt; is it something I want to plug into one of my servers? I'd
&gt; &gt; hate to see
&gt; &gt; the machine explode in a puff of magic smoke.
&gt;
&gt; With a fuse, it should be ok (doorbells tend to work outside). The fuse
&gt; will probably never get used anyway, it's there just in case lightening
&gt; hits your doorbell (KRAKAK-BOOM! dingdongdingdongdingdongdingdong...)
&gt;
&gt; If you're paranoid, use a serial card rather than a motherboard one, or
&gt; just use an old PC for this... And make sure you're not running telnet
&gt; or an insecure ftp on your doorbell...

I sincerely doubt that you'll gain much in the way of protection from either
a fuse (unless you're planning some really bad wiring to your serial
connector!) or a serial expansion card, with respect to lightning strikes.
If you want to improve your safety margin, you really need to look at
optical isolation (not as hard as it might sound) and perhaps a lightning
(surge) suppressor, too.

You really need to weigh up the value of what you're gaining against what
you're risking. Personally, I'd consider the risk of a fatal (to your PC
hardware) strike from a doorbell pretty minimal, unless I was in an area
particularly prone to strikes. On the other hand, how much are you prepared
to risk that the system this is attached to might get taken out (which could
potentially vary from merely damaging the serial port to taking out your
entire system and perhaps other stuff connected to it).

Off the top of my head, for simplicity I'd think about something like a
battery (say 9V) wired via your doorbell and a suitable resistor to the
diode side of an opto-isolator, then the switching side of the opto wired in
place of where you would have otherwise had the doorbell switch. If this
doesn't make sense get back to me and I'll try to knock up a quick schematic
for you (or perhaps someone else here follows this and knows how to create
one of those wonderful ASCII schematics). This could be done and only need
add maybe $5 or so to your project (more to include the surge arrestor).
