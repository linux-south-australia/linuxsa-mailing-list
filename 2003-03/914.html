&gt; Ouch.

Sorry Glen, not meant as a barb. . . . my use of Smileys isn't great :-).  I 
am most appreciative of your response.

&gt; Let me do it
&gt;
&gt;    which bash
&gt;      /bin/bash
&gt;    vi BashTest
&gt;      #!/bin/bash --
&gt;      date
&gt;    chmod a+rx BashTest
&gt;    SHELL=./BashTest script SomeFunkyFileName
&gt;    cat SomeFunkyFileName
&gt;      Script started on Tue Mar 18 12:03:42 2003
&gt;      Tue Mar 18 12:03:42 CST 2003
&gt;
&gt;      Script done on Tue Mar 18 12:03:42 2003
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps it's as simple as not making the file executable or
&gt; giving a relative path and not being in the current directory.

Unfortunately both these are OK (perms are all executable and script is 
called, and located in, the current directory).

&gt; If you're doing anything complicated (like running make) then
&gt; I'd be starting the script BashTest with
&gt;
&gt;    #!/bin/bash --
&gt;    SHELL=/bin/bash
&gt;
&gt; so that programs called in BashTest that look for SHELL
&gt; aren't terminally confused.

I tried the above and it unfortunately made no difference to the outcome.  The 
results are still inconsistent when working with very short/simple bash 
scripts but it works with complex scripts including make etc, as did your 
earlier suggestion.  Could be a bug in bash or script ?

&gt; Also, you could always use the shell's own facilities to
&gt; redirect the output.  Have a look at the shell's "2&&gt;1"
&gt; operation and the "tee" program.

I'll take a look in those directions.  Thankyou for your suggestions Glen.

Cheers,

Andrew Lord

&gt; BTW: Installers are evil.  It's much less work for
&gt;       you and users if you use the platform's native
&gt;       packaging.  This is one of the real strengths
&gt;       of Unixen over Windows.  See the Samba code for
&gt;       how to create packages for a variety of platforms.
