&gt; How do I make a sequence of dates in bash?

i had a quick look at the 'date' command which i thought you could do;
  date +1day 

but i must be thinking of the 'at' command or summat,
there is a perl module on debian called;
  libdate-calc-perl - Perl library for accessing dates
so if you're on *BSD you'd have to CPAN it =)
 
&gt; I have a script that needs to do something once for each day in a given
&gt; range. I have been messing about with a bizzare combination of date and
&gt; seq, but can't seem to make it do what I want, and I'm sure there's a
&gt; simpler way...
&gt; 
&gt; What I want the user of the script to be able to do is type:
&gt; 
&gt; script "1 Dec 2002" "31 Jan 2003"
&gt; 
&gt; and have the script do something for each day between.
&gt; 
&gt; I had originally been using integers, which were interpreted as the
&gt; number of days ago, but this is way unintuitive (easy to program, mind
&gt; you, as I could get the date formats I wanted with `date --date="$i days
&gt; ago"`, and use seq to just run through the numbers)...
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas? Any programs that will do this for me?

i had another bash at this, and come back to the same problem of
incrementing days over the end of month.

so why dont you use %s to convert the dates to seconds, see 'man date';

"SYNOPSIS
       date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
...
 FORMAT controls the output.  The only valid option for the second form
 specifies Coordinated Universal Time.  Interpreted sequences are:
 ...
 %s     seconds since `00:00:00 1970-01-01 UTC' (a GNU extension)"

conver the star and end dates to seconds since the epoc, then increment
the seconds by one day, print the date ... until the end
date (in seconds) is less than the day your incrementing.

now, i haven't coded it up. it should work in theory =) but i have too
much ip accound drama to fix ... =)

cheers,

Kim
