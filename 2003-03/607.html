&gt; This had lead me of course to warchalking, for those who don't know 
&gt; warchalking is wondering around with a wireless PDA or laptop finding 
&gt; AP's. Then placing a chalk mark on the sidewalk or wall of the 
&gt; building with the AP, the mark shows how secure the network is. 
&gt; Wardriving same concept but in a car. Can be done in a light aircraft 
&gt; too they say.

Nobody warchalks, its a myth.  I've only done it a few times as a 
joke.. and... lets not go any further :)
 
&gt; This is a funky computer nerd thing to do.
&gt;  
&gt; Anyways I know Airnet ISP did have a few open hotspots in Adelaide 
&gt; (Rundle Street East Coffee shop, West Tce. Servo) but I think these 
&gt; are dead now.

Yeah, there's certainly less Airnet hotspots then there were.  I've 
still managed to pick up over 200 other AP's in the city, though (not 
counting suburbs).

&gt; Anyone know any current hotspots in Adelaide or some weblinks that 
&gt; might list this stuff.

Community?  nodedb.com.  Actual advertised open hotspots?  No idea, 
although this would be nice.  Hotspots that perhaps aren't there for 
the public to use?  As far as I know, there isn't a site with "adelaide 
maps", as such, and I'd personally be pretty pi**ed off with anybody 
who made something like this.  Half the fun in wardriving is finding 
the AP's, and if there's a site saying "hey, look here, you can go 
leech off this poor guy and make him poor", that's just stupid.

I'll probably be making <A HREF="http://www.wardriving.com.au">http://www.wardriving.com.au</A> live pretty 
shortly, I had plenty of suggestions to do the latter, but there's no 
way in hell I would.

&gt; News on the wirlpool site say Maccas and perhaps some franchise coffee 
&gt; shops are looking to offer wireless (of course through a particular 
&gt; ISP).
&gt;  
&gt; Life on the semi-bleading edge, nerdy but fun.
&gt;  
&gt; P.S. So I guess the best way to secure wireless network is via 
&gt; specific MAC address lists in the AP's ???

That's one way.  Best "security" in my opinion is WEP (although, this 
does take bandwidth overhead, but stops anybody associating with your 
AP), + mac filtering + vpn.
