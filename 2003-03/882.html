&gt; i dont think you'll find too many GUIs that aren't like windows in
&gt; some way.  dont forget windows 95 wasnt original either. 

Obviously there are certain limitations which mean that all "desktop"
have common features.  The real question is where to draw the line.

&gt; it would be interesting to know what you use as a desktop.

This was addressed at Michael Davies, but that won't stop me voicing
my opinion.

I don't use a "desktop", just a window manager (fvwm2).  It hasn't
always been fvwm2, and it may not stay that way, but getting used to
another one would take time.

So what features don't I need?

- The desktop menu.  It doesn't need to be anchored on the screen.
  It's easier to use a mouse click on the root window.  Yes, I know
  you can get it off the screen, and that's what I do when I use KDE.
- The panel.  It takes up space permanently (unless you slide it to
  one side, which is Yet Another Mouse Action).  It could just as
  easily be a mouse menu on the root window.
- The Application Starter.  Yet another mouse function which is better
  handled by an xterm.
- Pretty icons on the root window, all arranged at top left.  I'd
  rather have text icons (take up less space), and located in
  different parts of the screen depending on what they are.  Take a
  look at <A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/desktop.gif">http://www.lemis.com/grog/desktop.gif</A> for an example.

So what are we left with?  The menus that KDE currently offers under
the middle and right mouse buttons.  You don't need KDE (or any other
"desktop") for that.
