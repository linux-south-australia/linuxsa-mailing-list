&gt;&gt; Not for every reasonable use of the term.  I wanted to insert a window

&gt; And what resolution should it be?  What pixel depth?  WYSIAYG?

I didn't want to have to think about that.  I wanted troff to make
sensible choices for me.  Since it was a screen dump, the translation
to pic transformed each pixel to a square, 1/72" on each side.  I should
have preferred not to lose the colours, however I didn't want to take a
Ph.D in "advanced uses of troff", so I settled for a fairly traditional
translation from colour to grey.


&gt;&gt; If there's a standard way of doing it then I don't know what that
&gt;&gt; way is.
&gt;
&gt; For groff, you use the PostScript interface.  That requires PostScript
&gt; of course.

Well there you are, you see.  I'm quite capable of writing PostScript
(e.g. <A HREF="http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/invoice_form.ps">http://www.tellurian.com.au/~davidn/invoice_form.ps</A>) and if that
was what I had wanted then I would have written it so.  However I was
presenting a paper and troff was the accepted format that I chose.


&gt;&gt; I know it's easy if you are willing to limit yourself to a PS (or
&gt;&gt; derivate) output device, but I'm not willing to do that.
&gt;
&gt; Why not?  How else are you going to print it?

See above for the reason at the time, however in general I'd have to
argue with the implied claim that PS is suitable for all printable
output devices.  Maybe I really have a CAT. :-)
