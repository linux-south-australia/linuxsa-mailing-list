&gt; Hello All
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to appeal to the FreeBSD advocates within the Linuxsa
&gt; group. 

Hopefully most present are FreeBSD advocates in the sense of it
being a free operating system and LinuxSA being about free OSs and
software that goes with it. There have been plenty of debates in the
past that have established that.

&gt; I am new to FreeBSD. I have had a small amount of contact with
&gt; redhat Linux when I was going through uni. Currently, I am trying to
&gt; set up a home heterogeneous network, and then use these gained skills
&gt; in my workplace. I have been trying to push FreeBSD on to an old 166
&gt; for a firewall and router, and on a Celeron 1Gb PC, however I've been
&gt; unsuccessful for if it's not one thing it's another. 

The Celeron _might_ be more straightforward overall, so perhaps it is
worth perservering with that first. At least it takes less time to find
out an install isn't going to work :-) Perhaps you could post your first
three errors when booting the Celeron from the first CD of the set?

You might also wish to consider trying FreeBSD 5.0 instead of 4.7,
because it has a lot of improvements.
