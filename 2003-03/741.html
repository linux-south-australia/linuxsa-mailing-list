&gt; I believe your colleague at Tellurian, Dan Shearer, has prepared and delivered

Dan has a lot to say on everything. He's not in today, but I'm sure
he'll reply to this e-mail over the next 24 hours. :-)

&gt; o kernel performance (Linux and BSD)

Can we really class this as innovation? I'll agree that performance of
most Open Source operating systems is far beyond many closed source
rivals, but does that mean it's innovative?

&gt; o Emulation technologies (Wine, VMWare, CrossOver etc)

VMware / Crossover are probably bad examples (being closed source and
all), but is copying something (a runtime environment in the case of
WINE) really innovation?

Someone also mentioned earlier desktop environments. I wasn't aware of
any innovations (other than maybe some stuff that only the developers
see) that stood out with any of the desktops I've used.

Any specific examples?

thx,
Matt
