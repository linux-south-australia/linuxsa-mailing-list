There are quite a few articles about it and also some news that Gentoo Linux
is running on an Xbox also.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I'm happy to present the first solution found for the Xbox Linux Project B:
Here is a way to run Xbox Linux on an unmodded, unopened Xbox !

Inlcuded is a uuencoded zip file containing all the necessary files. Here is
what you need:

- - You need an unmodded XBOX (not sure it works with modded bios)
- - You need the game 007 Agent Under Fire (*NOT* NIGHTFIRE, those are two
different games!)
- - You need a way to transfer a save to a memory card (that is,
xbox-save.com's hardware, or usb&lt;&gt;xbox cable + usb stick + xbox-save
software, or you can use a standard memory card too if you can put files on
it (with EvoX for instance).
- - You need to get the "Xbox Linux Live" small distro.

Got all this? Let's party!

- - Unzip 007linux.zip
- - Extract the Xbox Linux Live ISO with a STANDARD ISO extractor (ie
WinISO)
- - Copy the Xbox Linux Live files into the UDATA\4541000d\000000000000\
directory (including "boot" subdirectory) (don't copy the file "plugin.img"
or it won't fit on a standard memory card).
- - Now, replace the first 0x380 bytes of the default.xbe with the 0x380
bytes contained in the "default.patch" from the included zip file
- - Copy the whole 4541000d directory to your memory card (starting from
4541000d, not UDATA. UDATA directory is here so it works with
xbox-save.com's software)
- - Use the Xbox Dashboard to copy the 007 save from the memorycard to the
HD
- - Run 007 on the Xbox
- - In main menu choose "Load Mission", then "Xbox Hard Disk"
- - Et Voila ;-) If things went well you should get a Black Screen, and Xbox
LED turning to orange (this is done when linux kernel is loaded), and after
a couple of seconds you should heard the Xbox Live Linux "loading sounds"

Just take this as a "proof of concept", there won't be anything on screen
because video has to be initialised in Linux like it is in Xromwell, but as
there is no "official version" of Xromwell I found, I prefer to use Xbox
Linux Live as example as everybody can find it.

Basically there is a bug in the save handling, which has been found in
several games, I just took 007 because only one save is needed for both US
and PAL game version - for other games you usually need two (or even more).
More explanations on how it works, how to make other linux distro work and
GPL sourcecode will follow!

I'm already anticipating some questions:

Q: Will it run my backup games without a modchip ?
A: No, it won't. This trick works for running Xbox Linux ONLY.

Q: Is it real?
A: YES.

Q: What if MS removes 007 Agent Under Fire from the shelves now ?
A: 007 Agent Under Fire is just one of the several games with this bug, so
don't worry :-)

Enjoy!
Will.

Use uudecode to extract the following file, or copy/paste it to 007linux.uu
and load it with WinZip.
