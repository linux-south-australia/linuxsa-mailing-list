&gt; &gt; Has the IT industry been inventive? That is certainly under question.
&gt; &gt; Has the open source movement been innovative? A resounding Yes! That is the
&gt; &gt; most amazing thing about this stuff.  People are adding new things all the
&gt; &gt; time. (New things meaning stuff we didnt have before obviously.)
&gt; 
&gt; So you're saying that ipfwadm was innovative because Linux didn't have
&gt; packet filtering previously? Despite the fact that at that time packet
&gt; filtering existed with many other platforms (possibly even including
&gt; Windows NT - can't remember whether NT is older than the 1.3 kernel or
&gt; not). I'm not sure that because "we" haven't done it before means that
&gt; it's innovation.

I think the innovation tends to be the next layer up -- what people do
with a pile of software given that it is free and reliable. ipfwadm
spurred the development of whole classes of cheap embedded products,
despite the fact that the technical capability has existed for years.
