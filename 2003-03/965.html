Florin,
I installed RedHat 4.2 on the 386 DX 40 Mhz with 32 Mb of RAM and it worked at normal speed and is quite useable. (at idle the CPU is 80% free and It has 7 Mb of RAM free  and is not using any of the swap partition) All the other versions I tried it literally took 5 minutes to start up a program like Netscape Navigator and X-windows took forever to load. Apart from arranging the graphics while this is happening, I am not sure what Linux is actually doing because it isn?t spending much time reading from the hard drive. Could it be that someone programmed in a few FOR X=0 to 999999999: next X loops when it encountered a 32-bit CPU without a maths co-processor being present, so you would upgrade to a 486 or Pentium? (LOL a poor attempt at a joke. I suppose you could check that as you get the source code.)

I just pinged the 386 and it answers so I suppose sendmail would work.  Arena browser fired up (slowly) and is loading the RedHat homepage (very slowly).

One of the 386 boards has a socket for a Weitek 80387DX co-processor and not long back, someone tried to sell me about five of those for about $10 and I regret not buying them now. You don?t have one lying around in your redundant hardware box?

I?ve heard it said that a 486 DX 40 Mhz is twice as fast as a 386 DX 40 Mhz, so assuming this is right, this computer must be 5 times slower than My DEC 4100 MTE which has a socket 2 486 DX4 100 Mhz in it. The DEC is an EISA computer and dual boots Windows 98 and SuSE 6.2 from two SCSI HDD surprisingly well.
