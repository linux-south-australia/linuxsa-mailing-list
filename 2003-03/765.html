&gt; left corner, the next one you open will likely appear in the bottom right
&gt; etc.)

&gt;
&gt; are not innovation?  They certainly weren't copied from windows!!

Most of them are not new with KDE.  I don't recognize some of them,
but let's try to categorize it:

&gt; -multiple desktops

Desktops, screens or displays?  The latter two come from X, which is
arguably an innovation.

&gt; -desktop pager

What's that?

&gt; -resizable panel (and themable)

Not exactly a biggy.

&gt; -completely themed gui (all widgets and window decorations)

More of a toy in my book.  When you get to this level, lots of things,
including Microsoft's, are innovations.

&gt; -email client that supports mailing lists and threading (not saying
&gt; they are the first but outlook STILL doesnt do this (havent seen
&gt; version 6 so correct me if i'm wrong).

We're talking about innovations, not what Microsoft does.  Mutt is
prior art.

&gt; -ability to select text and middle click to paste it.

X. 

&gt; -grouping of application windows on the taskbar (actually beos is probably the
&gt; first OS that supported this - and probably in the  opentracker  project too!
&gt; (open source) - and KDE featured it before the release of winxp)

Not exactly a big thing.

&gt; -window 'shading'

Toys.  Again, not important.

&gt; -automatic window positioning (in kde - if you have a window open in the top
&gt; left corner, the next one you open will likely appear in the bottom right
&gt; etc.)

That was normal in a number of older window managers, including twm.
I don't know of any X-based window manager that doesn't try something
like that.

&gt; -windows 'click onto' borders of screen or other windows.

Not sure I understand this.  Doesn't sound very important.  Do you
mean that they line up touching each other?  Others do that too.

&gt; -hold down ALT and click on any part of a window to move it.

I've found KDE singularly deficient in such mouse/keyboard
combinations.  Many functions require finding buttons on the title bar
and clicking on them.  I'm writing this on a 2048x1536 display, and
it's really difficult to position exactly on the buttons.  fwwm2
doesn't require this.  How do I do the following in KDE without first
positioning on a button?

- iconify a window?
- lower a window?
- raise a window?
- maximize a window?

&gt; -middle click the 'maximize' button to only enlarge the window
&gt;  vertically

Meaning you have to find the "maximze" button first.  

&gt; -right-click the 'maximize' button to only enlarge the window
&gt;  horizontally

Again.

&gt; -and i dont have the time to list off the billion other things that
&gt; windows doesnt have...

We're talking about innovation, not "Windows".

&gt; KDE does have a look of its own. IMHO it looks MUCH nicer than any
&gt; windows!

To each his own, of course.

&gt; To make it look and work completely different to windows is to make
&gt; it different to what most of us are used to and yet another learning
&gt; curve for people switching to linux (and those of us who have used
&gt; linux for years).  KDE is developed by people who use it.  There is
&gt; a LOT in KDE that isn't in ANY other GUI!  It is unique, not a
&gt; clone.

It's a development from the same base that spawned just about every
other window environment.

&gt; And if they didn't copy the basic functionality of windows, people
&gt; would turn around and say 'see? your gui doesn't do that'.  So they
&gt; really cant win can they?

Correct.  That's unfortunate, but also not the issue.

&gt; Gnome 2 is nice too....but lacking in features.  I like it and have
&gt; used it in the past, but i missed kde's rich feature set and groovy
&gt; eye candy so i switched back again.... (does the 'ability to choose'
&gt; qualify as 'innovation'?).

&gt; anyway, my last point is one that many people will relate to:
&gt;
&gt; The ability to triple-click to select an entire line of text.

This is an X feature.  It's been there for over 10 years.

In my upcoming book "The Complete FreeBSD" I describe the basics of
using KDE as well as I can in 3 pages.  I'd welcome your input on the
content.  Let me know if you're interested.  Originally I had planned
to write more, but it's very difficult to find a consistent set of
information that will fit in a small space and help people find a
start with the product.

In addition, I found I was disappointed with KDE.  I played around
with Gnome for a while, and I was more disappointed with that.  But
ignoring eye candy (which isn't really the UNIX Way), what does KDE
give you that fvwm2 doesn't?  Looking at the list above, I'd say:

- much more difficult to configure.

And that's really about it.  I don't want to go on about the
advantages of fvwm2; if you're interested, it's described after KDE in
the book.
