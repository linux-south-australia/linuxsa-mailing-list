&gt;&gt; So: what should I replace it with?  LCD panels still have too low a
&gt;&gt; resolution to be interesting.  I find that I can get the following
&gt;&gt; monitors relatively easily.  They're all 21" (i.e. 20" visible),
&gt;&gt; though some claim to be 22".
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Model		Dot pitch		Horizontal freq.	price
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Benq P211	  0.25"			115 kHz			$1,080
&gt;&gt; NEC FP1355	  0.24"			121 kHz			$1,300
&gt;&gt; Mitsubishi 2115E  0.25"		115 kHz			$1,200
&gt;&gt; Mitsubishi 2060u  0.25"		121 kHz			$1,500
&gt;&gt; Samsung 1100P+	  0.25"		115 kHz			$1,300
&gt;&gt; Philips 201B	  0.25" 		107 kHz			$1,060
&gt;&gt; Philips 202B	  0.24" 		130 kHz			$1,660
&gt;&gt; Sony CPDG520      0.24"		?			$1,900
&gt;&gt; Hitachi CM 823F	  0.25"		121 kHz			$1,550
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; On the face of it, there's not much to choose between any of them
&gt;&gt; except the Sony, which is too expensive for my liking.  The only of
&gt;&gt; these manufacturers I've had experience with is Hitachi (with whom I'm
&gt;&gt; quite happy; I have two 813 monitors with 115 kHz scan).  On the face
&gt;&gt; of it, Benq or maybe Mitsubish look like being the best bet.  Does
&gt;&gt; anybody have experience with any of these monitors?
&gt;
&gt; the sony may be expensive, but i would say they are the best monitors in
&gt; my office.

I have had more trouble with Sony and Trinitron tubes than with
anything else.  I know they're very popular, but I really have never
seen any evidence that they're worth the trouble.

&gt; we do have a range of similarly spec'd monitors, and i would choose
&gt; the mitsubishi or the philips ... or an ADI. don't go for the
&gt; cheaper Benqs or LGs. i have replaced more of those over the years
&gt; thand i care to mention.

Thanks, that's the sort of information I'm looking for.  Comparing the
prices of the "cheap" Mitsu and the Benq, I was tending that way.

&gt; oh and check the warranty period, some manufacturers offer up to
&gt; three years by default, others only six months ...

All I've seen here have 3 years on site warranty.  I suppose it
depends on the size of the monitor :-)

&gt; if you're tempted by an LCD take a first look at the Samsung, they
&gt; are the biggest manufacturer ATM and have just brought online
&gt; several new plants in SE Asia to fill the demand, they're the ducks
&gt; nuts and better priced than most others, especially in the larger
&gt; formats. IIRR the 17" LCDs just released? are the cheapest for
&gt; $/inch =)

I'm looking for resolution, not size.
