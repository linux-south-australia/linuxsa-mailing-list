&gt;&gt; That said, it's surprising that so little real innovation has
&gt;&gt; come out of the OSS world. The main examples I can think of are:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -	TeX: perhaps the first serious piece of open source software,
&gt;&gt; 	which showed the way for others.
&gt;&gt; -	X Window System: given away as source on tapes from the
&gt;&gt; beginning,
&gt;&gt; 	and the first generally available network-transparent windowing
&gt;&gt; 	system as far as I know.
&gt;&gt; -	Perl
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; But these go back into ancient history.
&gt;
&gt; While we're getting into ancient history here, what about Unix itself?
&gt; Wasn't it (and indeed, almost all early software (before the mid 70s)
&gt; effectively open, although not licensed as such? I thought that it (or
&gt; at least ye olde BSD versions) was usually distributed freely to whoever
&gt; wanted it, and the comunity was effectively open, even if not legally
&gt; so.

Unfortunately, it wasn't quite that good.  BSD UNIX never became free:
before BSD became free, it had to shed the "UNIX" name.

In the 70s, UNIX was initially not available At All outside AT&T.
Finally they licensed it to universities only.  BSD code (until the
early 90s, that meant the additional code needed to convert AT&T UNIX
into BSD UNIX) was available "for free", which meant $1000 for a tape.


&gt;&gt; Were these OSS innovations? (I really don't know.)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -	e-mail, SMTP
&gt;&gt; -	SNMP
&gt;&gt; -	IRC
&gt;&gt; -	HTTP/HTML
&gt;&gt; -	PHP
&gt;&gt; -	Python
&gt;
&gt; I think (at least for the protocols listed above) that they were Open
&gt; Systems rather than open source. Protocols like SMTP can't be Open
&gt; Source, as they aren't source -- they are protocols. 

Sure, but pretty much the first implementation was sendmail, which has
always been free.

&gt; Basically, every internet standard is open, as I understand. Anyone
&gt; can implement them however they want, open or closed.

Most of the original implementations of the Internet Protocols was
done in BSD, and was thus open source subject to the issues I mention
above.
