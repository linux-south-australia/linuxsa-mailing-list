&gt; &gt; Part of the reason the LinuxSA list and community is so vibrant is
&gt; &gt; because we don't limit discussion on the list to purely technical
&gt; &gt; matters, nor are we overtly upset by humour.
&gt; 
&gt; Or lack of it....
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Forums (such as IRC) where the censorship of humour happens every so
&gt; &gt; often are silent, dull and boring. 
&gt; 
&gt; That depends entirely on which irc channels you hang out in. On EFNET
&gt; (one of the busiest groups of irc servers) there are many linux help
&gt; channels which have large numbers of people coming or going or simply
&gt; lurking, and humour plays an important role in the health of the channel
&gt; conversation. Humour to the detriment of channel participants however,
&gt; is strongly discouraged. As is racist, sexist, and other socially
&gt; inappropriate comments that are just as unacceptable in real life as
&gt; they are on irc. See www.irchelp.org for some docs on irc ettiquette.
&gt; 
&gt; The #linuxsa channel where some find it amusing to denigrate others by
&gt; abusing a priviledge is an exception. In the 7 years I've been on EFNET
&gt; such behaviour would automatically result in a kickban from the channel.
&gt; Repeat offenders would recieve a permban. In #linuxsa however no such
&gt; sanctions are ever enforced, and so the behaviour could be construed as
&gt; having tacit approval.
&gt; 
&gt; Similarly flame wars on this mailing list are not moderated at all, but
&gt; if they continue for too long, over too trivial a matter, they
&gt; eventually get complaints from other list members.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Besides which, I'm reasonably certain
&gt; &gt; I haven't seen other people helping out at InstallFest, Conference
&gt; &gt; Organisations or such...
&gt; 
&gt; Your point is....?
&gt; 
&gt; I help out literally hundreds of people on a daily basis with their
&gt; linux problems on EFNET's #linuxhelp and #redhat, and I'm reasonably
&gt; certain I haven't seen you in those forums either! Just because you are
&gt; active locally, doesn't grant you any more rights than others who may
&gt; prefer anonymity over ego gratification. Does it? Or do you feel that
&gt; your local contributions grants you authority over, and to speak for,
&gt; the masses?
&gt; 
&gt; Besides which I was told point blank by yourself my help was neither
&gt; wanted NOR required. So am I to be blamed for taking you at your word?
&gt; Or was that another example of "humour"? Can you please make at least
&gt; some attempt at making it obvious when something is a joke?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; *hmmm*
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; DSL
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmmm?

I'm sorry you've had some bad experiences Alex.

The age old question rises again, how can a person express humour in a
print medium where people can't see facial expressions etc?

Someone and I had a run in a few years ago,someone sent me a private
message partly in answer to a question I'd posted that I thought was
rude. I posted the message and my answer to LinuxSA asking who this
person was. Richard Sharpe answered me saying he thought he knew who it
was and he'd handle it. So David was it you? Do you remember? I know
David better now and I'm not so touchy, not that I'd let anyone get away
with bad behaviour.

If you don't know a person well their writing style etc can be off
putting. Not that that excuses rudeness etc.

David your bluntness and sticking literally to what you meant by what
you typed can be taken as insulting, rude and a put down. Words in
sentences and sentences in paragraphs, there can often be a second or
third meaning assumed by different readers. Accept this David and look
at what you're writing from more than 1 point of view (put yourself in
someone elses shoes) and think "Can my meaning/intention here be
misconstrued?" You might think why should I bother with what they think
about what I wrote. 

We are in a service industry, others are looking to us at work, at home
and on this list for help with their Linux. Cop it sweet and behave
yourselves. If we want some humour and it's good to have (yeah I made a
doosie of a blunder yesterday see messages re Sun) we need first to be
able to laugh at ourselves. As Aussies we're the best in the world at
that and if we can laugh at ourselves we're less likely to take others
poking at us as seriously.

Alex, more than a couple of years ago someone was kicked off this list
for being rude, obstrepolous and nasty, he hasn't come back. There are
those of us who tell David to pull his head in occasionally.

There is more than 1 side to all disagreements. Look for it!! It's
called Interpersonal Skills.

ps I don't usually say much.
