&gt; &gt; My recommendation for a Windows system would be to make use of it's own

&gt; 
&gt; When you say a "Windows system," are you talking about a purely Windows
&gt; environment?  If so I couldn't agree more.

Sorry, not really clear enough. I meant in any environment. So, I'd have
my Windows clients authenticate against a UNIX/Samba PDC, instead of
installing (say) NISGINA on each workstation and having them
authenticate against a UNIX/NIS+ server.

&gt; Encrypt passwords is set to yes.  I think with Windows XP it is a
&gt; requirement for Samba to have "encrypt passwords" set to yes.  Is this a

It's not required - there's a magic registry entry for turning it off at
the client end. This can be put in a group policy file even :-). It's
still advisable though.

&gt; complication when authenticating with PAM, if so, how so, and what do you
&gt; do about it?

It stems from the fact that both Windows and the standard UNIX passwd
files both make one-way hashes of their passwords. These are both
incompatible, so when a Windows user authenticates using
encrypted/hashed passwords, there is no way to convert that password
into something that can successfully be compared against the contents of
the /etc/passwd file. The only time Windows (in theory) sends the
password across the network in plain text is when the password is being
changed from the magic dialog box. It is possible for Samba to (before
is hashes the password) write the password to the UNIX password database
(/etc/passwd, NIS, LDAP, etc) in the form that it requires and then
write it to the smbpasswd file in the NT-style hashes.

&gt; &gt; This one kinda depends on what the modems are plugged into. If it's some
&gt; &gt; kind of RADIUS speaking device, it can use RADIUS :-).
&gt; 
&gt; They're currently connected to a NT RAS server on serial ports, and they're
&gt; just modems, but I'd like to move them to FreeBSD eventually.  I assume
&gt; that if I configure that NT server to authenticate against the Samba
&gt; domain, which authenticates to LDAP through PAM, those current RAS users
&gt; can still authenticate against NT, through PAM to LDAP, right? :)  ...
&gt; without any additional configurations.

Yep. Should work :-)


&gt; LDAP to me is the most difficult part at this time.  It's one of the
&gt; reasons I never bothered with it when I began this project, because I
&gt; didn't want to tackle too much at once.  It seems like something reasonably
&gt; complicated.

Do you have any specific questions?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * Turn on password encryption on the Samba PDC
&gt; 
&gt; (as above) how does this integrate with PAM?

(as above) see above :-)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * Have Samba compiled and configured to store it's authentication in
&gt; &gt; 	the same LDAP directory
&gt; 
&gt; Oh -- so Samba authenticates outside of PAM, directly into LDAP, whereas
&gt; everything else authenticates through PAM into LDAP?

Yes, sorry. Should have been more clear.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * Configure Samba to update unix passwords (unix passwd sync smb.conf 
&gt; &gt; 	option) in the LDAP directory when Samba password changes
&gt; 
&gt; Well that answers that, it must, or that wouldn't work.  If I turn on "unix
&gt; password sync," is that all I need to do once Samba is compiled with
&gt; --enable-ldap (or whatever it is?)

It's a little less straightforward than that. You need to:

 * compile with --enable-ldap
 * configure the ldap* options in smb.conf (check smb.conf(5))
 * configure turn on unix passwd sync
 * configure the passwd chat smb.conf option to use a tool like
ldappasswd to update the UNIX account info in the LDAP directory.

All of this should be in the Samba HOWTO Collection, Samba PDC HOWTO
and/or the Samba LDAP HOWTO. If not, do a search of the
<A HREF="mailto:samba-ntdom@samba.org">samba-ntdom@samba.org</A> mailing list. There was a lady from a
University(?) that published a detailed account of how she set this up.
It was about 2-3 years ago and the LDAP code hadn't yet made it into a
Samba release, but it's worth looking at if you can't find anything else
(even if just for the ldappasswd / passwd chat stuff).

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * Let users change their passwords using the Windows control panel
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any functionality for strong passwording or forced password
&gt; changes every n days, because as far as I know, PAM can do this.  Can Samba
&gt; do it when querying LDAP directly, or do I still have to wait for Samba
&gt; 3.x?

See if this was answered in my last e-mail. I think it's possible to
force a change every so often without too much drama. I haven't tried
forcing a cracklib-style password policy, but let me know how you go :-)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * Use Directory Administrator or some custom tool for your own
&gt; &gt; 	management purposes.
&gt; 
&gt; Directory Administrator?  An LDAP tool?

Yep. Sorry. It's a GUI tool that's handy for the day-to-day running of
user accounts stored in an LDAP directory. It supports unix accounts,
Samba accounts, mail routing and a few other things. It's designed to
hide the gory details from your common user.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   * The dialup lines can use one or more of the above methods or you can
&gt; &gt; 	set up FreeRADIUS on one of the UNIX machines and tell it to use
&gt; &gt; 	PAM and therefore the LDAP directory.
&gt; 
&gt; That was the option I was considering for these users.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for your input so far :)

I hope that it helps.
