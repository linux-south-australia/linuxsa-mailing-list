May not be a bottleneck due to read caching from multiple servers.

$1000 for 60GB SCSI, $390 for 160GB IDE. The choice is easy. :)

Network speeds are blazingly slow compared to disk speeds. A single IDE 
can flood a Gigabit connection.

&gt; just assume it will make 100BaseT a bottleneck. How can I overcome 
&gt; this?

Multiple fileservers. You could use more network ports, but there's two 
other factors worth considering.

	How do you back the fileserver up?

	How important is the data?

It sounds like you have limited funds, so I would pick up two well 
built mid-range tower case PCs and install them with Linux. Shove in 4 
or 8 hard drives (Maxtor 160GB 5400rpm for $390 is the cheapest I've 
found), software RAID them together, and get the second one backing up 
the first one as a hot swap.

More network ports will be a big help as the network switch backplane 
is measured in multiple Gb/sec, even with 100Mbit ports. This brings 
your network speed up to worrying about disk I/O again, so you can 
double the available throughput by having the machines backing each 
other up and both being servers. I think it's unlikely you'll get to 
this stage though.

If the data is important, consider a third PC stored in another 
building altogether and keep it in sync over a network connection. This 
will enable recovery even if the main place burns down.
