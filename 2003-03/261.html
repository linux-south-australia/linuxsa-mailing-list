First, I should mention that since I use Netscape about every day,  that 
I _do_ appreciate the work being done on Mozilla.  
I appologize if I came accross in the wrong way.   :-)   And if anyone 
here personally works on Mozilla, I want to thank you.

&gt;&gt; I have seen this if the $HOME/.mozilla/~/.prefs.js file gets written

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; actually, websites can *never* write to files on your HD, unless it's 
&gt; a (major) security hole[1].
&gt;
&gt; what actually happens with mozilla's prefs.js is that it gets read on 
&gt; startup, and gets written on shutdown, 

Do you think Mozilla will decide to break up the prefs.js file into 
little ~/.mozilla/uniqueid/etc/.conf files?  


&gt; every time. so if something happens and mozilla screws up somehow, it 
&gt; can write out a corrupt prefs.js file on shutdown, thus screwing up 
&gt; your settings. there's a bug filed on this currently ( 
&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id</A>=17053&gt; ) that should be 
&gt; fixed before the 1.3 release. (checks bugzilla...) in fact, it's fixed 
&gt; now. fantastic.

Some of the staff here just like seeing what they are used to.   So I am 
_hoping_ that I can somehow apply the fix above to Netscape.

On my machine, Netscape is installed but not Mozilla.  Well, actually, I 
guess its a part of Netscape 7.0.

Can I get the fixed version of Mozilla inside of Netscape?  or Phoenix? 
 Or can I take stuff out of Mozilla that is in Netscape to make it more 
like Phoenix

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Although I have seen this on Netscape. You will find that an older 
&gt;&gt; prefs.bak may do just fine. Otherwise, some people just rename their 
&gt;&gt; unique directory that is under .mozilla and they see a performance 
&gt;&gt; boost. If you make the file read only,then people can't set bookmarks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i'm not quite sure why this would be - the bookmarks are actually 
&gt; stored on the bookmarks.html file under your mozilla profile dir. 

Agreed its not a bookmarking problem.   :-[

&gt;
&gt;&gt; As a side note, its my opinion, that Mozilla has two major flaws to 
&gt;&gt; it. 1) a configuration file exposed to the Internet (prefs.js)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; i'm pretty sure this isn't actually true.

Agreed.

&gt;
&gt;&gt; 2) trying to turn the browser into an application engine
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; this is a slightly valid accusation - mozilla-the-platform has 
&gt; probably detracted from mozilla-as-purely-a-browser. but, look at the 
&gt; massive positive outcomes - there's gecko-based browsers for almost 
&gt; every platform (mozilla itself being one of them), the multitude of 
&gt; projects at mozdev.org, heck, there's even an IDE based on the mozilla 
&gt; platform. pretty impressive for what was ostensibly a "browser". 


Yeah, you are right.  When I think about the projects at mozdev.org, I 
get excited.... :-)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; then again, netscape has always been focussed on being more than just 
&gt; a browser. that's why MS went after them in the first place, they 
&gt; threatened the proprietary-mess of windows with a generic interface.
&gt;
&gt; James, if you really want a mozilla that is just a browser, phoenix 
&gt; (soon to be renamed) could be the go for you. it's a browser-only app, 
&gt; no bloat, and fast. it's pretty good. 

Depending on what I can realistically do with Netscape, I am probably 
going to try it for myself. :-)

&gt; [1] there was a somewhat famous case of the MS IE javascript engine 
&gt; allowing a malicious script to overwrite any arbitrary file on your 
&gt; machine - including the krnl32.dll (or whatever the windows kernel 
&gt; library is called) just by visiting a page. scary.
