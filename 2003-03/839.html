&gt;&gt; I think we're looking at things from different perspectives. Innovation
&gt;&gt; and copying are two different issues, and I personally
&gt;&gt; would rather see good tools coming out than copies of bad ones.
&gt;
&gt; From my perspective, the first time I saw a LaTeX document, I was
&gt; extremely impressed.  My favorite word processor is LyX.   Granted,  if
&gt; I knew my LaTeX macros my favorite would just be TeX, but I need the GUI
&gt; training wheels. I do realize that if I already knew the macros the GUI
&gt; would in fact slow me down, even though I would consider LyX and my
&gt; machine to be "fast." The training wheels got me to the point where I
&gt; can do a very simple, minimal LaTeX job.

I cut my teeth on plain TeX.  It's like sendmail: once you get the
*&&*( thing to work, you've invested so much effort that you don't
want to change.  I tried to convince O'Reilly to let me write my first
book in TeX.  They refused.  I later thanked them.

&gt; But there was a time in my life when I knew nothing of LaTeX or LyX
&gt; , a time when I had no concept of one of my favorite tools.
&gt;
&gt; I am sure this is true of Troff, in my case.  I haven't been around
&gt; long enough to know what it means to create a quality printout.

One of the problems with TeX, and LaTeX in particular, is that the
finished document reaches out, grabs you and shouts, "Look at me!  I
was formatted with TeX!".  It doesn't have to be that way, of course.
It's at least partially the fonts, but nearly every TeX document I've
seen is recognizable.  That's bad in my book.

&gt; I have an older Hayden Series book formatted with troff, or some
&gt; such, and I like the print.

troff gives you more control over the appearance.  That's why I use
it.  For example, take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-jan2003.html">http://www.lemis.com/grog/diary-jan2003.html</A>#2, which shows the first
page of a chapter on Email.  As you can see from the description, it
wasn't easy to get it to perform this kind of formatting.  I doubt you
could do it with any other formatting package, however, possibly
excepting TeX or Frame.  This is the point I was making to Steve
earlier today: I have better tools than OpenOffice.  I want ones which
are even better.

&gt; So my question is this: Is there a LyX type tool for Troff, that is,
&gt; a GUI based set of training wheels that will ease me into learning
&gt; Troff?

No, that's really the wrong way to go.  I don't like LyX for some of
the same reasons I don't like OpenOffice: it hides things from you.

The good news is that troff is much easier than TeX.  Also, you can
get the definitive book, by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty, at
<A HREF="http://www.alltel.net/~kollar/utp/.">http://www.alltel.net/~kollar/utp/.</A>

&gt; Is Troff a good tool to use, or has it been improved upon by another
&gt; Unix tool?

troff is considered obsolescent.  I use it because it works and I can
do the things that I want with it.  The modern "replacement" is SGML,
usually with the DocBook DTD, but it's a bit like a straitjacket.  I'm
beginning to think that it's a step in the wrong direction.

&gt; P.S. What do you edit your web pages with?

Emacs.

&gt; How do you get it to have the look it has?  It uses the white space
&gt; very well.

Are you talking about the source or the finished page?  I don't think
my pages look particularly good, but the source is easier to read,
which is important because that's what I edit.  After editing it, I
pass it through the W3 Consortium's HTML tidy program, which reformats
it and also validates the HTML.  I used to have lots of syntax errors
in the HTML, which typically didn't make any difference for most
people, but which did very strange things to some people on occasion.
