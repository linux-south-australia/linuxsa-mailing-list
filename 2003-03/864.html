&gt; &gt; Nope, but it is pretty close.  If you read my post you'll see I wasn't

&gt; 
&gt; they are like windows because they are all GUIs.  There are a lot of features 
&gt; in windows that a lot of people want.  Therefore those features have been 
&gt; implemented in kde because of demand (kde is developed by people who use it - 
&gt; there is no company behind it saying it must have this and that feature).  

...as for all the desktop Linux projects AFAIK.

&gt; Not all of these features are implemented exactly as in windows, (eg. window 
&gt; manager behaviour) some have been improved upon - although many just ignore 
&gt; this and say its 'not significant enough to call it innovation'...
&gt; 
&gt; i dont think you'll find too many GUIs that aren't like windows in some way.  
&gt; dont forget windows 95 wasnt original either.
&gt; it would be interesting to know what you use as a desktop.

I use an open-source non-dogmatic desktop.  It's a mixture of GNOME 1.x,
2.x, bits of KDE, and OpenOffice.  If you think I'm arguing from a
Windows viewpoint you're wrong - I haven't used Windows at home for 3
years - but all I'm saying is we generally copy, not innovate, on the
desktop.  This thread hasn't convinced me otherwise.
 
I believe there's plenty of OSS innovation, just generally not on the
desktop.
