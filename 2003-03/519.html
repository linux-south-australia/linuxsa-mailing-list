 &gt; Worse, if you are using flash for a menu, and don't provide an

Flash menus are the complete antithesis of Luke's reasons for using
Flash in the first place.

He said:

 % Regardless of open source or not, I find Macromedia software incredibly
 % versatile and useful. In particular flash is an advanced vehicle for
 % presentation of all sorts of Multimedia with minimal file sizes.

... then he started talking about *menus*.  A menu is not "all sorts
of Multimedia" and the Flash version of a menu is likely to result in
a file size at least 100 times larger than a JavaScript menu which
looks exactly the same (!), and which works in every browser (since
it's easy to provide a non-Javascript static HTML menu for Javascript
challenged browsers)

The AustralianIT news site replaced the JavaScript menus down the 
left hand side of their article pages with a Flash menu about six
months ago. 

That change crapped me off for two reasons.  The first reason was 
that I could no longer navigate their web site to find the columnists
I was fond of reading;  The second reason was that when I found a 
flash-enabled PC and had a look at what they'd done, I found that
the Flash version of the menu was visually and behaviourally identical
to the JavaScript version of the same menu which used to work in almost
every browser.

That change was completely pointless -- It didn't add any new functionality,
it didn't make anything look prettier;  but it completely removed my
ability to find content on their web site, because they don't provide
their old flash-free front page anymore.  And I'm not even blind;  I'd
hate to think about what Flash does to the accessibility of web sites
for people with diabilities!

In summary:  If you want to produce jazzy content with animation, 
sound effects, full-on user interaction, and all the bells and whistles,
then by all means run away to your Flash authoring suite and go for your
life.

But if you're going to use Flash for something as mundane and essential
as a navigation menu (especially if it's the only navigation menu you 
plan to provide), then think seriously about what you're doing any why
you're doing it.  Perhaps, just perhaps, it's the completely wrong tool
for the job.
