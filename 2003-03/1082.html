&gt;Hi y'all,
&gt;
&gt;I have a Dell Dimension 2350, which has an intel 845G chipset (with a
&gt;Celeron 1.7. I've installed RedHat 8, and had some fun with the network
&gt;card (anyone heard of Broadcom 4401? RedHat hasn't... driver located
&gt;eventually at ASUS website). At this stage, though, the X server is not
&gt;behaving. After successfully configuring itself, and appearing to work
&gt;ok in the process of configuring, whenever it starts, the monitor lights
&gt;flicker like there's a sync problem, and it just dies.
&gt;
&gt;I haven't had a problem like this in some time -- mostly, I work with
&gt;headless servers, or machines with well-known video cards that just
&gt;work. So, I don't really know where to start looking. I've checked
&gt;/var/log/XFree86.0.log, and found nothing of interest there.
&gt;
&gt;Anyone got any ideas or experience with this particular problem?
&gt;
Dude, talk about a coincidence. I was dealing with that tonight.

Anyway, if your Dell model uses the Intel 8281OE graphics card, here is 
where you want to go:

The release notes above were key, however, there were some things I 
changed to fit my needs for SuSE Linux 8.1. This is what I did:

1. I downloaded the XFC_i810 rpm <A HREF="file:">file:</A>
<A HREF="http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?agr">http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?agr</A>=N&ProductID=798&DwnldID=2702

2. I installed it by double clicking on it

3. I ran sax2 to reconfigure my monitor. (I noted that the graphics card 
was detected. I kept the VESA monitor settings as detected, but whilst 
in Sax, said that the desktop was to be 1064x...)

4. I created this symbolic link: (Note SuSE uses /usr/X11R6/bin/ and not 
/etc/X11)
ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_SVGA /usr/X11R6/bin/X

5. I loaded the driver:
modprobe agpgart

6. I rebooted.

It worked alright from here.

Manually editing the XFree86Config was not necessary.
