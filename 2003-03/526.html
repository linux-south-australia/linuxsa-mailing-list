 &gt; &gt; In summary:  If you want to produce jazzy content with animation,

 &gt; &gt; life.
 &gt; 
 &gt; But being a Linux user,

Them's fighting words.  FreeBSD :-)

 &gt; wouldn't you be able to prefer to support such things?  You may choose
 &gt; not to run flash, but what about when you can't?

What's this "can't" stuff?

Every single time I've encountered an obnoxious web site, I've -always-
had the option to simply not go there again.  One doesn't need to invest
much conscious thought in that decision, because there's very little 
on the web that you can't get from lots of other places on the web.
If a site pisses you off, blacklist it and move on.  It's not like your
life will be any less enriched because you're not visiting 
www.obnoxiousflash.com anymore, is it?

 &gt; An article I once followed when trying to install flash told me not to go
 &gt; to the shockwave.com website, or Mozilla would crash.  Of course, I did,
 &gt; and sure enough it crashed!
 &gt; The problem here was that the plugin was written by some unknown, and not
 &gt; by Macromedia.  It was unstable and buggy, and there is just no version
 &gt; available for my OS/Browser combination that is supported.
 
... which is one of the reasons why flash is obnoxious.

(don't fall into the belief that the plugin is any less likely to crash
when it -is- written by Macromedia!)

 &gt; &gt; But if you're going to use Flash for something as mundane and essential
 &gt; &gt; as a navigation menu (especially if it's the only navigation menu you 
 &gt; &gt; plan to provide), then think seriously about what you're doing any why
 &gt; &gt; you're doing it.  Perhaps, just perhaps, it's the completely wrong tool
 &gt; &gt; for the job.
 &gt; 
 &gt; What about when it's the right tool?

Then use it.  Expect your audience to be smaller than it would be if you
didn't use it, but don't let me stand in the way of that decision if that's
the one you want to make.

 &gt; Sure, navigation is questionable, but
 &gt; then there are those websites that I simply could never visit, just because
 &gt; of lack of support, and they're designed with Flash for a reason, not just
 &gt; because they can be.  And i'm talking about games/cartoons -- that kind of
 &gt; thing.  Not necessarily the front end of a big corporate website -- I'm
 &gt; talking about all the crud that fills the Internet ;P

Which nicely backs up my point.  Do you feel like your quality of life
is diminished because you haven't looked at that crud?

 &gt; On a similar note:
 &gt; I went to the BankSA website and I had no java-vm.  Mozilla led me to a
 &gt; page which would let me install it, but of course without my root
 &gt; privileges, I wasn't able to.  Is the next course of action to load mozilla
 &gt; with root privileges whilst running X?

No, the next action is to read the mozilla docs, where it talks at length
about how to handle the situation you've described.
  
 &gt; Why wouldn't the authors of Mozilla write their plugin installations in
 &gt; such a way that accommodates Unix users

They did. :-)
