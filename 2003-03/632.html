This e-mail's quite long and hopefully some use. I've tried to address
the first question and most of the rest in the first chunk and I'll try
to address the bits I've missed as I get to them.

&gt; On this topic, what is generally seen as the "best" way to authenticate
&gt; users?

It depends a great deal on which platforms are involved. A Linux,
FreeBSD or Solaris system (maybe HP/UX) all support PAM. This allows
most (if not all) services to use a standard API to manage
authentication. Behind PAM, it's possible to change where the
authentication information (username, password, login restrictions, etc)
is stored. It might be in a particular format of text file (/etc/passwd)
or in a database stored on another host, which you could access using
some standard protocol such as LDAP or NIS+. Or it could even be a
not-so-standard protocol like SMB/CIFS/MSRPC, where the database at the
other end is the registry.

Most systems have an architecturally similar pluggable authentication
system. Mac OS/X has one and also makes use of PAM and Windows NT
codebase systems (NT,2K,XP) systems have something called GINA. These
all do functionally the same thing - allow applications writers to say
to the system "authenticate this user". The system can then be
configured to use one particular type of authentication over another.

The problem is that for many systems, there are a limited number of
authentication modules available for most systems. Linux PAM has a very
large number of modules available (not just for authentication), whereas
Windows, for example, has very few. The two you're most likely to come
across for Windows are the Netware client, which installs a GINA and a
GINA called NISGINA, which allows an NT machine to authenticate off a
NIS+ server.

My recommendation for a Windows system would be to make use of it's own
native protocols. Many applications make an assumption that this will be
the case and it will save you much grief later.

For Apple systems, you can either use the standard password file stuff
that's implemented natively, or make use of an LDAP or Active Directory
directory.

For Linux and other PAM-enabled systems, I'd go with whatever you like
:-). LDAP is quite popular and a personal favourite of mine and has
other advantages which I'll try to cover a little further down this
page.

&gt; I have set up a Samba domain as you all know from recent posts (Regarding
&gt; the thread "FW: I just can't do it.")  No decisions have been made about
&gt; that yet.
&gt; 
&gt; I still need to think about the bigger picture.  What is the best method
&gt; for integrating authentication into one central place?  PAM, using what
&gt; method?

Questions to ask yourself:

 * Which services will be running on which platforms and do they do any
	authentication?
 * How does each particular service handle authentication?

&gt; I will be authenticating the following:
&gt; 
&gt; 	o  A Red Hat server with clients connecting via Telnet

telnetd on RedHat Linux (since version 5.x?) supports PAM and therefore
everything PAM can use as a password backend.

&gt; 	o  Clients connecting via SSH

SSHd also supports PAM and it's backends

&gt; 	o  Clients authenticating from Windows workstations via a Samba
&gt; 	   Domain

When using the 'encrypt passwords = no' option in smb.conf, Samba can
(if compiled to do so) authenticate using PAM. If you have the 'encrypt
passwords' option set to yes, you cannot.

Samba itself can store passwords in a variety of different ways
(smbpasswd text file, LDAP directory, TDB)

&gt; 	o  VPN through Cisco 827/IPSEC (TBA)

I think most IPSec implementations can use either a shared key or
certificate-based authentication to start the actual VPN session. The
Cisco one may also be able to authenticate using a protocol such as
RADIUS or even Microsoft's NT Domain / RPC crud.

After the session's set up, it's up to the service being used by the
user to make sure that the individual user is authenticated properly.

&gt; 	o  Dial-Up clients

This one kinda depends on what the modems are plugged into. If it's some
kind of RADIUS speaking device, it can use RADIUS :-). It may be an NT
box or a Linux box and would therefore most likely suffer from the same
authentication deficiencies as the platform at the other end.

&gt; The one big piece of the puzzle which is missing so far is centralized
&gt; authentication.  I have a big idea of exactly how this should work, but
&gt; what is the solution I'm looking for?
