Richard,

&gt; OK, ye people who are familiar with both *roff and [La]TeX, why did
&gt; Knuth write TeX if troff existed?

I think the answer to that may be lost in the annals of history. The TeX
philosophy is quite interesting - remember that Knuth is a professor of
mathematics (should that be capitalised?) and it shows in TeX. In fact,
now that I recall correctly he wrote TeX because there weren't any
typesetting tools in existence that could easily [for some definition of
easy] typeset maths symbols and equations.

Plain TeX (a set of TeX macros - one rarely writes TeX itself which is
HORRID) is what most people call "writing TeX".

&gt; Are they pretty much equivalent?

They look different.

&gt; Whish is "better", or for what purposes are they suited?

LaTeX is not TeX. It is a set of macros written in TeX. One can write
TeX in LaTeX though. 

TeX: It's an excellent typesetting language, if a little arcane,
fantastically logical and extraordinarily detailed to the Nth degree. It
can be very easy to use or very difficult. Unless you know what you're
doing I'd suggest using LaTeX.

LaTeX: It's an excellent set of macros built in TeX. It's much more
understandable, lets you worry more about your content than presentation
(it makes a lot of typesetting decisions for you, and some of them are
totally unintuitive. For example, the size of a LaTeX page is dreadfully
small when compared to a page made up under Word or Open Office, but
over years of practice it is beyond reasonable doubt that humans find it
easiest to read about 66 - 72 characters in any one line and that's it).
You can do fairly much anything you want in LaTeX although attempting to
force a style on it can be vewry difficult.
