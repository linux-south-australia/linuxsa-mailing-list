Hi Kim, all,

&gt; After browsing through this I read through all the /var entries.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, I've read various configuration guides as to how to 
&gt; split these file systems across disks/partitions, and I've 
&gt; wondered about whether or no to split /var off onto its own 
&gt; disk. Especially for a mail server or log server ...
&gt; 
&gt; Some guides say "don't do it", others are fairly vague on the issue.

Hmm... surprised to hear guides saying "don't do it", unless these are
for desktop systems...

&gt; 
&gt; So, the question is, what is the experience of the list on this?
&gt; 
&gt; For a mail server for example, should /var be a separate 
&gt; disk, or should the IMAP/POP server have its mail folders in 
&gt; home on its own disk ... or is there a better scheme?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a good reason not to split /var onto its own disk 
&gt; from the root volume? Like it needs to be mounted at boot 
&gt; time for XXX reason.

/var is commonly separate from /. This is because you do NOT, under any
circumstances want to fill / up. That would be bad. Filling /var up is
also bad, but won't kill your server entirely, just most of the daemons.
/var does need to be mounted as daemons come up, but usually it would
come up at a similar time to /usr, and most daemons would be run from
/usr... so it should be fine...

One thing to think about is that if a server has a specific other
function, like it's a proxy, or a mail server, then the relevant
directory there could be made its own partition with some real benefit.
For eg, /var/spool/mail or /var/cache/squid could be separate. This
means that if that particular function goes wrong somehow, and the
partition fills up, everything else keeps working, so it's easier to
fix.

Also consider backups -- you may not want to backup /var/cache/squid at
all... and if you're using dump, putting it on a separate partition
helps. Perhaps there are different file access patterns, and you want to
use reiser for the squid cache, as it's fast for small files, and ext3
on a software RAID mirror for reliability...

Of course, you must balance this with the simplicity and flexibility of
one partition for everything, esp on a insignificant server or a
desktop...

Anyway, that's some food for thought.
