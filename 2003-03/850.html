&gt; &gt; I dont find it difficult.  But that all depends on the 
&gt; individual and 
&gt; &gt; what you're used to.
&gt; 
&gt; Indeed.  If you don't know anything better, it beats the hell 
&gt; out of using a typewriter.
&gt; 
&gt; The real problem I have here is that it's "good enough" for 
&gt; most people.  They don't realize that they can do so much 
&gt; better with other interfaces, and the other interfaces 
&gt; require them to rethink, so they don't bother.

Been following this debate with interest... I always find Greg's
opinions thought-provoking, though I don't always agree with them. This
snippet is an example. Greg, why do you have a problem with the fact
that OO (or Word, for that matter) is "good enough" for most people? If
it's not good enough for you, then I could understand that that would be
a problem... however, you have said you do use a better tool (which,
according to you, still isn't good enough, but that's not what we're
talking about)... So why would it matter to you that other people choose
to use OpenOffice?

What if the fact that they don't have to rethink is a real bonus for
them? What if the fact that it's the same as what they're used to means
that they don't need to think about their tools, and only about their
work? For many people, in fact, most non-tech people, the tools are
merely tools, and the less thinking they cause, the better (after all,
any thinking about tools is wasted thinking that they could have spent
on the real work). I'm not sure what you are trying to acheive by
objecting to their choice (apart from when it directly affects you by
making you use the same tool to read their format documents).
