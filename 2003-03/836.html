&gt; OpenOffice seems very stable to me, but I guess other's mileage does vary, as

I tried openoffice for a while around 1.0.0 time, it crashed
regularly for me, and I wasn't doing anything special (see
further on for my uses of word processors).

&gt; Its the same problem i mentioned before.  If OpenOffice lacked a feature that 
&gt; word has, you would say 'see? openoffice isnt as good because it doesnt do 
&gt; this'.

no I wouldn't, I doubt I'd notice.  I think you're assuming
I coming from some M$ office power-user perspective or something.

&gt; Now that OpenOffice has 90% of the functionality/features as word, 
&gt; all you can say is 'they just copied MS'.

well they did, you can't deny it.
It's a common thing these days in linux, to copy M$.

It goes back to the other thread on innovation.  Copying
something, even if you do it better, is not innovation, it's
evolution.  As I've said before, linux should be setting the
new standards for the future.  All these people focussing and
worrying about what M$ are doing are wasting their time.
The linux community should completely ignore M$.

&gt; I dont know of any features I need that aren't in MS Word or OpenOffice.  
&gt; There is therefore no reason whatsoever to do anything differently.
&gt; If you think it SHOULD be different to MS Office, please state HOW it should 
&gt; be different, rather than just criticizing.

I don't think a big "integrated" thing like open/M$ office is
the way to go.  I'd rather have seen the effort put into making
abiword and gnumeric better (and maybe doing a similar powerpoint
type thing although I've never used powerpoint and am of the
opinion that if you need to use it then it's cos either you're
a boring speaker or the content is boring - which is why I
guess it's so popular with sales type people).
 
&gt; &gt; Instead I use crossover office with M$ word and excel
&gt; 
&gt; Here is the flaw in your argument.  You first said that OpenOffice's problem 
&gt; is that its a copy of MS Office.  Now you are saying you would prefer MS 
&gt; Office - which would immediately indicate that OpenOffice isnt a good enough 
&gt; 'replacement'....ie. that it *isnt enough like MS Office*?

ah no.  firstly I wasn't presenting an argument, it's my opinion.
Obviously you like openoffice, so good luck to you.

Personally I don't like M$ office anymore than openoffice, my
favourite word processor is abiword.  I don't use any advanced
or tricky features in a word processor.  The problem is that
people use, and send me, word (and xls) docs.  Abiword displays
them most of the time and for most docs but often you need 
word/excel to view them properly or to make edits and send them
back.  It sucks but that's how it is.  That's why I use
crossover office and word/excel.

Dave.
