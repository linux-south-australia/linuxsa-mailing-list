&gt; &gt; &gt; i assume you're doing the port forward for mail...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Mail and ssh, yes (there's a similar one 2222 -&gt; 22)
&gt; 
&gt; ok i assume the server you can currently *can* access is vewable from
&gt; the internet on a real IP addr? and the one you want to send mail to
&gt; from is behind a NAT ... ?

yes, I ahve a real IP, and I need to send mail to a mailserver on a 10.
address, which is behind someone else's NAT gateway...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; i have used in the past stunnel under linux and bounce under freebsd
&gt; &gt; &gt; to forward a specific port for session based stuf like smtp, pop and
&gt; &gt; &gt; imap. setup an entry in (x)inetd to accept on localhost on a port of
&gt; &gt; &gt; your choice, connecting to  the remote server on a high port of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice, where (x)inetd runs another copy of stunnel or ...
&gt; &gt; &gt; which terminates the connection to the local service.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; never used stunnel -- can I do this behind NAT? Remember, the remote
&gt; &gt; machine is completely inacessible from the server, so everything must be
&gt; &gt; initiated remotely.
&gt; 
&gt; so effectively its a socket pull arrangement?

Yeah, I think so (if what you mean by socket pull is what I mean by it
:)

&gt; 
&gt; ok then how about SecNet. was developed by a buncha freebsd/debian
&gt; coders and is effectively a encrypted VPN over UDP tunnels using TunTap.
&gt; 
&gt; it works very well, uses ssh ident keys for handshaking, uses software
&gt; routing, so you can have multiple tunnels terminating on one machine,
&gt; using only one listening socket =) very handy for folks behind nasty
&gt; ADSL NAT implementations =) (ones that break packet TCP IPSec protocols)

hmm... I would do, but I have a feeling that this should work. I also
have a feeling that I may have found something -- 44% packet loss, and
up to 10 second ping times... :) Bear with me, and I'll investigeate
further :)
