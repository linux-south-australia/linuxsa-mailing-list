<H1>RH8.0 - POP3/outlook express problem.</H1>

Hi,

I have a mail server running RH8.0 with sendmail-8.12.5-7 and pop3 
server for clients to download mail.

A client, running Outlook express6, tried to loadload his mail, but 
stopped it while it was still downloading, by killing Outlook Express. 
After that, he tried to download the mail from the other computer, but 
the system kept on asking for his password.

The log of the mail server was saying "could not get the lock of the 
file", suggesting that it may have been locked by some one. On trying to 
    reopen the Outlook express6 on the first computer (where he 
partially had downloaded and killied the Outlook Express), it cannot be 
opened  ; an instance of outlook express was still there.

Only on restarting the first computer, he managed to download mail from 
the second one.

It is not the problem of sendmail, but between POP3 and Outlook Express.

Is it the problem of Outlook express? or POP3 server? or both? or the 
client's action of stopping it right in the middle? How pop3 handles 
situation like this?

Any suggestions, or pointers to relevant documents, are highly appreciated.

Damar
