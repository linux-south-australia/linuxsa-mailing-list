&gt;&gt; OK, but why "run off"?
&gt;
&gt; I don't know.  I assume it was for the same reason that people say,
&gt; "run off a copy on the printer"

I knew the term at the time that runoff (the predecessor of roff,
which ran un Multics) was written.  See
<A HREF="http://athena.fit.qut.edu.au/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+roff">http://athena.fit.qut.edu.au/cgi-bin/man/man2html?7+roff</A> for more
details.  I particularly like this part, misguided as it turned out to
be:

  BUGS

  UNIX[rg] is a registered trademark of the Open Group. But things
  have improved considerably after Caldera had bought SCO UNIX in
  2001.

I was running a small Gestetner offset lithography printer for my
mother, and we regularly referred to printing as "running off" a
number of sheets.

&gt;&gt; OK, ye people who are familiar with both *roff and [La]TeX, why did
&gt;&gt; Knuth write TeX if troff existed?
&gt;
&gt; Knuth was writing the definitive text to computing.  He wrote
&gt; volumes 1 and 2; and despairing of the poor quality of document
&gt; setting applications at the time, took a decade off to write TeX,
&gt; before writing volumes 3, 4 and 5.  I don't know why he didn't use
&gt; troff, but recalling the previous mini-discussion about TeX's
&gt; operating system of origin, particularly that it wasn't unix,
&gt; perhaps he didn't know of it or felt it was not conveniently
&gt; available to him.

I'd guess it wasn't available, or not convenient.  Besides, Knuth
wanted to do his own thing.  Sound like Linux? 

&gt; Seems a bit of a stretch, I'll grant you.  Maybe he just didn't like
&gt; troff's cryptic and arcane language and decided to write his own
&gt; cryptic and arcane typesetting language.  :-)

Maybe troff wasn't cryptic and arcane enough.

&gt;&gt; Are they pretty much equivalent?
&gt;
&gt; Yes, in the same sense that an Alfa and a VW are pretty much
&gt; equivalent.  Actually, the two motor cars are probably more
&gt; equivalent than the two typesetting systems.

Well, they both get the job done.
