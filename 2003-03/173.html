&gt; &gt;there are other solutions but OSPF s a stable solution now, ok so
&gt; &gt;its still in development, but you can roll it out and its mostly
&gt; &gt;stable, there are heavily loaded routers in LINX that run zebra!
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; OSPF can be a terrible solution for links that might have intermittent 
&gt; issues (such as the issues found with residential wireless links..). 
&gt; Because it has no sort of session, an OSPF route can appear ok even when 
&gt; the link is dropping 80% of packets and is otherwise unusable.

true, as a basis for parts of the netowrk OSPF will do fine..
there are better protocols for the adhoc-mesh[1] end of the network,
an example would be MobileMesh or AODV, but neither nicely integrate
into the existing OSPF implementations.
 
&gt; BGP is a nicer solution, as the underlying TCP protocol won't function 
&gt; over bad links, so they drop out properly during intermittent failure. 
&gt; Unfortunately the loop-detection properties of BGP make it unsuitable as 
&gt; an IGP (routes aren't propogated more than 1 hop within the same AS) and 
&gt; it requires manual configuration for every unique pair of nodes that can 
&gt; see each other.

a mix of OSPF and BGP has been implmented, im not sure how well,
but i'm sure that it would scale better than a lot of other setups...

mobilemesh has issues of scale. 30-40 nodes was tested in london
but i haven't seen any other useful stats. the nokia stuff will
up to 1000 nodes but they use lotsa cells in practice and keep the 
node count down... which is what we really want to do anyway

&gt; IGRP wouldn't be so bad, but it's Cisco proprietary..

hmmm

&gt; There are a few white papers and projects out there that define 
&gt; protocols better suited to a wireless mesh, it should be interesting to 
&gt; see which ones become commonplace. See also some of the recent articles 
&gt; on 'selfish routing' for other issues that may affect mesh networks.

"selfish routing" sounds ... interesting, i'll have to go nd parse some
of those articles to see if they are appropriate to what we want to do
=)

cheers,

Kim

[1] mesh in the mobile(or not) adhoc connecting client sense
    as opposed to the lattice/cyclic/organically structured sense
