&gt; Folks,
&gt;     Alot of people keep going on about how insecure WEP is on wireless
&gt;     
&gt; networks. However,  I think some people are missing the big picture. 
&gt; There is a lot of wireless networks around the world and in Adelaide. 
&gt; Many of these have wep on, many off. The reality is Wep is still a
&gt; good idea. Yes it's insecure, can be easily broken (although the
&gt; claims of 6 hours seem a little far fetched) but random Joe Bloggs
&gt; wireless cracker is much more likely to try and get into a network
&gt; without wep than one with wep.
&gt; 
&gt;  From my understanding, wep is still a good choice. Tools like the BSD
&gt; Airtools WepCrack and air snort, still take a large amount of data to 
&gt; crack keys without 21bit weak iv's. I just think all the hype about
&gt; how insecure wep is getting is out of hand. Rolling wep keys do a
&gt; great job of solving the problems. Sure there is still problems but
&gt; lets not instantly discount a security measure. If you want security
&gt; use IPSec, but don't discount a first line of defence.
&gt; 

There is also FakeAP for BSD and Linux which creates virtual
Wireless Access points. While I haven't installed it personally, it
sounds like it would help add another layer to defeat D-stumbler,
air-snort, and the like.
