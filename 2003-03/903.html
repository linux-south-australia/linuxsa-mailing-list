Hi James and all

That is downright disgusting. There are many _quality_ programs
available for Linux at little or no cost. Those who want games like
'third person shootemups' can either try wine or wait for Transgaming.
There are already some games ported to Linux ie Quake III Arena.

As the last person in James' email says there is already 2 layers of
protection -

1. Can't install Click 'n' Run without access to Lindows.com's Click 'n'
Run server and you don't have that without paying.

2. Click 'n' Run (CNR) has to approve installation of software making
sure the user has a valid license / membership to install the program.

What more protection do they need? As Lindows.com states they need a
phone home routine in each program that runs when the program is run.
Does everyone need Internet access?

This is bad.

Robyn
