Personally,
I'm up for a bit of trying out this IPv6 stuff.  I have to admit I've 
had a bit of a lack of success with Freenet6 (give a server 305 error 
and I'm not sure why - I allow the right kind of connectivity and have 
an account - what does it mean??)

&gt;&gt;These are just a few comments/queries on IPv6 for linux.
&gt;&gt;Seeing as it's Saturday night, why not...
&gt; 
&gt; Why not - the cricket was interesting up to about 1ish.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Sometimes some people on this list do mention the possibility
&gt;&gt;of using IPv6 on their linux box - particularly connecting
&gt;&gt;up to the 6bone or some such IPv6 backbone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I WANT TO DO THIS. Time is my enemy atm. Also fart assing about with
&gt; distros for lack of anything better to do. I also want to bring in the MS
&gt; based pc's into the picture too. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;What prompted my query is this little news item:
&gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID">http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID</A>=7400069
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; HAHA - They'll never give up trying to change the world Bill is No 1 again
&gt; in Forbes list 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;When I tried a couple of years ago to determine how to connect
&gt;&gt;up to the 6bone in Adelaide or some such network, I couldn't easily
&gt;&gt;work out how to do it.
&gt;&gt;I'd be interested to know if there are people using it in earnest.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I plan on doing this once I get off my ass and manage to enrol at uni as my
&gt; work will be on ipv6 and there will be a means for me to hook into 6bone.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;But it makes me think that IPv6 is not yet mainstream.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Wouldn't it be nice if our friendly local ISP offered a hook into 6bone via
&gt; our DSL connections? :D
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;Recently there was an announcement of this IPv6 version of Slashdot:
&gt;&gt;<A HREF="http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/">http://slashdot.org.sixxs.org/</A>
&gt; 
&gt; I also heard this and was informed you need ipv6 running to resolve to it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;I can't even get my DNS to translate this to anything sensible.
&gt;&gt;(It's a CNAME to some undefined domain name apparently.)
&gt;&gt;This seems to suggest that to get IPv6 going, there are many tasks
&gt;&gt;along the way:
&gt;&gt;1	Get IPv6 to go over my Internet connection.
&gt;&gt;2	Get IPv6 going in my DNS.
&gt;&gt;3	Get an IPv6 gateway to connect to with IPv6-inIPv4 encapsulation.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I guess 1 and 3 are alternatives.
&gt; 
&gt; I think 3 is more likely as that is going in a lot of places.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;But I can't even get IPv6 going from one end of my home office to the other.
&gt; 
&gt; at least you have it running.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be more than interested in any local developments people have done and
&gt; a lot of the nitty gritty stuff like distro used their war stories etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Has ipv6 @ home been covered in LinuxSA user meetings? Should it be?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; Evan
