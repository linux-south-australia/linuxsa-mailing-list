&gt; The pic of Tavee Pularmjit pedalling such a generator seems to show

&gt; to bring the wheel to a halt.)
&gt; 
&gt; Would it not be much better to unhook the chain from the rear sprocket
&gt; and hook it over a sprocket attached directly to the generator?

&gt; Power available: 100W more or less indefinitely, 700W sprint (ie.
&gt; roughly 1hp) (with me pedalling). So a laptop's OK, a desktop more
&gt; awkward and would definitely need a more efficient drive system.

Gday Pigeon,

 From your email address you may not be aware that "pedal wireless" was 
pioneered here in Australia in the 1930s as part of the Royal Flying 
Doctor Service which provided (and still does provide) medical services 
to isolated outback communities and properties.

Your suggestion regarding the sprocket drive is, of course, correct. 
You can see such a configuration in operation if you watch the original 
version of the Movie "A Town Like Alice" (the version starring Peter 
Finch, not the one starring Bryan Brown). Watch for the sequence when 
the policeman (Chips Rafferty) tries to get a message through by WT.

It would not surprise me if some judicious googling produces extensive 
references. As you will appreciate, pedal powered generators had to be 
totally maintainable by bush mechanics so they were/are remarkably easy 
to put together.
