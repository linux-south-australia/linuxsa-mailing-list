&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dont agree.  MS Word crashes quite a lot for me (well it used to -
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; havent used word xp but some friends of mine who know how to use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; word and not much else, say that word xp is no better in this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; department).
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've had more crashes with OpenOffice.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; yep openoffice sucks, it's a pity really but there you go.
&gt;&gt; I think the project goals/aims were all wrong from the
&gt;&gt; start anyway (with just copying M$), but again, there you go.
&gt;
&gt; OpenOffice looks/works like MS Office because that's what people are
&gt; used to.  If it was different, people would view it as 'hard to use'
&gt; and it would never have been as popular as what it is today.  

I think we're looking at things from different perspectives.
Innovation and copying are two different issues, and I personally
would rather see good tools coming out than copies of bad ones.

&gt; I didn't like StarOffice 5.2 for that reason....it was too different
&gt; from what i was used to and therefore was perceived to be 'harder to
&gt; use'.

This is certainly a very narrow view of things.  I can't see any
difference worth mentioning between StarOffice and OpenOffice.

&gt; I dont know of any features I need that aren't in MS Word or
&gt; OpenOffice.  There is therefore no reason whatsoever to do anything
&gt; differently.

Because *you* don't know of any others?

&gt; If you think it SHOULD be different to MS Office, please state HOW
&gt; it should be different, rather than just criticizing.

I don't have time for all of them, but here are a few:

1.  It ignores directory structures, just like Microsoft.  It doesn't
    seem to understand the concept of a cwd at all.  If I create a new
    document, it will always try to save it in my home directory.
2.  It doesn't have an editor.
3.  Its text formatting is extremely primitive.
4.  The user interface is slow and difficult to use.

I use OpenOffice for exactly one thing: compatibility with Microsoft.
You can tell when I'm using it from the cursing and swearing.  Even
something as simple as entering non-ISO characters, such as em-rules
or curved quotation marks used in normal printed text, is a pain.
Putting in a Greek sentence into an English text is possible, but it
takes about 30 seconds of mouse pushing for each character.

None of these are problems with the old-fashioned tools I have been
using since before OpenOffice (or StarOffice) was thought of.  I'm
just finishing the draft for a book
(<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cfreebsd/index.html">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cfreebsd/index.html</A>), which is done
entirely with standard UNIX commands.  I know for a fact that, had
Microsoft Word or OpenOffice been a condition for writing the book, I
would have dropped the project after a couple of weeks.

&gt; I personally wish the OpenOffice / StarOffice projects all the best
&gt; in future in offering a choice to consumers worldwide, and providing
&gt; some much-needed competition for MS.

I wish people would do some thinking about really innovative
alternatives.
