You said that it turned up:

---
configure: error: Library requirements (libgnome-2.0 &gt;= 2.0.0
libgnomeui-2.0 &gt;= 2.0.0) not met; consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable if your libraries are in a nonstandard prefix so
pkg-config can find them.

...I accidentally missed that you have libnome-2.0 and so forth
installed. I read lots of e-mails per day and you'd posted ALL of the
output of the configure script when the above that I've quoted was quite
enough to diagnose your problem.

It' telling you your problem and it is really quite simple.

 1. You're trying to COMPILE gtetrinet
 2. You don't have the DEVELOPMENT libraries
    - but you have correctly identified that you have the user libraries

The solution is to get the development libraries. In Debian they'd be:

 libgnome-dev

...and so forth.

An RPM could look like:

 gnome-devel-lotsofnumbers.rpm
 
...in which case <A HREF="http://rpmfind.net/">http://rpmfind.net/</A>

Therefore I'll stand corrected and rephrase what I said:

 "You haven't installed the gnome-2.0 development packages or libraries.
D'oh."

Now that I've actually identified your problem we can learn this:

 1. When a ./configure script whines like it did to you it's looking for
DEVELOPMENT packages 2. To fix it, install the development package
 3. The development package is often not the same as the user library
package

Go fix, go conquer!
