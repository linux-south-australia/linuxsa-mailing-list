&gt; Had a very pleasant win with Wine last night. 

That's good news! :-)


&gt;
&gt; Studying Mech. Engineering @ TAFE and one of my current subjects is 
&gt; Finite Element Analysis.
&gt; TAFE supplied me with a demo version of Strand7 
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.strand.aust.com/strand7/">http://www.strand.aust.com/strand7/</A>
&gt; which we are supposed to install at home to increase our familiarity.
&gt; Got home and thought "well, I'll try it with Wine first 'coz I don't 
&gt; really want to re-boot into Window$"
&gt; ... and guess what.... it installed and ran beautifully.
&gt; It's a touch slower than running under native windows but very 
&gt; useable, the highlight was the stability, it's a bit flakey while 
&gt; running under win98 with the odd lockup and wierd errors popping up 
&gt; occasionally requiring a restart, but under wine it seems (fingers 
&gt; crossed) rock solid. 

I forwarded this to a friend of mine that works at an engineering firm.  

I showed him Calculix, (<A HREF="http://www.calculix.de">http://www.calculix.de</A>)but he said he would 
rather use ANSYS (<A HREF="http://www.ansys.com">http://www.ansys.com</A>) which runs in Windows and Unix.

It is a Windows house, Windows NT server, workstations.

There are a few other engineering apps they would need equivalancy for, 
but we didn't get into that. Anyway, its a step in the right direction.

&gt;
&gt; So there is some excellent news for aspiring engineers who love the 
&gt; penguin.
&gt;
&gt; "Wine.... a better Window$ than Window$"
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
