<H1>Internet Cleaning Day</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
 As many of you know, each year the Internet must be shut
 down for 24 hours in order to allow us to clean it. The
 cleaning process, which eliminates dead email and inactive
 ftp, www and gopher sites, allows for a better working and
 faster Internet.

 This year, the cleaning process will take place from 12:01 a.m.
 GMT on April 1st until 12:01 a.m, GMT on April 2nd.
 During that 24-hour period, five powerful Internet search
 engines situated around the world will search the Internet
 and delete any data that they find.

 In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask
 that you do the following:

 1. Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from
 their Internet connections.

 2. Shut down all Internet servers, or disconnect them from
 the Internet.

 3. Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any connections
 to the Internet.

 4. Refrain from connecting any computer to the Internet in
 any way.

 We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some
 Internet users, and we apologize. However, we are certain
 that any inconveniences will be more than made up for by the
 increased speed and efficiency of the Internet, once it has
 been cleared of electronic flotsam and jetsam.

 We thank you for your cooperation.

 Interconnected Network Maintenance staff,
 Main branch,
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Please notify your friends relatives and business associates on this 
event so they too will be prepared.
