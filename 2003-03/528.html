FreeBSD, i'm on your side :-)

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; wouldn't you be able to prefer to support such things?  You may choose
&gt;  &gt; not to run flash, but what about when you can't?
&gt; 
&gt; It's not like your
&gt; life will be any less enriched because you're not visiting 
&gt; www.obnoxiousflash.com anymore, is it?

It's just the point I was making :)

&gt;  &gt; Not necessarily the front end of a big corporate website -- I'm
&gt;  &gt; talking about all the crud that fills the Internet ;P
&gt; 
&gt; Which nicely backs up my point.  Do you feel like your quality of life
&gt; is diminished because you haven't looked at that crud?

Totally :)  I have to boot into Windows to play InkLink! (LOL)

&gt;  &gt; On a similar note:
&gt;  &gt; I went to the BankSA website and I had no java-vm.  Mozilla led me to a
&gt;  &gt; page which would let me install it, but of course without my root
&gt;  &gt; privileges, I wasn't able to.  Is the next course of action to load mozilla
&gt;  &gt; with root privileges whilst running X?
&gt; 
&gt; No, the next action is to read the mozilla docs, where it talks at length
&gt; about how to handle the situation you've described.

That is a fair comment.  It is documented.  But I mean reaaaaally would you
rather:

a)  Be paying their bills online because your application is intuitive and
    has the ability to perform its functions with the least amount of user
    interactivity

b)  Be reading about how to organize your bookmarks and install plugins
    because your web browser can't do it without the user catching up on
    all the documentation

c)  be playing Solitaire because Linux is for nerds.

&gt;  &gt; Why wouldn't the authors of Mozilla write their plugin installations in
&gt;  &gt; such a way that accommodates Unix users
&gt; 
&gt; They did. :-)

I knew that by making myself look naive on the list I'd be aiding others in
looking at the right area for the solution to a problem :-)
