Hi John

We were all newbies once, and me only a few years ago. On Friday nights
we meet at David's house a do Linux stuff, drink some of his beer etc.
Contact him on <A HREF="mailto:dlloyd@microbits.com.au">dlloyd@microbits.com.au</A> , if you don't have transport
tell him to call me and we'll see what we can organise.

We'll have a copy of Mandrake 9.0 if you want it, 3 install CD's, normal
CSDN prices $2.00 each. (Community Software Distribution Network)

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; This John here.  I am very new to linux and need some help with the installation of packages. Last night the install in expert mode went well till I got up to the select which CD's you have prompt (I have 8.2 Power Pack so I have all 7 CD's) I selected the minimum first 4 disks and then went next but the packages did not show on the next window and then when I chose select individual packages the system slowed down and then reported an error .. something like can't find basesys or something like that. I am normally very good with these sorts of things and write them down but it was like 1:30am this morning:-).
&gt; 
&gt; So I am wondering what I am doing wrong and why the install is falling over at this point?
&gt; 
&gt; Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers
&gt; 
&gt; John the linux newbie
