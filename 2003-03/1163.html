Matthew,

We are not rebooting a switch each night.

So far I have checked all configurations of samba (that I am aware of) and
replaced the network cable.

What is left to replace is the network card (which is a pain sometimes on a
Linux box) and something I'd rather not do at the moment because that Linux
box has the latest most important company wizbang application being
developed on it.  One which is virtually reliant on samba working properly.

I really was hoping to find out it was something software related.

Regards,
Desiree de Fluiter
