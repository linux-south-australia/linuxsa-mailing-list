David,

&gt; remote access.  I'll grant you it's more of an academic issue at the 
&gt; moment, but I think it's worthy to gain some level of understanding
&gt; and experience before the time comes where we're forced to use it.

I agree; I do actually know a little more than one may think...and I've
thought about tinkering with it myself. But I have a finite amount of
time and, as Alan has correctly pointed out, it will probably take a
tonne of reading and mucking about to get going.

&gt; Nobody suggested it was broken.

I was suggesting to Alan that it might get broken if he tries to use
it...

&gt; However, more people using IPv6 means 
&gt; more people testing the technology which hopefully means less
&gt; technical fsckups in the implementation.

Perhaps. But that's not an answer to Alan's original question either.
