Hi.

Hmm.. You don't need a digital phone to send an sms. For Telstra there is
a gateway you can dial with a modem to send an sms to a telstra mobile.
Works with HylaFax's 'sendpage' (and probably other systems I don't know
about - try searching on freshmeat)

&gt; Hi all...
&gt; 
&gt; This almost deserves an [OT], but I decided it doesn't...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm just wondering what people think is the best way of providing
&gt; remote monitoring of networked services... I'm planning to use
&gt; Netsaint on a central machine, and have it SMS relevant people (ie me)
&gt; when something bad happens... So I'm wondering if there are any
&gt; particularly cheap ways of getting SMS services... Of course, I could
&gt; use any one of a number of email-SMS gateways, but I'd rather not,
&gt; because then I wouldn't know about a network outage until it was
&gt; fixed, and that really defeats the point...
&gt; 
&gt; So, the core of the question: What's the cheapest way to get access to
&gt; a mobile network for SMS only? This would require a cheap phone
&gt; (perhaps second hand, but preferably new, to get warantees etc), or
&gt; some other (?) device, as well as a plan of some description (or a "no
&gt; plan"...) ...
&gt; 
&gt; As an extension of that idea, if you wanted to monitor many remote
&gt; sites in this manner, you'd want a number of phones... However, given
&gt; that these phones would never be used to dial in to, they could share
&gt; the number and account (which could mean that you wouldn't need to
&gt; have more than one plan (or "no plan") ...)
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm.. there's a number of ways of extending this idea... (eg PCI GSM
&gt; cards, if they exist... some sort of programmable GMS SMS device, so
&gt; it could make an emergency SMS if the attached server died... perhaps
&gt; a GSM/POTS device even, in case the GSM service dies... this may be
&gt; taking it a bit far though...)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, maybe it would be more sensible to use POTS to dial up to a
&gt; central server and trigger an SMS from there... Hmm... I'd rather not
&gt; do that though...
&gt; 
&gt; Any comments?
