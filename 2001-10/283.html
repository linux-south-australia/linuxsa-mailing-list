Use ext2fs. Much better to implement a filesystem for which the source is
available than to use reverse-engineered xFATx, NTFS or whathaveyou. (I
know the xFATx implementations are pretty good as far as xFATx goes, which
is not very! So don't use it.) It also means you don't necessarily have to
have a separate transfer partition at all.

Explore2fs is a Win32 user-mode program written by John Newbiggen which
looks very like the Windows Explorer. GPL, Delphi source available,
drag-and-drop and other wonderful things supported.
<A HREF="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm.">http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/explore2fs.htm.</A> Works a little
faster than NTFS I think, certainly no slower even though it isn't a
installable filesystem, or kernel-mode as we would say.

You can buy an ext2 installable filesystem (IFS) quite cheaply from
<A HREF="http://www.partition-manager.com/n_ext2fs_main.htm.">http://www.partition-manager.com/n_ext2fs_main.htm.</A> The advantage to this
is that the drive appears as an extra drive letter under Windows and any
application can access it transparently. (For those interested in the
code, the German company selling it bought the rights to a formerly
source-available installable ext2fs filesystem for Windows from a Rumanian
developer. The original is no longer online, even in google's cache as far
as I have found.)

Using the IFS also means that you can boot Windows/NT from a minimal
FAT partition, store all your data on ext2fs, and have every byte on your
drive readable and writable with confidence from both OSs. Having a slow
and inefficient filesystem for booting and running executables from isn't
much of a problem. The exception is of course the NT paging file, which
should go on an NTFS partition. You can even make Linux and NT share a
swap partition by twiddling partition types and forcing a reinit each boot
but these days people usually have space to burn.
