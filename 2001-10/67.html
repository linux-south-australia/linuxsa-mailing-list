&gt; &gt; Hiya,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents. I've been hammering away at Samba for over 5 months now and
&gt; &gt; have experienced the same sort of problems that Nathan has experienced. The
&gt; &gt; best result I've got from it is that my machine appears in the local network
&gt; &gt; neighbourhood but I couldn't log into the machine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What version of Samba? If it is RH7.1, then it is probably Samba 2.0.7-xx.

Also, it's well worth reading up on how Windows-based networks actually
work, if you don't already know. Some of the MCSE study materials are
quite good at explaining (even if they are biased) and have loads of
pretty pictures. I've also got a paper I wrote at home somewhere that
explains NT domain stuff in Unix person's terms. Let me know if you want
me to look for it.

&gt; &gt; Even using SWAT offers no help, even though it looks much easier to use and
&gt; &gt; understand.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, that is because SWAT is a pretty-boy front end to the smb.conf 
&gt; file, and it does not offer any help with debugging problems.

Last I checked, it wasn't even good at that. You still needed to know how
the smb.conf stuff worked, it's just that you didn't need a text
editor. :-P

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;             My experience is with RedHat 7.1, Mandrake 8.0 and 8.1 on a
&gt; &gt; mixture of Windows 98SE, 2000, and XP machines.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The guest account setup is very important here. All my recent experience is with Samba 2.2.x and Win95 and Win2K, and it all works fine.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; However, if you want to send me a packet trace of when the problems are 
&gt; occurring, I can look at them and suggest solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; To take a packet trace that will be useful, do:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; tcpdump -i eth0 -s 1500 -w smb.cap
&gt; 
&gt; And then, after the problem has occurred on the PC, type ^C on the 
&gt; console where you are taking the trace, and send it to me.
&gt; 
&gt;
