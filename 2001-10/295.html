Hi Marcos,

It COULD be futile as most root kits install their own version of daemons 
that will not log so as to avoid detection.

What i would do is take a full transactional copy of the database ad move 
it to another computer running a separate instance of the database server.

Then maybe you can try to sanitise the database.

Do you understand what i mean?

What type of database server are you running, MySQL, Oracle etc.....

Also another problem is now how do you guarantee the integrity of your data 
on the database. Your managers (?) should be made aware of that. I mean if 
i was a customer and you did not try to keep hackers from getting my 
personal details...... the possible outcomes are not pleasant.

Cheers

&gt;Hi All,
&gt;
&gt;One of our RH6.2 boxes seems to be infected with the adore worm. As a
&gt;result, none of the system logs have been logging since the beginning of
&gt;June. I'm aware that the worm doesn't do this, but someone has/is tampering
&gt;with the system services.
&gt;I'm hesitant to do a full reinstall as the box houses a database that I've
&gt;been told I can't take offline for a long period of time. Would it be of any
&gt;advantage to 'get the logging going again' to be able to assess the damage
&gt;done to the system?
&gt;
&gt;any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;tia,
&gt;marcos.
