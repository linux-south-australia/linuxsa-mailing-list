Have you checked that the cable run doesnt go too close to anything that
could interfear? Particularly fluro lights? Ive seen stuff similar with
ethernet through the roof that passes the fluros - it could be
enviromental.

&gt; Hi gang,
&gt; I'm seeing a strange problem with two machines and was hoping someone
&gt; might be able to suggest a way to fix it or an explanation!
&gt; 
&gt; There are two Linux machines on the same segment, connected by
&gt; approximately fifteen metres of ethernet cable. There is about 100KB/s
&gt; of traffic flowing between them at any given time.
&gt; 
&gt; Periodically, packet loss will start to occur and manifest itself as
&gt; reduced bandwidth, 50% packet loss and messages like this:
&gt; 
&gt; ping: sendto: Operation not permitted
&gt; ping: wrote x.x.x.x 64 chars, ret=-1
&gt; 64 bytes from x.x.x.x: icmp_seq=100 ttl=255 time=2.6ms
&gt; 
&gt; etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Taking the ethernet interface down and bringing it back up does not seem
&gt; to help, although rebooting the computer does fix it for anywhere
&gt; between ninety seconds and one hour. I haven't tried rebooting the
&gt; second machine, since it takes longer to reboot and doesn't belong to
&gt; us.
&gt; 
&gt; So far I've done the following:
&gt; 
&gt; - Replaced our router
&gt; - Tried an alternate ethernet cable
&gt; - Swapped the 3Com 3c90x cards with Intel EtherExpress Pro 100 cards
&gt; - Swapped the other machine with a completely different one
&gt; - Removed all ipchains firewall rules
&gt; - Removed all iproute2 traffic control from both computers
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes it goes away and comes back to haunt me after a little while.
&gt; Sometimes it'll lose 90% of pings, and other times it'll lose 5%.
&gt; 
&gt; The same basic setup has been used in a number of other places without
&gt; any trouble, although possibly with less traffic.
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone ever heard of anything like this happening before? :) Any
&gt; advice would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Joel
