All,

Yeah, trust me that man has some serious problem with hardware in his room.
In fact I think it's a heath hazard.

Ben, thanks a ton for the 4 x 4MB RAM, case, power supply, spare fast-UART
IO cards, the two ESS soundboards, the DX4-100, and AMD DX40 CPUs. The
router/firewall/web server is humming along nicely (well after I picked and
cleaned off your cat's hair off the boards). Hope you liked the beer!

Cheers,

Joseph Tan

Hi Everybody !!

Joseph Tans request for hardware has made me look at my bits cupboard. Well
I have decided that it is too full !!
Do I have decided to give most of it away, though there are a few things
that I think are still worth something, so make an offer on them if you are
interested. Most of the gear is ISA or EISA.

I have a handfull of motherboards with cpu:
486 DX-33, takes 72pin sims(give away)
486 DX2-66, takes 72 pin simms and 30 pin sims (give away)
486 DX20DPR50, takes 72 pin simms (give away)
486 DX-33, has got 8 30 pin simms on it (give away)
486 DX4-100, takes 72 pin simms with onboard IDE, PCI bus etc.. (make an
offer)

I also have a some 200 MB IDE hdd's.
A whole bunch of cards, including multi I/O, sound and network cards.
A bag full of ram, mostly 30 pin sims, but I think there mat be some odd 72
pin stuff.

I also have a couple of cases and power supplies. One is a flip-top case,
make an offer on that one.

Send us an email off the list and we can have a chat about what I have.

Cheers,

Ben.
