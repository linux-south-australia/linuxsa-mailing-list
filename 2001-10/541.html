Greg!

&gt; &gt; I'm not so certain about this, but I'm not as good at tweaking FreeBSD
&gt; &gt; as I am Linux. I think that Ian's managed to convince the powers that be
&gt; &gt; that Linux is good and he might have other reasons (read: political) for
&gt; &gt; not attempting to reconvince people about FreeBSD.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not trying to convert people here.  I was just making a
&gt; suggestion.  For interest's sake, it might be worth trying anyway.

I didn't think you were.

&gt; As for getting permission: consider a report to the Powers That Be:
&gt; "Which version of Linux?  Well, we started with Red Hat, but we had
&gt; difficulties.  Then we tried Debian, but we didn't like that much.
&gt; Finally we tried FreeBSD, and we found that it was pretty good". :-)

That's true and it's useful actually learning FreeBSD; I've found that
my Linux helps my FreeBSD fiddling and vice versa.

&gt; &gt; [side note: I think the FreeBSD VM is optimised for at least 2 times
&gt; &gt; physical memory].
&gt; 
&gt; No, that's not correct.

Hmm...I'm sure I saw that somewhere.

&gt; Sure, but again, you need details.

Optimising and benchmarking (i.e. working out what your optimisations
have done) are rather difficult to pin down precisely. The best detail
that I can give is that a stock kernel packaged by SGI (I use XFS which
is packaged by SGI) will run noticeably slower than a kernel I have
rebuilt myself.

And that the RedHat Packaged kernels can seem even slower.

But that's just my experience :-) Personally, I think optimising things
is a "try this, try that" and see if it works type of thing.
