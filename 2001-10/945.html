 &gt; Likewise, the Apache licence is based on the BSD isnt it...? I see this a

And the problem with that would be ... ?

 &gt; Under the BSD licence i see a piece of software, originally based on
 &gt; a program available with Source under the BSD licence.
 &gt; SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd takes advantage of this, closes the
 &gt; source and changes the licence, it is no longer free. I see this
 &gt; as unacceptable. That code is lost forever.

How does that happen?  The original BSD-licensed code is still out there,
so you still have access to the code.  The only code you don't have access
to is that code which you never had in the first place, namely the
modifications carried out by SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd.

Which code, precisely, is "lost forever"?  And which previously free
code is "no longer free"?

Is there some special reason why SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd should
lose the freedom to choose whatever license they wish for the extra 
code which they have written?  Why should they be forced to use the 
same license as the code they've derived their version from?  Aren't
you proposing that a developer who contributes to a pre-existing 
software project should have less rights than a developer who works in
isolation?  

 &gt; When I release some software under the GPL, I dont want someone coming
 &gt; along, taking my code, and closing the source.

They can't do that.  You're the copyright owner;  You can continue to 
distribute the source for your own software regardless of whatever anyone
else does.  I don't understand how you arrive at an outcome where the
source for a previously free project is suddenly closed simply because a 
commercial software developer picks it up.
