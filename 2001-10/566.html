Hiya Everyone,

When I started out with Linux late 2000, I was after an OS that could offer
(in no particular order):

1. The most cutting edge technology.
2. A very transparent development process.
3. A good and established community.
4. Excellent reliability.
5. Excellent performance.
6. An establishment of solid applications (games, officesuites, internet
applications).

In particular, I was interested in getting into a non-Windows OS that could
offer everything and do everything that Windows 2000 could for me. This
means a top calibre graphical web browser, office suite, DVD playback
software, etc..

OK, its been a year now. I've tried RedHat, Mandrake, Debian, and Suse. Of
the lot, Mandrake has been my winner, and it has certainly offered (1), (2),
and (3). Reliability has generally been good for the OS, but uptime and work
interruptions have been considerable due to Mozilla, StarOffice, and
AbiWord's incompleteness.

I like that fact that I can roll up my own kernels and view the source code
of most of my applications. Picking up some UNIX knowledge has been good
too. The fact that GPL software cost much less than the regular stuff which
you'd find at a software store is another big plus.

Performance has been a bit of disappointment since I'm talking about loading
of applications, gaming 3D, and desktop-oriented stuff. Under KDE 2.2.1
performance is pretty good, but there is a noticeable sluggish nature in
handling GUI applications compared to Windows 2000.

As for gaming performance such as Quake 3, even Nvidia don't seem to put the
same resources into releasing their optimised drivers for the GeForce line.
When are we going to get the equivalent Detonator XPs?

DVD playback has been a bit of challenge. The best available now is Xine
0.9.2 with it's various DVD and decryption plugins. It works with Divx
movies too, and generally it works - but it's not in the same league as
WinDVD/PowerDVD.

What I am waiting for is Mozilla 1.0, Evolution 1.0, and Star Office 6 final
and whatever games Loki can manage to port to Linux. Throw in KDE 3.0+ with
another round of improvements , and then the desktop usability for Linux for
me will improve another notch.

So how about the rest of you? I know many of you use Linux is a business and
development tool, anybody uses it for seriously having fun?

Cheers,
Joseph Tan
