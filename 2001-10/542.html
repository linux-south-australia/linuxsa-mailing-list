Hi Ant,

Thanks for the reply and so much good information.

I neglected to say in my post that the configuration was for a stand-
alone desktop to be used in a home situation. In many cases the 
recipient of the computers would be an individual child currently under 
Guardianship or Ward of the State. No network is envisioned nor would 
we be considering building in any development options. In many cases 
they would not get a printer and may not even get a CD Drive unless 
they purchase them themselves.

Though no modem is to be provided we would have to include Internet 
connectivity as an option.

The reason for StarOffice as against a combo of Abiword - Gnumeric etc 
is for simple training and interoperability reasons. I know that 
StarOffice is a resources hog. Hopefully that will be under control 
with StarOffice 6 now that they have dropped the desktop and other 
integrated functions. Any suggestions on tweaking that would be also 
appreciated.

I do appreciate the help from the LinuxSA members to get this project 
rolling.

Cheers, Ian
