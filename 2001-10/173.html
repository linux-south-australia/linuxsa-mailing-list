&gt; &gt; DevFS is cool.. its the "new" way to handle /dev/ entries.

&gt; &gt; One, will be via a specific /dev/ls120-specific-name and the other would
&gt; &gt; probably be via a /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/ kind of location.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm yet to use DevFS, but from your explanation, it seems like an
&gt; awefully long winded way of accessing a device.

Long-winded is good.  To see why, conduct the following
thought experiment.  Put two drives into a system, then
attempt to explain to someone which drive will be /dev/hda
and which drive will be /dev/hdb.  Now boot and see what
actually happens.

&gt; The idea is good, but I think they've gone a little too far. I'd have
&gt; thought that there are too many levels to get to the IDE device.

The drive is accessed via a 32-bit number, so the length
of the name only matters during the mount command.  As
the mount command has to do synchronous physical I/O
the length of the device name isn't going to have any
noticable effect upon performance.

BTW, you can also mount partitions based upon
their label or SSID.  For fixed disks on IDE, SCSI, FC
and USB this is almost always preferable to using the
drive's device name.  So the device name is becoming a
tad redundant for fixed disks anyway.

Example:
  e2label /dev/hdc5 bigtmp
Edit /etc/fstab adding
  LABEL=bigtmp /var/tmp ext2 defaults 0 2
Now say
  mount /var/tmp

You can do the same for SSID.  The essential difference
being that a backup of bigtmp to another partition
has the same label but a different SSID.
