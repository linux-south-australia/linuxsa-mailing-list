I'm not sure what you mean by "task swapping".  On a uni-processor
only one task is ever executed at one time, and multi-tasking is always
simulated by swapping from one task to another.  When a task swap occurs
you need to save the current processor context: all registers, processor
privilege and so on.  IA32 provides task entries in descriptor tables to
make context switching easy, but there is nothing, repeat nothing, about
even the 8086 that makes it unsuitable for pre-emptive multi-tasking.

Perhaps you meant "page swapping", which has little to do with multi-
tasking and much to do with virtual memory.  IA32 also includes page
tables which are used to translate a virtual address into an actual
physical address.  Even without this ability you still can multi-task.
Unix like operating systems run fine on hardware with no virtual
addressing capability.  At load time each task is mapped (relocated)
to a target location in physical memory, and when a task needs to be
loaded but memory is full, some other task is swapped out to backing
store in it's entirety.

Unix like operating systems that ran on CPUs with no virtual memory
facility include Xenix, Idris, and Unix up to System V.

It's interesting to note that the Unix started life on a PDP-7, at
which time it was called UNICS.  (Nobody recalls whose idea the
change to UNIX was[2].)


&gt; The 386 was the last major advance in chip design in the x86 series,
&gt; everything else has been speed related, or switching to emulation in
&gt; RISC, or adding extra instruction sets.

Well that's true if you think that none of deep pipelining, switching
from a CISC to RISC core, and implementing SIMD co-processors, constitute
major advances in the x86 series.
