Hi Andrew et al,

Last night I installed Mandrake 8.1 and things went smoothly. It found 
all the components and set it self up without a problem.

Then today when I was trying to install StarOffice of the Sun CD I spat 
the dummy.

I signed on as root, went into the CD to the Setup file. Told it to run 
the setup files and it spat back, "permission denied."  Huh?

So I tried again with other setups, "Permission denied."

I rang Mike (thanks mate) and he suggested copying the files into /tmp 
which I did. Install proceded without a hitch.

I am still a newbie at some of this stuff so can somebody drop in a 
clue why it was denying me rights to run files?

Oh, and it loaded up a stack of partitions (5) without warning me. 
Really odd behaviour but I did tell it I wasn't an expert so I guess 
that is the default behaviour. I will know next time to tell it expert 
mode so I have some control in how it sets up.

Cheers, Ian

&gt; &gt; I've been reading the Mandrake Forum regarding Mandrake 8.1 and most
&gt; &gt; people are not happy with it?
&gt; &gt; My own impression is similiar, i have 2 reasonably new computers and
&gt; &gt; ran Mandrake 8 on the main one and Suse 7.1 on the other. Everything
&gt; &gt; was great and internet connection sharing worked well. I decided to
&gt; &gt; install 8.1 on both computers because i was so impressed with 8.0.
&gt; &gt; The install on my main computer was a disaster and i quickly 
&gt; went back
&gt; &gt; to Mandrake 8 which is the best distro around, but amazingly 
&gt; Mandrake&gt; 8.1 installed on my second computer with ease but after 
&gt; using it i
&gt; &gt; still think Mandrake 8  is much more stable and won't bother 
&gt; upgrading&gt; until something better than Mandrake 8  comes out.
&gt; 
&gt; I start to get worried when a distribution becomes "unstable". 
&gt; It's a
&gt; bit of an ambiguous term really. It could mean that the kernel they've
&gt; used is crap, or perhaps it's the software they've included.
&gt; 
&gt; It's astonishingly bad (IMO) when a distribution is producing
&gt; instability. Perhaps it's just your experience.
&gt; 
&gt; Then again, it'd not surprise me. Linux distributions these days 
&gt; (bar a
&gt; few) are driven so much by the commercial marketing world that they're
&gt; forgetting about producing decent software. RedHat's an example.
