&gt; &gt; I have started compiling a list of bugs that I have found in mandrake

&gt; 
&gt; Most of the problems (but not the one about partitioning) could be
&gt; described as "user configuration faults".  Linux is not for wimps.
&gt; Anyone who needs their hand held should be prepared to pay for it

You missed my point completely. Most probs were because I administed
things the old school way of editing the config files by hand, how I
always do it. My gripe is that mandrake 8.1 couldnt deal with it.

&gt; So does Mandrake suck?  I've not used it, but I've also not heard
&gt; anything to convince me that it does.

There are many releases of mandrake. I'd say 8.0 is still the best
distro around, but as for 8.1, well you can decide for youself. Weather
or not mandrake suck will depend on if they learn from 8.1 and if they
set things straight with 8.2.
