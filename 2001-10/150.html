Hi John, 

I also had trouble with Mandrake 8.1 using my LS-120 drive properly, but
I switched to RedHat 7.1 before I had time to look into it much further.

As a rule I never used the X icon mount because it didn't work.
Try mounting without the -t command as in 'mount /dev/hdb /mnt/floppy'
or mount -t vfat /dev/hdb /mnt/floppy

&gt; Here the trouble started - I could not mount the floppy drive.  I
&gt; tried to mount it via the icon on the desktop and with the mount
&gt; command from a terminal (mount -t auto /dev/hdb /mnt/floppy),
&gt; with the same message both times:
&gt;         Could not mount device.
&gt;         The reported error was:
&gt;         mount: special device /dev/hdb does not exist.


It might also be of interest to look at the IDE devices via the /proc
directory if the above doesn't work.

One other thing I noticed with Mandrake 8.1 and my LS-120 was that during 
the install process the boot floppy was not created properly.
The LS-120 drive was accessed for only about one second and then I was 
told the process had completed successfully, even though the boot disk was
unusable. Try booting from your boot disk (if you made one) and if it doesn't 
work, make one with the X tool. For some reason it worked properly when I used
this.
