Hiya,

I think half the trick to getting a successful compilation going is to
know exactly what drivers you need for the services that you are
planning to run (eg NetFilter, networking), and the hardware that you
have.

I've had good experiences with a stock 2.4.12 kernel on Mandrake 8.1
(after you fix up the parellel port bug). I'm trying out 2.4.12-ac3 with
the new preemptive patch.

It is very easy to break something and create a non-working kernel. Go
for a conservative setting then cut it down if you want.

What confuses me is why certain modules don't start automatically when
they should. For instance on my notebook, PCMCIA support will not start
unless I compile it in as a kernel not as a module.

To be honest the only reason whay I do kernel compiles is to try out the
latest and best patches (such as the preemptive kernel stuff) on my home
machine. Even if its compiled on a 686 machine I don't think there is a
significant improvement in perofrmance over the 586 kernel shipped with
Mandrake.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; Hi guys and girls,
&gt; 
&gt; The kernel was found no problem - did all the running
&gt; lilo and putting the image in /boot, etc.  After I ran
&gt; it once - it complained on boot that devfsd was not
&gt; installed - so I installed it.  Now I recieve the error
&gt; that /root can not be mounted on 16:06?  Blow me down
&gt; I am confused.
&gt; 
&gt; I will just install Mandrake 8.1 soon although I would
&gt; really like to learn how to configure a kernel properly
&gt; one day.  It is something that I really want to learn
&gt; how to do properly.  I just can't get far without it
&gt; as something always seems to need kernel source or this
&gt; or that.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I can not compile my kernel (2.4.10)!  Admitedly I don't really
&gt; &gt;&gt; know what I am doing although I felt that I need to
&gt; &gt;&gt; learn sooner or later.  I have fiddle around and either the screen
&gt; &gt;&gt; remains blank after booting (and the SCSI CD-
&gt; &gt;&gt; ROM is accessed as indicated by the lights) or I receive
&gt; &gt;&gt; a CRC error?
&gt; &gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt;As Deep Thought would say...."hhmmm, tricky".
&gt; &gt;Did you read /usr/src/linux/Documenatation? Did you make menuconfig,
&gt; &gt;make dep, make bzImage? Do you have the correct version of make and gcc
&gt; &gt;as documented in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes? Did you put your new
&gt; &gt;bzImage somewhere other than /boot (/shoe is a good choice, but /thong is
&gt; &gt;really only suitable for Oz)? Did you add your new kernel to /etc/lilo.conf
&gt; &gt;and run lilo?
&gt; &gt;A step by step guide to what you did would be cosmically useful, "have
&gt; &gt;fiddle around" is only really useful for tuning violins :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;(Sorry if this sounds sarcastic/flamish, it's not meant to be and I'd
&gt; &gt;like the help)
