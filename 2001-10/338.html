&gt; "The debate about whether people should switch away from Microsoft's
&gt; IIS misses the point. Suppose that tomorrow everyone that is knowingly
&gt; and intentionally running and using IIS turned it off. Would it
&gt; make any difference? As I understand it these malicious programs do
&gt; not exploit only copies of IIS that somebody is using, "running,"
&gt; managing, choosing, or otherwise saying grace over. They exploit all
&gt; instantiated copies of IIS.

I was aware that many of these worms use things such as outlook as well as
Internet Information Server, but how can IIS be exploited over the network
just by being installed? Seems a little odd to me.

Obviously if people read their mail using outlook on a server, they
deserve everything they get (yet there are still far too many people that 
I *know* do this on a regular basis).

Even the default behaviour of sharing every disk volume  out to everybody
(with 'Full Control' permissions) has been changed, so this can't be the
problem.

So if the machine is not running the software and the disk is not writable
over the network to people, I'm at a loss as to how IIS can still be
exploited.

Anyone got any ideas?

thx,
Matt
