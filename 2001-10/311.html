Hi There,
    Having had my system cracked a few months ago, the best
advice I can give you is - DON'T TRUST ANYTHING ON THE
SYSTEM! I would strongly recommend that if you think/know
you have been cracked, decouple your system from the net
immediately - especially if you believe the cracker may
still be operating. The only way to be absolutely sure that
you haven't missed anything in the cleanup is to totally
restore a known crack free backup or reinstall. If you have
critical data, back up the DATA, but kill the engine and
reinstall just in case. If it is critical data, then being
offline for a few hours or a day or two is a pain in the
bum, but to have a cracker steal or corrupt your data is a
disaster. Don't risk it. Here are a few basic steps to get
started.

1.    disconnect the cracked machine from the net.
2.    backup the critical DATA - forget the rest, it may
even be too late for your
       data.
3.    If you have another HDD, reinstall and restore backups
to this HDD and
       keep the cracked HDD for a possible Federal Police
Investigation.
4.    If you don't have a spare HDD, keep copies of all
logs, scripts etc -
       anything that may be of use in an Investigation then
format and reinstall.
5.    Notify the Federal Police. They may not do much, but
they need to learn
       somehow. Even if they just log you as a statistic, it
may help them catch
       these guys later.
6.    Notify your customers, they need to know that the data
may be corrupt,
       or they may have been cracked through you. They will
probably be pissed
       off - they will be more pissed off if they find out
later and you haven't told
       them.

The above steps are obviously not comprehensive, I am sure
you can think of a few other things. The Federal Police
thing is worth the hassle, don't laugh about it, they really
do have to learn somehow and even if they cannot help much
this time, if it happens again they may help alot next time.
Taking a critical machine off the net is a hassle, but a
reinstall including downloading security patches will only
take a few hours. Leaving your machine on and trying to fix
it on the run is asking for trouble and you never really
know if you got everything. Hope I haven't scared you too
much (or maybe I hope I have). The longer you leave it, the
potentially worse it could become.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Logging


&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; One of our RH6.2 boxes seems to be infected with the adore
worm. As a
&gt; result, none of the system logs have been logging since
the beginning of
&gt; June. I'm aware that the worm doesn't do this, but someone
has/is tampering
&gt; with the system services.
&gt; I'm hesitant to do a full reinstall as the box houses a
database that I've
&gt; been told I can't take offline for a long period of time.
Would it be of any
&gt; advantage to 'get the logging going again' to be able to
assess the damage
&gt; done to the system?
&gt;
&gt; any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; tia,
&gt; marcos.
