For nearly all users nearly all the time it doesn't matter. For a few
developers it does matter, and companies built around selling software or
software services. For people who like philosophical debates it does
matter. But if you are a user of *Linux or *BSD it does not matter a bit
to you, and you are most likely using large chunks of code under both
schemes.

As a non-scientific sample, sit back and notice the people on the linuxsa
who do not take a noisy part in this licensing thread as it develops even
though they are involved in software distribution and creation. Even to
them, in many cases it doesn't matter.

And as to accuracy - there has been at least one licensing-related error
in this thread already, and since there is upwards of 100 licenses
descended from 3 or 4 main types of license, there are plenty of errors
still to be made :-)

A detailed discussion of licensing covers BSD vs GPL, BSDx license vs BSDy
license, GPL vs GPL-like, hybrid vs whatever, and is pretty exhausting.
The kernel people who understand their licensing best are the BSD
developers, and last I checked they weren't even clear about the scope of
the BSD licenses which cover the bulk of xBSD. The Linux kernel developers
have a large unresolved question about the boundaries of code mingling
with kernel modules and the various shades of them you can get these days.

My opinion is that unless you are very clear that either

   1) the licensing issue materially affects you (because you are in the
      software business in some way), or

   2) you like to debate the higher philosophical matters behind these
      issues, as many do

most people are wasting their time trying to get to the bottom of
licensing.

If anyone can demonstrate to me (in private mail please, to spare the list
a big OT debate) that any Linux or any BSD does not have licensing
ambiguity in its core I will happily summarise to the list. I have been
asking lawyers involved in this area for years and still haven't got a
satisfactory answer.
