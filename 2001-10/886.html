&gt;I been reading some workarounds for a Win2K / RH Dual boot and 
&gt;these involve
&gt;creating a boot floppy with Lilo and then manually carrying out some dd
&gt;commands and editing of boot.ini file to let the Windows Boot 
&gt;manager boot
&gt;into Linux.

Depends on which one you install first.  Install Win2k (and XP I presume, 
tho I haven't tested XP yet) first, then Linux second.  Linux should 
recognize the Windows boot partition and put the entry in LILO for you.
If not, you can put in the entry manually after you've installed Linux.
This worked fine for me with Win2000 & Mandrake 8.0 & 8.1, haven't tried
it with RH7.2, but should be very little difference.
Generally its only when you install Windows after installing Linux that you 
have problems.

&gt;Question 1: I assume although I have never tried it that you 
&gt;can create a
&gt;Dos ( win98 ) based Boot CD Rom with the same files as the 
&gt;boot floppy for
&gt;Win98 has - Need this to be able to run fdisk /mbr and keep XP 
&gt;happy. 

If you use EasyCd (I'm not familiar with any other CD writing packages under
Windows), it has the option of creating a bootable CD.  You just need to
have
a boot disk handy for it to use.  I use a Windows 98 boot disk to create 
bootable cds with Ghost images for use when i don't have access to a
network.
This should get you out of trouble.

&gt;I think that XP will also install onto a FAT32 Partition 
&gt;instead of NTFS. If
&gt;this is the case can Lilo then recognise it and save me the 
&gt;trouble. Does
&gt;anyone know if XP has any strange and exotic boot loader requirements.

AFAIK its fairly similar to Win2000 in its bootloader requirements, again, 
I haven't had any 1st hand experience with it so I couldn't be sure.

&gt;I'm not planning on leaving the dual boot setup permanent. Just want to
&gt;check out some of the "features" of XP eval copy - The 
&gt;notebook only has 64
&gt;Meg RAM so XP will run like a real dog anyway

Let us know how you go, I'm hoping to get my hands on a copy of XP in the 
next couple of weeks, so would be interested to see how your mileage goes
with it in a dual boot environment.
