Hi,

This is quoted from SANS

Bill Murray's Short Essay on Microsoft's Role In Security

"The debate about whether people should switch away from Microsoft's
IIS misses the point. Suppose that tomorrow everyone that is knowingly
and intentionally running and using IIS turned it off. Would it
make any difference? As I understand it these malicious programs do
not exploit only copies of IIS that somebody is using, "running,"
managing, choosing, or otherwise saying grace over. They exploit all
instantiated copies of IIS. By shipping and installing by default
hundreds of thousands of copies of flawed software that nobody asked
for or wanted, Microsoft seriously weakened the network. That they make
a timely patch available to the initiated is nice but irrelevant. That
the cognescenti can run IIS safely is irrelevant. That it may or
may not be more difficult to run safely than other web servers is
irrelevant. Most of those running it did not intentionally decide
to run it and most of them do not even know that they are running it
until their neighbors start to complain.

In their desire to be loved, Microsoft made a very bad decision, one
that even they cannot easily remedy. They have opened Pandora's box. I
have been saying for years that it is reckless to make a decision to
run your code on someone else's machine without their permission,
that it is hubris to believe that you can do that safely. I admit
that I had virus writers, not Microsoft, in mind when I said it
but now it is clear that the power to make such a decision cannot
be trusted even to Microsoft. The more copies of that software one
intends to be installed, the more important it is that the code be
free of exploitable features, much less errors.

It seems to me that Microsoft has seriously, not to say permanently
polluted the network. Not only have they put their own customers at
risk, they have put at risk people who do not run so much as a line
of Microsoft code.

What am I missing? Dear God, I do so hope I have it wrong."
