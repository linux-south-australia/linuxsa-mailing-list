&gt; &gt; 1) You have a lot of legacy software that runs on Solaris.
&gt; &gt; 2) You have a need for some of Solaris' enterprise features, like
&gt; &gt; hot-swap CPUs etc or their disksuite..
&gt; &gt; 3) You know Solaris.
&gt; &gt; 4) Your clients run Solaris.
&gt; 
&gt; That's perfectly fine, but I was thinking more along the lines of "Why'd
&gt; you want to run it within VMWare?". Apart from "Because I can", I'd
&gt; prefer to put it on its own box.

I'm sure most people would...

However, you'd want to run it within VMWare for the same reasons as if
you wanted to run anything within VMWare...

- if you have need for more than one machine, but only have one
  physical machine available
- if you need to switch between Windows or Linux and Solaris
  regularly.
- if you are developing installation software for Solaris -- it's easy
  to maintain a copy of a clean VMWare install, which you can
  duplicate and install, and so on...
- etc...

&gt; &gt; &gt; new SunBlade I had for a couple of weeks from Sun. I think it's a horrid
&gt; &gt; &gt; OS. Perhaps I'm just a little too used to FreeBSD/Linux.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; No, it is a horrid OS... at least, the standard CDE (Committee
&gt; &gt; Designed Environment) interface is horrid. Also, it lacks many
&gt; &gt; features that we Linux/BSD users have become used to... it feels
&gt; &gt; like it's missing bits... However, it does have great support for some
&gt; &gt; of Sun's more serious hardware, as well as great software RAID, and
&gt; &gt; many many other features that don't yet exist, at least not in an
&gt; &gt; enterprise-ready sense, on Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; That's one thing that Sun really, *really* do well in. There hardware
&gt; rocks. I'd purchase one (a Sun workstation) if the FreeBSD SPARC port
&gt; ever gets to that stage.

Mmmm... but it's the combination of Sun Hardware and Sun Solaris'
support of that hardware (and the features that make the hardware
useful) that makes it worthwhile. Linux is some way off Solaris in
that regard, and I suspect the BSDs are also... They _may_ catch up
one day, but I suspect that would be a hard thing to do...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Of course, Solaris, like Linux, is at it's strongest as a server. Both
&gt; &gt; work as a Desktop, but in both cases, you need to get used to them.
&gt; &gt; You can't be used to "Unix", you need to be used to the nuances of the
&gt; &gt; individual OSes...
&gt; 
&gt; Hmm. That's where I thought Solaris was a bit wierd. Changing from Linux
&gt; to FreeBSD didn't cause many problems for me. Working with Solaris was
&gt; just plain wierd :-)

indeed... changing from Solaris to Linux is also weird, but less so,
as Linux seems to have a superset of of the basic toolset (more
advanced tools are lacking, but that's life...)

rr

PS for those interested, I've contacted some Sun people regarding the
possibility of getting some sort of club access to Solaris, and they
seem positive so far...
