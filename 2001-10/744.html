&gt; Hi Richard
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a need for us (ie LinuxSA) to make their own cd?

Well, I don't know about _need_, but it may be cool... Also, there's
nothing really specific to LinuxSA that requires a LinuxSA-specific
CD... However, a maintained CD would be a Good Thing, and if LinuxSA
(or individuals within LinuxSA) wanted to do that, it certainly
wouldn't be a bad thing. It would also be an opportunity for
sponsorship (the LinuxSA/XYZ Rescue CD, also sponsored by the letters
P, Q and R... and the number 7) ... Does anyone know of the state of
play here?

I've found <A HREF="http://lubbock.sourceforge.net/">http://lubbock.sourceforge.net/</A> and <A HREF="http://www.lnx-bbc.org/">http://www.lnx-bbc.org/</A>
... Anyone tried these?

&gt; 
&gt; Can a normal burner burn credit card size cd's?

Most can -- look inside, and if they have a groove for small CDs, they
can (probably) burn Credit Card CDs...

&gt; 
&gt; What do we need on the cd?

LinuxCare CD would be a good start, but updated with latest versions
of stuff, and add gpart and parted (just because they are what I
needed :)

PS If someone wanted to take this on as a project, I am sure that some
other people here would be willing to throw a few $ their way -- I
would gladly pay $100-odd for the LinuxCare CD, particularly if it had
a few additional tools on it... Of course, there's little point in
creating a second, separate project if one of the above-linked
projects is suitable as-is or with a little work...

&gt; &gt; Howdy all...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is a story of how Linux saved the day (well, some GPL tools, but,
&gt; &gt; just to impress RMS and friends, I'm calling them "Linux") ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It all started with a boot sector virus and a dual boot Win98/Solaris8
&gt; &gt; Toshiba laptop. Linux enters the story later...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In the process of getting rid of this virus, I overwrote the MBR
&gt; &gt; (fdisk /MBR -- yay!) so the machine couldn't boot Solaris any more. No
&gt; &gt; worries, thought I, I'll just boot from the install media, and then
&gt; &gt; tell it to boot Solaris from the Solaris partition on the hard drive.
&gt; &gt; From there, it's easy -- I've done it before.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; However, this didn't work, as Solaris' LILO-equivalent couldn't find a
&gt; &gt; Solaris partition on the HDD... Strange... I used WinDOS's fdisk to
&gt; &gt; look at the partition, and sure enough, where there was a 3.1G Windows
&gt; &gt; partition followed by a 3.0G Solaris partition, now stood a 6.1G
&gt; &gt; Windows partition. Further investigation found that the VFAT
&gt; &gt; filesystem was still only 3.1G, so the data that was in the Solaris
&gt; &gt; partition should still be there... Phew...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; So, I had all the data, and just had to re-partition it correctly so I
&gt; &gt; could see it all again... But how does one go about re-partitioning
&gt; &gt; a disk correctly without knowing what the original partitioning scheme
&gt; &gt; was? Google gave me the following link, which proved to be helpful:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.oz.net/~trav/linux/lost_partition.html">http://www.oz.net/~trav/linux/lost_partition.html</A>
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I suggest that y'all should take a read of the above link, and then
&gt; &gt; ensure that you have three things:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; * a decent means of booting your dead system (LinuxCare CD works a
&gt; &gt; treat, but is there anything better?)
&gt; &gt; * a copy (on floppy) of parted
&gt; &gt;         (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html</A>)
&gt; &gt; * a copy (on floppy) of gpart
&gt; &gt;         (<A HREF="http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/user/76201/gpart/">http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/user/76201/gpart/</A>)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can particularly recommend gpart -- it's used for guessing partition
&gt; &gt; labels. I don't know how it would work in a different situation, but
&gt; &gt; it was a lifesaver for me.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For me, I used gpart to find what the partition sizes should probably
&gt; &gt; have been, then used parted to change them (rebooting multiple times
&gt; &gt; to use these tools -- it would be great if they were on the linuxcare
&gt; &gt; CD). So I recreated the Windows partition, tested that (and scandisked
&gt; &gt; it), and then set about finding the Solaris partition... Basically,
&gt; &gt; this consisted of recreating it as Linux swap, and then doing the
&gt; &gt; Solaris thing to restore the boot sector to its original state...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What would be great is if there was an up to date universal rescue CD
&gt; &gt; (that preferably fits in your wallet -- the LinuxCare one, I carry
&gt; &gt; with me everywhere), with these (and probably other) tools included...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hmm...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Anyway, moral of the story is that despite the lack of Linux on the
&gt; &gt; system in question, Linux and Linux-based tools still saved my bacon.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And, of course, if anyone out there has Solaris x86 problems, I'm your
&gt; &gt; man :)
