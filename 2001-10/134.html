My faithful desktop box at work runs an MSI VIA motherboard.
Relevant bits of output from lspci:
00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C691 [Apollo PRO] (rev c4)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C598 [Apollo MVP3 AGP]
00:07.0 ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super] (rev 22)
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev 10)
00:07.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B USB (rev 10)
00:07.4 SMBus: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo Super ACPI] (rev 30)
00:07.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686 [Apollo
Super AC97/Audio] (rev 20)


It all works fine.. I had some 'sound wierdness' as Ant would describe it
once, but that was around 2.4.0-testX, where X was around 8 to 10 or
something.. its worked fine from 2.4.0-release onwards, and I'm currently
running 2.4.10 on it. I don't think i've ever run a 2.2.x kernel on here, so
I can't tell you how they cope. I'd be very surprised if 2.2.19/20 didn't
run flawlessly though.


I actually think VIA has surpassed Intel in some aspects.. VIA is definately
not the 'poor man's choice' only any more.

However, both Intel and VIA chipsets still need a reliable board to work
from.. Don't buy a totally budget motherboard (with a good chipset) and
expect it to work as reliably as a non-totally-budget board with the same
chipset.

So, yeah, try an ABit, Tyan, MSI, Epox, AOpen, etc. motherboard.

Dodge the no-name brands, and a few others like PC Chips, which i wouldn't
touch with a 20 micron long pole.

&gt; What experiences have people had with running Linux on VIA chipset

&gt;
&gt; Searching the archives I get a feeling that VIA is not always a good
&gt; choice. It is a shame as most of the boards I see available in Adelaide
&gt; are VIA based.
&gt;
&gt; Is this correct? Are there any success stories?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you.
