Thanks to Dan (and others who replied off-list) for replying.

The Windows operating system I am currently using is Windows 98, so I 
don't think NTFS support is available.

My aim is to have a separate partition for this shared data, as I would 
like to be able to reinstall (and completely nuke) any operating system 
at any time without disturbing my music collection.  This is a similar 
philosophy to have a dedicated /home partition.
(I would be happy to share my /home partition between Windows and Linux 
if possible, but FAT filesystems don't seem to like certain Linux files 
such as dot files.)

I would very stongly desire seamless read-write access under both 
operating systems, meaning that the partition could be mounted under 
Linux, and that the partition would be assigned a drive letter under 
DOS/Windows.  I don't really want to pay for this.

If I could afford to, I'd set up a fileserver that performed NFS and/or 
SMB so I could see the files under both operating systems (but I 
can't!).


Yours
