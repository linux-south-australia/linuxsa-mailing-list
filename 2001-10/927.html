That's perfectly fine, but I was thinking more along the lines of "Why'd
you want to run it within VMWare?". Apart from "Because I can", I'd
prefer to put it on its own box.

&gt; &gt; new SunBlade I had for a couple of weeks from Sun. I think it's a horrid
&gt; &gt; OS. Perhaps I'm just a little too used to FreeBSD/Linux.
&gt; 
&gt; No, it is a horrid OS... at least, the standard CDE (Committee
&gt; Designed Environment) interface is horrid. Also, it lacks many
&gt; features that we Linux/BSD users have become used to... it feels
&gt; like it's missing bits... However, it does have great support for some
&gt; of Sun's more serious hardware, as well as great software RAID, and
&gt; many many other features that don't yet exist, at least not in an
&gt; enterprise-ready sense, on Linux.

That's one thing that Sun really, *really* do well in. There hardware
rocks. I'd purchase one (a Sun workstation) if the FreeBSD SPARC port
ever gets to that stage.

&gt; Of course, Solaris, like Linux, is at it's strongest as a server. Both
&gt; work as a Desktop, but in both cases, you need to get used to them.
&gt; You can't be used to "Unix", you need to be used to the nuances of the
&gt; individual OSes...

Hmm. That's where I thought Solaris was a bit wierd. Changing from Linux
to FreeBSD didn't cause many problems for me. Working with Solaris was
just plain wierd :-)

&gt; &gt; I think the most annoying thing I found was the apparent sluggishness of
&gt; &gt; the OS. It was even worse than RedHat Linux!
&gt; 
&gt; yeah, it's not the fastest thing around, but it scales well. Note that
&gt; it's always a compromise, and Sun has made the compromise in favour of
&gt; stability and scalability... however arguable the stability aspect
&gt; is...

:-)

&gt; It's a compromise -- you choose the best tool for the job, taking into
&gt; account more than just technical factors...

Agreed.
