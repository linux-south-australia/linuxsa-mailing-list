Hello all,

Thankyou for your responses.  I found the text installation option at =
install (sorry, hadn't noted the option previously) and have tried it =
twice.  For the record, I was instructed to type "text" at installation, =
to do a text installation. =20

The result: installation locked up and bombed out both times, each time =
very early in the installation (only managed 3 packages at the first =
attempt, before failing).  First attempt was to upgrade 6.1, second =
attempt was a fresh installation of 7.1.  So it looks like text =
installation may not be the go for me.

I then retried installation via the graphic interface.  It did the usual =
thing, this time getting about 120 packages loaded and then locked up.  =
I then tried the Alt+F1, Alt+F2, Alt+F3 & Alt+F4 key-pairs as suggested =
(perhaps I wasn't exactly clear on what to do here ?) and there was no =
response: the install remained locked up and I had to reboot. =20

Any further suggestions would be most welcome.

Cheers,

Andrew

PS.  Toby mentioned bad memory as a possible cause of problems.  The =
256M is a recent installation.  Nevertheless, I feel that memory may not =
be the issue because there were no problems installing eitherRedHat6.1 =
or Mandrake 7.1 using this memory.  Please feel free to correct me if =
this is an invalid assumption.
