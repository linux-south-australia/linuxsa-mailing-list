&gt; Does anyone know about the requirements/capabilities of hot swappable

&gt; 
&gt; I've heard that the IDE standard does support it but not all hardware
&gt; IDE controllers do.

Hotswap is primarily a function of the disk caddy, ensuring that the
electromechanical environment is such that the drive is not damaged
during removal and replacement.

Unfortunately most OS's only 'initialise' hard drives at boot, usually
relying on information transferred to them by the bios. If the drive
isn't present on boot then the OS won't automatically make the right
device entries for it etc.

The OS might also have to reset it's IDE internals to 'see' a replaced
drive, or at least recognise that an error has been fixed. This is
difficult since most OS's have a one-size-fits-all ATAPI/IDE driver that
tends to upset the applecart badly if restarted. Most systems also react
very badly if a disk stops working, even if it isn't an essential
mounted filesystem.

As seen on last week's episode, I use the 3ware IDE controllers in a
number of systems, which overcome most of the above problems by
abstracting the IDE interface from the OS. The OS sees a scsi drive(s)
which is actually made up of multiple IDE hard disks. Because the
firmware can re-initialise a drive without rebooting, new drives can be
added to an array on the fly. The firmware is accessed by OS-specific
software that has a web interface.

This doesn't help much if you want hot-swap for data portability (maybe
look at an external USB/IDE casing) but its a definate plus if 100%
uptime is your goal. Also, the 3ware cards are EOL'd as of last week, so
get one soon if you're interested :)
