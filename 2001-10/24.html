Hi Adam

I'm sorry but you not correct, the msi super 7 board I had installed in a
customers server, played up for over 9 month, until one day I was reading
the board manual and found it said that this board only supported pc66 and
pc100.

I tested this out by replacing the pc133 with a know working pc133 memory
chip, the problem still existed, then I put in any old pc100 chip and all
the problems when away, this was 3 month ago.

There are difference in the specifications between pc133 and pc100 and most
super 7 board will have a problem.

cheers
Mike

&gt; &gt; OK.  I have checked things out and it would seem the
&gt; &gt; shop gave me misleadinginformation.  I found the
&gt; &gt; mothboard's box and from that I found info on the web.
&gt; &gt;  Turns out the motherboard only supports PC100 and I
&gt; &gt; have been running PC133 in it.
&gt;
&gt; Using PC133 ram in a PC100 computer is perfectly OK. Its when you run PC66
&gt; ram in a PC100 computer when you have problems! The PC also will give you
&gt; some handy beeps (usually one long beep) in the POST test to say that your
&gt; ram is stuffed. I presume you havent had such a problem?
&gt; Some may beg to differ with me on this one, but i have been told many a
time
&gt; that it is okay to run PC133 ram in a PC100 PC.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Given that, what problems could I expect?  The machine
&gt; &gt; has been running (with the wrong memory) alright for
&gt; &gt; close on a year (24x7).  So if the memory was the
&gt; &gt; problem, would you expect it to show up now or
&gt; &gt; earlier?
&gt;
&gt; You wouldnt expect any problems from this. I do though, suggest a bios
&gt; update (if any), this can eradicate problems with most MB's.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Could this at all be related to the Code Red virus?
&gt; &gt; My server has been probed non stop for close on a
&gt; &gt; month by it before this problem showed up.  What I
&gt; &gt; have read to date suggests that it is not the cause,
&gt; &gt; but could the sustained attack have overloaded
&gt; &gt; something?
&gt;
&gt; No, this is highly unlikely, as the code red worm only attacks IIS
machines.
&gt; Unless however redhat has a problem with load bearing, which is also
highly
&gt; unlikely.
&gt;
