Hi All !

I set up a new machine for a friend and had it working nicely, logging on to the internet etc...
I took it to his house and plugged in his modem, but it wouldnt connect. Pppd was terminating with error 6 ("The serial port could not be locked."-from the man page). I could cominucate fine with his modem with minicom. I tried the other serial port and still no go. I also tried it without the modem attached, and it just hang (as expected). I also tried different init strings.
Well I chucked my modem back onto it, and it worked fine !!
He then went and bought a new modem (well actually it was for his mum, so he was just going to give her his, as it worked fine under windows). The new modem also comes back with error 6 !!!
One thing to note is that I used my serial cable with my modem, and am not sure what cable he used on the new modem.
I cant see anything in the logs (and I have told syslogd to log basicly every thing !!). Has anybody had this issue before ? Any ideas ?!

Cheers,

Ben.
