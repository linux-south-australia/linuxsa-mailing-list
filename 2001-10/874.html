&gt; Hi All,
&gt; 
&gt; I recently installed Red Hat 7.2, and I have a problem with mounting the 
&gt; CDROM - it won't mount!
&gt;

Well, being impatient, I hopped on to #redhat and asked this question, and 
received some most useful help.

By looking at /var/log/messages, I saw that errors were logged every time 
I tried to mount - loading the ide-cd.o kernel module would fail.  Using 
insmod with that driver would also fail.  To fix this, the following line 
needed to be put in /etc/modules.conf:

alias block-major-22 cdrom

It should have been added upon installation, as per 7.1, but evidently 
this didn't happen in the 7.2 install, so I'm filing a bug report now.

&gt; anyone have any suggestions as to how this problem can be fixed?  Finally, 
&gt; I am not very familiar with RH, and would like to know whether my user 
&gt; (tr) should be the owner of many of the entries in /dev (they seem to be 
&gt; associated with the fd, cdrom, framebuffer, sound, and video devices).
&gt; 

This question still stands.  It seems to me that this would cause problems 
if there were multiple users logged on to the system.

Cheerio,

Tim
