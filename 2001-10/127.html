I am running a via chipset at home, and it works well. IO is properly
supported, agp is properly supported, and sound mostly works.

I have also installed linux on several via chipset machines here at work
(redhat 6.2) although I have seen sound problems. 

At home I used to run mandrake 8.0 with kernel 2.4.8, and the sound
worked properly, then I upgraded to mandrake 8.1 also with kernel 2.4.8
and the sound is wierd. So from there I put a kernel.org 2.4.10 on it
and it still sounds wierd. However this wierdness only occurs with some
apps (xmms) and not others (xmovie, xine). So it is mostlikely a
mandrake 8.1 wierdness. 

I think you probably wouldnt get sound probs, but if you do someone here
should be able to help, and failing that sound cards are cheap anyway. 

I have seen many more machines with working via sound than without.

Cheers,
Ant

&gt; Searching the archives I get a feeling that VIA is not always a good
&gt; choice. It is a shame as most of the boards I see available in Adelaide
&gt; are VIA based.
&gt; 
&gt; Is this correct? Are there any success stories?

&gt; Thank you.
