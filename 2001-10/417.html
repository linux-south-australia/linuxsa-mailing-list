Hi There,

First, what do you mean by "syntax highlighting editor ". If
you mean one that points out you have forgotten brackets etc
(without wishing to start a "this editor is better than that
war") try emacs. Emacs has been around for a LONG time and
is not just an editor, but also an environment (in some ways
like a shell, but not exactly). I do know that there are
heaps of extensions for individual programming projects
including c, c++, java, lisp etc and it would be just a
matter of digging them out of the net. Emacs is also fully
customisable, so if you are not happy with it, them modify
it yourself (you will learn lisp in a hurry if you do).

Secondly, I haven't done much GUI programming, but Gtk seems
popular or TkTcl. If you are running Gnome or KDE, why not
just use whatever the default is on your system.

I am not interested in a project at the moment, but
certainly read some of the HOWTOs on the net, and there are
some very good Linux Programming books out there at the
moment for relatively not much money. Why not pick one up
and away you go. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Editors, Component Software and 3D engines


&gt; I am new to linux and are interested in dabbling in some
software
&gt; development. My aims are
&gt; A. Learn some new stuff for fun
&gt; B. Learn to do some object oriented component software
engineering
&gt; C. Learn C++
&gt; D. Learn to use a 3D graphics rendering engine
&gt; E. Teach the kids that they have the option to tell the
computer what
&gt; to do
&gt;
&gt; I have an amateur knowledge of C and Java as well as half
a dozen other
&gt; archaic notations.
&gt; My questions are
&gt;
&gt; 1. What syntax highlighting editor is your favourite for
software
&gt; development?
&gt; (should handle Java, C, C++, lisp, and Perl at least;
&gt; prolog would be nice too!!)
&gt; 2. What is a good component system for adding widgets and
gui's to
&gt; programs?
&gt; 3. Is any one else interested in this sort of project?
&gt;
&gt; I have relatively little time to spend on such projects,
however some
&gt; effort has produced a facile 2D game for the kids on the
iMac in Java,
&gt; using an open source 2D game engine which was fun.
&gt; regards
&gt; Greg (and Barbara)
