Hi all...

I have just installed a new 20Gb seagate IDE HDD into my linux box as hdc.
The HDD works fine (partitioned and formatted) except for the fact its
very very slow.
I also have a 4Gb Quantum in the box (about 3yrs old?) which is
hda. There are no other HDDs/cdrom drives in the PC.


As a quick test, i copied /proc/kcore to the seagate which i timed and i
worked out it was doing around 8Mb/s. The quantum in the same test did
around 12Mb/s.
I also tested the new seagate drive in my WinXP box (a sep pc, not dual
boot), where it flew and had no problems (benched at avg of 25Mb/s
across the whole drive). So obviously its a linux problem.

The Linux box is on an old Intel LX motherboard (PII), which as far as i
can see shouldnt be the problem. Im also running the 2.4.9 kernel.
Im using reiserfs on the new drive, but this also shouldnt be the problem
as hdparm also shows the quantum is faster (hdparm tests speed of drives
directly).
I have played around with hdparm settings, but this also hasnt helped.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,
 Mark Williams
