Have you tried FreeBSD?  Some people claim that it runs a whole lot
faster.  If you install the same packages, the end user won't know the
difference.

&gt;  Even with StarOffice 6 beta and OpenOffice 638C the
&gt;  machine seems to be slow.

I'd guess that your main issues are small memory size and possibly
incorrect disk parameters.  You really need DNA.

&gt;
&gt; Whilst it takes a long time, I usually prefer to do a custom install and
&gt; only install what's necessary. Most distributions have some pre-packaged
&gt; install types (eg, server, workstation, etc), but they all usually end up
&gt; installing 90% of the CD anyway....

I've found pretty much the opposite.  In any case, it's a 4 GB drive,
so that shouldn't be the issue.  The amount of stuff on the disk is
only marginally related to performance.

&gt;
&gt; 1) Make sure that there's at least 128Mb or swap

Why?

&gt; 2) Make sure that DMA is turned on for the hard-drives if you are able
&gt; to get it to work

Agreed.

&gt; (I was working with an 866MHZ PIII, IBM 70G drive without DMA [1] and it
&gt; was fantastically slow]

This really does make an enormous difference, especially if you're
swapping a lot.

&gt;&gt;  Even with StarOffice 6 beta and OpenOffice 638C the
&gt;&gt;  machine seems to be slow.
&gt;
&gt; If you are able to, dump KDE and/or GNOME.
&gt;
&gt; The desktops hog way too much memory; use something like fvwm. I know
&gt; this runs counter to "easy linux", however even with Linux's efficiency
&gt; being "user friendly" takes a huge amount of resources.

This is also correct.  Of course, you could also dump Star Office :-)
Ultimately, you still need to run the software you want.

&gt;&gt;  Has anybody got some ideas on tweaking the system to come up with
&gt;&gt;  significant speed improvements without resorting to RAM upgrades
&gt;&gt;  and other paths.
&gt;
&gt; Try rebuilding the kernel and throwing as much as you can out of it.

I'd be interested to see if that makes a significant difference.  You
might save a few 100 kB like that; how much difference will that make?
