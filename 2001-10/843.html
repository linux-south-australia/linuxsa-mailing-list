James,

CounterStrike runs excellently under Linux through WINE? Man, that is
something I GOT to try out. I can imagine the kind of head turning that
would cause at our weekly LANs.

I never got into the Sims, and the distro will cost US$69 (!) so its not
really warranted for me.

Yes Quake 3 and UT (both Linux native) run "excellent" and "good"
correspondingly. I hope Loki will bring out Civ 3.

See ya at the next Valhalla. This time I hope I don't get mugged.

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

&gt; &gt; If you think of any juicy questions that you would like me to throw at
&gt; &gt; Mandrake, yell out. The company recently announced a gamer's edition
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; Mandrake 8.1 (bundles with a WineX version of EA's The Sims). Got to
&gt; &gt; admit this not your usual GNU/Linux distro company.
&gt; 
&gt; Ahh, but you dont really need this distro. I run Debian Woody, and up
&gt; until earlier this week i was swtiching back to Wintendo to play
&gt; Counter-Strike. I installed WINE with OpenGL and now i play under Debian
&gt; Woody with WINE. Performance is excellent still...
&gt; 
&gt; Windows i was getting 100FPS Flat @ 1024x768. (eye cant see that many,
&gt; but hey..) Under Debian/WINE i get 70 - 90FPS @ 1024x768. It is
&gt; excellent, and i get to keep the stability of Debian. (Win2k i was
&gt; rebooting twice a day, it could not handle CS at all!... Debian hasn't
&gt; been rebooted since i installed wine days ago...)
&gt; 
&gt; Quake 3 is excellent under GNU/Linux as well.... (Although it is a
&gt; native version from Loki).
&gt; 
&gt; Some thing different for the next Valhalla!
&gt; 
&gt; All Horribly offtopic, i know but still interesting I think!
