This is pretty straightforward.

Yes, just find a plan that costs as little as possible, in terms of 
minimum monthly fee and cost per sms originated msg. I think we run 
ours on a plan that costs $10 per month and $0.15 per msg (with 
vodafone), there will be plenty of choices here.

We used to run a cobbled together phone-on-a-serial port. Ok, but not 
great, in reliability terms.

These days we use a purpose built device (GSM 'modem') - there are 
several vendors of same, they're not amazingly cheap (several hundred 
$) but they work so nicely that I'm very happy about them. They work 
using AT commands, just like a modem, with some additional AT 
commands for SMS message originate (and receive) handling.

They are just a power pack, a serial port (standard PC thingy) and an 
antenna jack (with a choice of 'internal' or 'external' grade 
antenna).

Lots of bits of software know how to drive them (including that gnu 
software thingy that knows how to drive mobiles, name escapes me 
right now). We wrote our own software in perl to drive it.

We also run these at our remote PoP's for dial-in access to our 
access server consoles. Absolutely wonderful - because it's out of 
band to the Telstra PSTN network, so if Telstra mess up big time, we 
can still dial in via the (non-Telstra!) mobile network we use and 
find out what gives. To do that, you just need a mobile plan that 
permits data dialup, and to ask your provider to enable it (they 
usually hand you a second mobile 'number' that this runs on, on the 
same SIM card). Same low cost plan, as you are dialling in from a 
land line so the phone still never places an outbound call. We have 
them all over the country :)

The one we run is an Siemens unit, called an M20:

Another popular one I'm aware of is the Falcom unit:

While NetSaint seems popular as something to do the actual monitoring 
with, at Internode we've been very happy with 'Mon' 
(<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/">http://www.kernel.org/software/mon/</A>), which is nice, extensible (and 
we have done so), and has all the bells and whistles we need here... 
have used it for some years now.

Cheers,

&gt;Hi all...
&gt;
&gt;This almost deserves an [OT], but I decided it doesn't...
&gt;
&gt;I'm just wondering what people think is the best way of providing
&gt;remote monitoring of networked services... I'm planning to use
&gt;Netsaint on a central machine, and have it SMS relevant people (ie me)
&gt;when something bad happens... So I'm wondering if there are any
&gt;particularly cheap ways of getting SMS services... Of course, I could
&gt;use any one of a number of email-SMS gateways, but I'd rather not,
&gt;because then I wouldn't know about a network outage until it was
&gt;fixed, and that really defeats the point...
&gt;
&gt;So, the core of the question: What's the cheapest way to get access to
&gt;a mobile network for SMS only? This would require a cheap phone
&gt;(perhaps second hand, but preferably new, to get warantees etc), or
&gt;some other (?) device, as well as a plan of some description (or a "no
&gt;plan"...) ...
&gt;
&gt;As an extension of that idea, if you wanted to monitor many remote
&gt;sites in this manner, you'd want a number of phones... However, given
&gt;that these phones would never be used to dial in to, they could share
&gt;the number and account (which could mean that you wouldn't need to
&gt;have more than one plan (or "no plan") ...)
&gt;
&gt;Hmm.. there's a number of ways of extending this idea... (eg PCI GSM
&gt;cards, if they exist... some sort of programmable GMS SMS device, so
&gt;it could make an emergency SMS if the attached server died... perhaps
&gt;a GSM/POTS device even, in case the GSM service dies... this may be
&gt;taking it a bit far though...)
&gt;
&gt;Also, maybe it would be more sensible to use POTS to dial up to a
&gt;central server and trigger an SMS from there... Hmm... I'd rather not
&gt;do that though...
&gt;
&gt;Any comments?
