I have some success to report. I loaded up netatalk from the rpmfind site
and it worked without any configuration. This allows the linux box to serve
AppleTalk, so I can now load files back and forth from the Mac quite
happily. This will allow us to leverage each computer for backups and save
a lot of sneaker rubber.

It still leaves me with the issue of getting ftp to work, however this has
been demoted to being an "intellectual" problem as opposed to a "practical"
one, and so it is less urgent.

For the record:
Suggestions/questions received include: (with my comments)
&gt; 1.	... you did not give enough information about version and ....
Red Hat 7.1, servers: wu-ftp 2.6.1-16, telnet-server 0.17-10
Mac OS8.6, clients: Fetch 3.0.3, NCSA telnet 2.6, TCP/IP MPS 2.0.1
&gt; 2.	 ... hosts.allow and hosts.deny in /etc...
both of these file are blank, except for some comments. According to the
man this should allow access from all hosts
&gt; 3.	The command 'netstat -l' or 'netstat -na'....
the port is active, "listening"
&gt; 4.	.... wu-ftpd xinetd service file has "disable = yes"....
It was originally set "disable = yes", however I changed that to = no and
that made no difference.
&gt; 5.	Linux box in any other way (telnet, ssh, http etc)....
I tried telnet, as I happen to have a telnet client for the Mac. Now that
AppleTalk is up, I'll try http. I'll have to get hold of Nifty teltnet and
have a go at ssh.
&gt; 6.	It is possibly that there is some DNS or other routing....
I have no DNS serving running. I'm working on the basis of first things
first!! Anyway - who needs names, I'll only forget them.....
&gt; 7.	..cannnot login remote via ftp or telnet as the root user.....
of course not!!
&gt; 8.	Just a tip from one newbie to another, get webmin www.webmin.com....
mmmm - my experience so far of gui versions of linux configuration commands
is that they are flaky, and I have to resort to the command line to learn
what is going on. Naturally I will have to follow this up.
&gt; 9.	Can I suggest netatalk ....
great idea!!

My feeling is that it is a problem with the Mac; I would have expected any
connection, even failed ones to be reported by xinetd into the syslog, but
it aint.

PS	My real name is Greg - I use my wife's email account and am too
lazy to change the "from" line. Besides it is a joint project as she is the
"primary" user of both machines.

best regards from both of us
