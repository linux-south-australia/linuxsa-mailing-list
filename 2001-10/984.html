&gt;I just meant to say that even tho i like linux, and hope it gets better
&gt;as far as a product goes, IE and Office on Win are miles ahead of
&gt;anything else (disregarding cost etc).

It's a little hard to disregard cost even in a small environment of 200
or so licensed users like us.
You're talking in excess of $100,000 just to have Office on those 200 PCs,
and that doesn't include Windows licenses or CALs either!

However, if you take the cost factor out of the equation, then you do
have a point, but IMHO I don't think you can separate cost from the overall
picture.


&gt;Office is so powerful, i take lecture notes on Office and couln't bear
&gt;to think of doing so under a linux based word processor - 

You spend $600 to have the privilege of Office processing your lecture
notes.
Pardon my sarcasm, but I'm ROFL at that thought.  Try Wordpad if you want a 
MS product to do the same job for free!
(I would imagine (hopefully) that you do more than take lecture notes with 
the sheer power of an industry leading wordprocessor such as Word)

&gt;Office is fast and its
&gt;features are far more numerous than any other suite (macros, spellcheck
&gt;styles, OLE etc).. - i used to teach Office and i use WinWord a great
&gt;deal.
&gt;i don't _like_ this fact, but it is true!

If you don't _like_ it, change it.
Have you tried the beta of Staroffice 6??  Even as beta software, it rocks
in comparison to Office, at a price that can't compare.


&gt;as far as cost-effective goes, i agree linux and koffice is cheaper!
&gt;but its still not as good :)

Koffice is but one of the many options for officeware under linux.
Personally I don't use it in preference for Staroffice (6 beta).

And yes, I DO use MS Office, as well as Staroffice, so I can't be 
accused of bashing something I don't use.  Yes, Office has some great
features, but its just _not_ worth the cost.
