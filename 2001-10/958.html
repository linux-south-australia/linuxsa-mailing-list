Andrew,

&gt; If that happened, the entire IIS-using world would know about it. The
&gt; Apache license has specific clauses in it that'd force Microsoft (or
&gt; any
&gt; other person/organisation) to ``...include the following
&gt; acknowledgment:
&gt; "This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
&gt; Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</A>).''

I stand corrected on one point, however, my original point of not having access 
to the code of those updates, still stands.

&gt; &gt; longer free. I see this as unacceptable. That code is lost forever.
&gt; 
&gt; Well, no. The code isn't "lost forever". The modifications made by
&gt; "SuperRichMegaSoftwre Pty Ltd" would be lost. In any case, if I was in
&gt; that situation, I'd be inclined to go and implement their changes into
&gt; my own, completely free code.

Excellent. Most of us would.

&gt; 
&gt; Don't forget, the BSD license contains a clause that requries you to
&gt; incorporate the copyright messages that you, the original author, put
&gt; into the code.

Yes. Good Point. Still no good in a proprietory program IMHO.

&gt; 
&gt; But the GPL prevents people from making money from it and closing the
&gt; code. That's a good thing some times, particuarly when you need to make
&gt; money to live :-)

Ahh, but it doesnt prevent you making money. RMS made money from selling Emacs 
on tape in the early days... (Why you would pay money for that crappy editor is 
beyond me... (Dons flame proof suit)) The GNU GPL does not prevent you making 
money. See RedHat etc...

Any way... its lunchtime.
