Hi Tim,

Thanks for posting that info. I had the exact same problem late Friday
afternoon and was about to ask the same question. What sort of cdrom drive
do you have? Generic ATAPI?

&gt; &gt; Hi All,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I recently installed Red Hat 7.2, and I have a problem with 
&gt; mounting the 
&gt; &gt; CDROM - it won't mount!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Well, being impatient, I hopped on to #redhat and asked this 
&gt; question, and 
&gt; received some most useful help.
&gt; 
&gt; By looking at /var/log/messages, I saw that errors were 
&gt; logged every time 
&gt; I tried to mount - loading the ide-cd.o kernel module would 
&gt; fail.  Using 
&gt; insmod with that driver would also fail.  To fix this, the 
&gt; following line 
&gt; needed to be put in /etc/modules.conf:
&gt; 
&gt; alias block-major-22 cdrom
&gt; 
&gt; It should have been added upon installation, as per 7.1, but 
&gt; evidently 
&gt; this didn't happen in the 7.2 install, so I'm filing a bug report now.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; anyone have any suggestions as to how this problem can be 
&gt; fixed?  Finally, 
&gt; &gt; I am not very familiar with RH, and would like to know 
&gt; whether my user 
&gt; &gt; (tr) should be the owner of many of the entries in /dev 
&gt; (they seem to be 
&gt; &gt; associated with the fd, cdrom, framebuffer, sound, and 
&gt; video devices).
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; This question still stands.  It seems to me that this would 
&gt; cause problems 
&gt; if there were multiple users logged on to the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheerio,
&gt; 
&gt; Tim
