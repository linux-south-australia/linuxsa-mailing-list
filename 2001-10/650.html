probably getting a bit OT, but...
if you have key staff relying on optus mobiles, you're asking
for trouble.  I love to promote competition to telstra but
for mobile phones, optus GSM coverage is just useless.  Even
vodafone is better.

For most people, it's not really a problem especially not if it's 
significantly cheaper but for small tradesmen or support or people  
who rely on their mobile to earn their income you're mad to use 
anything other than telstra GSM or CDMA (the only problem with CDMA 
being that you can't send/receive SMS to the other carriers).

Dave (PS. this isn't related to yesterday's optus outage - all
carriers will have the occasional outage)
