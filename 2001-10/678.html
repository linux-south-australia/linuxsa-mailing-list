&gt; You can send/receive inter-carrier SMS messages now on the CDMA network.

no only to other telstra people (GSM or CDMA) not to optus or voda
(unless it's changed very recently) - and the CDMA phone has to
support sms-sending (most don't).

&gt; However the stupid thing with CDMA is you need a different handset.

well yes it's not that stupid though

&gt; And 
&gt; there aren't many choices.

yes and most are crap looking (and with stupid features, eg. my
motorola one can't vibrate and ring at the same time, it's one
or the other or vibrate 3 times then start ringing)
 
&gt; &gt; Dave (PS. this isn't related to yesterday's optus outage - all
&gt; &gt; carriers will have the occasional outage)
&gt; 
&gt; Hehe, what you would call isolated, simultaneously Telstras exchange in 
&gt; Yankalilla and the mobile network south of Willunga went down for a period 
&gt; of about 20 minutes about a month ago. So no mobile and no landline, it was 
&gt; all dead. Try getting an outage notice at that time if you are totally with 
&gt; telstra!!!!

a couple of months ago the whole area around Mt Isa was
cut off (landline, mobiles, internet the lot) cos a bush rat
chewed through only fibre cable into the area
