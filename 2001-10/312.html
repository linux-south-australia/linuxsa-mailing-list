&gt; Thankyou all very much for your helpful comments and suggestions.  It seems
&gt; that, because of the VIA chipset problem, RedHat 7.1 and I are destined not
&gt; to dance.  Perhaps that'll have to wait until a later incarnation of RH.
&gt; 
&gt; In the meantime, and as suggested by a number of you, I'm going to give
&gt; Mandrake a try.  A friend has generously offered me a copy of Mandrake 8.0
&gt; so I'll try it as a new starting point before doing anything else.  See how
&gt; we go.

I would think that it is a kernel related issue and not specific to a
distribution. Mandrake 8.0 may have a similar problem given the version of
the kernel. From memory (I think) RH7.1 uses 2.4.2 and MDK8.0 uses 2.4.3.
I would try Mandrake 8.1 for a "quick and easy" kernel upgrade
(potentially easier than compiling a new kernel on your box with RH7.1).
But then given the feed back on here, that might be less than perfect as
well. :-)

Dale.
