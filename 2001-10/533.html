Hmm mandrake 8.1? There is a few things you can do. Firstly run ntsysv
and disable most of the services :) 

Probably leave:

crond
cups
gpm
harddrake
keytable
kheader
netfs
network
ntpd ? if you want time sync. If not internet connected, disable it
numlock
random
smb
sshd
syslog
telnet
xfs

A lot of this is personal preference, but thats how Ive got my
workstation here configured. If there is no network remove netfs,
network, smb, sshd, telnet 

Some people would say always remove telnet. I think it depends on your
situation. If you have an abundance of linux machines with ssh on them,
then remove telnet - you wont need it.

Modify /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

if using apache find the section with:

MinSpareServers 1
MaxSpareServers 2

StartServers 2

and do something like that. With the default of 150 clients per server
that'll still give you capacity (in theory) to serve 300 clients
simultaneously, but you'll save a few meg of ram per instance, and when
it defaults to 10 instances that should help a fair bit.

Generally with 64mb of ram, and any of the recent distros try and save
ram because the biggest bottleneck is the swapping.

Nautilus sucks huge amounts of ram, so disable it if you can (not sure
how to go about this).

&gt; 
&gt;  The computers are generally running Intel 200 MMX CPU
&gt;  with 64 M RAM and a 4 G drive.
&gt; 
&gt;  At present with a default workstation install the
&gt;  machines run "slower than a wet week". It seems to take
&gt;  ages to bring up StarOffice 5.2 and then do any real
&gt;  work.
&gt; 
&gt;  Even with StarOffice 6 beta and OpenOffice 638C the
&gt;  machine seems to be slow. 
&gt; 
&gt;  Has anybody got some ideas on tweaking the system to
&gt;  come up with significant speed improvements without
&gt;  resorting to RAM upgrades and other paths.
