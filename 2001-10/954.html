&gt; &gt; I heard it was just not that crash on Intel hardware, but quite nice
&gt; &gt; when you run it on Sun gear...
&gt; 
&gt; indeed... still, bang-for-buck-wise, Intel hardware (even with
&gt; Solaris) beats Sun Hardware, and unless you spend up big on Sun kit,
&gt; it's hard to beat a $2-3K intel system, when comparing performance
&gt; alone.

yeah sort of... for a desktop machine only perhaps...
although you can get base ultra desktop machines for about
the same price as "name brand" PCs.
(my sparc5 is not as fast as my duron700 but I still prefer it)

&gt; Also, don't quote me on this, but I have a suspicion that Linux on
&gt; SPARC is faster than Solaris on SPARC. If not, it most likely would be
&gt; if it were optimised properly... Linux has less overhead than Solaris.
&gt; They have different design goals, and acheive different ends.

linux is faster than solaris on old sparc hardware, recent
versions of solaris on recent Sun hardware is faster than linux
on that Sun hardware.  There's performance comparisons ad infinitum
all over the web I believe.
 
&gt; IMHO, Solaris on Intel is a dud idea. However, it suits that part of
&gt; the market that want a commercial OS (or specifically Solaris) to run
&gt; on cheap hardware or laptops.

certainly solaris x86 is not as good as solaris sparc but I wouldn't
say it's a dud idea.  My last employer only used solaris and mostly
only sparc/ultra machines but we had a bunch of machines whose job
was to contain a bunch of ISA and PCI cards (telco and DSP cards)
and collect and process data.  x86 boxes were cheaper and the
cheaper Sun boxes can only fit up to about 3 or so PCI cards (and
not ISA at all).  So ease of maintenance is one good reason to
use solaris x86 (and the fact that the proprietry cards we used
didn't come with linux drivers), besides if a PC is sluggish
you chuck in a faster CPU and more memory, cost = $bugger-all.
 
That said, the amount of trouble we had with PC hardware compared
to the Sun gear was unbelievable.  PC hardware is just not
"industrial strength".  You pay more for Sun hardware sure but
compared to wages and loss of time and productivity and sales,
it's not worth it.

&gt; As usual, you choose the best tool for the job, given your restraints
&gt; and requirements.

indeed.

Dave.
