&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt; I read on one of the Zd sites that rh 7.2 has an ext3 file system (log
&gt; file) I assume it's reiser? Has anyone installed it looked at it? I was

&gt; mandrake 8.1 instead. Does anyone have an opinions on either?

Hi Evan

You're right - Red Hat 7.2 does include a journaling filesystem, but it
is not reiserfs.  They have instead decided to use the ext3 filesystem.
The advantage of this is that one is able to easily convert one's
partitions between the ext2 and ext3 filesystems without much hassle.

I think ext3 would be quite a reliable filesystem.  I am sure it has
been extensively tested by Red Hat before it was deployed (they are one
of the last major dists to include a journaling fs).  I use reiserfs at
the moment (not in a very demanding situation though), and have not
encountered any problems, but I have heard some reports of it playing up
occaisionally.  You may wish to investigate furhter.

I haven't looked at 7.2 yet, but hopefully I will be able to install it
this weekend.  If you have access to a CD burner, I could lend you the
CDs next week for copying.

As for the comparison to Mandrake 8.1 - I think the many 8.1 related
messages to this list may give you some indication of the general
robustness of that particular relase.  In general, Red Hat's x.2
releases are normally quite good.

Cheers,

Tim
