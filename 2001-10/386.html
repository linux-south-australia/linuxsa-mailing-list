That's ok, MIME does multipart really well.

&gt; 1) Can IMAP be used in disconnected mode -- ie so a laptop can have
&gt; a copy of their mail locally, and can search and interact with it
&gt; while disconnected, but when reconnecting, will re-synchronise,
&gt; so it maintains two copies of everything -- one on the server that
&gt; gets backed up and is accessible over webmail, and one on the client
&gt; that is local and is accessible when not connected...

Yes.

[None of the following should be taken as me saying IMAP is a nice
protocol. I think it is bloated and suffers from poor design and silly
personality quirks. I am also sure it is the only sensible mail access
protocol for ordinary users. For some people rsyncing Maildir folders 
works well, but they are in the minority :-]

&gt; 2) Can all imapd's do this, or is it only a few...

All decent imapd's have been able to do it since 1995 or so. For evidence,
see the older imap document:

    <A HREF="http://www.imap.org/papers/docs/disc-status.html">http://www.imap.org/papers/docs/disc-status.html</A>

which explains how any compliant server should be able to support offline
mode, and and also the hot-off-the-press imap draft, which shows how this
is getting more explicit support:

    <A HREF="http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crispin-imapv-15.txt">http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crispin-imapv-15.txt</A>

Nearly all the work in doing IMAP offline is in the client.

&gt; 3) Can Outlook do this? [OT] 

It isn't OT at all. See the synchronisation section of
<A HREF="http://www.css.qmw.ac.uk/mail/imap/outlook/basics/basics.htm.">http://www.css.qmw.ac.uk/mail/imap/outlook/basics/basics.htm.</A>

&gt; ... or are there any other Windows MUAs that can do this?

Mulberry is my alltime favourite for a Windows IMAP/SMTP/MIME/IMSP/LDAP
client that really knows what it is doing. See
<A HREF="http://www.cyrusoft.com/mulberry/.">http://www.cyrusoft.com/mulberry/.</A> It also runs on Linux, MacOS and other
platforms. It is closed source payware. It sticks to standards extremely
well.

Does anyone know of a free software cross-platform GUI client that
supports these standards? Maybe the mail component in Mozilla, these days.
It is 12 months since I last installed every Windows freeware client I
could find, and found them all unusable except for trivial cases. Anyone
who installs a free IMAP server in a typical office has to have a set of
client software options. I concluded that Mulberry, Eudora, Outlook and
Pegasus were the best, in that order and not considering potential to
become virus distribution points. Pegasus would have ranked higher but had
no LDAP/IMSP support at the time, and its interface was a little clunky.
