Quoting Adam W &lt;<A HREF="mailto:woja@optushome.com.au">woja@optushome.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; &gt; Is Microsoft trying to kill Linux interoperability?  What do you think?
&gt; 
&gt; Yes and No.
&gt; No, they are just trying to make more money and be more monopolistic
&gt; and Yes, as to be more monopolistic they have to try and rid the industry
&gt; of
&gt; anyone trying to beat them.

I think it's even a bit more sinister than that.  The *open source development 
model* is a threat to Microsoft, not necessarily Linux-itself or any specific 
open-source project.  So discrediting Linux and obseleting Samba are just small 
battles in the bigger war - closed source "we'll serve up crappy software and 
you'll pay us every 2 years to upgrade for more of the same" verses the open 
source model (where you can pay someone to fix show-stoppers yourself) and not 
become dependant upon consumer-unresponsive monoliths.
  
&gt; I really think if Linux could offer a similar solution to exchange e.g The
&gt; diary features, mail, and contacts all stored on the server to also be
&gt; accessed by webmail - and to be reasonably easy to setup and administer,
&gt; then those people using exchange would not bother with microsoft anymore.

We have this is in "Evolution".  Now in it's 5th beta, with the 1.0 release 
coming on-line RSN.  It's quite a professional looking (& working) product, and 
show-cases how a commercial company (Ximian) can operate in the oss community 
and produce something comparable to Outlook.  And it's GPL :-)  The only thing 
lacking is the web interface - but since a) the source is freely available, and 
b) it's built upon open-standards, this is a non-event as anyone can add this if 
they see it being useful[2].

Ciao,

Michael... 

[1] "better" can mean more secure, more feature-rich, more maintainable etc etc 
etc
[2] Not wanting to digress too far, but reading "Rebel Code" recently 
enlightened me to the sort of people who start scratching an itch.  Dave Millar 
(of Linux networking fame) started submitting patches to the Linux kernel that 
didn't even compile - he was learning C at the same time as wanting to help out 
with kernel development.  Linus (& others) helped him out by teaching him what 
makes good code, and look at him now - a senior hacker amongst the kernel 
leutenants!  Just shows that willingness to help is more important than ability.
