&gt; &gt; Fortunately this all happened in business hours when there were people

&gt; &gt; your key staff have Optus mobile phones..

&gt; probably getting a bit OT, but...
&gt; if you have key staff relying on optus mobiles, you're asking
&gt; for trouble.  I love to promote competition to telstra but
&gt; for mobile phones, optus GSM coverage is just useless.  Even
&gt; vodafone is better.

That is a very generalised statement. It really depends on where you are, 
and what situation you are in. Generally yes I do support your statement 
that Telstra have better coverage Australia wide and a more reliable 
network, HOWEVER. You cannot say that they have better coverage everywhere. 
For example, at the moment I am in Normanville (south of Adelaide), and 
here coverage quality would be probably in order of best to worst, Optus, 
Telstra, Vodafone.. however go down the road a bit, and Telstra is on top 
and Voda doesn't even have coverage. Again it really depends on the 
situation. (btw I have a telstra gsm mobile). Thank god I am only here till 
January. I have coverage but can't even make a call inside my house without 
it dropping out.

&gt; For most people, it's not really a problem especially not if it's 
&gt; significantly cheaper but for small tradesmen or support or people  
&gt; who rely on their mobile to earn their income you're mad to use 
&gt; anything other than telstra GSM or CDMA (the only problem with CDMA 
&gt; being that you can't send/receive SMS to the other carriers).

You can send/receive inter-carrier SMS messages now on the CDMA network.
However the stupid thing with CDMA is you need a different handset. And 
there aren't many choices.

&gt; Dave (PS. this isn't related to yesterday's optus outage - all
&gt; carriers will have the occasional outage)

Hehe, what you would call isolated, simultaneously Telstras exchange in 
Yankalilla and the mobile network south of Willunga went down for a period 
of about 20 minutes about a month ago. So no mobile and no landline, it was 
all dead. Try getting an outage notice at that time if you are totally with 
telstra!!!!


My 2.2 cents worth,

Regards,

Michael
