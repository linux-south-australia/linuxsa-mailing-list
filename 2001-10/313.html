John, 

&gt; Unfortunately most OS's only 'initialise' hard drives at boot,
&gt; usually relying on information transferred to them by the bios. If
&gt; the drive isn't present on boot then the OS won't automatically make
&gt; the right device entries for it etc.

You could also make the IDE driver a module and reload it.  Ofcourse,
your root file system (and any other file systems you want while you
swap) would then have to reside on a device which was not IDE.

&gt; As seen on last week's episode, I use the 3ware IDE controllers in a
&gt; number of systems, which overcome most of the above problems by
&gt; abstracting the IDE interface from the OS. The OS sees a scsi
&gt; drive(s) which is actually made up of multiple IDE hard
&gt; disks. Because the firmware can re-initialise a drive without
&gt; rebooting, new drives can be added to an array on the fly. The
&gt; firmware is accessed by OS-specific software that has a web
&gt; interface.

Sounds interesting.  Where can I get more details or these, where can
I buy one and how much are they?  

&gt; This doesn't help much if you want hot-swap for data portability
&gt; (maybe look at an external USB/IDE casing) but its a definate plus
&gt; if 100% uptime is your goal. Also, the 3ware cards are EOL'd as of
&gt; last week, so get one soon if you're interested :)

USB would be good but I think it is going to be too slow for the
application I want to use it for.  

Do you know where I can get the equivalent firewire hardware and if
Linux supports it (firewire marked experimental in 2.4 kernel)?  I
know you can firewire hard disks but you are talking about a device
which costs 2-3 times the equlvalent IDE disk.  

Regards and thanks,
Michael
