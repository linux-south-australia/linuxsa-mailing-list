Greg and Ian!

&gt; Have you tried FreeBSD?  

Yes :-)

&gt; Some people claim that it runs a whole lot
&gt; faster.  If you install the same packages, the end user won't know the
&gt; difference.

I'm not so certain about this, but I'm not as good at tweaking FreeBSD
as I am Linux. I think that Ian's managed to convince the powers that be
that Linux is good and he might have other reasons (read: political) for
not attempting to reconvince people about FreeBSD.

&gt; I've found pretty much the opposite.  In any case, it's a 4 GB drive,
&gt; so that shouldn't be the issue.  The amount of stuff on the disk is
&gt; only marginally related to performance.

Unless you start to fill a partition up...I understand that ext2's
allocation algorithms start to be defeated (excuse grammar) at about
above about 95% full.

&gt; Why?

Two reasons.

Everyone seems to agree that it's the right amount [side note: I think
the FreeBSD VM is optimised for at least 2 times physical memory]. And
if you've got 64Mb of physical memory, these days it's not much.

&gt; &gt; Try rebuilding the kernel and throwing as much as you can out of it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd be interested to see if that makes a significant difference.  You
&gt; might save a few 100 kB like that; how much difference will that make?

You might actually lose memory, however if you fiddle with the
optimisation options (eg, send them to -O3) and the architecture options
(-march and -mcpu) and the alignment options (-malign-loops et al) and
other optimisation options it is possible to get your kernel to go
significantly faster.

In my opinion, unless you're dealing with embedded Linux, it's best to
optimise the kernel for speed rather than size.
