Just as an aside, they are in Voluntary Administration, _not_ liquidation.

The VA is there to try to keep the company running.

If they find that it is not possible to do so, _then_ the company goes into liquidation.

I have learnt a little about the VA's etc as the company that I work for has just appointed one.

Anyone out there been through this (ie working for a company under VA) and willing to share their experience?
