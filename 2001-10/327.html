Hi Dan,

Over the last few weeks I have done a number of installs of StarOffice. 
Each time I mount the CD, then either using the gui or most of the time 
a terminal box (so I can use the -net option), tab out to 
the /linux/program/setup and then ./ to run the setup file.

It starts up the script, asks where I want to put StarOffice and then 
installs it. Standard.

This time I could not run setup for StarOffice nor SOPLayer. Anything 
to do with the CD apart forom looking or copying gave me a "Permission 
denied message."

It wasn't anything (that I know of) to do with any default directory 
because it all worked fine on so many other occasiosn. I took the same 
CD across to my RH 7.1 box and installed in the same way without a 
problem.

Ergo. Something on my Mandrake 8.1 box is SNAFU &lt;G&gt;

BTW, the 8.1 was installed as an update on top of 8.0 just in case that 
gives a clue to anybody.

Cheers,  Ian

&gt; 
&gt; Sounds like "went to the CD" might be the key phrase. I wonder if you
&gt; typed "cd /cdrom" or did something with a similar effect.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; So I tried again with other setups, "Permission denied."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I rang Mike (thanks mate) and he suggested copying the files 
&gt; into /tmp 
&gt; &gt; which I did. Install proceded without a hitch.
&gt; 
&gt; It might have been as simple as whether your default directory was
&gt; writeable or not. Still sounds like a bit of bad design in Star 
&gt; Office,but remember that even root cannot write to a CD ROM 
&gt; (except in extremely
&gt; hot weather when the plastic is softer.)
