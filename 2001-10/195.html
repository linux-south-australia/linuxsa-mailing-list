&gt; For those not reading /., WRS has laid off a team of FreeBSD
&gt; developers... Not being particularly familiar with the FreeBSD world,
&gt; I'd like to know quite what that means. Is it kinda like (say) RedHat
&gt; laying off their Linux developers, and allowing their distribution to
&gt; be taken over by other parties, but retaining the copyright to the
&gt; "RedHat" moniker?

Something like that.  I've been following this more closely, of
course.

I had my doubts about Wind River from the start.  A number of people
were suspicious of their motives, but I don't think that was the
problem.  The motives were, I believe, honourable.  Their ability to
cope was, to put it bluntly, terrible.  I found them very difficult to
deal with, and they didn't really seem to know what they want.

As regards the trade mark, I believe the statement made in /.:

  Q: WRS currently own the trademark "FreeBSD". Do WRS plan to retain
     the trademark? If so, why? If not, will WRS let the trademark
     lapse? Or are there plans to transfer it to a third party, such
     as the FreeBSD Foundation?

  A: Wind River plans to ensure continuation of the altruistic, open
     stewardship of the FreeBSD trademark.  We feel strongly that the
     FreeBSD project must be protected and encouraged and that a
     FreeBSD trademark in the wrong hands could be very
     detrimental. We continue to search for the best solution. No
     specific third-party has yet been determined, but transfer to a
     suitable third-party is the leading option being considered.

This is a bit silly, really, since obviously the FreeBSD Foundation
would be an appropriate owner.  I suspect WRS had not previously heard
of them, which is at least partially the fault of the Foundation,
which hasn't been keeping a very high profile.

It's sad, though, that it had to come to this.  It's possible that we
should have been more careful earlier this year, but we really didn't
expect Wind River to be this incompetent.

Where do we go from here?  There are already alternative sources of
FreeBSD, and the layoffs (four, I believe) only make a very small
proportion of the developers.  They will also not stop working on
FreeBSD, so I don't really see much change.  It's unfortunate for the
people who were laid off, of course, but that's probably the worst
thing that could happen.

In addition, in the last 24 hours two very well known companies (I
guarantee you've all heard of both of them), both large FreeBSD users,
have contacted the FreeBSD core team and offered substantial support.
We're still discussing the issue, and I don't think that it's
appropriate to mention their names until we know we're going to work
with them.
