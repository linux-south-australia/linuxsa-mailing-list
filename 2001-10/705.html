It is amazing the stupid little things you can get up to on a spring Sunday
when your wife says you should be mowing the lawn and you want to get out of
it.

I got sick of my Nokia 3210 logo designed a new one and uploaded it to the
phone.

It now says

LINUX INSIDE

The logo is shared on www.blueskyfrog.com under the name tL560050 if you
want to download it.

It does look kinda cool.

I know of at least one Adelaide Linux guru who has a Tux sticker on his
phone, so I know this will amuse some.

For the record (some may care) Most logos are designed as 72 x 14 two colour
bitmaps and then uploaded to the phone.

If anyone really wants this attached via e-mail contact me off list.

Well it off to do the lawn, I wonder if the wife would believe the mower has
an odd number plate and I can't get unleaded for it.

Your in a lazy Sunday,

Patrick Browne

P.S. I tried to get a TUX on the logo but the little guy looked crap at the
small size and in two colours, oh well, now that would have been cool!!
