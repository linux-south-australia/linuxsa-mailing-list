&gt; Hi Ant,
&gt; Good question. The cable runs between floors and through a roof cavity,
&gt; but doesn't go particularly close to anything remarkable. It's about a
&gt; 15M cable run - crossovered from one device to the other. The alternate
&gt; cable I tried went a different route past some air conditioners.

You'd think not then.. hmm....
 
&gt; The time it takes for the problem to surface is random and it's
&gt; difficult to reproduce - the only other thing I know that I didn't
&gt; mention is that on our router the collisions on the ethernet interface
&gt; are about 2.5% of the packets transmitted, whereas on the other router
&gt; it's 0.9%. The link is half duplex, 10Mbit. I thought about changing it
&gt; to full duplex, but the module parameter to change this requests a value
&gt; between 1 and 8 :) Whether or not this is related I'm not sure. I ran a

Have a look at the module source in the kernel. That'll tell you what
number you need. However, I think the 10mbit standard doesnt specify
full duplex and there are different proprietry standards for it
(conformation?) So, unless you have the same brand of everything 10mbit
full duplex could be asking for trouble.

&gt; duplicate setup in a different location with all the same equipment and
&gt; it functioned flawlessly for a few days, with much fewer collisions.
&gt; With the other cable collisions seemed to happen at the same rate, so I
&gt; switched back to the original one as it presented less of a trip-over
&gt; risk to everyone.

What happens to the collisions when the packets start getting lost? Do
they increase as you loose packets or not?
