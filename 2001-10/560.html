Mike!

&gt; the lights on memory windows manager around. I also twitched the IDE but
&gt; there was not much to gain there when from 2.5Mb/sec to 5Mb/sec.

It's only a 100% improvement...

&gt; The slow loading time is just a factor of the amount of data to load and the
&gt; processor speed.

I think I've heard it said that OpenOffice and Mozilla suffer at startup
partly because they're written in C++ (and setting up all the virtual
tables to support C++ objects takes a lot of time). What's it like when
it's actually running?

Mind you, if OpenOffice were the tortoise and Microsoft Office were the
hare we'd have to rewrite Aesop's fable.

&gt; This leaves very little left for using the software and an interface which
&gt; leave a little bit to be desired for a windows user.
&gt; 
&gt; There is just no way of making this work any faster, at least that I could
&gt; see.

There is a limit to what we can do with the resources that we have. It's
simply not possible to achieve Gnome/KDE/Aqua/Windows GUI functionality
without using a huge amount of system resources (caveat: at least in the
current versions).

[ Aqua is what I call the GUI Mac Os X interface; it's quite good but
one button mice always confuse me ]
