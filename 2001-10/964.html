 &gt; I would think that those who want to use Linux for what they want to do
 &gt; would avoid or work around the module. The module would only seem to be a
 &gt; requirement for running MS apps and services. Don't want IIS?, use apache,
 &gt; dont want Explorer?, use Mozilla, and so on. It seems like it would be
 &gt; almost an application level add-on which would really then just be a
 &gt; component of MS Office or Bock Office server etc... So you would really
 &gt; only be paying for those and not the Linux kernel.
 
Let's assume that running Office was a desirable thing.  And let's further
assume that Office required the aforementioned kernel module.

Finally, let's assume that the kernel module permitted itself to be
loaded, but that the only way it could be unloaded would be by rebooting.

So - the "average user" wants to run Office.  They also don't want to 
reboot every time they finish using it.  So will they (a) not use Office
after all, (b) reboot whenever they've used office, or (c) just put up
with the fact that they have this kernel module which they don't quite
understand on their system which they can't get rid of ?

Sure, you might object to the presence of the module and not use Office,
or reboot all the time.  But what about someone who didn't really give
a shit, as long as they could view their PowerPoint presentations?

Those people would have a subtly incompatible version of Linux (due to 
the presence of the kernel module), and you might have interoperability
problems with them as a result.  Indeed, since that'd be the whole point
of the module existing in the first place, it's pretty much /guaranteed/
that you'd have interoperability problems.  So you'd need to make a choice
between putting up with those problems, writing code to overcome them, 
or just biting the bullet and buying the kernel module yourself too.

... which is really the same kind of problem that we deal with every day
when we're trying to interoperate with a Windows world using our open 
source OS's, isn't it?  So our hypothetical kernel module would make 
interoperating with Linux similar to interoperating with Windows:  Either
ride the Microsoft juggernaut or put up with things that don't work and
endless reams of code which need to be written in the interests of 
ideological purity.

Or, in other words, it'd "fork" Linux.

MS could even sell the kernel module at a price which approximated the
OEM price for Windows XP, thereby getting the same amount of cash out
of each PC whether it runs Windows or Linux.  And I challenge you to 
show me where the GPL would have a problem with that.

 &gt; I guess this would be the same if MS did it with say a FreeBSD
 &gt; ditribution, people would only use the 'real' FreeBSD and ignore the MS
 &gt; one. Or is it the same?

It's the same, but I don't agree that people /would/ use the non-MS
version.  I think they'd flock to the MS version, just so they could
use Office and IE.  You might not, but you're one of the 10% of the computer
using population who understands just how mediocre Microsoft really is.
