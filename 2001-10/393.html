&gt; &gt; You should be using Perl :-).  Try:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; # iptables -L -vn|perl '-pes/\b(\d+)([KMG])\b/$1*10**($2eq K?3:$2eq M?6:9)/eg'
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; The above Perl will also work on your demo file (and shouldn't be much
&gt; &gt; less readable than trying to do the same in sh :-).
&gt; 
&gt; And this is why perl is known as a write-only langauge :-)

&gt; Michael...
&gt; 
&gt; Question:  If I sample a hundred lines of random line noise, how much of it will 
&gt; be valid perl?


Maybe some.
But so what?

Output a 100 lines of rtruly random noise and their si a possibly you will
end up with valid C too.
Thats the nature of random stuff.

Just because people choose to write difficult to read perl ins ta
function of the language.
Thats a problem between keyboard and chair.

I can write perfectly readable perl, well at elast a s readable as my
Java, ada or c.

The difference is that perl make sthe prgrammer responisble and in doing
so allows the programmer great flexibility.

I like perl and agree with Geffory that it woudl probably be a better
langauge to do what the guy wnated, except I think the Nik wanted a
vehicle for leanrnign a bit of shell, where perl wont really help you.

But to argue against perl because some people maybe even many write in an
ambiguoys way is crazy.

Ever heard of the obscuferated C competition?

That is where C programeers demonstrate that if you want you can make C
undreadbale if you choose.

Bagging a language because some people use it poorly is like bagging guns
or cars because some _people_ use them poorly.

It is, imo, silly.
