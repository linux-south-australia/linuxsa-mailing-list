Quoting Evan Bourlotos &lt;<A HREF="mailto:evan@cs.adelaide.edu.au">evan@cs.adelaide.edu.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt; I read on one of the Zd sites that rh 7.2 has an ext3 file system (log
&gt; file) I assume it's reiser? Has anyone installed it looked at it? I was
&gt; thinking of doing the download) but then thought maybe i should try
&gt; mandrake 8.1 instead. Does anyone have an opinions on either?

ext3 is ext3.  ReiserFS is ResierFS.  They're different beasts.

ext3 is an extension to ext2, adding journalling.  It's backwards/forwards 
compatible with ext2 (ie you can upgrade an ext2 to ext3, and you can mount an 
ext3 as an ext2, and ext3 tools can be used on an ext2 - at least AFAIK).

ext3 has the bonus of building upon ext2 stability, whereas new comers like 
ReiserFS don't yet have the test of time.  Red Hat suggest they've been using 
ext3 internally for over 12 (18?) months.  There was a bit of a hullabaloo when 
Red Hat announced it was going ext3 instead of ReiserFS, but on balance it was 
probably the right decision.

RH7.2 certainly looks very interesting.  Waiting for my copy to arrive.  Looking 
forward to python 2.2/GNOME1.4 becoming standard install items.  The 
professional edition comes with 11CDs!  That's a lot of software.

Michael...
