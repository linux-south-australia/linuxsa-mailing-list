&gt; Hi all...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a hardware SCSI RAID (0/1 or 5) solution for a debian
&gt; server...  Have been looking at Adaptec 3200s cards, but am interested
&gt; in what else people are using, specifically if they have been using it
&gt; with Debian, and what experiences they have had with them.


I have used the Adaptec 3200 and the Mylex DAC960. Neither with Debian, 
but that really should not matter. Linux is what matters.

The Adaptec 3200 is supported in 2.4.10! So next round of distro's 
should support it.


&gt; What I really want is one that is supported by the standard kernel
&gt; with no recompiles needed. Yeah yeah, kernel compiles are easy etc...
&gt; I can do it, I'd just rather not, all other things being equal...


Well, as I say above.


&gt; Also, does anyone here have any practial experience with adding
&gt; capacity to a RAID array? I want to be able to purchase (say) 75Gb of
&gt; usable space now, and add up to 200Gb more as time goes on... I would
&gt; assume this is a matter of powering down (or not, if hotswappable
&gt; drives and enclosures are used...), doing some RAID device
&gt; configuration (this probably requires powering down), and then using
&gt; growfs to grow the filesystem onto the new disk(s)... Have I got this
&gt; approximately right, or am I imagining things? Also, would this be
&gt; harder/slower/unreliable if one was using RAID 5 (as the striping may
&gt; change drastically...) as against RAID 0/1 (where, I guess, the
&gt; striping would change just as drastically, now that I think about
&gt; it...)

This is hard. Hardware RAID solutions do not support this, AFAIK. You 
need LVM for this.


&gt; Also, would people generally recommend putting system software off the
&gt; RAID somewhere (perhaps an IDE disk) and just data on the RAID so that
&gt; in the case of a RAID disaster, one can still boot and function as
&gt; expected, and can even unmount and work on the RAID while the system
&gt; is up...?
