&gt; I am working with a community project to provide a stack
&gt;  of older computers with Linux and StarOffice and at
&gt;  present am looking at Red Hat 7.1 and Mandrake 8.1 as
&gt;  candidates for the Operating Systems.
&gt; 
&gt;  The computers are generally running Intel 200 MMX CPU
&gt;  with 64 M RAM and a 4 G drive.
&gt; 
&gt;  At present with a default workstation install the
&gt;  machines run "slower than a wet week". It seems to take
&gt;  ages to bring up StarOffice 5.2 and then do any real
&gt;  work.

Whilst it takes a long time, I usually prefer to do a custom install and
only install what's necessary. Most distributions have some pre-packaged
install types (eg, server, workstation, etc), but they all usually end up
installing 90% of the CD anyway....

&gt;  Even with StarOffice 6 beta and OpenOffice 638C the
&gt;  machine seems to be slow. 

I'm not sure what the recommended system requirements are. Have you
checked them?

&gt;  Has anybody got some ideas on tweaking the system to
&gt;  come up with significant speed improvements without
&gt;  resorting to RAM upgrades and other paths.

For security and performance, you can always start by turning of unneeded
services. On a RedHat-based systems, you can use the 'ntsysv' tool to tell
your Linux distribution which services you want to have run on
startup. Most distributions will run far too much.

Are these machines going to be used on a network (I gather not from your
comments last night)? If not, you can turn off most services. You don't
need your standalone PC to act as a mail server or file server.

You may want to look at getting some help setting up something like a
RedHat kickstart thingo, so that you can install it once on one machine
(having someone around to help you decide which packages are
necessary) and then duplicate that relatively easily across your other
machines.

I hope some of these random thought help :-)

thx,
Matt
