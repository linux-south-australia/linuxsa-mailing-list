Move your soundcard down to the opposite end of your computer from all the
other cards..

I've noticed that video cards are particularly bad at generating RF
interference, although at least it's fairly constant. Harddrive I/O and the
like appearing on your soundcard line-out sounds more like a problem of bad
filtering.. Try getting a better soundcard? Look for one with good
capacitors on the power lines.

&gt; I always find this iritating -- I had a computer that would buzz every
&gt; time I moved the mouse, and click on certain other actions. I'm
&gt; certain it wasn't a theme-based noise, and couldn't figure out how to
&gt; get rid of it. It was very very irritating. Anyone know how to get rid
&gt; of noises like this?
