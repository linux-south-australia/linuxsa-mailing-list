&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; I heard it was just not that crash on Intel hardware, but quite nice
&gt; &gt; &gt; when you run it on Sun gear...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; indeed... still, bang-for-buck-wise, Intel hardware (even with
&gt; &gt; Solaris) beats Sun Hardware, and unless you spend up big on Sun kit,
&gt; &gt; it's hard to beat a $2-3K intel system, when comparing performance
&gt; &gt; alone.
&gt; 
&gt; yeah sort of... for a desktop machine only perhaps...
&gt; although you can get base ultra desktop machines for about
&gt; the same price as "name brand" PCs.
&gt; (my sparc5 is not as fast as my duron700 but I still prefer it)

mmm... they still aren't as fast for the $ -- even the new SunBlades,
which are very very nice...

&gt; &gt; Also, don't quote me on this, but I have a suspicion that Linux on
&gt; &gt; SPARC is faster than Solaris on SPARC. If not, it most likely would be
&gt; &gt; if it were optimised properly... Linux has less overhead than Solaris.
&gt; &gt; They have different design goals, and acheive different ends.
&gt; 
&gt; linux is faster than solaris on old sparc hardware, recent
&gt; versions of solaris on recent Sun hardware is faster than linux
&gt; on that Sun hardware.  There's performance comparisons ad infinitum
&gt; all over the web I believe.

yeah, and it depends on your definition of "faster" too... :)

&gt; &gt; IMHO, Solaris on Intel is a dud idea. However, it suits that part of
&gt; &gt; the market that want a commercial OS (or specifically Solaris) to run
&gt; &gt; on cheap hardware or laptops.
&gt; 
&gt; certainly solaris x86 is not as good as solaris sparc but I wouldn't
&gt; say it's a dud idea.  My last employer only used solaris and mostly
&gt; only sparc/ultra machines but we had a bunch of machines whose job
&gt; was to contain a bunch of ISA and PCI cards (telco and DSP cards)
&gt; and collect and process data.  x86 boxes were cheaper and the
&gt; cheaper Sun boxes can only fit up to about 3 or so PCI cards (and
&gt; not ISA at all).  So ease of maintenance is one good reason to
&gt; use solaris x86 (and the fact that the proprietry cards we used
&gt; didn't come with linux drivers), besides if a PC is sluggish
&gt; you chuck in a faster CPU and more memory, cost = $bugger-all.

yeah, we have reason to use it also, and it's hard to see what else to
use sometimes, but ...

&gt;  
&gt; That said, the amount of trouble we had with PC hardware compared
&gt; to the Sun gear was unbelievable.  PC hardware is just not
&gt; "industrial strength".  You pay more for Sun hardware sure but
&gt; compared to wages and loss of time and productivity and sales,
&gt; it's not worth it.
&gt;

this is the problem -- x86 hardware with Solaris tends to be less
supported, less stable, and generally sucky :)
 
anyawy, way way OT now...

bye
