There have been a few people knocking mandrake 8.1 without reason on
this list, so I thought I'd send this email.

I have started compiling a list of bugs that I have found in mandrake
8.1. I only started last night, although I could remember a few I found
prior, so here goes:

1) On my first attempt to upgrade from mandrake 8.0 The installer
skipped the partitioning section, and clicking on the star on the left
that should go directly back to that secion didnt work. On a second try
I did get the partitioning section.

2) Sound was screwed - something to do with devfs, fixed by removing the
/dev/dsp link and replacing it.

3) I modified /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 to change the screen res to
1280x1024. Following this change after logging in to X, the background
pic would resize to 1280x1024 as it should, hang there for a second then
re-size to 1024x768. It still does this and I cant work out why, and it
looks damn ugly.

4) I manually installed grub, although the mandrake boot loader config
cant work this out and thinks Im still running lilo. If I go to the boot
loader config screen, and hit cancel, the applet crashes and will not
run again.

5) My desk pager only swaps to the view port to the left or right, not
up or down. I tryed to change the viewport settings by right clicking on
the pager and modifying the settings, but I couldnt make it function how
I liked. Now if I use the gnome config tool for the pager it crashes as
soon as I change anything. Pager still doesnt function how I like it.

6) The system wont shut down properly. I havnt looked in to the cause of
this. It just hangs on a black screen.

There have been more things, but I didnt document them. Most bugs seem
to be related to me changing config files manually, but that is how I
have always done it and plan to continue doing it, and what ever distro
I run has to be able to deal with it better than mandrake 8.1. I should
add that Mandrake 8.0 had none of these problems.
