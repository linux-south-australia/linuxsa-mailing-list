<H1>Hardware RAID on Debian</H1>

Hi all...

I'm looking for a hardware SCSI RAID (0/1 or 5) solution for a debian
server...  Have been looking at Adaptec 3200s cards, but am interested
in what else people are using, specifically if they have been using it
with Debian, and what experiences they have had with them.

What I really want is one that is supported by the standard kernel
with no recompiles needed. Yeah yeah, kernel compiles are easy etc...
I can do it, I'd just rather not, all other things being equal...

Also, does anyone here have any practial experience with adding
capacity to a RAID array? I want to be able to purchase (say) 75Gb of
usable space now, and add up to 200Gb more as time goes on... I would
assume this is a matter of powering down (or not, if hotswappable
drives and enclosures are used...), doing some RAID device
configuration (this probably requires powering down), and then using
growfs to grow the filesystem onto the new disk(s)... Have I got this
approximately right, or am I imagining things? Also, would this be
harder/slower/unreliable if one was using RAID 5 (as the striping may
change drastically...) as against RAID 0/1 (where, I guess, the
striping would change just as drastically, now that I think about
it...)

Also, would people generally recommend putting system software off the
RAID somewhere (perhaps an IDE disk) and just data on the RAID so that
in the case of a RAID disaster, one can still boot and function as
expected, and can even unmount and work on the RAID while the system
is up...?
