<H1>SAMBA Problems</H1>

Hi all,

I'm not sure if any of you will be able to help me with this as I'm not quite
sure what the problem is exactly, it may even be on the windows side but just
to make sure but I will do my best to explain my problem so here goes. 

I'm trying to set up SAMBA on a Redhat 5.2 box to give myself accessible 
network storage from my Win2k box, the basic problem is that I cannot access
any SAMBA shares on the Linux box from either Win2k or 98SE. Windows always 
gives the impression that it connects to the Linux box but then the connection
is rejected. I have come to this conclusion because I can see data being 
transmitted to and from the Linux box for about 20 seconds or so after login.
I know that the LAN connection is fine because I have Telnet and wu-ftpd servers
on the Linux box. 

Just in case I have forgotten a step of the process, this is what I have already
done.

1.
   Created identical account names with identical passwords on both the Win2k
 and Linux boxes

2.
   Have tried using both smbpasswd -a and smbadduser on numerous occasions to 
 create the SAMBA accounts and SMB passwords. 

3a. 
   Edited smb.conf and enabled encrypted passwords

3b.
   Setup the home directory shares, and the other network drives

3c.
   Changed the workgroup name to match that of Win2k

3d.
   Restricted SAMBA connections to come from the static network IP of my
   Win2k box (10.0.0.1 for interests sake)

3e.
   I have left user mode security enabled and not changed it to share or server
   (don't know if anyone needs to know that though)

4.
  Restarted SAMBA

If I do an /etc/rc.d/init.d/smb status I am told that both smbd and nmbd
are running, but if I do an smbstatus it displays the following table.

Samba version 2.0.10
Service		uid	gid	pid	machine
------------------------------------------------


No files locked
 

Is this table for showing active connections or should the services be showing?

If anyone could point anything out or suggest theoreticals this would be much
appreciated

Nathan Millhouse
