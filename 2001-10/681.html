&gt; No it's not.

I agree with all you have written as I wrote a preemptively
multitasking FORTH for the BBC Micro, a 6502-based machine.

But FORTH is interpreted, so there are no linkage issues.

Consider an environment with compilers that supports
preemptive multitasking but not virtual memory.  Now
what entry point address should the linker output?
The answer is that it depends upon the mix of programs
that are currently running, or that you need to
allocate unique blocks of memory per compiled program
(a dodgy problem, made worse in the 6502 by the 64KB
of address space), or that you can only output relatively-
addressed code (not possible on the 6502 where relative
addressing is only +/-128 bytes).

What you really want to do is have each program
compiled for the same entry point, and then use
virtual memory to move that address from a physical
address to a logical address.

Note that asking the linker to output relative
addresses looks like it will solve the problem,
but actually moves you back to a segmented address
space.

In short, unless you want a very constrained software
environment you need virtual memory so that preemptive
multitasking in the CPU can create a multitasking
operating system.  I've used some of these 'constrained'
systems and it's never a happy exercise.
