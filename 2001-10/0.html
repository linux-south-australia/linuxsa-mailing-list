&gt; I have an iMac which I would like to connect to the linux box. Even if I
&gt; could do this in a rudimentary way so that I could get files up and down
&gt; this would be helpful, as the old 'sneaker net' has it's limitations. My
&gt; plan is this: to get the linux box to serve ftp, and just use my ftp client
&gt; on the Mac (Fetch) to ship stuff back and forth. I would then, (buoyed
&gt; along by my success) get telnet to work, then (for didactic purposes!!) a
&gt; Web server (both ways, of course) then I might just us well play with
&gt; AppleTalk...

Can I suggest netatalk. If you're running redhat there is an RPM, if not, 
there is source freely available. It basically allowas your personal file 
system to be omounted on your macintosh desk top.

&gt; however -
&gt; It don't work!
&gt; 
&gt; I have my iMac connected via an ethernet cross over cable, and I can ping
&gt; the iMac. I believe I have set up ftp right. (bear with me, I am new to
&gt; networking!) I have installed wu-ftpd and xinetd. xinetd is running (as
&gt; reported by ps -A) and ftp is enabled and in the xinetd.conf file. I can
&gt; connect to the ftp server successfully local on the linux box (via ftp)
&gt; however I get a 'connection refused' message when I try on the iMac from
&gt; Fetch. Looking in /var/log/messages tells me that the server never even
&gt; starts - it's as if whatever tells xinetd that there is some activity on
&gt; the ftp port is not working. I've checked /etc/services, and that seems to
&gt; be in order with ftp-data listed against port 20 and ftp on port 21.
&gt; 
&gt; Any hints?

As i recall xinetd has a security option which enables services from 
particular ranges. Is security enabled. Check hosts.allow and hosts.deny 
in /etc, they could be blocking access.
Can you connect to the Linux box in any other way (telnet, ssh, http etc) 
If not, then it is possibly that there is some DNS or other routing 
problem from the iMac to the Linux box.

cya
