&gt; 
&gt; That is true. On the other hand, ext3 hasn't had anything like the testing
&gt; that reiserfs has had, because it isn't part of the Linux kernel (apply a
&gt; patch from <A HREF="http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/ext3/">http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/ext3/</A> and rebuild your
&gt; kernel.) There was some controvosy when Linus included ReiserFS at the
&gt; time, but as things have turned out it settled down pretty quickly.

Agreed.  I think both are probably fairly stable, but for different reasons (as 
Dan mentions).  I have held off going for ReiserFS due to the couple of problems 
that have been found (and fixed) over the past year - probably overly 
cautiously.  

7.2 emphasised stability in their press release, so I don't think there's much 
chance of ext3 having any problems as shipped by RH.

On your other email, I think ReiserFS does look exciting.  It will be 
interesting to see where all this ext3/ReiserFS/XFS stuff goes, i.e. is there 
room for multiple players in the journalling filesystem market?
