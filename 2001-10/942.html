Trawling for flames here jonathan...

&gt; I was wondering if anyone felt strongly
&gt; regarding gpl vs bsd licensing?

The BSD licence allows you to incorporate BSD code into any other program, 
proprietry(sp?) or not, hence Mac OS X, Windows 2000 and probly XP too...
Some believe this is TRUE free code, how ever i dont beleve that it is truely 
free... I want access to that source code.

The GPL forbids that you close the source of the program, and must supply the 
source, where as the BSD licence allows it to become proprietory. This 
restricts freedoms in my opinion.

Personally, I do not really like the BSD licence. Sure it *might* be truly 
free, but that depends on your point of view. Personally I see the GPL as truly 
free, and that code released under the GPL will remain free. I believe that 
this is an important distinction between the BSD and GPL.

Likewise, the Apache licence is based on the BSD isnt it...? I see this a 
potentially shooting your self in the foot. M$ says, "Damn, IIS Sucks the big 
one... OK we will just take advantage of this BSD licenced program, Give it a 
GUI and call it IIS, and increase our maket share".

Under the BSD licence i see a piece of software, originally based on a program 
available with Source under the BSD licence. SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd 
takes advantage of this, closes the source and changes the licence, it is no 
longer free. I see this as unacceptable. That code is lost forever.

"The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too."

When I release some software under the GPL, I dont want someone coming along, 
taking my code, and closing the source. Thanks to the GPL it (hopefully) wont.

I have nothing against BSD, it rocks and is Ultra prowerful. Just dont like the 
licence...

Anyway, I think I listed to RMS too much...

&gt; 
&gt; I think i am pro-gpl and almost anti-bsd?
&gt; 
&gt; [i _like_ the viral nature of the gpl]
&gt; 
&gt; anyone got any opinions on this?

Sure most of us do...
