&gt; In short, unless you want a very constrained software

My goodness, when you're talking about a total of 64K RAM, constrained
is a given! :-)

How constrained must such a system be?  Dennis Ritchie wrote:

  ``In 1971 [..] we had moved off the original PDP-7 to the
  PDP-11/20; it had 24KB of core memory, and no memory management
  hardware at all. The operating system and most of the software
  was still in assembly language[.]''

Peter Selus, in his fabulous book, "A Quarter Century of Unix,"
quotes Neil Groundwater:

  ``An incorrect program could easily overwrite part of the kernel.''
    -- p46, "A Quarter Century of Unix", by Peter H. Selus

The operating system was 1st edition Unix, and the machines had no
protected memory and no virtual memory.

Again from Salus:

   ``What was in First Edition?  I think the easiest way to put
  it is: lots.  In terms of structures of the system, only pipes
  [..] weren't there.''

So the lesson from history is that even without protected or virtual
memory you can still have an environment sufficient to support the
patent department of a telephone company.
