&gt; Hi all...
&gt; 
&gt; I'm looking for a hardware SCSI RAID (0/1 or 5) solution for a debian
&gt; server...  Have been looking at Adaptec 3200s cards, but am interested
&gt; in what else people are using, specifically if they have been using it
&gt; with Debian, and what experiences they have had with them.

I have used mylex, adaptec, and ami megaraid. I found mylex to be the
best by far, as it "just worked" where as adaptec and megaraid both gave
me a lot of grief. Its reported that adaptec have improved, but Im not
prepared to risk it again. Megaraid havn't. The adaptec (at least the
ones I used about 9 months ago) used the i2o driver in the kernel, which
was also flakey at the time, and the first adaptec card I had got
recalled by adaptec who replaced it with 2 brand new raid cards, which
was at least something I guess (even though I didnt want any adaptec by
then).
 
&gt; What I really want is one that is supported by the standard kernel
&gt; with no recompiles needed. Yeah yeah, kernel compiles are easy etc...
&gt; I can do it, I'd just rather not, all other things being equal...

I think newer distros support all 3 out of the box. There was some
issues with mandrake 8.0 and the megaraid, because the megaraid use
qlogic scsi chips and the qlogic driver loaded first and then didnt work
properly since It was controlling half a raid card!

&gt; Also, does anyone here have any practial experience with adding
&gt; capacity to a RAID array? I want to be able to purchase (say) 75Gb of
&gt; usable space now, and add up to 200Gb more as time goes on... I would
&gt; assume this is a matter of powering down (or not, if hotswappable
&gt; drives and enclosures are used...), doing some RAID device
&gt; configuration (this probably requires powering down), and then using
&gt; growfs to grow the filesystem onto the new disk(s)... Have I got this
&gt; approximately right, or am I imagining things? 

AFAIK With hardware raid you are going to need to backup all the data to
modify the size of the raid disk (which deletes all the data) then
recreate the file system. If newer raid cards get around this, I'd like
to know about them as I am going to have to do this to one of my servers
next week :/

&gt; Also, would this be
&gt; harder/slower/unreliable if one was using RAID 5 (as the striping may
&gt; change drastically...) as against RAID 0/1 (where, I guess, the
&gt; striping would change just as drastically, now that I think about
&gt; it...)

as above... it'll be just as hard whatever way.
 
&gt; Also, would people generally recommend putting system software off the
&gt; RAID somewhere (perhaps an IDE disk) and just data on the RAID so that
&gt; in the case of a RAID disaster, one can still boot and function as
&gt; expected, and can even unmount and work on the RAID while the system
&gt; is up...?

Well, your raid should be more reliable than a non raid IDE. I havnt
seen raid disks get out of sync on hardware raid (well, execpt on the
ami megaraid, but thats another story). 

I have found mylex extreemly reliable, fast and easy to use, and if you
loose a disk with system stuff on it thats part of a raid 5 array then
your server will keep serving, but if its IDE then then your stuffed.

Mylex also has great harware support where you can see exactly whats
going on and can echo raid commands in to a special file in the proc
tree to rebuild and do consistency checks etc. Or you can script a test
that checks the status file for "OK" and emails you if its "ALERT".

See below for an example of the info you can get out the proc tree.
