I've been reading the Mandrake Forum regarding Mandrake 8.1 and most =
people are not happy with it?
My own impression is similiar, i have 2 reasonably new computers and ran =
Mandrake 8 on the main one and Suse 7.1 on the other. Everything was =
great and internet connection sharing worked well. I decided to install =
8.1 on both computers because i was so impressed with 8.0.
The install on my main computer was a disaster and i quickly went back =
to Mandrake 8 which is the best distro around, but amazingly Mandrake =
8.1 installed on my second computer with ease but after using it i still =
think Mandrake 8  is much more stable and won't bother upgrading until =
something better than Mandrake 8  comes out.
