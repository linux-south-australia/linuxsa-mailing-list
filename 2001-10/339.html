&gt; &gt; This is quoted from SANS
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bill Murray's Short Essay on Microsoft's Role In Security
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "The debate about whether people should switch away from Microsoft's
&gt; &gt; IIS misses the point. Suppose that tomorrow everyone that is knowingly
&gt; &gt; and intentionally running and using IIS turned it off. Would it
&gt; &gt; make any difference? As I understand it these malicious programs do
&gt; &gt; not exploit only copies of IIS that somebody is using, "running,"
&gt; &gt; managing, choosing, or otherwise saying grace over. They exploit all
&gt; &gt; instantiated copies of IIS.
&gt;
&gt; I was aware that many of these worms use things such as outlook as well as
&gt; Internet Information Server, but how can IIS be exploited over the network
&gt; just by being installed? Seems a little odd to me.
&gt;
&gt; Obviously if people read their mail using outlook on a server, they
&gt; deserve everything they get (yet there are still far too many people that
&gt; I *know* do this on a regular basis).
&gt;
&gt; Even the default behaviour of sharing every disk volume  out to everybody
&gt; (with 'Full Control' permissions) has been changed, so this can't be the
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; So if the machine is not running the software and the disk is not writable
&gt; over the network to people, I'm at a loss as to how IIS can still be
&gt; exploited.

Isnt he saying that because microsoft has chosen not to totally rewrite the
code, but just have patches available to solve the problems, thats where
they are going wrong??

Thats how i understood the article.
