&gt; I've been reading the Mandrake Forum regarding Mandrake 8.1 and most
people are not happy with it?
&gt; My own impression is similiar, i have 2 reasonably new computers and ran
Mandrake 8 on the main one and Suse 7.1 &gt; on the other. Everything was great
and internet connection sharing worked well. I decided to install 8.1 on
both &gt; computers because i was so impressed with 8.0.
&gt; The install on my main computer was a disaster and i quickly went back to
Mandrake 8 which is the best distro
&gt; around, but amazingly Mandrake 8.1 installed on my second computer with
ease but after using it i still think
&gt; Mandrake 8  is much more stable and won't bother upgrading until something
better than Mandrake 8  comes out.

I beg to differ. What do u mean as unstable? I belive MDK8.1 is the best
desktop linux OS you can get at the moment! There isnt much you cant do from
the desktop, and it certainly does not crash or let any naughty people in.
So i dont know where you got that it is unstable from. Perhaps if you talk
about your problems you have had with it, to show why you think its
unstable, then maybe i may change my mind. But i havent had a problem with
it!

One cannot make a judgement like "mandrake 8.1 is unstable" without giving
proper reasons.
