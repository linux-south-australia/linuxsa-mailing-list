Ian,
This configuration is similar to what my son had before I upgraded him.
Though not specific advise some things I noticed.

I installed a slackware based distro (WinLinux 2k) with 2.2 kernel and pre
KDE 2 KDE environment and it ran fine disk wasn't an issue so I setup a
healthy swap (128) with 32 mb ram StarOffice was a tad slow but more from
lack of memory I suspect (yet very workable). I had no services other than
telnet running (so I could get to it from mine)

I then installed an updated distro (winlinux 2.1k) based on rh 7.1 and it
got all the new fangled bloatware with it and it was grinding to the point
of not being acceptable (so it got blown away) and I reverted back to the
smaller (older) distro.

A far fetched approach may be to do a bare bones install and add services
then use that as a template for the others. Also you may want to look at a
different distro(s) Slackware/Debian/Turbo/Suse (no experience here) they
may offer you less painful smaller footprint configurations.

Regards

Evan

&gt;I am working with a community project to provide a stack

&gt; candidates for the Operating Systems.
&gt;
&gt; The computers are generally running Intel 200 MMX CPU
&gt; with 64 M RAM and a 4 G drive.
&gt;
&gt; At present with a default workstation install the
&gt; machines run "slower than a wet week". It seems to take
&gt; ages to bring up StarOffice 5.2 and then do any real
&gt; work.
&gt;
&gt; Even with StarOffice 6 beta and OpenOffice 638C the
&gt; machine seems to be slow. 
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody got some ideas on tweaking the system to
&gt; come up with significant speed improvements without
&gt; resorting to RAM upgrades and other paths.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,  Ian
