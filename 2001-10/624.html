Hi all...

This almost deserves an [OT], but I decided it doesn't...

I'm just wondering what people think is the best way of providing
remote monitoring of networked services... I'm planning to use
Netsaint on a central machine, and have it SMS relevant people (ie me)
when something bad happens... So I'm wondering if there are any
particularly cheap ways of getting SMS services... Of course, I could
use any one of a number of email-SMS gateways, but I'd rather not,
because then I wouldn't know about a network outage until it was
fixed, and that really defeats the point...

So, the core of the question: What's the cheapest way to get access to
a mobile network for SMS only? This would require a cheap phone
(perhaps second hand, but preferably new, to get warantees etc), or
some other (?) device, as well as a plan of some description (or a "no
plan"...) ...

As an extension of that idea, if you wanted to monitor many remote
sites in this manner, you'd want a number of phones... However, given
that these phones would never be used to dial in to, they could share
the number and account (which could mean that you wouldn't need to
have more than one plan (or "no plan") ...)

Hmm.. there's a number of ways of extending this idea... (eg PCI GSM
cards, if they exist... some sort of programmable GMS SMS device, so
it could make an emergency SMS if the attached server died... perhaps
a GSM/POTS device even, in case the GSM service dies... this may be
taking it a bit far though...)

Also, maybe it would be more sensible to use POTS to dial up to a
central server and trigger an SMS from there... Hmm... I'd rather not
do that though...

Any comments?
