&gt; What are opinions on rebooting a 'generic' server (say file and print, or

sounds a little unneccesary...

&gt; 
&gt; I know the question is very generalize, but the scope of its application
&gt; and usage is also general.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it good practice and a necesary 'evil' to keep a box (and potential
&gt; memory leaks and so on) available? Or is it a lazy alternative to creating
&gt; a stable and well spec'ed setup?

I'd say that it's a last resort...

&gt; 
&gt; What experiences have people had (any OS, any hardware) where it would be
&gt; better to reboot regularly, or leave it running until the next upgrade?

I used to (help) administer a Sun E5000 running Solaris and some
custom (legacy) software. It was required to be available during
certain hours and those hours only. The custom software had memory
leaks-a-go-go, as did some of the related COTS software. On a nightly
basis, the relevant processes were bounced. Not the whole server,
mind, just the offending processes...

&gt; 
&gt; Is it better to have a machine reboot regularly during a quiet period (not
&gt; talking 24/7 access service level here) vs a slow-down and eventual hang
&gt; during working hours (say middle of the day in a finance departemnt just
&gt; before new financial year) due to a problem that built up over several
&gt; months (bad process table etc...)?

well, yes... but it's better still to monitor the problems and at
least narrow it down so you only have to restart one or two
processes... and it's better again if you can solve those problems
(however, as always, it's a trade-off -- if it's just an email server,
and being off-air for 5 mins once a week in the middle of Sunday night
doesn't matter, and it's going to take you weeks of work to find the
problem, then you may settle for a reboot...)

Of course, you have to take into consideration the fact that every
time you reboot, you risk having it not come up at all for some
reason. I know that we used to have problems if we actually powered
our servers down... for some reason, powering down the computer room
often caused a disk failure or a PSU failure... That problem is not
likely for warm booting, but there is still a risk...

&gt; 
&gt; I know there are different requirements for different situations and
&gt; scopes of work, but I am looking for an overall picture.

In general, avoid it -- if you experience problems, try to follow them
up (there is likely a reason for it -- are all your mail messages
really getting through?)... if you have no other resort, reboot away,
but be aware that you introduce a new set of risks...
