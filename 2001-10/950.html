Mark,

To answer all your following arguments, I referr to a company such as red hat. 
Sure they make money, there is no prob with that, but  thier code is released 
as free software under the GPL or respective licences. All thier additions, 
improvements and fixes are available to the community.

Whereas with M$, incorporating the BSD network code into 2000/XP, they didnt 
release any of thier improvements (are they capable of this though?) to the 
community... (sure its not thier licence to do this, but that the whole point 
of my argument)

&gt;  &gt; Likewise, the Apache licence is based on the BSD isnt it...? I see
&gt; this a 
&gt;  &gt; potentially shooting your self in the foot. M$ says, "Damn, IIS
&gt; Sucks
&gt;  &gt; the big one... OK we will just take advantage of this BSD licenced
&gt;  &gt; program, Give it a GUI and call it IIS, and increase our maket
&gt; share".
&gt; 
&gt; And the problem with that would be ... ?

Same as my other arguments... thier refinements and additions are not available 
to the Free Software community.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; Under the BSD licence i see a piece of software, originally based on
&gt;  &gt; a program available with Source under the BSD licence.
&gt;  &gt; SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd takes advantage of this, closes the
&gt;  &gt; source and changes the licence, it is no longer free. I see this
&gt;  &gt; as unacceptable. That code is lost forever.
&gt; 
&gt; How does that happen?  The original BSD-licensed code is still out
&gt; there,
&gt; so you still have access to the code.  The only code you don't have
&gt; access
&gt; to is that code which you never had in the first place, namely the
&gt; modifications carried out by SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd.
&gt; 
&gt; Which code, precisely, is "lost forever"?  And which previously free
&gt; code is "no longer free"?

The original, sure it is still free... Minus the inprovements and refinements. 

&gt; 
&gt; Is there some special reason why SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd should
&gt; lose the freedom to choose whatever license they wish for the extra 
&gt; code which they have written?  Why should they be forced to use the 
&gt; same license as the code they've derived their version from?  Aren't
&gt; you proposing that a developer who contributes to a pre-existing 
&gt; software project should have less rights than a developer who works in
&gt; isolation?  

Umm, no. Each to thier own, I personaly prefer the GPL for these reasons.

&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; When I release some software under the GPL, I dont want someone
&gt; coming
&gt;  &gt; along, taking my code, and closing the source.
&gt; 
&gt; They can't do that.  You're the copyright owner;  You can continue to 
&gt; distribute the source for your own software regardless of whatever
&gt; anyone
&gt; else does.  I don't understand how you arrive at an outcome where the
&gt; source for a previously free project is suddenly closed simply because a
&gt; 
&gt; commercial software developer picks it up.

Not exactly what I ment, but still... They make additions improvements, why 
cant they release the source? Yet again, same arguments.

Have nice day.
