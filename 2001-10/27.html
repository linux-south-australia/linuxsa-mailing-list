&gt; Isn't it really the case that the channel will supply what the customer
&gt; wants, as long as they can make a buck?
&gt;

True.
If a customer wants Linux they shouldn't have any problems getting it,
although the retailer may charge more to cover the extra support
expenses.(just chumming the waters a bit :) - see who bites)

&gt; A good question is: to what extent are the OEMs aware of Linux, and
&gt; aware of its benefits vis a vis MS, Win XP, Office XP, etc?
&gt;

Australian Reseller News has had a few features on Linux in the channel
recently, and obviously the larger distributor like Tech Pacific sell the
shrink-wrapped Linux dists.

A lot of the techs are aware of Linux, and many use it personally. I'm not
sure how many would like to be answering support calls from "Mum & Dad" who
can't get their new soundcard to work.

My own personal view is that, although great gains have been made, Linux is
still not ready for the desktop space. At least not in most homes, where Mum
/ Dad want to use Myob or Quicken, kids want to play the same games as their
friends from school and everyone would like to get access to the internet
using this (shudder) AOL cd they got in the post.

The server & embeded spaces are another thing entirely, and OEMs &
integrators are very aware of Linux in this space. Linux seems to be popping
up frequntly in this area, and a number of detailed TCO comparisons have
been published that greatly favour it. The number of CodeRed type worms
appearing due to IIS problems is certainly helping here.

Brett Northcott
