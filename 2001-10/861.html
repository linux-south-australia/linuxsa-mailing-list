Dear Asia Online Dial customer

Please be advised that as of 8 November 2001 Asia Online will no longer
offer Dial Internet services in Australia as the Asia Online group of companies in
Australia is now in Voluntary Administration.  This means you will no longer be
able to log on to the Internet or send and receive email with your Asia
Online Dial account.

However, we are delighted to announce that OzEmail Internet, one of
Australia?s oldest national ISPs, has agreed to offer continuity of your Asia Online
email service and Internet connection. When you register with OzEmail:

OzEmail will forward mail from your Asia Online email address so you
can continue to receive mail from your Asia Online address at your new
OzEmail address. Please note this also includes accounts with the domain names
listed at the bottom of this email**.
OzEmail will waive the standard $20 registration fee when you join.  OzEmail will
credit your new OzEmail account with prepayment to Asia Online in excess of 30 days.
Prepayment of less than 30 days will not be credited.
