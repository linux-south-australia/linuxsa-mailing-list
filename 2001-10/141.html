&gt;&gt; Well, I haven't had any :-) But there was a problem reported with the
&gt;&gt; 686B recently, and a patch to the FreeBSD IDE driver has been released
&gt;&gt; as a result.  It seems that there were data integrity problems running
&gt;&gt; both more than one IDE controller at a time.  I'm hazy on details, but
&gt;&gt; the indication was that the bug was generally fixed in the BIOS.  I
&gt;&gt; have a box here, and I'm going to try to reproduce the problem in my
&gt;&gt; copious spare time, and to confirm that the patch fixes it.
&gt;
&gt; Is the patch in -STABLE? When was the patch released? Can you point me
&gt; to any material that might explain the symptoms more clearly?

Here's the commit log.  It applies  to -CURRENT.  Typically these
things get MFCd in one to two weeks.

  Log:
  Add a fix for the VIA82C686B data corruption bug.
  This fixed the problem on the 3 platforms I've been able to test on.
  
  I'm still of the oppinion that the BIOS should take care of this,
  however some board makers only apply this when they spot a
  SBLive! soundcard, but the problem exists even without a SBLive!.
  
  This fix should probably go somewhere else, but for now I'll
  keep it here since we havn't got a central place to put
  such things.
