Toby,

Thanks...  I didn't read the IPTables man page, but the IPTables HOWTO was
most helpful.  However, it wasn't clear on was what would happen to the
packet after it was logged (ie. whether it would continue to work its way
through the chains, or whether it would be dropped at that point, etc). 

My current chains look something like...

default to DROP
&lt;rules to accept traffic on certain ports&gt;
&lt;assume everything reaching this point will be dropped&gt;

Jim.

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I've been playing with IPTables on our ISDN gateway machine, and have set
up
&gt; a policy that will allow packets only to selected ports of machines on our
&gt; local network, and drop everything else.  What I'd like to know is, is
there
&gt; any way to find out what has been dropped?

&gt; Jim.

You mean something like the 'log' feature, or didn't you get that far down
the man page?


&lt;/flame&gt;


Generally you want a setup like:

default: DROP
&lt;rules to allow what you want here&gt;
&lt;rule to log anything that reaches this point&gt;
&lt;rule to drop everything else&gt;


You may also want to do something like

default: DROP
&lt;rules to allow what you want here&gt;
&lt;rule to log anything that reaches this point, but rate limited&gt;
&lt;rule to reject anything here, but rate limited&gt;
&lt;rule to drop anything that reaches this point&gt;

this way you won't fill your logs if someone is flooding you with rejected
packets.
this way you will send an ICMP unreachable (or whatever you set) message in
reply, which is polite but generally ppl don't care about that these days,
but rate limit it so you can't be used to flood other ppl if your rejected
packets were from a spoofed source address.


Ideally, you should try and jump out of the main input table for things you
accept as early as possible, if you want to do accounting or other stuff..
this saves processor power if you're doing a lot of work.. probably not an
issue on ISDN though.
