Mandrake 8.1 is running with DevFS

DevFS is cool.. its the "new" way to handle /dev/ entries.

When you load a driver for something, the appropriate /dev/ entries are
created. When that driver is removed, the entries disappear.

You could previously access your LS-120 on /dev/hdb, which was the old dev
entry for 'entire disk on the primary slave'

IDE devices can now be found under /dev/ide/

Since you are trying to mount a LS-120, I suspect there are two ways to
access it.
One, will be via a specific /dev/ls120-specific-name and the other would
probably be via a /dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/ kind of location.

Give that a whirl perhaps?

&gt; First, a little plug - I rang Linux Systems Labs in Melbourne about
&gt; lunch time on Monday and ordered a 4-CD set of Mandrake 8.1 for
&gt; delivery by post in Adelaide.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find
&gt; it on my front doorstep when I got up at 8am on Wednesday.
&gt;
&gt; Now for my problem.  Installation went without a hitch as far as I
&gt; could tell and I spent an hour or so playing around before settling
&gt; down to restore my home directory from a tar backup on floppy disc.
&gt; Here the trouble started - I could not mount the floppy drive.  I
&gt; tried to mount it via the icon on the desktop and with the mount
&gt; command from a terminal (mount -t auto /dev/hdb /mnt/floppy),
&gt; with the same message both times:
&gt; 	Could not mount device.
&gt; 	The reported error was:
&gt; 	mount: special device /dev/hdb does not exist.
&gt;
&gt; I looked through various files in the /var/log directory and have
&gt; appended parts of what might be relevant below.  Can somebody please
&gt; point me in the right direction to fix this (for the time being, I
&gt; have re-installed Mandrake 8.0).
