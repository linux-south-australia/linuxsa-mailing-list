Hello all,

The saga continues but not along RedHat lines.  I've now tried Mandrake to
get over this VIA chipset problem.  Both 8.1 & 8.0.

Firstly Mandrake 8.1 Installation went according to expectations and
everything
seemed to be in order until I tried to boot into it from my boot disk
floppy.  The machine accessed the disk & then spat out the message: "Could
not find ramdisk image: initrd.img".  Mmmm, not encouraging.  Reinstallation
of the
entire package saw the same result when it came to trying to boot up from
the floppy.

So next I tried the earlier version, Mandrake 8.0.  Installation again went
according to expectations.
And boot disk succeeded in booting it!  Mystery upon mystery.  Perhaps my
installation bomb-out with RedHat7.1 is not purely a kernel-related issue,
since if RH uses kernel 2.4.2 & if Mandrake 8.0 uses 2.4.3, discussion
within
the group suggests that the VIA chipset bug was not accomodated until
later kernel versions.

Has anybody had trouble getting a working boot floppy for 8.1 (as
described above) ? Does anybody know a simple solution to what seems to be a
simple problem ?  Note: I am restricted to running linux on drive "hdb" and
can't touch the boot sector on drive "hda" for a direct boot.

Cheers,

Andrew L.

PS.

&gt; One curious little thing that I noticed is that your name in the "From:"
&gt; header is "Peter Lord", but you sign as "Andrew L". Why is that?

I spend some of my time operating from Dad's computer and he generously lets
me use his e-mail account while I'm here.
