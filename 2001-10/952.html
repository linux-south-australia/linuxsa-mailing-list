Indeed :-)


&gt; Likewise, the Apache licence is based on the BSD isnt it...? I see this a 
&gt; potentially shooting your self in the foot. M$ says, "Damn, IIS Sucks the big 
&gt; one... OK we will just take advantage of this BSD licenced program, Give it a 
&gt; GUI and call it IIS, and increase our maket share".

If that happened, the entire IIS-using world would know about it. The
Apache license has specific clauses in it that'd force Microsoft (or any
other person/organisation) to ``...include the following acknowledgment:
"This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</A>).''

I'm sure Microsoft would stretch the terms of (3) as much as they could,
taking full advantage of the text after "Alternatively".

&gt; Under the BSD licence i see a piece of software, originally based on a program 
&gt; available with Source under the BSD licence. SuperRichMegaSoftware Pty Ltd 
&gt; takes advantage of this, closes the source and changes the licence, it is no 
&gt; longer free. I see this as unacceptable. That code is lost forever.

Well, no. The code isn't "lost forever". The modifications made by
"SuperRichMegaSoftwre Pty Ltd" would be lost. In any case, if I was in
that situation, I'd be inclined to go and implement their changes into
my own, completely free code.

Don't forget, the BSD license contains a clause that requries you to
incorporate the copyright messages that you, the original author, put
into the code.

&gt; "The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
&gt; freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
&gt; License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
&gt; software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
&gt; General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
&gt; Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
&gt; using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
&gt; the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
&gt; your programs, too."

But the GPL prevents people from making money from it and closing the
code. That's a good thing some times, particuarly when you need to make
money to live :-)

&gt; When I release some software under the GPL, I dont want someone coming along, 
&gt; taking my code, and closing the source. Thanks to the GPL it (hopefully) wont.

May I ask why you feel that way? Is it just because "Linux is good,
M'kay" (ie, I feel that way because thats what everyone else does). I'd
be getting a nice, fuzzy feeling inside knowing that someone else is
using the stuff that I wrote.

I get the feeling that GPL is a bit of a half-arsed license. I suppose
the "Free as in speech, not beer" bit disclaims them there, but its
still a bit of a little-kid type of attitude. "If I can't have the
changes, you can't use it". Something like that anyway :-)

&gt; Anyway, I think I listed to RMS too much...
