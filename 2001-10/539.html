&gt; Greg and Ian!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Have you tried FreeBSD?
&gt;
&gt; Yes :-)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some people claim that it runs a whole lot faster.  If you install
&gt;&gt; the same packages, the end user won't know the difference.
&gt;
&gt; I'm not so certain about this, but I'm not as good at tweaking FreeBSD
&gt; as I am Linux. I think that Ian's managed to convince the powers that be
&gt; that Linux is good and he might have other reasons (read: political) for
&gt; not attempting to reconvince people about FreeBSD.

I'm not trying to convert people here.  I was just making a
suggestion.  For interest's sake, it might be worth trying anyway.

As for getting permission: consider a report to the Powers That Be:
"Which version of Linux?  Well, we started with Red Hat, but we had
difficulties.  Then we tried Debian, but we didn't like that much.
Finally we tried FreeBSD, and we found that it was pretty good". :-)

&gt;&gt; I've found pretty much the opposite.  In any case, it's a 4 GB drive,
&gt;&gt; so that shouldn't be the issue.  The amount of stuff on the disk is
&gt;&gt; only marginally related to performance.
&gt;
&gt; Unless you start to fill a partition up...I understand that ext2's
&gt; allocation algorithms start to be defeated (excuse grammar) at about
&gt; above about 95% full.

Right, that happens with UFS as well.  That's why I pointed to the 4GB
drive, which is an order of magnitude larger than a typical install.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Make sure that there's at least 128Mb or swap
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;
&gt; Two reasons.
&gt;
&gt; Everyone seems to agree that it's the right amount

Well, no, we have endless debates on the size of swap.

&gt; [side note: I think the FreeBSD VM is optimised for at least 2 times
&gt; physical memory].

No, that's not correct.

&gt; And if you've got 64Mb of physical memory, these days it's not much.

I'm not objecting to the size (except it might be a little small).
But there are too many blanket statements in this area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Try rebuilding the kernel and throwing as much as you can out of it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'd be interested to see if that makes a significant difference.  You
&gt;&gt; might save a few 100 kB like that; how much difference will that make?
&gt;
&gt; You might actually lose memory, however if you fiddle with the
&gt; optimisation options (eg, send them to -O3) and the architecture options
&gt; (-march and -mcpu) and the alignment options (-malign-loops et al) and
&gt; other optimisation options it is possible to get your kernel to go
&gt; significantly faster.
&gt;
&gt; In my opinion, unless you're dealing with embedded Linux, it's best to
&gt; optimise the kernel for speed rather than size.

Sure, but again, you need details.
