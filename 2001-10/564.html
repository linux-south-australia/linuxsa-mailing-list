Ian,

Like the other people on this forum have said, in your case the sluggish
performance is most likely due to 64Mb of RAM being insufficient to run KDE
or GNOME and StarOffice/OpenOffice, without swapping to disk.

StarOffice has always been a slug. I was hoping that would be improved in
6.0 beta but from the reviews, it doesn't looks like it has. KDE 2.2.1 is
noticeably faster than KDE 2.0. From the news, it seems that Mandrake are
planning to use objlink in KDE for Mandrake 8.2 - this should speed up
loading too.

In this case, running hdparm and getting DMA going on your hard drive should
help. From what I can recall Red Hat 7.1 doesn't enable DMA from a default
install, but Mandrake 8.0 and 8.1 do.

Try tweaking your harddrive performance using hdparm (particularly with DMA
on, if not already). Switching off unneeded services might help too, but I
doubt that is going to make a huge difference since the machine isn't a
server anyway.

As for kernel compilation, I believe the only reason why people do it is to
keep up to date with new hardware and software support. I don't think its
really necessary for office use. The performance gain for regular use would
be minimal if at all present.

There MAY be one other reason to do a Linux kernel recompilation against a
particular CPU type, and that is to gain any performance advantages in
gaming performance. I haven't seen any benchmarks on this, but if you could
EVEN gain 5%+ - for a ultra performance hungry Quake 3 player - that would
be worth it. Gamers are known to go to extraordinary lengths to get more
FPS - that's why I overclock CPUs and videoboards to the limit.

Perhaps I'm getting off the rails here, but I would sure like to see more
Linux gamers. Servers and admin stuff are true and good, but really, if
Linux doesn't hit the home user and gaming enthusiast crowd it'll never
really go "mainstream".

Goodluck,

Joseph Tan

&gt; Even if its compiled on a 686 machine I don't think there
&gt; is a significant improvement in perofrmance over the 586 kernel
&gt; shipped withMandrake.

Have you noticed any improvement? Any ideas on getting more performance
out of your machines?

I am running a 200 MMX CPU with 64 meg RAM. USing Mandrake 8.1 or Red
Hat 7.1 as Operating System.

Cheers,  Ian
