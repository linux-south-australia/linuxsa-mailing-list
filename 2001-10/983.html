&gt;&lt;flamebait&gt;

Hope you have your fire-proof suit on, I wasn't going to take the
bait, but anyway, ;o)

&gt;Cmon, Office and IE DOMINATE. They are truly good programs. 
&gt;No Office program or text editor comes _close_ to Office running on win

No other Office program comes closer to emptying your corporate bank
balance than Office running on Windows.  And I ask, for what extra
feature(s)
is it worth paying this cost?
Of course, thats if cost matters at all to your organisation.  It's quite
amazing that even a staunch MS customer like the the health department have 
been making noises about the ridiculous cost to an organisation whose core
business is -not- information technology, its a means to an end for us, not
the end.  Just in case MS didn't notice, we're about providing better health

care to SA citizens, not wasting millions of dollars just for the
"privilege"
of running their software on our PCs. 

&gt;No other browser comes _close_ to IE running on win (forget the mac
&gt;version)

I'd almost agree here, as a user of both IE & konqueror mainly, i find IE 
to be superior in such things as java support, animation support etc.
However I think you'll find that a lot of its "superiority" stems from
sites that aren't written to support any other browser out there, so what do
you expect!

&gt;[for whatever reason they are far superior, doesn't matter if it is all
&gt;built
&gt;into the os, these are the 2 programs that most ppl use]
&gt;If you believe otherwise you're telling yourself lies!

I don't believe otherwise, however I do believe that there are more
cost-effective options out there than MS Office running on Windows.  
Just because a product is used by a majority doesn't mean it is technically
superior. If you believe otherwise you're telling yourself lies!
