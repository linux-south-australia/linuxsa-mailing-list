HI David

Your absolutely correct, that what I was saying. I do not see any why of in
proving the performance.

The extra IDE performance did not help the load time.

&gt; Mike!
&gt;
&gt; &gt; the lights on memory windows manager around. I also twitched the IDE but
&gt; &gt; there was not much to gain there when from 2.5Mb/sec to 5Mb/sec.
&gt;
&gt; It's only a 100% improvement...
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The slow loading time is just a factor of the amount of data to load and
the
&gt; &gt; processor speed.
&gt;
&gt; I think I've heard it said that OpenOffice and Mozilla suffer at startup
&gt; partly because they're written in C++ (and setting up all the virtual
&gt; tables to support C++ objects takes a lot of time). What's it like when
&gt; it's actually running?
&gt;
&gt; Mind you, if OpenOffice were the tortoise and Microsoft Office were the
&gt; hare we'd have to rewrite Aesop's fable.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; This leaves very little left for using the software and an interface
which
&gt; &gt; leave a little bit to be desired for a windows user.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; There is just no way of making this work any faster, at least that I
could
&gt; &gt; see.
&gt;
&gt; There is a limit to what we can do with the resources that we have. It's
&gt; simply not possible to achieve Gnome/KDE/Aqua/Windows GUI functionality
&gt; without using a huge amount of system resources (caveat: at least in the
&gt; current versions).
&gt;
&gt; [ Aqua is what I call the GUI Mac Os X interface; it's quite good but
&gt; one button mice always confuse me ]
