There are some good reasons why commercial places are loath to release Linux
versions.

1) Linux interfaces (as in function calls, headers, etc, not the GUI
   interfaces) change more often than you change socks. You can spend a long
   time developing something to work on, say, kernel 2.4.5, and then
   you release it and everyone complains it doesn't compile for 2.4.7 with a
   new file attachment method.
   By the time you update it to work, 2.4.10 is out and all your
   optimisations have been invalidated due to a completely revised VM
   system.

2) Linux users don't want to pay for anything.
   Linux distros are essentially free. So is practically all the software.
   Linux has a history of being used on hand-me-down boxes.. Like, you have
   a big PC which runs windows + games, etc. and then the older machine you
   just replaced has Linux on it.
   (I know I started that way, although now the most powerful machine in the
   host is the linux server.. but it wasn't always that way)
   The companies that have ported stuff to Linux and tried to sell it
   commercially have largely flopped, I believe? Is Loki bankrupt yet?

So, Linux needs to get cutting-edge drivers, so that those performance
gamers can actually USE their latest whizz-bang video/sound/etc cards.

Look at video cards and sound-cards.
Nvidia, who have a reasonable amount of linux support, still took ages
before their drivers for Linux were anywhere near as good as the Windows
ones -- and they're still severely lacking in comparative features.

Soundcards? I asked about 2D (4-speaker) soundcards here before, and then
went and hunted down reviews n stuff. I found that most cards aren't
supported under Linux, and when they are, its only in stereo, often with
severe glitches, and so on. I'm buying a Soundblaster Audigy card, and it
doesn't even work under linux at all. (but the sblive seems to have good
support, even if its just stereo, so hopefully support will come soon for
the slightly newer chipset)
Then, on top of those problems, there isn't even any kind of standard
interface.. Creative and Loki were working on OpenAL (like opengl only for
sound, supporting mixing, 3d extensions, etc), however Loki went bust and
Creative ditched their OpenSource efforts.


So yeah.. ummmmm...
&lt;/rant&gt;

I'd really like to see some good games on Linux, because I prefer to use
Linux, and the networking/stability/speed/VM efficiency/programming
model/etc appeals to me.. I remember when glquake was out and also for
linux, I found that the linux version worked in network play for me, and the
dos/windows one never seemed to go properly. That, and the fact I could run
4 doom's in 4 windows and network them to each other, sold me on Linux.
(its just like dos, only with a decent CLI and multi-tasking. woo!)


hehe anyway, now back to work.

&gt; Linux gamers. Servers and admin stuff are true and good, but really, if
&gt; Linux doesn't hit the home user and gaming enthusiast crowd it'll never
&gt; really go "mainstream".
