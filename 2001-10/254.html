&gt; I've been reading the Mandrake Forum regarding Mandrake 8.1 and most
&gt; people are not happy with it?
&gt; My own impression is similiar, i have 2 reasonably new computers and
&gt; ran Mandrake 8 on the main one and Suse 7.1 on the other. Everything
&gt; was great and internet connection sharing worked well. I decided to
&gt; install 8.1 on both computers because i was so impressed with 8.0.
&gt; The install on my main computer was a disaster and i quickly went back
&gt; to Mandrake 8 which is the best distro around, but amazingly Mandrake
&gt; 8.1 installed on my second computer with ease but after using it i
&gt; still think Mandrake 8  is much more stable and won't bother upgrading
&gt; until something better than Mandrake 8  comes out.

I start to get worried when a distribution becomes "unstable". It's a
bit of an ambiguous term really. It could mean that the kernel they've
used is crap, or perhaps it's the software they've included.

It's astonishingly bad (IMO) when a distribution is producing
instability. Perhaps it's just your experience.

Then again, it'd not surprise me. Linux distributions these days (bar a
few) are driven so much by the commercial marketing world that they're
forgetting about producing decent software. RedHat's an example.

[ PS: Perhaps I've missed something, but I fail to see what's so
  difficult about sending email in plain text. The garbage that you send
  us is difficult to read and quote.

  It's laid out quite clearly on the LinuxSA website (which also
  contains a link to a site which explains how to disable the evil piece
  of shit.

  So, please, use that brain of yours and turn off HTML mail. ]
