Joeseph sent this to me via webmail and forgot linuxsa so asked me to
forward it on....

Also see my thoughts at the bottom.

------------

Well after spending the weekend with it, I give it the thumbs up.

To me the distribution is noticably more polished than 8.0. The updated 
packages are nice, along with KDE 2.2.1 and the 2.4.8-26 kernel.

I'm planning to put it on my desktop gaming rig tonight, but I had no 
problems with my Dell Inspiron 4000 notebook. 3D acceleration on the 
ATI Rage Mobility 128 chipset was availible during installation, which 
is good to know since under 8.0 I had to do some config file editing 
and even then, OpenGL 3D was dodgy.

I good mix of games (if that's important to you). The new ArmageTron 
title probably takes the prize as the best title I've seen in Mandrake 
yet.

I didn't have any problems with sound on my ESS Maestro 3i, been 
playing MP3s and Divx movies during the long weekend.

The default KDE colour scheme as I saw it has not changed. Using KDE 
2.2.1 I installed a seperate Mosfet Liquid theme RPM to give my desktop 
the Aqua-look.

I did notice that root under KDE has a red background which is similar 
to Suse in their 7.1 disribution. It's a gentle reminder to new users 
to avoid logging in and using root as default.

The most annoying thing in my mind is that using my Swann hardware 
PCMCIA for the first time always gives a "port in use" error. To get 
around that I pull the card out and reinsert it and get Mandrake to 
redetect. Then I can dial out.

I use both a Gateway for internet at home and PPP dial up through that 
Swann modem, and the GUI KDE Internet dialer does not work too well for 
me. I now dial up, logging in as root and typing " ifup ppp0 " (thanks 
Tim!). The Internet dialer appears to not assign the PPP's default 
gateway correctly even when it is configured that way.

I haven't had any real show stoppers so far. Looks solid, but like many 
other Mandrake users I was worried about the rather quick RC1 to Final 
period (one weekend!).

Cheers,
Joseph Tan

Subject: Mandrake 8.1

&gt; Hi, for those of you who have it (eg not Toby) whats your 
&gt; impressions of
&gt; mandrake 8.1?
&gt; 
&gt; I cant say i'm too happy with it. A few newer apps (like an evolution
&gt; that works) and a few other things are nice, but I havnt been able to
&gt; get my sound working properly (via) and it was fine under mandrake 8. I have 
&gt; crashed a few of the configuration apps that were stable in 8.0, 
&gt; and I dont like
&gt; their new colour scheme, I think it was a bit of a backward step and
&gt; makes it look dodgyer too. Im running 8.1 at home now and if I can
&gt; get the sound working I'll be happy, but im in no hurry to upgrade 
&gt; this work machine.
