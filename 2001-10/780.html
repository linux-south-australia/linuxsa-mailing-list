&gt; I read on one of the Zd sites that rh 7.2 has an ext3 file system (log

No.

&gt; Does anyone have an opinions on either?

ext3 is a backwards-compatible journalling filesystem which works on one
of my test machines without any problem (which proves nothing :) reiserfs
is a much more ambitious and more mature filesystem in terms of how long
it has been available to general users. ext3 adds journalling to ext2 and
as far as I know not much else. Personally, I find reiserfs more
interesting because of the much larger range of things it might possibly
be useful for one day :-) However right now I don't use reiserfs for
anything that ext3 couldn't do probably as well (with a caveat for it
being still in early testing stages.)

reiserfs is the basis for a company. ext3 is developed in a more
traditional open source way (largely funded by Red Hat.) If you are happy
with ext3's stability, and you don't want the hassle of the one-way
conversion reiserfs requires, use ext3.
