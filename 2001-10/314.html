&gt;&gt; Unfortunately most OS's only 'initialise' hard drives at boot,
&gt;&gt; usually relying on information transferred to them by the bios. If
&gt;&gt; the drive isn't present on boot then the OS won't automatically make
&gt;&gt; the right device entries for it etc.
&gt;
&gt;You could also make the IDE driver a module and reload it.  Ofcourse,
&gt;your root file system (and any other file systems you want while you
&gt;swap) would then have to reside on a device which was not IDE.

That's what I was getting at. After thinking about the recent devfs
discussion, I imagine that hotswap won't be too hard to get going if devices
are named by bus/logical-id/etc.

&gt;&gt; As seen on last week's episode, I use the 3ware IDE controllers in a
&gt;&gt; number of systems, which overcome most of the above problems by

&gt;Sounds interesting.  Where can I get more details or these, where can
&gt;I buy one and how much are they?

<A HREF="http://www.3ware.com">http://www.3ware.com</A>

The distributor in Australia is <A HREF="http://www.servex.com.au/">http://www.servex.com.au/</A>

<A HREF="http://www.linuxplaza.com.au/">http://www.linuxplaza.com.au/</A> has retail pricing on them, but as far as I
can tell they don't actually want to sell anything .. their shopping cart
stopped working a while ago and they don't return calls..

&gt;&gt; This doesn't help much if you want hot-swap for data portability
&gt;&gt; (maybe look at an external USB/IDE casing) but its a definate plus
&gt;&gt; if 100% uptime is your goal. Also, the 3ware cards are EOL'd as of
&gt;&gt; last week, so get one soon if you're interested :)
&gt;
&gt;USB would be good but I think it is going to be too slow for the
&gt;application I want to use it for.
&gt;
&gt;Do you know where I can get the equivalent firewire hardware and if
&gt;Linux supports it (firewire marked experimental in 2.4 kernel)?  I
&gt;know you can firewire hard disks but you are talking about a device
&gt;which costs 2-3 times the equlvalent IDE disk.

Locally Leader can do a firewire/ide case, there's one in the office at work
but I havn't tried it with linux yet. I think it's one suited to a CDROM, so
it can use a disk caddy in it also (to swap drives without dismantling).
