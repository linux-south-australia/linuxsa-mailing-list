Just a tip from one newbie to another, get webmin www.webmin.com it puts a
graphical interface to most things you need to set up .. sendmail  FTP ,
SAMBA etc ...  I was put onto this when i first started mucking about with
linux, and it works from a web page.

Give it a go ..

Seeya

Subject: Getting linux to serve ftp to an iMac


&gt; Firstly, let me congratulate and thank all the organisers for the 'linux
&gt; installfest' last month. I am pleased to tell you that I now have linux
&gt; running and 90% of what I wanted to achieve running.
&gt;
&gt; Now for the 10% !!!
&gt;
&gt; I have an iMac which I would like to connect to the linux box. Even if I
&gt; could do this in a rudimentary way so that I could get files up and down
&gt; this would be helpful, as the old 'sneaker net' has it's limitations. My
&gt; plan is this: to get the linux box to serve ftp, and just use my ftp
client
&gt; on the Mac (Fetch) to ship stuff back and forth. I would then, (buoyed
&gt; along by my success) get telnet to work, then (for didactic purposes!!) a
&gt; Web server (both ways, of course) then I might just us well play with
&gt; AppleTalk...
&gt;
&gt; however -
&gt; It don't work!
&gt;
&gt; I have my iMac connected via an ethernet cross over cable, and I can ping
&gt; the iMac. I believe I have set up ftp right. (bear with me, I am new to
&gt; networking!) I have installed wu-ftpd and xinetd. xinetd is running (as
&gt; reported by ps -A) and ftp is enabled and in the xinetd.conf file. I can
&gt; connect to the ftp server successfully local on the linux box (via ftp)
&gt; however I get a 'connection refused' message when I try on the iMac from
&gt; Fetch. Looking in /var/log/messages tells me that the server never even
&gt; starts - it's as if whatever tells xinetd that there is some activity on
&gt; the ftp port is not working. I've checked /etc/services, and that seems to
&gt; be in order with ftp-data listed against port 20 and ftp on port 21.
&gt;
&gt; Any hints?
&gt;
&gt; regards
&gt;
