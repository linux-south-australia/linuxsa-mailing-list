Hell, for that matter, I've run linux on a 386sx-16 with 2Mb of ram and no
harddrive at all.

Mind you, it didn't actually do all that much, but you had a shell, vi, and
could mount another disk in the other drive and stuff ;)

&gt;
&gt; No.  It'll need a 386.  It doesn't need as much hard disk space as that.
&gt; It also doesn't really need any monitor at all (depending on what you want
&gt; to do with it).  I reckon you could get by with a lot less RAM than that
&gt; too:  If you're looking at a low spec processor you obviously aren't
&gt; the least bit interested in performance, and lowering the amount of memory
&gt; will simply make the thing slower, so if you have cheap and nasty hardware
&gt; you don't really need to beef it up to 32 Mbytes.
&gt;
&gt; As an application example for such a low-spec machine: 386 or 486 with no
&gt; monitor, 8 - 10 Mbytes of RAM, and potentially no hard disk at all would
&gt; make a relatively decent router for a dialup permanent Internet link (peak
&gt; throughput = ~5kbytes/sec:  You could pass that much data on a Vic-20, let
&gt; alone a 386 :-)
&gt;
&gt; Note that if you're building a kernel for a 386 or 486 you might need to
&gt; disable various Pentium-specific options.  Sooner or later a decision will
&gt; no doubt be made to stop supporting those architectures altogether (I mean,
&gt; how much effort should be invested in maintaining compatibility with a
&gt; chip that isn't even manufactured anymore?  Eventually ISA will be in
&gt; the same boat too, and good riddance to it).
