Hi Peter, to enter text mode installation enter "text" from the boot prompt i.e.

boot: text

Noel

P.S maybe set you mailer to send in plain text mode only, a few of the zealots on this list are less than tolerant of rich text
email.



Hi all,

Thankyou for your helpful responses to my question.  It seems the thing to do is to try to install via text install, since a couple
of you suggested to try this, and there's a definite success story.  Never used this approach before though, and the booklet that
accompanied the CDs provides no instruction on it. I'd be grateful if somebody could please steer me in the right direction to doing
text installation ? :)

Additional info requested & curiosities:

Motherboard: GA-686BX (only details visible on the board)
Hard Drive: IBM 30.7 GB DeskStar, 2 months old

I'm not sure if there is a graphics card issue that the install problems could be related to.  I doubt it for the reasons I
mentioned earlier.  ie.  RedHat 6.1 installs without a problem, as does Mandrake 7.1.  Nevertheless here's what happens and what
I've tried:

1. Autodetect for the graphics card selects "S3 ViRGE (generic)" while inspection of the card reveals that the main chip is an "S3
ViRGE / DX".  Nevertheless, selection of the "S3 ViRGE/DX (generic)" option during install produces no improvement of the outcome:
install still crashes randomly.

2.  The graphics card itself also has the text "CE" (I assume this is the brand) and "C325DX Ver 2.0" (I assume this is the model)
printed on it.  The range of options for graphics card presented during install include an option "S3 86C325 ViRGE".  Selection of
this option for graphics card did not improve the outcome unfortunately.
