<H1>[OT] IMAP and laptops</H1>

Hi all,

A tad OT, but not really... I want to move a client of mine from
primarily POP3 mail access to exclusivele IMAP access. However, there
is concern that this will cause problems with speed. Specifically,
when someone has a laptop, and they go away for a while, do things
with their mailbox (perhaps deleting a few messages, moving a few,
writing a few new ones and so on) and then they return and
resynchronise, this has historically taken up to half an hour (even
with smallish (~50Mb) mailboxes)... Personally, I put this down to the
fact that our mail server is massively underspecced at present...

Given that some people are likely to have a few 100Mb of mail, and
there's around 30 people here, half of whom have laptops, is this
likely to be a problem? (client machines are primarily windows, and I
will be speccing up a decently powerful mail/file server shortly,
which will run Linux)...

Also, is it possible for people (using Outlook 2000 in this case, but
with IMAP generally) to have a local copy of their mail folders on
their laptops that is automatically synchronised with the IMAP server
on returning to the office? This would mean they could interact with
their mail whilst away and disconnected...

TIA
