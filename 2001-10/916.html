&gt; The question begs, "Why?". I couldn't stand Solaris on the nice, shiny

uh... there are a multitude of reasons to run Solaris...

1) You have a lot of legacy software that runs on Solaris.
2) You have a need for some of Solaris' enterprise features, like
hot-swap CPUs etc or their disksuite..
3) You know Solaris.
4) Your clients run Solaris.

&gt; new SunBlade I had for a couple of weeks from Sun. I think it's a horrid
&gt; OS. Perhaps I'm just a little too used to FreeBSD/Linux.

No, it is a horrid OS... at least, the standard CDE (Committee
Designed Environment) interface is horrid. Also, it lacks many
features that we Linux/BSD users have become used to... it feels
like it's missing bits... However, it does have great support for some
of Sun's more serious hardware, as well as great software RAID, and
many many other features that don't yet exist, at least not in an
enterprise-ready sense, on Linux.

Of course, Solaris, like Linux, is at it's strongest as a server. Both
work as a Desktop, but in both cases, you need to get used to them.
You can't be used to "Unix", you need to be used to the nuances of the
individual OSes...

&gt; I think the most annoying thing I found was the apparent sluggishness of
&gt; the OS. It was even worse than RedHat Linux!

yeah, it's not the fastest thing around, but it scales well. Note that
it's always a compromise, and Sun has made the compromise in favour of
stability and scalability... however arguable the stability aspect
is...

&gt; I've heard it being refered to as "Slowlaris" on the FreeBSD ISP mailing
&gt; list, which makes sense once I used it.

yep, that's a common name for it. :)

It's a compromise -- you choose the best tool for the job, taking into
account more than just technical factors...
