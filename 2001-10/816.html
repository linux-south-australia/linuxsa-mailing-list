&gt; If you have a system which slows down and eventually hangs during working
&gt; hours, that's indicative of a major and fundamental design fault with
&gt; either the OS or the application you're running.
&gt; 
&gt; You need to ask yourself the question:  "Do I want to remove this problem,
&gt; or do I want to put up with the unreliability and inconvenience of
&gt; regularly rebooting for the rest of the system's life?"

Well, do ya, punk?

No matter what the situation, you need to weigh up the costs of the
alternatives... There will be times when the cost of fixing the
problem is prohibitive and the risk involved in a half-assed reboot
solution is so low that it's just not worth fixing. Yeah, I agree with
Mark in the ideal world, but I'd rather have a mail server that
rebooted once a week than spend a month fixing it... (at least, for my
personal mail server -- if I ran an ISP's mail server, I'd make a
different choice)...

However, I also think that it's a pretty rare situation that you can't
fix such a problem in a reasonable timeframe...

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Perhaps I'm overly idealistic, but I don't believe there /are/ different
&gt; requirements for different situations.  I expect 100% reliability.  The
&gt; only explanation for anything less than 100% reliability is a bug, and
&gt; bugs need to be fixed.

unless the cost of fixing them outweighs the cost of leaving them...
which it usually doesn't, it just sometimes feels like it does at the
beginning...
