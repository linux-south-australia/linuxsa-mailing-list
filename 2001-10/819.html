&gt; Subject: RE: Book-sized PCs
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Has anyone here used the book-sized PCs from MSI and/or
&gt; PC Chips with
&gt; &gt; Linux? eg:
&gt;
&gt; I personally havent, but i'd love to have one sitting next
&gt; to my TV, with a
&gt; nice wireless keyboard with builtin mouse.. Sit on the
&gt; couch surfing the web
&gt; on my TV. Or play nice games or DVD's :)

This is exactly what I do with mine. I found a place that sold them
barebones for &lt;$200. I already had a HD and the CPU+mem(550mhz celery
CPU, 128MB pc-100 RAM) was about another $100. Now I got a web TV on
steroids that plays movies and MP3s through the stereo and surfs the
web for &lt;$300 . I then got my hands on WinTV PVR (usb edition) and can
record TV shows and VHS tapes to it. I'm in the process of digitizing
all my home movies and burning them onto VCDs. Awesome.

The drawbacks to this PC are in expandability and performance. Don't
buy the thing to render images in fotoshop or do mixes in soundforge.
It can only take slower celeron CPUS (heat issues) and has NO PCI
SLOTS AT ALL. This means that the only peripherals it can use are USB
(or parallel but... that's silly).  It makes a great second computer
but not a primary.


OBTW, as far as the topic goes, I was able to run slackware's zipslack
distribution but could not get X working (sounds like a cliche at this
point). I was also able to boot into bootable CD distribution called
Finnix. It runs off of RAM disks and the CD instead of the HD.
