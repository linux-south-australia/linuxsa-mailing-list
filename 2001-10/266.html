Hi Peter

Welcome,

When your installation locks up press Alt F1 and read the text there 
preferably the last few lines and send us a copy of anything there that may 
be of consequence ie error loading, fatal etc. Do the same for the other key 
combinations that David mentioned.

On a side issue if a message is sent in HTML it's not always understood by 
everyones email programs and therefore doesn't get read. HTML email is also 
atleast twice as large as text messages. I'm not sure where in Outlook you 
select plain text for the message type but it is there somewhere.

Good Luck

Robyn

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;
&gt; Thankyou for your responses.  I found the text installation option at
&gt; install (sorry, hadn't noted the option previously) and have tried it
&gt; twice.  For the record, I was instructed to type "text" at installation, to
&gt; do a text installation.
&gt;
&gt; The result: installation locked up and bombed out both times, each time
&gt; very early in the installation (only managed 3 packages at the first
&gt; attempt, before failing).  First attempt was to upgrade 6.1, second attempt
&gt; was a fresh installation of 7.1.  So it looks like text installation may
&gt; not be the go for me.
&gt;
&gt; I then retried installation via the graphic interface.  It did the usual
&gt; thing, this time getting about 120 packages loaded and then locked up.  I
&gt; then tried the Alt+F1, Alt+F2, Alt+F3 & Alt+F4 key-pairs as suggested
&gt; (perhaps I wasn't exactly clear on what to do here ?) and there was no
&gt; response: the install remained locked up and I had to reboot.
&gt;
&gt; Any further suggestions would be most welcome.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
&gt; Andrew
&gt;
&gt; PS.  Toby mentioned bad memory as a possible cause of problems.  The 256M
&gt; is a recent installation.  Nevertheless, I feel that memory may not be the
&gt; issue because there were no problems installing eitherRedHat6.1 or Mandrake
&gt; 7.1 using this memory.  Please feel free to correct me if this is an
&gt; invalid assumption.
