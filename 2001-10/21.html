&gt; OK.  I have checked things out and it would seem the
&gt; shop gave me misleadinginformation.  I found the
&gt; mothboard's box and from that I found info on the web.
&gt;  Turns out the motherboard only supports PC100 and I
&gt; have been running PC133 in it.

Using PC133 ram in a PC100 computer is perfectly OK. Its when you run PC66
ram in a PC100 computer when you have problems! The PC also will give you
some handy beeps (usually one long beep) in the POST test to say that your
ram is stuffed. I presume you havent had such a problem?
Some may beg to differ with me on this one, but i have been told many a time
that it is okay to run PC133 ram in a PC100 PC.

&gt; Given that, what problems could I expect?  The machine
&gt; has been running (with the wrong memory) alright for
&gt; close on a year (24x7).  So if the memory was the
&gt; problem, would you expect it to show up now or
&gt; earlier?

You wouldnt expect any problems from this. I do though, suggest a bios
update (if any), this can eradicate problems with most MB's.

&gt;
&gt; Could this at all be related to the Code Red virus?
&gt; My server has been probed non stop for close on a
&gt; month by it before this problem showed up.  What I
&gt; have read to date suggests that it is not the cause,
&gt; but could the sustained attack have overloaded
&gt; something?

No, this is highly unlikely, as the code red worm only attacks IIS machines.
Unless however redhat has a problem with load bearing, which is also highly
unlikely.
