&gt; Have a look at the module source in the kernel. That'll tell you what
&gt; number you need. However, I think the 10mbit standard doesnt specify
full 
That made me think to look in the kernel log! A dmesg revealed lots of
the following:

ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet

This is even while there doesn't appear to be a problem.
I've looked around and found people suggesting that the ip_conntrack_max
value be boosted, but I'm not using connection tracking anyway and have
only very limited amounts of memory, so does anyone know if you can set
it to 0 to turn it off?

Ooh, the failure messages just started up, so I changed it to zero and
it seems to have stopped it so far. I'll keep you all posted :) It does
explain why it never happens on the weekend. Changing to a night shift
seems like a good idea.

&gt; What happens to the collisions when the packets start getting lost?
&gt; Do they increase as you loose packets or not?
I don't know - I start to panic whenever it starts to happen. I'll check
next time it happens if the conntrack change didn't help. It was about
2-5 per second before.

We did have a hub in between at one stage instead of a crossover and it
didn't help - it wasn't a switch though. Lousy non-switches.

Thanks everyone!
Joel
