&gt; &gt; if you have key staff relying on optus mobiles, you're asking

&gt; &gt; for mobile phones, optus GSM coverage is just useless.  Even
&gt; &gt; vodafone is better.
&gt; 
&gt; Ummm... mine is fine -- the only places that I really have trouble are

I knew someone would say something like that.  And yes you're
right more or less, but I have one of each carrier/system (don't
ask) and there's a very large number of places where the optus one 
doesn't work (even if the phone says it's got signal) and the others 
do.  And it's not just rural or semi-rural areas (where incidentally
telstra CDMA is far in front), in the middle of the city in places
like rundle mall, you ring the optus one and it goes straight to 
voicemail (ie. the phone doesn't ring and shows signal is fine) yet 
the voda/telstra don't.

At home, voda is down to 1 bar signal, optus has 2-3 (closer tower) and 
yet every so often (for no reason I can fathom) the optus signal disappears 
completely.  Same thing the other weekend near Chain-of-Ponds watching
the classic cars go past, no optus, telstra ok (although Cudlee Creek is
a complete "deadspot").  It's not just Adelaide either, Sydney CBD and 
metro area is the same.

Of course if you travel away from a major city it's even worse.  Last
Oct/Nov I travelled 18,000km through SA/WA/NT, my wifes optus phone
stayed in the glovebox the whole time it was so useless, my telstra CDMA one
worked in most towns (and of course the HF radio worked everywhere!).
