&gt; Simon, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
&gt; However, I have already been through hell and high-water with the H.R.
&gt; representatives over it, and in the end I think it's more than my job's
&gt; worth. You should have seen the fuss when I added just two words to the sig.
&gt; Given the current economic climate, no-one really wants to rock the boat too
&gt; hard on minor issues like really lame signatures.

I used to use the departmental (DEH) standard signature, but I would
make up my job... Sometimes it was "Professional Nerd", sometimes
"Trained Rodent", and I'm sure I had a few other common ones...

&gt; I am sure I have read some comments from lawyers on other lists claiming
&gt; that company-policy-signatures are not legally binding, but HR probably
&gt; expends many thousands of dollars a year on creating and updating that
&gt; little disclaimer, so they're not going to just throw it away. Well, not
&gt; unless they can figure out some other way to leech money from companies.

Best I heard was from Glen Turner, saying that sometimes, he had to
disregard official correspondance (eg tenders) sent via email because
they had a disclaimer attached to them.
