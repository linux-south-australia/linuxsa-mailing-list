&gt; "Can't get lilo going? No worries...use X. Oh, your problem was that you
&gt; can't boot the computer using lilo or loadlin. Well, X will work. X is
&gt; windows. It has to work."

I personally cant stand X as a desktop platform.  It just seems most users
find gui's easier then actual text files. *shrugs*  Was just trying to help.
:-)

&gt; just about to tell me that because Windows 2K has a GUI to control
&gt; [insert service, but for argument's sake let's choose IIS] I will

Most people seem to find GUI's easier for some reason or other.  Having a
dropdown combo box with options in it may seem more appealing to some.
Personally, I don't, but this is exactly why server OS's such as Windows 2K
exist.

&gt; Although it is technically possible (using devfs and devfsd and a
&gt; particularly weird mapping) to get a SCSI drive to appear as /dev/hda or
&gt; its partitions as /dev/hda# (where # is a partition number), last time I
&gt; looked SCSI devices appear as /dev/s[cryptic letters after this], not
&gt; /dev/h[cryptic letters after this].

Her original question was:

&gt;&gt; second drive is SCSI (Linux is on the SCSI drive). I'd like to have lilo
&gt;&gt; installed on hda1 but this just gives me a li 01 01 01 etc on the screen
and

I'm aware SCSI devices are /dev/s*.  However, she asked about hda1, so I was
making suggestions based on this.

&gt; hda...nor any of its partitions. Besides which, how can hda1 be the
&gt; first partion on my hard drive which happens to be /dev/hdb?

Sure, but again, I was going by information given to me.

&gt; Given that you'd probably be using the SCSI driver continuously if it is
&gt; the boot device it makes no sense to build it as a kernel module (i.e.
&gt; it's going to be used almost all the time anyway, so why bother about
&gt; unloading and unloading it all the time).

Absolutely.  I didn't suggest _to_ build it as a kernel module, I was simply
pointing out it may have been why loadlin wasn't working.
