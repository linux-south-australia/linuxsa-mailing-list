Hi,

I don't know what is wrong with your specific computer, but I have some
suggestions.
Firstly, if you take the computer to a LinuxSA meeting, I am sure you'll
have a room full of people willing to try and fix it. A few of them are
really quite clueful and would probably be able to solve it accurately.

In the meantime, I can suggest the two reasons I have experienced that have
caused that same problem before.

1) Bad RAM, or &gt;1 GB ram
  * Bad memory will screw things up for you everytime, in wierd ways.
    However, if your system used to be perfectly stable, you can discount
    this. If, on the other hand, you've recently added or changed your
    memory around, then try swapping it out.
  * Too much memory.
    RedhAt 7.1 will not install on a machine with more than
    1Gb of ram, in my experience. Instead, you have to remove the excess
    ram, install, then recompile the kernel (don't use redhat's source!),
    and add the extra RAM back.
    This too-much-ram problem shows up as exactly what you've described
    during install. But, you have only 256 Mb.


2) Corruption on your harddrive
   If your harddrive is silently corrupting itself when written to, perhaps
   because of a faulty IDE chipset, or more likely, a faulty driver for the
   IDE chipset, then you can see the problem you've experienced as well.
   You haven't posted enough information to diagnose this problem.. What
   motherboard and harddrive do you have?
   Most things are supposed quite well under recent linux kernels, but i
   have seen corruption on AMI Megaraid, HP netraid, and i think there were
   bugfixes to a via chipset of some description too. The via chipset bug
   only occured under certain rare circumstances (i run a via chipset of
   the type, and never experienced problems at all).. but perhaps you've
   hit that one?
    All those bugs were fixed later.. Redhat 7.1 uses are rather early
    kernel version, unfortunately.

Hope this helps

Toby

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I'm a relative linux newbie having (what I think are) unusual problems
&gt; installing RedHat 7.1 & wondered if anyone could enlighten me as to the
&gt; likely source of my problems (please see below).  I'll now outline them:
&gt;
&gt; I have been running RedHat 6.1 as well as it can be run and have
&gt; experienced no problems whatsoever with the install of that version;
&gt; aside from any mistakes that I've made, the install has gone perfectly
&gt; each time.
&gt;
&gt; Recently, I purchased RedHat 7.1 (discs with PC User booklet) and have
&gt; had a devil of a time ever since.  The installation procedure goes
&gt; according to plan right up to when about 200-300 packages have been
&gt; installed and then the screen freezes.  By "freezes", I mean that the
&gt; rolling progress bar just halts while part way through loading package.
&gt; This behaviour doesn't seem to be related to any one package, since
&gt; repeated efforts to install usually result in no problems with a package
&gt; that froze during a previous installation attempt, only to have it
&gt; freeze on a later package.  I have repeatedly tried to install 7.1, but
&gt; the screen freezes on a different package every time.
&gt;
&gt; Once the progress bar freezes, I can still use the mouse, but clicking
&gt; on anything with the mouse fails to elicit any response.  The only way
&gt; out is "reboot".
&gt;
&gt; I wondered if the discs may have some fault, so I returned them to the
&gt; vendor and swapped them for another set.  This set behaved in exactly
&gt; the same way.
&gt;
&gt; I then returned those discs and booklet and swapped them for a set
&gt; produced by a different publisher (the recently released "Learning
&gt; LINUX" booklet and 3-CD set.
&gt;
&gt; Alas, the same experience and a lot less hair on my head!
&gt;
&gt; The type of machine I'm running is:
&gt;     PII 233MHz,
&gt;     MAG DJ530 monitor,
&gt;     S3 ViRGE/DX (C325DX) videocard.
&gt;     RAM 256 Meg
&gt;     Space avail for installation: 3.8 GB
&gt;
&gt; I don't believe that the problem is related to the CD drive (although I
&gt; might stand to be coorected on this) because I've tried reinstalling
&gt; RedHat 6.1 again with no problems.  Furthermore, I loaded Mandrake 7.1
&gt; several times since failing to be able to load RedHat 7.1, and the
&gt; Mandrake version was much larger than the portion of RedHat 7.1 that I
&gt; did manage to load, and the installation of Mandrake never failed nor
&gt; stalled.
&gt;
&gt; Has anybody experienced such similar lockup problems during installation
&gt; of RedHat 7.1 ?  If so, I'd be most grateful to know how you overcame
&gt; them ?  Any ideas would be wholeheartedly welcomed.
&gt;
&gt; Thankyou
&gt;
