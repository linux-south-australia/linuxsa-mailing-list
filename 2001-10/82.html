&gt;&gt;Oh how I yearn for the old days, when computers were computers. They 
&gt;&gt;filled whole rooms, and had lots of flashing lights, and you could tell 
&gt;&gt;roughly what a machine was doing by the pattern of lights on the front.
&gt;&gt;
Booo Yah! Amen to that.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;When the job finishes, there is a definite audible difference.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;On some PCs, depending on the sound card and how it is configured, you
&gt;could hear the 'noise' of the PC processing and doing screen redraws,
&gt;compiling, etc...
&gt;Once attuned to that, you could also feel what the machine was up to.

It could also be the type of fan. I remember when i was looking for an 
insane cooler to place on my overclocking experiment there was a review 
of HSF combos, and one [that i did not get] was very interesting in that 
it varied the speed of the fan to keep the CPU at a near constant 
temperature, perhaps Richard has some of these fans in his box.
