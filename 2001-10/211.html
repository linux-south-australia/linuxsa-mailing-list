&gt; "The reason, it seems, is that Microsoft wants to control where
&gt; companies store data. If Microsoft controls the data, it can tap in and
&gt; extract a tariff in the form of a license fee on every single server
&gt; that needs to access a Windows system."

&gt; Is Microsoft trying to kill Linux interoperability?  What do you think?

Yes and No.
No, they are just trying to make more money and be more monopolistic
and Yes, as to be more monopolistic they have to try and rid the industry of
anyone trying to beat them.


I really think if Linux could offer a similar solution to exchange e.g The
diary features, mail, and contacts all stored on the server to also be
accessed by webmail - and to be reasonably easy to setup and administer,
then those people using exchange would not bother with microsoft anymore.

Linux just doesnt seem a viable enough solution yet for most windows
orientated businesses. I wish it was though, as i cringe when i think how
microsoft is trying to take over the industry... It leaves the users with no
control over what they use, and who they use.

Even if a linux distro were to better the windows package, and charge a
quite minimal fee, i think people would go for it. But as i said, it doesnt
seem viable for them. They cant see the light.

Personally, i would love to use linux each and everyday, but for the tasks i
need to do daily, and with minimal fuss, i need windows. (even though i hate
to say it) and this really sucks.

Having linux open source was a great idea, and it has helped it greatly in
its development. On the other hand, having it open source has also hindered
its development in some areas. As those developers who want money for what
they do, would develop for linux, but they dont, as they beleive if they
write code it will be "stolen" by future developers.

All i'm trying to say is that I wish we could all pitch in and make linux a
better desktop "newbie-friendly" operating system, than what microsoft can
offer.

Thanx,
AW.

Please send all flames to /dev/null :)
