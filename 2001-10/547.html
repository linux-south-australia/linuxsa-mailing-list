&gt;
&gt; Not a bad idea. I recall someone doing a talk on installing FreeBSD
&gt; at the AUUG meeting a week or so ago.

Ah, but that was just the base system and X.  He didn't go into the
interesting stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Whilst it takes a long time, I usually prefer to do a custom install and
&gt;&gt;&gt; only install what's necessary. Most distributions have some pre-packaged
&gt;&gt;&gt; install types (eg, server, workstation, etc), but they all usually end up
&gt;&gt;&gt; installing 90% of the CD anyway....
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I've found pretty much the opposite.  In any case, it's a 4 GB drive,
&gt;&gt; so that shouldn't be the issue.  The amount of stuff on the disk is
&gt;&gt; only marginally related to performance.
&gt;
&gt; A 4GB drive will fill up pretty quickly on most users' systems (Windows
&gt; gets around this by requiring a reinstall on a quarterly
&gt; basis). Installing less is probably an advantage.

Yes, if it's in proportion.  I was doubting that the "less" would be
less enough.

&gt; I am interested to hear about your experiences with the whole
&gt; pre-packaged install thing. I'm of the opinion that FreeBSD does
&gt; this well, but I have had problems with some Linux distributions
&gt; (notably RedHat and Mandrake) installing heaps and heaps of stuff
&gt; (only leaving out things that I don't want). A lot of distributions
&gt; tend to start most services they install by default. How many "home
&gt; users" need to run portmap and the NFS server?

More than you think, at least in this forum :-)

You make a good distinction between starting the service and having it
on disk.  The latter is trivial; the former is an important
difference.

Thanks to FreeBSD's particularly rabid Security Officer (Kris
Kennaway;; anybody know him?  He comes from Adelaide), out-of-box
FreeBSD installations are starting fewer and fewer services.  But
they're there if you need them.  By contrast, a server installation of
Red Hat won't include ntpd, nor any of the Berkeley r commands (rsh,
rlogin, etc).  On the other hand, an out-of-box FreeBSD installation
won't install Gnome automatically, though it's relatively easy to go
through the menus and decide which of the "standard" window manglers
you want.

This all has very little to do with the original issue, of course.
It's been suggested to me in private mail that ilox doesn't really
have the option of using FreeBSD, but I think that it would still be
interesting to hear whether an end user would note any difference
between FreeBSD and Linux performance on a machine of this class.  I
heard yesterday that some Linux drivers lock out interrupts for an
extended period of time, much longer than I would expect FreeBSD to do
it, and that maybe this would give the impression of sluggishness.
Again, though, I don't have any direct comparison.
