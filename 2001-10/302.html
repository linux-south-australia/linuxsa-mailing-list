Oh, im having problems with the updater as well. The mandrake site says
that "all bugs have now been fixed" but a quick check of mirror.aarnet
and two of the mandrake listed mirrors shows only 1 update.

Sometimes mandrake update gives me the first time thing, where it lets
me pick a mirror for updates, and whatever one I pick it fails. Then
next time I run it, it has a totally different dialog that has a blank
window and asks what packages I wish to update. I hit next, and it
crashes :(

&gt; There have been a few people knocking mandrake 8.1 without reason on
&gt; this list, so I thought I'd send this email.
&gt; 
&gt; I have started compiling a list of bugs that I have found in mandrake
&gt; 8.1. I only started last night, although I could remember a few I found
&gt; prior, so here goes:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) On my first attempt to upgrade from mandrake 8.0 The installer
&gt; skipped the partitioning section, and clicking on the star on the left
&gt; that should go directly back to that secion didnt work. On a second try
&gt; I did get the partitioning section.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) Sound was screwed - something to do with devfs, fixed by removing the
&gt; /dev/dsp link and replacing it.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) I modified /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 to change the screen res to
&gt; 1280x1024. Following this change after logging in to X, the background
&gt; pic would resize to 1280x1024 as it should, hang there for a second then
&gt; re-size to 1024x768. It still does this and I cant work out why, and it
&gt; looks damn ugly.
&gt; 
&gt; 4) I manually installed grub, although the mandrake boot loader config
&gt; cant work this out and thinks Im still running lilo. If I go to the boot
&gt; loader config screen, and hit cancel, the applet crashes and will not
&gt; run again.
&gt; 
&gt; 5) My desk pager only swaps to the view port to the left or right, not
&gt; up or down. I tryed to change the viewport settings by right clicking on
&gt; the pager and modifying the settings, but I couldnt make it function how
&gt; I liked. Now if I use the gnome config tool for the pager it crashes as
&gt; soon as I change anything. Pager still doesnt function how I like it.
&gt; 
&gt; 6) The system wont shut down properly. I havnt looked in to the cause of
&gt; this. It just hangs on a black screen.
&gt; 
&gt; There have been more things, but I didnt document them. Most bugs seem
&gt; to be related to me changing config files manually, but that is how I
&gt; have always done it and plan to continue doing it, and what ever distro
&gt; I run has to be able to deal with it better than mandrake 8.1. I should
&gt; add that Mandrake 8.0 had none of these problems.
