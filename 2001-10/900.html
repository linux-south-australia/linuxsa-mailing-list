Its all pretty flexible from my experiences. It doesnt matter where
anything is as long as there is some way of running it, and that "it"
can find the next bit of the boot sequence. You can use lilo to get past
the MBR stage, and boot the nt loader, you can put the nt loader in a
file and use lilo to boot it from the file. Since NT is the only bit of
the chain thats picky you need to make sure that that its going to be
happy to find and load/run the main part of the OS. This will depend on
what partition it is on, and if it is an invalid one, and even then you
can still cheat the system with good boot loaders. I know grub can swap
bios drives so that you can have multiple MS OSes that all need the hda1
partition, and it can make them all think they have it after boot. I
belive lilo can probably do this as well, but I have been using grub for
some time because it can handle strangeness better than lilo. At home I
have technically invalid partioning (partition that doesnt end on a
cylender boundry I think) and grub works fine and lilo, well... LILILI
or L0L0L0 I think...

&gt; &gt;&gt; As others have already stated in reply to your original post, LILO
&gt; &gt;&gt; can boot almost every OS without resorting to lengthy workarounds 
&gt; &gt;&gt; as listed in this TR article.  Its unnecessary to have the NT boot
&gt; &gt;&gt; loader in your MBR, unless you really feel the need to.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I wasn't aware that the standard NT loader could be moved to a 
&gt; &gt;different
&gt; &gt;part of the disk. By default it lives at the start of the NT partition
&gt; &gt;(which needs to be active during the NT install, but not 
&gt; &gt;after). It just
&gt; &gt;relies on the standard (read: DOS) MBR.
&gt; 
&gt; Dang!  Got my terminology wrong there, you're right, besides, the MBR 
&gt; wouldn't be large enough to fit the NT boot loader anyway, could be wrong 
&gt; there too, should check the filesize, heh heh ;o)
&gt; 
&gt; (been too long since I went to MCSE school, either that or its because I
&gt; never
&gt; sat the exam for the NT one, only did the course ;o)
