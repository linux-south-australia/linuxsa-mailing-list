He is quite right.

There is a problem with C++ application startup on systems such as Linux
and FreeBSD that are built on the GNU toolchain. The paper
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/~bastian/Export/linking.txt">http://www.suse.de/~bastian/Export/linking.txt</A> talks about the problem and
a specific hack the KDE people did to get around it while waiting for the
linker to improve. I think large C++ programs which do not use the KDE
libraries will still suffer from slow startup because I have not seen
anyone other than KDE with a fix. There is no kinit-type thing with
StarOffice 6.0 beta anyway. I have verified what the paper talks about
enough to satisfy me on Linux at any rate.

But application startup is the least worry in a system with low resources.
If every application took a little longer to start but ran really well I
imagine many users would be pleased. There are much more profitible places
to look first.
