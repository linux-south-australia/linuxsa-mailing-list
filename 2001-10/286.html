&gt; I configured the kernel for modular sound, sb16 and yamaha opl-3, and
&gt; compiled and installed the kernel and modules.  Then I added entries
&gt; to /etc/modules.conf for the sound blaster, pretty much as described
&gt; in Documentation/sound.  I can't currently give you the exact entries,
&gt; so from memory:
&gt; 
&gt;  alias sound-source-0 sb
&gt;  options sb io=0x220 irq=5 mda=1 mda16=3 mpu_io=0x330
&gt;  post-install sb /sbin/modprobe -k opl3
&gt;  options opl3 io=0x388
&gt; 
&gt; On bootup, when rc.sysinit loads mixer settings, the soundcore,
&gt; sound, sb_lib, opl3 and sb modules are all loaded, the card is reset
&gt; (as evidenced by a "clunk" from the speakers), and the kernel displays
&gt; messages indicating no ISA PnP card found, and then found SoundBlaster
&gt; 16 (220) IO=0x220 IRQ=5 DMA=1,3 and then SoundBlaster OPL3 IO=0x388
&gt; IRQ=5 DMA=0,0.
&gt; 
&gt; I was able to get audio from an mpeg video, don't know which player
&gt; I used, but when I boot KDE the machine hangs after loading aRtsd,
&gt; presumably when it's about to play the kde starting sound.

Can you play sound when KDE is not running, eg: No X, or another Window
Manager?

Something like the following in /etc/modules.conf .may. help:
 
alias sound-slot-0 sb

Also, if you can start KDE (eg: maybe unload the sound modules first) then
start the KDE Control Center (I am running 2.1.1) and choose Sound then
Sound Server. You can disable Arts here in the General tab, and under the
Sound I/O tab you can play with its settings, including references to
sound-slot-0. There may be a reference to sound-slot-1 which you can
remove as well.

I disabled Arts on my workstation, it may be a combination of my chipset
or kernel or the sound card (cmpci), but XMMS would stop every now and
then. I chose ESound under XMMS and it works. This is all I use it for.

On another machine I have no problems, it uses a Creative Ensoniq PCI
card. Both machines are using Mandrake Linux 8.0.

I did have MDK8.0 on a P133 machine with a non-pnp SB16 and I do not
recall having any problems. It is currently running RH7.1 now, but I may
be putting MDK8.1 on it in the near future so I will let you know how it
goes. The Soundcanvas MIDI daughter board on the SB16 worked as well.

Dale.
