&gt; &gt; well, it's running on an old SparcStation IPX, with SunOS 5.6, version
&gt; &gt; 11.241 of an IMAP server (goodness knows what it actually is -- it's
&gt; &gt; been there for years and years...)
&gt; 
&gt; The software is one of the key things. Version "11.241" doesn't sound like
&gt; any open source imapd I know of. If you run some known imapd it is much
&gt; easier to work out where the performance problems are.

well, yes... but trust me on this one -- the performance problems are
on many dimensions... the machine is underspecced, the OS is old, the
imapd is probably old and probably uses BSD mailbox format, the
network is slow, etc etc etc. I have little interest in diagnosing the
problems with this system, as there are other reasons why we want to
move to a new server anyway...

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; does anyone have any experience that I can show the client that
&gt; &gt; indicates that IMAP, when running on a decent server, correctly
&gt; &gt; configured, is fast enough to support 30-odd (perhaps up to 100-odd)
&gt; &gt; clients without long delays... ?
&gt; 
&gt; The question is a little strange. Although IMAP is a very verbose and not
&gt; very consistent protocol, still it works perfectly well and you can find
&gt; servers from Microsoft Exchange through to Netscape Mail Server to Courier
&gt; that implement it in real production environments. Suggesting that IMAP
&gt; doesn't work is a bit like questioning whether SMTP works. Of course the
&gt; protocol works, although your implementation might not work.

Well, I'm asking if anyone has implemented it in a similar situation
to that which I wish to implement it in, and if they had any issues...
It seems that there is plenty of evidence that I won't have any
performance issues...

&gt; 
&gt; Versions of this question come up so often I archived a LinuxSA posting
&gt; specially to answer it:
&gt; <A HREF="http://shearer.org/en/tipsandcomments/mailstore.html">http://shearer.org/en/tipsandcomments/mailstore.html</A>

yes, I recall that :)

Thanks ...

&gt; 
&gt; You can use fetchmail to do some crude timing tests independent of your
&gt; MUA, it will only take a few minutes.

hmm... might try that...

thanks!
