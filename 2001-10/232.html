Hi,

I'm a relative linux newbie having (what I think are) unusual problems =
installing RedHat 7.1 & wondered if anyone could enlighten me as to the =
likely source of my problems (please see below).  I'll now outline them:

I have been running RedHat 6.1 as well as it can be run and have =
experienced no problems whatsoever with the install of that version; =
aside from any mistakes that I've made, the install has gone perfectly =
each time. =20

Recently, I purchased RedHat 7.1 (discs with PC User booklet) and have =
had a devil of a time ever since.  The installation procedure goes =
according to plan right up to when about 200-300 packages have been =
installed and then the screen freezes.  By "freezes", I mean that the =
rolling progress bar just halts while part way through loading package. =
This behaviour doesn't seem to be related to any one package, since =
repeated efforts to install usually result in no problems with a package =
that froze during a previous installation attempt, only to have it =
freeze on a later package. =20
I have repeatedly tried to install 7.1, but the screen freezes on a =
different package every time. =20

Once the progress bar freezes, I can still use the mouse, but clicking =
on anything with the mouse fails to elicit any response.  The only way =
out is "reboot".

I wondered if the discs may have some fault, so I returned them to the =
vendor and swapped them for another set.  This set behaved in exactly =
the same way.

I then returned those discs and booklet and swapped them for a set =
produced by a different publisher (the recently released "Learning =
LINUX" booklet and 3-CD set.=20

Alas, the same experience and a lot less hair on my head!

The type of machine I'm running is:=20
    PII 233MHz,=20
    MAG DJ530 monitor,=20
    S3 ViRGE/DX (C325DX) videocard.
    RAM 256 Meg
    Space avail for installation: 3.8 GB

I don't believe that the problem is related to the CD drive (although I =
might stand to be coorected on this) because I've tried reinstalling =
RedHat 6.1 again with no problems.  Furthermore, I loaded Mandrake 7.1 =
several times since failing to be able to load RedHat 7.1, and the =
Mandrake version was much larger than the portion of RedHat 7.1 that I =
did manage to load, and the installation of Mandrake never failed nor =
stalled.

Has anybody experienced such similar lockup problems during installation =
of RedHat 7.1 ?  If so, I'd be most grateful to know how you overcame =
them ?  Any ideas would be wholeheartedly welcomed.

Thankyou

Andrew L.
