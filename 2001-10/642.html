&gt; I'm just wondering what people think is the best way of providing
&gt; remote monitoring of networked services... I'm planning to use
&gt; Netsaint on a central machine, and have it SMS relevant people (ie me)
&gt; when something bad happens... 

This is pretty much what AARNet does.  Netsaint and MRTG are such
a good compbination that we use the extension facilities in ucd-snmp
to provide monitoring for other processes of interest (eg: web site hits).

We do the SMS using an old Nokia mobile phone, a third party data cable
and the Gnokii SMS tool to drive the SMS function on the phone.  The
phone is on a cheap contract that exploits the lots-of-SMS, no outgoing
calls nature of the application.  The contract is not with any of our
upstream capacity providers :-)  We use the Mobile One Cellfinder GSM
antenna mounted on the computer room roof (after checking the lightning
engineering documentation).  Mobile One also sell the necessary
FME&lt;--&gt;propietary-mobile-vendor adapters.

&gt; (perhaps second hand, but preferably new, to get warantees etc)

We found that two second hand phones of the same model
was significantly cheaper.  If you have a "no call, no cost"
plan then you can also have a spare smart card in that phone.
You're much more likely to lose the plugpack than the phone,
so if it's a professional installation replace the plugpack
with a module in the rack's power supply.  You'll then at
least be told of any voltage failures.

&gt; As an extension of that idea, if you wanted to monitor many remote
&gt; sites in this manner, you'd want a number of phones...

We originally thought this, but haven't found that more than
one monitoring box is useful in practice.

What we have found useful at remote sites is dial-up access
to a terminal server, which in turn is connected to the serial
consoles of all equipment.

We've also found that a lot of professional networking gear
has relay alarm contacts.  We can monitor those using an
A/D converter card in the PC, and propogate that back to
Netsaint using SNMP.  This is particularly useful for
power supplies and microwaves, as it removes the "what
actually broke" question when you are looking at a "no
carrier" on an interface.

&gt; Hmm.. there's a number of ways of extending this idea... (eg PCI GSM
&gt; cards, if they exist...

The phone's better off out of the PC's RF environment.  So
an external phone with a long serial cable and short antenna
is the go.

&gt; Also, maybe it would be more sensible to use POTS to dial up to a
&gt; central server and trigger an SMS from there... Hmm... I'd rather not
&gt; do that though...

The problem there is that the data and phone networks are
actually the same underneath.  So you tend to lose both.
The mobile networks tend to be based on micrwave links
and thus have different failure modes.

Best wishes,
Glen
