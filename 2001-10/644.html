&gt; The problem there is that the data and phone networks are
&gt; actually the same underneath.  So you tend to lose both.
&gt; The mobile networks tend to be based on micrwave links
&gt; and thus have different failure modes.

Yesterday's Optus Fibre cut demonstrated that even wireless services are
vulnerable to physical media problems. The Optus Mobile network went
down as a result, and all customers with phone calls on AAPT's network
were disconnected. UUNET/Worldcom also appeared to have some issues, but
they may not have been directly related. 

Phone calls were probably not affected due to a cut in their data path
(as much as the lower-level telco techs wanted to believe that), but due
to billing and call routing systems being controlled out of the eastern
states.

AAPT to their credit had the problem fixed instantly (presumably a
re-routing at a higher level than SDH), Optus Mobile (and hence some
other Mobile providers) were down all afternoon.

Fortunately this all happened in business hours when there were people
to attend to the problem immediately, as an SMS message wouldn't have
gotten through! It also doesn't help if you use Telstra for SMS when
your key staff have Optus mobile phones..
