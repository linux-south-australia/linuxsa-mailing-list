Ian!

&gt;  The computers are generally running Intel 200 MMX CPU
&gt;  with 64 M RAM and a 4 G drive.
&gt; 
&gt;  At present with a default workstation install the
&gt;  machines run "slower than a wet week". It seems to take
&gt;  ages to bring up StarOffice 5.2 and then do any real
&gt;  work.

1) Make sure that there's at least 128Mb or swap
2) Make sure that DMA is turned on for the hard-drives if you are able
to get it to work

(I was working with an 866MHZ PIII, IBM 70G drive without DMA [1] and it
was fantastically slow]

&gt;  Even with StarOffice 6 beta and OpenOffice 638C the
&gt;  machine seems to be slow.

If you are able to, dump KDE and/or GNOME.

The desktops hog way too much memory; use something like fvwm. I know
this runs counter to "easy linux", however even with Linux's efficiency
being "user friendly" takes a huge amount of resources.

&gt;  Has anybody got some ideas on tweaking the system to
&gt;  come up with significant speed improvements without
&gt;  resorting to RAM upgrades and other paths.

Try rebuilding the kernel and throwing as much as you can out of it.
Also, if you're able, take it to Kernel 2.4.10-linus kernel; the VM
(virtual memory management) in &lt;= 2.4.5 is particularly bad and although
it's unlikely to be the sole cause of your problem, given you'd be
running X, Gnome/KDE and Office on 64Mb I wouldn't be surprised if the
VM is being used...
