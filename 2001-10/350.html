A retailer tol me you can do it with special carriers, and this may be
true.

He ahd supplied us a machine with primise ide carriers.

I dont beleive it is 100% safe to do so.


I am quite confident it is very safe to do so with scsi.

I have done abit of testing with this and seen lock ups with ide even in
alledgedly specially designed carrier as well as scsi in defintiely
specially designed acarriers.
In short I dotn trust teh idea that a specially designed carrier cna
prevent lockups, though I do beleive it can probalby protect eth srive
from electrical damage.
I dont know enough about ide to say why I odn think it can be done, but I
do have suspescions.

However if you find out otehrwise, pesase lets us know, at work here we
often have need to nice htoi swappable raid and as you say the privce on
ide is nice.

The scsi carriers we used were from kingston, I think they are
dataexpress de-100s(of soem sort) - you need to buy a daughter card for
them to do the hoitswapping properly, with an adaptec scsi card.
The carriers are the ones that asut adaptec support people recomended, and
they have as far as I am aware worked beutifully.

They are however fairly expesnive, it was about $3000 for the adaptec
card, two acrriers, two daughtercards and two disks.

If you are building a system where you wnat to hot swap, I assume you wnat
to do it with redundacny in mind.

I think you are way better off using something that is known to work and
designed to work if redundacny is your aim.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know about the requirements/capabilities of hot swappable
&gt; IDE drives under Linux (or even FreeBSD)?
&gt; 
&gt; I've heard that the IDE standard does support it but not all hardware
&gt; IDE controllers do.  
&gt; 
&gt; I've done some searching on the web but have been unable to find a
&gt; conclusive answer.  I believe it can be done with SCSI but there is an
&gt; obvious cost advantage with IDE.
&gt;
