&gt;&gt;&gt; OK.  I have checked things out and it would seem the
&gt;&gt;&gt; shop gave me misleadinginformation.  I found the
&gt;&gt;&gt; mothboard's box and from that I found info on the web.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  Turns out the motherboard only supports PC100 and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; have been running PC133 in it.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Using PC133 ram in a PC100 computer is perfectly OK. Its when you
&gt;&gt; run PC66 ram in a PC100 computer when you have problems! The PC
&gt;&gt; also will give you some handy beeps (usually one long beep) in the
&gt;&gt; POST test to say that your ram is stuffed. I presume you havent had
&gt;&gt; such a problem?  Some may beg to differ with me on this one, but i
&gt;&gt; have been told many a time that it is okay to run PC133 ram in a
&gt;&gt; PC100 PC.
&gt;
&gt; I'm sorry but you not correct, the msi super 7 board I had installed in a
&gt; customers server, played up for over 9 month, until one day I was reading
&gt; the board manual and found it said that this board only supported pc66 and
&gt; pc100.
&gt;
&gt; I tested this out by replacing the pc133 with a know working pc133 memory
&gt; chip, the problem still existed, then I put in any old pc100 chip and all
&gt; the problems when away, this was 3 month ago.
&gt;
&gt; There are difference in the specifications between pc133 and pc100 and most
&gt; super 7 board will have a problem.

Do you have details on this?  What you've described could also be
explained by incorrectly set BIOS parameters.

Having said that, there is quite a bit of evidence that it's becoming
increasingly difficult to find well-matched memory.  The German
magazine c't did a comparison a few weeks back and found that a large
proportion of the chips that they bought just didn't perform as
advertised.
