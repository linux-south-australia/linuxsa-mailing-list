Simon, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
However, I have already been through hell and high-water with the H.R.
representatives over it, and in the end I think it's more than my job's
worth. You should have seen the fuss when I added just two words to the sig.
Given the current economic climate, no-one really wants to rock the boat too
hard on minor issues like really lame signatures.

I am sure I have read some comments from lawyers on other lists claiming
that company-policy-signatures are not legally binding, but HR probably
expends many thousands of dollars a year on creating and updating that
little disclaimer, so they're not going to just throw it away. Well, not
unless they can figure out some other way to leech money from companies.

Warning - this opinion is mine, and does not represent my company.
Hell, i've only just got up after spending 4 days in bed with a fever, so it
might not even represent MY opinion ;)

-Toby

&gt; This sort of useless (and on a public mailing list, inappropriate)
&gt; disclaimer underscores just how silly these things are. Since you
&gt; clearly don't want it there, you obviously can't stop it being there
&gt; - which makes it legally unenforceable as you had no say in its
&gt; presence in your email message!
&gt;
&gt; Bloody things - another example of a human (in this case
&gt; 'management')-spread virus based on ignorance and insufficient
&gt; consideration of reality (rant, rant, rant). Tacking fixed rubbish
&gt; like this on the back of everything everyone in a company says just
&gt; solves nothing and wastes precious electrons.
&gt;
&gt; [Anthony, this is absolutely -not- a flame towards you! - its whoever
&gt; started this silly habit, combined with those who copy it at a policy
&gt; level around the world]
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon
&gt;
&gt; p.s. this is what I think about disclaimers:
