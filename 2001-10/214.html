Hmm.. I presume you have the right support compiled into the kernel for your
motherboard's IDE chipset?

Also, could you post this info to the list, from
/proc/ide/ide0/hda
/proc/ide/ide1/hda

This will give us some info on what the kernel has autoconfigured the drive
to. You may need to specify different settings to gain optimal speed.

&gt; Hi all...
&gt;
&gt; I have just installed a new 20Gb seagate IDE HDD into my linux box as hdc.
&gt; The HDD works fine (partitioned and formatted) except for the fact its
&gt; very very slow.
&gt; I also have a 4Gb Quantum in the box (about 3yrs old?) which is
&gt; hda. There are no other HDDs/cdrom drives in the PC.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; As a quick test, i copied /proc/kcore to the seagate which i timed and i
&gt; worked out it was doing around 8Mb/s. The quantum in the same test did
&gt; around 12Mb/s.
&gt; I also tested the new seagate drive in my WinXP box (a sep pc, not dual
&gt; boot), where it flew and had no problems (benched at avg of 25Mb/s
&gt; across the whole drive). So obviously its a linux problem.
&gt;
&gt; The Linux box is on an old Intel LX motherboard (PII), which as far as i
&gt; can see shouldnt be the problem. Im also running the 2.4.9 kernel.
&gt; Im using reiserfs on the new drive, but this also shouldnt be the problem
&gt; as hdparm also shows the quantum is faster (hdparm tests speed of drives
&gt; directly).
&gt; I have played around with hdparm settings, but this also hasnt helped.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;  Mark Williams
