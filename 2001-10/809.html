 &gt; What are opinions on rebooting a 'generic' server (say file and print, or

You must be kidding.

  <A HREF="mailto:newton@olympia">newton@olympia</A>&gt; uptime
  5:10AM  up 853 days, 16:27, 1 user, load averages: 0.04, 0.03, 0.02

 &gt; I know the question is very generalize, but the scope of its application
 &gt; and usage is also general.
 &gt; Is it good practice and a necesary 'evil' to keep a box (and potential
 &gt; memory leaks and so on) available? Or is it a lazy alternative to creating
 &gt; a stable and well spec'ed setup?
 
Definitely not.  If you have an operating system which can't continue
to provide service without being rebooted all the time, then you have an
operating system which is in dire need of replacement.  

Think about it:  Why would you induce instability (i.e., reboot) to
protect yourself against instability (i.e., crashes)?

 &gt; What experiences have people had (any OS, any hardware) where it would be
 &gt; better to reboot regularly, or leave it running until the next upgrade?
 
Definitely leave it running.  If you can't leave it running, upgrade it
straight away.

 &gt; Is it better to have a machine reboot regularly during a quiet period (not
 &gt; talking 24/7 access service level here) vs a slow-down and eventual hang
 &gt; during working hours (say middle of the day in a finance departemnt just
 &gt; before new financial year) due to a problem that built up over several
 &gt; months (bad process table etc...)?

If you have a system which slows down and eventually hangs during working
hours, that's indicative of a major and fundamental design fault with
either the OS or the application you're running.

You need to ask yourself the question:  "Do I want to remove this problem,
or do I want to put up with the unreliability and inconvenience of
regularly rebooting for the rest of the system's life?"

If you choose the latter, you might as well be using Windows for all
the difference it'll make.

 &gt; I know there are different requirements for different situations and
 &gt; scopes of work, but I am looking for an overall picture.

Perhaps I'm overly idealistic, but I don't believe there /are/ different
requirements for different situations.  I expect 100% reliability.  The
only explanation for anything less than 100% reliability is a bug, and
bugs need to be fixed.
