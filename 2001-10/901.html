Hi Ant,
Good question. The cable runs between floors and through a roof cavity,
but doesn't go particularly close to anything remarkable. It's about a
15M cable run - crossovered from one device to the other. The alternate
cable I tried went a different route past some air conditioners.

The time it takes for the problem to surface is random and it's
difficult to reproduce - the only other thing I know that I didn't
mention is that on our router the collisions on the ethernet interface
are about 2.5% of the packets transmitted, whereas on the other router
it's 0.9%. The link is half duplex, 10Mbit. I thought about changing it
to full duplex, but the module parameter to change this requests a value
between 1 and 8 :) Whether or not this is related I'm not sure. I ran a
duplicate setup in a different location with all the same equipment and
it functioned flawlessly for a few days, with much fewer collisions.
With the other cable collisions seemed to happen at the same rate, so I
switched back to the original one as it presented less of a trip-over
risk to everyone.

Thanks,
Joel

Have you checked that the cable run doesnt go too close to anything that
could interfear? Particularly fluro lights? Ive seen stuff similar with
ethernet through the roof that passes the fluros - it could be
enviromental.
