This sort of useless (and on a public mailing list, inappropriate) 
disclaimer underscores just how silly these things are. Since you 
clearly don't want it there, you obviously can't stop it being there 
- which makes it legally unenforceable as you had no say in its 
presence in your email message!

Bloody things - another example of a human (in this case 
'management')-spread virus based on ignorance and insufficient 
consideration of reality (rant, rant, rant). Tacking fixed rubbish 
like this on the back of everything everyone in a company says just 
solves nothing and wastes precious electrons.

[Anthony, this is absolutely -not- a flame towards you! - its whoever 
started this silly habit, combined with those who copy it at a policy 
level around the world]

Cheers,
Simon

p.s. this is what I think about disclaimers:

IMPORTANT: This email is intended for the use of the individual addressee(s)
named above and may contain information that is confidential, privileged or
unsuitable for overly sensitive persons with low self-esteem, no sense of
humour or irrational religious beliefs. If you are not the intended
recipient, any dissemination, distribution or copying of this email is not
authorised (either explicitly or implicitly) and constitutes an irritating
social faux pas.

Unless the word absquatulation has been used in its correct context
somewhere other than in this warning, it does not have any legal or no
grammatical use and may be ignored. No animals were harmed in the
transmission of this email, although the kelpie next door is living on
borrowed time, let me tell you. Those of you with an overwhelming fear of
the unknown will be gratified to learn that there is no hidden message
revealed by reading this warning backwards, so just ignore that Alert Notice
from Microsoft.

However, by pouring a complete circle of salt around yourself and your
computer you can ensure that no harm befalls you and your pets. If you have
received this email in error, please add some nutmeg and egg whites, whisk
and place in a warm oven for 40 minutes.
