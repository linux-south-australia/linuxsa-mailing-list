&gt; &gt; Hi all...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm looking for a hardware SCSI RAID (0/1 or 5) solution for a debian
&gt; &gt; server...  Have been looking at Adaptec 3200s cards, but am interested
&gt; &gt; in what else people are using, specifically if they have been using it
&gt; &gt; with Debian, and what experiences they have had with them.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have used the Adaptec 3200 and the Mylex DAC960. Neither with Debian, 
&gt; but that really should not matter. Linux is what matters.

indeed, this is true, but if Debian supported them out of the
repository, without kernel changes, it makes life easier... :)

&gt; 
&gt; The Adaptec 3200 is supported in 2.4.10! So next round of distro's 
&gt; should support it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; What I really want is one that is supported by the standard kernel
&gt; &gt; with no recompiles needed. Yeah yeah, kernel compiles are easy etc...
&gt; &gt; I can do it, I'd just rather not, all other things being equal...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, as I say above.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, does anyone here have any practial experience with adding
&gt; &gt; capacity to a RAID array? I want to be able to purchase (say) 75Gb of
&gt; &gt; usable space now, and add up to 200Gb more as time goes on... I would
&gt; &gt; assume this is a matter of powering down (or not, if hotswappable
&gt; &gt; drives and enclosures are used...), doing some RAID device
&gt; &gt; configuration (this probably requires powering down), and then using
&gt; &gt; growfs to grow the filesystem onto the new disk(s)... Have I got this
&gt; &gt; approximately right, or am I imagining things? Also, would this be
&gt; &gt; harder/slower/unreliable if one was using RAID 5 (as the striping may
&gt; &gt; change drastically...) as against RAID 0/1 (where, I guess, the
&gt; &gt; striping would change just as drastically, now that I think about
&gt; &gt; it...)
&gt; 
&gt; This is hard. Hardware RAID solutions do not support this, AFAIK. You 
&gt; need LVM for this.

Hmmm.... Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree then... I had hoped to be
able to use striping to get performance, and mirroring to get
redundancy (ie RAID 0/1, or RAID 5 to get both performance and
redundancy), and then be able to add a disk to the array to get more
space as needed...

I had hoped that a harware RAID solution would enable me to add a disk
or two to an existing array, and have it transparently (to the OS)
sort out the disks so the OS effectively saw a larger physical disk,
which I could then grow the filesystem onto using growfs or
somethign... hmmm

maybe I need to research this a little more...

rr

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Also, would people generally recommend putting system software off the
&gt; &gt; RAID somewhere (perhaps an IDE disk) and just data on the RAID so that
&gt; &gt; in the case of a RAID disaster, one can still boot and function as
&gt; &gt; expected, and can even unmount and work on the RAID while the system
&gt; &gt; is up...?
