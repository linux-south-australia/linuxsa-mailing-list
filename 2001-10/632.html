Benjamin,

Actually I shouldn't have mentioned Mozilla in that email.

Yeah I've tried Opera before - it's certainly quick and feature rich, but I
get drawn more strongly toward's Mozilla's standards compliance (which is
better than Opera from the reviews), its aesthetics,  and its GPL nature.

Have you tried version 0.9.4? I have been using Mozilla as my default
browser in both WIndows 2000 and Linux for 2 months now and the latest
stable builds have been great. You could say that I am a very heavy web
user. I get around the same MTTF for both Mozilla 0.9.4/Mandrake 8.1, and IE
5.5 under Windows - generally this is a good thing.

Had to install seperate RealPlayer, Flash/Shockwave plugins though. One
thing I haven't gotten to work: I can't get the Java VM to work though,
Sun's Netscape 6 plugin bombs upon loading.

Mozilla's speed have been improving over the past few months, but it is
slighly sluggish on my machine compared to IE 5.5 under WIndows 2000 - about
on par with Konqueror 2.2.

Mozilla 1.0 final, like Evolution 1.0, and Star Office 6 ARE things I'm
looking forward to.

Cheers,

Joseph Tan

My peronal recomendation is get rid of Mozilla and use opera
(<A HREF="http://www.opera.com">http://www.opera.com</A>)
It doesn't support Java or Flash (sadly) but it in all other aspects it
will give IE a run for it's money. I've been using it for quite a while
and am very impressed.

Cheers,
