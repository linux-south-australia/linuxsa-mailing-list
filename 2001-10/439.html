&gt; How are you doing this? Are you using the HEAD branch of the CVS source
&gt; that allows the use of an LDAP server instead of an smbpasswd file? Or
are
&gt; you using cleartext passwords, pam_ldap and an LDAP server?

We are using Samba v2.2.1a RPM for RH7.1.  We are using cleartext, pam_ldap
etc etc

&gt; Which version of Samba are you using? Have you checked the Samba logs?

Yes, the logs don't really give us much clue:

&gt; You mention that you will have 400 clients to these servers. Is that 400
&gt; concurrent connections? What kind of organisation is it? The reason I
ask,
&gt; is because schools and other organisations that have set timetables will
&gt; often see huge delays and things at say the start of a lesson (when
&gt; everyone is logging on at the same time).
