&gt; Sounds more like a windows networking issue rather than a SAMBA problem,
&gt; check your DNS and WINS settings and see whats up there, if the machine cant
&gt; see itself within its own workgroup, theres definately something up with the
&gt; network settings.  Haven't seen this in win2k much .. but if anyone has done
&gt; any etworking with tcp in Win95, you'll know where I'm coning from.

This error can occur for a number of reasons. 


One is that your WinXXX machine cannot contact the local or domain master browser, 

which usually translates into reachability problems or name translation problems. 


Name translation problems come into the picture because the client does 
a broadcast of a GetBackupList request, and the local master browser 
sends back a list of the NetBIOS names of the backup master browsers. 
The client then has to choose one, and translate that name into an IP 
address.

Assuming that this step works, the client then places a connection on port 

139 to the server it chose, and then sends a NetServerEnum request or something like that.


However, to do that, it has to connect to the IPC$ service, and Samba 
does special things with the IPC$ service to make this work more 
reliably, but only in versions of Samba since about 2.0.6.

So, we really need to know what version of Samba he is using, along with perhaps his smb.conf.
