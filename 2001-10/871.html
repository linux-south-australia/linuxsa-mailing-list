As of yesterday anyone in Britain can ask for a company to hand over 
all personal data they hold about them, paper or electronic, a company 
may ask no more than ten pounds ($15) as a fee and must comply within 
40 days or be liable for a five thousand pound ($7,500) fine for not 
complying with the law. Personal data is any identifiable data about a 
living and identifiable individual. Companies are also required to 
obtain the information fairly, not collect excessive data for the 
declared purpose, not keep it longer than necessary and keep it 
accurate. If the subject asks for it not to be used for marketing 
you're required to comply. The data may also not be sent to countries 
outside Europe unless you're satisfied with that country's security 
arrangements for personal data.

See <A HREF="http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk">http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk</A> for more on the act.

Some key items from the internet guidance paper. Note that profiles 
based on cookies which uniquely identify someone are personal data and 
that placing a cookie on a UK computer can be enough to process data in 
the UK and be subject to the law.

The Data Protection Commissioner "takes the view that in the context of 
the on-line world the information that identifies an individual is that 
which uniquely locates him or her in the world, by distinguishing him 
or her from others. Thus profiles that are based on cookies and that 
are used to deliver targeted marketing messages to particular 
individuals are personal data". That means profiling by ad companies is 
personal data.

Those who use scavenging programs to harvest email addresses are likely 
to breach the act because they are using the data for purposes other 
than that which it was supplied for.

Since web bugs are invisible it is hard to envision how there can be 
informed consent if they are used to collect personal data.

If you obtain the data from a third party the subject still has a right 
to know you have it and what you will use it for.

Asking a child for information about their parents or in general asking 
someone for information about someone else is likely to violate the 
act, because the information isn't being supplied with the knowledge 
and consent of the subject.

Parental consent for collecting data about those 12 and under is likely 
to require postal (physical mail) consent and asking by email is 
unlikely to be sufficient.

The person who controls the data is the responsible person, even if 
another company provides the hosting service.

You can't just change your privacy statement to change how you use the 
data you previously collected because you obtained that data based on 
the original privacy statement and those who provided it under those 
terms must consent to your change in the use of their data.

Does the Act apply if our website is operated outside the UK? If a 
website operator uses equipment in the UK to process personal data, the 
processing will be subject to the act. This might be the case where the 
operator's site is hosted in the UK or where the operator places 
a 'cookie' on the computer of a UK internet user in order to create a 
profile of that individual's online behavior.
