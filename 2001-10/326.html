&gt; I have started compiling a list of bugs that I have found in mandrake
&gt; 8.1. I only started last night, although I could remember a few I found
&gt; prior, so here goes:

Most of the problems (but not the one about partitioning) could be
described as "user configuration faults".  Linux is not for wimps.
Anyone who needs their hand held should be prepared to pay for it
(one way or another.)

Do I think that unix should be "as easy as Windows?"  Hell no, nothing
should be THAT difficult!  Do I think unix should require "zero
administration"?  Hmm, irrelevant because no (real) operating system
today gives that.  Zero administration is a marketing lie.

So does Mandrake suck?  I've not used it, but I've also not heard
anything to convince me that it does.

Now let me talk about RH7.1, which includes linux 2.4.2 PLUS a gaggle
of non-stable patches.  I'd not be surprised to hear of problems with
serial ports not working, or with sound blasters hanging, or with
installation freezing.  I mean, those patches weren't part of the
stable release (when RH took them) so good luck to anyone who relies
on them (which unfortunately, and unbeknownst to them, is everyone
who uses RH7.1.)
