&gt; If I trolled I would have done it in HTML and made a reference to the
&gt; reboot method with something like:
&gt;   'cat "bye bye" | grep -v grep | reboot'
&gt; 
&gt; And then maybe said that NT was cool, or something like that.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with a system with a long and healthy uptime and the least
&gt; interuption to the services it provides.
&gt; I was looking for opinions and experience on the topic, and not just on
&gt; home boxes either.

The general policy within the organisations that I have worked for 
is to not reboot unless you have to. Having said that, you still 
find some experienced (ie. old ;-) sys admins who still think that 
a regular reboot is "good housekeeping". Probably due to bad 
experiences with vendors not releasing patches for known bugs 
quickly enough, so a reboot was the only answer (been there, done
that on several occassions).

In a related topic, some sys admins also swear that you really 
should reboot a system when daylight savings starts/stops just in 
case the system gets confused. Most modern UNIX systems just don't 
need this, but as with the "regular reboot" issue, bad previous 
experiences when it *was* a problem on some systems tends to 
perpetuate the myth.

Just my two knobs worth...
