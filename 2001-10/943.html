&gt; But the developers who wrote that BSD code don't mind.  Isn't that
&gt; what's important?  They're the ones who chose the license, after all.

oh yer, i am not saying that at all, it is a great gift that the bsd 
developers are giving. I just think that it might be a little foolish.
Sure, benevolent, but leaving the gift wide open to abuse is not smart
(i agree tho that it is very noble or whatever.. :)

&gt; 
&gt; Important question:  Do you value the GPL because it delivers software
&gt; freedom, or do you value it because it means free software devlopers
&gt; can write code without being "ripped off"?

i think it is both.

i like free beer, but the 'free speech' part of it really doesn't apply
to many people - most people don't hack the kernel or anything else,
thye
just want a good system, and they want people who are Kernel Hackers to
have the ability to do so (this is my situation - i am not going to
do it, but i want someone else to, to make it better.)


&gt; 
&gt; The reason I ask is because the latter reason suggests that you're in
&gt; favour of free software in the "free beer" sense and don't care much
&gt; about the "free speech" sense, and the former reason suggests the opposite.
&gt; It strikes me that a lot of GPL advocates aren't quiet sure about which
&gt; of those alternatives they really support.

well as i said, i want both. free beer and free speech and i think this 
is what the majority of people would want.
--&gt; they want no cost software
--&gt; they want the ability to modify code OR they want to give other
people
    more capable then themselves the ability to modify code
