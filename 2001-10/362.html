&gt; &gt; &gt; when someone has a laptop, and they go away for a while, do things
&gt; &gt; &gt; with their mailbox (perhaps deleting a few messages, moving a few,
&gt; &gt; &gt; writing a few new ones and so on) and then they return and
&gt; &gt; &gt; resynchronise, this has historically taken up to half an hour (even
&gt; &gt; &gt; with smallish (~50Mb) mailboxes)... Personally, I put this down to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact that our mail server is massively underspecced at present...
&gt; &gt;    :
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; What you didn't say was what IMAP server, nor how it is configured. 
&gt; 
&gt; well, it's running on an old SparcStation IPX, with SunOS 5.6, version
&gt; 11.241 of an IMAP server (goodness knows what it actually is -- it's
&gt; been there for years and years...)

The software is one of the key things. Version "11.241" doesn't sound like
any open source imapd I know of. If you run some known imapd it is much
easier to work out where the performance problems are.

&gt; does anyone have any experience that I can show the client that
&gt; indicates that IMAP, when running on a decent server, correctly
&gt; configured, is fast enough to support 30-odd (perhaps up to 100-odd)
&gt; clients without long delays... ?

The question is a little strange. Although IMAP is a very verbose and not
very consistent protocol, still it works perfectly well and you can find
servers from Microsoft Exchange through to Netscape Mail Server to Courier
that implement it in real production environments. Suggesting that IMAP
doesn't work is a bit like questioning whether SMTP works. Of course the
protocol works, although your implementation might not work.

Versions of this question come up so often I archived a LinuxSA posting
specially to answer it:

You can use fetchmail to do some crude timing tests independent of your
MUA, it will only take a few minutes.
