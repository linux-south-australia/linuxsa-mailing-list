 &gt;  - Intel got out of the 'microprocessor' market and into the real CPU

 &gt;    co-processor, allowing for a seperate chip for this.  The suspicion
 &gt;    being that the 486SX actually had a *disabled* co-processor and was
 &gt;    cheaper than the 486DX for market revenue reasons.

Here's how they did it.

They had a single die for 80486 and 80387 (the math coprocessor), with
the integrated circuits side-by-side.

During post-lithography testing, they'd exercise the CPU and FPU
functionality.  The normal result in any silicon foundry is to have
a relatively high percentage of failures.  Here's how they dealt with
them:

  * On chips where the CPU worked and the FPU failed:
    The FPU was burned off the die with a laser, and the leftovers were
    sold as an 80486SX.

  * On chips where the CPU failed and the FPU worked:
    The CPU was burned off the die with a laser, and the leftovers were
    sold as an 80387 math coprocessor.

  * On chips where both units worked:
    The chip was sold as an 80486DX.

  * On chips where both units failed: 
    The chip was thrown away.

The result was a slightly more expensive production process, but with
an outcome which permitted 50% of failures to be sold instead of 
thrown away.

Once a CPU had been verified to be working, either as a 486SX or 486DX,
it'd go into clock speed tests.  They'd run the CPU at a variety of 
speeds and work out which speed it failed out (chips produced during the
same production run can have different failure speeds/temperatures due
to slight manufacturing defects and tolerances).  So if a 486SX worked
accurately at 33 MHz, it'd be loaded into a box and sold as a 486SX/33.
If the next chip on the production line happened to have a working 
math coprocessor but only worked at 16 MHz, it'd be loaded into a
different box and sold as a 486DX/16.  Again, the goal here was to increase
yield by permitting the manufacturer to sell its failures.

So - If anyone has an old 486SX/16 at home:  Congratulations, you have
a computer which contains the absolute lowest quality standard which
Intel produced :-)
