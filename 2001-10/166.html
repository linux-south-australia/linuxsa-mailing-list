&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't this just come down to load? If you have a system running an
&gt; application/service/process that starts to get cpu-bound, an extra
&gt; processor will relieve the load without requiring a complete new 'extra'
&gt; server.

no.

without special programming, a single process (or thread, actually) is
bound to one CPU.  This is because each thread is just that -- a
single thread of execution, woven through a program's code. It is
defined by the value of certain registers, particularly the Program
Counter, which tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. It is
possible (though non-trivial) to migrate a thread from one CPU to
another, but it's not possible for one thread to execute on two CPUs.

(note that a single process can be multi-threaded -- ie have many
threads of execution within the one logical address space. Also,
threads are sometimes referred to as Lightweight Processes or LWPs, as
they are like a whole new process, except that rather than having
their own protected block of memory, they share it with other LWPs in
the same process... they have different PIDs though... although I
beleive that this depends on implementation)

The way SMP systems work is by sharing the threads around. I'm not
entirely sure if all the threads in one heavyweight process need to be
in the same CPU, but they certainly need a level of cache
synchronisation (it's no good for one thread to modify a variable, and
another to read it but get the old value back simply because the
threads were in different CPUs, and the new value hadn't been
propagated back to main memory yet)... In fact, you have to be very
very careful with this kind of thing, because as soon as you allow a
process to have two threads on two CPUs, you have real multi-tasking,
and you can really end up in trouble with resource contention if you
don't know what you are doing...)

anyway...

the point was that each thread will definitely be constrained to one
CPU, and depending on implementation, each process may also be
constrained, so it's quite possible that you will get exactly zero
benefit from having SMP (for eg on an average compile), while still
paying the price of keeping everything synchronised, just in case
(hence a net loss...). If this is the kind of processing you do
mostly, then a single, faster CPU is better for you.

However, if most of what you do is lots of little jobs, then SMP will
benefit you a lot. For eg, a compile server used by many people will
benefit, as each users' compile will start on the lowest loaded CPU...

I think I could have said this much quicker if I had just said that
the granularity of the parallelism is the process (or thread,
depending on implementation).

&gt; 
&gt; Given that you are flat out buying double the cpu capacity in a single cpu
&gt; across the available cpu's, doubling up on the cpu's is also probably the
&gt; most economical method of increasing the cpu capacity of a system.

Basically, it varies. :)
