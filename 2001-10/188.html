Hi folks,

A I have advised to the list before I will be doing a demo to IT people 
and others in the Dept Human Services this coming Wednesday 10 October. 
The presentation is to show them Linux and Star Office and how it might 
be suitable for the computers that they will be donating to communities 
and people in need.

This could lead to an extra 250 to 350 computer users out there running 
Linux and StarOffice every year.

Because the SA Govt is also running a project to pass older computers 
out to the community and groups in need if they like what they see with 
Linux then we may even see up to 6,000 new Linux computer users a year!

At present they are planning to just load the computers up with Windows 
95. We can do much better for the community by suggesting that the 
machines are loaded up with Linux and StarOffice.

Before that happens I need to be sure I have a couple of really good 
stable machines to demonstrate. My machines are both Intel 200 MMX CPUs 
with 64 Meg RAM. 1 is 4 G, the other 1.2 G. Both have come from the DHS 
so they are the same as could be expected to be donated.

I have Mandrake 8.0 and 8.1 as well as Red Hat 7.1 to put on them. 
Which one depends we edn up using depends upon which OS I can get to 
run the fastest and the most stable. They will also be running 
StarOffice 5.2 and beta6. 

Who out there in the Northern suburbs would like to lend me their 
expertise (which I don't have) to set these machines up and optimise 
them?

I can offer a work room with plenty of power, extra gear and Internet 
near to the centre of Salisbury.

I can be there Saturday or Sunday depending on the offers I get.

The presentation will only be a success if we can make sure that the 
machines are running as best they can be. I can only have them fine 
tuned if people help me. Can you help?

Please call me 0402 282 067 if you are willing to help out.

Oh the mini-Installfest bit? Well I have room for 4 or more machines to 
be running so depending on the number of people who offer to help there 
may be room for others to bring their machines to get help on. I can do 
the basic Linux stuff and others will have more expertise will be there 
too. Saturday and or Sunday. Call me, see what we can work out.


These DHS computers are going to go out into the community and help 
those who need the help the most. 

I am asking the LinuxSA community to join with me to help bring them 
the best community-based operating system and Office Suite that there 
is.

Cheers,  Ian Loxton
