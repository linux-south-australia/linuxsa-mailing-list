&gt; I was wondering if anyone knows how to completely reset ipac data, since its
&gt; all in the db, only daily information is important. I couldnt find any
&gt; information on this in the docs or on the site.

It very much is in the docs and on the site. From
<A HREF="http://www.comlink.apc.org/~moritz/ipac.html">http://www.comlink.apc.org/~moritz/ipac.html</A> :

CLEANING UP

fetchipac generates a single file every time it runs. The more often
fetchipac runs, the more files you get and the more exact will be
your accounting info. For example, if you run fetchipac every five
minutes, ipacsum will be able to display accurate data for every
five minute period.

Every time ipacsum runs, you can let it make a summary file for
all the files read to replace them. This will decrease the needed
disk space and the time ipacsum needs to calculate sums for this
period. You lose accuracy, though, since all data files are
summarized into one, meaning there will be no more information
when exactly the traffic occurred, but only the sum for the whole
period.

In general, it makes sense to periodically summarize the info
for a past period. For example, you could run these cron jobs
cleanups:

 - run fetchipac every 15 minutes
 - every hour, summarize the files of the hour 48 hours ago
 - every day, summarize the files of the day 7 days ago
 - every week, summarize the files of the week 11 weeks ago
 - every year, summarize the files of the year 2 years ago

With this scheme, you can have the data of the ip traffic with
15-minute-accuracy for the past two days. For the last week, you
still can tell at which day the traffic passed your machine. Keeping
the daily files for 14 weeks, you have a daily overview of the last
three months. After that, you keep weekly files only. After two years,
you sum up the data of the year into one file.

The daily cron jobs could look like this:

# Summarize ip accounting info:
# every day, sum up the data of 7 days ago into one file.
1 0 * * * root /usr/local/bin/ipacsum -r -t "the day 7 days ago"
&gt;/dev/null
# every hour, sum up the data of 48 hours ago into one file
2 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/ipacsum -r -t "the hour 48 hours ago"
&gt;/dev/null
# every week, sum up the data of the week 11 weeks ago into one file
3 0 * * 0 root /usr/local/bin/ipacsum -r -t "the week 11 weeks ago"
&gt;/dev/null
# every year, sum up the data of the year 2 years ago into one file
4 0 1 2 * root /usr/local/bin/ipacsum -r -t "the year 2 years ago"
&gt;/dev/null
