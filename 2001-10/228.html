Yikes!

&gt; If not, then your lilo config is probably mulched.  I've got no idea if
&gt; you're able to access X or not, but if so, checkout freshmeat.net for some
&gt; GUI lilo config utilities, which can make the task 9 million times easier.

What absolutely appaling device.

"Can't get lilo going? No worries...use X. Oh, your problem was that you
can't boot the computer using lilo or loadlin. Well, X will work. X is
windows. It has to work."

Really.

1) man lilo.conf and man lilo
2) use vi/emacs/pico/ed...

And besides which, if someone doesn't actually understand how to setup
lilo in the first place, how is a GUI going to help? I suppose you're
just about to tell me that because Windows 2K has a GUI to control
[insert service, but for argument's sake let's choose IIS] I will
suddenly be able to configure it just as easily as a tool that I already
know.

I should line up for my "Instant MCSE" [tm] today...

&gt; I might be stating the obvious.. but.. its worth a shot.. hda1 = first
&gt; partition on your hard drive.  If you want the boot loader installed in your
&gt; MBA (where you'd likely want it if you're not using another boot manager)
&gt; you want hda, which is the actual hard drive device.

Here goes again.

Although it is technically possible (using devfs and devfsd and a
particularly weird mapping) to get a SCSI drive to appear as /dev/hda or
its partitions as /dev/hda# (where # is a partition number), last time I
looked SCSI devices appear as /dev/s[cryptic letters after this], not
/dev/h[cryptic letters after this].

So, given that I know that Robyn is not running a whacko version of
devfs with such a whacko naming scheme the hard drive she wants is NOT
hda...nor any of its partitions. Besides which, how can hda1 be the
first partion on my hard drive which happens to be /dev/hdb?

&gt; You'll probably need to recompile the kernel.  I've never actually used a
&gt; SCSI Linux box, but I'm assuming that you're probably using a default kernel
&gt; which loads scsi support via. modules - which of course it cant load,
&gt; because the hard drive isn't accessible. :-)

I think I've already said (but in private) that Robyn will have to work
out how to boot using either:

1) a kernel with SCSI support built in
2) a kernel + an initrd with appropriate modules thereon

Given that you'd probably be using the SCSI driver continuously if it is
the boot device it makes no sense to build it as a kernel module (i.e.
it's going to be used almost all the time anyway, so why bother about
unloading and unloading it all the time).

I should send this e-mail in HTML...
