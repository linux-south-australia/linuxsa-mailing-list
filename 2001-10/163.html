Hi,

Just when this product had completely satisfied all of my requirements for
price, performance, quality, reliability and open-source compatability,
they've gone and discontinued it. The reasoning? The card is apparently so
good they're going to stop selling it as a PCI addon and start exclusively
selling file-server boxes with them in :(

Can anyone suggest a similar product, or should I stock up now? The
requirements:

RAID-1 (Additional Hot Spare would be nice)
Works as Boot device
runs with x86 commodity hardware (ie: PCI slot)
ATA-66
Host Notification/"Lights out" management
FreeBSD/Linux compatable, with management software that doesn't require a
reboot.
Supports hot-swap of disks

Also desirable is the ability to act like a stripe set for disk reads.

Being able to pull drives out of running production servers and drop in
replacements on the fly without downtime does a lot for confidence and
uninterupted sleep. I don't particularly want to spend $10K+ on a SCSI
system that does the same thing as a $500 card each time I add a new server.

John Edwards
