&gt; &gt; Anyone out there been through this (ie working for a company under VA) and willing to share their experience?

i haven't been thru it, but know a little about it
&gt; 
&gt; Not me... however, I've always wondered how the VA fits in... where do
&gt; they get paid from? Do they take on ownership? I assume not... What is
&gt; "in it" for them if they get the company running again (eg Ansett --
&gt; do the VAs get anything if Ansett II is successfull?)
&gt; 

Voluntary Administration happens usually when the directors of a company 
have resolved that the company is either trading insolvently or
potentially might.

The Administrator is appointed and creditors are put on notice
	-&gt; any legal action by creditors is suspended for a while, whilst the
administrator works shit out.

	--&gt; the administrator will call meetings of the creditors who decide
the fate of the company

	--&gt; the creditors can choose to wind up the company --&gt; liquidate, or
they can let the company attempt to trade out of its troubles

	--&gt; Whilst the administrator is appointed, Director's powers are
suspended, the administrator has effective total control of the company
(they don't OWN anything, they just control it). The Administrator can
be replaced by the credtiros..

	--&gt; For Ansett, if you remember correctly, the Administrator was
replaced almost immediatly (in fact, the creditors never even chose to
replace him, he went b4 the first meeting - this was due to a potential
conflict of interest -&gt; his firm earned big $ off of Ansett). Hence that
is what is in it for administrators --&gt; being paid & often their company
is paid by the the company in administration.
	
	--&gt; The administrator will be paid by the company first (given priority
i think?), remember that the creditors can always choose to get rid of
the administrator..


very OT.. :)
