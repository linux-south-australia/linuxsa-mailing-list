Hi folks,

I work for Command recruitment in Central Sydney.

I have been asked by one of my clients to keep an eye out for Linux talent
as they are looking to employ 20 developers in the new year.  Applicants
must have knowledge of KDE and preferably have been involved in Opensource
development and embedded applications. Very cutting edge with a chance to
team lead projects from an early stage and a great opportunity to learn a
gamut of new technologies.  They are  looking for people with a passion for
this type of work with the right attitude and plenty of enthusiasm.   There
is not many companies like this devoted to Linux development so drop me an
email if you want to know more.

Also .. if there are any companies that are on this list that may be looking
for Linux developers there will a crossover of candidates available for you
to look at, so please don't hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

&gt; &gt; Mylex also has great harware support where you can see exactly whats
&gt; &gt; going on and can echo raid commands in to a special file in the proc
&gt; &gt; tree to rebuild and do consistency checks etc. Or you can script a test
&gt; &gt; that checks the status file for "OK" and emails you if its "ALERT".
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if this functionality is available for the Mylex card
&gt; for FreeBSD?

To an extent, it seems. The mlx(4), while functional, doesn't seem to
implement some of the features such as sending commands to it, as
mentioned above.

mlxcontrol(8) supports status, and will read the current configuration
from the controller.
