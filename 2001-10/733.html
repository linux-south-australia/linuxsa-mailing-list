<H1>Orinoco wireless cards, $69 a throw.  Who's interested?</H1>

<PRE>
Rasmus Lerdorf has just brought my attention to a batch of Orinoco
silver wireless networking cards which are being auctioned at ubid.
The URL is
<A HREF="http://www.ubid.com/actn/opn/getpage.asp?AuctionId">http://www.ubid.com/actn/opn/getpage.asp?AuctionId</A>=5839214.  There are
so many of these cards, and so few bidders, that it's a forgone
conclusion that we can get them for $69 US a pair.  In Australia, they
retail for about $320.

The Orinoco card is, in my opinion, the "standard" card.  I have  a
couple, and I'm quite happy with them.  The only drawback with this
card is that it only has 64 bit "encryption", as opposed to 128 bit
64 bit "encryption" on the Gold cards.  WEP is a pretty useless
protocol anyway, so this shouldn't worry anybody here.

Rasmus has already put in an order for these cards, and he has
graciously agreed to increment the order.  If you want a card, now's
your chance.

If you want one (or more) cards, please note:

1.  Reply to this message, copying Rasmus (who is already copied on
    this message).
2.  The auction closes at 5pm Monday PDT, which is 9:30 am Tuesday in
    South Australia.  Obviously you need to get your bid to Rasmus
    early enough so that he can count you in.  Sorry for the short
    notice, but that's the way it happened.
3.  This order is binding!  We'll put up the money up front, but
    there's no backing out afterwards.  And yes, we have interesting
    methods for dealing with people who do :-)
