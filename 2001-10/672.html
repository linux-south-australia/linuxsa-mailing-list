Hi,

Well, I picked up a Creative Labs Soundblaster Audigy today.

I have yet to go home and try it, and since i'm DJing tonite, i probably
won't get a chance until tomorrow arvo.

However, my choice of this card was made for several reasons, after doing
some research.

Firstly, the card appeals to me because i wanted something that could do 4+
discrete channels (ie 2D audio, instead of 1D from stereo), and also
something that has good sound quality. The Audigy claims to have
exceptionally good SNR and low distortion.
(100 db S/N, 0.004% THD)

There are several cards that are just "good quality sound" out there, but I
require Linux support as well. My games will be played in Windows, so all i
really wanted was basic DSP support for Linux.

Research showed up that the SB Live! seemed to have fairly good, ongoing,
opensource development. People on the sb mailing list are currently hacking
the SBlive driver to work with the Audigy, since its just one revision of
the chipset later
Creative's opensource efforts are basically next to none, but they do have
one employee whose job is to further efforts, vaguely help ppl out on the
mailing list, and Creative are happy for ppl to work on the drivers.
It could be better, but from what i've read of some other manufacturers,
there's plenty worse out there.


I'll let you know how I go with my own hacking of the card under Linux. ;)

Toby
