&gt; What are opinions on rebooting a 'generic' server (say file and print, or
&gt; mail etc...) using Linux (or xBSD) on a regular basis? This would usually

&gt; 
&gt; I know the question is very generalize, but the scope of its application
&gt; and usage is also general.

There are some people who run vmware (workstation version) on servers.
They ask for the instablility they usually get. Some people don't think
ahead when buying their servers and only notice the dodgy video card when
they start to push X a bit on the console (the NVidia drivers can crash
my machine I've found, especially when combined with VMware.)

&gt; Is it good practice and a necesary 'evil' to keep a box (and potential
&gt; memory leaks and so on) available? Or is it a lazy alternative to creating
&gt; a stable and well spec'ed setup?

Do you really know about leaks in Linux/xBSD? If so, try to report them to
the developers. These things are really, really rare in my experience
anyway. A leaking app, that's another story.

&gt; Is it better to have a machine reboot regularly during a quiet period (not
&gt; talking 24/7 access service level here) vs a slow-down and eventual hang
&gt; during working hours (say middle of the day in a finance departemnt just
&gt; before new financial year) due to a problem that built up over several
&gt; months (bad process table etc...)?

If you are getting this in more than one environment, and without a wild
and wonderful collection of experimental drivers for whack-o hardware, and
not running some bleeding-edge kernel, then there's probably some basic
factor other than the OS involved.
