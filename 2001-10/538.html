Not a bad idea. I recall someone doing a talk on installing FreeBSD at the
AUUG meeting a week or so ago.

&gt; &gt; Whilst it takes a long time, I usually prefer to do a custom install and
&gt; &gt; only install what's necessary. Most distributions have some pre-packaged
&gt; &gt; install types (eg, server, workstation, etc), but they all usually end up
&gt; &gt; installing 90% of the CD anyway....
&gt; 
&gt; I've found pretty much the opposite.  In any case, it's a 4 GB drive,
&gt; so that shouldn't be the issue.  The amount of stuff on the disk is
&gt; only marginally related to performance.

A 4GB drive will fill up pretty quickly on most users' systems (Windows
gets around this by requiring a reinstall on a quarterly
basis). Installing less is probably an advantage.

I am interested to hear about your experiences with the whole pre-packaged
install thing. I'm of the opinion that FreeBSD does this well, but I have
had problems with some Linux distributions (notably RedHat and
Mandrake) installing heaps and heaps of stuff (only leaving out things
that I don't want). A lot of distributions tend to start most services
they install by default. How many "home users" need to run portmap and the
NFS server?

thx,
Matt
