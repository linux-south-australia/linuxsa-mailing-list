(Initial post deleted *snip*)
&gt; Ara,
&gt; 	Whilst I agree that those seeking to make money from Linux
&gt; should pay for their support requests, I think there is a need to draw
&gt; a distinction between "support" and "pointing you in the right direction"

&lt;business&gt;
It seem to me that here we have a company which would like some 
information and is asking the Linux community to supply it.
Why don't we insist that they should pay for this
in a like manor.. supply us with the file format and technical
information of their software?
&lt;/business&gt;

The above equates to giving up their source code.  If they are 
committed to producing quality, reliable software
then they should realise that this is a good thing to do.

Someone should at least explain to them some of the 
aspects of GNU-Linux which have made it such a viable 
alternative to everything else out there.
