&gt;  Make a permanent stick-on label... that one

Good Idea. Those things would be good to have lying around, make cool
decorations too. ;)

&gt;  PLEASE CONSIDER a 2nd channel... news-
&gt;  group, maybe... 2nd mailing list (that one can
&gt;  decide about joining or not...) that focusses
&gt;  on this "promotional" side of LINUX activity...
my impression was that this was a _user group_ forum and that, as a
user group, linuxSA was not just about tech support but about meeting
people with similar interests for social and technical reasons, I know
that is the heart of HUMBUGs constitution and the platform of every
other user group I know of. If you want soley tech help I would
suggest another forum would be more appropriate for you because by
nature user groups tend to be more social than the help desk of any
organisation providing user support.

&gt;  I recently made the mistake of subscribing to
&gt;  the LINUX Games mailing list...
&gt;
&gt;  Just today alone, I found 160 e-mails from both
&gt;  LINUX lists... WAY to many to encourage any
ahh you get that with linux, try getting on debian-users or
squid-users then you'll really know about volume, and those 2 lists
are aimed soley at tech help. :)
