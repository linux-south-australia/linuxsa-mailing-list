At 11:23 16/10/98 +0930, you wrote:

&gt;Hi there, I think you may find that your problem is related to the
location

&gt;of your config files. I beleive that there were some changes in the dist
in

&gt;RH 5.X so make sure that httpd is finding the httpd.conf, srm.conf and

&gt;access.conf (also look out for mime types - it's in /etc)

&gt;


Yeah, I'm pretty sure that happened when Apache went up to the 1.3 dist

(as all the 1.2xx ones I have still use the standard /conf).

It is actually looking for ALL the conf files in ./etc

(it was on mine anyway)


They also have a shared 'server root' directory that is a bit annoying

to work with (esp. if you've had your own way of doing virt hosts with
1.2)


However, I have actually managed to play with the 'Configure' util,

before making the package, to make it install as per normal.

(It still has all these superfluous dirs, just doesn't use them)

It just takes a bit of cafeful re-pathing.


At least they didn't make the little starter script mandatory,

"/usr/sbin/httpd -f /[location of conf]/httpd.conf" still works

like a champ :-)


ANOTHER QUICK TIP:

Another notable thing I found with Apache 1.3x was that the

syntax for ".htaccess" files has one subtle difference.

In a auth popup .htaccess file ('&lt;&lt;limit get&gt;require valid
user&lt;&lt;/limit&gt;'), 

where the line entry for &lt;bigger&gt;AuthName could previously be done

as such:

...

AuthName My Auth Window

Authtype Basic

&lt;/bigger&gt;...


You now have to use quotes (for that field only):

&lt;bigger&gt;...

AuthName "My Auth Window"

Authtype Basic

&lt;/bigger&gt;...



I said it was subtle ;-)

But it had me wondering if my srm.conf (or which one) was set right,

because it just kept failing.


Hope this helps,

-Daniel
