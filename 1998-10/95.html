  SB&gt; Hi I'm very new to Linux. I've just installed and am having some
  SB&gt; problems installing sound support for my Sound Blaster 16 PNP
  SB&gt; sound card. I have run the program sndconfig that is supposed to
  SB&gt; set the sound card up but I keep getting an error that says
  SB&gt; "An error was encountered running the modprobe program."

Hi Simon.  You should probably do three things:

1/. (Next time) say a little more about your system, 
    e.g. "RedHat5.1, installed using the (precompiled) kernel 2.0.34", 
    or whatever is applicable to your system.

2/. Try running `modprobe -l' as root to see what modules are
    available to be loaded.  In your case, it looks like modprobe
    cannot find modules to load.  Have you looked for them under
    /lib/modules/ ?  (Have you run `depmod' as root?)

    It could be that the sound module is loaded as a fixed part of
    your kernel.  This might be a bad thing, as the kernel is loaded
    first of all, and when it is loaded, the PnP ports on your sound
    card may not be configured (properly) yet.

3/. When you get the right modules loaded, you might still have to fix
    the PnP set-up in /etc/isapnp.conf

I have a similar card (SB AWE32 PnP), and it took quite a few steps to
get all the pieces of my sound card working.  Raw audio was quite
easy, but some bits of the sound card were not configured properly,
since the PnP was not set up properly when I first installed Linux.
To fix this, I compiled my kernel, and during the configuration stage,
I made "sound" a loadable module, so that I could initialise the PnP
ports on my sound card _before_ the kernel's sound module was loaded.
If anyone is interested, I could post the full instructions of what I
did (I did not use RedHat's `sndconfig'; everything was done manually!).

  SB&gt; I also noticed that when Linux boots up I get a message saying
  SB&gt; "Can't locate module sound Can't locate module MIDI"

(On my system, I have a /etc/modules file which contains a list of
kernel modules to load at boot time.  If this file does not match what
really should be loaded, you will get some warnings.)

  SB&gt; which I assume may be part of the problem. I tried using the
  SB&gt; modprobe command directly using the sb module and the modprobe
  SB&gt; program was unable to find the sb module.

  SB&gt; Any help would be greatly apreciated.

There are many forms of documentation you could read (depending a
little on what system you have and how much documentation is
installed).  Some examples:

1/. Red Hat stuff like: 
	/usr/doc/rhsound-1.5/README.modules
	/usr/doc/isapnptools-1.11/README.modules

2/. HOWTOs like:
	/usr/doc/HOWTO/Sound-HOWTO
	/usr/doc/HOWTO/mini/Soundblaster-AWE (good PnP setup instructions)

3/. You could browse the LinuxSA mailing list archives, where this type of
    thing has been mentioned before.  e.g. "Sound problems with 2.0.33
    Kernel".

Good luck,

Phil
