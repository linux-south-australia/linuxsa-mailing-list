&gt; &gt; &gt;It seems to only ever attract kids who want to compile their

I don't see why shell access has to imply compiler access. The
University of Queensland, where I study, give free accounts with shell
access to all students and also run a comercial ISP that offers shell
accounts. The accounts they give out have no compiler access, no
permissions to execute binaries or shell scripts in their accounts
(although 1 or 2 of us have figured ways around scripts, granted we
can only do a limited amout of things with them). As long as you limit
what people can do with the accounts and they accept the limitations
then I see no problem. 

I don't see your point on the "too many rules" issue. Yes Australia may 
have restrictive laws in some areas, don't get me started on the gun laws 
and Howards right to do that (for those of you that don't know he had no 
right to attempt that type of legislation, under the australian 
constitution firearms are not specified as an area of commonwealth 
jurisdiction therefore are a state issue and as things stand the states 
can change the knee jerk gun laws at any time they want). The fact of the 
matter is that Australia law system is one of the most straght forward in 
the world, in the states and several other countries jurisdiction is a 
large pain in the rear 80% of time and there are rules even more
restrictive than what we have here. For example in the states the
equal rights and sexual harrasment/discrimination laws make it almost
impossible to turn some people down for employment or to fire them if
thry don't make the grade, and the harrasment laws make it easy for
you to end up in court and paying hefty fines for off the cuff remarks
that we would consider fair play. The fact of the matter is that the
laws regaurding trading hours are becoming more and more liberal as
time goes by, I'm only 20 and in my life I have seen things go from a
situation where only small bussinesses i.e. the corner store where
open on saturdays an sundays at all to a point where I can go to any
large shopping center at any time in regular bussiness hours on a
saturday and into town on sunday and shop anywhere of my choice. As
for you "brain drain" the flow of skilled workers from australia
occurs at all levels of industry, Australia has one of the best
education and training systems in the world, alot of that has to do
with the fact that we still have apprenticships and that our tertiary
education system is relativly small but extremely advanced. Our
skilled workers will leave the country because they can get better
money and conditions else where in the world, and Australias
reputation only helps that. As for second Class, I don't see it, I
honestly don't and second class compared to what?
