  &gt;&gt; I have a similar card (SB AWE32 PnP), and it took quite a few
  &gt;&gt; steps to &lt;SNIP&gt;  If anyone is interested, I could post the full
  &gt;&gt; instructions of what I did.

  TLT&gt; Yes please! that would be great. I'm having similar problems
  TLT&gt; with my AWE32 PnP.(Can't find sound module etc etc)

OK, but first a few caveats.  In the initial post, Simon Bruce talked
about `sndconfig'.  I don't really know anything about this (RedHat)
tool, since my system runs the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but I
guess it probably recompiles and installs the sound module(s) for you,
assuming your kernel is built ready for sound to be loaded as a
module.  What I describe below ignores this utility, and gets sound
working `from first principles'.

Secondly, YMMV == "your mileage may vary".  Two systems are rarely
ever the same, so what worked for me might not work for you.

Thirdly, getting sound working always involves compiling the kernel
(or at least the modules used by the kernel), since the sound module
must be told what I/O ports to use, &etc.  So you need all the latest
kernel source installed.  Don't be frightened to recompile the kernel;
it can have many benefits and it is quite straight forward (if you can
follow instructions).

So here goes:

0/. Read all the HOWTO's, etc.  The best one for SB AWE is the "Sound
    Blaster AWE 32/64 HOWTO" by Marcus Brinkmann.

1/. You need to configure PnP boards _before_ the kernel loads the
    sound module, which can be done as follows:

    a/. get ISAPnP from <A HREF="http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/index.html">http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/index.html</A>
        (or from your most convenient distribution).

    b/. Run ISAPnP once to produce a configuration file, which can
        then be edited and placed in /etc/isapnp.conf
	 - #&gt; pnpdump &gt; /etc/isapnp.conf
         - Check the output for a known bug where it doesn't always
           find all the Wavetable ports... on mine it found:
              (IO 0 (BASE 0x0620)) 
           but not 
              (IO 1 (BASE 0x0A20)) or (IO 2 (BASE 0x0E20))

         - Maybe the bug has been fixed by now; YMMV.

	 - This is what mine looks like:

	  <A HREF="mailto:phil@toby">phil@toby</A>|~&lt;103&gt; grep -v ^# /etc/isapnp.conf 

	  (ISOLATE)
	  (IDENTIFY-FORMAT "ISAPnP (hacked by Phil): Board %b details:\n Vendor %v, S/N %s. Identity %8 %7 %6 %5 %4 %3 %2 %1 %0\n")
	  (IDENTIFY *)
	  (CONFIGURE CTL009c/302077 (LD 0
	    (INT 0 (IRQ 5 (MODE +E)))
	    (DMA 0 (CHANNEL 1))
	    (DMA 1 (CHANNEL 5))
	    (IO 0 (BASE 0x0220))
	    (IO 1 (BASE 0x0330))
	    (IO 2 (BASE 0x0388))
	    (ACT Y)
	  ))

	  (CONFIGURE CTL009c/302077 (LD 1
	    (IO 0 (BASE 0x0200))
	    (ACT Y)
	  ))

	  (CONFIGURE CTL009c/302077 (LD 2
	    (IO 0 (BASE 0x0620))
	    (IO 1 (BASE 0x0A20))
	    (IO 2 (BASE 0x0E20))
	    (ACT Y)
	  ))

	  (CONFIGURE CTL009c/302077 (LD 3
	    (INT 0 (IRQ 10 (MODE +E)))
	    (IO 0 (BASE 0x0168))
	    (IO 1 (BASE 0x036e))
	    (ACT Y)
	  ))

	  (WAITFORKEY)

     c/. Add a short script in /etc/init.d (or whatever directory your
         system uses) as follows:
                #! /bin/sh
                # /etc/init.d/isapnp: configure Plug and Play boards

                test -x /sbin/isapnp || exit 0
                if [ -r /etc/isapnp.conf ]; then
                    /sbin/isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
                fi
                exit 0

         This MUST run before the sound module is loaded, so when
         building the kernel, the sound must be a _module_
         (i.e. loaded on demand, not compiled into the kernel).

	 If you have a very recent BIOS, it might be able to
         initialise the PnP boards before loading the kernel, in which
         case you don't need ISAPnP.

    If your board is not Plug-n-Pray, ignore the above!

2/. Sound drivers.   When I built my kernel, I got hold of the
    latest OSS/Free3.8 Sound Driver, rather than the default one that
    came with the kernel.  (<A HREF="http://www.4front-tech.com/ossfree">http://www.4front-tech.com/ossfree</A>)
    This driver replaced the contents of /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound
    (I'm not saying that it _has_ to be done that way, but that is how
    I did it.)

3/. I also got Iwai's low-level driver module for AWE support from 
    <A HREF="http://bahamut.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~iwai/awedrv/">http://bahamut.mm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~iwai/awedrv/</A>  This forms the
    basis for /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/lowlevel, and is designed
    to work with the OSS/Free sound driver.

4/. Configure your kernel...  This is what I used.  (I emphasise: YMMV!)
        CONFIG_SOUND=m
        # CONFIG_PAS is not set
        CONFIG_SB=y
        CONFIG_ADLIB=y
        # CONFIG_GUS is not set
        # CONFIG_MPU401 is not set
        # CONFIG_PSS is not set
        # CONFIG_GUS16 is not set
        # CONFIG_GUSMAX is not set
        # CONFIG_MSS is not set
        # CONFIG_SSCAPE is not set
        # CONFIG_TRIX is not set
        # CONFIG_MAD16 is not set
        # CONFIG_CS4232 is not set
        # CONFIG_MAUI is not set
        # CONFIG_OPL3SA1 is not set
        # CONFIG_SOFTOSS is not set
        CONFIG_YM3812=y
        SBC_BASE=220
        SBC_IRQ=5
        SBC_DMA=1
        SB_DMA2=5
        SB_MPU_BASE=330
        #
        # Enter -1 to the following question if you have something else such as SB16/32.
        #
        SB_MPU_IRQ=-1
        CONFIG_LOWLEVEL_SOUND=y
        # CONFIG_ACI_MIXER is not set
        CONFIG_AWE32_SYNTH=y
        # CONFIG_AEDSP16 is not set

5/. Build and install the kernel and modules.  You need to ensure that
    nothing will load the sound module at boot time (before the `init'
    scripts have run).  Once rebooted, you will need to load the sound
    module.  This can be done manually using `insmod', or automagically
    using `kerneld' (I guess `kerneld' is not Debian-specific).

6/. Once the sound module has been loaded, type this (as root):
       #&gt; cat /dev/sndstat

    Which should get you something that looks like this:

	    OSS/Free3.8s9-980302 (Thu Aug 20 22:44:12 CST 1998 root,
	    Linux toby 2.0.35 #1 Fri Jul 31 01:03:15 CST 1998 i586 unknown)
	    Load type: Driver loaded as a module.

	    0: System clock

	    Mixers:
	    0: Sound Blaster

    Any device that has parenthesis () around it is not working.

7/. Make sure /dev/dsp and /dev/audio exist, etc and that you're a
    member of the audio group, or change the permissions.  Some examples:
      crw-rw-rw-   1 root     audio     14,   4 Jun  1  1997 /dev/audio
      crw-rw----   1 root     audio     14,  20 Jun  1  1997 /dev/audio1
      crw-rw-rw-   1 root     audio     14,   3 Jun  1  1997 /dev/dsp
      crw-rw----   1 root     audio     14,  19 Jun  1  1997 /dev/dsp1
      crw-rw-rw-   1 root     audio     14,   2 Jun  1  1997 /dev/midi00
      crw-rw----   1 root     audio     14,  18 Jun  1  1997 /dev/midi01
      crw-rw----   1 root     audio     14,  34 Jun  1  1997 /dev/midi02
      crw-rw----   1 root     audio     14,  50 Jun  1  1997 /dev/midi03
      crw-rw-rw-   1 root     audio     14,   0 Jun  1  1997 /dev/mixer

8/. You need to read Iwai's instructions to load sound fonts if you
    want to use the AWE stuff.
    
Easy, huh?

  TLT&gt; One thing I'm curious about is that when I first installed
  TLT&gt; Redhat5.1, sndconfig found and set up my soundcard fine...I
  TLT&gt; wonder why it worked then but can't find the module now...

Ask a RH guru.
