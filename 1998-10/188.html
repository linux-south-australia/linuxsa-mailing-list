Hi,

as the subject suggests, I am having problems correctly printing to printers
shared by a win95 machine. I am able to print text files perfectly, but the
page does not automatically eject. The test page and other places say to
enable 'Send EOF', but I couldn't figure out where. I was looking at the
Printing-HOWTO and the help menu in printtool (i'm using RedHat 5.0). I may
have looked at other documents, but if I have, I can't remember which ones.

Also, I tried the postscript test page, but It came up with a bunch of junk
instead. the fisrt few lines on the first page was something like:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0
%%Title: testpage.fig
%%Creator: fig2dev Version 3.1 Patchlevel 2

a bit later it goes into stuff like:

/col0 {0.000 0.000 0.000 srgb} bind def

and there's more. each time it printed to to the top half of a page, went to
the next page and started printing more stuff. By the time it finished the
3rd page, I ended up resetting the printer to stop it. Anyway, I guess this
means that my printer isn't postscript compatible :P  (it's a Epson Stylus
Color ESC P2). I know it's probaby time to get a new printer, but this one
still does the job. anyway, if I can't print using postscript, is there
anyway to print pictures, formatted text and so on, or will I have to use
Win95 for this?


thanks,
Andy
