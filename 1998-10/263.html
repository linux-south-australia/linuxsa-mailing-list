Well look forward to it.  Programming under unix is much more fun then
under windows.  They call Unix the OS written by programmers, for
programmers.  Not quite correct, but close enough to make our lives much
much easier.

&gt; I will highly appreciate if somebody  reply me for the following questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 	1. How should I go around in getting understanding of Operating System and
&gt; its API ?

(snip comment on line width, 7[05] columns and all that jazz :).

Linux is a Unix clone.  That means that almost any good Unix programming
book can be applied to linux.  In fact Linux probably has less unique
`features' in it's interfaces then the commercial unices.

I presume you're going to be programming in C.  The following
comments will require modification if you're not.

Definately get K&R (although you probably already have it).

Definately consider getting Stevens "Advanced Programming in the Unix
Environment".  It covers almost everything you will need from Basic -&gt;
Advanced.

Lewine, "Posix Programmers Guide" (ORA) is highly recommended. 

These three are my `standard kit' of books that I ensure I have with me if
I am going to be doing any Unix programming.  To this kit I add various
other books depending on domain.

What sort of program's are you working on?

&gt; 	2. Do Linux have DLL (Dynamic Link Library) support ?

Linux dosn't support .dll files.  It does support shared object files
through ld.so (in fact the compiler will link to shared object files by
default, you have to specify the -static option to do static linking).
Linux also supports dynamic loading of static object files through
the dl* interface. Check the man page for dlopen(3) for more details.

Between these two interfaces, Linux supports everything DLL's do (IIRC),
and more.
