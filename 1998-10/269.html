&gt; &gt;have you thought of a quote ?

&gt; Linux: Where were you yesterday?
&gt; 
&gt; Cool idea about the shirts, but I think the original point still stands,
&gt; which is the fact that the VIM mugs make a damn handy reference, as well
as
&gt; a good accessory to the win95 CD coaster.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I have a rough show of hands as to who wants some mugs and how many.
If
&gt; we have a general interest I'll make a bulk order. If we get more that 12
&gt; ordered, the per unit cost is less than US$12 each, which is around $19.
&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm using US$0.56 as a converter.

 Even though I brought the question of T-Shirts
 into the conversation, this seems to be leaving
 the technical and going deeply into the promo-
 tional... and - possibly - commercial... (if the
 *other* guy's  $4.00 / mug price is any indica-
 tion...  ;)  Seriously, maybe a cooler way to
 put all the toys back into Pandora's Box is to:

 Make a permanent stick-on label... that one
 could stick (permanently) onto anything one
 like... $ 1 Generic Mugs, Briefcase, Window,
 etc.  Now, that's all I need to hear about it all

 PLEASE CONSIDER a 2nd channel... news-
 group, maybe... 2nd mailing list (that one can
 decide about joining or not...) that focusses
 on this "promotional" side of LINUX activity...

 So that one could choose:  Tech-Only, Promo's
 -Only or Both Tech & Promo's...

 I recently made the mistake of subscribing to
 the LINUX Games mailing list...

 Just today alone, I found 160 e-mails from both
 LINUX lists... WAY to many to encourage any
 useful work getting done here for a good half-
 hour...!

 Words to the Wise...  ;)

 I do not intend to add further to the thread(s) on
 Promo's... back to work I must go...  ;)
