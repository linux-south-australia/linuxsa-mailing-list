&gt; Two inquiries...
&gt; 
&gt;   First i am not yet a Linux user but intend to install and test a 
&gt; system soon. The information in the Linux group Emails is informative 
&gt; but i would like a book or books  on linux that contains not only the 
&gt; basics but info on problems that will likely be encountered real world 
&gt; situations. 

Firstly a request, could you please show some consideration, and
netiquete, for other users and stick to 70 character formated mail.
some email readers do not have a wordwrap fetaure and nothing ticks
people off more than having to reformat a mail before replying.

Onto your inquires,

I don't know of any books like that. most problems are caused because
people do not do what the documentation says or recommends and need to
be fixed through experience. That is where forums like this or irc
(the openprojects.net servers are good) come into it, they allow you
access to other peoples experience and knowledge.

&gt;   I was talking to an ISP the other day who installed Red Hat Linux on 
&gt; his system only to have it almost immediately hacked. His impression was 
&gt; that one or more of the modules has a "backdoor" written into the program 
&gt; that allowed for easy entry into his system.

This is the biggest load of crap I have ever heard. There is no excuse
for sloppy sysadmin work. As with any OS (NT and 95/98 included) if
you want to be secure you must keep the system up-to-date, keep up on 
security issues, patch any programs which happen to have security 
holes in them and configure all aplications so they present no risk to
the integrity of the system. And exactly what did he mean by modules?
A kernel module? or some app he had on it?

&gt;   Could someone who is familiar with Linux help with the following: Is it 
&gt; is secure, if so, to what extent? Are some versions more prone to the above 
&gt; problems than others? I believe that some versions of Linux have been 
&gt; developed by a small number of persons working together rather than by web 
&gt; users in general. Are these versions likely to be more secure than others? 
&gt; Does the source codes availability add or detract from security issues?

Linux, like other OSes, is as secure or insecure as you make it. My
box is extremely secure, you can only access it from 5|6 hosts and not
all of those hosts have access to all the services. A poorly
configured system is about as secure as an NT box. As for code
availability the only difference it makes is that people can read the
code and try to deduce where the problems are, but most holes are
still found by accident i.e. someone find a behaviour while
configureing their system that would cause a problem in the wrong
hands and then passes the info along to the rest of the community as a
warning and in the hope of getting it fixed.

&gt;   So what versions would you folk recommend?
I recommend Linux linux version 2.0.35 or 2.1.125
As for distributions, for a newbie try RedHat or SuSE, I use Debian.

Nikolai
