&gt; What I'm not so sure about is setting the Sendmail up. I can get it to
&gt; receive the mail for the users. That part was easy. I've also got the other
&gt; domains I host listed in the aliases file. What I want to know, is how can I
&gt; get another computer to be able to log in using POP to retrieve the mail?
&gt; When I try to connect to the server using Outlook 98 on my Windows machine,
&gt; the Linux box won't allow the connection.  Is it possible to have the use
&gt; the same user name for more than one domain but have different accounts for
&gt; them?  eg, <A HREF="mailto:admin@bachblue.com.au">admin@bachblue.com.au</A> and <A HREF="mailto:admin@ross.wattle.id.au...">admin@ross.wattle.id.au...</A> And is it
&gt; possible to get it to use IMAP instead of POP?

This is not a sendmail function, you want ipopd or something similar
to provide the pop functionality or the imap package (there is a .deb
called imap) to provide the IMAP functionality. The reason you
currently get a connection refused message is simply because you are
not running the correct daemons to provide the services. With regaurds to the 
username thing, it is possible. The only setup I have seen that
accepts mail for other domains has an alternate aliases file for the virtual domain
which handles all the mail aliases for that domain.

&gt; Also, Sendmail seems to be stuck in a loop... I sent a test message on it,
&gt; and it seems to be going round and round in circles trying to do something
&gt; with this e-mail. I just deleted the file in /var/spool/mail which was
&gt; 160Mb!!  And that wasn't the first time I've deleted it either. What's the
&gt; file I need to delete to stop the loop?

remove anything in /var/spool/mqueue, that should fix the loop. I'd
like to know who you sent the mail to that it started the loop, it
sounds like a problem with aliases and .forward files :) 

&gt; One other thing. It currently processes the mail every 2 minutes. Is there a
&gt; way I can get it to process it as soon as it comes in?
my sendmail setup does this already, I'd have to see your conf file
before I could make a judgment on what is causing the queueing of the
mail, though I might add I think this is a good feature, aswell as
queueing outgoing mail as it allows you to run administrative jobs to
kull inapropraite mail :)
