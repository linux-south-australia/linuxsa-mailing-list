&gt; Because you CAN use the tool(s) in a harmful manner...
&gt; it is assumed that you INTEND TO and/or WILL do so...
&gt; which provides the justification for ARBITRARY RESTRIC-
&gt; TIONS (like the three we see above)...

I would suggest the motivation behind the restriction is overwhelmingly a
commercial one, SBS.

While I believe your arguments are valid in the context of our social
constructs, where everyone's rights need to be considered (hopefully!).
Making rules as a government, and making rules as a commercial business, tend
to lie on quite different ground, in general.

ISPs are protecting their own, financial, interests, by protecting the
interests of the majority of their customers. Think about the multitude of
clauses in insurance policies, the regulations that financial instituions
impose on their customers. Many of these may well be seen to be adverse to
the well-being of some of their customers, but overall the bulk of the
customers benefit, and so, therefore, does the business.

You may well be completely trustworthy, so might I be, so might any other
person applying for an account. But how would you feel if your ISP let you
down by letting down their guard and allowing their service, which you are a
paying customer for, to be maliciously interfered with such that you weren't
getting able to get that service?

I don't think you are being fair in accusing Alex of assuming that *you* will
cause harm, he is taking a not unreasonable approach, of assuming that
*someone* might cause harm, and that if it were to happen, it could have
seriously detrimental effects to his business. When you balance that against
how much business he might be losing (how many people these days even *have*
a need for their ISP to provide them with shell accounts?), the decision, to
me, seems to be quite sound.

Just my thoughts (not adjusted for GST :)

Wayne
