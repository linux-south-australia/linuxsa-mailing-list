&gt; For all people on the LinuxSA mailing list from Adelaide Uni CS
&gt; department. (& other interested individuals)
&gt; 
&gt; The reason we are getting multiple copies of LinuxSA mail is because the
&gt; CS mail server is set up so that if people's mail accounts are over quota,
&gt; mail gets postponed. The mailing list sends mail to a number of people
&gt; here, some of whom have mail account that are too full. The mail is sent
&gt; to everyone, but then it is postponed. It then gets resent again after 15
&gt; minutes. What this means is that unless all CS students on LinuxSA keep
&gt; thier mailboxes relatuively clean, the rest of us suffer. Stuart
&gt; (sysadmin) is currently in the process of upgrading sendmail to stop this
&gt; behaviour, but until he does so, we are consigned to having to log in
&gt; every hour, and delete repeat mails. Anyone who has a full mailbox should
&gt; try to keep it empty, so that the repeats stop...

hmmm interesting,  but really, when it costs less than $10 bucks to join
the student machine user group (smug), which includes 10 meg, and web page
hosting, you'd be craaaazy to use you're cs account :)
I would suggest all students get behind their student orgs!
Especially ones as useful as smug!

mikel.
