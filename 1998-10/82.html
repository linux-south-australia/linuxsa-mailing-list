<H1>Installing via FTP</H1>

I have recently got myself a copy of Linux Redhat and would very
much like to install it on a second machine via FTP from my Windows 95
machine (ie the one with a CDROM drive).

I installed the Personal Web Server on Windows, started the FTP
server and shared the CDROM (drive e:\) as /CDROM ... all seemed
fine as I could FTP locally (on the Windows 95 machine) and list
the contents of the CD.  The Redhat setup on the remote machine
also seemed to be able to connect, until it tried to access
subdirectories of the root (ie /CDROM/Redhat)

Experementing with FTP on the 95 server it seems if you share a folder
(that isn't a drive) everythings fine.  If you share a drive (like
C:\ or E:\) you can list the root, but you can't see anything
below it (access denied).

Unless windows has some implicit security system to stop sharing
root drives, or else I'm missing something planely obvious I'd be
most interested to know.

(as usual the above was supposed to be a time saving measure
to avoid pulling the CDROM out of my other machine...I'll know
for next time)

If this is an obvious bandwith-wasting question, please let me
know with the appropriate comment.

Regards....Sam Barnes.
