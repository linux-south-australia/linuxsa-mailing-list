I just thought I'd relay the following vulnerability warning
(in part to inform you about it, in part to remind you about
CERT & its advisory service, and in part to see if any RH
enthusiasts respond, e.g. by asking if RH will fix RH 5.1)

CERT* Advisory CA-98.12
Original issue date: October 12, 1998

Topic: Remotely Exploitable Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in mountd
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affected systems:

NFS servers running certain implementations of mountd, primarily Linux
systems. On some systems, the vulnerable NFS server is enabled by default.
This vulnerability can be exploited even if the NFS server does not share
any file systems.

See Appendix A for information from vendors. If your vendor's name does not
appear, we did not hear from that vendor.


Overview:

NFS is a distributed file system in which clients make use of file systems
provided by servers. There is a vulnerability in some implementations of
the software that NFS servers use to log requests to use file systems.

When a client makes a request to use a file system and subsequently makes
that file system available as a local resource, the client is said to
"mount" the file system. The vulnerability lies in the software on the NFS
server that handles requests to mount file systems. This software is
usually called "mountd" or "rpc.mountd."

Intruders who exploit the vulnerability are able to gain administrative
access to the vulnerable NFS file server. That is, they can do anything the
system administrator can do. This vulnerability can be exploited remotely
and does not require an account on the target machine.

On some vulnerable systems, the mountd software is installed and enabled by
default. See Appendix A for more information.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information. Please
check our advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Description

NFS is used to share files among different computers over the network using
a client/server paradigm. When an NFS client computer wishes to access
files on an NFS server, the client must first make a request to mount the
file system. There is a vulnerability in some implementations of the
software that handles NFS mount requests (the mountd program).
Specifically, it is possible for an intruder to overflow a buffer in the
area of code responsible for logging NFS activity.

We have received reports indicating that intruders are actively using this
vulnerability to compromise systems and are engaging in large-scale scans
to locate vulnerable systems.

On some systems, the vulnerable NFS server is enabled by default. See the
vendor information in Appendix A.

II. Impact

After causing a buffer overflow, a remote intruder can use the resulting
condition to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

III. Solution

A. Install a patch from your vendor.

Appendix A contains input from vendors who have provided information for
this advisory. We will update the appendix as we receive more information.
If you do not see your vendor's name, the CERT/CC did not hear from that
vendor. Please contact your vendor directly.

B. Until you install a patch, use the following workaround.

Consider disabling NFS until you are able to install the patch. In
particular, since some systems have vulnerable versions of mountd installed
and enabled by default, we recommend you disable mountd on those systems
unless you are actively using those systems as NFS servers.

Appendix A - Vendor Information

Below is a list of the vendors who have provided information for this
advisory. We will update this appendix as we receive additional
information. If you do not see your vendor's name, the CERT/CC did not
hear from that vendor. Please contact the vendor directly.
