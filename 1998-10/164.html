<H1>What's wrong with my network configuration.?</H1>

Hi,

I have been persevering for some considerable time now trying to setup
internet services with Redhat 5.1 with only partial success. The problem
is that I am able to send and receive mail and to access newsgroups but
otherwise unable to see past my service provider's home page
(camtech.net.au).

I have tried diligently to do my homework before seeking help to the
extent that in addition to Redhat specific documentation I have read all
the Linux networking How-To's. However, I have found that to the
uninitiated new Linux user the volume of information not to mention the
version and shell differences and the predominantly Ethernet coverage
has left me very confused as to the correct configuration for my
standalone Intel PC internet connection.

My service provider's help desk, who does not officially provide
technical support for the Linux O/S, advised me to edit auto
configuration for proxy.camtech.net.au under advanced preferences in
Netscape Navigator and that would fix the problem. The Netscape 4.05
version that comes in  Redhat 5.1 does not have this option as does my
version under Win95. If  the proxy is the answer to my problem I suspect
it has to be configured in a specific Linux network file somewhere.?

For the record I have a dynamic PPP connection (ppp 2.3.3-6). My kernel
is 2.0.35-1 and I am trying to configure using the Network Configurator
that comes with X Windows.I log into my service provider as root.

My current configuration settings are as follows;

hostname=localhost.localdomain
domain=camtech.net.au
nameserver=203.5.73.2
          =203.5.73.1
host IP=127.0.0.1
host name=localhost
interface=ppp0
nickname=localhost.local.domain
routing=no entries


*PPP and modem have been configured as part of the network configuration
process.  

I note that there are a number of networking files in /etc/ppp,
some reflecting my above configuration,but I am unsure which, if
any, I need to edit to rectify the problem.

I would be most grateful for help with the above network problem.

Regards

Brenton Pettitt
