Ara,
	Whilst I agree that those seeking to make money from Linux
should pay for their support requests, I think there is a need to draw
a distinction between "support" and "pointing you in the right direction"

As you note, the level of question asked was pretty elementary.

We, as members of the Linux community, need to be prepared to give a
bit back to the community.  There is no reason why we cannot expect
renumeration for our professional services, but there is also no reason
why we can't spend whole days on installfests and the like where we give
freely, just to show people that we care about Linux (much like other
community service organizations give time for their causes).

Personally, I draw the line when between "advocacy" and "hand-holding".
If I am helping you setup/run your business, you should be paying me.
If you are asking questions, wanting directions, testing the waters or
just generally curious, then I'm here for you!

there's my 0.02 + gst :-)
Nate
