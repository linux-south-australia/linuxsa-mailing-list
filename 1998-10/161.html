Wow, I find this hard to believe. The AOpen is a good motherboard
and the Maxtor isn't bad either. Their is no reason for them to be
incompatible.

What sort of errors are being generated?
Can it be auto detected by the BIOS?
Is it on the primary or secondary controller?
Is it set as the master or slave drive?
Are their any other IDE devices in the system?
(eg Zip, CDROM, Other HDD)

I have been in the business a long time now and IDE
compatibility problems are almost unheard of these days.
If there is a problem it usually comes down to a hardware
failure or incorrect configuration.

The reason I have posted this to the group is because
I feel that there is "a little something in this for all of us"
Don't accept the "incompatibility" excuse without finding
out why! Never settle for "it just doesn't work".
In this day and age hardware is of such a quality (in
general assuming you buy reasonable brands) that this
sort of thing should not happen. Of course the same can
not be said for software unless it is Linux. :)

Steve if you can get that info to me I may well be able
to help you out and save you quite a bit of time and
hassle.

&gt; 
&gt; Hi all
&gt; I have recently gotten a P2 system, running with an AOpen AX6B+ mainboard.
&gt; Unfortunately, I seem to have a compatibility problem between this board
&gt; and my Maxtor DiamondMax 5.1Gb hard drive.
&gt; In light of this, and not really being able to afford to get another hard
&gt; drive at this time, I would like to find someone who is willing to swap
&gt; this drive for one of the same (or larger, with a $$$ payment for the
&gt; difference, of course) size. I wouldn't mind getting something like a
&gt; Quantum, but i'll take any Mode 4 or better drive that actually WORKS with
&gt; my mainboard.
&gt; Please CC any replies to this email to <A HREF="mailto:sjb@thunderbolt.net.au">sjb@thunderbolt.net.au</A> if you're
&gt; interested.
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Steven Bolbot
