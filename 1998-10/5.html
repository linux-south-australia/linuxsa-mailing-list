&gt; My dad's school (he's a teacher) is going to spend a few hundred

&gt; Would a 486 be enough for 30+ clients? I'll have a look at that squid

I know of one school that is currently doing this and has been for quite a
while now (~3years).  The most difficult bit is bringing the school
computer master up to speed so he can do some of the basic admin.  The
best bit is that basic admin is hardly ever necessary.

Linux is cool.  If the school uses NT for a routing/proxy box it's wasting
its money.  Linux does a far better job, on signifigantly less hardware,
for signifigantly less money.
