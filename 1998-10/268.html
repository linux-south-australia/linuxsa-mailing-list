&gt; &gt;8)
&gt; &gt;No suprises there. 
&gt; &gt;Too much of a "kick-me" sign for an ISP IMOHO ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It seems to only ever attract kids who want to compile their
&gt; &gt;little exploit/irc bots. (or somewhere to stash warez)

So, because some people drink drive, we should close
the roads to all drivers...?!?

There are too many rules... and creative people (here) may
decide to leave, rather than wearing the "2nd Class" status
that staying here (however nice it seems, otherwise)... i.e.
more Brain-Drain... either interstate or across the ocean...

(For me, SA's "Trading Hours" Laws is *THE* Example...)

APANA's member-owned Public Access systems (however
narrow their bandwidth to the larger 'net...) is one way to
get a Shell Account... WITHOUT having to SHOW CAUSE
(a.k.a. "PLEASE EXPLAIN")  to a commercial ISP to afraid
of your "power"...

(Contrast Australian gun laws to those of Sweden:  In Swe-
den, each (male) citizen is - after completing military service
- ISSUED a firearm... to keep in the home...  It's part of the
defense responsibility of the country's TOTAL-DEFENSE-
policy that helps it to retain its strong, proud Neutrality-
policy;  IT PAYS TO HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBLE
PEOPLE AROUND... people that have a tradition of being
trusted with powerful tools...)

Now, translate that into the discussion about Shell Acc'ts
 
&gt; Quite right, but that said we do have shell account available to anyone
who
&gt; needs them however you...

So, just as Australian firearm licensing... you want Users
to make a case for a Shell Account...

Again, treating people like the children you imagine them
to be... (from the above)

Sorry, guy...  I think we need to develop more trust in our
fellow Aussies... and - where necessary - trust-worthiness

(This has been an unpaid "ad" for world best practice in
democracy  "What can we learn from the Swedes, et al?")
 
&gt; - can't irc to/from them.
&gt; - can't ftp to/from them.
&gt; - can't read your mail from them. (we have a good POP3 server)

Because you CAN use the tool(s) in a harmful manner...
it is assumed that you INTEND TO and/or WILL do so...
which provides the justification for ARBITRARY RESTRIC-
TIONS (like the three we see above)...

&gt; and the shell server is on the other end of a 33.6K link, however if you
&gt; have a genuine reason for needing one (most people don't), and you put it
&gt; in wqriting then you get one free with a lynx account :o)

At least - in fairness to the (SA) government's firearm laws -
"Genuine" Reasons for possessing a firearm in this State
are listed on the application...
 
&gt; Alex!
&gt; 
&gt;            from  Alex Garner - <A HREF="mailto:mlist@lynx.net.au">mlist@lynx.net.au</A>

So, tell me, Alex, where is the list of "Genuine"
reasons (from the point of view of Lynx) for want-
ing a Shell Account?

PS So far, one who qualifies for an Amateur Radio
license DOESN'T have to make any "Request in
Writing" for the privilege of designing, constructing,
modifying or operating radio transmitters on Amateur
Frequencies...

The ACA *assumes* &lt;a priori&gt; (without really knowing)
the innocense of the licensee... i.e. until there is sig-
nificant interference or complaints arising from the op-
eration of the licensee's radio station...

You know, "Innocent until Proven Guilty"...?

What can ISP's learn from this example...?   ;)

What 'cha think?
