&gt; Subject: Possible new CAD package.
&gt; Date: Thursday, 1 October 1998 09:20
&gt; 
&gt; I am writing this email on behalf of a local software house that attended
&gt; the RMS talk on the 24th. They are interested in producing Linux versions
&gt; of their software range (a complete CAD package of comparable if not
&gt; higher quality than AutoCAD) but have a few questions they would like
&gt; answers to first. I have already supplied basic answers but I lack the
&gt; experience to answer in real detail. Could people please spare the time
to
&gt; answer one or more of these questions it would be appreciated, as Linux
&gt; needs a high quality, low cost package like this.

A "local software house" is a business, right?

Wouldn't it be fair for a business to offer to *pay* for the kind
of consulting services it seems to be asking for (anonymously?)
through you...?

If not now, then later... e.g. after they start to make money on
their (possible) investment(s) into LINUX...

I see no reason why a small (but not insignificant) "retainer"
should not be paid - i.e. to somebody with the info requested,
as well as an agreed amount or % (open to negotiation)... later,
i.e. when any LINUX-based software system is released to market.

&gt; &gt; 1. The cost and availability of the "word" and "excel" replacements
&gt; &gt; 2. Is a Fortran compiler available? And if so is any cost involved.
&gt; &gt; 3. Is the X-Window library readily available, cost?
&gt; &gt; 4. The C-compiler is available, cost?
&gt; &gt; 5. Is a Linker available?

This doesn't sound like a very high-powered software house IMHO
Any software house that I've ever heard of has an Internet con-
nection... thru which a lot of these questions can be answered,
very likely in an afternoon, by visiting LINUX sites, I'd say.

So, maybe the fairest way to bill this might be to let them pay
someone - yourself even - for Internet Research into their ques-
tions... how's that for a win-win solution... paid surf-time...!
 
&gt; If anyone has had any positive/negative experiences in developing/porting
&gt; software along these lines for Linux comments would be useful.
&gt;
&gt; Also if people could comment on their level of interest (profession and
&gt; personal) in seeing a high quality CAD package being released for Linux.

Why not mention the terrific (and well-known) LINUX-based graphics
work that was done, in connection with producing Titanic (the movie)?

*That* should whet their appetite for LINUX (since they seem to need
so much less - I presume - animation power...)

Don't forget to tell them about NASA's high-performance LINUX release
that enables multiple processors to handle huge computational tasks...
 
&gt; Could all responses please be sent directly to me unless you feel that
&gt; your answers/comments are of interest to others.

Oh, I think the idea of Volunteerism -vs- Paying for Consulting Services
is well worth hearing opinions about in the mailing-list...  Every small
business would like to have cost-free human resources...

If it were Animal Welfare League or the Red Cross... I might apply...
but - not knowing (at this stage) even who's asking for cost-free info,
I'd have to say...

Tell me more (e.g. the name of the local software house...)
 
&gt; Thanks in advance...
&gt; Nick Stock
&gt; 
&gt; PS. Below is the company profile for those who are interested. I have
&gt; removed the company name because at this stage they have merely
&gt; asked me to float the idea.

Not good enough... IMHO... kindly e-mail me this critical detail... and
I may be able to help...
 
&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Company Profile
&gt; 
&gt; XXX Pty Ltd is a high technology company based in
&gt; Adelaide, Australia, specialising in the development of CAD
&gt; software products for the engineering, architectural and
&gt; construction industries and in the design and production of
&gt; multimedia CAD applications. 
&gt; 
&gt; Founded in 1987 after some four years of extensive software

Someday, we'll have enough on-line info to find the name of this
local firm from the "clues" we've been given (at least if Adelaide
stays this small... ;)

&gt; development, XXX has provided a range of CAD
&gt; software products which have become well established in
&gt; Australia, and is widening its penetration abroad. XXX has
&gt; established a proven record of success and has backed this
&gt; search for success with several coveted awards, including the
&gt; Australian Design Award and the MTA Computer Graphics Award.

These hints should make it easier... c'mon people, who knows
the name of the mystery company now...?
 
&gt; XXX's client base includes some 3000 users ranging from
&gt; government, education and private sectors. 
&gt; 
&gt; XXX is continually evaluating the latest developments
&gt; in information technology, and is totally committed to the design
&gt; and development of software for all facets of technical computing.

In that case, they already *know* the answers to their questions
(or should)... maybe their just looking for people to do the job
of porting it... In fairness, this could be a job opportunity...

&gt; Also, the company is actively engaged in the development of
&gt; multimedia products and stereograms, to tap into the international
&gt; market place. 

Do they do any 3D Dental / X-Ray applications, by any chance...?
 
&gt; XXX has also developed My 3D World, which is a Multimedia
&gt; 3D construction package for children aged 7 and up, incorporating
&gt; real-time rendering, assembly and visualisation. 

Now, this should make it real easy to find them... (Hey! Is this
just a bit of subtle or "guerilla" marketing going on here...?)
 
&gt; The objective of XXX is to become a significant
&gt; developer of multimedia products incorporating realtime rendering
&gt; and is totally committed to increasing the marketing of locally
&gt; designed and produced products in the global marketplace. 

Well, they've come to the right place...  ;)
