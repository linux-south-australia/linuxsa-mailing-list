&gt;
&gt;  SB&gt; Hi I'm very new to Linux. I've just installed and am having some
&gt;  SB&gt; problems installing sound support for my Sound Blaster 16 PNP
&gt;  SB&gt; sound card. I have run the program sndconfig that is supposed to
&gt;  SB&gt; set the sound card up but I keep getting an error that says
&gt;  SB&gt; "An error was encountered running the modprobe program."
&gt;
&gt;Hi Simon.  You should probably do three things:
&gt;
&gt;1/. (Next time) say a little more about your system,
&gt;    e.g. "RedHat5.1, installed using the (precompiled) kernel 2.0.34",
&gt;    or whatever is applicable to your system.


I am running Red Hat 5.1, kernal 2.0.35 onr an i586.

&gt;2/. Try running `modprobe -l' as root to see what modules are
&gt;    available to be loaded.  In your case, it looks like modprobe
&gt;    cannot find modules to load.  Have you looked for them under
&gt;    /lib/modules/ ?  (Have you run `depmod' as root?)


I got the list of modules and there was nothing about sound or anything like
that. In all the documentation that I have read it says that I should load
sb.o or sound.o and I have not been able to find these in the module
directory or when I do a modprobe -l

&gt;    It could be that the sound module is loaded as a fixed part of
&gt;    your kernel.  This might be a bad thing, as the kernel is loaded
&gt;    first of all, and when it is loaded, the PnP ports on your sound
&gt;    card may not be configured (properly) yet.

Is there any way that I kind find this out?

&gt;3/. When you get the right modules loaded, you might still have to fix
&gt;    the PnP set-up in /etc/isapnp.conf

I ran the application pnpdump but it could not find the card in the machine.

&gt;I have a similar card (SB AWE32 PnP), and it took quite a few steps to
&gt;get all the pieces of my sound card working.  Raw audio was quite
&gt;easy, but some bits of the sound card were not configured properly,
&gt;since the PnP was not set up properly when I first installed Linux.
&gt;To fix this, I compiled my kernel, and during the configuration stage,
&gt;I made "sound" a loadable module, so that I could initialise the PnP
&gt;ports on my sound card _before_ the kernel's sound module was loaded.
&gt;If anyone is interested, I could post the full instructions of what I
&gt;did (I did not use RedHat's `sndconfig'; everything was done manually!).
&gt;
&gt;  SB&gt; I also noticed that when Linux boots up I get a message saying
&gt;  SB&gt; "Can't locate module sound Can't locate module MIDI"
&gt;
&gt;(On my system, I have a /etc/modules file which contains a list of
&gt;kernel modules to load at boot time.  If this file does not match what

&gt;really should be loaded, you will get some warnings.)


I could not find this file on my system.

&gt;  SB&gt; which I assume may be part of the problem. I tried using the
&gt;  SB&gt; modprobe command directly using the sb module and the modprobe
&gt;  SB&gt; program was unable to find the sb module.
&gt;
&gt;  SB&gt; Any help would be greatly apreciated.
&gt;
&gt;There are many forms of documentation you could read (depending a
&gt;little on what system you have and how much documentation is
&gt;installed).  Some examples:
&gt;
&gt;1/. Red Hat stuff like:
&gt; /usr/doc/rhsound-1.5/README.modules
&gt; /usr/doc/isapnptools-1.11/README.modules
&gt;
&gt;2/. HOWTOs like:
&gt; /usr/doc/HOWTO/Sound-HOWTO
&gt; /usr/doc/HOWTO/mini/Soundblaster-AWE (good PnP setup instructions)


I have been through these documents but to no avail. I will got through them
again though just in case

&gt;3/. You could browse the LinuxSA mailing list archives, where this type of
&gt;    thing has been mentioned before.  e.g. "Sound problems with 2.0.33
&gt;    Kernel".


I'll go through this as well

&gt;Good luck,
&gt;
