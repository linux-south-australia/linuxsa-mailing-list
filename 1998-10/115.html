&gt;   Secondly  - Which Version and Security.
&gt; 
&gt;   i was talking to an ISP the other day who installed Red Hat Linux on
&gt; his system only to have it almost immediately hacked. His impression was
&gt; that one or more of the modules has a "backdoor" written into the
&gt; program that allowed for easy entry into his system. 

"Never attribute to malice what is explained by ignorance".  I know it's
an old quote, but it's applicable here.

There is no "backdoor", merely buggy programs.  If an ISP dosn't know
enough to realise this.  Worse if they aren't in the habit of applying the
security patches before going live?  Change ISP's NOW.  RedHat is a static
snapshot of OS and applications at a point in time.  In the weeks
immediately after a release, they release patches to fix their mistakes.
As time goes on the release patches to fix other peoples mistakes.  A
standard part of the install process for ANY OS that is going to be
visible on the net involves applying that OS' security patches AT THE VARY
LEAST.

Linux has proven as secure as any other Unix, and signifigantly more
secure then MS.  It has the added advantage of rapid bug fixes when holes
are found.

As a good rule of thumb, the more people working on a distribution, the
better the security.  ("Given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow")
