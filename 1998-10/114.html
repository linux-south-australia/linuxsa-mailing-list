  Two inquiries...

  First i am not yet a Linux user but intend to install and test a system soon. The information in the Linux group Emails is very informative even as an onlooker. Would you recommend a book or books  on linux that contains not only the basics but info on problems that will likely be encountered real world situations. i am familiar with computer systems in general, having been in the business for over 20yrs. 

  Secondly  - Which Version and Security.

  i was talking to an ISP the other day who installed Red Hat Linux on his system only to have it almost immediately hacked. His impression was that one or more of the modules has a "backdoor" written into the program that allowed for easy entry into his system.
  

  The question arises - Is the above correct or likey? Have regularly users Linux found that it is secure, if so, to what extent? Are some versions more prone to this sort of problem than others? If some  versions of Linux have been developed by a small number of persons working together rather than by web users in general, are these versions likely to be more secure than others? Does the source codes availability add or detract from security issues?

  So taking the foregoing into account what versions would you recommend?


                          thanks, 

                             Mark Burrow
