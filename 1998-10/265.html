It's called running a business. Someone asks a question. I answer it.

If making a concerted effort at helping other Linux users get more from
their choice of OS is 'blatent advertising' then I suggest you either put
up with my posts, or un subscribe. I get no more from helping a Linux user
set-up their box for 4 hours than I do from setting up a win95 user over
the phone in 10 minutes. Financial gain = nothing.

There are many businesses that use their time and resources to help
ungrateful people such as yourself with absolutely no benefit and often a
cost. How about the software Netcraft donates to LinuxSA meetings, or the
badges that Cybernet Systems organized. How much does it cost to host the
LinuxSA site. Do you even have the slightest idea how much a megabyte of
data costs?

I don't often get annoyed by anyone saying anything about me or my
business, but you my friend, have hit a nerve. I am absolutely sick and
tired of people such as yourself preaching the do's and don't to people who
contribute to this project FINANCIALLY. Espousing your views without any
qualification as to who you are or why anyone should listen to your
opinions is not my idea of a helpful mailing list. 

&gt;Probably it's the adrenalin rush that one can get from doing something
&gt;naughty.

This sentence makes me wonder if openly discussing my opinions on this
matter is a waste of time. I can only suggest that if you want people to
take you seriously you'll have a better chance if you don't make stupid
comments. Think before you post.

&gt;The quasi-religous tone, explaining unnecessarily restrictive
&gt;conditions, also doesn't justify such a message.

Although this is a plain silly comment, and you missed the point of the
thread. I'll reiterate for you. People find it surprising that ISP's don't
offer shell access, and Daniel Callan hit the nail right on the head when
he explained that people just use them for irc and ftp. I backed up his
comment by pointing out that although we have shell access, it's not
useable for the previous protocols. You mis-interpreted it as me 'showing
my colours'. Well that's your loss not mine. Just think a bit more
carefully about my motivations before you reply. Running an ISP isn't about
'being in control' as you seem to think it is.

&gt;For the record, not all ISP's are hostile about shell accounts.

My point is proven. You misinterpreted my post. I am not 'hostile' about
shell access either. Cynical maybe, but then who isn't?

&gt;Guys, please do ask "who has X".  Other guys, please don't post your
&gt;commercial spams back to the list, reply privately.  You know how to
&gt;do it.

And David, for the last time PLEASE do not spam the list with your views on
cross-promotion, advertising, spam and kudos. I scroll back through this
list and find repeated postings of you attacking the people that make this
organization possible. If you really think that I benefit financially from
this list then feel free to come and look at my books. But for goodness
sake, don't just make assumptions that quite frankly offend me. I don't pay
a membership to this group, but if we discourage supportive businesses as
you do we may well have to.

Stick to what you are good at and what you know well. I'm always willing to
acknowledge good supportive help, and when it comes to your contribution to
this list, most of your e-mails provide encouraging and long detailed
explanations to problems that many other people only answer with only one
or two lines. I appreciate the extra effort it takes to write a multi
paragraph explanation to a problem, and really it's only mails like your
last one that I object to. I certainly don't think you'd appreciate it, if,
after all your contributions you got shot down in flames for mentioning the
Australian Unix and Open Systems Users Group (AUUG)
(<A HREF="http://www.auug.org.au">http://www.auug.org.au</A>). (This wouldn't happen, but it make help you
understand how I feel right now).

Please, before you reply with another post on advertising because you
consider it spam, just remember that many of the FINACIAL contributors to
this project, such as myself, see your posts as spam. It can get tiring
after a while.

In my opinion, stating that I offer service X and restrict it in Y and Z
ways  does not constitute blatant advertising. The lines about the
restrictions were to emphasize a point. If you disagree, well that is your
prerogative, but don't keep requesting that people use this list the way it
suits you best.

I've made it quite clear that I understand why you have said what you have
said, so it's probably not necessary to repeat your comments (I may be
wrong, in which case - go ahead.) In any case I'd prefer to take this up in
person next LinuxSA meeting. I still belive however that you have
misinterpreted my motivations. I'm just explaining how this offended me. It
not a request for a flame war, but I always love a good debate.

In fact I'm not even frowning  :o)

Cheers

Alex!
