&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just a reminder people,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is an installfest happening with the Adelaide PCUG,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow from 2:30 to 5:00 at
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible to come along and get help setting up my already-installed
&gt; &gt; &gt; RH5.1? Particularly help with dialing my ISP?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It would be preferable to leave any configuration of machines to either the
&gt; &gt; LinuxSA meeting on the 20th.  This is an Adelaide PCUG session, organised
&gt; &gt; by APCUG, and so I feel it would be a bit rude having LinuxSA members
&gt; &gt; bringing in their machines to be configured (possibly at the expense of
&gt; &gt; APCUG members.
&gt; 
&gt; fair enough...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Of course if you are a APCUG member then you could probably do something
&gt; &gt; like that.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Or alternatively if there is enough interest we can organise a
&gt; &gt; Config-Fest.  People can bring their machines along and have all
&gt; &gt; those niggling little problems worked out.
&gt; 
&gt; sounds like a good idea... I have had RH installed for quite some time,
&gt; and every now and then, I have a go at setting up ppp and customising
&gt; other things, but can't make much headway... This sort of thing would be a
&gt; bit of a Linux tutoring session... There are quite a number of things that
&gt; I'd love to know, but the basic set-up type things are the most
&gt; important...
&gt; 

Hear Hear I'm for any config-fest.  I've subscribed to this maillist
of a while and been lurking around alt.linux.* as well and finally
intstalled redhat 5.0 I bought 6 months ago. but I'm still a newbie 
to unix and linux and config'ing my new os.
