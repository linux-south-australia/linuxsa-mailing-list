&gt; here's me, trying to set up an IP-masq box for my dad's business, and I can't
&gt; seem to get *anything working! For a start, I simply can't connect linux to
&gt; ozemail. I can in windows. For seconds, I can't get the other machines on the
&gt; network to ping the linux box. (This also works in windows, so it's not a
&gt; hardware fault.) 

ok firstly I know people that can connect their linux boxen to ozemail
so it can be done :) all I can say is check it is not doing anything
wierd like compuserve does, with compuserve (my dad uses them for work
and I have to do all his tech support *grumble*) you have to send a
&lt;cr&gt; before starting the verification proccess and the verification
proccess is done with bit setting 7P2 then switches to 8N1 before
allowing you to start PPP.


&gt; The win95 machines all have tcp/ip installed, all of which are bound to their
&gt; network cards, and they all have their own IP-numbers as set out in the
&gt; IP-Masq howot, and have the linux box as the gateway etc etc. I've never set
&gt; up a network in linux before, so there's probably something I'm missing...it
&gt; detects the card at startup etc etc. ( NE*000...it's a clone but it seems to
&gt; work.) 

Before you try any networking with the linux box check the current
firewall rules with: ipfwadm -Il
		     ipfwadm -Ol
		     ipfwadm -Fl
		     ipfwadm -Ml
you need to run each on seperatly as ipfwadm will not allow you to
check more the one stream at a time. Next if the defaults are deny
change them to accpet (if you want to set up a firewall then let your
rule script change this) with:  ipfwadm -Ip accept
				ipfwadm -Op accept
				ipfwadm -Fp accept
				ipfwadm -Mp accept
this means it will accept all connections. then you need to check that
the netcard is actually there, just run ifconfig and see that eth0 is
there, if not the you will need to manually set it up. for this
example I will use 192.168.105.76 as the machines ip and 192.168.105.0
as the network:

ifconfig eth0 192.168.105.76 braodcast 192.168.105.255 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
route add -net 192.168.105.0

As this box will be the gateway it doesn't need a default gateway yet,
that will happen when you get ppp working.
	

				
&gt; Sendmail hangs(?) at boot up, and I seem to remember a post to the effect of
&gt; that meaning a problem with your network setup...I set the card up at install
&gt; time, by giving it an ip number and letting it fill in the rest itself. 

check that /etc/resolv.conf contains the correct entry for your
nameserver and the problem should disappear.


&gt; And then there's the ozemail problem...got me stumped there. I connected to it
&gt; from minicom to see if all the prompts in my script were right, did alt-q
&gt; whewn the ppp garble started and then exited to start pppd /dev/modem & (is
&gt; that enough?)
yeah it's fine. personaly I perfer to give it the speed aswell but
that is optional.
