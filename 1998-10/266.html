&gt;In my opinion, stating that I offer service X and restrict it in Y and Z

Especially when you consider the fact that Aone/Ozemail, CCA and BigPond
would just love the ISP game to be a 3-man contest.
I consider seeing Steve Bisley crap on about his "virtual office" on
a multi-million dollar slogan (which says nada about their service anyway)
to be "blatant advertising". 
(not to mention a waste of public shares ;-)

With exception to the standard "blood-feuds" that opposing pairs of ISPs can
sometimes get into, I think ALL the small/medium ISPs should be sticking
together and being as supportive as we can be. The clients are all shopping
around these days anyway ("plan-jumping" as I call it), so why should we
bother getting shirty about touting whatever features we have available?
(MOHO anyway :)

It's not like Alex (or I) put up our price-lists on the post. :P

In fact, if you really want someone to go after, try Ozemail.
Has anyone else here got a handful of users who turn on their
Win95 computers once a month and find all their network settings
have reverted to the ones from those damn freebie cd's reg entries?
(10 *free hrs -- free when you sign up for 1000 paid-for hrs)

That makes me a lot more livid than reading Alex's (more than sensible)
restrictions to shell access.

Appologies for the rant people, but I just don't see the ISP scene
as a "First, Second and Third" sort of race. (So why trip the other guy?)

My thoughts,
-Daniel
