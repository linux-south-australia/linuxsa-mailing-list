Hi guys...
'scuse the typing, but I'm telnetting from NSW and it's too slow to correct
typo's!

here's me, trying to set up an IP-masq box for my dad's business, and I can't
seem to get *anything working! For a start, I simply can't connect linux to
ozemail. I can in windows. For seconds, I can't get the other machines on the
network to ping the linux box. (This also works in windows, so it's not a
hardware fault.) 

The win95 machines all have tcp/ip installed, all of which are bound to their
network cards, and they all have their own IP-numbers as set out in the
IP-Masq howot, and have the linux box as the gateway etc etc. I've never set
up a network in linux before, so there's probably something I'm missing...it
detects the card at startup etc etc. ( NE*000...it's a clone but it seems to
work.) 

Sendmail hangs(?) at boot up, and I seem to remember a post to the effect of
that meaning a problem with your network setup...I set the card up at install
time, by giving it an ip number and letting it fill in the rest itself. 

And then there's the ozemail problem...got me stumped there. I connected to it
from minicom to see if all the prompts in my script were right, did alt-q
whewn the ppp garble started and then exited to start pppd /dev/modem & (is
that enough?)
