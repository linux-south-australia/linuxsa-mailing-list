Hi Brenton,
It appears you don't have DNS resolution working for you.  Try
creating/changing your /etc/resolv.conf as follows:

# ------- /etc/resolv.conf ----------------------
search  camtech.net.au
nameserver 203.5.73.2
nameserver 203.5.73.1
# ------- /etc/resolv.conf ----------------------

regards .. Don

&gt; Subject: What's wrong with my network configuration.?
&gt; Date: Tuesday, 20 October 1998 20:05
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been persevering for some considerable time now trying to setup
&gt; internet services with Redhat 5.1 with only partial success. The problem
&gt; is that I am able to send and receive mail and to access newsgroups but
&gt; otherwise unable to see past my service provider's home page
&gt; (camtech.net.au).
&gt; 
&gt; I have tried diligently to do my homework before seeking help to the
&gt; extent that in addition to Redhat specific documentation I have read all
&gt; the Linux networking How-To's. However, I have found that to the
&gt; uninitiated new Linux user the volume of information not to mention the
&gt; version and shell differences and the predominantly Ethernet coverage
&gt; has left me very confused as to the correct configuration for my
&gt; standalone Intel PC internet connection.
&gt; 
&gt; My service provider's help desk, who does not officially provide
&gt; technical support for the Linux O/S, advised me to edit auto
&gt; configuration for proxy.camtech.net.au under advanced preferences in
&gt; Netscape Navigator and that would fix the problem. The Netscape 4.05
&gt; version that comes in  Redhat 5.1 does not have this option as does my
&gt; version under Win95. If  the proxy is the answer to my problem I suspect
&gt; it has to be configured in a specific Linux network file somewhere.?
&gt; 
&gt; For the record I have a dynamic PPP connection (ppp 2.3.3-6). My kernel
&gt; is 2.0.35-1 and I am trying to configure using the Network Configurator
&gt; that comes with X Windows.I log into my service provider as root.
&gt; 
&gt; My current configuration settings are as follows;
&gt; 
&gt; hostname=localhost.localdomain
&gt; domain=camtech.net.au
&gt; nameserver=203.5.73.2
&gt;           =203.5.73.1
&gt; host IP=127.0.0.1
&gt; host name=localhost
&gt; interface=ppp0
&gt; nickname=localhost.local.domain
&gt; routing=no entries
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; *PPP and modem have been configured as part of the network configuration
&gt; process.  
&gt; 
&gt; I note that there are a number of networking files in /etc/ppp,
&gt; some reflecting my above configuration,but I am unsure which, if
&gt; any, I need to edit to rectify the problem.
&gt; 
&gt; I would be most grateful for help with the above network problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt;
