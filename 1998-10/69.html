&gt; &gt; &gt; Just a reminder people,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is an installfest happening with the Adelaide PCUG, 
&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow from 2:30 to 5:00 at 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Is it possible to come along and get help setting up my already-installed
&gt; &gt; RH5.1? Particularly help with dialing my ISP?
&gt; 
&gt; It would be preferable to leave any configuration of machines to either the
&gt; LinuxSA meeting on the 20th.  This is an Adelaide PCUG session, organised
&gt; by APCUG, and so I feel it would be a bit rude having LinuxSA members
&gt; bringing in their machines to be configured (possibly at the expense of
&gt; APCUG members.  

fair enough...

&gt; 
&gt; Of course if you are a APCUG member then you could probably do something
&gt; like that.
&gt; 
&gt; Or alternatively if there is enough interest we can organise a 
&gt; Config-Fest.  People can bring their machines along and have all
&gt; those niggling little problems worked out.

sounds like a good idea... I have had RH installed for quite some time,
and every now and then, I have a go at setting up ppp and customising
other things, but can't make much headway... This sort of thing would be a
bit of a Linux tutoring session... There are quite a number of things that
I'd love to know, but the basic set-up type things are the most
important...
