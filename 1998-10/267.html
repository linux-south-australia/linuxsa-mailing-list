Alex,

I do have a bee in my bonnet about public replies which should have
been sent in private, and frankly I especially expect ISPs to need
no reminder about what forum is appropriate and what is not.  On the
other hand I did wonder, before sending my message, if the point you
were making was the why or why not of shell accounts, or if you were
merely taking the opportunity to parade your name at everyone else's
expense.  Obviously I concluded it was the latter, although I confess
that I had doubts.  Comments about running a business, which is what
you just said, do give the appearance that your motive was to advertise;
that is what offended me.  By all means run a business and certainly
that means you should answer the question that was asked.  I certainly
did.  I still think that if you are just going to answer the question,
there is no need to make us all pay to receive that answer.  I do "have
the slightest idea how much a megabyte of data costs."

None the less, you were clearly upset by my comment and I see you
found it harsh and unreasonable; and we all have seen others express
support for you; and I see that you were explaining why shell accounts
are often not offered.  I have admitted that I had doubts about sending
my message and I would now rather that I had not.  I can't unsend it,
but I can apologise, and I do so.  I'm sorry for causing you upset.
There is no excuse, but if you have the slightest interest in why I was
so abrasive, it probably was a combination of that bee in my bonnet
in conjunction with sleep deprivation.

Alex, I do apologise to you.  I accept that your message was not one of
those public "me too"'s which so often plague mailing lists.

Regards,

David.
