&gt; The following message was posted to public LI lists by maddog. You might 
&gt; like to pass this on to linuxsa. Note that maddog is not actually using 
&gt; the best Linux trademark note in his .sig, it is supposed to read "...in 
&gt; many countries" or similar.

&gt; Subject: Compaq's support of Linux
&gt; 
&gt; On Tuesday, September 15th, 1998 in Paris, France at our user event named 
&gt; "Eureka", and again on October 5th at DECUS in Los Angeles, Compaq Computer
&gt; Corporation announced intent to extend their support to the Linux(R) operating
&gt; system to include Intel as well as the Alpha platforms.  In addition to
&gt; extending this support to another architecture, Compaq is in the process of
&gt; putting together a comprehensive program of Linux support.
&gt; 
&gt; This support includes, but is not limited to:
&gt; 
&gt; 	o working with the Linux community to port Linux to new platforms		o 
&gt; qualification of Linux on both Intel and Alpha platforms
&gt; 	o providing selected platforms with no license, specifically for Linux
&gt; 	  and other freely available operating systems
&gt; 	o working with the Linux community and distributions to provide
&gt;           world-wide telephone and hardware support
&gt; 	o porting selected Compaq software products to both Intel and Alpha
&gt; 	  platforms
&gt; 
&gt; In continuing the concept of working with the Linux community, Compaq intends
&gt; to extend its Linux support through its extensive channels partner programs.
&gt; Compaq feels that this will give the broadest possible selection of products
&gt; and solutions to our end customers, with our VARs, OEMs, Distributors and
&gt; Resellers working with the customer to match the distribution, the layered
&gt; products and third party offerings to that customer's needs.
&gt; 
&gt; While it will take a little while for this program to be put into complete
&gt; action, there has been a lot of excitement inside Compaq since this decision
&gt; was announced by John Rose, Vice President of Compaq, at our European User's
&gt; event.  Indeed both Compaq and one of our channel partners, Hallmark, showed
&gt; a licenseless AlphaServer 800 machine qualified for the Alpha Linux operating
&gt; system at ISPcon in San Jose this month.
&gt; 
&gt; Warmest regards,
&gt;
