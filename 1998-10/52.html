&gt;The reason Unix continues to perform so badly in the desktop market, &gt;despite

&gt;them our encouragement.

&gt;Remember: we might have God on our side, but Microsoft has applications &gt;on
&gt;their's.

This can't go unanswered... This is the big myth that holds us back. Linux is
very applications rich indeed. Go have a look. We have available to us any
number of office-like systems, both free and non-free (though the non-free
ones are incredibly cheap.) We have lists miles long of applications of all
sorts. Have a look at freshmeat, the KDE site, or just plain do a search.
Maybe we don't have a wealth of *CAD* applications, but it is drawing a long
bow to extrapolate from that statement that unix is applications poor.

If you are seriously looking for applications to run under Linux and are
having trouble finding them, ask in this forum and maybe we can help you find
some :) For my part I use my Linux box as a desktop for my family plus running
the books for a small superannuation fund and a small organisation. It
completely fills the desktop need for me, for both business and family uses.

Cheers,

Bruce Moffatt
