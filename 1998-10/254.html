&gt;Can I have a rough show of hands as to who wants some mugs and how many. If
&gt;we have a general interest I'll make a bulk order. If we get more that 12
&gt;ordered, the per unit cost is less than US$12 each, which is around $19.
&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm using US$0.56 as a converter.

Of course, as pointed out, the other option is to do them ourselves. It
would cost around $4.00 per mug with a minimum order of 72.

Couple of points. We could either do our own vi reference mug, providing
the original creator doesn't mind, or we could do something different, like
a LinuxSA mug or something. I prefer the second option, cause the first
isn't very original, there's already one out there, and I'd prefer to
support the guy who's already done all the work. he second option however,
doesn't conflict with any other user group's projects if we make it LinuxSA
specific. Of course we could always just do a Generic 'Linux rocks' kind of
mug similar to the linux badges.

I'd be happy to work on any mug proposals though. Comments?

(I'll still go ahead with the vi mugs even if we do aonther mug project as
well, provided I get at least 12 orders. :o) )

Cheers

Alex!
