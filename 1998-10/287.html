On returning from a very very late dinner to my office with a work mate
yesterday evening. I noticed a security guard gaining access to our
building. He was not our usual security guy, but he had front door keys,
lift keys and security codes. One thing I did notice though, was that he
was from a security company that is well known for providing after hours
access to server rooms and network infrastructures.

As we are *not* the only "Network Provider" in this building, I asked him
what he was doing, and he explained that he was actually "the guy" who did
security for all the local University computer networks and another client
of his company's was in my building.

I figured out who it was and was quite impressed that this company could
afford the uni security people to do work for them. The guy who runs the
place in question doesn't often impress me as the only time I really talk
to him is when he comes down to preach the wonders of Windows NT to me.
He's convinced that the future of Network Computing is NT and loves to tell
me how I'm "wasting my time with all this UNIX and Linux stuff". I've never
really worked out how he manages to use NT on a dial-in box. I've heard
horror stories about the processor loads involved.

I soon found out though. After chatting with the security guy, I found out
that he was an integral part of their NT Network Solution.

He get's paid $45 to come in and reboot the NT machines after hours. He
does it a lot.

Tee Hee

Alex!

(P.S. Funny that I've never heard a Microsoft sales rep mention the
security guard bit.)

With WindowsNT, I always felt limited by the software available.
         With UNIX, I am limited only by my knowledge.
