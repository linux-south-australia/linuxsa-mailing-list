Ben
I was hoping someone might answer your question for my benefit
as well! In case there isn't a better answer

for additions I use psql or pgaccess which work fine.
unfortunately they don't help much with alterations yet because
postgreSQL is still missing key ALTER TABLE capabilities.
a table often has to be dropped & recreated at the very least
I think pgaccess will be more capable once postgreSQL has
this ability.

I therefore frequently find myself doing a 
1. pg_dump
2. vi the changes to the dump
3. destroydb, createdb
4. psql the edited dump back in.
not pretty but only takes a minute and preserves any test data
I've populated it with

For quick queries/and playing with test data I sometimes use
MSACCESS or MSQUERY (shame on me) using the ODBC driver
for windows. Also I have in the past built the database
and queries with MSACCESS, then ported it across to postgreSQL.
I'm using JAVA RMI & JDBC so for me this has the advantage that
I end up with two database implementations
1. JET where the database needs to live on a windows box &
2. postgreSQL for users with access to a unix box.

It should be possible however to use anyone of a number of
tools that output SQL CREATE statements, which you of course
would feed into psql. I've been meaning to have an explore
but not got around to it because
1. although convoluted the above is quite quick and works
2. there are a lot of schema tools which could take quite a while
   to properly assess
3. there are still some significant missing bits in postgreSQL
   like the lack of outer joins, which may limit which capapabilities
   you can use

But like I said I'd be most interested if you turn up something.

Regards
Adrian
