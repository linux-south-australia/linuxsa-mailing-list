Hi everyone,

I am writing this email on behalf of a local software house that attended
the RMS talk on the 24th. They are interested in producing Linux versions
of their software range (a complete CAD package of comparable if not
higher quality than AutoCAD) but have a few questions they would like
answers to first. I have already supplied basic answers but I lack the
experience to answer in real detail. Could people please spare the time to
answer one or more of these questions it would be appreciated, as Linux
needs a high quality, low cost package like this.

&gt; 1. The cost and availability of the "word" and "excel" replacements
&gt; 2. Is a Fortran compiler available? And if so is any cost involved.
&gt; 3. Is the X-Window library readily available, cost?
&gt; 4. The C-compiler is available, cost?
&gt; 5. Is a Linker available?

If anyone has had any positive/negative experiences in developing/porting
software along these lines for Linux comments would be useful.
Also if people could comment on their level of interest (profession and
personal) in seeing a high quality CAD package being released for Linux.

Could all responses please be sent directly to me unless you feel that
your answers/comments are of interest to others.

Thanks in advance...
Nick Stock

removed the company name because at this stage they have merle
