Here is a very interesting followup to this, I just had a power failure
(doh) and now it has started queueing the mail again!

I had previously done a killall sendmail, made sure they were all dead,
then restarted it, as it is started in /etc/rc.d, to no avail.

Can anyone think why the reboot did the trick? What else could be causing
this?

I'd be horrified to think that I had to reboot my Linux for anything less
than a hardware/kernel upgrade :)

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; 
&gt; I have a minor problem with my home linux box (which is otherwise great,
&gt; 60 days of uptime :), which is sendmail does not queue mail up if I am not
&gt; online.
&gt; 
&gt; It sends OK, if I am connected at the time.
&gt; 
&gt; When I try to send a mail while offline, it just locks, it never seems to
&gt; timeout and queue it.
&gt; 
&gt; Trouble is, this used to work! It used to queue immediately and send as
&gt; soon as I went online.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas as to what to look for?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a domain name and a static IP, if it makes a difference. Incoming
&gt; and outgoing is SMTP.
