&gt; I've installed RedHat 5.0 on an old 486 with a 200Mb hard drive so that I
&gt; could have a look at the Linux O/S. To start working on the Linux machine I
&gt; need a simple text editor similar to TextPad - my favourite Windows text
&gt; editor.
&gt; 
&gt; I looked at vi, Emacs and Joe. For someone brought up on Windows wysiwyg
&gt; software I found vi and Emacs just awful. vi was just too difficult to use,
&gt; and Emacs is almost as difficult as vi and it's size [16Mb] takes up far too
&gt; much room on my limited hard drive. I don't have the time, and I'm not
&gt; willing to invest the effort needed to master these editors. I just need a
&gt; glorified typewriter.

Hi Steve,

Tim Aslat suggested pico, which is the simplest editor I know of.  If
you don't have it installed already, you should be able to do so by:

(insert your Red Hat 5.0 CD)
mount /mnt/cdrom
rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/pine-*

The big warning with pico is that if you use it for editing system
configuration files, you really should use the -w switch, ie.:

pico -w whatever

If you don't use -w, then you are very likely to corrupt files that
have long lines, since pico likes to wrap them unless you tell it not
to (that is, with the -w switch).

If you're looking for an X editor, take a look at nedit.  The
description in the package located at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/contrib/hurricane/i386/nedit-5.0pl3-1.i386.rpm">ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/contrib/hurricane/i386/nedit-5.0pl3-1.i386.rpm</A>
says:

  NEdit is a GUI style plain-text editor for X/Motif systems.
  It is very easy to use, especially for those familiar
  with the Macintosh or MS Windows style of interface, combining
  full use of the mouse and window manager, with keystroke efficiency and a
  full complement of powerful editing commands.

If you're just looking for a glorified typewriter, I don't see what
the problem is with vi though.  Two reasons (in addition to what David
Newall said):

1) There is a tutorial included which should only take about half an
hour to go through.  To do it, type:

cp /usr/doc/vim-*/tutor/tutor .
vi tutor

2) If you create a file called '.exrc' containing the one line:
set bs=2
then you can use vi as a normal editor if you just press 'i' when you
first load up a file, then press either:
ESC ZZ  to save and quit
ESC :q!  to quit without saving

The problem with reason 2 is that it relies on features only found in
vim, so your "vi" skills won't be portable to a "real" vi.
