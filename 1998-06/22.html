&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions as to the next step in learning Linux?
&gt; So far I can load it, configure it, get Netscape to work but now I need to
&gt; go further.   Something like data base, wordprocessing, spreadsheet would
&gt; be interesting.   Any suggestions greatly appreciated.
&gt; 
Well the real question is ``Where do you want to go?''.  What do you want
to be able to do with your computer in one/two/three year's time?

Otherwise, do you have some problem that you would like to see solved?
Use linux, especially if it isn't too urgent.  The best way to learn linux
is to solve problems with it.  The tools are there to do almost everything
you might want to do, so find a problem and start working towards a
solution.

If you need an office suite, consider Applixware, or StarOffice.  If
document processing is more your thing, checkout LaTeX, Lyx, and SGML.

Otherwise if you're just spinning your wheels, I'd suggest you learn
shell scripting, perl, and either tcl or python.  As these tools are
typical components in most linux based solutions to problems.

If you want to learn more details about Linux/Unix, consider picking up a
little C.  While it may not be directly useful for you immediately, a
basic reading/conceptual level of C programming is a useful asset when
dealing with stickier problems.  (of course this is by no means essential,
I'd suggest shell/perl/[tcl|python] would be far more useful for the
average user)

Anyway, all IMHO.
