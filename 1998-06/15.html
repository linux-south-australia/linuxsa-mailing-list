Hi,

I had a similar problem although it was on a sVr4 system.  The rteld
kept dying for no reason, so we ended up running a cron job every 2
minutes to check it and restart it.  Rough I know, but hey, it worked.

	Subject:  Mystery of the disappearing route

	Hi All,

	I setup RedHat 5.0 on my new PC, which surfs the net via my 486
running
	slackware and IP masq. All works fine.

	However, it sometimes forgets the default route! I thought I
must have
	configured something wrong, but tonight I booted it up, ran
'route' to
	confirm the default route was there, switched consoles and
telnetted to
	uni. No problem.

	About 3 minutes later the telnet dropped out, I go back to the
first
	console and run route again, sure enough, the default route is
gone!
	This has happened a few times, I'm thinking it's pretty
consistent.

	If I run 'route add default gw tardis' manually, it comes back
up, and it
	seems to stay up, but I'm not 100% sure on that as yet.

	Any clues?

		- Justin
