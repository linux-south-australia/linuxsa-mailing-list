OK, from what i have gather (which is very little due to time constraints
and exam study) the following, (please correct if wrong):

That Beowulf is a way for linux to process information using both the
servers processor and any processor that is connected to it.
[Q] Does the connected machine need to be altered to allow it?

RedHat is working on this presently?
[Q]So is the clustering type stuff being done using 3rd party software? Or
the kernal

The US government has decided that it alone wants supercomputing power and
is trying to whack restrictions on this.
[Q]Will we have to get the stuff from else where now?
And that they wish to redefine a super computer from 7000 TOPS to 2000 TOPS
(a standard PII300 or is it 333 is at 1000).
[Q]Will we there fore be stuck with reduced quality machines when the intel
PII-700-XEON chips are released (1999-2000) sometime?

Can i today atm. turn my little 386 into a beowulf server to enable it to
use my P150 when win is not processing much?

Thanx for clearing this up, and yor suggestions!

Malcolm.
