Hi All,
    I've got a few problems I'm hoping LinuxSA can help me solve.

Problems:
----------

1&gt; Since upgrading to redhat 5.1 (from 5.0) everytime I login at the
console I get a line like:
    PAM_pwdb[596]: (login) session opened for user benjsc by  (uid=0)
    PAM_pwdb[596]: LOGIN ON tty1 by benjsc

It only ever appears on the console. How do I get rid of it! (it bugs me
:P)

2&gt; The otherday netscape deceided to kill all my email - during a
compress it stuffed up (bummer hey). So In an effort to just get it
working again I just scrapped all my mail, all folders and all summary
files to do with it. Alas it will not work correctly. Problems consist
of not being able to delete any email, moving email to another folder
does nothing and even if I manage to get rid of the mail it will
reappear next time I start netscape. (Weird)

3&gt; I was hoping upgrading to rh5.1 would fix it but it didn't. I still
have a problem with CTR+ALT+F3 under X.
I just can't switch to it! (that is tty3) I can switch to all the other
tty's but not 3. However, once Im in console mode I can use ALT+F3. I
have tried a minimal X setup. Ie created a new user, removed all
.Xdefaults and stuff like that and just typed X to get the server and it
seams that it doesn't even work in that. Any ideas?

Questions:
-----------
1&gt; I'm going to be setting up a mailing list soon and would like some
advice as to which application to use. Ie easiest to maintain, setup
that sort of stuff.

2&gt; Anyone know of some good BBS software for linux?

3&gt; What was the results for the cheapest/best permanent online
connection to the internet?

4&gt; Has anyone had experiance setting up 4dos & dosemu's autoexec.bat,
config.sys redirection?

5&gt; Is the earth still round? :)
