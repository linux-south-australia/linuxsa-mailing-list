&gt;Hi .. I have loaded a copy of RED Hat 5 on a machine which has an east I/O
&gt;card in it .
&gt;i have downloaded the driver file from stallion . only thing is what do I
&gt;do with the file now to install it ,  my LINUX knowledge is almost nil  ..

I'm not 100% sure that RedHat will be the same but on Slackware 2.0.x
it is as thus:

Install the package (tar.gz, tgz, etc) to a dir hanging off /usr/src
(or somewhere similar) and you have three choices:

1: Compile the driver into the kernel

2: Compile the driver as a kernel module ("modprobe stallion")

3: Compile the drivfer as a standalone module 
("insmod /[location of stal src]/stallion")

I have found all methods to work effectively, however the modular
options are a bit easier.

The INSTALL file explains how to do each of these kinds of installs,
but I'll give you a quick overview:

[common to all installs]

copy the *.h files to "/usr/include/linux"
(or "/usr/include/linux/include/linux/" depending how your symlinks work)

Edit the appropriate *.c file (stallion.c or istallion.c)
For a 32 port models (I have ECH-32's over here) you edit
the stallion.c file.

Editing instructions are within the file.

************************************************************
*NB* Important that you declare TWO io-addresses for the card
*(that one had me recompiling for a week :-o)
************************************************************

cp the two "*.c" files to "/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/"

[For kernel inst OR kernel module]

Do a standard kernel re-build and under "Character devices" choose
the stallion card you have (it will list both) as EITHER:
DRIVER	or
MODULE

Compile as per normal.

[if kern module]
Make sure the "modprobe stallion" [or] "modprobe istallion" command is in
the /etc/rc.d/rc.modules (that bit might be slackware only... not sure)

[for standalone module]

Within the stallion driver src dir:

run "make module" and that will build a "stallion" binary in that dir.

Copy this binary to where ever you want to run it from and include
in your "rc.d" (startup) files the "insmod /location/stallion" command.

[ reboot to see if it worked ]

PS: If you are getting weird symptoms, try compiling up the
"stlstats" binary that comes in the driver pack.
(It views the status of ANY panels currently connected)

Hope this helps,
-Daniel
