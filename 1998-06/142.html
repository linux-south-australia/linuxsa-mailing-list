&gt; [Q] Does the connected machine need to be altered to allow it?

No, you just need some decent networking hardware to get good performance,
depending on what your using the cluster for.

&gt; RedHat is working on this presently?

They just packaged it and sell it on cdrom. Supposedly MOSIX is being
ported to linux in connection with Red Hat, but that is different.

&gt; [Q]So is the clustering type stuff being done using 3rd party software? Or
&gt; the kernal

The system is just a heap of software to help develop highly paralellized
distributed programs. You can't just hook up 10 computers and use them
transparently. There are some kernel patches as well.

&gt; The US government has decided that it alone wants supercomputing power and
&gt; is trying to whack restrictions on this.

This is yet another example of an ancient law which no longer has any real
meaning... (ditto crypto "munitions"). It cripples them and they don't get
any real benifit.
