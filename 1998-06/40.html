&gt; 
&gt; I know that the upcoming Pine 4.0 will have LDAP support.
&gt; 
&gt; FYI I am trying to find a Unix mail client that will
&gt; work with exchange server and access the Exchange Address

&gt; 
&gt; I know of a couple of X clients, but no curses clients.

J Street anyClient Announced

Harrison, New York, June 2, 1998  InnoVal Systems Solutions
announced today that it will release "J Street anyClient" in August.
Written completely in Java, anyClient provides significant new
function for almost anyone who uses a POP3 client for Internet email.

J Street anyClient is designed to work with MR2/Ice, PMMail for OS/2,
PMMail for Windows, Post Road Mailer, Netscape, Ultimail Lite,
Eudora, Eudora Pro, Outlook, Pine, J Street Mailer and most other
POP3 email clients.

J Street anyClient provides the following useful services for anyone
who uses email:

1) automatic time-interval and manual mail retrieval from one or more
email accounts to a local queue. Mail can be read into a mail client at
local disk speeds. Internet connection is not needed when
retrieving email to your client email program if the mail has already
been retrieved from your accounts' email servers and placed in the
queue. The mail client does need to be running for mail retrieval to
local queues.

2) many-to-one and one-to-many email mapping. At the simplest level
you can map messages from multiple accounts into a single client-side
account. With filters, you can move email from one account to another
client-side account. Customers with virtual domains can divide email
addressed to numerous people, when collected under a single virtual pop
account. Users who participate in mailing lists can create client-side
accounts for each mailing list.

3) list and peek at email on a POP3 or an IMAP4 server. Email can be
selectively read without downloading, downloaded for your mail
client, or deleted. Being able to delete mail without downloading is
particularly useful for removing obvious spams and getting rid of
"stuck" messages. Reading messages while leaving them on a POP3 or
IMAP4 server is also useful for checking office mail from home or
while away from your primary email client machine. 

4) detail or summary retrieval logs showing you when your email was
retrieved from one or more accounts. Logs also show failed attempts
due to timeouts and down conditions. 

5) advanced filters may be used to move or copy email between
client-side accounts, to send automatic replies, to forward email to
another email address, to notify an email address that a message has
been received (useful for email-enabled pagers and cell phones), to
trap spam, to alert you through audio sounds that a critical or
watched-for email has arrived, and to isolate web-generated forms
from email clients into separate directories for separate processing.
Six types of filters are supported:

- String argument filters

- List filters - Banned domain filters (a client or server-based file
may be used) - Banned phrases and words filter (e.g. "BULK EMAIL WORKS")
- Setable spam rules filters such as no To-header or high percent of
uppercase characters - "Write-your-own" filter classes in Java

People with a rudimentary knowledge of Java may create filter
classes. These work with a series of preset variables (e.g. from,
subject, body, etc.) so that no file reading or writing is necessary. A
sample script is provided along with instructions for implementing your
own filters.

6) IMAP4 to POP3 conversion in J Street anyClient allows users to
access IMAP4 accounts as though they were POP3. J Street anyClient is
especially useful for people using POP3-only email clients who need to
access IMAP4 servers that do not accept POP3 commands.

J Street anyClient is expected to have an introductory price of
$20.00 when it is released. Significant academic, site, and volume
discounts will be available. Java 1.1 for OS/2, Windows 95/98/NT,
Solaris, Linux, AIX, etc. is required to run anyClient.
