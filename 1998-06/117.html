&gt; This one's been bugging me as well.  If I run `netdate` it shows up as time
&gt; relative to GMT, but a `date` shows the actual time.

Unix systems maintain time of day using an interrupt driven counter.
They do not use the hardware real time clock, other than to initialise
the value of that counter.  This counter is the "Unix clock".

The Unix clock counts seconds since Midnight, January 1, 1970 and is
maintained in UTC (also known as GMT).  Hence, at 9:30am on January 1,
1970 (Adelaide time), the Unix clock would read 0.

The Unix clock only runs at UTC.  Some Unixes understand that the
hardware real time clock might run in a different timezone, and take
that into account, but the Unix clock is always UTC.  Programs which
display the time in a format like "Wed Jun 24 13:55:07 CST 1998" do so
by converting the Unix clock using the ctime libary calls.  With these
calls you have more or less two options: You can display in UTC, or you
can display in "local time".  Conversion to "local time" relies on an
environment variable, "TZ".  This environment variable describes the
"local" timezone, but note it can be different from process to process.

The TZ variable originally descibed the timezone as the timezone mnemonic,
followed by the number of hours west of GMT, and optionally ending with
the mnemonic used during daylight saving.  The TZ variable for Adelaide,
then, could be CST-9:30CST, meaning that we are 9.5 hours east of
Greenwich, and that daylight saving does apply during the summer months.
This usage of TZ is still supported, and if you want to try it:

        linux% TZ=WST-7:00wst date
	Wed Jun 24 11:25:07 WST 1998

will display the current time in Perth.


Two "recent" changes are: The inclusion of milisecond accuracy to the
Unix clock, which affects approximately nothing of what I've said;
and customisable timezone rules, which permit accurate description of
timezone changes (such as for daylight saving.)  These rules describe
minute details for a specific timezone.  They are compiled using zic,
and the TZ environment variable names the file for your local timezone.
Hence:

	linux% TZ=Europe/Moscow date
	Wed Jun 24 08:25:07 MSD 1998

If you don't have a TZ environment variable defined the system will use
some "local default", which obviously would have been installed when you
setup your Unix.

So finally!, and in summary, a time displayed in GMT is the same time as
for CST, the difference is the decision on whether or not to display in
local time.
