&gt; 1&gt; Since upgrading to redhat 5.1 (from 5.0) everytime I login at the

&gt;     PAM_pwdb[596]: LOGIN ON tty1 by benjsc

&gt; It only ever appears on the console. How do I get rid of it! (it bugs me
&gt; :P)

Have a look for the line in /etc/syslog.conf which sends the messages to
/dev/console and comment it out with a '#'. Red Hat 4.2 had a line like:
kern.*          /dev/console

Run "killall -HUP syslogd" to get syslog to reread its config file.

I don't have any experience with netscape mail, so I can't help here...

&gt; 3&gt; I was hoping upgrading to rh5.1 would fix it but it didn't. I still

It may be a keyboard problem. Some older keyboards (and newer I guess)
don't like certain keys pressed together. If there is happening you can't
hold Ctrl+Alt+F3. Different keyboards have different limitations.

This sort of problem can often be seen under old multiplayer dos games.
Trying to fit 2 ppl on a keyboard & getting it to work properly meant
finding 2 sets of keys which don't conflict.

&gt; 1&gt; I'm going to be setting up a mailing list soon and would like some
&gt; advice as to which application to use. Ie easiest to maintain, setup
&gt; that sort of stuff.

You could have a look at Majordomo, that seems to be pretty popular.
Also I hear qmail (replacement for sendmail) makes it easy for users to
set up their own mailing list, but I haven't used it before.

&gt; 2&gt; Anyone know of some good BBS software for linux?

You can find a bunch of bbs systems under 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/bbs/">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/bbs/</A>
I don't know how good they are tho', haven't used them.

&gt; 3&gt; What was the results for the cheapest/best permanent online
&gt; connection to the internet?

I went looking a while ago and found the cheapest for my situation was
Telstra.

Permanent modem
$500 setup fee
19c/meg [minimum of $20/month]
  OR
$350/month unlimited data (ouch)

Note: Telstra defines 1meg to be 1000000 bytes, I wonder why... :)

This doesn't include other costs like phone line installation/rent
($11.65/month) or dns cost. You can get a domain under ml.org for free,
tho'.

Connect.com is only affordable for ISPs and the like, last time I checked. 
Optus are very secretive about their service. Also, from what I have
experienced with the uni connection their service is extremely poor with
lots of network outages. 

<A HREF="http://www.telstra.net">http://www.telstra.net</A> has more info.

&gt; 4&gt; Has anyone had experiance setting up 4dos & dosemu's autoexec.bat,
&gt; config.sys redirection?

I've set up a few systems like that. Plain dos is unbearable, at least
with dosemu I can alias unix commands to something similar. The trick is
to add a couple of lines to your /etc/dosemu.conf:
EmuSys EMU
EmuBat EMU

Now whenever dos tries to access autoexec.bat it gets autoexec.emu. Ditto
config.sys -&gt; config.emu. In the *.emu put the setup you want to use under
dosemu. It is pretty much the same as a normal dos config except you use a
couple of drivers that come with dosemu instead (and not the dos
equivalents). To get 4dos add "shell=c:\4dos\4dos.com c:\4dos /e:512 /p"
to the config.emu.

Note that the .emu extensions are really only useful for when dosemu has
direct access to the dos partition (and boots from it). You could just use
a dosemu boot disk. Once you are happy with the boot disk you can copy it
to a disk image under /var/lib/dosemu. After you have finished booting
from the diskimage run "bootoff" to allow access to the floppy normally.

This is my prefered method since I like to let dosemu access the dos
partition as a fake network drive through the "emufs.sys" driver. That way
it is possible to access the partition from more than one program at a
time.

I can mail you the files I for either of these methods.

Nowadays I'm mainly using dosemu for ELKS... :)

Mark
