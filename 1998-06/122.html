&gt; Does anyone know where to get maps? either pictures or better proper
&gt; maps with coordinates (lat and long)?
&gt; Any leading hints would be helpful.

There are four reasonably priced products that I know of.  I can
recommend the first because I've used it, but I don't know much at all
about the others.  What area are you after?  Some of these won't be
relevant if you want Whyalla included.

AUSLIG 1:250,000 maps.  7 CDs, $99.95 each (divided up into SA, NT,
WA1, WA2, QLD1, QLD2, VIC+NSW+TAS I think) or $550.00 for the lot.  I
have the SA and VIC+NSW+TAS CDs.  The files are in TIFF format, and
are paper maps which have been scanned.  They're not geocoded, but I
hear that there is a crowd somewhere that have a version of these CDs
where the images have been rotated, cropped, and geocoded.  I
purchased my CDs from Carto Graphics (contact info below).

Swiftmap.  The South Australian government 1:50,000 scale topographic
maps.  $149.95.  Apparently coming out next month; see The Map Shop
web site (info below).  Covers from Port Wakefield to the north west
and Macgrath Flat (past Lake Alexandrina) to the south east.
Presumably the maps are in a recognisable format.

Fullers Adelaide CD Street Directory.  Available from The Map Shop for
$69.  Apparently has TIFF images, but they were out of stock when I
went there and I'm still waiting on them to get back to me.

Digital Chart of the World.  4 CDs covering most of the world at
1:1,000,000 and the rest at 1:2,000,000 for $160.  Presumably the maps
are in a recognisable format.

I think there was another product available from The Map Shop that
seemed relevant when the salesperson told me about it, but I can't
remember what it was.  Oops.

Here's the contact info for those places anyway:

Forgive my curiosity -- what do you want the maps for?
