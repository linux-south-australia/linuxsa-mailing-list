Well, it varies. I believe different TAFEs do different courses. In
fact, I think there is more than one Linux course at most TAFEs...
Perhaps if you could indicate which course at which TAFE, it may help :)
...

Last term, I taught the "Implementing Multi-User Operating Systems"
course, which was the first course I've taught... It was OK, but I can't
say much for the curriculum really -- it was out of date, and difficult
to "implement" in a class of 10-20 with old crufty machines... :)

Anyway, I think that the quality of a course varies firstly on the
quality of the materials the course is based on, then on the quality of
the teacher. If the course material is crud, then you depend on the
teacher to make up for it. If it's good material, then an average
teacher can do a reasonable job of it, but a good teacher will make it
great (a great teacher would inspire a moving drama starring Matt Damon,
based on the true story of a boy who was a sysadmin genius without a
computer who was finally given the opportunity to use a real bash
prompt...)

As for notes, try rute.sourceforge.net and potentially IIT Training (the
notes Richard Sharpe has worked on)...

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi all
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know what the Tafe Linux Course is like and where 
&gt; I could get the 
&gt; notes from? I'm also looking for any professionally written 
&gt; notes of Linux 
&gt; Courses that I could buy.
&gt;
