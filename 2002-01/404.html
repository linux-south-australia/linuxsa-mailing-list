The problem is it is only 'savvy' users who are using Linux as a desktop 
OS - I have been using M$ only for games for some years now and have 
used Linux exclusively for for desktop use - but the average person in 
the street is horrorfied at the complexit of Linux and often find the 
*nix community to be laden with intellectually arrogant people who like 
to see anyone who does not use a real OS as somehow inferior - or see 
any 'dumbing down' of *nix as only for dumb people - but for the average 
full time working family without much time - complexity can be a real 
turn off.

Linux is improving a lot while Windows is becoming more and more over 
complicated and bloated and the average consumer is rapidly losing faith 
in M$ software, however, while I believe M$ is declining and Linux may 
be improving in user friendliness and open minded community members - 
there is still some way to go.

Take for example this passionate opposition to HTML email owing to the 
stubborn determination of many community members to use the most 
complicated text editor imaginable (vi or Emacs) for email and look down 
on people who don't with disdain - even though Vi is a remnant of the 
days before computer screens when a printer was the only form of output.

Mandrake and so on have done a lot of good to make Linux actually usable 
for anyone with less than a computer science degree or people who don't 
work with *nix as part of their job.

Don't get me wrong - the groups are incredibly helpful but I think Linux 
still tends to only attract people with either a lot of experience or 
education in *nix or with a lot of interest and determination.

I just think we need to see more average joes for the desktop market and 
more cost studies for the enterprise market.

&gt; Unless your experiences have been different to mine, I've generally

&gt; 
&gt; You occasionally get people who like to tear down others, but
&gt; fortunately these are fairly uncommon.
&gt; 
&gt; Linux for desktop use (general computing for the masses) is only 3-4
&gt; years old. Microsoft and Apple have had 10 years or more to work on
&gt; their desktop usability. Since the desktop market is continually
&gt; evolving, competitors have to watch out for new applications opening,
&gt; and capture new territory. 
&gt; 
&gt; Today's savvy home users are editing DV video, creating high-quality
&gt; digital photo albums, playing high end 3D games, and creating DVD-R
&gt; movies of their kid's birthdays. 3 years ago I would have never have
&gt; thought this possible on a home computer. Linux should be able to catch
&gt; up reasonably well giving 2-3 years. For most other mundane stuff like
&gt; word processing, spreadsheets, and general productivity - well I think
&gt; it's getting pretty close especially with the expected delivery of
&gt; StarOffice 6
&gt; 
&gt; The fact that I'm using Linux as a top quality desktop OS, proves to me
&gt; that it's making real progress there already. Then again I could be
&gt; wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
