Quoting JaSOn &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joey1976au@yahoo.com.au">joey1976au@yahoo.com.au</A>&gt;:

(
NOTE: Changing subject header. This thread isn't actually related to linux.
[OT] means "offtopic", and allows people who don't care about this sort of
thing to easily filter it out, either manually or automatically.

Also, HTML email makes the baby jesus cry. Sending HTML email and text in the
same email heralds the birth of the Antichrist and the riding out of the
four horsemen.
)

&gt; I have another final query before I buy my 'new-toy'
&gt; 
&gt; I am about to purchase a new HDD for my little computer. My hardware supports
&gt; Ultra/66 and the HDD I am looking at is an Ultra/100.  I wanted to confirm
&gt; the Ultra/100 is backward compatible to the Ultra/66 that my motherboard
&gt; provides?
Yes, it should be. I've run ATA/66 compatable drives at ATA/33 before. Won't
be as fast, though.

&gt; Some of the more common brands that have appeared to me are Maxtor, Samsung,
&gt; Fujitsu, West. Dig, Seagate etc
&gt; I have had good use of the smaller Maxtor and Seagate HDDs and have preferred
&gt; the Seagate because as the HDD have aged, the Maxtor's have become quite
&gt; noisy in comparison. I have also been warned by some about the decrease in
&gt; Western Digital's quality recently.

Read it while you still can, it's shutting down at the end of the month :(

&gt; What brands have you had positive use from?
I have a Seagate 30 gig (7200/ATA66) which has lasted since May 2000 with no
bad blocks. It hasn't really been under heavy load, though.
