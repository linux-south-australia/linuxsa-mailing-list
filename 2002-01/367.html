&gt; &gt; I much prefer the command-line CD creation tools. Under FreeBSD, I

&gt; 
&gt; What what if you are burning files / directories that are scattered 
&gt; throughout your filesystems?

I generally create a 'to-cd' directory in /usr/tmp and copy all the data
I need into that directory. It can be a little annoying, but most of the
time I seem to burn clumps of files that reside in the same place. For
example, I might copy some files from /usr/ports/distfiles and then
/home/andrew/working etc., etc.

&gt; The drag and drop features can save time.

I agree. It's particularly good for creating audio CDs.[1]

&gt; I use KreateCD <A HREF="http://www.kreatecd.de/">http://www.kreatecd.de/</A> , I like the drag and drop 
&gt; interface, and it works like a treat on Solaris-Sparc system. After 
&gt; recommendation from this list, I might try out CD Bake Oven - that 
&gt; looks neat.

KreateCD looks gorgeous; I've not seen it before. The only thing is that
it relies on cdrecord, which relies on SCSI, which, if you have an IDE
burner means that you have to rely on SCSI emulation, which is not
available under FreeBSD. [ Which... :-) ]

I doubt that there would be much hacking required to make KreateCD work,
but I don't believe that making individual application changes is the
right way to address the issue. Someone with developer-level knowledge
of the FreeBSD kernel (ie, not me!) needs to write some SCSI emulation
code.

I've CC'd to the two FreeBSD committers on this list to see if they can
give any insight into the relative difficulty of the task, and the
likelihood (or lack thereof) of it being implemented (maybe as a KLM?).

    week-and-a-half's time :-)
