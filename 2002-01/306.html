Subject: With new technology comes new decisions (long)


&gt; How familiar is this??? :)
&gt;
&gt; (joke ahead)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; THE TOUGHEST DECISION: SHOULD MY LOVED ONE BE PLACED IN AN
&gt; &gt; ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For family members, it is often the most difficult and
&gt; &gt; painful decision they will face: to accept that a loved one -
&gt; &gt; a parent, a spouse, perhaps a sibling - is technologically
&gt; &gt; impaired and should no longer be allowed to live
&gt; &gt; independently, or come near a computer or electronic device
&gt; &gt; without direct supervision. The time has come to place that
&gt; &gt; loved one into the care of an Assisted Computing Facility.
&gt; &gt; But you have questions. So many questions.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We at Silicon Pines want to help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHAT EXACTLY IS AN "ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY"?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sometimes referred to as "Homes for the Technologically
&gt; &gt; Infirm", "Technical Invalid Care Centers," or "Homes for the
&gt; &gt; Technically Challenged," Assisted Computing Facilities (ACFs)
&gt; &gt; are modeled on assisted living facilities, and provide a
&gt; &gt; safe, structured residential environment for those unable to
&gt; &gt; handle even the most common, everyday multi-tasks. Most fully
&gt; &gt; accredited ACFs, like Silicon Pines, are an oasis of hope and
&gt; &gt; encouragement that allow residents to lead productive,
&gt; &gt; technologically relevant lives without the fear and anxiety
&gt; &gt; associated with actually having to understand or execute the
&gt; &gt; technologies themselves.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHO SHOULD BE IN AN ACF?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sadly, technology is advancing at such a dramatic rate that
&gt; &gt; many millions, of all ages, will never truly be able to
&gt; &gt; understand it, putting an undue burden on those friends and
&gt; &gt; family members who must explain it to them. But unless the
&gt; &gt; loved one is suffering from a truly debilitating affliction,
&gt; &gt; such as Reinstallzheimers, the decision to commit is entirely
&gt; &gt; personal. You must ask yourself:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "How frustrated am I that my parent/sibling/spouse is unable
&gt; &gt; to open an email attachment?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "How much of my time should be taken up explaining how RAM is
&gt; &gt; different from hard drive memory?"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "How many times can I bear to hear my dad say, 'Hey, can I
&gt; &gt; replace the motherboard with a fatherboard? Ha ha ha!'"
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; To make things easier, we have prepared a list of Warning
&gt; &gt; Signs which we encourage you to return to often, or, if you
&gt; &gt; can't figure out how to bookmark it, print out. Also, please
&gt; &gt; take a moment to read "I'm Glad I'm in Here! - A Resident's Story."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; MUST IT BE FAMILY, OR CAN I PLACE ANYONE IN AN ACF?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Several corporations have sought permission to have certain
&gt; &gt; employees, or at times entire sales departments, committed to
&gt; &gt; ACFs. At present, however, individuals can be committed only
&gt; &gt; by direct family or self-internment. The reason is simple:
&gt; &gt; there are not nearly enough ACFs in the world to accommodate
&gt; &gt; all the technologically challenged.  For example, there are
&gt; &gt; currently only 860,000 beds available in ACFs, but there are
&gt; &gt; 29 million AOL users.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; ACF rents range from free up to $12,500 per month. The
&gt; &gt; disparity is currently a point of contention in the ACF
&gt; &gt; industry. Many residents are covered through government
&gt; &gt; programs such as Compucaid or Compucare, but reimbursement
&gt; &gt; rates are low and only cover a portion of the fees.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Exacerbating the situation are the HMOs (HelpDesk Maintenance
&gt; &gt; Organizations), which often deny coverage, forcing residents
&gt; &gt; to pay out of pocket or turn to expensive private techcare
&gt; &gt; insurers such as BlueCache/BlueScreen.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Offsetting the costs are technology companies themselves,
&gt; &gt; many of which subsidize ACFs. Firms such as Microsoft, Dell,
&gt; &gt; Qualcomm, and America Online will pay up to 100 percent of a
&gt; &gt; resident's monthly bill, but there is a catch. ISPs, for
&gt; &gt; instance, require residents to sign service contracts lasting
&gt; &gt; a year or more. Microsoft, meanwhile, prohibits the
&gt; &gt; installation of any competitive software, while Priceline
&gt; &gt; requires that residents buy shares of its stock, which seems
&gt; &gt; onerous but saves residents on lavatory tissue.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; HOW OLD MUST I BE TO HAVE SOMEONE COMMITTED?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Until very recently, you had to be 18 or older to legally
&gt; &gt; commit a family member. However, the now famous British court
&gt; &gt; case Frazier vs. Frazier and Frazier has cleared the way for
&gt; &gt; minors to commit their parents. In that case, 15-year-old
&gt; &gt; Bradley Frazier of Leicester had his 37-year-old parents
&gt; &gt; committed to an ACF in Bournemouth after a judge ruled Ian
&gt; &gt; and Janet Frazier were a "danger to themselves and the
&gt; &gt; community." According to court records, Bradley told his
&gt; &gt; parents about the I Love You virus and warned them not to
&gt; &gt; click attachments, then the next day his parents received an
&gt; &gt; I Love You email and clicked on the attachment because, they
&gt; &gt; explained, "it came from someone we know."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR IN AN ACF?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; First, make sure it's a genuine Assisted Computing Facility,
&gt; &gt; and not an Assisted Living Facility. To tell the difference,
&gt; &gt; observe the residents. If they look rather old and tend to
&gt; &gt; openly discuss bowel movements, this is probably 'assisted
&gt; &gt; living.' On the other hand, if they vary in age and say
&gt; &gt; things like, "I'm supposed to figure that out? I'm not Bill
&gt; &gt; Gates you know!," this is probably 'assisted computing.'
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Also, at a well-run ACF, residents should lead full,
&gt; &gt; independent lives, and should be allowed the use of many
&gt; &gt; technology devices, including telephones, electric
&gt; &gt; toothbrushes, and alarm clocks. However, only a facility's
&gt; &gt; Licensed Techcare Professionals (LTPs) should perform
&gt; &gt; computational or technological tasks such as installing
&gt; &gt; programs or saving email attachments. And LTPs should NEVER
&gt; &gt; answer residents' questions because studies have shown that
&gt; &gt; answering user questions inevitably makes things worse.
&gt; &gt; Instead, residents should simply have things done for them,
&gt; &gt; relieving them of the pressure to "learn" or "improve."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; CAN A RESIDENT EVER GET OUT?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; OK, THIS SOUNDS PROMISING. HOW CAN I LEARN MORE?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For your enlightenment, we offer extensive information on
&gt; &gt; Silicon Pines and the ACF lifestyle, which can be found by
&gt; &gt; clicking one of the links in the navigation bars found at
&gt; &gt; both the top and bottom of this page. But whatever you
&gt; &gt; decide, keep in mind that due to demand, ACFs now have long
&gt; &gt; waiting lists. WebTV & AOL users alone will take years to absorb.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; We look forward to your response. Thank you.
