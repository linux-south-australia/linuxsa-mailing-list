yup very painful burning mac versions of cd.

you need to enable 'apple extensions' if you are burning from pc

i had a _great_ deal of trouble with this, mkisofs is good - you can use
it to create one big image and burn it with a traditional program, even
under win (e.g. nero, padus etc)..

elsewise you need an ntfs partition (as far as win goes) to burn a hfs
partition.

i also had _great_ difficultly reading mac disks in linux, i didn't know
what format they were - tried mounting as HFS/HFS+ to no avail,
in the end i used a win program 'macopener' or 'macdisk' i think it
was called which read it no probs

its all pain

&gt; &gt; &gt; If it's not a standard ISO9660 CD-ROM file system, I'd try mounting the
&gt; &gt; &gt; CD as an HFS or UDF file system.  As I understand it, HFS is commonly
&gt; &gt; &gt; found on Apple Macintosh systems, and UDF is a format used for packet
&gt; &gt; &gt; writing, commonly used on CD-RWs and DVDs (I could be wrong).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mac's also like HFS+. I believe the support for HFS+ is somewhat dodgy,
&gt; &gt; though I'm not sure whether it'd be used on optical media such as a CD.
&gt; 
&gt; To clarify -- the support for HFS+ under Linux appears to be dodgy, at
&gt; least, last time I looked it was.
