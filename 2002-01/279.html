&gt; Other suggestions from you or the list would also be greatly 
&gt; appreciated.

Resources for quiet gear include:

www.quietpc.com
<A HREF="mailto:Silent-pc@yahoogroups.com">Silent-pc@yahoogroups.com</A>

And there's a fair whack of stuff linked to from those sites...

My understanding of the state-of-the-art in quiet gear is:

PSU: Q Tech (from silentpc.com) or Zalman, or Enermax with a
warrantee-breaking modification (disconnect the thermistor from the
coil, and the fan spins slower)

HDD: Seagate Barracuda IV 7200RPM or Seagate U6 5400rpm (I think the
7200 is actually quieter) -- many manufacturers are making fluid bearing
drives now, and they are getting quieter and quieter...

CPU cooler: Zalman (flower), but there are many other options, including
water cooling... Or get a CPU that can be cooled passively.

CPU: Via C3 -- passive cooling recommended by Via, but only 800ish MHz
and slow FP, Athlon XP -- less heat than other AMDs, Intel 0.13
(palomino?) cores, and underclocking any CPU...

Fans: Panaflow, Pabst, and a few others.

Video/mobo heatsink: Passive should be ok most of the time, but zalman
have some cool products for passive cooling of hotter chips here...

Case: Some say aluminium is best, as it conducts heat away from the
source, although others say aluminium vibrates more.

CD/CD-R/DVD/etc: not sure -- there was some talk of certain models being
quieter than others...

FDD: NFI, but who cares :)

Complete Systems: Compaq Evo, Dell Optiplex (In my experience, they are
very very quiet).

Some people talk of quiet keyboards (which would be an issue if you are
actually looking for a recording studio system or something) and so on,
but personally, it's just for my own health and sanity, that I want to
quieten the PSU, CPU and HDD.
