<H1>[OT] IT's Disability Mandate</H1>

<PRE>
A very interesting look at the responsibility for the high-tech 
industry to continue to provide solutions for those of the community 
with a disability.

"When things get tough, companies are forced to make cutbacks. The 
danger, of course, is that we'll make cuts in the wrong areas, or cut 
too deeply, and end up doing ourselves more harm than good. 

In the high-tech industry, that could very easily be the case if we 
fail to maintain a steady focus on developing innovative solutions for 
people with disabilities, innovative ways to access information and 
online services. 
"

"But by simply considering the needs of the disabled, we do much more; 
we force ourselves to look beyond the first or most obvious way of 
doing things. There is, or should be, more than one way to accomplish 
any given task. We need to keep that in mind at all times and make it a 
design principle. 

Those of us who can't hear need to have visuals, and those of us who 
can't see need to have audible or tactile inputs. Even a person who can 
move only his or her eyes should still be able to interact with a 
computer through eye-tracking technology---which will also enable 
fighter pilots to execute maneuvers in, pardon the pun, the blink of an 
eye. 

Patricia C. Sueltz is executive vice president and general manager of 
Sun Microsystems' Software Systems Group.
