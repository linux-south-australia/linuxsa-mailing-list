Tim,

I have BP DSL with a mini linux distro firewall setup (freesco) on a
Dx4-133 (an amd) on 8mb of ram
2 el-crappo network cards 1 100mb HDD. Eth0 to dsl modem and eth1 to hub
for lan, it works very well for me (your mileage may vary) (it too was
using a modem before I got DSL)

I had to do some loading of RP pppoe software but it wasn't hard and it is
well supported very much a turnkey setup.

you can also fatten it up with other modules as the need arises but more
ram required obviously, comes on a single floppy (initially)

As for the 3gb CAP stay away call netspace they have hybrid plan which is
3gb peak (7-midnight)and 7gb (midnight-7)non-peak. In the archives there
was some mention of Internode doing similar or offering netspaces plans here.

But if you do go for BP then you will have to watch what you do, I manage
ok but I do get close. There is no surefireway of stopping short of 3gb to
protect yourself short of turning the modem off.

&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;I'm thinking of signing up for Telstras ADSL service.
&gt;
&gt;I would want to connect this to my local lan to allow all computers in
&gt;my house access to the net. I would like to run a linux NAT gateway and
&gt;firewall, i currently have a similar system with my modem. The NAT
&gt;gateway is currently an old 486-DX100 with 8mb of ram and realtek
&gt;network card, it handels the load of the modem without breaking a sweat.
&gt;Would this computer be able to handle the 40/50k a second that ADSL
&gt;provides?
&gt;
&gt;As well i'm worried about the 3 gig cap, i'm afraid that i'll end up
&gt;with a huge bill for meg passed this cap. Can anyone recommend good
&gt;software to make sure that the cap isn't passed?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your help.

&gt;PS Has anyone does Telstra's "Self Insterlation" option?
&gt;PSS Has anyone got evolutions spell checker working and can give me a
&gt;quick hint? There are like 500 refrences on the mailing list and none
&gt;seem to work :(
