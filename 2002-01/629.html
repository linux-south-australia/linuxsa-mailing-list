Hi there all,
I was wondering if some one could point me in the right direction.
I have this private project of my own that has been on the back burners
for the last 8 years, The problems I have had up to date is what
language to use / learn.
The project consits of a GPS to obtain locational data and a series of
maps that are obtainable 9 cd's for south australia basically needs to
'move the map' image which are tiffs using rs232 data in a standard nema
format.
There are other things I wouls like to do but this is the bare bones,
yes and change maps automatically.

This sounds like a lot of work but I have no idea what would be the best
langauge to use, yes I would like to program under linux, pooie to
windzose I allready have a program that I have bought and works very
well but it requires a fast machine.

I have already invested over $1000 in maps only for S.A. and I would
like to see them used on a daily bases on a brick pc that I have with a
lcd 10.4".


Some one please HELP...


Cheers Paul Mullins
