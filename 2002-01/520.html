Firstly, as this is not directly related to helping people with Linux I 
would be happy if people could respond off list so we don't block the 
view for folks searching for help with Linux problems.

My apologies for those that don't think this suits the List topics.

OK, as part of our Salisbury community project, coming in a couple of 
months I will be teaching a class of 10 young IT hopefuls something 
about Computer Maintenance. I will have them for 6 hours, 2 x 3 hour 
sessions, and in that time I hope I can give them enough knowledge that 
they wont be dangerous to themselves or others and might be able to 
handle the innards of a computer with some sort of respect.

I am open to any ideas on topics to cover, suggested activities, 
information for handouts etc.

I have enough old P166's and P200's to play with and I have a good 
technician mate to share the workload so it will be mostly a practical 
class activity. 

Should I be including how to load an OS? Linux? Win95?

Any ideas? Any helpers?

I will also have another 6 hours to teach them about building web 
sites, just enough to get them started.

I was planning to use HomeSite 4.01 as the base program (as it was free 
on an APC cover) or do you think I should be using something else? What 
topics should I try to cover? Could I do this on our Linux machines? 
What program would be best for their level of knowledge?

My goal is for them to end up with a 1 or 2 page web site online 
somewhere. Suggestions for a free provider please.

Anybody that teaches this topic who would be prepared to donate 
material/time/support to the project? 

Are there any accredited short courses that I might be able to 
negotiate the rights to so that our participants actually get a piece 
of paper for their efforts?

Oh, in case you were wondering, no money is changing hands, the 
teaching is voluntary and they are getting the course for free.

 Cheers, Ian,
 from Salisbury, South Australia
