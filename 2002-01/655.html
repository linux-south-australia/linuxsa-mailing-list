I'm very interested too, as I have a slightly odd situation/conundrum:

- I have an Internode 512/128kbps ADSL service which includes 500MB per 
  month.  (I'm very happy with it, it's very reliable and quick - highly 
  recommend it).

- I want/need a fixed IP for running a couple of webservers/my own mail 
  server etc (nothing commercial, just for fun - I have no ACN or ABN etc)

- I use more than 500MB per month (usually an extra 250MB or so), which 
  costs me around $50 per month on top of the $100 per month for the base 
  service.

No problem so far.  

So, I want more MB/per month.  Not faster, just more MB.

My options:

- Pay as I do for extra MB at 18c per MB

- For an extra $110 per month I can upgrade to 1500MB included

- For an extra $115 per month I can get an entirely new ADSL service 
  AND separate phone line through Telstra purely for downloads and 
  websurfing.  (This is a _business_ service so I _could_ be a business) 

Obviously the last option has some setup costs (at least $386 including 
installing a second phone line) but given thats only 2 or 3GB worth of 
traffic on the other options then it's paid off in 3 months anyway, so 
that's moot.

I guess what I'm trying to point out here is that this arbitrary distinction 
between Business and Residential breaks down.  I realize there is a cost 
associated with fixed IPs (I do however have my own portable address space), 
but it seems to be quite odd that it is cheaper to have 2 ADSL services and 
2 phones lines to get 3.5GB of traffic than it is to get extra traffic on a 
single connection.
