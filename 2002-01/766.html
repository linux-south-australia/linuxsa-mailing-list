Nimda and CodeRed et al have become Internet pollution that penalises
those with permanent per-megabyte connections, even if you don't have
servers enabled.

If you have a subnet routed to your home network, you'll pick up this
noise by a factor directly proportional to the number of IP's routed. We
have modem users who have abandoned their subnets for NAT simply because
IIS-junk was costing them money and reducing performance.
