Quoting Kirsty Rae &lt;<A HREF="mailto:junkie@process9.com.au">junkie@process9.com.au</A>&gt;:

&gt; At the end of the day though, my suggestion is to use the distribution
&gt; that your friends use.  Friends are always the best source of assistance
&gt; with difficulties.  Although, I'm moving towards the opinion that a
&gt; Linux From Scratch is very much the way to go these days for longer term
&gt; stability and maintainability.  There is nothing difficult about
&gt; installing from source and you get exactly what you want far more
&gt; quickly and easily (and I'm finding it easier to upgrade packages from
&gt; source than rpm)...

There is difficulty in properly removing packages when you're trying to
clean up, though. Even if you go the /opt/* route with package installation,
you're still going to have to manually remove stale shared libraries from
/usr/local/lib (unless, of course, you manually add each and every library
directory to ldconfig).

I ran a roll-your-own Linux for about a year or so, until I discovered
Debian. It was fairly rewarding and gave me a much better idea of how each
component in a Linux distribution fit together, and how difficult it is to
write fault-tolerant init scripts. In the end, though, I was spending more
time compiling source and moving crap about than doing actual work.

In the long term, you're going to get lots of cruft, and it's going to be
very tedious to maintain. Less tedious than using RPM, though[1] :)

[1] I remember vaguely having to upgrade my version of RPM to support the new
    package format. However, the RPM (package) of RPM (program) used the new
    package format, and thus couldn't be upgraded using RPM (program).
    I think the solution was to compile the new RPM from source. Lame[2].

[2] Debian isn't innocent, either. Installing the latest X debs required the
    installation of the latest debconf. Debconf was to be installed
    automatically, but _after_ the configuration of the new X deb. Banged my
    head against the wall for a while before manually installing the new
    debconf and then installing X. Grr.
