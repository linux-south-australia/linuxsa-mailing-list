Linux (and its running problems with the question of whether KDE and 
GNOME and Star Office etc etc will ever become a truly mainstream 
environment) is a really interesting issue and question.

There is one very serious contender in that realm, that exists today, 
and does some critical things that Linux can't, while doing 100% of 
what it can.

Its called Mac OS-X.

It has the mainstream aspects that Linux lacks in the corporate world 
(specifically - an exceptionally good GUI and an environment that 
runs Microsoft Office. This IS fundamentally the main barrier to 
mainstream office acceptance of Linux on client desktops, like it or 
not).

And don't tell me to use Star Office on Linux to fix it all.

I've watched Linux/FreeBSD zealots in my office tell me that for 
years, and one by one they've all given up and gone over to Windows 
PC's in disgust at not being able to properly deal with Word and 
Excel files from the rest of the world, there is -always- a file that 
it botches, or that crashes it, or that it doesn't render right - 
eventually it just grinds you down to giving up. Or at least, it 
grinds -them- down.

I don't care because my operating system is unix that -does- run MS 
office as well...

I wonder, in fact, whether a good and in depth demonstration of the 
interesting aspects of Mac OS-X might not be a good topic for a 
future LinuxSA meeting. Because it does exactly the things right that 
Linux needs to do in order to 'win' in the corporate desktop space.

Of course, many Linux folk don't care about that space and don't 
-want- it to win there (or don't care about whether it does). Linus 
Torvalds amongst them.

But I'm happy having what, for me, is absolutely the best of all 
possible worlds, and zero compromises in the process - real open 
source unix, a full open source software development platform, that 
compiles and runs everything linux does, but which also has a great, 
commercial strength (and commercially supported) GUI and execution 
environment for commercial applications built on top of it.

I think the threat to Linux in the desktop space is probably OS-X, 
simply because it's better in that space, and getting even better 
still by the month.

In the non-GUI application space (servers 'out the back'), Linux or 
FreeBSD are both brilliant.

Cheers,
Simon

&gt;Just browsing the newsagents and happened to be flicking through the
&gt;latest issue of PC Authority. About page 20 something is an article
&gt;discussing the likelihood of Linux ever coming up with a decent
&gt;desktop. His suggestion is that people working on KDE and GNOME are
&gt;wasting their time and should be better off working to make Linux a
&gt;better server application. It will never be  able to come up with a
&gt;decent desktop.
&gt;
&gt;His comparison was that Linux would never be able to come up with a
&gt;desktop equal to Windows 3 let alone any modern application desktop
&gt;like 98 or XP.
&gt;
&gt;Take a look at the article and see what you think about it.
