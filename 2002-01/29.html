Hi y'all,

We're using autofs to mount remote machines via NFS automatically
using NIS to ship the options.  The problem we have is that when the
remote machine (NFS server) has multiple partions, the extra
partitions cannot be automatically mounted on the same point.  ie if
server nfs01 has exports/partition / and /boot, we can't see any files
in /net/nfs01/boot but we can see all files in /net/nfs01/etc (where
/etc is on the same partition as /)

This is as expected .... to quote the man page autofs(5):
--
UNSUPPORTED
       The  automounter  does  not  support  direct maps or mount
       trees (more than one filesystem to be mounted under a spe-
       cific automount point), and handles SunOS-style replicated
       filesystems only to the extent that mount(8) does.
--

So one option is to export the root file system with the "nohide"
option so that all partitions are exported and the additional
paritions do not need to be mounted explicitly on the client.  This
would work with autofs but the nohide option doesn't seem to work as
expected (the man page doesn't give a very reassuring assessment of
the nohide option).  I'm using the standard kernel based NFS server
that comes with RedHat7.2 (I have seen the nohide option work with the
an old Slackware userspace NFS server).

So the only option seems to be running the am-utils if we want to be
able to see all partitions.  

Is this the same conclusion other people have some to or am I missing
something?  Both machines (server and client) are RH7.2.

Regards,
Michael
