&gt; Just browsing the newsagents and happened to be flicking through the

firstly I should say I haven't found any of those PC mags to worth
buying for years (APC was about the best of a bad lot).

&gt; About page 20 something is an article 
&gt; discussing the likelihood of Linux ever coming up with a decent 
&gt; desktop. His suggestion is that people working on KDE and GNOME are 
&gt; wasting their time and should be better off working to make Linux a 
&gt; better server application. It will never be  able to come up with a 
&gt; decent desktop.

it's true that most of the window managers suck, mind you I think
the M$ interface sucks too.  However I don't know what I would like
either.  I'm currently using gnome and enlightenment and it's ok.
I do think that all those resources going into kde and
gnome are stupid - the effort should be combined to product one
really good, efficient and customisable desktop.
 
&gt; His comparison was that Linux would never be able to come up with a 
&gt; desktop equal to Windows 3 let alone any modern application desktop 
&gt; like 98 or XP.

ha! I'm not sure I even know what that means.
And windows 3, how about fvwm?

&gt; Take a look at the article and see what you think about it.

I don't think I'll bother.  Besides which I don't really care whether
linux "wins" or not against M$, what I am interested in is open
standards so that whatever OS people use it all works together.

BTW Simon, you say OS-X is OSS?  is it? I hadn't realised...
and what do you run it on?  an i-mac?  what platform(s) does it
work on?  (sorry very ignorant of mac type stuff, I've not touched
one since the little "all in one type 10-12" built in B&W monitor
things circa 1988).

Dave.
