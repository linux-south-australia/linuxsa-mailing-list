Hi,

I am wasting hours upon hours banging my uneducated head against a wall 
and figure I would save myself a lot of grief if someone (who has a lot 
of patience and can explain things from the top and not just rush in to 
it) would sit down with me and explain a lot of things.

I am willing to shout some pizza or beer or both if someone were to come 
around here (I live in Hallett Cove) or if I were to go around to 
someones house some time.

Either that or we can organise another config fest at someones house.

For example - I am using Mandrake 8.1 and have been trying futilely for 
two days to work out how to record line in input from my soundcard 
(which is not working at all) and then mpeg compress it on the fly and 
then schedule that (for radio programs), as well as never being able to 
successfuly compile / run tar applications.  I can only ever manage RPM's.

Any takers????

Thanks!!!
