Hiya Paul,

The two main GUI toolkits under Linux is the GNU Project's GTK 
(<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</A>) and TrollTech's QT (<A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com">http://www.trolltech.com</A>). GTk
is the toolkit for the GNOME desktop, and QT is the toolkit for KDE. I
think both are equally suitable on UNIX, Windows, and Mac, but I'm not
completely sure about GTK - QT certainly is.

GTK is open source licensed under the LGPL.QT is a commercial product,
Windows and Mac evaluations are available, but you'd be expected to pay
for the full versions. Due to KDE's success, Trolltech allowed QT/X11 to
be open sourced too under QPL. 

<A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-x11.html">http://www.trolltech.com/developer/download/qt-x11.html</A>

Not being a GUI developer, I'm not sure of their relative pluses and
minuses, but my friends do a lot of QT development work under Linux/QT
and they give it their thumbs up.

Subjectively to me, TrollTech's website looks a hell of a lot better.

Cheers,

&gt; yes and change maps automatically.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds like a lot of work but I have no idea what would be the best
&gt; langauge to use, yes I would like to program under linux, pooie to
&gt; windzose I allready have a program that I have bought and works very
&gt; well but it requires a fast machine.
&gt;

&gt; like to see them used on a daily bases on a brick pc that I have with a
