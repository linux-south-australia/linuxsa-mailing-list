Simon,

Well, eh, that was quite a response.

I was actually referring to a way of reading mail as they come down over PPP 
in Evolution. I'm using KMail now, and that does it. I was illustrating how 
Evolution, as advance as it is, still misses some basic features.

We're trying to get xDSL to our place, but it might be a little too far from 
a DSLAM. 5 Arafura Court, Hallett Cove Beach - can you find out if that is 
servicable?

Cheers,

&gt; If you spool your email into your home linux box, you would be able
&gt; to read messages as they arrived on your server. This makes your
&gt; linux box the end point for the SMTP transmissions to you, rather
&gt; than your ISP's smtp server being that end point. You would then read
&gt; messages from your own local machine via PoP or imap over your local
&gt; network, or via direct filesystem access on the local machine.
&gt;
&gt; You'd also want a domain name so you can associate an MX record into
&gt; your machine with it. But since your own domain name makes you a much
&gt; cooler person, its easily worth the $$ :)
&gt;
&gt; You can then run as many email destinations on your system as you
&gt; like because you've become your own Internet mail server.
&gt;
&gt; [You can also experience the joys of needing to configure it to block
&gt; spam relaying (which, fortunately, is on by default in decent mail
&gt; servers now) - but this is linuxsa - you wanted to learn more about
&gt; linux, didn't you? :) ]
&gt;
&gt; Your machine can be an SMTP end point if it is on a permanent link
&gt; (its trivial this way). That can be via modem, or ISDN, or ADSL, or
&gt; whatever.
&gt;
&gt; Good ISP's can also offer you the capability to have a permanent IP
&gt; address associated with your dial account, and to have your email
&gt; spool into your box whenever you dial up, either automatically
&gt; (auto-detecting your presence) or triggered by you (via an SMTP ETRN
&gt; command).
&gt;
&gt; The point here is that these things all move the SMTP end-point right
&gt; in to your own machine. So as each message arrives in your system, it
&gt; turns up at the back of /var/mail/yournamehere and you can read it
&gt; then - while other messages are still turning up.
&gt;
&gt; Take the opportunity to swap from bigpond to a real ISP while you're at it
&gt; :)
&gt;
&gt; If this is all too complicated, here are two simpler alternatives:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Some mail clients (Eudora, for instance) let you tell them to only
&gt; download the first &lt;x&gt; kilobytes of each message via PoP, and if you
&gt; want the rest later, you manually trigger a subsequent 'pull' of the
&gt; rest of the message. That allows a rapid assimilation of what mail is
&gt; there, without the download delays.
&gt;
&gt; It is, however, ultimately a pretty annoying way to work (IMHO).
&gt;
&gt; 2) Just get a faster Internet link, so the time to download 300
&gt; messages becomes trivial (ADSL comes to mind).
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon
&gt;
&gt; p.s. of course, the really nifty approach is imap rather than pop.
&gt; But imap is very much an 'on-line' protocol, especially if you want
&gt; to read headers only now, and pull messages 'on-demand' as you read
&gt; them. And no rational ISP will support you using imap[*], you'll want
&gt; to run this on your own linux box, which means engaging one of the
&gt; options noted above anyway, at which point all the mail downloads to
&gt; your machine while you sleep anyway and its already on your local
&gt; hard drive...
&gt;
&gt; [*] Because imap leaves all the mail on the server, all the time.
&gt; Which is a blessing if it is -your- hard disk, and a curse (for your
&gt; ISP) if it was theirs...rapidly becomes untenable in the latter case.

&gt; &gt;David,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm currently using Kmail and MS Outlook (for more important stuff).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is there a way of actually seeing incoming mail as they arrive one by one?
&gt; &gt;Over a normal modem, it would be nice to actually start reading the first
&gt; &gt; of 300 incoming emails as they arrive.
