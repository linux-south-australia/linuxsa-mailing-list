Hi All,
    Having just run a major Tournament in a different area
on the weekend (The Toyota & Denso Cup World Go Oza, Oceania
Qualifying Tournament - Go is a game in case you didn't
know). I can assure you that doing a draw *can* be a
problem. I would suggest that in this particular case
however, that the problem was simply manipulating data that
would take so much time. There are 128 Players in the
Opening round of Men's singles, plus Women's Singles. Men's
and Women's Doubles, Mixed Doubles have 64 pairs, and then
there are the other Competitions run such as the Master's
(ie old buggers) Tournament. By the time you have entered
the Players name, World ranking, registration number and any
other data, it would take a while. The Draw then would have
some rules that would be implemented to avoid the better
players being knocked out too early (mind you from recent
results, these don't always work). So assuming that all of
the data was already punched in, to actually do the draw by
seeding and then applying the rules, and then allocating
which players play on centre court, which on court 1, and
who on the others, and also allowing them sufficient rest
time between matches, I would suggest that even doing one
draw would be quite time consuming. From my Computer Science
studies, Scheduling problems are some of the most complex
problems to solve on a computer. This does not mean they
cannot be solved, just that they can be difficult. I hope
this has given you some insight. BTW, I would also hazard a
guess and say they are probably using some kind of recursive
and/or pattern matching algorithm, which is a very slow way
of sorting things as you probably know (from memory in the
order of N^2 in efficiency). Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt; "To do the draw manually would take about two hours, then
another 15
&gt; minutes to get it printed out and distributed to the
media," IBM
&gt; Australia corporate affairs manager John Harvey said.
&gt;
&gt; Why on earth would they do it manually, and why would it
take two hours?
&gt; I'm sure I could do it faster than that... Manually or
digitally...
