Its a real issue to me since i am well over my cap for the month... the next
step is do a test with the linux machine off, then remove the lan cable,
then turn off the modem, then ... well im pretty sure its not my fault at
that point!

So is mine...but the Nimda (?) virus and others found it.  They don't harm
it because it is Linux based (not Windows) yet they are constantly hammering
it and, I don't know about you, but my ADSL connection agreement states I
get charged for ALL throughput which to me reads as downstream as well as
upstream.  Whether or not Telstra actually charge for people hitting your
server I haven't really investigated thoroughly.

Of course there could just be an f'up on their side while doing the
accounting.

I had queries of the same nature when I got my connection and so I
implemented a script on my end which logged once an hour the throughput as
seen from my end.  I haven't sat down to do the exact maths, but what I am
being charged for roughly looks like what I am using.

How bad are your web/ftp/dns services being hit?

My adsl connection loggs (at the ISP end) that i am downloading 28+mb during
the day - when on these days, the net isnt being used. as a test, i turned
off machines behind the linux gateway (which is a redhat server install -
almost unmodified from the box) and it still happens. Any ideas?

Im *sure its something i am doing wrong... i think im sure.

It looks like this:

ISP
|
|
adsl modem
| 
redhat (running apache, ftp-readonly, dns)
|
---------------------
|         |          |
win2k    mdk8.0

generally speaking, it isn't (shouldn't) be possible for others remotly to
write to this redhat machine so im sure its not to do with ftp.

Andrew,
