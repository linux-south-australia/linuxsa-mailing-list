Subject: [OT]: Lord of the Rings?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt;
========================================================================
===
&gt; &gt; &gt; Recently one of my friends, a computer wizard, paid me a visit. As
we
&gt; were
&gt; &gt; &gt; talking I mentioned that I had recently installed Windows XP on my
PC. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; told him how happy I was with this operating system and showed him
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Windows XP CD.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise he threw it into my microwave oven and turned it
on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Instantly I got very upset, because the CD had become precious to
me,
&gt; but he
&gt; &gt; &gt; said, 'Do not worry, it is unharmed."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; After a few minutes he took the CD out, gave it to me and said,
'Take a
&gt; &gt; &gt; close
&gt; &gt; &gt; look at it."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise the CD was quite cold to hold and it seemed to be
heavier
&gt; &gt; &gt; than before. At first I could not see anything, but on the inner
edge
&gt; of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; central hole I saw an inscription, an inscription finer than
anything
&gt; I had
&gt; &gt; &gt; ever seen before. The inscription shone piercingly bright, and yet

&gt; remote,
&gt; &gt; &gt; as if out of a great depth:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
12413AEB2ED4FA5E6F7D78E78BEDE820945092OF923A40EElOE5IOCC98D444AA08E324
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "I cannot understand the fiery letters," I said in a timid voice.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "No, but I can," he said. "The letters are Hex, of an ancient
mode,
&gt; but the
&gt; &gt; &gt; language is that of Microsoft, which I shall not utter here. But
in
&gt; common
&gt; &gt; &gt; English, this is what it says:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "One OS to rule them all, One OS to find them,
&gt; &gt; &gt; One OS to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is only two lines from a verse long known in System lore:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Three OS's from corporate kings in their towers of glass,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Seven from valley lords where orchards used to grow,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nine from dotcoms doomed to die,
&gt; &gt; &gt; One from the Dark Lord Gates on his dark throne
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the Land of Redmond where the Shadows lie.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; "One OS to rule them all,
&gt; &gt; &gt; One OS to find them,
&gt; &gt; &gt; One OS to bring them all
&gt; &gt; &gt; And in the darkness bind them,
&gt; &gt; &gt; In the Land of Redmond where the Shadows lie."
