&gt;&gt; I haven't found anybody cheaper.  Last time I tried, that included
&gt;&gt; Internode.  I've just checked again and find that I could get it
&gt;&gt; marginally cheaper on the modem dialup plan at
&gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://www.on.net/services/s_modem.html,">http://www.on.net/services/s_modem.html,</A> but I'd have to disconnect
&gt;&gt; all the time for hours on end.  You still don't publish your permanent
&gt;&gt; connect prices, but they're bound to be more expensive.
&gt;
&gt; This isn't (yet) quite making sense to me.
&gt;
&gt; How much do you download per month?

Nothing.  I use it as an uplink for my satellite connection.

&gt; The only cases in which Telstra would be cheaper that I can think of
&gt; offhand would be a situation where monthly downloads are very very
&gt; low per month (less than about 300 Mb's), in which case Telstra's
&gt; atypically generous $22 per month minimum charge on a permanent modem
&gt; link under some circumstances would become the relevant factor.
&gt; Above that, we (and everybody else!!) charge less for a modem based
&gt; permanent link.

Yes, this is the situation.  Sorry I didn't mention it in the previous
messages.

&gt; Our new 'home' ADSL numbers (yes, very soon now) are cheaper still,
&gt; to the point where the entry level plan you'll soon see released
&gt; works out cheaper than a second phone line and an 'unlimited hours'
&gt; dial account.

Well, as soon as you find a way for me to use ADSL 4.4 km from the
Echunga exchange, I'll sign up.

&gt; I may just not properly understand the constraint set you are
&gt; working with. 

Possibly.

&gt; Or maybe you just need to see the home ADSL pricing when its
&gt; released and use that as an opportunity to reassess what is really
&gt; 'cheap' in this realm.

Recall that two of the constraints are lack of DSLAM in Echunga and my
distance from the exchange (over multiply repaired lines, FWIW).
