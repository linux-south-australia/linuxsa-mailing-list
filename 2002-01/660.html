Will the ADSL modem work on the Telstra service?  If so, don't they wave a
certain portion of the cost?  And the second line... why not get the filter
from Tesltra for $8 and use ADSL/voice/data at the same time with no
degradation?

Or am I missing something?

I'm very interested too, as I have a slightly odd situation/conundrum:

- I have an Internode 512/128kbps ADSL service which includes 500MB per
  month.  (I'm very happy with it, it's very reliable and quick - highly
  recommend it).

- I want/need a fixed IP for running a couple of webservers/my own mail
  server etc (nothing commercial, just for fun - I have no ACN or ABN etc)

- I use more than 500MB per month (usually an extra 250MB or so), which
  costs me around $50 per month on top of the $100 per month for the base
  service.

No problem so far.

So, I want more MB/per month.  Not faster, just more MB.

My options:

- Pay as I do for extra MB at 18c per MB

- For an extra $110 per month I can upgrade to 1500MB included

- For an extra $115 per month I can get an entirely new ADSL service
  AND separate phone line through Telstra purely for downloads and
  websurfing.  (This is a _business_ service so I _could_ be a business)

Obviously the last option has some setup costs (at least $386 including
installing a second phone line) but given thats only 2 or 3GB worth of
traffic on the other options then it's paid off in 3 months anyway, so
that's moot.

I guess what I'm trying to point out here is that this arbitrary
distinction
between Business and Residential breaks down.  I realize there is a cost
associated with fixed IPs (I do however have my own portable address
space),
but it seems to be quite odd that it is cheaper to have 2 ADSL services and

2 phones lines to get 3.5GB of traffic than it is to get extra traffic on a

single connection.
