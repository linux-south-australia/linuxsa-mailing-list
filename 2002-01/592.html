&gt; My usual thoughts were Lyx & Klyx although I'm not sure if they are robust enough to manage 1000+ pages.

I have found that LaTeX is pretty robust no matter how many pages.  Most
We have quite a few people using it at Uni to write their final thesis
dissertation (which gets large, and cumbersome, and full of images).

Lyx (and Klyx) are really just front-ends to LaTeX anyway - they use
their own file format, but they convert to a tex file for processing.

Is your friend highly computer savvy or is your friend one of the "point
and click, oh shit, it's done something different to normal I'd better
call an expert" kind of person?

If your friend falls closer to the latter category, I'd recommend
steering clear of Lyx and/or LaTeX.  Staroffice or Word perfect (or
Abiword or KOffice) may be better alternatives.  They provide a much
more "user-friendly" interface to the uninitiated user.  Staroffice is
pretty stable with large documents if you break the document into
chapters and store each in a separate file.  That's not too hard to do
once you get used to it either.

If your friend is closer to the former category then I'd recommend going
straight to LaTeX source. It's not hard to learn if you have a real task
for it.  It's available on Unix and Windows (and just about everything
in between), and there's squidloads of information available to help you
out. I say your friend needs to be more experienced, as TeX (of any
variety) outputs its build errors in text form and sometimes they're
worse than the output of a compiler when you need to track down a source
error.

If your friend falls in the middle, he can try LyX of Klyx. I tried LyX
once and it looked OK, but it wasn't exactly fast (execution speed), and
it didn't seem overly stable - I crashed it by trying to display a
simple one page file as DVI. I can't speak for Klyx. The interface is a
little clunky compared to the more polished word processors too.

You don't say exactly what your friend is trying to do though - does he
have large text documents, or does he use lots of graphics and tricky
formatting everywhere?  These things also help to decide what software
to select.

Hope this has been of some help.

Cheers,
Adam
