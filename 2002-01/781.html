Hi Peter

I would say that my experience is only an indication also :)

Cheers

Subject: RE: ext3 vs. reiserfs


&gt;
&gt; &gt;I seen two many reiser file system which were corrupted, files
&gt; &gt;which would
&gt; &gt;not delete, whole partitions which were corrupt. The reiser
&gt; &gt;fixing tools are
&gt; &gt;not up to the job.
&gt;
&gt; I find this interesting, obviously your experience is a bit more varied
&gt; than mine, but we've been running reiser on a 30G data partition shared
&gt; among
&gt; 70 workstations and haven't had any trouble.  That includes recovering
from
&gt; a serious crash when we lost 2 RAID drives out of 4 from overheating.  The
&gt; only data we lost beyond recovery was some Office docs which were open at
&gt; the time of the crash.  We also converted from kernel 2.2 to 2.4 and
&gt; upgraded reiser versions along with that without incident.
&gt;
&gt; We also have a number of smaller networks running Samba on reiserfs
&gt; partitions
&gt; and have had no trouble with those either.
&gt;
&gt; Now that RH 7.2 has ext3 available by default the last 2 servers we set up
&gt; used ext3 for the data shares, also no problems with those.  The other
&gt; reason
&gt; apart from ease of installation was obviously the backward compatibility
as
&gt; you mentioned.
&gt;
&gt; Just my 2c + GST
