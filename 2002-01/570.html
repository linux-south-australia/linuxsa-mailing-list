I'd love to move, alas there don't seem to be any alternatives for me.  IP
re-routing is such a trivial thing these days, as long as you get on to the
correct people and pre-plan, switching ISP's with your own public IP's
should be a non-event.

Oh, sorry, I guess a lot of people rely on their ISP's static IP addresses.
Hmm, that would cause concern.

C'mon Internode - offer me something - anything - away from Tel$tra....

I too have been with BPD for serval years and found them to very reliable
and professional.
The point that needs to be made hear is that as every ISP sales person
knows, once you have setup a client with their permanent connection, fix ip
on the email server etc. They are not going to move unless there is a very
good reason. I have one client that has a 2 meg link into Internode and has
a  large number of public ip no.s. To move this customer to another ISP
would involve a considerable amount of work and stress as the customer can't
stand being down for more then about 30sec.

The point here is that most business customers will tend to stay with the
ISP they started with unless something very bad happens.

&gt; &gt;That's been my experience, too.  I've been a BPD customer for 4½ years

&gt; &gt;everywhere else in the world they've gone down.
&gt;
&gt; So why do you stay with them?
