have you tried vmware?
it's a full virtual machine rather than an emulator.
I run it on my machine at work with nt installed inside it and word
for reading docs people send me.  Because it's all running under linux
it's stable and I have samba running to share my home dir etc so
it's all visible under linux or nt.

Only 2 catches really, it needs a reasonably grunty machine, it
runs fine on my P3-700-something with 256Mb ram dedicating 100Mb
to vmware, and it's not free software.

Another alternative may be OpenOffice - the successor to StarOffice.
Another list I'm on there's a bloke who's a developer for openoffice
and he reckons it's much much better than staroffice in all respects
but especially stability, simplicity and compatibility with the M$
office stuff.
