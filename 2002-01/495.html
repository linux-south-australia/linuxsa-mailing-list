Internode are about to offer a residential plan which is more reasonably
priced ( I hope ) but pricing / availability is still be announced.

Hoping they do it soon because I'm jumping off the Telstra ship pretty soon.
Cough Cough...Simon

P.S. IHug and Chariot are allegedly also going to be delivering ADSL
products soon. I would MUCH prefer to give my business to Internode.

P.P.S.  XIS is available in Adelaide but Netspace is not available here yet.

&gt; Subject: [OT] Telstra ADSL Price Increase
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Normally i wouldn't post an off topic email like this, but many users
&gt; here seems to be intrested in ADSL.
&gt;
&gt; If you havn't heard telstra are increasing their prices for BigPond
&gt; BoardBand internet service. The price increase can be found at
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.bigpond.com/PressRelease/bbADSL/">http://www.bigpond.com/PressRelease/bbADSL/</A>
&gt;
&gt; Sadly Telstra is the only viable solution for ADSL in Adeliade.
&gt; Internode are the only other company (that I know of) that offers ADSL
&gt; despite there service been vastly superior, it is also vastly more
&gt; expensive. For example,
&gt;
&gt; With Telstra, 3gig Freedom Deluxe Plan
&gt; $94.95 (with preselection) for 512/128 and 3 gig a month
&gt;
&gt; That works out to be about $0.031 a MB.
&gt;
&gt; With Internode, ADSL - 512k BRONZE plan
&gt; $100 for 512/128 and 500mb a month
&gt;
&gt; That works out to be $0.20 a MB
&gt;
&gt; Which means that Internode are over 6 times more expensive per MB! I
&gt; find it hard to justify improved survice for that kind of increase in
&gt; price.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; If we lived on the west coast these services would be avalible,
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.xis.com.au/adsl.html,">http://www.xis.com.au/adsl.html,</A> XiS MEGAwatt ADSL
&gt; $99.00 for 512/128 and 3 gig peak, 6 gig off peak a month
&gt;
&gt; That works out to be about $0.011 a MB
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/four/products/adsl/home/plans.shtml,">http://www.netspace.net.au/four/products/adsl/home/plans.shtml,</A> Home
&gt; Broadband 512
&gt; $99.95 for 512/128 and 3 gig peak, 6 gig off peak a month
&gt;
&gt; That works out to be about $0.011 a MB
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Both these services offer much better value than ADSL avalible in
&gt; Adelaide. Kinda wants to make you move.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Anyway i've had my complain about ADSL services avalible in Adelaide.
&gt; Looks like i'm going to have to stick with Telstra despite there price
&gt; increase :(
