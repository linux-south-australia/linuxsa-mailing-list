hmm, you should be writing to output file called (without the quotes)
"-"

ie. just a dash. That actually means "write to stdout" for programs.
I thought.. if you were doing that and it wasn't working, i don't know whats
going on.

&gt;
&gt; I will keep plugging at it - there must be some way to instruct it to
&gt; direct output to stdout?

see about.

&gt;
&gt; Failing that - can I take raw data from the soundcard device itself?  I
&gt; am not sure that I can.

it needs a few ioctls to set the speed, etc. default is 8bit 8000 hz or
something icky like that.

&gt; &gt; You could us "at" to set the time when it records easily enough.
&gt; &gt; at 5 am
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;recordradio.pl
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; ^D
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; at 6 am
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;stoprecording
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; ^D
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; etc
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; you'd then make the recordradio.pl script do something like
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; #!/usr/bin/perl
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; # record your PID so you can stop it later..
&gt; &gt; open(FOO, "/var/run/radio.pid");
&gt; &gt; print FOO "$$\n";
&gt; &gt; close(FOO);
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; # Record from line in to mpeg
&gt; &gt; print "Recording to output.mp3..\n";
&gt; &gt; # i'm guessing at the rec stuff, i haven't actualy tried it myself
&gt; &gt; # the lame options are for the fm radio preset, plus VBR mode enable.
&gt; &gt; system("rec --rate=44100 -t wav --size=w - | lame --preset fm --quiet
&gt; &gt; -v - output.mp3");
&gt; &gt; print "Recording has aborted for some reason.\n";
&gt; &gt; # remove the pid file
&gt; &gt; unlink("/var/run/radio.pid");
&gt; &gt; exit;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The stoprecording script would just need to be a bash script that does:
&gt; &gt; kill `cat /var/run/radio.pid`
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; i haven't tried this, but give it a go and see if it works.. I was thinking
&gt; &gt; about this exact situation last week, because some ppl i know do a show on
&gt; &gt; sunday mornings that i'd like to record, but am not in the mood at 9am!
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately my radio reception when its next to the computer prevented me
&gt; &gt; from actually trying out the stuff..
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps, and if you debug it and get it working, please post back to
&gt; &gt; the list..

&gt; &gt;&gt;Hi people,
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I would like to set up my Mandrake 8.1 box to record the radio and mpeg
&gt; &gt;&gt;compress it to set directories / dynamically updated filenames (by date)
&gt; &gt;&gt;at set times - so for example I can record a show of Radio National at
&gt; &gt;&gt;5am or whatever.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I figure I can plug a radio in the line in port on the soundcard and
&gt; &gt;&gt;then pipe that to a mpeg compression application somehow although I have
&gt; &gt;&gt;no idea how.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;If anyone is aware of a project already started up for this I would be
&gt; &gt;&gt;appreciative to be pointed in the right direction - or if anyone is able
&gt; &gt;&gt;to help me I would be happy.  Even if someone would like to come around
&gt; &gt;&gt;one day and I will shout some pizza / beer / etc to sit down and nut
&gt; &gt;&gt;this and some other Linux things out I would be very appreciative.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;It would be handy to extend this to a radio / tv card to record set
&gt; &gt;&gt;programs - and just set up a monthly schedule.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Would it be one day possible to route this through voice recognition
&gt; &gt;&gt;software to keep an eye out for interesting topics - say listening for
&gt; &gt;&gt;'Afghanistan' on talk back radio or something - I jnow this is
&gt; &gt;&gt;far-fetched but I thought I would ask anyhow.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;I am about to re-commence studies at Flinders University in politics
&gt; &gt;&gt;(international relations) and a tool like this would be immensely
&gt; &gt;&gt;helpful.  Perhaps later we can develop it to a point where other
&gt; &gt;&gt;students / universities would find such a tool to be useful also -
&gt; &gt;&gt;another way to get Linux on the map.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanks in advance!!!
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;
