&gt;BTW Simon, you say OS-X is OSS?  is it? I hadn't realised...
&gt;and what do you run it on?  an i-mac?  what platform(s) does it
&gt;work on?  (sorry very ignorant of mac type stuff, I've not touched
&gt;one since the little "all in one type 10-12" built in B&W monitor
&gt;things circa 1988).

OS-X is a commercial, licensed product built on an open source core 
called Darwin (see <A HREF="http://www.opensource.apple.com/">http://www.opensource.apple.com/</A>).

Sourceforge now have OS-X machines in their build farm, which just 
means that essentially anything you find that you want to build and 
plonk your linux box, you can just as easily build and plonk on your 
OS-X box.

It comes with all the usual good stuff compiled and running. Like 
Samba. Like Apache. Of course. And its a lovely, clean, attractive 
GUI, and it runs commercial apps as well, all at once, seamlessly.

You need to think about the deep implications of that. Not for a 
Linux user, but for a 'conventional' Windows PC user, for whom its a 
nice platform alternative to Windows, but if they move to it, they 
then have the entire leverage of the open source world 'under the 
hood' as well.

The implications of this are very, very deep.

It runs on any reasonably modern mac (and Apple didn't bother 
back-porting to older models - but because the kernel is open source, 
other people already have...!)

So basically a PowerPC based platform with enough ram and cpu - as 
for everything in the world :)

I personally run a 500Mhz Powerbook G4 laptop, and an 877 Mhz server 
unit plugged into a 22" wide 'cinema' flatscreen display at the 
office that has to be seen to be believed, and my home system is a 
G4/500 server with a 19" monitor.  All running OS-X.

And all including a barrage of free software with OS-X which is again 
amazing. iTunes (supporting iPod - which I have one of - they're the 
nicest MP3 player I've ever every seen or used), iPhoto (brilliant 
photograph management software), iDVD (burn your own DVD's with 
animated menus etc), iMovie (a $20,000 digital edit suite for $0). 
These are hugely hugely nice applications, and they're all free with 
the OS.

All that and a software development environment identical to the one 
I used to use (FreeBSD) under the hood, all smoothly integrated.

I do substantial amounts of software development in perl, committing 
over the network into the companies' central cvs repository, from my 
laptop. All in happy text windows running concurrently with all the 
usual Macintosh apps (which mean all the usual PC ones in practice - 
including Virtual PC when I really want to run something strange).

Because its built on an open source kernel (Mach derived, with 
FreeBSD as the reference platform for all the associated user and 
development tools), its solid as a rock. Uptime is as long as I want 
to leave the things on for. Unlike Windows. And *like* Linux. Of 
course.

This is a huge, huge penetration of open source powered technology 
into the mainstream, alongside, not in conflict with, Linux. The 
overall effects have to be positive ones.
