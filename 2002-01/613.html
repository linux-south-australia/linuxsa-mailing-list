&gt; also is suse 8.3 better
&gt; than red hat 7.2 or is there very little difference and is
it worth
&gt; changing to suse? thanks troy

 Hi There,
    I will not start a this is better than that war, but I
would recommend you try Suse and make your own decision.
Suse has a reputation of being the most up to date
distribution on the net, and so Suse 7.3 will certainly have
later package builds than RH 7.2, but better? that depends
on your own tastes.

    From an installation point of view, I found Suse 7.2
(the version of Suse I run)alot easier to install than RH
7.2, especially on my laptop. The advantage of being so
advanced is that it tends to "know" more hardware than other
distributions. I am still feeling my way around the tools
that come with Suse (as many of them are different to RH),
but as I work out what they do I become more comfortable
with them. I found the Suse install of KDE and StarOffice
quite good after struggling a bit with the RH install of
these packages. Suse also comes with ALOT of packages to
play with.

    I would recommend that if you are going to try Suse, get
the 7.3 Professional version with 7 CDs and a DVD. The
Documentation that comes with it is excellent, and far
better than what I have seen from RH so far. The package
isn't cheap, but it is well worth the money. The
configuration guides are very comprehensive, and easy to
use.

    As far as changing goes, make your own decision. I still
run a RH server for my net connection, and Suse for my
desktop and laptop. My wife runs RH. I was using Gnome with
RH and have started using KDE with Suse, so there are lots
to try out. Good Luck, and hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.
