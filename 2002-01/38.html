If you spool your email into your home linux box, you would be able 
to read messages as they arrived on your server. This makes your 
linux box the end point for the SMTP transmissions to you, rather 
than your ISP's smtp server being that end point. You would then read 
messages from your own local machine via PoP or imap over your local 
network, or via direct filesystem access on the local machine.

You'd also want a domain name so you can associate an MX record into 
your machine with it. But since your own domain name makes you a much 
cooler person, its easily worth the $$ :)

You can then run as many email destinations on your system as you 
like because you've become your own Internet mail server.

[You can also experience the joys of needing to configure it to block 
spam relaying (which, fortunately, is on by default in decent mail 
servers now) - but this is linuxsa - you wanted to learn more about 
linux, didn't you? :) ]

Your machine can be an SMTP end point if it is on a permanent link 
(its trivial this way). That can be via modem, or ISDN, or ADSL, or 
whatever.

Good ISP's can also offer you the capability to have a permanent IP 
address associated with your dial account, and to have your email 
spool into your box whenever you dial up, either automatically 
(auto-detecting your presence) or triggered by you (via an SMTP ETRN 
command).

The point here is that these things all move the SMTP end-point right 
in to your own machine. So as each message arrives in your system, it 
turns up at the back of /var/mail/yournamehere and you can read it 
then - while other messages are still turning up.

Take the opportunity to swap from bigpond to a real ISP while you're at it :)

If this is all too complicated, here are two simpler alternatives:

1) Some mail clients (Eudora, for instance) let you tell them to only 
download the first &lt;x&gt; kilobytes of each message via PoP, and if you 
want the rest later, you manually trigger a subsequent 'pull' of the 
rest of the message. That allows a rapid assimilation of what mail is 
there, without the download delays.

It is, however, ultimately a pretty annoying way to work (IMHO).

2) Just get a faster Internet link, so the time to download 300 
messages becomes trivial (ADSL comes to mind).

Cheers,
Simon

p.s. of course, the really nifty approach is imap rather than pop. 
But imap is very much an 'on-line' protocol, especially if you want 
to read headers only now, and pull messages 'on-demand' as you read 
them. And no rational ISP will support you using imap[*], you'll want 
to run this on your own linux box, which means engaging one of the 
options noted above anyway, at which point all the mail downloads to 
your machine while you sleep anyway and its already on your local 
hard drive...

[*] Because imap leaves all the mail on the server, all the time. 
Which is a blessing if it is -your- hard disk, and a curse (for your 
ISP) if it was theirs...rapidly becomes untenable in the latter case.

&gt;I'm currently using Kmail and MS Outlook (for more important stuff).
&gt;
&gt;Is there a way of actually seeing incoming mail as they arrive one by one?
&gt;Over a normal modem, it would be nice to actually start reading the first of
&gt;300 incoming emails as they arrive.
