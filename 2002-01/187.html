Hi Richard

I'm after some notes for a beginner - mediocre users course.

&gt; Well, it varies. I believe different TAFEs do different courses. In
&gt; fact, I think there is more than one Linux course at most TAFEs...
&gt; Perhaps if you could indicate which course at which TAFE, it may help :)
&gt; ...
&gt;
&gt; Last term, I taught the "Implementing Multi-User Operating Systems"
&gt; course, which was the first course I've taught... It was OK, but I can't
&gt; say much for the curriculum really -- it was out of date, and difficult
&gt; to "implement" in a class of 10-20 with old crufty machines... :)
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I think that the quality of a course varies firstly on the
&gt; quality of the materials the course is based on, then on the quality of
&gt; the teacher. If the course material is crud, then you depend on the
&gt; teacher to make up for it. If it's good material, then an average
&gt; teacher can do a reasonable job of it, but a good teacher will make it
&gt; great (a great teacher would inspire a moving drama starring Matt Damon,
&gt; based on the true story of a boy who was a sysadmin genius without a
&gt; computer who was finally given the opportunity to use a real bash
&gt; prompt...)
&gt;
&gt; As for notes, try rute.sourceforge.net and potentially IIT Training (the
&gt; notes Richard Sharpe has worked on)...
