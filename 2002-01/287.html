Hi,

OT but does any1 know a good source for what products phone home, what
addresses they contact and on what ports etc?

I'd run a sniffer but I spend less then an hour a days in Windows on
average.

I've searched around using Google a bit but didn't find anything much (I
never can seem to find good resources for Windows on the net).

I've got a legit copy of XP here that I haven't connected to the Net
yet, but when I do I want to stop all outgoing phone homes. (Zone Alarm
is decent for doing this without a seperate firewall box).

Cheers,
Martin de Koning

P.S. Though I might download patches for XP, so I went to the corporate
update site (Allows dload of patches as a complete single file, rather
then over Net upgrade) only to find out it requires IE5.5 with ASP
support (Should I expect different?) :)

&gt; &gt; Errmm... i dont think this is possible. Surely it would atleast wait
&gt; &gt; till the internet connection was setup?
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't think so either.  It would have to get an address that your
&gt; router/masq could NAT or route to the Internet.  How would it know this?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I installed XP a week or so a go on a spare HDD, and I have heard that
&gt; &gt; it did "phone home" back to the devil himself, so I set up a packet
&gt; &gt; sniffer especially for the purpose of catching XP calling it's
&gt; &gt; mothership.
&gt; 
&gt; Office 2000 does a phone home over the Internet.  A friend of mine
&gt; installed a "legitimate" version of it (his father owns it and had it
&gt; installed on a computer already) and when he set it up he put in his
&gt; mailing address and all that stuff you put in to make envelopes and
&gt; letters easier to make. Well anyway, it phoned home and he got a letter
&gt; from M$ telling him to please remove the software immediately or to
&gt; purchase a licensed version (put your credit card in here and post
&gt; back).
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Out of interest, here is what sniffit reported in the headers.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; GET /download/msprod/CodeSignPCA.crl HTTP/1.0
&gt; &gt; Accept: */*
&gt; &gt; User-Agent: CryptRetrieveObjectByUrl::InetSchemeProvider
&gt; &gt; Host: crl.microsoft.com
&gt; &gt; Connection: Keep-Alive
&gt; &gt; Pragma: no-cache
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I only noticed one single packet, the content looks to be encrypted to
&gt; &gt; me. Can give any one a copy of the log if they want it...
&gt; 
&gt; There's info about your computer, and the key you put into XP when you
&gt; install it.  They use it to issue license keys for the software...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; On an Aside, there were australian federal police poking around outside
&gt; &gt; my place around at 3am the other morning... Associated?
&gt; 
&gt; Just trying to figure if this is serious... really?  Were they snooping
&gt; at your place or just in the general area? 
&gt; 
&gt; Although anyone that uses a GPG sig at the bottom of their emails is
&gt; bound to attract attention from the feds after Sep11.  Damn, you might
&gt; be sending encrypted email to terrorists.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
