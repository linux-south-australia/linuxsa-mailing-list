Aristole,

I think what you'll find that in any large group, a small proportion are
the pedantic ones. I'd wager that the vast majority of Linux/Unix users
do not concern themselves in relatively pointless issues like HTML mail
and Vi vs Emacs wars.

On the topic of idealistic preferences to IT systems, at the last
LinuxSA meeting I was having some discussions with a few people on the
new Apple iMacs. For the kind of demographic at the meetings I wasn't
too surprised that some people dislike Macs. 

My point of view is that computers should have function (powerful,
flexible, easy to use, environmentally sound), as well as form
(aesthetics, human inspirations) integral to a product. The fact that
some people who may of had a different point of view doesn't mean we
resort to bashing each other's ideologies with each other.

Enjoy and appreciate what Linux offers (which is a lot), and try and
ignore the petty arguments and extremists who are driven to just draw
attention to themselves.  

Cheers,

I spotted this post on Slashdot today which I found amusing (and true):

(User #61554 Info)

*  Dell/Microsoft computers = Honda Accords, Toyota Camrys = Chili's
restaurant

Standardized up the wazoo, gives pretty good service, aimed squarely at
middle-class consumers that want value and reliability at not too high
of a price.

* Emachine/Microsoft computers = Geo Metros = McDonald's

Extremely standardized (to the lowest level), very cheap... aimed at
consumers who want/need the product (be it food, cars, computers) at the
least cost. Products aren't as reliable and may produce breakdowns as a
side effect (gastric or mechanical). Product as a commodity.

* Compaq/Microsoft computers = rental cars = products from Sysco (a food
supplier for most restaurants)

Not bad products, aimed at their target segments (companies that need
lots of them) mostly for price and cost of ownership (although in
Compaq's case, that's debatable).

* Apple computers = new VW beetle, Ford Thunderbird = Bellini's Italian
restaurant

Aimed at upscale, upper-middle and upper class image-conscious consumers
who usually don't know too much about the product they're buying.
Product hallmarks are that it looks cool, nobody will look down on you
for buying their products (except the next segment), they're usually
overpriced, it looks cool, and they have good reliability, service, and
ease of use. Did I mention it looks cool? Underneath the appearance,
they have pretty standard, very good quality components.

* Do-it-yourself/*nix computer = custom-job Corvettes and Mustangs =
people who cook their own food, and are excellent at it too (Mom!)

Products that are usually upgraded from stock products by people with a
high knowledge of what they're doing with it. In Mom's case, she goes to
the grocery store and cooks some damn fine pasta from ingredients she
gets there. Sometimes she orders ingredients from specialized stores. In
the computer geek's case, they take a stock computer (or build one
themselves) and replace and upgrade the parts they choose. And we all
have a car geek friend who can tell the 20 different modifications to a
'69 Mustang just by listening when someone revs it up. (Sometimes we are
that person.)

&gt; M$ - for all it's evils - at least has its act together and knows where

&gt; My 2.2 cents worth.

&gt; &gt; Hi all...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; If you have ever wondered what OS bigots look like from the other side,
&gt; &gt; I recommend you join another OS's mailing list or newsgroup for a while.
&gt; &gt; The things that they do are the same things as Linux bigots do, except
&gt; &gt; for the fact that you may not agree with their point of view. It gets
&gt; &gt; even more fun if you make a well-reasoned attempt to provide an
&gt; &gt; alternative point of view. Personally, I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; &gt; all bigots are dolts. Complete and utter dolts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Here's an eg of what you may see (taken from a Solaris x86 mailing
&gt; &gt; list):
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "[No OS] so far has stacked up to Solaris, Never will and Never CAN."
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Replace Solaris with any OS, or in fact, any language, editor, licence,
&gt; &gt; or whatever, and it loses none of its stupidity. I write this simply to
&gt; &gt; point out to Linux (and BSD) bigots that it's, as they say, "not a good
&gt; &gt; look". Even things that sound sensible to people absorbed into the
&gt; &gt; culture of one OS can sound completely absurd to any other group of
&gt; &gt; people...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Another quote, in response to me suggesting that maybe Sun is going to
&gt; &gt; focus on Linux at the low end as their mechanism to draw people into
&gt; &gt; Solaris/SPARC:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; "Hey everybody run over run over and give Linus a big kiss between the
&gt; &gt; crack in his rear end.  He is our savor!"
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; And so on...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Replace Linux with Scott McNeally or Bill Gates, and it still sounds
&gt; &gt; just as dumb. Particularly when you can't spell saviour.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Anyway, if you can't see my point here, I recommend you join another
&gt; &gt; OS's list (or get somewhere where you can view that community), and
&gt; &gt; whenever something dumb is said, turn it into a pro-linux statement, and
&gt; &gt; note that it sounds just as dumb.
