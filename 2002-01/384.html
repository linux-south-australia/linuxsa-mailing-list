Hello,

I wonder if you can use rsync to sync the data from the laptop to the
desktop and then use it to move it back.  Not sure if this would work as
my experience with rsync is pretty limited and dated, but maybe someone
else on the list will know?

Regards
Mark

&gt; Hi -
&gt; 
&gt; I dual boot win98 (work requirement :( ) and linux, in an arrangement that looks like this:
&gt; /dev/hda1 / reiserfs noatime,notail 1 1
&gt; /dev/hda3 /win vfat defaults 0 0
&gt; /dev/hda5 swap swap defaults 0 0
&gt; /dev/hda6 /home reiserfs noatime,notail 1 2
&gt; /dev/hda7 /data vfat umask=0 0 0  # So I can share data between linux and 'doze
&gt; 
&gt; Windows went berserk and mangled the filesystem on /dev/hda3 beyond recognition. Partition Magic says that the partitions overlap and it can't fix them, and even if it could, win98 doesn't seem to want to reinstall on a disk with linux already there (it tries to format the disk as soon as it boots - no confirmation, nothing). 
&gt; 
&gt; So it seems I need to backup, partition from scratch, and then install linux and 'doze in that order. The linux boot still works perfectly and I really don't want to have to reinstall it. Is there any way (ghost? tar?) I can turn the linux partitions into image files, then bring them back once I've repartitioned? I gather that just tarring up /, then restoring it won't leave me with a working system.
&gt; 
&gt; There are some logistical problems too - the machine is a laptop with a single 4GB disk, with about 200mb free (not counting the cratered 1.3GB win partition). I have a netcard, plus a burner on a desktop machine.
&gt; 
&gt; This is looking like it's going to be a very painful experience for a linux newbie - can anyone give me some ideas?
