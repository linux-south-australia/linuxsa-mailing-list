Hi...

I'm having network trouble, and I'm not entirely sure how to go about
diagnosing it -- I've never had anything quite like this before.

Situation is that I have a headless old linux server inconveniently
located, and a newish winXP desktop (yeah yeah). They are connected by
10/100 ethernet -- each has a RTL8039 card, going through a D-Link
switch. I've never had trouble before with this connection, but now,
when I `ping -c 1000 &lt;winxp&gt;` from the linux box, I lost 40-50% of
packets all the time. It _appears_ as if these packets are fairly
random, with a few runs of dropped packets, but mostly random. Here's
the ping -c 1000 summary:

--- 192.168.0.2 ping statistics ---
1000 packets transmitted, 512 packets received, 48% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.4/0.5/1.5 ms

Evidently, packets are either getting through no problems, or being
lost. None are delayed by any great margin (but then, I don't think I'd
expect that anyway).

Is there any way to find out where the packets are being lost, without
just changing ethernet cards, the switch and the cables? I can run RH7.2
on my winxp desktop as well, so I can diagnose from both ends...

I'm at a loss here, and it's driving me insane -- my winxp box is
slowing down massively because it's too stupid to deal with an
unreliable link without screwing everything else up as well (sorry, I'm
bitter)
