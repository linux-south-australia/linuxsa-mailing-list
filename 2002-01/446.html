Microsoft memo to staff: Clobber Linux
(USA Today)


SEATTLE -- Microsoft is escalating its war against Linux, the free
operating system begun as a hobby of Internet dabblers but increasingly
the darling of bankers, retailers and Hollywood special effects wizards.

In a Dec. 26 memo leaked this week to technology Web site 
theregister.uk.com,
  Microsoft Senior Vice President Brian Valentine urges his Windows
sales force to "modify" traditional approaches and "dig deeper" to
find out where companies are using Linux.

Valentine assures his troops they will soon get "independent" studies
and spreadsheet tools useful for obliterating "the perception that
Linux is free." Microsoft will probably try to show that Linux is
costly to maintain and service over the long term, experts say.

"We're working hard to debunk myths around Linux," he writes. "We'
re approaching this in waves."

Microsoft declines to comment on Valentine's call to arms. The software
giant considers his rallying cry simply being proactive in the marketplace,
  says a source familiar with the matter. But the memo has been a hot
topic in industry circles, and some observers say it could ultimately
backfire.

Unlike others Microsoft has vanquished, Linux is more a grass-roots
religion than a vulnerable corporate target. While Microsoft jealously
guards its core software code, Linux code is open and continually
improved by thousands of top programmers around the world who believe
software should benefit society.

"The open source community may be one of the greatest volunteer movements
in history," says Matthew Szulik, CEO of Linux distributor Red Hat.

IBM, Hewlett-Packard and others have begun bundling Linux into computer
hardware, while business software makers like Oracle and SAP, now
routinely fold it into their product lines. Microsoft accounts for
42% of the server software shipped annually, compared with 27% for
Linux, according to IDC.

Last fall e-merchant Amazon.com converted most of its computer servers
to Linux in time to handle the holiday shopping season, and most of
the cutting-edge animation seen in Hollywood films is now processed
with Linux software.

Some think Microsoft should likewise embrace Linux. But Valentine'
s memo suggests Microsoft is resorting to old tactics at the risk
of giving Linux a bigger forum to tout its success stories, says Dan
Kusnetzky, an analyst with research firm IDC.

"Microsoft is taking a combative approach because it has worked so
well in the past," Kusnetzky notes.

Microsoft's 92% monopoly of desktop operating systems remains untouchable,
  experts say. Ransom Love, CEO of Linux distributor Caldera International,
  speculates that Microsoft may have purposely leaked Valentine's memo
hoping to lighten scrutiny of antitrust regulators here and abroad.
"They have to play up competitive threats to ease pressures from 
governments
around the world," Love says. "Microsoft uses whatever tactics it
takes to win . . . at all costs."
