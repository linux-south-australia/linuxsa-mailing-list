&gt;&gt; Also, try telling that to one of my friends: He has an Athlon XP 1600+
&gt;&gt; (IIRC) running at 1050MHz (bus underclocked to 100 not 133) and it still
&gt;&gt; runs hot (like 60 degrees hot) even when the CPU is near-idle. (The OS
&gt;&gt; is WinXP, not that it really matters).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; His heatsink is hefty, so that's not at fault. (Maybe it needs thermal
&gt;&gt; transfer paste?). It's also a decent size case, though it is in a
&gt;
&gt;I believe thermal transfer paste is HIGHLY recommended by AMD.

&lt;bandwagon&gt;

Thermal paste is only good if you are able to get the heat out of the case,
big fans on the CPU only without venting the case properly are as useless.

Poor case design causes 90% of the problems with overheating PC's, it all
comes down to what air-flow there is inside the case (either natural or
assisted ie fans).   A majority of Video Card failure is attributable to
the location of the AGP slot being at the top of the PCI slots, way up near
the Power Supply.   Good cases have fans either in the bottom of the power
supply or on the rear of this case above the AGP slot to clear the heat
from these 3D video cards which is not insignificant, the remaining cases
do nothing other than cook video cards.   The same goes for HDD's in the 3
1/2" slots all jammed together with poor circulation, removable HDD caddies
are great as then vent quite nicely.   A majority of processors are cooked
from inadequate CPU heatsinking -*AND* - inadequate case ventilation.

I have a fair number of Athlons (XP1000 -&gt; XP1900+) running with stock
heatsinks but with suitable cases and upgraded cooling fans, ambient
conditions vary from 20-45degC (ie no additional refrig cooling in room)
all processors operate less than 20degC above ambient.  I never cooked a
processor/video card or HDD in any machine, last uptime check of first
machine was 413 days :) no need to mention the operating system.   Good
case/heat/ventilation of a PC will lengthen the life of any computer and
improve its reliability significantly.

Heating inside of a case it often overlooked, she will be right jack is no
longer adequate with these new machines.   Your typical case is usually
fairly well sealed, in a majority there is a single fan in the power supply
with maybe one or two additional case fan mounting locations.   Your
typical desktop with one HDD, one CDROM, video/processor/all in one
motherboard are usually spread out quite a way so there is *some* natural
ventillation.   Add additional components (CD-R, DVD, HDD#2, HDD#3 etc) and
you will end up in trouble.  With machines approaching 300W average
consumption this is only 1/8th that of your kettle !   Anyone want a cuppa
coffee ?
