Here's a few interesting comments from a Solaris mailing list that may
be interesting to some people.

&gt; &gt; Sadly, those days are long gone.  I don't think I've filed 
&gt; a software 
&gt; &gt; bug report with Sun in a decade because I grew tired of performing 
&gt; &gt; exhaustive tests, sometimes *giving them* the fix to the 
&gt; source (which 
&gt; &gt; I could do because we had a source license) plus the fix to 
&gt; the manual 
&gt; &gt; page plus all the test results before/after....and having it all 
&gt; &gt; apparently disappear into a black hole.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; If this is the way it is, why does anybody wonder why Linux 
&gt; is more popular?  At least with Linux, you get ALL the 
&gt; source, and you are guaranteed future improvements by the 
&gt; license.  This seems like a classic example of how the 
&gt; proprietary source model has truly failed.... no matter how 
&gt; good the OS is or was, everyone who recommended it now has 
&gt; egg on their faces because Sun has betrayed them.  I do not 
&gt; think "betrayed" is too strong a word.  This has definitely 
&gt; lowered my estimation of Sun as a company.  What good is 
&gt; support like you mentioned above?  It deserved to die.  How 
&gt; much is such support worth?  $0. in my estimation. 
&gt; 
&gt; As someone who formerly worked for a proprietary software 
&gt; company, I have seen bugfixes get swept under the rug, and 
&gt; it's not pretty. Upper management can kill a product by such 
&gt; foolish decisions. Maybe Sun's reputation is merely based on 
&gt; nostalgia.  I certainly couldn't recommend any of their 
&gt; servers, knowing that they could 
&gt; kill a product at any time on the basis of market conditions.
