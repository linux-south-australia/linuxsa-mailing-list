Just a quick comment about the (in)ability of users to use complex things..
Sometimes people can surprise you with what they can figure out, if you just
let them do it themselves, instead of butting in with "no no no, here, let
me do it" or whatever.

I caught up with my parents a little while ago, and my mother mentioned that
she hadn't been able to install a new version of some software she used on
her PC.. The instructions said you had to remove the old version first, and
she'd done that through windows control panel.. new version still didn't
install.
So, she removed that version, then searched the harddrive to find related
remaining program directories for that program, and renamed them, then went
thru the registry and searched for and deleted all references there too.
After this, the new version installed fine. End of story.

So, she figured out how to:
* locate relevant files
* adjust configuration files directly
* search for info on how to deal with a problem
* perform undo-able actions (ie. rename, not delete)
* learn from trial and error
* understand concepts involved, rather than blindly following the NEXT&gt;
  button, and giving up if it didn't work.

Now, that sounds very similar to managing a modern Linux distro!
If I gave my parents a copy of Mandrake 8.1, I reckon they'd manage to
install and use it fine on their own. They'd probably get annoyed when
Abiword crashes doing cut-n-paste, or by not getting the same level of
options for their colour printer, but thats not their fault.

So, anyway, if you haven't fallen asleep by now, my point is that Windows
required complex operations to make it perform happily. So does Linux.
Linux will work in a "degraded" kind of way, just like Windows, if you can't
keep up with stuff like manually adjusting things occaisionally, updating
it, etc.

So, don't put down "Average" users too much; I think their main issues with
Linux would be application support and integration, rather than the actual
day-to-day running and use of the system.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Take for example this passionate opposition to HTML email owing to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the stubborn determination of many community members to use the most
&gt; &gt; &gt; complicated text editor imaginable (vi or Emacs) for email and look
&gt; &gt; &gt; down on people who don't with disdain - even though Vi is a remnant
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the days before computer screens when a printer was the only form
&gt; &gt; &gt; of output.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is not true that there is a "stubborn determination of many
&gt; &gt; community members to use the most complicated text editor imaginable
&gt; &gt; (vi or Emacs) for email".  Un*x people use Pine, Elm, Kmail, Mutt, you
&gt; &gt; name it.  Almost none would use vi or emacs.
&gt;
&gt; Firstly, neither vi or emacs are hard to use. They're downright child's
&gt; play, especially if you're using the X-capable version of each.
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, Mutt uses vi as its editor by default. It's quite useable -- I
&gt; lived with it for quite a while until I changed it to Emacs.
&gt;
&gt; Lastly, your assertion that "Almost none would use vi or emacs" is just
&gt; plain wrong. What about Gnus or VM? They're quite popular mailers. Mutt
&gt; uses vi by default, and I believe you can configure Pine to use vi as
&gt; the message editor, too. I've used vi and emacs with my mailer for ages.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Nor is it true that the objection to HTML is based on editor
&gt; &gt; capability.  The objection is based on (1) the fact that HTML
&gt; &gt; significantly increases bandwidth without adding anything to message
&gt; &gt; legibility and (2) the fact that HTML messages can (and do) force the
&gt; &gt; receiver to download images and other trivia which can cause
&gt; &gt; inconvenience to the receiver.
&gt;
&gt; The main thing with HTML is the inconsistency. On one mailer, it's going
&gt; to look quite readable. I general, if we were to go by the way /our/ own
&gt; HTML-capable mailers can send HTML mail, I'm sure we'd be wondering what
&gt; the problem with it is.
&gt;
&gt; Take your HTML message to another MUA, and you're sure to find that the
&gt; message doesn't display the way you thought that it would. When you deal
&gt; with plain text, that issue's not there.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today's savvy home users are editing DV video, creating
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high-quality digital photo albums, playing high end 3D games, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creating DVD-R movies of their kid's birthdays.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Doesn't this last paragraph give the lie to your idea that users are
&gt; &gt; not in a position to use "complex" software?
&gt;
&gt; Playing 3D games isn't exactly brain surgery. Neither is editing video
&gt; or cutting a DVD movie. A Macintosh is testament to that.
&gt;
&gt; The general populous isn't in a position to use the CLI, for example.
&gt; That's what counts as complex. Using a mailer where everything has to be
&gt; done using keystrokes rather than the mouse is too complex for most
&gt; people (ie, Mutt, Pine, Elm, etc.).
&gt;
&gt; Linux /is/ making progress, there's no doubt. Organisations like Ximian
&gt; are making it that much easier for people to use Linux these days.
&gt; They've developed a functional, GUI-based mailer and a rather useful
&gt; tool to rival "Windows Update".
&gt;
&gt; They're getting there, but they've still got some work to do.
