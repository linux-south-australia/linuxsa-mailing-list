I know exactly what you mean - this is why *nix systems are doomed to 
die in my opinion - people still argue about stupid crap like is HTML 
email a valid format and why vi is better than Emacs while no one who 
actually uses computers for more than programming uses these monstrous 
'editors' anyhow.  Most people want to write letters to their granny - 
not rewrite the kernel.

M$ - for all it's evils - at least has its act together and knows where 
it is going.  It's probably why Bill does not put as much effort in to 
killing off open source as he could - he knows that it will kill itself 
off eventually owing to internal fractioning.

My 2.2 cents worth.

&gt; Hi all...
&gt; 
&gt; If you have ever wondered what OS bigots look like from the other side,
&gt; I recommend you join another OS's mailing list or newsgroup for a while.
&gt; The things that they do are the same things as Linux bigots do, except
&gt; for the fact that you may not agree with their point of view. It gets
&gt; even more fun if you make a well-reasoned attempt to provide an
&gt; alternative point of view. Personally, I've come to the conclusion that
&gt; all bigots are dolts. Complete and utter dolts.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's an eg of what you may see (taken from a Solaris x86 mailing
&gt; list):
&gt; 
&gt; "[No OS] so far has stacked up to Solaris, Never will and Never CAN."
&gt; 
&gt; Replace Solaris with any OS, or in fact, any language, editor, licence,
&gt; or whatever, and it loses none of its stupidity. I write this simply to
&gt; point out to Linux (and BSD) bigots that it's, as they say, "not a good
&gt; look". Even things that sound sensible to people absorbed into the
&gt; culture of one OS can sound completely absurd to any other group of
&gt; people...
&gt; 
&gt; Another quote, in response to me suggesting that maybe Sun is going to
&gt; focus on Linux at the low end as their mechanism to draw people into
&gt; Solaris/SPARC:
&gt; 
&gt; "Hey everybody run over run over and give Linus a big kiss between the
&gt; crack in his rear end.  He is our savor!"
&gt; 
&gt; And so on...
&gt; 
&gt; Replace Linux with Scott McNeally or Bill Gates, and it still sounds
&gt; just as dumb. Particularly when you can't spell saviour.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, if you can't see my point here, I recommend you join another
&gt; OS's list (or get somewhere where you can view that community), and
&gt; whenever something dumb is said, turn it into a pro-linux statement, and
&gt; note that it sounds just as dumb.
