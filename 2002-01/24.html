Tim,

I have freesco running on an old 486 (with the optional hd) and was using las 
(lite account system) to collect stat about my traffic and show it.  Won't 
actively stop exceeding you limit but at least you can look at your usage.

try: <A HREF="http://www.freescosoft.com/home/v0.2.7/3rdparty/g-l.htm">http://www.freescosoft.com/home/v0.2.7/3rdparty/g-l.htm</A>

There was/is a Windoze add-on that interrogates las and provides progressive 
daily and month totals/graphs - I'm pretty sure there is a linux version.

Btw - I'm looking at moving off freesco to either e-smith, smoothwall or 
mandrake's firewall offering (all need at least a pentium and a hd)as these 
seem to provide better reporting of probes plus some other useful features.

Having said that, freesco has been v reliable and allowed an old 486 to be 
gainfully employed in its 'retirement'.  Also, there is a fairly active 3rd 
party s/w development group for freesco add-ons as you can see from the 
supplied url.  As to security - try probing it, once installed, via 
<A HREF="http://www.grc.com">http://www.grc.com</A> - it seems pretty good considering its default installation.

Cheers,

TonyR

&gt; Tim,
&gt; 
&gt; I have BP DSL with a mini linux distro firewall setup (freesco) on a
&gt; Dx4-133 (an amd) on 8mb of ram
&gt; 2 el-crappo network cards 1 100mb HDD. Eth0 to dsl modem and eth1 to hub
&gt; for lan, it works very well for me (your mileage may vary) (it too was
&gt; using a modem before I got DSL)
&gt; 
&gt; I had to do some loading of RP pppoe software but it wasn't hard and it is
&gt; well supported very much a turnkey setup.
&gt; 
&gt; you can also fatten it up with other modules as the need arises but more
&gt; ram required obviously, comes on a single floppy (initially)
&gt; 
&gt; As for the 3gb CAP stay away call netspace they have hybrid plan which is
&gt; 3gb peak (7-midnight)and 7gb (midnight-7)non-peak. In the archives there
&gt; was some mention of Internode doing similar or offering netspaces plans
&gt; here.
&gt; 
&gt; But if you do go for BP then you will have to watch what you do, I manage
&gt; ok but I do get close. There is no surefireway of stopping short of 3gb to
&gt; protect yourself short of turning the modem off.

&gt; &gt;Hi,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I'm thinking of signing up for Telstras ADSL service.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I would want to connect this to my local lan to allow all computers in
&gt; &gt;my house access to the net. I would like to run a linux NAT gateway and
&gt; &gt;firewall, i currently have a similar system with my modem. The NAT
&gt; &gt;gateway is currently an old 486-DX100 with 8mb of ram and realtek
&gt; &gt;network card, it handels the load of the modem without breaking a sweat.
&gt; &gt;Would this computer be able to handle the 40/50k a second that ADSL
&gt; &gt;provides?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;As well i'm worried about the 3 gig cap, i'm afraid that i'll end up
&gt; &gt;with a huge bill for meg passed this cap. Can anyone recommend good
&gt; &gt;software to make sure that the cap isn't passed?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for your help.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;PS Has anyone does Telstra's "Self Insterlation" option?
&gt; &gt;PSS Has anyone got evolutions spell checker working and can give me a
&gt; &gt;quick hint? There are like 500 refrences on the mailing list and none
&gt; &gt;seem to work :(
