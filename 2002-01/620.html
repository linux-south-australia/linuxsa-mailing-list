Hi Brian,

Ok, perhaps I will admit to 'age and decrepitude, not to mention 
incompetence'. 

A few years back I passed onto my son all I knew about IT and also gave 
him the skills to work out solutions for himself. Now when I get a 
problem I have to ask him how to fix it as I have forgotten how I used 
to fix these damn things &lt;G&gt;

Maybe it is my Sometimers cutting in &lt;VBG&gt;

Cheers, Ian

I remember the ads for the Superboard, got really tempting many times.

BTW, the Sinclair only saved to tape, when the rotten thing actually 
saved, plus it only ran through a TV or composite video. One of the 
first attachments was to improve the video out as well as hardwire the 
16k RAMPack and put on a decent keyboard. It was still an excellent 
computer and had a huge potential.

Wonder if anybody ever got Linux to run on it? &lt;G&gt;

Cheers,  Ian

&gt; 
&gt; OK, my first computer was a Texas Instruments Superboard II, 4K 
&gt; RAM, 8K BASIC 
&gt; in ROM, came as a kit, no power supply, no mass storage, no VDU. 
&gt; Added audio 
&gt; tape 'mass' storage, added power supply, added B&W TV, wrote a 
&gt; spreadsheet 
&gt; app, bought shares, used spreadsheet app to track performance, 
&gt; still poor.
