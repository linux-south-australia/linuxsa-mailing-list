Hi Tin

Work on getting your SM200d working first.
1. Log on to a PC that is not on your network and ping the sat ip address.
2. Run tcpdump the sm200d interface and see if the pings request are coming
in. If they are then you sm200d is working correctly.
3. Do a tcpdump on the out going link (ppp or Ethernet depending on you
config) if the replies are going out then the problem is with someone
upstream from you (ie your isp). If not then you have a problem with the
config on your Linux PC.
    A) check that ip forwarding is turned on (cat
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward should be 1)
    B) do you have a firewall in the way (turn it of as a test)
    C) have you got ip spoofing turned on (cat cat
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/sm200d/rp_filter should be 0)

Cheers
    Mike O'Connor

P.S. if you need help with getting an external ping I have help you there
just contact me of list

&gt; &gt; Hi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have a redhat 7.2 server which i am trying to get satellite internet
to
&gt; &gt; work on. As far as we can tell, the reciever card (SM200D) is working
fine
&gt; &gt; so we are trying to get the routing and PPTP issues sorted out.
&gt; &gt; The problem goes that PPTP doesnt seem to do anything.
&gt; &gt; Ive tried to use the pptp-command program but when it gets to writing
the
&gt; &gt; config, it just dies with an error (cant remember exactly what, I'm not
in
&gt; &gt; the same place as the server right now, so I cant check).
&gt; &gt; Ive tried manually setting it up using a few different howtos. This gets
me
&gt; &gt; to the point where PPTP appears to start if I run it, but there is no
&gt; &gt; interface created so I cant route packets thru it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Should I have the ppp link to the ISP up before i load PPTP, or should I
try
&gt; &gt; to get PPTP to load the connection? I have tried both ways but still no
&gt; &gt; luck.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If anyone knows a fair bit about this stuff, please help. I need any
info
&gt; &gt; about PPTP and routing thru it.
&gt;
&gt; Well, I don't know anything about PPTP (I had to look it up to find
&gt; out what it was), but why don't you get your satellite link working
&gt; first?  I can help you with that if you need any.  And yes, that
&gt; includes the uplink.
