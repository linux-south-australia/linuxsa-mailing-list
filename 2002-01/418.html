&gt; I was fiddling with a freebsd  4.4 setup and temporarily set up an FTP 
&gt; server to hold some files. What was quite amazing was the speed, it was 
&gt; blindingly fast compared to my RH7.2 server. As a sort of test I 
&gt;  reinstalled a server version of  RH7.2 on the same machine as the 
&gt; freebsd system and tried both with the same  set of files. The BSD 
&gt; server was about 5 times faster for the same test.

As Toby said, it may be to do with the TCP options. Have a look through
the sysctl(8) variables regarding tcp.

# sysctl -a | grep net.inet.tcp

Compare them to the default options employed by RedHat.

&gt; Redhat is running wu-ftp and BSD was running the native one that comes 
&gt; with it.

That's a fair enough test, IMO. That is if you're attempting to compare 
the speed attainable by each OS in its default configuration.

&gt; Anyone know the reasons for such a big performance diff. I could take my 
&gt; own guess re how the ftp proggys work but it is a significant diff, 
&gt; that's for sure.

Well, wu-ftpd is available from ports. Install it, change the line in
inetd.conf to reflect the different ftp daemon and run your test again.

# cd /usr/ports/ftp/wu-ftpd
# make install
# vi /etc/inetd.conf
# killall -HUP inetd

Let us know about the results. I've not yet installed RedHat 7.2, and I
don't intend to, so I've got nothing to use to test on myself.
