Hi all... XCDroast is pretty good - we had a whole group of people using
it at my previous place of work on a lowly P90 that was set up as a SMB
server as well.  Everyone seemed to be able to drive the software once
we told them that was the software to use. Nobody complained, and it did
everything that everyone wanted.  One thing we did to make sure that you
couldn't kill a burn was to wrap the XCDroast in a shell script that ran
the software with higher priority.  sudo took care of assigning root
permissions and it produced only one coaster in the 6 or so months that
I was there.

Multisession is a property of the underlying cdrecord program that
XCDroast (used to, does it still?) calls.

There's lots of issues with recording multisession CDs.  IF you really
need to do it, does VMware work for burning CDs? Otherwise you'll still
need to dual boot (damn).

Cheers,
Adam
