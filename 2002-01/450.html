Obviously, "Aristotle" has not taken his stolen name seriously.
Neither logic nor evidence are evident, and the "straw man" is 
everywhere.

Not true.  Some evidence would be nice.

&gt; the average
&gt; person in the street is horrorfied at the complexit of Linux

Forgiving the spelling errors, what evidence is there for this 
statement?

&gt; often find the *nix community to be laden with intellectually
&gt; arrogant people who like to see anyone who does not use a real OS as
&gt; somehow inferior - or see any 'dumbing down' of *nix as only for dumb
&gt; people

Define "laden"

&gt; Take for example this passionate opposition to HTML email owing to
&gt; the stubborn determination of many community members to use the most
&gt; complicated text editor imaginable (vi or Emacs) for email and look
&gt; down on people who don't with disdain - even though Vi is a remnant
&gt; of the days before computer screens when a printer was the only form
&gt; of output.

The straw man.  
It is not true that there is a "stubborn determination of many 
community members to use the most complicated text editor imaginable 
(vi or Emacs) for email".  Un*x people use Pine, Elm, Kmail, Mutt, you 
name it.  Almost none would use vi or emacs.
Nor is it true that the objection to HTML is based on editor 
capability.  The objection is based on (1) the fact that HTML 
significantly increases bandwidth without adding anything to message 
legibility and (2) the fact that HTML messages can (and do) force the 
receiver to download images and other trivia which can cause 
inconvenience to the receiver. 
Plain text requires minimal bandwidth and is readable by every mail 
reader.  Its use is encouraged for reasons of practicability and 
courtesy, not elitism.

&gt; Don't get me wrong - the groups are incredibly helpful but I think
&gt; Linux still tends to only attract people with either a lot of
&gt; experience or education in *nix or with a lot of interest and
&gt; determination.

Some evidence would be nice.

Please note this more balanced posting:

&gt; &gt; Unless your experiences have been different to mine, I've generally
&gt; &gt; found the LinuxSA and most other Linux groups are very helpful.
&gt; &gt; You occasionally get people who like to tear down others, but
&gt; &gt; fortunately these are fairly uncommon.

&gt; &gt; Linux for desktop use (general computing for the masses) is only
&gt; &gt; 3-4 years old. Microsoft and Apple have had 10 years or more to
&gt; &gt; work on their desktop usability. Since the desktop market is
&gt; &gt; continually evolving, competitors have to watch out for new
&gt; &gt; applications opening, and capture new territory.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Today's savvy home users are editing DV video, creating
&gt; &gt; high-quality digital photo albums, playing high end 3D games, and
&gt; &gt; creating DVD-R movies of their kid's birthdays. 

Doesn't this last paragraph give the lie to your idea that users are 
not in a position to use "complex" software?
