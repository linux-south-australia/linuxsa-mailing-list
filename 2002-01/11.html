The Mutoh understands HPGL & HPGL2 protocol. The programs that you wish to 
use with the Plotter need this feature. Most Cad programs have drivers like 
the HP 7585 that will do this. Varicad does (A linux engineering CAD 
package). I have had a look at Cycas2 (linux architectural CAD package) but 
the free version has limited printing (A4 I think). There are other CAD 
packages under developement but the major vendors continue to avoiding Linux 
for some reason.

You could use Mandrake or Debian as a print server or a Samba server. This 
will enable you to print from Windows to you Linux box and on to the plotter. 
I hope this does not confuse you too much. 

There are some tablets supported under Linux  -Wacoms are.

If you get sick of the Mutoh, mine died a while back.

&gt; Hi all, I am new to the list so I will introduce myself.

&gt; Sex  definitely male (I think)
&gt; Linux use... around 2 months, so am a rank beginner.
&gt; Enjoy playing around with "The Gimp"
&gt; Am on the bottom of the learning curve, have maybe 25 years left to learn
&gt; it.
&gt;
&gt; I have a question for the list.
&gt; In my possesion I have a Murto iP500 pen plotter that I can't get to work
&gt; under Windows, will only use the driver from an updated win98, not the full
&gt; installation. Uses HP driver 7585a or b. It will print both internal and
&gt; info from computer tests so plotter appears to be working OK.
&gt; Is it at all possible to run it on Linux, there don't appear to be any
&gt; drivers written for Linux on their sites? I have Mandrake 8 installed
&gt; and am thinking of installing Debian 2.2r2 if that will run the plotter.
&gt; Also have a drawing tablet that I haven't played with as yet (Kurta XLC)
&gt; nearly a metre square, and expect the same probs with it.
&gt; Otherwise is there anyone who is in need of a boat anchor? It would be a
&gt; shame as they are both good machines.
&gt; Thanks a lot for any help.
