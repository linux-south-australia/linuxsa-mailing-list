Hi

There is a great commercial product out called Teamware Office for Linux.
There are a few Engineering compaines and Lawyers that are using it and from
what they say, are really happy with it.

I borrowed a copy to learn how to administer it, an it took me a whole 15
minutes to get it up and running. There was one small section of the
software that I had problems with, but the available free technical help on
the web help me out.

It's pretty cheap to buy, from what I can remember it's about $900 for 20 or
25 user license, I cannot remember which. It gives you all of the features
you would expect in a groupware package.

Have a look at www.teamware.com and go through the links to the linux
section. There is a trail download too.

Oh yeah, a company in Pirie is one of the three Australia resellers, I thin
the company's name is TELL Office. They have a guy there that sets up Linux
box's with Teamware. He even travels to Adelaide to set them up, or so I
have heard.


regards

Wayne

Subject: Looking for shared calendars


&gt; Hi guy's,
&gt;
&gt; anyone ever heard, seen or know about a network with a Linux server and
win 95
&gt; clients running shared address books and calendars. Basicly similar to MS
&gt; Exchange server allowing shared mailboxes, calendars, ect.
&gt;
&gt; Any clues or links or ideas are greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Torsten.
