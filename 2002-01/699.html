hell, i don't even care about a fixed IP... dynamic DNS is fine for me.
I don't use tech support; if i can't fix a problem, i doubt they'd be able
to.

All i want is low-latency (for ssh, gaming, internet radio) and either very
cheap per Mb rates, or else a reasonable download limit.. I find 3gb
restrictive since i live with 2 other people, but if i was the only user,
then 3 to 5 gb would satisfy my needs. I would prefer more, but wouldn't we
all? ;)

So, if anyone out there is interested, if someone was to offer a cable or
adsl plan that was along the line of $60 or so per month, for 3 to 5 Gb of
downloads, I'd swap over to it as soon as i could get out of my telstra
contract. Which apparently isn't very hard to do, given the constant AUP
and contract changes!

Also, I'd be happy to accept off-peak weighted downloads..

So, in a way, I guess i'm saying that the netspace and xis offerings are
good, but I'd like something thats about half the price, and offers half the
transfer quantities. I'm also willing to accept a dynamic IP, and
pay-per-incident for tech support. (For non-isp related problems.. ie. i
don't want ot have to pay $5/min just to tell them their router at
xx.xx.xx.xx is dropping packets or misconfigured or whatever..)

&gt; &gt; &gt; The distinction between 'business' and 'residential' is actually at
&gt; &gt; &gt; once both harder and easier than the one you're making.  The
&gt; &gt; &gt; distinction isn't arbitrary at all. Its very closely related to
&gt; &gt; &gt; creating appealing residential plans that also don't bankrupt the
&gt; &gt; &gt; providers of same. It has almost nothing, directly, to do with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cost of fixed IP addresses. Its more the reverse - its what a fixed
&gt; &gt; &gt; IP address tends to say about the usage intentions of the customer
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the resulting running costs for the customers' service.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Eh?  I don't get it. Providers seem to make a difference
&gt; &gt; between Business
&gt; &gt; and Non-Business since I was in the ISP game.  But ultimately
&gt; &gt; it's really
&gt; &gt; about being able to differential prices based on who can/will
&gt; &gt; pay more as
&gt; &gt; opposed to intentions (I've thought about this lots because I
&gt; &gt; used to have
&gt; &gt; to explain it to customers who didn't get it because it was
&gt; &gt; arbitrary).
&gt;
&gt; Yes -- and on the whole, people who want permanent IP's can/will pay
&gt; more for them... Often because of their intentions...
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I run webservers which send out almost as much traffic as I
&gt; &gt; receive.  I run
&gt; &gt; a mail server for myself.  Does this really cost a different
&gt; &gt; amount to
&gt; &gt; service to someone who doesn't and who merely websurfs?  Not
&gt; &gt; really.  It's
&gt; &gt; IP packets.  You can't sell IP packets at a loss to
&gt; &gt; residential or business.
&gt;
&gt; Probably not, but then you, like many others on this list, are probably
&gt; not the average customer... Maybe there should be a third class of
&gt; accounts, so you have Residential (Ma & Pa), Business (lots of service),
&gt; and Geek (pure IP).
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if that would be a good idea... The Residential account is
&gt; cheap, is aimed at people who surf and read email and don't think and
&gt; run windows and use dynamic IP's and don't know the difference anyway.
&gt; The Business account is for people who run businesses, need static IP,
&gt; want lots of handholding service and configuration, and are willing to
&gt; pay for it, and the Geek account is for people who want a static IP,
&gt; with Mb and no services, are willing to pay per incident for helpdesk if
&gt; they ever need it, in exchange for having a fairly cheap static IP
&gt; account.
&gt;
&gt; Hmm...
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I should do some work now...
