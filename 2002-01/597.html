Sounds like he should use the auto-save function and learn how to setup
automatic backups with the windows system utilities. Changing to another
OS will only slow down his creative muse with irrelevant computer probs.


Alex

P.S. By the way... You also have the name of a famous writer. 
I have lots of your books. :)

&gt; Thanx for the reply Adam

&gt; The question came about after I spent some time &gt;3hours recovering lost word files, from office 2000. He is absolutely sure he saved at least several times
&gt; but when he froze and had to reboot they had vanished from the HDD. (They were still there as temp files)
&gt; 
&gt; He was complaining bitterly that word has been steadily becomming less reliable for big docs (i think this was discussed some time back on tis list)
&gt; He predominantly writes lots of text with few diagrams and no special formating.  He is not computer literate, it is a tool no more no less.
&gt; 
&gt; I can't trust Koffice or Abiword and I don't think he could or would like to manage Latex.
&gt; StarOffice might be a good chioce but I don't know enough about it to be sure.  If it does not lose its documents then it migt suffice.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanx again
