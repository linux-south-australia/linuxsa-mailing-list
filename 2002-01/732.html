Why not have a smorgasbord approach:

a) Choose:
	Link Speed (a) 256kbps/64kbps (b) 512/128 c) 1.5Mbps/256kbps 
		   (d) 512/512kbps e) String

b) Choose:
	IP Type:
		   (a) Dynamic Single IP
		   (b) Static Single IP
		   (c) Multiple Static IP
		   (d) Bring Your Own IP Range
		   (e) DecNet

c) Choose:
	Bandwidth Package:
		   (a) No included MB + $x per GB
		   .. etc
		   (e) Jatz Biscuits with Cheese

d) Choose:
	SLA 
		   (a) Best Effort 
		   (b) Better Effort
		   (c) etc
		   (d) Please have someone on site to hold my hand 
    		       constantly - I drool

The problem gets back to my original point trying to create differential 
pricing for different perceived classes of clients based more on what the 
client might pay as opposed to what the service costs to deliver.

I believe it's better to have a consistent package for the commodity part of 
the service no matter who you are and then to charge separately for 
support/SLAs.  If my link goes down I don't lose business (I may lose sleep 
as I fear not being IP connected, but really that's my issue and I've got to 
get some help :-)

Otherwise you see a problem which I pointed out in my original post which is 
that it maybe cheaper to have a second line purely for websurfing as opposed 
to webserving due to this artifical class difference.  Which defeats the 
whole class differentiation anyway as someone who has enough money can have 
it all anyway.

&gt; That 'middle' concept is, not surprisingly, the hardest thing to 
&gt; figure out. It won't be in the initial pricing release. But it will 
&gt; likely be in a subsequent one, if I can figure out what the heck it 
&gt; really means :)

&gt; &gt;Hi Richard,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Maybe there should be a third class of accounts, so you have
&gt; &gt;Residential (Ma & Pa), Business (lots of service),and Geek (pure IP).
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I, and probably many on this list, would gladly pay for a Geek account.
&gt; &gt;Maybe Simon can add that into his equations as an option. At least he
&gt; &gt;would be pretty sure it would have solid traffic but little help desk
&gt; &gt;time. Probably be a good class of customer to have on the books.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Wait and see &lt;G&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Cheers,  Ian
