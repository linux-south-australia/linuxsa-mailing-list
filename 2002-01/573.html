Hi,

This is not Linux specific, but since Linux is a popular platform on which 
Perl is used, this may be of interest to some of you:

Contributions are being sought to "buy" the dedicated resources of a "Perl 
Professional", namely (Dr ?) Damian Conway, for one year to work on Perl 
related projects and education.

Damian Conway is an academic from Monash University, and is also well known 
as the author of "Object Oriented Perl", and general all round Perl Guru !

This project has already run successfully for one year, and now funds are 
being raised to for second year of indentured servitude from Mr Conway !

If you use and value Perl in your workplace or other areas, and especially if 
you gain monetary return from it, you may want to think about conributing if 
possible. Even small amounts can help.

More information is available from:

<A HREF="http://perl-foundation.org/">http://perl-foundation.org/</A>

Current fund status (around 35% at time of writing)

https://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node_id=305

Disclaimer: I use Perl, that is all. A lot of people I have spoken to are not 
aware of this initiative, so this is just a bit of directed publicity - feel 
free to flame me directly if you believe it is a completely unwarranted 
intrusion onto the list.

Ontopic: I personally think this sort of thing is good, and would like to see 
it available for a wider variety of open source projects. I admire a lot of 
the software I use on a day to day basis, and would gladly contribute to a 
fund that was used to employ a developer/maintainer for it.
