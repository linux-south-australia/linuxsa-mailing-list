&gt; Hi Matthew, et al,
&gt;
&gt; I have a few comments on your mail :)
&gt;

&gt; &gt;- I use more than 500MB per month (usually an extra 250MB or so), which
&gt; &gt;   costs me around $50 per month on top of the $100 per month for the
base
&gt; &gt;   service.
&gt;
&gt; One thing you might like to know - we've just reduced the cost of
&gt; those extra MB's (from $0.18 to $0.15 per Mb), effective as of your
&gt; next bill (including the current months' usage, in other words).
&gt;
&gt; So, a 16% discount while we all work towards better things...(you
&gt; heard it here, first :) ).
&gt;
&gt; If the price list shows the old price on the web, hit shift-reload :)
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Obviously the last option has some setup costs (at least $386 including
&gt; &gt;installing a second phone line) but given thats only 2 or 3GB worth of
&gt; &gt;traffic on the other options then it's paid off in 3 months anyway, so
&gt; &gt;that's moot.
&gt;
&gt; Plus another ADSL 'modem'. Plus the risk that the second phone line
&gt; won't support ADSL because it'll get pairgained because your street
&gt; is already out of copper. Plus the fact that its just silly (which is
&gt; the point you're making, I understand that).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;I guess what I'm trying to point out here is that this arbitrary
distinction
&gt; &gt;between Business and Residential breaks down.  I realize there is a cost
&gt; &gt;associated with fixed IPs (I do however have my own portable address
space),
&gt; &gt;but it seems to be quite odd that it is cheaper to have 2 ADSL services
and
&gt; &gt;2 phones lines to get 3.5GB of traffic than it is to get extra traffic on
a
&gt; &gt;single connection.
&gt;
&gt; The distinction between 'business' and 'residential' is actually at
&gt; once both harder and easier than the one you're making.  The
&gt; distinction isn't arbitrary at all. Its very closely related to
&gt; creating appealing residential plans that also don't bankrupt the
&gt; providers of same. It has almost nothing, directly, to do with the
&gt; cost of fixed IP addresses. Its more the reverse - its what a fixed
&gt; IP address tends to say about the usage intentions of the customer
&gt; and the resulting running costs for the customers' service.
&gt;
&gt; I'll explain more once our own pricing plans have 'hit the streets'.
&gt; Right now its better I spent my time finishing that than writing long
&gt; messages here :)
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon
