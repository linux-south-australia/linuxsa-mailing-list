Personally, I've always disliked the autofs /net/&lt;host&gt;/fs system. It
seems to me that it introduces one more place where you can add an
unneeded dependency (unless it's used strictly for certain purposes,
like backup, or something, and users don't start symlinking files in
there and so on)...

I prefer to have few mountpoints, explicitly mounted in auto.master &
friends (over NIS or as files) so that I can control it. This way, all
mounted FS's appear as local fs's, and there is no dependency on name
that the user sees...

I don't know if this is just gut feeling based on a bad experience or if
it's actually a sensible opinion though... (maybe there's some really
good legitimate reasons why /net/host/ is a good idea...) ...

Can anyone enlighten me?

&gt; Subject: Autofs VS am-utils for NFS mounting
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hi y'all,
&gt; 
&gt; We're using autofs to mount remote machines via NFS 
&gt; automatically using NIS to ship the options.  The problem we 
&gt; have is that when the remote machine (NFS server) has 
&gt; multiple partions, the extra partitions cannot be 
&gt; automatically mounted on the same point.  ie if server nfs01 
&gt; has exports/partition / and /boot, we can't see any files in 
&gt; /net/nfs01/boot but we can see all files in /net/nfs01/etc 
&gt; (where /etc is on the same partition as /)
&gt; 
&gt; This is as expected .... to quote the man page autofs(5):
&gt; --
&gt; UNSUPPORTED
&gt;        The  automounter  does  not  support  direct maps or mount
&gt;        trees (more than one filesystem to be mounted under a spe-
&gt;        cific automount point), and handles SunOS-style replicated
&gt;        filesystems only to the extent that mount(8) does.
&gt; --
&gt; 
&gt; So one option is to export the root file system with the 
&gt; "nohide" option so that all partitions are exported and the 
&gt; additional paritions do not need to be mounted explicitly on 
&gt; the client.  This would work with autofs but the nohide 
&gt; option doesn't seem to work as expected (the man page doesn't 
&gt; give a very reassuring assessment of the nohide option).  I'm 
&gt; using the standard kernel based NFS server that comes with 
&gt; RedHat7.2 (I have seen the nohide option work with the an old 
&gt; Slackware userspace NFS server).
&gt; 
&gt; So the only option seems to be running the am-utils if we 
&gt; want to be able to see all partitions.  
&gt; 
&gt; Is this the same conclusion other people have some to or am I 
&gt; missing something?  Both machines (server and client) are RH7.2.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Michael
