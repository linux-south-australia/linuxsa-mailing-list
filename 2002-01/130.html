A firewall is only really usefull if you have services that you want
some people to be able to use and not others.

If a port isnt listening then it isnt listening. If a connection attempt
comes in to that port that is not open then is going to get rejected and
thus you arnt hacked (presuming there is no bugs in your tcp stack). If
it is listening but isnt required then it should be turned off. 

You only really need firewall rules on boxes doing routing between
boundrys between areas where your level of trust changes (usually the
edge of your network). Or where you need to run a service that you dont
want certain people to be able to access.

I'd be more worried about making sure you stay up to date with patches
than I would about overly complex firewall rules on internal hosts.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Can anyone help me with this security question?
&gt; 
&gt; I have a machine, 'db', that is behind a router/switch with fairly tight
&gt; firewalling rules.
&gt; The database is a redhat 7.2 box, iptables 1.2.4.
&gt; The only thing this box does is serve db content to a web server.
&gt; So port 4567 can be accessed only from ip 1.2.3.4 and ssh from ip 2.3.4.5
&gt; 
&gt; Is adding a stack of iptable rules to this box overkill?
&gt; Or should that question be is iptables the right app for a machine level
&gt; firewall that isn't routing?
&gt; 
&gt; any advice would be of great assistance.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Marcos.
