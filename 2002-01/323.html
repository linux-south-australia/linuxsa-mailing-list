Should also add that you need broadbased software for any platform for it to
succeed.
Just because the Mac supports Office Products won't make it attractive.

Lot's of people who have PCs at home use them as multi-purpose machines for
some work and some play. Unfortunately most games these days come out on
Windoze and PS2 and Xbox. There aren't many that come out on Mac O/S and the
ones that do often lag behind in release dates.

Little Johnny says to Dad.. " We need a Pentium IV so that I can play the
latest FPS that all the kids at school are playing".

It's not only games, a LOT of business Apps require M$ to run also. We've
had companies come and try and sell us solutions and Apps and you ask them
if they will work on a server running Apache. Depressingly often the answer
is NO...aren't you running IIS - Why not ( they might work on different web
servers but the Account Managers have No Idea )

&gt; &gt; The problem I have, which I've enumerated before on LinuxSA,
&gt; &gt; is the closed
&gt; &gt; source nature of the UI.  It's not the "free beer" issue -
&gt; &gt; I'll happily pay for
&gt; &gt; my software, but it's the "free speech" bit.  With OS-X I'm
&gt; &gt; locked into
&gt; &gt; (overpriced) (Apple) PPC hardware.  I have no avenue for
&gt; &gt; finding or fixing
&gt; &gt; bugs, or making any improvements or incorporating the
&gt; &gt; improvements made by
&gt; &gt; others.  This is my issue.  And what I've said above is from
&gt; &gt; my perspective, I
&gt; &gt; understand the course Apple has taken to make a buck[1] (i.e.
&gt; &gt; they can't go
&gt; &gt; Intel, and they can't open-source, or else they'll lose money
&gt; &gt; through piracy -
&gt; &gt; cf the killing of the Mac-clones).
