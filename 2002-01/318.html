Quoting Simon Hackett &lt;<A HREF="mailto:simon@internode.com.au">simon@internode.com.au</A>&gt;:
&gt; But I'm happy having what, for me, is absolutely the best of all 
&gt; possible worlds, and zero compromises in the process - real open 
&gt; source unix, a full open source software development platform, that 
&gt; compiles and runs everything linux does, but which also has a great, 
&gt; commercial strength (and commercially supported) GUI and execution 
&gt; environment for commercial applications built on top of it.

I really like OS-X.  At least the small amount of what I've seen of it.  It 
does definately give you the best of both worlds - M$ Office operability with 
unix stability and toolset underneath.

The problem I have, which I've enumerated before on LinuxSA, is the closed 
source nature of the UI.  It's not the "free beer" issue - I'll happily pay for 
my software, but it's the "free speech" bit.  With OS-X I'm locked into 
(overpriced) (Apple) PPC hardware.  I have no avenue for finding or fixing 
bugs, or making any improvements or incorporating the improvements made by 
others.  This is my issue.  And what I've said above is from my perspective, I 
understand the course Apple has taken to make a buck[1] (i.e. they can't go 
Intel, and they can't open-source, or else they'll lose money through piracy - 
cf the killing of the Mac-clones).

But for me, that's enough compromise to say, "OS-X, just say No!".

OS-X, technically, is wonderful.  It could supplant Windows on the desktop as 
long as Apple management doesn't kill it first.  But then we'll still have no 
access to the source - Apple will become lazy (like M$) and ignore their 
customers, and we'll be back to where we are today, with a dominant, buggy, 
security-lax operating system, just with a different owner.

For me that's too much compromise.  (IMHO) open-source (for the whole OS) is 
the way (for me at least) to go.

Share and Enjoy!
