How familiar is this??? :)

(joke ahead)

&gt; THE TOUGHEST DECISION: SHOULD MY LOVED ONE BE PLACED IN AN 
&gt; ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY?
&gt; 
&gt; For family members, it is often the most difficult and 
&gt; painful decision they will face: to accept that a loved one - 
&gt; a parent, a spouse, perhaps a sibling - is technologically 
&gt; impaired and should no longer be allowed to live 
&gt; independently, or come near a computer or electronic device 
&gt; without direct supervision. The time has come to place that 
&gt; loved one into the care of an Assisted Computing Facility.  
&gt; But you have questions. So many questions.
&gt; 
&gt; We at Silicon Pines want to help.
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT EXACTLY IS AN "ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY"?
&gt; 
&gt; Sometimes referred to as "Homes for the Technologically 
&gt; Infirm", "Technical Invalid Care Centers," or "Homes for the 
&gt; Technically Challenged," Assisted Computing Facilities (ACFs) 
&gt; are modeled on assisted living facilities, and provide a 
&gt; safe, structured residential environment for those unable to 
&gt; handle even the most common, everyday multi-tasks. Most fully 
&gt; accredited ACFs, like Silicon Pines, are an oasis of hope and 
&gt; encouragement that allow residents to lead productive, 
&gt; technologically relevant lives without the fear and anxiety 
&gt; associated with actually having to understand or execute the 
&gt; technologies themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; WHO SHOULD BE IN AN ACF?
&gt; 
&gt; Sadly, technology is advancing at such a dramatic rate that 
&gt; many millions, of all ages, will never truly be able to 
&gt; understand it, putting an undue burden on those friends and 
&gt; family members who must explain it to them. But unless the 
&gt; loved one is suffering from a truly debilitating affliction, 
&gt; such as Reinstallzheimers, the decision to commit is entirely 
&gt; personal. You must ask yourself:
&gt; 
&gt; "How frustrated am I that my parent/sibling/spouse is unable 
&gt; to open an email attachment?"
&gt; 
&gt; "How much of my time should be taken up explaining how RAM is 
&gt; different from hard drive memory?"
&gt; 
&gt; "How many times can I bear to hear my dad say, 'Hey, can I 
&gt; replace the motherboard with a fatherboard? Ha ha ha!'"
&gt; 
&gt; To make things easier, we have prepared a list of Warning 
&gt; Signs which we encourage you to return to often, or, if you 
&gt; can't figure out how to bookmark it, print out. Also, please 
&gt; take a moment to read "I'm Glad I'm in Here! - A Resident's Story."
&gt; 
&gt; MUST IT BE FAMILY, OR CAN I PLACE ANYONE IN AN ACF?
&gt; 
&gt; Several corporations have sought permission to have certain 
&gt; employees, or at times entire sales departments, committed to 
&gt; ACFs. At present, however, individuals can be committed only 
&gt; by direct family or self-internment. The reason is simple: 
&gt; there are not nearly enough ACFs in the world to accommodate 
&gt; all the technologically challenged.  For example, there are 
&gt; currently only 860,000 beds available in ACFs, but there are 
&gt; 29 million AOL users.
&gt; 
&gt; HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?
&gt; 
&gt; ACF rents range from free up to $12,500 per month. The 
&gt; disparity is currently a point of contention in the ACF 
&gt; industry. Many residents are covered through government 
&gt; programs such as Compucaid or Compucare, but reimbursement 
&gt; rates are low and only cover a portion of the fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Exacerbating the situation are the HMOs (HelpDesk Maintenance 
&gt; Organizations), which often deny coverage, forcing residents 
&gt; to pay out of pocket or turn to expensive private techcare 
&gt; insurers such as BlueCache/BlueScreen.
&gt; 
&gt; Offsetting the costs are technology companies themselves, 
&gt; many of which subsidize ACFs. Firms such as Microsoft, Dell, 
&gt; Qualcomm, and America Online will pay up to 100 percent of a 
&gt; resident's monthly bill, but there is a catch. ISPs, for 
&gt; instance, require residents to sign service contracts lasting 
&gt; a year or more. Microsoft, meanwhile, prohibits the 
&gt; installation of any competitive software, while Priceline 
&gt; requires that residents buy shares of its stock, which seems 
&gt; onerous but saves residents on lavatory tissue.
&gt; 
&gt; HOW OLD MUST I BE TO HAVE SOMEONE COMMITTED?
&gt; 
&gt; Until very recently, you had to be 18 or older to legally 
&gt; commit a family member. However, the now famous British court 
&gt; case Frazier vs. Frazier and Frazier has cleared the way for 
&gt; minors to commit their parents. In that case, 15-year-old 
&gt; Bradley Frazier of Leicester had his 37-year-old parents 
&gt; committed to an ACF in Bournemouth after a judge ruled Ian 
&gt; and Janet Frazier were a "danger to themselves and the 
&gt; community." According to court records, Bradley told his 
&gt; parents about the I Love You virus and warned them not to 
&gt; click attachments, then the next day his parents received an 
&gt; I Love You email and clicked on the attachment because, they 
&gt; explained, "it came from someone we know."
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR IN AN ACF?
&gt; 
&gt; First, make sure it's a genuine Assisted Computing Facility, 
&gt; and not an Assisted Living Facility. To tell the difference, 
&gt; observe the residents. If they look rather old and tend to 
&gt; openly discuss bowel movements, this is probably 'assisted 
&gt; living.' On the other hand, if they vary in age and say 
&gt; things like, "I'm supposed to figure that out? I'm not Bill 
&gt; Gates you know!," this is probably 'assisted computing.'
&gt; 
&gt; Also, at a well-run ACF, residents should lead full, 
&gt; independent lives, and should be allowed the use of many 
&gt; technology devices, including telephones, electric 
&gt; toothbrushes, and alarm clocks. However, only a facility's 
&gt; Licensed Techcare Professionals (LTPs) should perform 
&gt; computational or technological tasks such as installing 
&gt; programs or saving email attachments. And LTPs should NEVER 
&gt; answer residents' questions because studies have shown that 
&gt; answering user questions inevitably makes things worse. 
&gt; Instead, residents should simply have things done for them, 
&gt; relieving them of the pressure to "learn" or "improve."
&gt; 
&gt; CAN A RESIDENT EVER GET OUT?
&gt; 
&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, THIS SOUNDS PROMISING. HOW CAN I LEARN MORE?
&gt; 
&gt; For your enlightenment, we offer extensive information on 
&gt; Silicon Pines and the ACF lifestyle, which can be found by 
&gt; clicking one of the links in the navigation bars found at 
&gt; both the top and bottom of this page. But whatever you 
&gt; decide, keep in mind that due to demand, ACFs now have long 
&gt; waiting lists. WebTV & AOL users alone will take years to absorb.
&gt; 
&gt; We look forward to your response. Thank you.
