Hi there all,
I have just spent the last two days trying to work out HOW-TO do a very
'basic' function under linux red hat 6.2.
All of this is for my own education and is not going to be used for a
customer or pat for.

At the present I have a cable modem (bigpond) which gives me a dhcp ip
one one network card, a second card is used for local area, now this
works very well ( e-smith server v5). This worked almost straight out of
the box. All the normal trimings atalk for the macs, smb for the windows
box(s) with common shares, this is not the best way of learning linux
but I need a very quick server/gateway.


Well on to the techo stuff.

cable modem 144.136.xxx.xxx (dhcp)
first card
masq
second card  (produces a dhcp server) 192.168.16.x
server ip is 192.168.16.1

all machine hang of this end.

Now for the 'new' machine

first card is 192.168.16.2
ipforwarding/masq or what ever
second card is a wireless card with ip of 192.168.0.4 (for testing
using a normal card)

this machine is going to be sort of low spec as only some traffic will
be on it,.
pentium 100 , 40 meg mem, 1 gig hd , two network cards. (I really dont
want to by a new machine)

on this machine I basically need to use it as a bridge connecting to lan
together and my machine supplying a smb ,www, ftp, blar blar.

when I first tryied getting this working the second machine could ping
internet and local networks (well cool) and I could also ping the laptop
acting as the other network, the problem was the ipforwarding (masq)
what ever you call it. Multihoning is the best word.
The problem got worse as I started reading the how-to's and books ok
this is good but it gets confusing.
So off with rh6.2 and on with e-smith ok it works only one way remote
lan with www access.
Well so what you say... I would rather learn how-to do this correctly as
e-smith takes all the fun out of it, and modifying the scripts can be a
pain when things dont work correctly.

All the 'bridge' needs to do is allow a two way transparent masq with no
restrictions.
I am now totally confused and I hate asking for help but, HELP...

If any body can point me in the right direction of the ways I sould do
this and not hack around please email me with ideas and or scripts .
Please don't say read the how-to's because I am sick of reading.


Sorry for anybody that has read this, but after 3 and a half days of
trying to get it to work and countless installs and reinstalls and
reading I have no answers on how to get it working but only about 10
dozen different ways of it not to work.


Cheers Paul Mullins
