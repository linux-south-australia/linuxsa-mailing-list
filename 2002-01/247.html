Close..
the ext2/3 system is a tree structure, and the superblock is the block at
the beginning.. Contains info like the volume name, last mounted position,
uuid, magic number, filesystem flags, state, inode, block, etc. counts,
block, fragment, group, etc. sizes, last mount/written times, number of
times mounted since last check, check intervals in times and mounts, and so
on and so forth.


It's not like the FAT table though -- the FAT table contained chains of
allocated clusters, all in one big table.
The ext2/3 filesystem will store that sort of info in the directory entry
inodes instead.

Features like that, and distributed replicated superblocks, and later on,
journalling, are some of the reasons why ext2 and now ext3 has been much
more resilient to harddisk corruption and crashes.

FAT16 and FAT32 were an "all your eggs in one basket" kind of deal.
There was a second backup FAT table, but it was placed immediately after the
first version, so anything that corrupted the first table was likely to
damage the second as well. Also, there was absolutely no checksumming done,
so even if you could read both copies of the FAT, you didn't know which one
was right, and which one was wrong!

&gt; I may be wrong in the technicalitys but I belive it is the filesystem
&gt; info. Eg file names, filename to inode lookups and inode locations on
&gt; disk. Like your FAT table (File Allocation Table table?) in a FAT file
&gt; system. The good thing about multiple copys all over your disk are, say
&gt; the first half of your partition gets blown away. You can use an
&gt; alternate superblock to recover the last half of your files, or vice
&gt; versa etc. How many you have and exactly whats in them depends on your
&gt; filesystem.

&gt; &gt; I am wanting to find out the significance of the Super Block, whether FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris...
&gt; &gt; whatever.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; *  The Super Block contains critical data for the device's filesystem [but what ??].
&gt; &gt; *  It is located on sectors 16 through 31 at the beggining of the device.
&gt; &gt; *  FreeBSD keeps an alternate SuperBlock at the begging of every cylinder group.
&gt; &gt; *  The first alternate Super block on FBSD is at block 32.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is all the info I could scrounge up.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What does the SuperBlock actually do ?
&gt; &gt; Why is the SuperBlock so critical ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Can anyone give me a *good* summary on the purpose of the Super Block ?
&gt; &gt; And/Or any recommendations ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Thanks
&gt; &gt;
