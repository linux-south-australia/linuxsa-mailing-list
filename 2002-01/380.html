&gt; &gt; Just browsing the newsagents and happened to be flicking through the
&gt; &gt; latest issue of PC Authority. About page 20 something is an article
&gt; &gt; discussing the likelihood of Linux ever coming up with a decent
&gt; &gt; desktop. His suggestion is that people working on KDE and GNOME are
&gt; &gt; wasting their time and should be better off working to make Linux a
&gt; &gt; better server application. It will never be  able to come up with a
&gt; &gt; decent desktop.
&gt; 
&gt; I've not had a chance to get out to a news agency to purchase a copy.
&gt; Tell me, who is the author of this column? I've noticed that a certain
&gt; columnist (who is fairly pro-Microsoft) has written a few caustic
&gt; remarks about Linux, not all of them true, though.

I wouldn't be fussed.

Magazines articles are deisnged to be read and to sell the mag.
The occassional outrageous statement does that.

The "Linux must do ... to succeed" article is a becoming an old
stand-by.

They'll all a bit of a farce, and few of them understand how Linux
development differs from the development of Solaris or Windows.
You'd think that the developers of GNONE and KDE would be interested
in graphics and user interface design and stuff like that I
don't understand.  You wouldn't expect a huge interest in
server issues like network protocols, data structures and caching,
disk access paths and the like.

You also expect the business plans of companies associated
with the development of GNOME or KDE to differ from those
associated with the development of Apache.

So which developers are going to stop developing GNOME/KDE and
change to developing server applications.  Even 10% seems high.
What company board is going to approve that change in
strategic direction from user interfaces to back-end servers?

In short, the author needs a clue.  Until they get one, don't
be fussed by them.

PS: I never could understand the "Linux must have a journalling
     file system to succeed in the enterprise" articles.  I always
     though that Oracle and DB2 did disk access to raw partitions.
