David,

I'm currently using Kmail and MS Outlook (for more important stuff).

Is there a way of actually seeing incoming mail as they arrive one by one?
Over a normal modem, it would be nice to actually start reading the first of
300 incoming emails as they arrive.

Cheers,

Joseph Tan

got some but not the ones you describe

&gt; 1. Source Filtering not working. This is a real biggie for me. I've
checked,
&gt; recheck, and looked at the filter.xml file to find out why source
filtering
&gt; in particular does not work. AFAIK, everything looks OK - the selection
&gt; criterias, the filter order. it's just broken on my machine.

"works for me"

&gt; 2. Home and End keys not working in the GTKHTML composer window.
&gt;
&gt; 3. Spell checking not highlighted + not working, this is after I've made
sure
&gt; that ASpell, ISpell, and GNOME Spell have been set up.

never tried those two

&gt; Perhaps it's just me, but how are many of you going with Evolution?

for now I am.  It's waaay better than netscape/mozilla, not as solid as mutt
(but not much is!) but has the advantage that things like my emailed dilbert
comics are shown inline as an image rather than mutt shows them as
attachments
(pretty minor).

Dave.
