Obvious Solution if you are prepared to pay for it is - FrameMaker.
Many researchers use this software.

I have only seen it run on Solaris, not sure about Linux etc.

If he is working for a Uni, I'm sure he can get them to pay for the licenses
etc.

Subject: Re: book writing under Linux


&gt; Thanx for the reply Adam
&gt;
&gt; The question came about after I spent some time &gt;3hours recovering lost
word files, from office 2000. He is absolutely sure he saved at least
several times
&gt; but when he froze and had to reboot they had vanished from the HDD. (They
were still there as temp files)
&gt;
&gt; He was complaining bitterly that word has been steadily becomming less
reliable for big docs (i think this was discussed some time back on tis
list)
&gt; He predominantly writes lots of text with few diagrams and no special
formating.  He is not computer literate, it is a tool no more no less.
&gt;
&gt; I can't trust Koffice or Abiword and I don't think he could or would like
to manage Latex.
&gt; StarOffice might be a good chioce but I don't know enough about it to be
sure.  If it does not lose its documents then it migt suffice.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Thanx again
&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; My usual thoughts were Lyx & Klyx although I'm not sure if they are
robust enough to manage 1000+ pages.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I have found that LaTeX is pretty robust no matter how many pages.  Most
&gt; &gt;We have quite a few people using it at Uni to write their final thesis
&gt; &gt;dissertation (which gets large, and cumbersome, and full of images).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Lyx (and Klyx) are really just front-ends to LaTeX anyway - they use
&gt; &gt;their own file format, but they convert to a tex file for processing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Is your friend highly computer savvy or is your friend one of the "point
&gt; &gt;and click, oh shit, it's done something different to normal I'd better
&gt; &gt;call an expert" kind of person?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If your friend falls closer to the latter category, I'd recommend
&gt; &gt;steering clear of Lyx and/or LaTeX.  Staroffice or Word perfect (or
&gt; &gt;Abiword or KOffice) may be better alternatives.  They provide a much
&gt; &gt;more "user-friendly" interface to the uninitiated user.  Staroffice is
&gt; &gt;pretty stable with large documents if you break the document into
&gt; &gt;chapters and store each in a separate file.  That's not too hard to do
&gt; &gt;once you get used to it either.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If your friend is closer to the former category then I'd recommend going
&gt; &gt;straight to LaTeX source. It's not hard to learn if you have a real task
&gt; &gt;for it.  It's available on Unix and Windows (and just about everything
&gt; &gt;in between), and there's squidloads of information available to help you
&gt; &gt;out. I say your friend needs to be more experienced, as TeX (of any
&gt; &gt;variety) outputs its build errors in text form and sometimes they're
&gt; &gt;worse than the output of a compiler when you need to track down a source
&gt; &gt;error.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;If your friend falls in the middle, he can try LyX of Klyx. I tried LyX
&gt; &gt;once and it looked OK, but it wasn't exactly fast (execution speed), and
&gt; &gt;it didn't seem overly stable - I crashed it by trying to display a
&gt; &gt;simple one page file as DVI. I can't speak for Klyx. The interface is a
&gt; &gt;little clunky compared to the more polished word processors too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;You don't say exactly what your friend is trying to do though - does he
&gt; &gt;have large text documents, or does he use lots of graphics and tricky
&gt; &gt;formatting everywhere?  These things also help to decide what software
&gt; &gt;to select.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hope this has been of some help.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Cheers,
&gt; &gt;Adam
