&gt; yup very painful burning mac versions of cd.

Eh? Mac's tend to be able to read, well, anything.

&gt; you need to enable 'apple extensions' if you are burning from pc

... but Mac's can read standard ISO9660 CDs, with all the extended snafu
that's commonly used in the PC world. Why would you want to burn a CD
specifically for the Mac, on a PC?

&gt; i had a _great_ deal of trouble with this, mkisofs is good - you can use
&gt; it to create one big image and burn it with a traditional program, even
&gt; under win (e.g. nero, padus etc)..

Yes, that's because mkisofs creates an ISO image. The Windows CD writing
applications, including Nero, Padus, Easy CD Creator, all have the
ability to read standard format CDs. That's why we've got standards, you
see.

&gt; elsewise you need an ntfs partition (as far as win goes) to burn a hfs
&gt; partition.

Sorry, I don't follow what you're saying.

&gt; i also had _great_ difficultly reading mac disks in linux, i didn't know
&gt; what format they were - tried mounting as HFS/HFS+ to no avail,
&gt; in the end i used a win program 'macopener' or 'macdisk' i think it
&gt; was called which read it no probs

Well, from what I can see, HFS+ support has only been around in 2.4.x,
and the patch was only released late 2001 (13 December, actually). The
reason that you've not been able to read those format CDs is because the
file system support hasn't been available.
