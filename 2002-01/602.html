&gt; &gt; If you have tried it and it's lacking something, I'm curious as to
&gt; &gt; what's missing. As I currently use it for home use (probably
&gt; &gt; overkill) but it's a way I can learn it for potential business use.
&gt;
&gt; It's horrible for use as a home user - I use it as well to keep track
&gt; of how much money I'll have at the end of each month (damn credit
&gt; cards). I find that under Mandrake, GNUCash is horribly slow... it
&gt; takes about 20 seconds to add a simple transaction to a register on
&gt; my machine (K6-III/400), 384M RAM.  It just shouldn't be that slow.

Hmm! I use GNUCash every few days and it runs like a dream. It does a 
couple too many things automaticaly and if your like me and try it out 
before reading the documentation then everything seems to go wrong, but 
since I got the hand of it I have not looked back.

If you compiled it from source, did you turn on debugging? I can't see 
any other reason for the speed difference, after all it does not have 
much to do.

&gt; If I could find a good (free beer) alternative I'd use that. My needs
&gt; aren't great, and I dont' feel justified in spending money for
&gt; software that does what I could do (albeit, with more work) in a
&gt; spreadsheet anyway. That said, it's powerful - but I'm really only
&gt; using it as a glorified spreadsheet.
&gt;
&gt; David, do you find GNUCash is as slow as I find it? Does anyone else
&gt; find it that slow?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ps. can import money and quicken files and has pretty extensive
&gt; &gt; help system for beginners. Extended online help is also available.
&gt;
&gt; The help is OK - but it doesn't explain every option in enough
&gt; detail. Have you noticed it explains the simpler parts in good detail
&gt; but the more complex features get a paragraph, no more.  Looks like
&gt; the help system was written with accounting types in mind.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Adam
