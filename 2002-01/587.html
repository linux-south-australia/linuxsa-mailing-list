Patrick, 

I have a Segate Medalist ST320423A 20.4GB sitting in my rack.
I am assuming that yours looks quite similar to mine.
When I got it I was left wondering the same things about the black
rubber cover. 
It must have something to do with drive protection, but since the rubber
is in more of
an X shape and only the corners are covered on the sides I'm not really
sure.

Wouldn't the rubber cause the HDD to build and retain heat more readily?

If it had some really Kewl and 1337 purpose I would assume that they
would put
the rubber casing on the Baraccuda drives also.

No idea really :|

&gt; 
&gt; First thing it noticed (I'm quick like that!) was the metal case of the
&gt; drive is covered with a black rubber skin.
&gt; 
&gt; Ok this does protect the circuit board on the under side, but wouldn't
&gt; it cause heat problems?
&gt; Also the drive is a few mm bigger (with this rubber cover) and takes a
&gt; little bit more of a push get it into the drive bay.
&gt; 
&gt; So is Seagate getting kinky or does this really serve a purpose????
&gt; 
&gt; Can it it be taken off (well it can I have my trusty pocket knife and an
&gt; evil grin ready), or more to the point will it break anythng if it is
&gt; taken off?
&gt; 
&gt; BTW The drive specs are glued to this cover too.
&gt; 
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
