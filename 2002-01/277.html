Hi all...

If you have ever wondered what OS bigots look like from the other side,
I recommend you join another OS's mailing list or newsgroup for a while.
The things that they do are the same things as Linux bigots do, except
for the fact that you may not agree with their point of view. It gets
even more fun if you make a well-reasoned attempt to provide an
alternative point of view. Personally, I've come to the conclusion that
all bigots are dolts. Complete and utter dolts.

Here's an eg of what you may see (taken from a Solaris x86 mailing
list):

"[No OS] so far has stacked up to Solaris, Never will and Never CAN."

Replace Solaris with any OS, or in fact, any language, editor, licence,
or whatever, and it loses none of its stupidity. I write this simply to
point out to Linux (and BSD) bigots that it's, as they say, "not a good
look". Even things that sound sensible to people absorbed into the
culture of one OS can sound completely absurd to any other group of
people...

Another quote, in response to me suggesting that maybe Sun is going to
focus on Linux at the low end as their mechanism to draw people into
Solaris/SPARC:

"Hey everybody run over run over and give Linus a big kiss between the
crack in his rear end.  He is our savor!"

And so on...

Replace Linux with Scott McNeally or Bill Gates, and it still sounds
just as dumb. Particularly when you can't spell saviour.

Anyway, if you can't see my point here, I recommend you join another
OS's list (or get somewhere where you can view that community), and
whenever something dumb is said, turn it into a pro-linux statement, and
note that it sounds just as dumb.
