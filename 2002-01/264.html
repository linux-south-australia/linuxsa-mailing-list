&gt; Errmm... i dont think this is possible. Surely it would atleast wait
&gt; till the internet connection was setup?

I didn't think so either.  It would have to get an address that your
router/masq could NAT or route to the Internet.  How would it know this?

&gt; I installed XP a week or so a go on a spare HDD, and I have heard that
&gt; it did "phone home" back to the devil himself, so I set up a packet
&gt; sniffer especially for the purpose of catching XP calling it's
&gt; mothership.

Office 2000 does a phone home over the Internet.  A friend of mine
installed a "legitimate" version of it (his father owns it and had it
installed on a computer already) and when he set it up he put in his
mailing address and all that stuff you put in to make envelopes and
letters easier to make. Well anyway, it phoned home and he got a letter
from M$ telling him to please remove the software immediately or to
purchase a licensed version (put your credit card in here and post
back).

&gt; Out of interest, here is what sniffit reported in the headers.
&gt; 
&gt; GET /download/msprod/CodeSignPCA.crl HTTP/1.0
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt; User-Agent: CryptRetrieveObjectByUrl::InetSchemeProvider
&gt; Host: crl.microsoft.com
&gt; Connection: Keep-Alive
&gt; Pragma: no-cache
&gt; 
&gt; I only noticed one single packet, the content looks to be encrypted to
&gt; me. Can give any one a copy of the log if they want it...

There's info about your computer, and the key you put into XP when you
install it.  They use it to issue license keys for the software...

&gt; On an Aside, there were australian federal police poking around outside
&gt; my place around at 3am the other morning... Associated?

Just trying to figure if this is serious... really?  Were they snooping
at your place or just in the general area? 

Although anyone that uses a GPG sig at the bottom of their emails is
bound to attract attention from the feds after Sep11.  Damn, you might
be sending encrypted email to terrorists.

Cheers,
Adam
