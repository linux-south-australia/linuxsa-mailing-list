&gt; I am about to purchase a new HDD for my little computer. My hardware
&gt; supports Ultra/66 and the HDD I am looking at is an Ultra/100.  I wanted
&gt; to confirm the Ultra/100 is backward compatible to the Ultra/66 that my
&gt; motherboard provides?

Yep, should be fine.

Note however, that I have an ata/100 capable motherboard (via kt266a) and
two drives. One is ata/66, and one is ata/100. I had to lock both to ata/66
in the bios before I could boot. But, they are both on the same chain. I'm
sure it'd be fine if i seperated them, except the other chain has two drives
too.

So, you might not want to put your new ata/100 or ata/66 drive on the same
chain as something LESS THAN ata/66. (ie. ata/33). It'll work, but dependant
onmotherboard it might run at the lower speed.

&gt;
&gt; Some of the more common brands that have appeared to me are Maxtor,
&gt; Samsung, Fujitsu, West. Dig, Seagate etc I have had good use of the
&gt; smaller Maxtor and Seagate HDDs and have preferred the Seagate because
&gt; as the HDD have aged, the Maxtor's have become quite noisy in
&gt; comparison. I have also been warned by some about the decrease in
&gt; Western Digital's quality recently.

Seagate, Fujitsu and IBM have all provided me with long life and few
problems. Maxtor and WD have given me many more problems, so I avoid them
now. Samsung, well, i dunno. I haven't tried buying one to find out.
