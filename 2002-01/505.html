Hi all,

To address some aspects of the interesting ADSL thread, and the 
questions about Internode's ADSL offering, and its price compared to 
Telstra, and the point of view that its more expensive than Telstra, 
etc etc, read on.

Lets set up the right context here.

The existing Internode ADSL offering is a -business- ADSL product.

It is far better value (not worse) than the equivalent Telstra offering.

Here is the equivalent Telstra offering. Take a look at it now:

<A HREF="http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/adslpricing.htm">http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/adslpricing.htm</A>

Those plans start at $249 per month minimum, ranging up to $699 per 
month minimum at 1.5 mb/sec.

Our plans start at $89 per month.

That is why we have a lot of business customers using the existing 
Internode product and liking it very much indeed. Our product is 
cheaper than ISDN (unlike the Telstra offering).

Now... we also have a growing number of serious residential users on 
our current ADSL plans as well, because we simply don't suck the way 
Telstra do (long story short).

I am very grateful to those people for supporting us in this way, 
despite our existing plans being 'business' targetted and hence more 
expensive than the old Telstra residential plans.

To all of you who are paying us more than the old Telstra residential 
price points, I am sincerely grateful for your support of our 
organisation, and I hope the quality of service rendered in return 
has met with your approval. You don't have much longer to wait for 
the price point to change.

We have been unable to offer residential price points until now 
because of the previously untenable wholesale pricing model we had 
with Telstra for access to some critical points in their 
infrastructure.

As I have discussed some weeks ago on this list, that got fixed 
through the efforts of a number of people including myself, over the 
course of the last year. Without that, there would be -no- 
non-Telstra residential plans from anybody at all - and indeed there 
-were- none before that was resolved.

But having fixed that, it takes some considerable additional work and 
analysis to ensure that our resulting residential offerings are sane 
and rational for both us and our customers - that they represent good 
value for customers, and that they fail to loose money for us as well 
- so we can be sure of their long term sustainability.

Various people (most notably Netspace, with a real offering, but not 
in SA, and XIS, with a vapourware offering that is naturally 
available everywhere, because it is vapour) have jumped into the 
residential market ahead of us.

We've chosen to be just a tiny bit more careful than them, in the 
name of being here in the long term. That's why we've taken a bit 
longer to get a price point into the market.

That, in turn, has now lead to the happy situation of Telstra putting 
their residential prices *up* in the meantime, just to demonstrate 
the nature of their own agendas a little more clearly while we 
complete our own offering in the residential market space.

So. Watch this space. I should have very competitive $ for you by the 
end of this week or very early next week, for Internode residential 
DSL. Scouts' honour. And it'll be worth the wait.

Some other critical differences to note between the Telstra ADSL 
offering and ours, which were not included in some of the simple 
financial comparisons posted in this thread:

	- Telstra assess excess megabytes IN BOTH DIRECTIONS on your 
ADSL service. This can lead to massive increases in excess bills if 
you choose to send a lot of data back out to the world, and equates 
to an approximately 20% 'tax' on the downloads you initiate via a 
Telstra ADSL service as well! [1].

	That means you need to multiply the Telstra excess charges by 
about 1.2 to get the 'real' charge to you.

	Internode assess excess usage levels only on the download 
direction, not on the upload path. We don't have this additional tax 
in the charging model.

	- No contract term commitments (we want you to stay because you like
	it, not because you have no choice!)

	- Bring your own ADSL device, no forced rental of one you probably
	didn't like or didn't want instead.

	- Real technical support

	- Proven track record of higher reliability ADSL than 
Telstra's offerings

	- Local company


So all of the above, and a better price than Telstra, is very nearly 
out the door from Internode. Of course it is. We're just making sure 
we are doing it -right- (something we always strive for and usually 
achieve).

Cheers,
   Simon

p.s. and I would not recommend XIS or anyone else with zero history 
and zero expertise in this realm for anybody who actually wants their 
service to work well - if at all. This -really- is a strong case of 
the parable that things which look too good to be true generally are.

[1] To explain about backchannel data flows: The typical back-channel 
overhead on a tcp/ip file transfer of any sort (ftp, web, whatever) 
is about 1/4 to 1/6th of the forward channel data transferred. So, 
for instance, download 1Mb and you can expect about 200kbytes of 
'ack' frames to flow in the other direction during the transfer. With 
Internode you don't pay for them, with Telstra, you do.
