&gt; Heya Group Again.
&gt; I had a small question
&gt; I have a New Server running With FreeBSD 4.4 On One Machine 
&gt; and FreeBSD 4.2 on Another. Now the thing is i've heard 
&gt; somewhere that when a machine shutsdown or restarts or 
&gt; something like that, the machine/s can sms your fone and tell 
&gt; you that something is wrong. I saw someone that had it 
&gt; running eg Named Died and the server sms'ed him with a 
&gt; message saying named died Is this possable? If so, Myself and 
&gt; Mick The owner would appriciate it Thankx

AFAIK, the most common way of doing this is with Netsaint, a Nokia
mobile, Gnokii and a data cable (and a phone account)...

Basically, Netsaint monitors stuff and can create events (emails, SMS's,
etc) to indicate that some state has changed. If you want it to SMS you,
either directly hook up a phone to the PC doing the monitoring, or use
an email-SMS gateway. Note that the email-SMS gateway won't tell you
that email has gone down, as it can't email the SMS to the gateway... :)
There are a number of similar limitations -- if the machine doing the
monitoring goes down, it can't generate a message to email or SMS you
with.

Note that you don't need one phone per machine -- one machine can
monitor many others, though bear in mind that your monitoring then
depends on that machine, and all the network connectivity between it and
the one(s) it's monitoring.

Does anyone provide this as a aservice? Surely it wouldn't be too hard
for (say) an ISP to allow people to add their machines to their
Netsaint/SMS monitor for a small fee... Hmm... Maybe I could do that :)
