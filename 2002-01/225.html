&gt; I don't suppose I need to run the output through a lowpass filter to 
&gt; ensure that if I use AM quality sampling that quantisation error 
&gt; (harshness) does not occur.

Shouldn't be an issue - most sound cards have anti-aliasing filters on
them these days.  It can't hurt to low-pass filter though, if you're not
sure.  Aliasing will cause all sorts of nasties when you go to MP3
format.

&gt; So for now I can just plug my walkman in - trick is that I think battery 
&gt; powered radios pick up less interference - otherwise a aerial hanging 
&gt; out the window may do the trick - and insulate the bit hanging inside 
&gt; the window from interference somehow?

If you have a radio with a good external antenna, use that with a
sheilded cable  that has the sheild connected to the PC earth, and not
the radio earth.  Keep the radio as far away from the PC as you can.
Walkman radios are terrible with PCs - the sound card's anti-aliasing
filters and super-high (compared to headphones) input impedances change
the antenna properties (they use the headphone cable as an antenna for
FM) and make the things more susceptable to interference.


&gt; I would like to eventually write a front end so that a months worth of 
&gt; programming can be scheduled in.  Another friend had the idea of pulling 
&gt; scheduling information of the Net automatically and searching / 
&gt; scheduling automatically although I think that would be incredibly 
&gt; difficult to do.

Cron would do what you want.  It wouldn't be hard to take an input for
say date, time, duration, and even frequency and parse it to a crontab
entry that sets the channel, adjusts the mixer then starts the record
process for the right duration.  That would give you an "infinite"
amount of forward programming.

&gt; I have been looking around for good radio cards for a PC that can be 
&gt; programmed with Linux - any ideas?  Or can I just build one - and 
&gt; perhaps put in short wave also?

Oatley Electronics had some FM ones for about $15.  I have one, but I
don't use it under Linux anymore.  There used to be Linux drivers for it
(V4L) but I never used them.  It was simple enough to program so I used
it as a driver writing exercise that I never finished.  I will say that
that the radio worked really really well, considering it was installed
in a PC... and that's like the anti-christ when it comes to getting good
radio reception.

If you want some help setting up a front-end for programming the thing
let me know off-list and I'll see what I can do.  What's the webpage
with the schedule information?  You shouldn't need to do direct http
access to get the page (so it shouldn't be too difficult).  There are
tools (wget, lynx) and libraries (libhttp) that can do it for you.  The
difficult part is parsing the page, and if it's not too complex, Perl
will probably do a really nice job of it.

Adam
