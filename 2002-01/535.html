<H1>BIND refreshing</H1>

<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
Intelligently, I've managed to shift my mail and DNS server from one IP
to another, without allowing enough time for DNS changes to propagate...
Hence, there are a number of name servers around the place that still
have my old MX (which no longer exists) and so on in them, with a TTL of
up to 7 days... Is there any way that I can flush the BIND cache so that
it refreshes from the new DNS? I have stopped and restarted BIND, but
this appears to either not work, or be getting cached data from the
upstream DNS... What I want is to force it to update all the way up the
chain, at least for a few important DNS servers... Anyone got any hints?

rr

PS: reason for this messup is that I only had a single DNS server, no
secondary, and it was its own DNS server -- this worked ok, though it
took a while for some clients to look it up... Then, when I decided to
make the move, I only had a few days, and forgot about resetting TTLs
etc until the last day... I did, however, get a secondary... But I
initially stuffed the zone file, forgetting the . at the end of the
record, so my NS ended up looking like host.domain.tld.mydomain.mytld
... Sigh... Anyway, all is fixed now, and hosts that haven't ever looked
me up before work fine... It's just the cached ones... Which I suspect
may include linuxsa... Sigh.
