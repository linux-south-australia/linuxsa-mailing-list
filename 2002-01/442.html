Here's what I have in place:

1. Select an ISP that uses the spam "Blacklist", that way you don't
even have to download the rubbish.  
2. For posting to usenet (the internet news system), I have my reader
set to a bogus reply address. VERY IMPORTANT - a major source of spam.
3. For surfing the net, I have given netscape a bogus username plus I
use an account on my machine that does not match anything at my ISP.
4. Subscribe only to trustable mailing lists.
5. Where I subscribe to a less than trustworthy mailing list, I'm
using one of the free e-mail aliases provided by my ISP, if that were
to fall into the hands of the spammers, I would just blow it away and
subscribe again with a new one.

... and some observations
I get very few spams, perhaps one per month. Its not clear which of
the above is working but I suspect that it is the first item. If so, I
will never know to what extent the remaining strategies contribute.
So far, I haven't had to use item number 5.

Thanks Toby, I like the sound of ricochet (no pun intended). As my
strategy appears to work due to the blacklist system, I feel that I
should contribute to keeping the list up to date.  Would ricochet do
that?

&gt;There are various solutions.. One is to always give out your email as
&gt;realusername+<A HREF="mailto:fnork@your.isp.com.au">fnork@your.isp.com.au</A>
&gt;
&gt;This way, once you start receiving spam on that email address, you can
&gt;filter it into a seperate folder, and start posting as
&gt;realusername+<A HREF="mailto:spamMeNot@your.isp.com.au">spamMeNot@your.isp.com.au</A>, then
&gt;realusername+<A HREF="mailto:spamboozled@your.isp.com.au">spamboozled@your.isp.com.au</A>, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Another method is to customise your email server, so that whenever you
&gt;receive email, it checks to see if any of the servers in the headers are
&gt;open relays, and if so it dumps the email and sends an automated reply to
&gt;the admins to fix it.
&gt;
&gt;Personally though, I just give out addresses at mydomain usually, based on
&gt;the source company.
&gt;
&gt;Eg. <A HREF="mailto:ebaycomau@mydomain.net">ebaycomau@mydomain.net</A>, <A HREF="mailto:redhatcom@mydomain.net">redhatcom@mydomain.net</A>, <A HREF="mailto:msnspam@mydomain.net">msnspam@mydomain.net</A>,
&gt;etc.
&gt;
&gt;This way if i start getting spam sent to one of those addresses, I know
&gt;which company was responsible for selling my address on, and can also block
&gt;it totally.
&gt;
&gt;Also, I have ricochet installed, which is an automated anti spam tool. You
&gt;just hit | in pine to pipe the email to ricochet, and it figures out the
&gt;sources, the open relay, etc., looks up the admins from whois info and
&gt;another database i forget, and then emails all the people who need to know.

&gt;&gt; I am sick of spam. I am sick of not having some twit whom i can whack
&gt;&gt; with a piece of 2x4 in any area remotely around me.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Opps, this is starting to sound like a rant. Rather than rant and rave,
&gt;&gt; I have decided to be some what pro-active about it. Thus I have a question.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How do you go about blocking spammers?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Can you do it by X-Mailer? Or some other such way, that identifies most
&gt;&gt; messages sent that way as spam.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Do you ever reply to the unsubsribe address or visit the web sites. (I
&gt;&gt; have been to untrusting to ever do it), and now it seems some company
&gt;&gt; has allowed my email address to escape into the wild (or a mailing list
&gt;&gt; archive ;)) So i need a solution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Any ideas would be appriciated.
