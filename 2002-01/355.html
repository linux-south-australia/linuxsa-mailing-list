I just think it would be nice if the *nix community would pull it's head 
out of its rear end and see the threat that M$ is posing to it's future. 
  This is no conspiracy theory - it in a large way due to the 
indifference and arrogance of the *nix community - which is really sad - 
because I dislike M$ with a burning passion and would like to see open 
source thrive.  I don't see how this will happen without big time unity, 
common goals, understanding, etc.

We need to do more than just hand out discs and hope that the average 
joe will work it all out.  We need much more than that.

Evolution is almost (?) in the clear - I would like to see business 
studies with that, and so on and so on.

I do love Linux - that's the problem - why I get so worked up.  No 
offence intended to anyone - I just want the best for the *nix community 
- because the M$ megacorp sure as hell aint' a community

&gt; I think what you'll find that in any large group, a small proportion are
&gt; the pedantic ones. I'd wager that the vast majority of Linux/Unix users
&gt; do not concern themselves in relatively pointless issues like HTML mail
&gt; and Vi vs Emacs wars.
&gt; 
&gt; On the topic of idealistic preferences to IT systems, at the last
&gt; LinuxSA meeting I was having some discussions with a few people on the
&gt; new Apple iMacs. For the kind of demographic at the meetings I wasn't
&gt; too surprised that some people dislike Macs. 
&gt; 
&gt; My point of view is that computers should have function (powerful,
&gt; flexible, easy to use, environmentally sound), as well as form
&gt; (aesthetics, human inspirations) integral to a product. The fact that
&gt; some people who may of had a different point of view doesn't mean we
&gt; resort to bashing each other's ideologies with each other.
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy and appreciate what Linux offers (which is a lot), and try and
&gt; ignore the petty arguments and extremists who are driven to just draw
&gt; attention to themselves.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt;
