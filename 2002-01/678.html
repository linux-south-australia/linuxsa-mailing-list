Hi Matthew, et al,

I have a few comments on your mail :)

At 6:19 PM +1030 29/1/02, Matthew Moyle-Croft wrote:

&gt;- I use more than 500MB per month (usually an extra 250MB or so), which
&gt;   costs me around $50 per month on top of the $100 per month for the base
&gt;   service.

One thing you might like to know - we've just reduced the cost of 
those extra MB's (from $0.18 to $0.15 per Mb), effective as of your 
next bill (including the current months' usage, in other words).

So, a 16% discount while we all work towards better things...(you 
heard it here, first :) ).

If the price list shows the old price on the web, hit shift-reload :)

[...]

&gt;Obviously the last option has some setup costs (at least $386 including
&gt;installing a second phone line) but given thats only 2 or 3GB worth of
&gt;traffic on the other options then it's paid off in 3 months anyway, so
&gt;that's moot.

Plus another ADSL 'modem'. Plus the risk that the second phone line 
won't support ADSL because it'll get pairgained because your street 
is already out of copper. Plus the fact that its just silly (which is 
the point you're making, I understand that).

&gt;I guess what I'm trying to point out here is that this arbitrary distinction
&gt;between Business and Residential breaks down.  I realize there is a cost
&gt;associated with fixed IPs (I do however have my own portable address space),
&gt;but it seems to be quite odd that it is cheaper to have 2 ADSL services and
&gt;2 phones lines to get 3.5GB of traffic than it is to get extra traffic on a
&gt;single connection.

The distinction between 'business' and 'residential' is actually at 
once both harder and easier than the one you're making.  The 
distinction isn't arbitrary at all. Its very closely related to 
creating appealing residential plans that also don't bankrupt the 
providers of same. It has almost nothing, directly, to do with the 
cost of fixed IP addresses. Its more the reverse - its what a fixed 
IP address tends to say about the usage intentions of the customer 
and the resulting running costs for the customers' service.

I'll explain more once our own pricing plans have 'hit the streets'. 
Right now its better I spent my time finishing that than writing long 
messages here :)

Cheers,
Simon
