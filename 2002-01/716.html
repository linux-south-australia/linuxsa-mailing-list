&gt; &gt;I thought that's why you'd use 1900 numbers...
&gt; &gt;(much easier too that trying to get a credit card number off
&gt; &gt;a customer over the phone as they're trying to report a problem)
&gt; &gt;or does that have the same TIO-related problems for the ISP?
&gt; 
&gt; If 1900 support available from various ISP's today is anything to go by, it
&gt; would appear that additional cost for support is inversely proportional to
&gt; the quality of the service.
&gt; 
&gt; Dove in Adelaide once tried doing 1900 support, then it became a generic
&gt; Internet support line, then it dissappeared. I'm guessing that they weren't
&gt; overwhelmed with calls.
&gt; 


As part of the original Dove 1900 tech support team I can attest to the
fact that the service was not economically viable. During the initial 3
month trial period, I averaged $1 per hour with extended periods of no
calls whatsoever. Since the users pay by the minute for 1900 help line,
once they get their phone bills they quickly find other ways to get
their support help for a much cheaper cost.

Providing tech support should not be seen as another small business
opportunity, but rather as necessary to reassure customers who are yet
provided with excellent quality of service, clear and precise
documentation, and still fail to resolve their difficulties without
additional assistance. Even the best managed and maintained networks
still encounter people for whom the telephone support lines are seen as
not only critical to their needs, but also their right.
