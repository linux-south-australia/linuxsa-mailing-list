&gt;&gt; When I try installing from CD the PC tells me that the CD isn't bootable.
&gt;&gt; The CD was purchased from Netcraft. However, I have tried this CD on another
&gt;&gt; PC and it boots. I went back to the original PC and got a copy of Red Hat
&gt;&gt; 7.1 (this was also purchased from Netcraft). This CD works. I also got a
&gt;&gt; copy of W98 SE and it also boot from this PC. What is going on?

&gt; I don't think I saw your post answered, sorry if I missed it. But
&gt; anyway, your problem is not that the CD isn't bootable, but your PC has
&gt; an older BIOS and does not support booting from CD. You will probably
&gt; need to make a boot floppy and go from there.

I had a similar problem recently installing 7.2, but with a slight twist.
The install would boot off the CDROM OK, but couldn't proceed because no
CD-ROM drive was found.  Creating a boot floppy did the same thing; no
CD-ROM found (despite the fact it actually has five - a burner and
4-stacker).  Only oddity is that the box is all SCSI, and the install
&lt;Alt-Debug&gt; showed all the mounts of the SCSI drives failed (even though
the driver was loaded, the hard disks could be accessed OK and the CD
could be read fine when booted back into 6.2.  In the end I did a network
installation, which worked OK except that I didn't have the disk space to
have both CDs online at once.

I was curious to know if this is what you saw.
