Im currently planning a better way to manage a couple of networks that I
run here in adealide. Since it grew out of a small network, despite
being workable, it could be done better which is what Im planning now.
Currently all IPs are static, and manually configured on each machine.
Obviously from a administration perspective this is bad. Im thinking of
reorganising these networks in 2 stages. 

Stage 1: Set up a couple of DHCP servers (1 per network), and generate
some config files that will allocate people their previous static IP and
then change everyone over to DHCP.

Stage 2: Change chunks of IP ranges on the DHCP server, and get people
to reboot bring those changes in to effect.

However, Im looking for ideas on the best way to do this. I can use nmap
to pingscan each net, and then use arp to get a list of IP and hardware
address pairs, and then write a perl script to convert this over to dhcp
config files and manually add any machines that were turned off or
manually correct any errors. However, is anyone awear of any IP
management type software with a database backend, that can generate dhcp
output from the database and have useful features/grouping such as
department or whatever in the database?

How would others do it?

In a network of many different OSes (including miscrosoft) should I be
considering NIS or NIS+? If I try something like that whats the chances
of it causeing more trouble than its worth?
