Aristole,

Unless your experiences have been different to mine, I've generally
found the LinuxSA and most other Linux groups are very helpful.

You occasionally get people who like to tear down others, but
fortunately these are fairly uncommon.

Linux for desktop use (general computing for the masses) is only 3-4
years old. Microsoft and Apple have had 10 years or more to work on
their desktop usability. Since the desktop market is continually
evolving, competitors have to watch out for new applications opening,
and capture new territory. 

Today's savvy home users are editing DV video, creating high-quality
digital photo albums, playing high end 3D games, and creating DVD-R
movies of their kid's birthdays. 3 years ago I would have never have
thought this possible on a home computer. Linux should be able to catch
up reasonably well giving 2-3 years. For most other mundane stuff like
word processing, spreadsheets, and general productivity - well I think
it's getting pretty close especially with the expected delivery of
StarOffice 6

The fact that I'm using Linux as a top quality desktop OS, proves to me
that it's making real progress there already. Then again I could be
wrong.

Cheers,

&gt;   This is no conspiracy theory - it in a large way due to the 
&gt; indifference and arrogance of the *nix community - which is really sad - 
&gt; because I dislike M$ with a burning passion and would like to see open 
&gt; source thrive.  I don't see how this will happen without big time unity, 
&gt; common goals, understanding, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; We need to do more than just hand out discs and hope that the average 
&gt; joe will work it all out.  We need much more than that.
&gt; 
&gt; Evolution is almost (?) in the clear - I would like to see business 
&gt; studies with that, and so on and so on.
&gt; 
&gt; I do love Linux - that's the problem - why I get so worked up.  No 
&gt; offence intended to anyone - I just want the best for the *nix community 
&gt; - because the M$ megacorp sure as hell aint' a community

&gt; &gt; I think what you'll find that in any large group, a small proportion are
&gt; &gt; the pedantic ones. I'd wager that the vast majority of Linux/Unix users
&gt; &gt; do not concern themselves in relatively pointless issues like HTML mail
&gt; &gt; and Vi vs Emacs wars.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; On the topic of idealistic preferences to IT systems, at the last
&gt; &gt; LinuxSA meeting I was having some discussions with a few people on the
&gt; &gt; new Apple iMacs. For the kind of demographic at the meetings I wasn't
&gt; &gt; too surprised that some people dislike Macs. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My point of view is that computers should have function (powerful,
&gt; &gt; flexible, easy to use, environmentally sound), as well as form
&gt; &gt; (aesthetics, human inspirations) integral to a product. The fact that
&gt; &gt; some people who may of had a different point of view doesn't mean we
&gt; &gt; resort to bashing each other's ideologies with each other.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Enjoy and appreciate what Linux offers (which is a lot), and try and
&gt; &gt; ignore the petty arguments and extremists who are driven to just draw
&gt; &gt; attention to themselves.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Cheers,
&gt; &gt;
