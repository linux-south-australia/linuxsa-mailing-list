&gt; Ive been running evolution since v0.13 and have found it pretty reliable
&gt; (in later times anyway). However I think I've damaged the data files with
&gt; all my mail in them as the mail component dies after evolution has been
&gt; running about 10-15 seconds. Ive rmed everything out of ~/evolution/config
&gt; and ~/evolution/local/Inbox/*/*.xml (all the metadata and summary files
&gt; which I thought  could be recreated), but it still dies not long after
&gt; coming up. Fortunatly I got this webmail going today so I've been using
&gt; that as a backup :) Any ideas about where to look for whats going wrong,
&gt; or any software that'll do a check over my mail files (mbox) and fix
&gt; anything too wierd about them?

Try deleting the mbox.ibex files in each of your folders. Restart
Evolution, and it should rebuild the summary files. That *may* fix your
problem -- it's helped me in the past.

Note that rebuilding your indexes may take a while. It took a PIII-500
about 3 minutes to rebuild my indexes, but that was when my ~/evolution/
folder was about ~180MB.

&gt; These mail problem first started occuring under evolution 1.0.0 and an
&gt; upgrade to 1.0.1 didnt fix them :(

Did it just start happening all-of-a-sudden, or was there a precursory
event (such as a dirty shutdown to Evolution when it was writing to the
mail store)? 

&gt; Also, in regards to my request for wemail reccomendations the other day -
&gt; squirrelmail was simple to set up and exactly what I wanted :)

Yeah, I found SquirrelMail OK for a while, but its interface sucks, and
it didn't seem to cope with quoting particularly well. That said, it was
an older version. Tell me, how are you finding it now?
