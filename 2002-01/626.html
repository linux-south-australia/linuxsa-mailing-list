Hi  Ian,
    The Quick answer is, Yes!

I've personally only played with these to see that they were there, and 
as a comparison to the programs I was being taught. namely MYOB and 
Access.  I thought they compared pretty favourably.  I admit though that 
it was only a quick look and I don't use these functions for my personal 
accounts.

ps although Reports / Profit and loss is in the documentation Invoices 
isn't, However thay exists in the General ledger under Transactions.

pps The included manual is also online at www.gnucash.org/docs/C/
sometimes this link doesn't work direct so go to www.gnucash.org  and in 
the sidebar choose under Documentation choose the language you prefer.

&gt;Hi David,
&gt;
&gt;I use QuickBooks 7 to handle my small business especially for producing 
&gt;invoices and P & L Statements for various bodies.
&gt;
&gt;Can gnucash do things like that? Or another Linux program do those 
&gt;things?
&gt;
&gt;Cheers, Ian
