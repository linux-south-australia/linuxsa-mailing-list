After some more hunting around, I have discovered that BIND does (as I
thought it might, but wasn't real sure) keep its cache in memory, and
has to rebuild it everytime it restarts... Then I hunted around further,
and experiemented by inserting certain records in the root hints file...
Which didn't work (one day, I will understand DNS fully, and then I
shall KNOW...)

Anyway, I managed to set it up as a slave, and that worked...

Woo....

(I realise that's not all that clear... There are two NS's involved --
my domain's, and another that I manage. I shifted mine without
shortening the TTLs, and now the one that I manage can't see my own
domain. Hence, I set the one I manage up as a slave of my own... And it
does an AXFR, and works...)

rr

&gt; Intelligently, I've managed to shift my mail and DNS server 
&gt; from one IP to another, without allowing enough time for DNS 
&gt; changes to propagate... Hence, there are a number of name 
&gt; servers around the place that still have my old MX (which no 
&gt; longer exists) and so on in them, with a TTL of up to 7 
&gt; days... Is there any way that I can flush the BIND cache so 
&gt; that it refreshes from the new DNS? I have stopped and 
&gt; restarted BIND, but this appears to either not work, or be 
&gt; getting cached data from the upstream DNS... What I want is 
&gt; to force it to update all the way up the chain, at least for 
&gt; a few important DNS servers... Anyone got any hints?
&gt; 
&gt; rr
&gt; 
&gt; PS: reason for this messup is that I only had a single DNS 
&gt; server, no secondary, and it was its own DNS server -- this 
&gt; worked ok, though it took a while for some clients to look it 
&gt; up... Then, when I decided to make the move, I only had a few 
&gt; days, and forgot about resetting TTLs etc until the last 
&gt; day... I did, however, get a secondary... But I initially 
&gt; stuffed the zone file, forgetting the . at the end of the 
&gt; record, so my NS ended up looking like 
&gt; host.domain.tld.mydomain.mytld ... Sigh... Anyway, all is 
&gt; fixed now, and hosts that haven't ever looked me up before 
&gt; work fine... It's just the cached ones... Which I suspect may 
&gt; include linuxsa... Sigh.
