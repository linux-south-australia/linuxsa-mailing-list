I'd just like to clarify for some of the Linux SA readers that there are two
(2) separate business ADSL plans from Telstra.

a) There is the highly reliable ( allegedly ) Bigpond Direct plan which is
what Simon is referring to as being comparable to the current Internode
business plan. This service is high grade and actually works ( LOL )but is
damn expensive. BPD has a usage meter that works also !!

b) there is the standard Bigpond broadband plan which is in reality the same
as that provided for the home users but which previously attracted a higher
rate if you were a business user. This service has extremely poor
performance/uptime.

I would not even consider entertaining the idea of running any sort of
business on the 2nd plan if your business relies on an always on connection.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; To address some aspects of the interesting ADSL thread, and the
&gt; questions about Internode's ADSL offering, and its price compared to
&gt; Telstra, and the point of view that its more expensive than Telstra,
&gt; etc etc, read on.
&gt;
&gt; Lets set up the right context here.
&gt;
&gt; The existing Internode ADSL offering is a -business- ADSL product.
&gt;
&gt; It is far better value (not worse) than the equivalent
&gt; Telstra offering.
&gt;
&gt; Here is the equivalent Telstra offering. Take a look at it now:
&gt;
&gt; <A HREF="http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/adslpricing.htm">http://telstra.com.au/bigpond/direct/adslpricing.htm</A>
&gt;
&gt; Those plans start at $249 per month minimum, ranging up to $699 per
&gt; month minimum at 1.5 mb/sec.
&gt;
&gt; Our plans start at $89 per month.
&gt;
&gt; That is why we have a lot of business customers using the existing
&gt; Internode product and liking it very much indeed. Our product is
&gt; cheaper than ISDN (unlike the Telstra offering).
