OK, it's getting weirder now... I've replaced all three network cards
with Intel EEPro 10/100 S cards, and it worked fine for a day. Now, it's
happenning again -- getting around 40% loss. I can ping out from the
firewall no worries -- and it is using the same card for the external
interface, going via an ETH-ADSL bridge... It's just internal -- two
intel cards with a "SOHO" brand 10/100 switch in the middle.

I don't think it's anything to do with routing, as I'm not running any
routing protocols, and the routing tables look quite OK to me...

Firewalling -- well, again, nothing's changed since when it was working
fine last week, nor since it was working fine yesterday...

QoS on XP -- well, I turned it off, and it hasn't changed anything
(though all existing connections died...)

WinXP in general -- well, again, nothing's changed since yesterday, or
last week, and I've rebooted regularly, as directed by my doctor. I
haven't tried RH yet, but will do that shortly -- if I don't email to
say "it's just XP", then RH is doing it too...

Cables -- change of cables didn't help.

Switch -- this is the only thing that has remained constant... I will
dig out a Xover cable shortly and try that, but it'a PITA to do...

Anyone else got any other ideas? This is just such a stupid, irritating
kind of problem...

rr

&gt; Thanks for the help, everyone -- I changed cables to no 
&gt; avail, then swapped one of the RTL cards out and replaced it 
&gt; with an Intel card... That worked... I'll be swapping the 
&gt; other cards for Intels as well...
