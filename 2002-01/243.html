Hi There,
    The only thing you should have to do is set the serial
port speed etc. This is done with the setserial command. The
exact syntax eludes me at the moment, but there is a man
page for them. The drivers are default built in to the
system. If you have one serial card, then you have drivers
to cope with 4 serial ports. The only time you *might* need
special drivers is if you are installing one of the super
serial cards with 8, 16, 24, pick a number of ports. These
cards use special interrupts etc to work and so need special
drivers. Hope this helps.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

&gt;
&gt; Hmm, maybe I'm showing my ignorance here, but wouldn't I
need drivers, if only
&gt; to drive some serial-port looking /dev entry and send the
results to and from
&gt; the card?  Or is that already provided by some generic PCI
serial port card
&gt; driver that I can use?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;

&gt; &gt; Hi There,
&gt; &gt;     In answer to the first part of your query, in my
&gt; &gt; experience, the PCI standard has been around for more
than
&gt; &gt; long enough so that all of the interface problems should
be
&gt; &gt; gone by now. This is more than true with the serial
standard
&gt; &gt; that has been around for maybe 40 years? I usually just
buy
&gt; &gt; a vanilla 2 port serial card and it should just work.
Brand
&gt; &gt; shouldn't be an issue. Dick Smith has suitable ones on
the
&gt; &gt; shelf (but they are a little expensive - as much as $30
&gt; &gt; maybe). I have installed a few hundred Serial port cards
&gt; &gt; over the years, and as long as the jumpers are set
correctly
&gt; &gt; (factory defaults don't always work) you will not have
too
&gt; &gt; many problems. Hope this has helped.
&gt;
