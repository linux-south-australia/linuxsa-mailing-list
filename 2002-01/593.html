Thanx for the reply Adam

The question came about after I spent some time &gt;3hours recovering lost word files, from office 2000. He is absolutely sure he saved at least several times
but when he froze and had to reboot they had vanished from the HDD. (They were still there as temp files)

He was complaining bitterly that word has been steadily becomming less reliable for big docs (i think this was discussed some time back on tis list)
He predominantly writes lots of text with few diagrams and no special formating.  He is not computer literate, it is a tool no more no less.

I can't trust Koffice or Abiword and I don't think he could or would like to manage Latex.
StarOffice might be a good chioce but I don't know enough about it to be sure.  If it does not lose its documents then it migt suffice.


Thanx again

Steve D

&gt;&gt; My usual thoughts were Lyx & Klyx although I'm not sure if they are robust enough to manage 1000+ pages.
&gt;
&gt;I have found that LaTeX is pretty robust no matter how many pages.  Most
&gt;We have quite a few people using it at Uni to write their final thesis
&gt;dissertation (which gets large, and cumbersome, and full of images).
&gt;
&gt;Lyx (and Klyx) are really just front-ends to LaTeX anyway - they use
&gt;their own file format, but they convert to a tex file for processing.
&gt;
&gt;Is your friend highly computer savvy or is your friend one of the "point
&gt;and click, oh shit, it's done something different to normal I'd better
&gt;call an expert" kind of person?
&gt;
&gt;If your friend falls closer to the latter category, I'd recommend
&gt;steering clear of Lyx and/or LaTeX.  Staroffice or Word perfect (or
&gt;Abiword or KOffice) may be better alternatives.  They provide a much
&gt;more "user-friendly" interface to the uninitiated user.  Staroffice is
&gt;pretty stable with large documents if you break the document into
&gt;chapters and store each in a separate file.  That's not too hard to do
&gt;once you get used to it either.
&gt;
&gt;If your friend is closer to the former category then I'd recommend going
&gt;straight to LaTeX source. It's not hard to learn if you have a real task
&gt;for it.  It's available on Unix and Windows (and just about everything
&gt;in between), and there's squidloads of information available to help you
&gt;out. I say your friend needs to be more experienced, as TeX (of any
&gt;variety) outputs its build errors in text form and sometimes they're
&gt;worse than the output of a compiler when you need to track down a source
&gt;error.
&gt;
&gt;If your friend falls in the middle, he can try LyX of Klyx. I tried LyX
&gt;once and it looked OK, but it wasn't exactly fast (execution speed), and
&gt;it didn't seem overly stable - I crashed it by trying to display a
&gt;simple one page file as DVI. I can't speak for Klyx. The interface is a
&gt;little clunky compared to the more polished word processors too.
&gt;
&gt;You don't say exactly what your friend is trying to do though - does he
&gt;have large text documents, or does he use lots of graphics and tricky
&gt;formatting everywhere?  These things also help to decide what software
&gt;to select.
&gt;
&gt;Hope this has been of some help.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;Adam
&gt;
