I had this marvelous idea (that I'm sure someone else has already
thought of) the other day for monitoring servers.

There's the incredibly easy, and as you'd expect, incredibly *BORING*
Gnokii/5110 combination which will SMS me if something breaks, or, the
setup that I'd prefer, a voice call to my cell phone if something
breaks!

I've seen various HOWTOs on the Inter-web describing the steps you'd
take to setup a system that'd talk to you through speakers in your
server room when something stopped working, but that'd not be much use
if you're out of your server room (as you are most of the time).

I've had a look at the vm utility that comes with mgetty+sendfax. It's
part of the voice suite that mgetty+sendfax has.

I've got a sound file (in RMD[1] format) that I can play out to the
modem's sound-out plug, but I want to play it to a phone call. vm will
dial a number (vm dial number), but I can't figure out how to make it
play music or a prerecorded message once it has connected.

Does anyone have any experience in setting this up? I've not yet taken
this to the mgetty lists, as I was hoping that someone local may be able
to help with the problem first.

I'm sure it's possible. I just hope that I don't have to result to text
messaging :-) Then again, I can live with text messaging if I have to.
