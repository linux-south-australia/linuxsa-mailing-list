&gt; &gt; I'm unable the read a CD which has been burned on an iMac. RH7.2 does 
&gt; &gt; not recognise the CDFS file system. The given file system is not 
&gt; &gt; recorded as format in the mount man pages either.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Has anyone an idea how to extract the data from the CD?
&gt;
&gt; If it's not a standard ISO9660 CD-ROM file system, I'd try mounting the 
&gt; CD as an HFS or UDF file system.  As I understand it, HFS is commonly 
&gt; found on Apple Macintosh systems, and UDF is a format used for packet 
&gt; writing, commonly used on CD-RWs and DVDs (I could be wrong).

Mac's also like HFS+. I believe the support for HFS+ is somewhat dodgy,
though I'm not sure whether it'd be used on optical media such as a CD.

&gt; Is "CDFS" a file system type?  Could it be synonymous with ISO9660? 

I don't think so. I seem to recall creating a few coasters when I first
used the Apple CD Burning program included with the recent iMac's.

&gt; What told you the CD was CDFS?

The Apple CD Burning software, probably. IIRC, there are 3 different
file systems that you can use. Only one of them is "PC"-compatible.

&gt; Do file systems have some sort of header or code indicating their type? 
&gt;   Can the file system type be easily deduced?

Digging this far down is probably a waste of time. Simply take the CD to
your nearest Mac, copy the data to the hard disk and burn the CD again
using a format that is supported by Linux. Unfortunately, it's been
several months since I used a Mac, so I can't remember the file system
that you have to choose from the combo-box during CD creation.

Perhaps this could be clarified by one of our (or is that our only :-)
Macintosh zealot(s).
