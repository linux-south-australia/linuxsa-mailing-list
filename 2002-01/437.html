There are various solutions.. One is to always give out your email as
realusername+<A HREF="mailto:fnork@your.isp.com.au">fnork@your.isp.com.au</A>

This way, once you start receiving spam on that email address, you can
filter it into a seperate folder, and start posting as
realusername+<A HREF="mailto:spamMeNot@your.isp.com.au">spamMeNot@your.isp.com.au</A>, then
realusername+<A HREF="mailto:spamboozled@your.isp.com.au">spamboozled@your.isp.com.au</A>, etc.

Another method is to customise your email server, so that whenever you
receive email, it checks to see if any of the servers in the headers are
open relays, and if so it dumps the email and sends an automated reply to
the admins to fix it.

Personally though, I just give out addresses at mydomain usually, based on
the source company.

Eg. <A HREF="mailto:ebaycomau@mydomain.net">ebaycomau@mydomain.net</A>, <A HREF="mailto:redhatcom@mydomain.net">redhatcom@mydomain.net</A>, <A HREF="mailto:msnspam@mydomain.net">msnspam@mydomain.net</A>,
etc.

This way if i start getting spam sent to one of those addresses, I know
which company was responsible for selling my address on, and can also block
it totally.

Also, I have ricochet installed, which is an automated anti spam tool. You
just hit | in pine to pipe the email to ricochet, and it figures out the
sources, the open relay, etc., looks up the admins from whois info and
another database i forget, and then emails all the people who need to know.

&gt; I am sick of spam. I am sick of not having some twit whom i can whack
&gt; with a piece of 2x4 in any area remotely around me.
&gt;
&gt; Opps, this is starting to sound like a rant. Rather than rant and rave,
&gt; I have decided to be some what pro-active about it. Thus I have a question.
&gt;
&gt; How do you go about blocking spammers?
&gt;
&gt; Can you do it by X-Mailer? Or some other such way, that identifies most
&gt; messages sent that way as spam.
&gt;
&gt; Do you ever reply to the unsubsribe address or visit the web sites. (I
&gt; have been to untrusting to ever do it), and now it seems some company
&gt; has allowed my email address to escape into the wild (or a mailing list
&gt; archive ;)) So i need a solution.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas would be appriciated.
&gt;
