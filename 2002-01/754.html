&gt; Pay-per-incident tech support isn't practical in Australia. 
&gt; If an ISP refuses to fix a user's problem on the grounds that 
&gt; the user won't pay the support cost, then the user can 
&gt; complain to the TIO.
&gt; 
&gt; This in turn costs the ISP something like $60 to have the 
&gt; compaint resolved, even if the user is completely in the wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; In other words, it's not worth the hassle to do 
&gt; pay-per-incident support.

Hmmm... IANAISP, but....

This is frustrating (for you as well as us, I suspect), as I think many
of us here would not consider the TIO -- when you're in the IT industry
in Adelaide, it's not worth pissing off too many other associated
businesses... I see your bind, but maybe it could be done by invitation
only, or with certain qualifying factors, or something (are there any
arrangements that the TIO doesn't cover?)... Certainly, a reliable ISP
would be essential (and there are a few of them around), because you
don't want to have to deal with the case where the ISP screws up and
you're losing data all the time and so on... Basically, if there could
be a level of trust between the ISP and the customer, such that the ISP
just supplies IP as reliably as it can, and the customer resolves
customer-end problems 99% of the time, and pays for the rest, then this
could work... Note also that when I said "no support", I meant not only
no support calls, but no POP/SMTP service, no webmail, and so on -- bare
IP, with upstream DNS, and proxying (simply because the ISP would want
it)...

And I like Matthew's idea too:
Choose your speed
Choose your data included and excess rate (like mobile phone deals --
there's no reason why this can't go from 0MB included, $1/Mb excess,
right up to no limit for $1,000,000 per week or something...)
Choose your IP type
Choose your SLA (Geek -- no support, no services; Home -- normal;
Business -- you pay through nose, we bend over backwards)

Of course, the SLA presently restricts all the other options in what may
be considered unusual ways... Maybe Home users need to be restricted to
certain things that are simple to support (dyn IP), and business users
restricted to some things that matter to them (stat IP, lots of support,
uptime garantees?)... Hmm... 

Anyway... Just pining for things I would like... I'm not going to start
my own ISP to make it happen... :)
