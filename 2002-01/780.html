&gt;I seen two many reiser file system which were corrupted, files 
&gt;which would
&gt;not delete, whole partitions which were corrupt. The reiser 
&gt;fixing tools are
&gt;not up to the job.

I find this interesting, obviously your experience is a bit more varied
than mine, but we've been running reiser on a 30G data partition shared
among
70 workstations and haven't had any trouble.  That includes recovering from
a serious crash when we lost 2 RAID drives out of 4 from overheating.  The
only data we lost beyond recovery was some Office docs which were open at 
the time of the crash.  We also converted from kernel 2.2 to 2.4 and
upgraded reiser versions along with that without incident.

We also have a number of smaller networks running Samba on reiserfs
partitions
and have had no trouble with those either.

Now that RH 7.2 has ext3 available by default the last 2 servers we set up
used ext3 for the data shares, also no problems with those.  The other
reason
apart from ease of installation was obviously the backward compatibility as
you mentioned.

Just my 2c + GST
