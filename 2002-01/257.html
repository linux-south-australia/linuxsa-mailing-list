 &gt; Here's a little sideline info for you. Those of you that have read my
 &gt; insufferable posts know that I have as little to do with M$ as humanly
 &gt; possible.
 &gt;
 &gt; Well today I received a threatening letter from M$. So that tells me a
 &gt; couple of things. First any corporation might receive the letter even if
 &gt; they abstain from the sins of consorting with the devil and his well
 &gt; known dos-extensions.
 &gt;
 &gt; And the threat is global in nature encompassing all programs that run on
 &gt; their dos-extensions.
 &gt;
 &gt; Some of the figures that are on the letter say that in the state where I
 &gt; am incorporated 16% of business software applications aren't properly
 &gt; licensed.
 &gt;
 &gt; That my company could face fines of up to $150,000 for each program
 &gt; copied, even unintentionally.
 &gt;
 &gt; This is the part that shows how desperate they are to maintain their
 &gt; monopoly, they are offering me a 20% discount on software if I let them
 &gt; audit my systems.
 &gt;
 &gt; No thank you Mr. Gates(of hell), I shall not entertain the price of
 &gt; darkness nor his liege of gestapo cronies, in my dwelling. May your soul
 &gt; Mr. Gates(of hell) and those of your dominion rest in hell.

I would post this to a Windows groups too. Those poor souls don't know
what they're signing up to...

Sometime ago I had an interesting encounter with Windows XP Pro. I was
trying to install it on my laptop, that just happened to be conncted via
my LM box to the Internet. I just didn't take off the PCMCIA card. I had
a sniffer (tcpdump) running on that LM machine.

Sometime during the installation I noticed that my laptop is trying to
obtain an IP from my LM box. XP was "Copying files, blah-blah-blah...",
but the machine was looking for a DHCP server using its NIC hardware
address.

I don't have a DHCP server on my LM machine, so I waited to see what
will happen next. The laptop OBTAINED an IP FROM MY INTERNET
PROVIDER!!!! I didn't know it was possible. And it sent something to
another IP. I saw with my own eyes on my LAN traffic from 64.*** to 209.***

A week ago I received an e-mail from Microsoft, in which I was referred
to as "Dear .NET customer" and warned that IE that comes with XP has a
security whole that CAN ENDANGER MY *PRIVACY!!!!!* The e-mail
specifically asked me not to reply to it, since the address was not
monitored. Otherwise I would thank them and say that my privacy is safe
thank to them. I will never touch XP again.

Good Luck,
UT
