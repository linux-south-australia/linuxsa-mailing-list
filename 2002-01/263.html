&lt;message on= Tue, 15 Jan 2002 22:02:14 +1030 by=Aristotle&gt;

&gt; Sometime during the installation I noticed that my laptop is trying to
&gt; obtain an IP from my LM box. XP was "Copying files,
&gt; blah-blah-blah...",
&gt; but the machine was looking for a DHCP server using its NIC hardware
&gt; address.

hehehe suspected this for a while...

&gt; 
&gt; I don't have a DHCP server on my LM machine, so I waited to see what
&gt; will happen next. The laptop OBTAINED an IP FROM MY INTERNET
&gt; PROVIDER!!!! I didn't know it was possible. And it sent something to
&gt; another IP. I saw with my own eyes on my LAN traffic from 64.*** to
&gt; 209.***
 
Errmm... i dont think this is possible. Surely it would atleast wait
till the internet connection was setup?

I installed XP a week or so a go on a spare HDD, and I have heard that
it did "phone home" back to the devil himself, so I set up a packet
sniffer especially for the purpose of catching XP calling it's
mothership.

It contacted crl.microsoft.com (207.46.197.113), which (understandably)
does not reply to a ping request.

Out of interest, here is what sniffit reported in the headers.

GET /download/msprod/CodeSignPCA.crl HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*
User-Agent: CryptRetrieveObjectByUrl::InetSchemeProvider
Host: crl.microsoft.com
Connection: Keep-Alive
Pragma: no-cache

I only noticed one single packet, the content looks to be encrypted to
me. Can give any one a copy of the log if they want it...

On an Aside, there were australian federal police poking around outside
my place around at 3am the other morning... Associated?
