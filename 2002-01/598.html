&gt; Would Star Office handle his needs, it wouldn't require much learning
&gt; and if he still has any files left export them as .rtf and import them
&gt; into StarOffice.

It doesn't crash that much - even under Windows.  It's a dog if you get
large files (lots of graphics) though - he'd have to spend some time
learning it to use its advanced features (tables of contents, indices,
etc).

I think the reply about backing up and autosave are also very relevant
to this thread. That said, the autosave in Word has inversely as much
chance as being useful as WinXP does of phoning home!
 
&gt; .rtf is reasonably portable.

That's what you think... :-) Better than Word format, but still not so
portable.

Suggest your friend try stone tablets and chisels - far more reliable.
Although, WP5.1 for DOS was excellent, fast and easier to use than
something like LyX, however it had no GUI and there is another learning
curve.

I suggest you try out Star Office (even for winbites), and try and get
your friend to learn Latex some simple LaTeX on the side - he might find
that he actually likes the simplicity of LaTeX over other things.

Cheers,
Adam
