&gt; charting features that disappeared when Office 95 came out. I have had Word
&gt; repeatedly stuff up the formatting of its own document, crash when trying
&gt; to print documents with simple images in them and chew up all the available
&gt; disc space by demanding more memory and causing the OS to create a huge
&gt; (virtual memory) swap file (over 1GB) whne editing files of 20-30K. Also
&gt; try using some of the advanced features like master document and find out
&gt; how difficult it is to manage consistent formats across all sub-documents
&gt; if you don't edit only through the master document. Nice feature but very
&gt; frustrating to use.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course it is easy to overlook the price of applications when comparing
&gt; operability and features when you are not paying for them. I have for a
&gt; number of years been trying to migrate to Linux but have found that a
&gt; number of applications I use do not have any equivalents available in
&gt; Linux. I have looked at Wine but have not have any success in running
&gt; anything but the simples programmes. I must agree however that Linux will
&gt; only start to displace M$ windows as a desktop OS when it can run a
&gt; majority of the M$ applications with relative ease.

VMWare works extremely well for running nearly ALL M$ products on a
linux desktop.
The only thing vmware is not really suited for is running M$ games as
the graphic environment is set by whatever mode X is running.

P.S. And by running the latest fvwm (2.4.4 or cvs) you can actually run
BOTH gnome AND kde at the same time even. Although you can have
conflicts with the file managers so it's best to just use either gnome's
or kde's.
