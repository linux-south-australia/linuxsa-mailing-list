&gt;How do most of you keep up-to-date with the latest releases of software
&gt;without the RPM dependency hassles? I like GNOME and have followed the
&gt;project since gtk became gtk+. However with software like evolution,
&gt;gnumeric and galeon finally reaching 1.0 status and beyond, I find that
&gt;getting all the right rpms (for mandrake) difficult. Source is easily
&gt;found.
&gt;What do most of you do? Wrangle RPMs or have a development "/opt" or
&gt;"/usr/local/" version of the software?

It can be painful, particularly with Mandrake.  They (Mandrake) are usually
pretty reliable in updating their "Cooker" rpms to the latest versions, ie:
they have Evolution 1.0.1 and dependent rpms.

Updating **easily** is the problem.  I find urpmi from the CL to be one of
the 
easier ways to sort out dependency issues in Mandrake.  You can use the gui
version also (Mandrake Update), but IMO the CL is easier. You do have to set

up the sources first, check the man pages, I usually set up one of the
cooker 
mirrors as a source (mirror.aarnet of course :o), that way when you install 
say Evolution 1.0.1 it can grab the latest dependencies from the cooker
mirror.  
Urpmi does all this automagically, it will tell you that x, y & z packages 
need to be installed & then go off & do its thing.

(of course this doesn't prevent things from being broken in the process,
bear in 
mind that the cooker RPMs are developmental and probably haven't been fully
tested
against all the other packages yet, I have had a couple problems in the past
with
cooker packages, not with Evolution 1.0.1 tho, it seems to work fine)
