&gt; One thing you might like to know - we've just reduced the cost of 
&gt; those extra MB's (from $0.18 to $0.15 per Mb), effective as of your 
&gt; next bill (including the current months' usage, in other words).

Thanks.  It's a start ...

&gt; Plus another ADSL 'modem'. Plus the risk that the second phone line 
&gt; won't support ADSL because it'll get pairgained because your street 
&gt; is already out of copper. Plus the fact that its just silly (which is 
&gt; the point you're making, I understand that).

The Telstra Residential price includes a 'modem' if you sign for an 18 month 
contract.  But yes my point is that buying two complete services is silly.

&gt; The distinction between 'business' and 'residential' is actually at 
&gt; once both harder and easier than the one you're making.  The 
&gt; distinction isn't arbitrary at all. Its very closely related to 
&gt; creating appealing residential plans that also don't bankrupt the 
&gt; providers of same. It has almost nothing, directly, to do with the 
&gt; cost of fixed IP addresses. Its more the reverse - its what a fixed 
&gt; IP address tends to say about the usage intentions of the customer 
&gt; and the resulting running costs for the customers' service.

Eh?  I don't get it. Providers seem to make a difference between Business 
and Non-Business since I was in the ISP game.  But ultimately it's really 
about being able to differential prices based on who can/will pay more as 
opposed to intentions (I've thought about this lots because I used to have 
to explain it to customers who didn't get it because it was arbitrary).

I run webservers which send out almost as much traffic as I receive.  I run 
a mail server for myself.  Does this really cost a different amount to 
service to someone who doesn't and who merely websurfs?  Not really.  It's 
IP packets.  You can't sell IP packets at a loss to residential or business.

&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Simon
