The Hardware issue is my main gripe. This discussion brings back memories of
my devotion to Amigas and it's O/S back in the early 90s. It was a great O/S
and there was a lot of end user support, but the hardware incompatibility
killed the Amiga ( Yes I know it still exists but is but a shadow ).

The last Amiga I purchased was an A1200 back in about 1993. It had AGA
graphics but to use it in it's glory you had to buy an overpriced Commodore
1960 Monitor. They were really expensive and impossible to source. I had a
monitor on order for 2 months before I received it !! There were only a
handful ever to be shipped to Australia, and when I sold my monitor I sold
it for MORE than I paid for it. Memory was not off the shelf either. If you
wanted to upgrade a HD you had to get a 2.5" HD or a special external
mounting kit.

It was the hardware ( lack of and overpricing ) that Killed Amiga and Macs
to my mind fall into the same category. So much hardware is not compatible
with Macs or you need to order a separate adaptor.

I would be happy to move away from the i386 architecture to Power PC or
similar but If I want to be able to go out and buy monitors and peripherals
that will work with them for a reasonable price.

&gt; The problem I have, which I've enumerated before on LinuxSA,
&gt; is the closed
&gt; source nature of the UI.  It's not the "free beer" issue -
&gt; I'll happily pay for
&gt; my software, but it's the "free speech" bit.  With OS-X I'm
&gt; locked into
&gt; (overpriced) (Apple) PPC hardware.  I have no avenue for
&gt; finding or fixing
&gt; bugs, or making any improvements or incorporating the
&gt; improvements made by
&gt; others.  This is my issue.  And what I've said above is from
&gt; my perspective, I
&gt; understand the course Apple has taken to make a buck[1] (i.e.
&gt; they can't go
&gt; Intel, and they can't open-source, or else they'll lose money
&gt; through piracy -
&gt; cf the killing of the Mac-clones).
