<H1>Onboard SIS card not working with 7.2</H1>

Hi,

I have an onboard SIS 6354 card that worked okay (if not a bit slow)
under RedHat 7.0 
However when I upgraded to Redhat 7.2 X no longer works. X starts but
when you try and start anything which does something mildly graphically
intensive (such as starting Gnome or KDE) it locks the computer hard. I
have tried both the frame buffer XServer and a generic SVGA XServer
(Both from 3.3.6 as 4.0.X doesn't support this SIS card, although the
new 4.2.X does).  I have tried turning off all acceleration options and
similar features but to no avail.

Has anyone had experiances with these onboard cards? I have had problems
with them before on another computer but nothing that locks the computer
totally. (You can't even ssh into the computer to kill X).

Any help or resources would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Tim
