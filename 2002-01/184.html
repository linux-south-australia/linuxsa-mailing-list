Hi people,

I would like to set up my Mandrake 8.1 box to record the radio and mpeg 
compress it to set directories / dynamically updated filenames (by date) 
at set times - so for example I can record a show of Radio National at 
5am or whatever.

I figure I can plug a radio in the line in port on the soundcard and 
then pipe that to a mpeg compression application somehow although I have 
no idea how.

If anyone is aware of a project already started up for this I would be 
appreciative to be pointed in the right direction - or if anyone is able 
to help me I would be happy.  Even if someone would like to come around 
one day and I will shout some pizza / beer / etc to sit down and nut 
this and some other Linux things out I would be very appreciative.

It would be handy to extend this to a radio / tv card to record set 
programs - and just set up a monthly schedule.

Would it be one day possible to route this through voice recognition 
software to keep an eye out for interesting topics - say listening for 
'Afghanistan' on talk back radio or something - I jnow this is 
far-fetched but I thought I would ask anyhow.

I am about to re-commence studies at Flinders University in politics 
(international relations) and a tool like this would be immensely 
helpful.  Perhaps later we can develop it to a point where other 
students / universities would find such a tool to be useful also - 
another way to get Linux on the map.

Thanks in advance!!!
