&gt; &gt; KreateCD looks gorgeous; I've not seen it before. The only thing is that
&gt; &gt; it relies on cdrecord, which relies on SCSI, which, if you have an IDE
&gt; &gt; burner means that you have to rely on SCSI emulation, which is not
&gt; &gt; available under FreeBSD. [ Which... :-) ]
&gt; 
&gt; burncd is so much nicer than cdrecord and some SCSI kludge, don't you 
&gt; think? ;-)

Yes, it is. However, patching each program to work with burncd seems
like an unnecessary amount of work. If you can create a kernel-level
IDE-SCSI interface that works with cdrecord, you've immediately opened
up the number of options that people with IDE CD-R drives have when
choosing a CD burning application.

&gt; &gt; I doubt that there would be much hacking required to make KreateCD work,
&gt; &gt; but I don't believe that making individual application changes is the
&gt; &gt; right way to address the issue. Someone with developer-level knowledge
&gt; &gt; of the FreeBSD kernel (ie, not me!) needs to write some SCSI emulation
&gt; &gt; code.
&gt; 
&gt; Why not suggest a burncd patch to KreateCD?  IIRC, its command line 
&gt; parameters are very simple.

Yes, they are, but that's not the issue here. A common interface to CD-R
drives, whether they be IDE or SCSI needs to be available to developers.

Seeing as cdrecord appears to have become the defacto standard interface
between the GUI and the drive itself, it seems to make sense to me that
you'd go along with what's already being used.

It takes the responsibility away from the application developers. They
then only have to interface with one application, not one or two for
each operating system.

cdrecord works on everything from BSD, to SunOS, to AIX, even on
Windows. It makes sense to use that.
