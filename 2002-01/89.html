&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Im not new to linux, but am deciding to return to the os from windows xp! I am tossing up between Redhat and Mandrake.  Any suggestions on which one is best?

&gt; 
&gt; To get up and running in a short length of time: Mandrake.
&gt; 
&gt; For longer term stability and maintainability: Debian.

Hey, that's not fair - he was tossing up between Mandrake and Redhat. 
This is the kind of question that can incite wars (could be fun to watch
another though).

The answer depends on what you want.  If you want to use KDE and a lot
of the windoze users at work much prefer KDE, then Mandrake is the way
to go (poor buggers have to suffer with Redhat cos that's what I support
though *evil grin*).  However, I've been using Redhat since 5.0 and I'm
more used to it's, hmmmmmmm, eccentricities (and prefer gnome as well
because it just happenned to be the option you got when doing the
install).

At the end of the day though, my suggestion is to use the distribution
that your friends use.  Friends are always the best source of assistance
with difficulties.  Although, I'm moving towards the opinion that a
Linux From Scratch is very much the way to go these days for longer term
stability and maintainability.  There is nothing difficult about
installing from source and you get exactly what you want far more
quickly and easily (and I'm finding it easier to upgrade packages from
source than rpm)...

Cheers from firey Sydney!
