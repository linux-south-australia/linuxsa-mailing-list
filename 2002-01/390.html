&gt;Multisession is a property of the underlying cdrecord program that

&gt;
&gt;There's lots of issues with recording multisession CDs.  IF you really
&gt;need to do it, does VMware work for burning CDs? Otherwise you'll still
&gt;need to dual boot (damn).

I have had reasonable success with this under VMware 3, with NT4 as the
guest OS.  I don't think VMware supports CD burners directly yet, but it
does support raw SCSI device access, and my burner is SCSI.  I set it up
as a raw device in VMware using /dev/sg0 (in my case).  I think I also
had to install a SCSI driver on NT - instructions are on the VMware web
site - I can probably dig up more info if it's hard to find.

I got it showing up as a CD under NT, and set up Easy CD Creator to use
the SCSI device.  I mount my Linux home directory as an NT SMB share, and
back up files that way. All works pretty nicely, except for a couple of things:

1. It doesn't seem to want to write very large files - say &gt; 150MB.  When
writing large files, the FIFO percentage full starts to drop.  Seems that
the larger the file, the further it drops.  I wrote a 100MB file ok, and
it dropped to around 50-60% temporarily.  I suspect some sort of resource
starvation - maybe when VMware does disk reads nothing else gets a look in.

2. I have found VMware raw SCSI support to be a little flakey.  Once VMware
gets its hands on the device, it's difficult to free it up for Linux use again.
Disconnecting it in VMware doesn't seem to work normally.  Closing down VMware
fully often fixes it.  I have had one or two full system hangs whilst messing
with it.  For the moment I'm just relegating the writer to NT semi-permanently.

Oh and of course because Win is case-insensitive, if you try and back up two
files in the same directory with the same name but different case (Linux kernel
sources have some if I remember correctly), you'll get only one (and a dialog
box about it).  One solution is to tar up the files first, though it's a bit
of a pain getting just one file back.


I haven't been doing this for a long time, but things seem to be ok so far.
The multi-session CDs seem to be readable OK under Linux (RedHat-ish system,
2.2.17 kernel), with all sessions presented as one view.  (Only small problem
seems to be an NT bug which stops a new session being seen by the filesystem 
under NT after it has been written.  Not sure if there's another solution 
other than rebooting NT.  Don't think Linux has this problem.)

Hope this helps

Cheers
