I'm scratching my head here. There is very little that depends on 
static IP addresses in the modern world. The Internet runs on the 
DNS, not on static IP associations. People don't find your web site 
by IP address in the modern world.

One just plans the move via a careful sequence of DNS entry changes 
and its all seamless (lower the DNS TTL the day before; Bring up the 
new IP's; Change the DNS entries; Raise the DNS TTL again once the 
move is verified to be clean and ok).

All decent ISP's can do this for their customers. The only 
organisations that consistently seem to botch such moves are banks 
(they must think they know better). Not one, but multiple banks have 
botched a change of ISP's (and then tried to blame ISP's for their 
lack of appreciation of how the DNS works, and their choice not to 
hire someone with nous to manage the move).

Other than that, ISP moves/adds/changes are coordinated and executed 
daily all over the world with nobody being adversely affected, when 
they're done right - whether that's for one IP address range or lots. 
Even lots of globally routed IP's can be ported cleanly by using a 
good NAT gateway (which allows a customer to do an ISP change and 
then gradually move their IP's over later if that works better for 
them than a snap change).

Anyway, Michael, you seem to be saying below that on the one hand 
moving is easy, but on the other hand for you personally its hard, 
for some unspecified reason. You've asked my company to make you an 
offer. No sweat, drop me a line privately and explain what sort of 
offer you need. Cos I just can't work it out from your public post 
(maybe that's just because its late and I'm tired... :) )

Regards,
Simon

&gt;re-routing is such a trivial thing these days, as long as you get on to the
&gt;correct people and pre-plan, switching ISP's with your own public IP's
&gt;should be a non-event.
&gt;
&gt;Oh, sorry, I guess a lot of people rely on their ISP's static IP addresses.
&gt;Hmm, that would cause concern.
&gt;
&gt;C'mon Internode - offer me something - anything - away from Tel$tra....

&gt;
&gt;I too have been with BPD for serval years and found them to very reliable
&gt;and professional.
&gt;The point that needs to be made hear is that as every ISP sales person
&gt;knows, once you have setup a client with their permanent connection, fix ip
&gt;on the email server etc. They are not going to move unless there is a very
&gt;good reason. I have one client that has a 2 meg link into Internode and has
&gt;a  large number of public ip no.s. To move this customer to another ISP
&gt;would involve a considerable amount of work and stress as the customer can't
&gt;stand being down for more then about 30sec.
&gt;
&gt;The point here is that most business customers will tend to stay with the
&gt;ISP they started with unless something very bad happens.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;That's been my experience, too.  I've been a BPD customer for 4½ years
&gt;&gt;  &gt;now, and they've been professional, but they weren't overly cheap when
&gt;&gt;  &gt;I started, and since then their prices have gone *up*, while
&gt;&gt;  &gt;everywhere else in the world they've gone down.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  So why do you stay with them?
