Anyone who has used M$ products like Word and Excel for any length of time 
would have found that as M$ adds features it changes the applications in 
ways that make them less friendly. Excel used to have some really nice 
charting features that disappeared when Office 95 came out. I have had Word 
repeatedly stuff up the formatting of its own document, crash when trying 
to print documents with simple images in them and chew up all the available 
disc space by demanding more memory and causing the OS to create a huge 
(virtual memory) swap file (over 1GB) whne editing files of 20-30K. Also 
try using some of the advanced features like master document and find out 
how difficult it is to manage consistent formats across all sub-documents 
if you don't edit only through the master document. Nice feature but very 
frustrating to use.

Of course it is easy to overlook the price of applications when comparing 
operability and features when you are not paying for them. I have for a 
number of years been trying to migrate to Linux but have found that a 
number of applications I use do not have any equivalents available in 
Linux. I have looked at Wine but have not have any success in running 
anything but the simples programmes. I must agree however that Linux will 
only start to displace M$ windows as a desktop OS when it can run a 
majority of the M$ applications with relative ease.

&gt;I've watched Linux/FreeBSD zealots in my office tell me that for years, 
&gt;and one by one they've all given up and gone over to Windows PC's in 
&gt;disgust at not being able to properly deal with Word and Excel files from 
&gt;the rest of the world, there is -always- a file that it botches, or that 
&gt;crashes it, or that it doesn't render right - eventually it just grinds 
&gt;you down to giving up. Or at least, it grinds -them- down.
&gt;
&gt;I don't care because my operating system is unix that -does- run MS office 
&gt;as well...
