 Subject: Requirements for NAT?


 &gt; Hi,
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm thinking of signing up for Telstras ADSL service.
 &gt;
 &gt; I would want to connect this to my local lan to allow all computers in
 &gt; my house access to the net. I would like to run a linux NAT gateway and
 &gt; firewall, i currently have a similar system with my modem. The NAT
 &gt; gateway is currently an old 486-DX100 with 8mb of ram and realtek

 need more RAM than that lets say 32mb if the box can take it. 64mb would be
 better.
 oh an a better quality and faster card than a realtek would lower the cpu
 overhead.

 &gt; network card, it handels the load of the modem without breaking a sweat.
 &gt; Would this computer be able to handle the 40/50k a second that ADSL
 &gt; provides?
 just doing nat yes, but with the service listed below no.
 &gt;
 &gt; As well i'm worried about the 3 gig cap, i'm afraid that i'll end up
 &gt; with a huge bill for meg passed this cap. Can anyone recommend good
 &gt; software to make sure that the cap isn't passed?

 oh to provent you going past the cap limit i recommend using a local name
 server and a proxy cache like squid
 so pages that are visted frequently are held locally ( eg pages like google
 and yahoo).
 A better computer would be recommend for these services somthing like a
p200
 and it would need at least 64mb of ram.
 an fast hard disk, or some standard disks on a cheap raid card in raid 0
 config.
 RAM is cheap and I sure you can get hold of a cheap p200 system at your
 local tech recycling centre.
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks for your help.

 &gt; PS Has anyone does Telstra's "Self Insterlation" option?
 &gt; PSS Has anyone got evolutions spell checker working and can give me a
 &gt; quick hint? There are like 500 refrences on the mailing list and none
 &gt; seem to work :(
