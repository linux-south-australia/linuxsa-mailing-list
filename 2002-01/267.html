yep, XP is rather rude.  i have XP on my machine and i was playing with
TinyPersonalFirewall and everytime i do a search of my hard drive it sends a
packet to:
'Windows Explorer' from your computer wants to connect to sa.windows.com
[207.46.226.40], port 80
c:\windows\explorer.exe...

in my opinion this is very rude.  what business is it of theirs what i
search for on my hard drive?  i might add that XP search doesn't even work.
useless.  one of these days when i get round to it, i'll install a packet
sniffer on it and see what they're sending...  very rude.

&gt; &gt; On an Aside, there were australian federal police poking around
&gt; outside
&gt; &gt; my place around at 3am the other morning... Associated?
&gt;
&gt; Just trying to figure if this is serious... really?  Were they
&gt; snooping
&gt; at your place or just in the general area?

I live on a second story apartment in the city, my flat mate asked then
who they were and what they were doing. He saw thier badges, and they
said they were afp. They were looking for the woman next door...

Anyway.. OT.

&gt;
&gt; Although anyone that uses a GPG sig at the bottom of their emails is
&gt; bound to attract attention from the feds after Sep11.  Damn, you might
&gt; be sending encrypted email to terrorists.

mabey, then again mabey not...

&lt;/message&gt;
