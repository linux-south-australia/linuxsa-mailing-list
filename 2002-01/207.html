Hi There,
    In answer to the first part of your query, in my
experience, the PCI standard has been around for more than
long enough so that all of the interface problems should be
gone by now. This is more than true with the serial standard
that has been around for maybe 40 years? I usually just buy
a vanilla 2 port serial card and it should just work. Brand
shouldn't be an issue. Dick Smith has suitable ones on the
shelf (but they are a little expensive - as much as $30
maybe). I have installed a few hundred Serial port cards
over the years, and as long as the jumpers are set correctly
(factory defaults don't always work) you will not have too
many problems. Hope this has helped.
    Cheers!
        Andrew.

Subject: Serial port cards + MS outlook-like software


&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Two questions.  Firstly, I need an extra serial port on my
PC, which was
&gt; generously endowed with but one.  Many people sell
dual-port PCI serial
&gt; cards for a reasonable sum, but can't tell me the make
except by ordering
&gt; one in(!).  Does anyone know where I can get a
known-to-be-linux-compatible
&gt; PCI serial card?
&gt;
&gt; Secondly, a client has around 10 PCs running Win 95, and
wants to be able
&gt; to share address books and calendar information amongst
staff (and sync with
&gt; palm pilots, to boot!) without paying Microsoft $x,000 for
Outlook and
&gt; Exchange.  Does anyone happen to know of a reasonable
replacement with clients
&gt; for Win95.  Server can run on anything but preferably
Linux.  Open source
&gt; preferable.  Evolution and Bynari Insight Server seem to
be Linux-only.
&gt; Do people with mixed Linux/Win desktops use Outlook for
Win clients and
&gt; Exchange for the server?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt;
&gt;   -Matthew
