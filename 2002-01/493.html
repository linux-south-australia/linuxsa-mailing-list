<H1>[OT] Telstra ADSL Price Increase</H1>

Normally i wouldn't post an off topic email like this, but many users
here seems to be intrested in ADSL.

If you havn't heard telstra are increasing their prices for BigPond
BoardBand internet service. The price increase can be found at 

<A HREF="http://www.bigpond.com/PressRelease/bbADSL/">http://www.bigpond.com/PressRelease/bbADSL/</A>

Sadly Telstra is the only viable solution for ADSL in Adeliade.
Internode are the only other company (that I know of) that offers ADSL
despite there service been vastly superior, it is also vastly more
expensive. For example,

With Telstra, 3gig Freedom Deluxe Plan
$94.95 (with preselection) for 512/128 and 3 gig a month

That works out to be about $0.031 a MB.

With Internode, ADSL - 512k BRONZE plan
$100 for 512/128 and 500mb a month

That works out to be $0.20 a MB

Which means that Internode are over 6 times more expensive per MB! I
find it hard to justify improved survice for that kind of increase in
price.


If we lived on the west coast these services would be avalible,

<A HREF="http://www.xis.com.au/adsl.html,">http://www.xis.com.au/adsl.html,</A> XiS MEGAwatt ADSL
$99.00 for 512/128 and 3 gig peak, 6 gig off peak a month

That works out to be about $0.011 a MB

<A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/four/products/adsl/home/plans.shtml,">http://www.netspace.net.au/four/products/adsl/home/plans.shtml,</A> Home
Broadband 512
$99.95 for 512/128 and 3 gig peak, 6 gig off peak a month

That works out to be about $0.011 a MB


Both these services offer much better value than ADSL avalible in
Adelaide. Kinda wants to make you move.


Anyway i've had my complain about ADSL services avalible in Adelaide.
Looks like i'm going to have to stick with Telstra despite there price
increase :(
