         Important message to Telstra BigPond broadband Cable customers

Dear Telstra BigPond(TM) broadband member,

Telstra has further reviewed its high speed Internet plans following
changes
introduced in December 2001 and we are making additional changes.  We
will
be introducing five  new plans to replace the existing plans, commencing
on
1 March 2002 and believe that these plans will provide the majority of
our
customers with the opportunity to save on their monthly bill.


&gt;&gt; More flexibility and choice may lead to lower prices

These plans will be referable to usage levels and we believe they will
enable customers to better match the plan they choose with their usage
patterns. The new plans will have the following monthly usage allowance
-
300MB, 1GB, 3GB, 5GB and 10GB.  (Please note that the 5GB and 10GB plans

were introduced to Residential customers on 1 Dec 2001)

As part of these changes your Cable Freedom plan will be replaced with
the
new 3GB plan which has a monthly charge of $87.95* and an excess usage
charge of 13.9c per MB, once you have reached the monthly usage
allowance of
3GB.+

The majority of our customers use less than 1GB per month, and these
customers may receive even cheaper prices on one of our other new Cable
plans such as the 300MB at just $54.95* per month, once connected or our
1GB
plan at $64.95* per month, once connected.  Of course the Cable plan
that
best suits your needs will depend on your individual usage requirements.

The changes being introduced include:

- an 'entry-level' Cable plan priced at less than $60 month, once
connected
- the same plans being offered to residential and business customers
alike;
- lower additional usage charges
- withdrawal of discounts to customers who come out of contract.

Details of the new Cable plans are available at:
www.bigpond.com/broadband/newplans

To help determine the best plan to suit your needs you can estimate your

past usage pattern by visiting the Usage Meter through Telstra BigPond
broadband Account Management function at:
https://bcoba-server.bigpond.net.au:8443/rhwc/smu


&gt;&gt; How do I choose a new plan?

The introduction of the changes will mean you can  choose one of the new

plans or if you are happy with the 3GB plan no further action is
required.
On 1 March 2002, you will automatically be moved to this plan.

If you do wish to choose another plan you must do so by midnight 15
February
2002.  You will be automatically moved to the 3GB plan that you have
selected on 1 March 2002.  To select another plan, or to find out more
about
the 3GB plan, please visit:
www.bigpond.com/broadband/newplans.

If you do not accept these changes you may cancel your Telstra BigPond
broadband service without penalty by contacting Telstra before midnight
14
February 2002.  Details of the cancellation process can be found at:
www.bigpond.com/broadband/newplans.
