Hey Andrew,

Keep looking.  This is exactly what you want.  Most recent external
modems have the capability to send arbitrary sound (eg voice) down a
connected phone line.

Read the bit in the vm stuff about digital answering machines.  This is
pretty much what answering machines do ("I'm sorry we are not
available...").

The bit you want is the "-d" or "-t" option to vm, I think.

I've had this working with a DLink DFM-560E modem as a digital
answering/fax machine.

&gt; There's the incredibly easy, and as you'd expect, incredibly *BORING*
&gt; Gnokii/5110 combination which will SMS me if something breaks, or, the
&gt; setup that I'd prefer, a voice call to my cell phone if something
&gt; breaks!
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen various HOWTOs on the Inter-web describing the steps you'd
&gt; take to setup a system that'd talk to you through speakers in your
&gt; server room when something stopped working, but that'd not be much use
&gt; if you're out of your server room (as you are most of the time).
&gt; 
&gt; I've had a look at the vm utility that comes with mgetty+sendfax. It's
&gt; part of the voice suite that mgetty+sendfax has.
&gt; 
&gt; I've got a sound file (in RMD[1] format) that I can play out to the
&gt; modem's sound-out plug, but I want to play it to a phone call. vm will
&gt; dial a number (vm dial number), but I can't figure out how to make it
&gt; play music or a prerecorded message once it has connected.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have any experience in setting this up? I've not yet taken
&gt; this to the mgetty lists, as I was hoping that someone local may be
&gt; able to help with the problem first.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure it's possible. I just hope that I don't have to result to
&gt; text messaging :-) Then again, I can live with text messaging if I
&gt; have to.
