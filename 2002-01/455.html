Hi,

yes, having an ISP that blocks known open relays is a good method.

Having postfix or whatever your MTA is, check for open relays before
accepting email, is a similar thing, only more time consuming. Although if
you build up a "whitelist" of known-good sources it'd be ok.
I think Anthony mentioned that method to me.. can't remember the details,
but although it seems crazy to start with, after a while it makes sense..
its probably the only way to avoid spam that will actually work all the
time.

As for ricochet, you can configure it in various different ways -- i'm sure
you can get it to always post a copy of the spam source details to spamcop
or whatever.. Let us know how you go!

&gt; Here's what I have in place:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Select an ISP that uses the spam "Blacklist", that way you don't
&gt; even have to download the rubbish.
&gt; 2. For posting to usenet (the internet news system), I have my reader
&gt; set to a bogus reply address. VERY IMPORTANT - a major source of spam.
&gt; 3. For surfing the net, I have given netscape a bogus username plus I
&gt; use an account on my machine that does not match anything at my ISP.
&gt; 4. Subscribe only to trustable mailing lists.
&gt; 5. Where I subscribe to a less than trustworthy mailing list, I'm
&gt; using one of the free e-mail aliases provided by my ISP, if that were
&gt; to fall into the hands of the spammers, I would just blow it away and
&gt; subscribe again with a new one.
&gt;
&gt; ... and some observations
&gt; I get very few spams, perhaps one per month. Its not clear which of
&gt; the above is working but I suspect that it is the first item. If so, I
&gt; will never know to what extent the remaining strategies contribute.
&gt; So far, I haven't had to use item number 5.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks Toby, I like the sound of ricochet (no pun intended). As my
&gt; strategy appears to work due to the blacklist system, I feel that I
&gt; should contribute to keeping the list up to date.  Would ricochet do
&gt; that?
