| Seagate, Fujitsu and IBM have all provided me with long life and few
| problems. Maxtor and WD have given me many more problems, so I avoid them
| now. Samsung, well, i dunno. I haven't tried buying one to find out.

I can confirm this.   Seagate/Fujitsu/IBM are great drives.. Seagate drives
used to be a bit flaky a few years back but they've certainly been great
lately.  Maxtor are f***ing horrible drives though, run, and run far from
them.  They'll give you a _lot_ of problems.  Western Digital used to be
really great, 2 years or so ago I'd use nothing but them, but lately their
drives are pretty horrible.  And Samsung, they're as bad as Maxtor.  Cheap,
and as it usually goes, nasty.  Personally my current favourite are IBM -
I'm running four 40gig 7200rpm drives in my main box, and have had
absolutely no problems - which is pretty amazing, considering how hot they
used to get before I had to install some fans (cpu was overheating... heh
heh).

Also : If your motherboard is only capable of ATA/66 speeds, don't bother
getting a 7200rpm drive - you wont notice much benefit at all from a 5400rpm
drive.   However, if you're planning on upgrading your machine and keeping
the hard drive though, you may as well buy the faster drive.  On ATA/100
boards, you will notice the difference.

(Funny thing is, Seagate/Fujitsu/IBM are usually the cheapest drives on the
market.)
