Subject: Re: Requirements for NAT?


&gt; For what its worth, a few years ago I setup a linux gateway for some
&gt; people that was:
&gt; * file serving
&gt; * dialling up via 56k modem
&gt; * providing NAT and firewalling
&gt; * providing DNS and nmbd services to local machines
&gt; * providing web interface for configuration and dialup/hangup
&gt;
&gt; This was running on a 386sx-16 with 4 Mb of ram.
&gt;
&gt; It worked fine, and could happily shuttle packets around to suit a 56k
&gt; modem. File serving wasn't terribly fast, but for small files it was fine.
&gt;
&gt; Ye olde 386 power :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; I would want to connect this to my local lan to allow all computers
in
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; my house access to the net. I would like to run a linux NAT gateway
and
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; firewall, i currently have a similar system with my modem. The NAT
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; gateway is currently an old 486-DX100 with 8mb of ram and realtek
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  need more RAM than that lets say 32mb if the box can take it. 64mb
would be
&gt; &gt; &gt;  better.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  oh an a better quality and faster card than a realtek would lower the
cpu
&gt; &gt; &gt;  overhead.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; That's not necessary. The specifications that Tim has listed should be
&gt; &gt; quite sufficient if it's just acting as a NAT gateway.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; As well i'm worried about the 3 gig cap, i'm afraid that i'll end
up
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; with a huge bill for meg passed this cap. Can anyone recommend good
&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt; software to make sure that the cap isn't passed?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  oh to provent you going past the cap limit i recommend using a local
name
&gt; &gt; &gt;  server and a proxy cache like squid
&gt; &gt; &gt;  so pages that are visted frequently are held locally ( eg pages like
google
&gt; &gt; &gt;  and yahoo).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, that's going to help, but it doesn't prevent you passing your
&gt; &gt; cap. It simply reduces the amount of HTTP traffic that you use.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  A better computer would be recommend for these services somthing like
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; p200
&gt; &gt; &gt;  and it would need at least 64mb of ram.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; A faster processor is not necessary. The RAM would be needed (half
&gt; &gt; that would be sufficient for home) if you want to start caching.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  an fast hard disk, or some standard disks on a cheap raid card in
raid 0
&gt; &gt; &gt;  config.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Again, that's not needed. A 100MHz machine is quite enough.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;  RAM is cheap and I sure you can get hold of a cheap p200 system at
your
&gt; &gt; &gt;  local tech recycling centre.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; RAM is not cheap for machines of this vintage.
