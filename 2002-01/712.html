&gt;I thought that's why you'd use 1900 numbers...

&gt;a customer over the phone as they're trying to report a problem)
&gt;or does that have the same TIO-related problems for the ISP?

If 1900 support available from various ISP's today is anything to go by, it
would appear that additional cost for support is inversely proportional to
the quality of the service.

Dove in Adelaide once tried doing 1900 support, then it became a generic
Internet support line, then it dissappeared. I'm guessing that they weren't
overwhelmed with calls.

Churn is also a big issue for ISP's. If you're charging for support, then
chances are that a customer won't ring you if they have a problem, they just
take their business elsewhere. This can lead to more complaints to the TIO,
especially where contracts are involved and a subscriber feels ripped off.
If there's a dispute or refund required for paid support, the telco still
gets to keep their percentage.

History also teaches us that cheap ISP's with minimal support can't go the
distance. ISP's that make a commitment to quality end up with less support
calls, and ISP's that pride themselves on support keep their customers.
