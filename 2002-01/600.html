&gt; If you have tried it and it's lacking something, I'm curious as to
&gt; what's missing. As I currently use it for home use (probably overkill)
&gt; but it's a way I can learn it for potential business use.

It's horrible for use as a home user - I use it as well to keep track of
how much money I'll have at the end of each month (damn credit cards).
I find that under Mandrake, GNUCash is horribly slow... it takes about
20 seconds to add a simple transaction to a register on my machine
(K6-III/400), 384M RAM.  It just shouldn't be that slow.

If I could find a good (free beer) alternative I'd use that. My needs
aren't great, and I dont' feel justified in spending money for software
that does what I could do (albeit, with more work) in a spreadsheet
anyway. That said, it's powerful - but I'm really only using it as a
glorified spreadsheet.

David, do you find GNUCash is as slow as I find it? Does anyone else
find it that slow?

&gt; ps. can import money and quicken files and has pretty extensive help
&gt; system for beginners. Extended online help is also available.

The help is OK - but it doesn't explain every option in enough detail.
Have you noticed it explains the simpler parts in good detail but the
more complex features get a paragraph, no more.  Looks like the help
system was written with accounting types in mind.

Cheers,
Adam
