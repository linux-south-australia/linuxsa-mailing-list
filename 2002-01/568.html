Hiya Ian,

The course sounds very altruistic of you. there may be some entry-level
IT courses available for accreditation I'm just not familiar with them.
I assume that when you say "young IT hopefuls", you mean
primary/highschool students?

I haven't got any IT teaching background (just finished a post-grad
Engineering degree myself), but if this was targeted for a bunch of
young-ish students I'd imagine the following would be a pretty good
intro to computer maintenance in general:

1. Open a box up and show the various major components and what they do.
Motherboard, CPU, power supply, memory, video board, NIC, and sound.
Illustrate that these are relatively interchangeable physically, and
mention the current standard buzzwords that allow all of this to work
together such as the AGP and IDE bus.

These days with hugely complicated PCBs (ie motherboards), other than
fixing a dry power supply fan, most hardware fixes are next to
impossible. So generally if something is broke, identify it the best you
can and replace it.

2. A Windows 98/2000/XP install run through would be good, just to
illustrate the process of sticking a working OS into the PC. If there is
time, explain Linux and go through a  Mandrake install (Mandrake is even
easier!). 

3. The majority of problems encountered on a home PC in my experience
have been mainly tied into something going wonky with the software. So
explain the concept of drivers and why different OS require specific
drivers for hardware. On a Windows box illustrate how replacing a video
board with a different may require a driver install. 

On a Linux machine, an up to date distribution generally requires no
additional drivers to be installed -- so installation is very easy. The
exception is unless you want to compile SRPMs for accelerated nVidia 3D
support, or something so new that you have to compile the C/C++ code it
yourself -- of course you may not want to go into this.

4. Netscape/Mozilla Composer is also free and easily available. You
might want to consider this. It's fully GUI driven, and while it doesn't
really compare to Macromedia Dreamweaver, you can create a page
graphically, flip over to see the HTML code, and flip back. Discuss how
a web site basically works, as a web server dishing out static pages.

5. Lastly, this may be a little off topic from the course. It may be
good to explain that technology changes extremely quickly and that
computing is exciting (well it is to me), and that PCs 5 years from now
will evolve, but that the same basic concepts will remain the same
regardless. 

Can you forward me some details on this upcoming course? Sounds
interesting.

Cheers,

&gt; Firstly, as this is not directly related to helping people with Linux I

&gt; My apologies for those that don't think this suits the List topics.

&gt; OK, as part of our Salisbury community project, coming in a couple of 
&gt; months I will be teaching a class of 10 young IT hopefuls something 
&gt; about Computer Maintenance. I will have them for 6 hours, 2 x 3 hour 
&gt; sessions, and in that time I hope I can give them enough knowledge that 
&gt; they wont be dangerous to themselves or others and might be able to 
&gt; handle the innards of a computer with some sort of respect.
&gt; 
&gt; I am open to any ideas on topics to cover, suggested activities, 
&gt; information for handouts etc.
&gt; 
&gt; I have enough old P166's and P200's to play with and I have a good 
&gt; technician mate to share the workload so it will be mostly a practical 
&gt; class activity. 
&gt; 
&gt; Should I be including how to load an OS? Linux? Win95?
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas? Any helpers?
&gt; 
&gt; I will also have another 6 hours to teach them about building web 
&gt; sites, just enough to get them started.
&gt; 
&gt; I was planning to use HomeSite 4.01 as the base program (as it was free 
&gt; on an APC cover) or do you think I should be using something else? What 
&gt; topics should I try to cover? Could I do this on our Linux machines? 
&gt; What program would be best for their level of knowledge?
&gt; 
&gt; My goal is for them to end up with a 1 or 2 page web site online 
&gt; somewhere. Suggestions for a free provider please.
&gt; 
&gt; Anybody that teaches this topic who would be prepared to donate 
&gt; material/time/support to the project? 
&gt; 
&gt; Are there any accredited short courses that I might be able to 
&gt; negotiate the rights to so that our participants actually get a piece 
&gt; of paper for their efforts?
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, in case you were wondering, no money is changing hands, the 
&gt; teaching is voluntary and they are getting the course for free.
&gt; 
&gt;  Cheers, Ian,
&gt;  from Salisbury, South Australia
