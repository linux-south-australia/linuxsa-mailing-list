&gt; Any suggestions on which one is best?

Stay away from RH lately.  They used to be (until about version 6) quite
good, but now they're somewhat the M$ of Linux distros.  Lots of crap
gets installed and started at bootup even if you ask it not to install
or start it == security problems.  That's how I got hacked.  A fresh
install of RH7.1 and it put portmapper on even though I asked not to
install portmapper.

That said however, RH seems to be on top of security holes in its RPMs.
Usually when they announce an exploit/bug/fix/whatever, there's an RPM
available for every RH distro, and they announce a lot of exploits/bugs.

I've just started using Mandrake 8 lately and it seems pretty good.  It
took some mangling to get it to install on my box because of the funny
partition setup I had to get Winsux98, Winblows2000, Linux, OS/Poo, and
a few other things on. On a simpler setup (winbites95/98/me and Linux)
with dual boot it's much simpler.

Mandrake gave warnings about what packages would require other
dependencies when I tried turning on packages, and it listed them.  I
had the chance to decide (based on what other packages were required) if
I really wanted/needed to install the packages I was selecting and all
their dependencies. 

What I REALLY liked about Mandrake is that it listed all the network
servers that would have been installed and provided an option to go back
and unselect certain ones.  After it installed there was an option to
select what jobs were started at bootup and also configure what services
were available through xinetd.

The RH update tool is better than the Mandrake one.  I find that the
mandrake tool is (for lack of a better word) ratshit.  It worked once
and now it crashes every time I start it.  And I can't install Ximian
Gnome via the Ximian automated install... the installer just segfaults.

I've tried Debian and I'll agree that it's more stable in the longer
term, easier to update (apt-get update), and generally harder to
install/configure (but more secure).  The thing I most liked with Debian
was it's minimalist approach.  It seemed quite schmick and fast to me,
whereas RedHat and Mandrake are quite slow in comparison - all my apps
seem like painful slugs.

If you have the time, Linux From Scratch is a great way to install
Linux.  You need an installed distro (any really, as long as there's a
compiler in it), and then you just go on and build all of the software
you want installed, as per the instructions until you're ready to reboot
to the system you just built.  There's additions to it for X and Gnome
and other stuff that you may decide that you need.  The beauty is you
know exactly what's installed, how it's configured and when it runs.
And you get to learn a lot about how Linux works.

'scuse the long reply, but I figured that seing as the question was
asked I'd provide some personal experiences as well - it's better than
just saying "install slackware because it's the best".  That said, my
personal experience is just that, and others may find their experiences
are better or worse than mine.

In conclusion: Use Mandrake.

Cheers,
Adam
