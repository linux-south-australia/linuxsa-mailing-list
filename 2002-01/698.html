&gt; &gt; The distinction between 'business' and 'residential' is actually at
&gt; &gt; once both harder and easier than the one you're making.  The 
&gt; &gt; distinction isn't arbitrary at all. Its very closely related to 
&gt; &gt; creating appealing residential plans that also don't bankrupt the 
&gt; &gt; providers of same. It has almost nothing, directly, to do with the 
&gt; &gt; cost of fixed IP addresses. Its more the reverse - its what a fixed 
&gt; &gt; IP address tends to say about the usage intentions of the customer 
&gt; &gt; and the resulting running costs for the customers' service.
&gt; 
&gt; Eh?  I don't get it. Providers seem to make a difference 
&gt; between Business 
&gt; and Non-Business since I was in the ISP game.  But ultimately 
&gt; it's really 
&gt; about being able to differential prices based on who can/will 
&gt; pay more as 
&gt; opposed to intentions (I've thought about this lots because I 
&gt; used to have 
&gt; to explain it to customers who didn't get it because it was 
&gt; arbitrary).

Yes -- and on the whole, people who want permanent IP's can/will pay
more for them... Often because of their intentions...

&gt; 
&gt; I run webservers which send out almost as much traffic as I 
&gt; receive.  I run 
&gt; a mail server for myself.  Does this really cost a different 
&gt; amount to 
&gt; service to someone who doesn't and who merely websurfs?  Not 
&gt; really.  It's 
&gt; IP packets.  You can't sell IP packets at a loss to 
&gt; residential or business.

Probably not, but then you, like many others on this list, are probably
not the average customer... Maybe there should be a third class of
accounts, so you have Residential (Ma & Pa), Business (lots of service),
and Geek (pure IP).

I wonder if that would be a good idea... The Residential account is
cheap, is aimed at people who surf and read email and don't think and
run windows and use dynamic IP's and don't know the difference anyway.
The Business account is for people who run businesses, need static IP,
want lots of handholding service and configuration, and are willing to
pay for it, and the Geek account is for people who want a static IP,
with Mb and no services, are willing to pay per incident for helpdesk if
they ever need it, in exchange for having a fairly cheap static IP
account.

Hmm...

Maybe I should do some work now...
