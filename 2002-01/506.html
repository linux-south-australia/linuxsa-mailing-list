"self-determination is irrelevant
performance and reliability is irrelevant
resistance is futile
you will be assimilated"

"they invade our diskspace, we fall back.,
they assimilate entire domains...
not again - the line must be drawn here!
this FUD, no further...
i will make them pay for what they've done."


(apologies to velvet acid christ.. although i don't think they can ever be
forgiven for having that ninety second "intro" to the song, thats just a big
star trek sample. sheesh.)

&gt; &gt; SEATTLE -- Microsoft is escalating its war against Linux, the free
&gt; &gt; operating system begun as a hobby of Internet dabblers but increasingly
&gt; &gt; the darling of bankers, retailers and Hollywood special effects wizards.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In a Dec. 26 memo leaked this week to technology Web site
&gt; &gt; theregister.uk.com,
&gt; &gt;   Microsoft Senior Vice President Brian Valentine urges his Windows
&gt; &gt; sales force to "modify" traditional approaches and "dig deeper" to
&gt; &gt; find out where companies are using Linux.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Valentine assures his troops they will soon get "independent" studies
&gt; &gt; and spreadsheet tools useful for obliterating "the perception that
&gt; &gt; Linux is free." Microsoft will probably try to show that Linux is
&gt; &gt; costly to maintain and service over the long term, experts say.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "We're working hard to debunk myths around Linux," he writes. "We'
&gt; &gt; re approaching this in waves."
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Microsoft declines to comment on Valentine's call to arms. The software
&gt; &gt; giant considers his rallying cry simply being proactive in the marketplace,
&gt; &gt;   says a source familiar with the matter. But the memo has been a hot
&gt; &gt; topic in industry circles, and some observers say it could ultimately
&gt; &gt; backfire.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Unlike others Microsoft has vanquished, Linux is more a grass-roots
&gt; &gt; religion than a vulnerable corporate target. While Microsoft jealously
&gt; &gt; guards its core software code, Linux code is open and continually
&gt; &gt; improved by thousands of top programmers around the world who believe
&gt; &gt; software should benefit society.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "The open source community may be one of the greatest volunteer movements
&gt; &gt; in history," says Matthew Szulik, CEO of Linux distributor Red Hat.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; IBM, Hewlett-Packard and others have begun bundling Linux into computer
&gt; &gt; hardware, while business software makers like Oracle and SAP, now
&gt; &gt; routinely fold it into their product lines. Microsoft accounts for
&gt; &gt; 42% of the server software shipped annually, compared with 27% for
&gt; &gt; Linux, according to IDC.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Last fall e-merchant Amazon.com converted most of its computer servers
&gt; &gt; to Linux in time to handle the holiday shopping season, and most of
&gt; &gt; the cutting-edge animation seen in Hollywood films is now processed
&gt; &gt; with Linux software.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Some think Microsoft should likewise embrace Linux. But Valentine'
&gt; &gt; s memo suggests Microsoft is resorting to old tactics at the risk
&gt; &gt; of giving Linux a bigger forum to tout its success stories, says Dan
&gt; &gt; Kusnetzky, an analyst with research firm IDC.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; "Microsoft is taking a combative approach because it has worked so
&gt; &gt; well in the past," Kusnetzky notes.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Microsoft's 92% monopoly of desktop operating systems remains untouchable,
&gt; &gt;   experts say. Ransom Love, CEO of Linux distributor Caldera International,
&gt; &gt;   speculates that Microsoft may have purposely leaked Valentine's memo
&gt; &gt; hoping to lighten scrutiny of antitrust regulators here and abroad.
&gt; &gt; "They have to play up competitive threats to ease pressures from
&gt; &gt; governments
&gt; &gt; around the world," Love says. "Microsoft uses whatever tactics it
&gt; &gt; takes to win . . . at all costs."
