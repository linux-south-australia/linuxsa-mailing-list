I can testify to the kernel in RH6 being unstable RE: networking.


We have a machine here playing MP3s, and if we pummell the network (like
resizing an xterm for constantly for 30 seconds) the player will die,
and in fact,the onvoard NIC has a very new driver which caused the
machine to kernel panic. A new NIC (DEC) and an old driver (etherwork3)
makes it more stable.

&gt; Just a general comment on the 2.2.x kernel & rh6.0
&gt; 
&gt; Kernel
&gt; ------
&gt; The 2.2.x kernel still has some bugs in it. They affect the following
&gt; areas:
&gt;         - networking
&gt;         - filesystem
&gt; 
&gt; The networking is not on the high priority list.
&gt; The filesystem is! The reason on some highlevel 64bit machines it can kill
&gt; the filesystem. Chances of this happening are VERY remote but it's being
&gt; fixed as we speak.
&gt; 
&gt; (Aren't you glad i386/486/586/686 are 32 bit not 64!)
&gt; 
&gt; Networking will be fixed later.
&gt; 
&gt; RH6.0
&gt; ------
&gt; Remeber redhat 6 uses egcs as a compiler. This is a C compiler that is
&gt; designed with optimisation for pentiums,686's,ppros and the like.
&gt; Even without optimisation on (no -O) this compiler is still NOT endorsed
&gt; as a stable compiler (talk about your kernel not working with egcs on
&gt; linux-kernel list and you'll get flamed). Hence since most of RH6 has been
&gt; compiled with egcs it isn't as stable.
&gt; 
&gt; I noticed this when I went from a stable 5.2 system running kernel 2.1.121
&gt; (which became 2.2.0) to rh 6. I used the same kernel, just recompiled it
&gt; in rh6. I noticed I was getting more sig 11 errors that day. (Overclocking
&gt; is not the cause. My P133 has been running at 188 for 3 years fine).
&gt; 
&gt; So just remeber next time you complain with rh6 that you system is
&gt; unstable it might be due to egcs.
&gt; 
&gt; Quote from /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes (kernel 2.3.11)
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------
&gt; 
&gt; "   Note that the latest compilers (egcs, pgcc, gcc 2.8) may do Bad
&gt; Things while compiling your kernel, particularly if absurd
&gt; optimizations (like -O9) are used.  Caveat emptor.  Currently, the only
&gt; C compiler available in a binary distribution is egcs.  Version 1.0.3
&gt; seems okay; if you have to have a binary, you may be successful using
&gt; that.  In general, however, gcc-2.7.2.3 is known to be stable, while
&gt; egcs and others have not been as thoroughly tested yet."
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
