&gt; &gt; Don't know for sure but I've used files of 200 Mb and more.  From memory
&gt; &gt; it was mentioned in the Mini-Howto.  It's a handy thing.
&gt; 
&gt; For that matter, I know I've has close to a gigabyte at times going to
&gt; the loop device.

	I've got about a gig and a half mounted at the moment...

&gt; So, if the filesystem you are mounting via the loop device has an upper
&gt; limit, then that would apply, of course.

	...As an encrypted FS. The FS (mounted via /dev/loop) is
	~68% full. However, as soon as I try and put more data onto the
	FS, I get "block not present" errors from the loop device. (And
	yes, I have fsck'ed the damn thing a couple of times now:
	no errors returned by fsck, only when I try and move files
	around in userland....)

&gt; And, if the file for the loop device resides on a normal partition, then
&gt; the file cannot exceed that size either. 

	Again, nope. The file is smaller (just) than the disk partition is
	sits on (smaller than the space allocated to users, too, not root).

	Given I'm not really looking forward to pawing through the loop
	code & FS extensions, I was hoping that it might be something
	easily fixed (like the size of the file)....

	Guess not :P
