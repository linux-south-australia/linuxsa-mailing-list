&gt;Must admit I was a bit disappointed that there's no removal of fingers for
&gt;improper use of the keyboard or more severe penalties for malicious
&gt;hacking....... but I spose you can't have [every]thing......

(You can't have everything. Where would you put it? - Steven Wright)

&gt; Really, the "policy" (if enforcable/enforced)
&gt; may well make some ppl THINK b4 trashing a system or
&gt; junkmailing etc etc!!
&gt;
&gt;I suppose I am being cynical...but.. having spent part of the day involved
in
&gt;cleaning up the mess left by what appears to be a DoS attack on our mail
&gt;server/network... I really dont see a lot wrong with Oman's Internet Usage
&gt;policy other than the lack of castration/decapitation etc for slightly less
&gt;trivial offences!


I was afraid someone might actually *like* some point of their rules... ;(

&gt;Being serious, Censorship is really quiite different to "rigid
enforcement"of
&gt;a  code of acceptable behaviour!!  I did actually check out GTO's site on
the
&gt;offchance they had some reference  to censorship but couldn't find
anything!!
&gt;I wonder if they do really cut people off???


You're at a safe distance here... why net send them a nice, diplomatic
e-mail about it (e.g. saying that you're interested in comparing our new
legislation to theirs... ask for statistics on the number "reprimanded"...
;)
