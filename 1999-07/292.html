Okay, here's a problem I just can't figure out.
Ever since last thursday my soundcard has been running at a sort of
halfspeed, or quarter speed. Everything plays fine, except at an
amazingly slow rate, and low pitch. Imagine a walkman when the batteries
are flat, only worse.
I can't figure out what is causing this - I've tried warm boots, cold
boots, all manner of different options, different kernel drivers, eSD
verses direct OSS, etc. but nothing changes - if the soundcard works, it
works at this slow rate.
The soundcard was working perfectly for about 6 months prior to this,
it's a builtin ESS 1869, and it's never been a problem before. I can't
think what happened to start this perculiar behaviour, but I know I
plugged an external serial modem in on the same day that I noticed it.
Only thing is, I plugged the modem in at night, and the problem had
showed up by lunchtime, so that rules it out. Other than that, I don't
think I did anything..THe machine hadn't been rebooted for a couple of
weeks, so the first thing i did was reboot, but that didn't solve the
problem.

I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had this occur, and what
they did to fix it? Or, has anyone got any ideas about where to look or
what to do?
Everything I look at looks exactly the same as it did before, and I
can't recall doing anything to start this behaviour. I guess there's a
slight possibility the soundcard has exploded internally, but that's
pretty extreme!

Help,
Toby
