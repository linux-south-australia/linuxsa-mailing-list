Jo!

&gt; Thanks a lot! :-) Now I know where the problem is. It is the root partition that is full.
&gt; 
&gt; Filesystem      1k blocks       Used    Available       Use%    Mounted On
&gt; /dev/hda5       248847          248847            0             100%    /
&gt; 
&gt;  Do you hava any idea on how I can extend it?
&gt; 

Check your /tmp and /var/tmp and /var/spool sections. Type "dd" to find
out specific file usage (eg dd caplonk will tell you how large the file
called caplonk is).

It is normally safe to delete everything in /tmp and /var/tmp.

Do a find -name core and remove them. "find -name core exec rm -rf '{}
\;" will remove all core files automatically, although you'd best check
the manual to understand exactly what I'm telling you.

core files are hexadecimal dumps when programs or something else
unexpectedly exits. They are certainly not essential but good if you can
work out how to use them for debugging purposes.

You probably have a smaller root (/) partition. I don't use my root
partition as the partition to store tmp files of the /tmp or /var/tmp
type. They can become very large and create problems such as yours if
they can't expand.

I make a symbolic link to the /usr/tmp file (which is obviously on my
/usr and largest partition). I did this by typing from the root (/)
directory, "ln -s /usr/tmp /tmp" or something like that. Unfortunately I
always make errors when creating links, just play around with the format
of the parameters until when you "cd" into /tmp and /var/tmp as the case
might be, it's the one actually located at /usr/tmp.

Easiest way to do this it to "cd /tmp" then "touch FROM_TMP" and then
"cd /usr/tmp" and "ls" to see if it's appeared.

This could solve your glitches...

DAVID.
