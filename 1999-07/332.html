It's amazing they don't do here what they do in the states. Some stores are
required by law to report any/all orders where certain chemicals are bought
together, ie

if x,y,z are bought then notify police immediately. Of course this is
usually done by the computer for them.

Whilst this may seem big brotherish to some (I even agree to a point), at
least it doesn't slow down the service, and may actually stop you
(figurative) from making bombs.

Then again, as long as they are hurting themselves, at least they aren't
hurting other innocents, not the least bit interesting in making bombs. I
know this is cynical, but hey...

Oh well...

Rob.

&gt;&gt; In a similar vein to this topic.... noted with interest the way the media
is playing up the ppl who blew themselves up with
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; home made bombs built from plans obtained from the internet. Whilst I
have nothing but sympathy for the victims & their
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; families, I cannot believe that the INTERNET is being blamed for this
tragedy!! Heard some anti-internet comments already
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; from some pollies abt it!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; When I was abt 12 I made some really cool home made explosives - blew up
the doghouse with them (no , the dog wasnt in it!)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The internet was not around then.... I got the plans from books I
borrowed from the Public Library!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Perhaps we should ask the pollies to also ban books!!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;The difference is that books are usually screened before a library puts
&gt;them on loan although that one is a bit odd.  Depends how long ago you
&gt;were 12.  Things like this were less of a concern years ago to the point
&gt;where a guy I know who is now in his sixties could, as a 12 year old,
&gt;walk into the local explosives store in Broken Hill with his friends and
&gt;buy gelignite, 25 feet of fuse and a box of detonators.  They would make
&gt;bangalor torpedoes and go and blow the crap out of the local rubbish
&gt;dump.  The trouble with the internet is that any bastard can put up any
&gt;recipes which are of dubious quality and sometimes some that are
&gt;designed to explode in the face of the maker.  The internet is the only
&gt;way that type of info can be accessed easily by many.  The question
&gt;about porn affecting children is one thing, getting themselves blown up
&gt;is getting a bit more serious.  The only way to deal with this without
&gt;the crap being proposed is to have international co-operation and
&gt;sensible censorship rules.  Now if you think that wouldn't be a circus.
