Wow...  I'm overwhelmed by the generous responses to my request
for info about how to go about creating a genuine nerd
computer in Adelaide. It will take me 24-48 hours to make sense
of it all. But I think I'll end up making 2 or 3 computers now -
1 big one and 1 or 2 small ones (maybe I'll even put BSD on one!).

As soon as I've digested all of this info, I'll write up a
web page summarizing it all, and post the URL back to the list.

Right now, though, it looks like there _are_ one or more
places in Adelaide that can make good computers to order
which one would not be ashamed to put linux on, and also
that there are mail-order routes for getting stuff over the web.

There are some things that I just wouldn't want to
get through the post though, like a monitor.
I don't think monitors are even consistent within a single
production line. Precision of focus could vary from
unit to unit, I think. And those 0.25, 0.26, 0.27 numbers
don't seem to tell the whole story.

So I'm starting to think that certain basic things should
be bought locally in person, like the case, the monitor,
and the things which are so cheap that the price doesn't
matter.

Anyway, as I say, I'll summarize and post back to the list.
With about 10 offers of info, this won't be in the next couple 
of hours though.

Cheers, and thanks for all the fish,
Alan Kennington.
