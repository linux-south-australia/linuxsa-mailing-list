Hi All,

Total newbie here, in fact I am still surrounded by the shell fragments.

I have RedHat 5.2 (Linux for Dummies) but I'm having problems getting XFree
to configure. My System is SiS6236 motherboard with on-board Video and
sound.  The only information about the graphics is:-

Built in high performance 64bit 3D AGP Graphics
Acceleratorwith 8MB frame buffer.

I've RTFM but have been unable to extract any detail to produce a workable
XF86Config.  I have tried many permutations and combination of parameters
in Xconfigurator and edited the resulting config file every which way but
with no luck.

I have surfed far and wide on the net but only found questions - no
answers; most likely because I am also a Net newbie and am not looking in
the right places.  There are many reviews extolling the excellence of the
Sis graphics but of course they all refere to it's performance under "that
other OS" which I can confirm - it gives very good results under W98.

The only advice I have so far is via Packet radio to disable the on board
graphics and use a known plug in adapter.  Seems a pity to not use the
in-built hardware besides having to unzip the hip pocket.


Can any of you kind gentlemen point me in the right direction as to where
to look or how to proceed.
