A reply to an inquiry about a US-based
Scout's Youth UNIX Mentoring program

It mentions an on-line UNIX course, et al.
that could be of interest to new-comers.

Compare their apples to our oranges... ;)

&gt;&gt; Your UNIX Youth Mentoring program is fascinating!
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Would your tests be on-line and/or available (e.g.
&gt;&gt; by return e-mail attachment), so that others might
&gt;&gt; see how theirs compare to yours?
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, it is not.
&gt; The test is given once a year,
&gt; twice if there is sufficient growth in membership
&gt; [enough to start a new class].
&gt;
&gt; The goal is to test knowledge and not memory.
&gt;
&gt; We do not want the youth to study the test,
&gt; we want them to study UNIX:-)
&gt;
&gt; There are 100 questions, 3 points each.
&gt;
&gt; When you join &lt;snip&gt; you are given a white cord.
&gt; If you get an 80 on your test you get a red cord,
&gt; if you get a 180 on your test you get a blue cord,
&gt; if you get a 280 on your test you get a green cord,
&gt; if you get a perfect 300 you get a gold cord.
&gt;
&gt; There is only one gold cord in Ohio and
&gt; just a hand full in the USA.
&gt;
&gt; We have found that UNIX Sys Admin's with 5 years
&gt; of on-the-job experience tend to get a blue cord.
&gt;
&gt; Those with 10 years tend to get a green cord.
&gt;
&gt; All white cord members can take the test when it is offered.
&gt;
&gt; Red and above cord members can only take the test
&gt; if they are "active" have written an article for our news letter
&gt; "The Adventure" every month, and responded to all nominations
&gt; for "The Scouting The Web Award".
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunetly, we currently have no red cord members that are
&gt; eligible to take the test over to get a blue cord:-(
&gt;
&gt; When a youth achives their blue cord,
&gt; we sometimes allow them to
&gt; shadow the advisors at work,
&gt; help them to become inturns,
&gt; get them jobs...
&gt;
&gt; We tend to let them come to Advisors' meetings:
&gt; [social events :-]
&gt;
&gt; Youth Membership is open to anyone between the ages
&gt; of 14 [and in high school] to 20 years of age.
&gt;
&gt; We are extremely picky on adults though.
&gt; They must be able to teach. [UNIX, Camping, Leadership...]
&gt;
&gt; Though it is a bit premature, we have two churches asking
&gt; to copy our program. One in Denver Colorado and one in Utah.
&gt;
&gt; It is our goal have our program all over the world.
&gt; This will happen soon:-)
&gt;
&gt; 369 was in Adelaide a few years back. It is a great city.
&gt; I know that I would love to find a teaching job for the
&gt; months of January and February in Adelaide.
&gt; Kind-of a working holiday...
&gt;
&gt; There was a group in Queensland that tried to start a
&gt; UNIX Youth Mentor "Rover" program. It did not last :-( 
&gt;
&gt; To my knowledge there are only 2 maybe 3 working
&gt; UNIX Youth Mentor Programs in America:
&gt;
&gt;   us, AT&T, and NBC-TV. I think we are the best :-) 
&gt; --
&gt; It takes a long time
&gt; to grow an old friend.
