&gt; &gt; Okay, here's a problem I just can't figure out.
&gt; &gt; Ever since last thursday my soundcard has been running at a sort of
&gt; &gt; halfspeed, or quarter speed. Everything plays fine, except at an
&gt; &gt; amazingly slow rate, and low pitch. Imagine a walkman when the batteries
&gt; &gt; are flat, only worse.
&gt; &gt; I can't figure out what is causing this - I've tried warm boots, cold
&gt; &gt; boots, all manner of different options, different kernel drivers, eSD
&gt; &gt; verses direct OSS, etc. but nothing changes - if the soundcard works, it
&gt; &gt; works at this slow rate.
&gt; &gt; The soundcard was working perfectly for about 6 months prior to this,
&gt; &gt; it's a builtin ESS 1869, and it's never been a problem before. I can't
&gt; &gt; think what happened to start this perculiar behaviour, but I know I
&gt; &gt; plugged an external serial modem in on the same day that I noticed it.
&gt; &gt; Only thing is, I plugged the modem in at night, and the problem had
&gt; &gt; showed up by lunchtime, so that rules it out. Other than that, I don't
&gt; &gt; think I did anything..THe machine hadn't been rebooted for a couple of
&gt; &gt; weeks, so the first thing i did was reboot, but that didn't solve the
&gt; &gt; problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had this occur, and what
&gt; &gt; they did to fix it? Or, has anyone got any ideas about where to look or
&gt; &gt; what to do?
&gt; &gt; Everything I look at looks exactly the same as it did before, and I
&gt; &gt; can't recall doing anything to start this behaviour. I guess there's a
&gt; &gt; slight possibility the soundcard has exploded internally, but that's
&gt; &gt; pretty extreme!
&gt; 
&gt; Tried some Ugg boots.  (sorry).  I assume it is when you play mp3 files or
&gt; wav files.  It's the sampling rate that is causing this.  e.i. 22000 Hz
&gt; when it should be 44000Hz (or there abouts).  Unlikely to be hardware.  You
&gt; need to check what your default settings are for the sound apps.  Give us
&gt; some more info, i.e. what sound apps you were running?
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck
&gt; Conrad.
Well, it occurs with esd, mpg123, amp, and x11amp - those being the
sound apps I could find. In those that tell me, they are set to 44.1
khz, 16bit stereo. I never changed the settings on these inbetween the
working fine and not working fine stages.

If I was running at 22050 Hz sampling rate on a soundcard that was stuck
on 44100 Hz sampleing rate, then wouldn't it run at double the speed,
not half, anyway?

Some dumps:
[<A HREF="mailto:ruiner@tjcorkin">ruiner@tjcorkin</A> ruiner]$ esdctl allinfo
server version = 0
server format  = 0x00000021
server rate    = 44100
player 10 name    = x11amp - plugin
player 10 format  = 0x00001021
player 10 rate    = 44100
player 10 left    = 256
player 10 right   = 256


[<A HREF="mailto:ruiner@tjcorkin">ruiner@tjcorkin</A> ruiner]$ cat /dev/sndstat 
OSS/Free:3.8s2++-971130

[<A HREF="mailto:ruiner@tjcorkin">ruiner@tjcorkin</A> ruiner]$ mpg123 -s "/d/mp3/Nine Inch Nails__Pretty Hate
Machine/NiN_PHM4_sanctified.mp3" |esdcat
That runs at half speed.

[<A HREF="mailto:ruiner@tjcorkin">ruiner@tjcorkin</A> media]$ esdcat "The Microsoft Sound.wav" 
opening socket, format = 0x00001021 at 44100 Hz
Infuriating, that works correctly!
However, if I output an MP3 to wav, and then esdcat the resulting wav
file, it's half speed.
Still, I'm on to sometihng here...
