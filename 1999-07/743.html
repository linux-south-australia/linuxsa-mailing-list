&gt; &gt; The next question I'm just curious about - Chuck, why do you insist on
&gt; &gt; using these things as your name? Lots of people on here use their full
&gt; &gt; names, and haven't yet complained of any abuse of their openness..
&gt; 
&gt; Just a note: I think everyone has the right to preserve their identity,
&gt; for whatever reason they seem fit. People who go by an alias dont bother
&gt; me (although C4IS is hard to type :)).
&gt; 
&gt; What amuses me is some people (in the past) have "insisted" that aliases
&gt; not be used. Why? Why do people have an issue with this? So someone
&gt; wants anonimity (sp?) on the 'net, big deal.
Well, that's why I was talking about netiquette...
It's one thing to have a handle (for instance, everyone on ICQ or IRC
goes by them) - but normally it's something that's static...You know
that that person always goes by the name, and that name is (usually)
that person..
It's still a way of identifying them. If you want anonymity, it sort of
feels like talking to someone's back...It's just impolite.

&gt; 
&gt; I mean, does anyone actually know Morpheous' real name? ;)
The cEvin kEy one, or is this some other incarnation? ;)
