&gt; In a similar vein to this topic.... noted with interest the way the media is playing up the ppl who blew themselves up with
&gt;
&gt; home made bombs built from plans obtained from the internet. Whilst I have nothing but sympathy for the victims & their
&gt;
&gt; families, I cannot believe that the INTERNET is being blamed for this tragedy!! Heard some anti-internet comments already
&gt;
&gt; from some pollies abt it!!
&gt;
&gt; When I was abt 12 I made some really cool home made explosives - blew up the doghouse with them (no , the dog wasnt in it!)
&gt;
&gt; The internet was not around then.... I got the plans from books I borrowed from the Public Library!!
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps we should ask the pollies to also ban books!!
&gt;
The difference is that books are usually screened before a library puts
them on loan although that one is a bit odd.  Depends how long ago you
were 12.  Things like this were less of a concern years ago to the point
where a guy I know who is now in his sixties could, as a 12 year old,
walk into the local explosives store in Broken Hill with his friends and
buy gelignite, 25 feet of fuse and a box of detonators.  They would make
bangalor torpedoes and go and blow the crap out of the local rubbish
dump.  The trouble with the internet is that any bastard can put up any
recipes which are of dubious quality and sometimes some that are
designed to explode in the face of the maker.  The internet is the only
way that type of info can be accessed easily by many.  The question
about porn affecting children is one thing, getting themselves blown up
is getting a bit more serious.  The only way to deal with this without
the crap being proposed is to have international co-operation and
sensible censorship rules.  Now if you think that wouldn't be a circus.

Conrad.
