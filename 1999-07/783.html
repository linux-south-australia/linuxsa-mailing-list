&gt;&gt; Sure, just volounteer your time at a place that uses Linux, e.g. an
&gt;&gt; ISP, consulting firm, etc. ...  And - as you're time is given so freely
&gt;&gt; - I'm sure there will be lotsa takers for your invitation.
&gt;
&gt;Interesting idea, although there would be less takers than you might
&gt;imagine.  It takes significant resources out of a company to permit
&gt;somebody to come in for ``work experience'', and generally there is zero
&gt;economic benefit to the company in return.


(The NICE thing is:

  It only takes ONE far-sighted taker for this guy to win

  Even if he leaves behind the ones who don't want to
  "train somebody else's employee" as some may do,
  he might do better in the company of that one whose
  longer-term pay-back expectations give him more
  "room to breathe"... ;)


So, by you, there isn't a shortage of IT people in Australia...?

The benefits in training (or facilitating self-training) are many,
albeit longer term than you may be in the habit of thinking; e.g.:

 - with more IT-capable people, SA can do more IT work,
   thereby keeping software projects (e.g. export products,
   locally customised projects, etc.) here in this state

   Alternatives:   Export more IT projects & product dev't -&-
                           Import more IT people (as we're doing now)

- with more IT-capable people around -and- more IT work,
  SA's young people get to live where they want to live (SA).

&gt; I like your suggestion  &lt;snip&gt;


Good, then I can depend on your support to 'kill' the censorship bid?

&gt;&gt; Each non-independent "box-pushers" - as I've heard them called -
&gt;&gt; (e.g. Harvey Norman, NetCraft, and lots more interstate) seem to
&gt;&gt; have settled on *one* or *maybe* two flavours.
&gt;
&gt; it takes significant resources to keep staff skilled
&gt; in different Linux distributions.

Agreed.  So, who says it has to be *their* staff?

Imagine:

  A few bigger, mail-order box-pushers - no support,
  just good, honest, cheap distribution of Linux s/w;
  (e.g. Linux Australia could run one as a fund-raiser)

  Anybody interested in Linux and/or *BSD could fill
  in a form (checking-off all the flavors of each os
  they wanted) and - including a SINGLE shipping &
  handling fee - send ONE check to ONE address.

  A few days later, a big box (full of Linux & *BSD joy)
  arrives by courier.

  The lower distribution cost (rather than LOTSA
  little guys each building little stockpiles & playing
  mail-order house on the side) means that more
  $ is available to buy books (also available from
  the few bigger players)... which - of course - can
  come in the same big box   ;)

  And if reducing the cost of distribution isn't deemed
  an option, fine... encourage the little box-pushers to
  use the old Intel (and current OpenBSD ?) model:

  "Discount (subsidise) the CPU... make it up on RAM"

  (You would recall getting a 4004 or 8008 MPU "free"
  and paying LOTS for a tiny bit or memory...)

  OpenBSD - perhaps in a bid to increase its market-
  share vis a vis Linux of all flavors, et al. - now comes
  40% cheaper if you order 20 in one hit...

  (Funny, isn't it?  The announcement of impending
  "censorship" of C4IS comes so soon after I men-
  tion that discount policy...?  But, I digress...  ;)

  ... the almost free OpenBSD pricing (in bulk) en-
  courages users groups to cut out a link in the dis-
  tribution chain (e.g. in places where there isn't a
  local box-pusher).

&gt; The more distributions a company supports
&gt; the greater their staffing cost will be.

Let's turn this around:

I agree that there would be more Linux support
work around (some for each Linux "flavor")...

But I see oppportunity in that... since, with an in-
crease in demand, there will be an increase in
service-providers.

My point:  Who says ONE company must take
all that work on themselves.  Isn't it at least the
hope of SOME of the (say, younger) Linux SA
members that there growing skill-levels will be-
come - at some point - great enough to make
them interesting to consulting firms, ISPs &/or
end-users of Linux or *BSD systems?

And - even if you think ONE company *should*
win most of the support work (e.g. for organis-
ing a users group & doing deals with vendors,
etc.)...

- who says that Co. couldn't *sub-contract* out
the less lucrative and/or (for any reason) less
interesting (to them, given their preferences,
e.g. for application area, etc.) work to others?

If they can do this for less interesting app'n-
areas, they can do it for less interesting fla-
vours of Linux or *BSD...

Finally, even if they were to stay with a few
distributions (the ones they know best, we
hope, rather than the ones with the best
margins...), the old Intel model says:  sell
the boxes at around cost...

... so that MORE people will try it; if it's as
good as it's believed to be by its mission-
aries, this will lead to MORE people & or-
ganisations using it...

...which, of course, means MORE Linux or
*BSD work for people (e.g. on the respec-
tive mailing-lists) to bid for, either directly
or via a contracting firm.

Cool, eh?

&gt; It would surprise me if NetCraft found
&gt; economic advantage in selling and
&gt; supporting multiple distributions.

Well, Intel "freely" gave away CPU's...
do you think they found economic
advantage foregoing short-term
profit (but also enabling low-budget
hobbyists to discover microproces-
sor technologies... some of which
to the extent of becoming start-ups
themselves... buying more later, etc.)

&gt; do you really begrudge them
&gt; their right to a profit?

Of course not...  I'm suggesting that they
might let a bigger mail-order (e-commerce)
box-pusher win greater market-share for
Linux and/or *BSD, but FASTER - just like
Intel used to do it when CPUs were at this
stage in their marketing (OK, so 32-bit os's
are quite a bit farther along... ;) - by almost
giving away the first box...

thereby getting rid of the trivial work that's
in box-pushing... I see the time of any know-
ledgable company better spent consulting
(does your co. stop to peddle boxes?  The
answer is - quite rightly - Of course not! ;)

&gt; Or would you rather pay their wages out of
&gt; your own pocket?

There is a recurrent pattern in several of the
debates that I've been a party to:

Responder - who disputes a position (which
is fine by me) - insists that the only way for
that position to be economically is for me
(its proponent) to fund it.

&gt; Might I just remind you that Linux is at the heart of every Linux
&gt; distribution?  There's more in common between Debian and Slackware than
&gt; there is that's different.  If you fret over the differences, if you
&gt; feel uncomfortable because of RPMs (or the lack thereof), I'd have to
&gt; say go learn the basics.  Enjoy Unix for what it is -- a superb and
&gt; elegant operting system -- and see the diversity of distributions not
&gt; as a barrier, but as "multi-cultural enrichment."


Somehow, you seem to be contradicting yourself hear,
or would seem to, e.g. if you sent that suggestion to the
box-pushers instead of myself...  ;)

&gt;&gt; When e-commerce mail-order houses come into their own in
&gt;&gt; the Australian Linux marketplace, you'll be able to find all at one
&gt;&gt; place (hopefully, with comparisons).
&gt;
&gt;But without any depth of support.

C.f. above comment (i.e. more demand will
bring competence levels up)

&gt; Do you want cheap without help, or
&gt; do you want people who will stand
&gt; behind what they sell?

I'm used to having a choice, so I'll say:  BOTH

That is, I want:

1. CHEAP with original vendor (e.g. RedHat) support
e.g. for low-budget hobbyists (& the unconvinced who
might like to try it without major investment)

They should be able to find it CHEAP from an efficient
if larger Australia-wide distributor (even a users group
that gets 40% off when they buy 20 at a hit would do),
maybe with that same kind of installation support that
RedHat provides via e-mail.

Post-installation support might well come from the
user groups (in the case of the hobbyist) and/or any
consulting companies (in the case of the formerly
unconvinced - but now convinced - "commercial"
user, who's now ready to pay for local support)

&gt; Nobody can be expert in everything.


Agreed!  But - in case you haven't noticed, there are
LOTSA hobbyists about that might be skilling up in
Linux and/or *BSD... and it just might help them to
be noticed by companies like yours...
even if the economic gains come later rather than
sooner.

(Anyway, considering your company's "have fun here"
goal, should you be so far from my position on this?  ;)
