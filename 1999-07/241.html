&gt; install every time!! (The good part was that it doesnt write the unix
&gt; file system to the hdd until after you select what packages you want to
&gt; install - so its still got Caldera-2.2 on it!!)

I attempted an install of FreeBSD a few days ago.  I aborted halfway through
because it was taking too long..  I chose a full/maximum install because I
was lazy :)

My system has two hard disks - one with winblows on it, and one with linux.
It's a play-around system, so I decided to trash the linux drive because
I've done virtually no work on it.  Cool.  So I used BSD's fdisk program to
*look* at the first hard disk, and then to *repartition* the second
(ex-linux) hard disk.

Previous to all this, the windows disk had a "drive" that couldn't be
accessed.  It was just a glitch in the partition table, I guess..  but it
showed up as a separate drive, but attempting to access it ended in a "this
drive is not formatted - format it now?" message.  (hahaha)  It being
windows, I ignored it and went on with my Alien vs Predator playing in
peace.

After aborting the BSD install and booting windows, the bogus drive was gone
:)

So I'm not so sure that BSD doesn't touch the partition table if you don't
tell it to....  scarey stuff.

Eh.
