Hi all.... For what it's worth - I have installed XWIN (there are a variety of
versions - XWINPRO being the latest)  on a couple of windoze boxes... basically its
a WINDOWS XSERVER & it works very well... very little setup/config required etc
etc.... allows any xwin app which as the parameter "-display" available, to run on
any windoze box (3.11/95/98/nt)

Cant remember where I got it from but a websearch on XWINPRO should find it.

Phil



&gt; Hi Jim
&gt;
&gt; ...snip
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It actually may be quite suitable for the job ...
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; Yes, it might. But: its a sledge hammer for the task you describe, it gives you
&gt; the problems you are asking about, is complex to setup/administer, may suck the
&gt; life out of your unix box if more than a handfull of users, use it at the same
&gt; time.
&gt;
&gt; VNC is good. We use VNC - mainly for accessing windows boxes from linux & other
&gt; windows boxes. We don't use it much for accessing UNIX apps because:
&gt; 1. X11 works far faster (except over serial lines)
&gt; 2. absolutely no configuration of the application server is required
&gt;    (other than to install the X application itself!)
&gt; 3. When accessing the application the fact it is on another host
&gt;    can be made transparent.
&gt; 4. Windows users don't usually want a window with a whole unix desktop on it.
&gt;    They want an application window to pop up, on top of their windows desktop
&gt;    just like it was any old Windows application. (VNC puts up a whole UNIX
&gt;    desktop inside a windows window).
&gt; 5. Many of our UNIX/Linux systems don't even have XFree86 installed and even
&gt;    where they do loading down the server running Xserver(s) is undesirable
&gt;    (they are resource intensive beasties)
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand VNC:
&gt; 1. is available totally free for windows
&gt; 2. the same client can control UNIX & Win boxes
&gt;
&gt; ...snip
&gt; &gt; However VNC aside the problem is that I cannot run more than one X
&gt; &gt; server on the box so a remote X server like eXceed couldn't be used
&gt; &gt; either.
&gt;
&gt; This isn't how remotely accessing an X11 app works.
&gt; This misconception is at the core of your problem
&gt; 1. You don't need any X Servers on "the box"
&gt; 2. You can literally run hundreds of X programs displaying on hundreds of
&gt;    different XServers from a unix box that doesn't have a single copy of XFree86
&gt;    or any other Xserver on it. The only XServer required is the one on the box
&gt;    the Monitor is attached to. In your intended case the Xserver is on the
&gt;    windows box.
&gt;
&gt; If you can already run the application on the UNIX/Linux box,
&gt; you have done all you need to on it.
&gt;
&gt; All you need to do now is download/order a evaluation copy of a good XServer
&gt; for windows from the net and install it on the Windows box(es). It should come
&gt; with instructions, on how to configure it. It will have a security system,
&gt; which you will need to tell to allow connections from the application server.
&gt;
&gt; There are many ways to launch the application on the UNIX box. The windows
&gt; software most likely will have tools for the purpose. In the first instance
&gt; though its often easiest to launch it manually. To do this:
&gt; 1. telnet into the application server
&gt; 2. set the DISPLAY variable
&gt;    DISPLAY=my.windows.box.com:0.0
&gt;    (substitute the IP or name of your windows box, the ":0.0" is required)
&gt; 3. start the application (try "xeyes")
&gt;
&gt; &gt; If I can fix this basic problem I can then sort out the VNC vs eXceed
&gt; &gt; questions you raise.
&gt;
&gt; Hopefully we've side stepped the multiple XServer requirement. It's only a
&gt; requirement with VNC.
&gt;
&gt; If you're after a production solution, an X11 server for windows
&gt; is the ideal tool for the job.
&gt;
&gt; If however you have no capacity to purchase or you'd just like to use VNC go
&gt; for it.
&gt;
&gt; Regards
&gt; Adrian
