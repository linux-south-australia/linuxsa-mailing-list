Anders:

&gt; After I used
&gt; redhat 6. for a few months, I did format my hard drive and reinstall the
&gt; linux so many time. The problem is that the system will stop during using
&gt; internet sometime. 

You don't tell us what Netscape you are using. The Netscape packaged
with RedHat 6.0 will NOT work with RedHat 6.0 especially with anything
Java such as an applet or JavaScript.

Netscape 4.51 is BROKEN. You more than likely do not need to reinstall
Linux to fix this problem.

If this sounds like your problem, I suggest that you download Netscape
4.61 or 4.60 which still crash but not quite as often or as hard.
Whatever you do, I would advise you that attempting to get Netscape 4.51
working with RedHat 6.0 is most likely a waste of time.

If you don't need Netscape, go to freshmeat.net or
<A HREF="http://ozybytes.linuxberg.com">http://ozybytes.linuxberg.com</A> (<A HREF="http://www.linuxberg.com">http://www.linuxberg.com</A>) and find
another browser. HotJava is supposed to be good; there is a multitude of
choices there.

If you can afford it you might consider purchasing Mandrake 6.0. It is
basically RedHat with less bugs. 

I hope that this helps you. I have personally decided that RedHat 6.0 is
the same as RedCrash 6.0 - persevere. Once you get RedHat 6.0 working it
really goes FAST and STABLE.

DAVID.
