rajah,

&gt; By the way is the figures are actually in KB's or MB's ?

The advice given to you, specifically read the manual page by using the
command, "man df", was not an idle suggestion.  I dare say everyone here
welcomes you as a new user of Linux; we all love to hear from recent
converts.  There are some things you need to know and the single most
valuable of them is that the documentation is your friend.  A related
point is that we can't read the doco for you, and you'll never get the
hang of things if you don't do this for yourself.

A quick tour of the documentation, and I mean blindingly quick so don't
blink, follows:

The standard source for information on flavours of Unix is the "man"
command.  Type "man man" for details.  To help find the name of a command
which does something use the "-k" option of man.  For example, to find
commands relating to text editors try "man -k editor".  Each page in
the manual is stored in a separate file, and sometimes you can find what
you are looking for most quickly by searching through all pages.
Depending on the flavour Unix the pages are in /usr/man, or /var/man,
or /usr/share/man.  Look around and you'll find them.

Linux comes with some pretty good tutorials on different topics.  These
are known as "HOWTOs".  There are a lot of HOWTOs, and they are kept in
/usr/doc/HOWTO.  They are usually compressed using gzip, so display them
using zcat and pipe the output into more (or less).

There is often a swag of "other" good documentation which lives in
/usr/doc.  On some Unixes this might be /var/doc.

The GNU people, who pioneered the philosophy free software, don't like
to use man pages for a reason which I cannot fathom.  Maybe they also
pioneer the "not invented here" syndrome, which is bad.  Anyway, they
like "info" pages.  I urge you to ignore info pages and to never write
one, and to read them as a last resort if you have to.  Info pages are
displayed using the "info" command and they live in /usr/info.

Finally--and this is not intended as criticism--but is given in the
spirit that there are things everyone needs to know, don't ask questions
on the list until after you tried to find the answer for yourself.  If
you indicate what you have tried when you ask a question you'll likely
receive a positive and helpful response.  For example, ``how do I connect
to my ISP'' might not be answered (if you are lucky), or might earn you
a weekend in hell (more likely).  Such a question is somewhat brainless,
gives little for anyone to go on, and silently screams that the person
who asked it did nothing to help him or herself.  A better question,
``According to the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO I should put my PAP password in the
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets file, which I've done.  When I try to connect the
modem hangs up and the log file shows "rcvd [LCP ConfRej id=0x1 &lt;mru
1500&gt; &lt;auth pap&gt; &lt;magic 0x9078af14&gt; &lt;pcomp&gt; &lt;accomp&gt;]"  What have I done
wrong?'' is likely to earn you enormous respect because it shows that
you made effort to find the answer for yourself.  Obviously few questions
will be as detailed as this because if you know about PAP and ConfRej
you'll be able to work out the whole problem for yourself.  Still, go
as far by yourself as you can and people will be delighted to help.

David
