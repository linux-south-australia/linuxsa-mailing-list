Hi Jim

&gt; Hi all...
&gt; This is a long standing problem which I haven't ever fixed because X

&gt; where several users need access to a genome database and a modelling
&gt; program. I am hoping to use vnc to interface with W95 clients.

Wrong Tool for the job

vnc is intended as a remote console control program, it therefore gives a
window into your consoles main X11 display. great for what it is intended for
but not what you want! 

X11clientprogram--loopback--consoleX11server--VNCserver--eth--windowsVNCClient

What you need is X11 itself which was designed friom the outset as a multi user
networked display system to do just what your after. It will be much faster
than the VNC approach, possibly even faster than the console display, and one
properly configured linux/unix box can support dozens of "X terminals", be they
other unix workstations, special purpose X terminals, or windows X11 server
software. 

X11clientprogram--eth--windowsXserver

To run X11 programs on your linux box and display the contents on a Windows box
you will therefore need a windows compatable X server. There are many excellent
ones out there. Most come with tools to put icons on the windows desktop to make
it all seamless for users.  Unfortunately it's been my experience that the
polished ones, like "exceed" are commercial, with limited free trials and a
purchase price of about $100 per windows seat.

A great companion tool for windows/X11 is terraterm with the secure shell
extensions

ps: the X "Server" is the thing drawing on the screen (eg the windows X11
software, or the XFree86 server controlling yor console), The X client is the
thing asking the server to draw things (eg the "xeyes" program running on your
unix box).
