i *just* has this problem, and i fixed it by putting this on the first
line


#!/bin/bash


this wasn't there, and that was why it didn't work.


do you have #!/bin/perl as the first(ish) line

&gt; G'day Darryl,
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The script was working. It has stopped working. I gave all the information I
&gt;  &gt; could think of. I haven't changed anything that I can remember, only
&gt;  &gt; upgraded the m/b and ram.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Error Log:
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; [Thu Jul 22 17:00:46 1999] [error] [client 203.31.252.50] Premature end of
&gt;  &gt; script headers: /home/httpd/cgi-bin/MailMan.cgi
&gt; 
&gt; This is kind of a catch-all phrase Apache uses, but in essence it
&gt; means it failed before finding the area of the script that has the
&gt; headers in it.
&gt; 
&gt; This can happen if:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) It didn't actually access the file due to permissions problems.
&gt; Compare your program with the sample program and see if they have the
&gt; same permissions. If not, give MailMan.cgi the same permissions as the
&gt; sample.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) It could access the file but an error occured before it reached the
&gt; section with the headers.  One really common cause is the path for
&gt; perl. Make sure it matches the path on your system.
&gt; 
&gt; Another common cause is when a script has paths that you have to set
&gt; for your system and you either have it incorrect, the file it's trying
&gt; to access doesn't have the required permissions set.
&gt; 
&gt; Next would be leaving off the ";" at the end of a line that requires
&gt; it. Not all lines require this, but it's easy enough to find if run
&gt; the program from the command line.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) Premature end of script headers. (No really). Apache requires at
&gt; least:
&gt; 
&gt; print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
&gt; 
&gt; Usually the problem is solved before then, and since the program
&gt; worked in the past, it's probably one of the other items mentioned
&gt; above.
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; The sample script that comes with MailMan *does* work. And I have checked
&gt;  &gt; and the path to perl is the same in both of them.
&gt; 
&gt; Opps didn't see this.  Next to check would be permissions.
&gt; 
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Gaelyne
