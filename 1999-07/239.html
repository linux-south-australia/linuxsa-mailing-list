Greetings.... thought I might share my opinions on the
differences/similarities between LINUX & FreeBSD, having now come to
grips with some of FreeBSD's idiosyncratic behaviours! If you think that
discussing the comparison is heresy...cease reading :)!!!


I attempted to install FreeBSD on  2 pc's:

1.
2.
486dx2/66
Pentium60
16Mb RAM                                                    24Mb RAM
400Mb HDD                                                  340MB HDD
160Mb HDD                                                   202Mb HDD
aha152xSCSI Card                                         SB16Card
SONY CDROM
Matsushita/Panasonic CDROM
1.44MB Floppy Drive                                    1.44MB Floppy
Drive
Generic Trident SVGA Card                        Generic Trident SVGA
Card
VGA Monitor                                                VGA Monitor
MS Type Mouse(COM1)                             MS Type Mouse(COM1)
14k4 internal Modem(COM4)                    14k4 internal Modem(COM4)

First Install was on the 486dx2/66 ([previously running REDHAT-5.2)  -
went superbly - selected the "Novice" Install Method - Had no probs
figuring out what some of the Hardware Options meant (but only because I
have experience with linux!!!)  No probs setting upX (its identical to
Linux XF86Setup/xf86config) and other than a mental problem starting X
(I ended up making an .xinitrc in /root & booting into an xterm &
running startkde from there) it was simplicity itself. The FreeBSD
install recognised my aha152x card & instantly found the cdrom attached
to the card.... I had no difficulty figuring out how to install
everything BUT again, only because of my linux experience - I think a
non-linux user would be in over their head!!!!

Installation was quite quick (less than an hour easy!) & I ended up with
all of the 2nd hdd free & abt 90Mb free on primary hdd.  I did a
reinstall on this box purely because I realised what I had stuffed up re
the 2nd hdd, on my first install.

Next came an install on my Pentium 60 (previously running Caldera-2.2)
-  A total disaster.... no way despite 12 attempts to install, could I
get FreeBSD to actually initialise the sbpcd (freebsd calls it matcdc)
despite changing IO's, entering the manual configuration option etc
etc... it would not & could not, find the cdrom & so I had to abort the
install every time!! (The good part was that it doesnt write the unix
file system to the hdd until after you select what packages you want to
install - so its still got Caldera-2.2 on it!!)

So, I had one working FreeBSD box.... running KDE-1.0 & most of the KDE
apps I am used to.... I located a mega-load of packages(ports) on the
4th cd & began installing them (as simple as pkg_add name-of.file.tgz) -
including practically all the apps I use on my linux boxes.  Even found
netscape-communicator-4.05 & MC so installed them as well!

After installing Netscape I figured it was time to get on the internet -
hmmmm... problem.... configured kppp for /dev/cuaa3 (yep an extra 'a' in
the dev) and it kept telling me it could not locate the modem when I
tried to dial out... so, RTFM.... ooooops...FreeBSD appears to believe
that COM4 IRQ3 is crap & therefore doesnt do it..you can have COM4 IRQ5
or 7 though.. so opened up the PC & rejumpered IRQ to 5 on the internal
modem... start again....cannot find the modem again!!!  Now, under linux
this would suggest I needed to do something to rc.serial or setserial
etc... so went looking for similar files...found rc.serial - I think its
written in Ancient Egyptian btw!! :) I tried a few tricks to get it to
initialise COM4 but no luck.. the rc.serial file really didnt make a lot
of sense so I took the next option after another go at RTFM to no
avail./... disabled COM2 on my io card & rejumpered the modem to COM2
settings.... turned pc back on - startx, click kppp & the initiailising
modem message sat there fore 5 mins... so opened an xterm & typed echo
"ati" &gt; /dev/cuaa1 & similar other commands...tried kppp again &
eventually it initialised ok... connect, logged in & surfing!! Havent
had to use the "echo" command again since btw!

I have abt 20Mb's of hdd space left on 1st HDD & a load of symlinks to
2nd HDD & it is running great!! To all intents & purposes it looks like
LINUX & feels like LINUX & runs like Linux... I can honestly not
see/feel a single difference playing with Linux or FreeBSD from X + KDE.

Console apps are similar... syntax is nearly identical .... found a few
interesting network apps I have never seen on linux but other than that
no real differences at all.. FreeBSD appears to be as good a Desktop
system as Linux (heresy!! :))
[To the person who emailed me with a somewhat sarcastic tone, when I
mentioned FreeBSD yesterday.. and said FreeBSD was a lousy desktop
system but fine as a server and I was wasting my time etc etc ad nauseum
ad inifinitum..... I suggest you need to learn how to install the
packages/ports and get X/KDE or FVWM95 running properly!!!!!!]

I had not real probs with any aspect of setting it up on the 486 except
for BASH!! I cannot get bash to be my shell & the mongrel csh shell is
useless!! At present I am typing bash every time I log in! I swear by
Midnight Commander (MC) on linux and found the FreeBSD package &
installed it... I spend ages trying to get it to run...kept typing mc...
nothing... did whereis/locate/find - nothing - no mc executable...
hmmmm... its called midc would you believe... symlinked mc to midc & now
I am happy.

Networking is good, heaps of apps/servers etc ... it is now part of my
LAN.
FDISK sux big time ... ummm, what else, It has mtools, it knows abt
ext2fs... the route command doesnt like route -n :)  You can dual boot
if you want.

Behaviour/Performance of the 486dx2/66 with FreeBSD + KDE-1.0 is
basically identical to when it was running REDHAT with KDE-1.0 etc.

Final Opinion of FreeBSD..... easy to install if you are an experienced
Linux user.... dont use a Panasonic/SB CDROM.... read whats written on
the screen instead of just hitting what would be the right option under
linux (although it works most of the time!) ....be prepared to do a lot
of RTFMing from time to time:)  Running FreeBSD from the console feels
like using an antique slackware linux btw :) . Cannot see that any linux
user would have major probs with FreeBSD at all.;the similarities are
many & syntax nearly identical.. a quick man [command] clears up any
discrepancies. No real dramas, certainly nothing that some further
RTFMing won't fix.

I will leave it on the 486dx2/66 so that I can add some unix related
stuff to my knowledge/experience ....BUT for now that is all....Linux
has more apps, is a tad more user friendly :) and feels nicer (a case of
the devil you know vs the devil you dont I suppose!!)

Is it worth trying FreeBSD ????????... Yes, IMHO, if for no other reason
than to prove that you are not only a Quasi-Linux-Guru, but also a
Quasi-Unix-Guru :)))

Cya, Phil
