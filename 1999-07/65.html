&gt; What is the best method of obtaining linux? Do you get install instructions
&gt; with it.?

I would have to say, and I speak from experience, that the friendly people
at NetCraft have what you want.  I keep buying (and giving away) the Red
Hat 6 burn on demand CD set which comes with no printed documentation, and
that's almost too much documentation for me.  For you, who have never used
Linux before, perhaps the boxed set would be in order; it's a little more
expensive, which is to say it's merely cheap (the BOD CD is unbelievably
cheap.)


&gt; Do I need all of this other stuff that seems to be "add-ons"..... Gimp etc?

Of course you need all of the other stuff that is add-ons; if it's available
you want it, right? :-)  A huge amount of stuff, and since you mentioned it
that includes *The* GIMP, is already included on the CD.  You'll be blown
away by KDE, Gnome and Enlightenment.  Oh, and you won't get away from the
Windows Blue Screen of Death.  I dare say it'll haunt your system every
time you walk away for a cup of coffee.  :-)  (Honest.)


&gt; Are things like Corel Draw, Autocad, Word, Excel, Norton antivirus
&gt; supported?

Sorry, Nigel, these are not supported.  Look: Corel say they will port
Corel Draw to Linux, so trust them, vaporware now, realware later.  I
doubt Autocad will ever work, despite the fine effort being put into
Wine, a Windows emulator.  Cynic though I am, by the time the Wine crew
have got the 32 bit emulator ready for prime time, Microsoft will have
added whole new swags of Windows, sufficient to make sure people can't
live with an emulation.  As to Word and Excel: These will be ported to
Linux just after Hell freezes over.  There are lots of good alternatives;
some are even as expensive. :-)  Norton antivirus?  I'm afraid the DOS
and Windows virii aren't likely to work well under Linux (Wine team
notwithstanding).  Anyway, no, this falls into the Autocad category.


&gt; Will I need a PS printer?..... or will it support stuff like Canon BJ's

Printing is one of the least attractive aspects of Unix.  The Canon BJ
is supported by whatever programs support it.  Additionally, programs
which support PostScript printers probably could work with your Canon
using "ghostscript", which is a PostScript interpreter.  There is an
adequately good range of printers which work with ghostscript, the Canon
might be one.  Do some research on the web to find out this one.
