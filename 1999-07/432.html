&gt; I have decided a number of things:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Should anyone reply to me with a minor insult I shall ignore it

Most commendable. I think most of us already do that.

&gt; 2) I shall attempt not to be sneeringly saracastic and rather than
&gt; saying RTFM (Read the Fucking Manual) I will say the manual is in, for
&gt; example, /usr/doc/HOWTO, please read it

&gt; 3) I refuse any more to use my sense of humour, it's too easily misread

Do you write stuff that is mis-readable?

&gt; 4) If anyone at all says anything which I consider libellious there are
&gt; a number of court cases which indicate that emails are just as valid as
&gt; any other written or spoken form of communication and I *WILL* seek
&gt; legal advice should anyone decide to make libellious comments about me.
&gt; 

My God, has it all come to this? I am asking myself do we really have to
warn each other of the threat of libel on this group. If this is what it
has come to I think maybe we should all ask ourselves why we subscribed,
and continue to subscribe, to this forum. Me, I joined to participate in
an open exchange of information on a technical computing topic. But
maybe that's just me. Oh, and I wear a Rhino skin when necessary.

Might I politely suggest that in this forum, unlike some other more
pedantic ones I have visited, the judicious use of emiticons (smileys)
is acceptable. In some cases they can help ensure the tongue in your
cheek is interpreted as you intended it to be. 

Lest this be seen as a personal criticism, let me assure the gentle
reader that I aim the advice at the adressee of this email, i.e. the
group, and not at any individual person, company or other entity that
may or may not be offended or affronted (as the case may be) by any
words, phrases or ideagrams that are or may be interpreted, read or
inferred from this or any other previous or future communication to this
forum or any other that the reader may or may not be, or become,
subscribed to. ;)
