&gt;A recent couple of posts conjure up the following idea:
&gt;
&gt; A linux training course in Adelaide. &lt;snip&gt;
&gt; a full weekend course, possibly semi-residential at some
&gt; hide-away in the hills that has a good internet connection
&gt; and lots of room to set up, say, about 20 PC, ethernetted.
&gt;
&gt; A weekend, organized in time similarly to a choir rehearsal
&gt; camp, would be 3 formal sessions of about 3 hours each per day,
&gt; plus limitless informal sessions in the main room, with people
&gt; learning the way computers have always been best learned -
&gt; by asking the person sitting next to you.
&gt;
&gt; The timetable would be Fri 6-9 p.m., Sat. 9-12,
&gt; 2-5 p.m., 7-10 p.m., Sun 10-1, 2-5, or something like that.
&gt; That would be about 18 hours of intensive formal time --
&gt; i.e. 18 1-hour talks by specialists in each topic.
&gt; That's equivalent to about a year of linuxSA meetings.
&gt;
&gt; This is such an obviously good idea, I'm certain I'll
&gt; be told that it's been done already.


Well, here's a suggestion for a venue (no guarantees
that the owner(s) will do it, but I wouldn't be surprised):

St Peters (?) Monastery on Glen Osmond Rd (I think)

It was recently the host to a number of widowed, separ-
ated or divorced people who needed to ("work thru their
feelings" - one wonders what feelings the widowed and
divorced would have in common... but I digress... ;)

Anyway, they did it (albeit with all-volunteer presenters)
for a small group for just $110 - and that was for the
2 overnights and all meals through sunday lunch.

If that were the cost - or less - I'm sure it would fly/sell.

Of course, the cost would DROP if organisers can
sell display space to businesses who live on Linux,
just as in traditional trade-shows...
