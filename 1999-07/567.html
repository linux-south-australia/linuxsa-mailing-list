Unlike M$, Apple makes computers, and monolithic Linux runs on most, if 
not all, Apple's PCI Power Macs. Another variant (server on a Mach-based 
microkernel) runs on the first generation NuBus PMacs.

With tonight's announcements by Apple of built-in wireless networking in 
its upcoming "iMac" consumer notebook, iBook, it would seem that Linux 
wireless networking has a new potential. Briefly, the iBook comes with a 
fixed antenna, a slot for an add-in "AirPort" card, and the 
Lucent-designed LAN base station has a range of 150 feet, IIRC.

Whilst the range may seem on the short side, the reality is that Linux 
will almost certainly be ported to the iBook (as it has been with the 
iMac), so it may be possible to utilise the AirPort hardware in other 
wireless networks.

The usual complaints about Apple hardware being "too expensive" are for a 
different forum: I know the company is not everyone's cup of tea; but 
with their recent adoptions of PC-standard interfaces -- PCI, USB, IDE -- 
Apple is at least showing that it is listening. And don't forget that 
many embedded PowerPC chips (from Motorola) exist, and also run Linux.

As someone who has followed the events closely leading up to the iBook 
wireless networking announcement -- the rumours about an Apple-Lucent 
partnership go back *years* -- I feel that you should all at least be 
exposed to the information above ;-)

BTW, I don't work for Apple, and never have. I run 2.2.10 (with Contour 
3-button ADB mouse support :-) on my 7200, which is now over 3 years old. 
The latest release from LinuxPPC Inc., "LinuxPPC 1999", is a RedHat 5 
clone, with Gnome, KDE, /etc. Other distros are available: e.g. 
YellowDog, a more server focused variant; and there is a Developer 
Reference Release from the main contributors.

USB support works quite well in Linux/PPC, I believe, due to the effort 
to port to the iMac, and USB PCI cards can be added to older PMacs. 
Ethernet is standard on all Apple hardware, even the iMac and iBook (auto 
10/100).

All up, Linux on Apple hardware makes an excellent combo. If you don't 
care, that's cool, but built-in wireless networking in a consumer 
portable is hard to beat ;-)
