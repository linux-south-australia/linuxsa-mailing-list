&gt; You can also use VMWare to run windows instaled on an existing partition.
I wasn't aware of this ability - I've never used vmware, partially
because I wasn't prepared to put up with the hassle of making new
partitions, etc. etc.
Would the installation procedure make it obvious how to tell it to use
an existing partition?

TC

&gt; 
&gt; This allows the following 'problem'..
&gt; If you set VMWare to boot from your Linux/Windows partitioned hadware
&gt; it will loyally start lilo (wow!) and then if not caught in time, will start to
&gt; boot the default OS, linux (isn't it for everyone?) which will then crash your
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; The documentation warns about trying to run VMWare inside of
&gt; VMWare.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also the lesser problem of getting the screen resolution etc.
&gt; to work in both as you need different drivers.. but thats a windows
&gt; profile problem (and another prompt at the windows boot!)

&gt; &gt; Vmware is very handy Small Office/Business tool. Once set up Win98 will
&gt; &gt; run easily as well as it does on its own Hard Drive. And it runs windows
&gt; &gt; apps just as well. A system with a lot of grunt is needed. My 233mzP11
&gt; &gt; and 128mg ram is very slow. Once you have allocated space on your disk
&gt; &gt; (setup asks for 1 Gig) it will need to be formatted (a bit hairy).
&gt; &gt; Vmware prefer an upgraded X server to be used (available at their web
&gt; &gt; site). Install this first. While running it will use approx half your
&gt; &gt; ram, but this can be adjusted. -Good product.
