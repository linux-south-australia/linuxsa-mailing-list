C4IS,

Flame on!

&gt;&gt; there are people out there C41S, who cannot afford to buy that neat
&gt;&gt; 32bit PC.
&gt;
&gt; In that case, *THAT* is the problem to be addressed IMHO.
&gt; Australia is NOT a "3rd world" country; there is plenty of $ here.

So why don't you buy, let's say one cash converter pc per week, and
donate it to people who "only" have C64's?  Put your money where your
(annoying) mouth is.


&gt; Rather than investing the time in 8-bit technologies let those who "have
&gt; not" use publicly owned 32-bit technologies, so they can *enjoy* about
&gt; the same experience that we do.

You are a foolish little child (I suppose).  There's no need for you to be
snobbish about bits.  There's nothing wrong with 8-bit CPUs and there's
nothing wrong with 64KB RAM.  This is more than enough computing power to
fly a Voyager to the outer limits of our heliosphere and beyond; and it's
more than enough for a backup system for an Apollo space mission taking
people to the surface of the moon and back.

I have to say, having used a computer with 5MW hard disk and 4KW core,
that it was oodles for a FORTAN-IV compiler, an Algol-68 compiler, a
macro assembler, a disk operating system and various utilities.  Okay,
it was 16 bit technology, but goodness, it wasn't the width of the word
that mattered, it was the quality of the code.  It's people of limited
vision who feel that a computer must have enough RAM to store a complete
encylopaedia.  It also displays a certain arrogance to assume, "I wouldn't
like it, ipso facto nobody else would."  Obviously you are incapable of
understanding that some people actually *like* their C64.  How dare you
belittle their choice?

How dare you assume that 100% use of a splendid C64 is inferior to an hour
begrudged on the local library computer?  Why don't you limit yourself to
"publicly owbned 32-bit technologies" for a while, and see how much you
enjoy it?  (I assure you *I* would enjoy it much more if you did that.)


&gt; I'm sure you wouldn't want YOUR kid/friend/lover being limited to
&gt; Internet accessed only via 8-bit technology... or am I wrong, here?

You so often are.

Why don't you use your name?  The bullshit you told me, implying it's a
HotMail feature, is, as typifies you, just so much hot air.  Grow up,
stop your incessant whining and your politically naive preaching.  Start
living in the real world.  That includes, I might add, text that's
just a
little
wider
than this.
It also includes the courtesy of a name.
 
Flame off.

In utmost sincerity,

David, who feels much better now, thank you for asking.
