Dear Editor,

I firmly believe that the new Broadcasting Services Amendment law,
which our Government claims will protect children from exposure to
unsuitable Internet content, will not stop anyone from accessing anything.
The Government's own expert, the CSIRO, says this.  Internet providers
say this.  Foreign governments (who are now laughing at Australia),
say this.

When people ask me about it I explain ISPs will have to buy new equipment
and software, which costs money and obviously that cost will be passed
on to consumers by way of higher charges; and this hardware and software
will slow down internet access; but I tell them not to worry, apart
from increased costs and slower speed there will be no real effect.
I tell them they will still be able to visit their favourite sites,
although perhaps they will need a slightly different way to get there.

On reflection I realise the effect is worse than this.  Parents are
rightfuly worried about what their children see on the Internet.
Anyone can find and view pornography and other materials innapropriate
for children.  On the one hand the Government says this law will protect
children from those sites.  On the other hand ISPs, CSIRO, and other
clueful organisations say it won't work.  What do non-internet savvy
parents believe?  Many parents will only hear the Government side,
namely that they don't have to worry about it.  Those who hear both
sides probably will trust the Government.

Australians are about to be lulled into a false sense of security.
If you know you are at no risk from some particular threat there is
no reason to take precautions against it.  Parents, believing their
children to be safe from porn, won't see any need to supervise them.
How cheated they will feel when they discover their children have been
playing with porn all while the Government said it couldn't happen.

The Government, through this legislative deceit, has made the Internet
a much more dangerous place for our children.

Yours Sincerely,

David Newall
