&gt; 	I am considering purchasing vmware but first of all I would like to

It ran all win95/98 apps fine for me. Of course it didn't work with and
direct X stuff - it said it wouldn't anyway.

&gt; 	I have a AMD K6II 350 with 64 mb Ram, I realise I will probably need
&gt; 128mb for any productive performance.
&gt; 

I only have 64MB ram. It ended up using 48MB swap on my machine. Loading
sux but once you've got your favorite app running it's fine. (Until you
decide to play quake at the same time - major hard disk thrash :)

&gt; Are there any price wise and ease of setup comparable products
&gt; available? This email has no relation to the ad that was posted on this
&gt; group last week, I am not interested in that particular program.
&gt; 
&gt; 	I apologise for all the questions but I would like to have as much
&gt; information as possible before I spend
&gt; 	the rent money ;-)
&gt; 

Why not answer the question yourself. There is a demo version available.
You simply get a 30 day key with it. If you like it then you can register
it and simply upgrade the key.
