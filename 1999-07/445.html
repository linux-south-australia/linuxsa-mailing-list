 &gt; Curisoity begs me to ask would this email be barred by the new internet
 &gt; law?

Depends on how it's enforced:  The OFLC's classification guidelines 
for film specify that "gratuitous" profanity warrants an R rating,
which would be enough to ban this message (since people can read it
without an adult verification device), so it depends on whether the 
OFLC would consider it "gratuitous".

In one sense it isn't (because it was required as a specific answer to
a specific question), but in another sense it is (because the acronym
is gratuitous in the first place).  The guidelines are ambiguous even
when they're applied to film (which is why the Classification Review
Board hasn't had a single unanimous decision in over three years: the
censors themselves can't agree about what the rules mean!), so frankly
I don't think we'll have any idea about whether this kind of thing
will be banned until the OFLC actually looks at a case, which they
aren't allowed to do until January 1 2000.

Assuming the email message would earn an R rating for gratuitous
profanity, there are two ways in which it could be censored by the
Government: Either someone on LinuxSA could complain to the ABA about
this specific message, or someone on a different mailing list who
never saw this message might complain about something completely
different which convinces the ABA that they should distribute a
"special access prevention notice" which specifies that the subject of
the (completely unrelated) complaint and everything else on the
Internet which is "substantially similar" should be blocked by ISPs.

All copies of the message would then need to be censored to remain in
compliance with the law, even private copies held on your hard disk:
If, for example, your mother can telnet to your machine and read a
private archive of LinuxSA that you happen to keep on your hard disk,
the contents of that telnet session count as "Internet Content", and
you are defined to be an "Internet Content Host" and thus legally
required to act upon take-down notices.  Everyone who runs any kind of
server (pop3, ftp, telnet, http, gopher, irc, anything else which
generates bytes on the network) would also be an ICH -- including most
people here when they dial-in to the Internet with their Linux boxes
running all their network daemons.

Of course, none of it might ever be an issue, depending on your ISP.
Some (many?  most?  all?  Who knows?  Ask the ABA!) ISPs are going to
respond to the law by implementing censorware filtering; without
exception, all censorware works on the basis of lists of blocked words
(the ones with URL blacklists gather the blacklist by trawling the
'net for naughty words like "amateur" and "root").  Since email is
covered by the law, that'll probably be filtered too, meaning the
message would never have reached your mailbox in the first place, so
you wouldn't have been able to complain to the ABA about it in the
first place.
