I am pretty sure that this message didnt get to the list 2 days ago...so
will repost it

I have built up a triple boot pc running LINUX(SuSE) FreeBSD & WIN 95.
and struck 2 problems - 1 which I solved, and the other which so far I
cannot resolve at all!

PROBLEM #1:
The so called "booteasy" FreeBSD Boot Manager was overwritten when I
installed LINUX & despite doing some serious RTFM'ing I can find no
reference in the damn book or on the FreeBSD site on how to reinstall
the Free BSD boot manager. 
I have FreeBSD on /dev/hda1 , LINUX  on /dev/hda2 and WIN95 on /dev/hdb1
Anyway, to cut a long story short I just added the following lines to
LILO & it worked
#
other=/dev/hda1
table=/dev/hda
label=FreeBSD
#
NB: I have given up on the FreeBSD Boot Manager!!

PROBLEM #2:
FreeBSD has quite good linux emulation so I want to play with it &
easiest way is to just  cp /linuxDir/linuxfiles /FreeBS
howver I cannot get FreeBSD's partition to mount properly. 

As far as I am aware, and from what I have RTFM'd, FreeBSD uses UFS  but
when I mount -tufs /dev/hda1 /FreeBSD  it mounts alright, as a 750Mb
file and whats  worse is that I cannot umount /dev/hda1 once I mount it
so of course when I reboot into FreeBSD fsck is quite busy for a while!!
(Yes, I have tried various command line options of umount to no avail) 

I vaguely recall having a similar problem when I first started playing
with LINUX & was trying to mount a windoze partition & it mounted as a
file but I cant remember what I had done wrong (cos I so rarely ever do
anything wrong anymore :) rofl!)

Any ideas, anybody?

TIA, Phil
