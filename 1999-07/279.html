Hi,

&gt;I dont fully understand how hard drives communicate with each other. If
&gt;you have say two computers cabled with Network cards. There is one hard
&gt;drive on A and two hard drives on B. Each computer has a TCP/IP address
&gt;or name and can communicate once these parameters are set. 
&gt;
&gt;What enables the two hard drives on B to talk to each other ? .. as they
&gt;both have the same network card and IP address. Or how does a hard drive
&gt;(not computer) on B talk to computer A. Is this in the area of
&gt;subnetworking ? 

Hmmm, this is one of the most interesting, fundamental misunderstandings I
have seen in a while :-)

The computer talks to the hard drives, via IDE or SCSI controllers, and
drives don't, generally, talk to each other.

That said, what you probably want to know about is how does Computer A make
(parts) of its hard disk available for Computer B to access, and vice versa.

That is where Samba comes it.  

You know, I was involved in writing a whole book on this subject, so it is
hard to do your question justice in a few minutes or one email.

I will probably be at the next LinuxSA meeting, and the book is available
for $39.95, so give it a try :-)

&gt;And yes I have read networking HOWTOS etc, and have Samba operating on
&gt;my system.
