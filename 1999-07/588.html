&gt; Or alternatively, you can get a low level format program from your hard

Assuming you are talking about IDE drives, I seriously doubt that you
can get such a program.  I have tried, on a number of occassions, to
find such programs, and completely failed.  I have searched manufacturers
web sites, and that includes Seagate, Connor and Maxtor, with generally
the same result:  There are no such available programs.  Some provided
a program which they called a formatter, but which in fact only performed
destructive surface verify.

IDE drives are, in general, only formattable with a program specifically
for that model drive.  One issue is Zone Bit Recording, which is to say
that the bit density is kept more or less constant across the drive
surface.  At the outer edge, where a cylinder is obviously longer than
the inner edge, more sectors are recorded per track.  These drives (and
I should say that probably all modern drives use ZBR) divide the disk
into zones (of consecutive cylinders) and use decreasing sectors per
track from outer to inner zone.  Unlike SCSI, IDE has no command to
format the drive, so to low-level format it you need to a) use some
drive-specific commands; and b) know what the zones are.  Obviously
there are such programs but the manufacturers keep them very much to
themselves.

Paranoidically speaking, it's in the manufacturers interests to keep
these programs private: Many faulty drives can be resurected by low-level
format, and by denying this facility the manufacturer sells drives more
often.
