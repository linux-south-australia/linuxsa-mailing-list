I disagree,

it is much much quicker, more polite and sociable to just say look at
www.*** or look in the HOWTO-XXX than to give some-one a mail-bashing.

Apart form pooling our expertise and knowledge the mailing list can provide
a valuable resource to newbies, many who may be coming from MS environments
and are missing many of the basic unix commands and file structure
conventions we all take for granted.

We like to promote unix based solutions here. By emails such as yours you
are doing just the opposite.

I have only been on this mailing list a very short time, and whilst the
topics are varied and interesting the real disappointing thing is all the
shit that is flung. It really does not portray us as unix users as a
supportive and professional mob.

We all would like to see linux dominate the OS market, but this is
definitely not the way to start on this path.

I always try and help newbies, I remember the dim dark ages when I knew Jack
(and probably still do!).

Like the last one I helped; turned out they got 59 flames to the mail post
and one useful response (mine). Turns out that she is looking at Linux as an
alternative to Netware in her organisation. Demeaning and content-free email
responses =&gt; Netware or NT up one, Linux down one.

The trend is here fellows; Keep up the good work, and god only knows how
many people we can scare away from linux, no matter how good it is.

&gt; Importance: Low
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Lai, Apology from the start, this may sound like a verbal bashing.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry to sound like a pain, but the questions you are asking
&gt; are answered in
&gt; a lot of places on the net. You are basically asking the same
&gt; questions 'How
&gt; do I do a minimal install of RedHat, How do I do a minimal
&gt; install of Suse,
&gt; how do I install Debian'.
&gt;
&gt; Okay, most distributions have some kind of "Here's howto
&gt; install this", even
&gt; Windows does, most distro give you massive amounts more than
&gt; windows on how
&gt; to install.
&gt;
&gt; You give no indication of having read any documentation to
&gt; get some ideas
&gt; like, I tried to install Suse, but thing G broke I tried the
&gt; doco, it said I
&gt; should upgrade to library libwhatsit version 99 and then do
&gt; something else,
&gt; I can't understand what the something else is, could somebody
&gt; please give me
&gt; a hand.
&gt;
&gt; It is important to at least attempt to do something first,
&gt; read all you can
&gt; understand (I will not say everything is perfectly
&gt; understandable on the
&gt; first read or even thirtieth read), but you must attempt.
&gt;
&gt; If you don't wish to attempt, send somebody your computer, a couple of
&gt; hundred dollars, your cd's, etc, to someone and they will
&gt; install it for
&gt; you. You didn't have to read any documentation and the system
&gt; got built for
&gt; you.
&gt;
&gt; I suspect this is not your goal (given the fact that you at
&gt; least asked a
&gt; question, all encompassing as it may be), so read, read some more and
&gt; continue reading.
&gt;
&gt; I have never installed Suse or Debian so I can not say how
&gt; easy/hard they
&gt; are to install, or what would constitue a minial install, but
&gt; I would read a
&gt; few bits of doco and document the error messages on failure
&gt; so I have some
&gt; questions with hard facts to show.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;/flame&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Rob.
&gt;
&gt; P.S. If anyone wants to flame as picking on a newbie &lt;read
&gt; non-guru&gt; go for
&gt; it. I am big enough and ugly enough (you will have to trust me on this
&gt; point) to handle it. 8-) I go in with my eyes open!!!!
