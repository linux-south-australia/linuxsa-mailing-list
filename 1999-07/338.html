&gt; The only way to deal with this without
&gt; the crap being proposed is to have international co-operation and
&gt; sensible censorship rules.  Now if you think that wouldn't be
&gt; a circus.

Conrad,
I have to comment here, someone said to me once that the Internet was like a
slice of life.  Everything is there, maybe not in representitive proportions
but all there.  I am not a parent, but should I be in the future I will
guide my kids as much as I can on how to avoid bad things in life, and the
net.  I think regardless of what the government does this is where the
solution will ultimately lie.  If children are determined to find bad stuff,
then they will, and lets face it - they often catch on very much faster than
adults when it comes to new technology.
It has been said before but I believe this conclusion is inevitable and that
any Government/International action will only prove to inconvenience the
majority.

Jamz.
