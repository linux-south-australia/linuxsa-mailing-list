Hi,

&gt;&gt;"Read The Fucking Manual"
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I thought it was "Read The Fine Manual" ???   ;)

Actually, it is not very well known[1], but the origins of this term are
all the result of a Fantastic Mixunderstanding.

Prof Wexelblat at MIT had developed an entirely new class of computer,
which he had called the Finagle Machine, after is long-time friend and
associate, Roger Finagle.

However, on the night prior to its unveiling, and enterprising, but not too
bright, student broke into the office where it was being housed and stole
the Finagle Machine.

This young student tried to get the machine to work, but, not being too
bright, as I have already said, he could not get very far.  So he posted a
message to the alt.turing.machines.broken mailing list to seek help in
getting the machine to work.

Prof Wexelblat happened to read the name newsgroup and spotted the message
straight away and realized that the miscreant was describing his beloved
Finagle Machine.

Straight away, he responded: RTFM.

The not-so-bright student pondered over this for a while, and finally
concluded that his correspondent meant: Read The Fine Manual. He
immediately went back to steal the Fine Manual, thus proving that he was
really not-too-bright.  

Since the Prof's fine machine had been stolen, he had security guards
partol the building, and when the young student returned for the Fine
Manual, he was apprehended. Where upon, the student was heard to say, "If
only I had not come back for that Fucking Manual!" Unfortunately, the
Finagle Machine was never recovered.

To this day, people still think that RTFM means Read the Fucking Manual.

Of course, Prof Wexelblat had meant: Return the Finagle Machine!
