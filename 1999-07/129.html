&gt; Hi there all,

Hi, I have been a bit busy, and I can't remember if I have already replied
to this .. so .. :)

&gt; got a question regarding a wireles network. Canberra is up and working and 
&gt; Adelaide is meant to be working but is it.

In a word, no. I think there are a few people where and there who have
setup personal links, but as for the planned "Adelaide Wireless Network",
nothing has really happened yet.

The reason for this is that I have been too busy to chase and organize the
right people, and the fact that Integrity Data Systems seem to not be able
to provide cards at this time.

I am also chasing cards through Lucent Australia (I'm lucky enough to know
someone there), but unfortunately I haven't had time.

&gt; The site what is the resaer of the cards doesnot seam to work can someone 
&gt; tell me how to get in contact with them. Has anybody started as I am very 
&gt; interested.

I am interested too, thats why I made an effort to start the Adelaide
chapter .. :P

&gt; Any details would be great.

The best thing I can suggest at this stage, is keep an eye on
<A HREF="http://www.adelaide.air.net.au/">http://www.adelaide.air.net.au/</A>, and I'll add you to the
<A HREF="mailto:wan@adelaide.air.net.au">wan@adelaide.air.net.au</A> mail alias.

Seeya

Jamie
