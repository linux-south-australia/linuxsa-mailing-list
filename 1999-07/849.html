Greetings everyone,
          I initially joined the linux mailing list to get help when things 
get a little frustrating while I administer my system.  Of course, I haven't 
had the chance to offer a substantial help as much as most of you do.  
However, I want to express that I disagree that it is Linux that what this 
list is all about.
          There are reasons why we do things in life just like there are 
reasons why I chose linux to be my plattform.  I needed some kind of freedom 
to work with and learn from.  Linux did provide that for me.  It may not be 
the most perfect plattform, yet.  It is descent enough though from what I 
have experienced.  There is a philosophy mixed with science.  We can't just 
persue science just because it is cool or intrigueing.  There often exist a 
social value and human one to our actions.  I have heard many things about 
Bill Gates.  I personally can't pass a judgement on the man, yet.  However, 
I don't think that if someone has an opinion about a matter that is not 
really very technical, then, we shouldn't hear it hear.
          The big and macro decisions that take place every day in every 
nation effects our direction everyday.  And if I don't feel like reading a 
message in this regads, I simply delete it.  Although, it is the case often 
that I like to read a well expressed message that tries to deliver a point 
instead of just anger.  I think sociological issues can to an extent be 
discussed and I welcome them.  Ultimately, what I learn from each of you is 
not just how many uses of each command and program you can make, but also 
the way you see things.
Thank you
Nour
