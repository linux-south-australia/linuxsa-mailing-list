&gt; &gt; Does anyone here know (off the top of their head) if there is an upper limit to
&gt; &gt; the size of a file that can be used with the loop device?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Don't know for sure but I've used files of 200 Mb and more.  From memory
&gt; it was mentioned in the Mini-Howto.  It's a handy thing.

For that matter, I know I've has close to a gigabyte at times going to
the loop device.
I can't see any reason why the loop device would limit anything - it's
essentially just a pass thru thing....
So, if the filesystem you are mounting via the loop device has an upper
limit, then that would apply, of course.
And, if the file for the loop device resides on a normal partition, then
the file cannot exceed that size either. (I found this out when
recording videos to harddrive, but the harddrive was fat32 mounted under
linux...And fat32 has a 2gb filesize limit, which was annoying because
it was a 10Gb drive that was blank, and I couldn't understand why things
weren't working.)
