We had a presentation about Cabletron Spectrum, a very
good network management tool, yesterday.  Network management
tools are huge software endevours designed to track network
faults, record service levels, do capacity planning, and so on.
The market is currently grey-suit `enterprise' networks.  The
sales volume is low and the unit software price varies from
A$60,000 to $1.5M depending on the optional software selected
(which in turn depends on the size and complexity of the
network).

It runs on Windows NT and Solaris.  When asked about support
for other platforms the sales person said "no, we don't
Linux".  Which was interesting, because I didn't mention
Linux in my question.

He went on, by way of explanation, "Linux people always want
stuff for free" and "the operating system keep changing".
Also "it will cost us US$8m to port Spectrum to a new platform
and we need to get income to cover that".

I did ask what the port price was based on, and it was based
on the cost of porting the Solaris version to Win NT.

I don't want to start a debate on this list, but I thought
that you might be interested into the views of at a rather
good pre-sales engineer and his company about Linux support.

Obviously I disagree with a lot of what the pre-sales
engineer said, but couldn't really take it up in the
meeting.

Personally, I think their strategy should be the opposite.
Give the customer Spectrum on Linux preinstalled on a EIDE
hard disk.  Tell them to plug it into their standard
corporate desktop PC.  This drops the unit cost of the
server software by about $15,000, improves the hardware
support and has zero installation labour.

The result would be more customers choosing to run 
multiple copies of the server software, and thus more
revenue to Cabletron.

Linux also offers significant cost savings by commoditising
developer hardware.

The US$8m porting cost is obviously way off target.  But
it's also the type of experience that vendors don't wish to
repeat.[1]

Cheers,

[1] Which explains why their is no 64bit Solaris.  They've
    done one major hack to their OS (SunOS --&gt; Solaris)
    and never want to approach anything like the "BSD/SysV
    merge hell" ever again.  Even if the 64b hack isn't
    1% of the pain of the creation of Solaris.

    Sun did get one thing out of the BSD/SysV merge, which
    was a free SysV license (as a fair bit of the hell of the
    merge was actually getting SysV to work properly in the
    first place).  This explains why Sun is happy to give away
    Solaris, but other UNIX vendors can't (because they would
    still be paying a license on every CD).

    Looking at it this way, IBM's enthusiasm for Linux looks
    to have a more concrete business objective (beyond burning
    Microsoft for shafting them over OS/2).
