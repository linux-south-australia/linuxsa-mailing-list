I hope the following info helps.  I haven't used QoS
on Linux yet (but I'm fully expecting to be expert in
about a month's time).

The concepts are:

 QoS: quality of service

      This gets your Voice over IP or video datastream
      through other traffic.

 CoS: class of service

      This gives particular people/applications differing
      network behavior.  For example, an ISP might have
      CoSs of Gold, Silver, Bronze.

 Marketing types blatantly confuse QoS and CoS.  Mainly
 because QoS is a harder sell than CoS.  Every administrator
 wants SAP/PeopleSoft/Baan traffic to get a higher Cos,
 but they don't understand why video should have transient
 priority above their ERP traffic.

 QoS can also be negative.  For example, most IP backbones
 give IP ICMP ECHO/ECHO-RESPONSE a QoS that police out high
 levels of traffic.

 In comparison, CoS is relative to other traffic.  Consider
 the uselessness of controlling ping floods and smurfs using
 CoS.

 ToS: type of service

      The bits in the IP header, occassionally used to
      implement CoS.

And it gets worse.  The IP ToS bits are being phased out
in a semi-compatible way for bits that implement QoS
(search for IETF Differentiated Services architecture).

But supporting QoS also needs help from the link layer:
either ATM QoS (CBR, VBR, ABR, UBR) or the IEEE802.1p
priority bits.  Complicating this is that ATM can
be both a link layer and a network layer.

QoS also needs two functions: one to control the rate of
outgoing data flows ("traffic shaping") and one to control
the rate of incoming traffic flows ("traffic policing").

Traffic shaping should to be implemented as high in the
network stack as possible.  Traffic policing needs to
be implmented at all layers in the network stack.

And the final part of the archecture is authentication,
you shouldn't be able to queue-jump.

QoS is a bit like real time operating systems.
Normally you only need 'soft' realtime systems like
Linux, but when you need a `hard' realtime system
then nothing else will do.  Similarly, there can be
`soft' QoS systems that, say, don't do link layer
QoS that work perfectly fine but will never do for
the 99.999% reliability some applications need.

If you have an interest in QoS then:

 - buy Paul Ferguson and Geoff Huston's book.
   Form memory it's called "Quality of service".
   Paul (cisco US) and Geoff (telstra AU) are
   well-known IETF DiffServ members.

 - join the IETF end2end and diffserv mailing lists

 - come to the Adelaide IETF meeting next year

We are currently rolling out limited DiffServ QoS support
through AARNet for the Voice over IP project (can you say
"unlimted-time STD phone calls for $0.11ea"?).  We will
use Linux as the accounting host, test source and sink,
and DiffServ policy server.


Which leads to my question.  Does anyone know of a AU
distributor of rackmount PCs with RedHat6.0 qualified
hardware?  I'm not that interested in US distributors
as I'm currently having discussions with VA Linux
Systems about developing a PC platform for telco use
(rackmount, hotswap fans, 48VDC power option, etc,
etc).
