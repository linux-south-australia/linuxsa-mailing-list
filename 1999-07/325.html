It was on a couple of news services tonight... complete with nice
closeups of a pc & someone accessing the BOMB-MAKING sites :)
Even showed lists of chemicals etc etc on screen.... it was very well
put together ....NOT! Even had a detective saying something abt kids
having nothing better to do than look for stuff like that on the net!!

And Mark's right... the "beat-up" will continue... cos its news...and
cos some ppl still think the earth is flat !!

&gt; According to comments made by police investigators on NSW radio
&gt; earlier today, there is no credible evidence that the Internet
&gt; had anything to do with it.  It's a lead they're pursuing, but
&gt; not a particularly high investigative priority.
&gt;
&gt;  &gt; Whilst I have nothing but sympathy for the victims & their
&gt;  &gt; families, I cannot believe that the INTERNET is being blamed for
&gt;  &gt; this tragedy!! Heard some anti-internet comments already
&gt;  &gt; from some pollies abt it!!
&gt;
&gt; Yes! And some ISPs! :-)
&gt;
&gt; It's another media beat-up.  You just watch:  Every story about
&gt; rape, child abuse, explosives, racism, and sex for the next six
&gt; months will feature the Internet, even if there's absolutely no
&gt; link whatsoever between the topic under discussion and the 'net[*].
