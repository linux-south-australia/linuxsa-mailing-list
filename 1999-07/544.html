Subject:       (Fwd) The sign of the Beast.. Very Spooky


:  very weird
:
:
:        Something To Think About
:        Did you know that Bill Gates'
:        real name is William Henry Gates III?
:        Nowadays, he is known as Bill Gates (III) 
:        where III means the order of third.
:        So what's so eerie about this name?
:        Well, if you take all the letters in Bill Gates III 
:        and then convert it into ASCII code
:        (American Standard Code for Info. Interchange) 
:        and then add up all the numbers....
:        You will get 666,
:        which is the number of the beast. 
:
:        B = 66
:        I = 73
:        L = 76
:        L = 76
:        G = 71
:        A = 65
:        T = 84
:        E = 69
:        S = 83
:        I =  1
:        I =  1
:        I =  1
:
:        Add these numbers and they equal 666. 
:        Coincidence? Perhaps....
:
:        Maybe, but take Windows 95 and do the
:        same procedure and you will get 666 also. 
:        And even MS-DOS 6.31 adds up to 666.
:
:        Still think it is coincidence? 
:        Stay with me....it gets better. 
:
:        For those of you who still have the
:        old excel 95 (not office 97) try this out: 
:        (this really works)
:
:        1 - Open a new file
:        2 - Scroll down to row 95
:        3 - Click on the row 95 button to highlight the entire row 
:        4 - Press tab to move to the second column
:        5 - Now, move your mouse and click on help at the top 
:        6 - Then click on "about Microsoft excel"
:        7 - Press ctrl-alt-shift and click on the 
:        tech support button at the same time.
:        A window will appear with the title: 
:        THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS.
:        This is really eerie, okay!
:        It has a doom style format and you can walk 
:        all around the hall using the arrow keys.
:        On the sides of the walls are the 
:        names of the tortured souls....
:        Now walk up the stairs and then come back down, 
:        facing the blank wall.
:        Now type in EXCELKFA;
:        this will open the blank wall to reveal another 
:        secret passage, walk through the passage
:        and do not fall off. This is difficult to do. 
:        When you get to the end you
:        will see something really, really eerie. 
:
:        As of this point in time,
:        countless witnesses all over the world have 
:        verified that it is a real eye opener.
:        It could be a joke by MS programmers. 
:        Or is it?
:
:        Would it be too surprising if Bill Gates was the antichrist? 
:        After all, the bible fore told that someone powerful
:        would rise up and lead the world to destruction. 
:        And Bill Gates definitely has this
:        kind of power in his hands. 
:
:        More than 80% of computers in the world 
:        today run on windows and DOS
:        (including those at the Pentagon).
:        If all of his products have some kind of 
:        small program embedded, like this
:        "hall of tortured souls", that can give him 
:        control to set off nuclear arsenals,
:        create havoc in security systems and
:        financial systems all over the world, etc. 
:        All from his headquarters.
:
:        This isn't too far from reality.
:        Just by using the Internet Explorer 
:        may just allow him to map out
:       what you have on your computer
:       bit by bit each time you log on.
:       Perhaps the end of time is near and 
:       this is just the tip of the iceberg? 
:
:       Quote from the Bible:
:       "He also forced everyone, small and great, 
:       rich and poor, free and slave,
:       to receive a mark on his right hand 
:       or on his forehead,
:       so that no one could buy or
:       sell unless he had the mark,
:       which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. 
:       This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight,
:       let him calculate the number of the beast, 
:       for it is man's number.
:       His number is 666.
:       Revelation 13:16-18
:
:       This is something you should think about. 
:       If the Bible, in the book of Revelations, 
:       says that without the sign of the beast, 
:       one would not be able to buy,
:       sell, do business transactions, etc.,
:       then my question to you now is this.... 
:
:       Is the Internet a necessity today 
:       for doing business?
:       The Internet also bears the sign. 
:       Note that the Internet is often
:       referred to as the...
:       World Wide Web, or www.
:       Another way to write W is
:       V/ or VI.
:       W W W
:       VI VI VI
:       6 6 6
:
:       Here is something to ponder.
:       Isn't everything going towards the Internet?
:       (i.e., buying, selling, business transactions) 
:       Isn't Microsoft always on the move to have
:       a monopoly when it comes to software technology? 
:       And now the Internet?
:
:       Revelations also says that the mark of the beast
:       will be carved on one's hand and on one's forehead. 
:       If the Internet would indeed be the beast,
:       aren't we all starting to carry it 
:       on our hands and foreheads?
:       The screen is the forehead and 
:       the hand uses the mouse.
:
:       Are things finally starting to fall into place or 
:       are we just letting our imagination run????
:       Remember, the devil came to cheat, 
:       steal and to destroy.
:       So, be vigilant about Bill Gates and Microsoft! 
:
:       Coincidence?
:       Maybe..........maybe not
