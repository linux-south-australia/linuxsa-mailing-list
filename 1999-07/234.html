&gt; He went on, by way of explanation, "Linux people always want
&gt; stuff for free" and "the operating system keep changing".
&gt; Also "it will cost us US$8m to port Spectrum to a new platform
&gt; and we need to get income to cover that".
&gt; 
&gt; I did ask what the port price was based on, and it was based
&gt; on the cost of porting the Solaris version to Win NT.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't want to start a debate on this list, but I thought
&gt; that you might be interested into the views of at a rather
&gt; good pre-sales engineer and his company about Linux support.

	Recently, we had to mess with some software that connects to
	banking systems, and does realtime transactions. Anyway,
	the software itself runs only on NT.

	Being kinda miffed that on one hand, banks jump up and down and
	on one hand push a rigorous process of certification, to ensure that 
	your end of the software is reliable/secure/etc, while on the other hand
	they force you to use NT of all things, we took the matter up
	with the people that put the software together.

	A couple of interesting points were brought up, the main one
	basically being that Linux is evolving rather rapidly.

	Why is this a problem? Primarily from the point of view of banking
	software (and the like), the software needs to be auditted and
	validated on each and every platform it runs on. While this is
	a cinch for NT (the nature of the way NT is put together means that
	there isn't a huge difference in the software that runs on different
	hardware platforms), as soon as you take a Unix platform like linux,
	it becomes a nightmare. How many different kernel/library combinations
	are there???

	I think this problem also comes into play with software similar to 
	that mentioned above. When writing s/w for a proprietry platform
	like Solaris, you merely specify "This software runs on Solaris 2.x"
	and that's it. Anyone running Solaris 2.x has a known set of system
	libraries, a known kernel, etc etc.

	Under linux, you can be running one of a hundred different kernels,
	ghod-knows-which version of glibc, and then there's the possibility
	that you've patched things with obscure patches from hell.
	Given that commercial s/w is only distributed in binary formats,
	the potential for a particular binary to have a conflict or problem
	with whatever version libs you have installed is pretty large.
	People are either running on a platform that is too old, or
	they are so up-to-date with the latest and greatest libs, that 
	the software will have a problem with not being able to find
	a crusty old version of libXXX.so.2.2.1.

	And as soon as something doesn't work, and the user rings up to bitch
	about it, you, the software developer, have a problem. Is it your
	software, or is it the fact that the user added a patch to his
	terminal driver's ages ago, and forgot about it????
	How restrictive/specific do you need to be???

	Then there's the lack of a single, centralised, developer's resource
	for linux (Sun, SGI, M$ all have your typical "pay thru the nose"
	developers groups). Yeah, sure, there's a wealth of support out there,
	but most software companies like being able to turn to the OS 
	developer when bugged with a nasty problem, and demand an answer (the
	general idea being that the OS developer will move heaven and hell to
	find an answer to your query (because you pay them tonnes of ca$h) -
	that's the theory anyway...)
