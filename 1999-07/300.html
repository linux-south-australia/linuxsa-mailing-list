&gt; &gt; Hi all...
&gt; &gt; This is a long standing problem which I haven't ever fixed because X
&gt; &gt; runs fine as a single user workstation but the situation has arisen
&gt; &gt; where several users need access to a genome database and a modelling
&gt; &gt; program. I am hoping to use vnc to interface with W95 clients.
&gt; ...snip
&gt; 
&gt; Wrong Tool for the job
&gt; 
&gt; vnc is intended as a remote console control program, it therefore gives a
&gt; window into your consoles main X11 display. great for what it is intended for
&gt; but not what you want!
&gt; 
&gt; X11clientprogram--loopback--consoleX11server--VNCserver--eth--windowsVNCClient
&gt; 
&gt; What you need is X11 itself which was designed friom the outset as a multi user
&gt; networked display system to do just what your after. It will be much faster
&gt; than the VNC approach, possibly even faster than the console display, and one
&gt; properly configured linux/unix box can support dozens of "X terminals", be they
&gt; other unix workstations, special purpose X terminals, or windows X11 server
&gt; software.
&gt; 
&gt; X11clientprogram--eth--windowsXserver
&gt; 
&gt; To run X11 programs on your linux box and display the contents on a Windows box
&gt; you will therefore need a windows compatable X server. There are many excellent
&gt; ones out there. Most come with tools to put icons on the windows desktop to make
&gt; it all seamless for users.  Unfortunately it's been my experience that the
&gt; polished ones, like "exceed" are commercial, with limited free trials and a
&gt; purchase price of about $100 per windows seat.
&gt; 
&gt; A great companion tool for windows/X11 is terraterm with the secure shell
&gt; extensions
&gt; 
&gt; Regards
&gt; Adrian
&gt; 
&gt; ps: the X "Server" is the thing drawing on the screen (eg the windows X11
&gt; software, or the XFree86 server controlling yor console), The X client is the
&gt; thing asking the server to draw things (eg the "xeyes" program running on your
&gt; unix box).
 Thanks for your reply Adrian....

It actually may be quite suitable for the job ...

&lt;From the VNC FAQ&gt;

"Q. Can I connect multiple users to the same Windows server, and have
them
each see their own desktop, as with WinFrame, NTrigue, WTS, etc?"

"No. Windows NT has a reasonable concept of multi-user access, but not
where the GUI is concerned.  Basically, you can't do this without access
to the source code of Windows,...." 

&lt;irrelevant windows stuff deleted&gt;

"Of course, if your server is Unix-based, then you have no problem.  You
can run dozens of VNC servers on a single machine." 
 
&lt;and from another part of the FAQ&gt;

"Xvnc is basically XFree86 with the hardware-dependent bits taken out
and
VNC put in their place, so it doesn't have drivers for any graphics
cards. You could have a look at the Xvnc source code to see which bits
have been added to the standard XFree86, and make the equivalent changes
on your X server. 
We tend to run all our X sessions as VNC sessions and only use the local
X server to run the viewer.  It's very fast when on the same machine as
the server!" 

However VNC aside the problem is that I cannot run more than one X
server on the box so a remote X server like eXceed couldn't be used
either.
If I can fix this basic problem I can then sort out the VNC vs eXceed
questions you raise.

Cheers
