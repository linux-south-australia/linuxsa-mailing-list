&gt; I've written a daemon and I want it to get invoked from

&gt; "netstat -an"ed, it didnt show any LISTEN at the port

Far too much of what has been said on this topic is wrong.  First, to
start giving something which might actually answer the question, what
exactly did you put in /etc/services and in /etc/inetd.conf? The most
likely answer is a simple misconfiguration because if you did put the
right thing in both of those files, and if you did send a SIGHUP to
inetd, then netstat -an should show a LISTEN entry at that port.  Inetd
should listen even if your program doesn't exist!

Concerning what has been said that is wrong: Inetd is a simple enough
program.  Of course there are variations, but in general it creates a
socket for each service listed in inetd.conf, binds that socket to the
required address and listens for connections.  When a connection request
is made it accepts the connection, forks a new process, dups the new
socket to file descriptor 0, 1 and 2, changes to the appropriate uid
and execs the server program.  When the server exits inetd reaps (c.f.
wait()) the child.  This describes the situation for stream/tcp/nowait
services, which are the most common.

By the way: Nicely asked question.  My compliments.

David
