RE: hardware cycle times.


Alan Kennington &lt;<A HREF="mailto:akenning@dog.topology.org">akenning@dog.topology.org</A>&gt; asked:

&gt; For a while I've been planning to build a 
&gt; really nice computer for myself, to run linux,
&gt; and to be my main work computer for the next 3 years.
&gt; So it has to be good. I've been planning this for about
&gt; 11 months.

I am glad to see this topic discussed, as it is something that often
occupies too much of my time.  Having made plenty of mistakes in this
area myself, I cannot rightly be called a "Linux hardware expert", but
I can vouch a few points.

Many others have responded to the question of running your machine for
the next three years.  I think it is realistic to be expecting to use
a machine in three years time, but entirely unrealistic to purchase a
machine expressedly to run in three years time.  The real difficulty
in buying a machine is in navigating this paradox, i.e., the problem
of upgradability.

It is an exageration to characterise your plan as: purchasing a
machine to run in three years time, but it makes a point.  Firstly,
there is a huge premium paid by those that purchase the highest
performance.  For some computer components (e.g., processors and
memory) this premium is so great and the rate at which items lose this
premium is so fast, that the purchase is clearly better spread across
the three year period.  Instead of buying that pentium III 550 MHz
today, perhaps you would be able to purchase a pentium II 400 today, a
pentium III 600 next year, and a merced 1GHz in the final year.  The
average is certainly better, as is the final computer.  Secondly, the
rate at which the computer depreciates it is better to think of the
purchase price as a once off rental payment --- I think you are
suggesting this over the three year period.  Meaning, that you should
always address what you need right now rather than what you think you
will need in the future.

The problem lies in identifying the parts around which subsequent
upgrades might be most efficiently made as the need arises.  Now I am
talking purely from my own experience and opinion.

  +	monitors and printers are keepers --- the monitor, printer,
	keyboard, and mouse have perhaps the greatest impact on your
	computer experience.  Keyboards and mice are cheap and wear out
	but monitors and printers seem to hang around.  It seems
	reasonable to plow some extra into the monitor and printer;

  +	the change to the ATX type case is relatively recent wrt
	changes in cases, so perhaps a well put together case might
	persist;

  +	hard drives prices have such an exagerated sweet spot, and
	suffer such a geometric contraction in cost, that the decision
	is largely made for you --- you can pretty easily upgrade
	these; but 

  +	processor, memory, and motherboard standards and pricing seem
	to be so heavily manipulated that it is a mugs game to spend
	too much time and money trying to achieve great degrees of
	upgradability across the three --- buy the most cost effective
	version of what you need now.


Regarding sourcing parts...

&gt; 1.	"Mums and dads" store 
&gt; 	I.e. Try to get the "main street" computer
&gt; 	store to understand what I'm looking for in a
&gt; 	"linux computer".
&gt; 
&gt; 2.	Buy the parts from mail order magazines,
&gt; 	and put it together "au hazard", as the
&gt; 	French say.
&gt; 
&gt; 3.	Buy the parts from local stored, and proceed
&gt; 	as in (2).

I tend to follow avenues (2) and (3).  Sometimes there are good prices
to be found via (e)mail/phone order, but knowing the listed prices you
can often find the same parts around town for a similiar price.  The
problem with the mail order game is that you must pay the delivery
cost, which adds up if stuff needs to be returned.  So you want to get
a large number of your parts from the same supplier --- finding such a
supplier who can satisfy your own special "wish list" can be tricky
and requires lots of thought about the options.  I think I buy
computers this way because I actually enjoy this part ;-)

So (1) is actually a very good option.  As others have pointed out,
often the best Linux hardware is simply the most common hardware as
drivers will have been written!  Since (2) and (3) involve a great
deal of planning you can use the store in (1) to take on some of this
load, i.e.:

  +	make a preliminary wish list;

  +	take preliminary wish list to several stores and ask them to
	provide a rough quote against this list --- you might want to
	put some options into the list for them, e.g., "an Abit,
	AOpen, ASUS, or Gigabyte BX motherboard" might be on my list;

  +	cull stores that seem inflexible about your dreams, take
	suggestions from others and revist the WWW to find the low
	down on the proposed combinations.


I actually enjoy reading the articles at

	<A HREF="http://www.anandtech.com/">http://www.anandtech.com/</A>
	<A HREF="http://www.tomshardware.com/">http://www.tomshardware.com/</A>
	<A HREF="http://arstechnica.com/">http://arstechnica.com/</A>	

 and studying the HOWTOs.  Just take it all with a pinch of salt.



Cheers,



Andrew
