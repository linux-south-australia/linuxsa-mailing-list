Hello :)

I am in need of a utility that will download the Windows NT SAM from the BDC
or PDC and provide me with a means to convert it to the smbpasswd format.

There is a utility which does just this, called pwdump.exe, that is included
on the samba site, which runs on NT and exports the correct file, etc etc,
which I would -love- to be able to use.. but it runs on the NT machine and
requires an Administrator account called Administrator (a silly security
check - our NT network has had the Administrator account renamed for extra
"security").  So I can't use it as is.

So, I figure I have three options.

(1) Find another utility similar to pwdump.exe (anyone know any?)
(2) Modify and recompile the source to pwdump.exe to exclude the silly
"Administrator" check (I don't have a c compiler for windows - can anyone
help me here?)
(3) Figure out another way to get a Windows NT user list from the PDC/BDC
into a Linux-readable format.

The reason I'm doing all this, btw, is that I need Samba on Linux to ask
Windows NT to do user authentication..  I have samba shares on a Linux
machine that NT-authenticated users need to access.  Samba won't work unless
the usernames are in the /etc/passwd file, of course, because of file
ownership et al, and the username database is likely to be changing
frequently at the NT end.

Can anyone help me?

I've suggested removing the NT machines altogether, BTW, but it would have
to go through the board and we have lots of existing infrastructure :(  But
I'm working on it *grin*

Thankyou all :)
