Hi all.... a week or so ago a few of us were discussing FreeBSD.... ...
at the risk of being labelled Heretic or Philistine .....I picked up the
"Complete FreeBSD 2nd Edition" at lunchtime on my way home!  I am  now
looking at KDE running under freeBSD.

The install process is very similar to slackware, in fact it "feels"
like slackware actually..... Installation was a breeze & to be honest I
did NOT even RTFM - not even a textfile :)  just loaded up the first CD
& looked for a directory with floppy images in it :) Found it... its
called boot.flp  - so dd'd the image onto a floppy & away it went....
The similarities between Linux & FreeBSD are many so installation was no
drama.... mind you, the way they identify hard-drives is painful...
/dev/wd1s0  or something like that..will take some getting used too...
but hell, I can speak english, indonesian(badly) & german (adequately)
so dont see why I can't  dabble in Linux & FreeBSD :)

You may recall I posted comments abt adaptec aha152x scsi cards &
related cdroms recently...Iwell that is the box I wanted to put FreeBSD
on  and I was expecting to have to rip out the scsi stuff & stick in an
IDE CDROM  but no probs whatsover.  PC is a 486dx2/66 with 16Mb ram & a
540Mb & 162Mb HDD .... at present the 162Mb HDD is untouched. There's a
42Mb swap file on /dev/hda (except its not called that :) ) and that
drive still has abt 90Mb free.

The FreeBSD wont replace my main linux boxes BUT it is another toy to
play with and at least its a *NIX  :))

BTW, the "ports" package seems to contain a montsrous collection of
linux stuff.... anyway, back to exploring!!

Cya, Phil
