Mark,

As an on-list response to that, when I fetched the latest perl
source from <A HREF="http://www.perl.com">http://www.perl.com</A> and re-built/installed it,
and then re-made the perl/Tk source, the result was
astonishingly good -- the demos had me saying "wow" about
40-50 times (I lost count) in about 10 minutes.
It's a really neat GUI API.

So the answer is that, yes, the redhat 5.2 perl is a "broken"
pre-alpha distribution that should never have been issued on
redhat disks.

Since this is purportedly fixed with redhat 6.0, I guess this
is just historical interest now, except for anyone
who still has redhat 5.2 and wants to install perl/tk.

About the Cisco router modem re-training bug, it was indeed the
Cisco router software, but Cisco apparently said that
there wasn't enough money in it to be worth fixing.
I guess 24 hr/day modems will be passe' in a couple of years
anyway.

By the way, BusinessWeek 12 July 1999 says that 
Cisco is the number 9 business in the world in 1999,
as opposed to 30 in 1998. It's current market value is 
US$174.09 gigadollars, compared to US$63.89gig in place 62,
up from place 128 last year. MS is in first place, up from second
place last year. IBM is in 3rd position, up from 13th.
Compaq is in 102nd place at US$40.27gig, down from 82nd place.
Yahoo: 148th place, US$29.45gig, up from 834rd place.
Amazon.com: 254th place, US$18.91gig, debut.

Now I know why investors in the US are nervous about
IT stocks -- if the bubble bursts, it will bring the
whole economy down. And who will get the blame? The Internet!

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.

PS. The redhat 5.2 perl thing does raise the question of whether
redhat do just include the latest build of other software too,
in an effort to get the latest and best, without
waiting for "stability".
