&gt; A while ago (quite a while ago),
&gt; I suggested that Linux SA try a
&gt; newsgroup, i.e. instead of the
&gt; present mailing list...
&gt;
&gt; Why?
&gt;
&gt; For one thing, we seem to like to use
&gt; "Reply to All" when firing back replies
&gt;
&gt; This causes TWO copies of the reply
&gt; (one with and one without the Linux SA
&gt; mailing-list .sig file attached) to arrive
&gt; as the originator's e-mail address is
&gt; also used - on the reply - as one of the
&gt; destination addresses.
&gt;
&gt; Also, a mailing-list - like the trendy new
&gt; "push" technologies around - "force"
&gt; one to receive all of the stuff sent by
&gt; anyone else on the list...
&gt;
&gt; Of course, a newsgroup lets one see
&gt; - up front - the subject line, i.e. before
&gt; deciding whether to download/read
&gt; a message...
&gt;
&gt; Since we have a tradition to uphold
&gt; (or Netcraft does, as keeper of the
&gt; Lniux SA archive...), I suppose that
&gt; the mailing-list is set in concrete,
&gt; so to speak...
&gt;
&gt; But, is it possible that the list's
&gt; re-mailer could be re-worked,
&gt; i.e. so that it strips off all of the
&gt; destination addresses, leaving
&gt; just Linux SA's adr in place...
&gt;
&gt; so that we each get ONE copy
&gt; of anything posted (as we would
&gt; do if the newsgroup model were
&gt; used)?
&gt;
&gt; That *is* one of the benefits of
&gt; having the source-code isn't it?
&gt;
&gt; Or, am I wrong...?  If so,
&gt; What am I missing?
&gt;
&gt; (The technical change that
&gt; I'm suggesting should not
&gt; limit Free Speech in any way
&gt;
&gt; nor should it force anybody
&gt; to fiddle manually - as I often do -
&gt; with the destination addresses
&gt; of their outgoing replies...
&gt;
&gt; It should just minimize the no.
&gt; of copies that we all receive
&gt; of Linux SA's gems & hot coals
&gt; that come our way... as well as
&gt; minimize bandwidth consumption
&gt; slightly... ;)
&gt;
&gt; What'cha think?
&gt;
If LinuxSA goes newsgroup ?

That many people like my self will not be able to follow the flow of 
information on this list. Unfortunally my employer looks upon newsgroups as 
a not desierd way to retrive information of ANY kind. And hawe therfore 
blocked access to all news groups. (We are like 500 employees sharing a 
64Kbs line... :-(  ) While e-mail finaly (last week) whas defined as 
business critical. In other worrds: Keep up the mailinglist and I, a egoist 
litle foreigner ;-), will be able to follow the wast flow of info. If 
convertet to news group I will be cut of :-( ...

Something that I would regret a lot. This is the abseloutely best source of 
information on spesific problems I've found. And it is vital to my progress 
of learning Linux. (Was that a big enough teardripping argument??? ;-) )

Anyway I hope LinuxSA stays the way it is and that it will continue to 
grow.

Best regards from Jo.
