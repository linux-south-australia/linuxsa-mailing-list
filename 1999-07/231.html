Hi Ben et al...

I hate to state the obvious :)  but if probing your video card causes a
serious lockup... then the obvious solution is to NOT probe it & everything
will be fine.  Unless REDHAT-6.00 has changed XF86Setup/xf86config,  the
"don't probe" option will be there,  and its there for the exact reason you
are having probs....because sometimes some video cards DO cause lockups
when probed!

I have had cards which probed ok under 1 linux distro but not another......
I have also had video cards that only sometimes locked up when probed!!
Just bypass the probe & 99% of the time X is fine!

As to why it happens... I presume you have heard of Murphy's Law...well
meet my mate O'Toole  :)

Cheers , Phil

PS:  O'Toole's Law..... Murphy was an Optimist :)

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; Just a quickie regarding rehat 6.0 and my diamond viper330. Im am trying
&gt; to install redhat 6.0 with X and whenever i launch xconfig or setup to
&gt; set up X-windows .. it detects my card ok, but then when it tries to
&gt; probe for video chipsets etc.. it fails .. with no signal, my monitor
&gt; goes black and i can't get back into any shell at all. I then have
&gt; reboot to be able to get back into linux.
&gt;
&gt; I have never had this problem before even with redhat 5.2. redhat never
&gt; had a problem with my viper before ... but now with version 6.0 its
&gt; acting very weird.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone else had similar problems????
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance.
