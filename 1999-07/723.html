G'day Alan,

I'm not really a hardware guru.  

When we bought our last server (I think it was in February or March),
it was from a place in Victor Harbor named All-Biz.  

I was impressed that they honoured our request that we did NOT want
Windows installed on it.  They also provided a network card that was
ISA instead of PCI mainly because they felt the PCI one wouldn't work
with our Linux set up. However, we were able to explain that Red Hat
5.2 could handle it and they swapped cards with us without a problem. 

The fact they were fairly knowledgeable (if just a little out of date
in terms of the Linux kernal at the time) was pretty impressive. 

Perhaps others can list good experience with other stores too?

 &gt; For a while I've been planning to build a 
 &gt; really nice computer for myself, to run linux,
 &gt; and to be my main work computer for the next 3 years.
 &gt; So it has to be good. I've been planning this for about
 &gt; 11 months.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Problem:
 &gt; I can't quite work out how the real experts, the in-crowd,
 &gt; make up computers. There seem to be these options:
 &gt; 
 &gt; 1.	"Mums and dads" store 
 &gt; 	I.e. Try to get the "main street" computer
 &gt; 	store to understand what I'm looking for in a
 &gt; 	"linux computer".
 &gt; 
 &gt; 2.	Buy the parts from mail order magazines,
 &gt; 	and put it together "au hazard", as the
 &gt; 	French say.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 3.	Buy the parts from local stored, and proceed
 &gt; 	as in (2).
 &gt; 
 &gt; 4.	Find some fanatic who wakes up thinking about
 &gt; 	linux hardware compatibility tables first
 &gt; 	thing every morning and knows what voltage
 &gt; 	is on every wire in the whole computer.
 &gt; 
 &gt; 5.	Find some store that employs person in (4), and
 &gt; 	get them to build it.
 &gt; 
 &gt; If I wanted MS wind98 or whatever, I'd go to the
 &gt; local store. But in the past, this has yielded
 &gt; computers with bits that don't work with linux 
 &gt; (ethernet card, video card...)
 &gt; 
 &gt; Could anyone (preferably not on the list) send me
 &gt; a brief idea of what is the best way to proceed?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Absolutely best for me would be to discover
 &gt; that there's a store in town with all of the components
 &gt; that I can just buy and put together, with some helpful
 &gt; advice from an expert store owner.
 &gt; 
 &gt; But I can't even work out how I would buy a 
 &gt; yeong yang case. Obviously it would be big cost and
 &gt; effort to import something from Taiwan or the US.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Cheers,
 &gt; Alan Kennington.
