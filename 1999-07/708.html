Hi all,

I know I am a big mouth myself at times, just ask Richard Sharpe about a
discussion awhile ago about MAC addresses.

But I must say that C4IS has gone a little overboard.

C4IS, this is a Linux list, how about putting some Linux info on (100% true
or false doesn't matter) it. Instead of just criticising (like I am doing
now) add content.

Help us, don't hinder us! This goes for me too, don't worry, I am not just
nitpicking against you!!!!

Let people have their C64's, did you know there are several emulators and at
least 1 flavour of linux (not sure which one) has a C64 emulator with the
distro.

Frankly, C4IS, we don't give a damn what your opinion of the C64 is. Some
people still love it and good on them for sticking with it, it is a good
machine.

As for the Library notion, have you ever tried to get on them ? I think,
perhaps NOT!

Thanks.

Rob.

Most stuff deleted as we have read it before.

P.S. Who do you pick on next, The List, Netcraft for putting on the list,
people with C64's who still want to use them, I suppose babies who cry is
pretty annoying to you and should be sued as well ?!??!
