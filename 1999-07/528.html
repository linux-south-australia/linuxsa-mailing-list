&gt;&gt; Possible answers include:
&gt;&gt; 1:  a lack of LUGs and Linux Mailing Lists in these countries
&gt;&gt; 2:  LUGs & LMLs are hard to find in these countries
&gt;
&gt;There are plenty of (in fact, too much) LUGs here, but, they are not
&gt;mature yet. . .
&gt;We are a small country, with few linux users

As a matter of curiosity, where are you Joao?

&gt; you can't expect to get the same kind of support
&gt; from a mailing list of 30 or 40 people,
&gt; when compared to a mailing list of 500 people

Good point... this rule works for even larger LML's

&gt; (is it???).


Good question... since the list is maintained,
albeit automatically, by a local Linux reseller,
it becomes - like a customer or prospect list -
a bit guarded... at least, I have not seen any
way to access the list of members... so far.

Presumably, our wondering about it will open
the door to negotiations on opening the mem-
ber (i.e. e-mail adr) list...  ;)

&gt;The local lists are very useful to solve local problems,
&gt; namely related to the language.


I would suppose that another area of local knowledge
might be how to set Linux up for each of the local ISPs.

&gt;&gt; 3:  the subscribers are ex-adelaidians, or visited at some stage, so
&gt;&gt; this is the natural point of contact
&gt;&gt; 4:  The LinuxSA list, or (South) Australians in general have a good
&gt;&gt; international Linux reputation, and people gravitate to LinuxSA to
&gt;&gt; absorb the guruness.


Marketing...  ;)

&gt;This is also true. I subscribe linuxsa for more than a year now, and
&gt;people here know a bit (or even a lot) of everything.
&gt;
&gt;I don't thing local groups need any kind of special support. I think
&gt;that (for me) things are very good the way they are, as long as linuxSA
&gt;is willing to receive my questions and opinions.

I sort of agree... like newsgroups, one should be free to come & go
as one will...

There is need - e.g. by local resellers & consultants (is SA) - of
people (here) willing to help generate business on Linux-based
systems; I sometimes wonder if at least *some* of the periodic
"where can I get RedHat Linux x.x?" type questions are meant
to generate sales (initial & follow-on) for the local Linux reseller,
even when there are others (in Australia) who may be price-
competitive... or stock a broader range of products... we're
used to "deli's" here, so it's not so surprising...

If non-Adelaide people (especially from other lands) care to let
an Adelaide-firm get most of the air-time, e.g. rather than help-
ing to grow their own local suppliers, so be it.

For me, "Think Global, Act Local" make more sense, at least
in the long run... so, you might like to keep a foot in more than
one puddle (if local conditions preclude Linux growing into a
pond, at the moment...), just to help *your* local Linux market
grow, provided, of course that it's doing so in a competitive
manner...  ;)

BTW, why not a hierarchy of Linux info sources:

  Global:     Long-term planning (who's porting to Linux),
                   new version announcements, etc.

  Regional: Cross-Pollination (not every 'local' does everything),
                    Designing & Building new software (in small groups),
                    Telecommutor-style Consultants/Dev'rs (e.g. via I'net)

  Local:       Resellers & Consultants, HowTo connect to &lt;local-ISP&gt;?
                    Install-Fests (preferably, on *locally* convenient
dates,
                    altho there is a move afoot to 'march-in-step' with
these),
                    Technical/Social contacts or cooperative ventures:

                    - pooling resources to buy software or books together;

                     1. OpenBSD sells to ANYONE for 40% less when
                     just 20 buy it together.  Even a small LUG should be
                    able to get that kind of ordering quantity, as standing
                    orders for major releases of the product, i.e. rather
                    than having to manually reproduce CD-ROM's onto
                    unlabelled, mastering-blanks from slow, local burners)

                    With enough LUG interest (and some support from
                    organisations like LI), Linux could develop a similar
                    tradition, rather than watching prices almost double
                    (will "real" Linux distributions someday cost $1,000?)

                    2. O'Reilly books come cheap (e.g. from US distribu-
                    tors) if purchased in larger batches, i.e. much less
than
                    Amazon.com & FatBrain.com 1-off pricing...

                   Both are - after all - becoming "commodity products"
                   (at least, in Linux / *BSD circles); that brings prices
DOWN,
                    as anybody knows who gets to bookshops in Wash-
                    ington, DC, et al. where local high-tech communities
                    gobble up quantities of this kind of product after each
                    new release.
