&gt; around Christmas time,
&gt; C4IS was ridiculing us for supporting C= users
&gt; with our Linux system

C4IS simply pointed out that it is *unfair* to
help people have the limited level of Internet-
access that a Commodore 64 provides IMHO.

For the record, there was no problem with
your use of a Linux, & it is unfortunate that
that you would mention Linux by way of jus-
tifying another apparently commercial
post on Linux SA (if you want to be com-
mercial, just prefix the title with COMMERCIAL,
per GDB's recent instruction... not that I've
seen all posts from GDB and/or NetCraft
that have commercial content applying that
rule consistently, but I digress...  ;)

It is bad enough that there are people
who have never had a well-rounded
"look at & surf of" the Internet are being
"spoon-fed" anti-technology propaganda
by local media (c.f. an article quoting
Amanda Vanstone that seemed to
blend the concept of Hacker into
Computer Criminal, before quoting
a Brisbane police officer on the
dangers of electronic organisers -
Advertiser 15 Jun 99 p. 26 "Minister
warms of hacker dangers")...

but when I'net users - who:

 - enjoy full 'net access (e.g. using Linux, et al.)
 - know how much there is to be learned from
   the Internet

continue to support (if not promote) the kind
of "limiting" technologies (here, I include any
C64-only 'net access configurations)...

I think they are helping to create a
similarly "Internet underclass"...

This is even more true today, when
e.g. a '486 with 20+ Mb of RAM and
enough Hard Drive for a 32-bit op sys
and browser, as well as multi-media
features can be seen for under $300
(one of Cash Converters' overpriced
systems, IMHO).

I say:

rather than spending human time
"helping" people learn how to use
8-bit technologies for e-mail, etc.
why not help them use 32-bit boxes
that - these days - cost about the
same and Linux, that this list is
about?

Go figure...  ;)

Wasn't Mathew Tippett going to
address a group of your users?

If so, perhaps Matt can tell us how
usable, for Internet access, the
Commodor 64 that would have
been shown to him on the night...  ;)

&lt;subtly-commercial tail is omitted
  without comment&gt;
