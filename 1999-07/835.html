For anybody that cares about taking Internet
to the Bush, et al. - here's a job that may suit:

SA Dep't for Admin & Info Services
  Info Economy Policy Office

is apparently seeking a Project Manager

to "advise Gov't of opportunities avail. for SA's
growth as an info & knowledge empowered society"

[Not that this "empowered" society will be permitted
 to shop in large, well-stocked supermarkets after 7 pm
 most nights of the week... but... I digress...  ;)  ]

A bit further down in the large display ad, we
see:

The Project Mgr reports to ... managing the
process of increasing Internet usage in rural
homes and facilitating rural community and
rural small business adoption of the Internet
across South Australia.

[Didn't I just read that Internet Gambling
 is to get "the big nod" any day now...?
 but... again, I digress...]

This is a partnership project with the Federal
Gov't's Networking the Nation program.

Salary in the range $ 56,401 - 61,221 / annum.

(Full Details on page 2 of Sat. Advertiser's
Employment Section)

Go for it!  ;)

PS I have rec'd the Job & Person spec's
for the above position and - so that you
won't think that lack of an education will
keep you out of a nice-paying SA gov't
job:

the "Educational/Vocational Qualifications"
(per Commissioner's Determination No. 27)
"as an essential qualification for the speci-
fied classification group" is - as expected - NIL.

PS Maybe they're looking for a farmer (or some other
country person); hopefully, one with Common Sense.  ;)
