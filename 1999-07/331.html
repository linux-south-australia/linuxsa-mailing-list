&gt; The difference is that books are usually screened before a library puts
&gt; them on loan although that one is a bit odd.  Depends how long ago you
&gt; were 12.  Things like this were less of a concern years ago to the point
&gt; where a guy I know who is now in his sixties could, as a 12 year old,
&gt; walk into the local explosives store in Broken Hill with his friends and
&gt; buy gelignite, 25 feet of fuse and a box of detonators.  They would make
&gt; bangalor torpedoes and go and blow the crap out of the local rubbish
&gt; dump.  The trouble with the internet is that any bastard can put up any
&gt; recipes which are of dubious quality and sometimes some that are
&gt; designed to explode in the face of the maker.  The internet is the only
&gt; way that type of info can be accessed easily by many.  The question
&gt; about porn affecting children is one thing, getting themselves blown up
&gt; is getting a bit more serious.  The only way to deal with this without
&gt; the crap being proposed is to have international co-operation and
&gt; sensible censorship rules.  Now if you think that wouldn't be a circus.

books that helped me with my explosives phase, about 17 odd years ago (i
am mostly better now;)  ), were all from library. do we encourage book
burning next?
also, what is regarded as pornographic does not always remain that
way..several important novels have been regarded as pornographic during
their intial releases, but hailed as masterpieces and taught to children
later on in their lifespan. books unacceptable in the fifties became
classics later on, in the seventies onwards.
the definition of pornography then becomes the interesting thing.
personally, i find ultra violent games and movies quite disgusting. 
so i dont watch them, nor let my children near them.

just my 0010 cents worth:)
