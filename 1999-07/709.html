&gt; This is getting off the track a bit isn't it?
&gt; 
&gt; How is this helping the Linux community with you two fighting over
&gt; human rights.

It doesn't have to help the Linux Community to be interesting. If you
don't like the thread, then hit delete and move on.  Please don't ask
people to modify their conversation because it doesn't fit in with
your idea of what the list should be. The list is what it's members
make it, both you and everyone else.

Personally I prefer off topic irrelevant rants and flames to "Is this
relevenat" posts" any day. Of course that's just my opinion, feel free
to disagree.

&gt; There must be a list server/group for you to discuss that argument
&gt; there?
&gt; 
&gt; New Linux user looking to learn Linux.....

And learn you will. Linux isn't all ones and zeros, and neither is
this list.

Advocay and the Linux community are all part of the big picture.

(Hmm... Maybe "black and white" would be better than "ones and zeros",
cause no doubt someone will mention that an email *is* ones and zeros.
Alternatively, you'll just know what I mean.)
