Subject: linux weekend course in Adelaide?????


&gt;A linux training course in Adelaide.
&gt;
&gt; &lt;snip&gt; a full weekend course,
&gt; possibly semi-residential at some
&gt; hide-away in the hills,
&gt; that has a good internet connection
&gt;and lots of room to set up, say, about 20 PC, ethernetted.


Another thought on "Where?"

I don't know anything about
its price or present conditions,
but there is at least one camp
(Mylor Baptist Camp) up there
that could (if it is as it was when
I last saw it, or better... ;) handle
up to all of Linux SA's average
meeting numbers.

And - if the overnight/residential
aspect would push the cost be-
yond the abilities of the hobbyists
to pay for the whole thing - here's
another nice  place:

  Fullarton Community House

(not in the Hills, but in a nice
little reserve on Fullarton Road,
I believe; surrounded by trees,
it has a nicely done up (wood)
"largish" room or two that can
be rented "cheap" by the hour
(for Fri night & Sun's wind-up)
or by the day (for Sat).

Kitchen optional... surely some-
enterprising individual or organi-
sation (pos'ly commercial) would
be willing to supply salads & sand-
wiches or pizzas - in qty - for a
price (maybe cheaper by the dozen
- talk a deal... ;)

Or, if there're any gov't facilities
(mil. or state or local) available
at modest cost... this is the time
to ask for them (and maybe even
get them "cheap")... just remind
them that the Y2K is coming...  ;)

In Sweden, the sea is considered
an equally terrific place for such
learning conferences.  Are there any
members of, say, the Royal Yacht
Squadron (North Haven) that can
get us into that spacious place?
