I think you'll find that TAB does a similar thing in bash.
Press TAB once, and it'll try to complete your command, or filename. If
there's more than one possibility, it'll complete it as far as it can,
and then stop. If you press TAB again, it'll list all the possibilities.

&gt; One interesting trick for new to linuxers, run tcsh, type a letter and press
&gt; control D. This has the effect of finding all command starting with the
&gt; letter you typed that are on your path.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason this is so cool, is that you can find all these terrific commands
&gt; which you may not find by looking. Once you find commands, read the man
&gt; pages, this will increase you Linux knowledge by major leaps and bounds.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that this doesn't work with any other shell AFAIK, it may work with csh
&gt; not sure, def not in sh.
&gt; 
&gt; Have a go...

&gt; &gt;rajah,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way is the figures are actually in KB's or MB's ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The advice given to you, specifically read the manual page by using the
&gt; &gt;command, "man df", was not an idle suggestion.  I dare say everyone here
&gt; &gt;welcomes you as a new user of Linux; we all love to hear from recent
&gt; &gt;converts.  There are some things you need to know and the single most
&gt; &gt;valuable of them is that the documentation is your friend.  A related
&gt; &gt;point is that we can't read the doco for you, and you'll never get the
&gt; &gt;hang of things if you don't do this for yourself.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;A quick tour of the documentation, and I mean blindingly quick so don't
&gt; &gt;blink, follows:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The standard source for information on flavours of Unix is the "man"
&gt; &gt;command.  Type "man man" for details.  To help find the name of a command
&gt; &gt;which does something use the "-k" option of man.  For example, to find
&gt; &gt;commands relating to text editors try "man -k editor".  Each page in
&gt; &gt;the manual is stored in a separate file, and sometimes you can find what
&gt; &gt;you are looking for most quickly by searching through all pages.
&gt; &gt;Depending on the flavour Unix the pages are in /usr/man, or /var/man,
&gt; &gt;or /usr/share/man.  Look around and you'll find them.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Linux comes with some pretty good tutorials on different topics.  These
&gt; &gt;are known as "HOWTOs".  There are a lot of HOWTOs, and they are kept in
&gt; &gt;/usr/doc/HOWTO.  They are usually compressed using gzip, so display them
&gt; &gt;using zcat and pipe the output into more (or less).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There is often a swag of "other" good documentation which lives in
&gt; &gt;/usr/doc.  On some Unixes this might be /var/doc.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;The GNU people, who pioneered the philosophy free software, don't like
&gt; &gt;to use man pages for a reason which I cannot fathom.  Maybe they also
&gt; &gt;pioneer the "not invented here" syndrome, which is bad.  Anyway, they
&gt; &gt;like "info" pages.  I urge you to ignore info pages and to never write
&gt; &gt;one, and to read them as a last resort if you have to.  Info pages are
&gt; &gt;displayed using the "info" command and they live in /usr/info.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Finally--and this is not intended as criticism--but is given in the
&gt; &gt;spirit that there are things everyone needs to know, don't ask questions
&gt; &gt;on the list until after you tried to find the answer for yourself.  If
&gt; &gt;you indicate what you have tried when you ask a question you'll likely
&gt; &gt;receive a positive and helpful response.  For example, ``how do I connect
&gt; &gt;to my ISP'' might not be answered (if you are lucky), or might earn you
&gt; &gt;a weekend in hell (more likely).  Such a question is somewhat brainless,
&gt; &gt;gives little for anyone to go on, and silently screams that the person
&gt; &gt;who asked it did nothing to help him or herself.  A better question,
&gt; &gt;``According to the ISP-Hookup-HOWTO I should put my PAP password in the
&gt; &gt;/etc/ppp/pap-secrets file, which I've done.  When I try to connect the
&gt; &gt;modem hangs up and the log file shows "rcvd [LCP ConfRej id=0x1 &lt;mru
&gt; &gt;1500&gt; &lt;auth pap&gt; &lt;magic 0x9078af14&gt; &lt;pcomp&gt; &lt;accomp&gt;]"  What have I done
&gt; &gt;wrong?'' is likely to earn you enormous respect because it shows that
&gt; &gt;you made effort to find the answer for yourself.  Obviously few questions
&gt; &gt;will be as detailed as this because if you know about PAP and ConfRej
&gt; &gt;you'll be able to work out the whole problem for yourself.  Still, go
&gt; &gt;as far by yourself as you can and people will be delighted to help.
