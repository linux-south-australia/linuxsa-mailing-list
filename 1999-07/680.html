&gt; Don't forget that the power is in the information, not the gee-wiz
&gt; graphics. Lynx is cool for cutting to the chase and forgetting about
&gt; the eye candy. I'll bet you could use lynx from a C64. Gaelyne?

Hear hear!!

A 100% total agreement from me there!  That statement is truly profound.
Thankyou for making it :)

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; around Christmas time,
&gt; &gt;&gt; C4IS was ridiculing us for supporting C= users
&gt; &gt;&gt; with our Linux system
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; C4IS simply pointed out that it is *unfair* to
&gt; &gt; help people have the limited level of Internet-
&gt; &gt; access that a Commodore 64 provides IMHO.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; For the record, there was no problem with
&gt; &gt; your use of a Linux, & it is unfortunate that
&gt; &gt; that you would mention Linux by way of jus-
&gt; &gt; tifying another apparently commercial
&gt; &gt; post on Linux SA (if you want to be com-
&gt; &gt; mercial, just prefix the title with COMMERCIAL,
&gt; &gt; per GDB's recent instruction... not that I've
&gt; &gt; seen all posts from GDB and/or NetCraft
&gt; &gt; that have commercial content applying that
&gt; &gt; rule consistently, but I digress...  ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It is bad enough that there are people
&gt; &gt; who have never had a well-rounded
&gt; &gt; "look at & surf of" the Internet are being
&gt; &gt; "spoon-fed" anti-technology propaganda
&gt; &gt; by local media (c.f. an article quoting
&gt; &gt; Amanda Vanstone that seemed to
&gt; &gt; blend the concept of Hacker into
&gt; &gt; Computer Criminal, before quoting
&gt; &gt; a Brisbane police officer on the
&gt; &gt; dangers of electronic organisers -
&gt; &gt; Advertiser 15 Jun 99 p. 26 "Minister
&gt; &gt; warms of hacker dangers")...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; but when I'net users - who:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  - enjoy full 'net access (e.g. using Linux, et al.)
&gt; &gt;  - know how much there is to be learned from
&gt; &gt;    the Internet
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; continue to support (if not promote) the kind
&gt; &gt; of "limiting" technologies (here, I include any
&gt; &gt; C64-only 'net access configurations)...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think they are helping to create a
&gt; &gt; similarly "Internet underclass"...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; This is even more true today, when
&gt; &gt; e.g. a '486 with 20+ Mb of RAM and
&gt; &gt; enough Hard Drive for a 32-bit op sys
&gt; &gt; and browser, as well as multi-media
&gt; &gt; features can be seen for under $300
&gt; &gt; (one of Cash Converters' overpriced
&gt; &gt; systems, IMHO).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I say:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; rather than spending human time
&gt; &gt; "helping" people learn how to use
&gt; &gt; 8-bit technologies for e-mail, etc.
&gt; &gt; why not help them use 32-bit boxes
&gt; &gt; that - these days - cost about the
&gt; &gt; same and Linux, that this list is
&gt; &gt; about?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Go figure...  ;)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Wasn't Mathew Tippett going to
&gt; &gt; address a group of your users?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If so, perhaps Matt can tell us how
&gt; &gt; usable, for Internet access, the
&gt; &gt; Commodor 64 that would have
&gt; &gt; been shown to him on the night...  ;)
