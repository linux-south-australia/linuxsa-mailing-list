Subject: Re: Linux Install Fest?


&gt; Perhaps c4is try being grounded in a little reality
&gt; instead of baiting organisers

I simply suggested that "behind closed doors"
planning was out-of-character for Linux-ists... &

that it would be good to focus on local needs
(local to include country SA and the bush...)

If that is, for you, grounds for the label "baiting"
have it your way...  ;)

(I can claim to have had some positive effect,
since you have asked for input/suggestions,
as well as revealing at least one of the
here-to-fore behind the scenes planners...)

&gt; Organising an installfest takes time,
&gt; enough helpers on hand to assist
&gt; newbies, a suitable venue & equipment.


All the more reason to get people on-board
(e.g. with their ideas, suggestions, etc.) early


... which you have now done. &lt;Applause&gt;

&gt; And perhaps, c4is, you who are a 'mere consumer'

Another label which, of course, I find inappropriate
(real consumers would be quite happy to wait
e.g. for Matt's "embargo" to end... and then
queue to do what they're told...
without comment or other involvement)

Anyway... I have not been to any of our Install Fests

(Wouldn't my earlier comments position me as
one who who, altho detached, has opinions &
uses his Freedom of Speech to express them?)

'nuff said on that...  ;)

&gt; might like to make more constructive comments

Exactly!  That's what I was saying:

Other Linux SA-ers (myself among them) might like
to be involved now... i.e.

   embargos preclude involvement

Anyway, we seem to agree (mostly) that
input from the list is now welcome... so,
let's focus on that input... ;)

&gt; such as, "It would be good to have a tutorial on..."

  Tutorial, perhaps, along with a very clear *hand-out* on:

     Getting Linux - off the 'net - onto a bare hard-drive

     (people ask this often and might like to see it done
     "Live & In-Color" and receive a How To on a floppy
     reminding them - in excrutiating detail - what they saw)

&gt; or even, "I've got some ideas on
&gt; how we could set up an installfest
&gt; at Marree or Cooper Pedy"


Here, I must admit some ignorance... I've not travelled
as much as I'd like to such interesting places...

I.e. I wouldn't be the right one to offer *detailed*
suggestions (which community centre to try, etc.)

My suggestion would be:  You guys at Netocrat
might like to look at your mail-order customer-list
for those in country areas... and - in your next
newsletter (you *do* market via newsletter, don't you?
If not now, when...?) to all customers - you could
*feature* Netcraft's involvement in "Take Linux Bush"
and win the hearts of (and, hopefully, more business
from) your country/bush resident customers...

and/or increase business (even if slightly) by
your presence at each of the (future) Bush Installs

See... it's easy to visualise... ;)

&gt; As the person who assist in the catering arrangements, etc.

Ah yes, feminist traditions have apparently not come to
our local high-tech world... (just kidding...
it may be for the best that you take on these matter... ;)

&gt; at these installfests, I would welcome constructive suggestions.


Well, I could only generalise from a local Folk Music Coffeehouse
(from the city in which I went to uni.) - created by a woman archi-
tech (who could play a mean cello, BTW):

For their monthly (alcohol-free, acoustic music) events, members
each made something to bring:  Hot soup (it was a cold climate)
and soft, moist cakes were the most popular.

But, again, I'd vote for taking contact with locals in a country-
centre and try to find out what their local specialties might be.

(Around the Barossa - a place that could be a fair compromise
for some city dwellers - there's a little bakery that has Bee Sting
Cake, et al.)

Personally, I wouldn't mind if some city money was spent
in the place at which a country/bush install were held...

Or if people who could took along their old hand-me-downs
to give away (remember the Computer Bank project?
This might be one way to give it expression in SA)

Or, better, mix a "Linux goes Bush" Installfest with some
local (even commercial, if necessary) computer swap-
meet (like Trade Shows are mixed with Conferences).

Oh, one more source of technical interest and - hope-
fully - expertise might be the Amateur Radio Clubs,
of which there might be some about... older people,
perhaps, but they just might be willing to share their
favorite community/church hall (for a modest price)
for something that might do some good for the
local community (both in the short & long term)...

Well, that's *my* input... Glad you asked (are you?)

I'm sure that others might have more to add to it...
i.e. now that the "committee" has opened it up to
suggestions from the floor... ;)
