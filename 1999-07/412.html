My 5c worth.

I don't believe that reading all the pages over a couple of nights to be too
helpfull. By the time you have finished say the D sections then most of A
would be pushed out of the brain. As the scientist say we can only hold on
average 7 bits of information in the brain at one time.

If this is true then reading all the documentation at once is basically akin
to reading the last sections anyway.

I recommend, read what you need. If you have some spare time maybe peruse
another couple of command and USE them. Reading retension is less than doing
retension (oops sorry about the lack of any form of grammar here).

Read a page as Jakes says, yeah, usually there are bugs and caveats down the
bottom which might be missed, but don't be fooled into going where you don't
need to go.

As a home sysadmin, yeah is fun to know all the commands, but if you don't
use them everyday, you will be looking them up again anyway.

Rob.

P.S. Please feel free to disagree with anything said here.

&gt;&gt; &gt; That's dumb. What I do is read the table of contents, i.e. look at the
&gt;&gt; &gt; command names and do a man on any that I'm not familiar with.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Not really.  I think I can guarantee there was a time when, if you had
&gt;&gt; read the table of contents, you would have been unfamiliar with every
&gt;&gt; command.  Reading the manual, from a to z, and from section 1 to 8, is
&gt;&gt; not so hard.  A few nights light reading.  You don't have to sit an
&gt;&gt; exam at the end! but it's surprising how much you will retain, and
&gt;&gt; how good your understanding of Unix will be afterwards.  I highly
&gt;&gt; recommend it.  (Except the section on X programming.  That's boring.)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;as a happy medium, once I start reading a man page - I usually finish
&gt;it. Or at least skip on down the whole page looking for anything else
&gt;interesting. That way, subconcoiusly, you know where the information is.
&gt;So when the man page starts talking about return values, I dont sit
&gt;there and read it all (unless thats what I'm looking for) but I register
&gt;that there are more than say 5, and so I remember that fact - not each
&gt;individual return value.
&gt;
&gt;&lt;/dribble&gt;
