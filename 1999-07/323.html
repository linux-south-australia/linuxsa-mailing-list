&gt;Just goes to show you! After all this time, something David wrote that I
&gt;agree with ;) Not that I think the 'net is intrinsically unsafe for my
&gt;kids, but for the sort of parents who actually want and expect the
&gt;protections promised by the misguided legislation, they actually get the
&gt;side effect David describes instead.
&gt;
&gt;I often wonder why it seems that the more people you get on the decision
&gt;making process (e.g. politics) the worse the end result. It is sort of
&gt;the opposite to the 'open software' development model, where the more
&gt;eyes you get on your project the better and faster it comes out. (what
&gt;was that effect called in 'The cathedral and the Bazaar'???)

Respectfully, it is our politicians' ignorance of technology and IT 
issues that is harming us all the most. I agree that committees don't 
always function "efficiently", but in this instance, I believe the 
greater danger is the total ineptitude of our civic "leaders" to 
understand the digital revolution.

IMO, the only solution for society is to educate children better than 
ever before (or find inordinate amounts of time to supervise their 
offline activities). Scary, huh?

Perhaps Linux should be compulsory for every secondary school student. 
That would keep them away from making bombs for a while. If they crack 
the CIA, who cares? Everyone does that ;-)
