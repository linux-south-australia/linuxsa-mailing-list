&gt; BLOAT ware as far as I'm concerned

MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE is part of the security mechanism of X.  It's not part
of Gnome or Enlightenment.  Either of those could be crap (if you think
it is), but not because of MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE.  It's also not part of the
session management; it's part of the security mechanism.

Can you dump MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE?  I guess you mean can you open your system
to anyone who can reach it via the network?  Well, of course you can, but
much easier would be to simply remove the root password.  :-)

I do think you might be better off finding out what the problem really
is and fixing it.  For what it's worth, having recently installed RH6,
I found all of that completely a non-issue; it's almost certainly not
that Gnome/Session Management/MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 is crap, or bloat, but
that you broke something.

Good luck fixing your problem, and if I could request you keep notes and
write us a report when you've finished.  X security is something which I
am quite uncertain about, and I bet I'm not alone.

Regards,

David
