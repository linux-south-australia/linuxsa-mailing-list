Chuckee,

&gt; Sure, just volounteer your time at a place that uses Linux, e.g. an
&gt; ISP, consulting firm, etc. ...  And - as you're time is given so freely
&gt; - I'm sure there will be lotsa takers for your invitation.

Interesting idea, although there would be less takers than you might
imagine.  It takes significant resources out of a company to permit
somebody to come in for ``work experience'', and generally there is zero
economic benefit to the company in return.

I like your suggestion about approaching schools.  I suspect that schools
are likely to have problems that need solving, and that could be solved
using Unix, and that they would be willing to dedicate a machine to
Linux (they are unlikely to already have a Linux server) if it does in
fact solve their needs.  And, of course, they would the find the cost
very attractive.  :-)


&gt; Each non-independent "box-pushers" - as I've heard them called -
&gt; (e.g. Harvey Norman, NetCraft, and lots more interstate) seem to
&gt; have settled on *one* or *maybe* two flavours.

I'm sure you realise that it takes significant resources to keep staff
skilled in different Linux distributions.  The more distributions a
company supports the greater their staffing cost will be.  It would
surprise me if NetCraft found economic advantage in selling and supporting
multiple distributions.  Tell me, Chuckee, do you really begrudge them
their right to a profit?  (Or would you rather pay their wages out of
your own pocket? *grin*)

Might I just remind you that Linux is at the heart of every Linux
distribution?  There's more in common between Debian and Slackware than
there is that's different.  If you fret over the differences, if you
feel uncomfortable because of RPMs (or the lack thereof), I'd have to
say go learn the basics.  Enjoy Unix for what it is -- a superb and
elegant operting system -- and see the diversity of distributions not
as a barrier, but as "multi-cultural enrichment."


&gt; When e-commerce mail-order houses come into their own in
&gt; the Australian Linux marketplace, you'll be able to find all at one
&gt; place (hopefully, with comparisons).

But without any depth of support.  Do you want cheap without help, or
do you want people who will stand behind what they sell?  Nobody can
be expert in everything.
