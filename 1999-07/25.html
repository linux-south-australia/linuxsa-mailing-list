&gt;Information Poverty
&gt;
&gt;by Phillip Charlier
&gt;
&gt;I recently read the transcript from the ABC radio science program 'The
&gt;Slab: 'How the Internet is failing the developing world' by Subbiah
&gt;Arunachalam. Arunachalum explains that there is an ever increasing
&gt;decline in the ability of Third World scientists to do their work or to
&gt;keep abreast of and participate in developments in their field because
&gt;they lack access to the internet. In other words, people who suffer from
&gt;information poverty are beginning to lose their jobs.
&gt;
&gt;Fortunately, regional Australia has a far better telecommunications
&gt;infrastructure than those of some Lesser Developed Countries, however we
&gt;are still far behind our metropolitan cousins in many ways. I look with
&gt;envy at internet access advertised in the cities from $15 per month
&gt;unlimited and can't help thinking that my peers in the information
&gt;industries there have a comparitive advantage in terms of speed, quality
&gt;of service and costs. I pay over $1 per hour and I can tell you that it
&gt;really adds up when you are in the information game. As for speed, I
&gt;might as well use my old 14.4 k modem to connect from Watsonville via
&gt;Ravenshoe to the world wide web.
&gt;
&gt;I wouldn't complain but I watched the fibre optic cable being laid last
&gt;year about 500 metres from where I am sitting now. I know it is there
&gt;but you wouldn't know it when you plug in a modem.
&gt;
&gt;The problem of inadequate access is not cost, for the benefits of the
&gt;information society are huge compared to outlay. This is what Subbiah
&gt;Arunachalam observed about the problem in India:
&gt;
&gt;What is actually happening is disheartening. Government departments set
&gt;up committees, file reports and do not act, whilst the different
&gt;agencies in the telecom sector who have to implement and deliver
&gt;solutions merely quarrel with one another. Indeed, this is
&gt;characteristic of the Third World: it often takes far too much time for
&gt;things to happen or to translate something from the realm of the
&gt;possible to reality.  Arunachalam 1999
&gt;
&gt;I would say that it is characteristic of the information revolution per
&gt;se: in many lesser - developed areas of society. The bureaucracy and
&gt;other corporate bodies have never been in a hurry to let go of IT. They
&gt;know that information is power and they want to be the ones collecting
&gt;the forms, not the ones filling them in. Meanwhile in the
&gt;telecommunications sector, the privatised carriers are fighting for
&gt;control of the highways, not fighting for those who may turn into a
&gt;competitor (and in a privatised world that is all of us).
&gt;
&gt;The irony is that it is the free flow of information that makes the
&gt;wheel revolve and the revolution continues to gain pace. If all of the
&gt;bureaucrats in the world put all of their red tape together into a big
&gt;thick scarlet ribbon of rope the wheel would still break through. If the
&gt;scarlet rope does not break they will be in even bigger trouble because
&gt;there are not many of them left to hold on to IT. The revolutions'
&gt;momentum increases far more rapidly than bureaucratic procedure.
&gt;
&gt;This is less of a problem in more urbanised areas of Australia where
&gt;early demand and competition has created an ideal infrastructure for
&gt;doing business in the Information Economy. People in regional and rural
&gt;Australia, however, are used to being more dependent on government
&gt;policy and government regulations that guarantee an adequate standard of
&gt;service for rural and regional citizens. The bureacracy that usually
&gt;implements these policies is vastly diminished and the remnants are
&gt;aware of how tenuous their tenure is.
&gt;
&gt;This means that they won't do anything to help you unless you force them
&gt;to.
&gt;
&gt;The age of the apathetic Australian is over. The evolution that comes
&gt;with revolution ensures that the age of passively recieving filtered
&gt;information and enjoying the bliss of not having to take responsibility
&gt;for choosing the information recieved must end. The choice of
&gt;information available on the internet means that every click contains a
&gt;moral, ethical, economic, political and social question; in other words:
&gt;'How are we going to use our time and our energy in the In Formation
&gt;Society?' IFS...
