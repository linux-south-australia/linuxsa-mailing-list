With reference to Marks comments .... IF, you already had some degree of
obscenity-filter in place, you would not only NOT receive the original
message(s) (ie/ the RTFM email) you would also NOT receive any
government edict because they would have to specify what words are
deemed offensive by quoting such words & this would immediately cause
such the message containing the offensive word(s)  to be destroyed!

In the short term, I honestly think that the best solution is for all
ISP's to insert email filters immediately which cause all emails
originating from any address ending .gov.au to be destroyed.... this I
feel, will eradicate many of the inherent problems of net censorship!

My tuppence ha'penny's worth :)

&gt;  &gt; &gt;  &gt; What is RTFM? So many acronyms - makes  life so hard for newbies...
&gt;  &gt; &gt; "Read The Fucking Manual"
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Curisoity begs me to ask would this email be barred by the new internet
&gt;  &gt; law?
&gt; 
&gt; Depends on how it's enforced:  The OFLC's classification guidelines
&gt; for film specify that "gratuitous" profanity warrants an R rating,
&gt; which would be enough to ban this message (since people can read it
&gt; without an adult verification device), so it depends on whether the
&gt; OFLC would consider it "gratuitous".
&gt; 
&gt; In one sense it isn't (because it was required as a specific answer to
&gt; a specific question), but in another sense it is (because the acronym
&gt; is gratuitous in the first place).  The guidelines are ambiguous even
&gt; when they're applied to film (which is why the Classification Review
&gt; Board hasn't had a single unanimous decision in over three years: the
&gt; censors themselves can't agree about what the rules mean!), so frankly
&gt; I don't think we'll have any idea about whether this kind of thing
&gt; will be banned until the OFLC actually looks at a case, which they
&gt; aren't allowed to do until January 1 2000.
&gt; 
&gt; Assuming the email message would earn an R rating for gratuitous
&gt; profanity, there are two ways in which it could be censored by the
&gt; Government: Either someone on LinuxSA could complain to the ABA about
&gt; this specific message, or someone on a different mailing list who
&gt; never saw this message might complain about something completely
&gt; different which convinces the ABA that they should distribute a
&gt; "special access prevention notice" which specifies that the subject of
&gt; the (completely unrelated) complaint and everything else on the
&gt; Internet which is "substantially similar" should be blocked by ISPs.
&gt; 
&gt; All copies of the message would then need to be censored to remain in
&gt; compliance with the law, even private copies held on your hard disk:
&gt; If, for example, your mother can telnet to your machine and read a
&gt; private archive of LinuxSA that you happen to keep on your hard disk,
&gt; the contents of that telnet session count as "Internet Content", and
&gt; you are defined to be an "Internet Content Host" and thus legally
&gt; required to act upon take-down notices.  Everyone who runs any kind of
&gt; server (pop3, ftp, telnet, http, gopher, irc, anything else which
&gt; generates bytes on the network) would also be an ICH -- including most
&gt; people here when they dial-in to the Internet with their Linux boxes
&gt; running all their network daemons.
&gt; 
&gt; Of course, none of it might ever be an issue, depending on your ISP.
&gt; Some (many?  most?  all?  Who knows?  Ask the ABA!) ISPs are going to
&gt; respond to the law by implementing censorware filtering; without
&gt; exception, all censorware works on the basis of lists of blocked words
&gt; (the ones with URL blacklists gather the blacklist by trawling the
&gt; 'net for naughty words like "amateur" and "root").  Since email is
&gt; covered by the law, that'll probably be filtered too, meaning the
&gt; message would never have reached your mailbox in the first place, so
&gt; you wouldn't have been able to complain to the ABA about it in the
&gt; first place.
