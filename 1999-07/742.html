Just a point - I think the software that seems to require constant
hardware upgrades always seems to be written for Microsoft Windows...
Unless you're doing particularly i/o or cpu intensive stuff, old
pentium-class PC's can do most tasks without even breaking into a
sweat..
A p200mmx with 32mb at home displayed television, and did icq, irc,
email,  ftp, played mp3s, video capture and cd ripping and conversion to
mp3.
After upgrading it to a celeron 366, the only time I notice a difference
is when actually encoding mp3s, everything else runs the same. Except
the video capture, but I believe the main factor in speeding it up was
the new harddrive being significantly faster due to ultra DMA and raid
striping, which I could have implemented on the old PC if I'd wanted to
buy more harddrives then ;)

However, a p200MMX isn't 3 years old, so maybe this isn't a fair
comparision. However, if you look at the difference between how windows
95 ran on the p200mmx compared to how it ran on a 366 celeron, it was
significant. if you compared the performance of redhat 5.0 (plus
upgrades) on the p200mmx compared to redhat 6.0 on the celeron, it's
insignificant.

The problem is - do you know what you want to do with your machine over
the next 3 years? If your needs won't change much, then upgraded
applications will probably continue to work quite well on a kick-ass
today's machine quite well then (for linux products, of course..) But if
you realise that you need to be developing full-on Virtual Reality sites
in 2 years for your company, then hopefully it won't come as a surprise
that you need to upgrade to the latest 16 processor AMD K8 or quad
processor Hexium II, so that you've got the 4 GHz of power and VR video
cards neccessary, and the 10Ghz ethernet adaptors to carry the bandwidth
to your customers.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; 3 years?  That's a bit of a stretch.  A kick-ass computer bought today
&gt; &gt; will be somewhat inadequate running the kinds of applications we'll
&gt; &gt; be taking for granted in three years time.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know.  A kick-ass computer will be somewhat less than bottom of the
&gt; line in three years time, but let's face it, a C=64 is still capable of
&gt; sending and receiving email.  ;-)  I'm not in any hurry to upgrade either
&gt; of my 90MHz pentiums; why should I?  They still work fine.  I think a three
&gt; year lifespan for a personal workstation is entirely sensible.  (And if
&gt; it's a business computer I suggest five to ten years is more like it.)
&gt; 
&gt; My experience with Linux has been that today's cutting edge hardware won't
&gt; work until tommorrow.  Either buy yesterday's top of the line; or look
&gt; carefully at what bleeding edge gear is supported and buy that; or buy
&gt; the most advanced equipment and hope that it's supported soon.  (The last
&gt; option is realistic, and it can even be fun to help make it so.)
