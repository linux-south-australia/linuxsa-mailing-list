&gt; &gt;&gt; Possible answers include:
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1:  a lack of LUGs and Linux Mailing Lists in these countries
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2:  LUGs & LMLs are hard to find in these countries
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There are plenty of (in fact, too much) LUGs here, but, they are not
&gt; &gt;mature yet. . .
&gt; &gt;We are a small country, with few linux users
&gt; 
&gt; As a matter of curiosity, where are you Joao?

I'm not he, but the *.pt domain is Portugal.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; you can't expect to get the same kind of support
&gt; &gt; from a mailing list of 30 or 40 people,
&gt; &gt; when compared to a mailing list of 500 people
&gt; 
&gt; Good point... this rule works for even larger LML's

although the unfortunate flipside to this rule is that along with all
the extra help, you get a lot more noise... :)

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (is it???).
&gt; 
&gt; Good question... since the list is maintained,
&gt; albeit automatically, by a local Linux reseller,
&gt; it becomes - like a customer or prospect list -
&gt; a bit guarded... at least, I have not seen any
&gt; way to access the list of members... so far.
&gt; 
&gt; Presumably, our wondering about it will open
&gt; the door to negotiations on opening the mem-
&gt; ber (i.e. e-mail adr) list...  ;)

If there were a way (eg send "get addresses" to <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa-request@etc">linuxsa-request@etc</A>)
then would that not be an excellent way for a potential spammer to get
hold of lots of active addresses? esp as the LinuxSA list removes
inactive addressses automatically. By the way, why would you want such a
list? People who have not yet posted retain their privacy, and if that's
what they want, fair enough.

Also, you may have noticed that there are a number of Linux related
retailers on this list, and I'm sure they all respond to requests for
getting Linux. However, all appear to refrain from spamming quite
admirably. If you have been getting unsolicited emails advertising Linux
gear from NetCraft, then I'm surprised -- I haven't.
