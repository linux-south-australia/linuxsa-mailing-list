&gt; In other words, you are not open to the ideas from mere consumers?
&gt; 
&gt; Who's this "we"?  How far are these plans along?

There is no "we".  There is no heirachy of those with and
those without influence.  That's what makes linux great.
You have an itch, develop a scratch and share it!

&gt; 
&gt; How does the cost (e.g. time) of coordinating a global install-fest
&gt; pay off locally?
&gt; 
&gt; Compared, say, to finding out what the locals may
&gt; need and focussing specifially on those needs...
&gt; 
&gt; E.g. has anybody in this "we" thought about includ-
&gt; ing country- and/or bush-based South Australians?
&gt; 

Matt is helping to organise a global installfest, which
will also include a local installfest here in SA.  If
you don't like the idea - don't be involved in this one.
If you want an installfest out in the bush - then organise
one - don't whinge - there _are_ plenty of opportunities
out there, and we all can't meet them all - so go out and
find your niche and meet it.

This is typical American whinging that makes me glad I'm
an Australian.  And this paragraph is simply here for Chucky
to realise that whinging on a race basis does nothing to
endear yourself to others.  And no, I don't really thing
this way - my opinions are never based on one's race, 
religion, creed or gender.
