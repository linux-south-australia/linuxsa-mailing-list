It sounds like you're making a comment
about the local market here; while I don't
doubt your knowledge of local conditions,
I wonder how you think these might be im-
proved?

&gt; It can take substantial effort to babysit such people.


The attitude expressed here won't help IMHO;
it, too, appears to be part of the local conditions
(and, thus, part of the problem).

&gt; I think it's easy to understand why
&gt;  a company would be reluctant
&gt; to [ex]pend that effort when
&gt; they're not even looking for staff.

Each corporation, country, even little code-shop
(like yours?) has its own "culture"... some more
pro-active or even community-oriented
than reluctant or technology oriented.

It's like (maybe even related to?) the differences
between engineers that start out in "Liberal Arts"
colleges (meaning uni's); you know the ones that
require even the techies to take L.A. courses - e.g.
Theater Arts, History, Literature, et al. - along with
their math's & technical ones...

&gt; In my personal experience, getting great skills in IT

So, does everybody need to have "great" IT skills?

Maybe encouraging a few "work exp" types (like our
earlier poster) might improve the person - e.g "by os-
mosis" at least to the point of enabling him/her to let
a person with "great" IT skills go on to bigger and/or
more challening things.

&gt; needs nothing more than a computer

A Commodore 64, for instance...?  ;)

&gt; and a genuine interest.  I think people who have
&gt; a computer and still need somebody to teach them

Whoa!  Who said anything about *teaching*
the work-exp'ee?

In Europe, I picked up a work-experience manual - from
Philips - listing LOTS of projects for work-exp'ees to
choose from... they simply go off and one of make them
happen... presumably with only *occasional* interaction
with some of the more knowledgable members of Philips'
technical staff, if req'd.

The interaction with more experienced people has at least
TWO benefits:

- the obvious:  the work-exp'ee gains some insight & tips
- the social:  the "advisor" gains "meaning" by mentoring

  (it can be good PR for Philips, a way to get to know and
  recruit a future candidate, and even an ego-boost for a
  technical person who's interested in affecting the next
  generation of engineers... a bit higher on Maslow's
  pyramid of needs, for any of you who've took Psycho-
  logy to meet the req'ts of a Liberal Arts education...  ;)

BTW, mentoring # teaching

It can be good to "change hands" for a few minutes
in the midst of a business day, e.g. discussing a
problem that's already been solved by the senior,
before getting back into the hairy, current one...

If you have kids, you may have experienced such
moments...

&gt; Somebody who has a computer AND enthusiasm

So, where does the enthusiasm come from,
if not from *other* enthusiastic people in the
same high-paced environment?

Anyway, that's a sufficient reason for setting up
the conditions that might catalyze this kind of
"osmosis" IMHO, both for the enthusiatic (who
aren't going to be any less enthusiastic) -and-
the less than great... who might become more
enthusiastic about the work at hand by feeling
that enthusiasm.

Haven't you heard the ad's that try to get more
people to attend sports events?

  "It's better being there!" (or the like)

&gt; might still need some formal experience,
&gt; but when they come they'll be so bright and
&gt; switched on that "work experience"
&gt; would be the last thing on anyone's mind.


I'd say that there are various levels of enthusiasm
and it's good to boost people at *each* level,
i.e. if providing access to that enthusiam can
do this... I'm in favor of it!

&gt;&gt; So, by you, there isn't a shortage of IT people in Australia...?
&gt;
&gt; There's certainly a shortage of great people
&gt; and a terrible oversupply of hopeless, lazy or
&gt; unthinking people.


So, how to improve the situation here?
How to improve the average focus?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I like your suggestion  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Good, then I can depend on your support to 'kill' the censorship bid?
&gt;
&gt; Why would I stand up for you?

By you, censorship by gov't is NOT OK,
but by Linux SA organisers OK?

Have it your way...  ;)

&gt; you make snide comments
&gt; about people behind their backs

I hardly think posts to Linux SA
can reasonably be said to be
"behind anybody's back"

&gt; you refuse to follow convention

You mean like Linus? At a time
when most PC's had Microsoft
operating systems on them, he
chose another path...

&gt; and for no apparent good reason

I don't feel it is anybody's obligation
- be it on a USENET newsgroup or
a mailing list - to offer reasons for
their posts...

Read them if you care to... respond
(perferably with fair rebuttal, if you
can) if you will... don't if you don't...

&gt; and you piss people off

I am not responsible for how people
choose to evaluate any post.  Their
feelings are their responsibility.

&gt; and I believe you do it to try to get a rise.

Hmmm... I don't agree... but there is no point
bucking head over this point of disagreement

&gt; If I were to stand up for you

It is not for any particular persons
or for any posts... rather for the sake
of consistency.

Some don't like pornography (perhaps
it "p*sses" them off, to use your phrase)
and many on this list have said that it is
a mistake to try to limit "free speech" by
censoring the "offending" site(s).

You might like to say No to censorship
as a practical matter.

&gt; I certainly wouldn't want you to know about it
&gt; lest you mistake it as tacit approval of your
&gt; standard behaviour.


Have it your way...  ;)


&gt;&gt; A few bigger, mail-order box-pushers - no support,
&gt;&gt; just good, honest, cheap distribution of Linux s/w;
&gt;&gt; (e.g. Linux Australia could run one as a fund-raiser)
&gt;
&gt; You ask for good, honest, cheap distribution of Linux
&gt; yet you bitch at NetCraft who sit around waiting
&gt; to burn CD's at my whim and hand deliver them

I trust they have better things to do than either *wait* or
*burn* or "hand-deliver" CD-ROMs; and that's why I
- for one - would be happy to see a *real* (efficient,
due to high-volume) box-pusher come into existence,
*precisely* so that people who know what's what
with Linux can move up the challenge-ladder, so to
speak and do more interesting work (maybe get
some local- and/or exportable app'ns up and selling).

&gt; and it costs me less than $50.  I don't want to know
&gt; what you think cheap means.

So, simply filter and/or delete any posts you
find offending (as others have suggests).

&gt; (And NetCraft *also* do support, and often
&gt; for free, e.g. this list.)

&gt;&gt; My point:  Who says ONE company must take all that work on
&gt;&gt; themselves.
&gt;
&gt; I thought you were.  You grizzle that they only sell RedHat.  If what
&gt; you really mean is to grizzle that nobody sells other Linuxes (which
&gt; happens not to be true) then go start a business selling it yourself.


What?!?  Yet ANOTHER little importer?

The point is that - without larger orders - all the RedHats, Caleras
Slackwares & FreeBSD vendors (at the head of the chain) will
quite rightly want higher prices for yet more low-quanity orders.

Harvey Norman might have the buying power to order "big" (at
least for some products or - more likely - from some wide-range
distributors or many vendors' products), but another little guy...

I don't think you see the point.  But (as you hint below), we have
more interesting work to do than discuss these details, don't we?

&gt; this is where I get of[f] this debate with you.  I find
&gt; it as stimulating as the last one.  (Yawn.)


Next time, just delete the post earlier, eh?  ;)
I promise not to be offended in any way...

And you'll have more time for what
you find more "interesting"...

Er... I trust that you *do* have more interest-
ing (or at least lucrative) stuff to work on...
don't you...?  ;)

Anyway, sleep well...  ;)
