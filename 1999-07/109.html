&gt; Subject: New APC Mag
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Just noticed walking past the newsagent - there is a monstrous stack of
&gt; new
&gt; &gt;APC's with a glorious yellow cover dominated by a life-size Tux penguin,
&gt; &gt;with the glaring title 'Is Windows Cracking'.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Small print invites readers to look at the competive analysis of various
&gt; &gt;OSen - Linux, MacOS, BeOS, Win98, Win2000.
&gt; 
&gt; Is all this having any effect?
&gt; 
	[O'Connor, Steven]  Yes, there is already a large queue forming
outside the newsagent, some people are crying and pointing hysterically to
the magazine shouting 'It's Tux - its Tux !', the police have been called in
to secure the area and attempt to regain order.

	There is also a thick and building stream of taxi's heading for the
airport, where MSCE's are heading for the first flight out. Some MSCE's who
missed the last taxi have been left stranded, and are now as I speak slumped
to the ground in a pitious state of depression - some of them just stare
blankly forward muttering to themselves.

	I think that despite the severe shock of this, the reaction has been
pretty well contained by all parties. After all, some people have said that
they should have seen this coming.

	What I have found suprising though is the time that this has taken
to come into effect. After all, the magazine did come out a couple of days
ago, I wonder why it has taken this much time for the full impact of the
reaction to sink in ?
