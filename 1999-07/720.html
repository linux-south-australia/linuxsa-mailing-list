Dear LinuxSA Member,

It is with deep regret that the organisers of LinuxSA have been put in
a situation where we feel it necessary to remove someone from LinuxSA.

Chuck Waite (also known as C4IS, ARA, and SBS EXPT) has been active on
the LinuxSA list for quite some time, but unfortunately a large number
of his posts are inflammatory.  Chuck has been a confirmed cause of a
number of good technical people leaving the list, and complaints about
him are a common theme amongst people contacting
<A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au.">organisers@linuxsa.org.au.</A>

So this weekend (31 July) we are intending to remove <A HREF="mailto:C4IS@EISA.NET.AU">C4IS@EISA.NET.AU</A>
from the LinuxSA Mailing list.

We are doing this to improve the quality of the mailing list and
remove an anti-social member from the list.

We ask the replies on this thread are kept to a minimum on the list.
We would like this topic to come to resolution quickly and with
minimal fuss.  

If there are any people on the list who have some compelling reason as
to why C4IS should remain on LinuxSA, could they please contact
<A HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A> before Friday.  If we do not hear any
compelling reasons as to why C4IS should stay on the list we will
remove him.

We sincerely hope that this sort of occasion will never happen again. 

Regards,

Matthew Tippett
