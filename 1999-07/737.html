&gt; 3 years?  That's a bit of a stretch.  A kick-ass computer bought today

Actually, a recent Communications of the ACM article identified a three
year purchasing cycle as the optimal for both price and performance,
so Alan's gut feel is spot on.


I'd post to the OSISP list (asking for off-list replies) as most ISPs
have exactly your problem.  Which basically boils down to "I want
a very-standard PC".

As Mark says, if you want to specify exactly what goes into the
computer you will pay more.  Be careful that this `more' doesn't turn
out to be in excess of buying a PC from Dell with Linux preinstalled.

Even if the Dell parts are non-standard (and they usually aren't)
their market-share is enough to ensure that Linux will run on it.
[Which I'm sure is the only reason that Linux runs on some really
shocking hardware from Acer :-) ]


&gt;  &gt; But I can't even work out how I would buy a
&gt;  &gt; yeong yang case. Obviously it would be big cost and
&gt;  &gt; effort to import something from Taiwan or the US.
&gt; 
&gt; One word:  Rackmount :-)

But racks look so unpretty in the spare room.  There are plenty
of brand-name parts suppliers, usually interstate.  They are happy
to ship and to do inc-tax.  Ask them to fax you a parts list.
I'll look through our fax in-tray if you want.
