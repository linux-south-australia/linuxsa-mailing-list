I had similar problems after changing the hostname or the IP of my box (ie
I've had the problem twice).  I didn't know which services to restart, so I
rebooted (*cry*).  After the reboot, things seemed to work ok.  I think it
had something to do with X only allowing connections from certain
hosts/IP's.  But I rarely use X, so I haven't found anything more out about
it.

Tell us what you discover :)

Also - if you don't want session management - ummm does Gnome handle that?
I'm actually not a big fan of gnome .. IMO it provides too many nice glossy
user friendly administration tools, and nice glossy user friendly
administration tools do not necessarily promote nice glossy administration..
they instead tend to make the administrator rest on her/his laurels a bit
and not bother learning -what- the said tools are actually doing.  This is
one of the (many) reasons I dislike Microsoft products.

My 2c :)

Hey - maybe this will start some conversation here - it's been a bit quiet
lately, hasn't it?

&gt; &gt; 3) Whether you can DUMP the session management...I don't want it, it's
&gt; &gt; BLOAT ware as far as I'm concerned
&gt;
&gt; MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE is part of the security mechanism of X.  It's not part
&gt; of Gnome or Enlightenment.  Either of those could be crap (if you think
&gt; it is), but not because of MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE.  It's also not part of the
&gt; session management; it's part of the security mechanism.
&gt;
&gt; Can you dump MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE?  I guess you mean can you open your system
&gt; to anyone who can reach it via the network?  Well, of course you can, but
&gt; much easier would be to simply remove the root password.  :-)
&gt;
&gt; I do think you might be better off finding out what the problem really
&gt; is and fixing it.  For what it's worth, having recently installed RH6,
&gt; I found all of that completely a non-issue; it's almost certainly not
&gt; that Gnome/Session Management/MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 is crap, or bloat, but
&gt; that you broke something.
&gt;
&gt; Good luck fixing your problem, and if I could request you keep notes and
&gt; write us a report when you've finished.  X security is something which I
&gt; am quite uncertain about, and I bet I'm not alone.
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt;
&gt; David
