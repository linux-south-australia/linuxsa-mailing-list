&gt;While it says there are 0 hosts, you wont get far at all - try to sort that
&gt;problem out first (hardware, cabling, jumper settings ?)
&gt;
&gt;Once linux recognises &gt;0 hosts, you should be able to 'see'
&gt;/dev/sd[a-g][0-15]    where [a-g] is the host ID between 1-7, and 0-15 is
&gt;the partition id on that disk.
&gt;
&gt;eg - if you get linux to see host ID of 4 on the scsi bus, try fdisk
&gt;/dev/sdd.   
&gt;
&gt;(I think this is right - ID 1 = sda, or is that ID 0 = sda ??? someone fill
&gt;me in here ?)

Ummm, that is not how I think it works.

/dev/sda is the first SCSI device found on the first buss, scanned in the
order that the cards some up.

So, if you have a disk on SCSI ID 4 on the first controller (either bus
priority order if built into the kernel, I think, or the order you specify
them in /etc/conf.modules--also /etc/modules.conf--which is the safest way
to ensure they come up in the order you want), then, it becomes:

   /dev/sda with partitions sda1, sda2, etc.

The second device, let us say, another disk on the next controller, comes
up as /dev/sdb.

This can be a problem if you add another device to the first chain, eg with
SCSI ID 6, then it will come up as /dev/sdb, while the former /dev/sdb will
come up as /dev/sdc.  

This can be a right royal pain in the fundamental orrifice. Careful
planning is required.

&gt;Once you can fdisk the new disk, create the partition table, and then run
&gt;mkfs to create file systems on there. - You can just stick with the default
&gt;ext2fs if you want to get running quickly, or you could take the opportunity
&gt;to try out one of the new-fangled file systems like CODA, or the journalling
&gt;file system that SGI have recently released for linux. ( - re-live the joys
&gt;of using OpenVMS ! )
