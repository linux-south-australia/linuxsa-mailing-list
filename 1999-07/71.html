&gt; After finally getting RedHat 5.2 running on my old 486DX2-66 (on a 1.2Gig
&gt; HD), I was curious to know if I could install a bigger HD on my system,
&gt; i.e. greater than 2Gig.
&gt; 
&gt; In LBA mode, my system (i.e. the CMOS) can see up to 2Gig, but what would
&gt; happen if I installed a HD bigger than 2Gig?  Assuming the entire HD was
&gt; dedicated to Linux, would Linux be able to see beyond the 2Gig "limit",
&gt; even though DOS wouldn't normally be able to?

Most hdd companies have software which allows the drive to use the full
amount of space. These simply get loaded once in the boot sector and bios
need be none the wiser. Hence you should be able to bypass the 2G limit.

However, I've found many graphical (win)bioses refuses to
boot with larger drives full stop. If you have an ami or award bios you
should be fine. 

Perhaps also check if there is a flashable bios upgrade to fix the 2G
limit problem. (check the motherboard maker's website)

&gt; As an extension to that question: 
&gt; 
&gt; What would the scenario be in an even older system (e.g. my old 486SX-25
&gt; currently collecting dust in the corner) which has the old 512MB (or
&gt; thereabouts) limit?  Would I be able to place into that machine my old
&gt; 1.2Gig HD, or even one over 2Gig?

I was running a 1.2Gb on a 486sx for quite some time. Worked for the same
reason given above.

&gt; Not knowing much about what happens during boot-up, I think my question is
&gt; essentially asking something like: 
&gt; 
&gt; How does Linux (or any other OS, for that matter) relate to the HDD figures
&gt; in the CMOS?

Linux (2.2.x kernels) gets it's info directly off the drive but checks
with bios. If the two are vastly different it reverts to bios knowing
best. Microsoft operating systems use bios.

Cheers,
