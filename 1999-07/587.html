Nour:

&gt; Well, I don't know what could go wrong in a strait forward installation of
&gt; Linux, however, I know that I have a Linux 5.2 running on 350 MHz Pentium II
&gt; machine with 64 MB of Memory

I presume you mean RedHat 5.2. RedHat 5.2 comes with kernel 2.0.36. The
kernel image supplied by RedHat is exceedingly slow and bloated. I
suggest this:

1) At least find out how to rebuild a kernel and rebuild Kernel 2.0.36
as modular as possible. Try looking in /usr/src/linux; there should be a
README file there about how to rebuild kernels. If it has not been
installed (unlikely), then it is on an RPM called kernel-source[lotsa
numbers].rpm.

2) Better yet go to the latest stable Kernel 2.2.10. You can download
this from somewhere within <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mirror.aarnet.edu.au.">ftp://ftp.mirror.aarnet.edu.au.</A> If you can't
find it there (it is there - that's where I got mine) go to
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org.">http://www.kernel.org.</A>

3) If you feel adventurous go straight to a development Kernel, the
latest releases appear to be around the 2.3.10 mark. I had my redHat 5.2
installation running very stably on Kernel 2.3.6, however, be warned
they are development Kerne;ls and don't necessarily work properly.

&gt; and the damn thin is so slow.

See my comments above. When I did step 3 I couldn't believe the
difference.

&gt; Well, it is
&gt; especially slow when I am in Xwindows.  

X Windows takes up a huge amount of memory by itself. All Graphical User
Interfaces are bloatware and resource hogs.

&gt; What's even more frustrating is that
&gt; Netscape runs out of memory frequently and shuts off and sometimes it even
&gt; shuts down Xwindows.

Netscape is, well, a tad touchy. Netscape 4.07 *should* run fine
provided you're not using any pages with Javascript. The moment Netscape
attempts to start Javascript or any type of Java through an applet it
appears to start to perform wobblies. It's very, very annoying. Go to
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net">http://www.freshmeat.net</A> or <A HREF="http://ozybytes.linuxberg.com">http://ozybytes.linuxberg.com</A> and see
whether you might want to try out a different browser.

&gt;  Really frustrating but have no clue why this is
&gt; happening...

See my comments above, however I place Netscape in *almost* the same
basket as Microsoft for being able to create programs which are
bloatware and die for reasons not terribly explainable.

&gt;      I am assuming someone out there has had a similar problem considering
&gt; the fact that I have not run anything special on this machine..

Yes. The solution is to go to Netcraft <A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com.au">http://www.netcraft.com.au</A> and
get RedHat 6.0 or better yet, find Mandrake. RedHat 5.2 is fast becoming
OldHat 5.2 and you will find it very frustrating to use it as you go on
because it won't have the proper (i.e. newest stable) pieces (eg
libraries and such) to compile and/or run up-to-date software.

I hope this is of some help. PLEASE read the README in the
/usr/src/linux directory *before* you attempt to rebuild the kernel. It
is quite straightforward; I'd advise you to set side a number of hours
and read the help provided on0line when you get to the "make xconfig" or
"make menuconfig" stage.

DAVID.
