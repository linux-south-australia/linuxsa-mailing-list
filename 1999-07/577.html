this may or may not be related, but......

we (my project group and I) have experienced kernel instability when it
comes to the networking side of things. We have RH6 kernel 2.2.5 also,
and have exprienced kernel panics when the network was stressed. We are
going to roll back to RH5.2 (or maybe just an older kernel) to
investigate further.

FWIW: kernel panics happened whilst using xaudio (mp3 player) and an
stressing an xterm from accross the network on seperate xwindows server.

&gt; Hi.
&gt; 
&gt; Something weird going on with my ZIP Plus drive. (RedHat 6.0, linux
&gt; 2.2.5 with imm  module)
&gt; 
&gt; I recompiled the kernel, included the imm driver as module.
&gt; Hooked the ZIP to the parallel port (I don't have the SCSI plug).
&gt; Loaded the imm module with modprobe.
&gt; Had a hard time to find what the device was :).
&gt; Mounted the ZIP on /dev/sda4 on to /mnt/z.
&gt; cd'ed and ls'ed OK.
&gt; Mounted a samba share over /mnt/z and called it zip.
&gt; Went to a NT workstation, the share was there.
&gt; Tried to open it: "An unexpected network error has occurred" (as far as
&gt; I think there are no expected errors, but ...).
&gt; Went back to Linux, where the current path still was /mnt/z and:
&gt; ls: Segmentation Fault
&gt; ls (again): blocked. Ctrl-Z and CTRL-C of no use.
&gt; Changed xterm, cd'ed to /mnt/z and ls: blocked
&gt; Changed xterm, ps'ed and tried to kill both processes: none will die!!!
&gt; (yes, with SIGKILL or 9)
&gt; ps labels the ls processes with a D.
&gt; Tried to unmount: device or resource busy.
&gt; /proc/mount reports the zip as mounted.
&gt; Couldn't kill the procs, not even changing to runlevel 1.
&gt; Did the obvious thing to kill the processes: rebooted.
&gt; Now it locks booting with: "Remounting root filesystem in R/W mode".
&gt; (maybe it's because the ZIP is still attached to the parallel port.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the questions are:
&gt;         What happened?
&gt;         What does the D process status mean?
&gt;         Are there processes that can't be killed by root? (what about kill -9
&gt; -1 (kids, don't try this at home))
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you.
