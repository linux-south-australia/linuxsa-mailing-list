Hi,

It is refreshing to find that one does not know what one is talking about.

In a recent exchange with John &lt;<A HREF="mailto:john@fiend.securesys.com.au">john@fiend.securesys.com.au</A>&gt;, I spouted a
load of bullshit.

I would like to thank John for being so patient with me, but, correct what
I am now confident is a minor misconception on John's part.

At 08:02 AM 7/17/99 +0930, John &lt;<A HREF="mailto:john@fiend.securesys.com.au">john@fiend.securesys.com.au</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;&gt; Hmmm, a quick check of 'tty' in an xterm shows:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   # tty
&gt;&gt;   /dev/ttyp0
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Also, login via telnet with 'telnet localhost', and then 'tty':
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;   # tty
&gt;&gt;   /dev/ttyp1
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; So, I conclude that /dev/ttypn devices are the (pseudo) terminal end of the
&gt;&gt; connection.

The above was written because I completely misunderstood the pseudo tty
devices. After chasing down various pieces of source, I now see that the
master side of the pseudo tty is /dev/ptynn devices, while the slave side
it /dev/ttypn and so on, wrapping around to /dev/ttyan and so on.

&gt;	When you  telnet to localhost, telnetd opens a pseudo terminal
&gt;	(see call to getpty() in source). Telnetd hangs around
&gt;	(do a ps, you'll see an in.telnetd for each person who's logged 
&gt;	in).

Indeed it does, and this was never under dispute.

&gt;	Telnetd reads characters from the socket (network connection)
&gt;	and feeds them into the pty. They travel through the pty to the
&gt;	tty (which the shell is attached to).

Indeed, they pass through routines like (in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/)
like pty.c, m_tty.c, tty_io.c, etc ... It takes a fair bit of intestinal
fortitude, and a not insignificant number of glasses of red to unravel the
actual code paths :-) (Actually, I lie, with more than about 2 glasses of
red, I am unlikely to be able to understand it :-)

&gt;	When you telnet to localhost, there are 2 pty/tty pairs in action:
&gt;	the tty your original shell is attached to passes chars to the
&gt;	pty, which shoves them into the TCP socket that was opened by telnet.
&gt;	At the other end of the TCP socket, telnetd reads the chars in,
&gt;	and stuffs them into the second pty, which from whence they go
&gt;	through to the second tty, which is where your second shell (the
&gt;	'remote' shell) reads its  data from.

This is the only point that I cannot agree with here.  While the source to
telnet is in C++, it is not that hard to read, and there is no need for a
pseudo tty.

telnet simply establishes a connection to the target host, in this case
localhost (going via the lo device) and then pumps any data received on
stdin out the TCP connection and any data received on the TCP connection
out stdout, and handles Telnet commands along the way. (For an idea of the
number of telnet commands that scurry back and forth when a connection is
established, get a copy of ethereal and grab a trace of a telnet session.
If you find any telnet commands and options that it does not understand, I
damn well want to know about it.)

&gt;	Linux assigns the next free tty/pty pair. The first time you got ttyp0,
&gt;	the second time you got ttyp1.

Yes, it does, and I now so that they are ptynn and ttypn etc.

[Code deleted as irrelevant]

&gt;&gt; In the case of xterm, xterm opens up a ttyan and ttypn pair, forks, and in
&gt;&gt; the child sets ttypn as stdin, stdout and stderr, and then exec's /bin/sh.
&gt;&gt; The parent then shoves the characters you type down the ttyan device.

Oh well, more of my bullshit :-) 

&gt;	I don't run  X here, so I could be wrong here. It's late, too,
&gt;	so I'm not going to trawl through the code to xterm :)

No need. I am sure now (although I have not looked at the source either)
that xterm opens a ptynn/ttypn pair.

&gt;&gt; In the case of telnet, telnetd accepts incoming connections on port 23,
&gt;&gt; opens a ttyan/ttypn pair, forks and arranges that the child has ttypn on
&gt;&gt; stdin, stdout and stderr.  The child then exec's login which does all the
&gt;&gt; normal stuff.  The network connection is quite removed from all this stuff.

This is a mish-mash of misconceptions with some truth.

&gt;	Again, see above.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; &gt;	At the tty end of the stream sits the application program: your
&gt;&gt; &gt;	shell, mail program, text editor, whatever.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Hmmm, no, the evidence suggests that the application program gets the ttypn
&gt;&gt; device.

Well, this statement was essentially true, based on the evidence above, and
the knowledge that the ttypn devices are the slave ends of the pseudo ttys

&gt;	Nope, but it does get a tty device.

Well, my defence here is that I like to distinguish between /dev/ttyn
devices, and /dev/ttySn devices and /dev/ttypn devices, etc ...

&gt;&gt; Hmmm, telnetd does this conversion as part of the telnet protocol. The pair
&gt;&gt; of ttyan and ttypn do not do this at all. 

Here I was referring to things like mapping NVT ASCII to the local mode,
which essentially means CRNL to NL and vice versa ... 

Again, I got it wrong :-)

&gt;	The telnet protocol specifies options like line-mode or character mode.
&gt;	Passing the character-mode buffering option to telnetd tells telnetd 
&gt;	to put *its* pty/tty pair into character-mode.
&gt;	That way, the output from the remote application is passed straight
&gt;	from the (remote) tty to the (remote) pty to the socket to

Except for my contention that there is no remote pty, as there is no need
for one, this is essentially correct.

&gt;	the local pty (also in character-mode buffering) to the tty that
&gt;	is attached to the the telnet client.
&gt;
&gt;	But let's  look  furthur at the source (#defines cut for
&gt;	readability):

[Source cut ...]

&gt;...Uses some VERY streamlike kinda ioctl()s.
&gt;Telnetd does the flow control? Not on your life.

Well, I guess I have to agree, although I was not talking about flow
control.  However, I was *wrong* in what I *was* talking about :-)

&gt;&gt; In addition, things like ctrl-c are also handled by signalling between the
&gt;&gt; telnet client and telnetd. I suspect that xterm does the same. Xterm
&gt;&gt; notices the ^C and calls an ioctl to send the SIGTERM: the pair of ttyan
&gt;&gt; and ttypn have nothing to do with it.
&gt;
&gt;	Hmmm. The source code to  telnetd doesn't even contain a reference
&gt;	to the kill(2) or killpg(2) system calls. 
&gt;	So how does is signal the process at the other end of the stream???

No, it does not, but it does contain references to ioctls that send SIGINTs
and SIGQUITs etc, but this does not come into play under Linux.

An examination of n_tty_receive_char from n_tty.c in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char shows that it handles both CRNL to NL
processing and ^C processing for characters pumped into a pty, and the
slave tty (ttypn) receives the appropriate things.

Along the way I learned some other things.  I had assumed that when the
user at the client end types a ^C this is mapped to TCP urgent data (ie,
OOB). When I actually fired up ethereal and checked, I found another place
where I was wrong.  Of course, telnetd does not need to receive urgent
data, as it is sitting on a select waiting for data from either the pty or
the socket, and can react as soon as a ^C comes it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;	When the application at the tty end writes output, the stream
&gt;&gt; &gt;	does processing as well (stripping the 8th bit from characters,
&gt;&gt; &gt;	nl-&gt;crnl conversions, and so on).
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Ummm, again, this is a function of telnet client and telnetd implementing
&gt;&gt; the telnet options processing.
&gt;
&gt;	Again, look at the source. It's all in the ptys and ttys.

Yup, it sure was ... 

&gt;J.

I was wrong about most of what I said, and my penance was to go and check
it all out in the source.  Now I feel better for having done so.
