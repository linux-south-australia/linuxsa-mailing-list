&gt; I thought inetd was just supposed to do a select() on the sockets
&gt; myself..

	A socket needs to be bound and listened on before you can 
	call select() on it. How else do you get the file descriptor 
	you need????

&gt; It's up to your client to do the accepting and all that.

	Crap. Servers do the accept()ing. That's what makes them 
	servers. Clients do the connect().

&gt; inetd is called a 'superserver' because it waits until there is a need
&gt; to have a server running before it starts the server...

	Inetd does the opening and the listening. When it detects a connect
	it calls the relevant server, with file descriptors 0-2 (stdin,
	stdout, stderr) replaced with the fd of the newly created
	connection. 
	That's why servers called via inetd are different (code wise) than
	standalone servers.

&gt; This way, you don't need servers running until someone tries to connect,
&gt; then the server loads, services the port, and then quits at the end.

	No, no, no. Look at the source code to in.*. 

&gt; If a server had to start up for every possible connection, then you'd
&gt; need  a million telnet/ftp/etc daemons all running just incase that many
&gt; connected.

	Sigh. Inetd listen()s on all ports that have servers associated with
	them. Inetd does the accept(). Then it dup2()s the file descriptor
	returned from the accept() call, and passes it to the server
	(file descriptors are transparent to execv() calls -- unless the
	CLOSE_ON_EXEC bits are set using fcntl()).
 
	You really need to read up on TCP/IP.
