&gt; Okay, here's a problem I just can't figure out.
&gt; Ever since last thursday my soundcard has been running at a sort of
&gt; halfspeed, or quarter speed. Everything plays fine, except at an
&gt; amazingly slow rate, and low pitch. Imagine a walkman when the batteries
&gt; are flat, only worse.
&gt; I can't figure out what is causing this - I've tried warm boots, cold
&gt; boots, all manner of different options, different kernel drivers, eSD
&gt; verses direct OSS, etc. but nothing changes - if the soundcard works, it
&gt; works at this slow rate.
&gt; The soundcard was working perfectly for about 6 months prior to this,
&gt; it's a builtin ESS 1869, and it's never been a problem before. I can't
&gt; think what happened to start this perculiar behaviour, but I know I
&gt; plugged an external serial modem in on the same day that I noticed it.
&gt; Only thing is, I plugged the modem in at night, and the problem had
&gt; showed up by lunchtime, so that rules it out. Other than that, I don't
&gt; think I did anything..THe machine hadn't been rebooted for a couple of
&gt; weeks, so the first thing i did was reboot, but that didn't solve the
&gt; problem.
&gt;
&gt; I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had this occur, and what
&gt; they did to fix it? Or, has anyone got any ideas about where to look or
&gt; what to do?
&gt; Everything I look at looks exactly the same as it did before, and I
&gt; can't recall doing anything to start this behaviour. I guess there's a
&gt; slight possibility the soundcard has exploded internally, but that's
&gt; pretty extreme!

Tried some Ugg boots.  (sorry).  I assume it is when you play mp3 files or
wav files.  It's the sampling rate that is causing this.  e.i. 22000 Hz
when it should be 44000Hz (or there abouts).  Unlikely to be hardware.  You
need to check what your default settings are for the sound apps.  Give us
some more info, i.e. what sound apps you were running?

Good luck
Conrad.
