&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt;  I've written a daemon and I want it to get invoked from
&gt;  inetd. I added an entry in inetd.conf, updated the
&gt;  /etc/services to have the corresponding port for the
&gt;  service name and I "kill -1"ed the inetd. But when I
&gt;  "netstat -an"ed, it didnt show any LISTEN at the port
&gt;  where I wanted my daemon to listen.
&gt; 
&gt;  The daemon I wrote is a perl script. There might
&gt;  be some bugs in the script. But when the client is
&gt;  not invoked, the server wont run at all.. Inetd is
&gt;  supposed to just bind and listen.. I dont have a
&gt;  clue why it's not working..
I thought inetd was just supposed to do a select() on the sockets
myself..
It's up to your client to do the accepting and all that.
inetd is called a 'superserver' because it waits until there is a need
to have a server running before it starts the server...
This way, you don't need servers running until someone tries to connect,
then the server loads, services the port, and then quits at the end.
If a server had to start up for every possible connection, then you'd
need  a million telnet/ftp/etc daemons all running just incase that many
connected.

&gt; 
&gt;  Any help is appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Sai
