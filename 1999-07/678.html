&gt; there are people out there C41S,
&gt; who cannot afford to buy that neat 32bit PC.

In that case, *THAT* is the problem to be addressed IMHO.
Australia is NOT a "3rd world" country; there is plenty of $ here.

&gt; I'd rather some of them get connected to the information via
&gt; outdated technology than not at all.

The other point is that local public libraries
provide FREE Internet-access to all.

Rather than investing the time in 8-bit technologies
let those who "have not" use publicly owned 32-bit
technologies, so they can *enjoy* about the same
experience that we do.

&gt; would these types rather be in an
&gt; 'Internet underclass' (a bit harsh)
&gt; or a 'no-internet underclass'?


They need not suffer either...
If you think about it, they can
get what we take for granted
(except those in the country &
bush, of course...)... at their
local libraries.  Simple, eh?

&gt; Don't forget that the power is in the information,
&gt; not the gee-wiz graphics.

I haven't (I still use mostly text-based USENET newsgroups,
myself, for this reason...)

&gt; Lynx is cool for cutting to the chase and forgetting about
&gt; the eye candy. I'll bet you could use lynx from a C64.

Nope... except for a museum demo (like using Morse
code in a world where it's obsolete in its professional
applications, e.g. Ship-to-Shore comm's); while there's
nothing wrong with doing historic demonstrations of
quaint, old technologies, I'm sure you wouldn't want
YOUR kid/friend/lover being limited to Internet accessed
only via 8-bit technology... or am I wrong, here?

"Friends don't let friends surf the 'net using 8-bit boxes"  :)

"Why not the best?"
