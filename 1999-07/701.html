It seems to me the biggest factor in this gem from Mr. Anonymous C4IS is
not so much the amount of bits but the placement of digits!
Reminds me so much of a song by TISM.


C4IS wrote arrogantly and ignorantly:

--snip--

&gt;
&gt; In that case, *THAT* is the problem to be addressed IMHO.
&gt; Australia is NOT a "3rd world" country; there is plenty of $ here.
&gt;

Stop dreaming junior!! Read the unemployment and poverty figures recently??



&gt;
&gt; &gt; I'd rather some of them get connected to the information via
&gt; &gt; outdated technology than not at all.
&gt;
&gt; The other point is that local public libraries
&gt; provide FREE Internet-access to all.
&gt;
&gt; Rather than investing the time in 8-bit technologies
&gt; let those who "have not" use publicly owned 32-bit
&gt; technologies, so they can *enjoy* about the same
&gt; experience that we do.
&gt;

Yes, yes.... we should all be converted to C4ISism!!  You are your own God
it is clear.  Stop trying to be evryone elses as well.


&gt;
&gt; &gt; would these types rather be in an
&gt; &gt; 'Internet underclass' (a bit harsh)
&gt; &gt; or a 'no-internet underclass'?
&gt;
&gt; They need not suffer either...
&gt; If you think about it, they can
&gt; get what we take for granted
&gt; (except those in the country &
&gt; bush, of course...)... at their
&gt; local libraries.  Simple, eh?
&gt;

Simple?? Yes goddam it... don't go to work or look after families... spend
your life in the libraries ppl.  (sic)


&gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't forget that the power is in the information,
&gt; &gt; not the gee-wiz graphics.
&gt;
&gt; I haven't (I still use mostly text-based USENET newsgroups,
&gt; myself, for this reason...)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Lynx is cool for cutting to the chase and forgetting about
&gt; &gt; the eye candy. I'll bet you could use lynx from a C64.
&gt;
&gt; Nope... except for a museum demo (like using Morse
&gt; code in a world where it's obsolete in its professional
&gt; applications, e.g. Ship-to-Shore comm's); while there's
&gt; nothing wrong with doing historic demonstrations of
&gt; quaint, old technologies, I'm sure you wouldn't want
&gt; YOUR kid/friend/lover being limited to Internet accessed
&gt; only via 8-bit technology... or am I wrong, here?
&gt;
&gt; "Friends don't let friends surf the 'net using 8-bit boxes"  :)
&gt;
&gt; "Why not the best?"
&gt;

Define "best".  YOUR definition is so obstinately self absorbed it is
devoid of thought for anyone who is not an image of you.


Grow up and rejoin humanity!!!
