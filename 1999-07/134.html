&gt; &gt;   Tutorial, perhaps, along with a very clear *hand-out* on:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt;      Getting Linux - off the 'net - onto a bare hard-drive
&gt;
&gt; Why do you want a meeting devoted to

A tutorial/handout was suggested, not a meeting per se.

&gt; what is probably the *worst* way to install Linux imaginable?

If you want "truth in advertising" (which I do),
then it is reasonable to be able to point to
a HowTo (the handout suggested) for this
kind of info...

A lot of newbies coming to Linux SA have
apparently been told (by missionaries)
that it is possible to d'load Linux from the
net... why shouldn't they have the method
spelled out for them in an easy-to-implement
HowTo.

&gt; When anyone on the planet can walk down
&gt; to their local bookstore, computer shop or
&gt; mail-order from &lt;a Linux supplier&gt; to
&gt; spend a few sheckels on a CD,
&gt; why on *earth* would anyone install 600
&gt; Mbytes of stuff (at 19c per Mbyte &/or ~$1 per hour)
&gt; from the net?


I allow that - like myself - some have unlimited 'net access

In any case, there have been enough questions
to make me feel that some are prepared to pay
the price (or have, in advance, in their 12 month
ISP service bills)

&gt; Useful tip for any newbies installing Linux for the first time:

It need not, of course, be "the first time" install.

&gt; Beg, borrow, buy or steal a CD.  FTPing the bits is Not Cool (tm).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;      (people ask this often and might like to see it done
&gt; &gt;      "Live & In-Color" and receive a How To on a floppy
&gt; &gt;      reminding them - in excrutiating detail - what they saw)
&gt;
&gt; While the quaint 1970's "handout" idea is kinda cute,
&gt; why waste trees/floppies/time/money/whatever on handouts
&gt; when a URL can be quoted?


Fair comment

&gt; Anyway, I'm sure that if you really think such a presentation and
&gt; "handout" would be beneficial you'll be the first person to jump to
&gt; prepare, present and fund it.

So, by you, Linux "advertising" has been... let's say... exagerated
vis a vis easily installed from the 'net?
