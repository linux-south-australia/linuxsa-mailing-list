As you are aware I thought I had my MIT-MAGIC-COOKIES fixed.
Unfortunately the Magic Cookies have magically begun failing again.
Having been referred to the Xauthority, Xsecurity and other Xblah
manuals I discovered that you should allow XDM to manage the
MIT-MAGIC-COOKIES.

I'm confused. I don't have X startup on long time. I'm on RedHat 6.0 and
my runlevel is 3 which is multi-user CLI mode. Although I've normally
got X running each time I turn the computer on, I prefer to start it by
typing startx; I also have such things as junkbuster and other bits and
pieces which I don't like to run under X because Netscape likes to hard
crash my X Server at least once a day.

Therefore, if I use startx to begin the X Server does this mean that XDM
is there somewhere? I though XDM was that funny little screen which asks
for a login and password graphically instead of the login: password: CLI
prompt. Or, have I misread the XDM man pages totally - is XDM the
program which is essentially a daemon style program started however you
load X up.

I guess I'm wondering if I actually use XDM or not. I simply type startx
at the command prompt to get my X Server running. From what I see in the
linux documentation my problem is unique...or at least no-one's put it
in there...
