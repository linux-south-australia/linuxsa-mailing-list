Subject: Politicians put children at risk from porn


&gt;Dear Editor,


I presume you sent your letter to some newspaper?
As a matter of curiosity, which one?  And - if it's not
too early to ask - has it found its way into print yet?

&gt;I firmly believe that the new Broadcasting Services Amendment law,
&gt;... will not stop anyone from accessing anything.
&gt;
&gt; When people ask me about it I explain...;
&gt; but I tell them not to worry, apart from increased costs and
&gt; slower speed there will be no real effect. I tell them they will
&gt; still be able to visit their favourite sites,


Is nobody you advise using the Internet for "non-censorable"
material...?  ;)

&gt; On reflection I realise the effect is worse than this.  Parents are
&gt; rightfuly worried about what their children see on the Internet.

I like the FBI's web site / report for such parents... it's more bal-
anced in tone and even suggests what to do upon discovering
undesired material (report it) -vs- Aust. gov't says "we'll do it all"
(so there should be no need to bother us... ;)

&gt; Anyone can find and view pornography and
&gt; other materials innapropriate for children.


You're still being duped IMHO into playing the "Internet = porn"
game... and - as a result - you're actually helping people (who
might read your [to be] published letter) to feel more upset
with the unknown Internet than they really need to be.

Why not try the "Internet = library" game instead?  Just think:

While Aussies are learning to fear the big, bad Internet, that
(therefore) must be "controlled" and (as a result) slowed down
for everybody... lots of others are focussing on what GOOD
that *same* Internet has to offer... c.f. Philip Greenspun's
"Philil & Alex's Guide to Web Publishing," any of the online
training/educational/genealogy resources, et al.

Unless & until there are lots more people actually promoting
positively the non-porn aspects of the Internet around here,
you might as well get used to censorship's implications...

Why not follow One Nation's lead (as I've suggested to Newt'
few times over the last 6 months) & help organise a political
party (just look at the article in last week's Australian, to see
how many $'s of public funds are available to fund such an
effort, i.e. after the new party gains members and votes...

Surely, there are more people in Australia interested in sav-
ing the Internet (here) from "gov't intervention" than there are
racists ready to join/support One Nation...?

&gt; Australians are about to be lulled into a false sense of security.

BTW, how many are preparing for Y2K?  A bigger risk than slow
Internet service IMHO...

&gt; If you know you are at no risk from some particular threat there is
&gt; no reason to take precautions against it.  Parents, believing their
&gt; children to be safe from porn, won't see any need to supervise them.


Where are these "belivers"?

&gt;How cheated they will feel when they discover their children have been
&gt;playing with porn all while the Government said it couldn't happen.


No more so than when - after having heard that
there will never, ever be a GST, that there will,
I suppose...

&gt;The Government, through this legislative deceit, has made the Internet
&gt;a much more dangerous place for our children.


Terrific!  That's just what we *don't* need to have people believe...

You are forgetting that there are plenty of very warm, useful sites
around... where people can get (and, hopefully, share) good advice
on many topics & problems...

The Internet is NOT dangerous... but thinking make it so...

Unless, of course, that you feel that a university library is
- in any way - dangerous...

Before you leave this classroom, Davey, I want you to write
100 times:

   "Internet = Library"

(you may do so using any convenient scripting or prog'g lang. ;)

&gt;Yours Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;David Newall

That domain name wil also *not* help the cause...

Hey!  You wanna be effective in this...
or just get air-time and/or publication-area?!?  ;)

A guy like you - who's (no doubt) "been in the com-
puter industry for over a quarter century" like 'Maddog'
should really have more positive things to say about
the Internet than I've read recently from you... IMHO.

Have it your way... ;)
