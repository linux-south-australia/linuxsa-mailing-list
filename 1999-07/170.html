&gt;Has anyone looked a bit closer at how this is done?  It would be nice
&gt;to see how they achieve it.  My guess would be chrooted environments.

I suspect chrooted environments is the way it's done. I'm pretty sure. If
you like this method, then have a look at the "Virtual Services Howto". A
better (in my humble opinion) way to implement this is with the sendmail
virtual user table. Everything you need to know about this feature of
sendmail is at sendmail.org, but you may be able to work it out just using
the comments in sendmail.cf. Directly editing sendmail.cf is not for the
faint hearted, but it's also not *that* scary.

With the sendmail virtual user table (unlike the /etc/aliases table) you
can specify that <A HREF="mailto:jbloggs@domain1.com.au">jbloggs@domain1.com.au</A> can go to local user 'joeb', and
<A HREF="mailto:jbloggs@domain2.com.au">jbloggs@domain2.com.au</A> can go to <A HREF="mailto:joe@someotherisp.net.au">joe@someotherisp.net.au</A>, etc, etc. If you
require that a virtual user goes to multiple accounts, you then point it to
a sendmail alias, because the virtual user table only allows you to map one
virtual account to one real account.

Although the "Virtual Services Howto" method is quite a clever solution,
with the ftp daemon, apache and sendmail, you can overcome all the problems
of hosting many domains on one box. You still need some sort of glue to
hold it all together, and I'd suggest (of course) a little bit of perl.

The advantage of perl as a glue, is that it's a lot like super glue. It
does the job extremely well, and you need surprisingly little of it. In
fact the whole point of perl is that you can "use it sparingly".

Cheers

Alex!

...I should have taken the blue pill.
