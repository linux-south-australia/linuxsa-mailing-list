Just a general comment on the 2.2.x kernel & rh6.0

Kernel
------
The 2.2.x kernel still has some bugs in it. They affect the following
areas:
	- networking
	- filesystem
	
The networking is not on the high priority list.
The filesystem is! The reason on some highlevel 64bit machines it can kill
the filesystem. Chances of this happening are VERY remote but it's being
fixed as we speak.

(Aren't you glad i386/486/586/686 are 32 bit not 64!)

Networking will be fixed later.


RH6.0
------
Remeber redhat 6 uses egcs as a compiler. This is a C compiler that is
designed with optimisation for pentiums,686's,ppros and the like.
Even without optimisation on (no -O) this compiler is still NOT endorsed
as a stable compiler (talk about your kernel not working with egcs on
linux-kernel list and you'll get flamed). Hence since most of RH6 has been
compiled with egcs it isn't as stable.

I noticed this when I went from a stable 5.2 system running kernel 2.1.121
(which became 2.2.0) to rh 6. I used the same kernel, just recompiled it
in rh6. I noticed I was getting more sig 11 errors that day. (Overclocking
is not the cause. My P133 has been running at 188 for 3 years fine).

So just remeber next time you complain with rh6 that you system is
unstable it might be due to egcs. 


Quote from /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes (kernel 2.3.11)
----------------------------------------------------------------

"   Note that the latest compilers (egcs, pgcc, gcc 2.8) may do Bad
Things while compiling your kernel, particularly if absurd
optimizations (like -O9) are used.  Caveat emptor.  Currently, the only
C compiler available in a binary distribution is egcs.  Version 1.0.3
seems okay; if you have to have a binary, you may be successful using
that.  In general, however, gcc-2.7.2.3 is known to be stable, while
egcs and others have not been as thoroughly tested yet."


Cheers,
