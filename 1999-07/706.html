Hi.

C41S, time to open your eyes, move away from the screen for a bit, and
see what is happening in the real world. There _are_ people in
Australia who cannot afford a home pc. To suggest that they go to the
library for net access takes a lot of the power away from the ease of
information access.

If you can't leave the screen, how about dropping by the Australian B.
of Stats, and check out how many families are running subsistance these
days. Guess what? It's growing!

Yes there's plenty of $ in Australia, but only for the lucky (that's
US) Spare a thought for those less fortunate than ourselves, will you?
The proposition that "because _I_ can afford a pc then the world is
rosy, and those who cannot can go to the library" is offensive.

Nobody would WANT their friend/kid/lover accessing the net via C64, but
if that was the only way, I'd welcome it!

Michael

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; there are people out there C41S,
&gt;&gt; who cannot afford to buy that neat 32bit PC.
&gt; 
&gt; In that case, *THAT* is the problem to be addressed IMHO.
&gt; Australia is NOT a "3rd world" country; there is plenty of $ here.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I'd rather some of them get connected to the information via
&gt;&gt; outdated technology than not at all.
&gt; 
&gt; The other point is that local public libraries
&gt; provide FREE Internet-access to all.
&gt; 
&gt; Rather than investing the time in 8-bit technologies
&gt; let those who "have not" use publicly owned 32-bit
&gt; technologies, so they can *enjoy* about the same
&gt; experience that we do.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; would these types rather be in an
&gt;&gt; 'Internet underclass' (a bit harsh)
&gt;&gt; or a 'no-internet underclass'?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They need not suffer either...
&gt; If you think about it, they can
&gt; get what we take for granted
&gt; (except those in the country &
&gt; bush, of course...)... at their
&gt; local libraries.  Simple, eh?
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Don't forget that the power is in the information,
&gt;&gt; not the gee-wiz graphics.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't (I still use mostly text-based USENET newsgroups,
&gt; myself, for this reason...)
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Lynx is cool for cutting to the chase and forgetting about
&gt;&gt; the eye candy. I'll bet you could use lynx from a C64.
&gt; 
&gt; Nope... except for a museum demo (like using Morse
&gt; code in a world where it's obsolete in its professional
&gt; applications, e.g. Ship-to-Shore comm's); while there's
&gt; nothing wrong with doing historic demonstrations of
&gt; quaint, old technologies, I'm sure you wouldn't want
&gt; YOUR kid/friend/lover being limited to Internet accessed
&gt; only via 8-bit technology... or am I wrong, here?
&gt; 
&gt; "Friends don't let friends surf the 'net using 8-bit boxes"  :)
&gt; 
&gt; "Why not the best?"
