This is my last public comment on this thread.  Private emails
may or may not be responded to on this thread.

The Open Source Community can do what it wants.  If you don't
think LinuxSA, myself or anyone is doing things right you have
the Freedom (as in the spirit of Free Software) to do whatever
you want.

Raise yourself to the occassion Chuck, start doing things rather
than sitting on the sidelines complaining.  Many others have, and
many more will.  You have the Freedom to do it.

&gt; I simply suggested that "behind closed doors"
&gt; planning was out-of-character for Linux-ists... &

Rubbish.  The first steps of any projects takes co-ordination
of the infrastructure.  Linux did not release the kernel until
0.1 he had done work by himself without any involvement.  Have 
a look at *any* Open Source project you will find that most of
them started 'behind closed doors'.  When the time was right 
the projects opened.

The same is with this.  You will just have to wait.  I actually
now regret even hinting that something was even remotely getting
planned.

In time more things will be said about it. 

Regards,

Matthew
