&gt; &gt; In a similar vein to this topic.... noted with interest the way
&gt; &gt; the media is playing up the ppl who blew themselves up with
&gt; &gt; home made bombs built from plans obtained from the internet.
&gt;
&gt;Sorry?  Obtained from *WHERE*?


For a moment there, I thought Newt' was going to get technical
and distinguish the Internet from some server (on the Internet)
where the item of information in question might have been.

&gt;According to comments made by police investigators on NSW radio 
&gt;earlier today, there is no credible evidence that the Internet
&gt;had anything to do with it.  It's a lead they're pursuing, but
&gt;not a particularly high investigative priority.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Whilst I have nothing but sympathy for the victims & their
&gt; &gt; families, I cannot believe that the INTERNET is being blamed for
&gt; &gt; this tragedy!! Heard some anti-internet comments already
&gt; &gt; from some pollies abt it!!
&gt;
&gt;Yes! And some ISPs! :-)
&gt;
&gt;It's another media beat-up.  You just watch:  Every story about
&gt;rape, child abuse, explosives, racism, and sex for the next six 
&gt;months will feature the Internet, even if there's absolutely no
&gt;link whatsoever between the topic under discussion and the 'net[*].


It's not just the Internet that gets bad press...
a person was hauled into court for taking &
keeping his own library of photo's of a child
in his care (in Adelaide), eventually fined, etc.

In each of the two articles, he was described
as a member of &lt;a specific&gt; church.

In another article, the story was told of a group
of people who were apparently responsible for
a crime of some sort (e.g. break & entry); the
article ended with "the people were described
as aboriginals"

Of course, these 3 story-bits are very inconsis-
tent with the Press Council's Code of Conduct
for newspapers... I'm not aware of any com-
plaints having been laid arising from any of these.

I believe that anyone concerned with balanced
reporting of the Internet should scream loudly
(i.e. report the matters cooly to the Press Council)
each and every time it happens... AND

keep those stories & letters about the GOOD
side of the Internet flowing in the competition
of ideas... not just to your (apparently deaf) MP's,
but to editors, local "free" papers (as articles),
etc.

Maybe invite people to some special "public"
Internet Information Meetings (Show & Tell's)
show them what the press & TV doesn't and
help balance the scales...

Another interpretation for "Publish or Perish"?
