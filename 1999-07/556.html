&gt; There is need - e.g. by local resellers & consultants (is SA) - of
&gt; people (here) willing to help generate business on Linux-based
&gt; systems; I sometimes wonder if at least *some* of the periodic
&gt; "where can I get RedHat Linux x.x?" type questions are meant
&gt; to generate sales (initial & follow-on) for the local Linux reseller,
&gt; even when there are others (in Australia) who may be price-
&gt; competitive... or stock a broader range of products... we're
&gt; used to "deli's" here, so it's not so surprising...

you know, there is one in every mail list that i have ever seen..you
know, the one who makes outrageous, and unsupported, comments, then sits
back, smugly satisfied with the other people in the group reacting to
their nonsense.
our children behaved similarly at two. they outgrew it.

fyi, i was one of the pople who has written about 'where can i obtain
rhxx'. not one email from netcraft did i receive. not one complaint that
other made offers to me of free copies.

not once, not ever, has netcraft attempted to make any ploy for sales to
the group at large. they host this list for zip, nothing, not even, it
seems, for common respect and gratitude. if you have evidence, please,
make it available. else it seems like you may have overdosed on the
x-files.
