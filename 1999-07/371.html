<PRE>
I, like many, lurk this list with a passion.  A passion for Linux, Unix,
technology and the way all three fit together so well. I am NOT
interested in bickering.  I believe this is not what this list was/is
intended for.  

That said, I think this list( read: the people subscribed to this list )
have, in general, an excellent thing going here.  All of my questions to
this list have been met with polite and concise answers or pointers to
the answers and have been very helpful.  Someone on this list even
called it family, and in general I would have to agree.

Lately however, there has been more noise on this list than Linux
related signals.  I am unfortunately contributing to that noise but I
felt it needed to be said. I apologise.  

I am concerned that if people will be replied to in a sarcastic and
condescending manner that they will be offended an less likely to
contribute. (Something very core to the Linux culture)  Not only that,
but their distrust will be redirected not only to the individual but the
list and eventually to Linux users as has happened in the past.

In Short.
Grandma's Rule:
	If you don't have anything nice, uplifting or encouraging to say don't
say it!

Discipline and correction I believe can be more effective if done in a
non-distructive way.  I hope others share in my passion for Linux,
LinuxSA and this list to restore it to what it was about 6 months ago.

I am now wearing my asbestos suit. :) but remember if you play with fire
you are going to get burned.

My $2 worth.
