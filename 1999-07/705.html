G'day Darryl,

 &gt; The script was working. It has stopped working. I gave all the information I
 &gt; could think of. I haven't changed anything that I can remember, only
 &gt; upgraded the m/b and ram.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Error Log:
 &gt; 
 &gt; [Thu Jul 22 17:00:46 1999] [error] [client 203.31.252.50] Premature end of
 &gt; script headers: /home/httpd/cgi-bin/MailMan.cgi

This is kind of a catch-all phrase Apache uses, but in essence it
means it failed before finding the area of the script that has the
headers in it.

This can happen if:

1) It didn't actually access the file due to permissions problems.
Compare your program with the sample program and see if they have the 
same permissions. If not, give MailMan.cgi the same permissions as the 
sample.

2) It could access the file but an error occured before it reached the 
section with the headers.  One really common cause is the path for
perl. Make sure it matches the path on your system.

Another common cause is when a script has paths that you have to set
for your system and you either have it incorrect, the file it's trying 
to access doesn't have the required permissions set.  

Next would be leaving off the ";" at the end of a line that requires
it. Not all lines require this, but it's easy enough to find if run
the program from the command line. 

3) Premature end of script headers. (No really). Apache requires at
least:

print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

Usually the problem is solved before then, and since the program
worked in the past, it's probably one of the other items mentioned
above. 


 &gt; The sample script that comes with MailMan *does* work. And I have checked
 &gt; and the path to perl is the same in both of them.

Opps didn't see this.  Next to check would be permissions. 


Cheers,
Gaelyne
