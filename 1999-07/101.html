<H1>Linux SA mailing list... Send ONLY to Linux SA</H1>
<!-- Header="End" -->
<!-- Body="Start" -->
<PRE>
A while ago (quite a while ago),
I suggested that Linux SA try a
newsgroup, i.e. instead of the
present mailing list...

Why?

For one thing, we seem to like to use
"Reply to All" when firing back replies

This causes TWO copies of the reply
(one with and one without the Linux SA
mailing-list .sig file attached) to arrive
as the originator's e-mail address is
also used - on the reply - as one of the
destination addresses.

Also, a mailing-list - like the trendy new
"push" technologies around - "force"
one to receive all of the stuff sent by
anyone else on the list...

Of course, a newsgroup lets one see
- up front - the subject line, i.e. before
deciding whether to download/read
a message...

Since we have a tradition to uphold
(or Netcraft does, as keeper of the
Lniux SA archive...), I suppose that
the mailing-list is set in concrete,
so to speak...

But, is it possible that the list's
re-mailer could be re-worked,
i.e. so that it strips off all of the
destination addresses, leaving
just Linux SA's adr in place...

so that we each get ONE copy
of anything posted (as we would
do if the newsgroup model were
used)?

That *is* one of the benefits of
having the source-code isn't it?

Or, am I wrong...?  If so,
What am I missing?

(The technical change that
I'm suggesting should not
limit Free Speech in any way

nor should it force anybody
to fiddle manually - as I often do -
with the destination addresses
of their outgoing replies...

It should just minimize the no.
of copies that we all receive
of Linux SA's gems & hot coals
that come our way... as well as
minimize bandwidth consumption
slightly... ;)

What'cha think?
