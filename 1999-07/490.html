Has anybody else heard/read any rumors of
plans to port Lotus Domino/Notes to Linux?

Here's the only one I've found so far:

&gt; So that I can properly weigh the relavence to
&gt; current versions of both Notes & Exchange,
&gt; can you tell me when it was written (and any-
&gt; thing else that may be relavent to the question)?

The earliest stuff was added to the list
just after I was forced to actually start using
That Piece Of MicroCrap (tm) in 1997.

The most recent stuff dates from March & April, 1999.

&gt; Are there any other comparisons (e.g. any
&gt; from the opposing (e.g. MS Xchng) camp)?

If there are, I am completely unaware of them and proud.
As I said, I never claimed my page was fair or even accurate.
As far as I can tell, the only pro-Exchange stuff
(and there isn't much) is located on microsoft.com or
at the web pages of people who don't know any better.

&gt; Was Domino/Notes ever ported to Linux?

It's on its way but not yet released.

I'm expecting it out in beta in September or October.

Not sure.

It's for sure they'll have SOMEthing out by January 2000 or they'll
have 8,800 Notes people throwing food at them at Lotusphere 2000.
