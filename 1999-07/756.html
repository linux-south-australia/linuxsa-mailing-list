&gt; &lt;shrug&gt;  The definition of "I/O and CPU intensive stuff" is changing,
&gt; though.  Try running RealPlayer-G2 on a 486 Linux box.  Or listen to
&gt; an MP3.  Or run Applixware.  Or play Quake-II.  Or run Netscape 4.x.

For those wondering about '486s, the reality is:

  - Applix works fine (it ran fine on my Sun SLC, so I'm not surprised)
  - StarOffice doesn't (because, as Marks says, a lot of application
    software sux)
  - MP3s play, but bladeenc runs overnight
  - RealPlayer works, but don't do anything else.
  - Netscape 4.x is really slow, but just usable.
  - You will obviously die young if playing network Quake.
  - GNOME+E runs, but is too slow to be useable

The machine is a Acer 433 with the fastest 486 chip I could find (33 BogoMIPS)
with 40MB memory, IDE disk and 2 x 1GB SCSI disk.  This compares to my work
machine, some PentiumII thingie at 400 BogoMIPS + 128MB + 6GB EIDE disk.

I would not recommend typical 486 hardware for people consciously buying at
the low end.  Because:

  1. The IDE drive bus doesn't allow reasonable drive capacity.
     Get and EIDE drive bus.  The IDE bus can't address a CD-ROM
     drive, and SCSI CD-ROM drives are $$$.

  2. The non-EDO memory is scarce, and thus expensive.

Acer 486s in particular suck.  The onboard video RAM is a 4-bit wide
TI chip second-sourced by Acer.  Now Acer has gone out of the fabrication
business and the chips are unobtainable.  So you are stuck with 8-bit
colour.  The motherboard is incredibly propietary.  You can't shut off
just the motherboard serial ports, so the necessary add-in 16550 serial
board is problematic.

If you are buying low-end: EIDE is a must, EDO memory is better, 16650
serial is a must.  Check the XFree documentation for the graphics card.
If it's long and involved, then save yourself the pain.  PCI bus is a
huge win -- I have yet to see a ISA USB card.  All of this is pretty
standard PentiumI specs.

Mind you, I do have a PC running the latest vendor-supported supported
OS for less than three figures.  Try that with a Microsoft OS.  Then
again, the software (Applix, ~$170) did cost more than double the machine,
so maybe Bill may not be entirely unhappy with the precedent :-)

Whilst I agree with Mark about application requirements being the
driver for Linux hardware upgrades, I do think that the Linux low
end will always be much lower than the Windows low end.  Partly
because the embedded Linux community want it that way.  Partly
because so much Linux development happens in countries that have
difficulty purchasing the latest Intel products.  And partly
because a lot of programmers would happily spend a few hundred
dollars on a test machine that they can run experimental software
on, meaning that Mark's old machine probably won't be tossed away
when he buys a new one.
