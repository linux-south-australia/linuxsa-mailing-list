&gt; Could someone tell me the relationship between "screen" and "pty's" ?

	Background info:

	/dev/is filled with a bunch of files like /dev/tty?? or /dev/pty??.
	Ptys and ttys are linked like a pipe (actually, it's a stream, but 
	don't worry about that): for each tty there is a corresponding pty.
	Data written in the pty end gets read out the tty end of the stream,
	and vice-versa.

	At the pty end of the stream, there is either a network connection,
	a terminal driver (the code that talks to the video card on your
	machine), X windows, or something like the screen command.

	At the tty end of the stream sits the application program: your
	shell, mail program, text editor, whatever.

	The purpose of the stream is to process any data that passes 
	through it. The keystrokes from your keyboard are fed into the
	pty. The stream does a number of things: it buffers your data
	(so it isn't fed to the application at the tty end until you 
	hit 'enter'), it watches for backspace characters or ctrl-u
	characters, and uses these to delete (all) characters from
	the buffer), and it converts  some characters into unix signals	
	(whenever the terminal stream sees a ctrl-c character, it sends
	a SIGINT to whichever application is listening at the tty end of
	things). It also does certain substitutions, like converting
	the newline/carriage return pairs to plain newline characters etc.

	When the application at the tty end writes output, the stream
	does processing as well (stripping the 8th bit from characters,
	nl-&gt;crnl conversions, and so on).
	(Ever wondered why half the options to the stty(1) command screw
	up your terminal so badly? Stty is used to set what processing
	the stream does/doesn't do).
	
	All this spawns from the days when people connected to computers
	using dumb terminals and serial cables.

	Enter screen. The screen command opens a bunch of pty/tty streams,
	and starts the relevant program at the tty end of each stream.
	It then controls which pty the keyboard input/screen output is 
	written to/read from.

&gt; No more PTY's.
&gt; Sorry could not find a PTY.
&gt; Screen is terminating

	Could be:

	1) all the ptys are in use (are you running X? Are there a lot
	of people logged into your machine?)
	2) the version of screen you are trying to run is too old,
	or compiled for an older version of linux.
	As of redhat 6, linux uses the SYSV/ptmux method of allocating
	ptys to a low-level drivers programs,whereas RH5 used the
	try&deny method of grabbing a pty.

	Run the following:

	strace -o screen.trace screen pine

	and post the last coupla lines to the mailing list (or to me,
	whatever), this should hopefully make it clear what is going 
	wrong...

J.
