&gt;

Hmmm, my observation is that they don't seem to do a good job of making
sure that the source code they release corresponds to what has been
released as a binary CD.

Case in point.  I had to get iBCS2 running on a customer's dual pentium
machine under 2.0.36.

I copied the 2.0.36 source RPM, and then installed the the iBCS2 source RPM
and built it after making the one line change for SMP, and it crashed.

There were clashes between kernel include files and non-kernel include
files that I had to conditionalize around.

RH could not have built the iBCS2 RPM without fixing these problems, but
they did not, it seems, release the fixes.

However, perhaps, since the problems are kernel source related, like those
that you get into if you build a 2.2.10AC12 kernel on a 2.2.9 system, they
submitted the patches back to the keepers of the kernel source, and they
were not picked up.

I have reported the 2.2.9 vs 2.2.10 kernel source problems (same #define
being defined in two kernel files without condoms) to AC, who says he is
working on cleaning those up.
