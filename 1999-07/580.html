Linux should be pretty blindingly fast on that sort of machine. I know
that my 333mhz celeron with 64mb of ram zips along, and the 458mhz one
at home with 160mb goes even faster.
I suspect that your problem in X is related you having no swap device
though.. linux, plus a full suite of server daemons, plus X and gnome
and enlightenment, adds up to less than 64mb, certainly. But by the time
you've loaded netscape as well I'd say you'd be using at least 32mb of
ram.
On a 64mb machine I wouldn't have thought this would be a hassle of
course!
However, if you could give us the output from running things like 'free'
and 'df' then we may be able to help further. Unfortunately, just saying
"it crashes sometimes" alone cannot help us empathically determine the
fault.

&gt; Well, I don't know what could go wrong in a strait forward installation of
&gt; Linux, however, I know that I have a Linux 5.2 running on 350 MHz Pentium II
&gt; machine with 64 MB of Memory, and the damn thin is so slow.. Well, it is
&gt; especially slow when I am in Xwindows.  What's even more frustrating is that
&gt; Netscape runs out of memory frequently and shuts off and sometimes it even
&gt; shuts down Xwindows.  Really frustrating but have no clue why this is
&gt; happening...
&gt;      I am assuming someone out there has had a similar problem considering
&gt; the fact that I have not run anything special on this machine..
