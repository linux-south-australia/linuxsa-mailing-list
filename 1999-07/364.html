&gt; 
&gt; There are courses available in reading comprehension skills
&gt; (often given by TAFE or Uni's to incoming students, by way of
&gt; preparing them for the step "up" from high school reading.)
&gt; 

Yes, I quite agree with you. Your statement of facts is impeccable. You
sneering sarcasm is as well. Perhaps if you read my replies, or many of
the other replies or posts I have made to this list you might find my
English is quite good.

I did note a while back that you received a number of flames for you
apparent attitude. Do not tell me this information; tell this to the
people who are illiterate.

&gt; &gt;&gt; As 'Maddog' seemed to suggest, last night, if one oversells (e.g.
&gt; &gt;&gt; by unduly raising expectations) Linux, it's easy to lose a market.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; What people like about any system is all-round reliability... not:
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'at least you get some type of workable system' (SA excepted?)
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Some people would prefer to have some type of workable system
&gt; &gt; rather than no system at all. I am one of them.
&gt; 
&gt; I see that you are... no problem.  I was actually thinking about the
&gt; business/corporate & educational markets (where MS is strong)
&gt; 

Your point, again, is unclear. Even people in business and education
prefer to have a workable system....

&gt; &gt; Perhaps I'm not one of the market share.
&gt; 
&gt; You may be in the home/personal/hobby market.
&gt; 

You may try to pur me into some kind of box, but that's your choice.
Those on this list who know me in person know that I decline to conform
to any artificial standards or boxes which are inappropriate for me.

&gt; &gt;I posted one question on this list and received enough information to
&gt; &gt;figure out what I had done wrong. Perhaps this is in itself a selling
&gt; &gt;point? Now I have a fully working system.
&gt; 
&gt; That's good to hear.
&gt; 

As a corollary, I also had someone imply that I need some type of course
to improve my English. I have actually been through a number of those
courses and my English skills are impeccable. Incidentally, Mensa have
also invited me to take the test for entry into their association. To
enter that association you need an IQ which exceeds 98% of the
population...do I need to say any more?

&gt; There are, of course, similar lists for MS products & you can find lots
&gt; of people like yourself who have had similar experiences with them...

People like myself? Please EXPLAIN. You are describing someone I don't
recognise.

DAVID.
