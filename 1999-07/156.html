Those interested in on-topic messages and high signal-to-noise ratios
might like to skip this message (and, indeed, the rest of this entire
thread).

 &gt; A while ago (quite a while ago),
 &gt; I suggested that Linux SA try a
 &gt; newsgroup, i.e. instead of the
 &gt; present mailing list...
 &gt; Why?
 &gt; For one thing, we seem to like to use
 &gt; "Reply to All" when firing back replies

That's due in large part to the fact that in an attempt to surround
yourself in a private "criticism-free-zone," you've told everyone you
don't like to refrain from sending you private email.  That means if
someone disagrees violently with something you've said they must
either allow your prattle to remain unchallenged or reply to the whole
list.

Asinine, isn't it?

I'd *love* to be able to reply to some of your messages (like this
one, for example) without including everyone else, but your ridiculous
desire to have everyone else treat you specially means that my
alternatives are (a) reply to the list, (b) reply exclusively to you
and have you fill my mailbox with moans about how you've previously
demanded that I refrain from sending you email and vague, impotent
threats about what you'll do if it continues, or (c) shut the hell up.
The situation is especially ironic when you consider that if I had
ever demanded that you stop sending me mail, you would have countered
with some pithy criticism about my commitment to free speech.

(c) is not usually an option: The value of the mailing list can only
decrease if people have the unfettered ability to spurt blatantly
wrong assumptions, accusations and prejudices without them being
openly challenged or privately corrected.  You've closed off the
private correction option for the vast multitude of blatantly wrong
things you post, which leaves public debate as the only alternative
-- Then people complain about the degraded signal-to-noise ratio on
the list.

Expecting everyone else to change to suit your somewhat unique
world-view (e.g.: by redefining the mailing list as a newsgroup
because you don't like dual-replies you get from the "reply to all"
function in most mailers) is not The Solution(tm) to your problem.
You need to start viewing *yourself* as part of the problem and 
find a solution which doesn't involve you staying exactly the way you
are while everyone else dances around your oh-so-special needs and
demands.

I propose an alternative: I'll create a new mailing list called
"<A HREF="mailto:reply-to-meaningless-drivel@atdot.dotat.org">reply-to-meaningless-drivel@atdot.dotat.org</A>", which anyone can
subscribe to.  Everyone on LinuxSA and everyone else you've sent "stop
sending me private mail" bitch-o-grams to can subscribe to that list;
Then anytime they want to send you an off-topic post (as replies to
your messages invariably are) they can Cc: it to the list to make sure
it's not private email, and remove LinuxSA from the Cc: line at the
same time.

You'll have boundless control over the way it works too: if you post
things which make a positive contribution, announcements of work *you*
have done (instead of demands that everyone else implement your
wonderful ideas), answer questions, stay on-topic, delay criticism of
people who are doing useful and valued work until you've started to
understand what they're doing and generally stop posting meaningless
drivel that looks like it has been formatted on a Commodore 64 in
40-column mode, you'll find that the "reply-to-meaningless-drivel"
list will remain gratifyingly empty.

Does anyone have any comments on my proposal?
