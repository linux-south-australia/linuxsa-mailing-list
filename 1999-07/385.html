&gt; I'd like to learn about QOS, and the vaguely related traffic shaping,
&gt; but I've never got around to it yet. If you find some up to date info,
&gt; can you pass it along to me too?

	QOS (Quality of Service) or TOS (Type of Service) is pretty
	much restricted to the IP level... AFAIK, the primary role
	behind TOS in IP packets is to ensure that intermediate
	routers channel them faster (does anyone other than cisco 
	actually do this, though?).


	While you can easily set the TOS on outgoing traffic (modify 
	the source code to ssh, irc, whatever, to call setsockopt(IP_TOS)
	on the socketi), using the TOS to filter incoming data could be 
	'interesting'.

	The IP headers are stripped, but the TOS information is still 
	passed to the TCP level. But since all the TCP packets to a particular
	port are being queued on the same queue (same port, y'see), then
	the only real way to get a performance boost would be to
	give the server handling that particular TCP port a bigger share of
	the CPU time (?)
	If traffic of different precedences (precedents?) were all put on 
	the port/queue, TOS would make more sense (given all the packets
	have the same TOS (by merit of their destination port), then
	there's no point sorting packets on the receive queue of a TCP 
	port, because they're all effectively equal (Does this make any 
	sense?)).

&gt; Oh, and irc and icq as high priority too ;)

	Pray that your irc/icq traffic never passes thru one of *MY* 
	routers then. &gt;:)
