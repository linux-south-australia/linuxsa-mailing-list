Hi.

Something weird going on with my ZIP Plus drive. (RedHat 6.0, linux
2.2.5 with imm  module)

I recompiled the kernel, included the imm driver as module.
Hooked the ZIP to the parallel port (I don't have the SCSI plug).
Loaded the imm module with modprobe.
Had a hard time to find what the device was :).
Mounted the ZIP on /dev/sda4 on to /mnt/z.
cd'ed and ls'ed OK.
Mounted a samba share over /mnt/z and called it zip.
Went to a NT workstation, the share was there.
Tried to open it: "An unexpected network error has occurred" (as far as
I think there are no expected errors, but ...).
Went back to Linux, where the current path still was /mnt/z and:
ls: Segmentation Fault
ls (again): blocked. Ctrl-Z and CTRL-C of no use.
Changed xterm, cd'ed to /mnt/z and ls: blocked
Changed xterm, ps'ed and tried to kill both processes: none will die!!!
(yes, with SIGKILL or 9)
ps labels the ls processes with a D.
Tried to unmount: device or resource busy.
/proc/mount reports the zip as mounted.
Couldn't kill the procs, not even changing to runlevel 1.
Did the obvious thing to kill the processes: rebooted.
Now it locks booting with: "Remounting root filesystem in R/W mode".
(maybe it's because the ZIP is still attached to the parallel port.

Now, the questions are:
	What happened?
	What does the D process status mean?
	Are there processes that can't be killed by root? (what about kill -9
-1 (kids, don't try this at home))

Thank you.
