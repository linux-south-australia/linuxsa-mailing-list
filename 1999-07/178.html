As someone who is running an SIS chipset on a system at home I sympathise.
When I tried to get my SIS 5597/5598 Pc Chips motherboard system running on
Linux I had the same problem.
Suse have written drivers for SIS chipsets and the latest xfree86 (3.3.3.1?)
version supports the bloody lot.

What I (still a relative newbie) did wasn't the most high tech solution but
it worked well.
I can't remember if your SIS6326 chipset is directly supported on the Linux
4 Dummies release. If it is i.e. SIS6326 comes up as a supported video card
on the list during install, then skip my next paragraph.

Go and buy, beg, steal, etc then install a copy of Redhat 6 (or any other
distribution with a late kernel and xfree version) as it has the latest
version of xfree86. This is a good idea anyway irrespective of your video
problem. For more info on xfree86 check <A HREF="http://www.xfree.org">http://www.xfree.org</A> 

Choose a relatively simple video mode eg. 640x480x8bit and if your monitor
isn't mentioned exactly, choose 'generic monitor' or whatever the absolute
simplest monitor is on the list.

If this works then experiment a little by changing the settings one at a
time to see exactly how far you can push things. This approach worked for
me.

If this doesn't work then you will have to do one of the following:-

Scream for help again and hope one of the less-newbie type gurus will
answer.

Install a more common video card as suggested previously.

Shoot the b######d who sold you the mother-of-a-board in the first place.

As a general note on SIS equipped motherboards, the following statements are
purely 'IMHO' and are therefore open to correction, flaming, lawsuits, etc,
etc. I think what I'm trying to say is that while they do work, I don't like
them and think there are better options out there.

&lt;steps on soapbox&gt;

Reasons to hate SIS video chipsets-
1.   They are a right pain to set up on Linux unless you have late a
distribution. Even then a strong spiritual connection to a higher being
helps.
2.   Even Win NT can have nasty problems if the ram settings aren't
configured absolutely perfectly in BIOS.
3.   They come on a lot of relatively cheap motherboards eg, PC Chips. If PC
Chips can sell you a board with sound, video, 10/100 nic, 56k modem (win
modem of course) and the luxury of socket370 and Slot1 cpu support plus all
the usual I/O features on the one board for less than $200 then my brain
thinks that the word 'compromise' might spring to mind. You gets what you
pays for.

&lt;steps off soapbox&gt;

I hope some of this rambling helps. Too long in the Alice screws ones brain.
Being a Queenslander doesn't help either.

Hi All,

Total newbie here, in fact I am still surrounded by the shell fragments.

I have RedHat 5.2 (Linux for Dummies) but I'm having problems getting XFree
to configure. My System is SiS6236 motherboard with on-board Video and
sound.  The only information about the graphics is:-

Built in high performance 64bit 3D AGP Graphics
Acceleratorwith 8MB frame buffer.

I've RTFM but have been unable to extract any detail to produce a workable
XF86Config.  I have tried many permutations and combination of parameters
in Xconfigurator and edited the resulting config file every which way but
with no luck.

I have surfed far and wide on the net but only found questions - no
answers; most likely because I am also a Net newbie and am not looking in
the right places.  There are many reviews extolling the excellence of the
Sis graphics but of course they all refere to it's performance under "that
other OS" which I can confirm - it gives very good results under W98.

The only advice I have so far is via Packet radio to disable the on board
graphics and use a known plug in adapter.  Seems a pity to not use the
in-built hardware besides having to unzip the hip pocket.


Can any of you kind gentlemen point me in the right direction as to where
to look or how to proceed.

it.
