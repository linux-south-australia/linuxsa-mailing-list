This may be slightly off-topic, but...

The software that I am working on here (at work) has a requirement for a
new user interface. Numerous people here have suggested that we do some
sort of Wizard-like tool, and use this as the primary UI. (There is need
for a great deal of hand-holding in this program)

One idea is to define some sort of grammar for describing wizards, their
screens, and the way they fit together, and then write a program to
parse this. To me, this sounds a little like what I imagine certain
Linux tools do (eg LinuxConf, and the Kernel reconfiguration GUI -- or
whatever it's called). I was wondering if anyone has any opinions on how
best to go about this, or any corrections as to my understanding of the
abovementioned tools. Would it be advisable to build from scratch, or is
it likely/possible that a pre-existing GPL'd tool may fit the bill with
minor modification? The interface needs to be fairly flexible, and
preferably able to integrate some graphical tools into it (whether by
calling them separately, or embedding their display in a window). It
also needs to be easily modifiable for different clients, and new
features should be easily added...

TIA

PS: I haven't yet had the chance to look at any of the doco on the above
tools, as I am at work, and we run Solaris (hence, this is not strictly
Linux-specific, but It is relevant to GPL'd software, and we would like
to port our software to Linux (and NT) at some stage in the
not-too-distant future).
