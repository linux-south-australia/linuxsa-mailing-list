Hey Steve..... you sent me my own message ?!?!?! :)

&gt; Hi... hoping someone knows enough abt SQUID to help with this
&gt; problem.....
&gt;
&gt; Background:
&gt; We (ISP in Mt Gambier) run SQUID-NOVM .... having a real problem with
&gt; www.hotmail.com & hotmail.com ..... bloody MS keeps setting up
&gt; redirects to other addresses... all well & good UNTIL they drop that
&gt; address & use another one... at that point any user who tries to get
&gt; into www.hotmail.com or hotmail.com will get the cached "previous
&gt; address" from our proxy server & never get to hotmail!!!!!
&gt; A "sort of fix" is that under NETSCAPE a reload usually works & you
&gt; get there eventually, M$IE's refresh option doesnt seem to work
&gt; anywahere near as well.!!!
&gt; The behaviour of M$/Hotmail is a pain in the bum & is causing high
&gt; levels of stress to some of our users :) My suggestion was yahoo or
&gt; hello :)
&gt;
&gt; Apparently these redirects are part of the "magic" of win2000 or some
&gt; such thing.!!) Anyway, I want to set up squid to NEVER cache anything
&gt; with www.hotmail.com or hotmail.com  to overcome the problem.
&gt;
&gt; Question(s):
&gt; In squid.conf under "TAG: no_cache " I can define ACL elements to NOT
&gt; be cached.... problem is I cannot really "play" with the settings on
&gt; the live system & do not have squid running on any of my systems...
&gt; and I am not sure if a URL is an acceptable "ACL element" as far as
&gt; squid is concerned.
&gt;
&gt; The 2 lines which are currently commented are
&gt; #acl QUERY urlpath_regex cgi-bin \?
&gt; #no_cache deny QUERY
&gt;
&gt; I cant find anything terribly helpful in the docs ... what I want to
&gt; do is to uncomment the above lines & modify the second to something
&gt; along the lines of:
&gt;
&gt; acl QUERY urlpath_regex  cgi-bin \?
&gt; no_cache deny www.hotmail.com
&gt; no_cache deny hotmail.com
&gt;
&gt; I know that to deny, I have to specifically "deny" an element ...
&gt; but...
&gt;
&gt; Do I need to add something to the first line?? what the hell does the
&gt; first line really mean anyway????
&gt; Will the above 2 lines work (a) on their own  (b) with something added
&gt; to the first line
&gt;
&gt; TIA, Phil
