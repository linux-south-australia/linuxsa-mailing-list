&gt; &gt;	When you telnet to localhost, there are 2 pty/tty pairs in action:
&gt; &gt;	the tty your original shell is attached to passes chars to the
&gt; &gt;	pty, which shoves them into the TCP socket that was opened by telnet.
&gt; &gt;	At the other end of the TCP socket, telnetd reads the chars in,
&gt; &gt;	and stuffs them into the second pty, which from whence they go
&gt; &gt;	through to the second tty, which is where your second shell (the
&gt; &gt;	'remote' shell) reads its  data from.
&gt; 
&gt; This is the only point that I cannot agree with here.  While the source to
&gt; telnet is in C++, it is not that hard to read, and there is no need for a
&gt; pseudo tty.

	Ugh! Where did that come from?
	Apologies, I should not reply to mail after 11pm at night...
	(Mind you, this reply is hardly any better -- kids, don't stay
	up late and email! :)

	Ok. Stdin, stdout, and stderr inheritted by the telnet client
	(file descriptors 0,1,2) point to a tty device. The keyboard 
	driver grabs characters from the keyboard driver, and pushes 
	them into a pty.
	They go through the pty, and gets processed along the way, and
	the processed input comes out the tty end (it appears as input
	on file descriptor 0 to the telnet client).

	Then the telnet client shoves the data in the TCP socket, which
	goes off to the telnetd server etc etc.

	There are still technically two stream in play, but my original
	paragraph is utter, sleep-deprived drivel. Ignore, please :)

&gt; Along the way I learned some other things.  I had assumed that when the
&gt; user at the client end types a ^C this is mapped to TCP urgent data (ie,
&gt; OOB). When I actually fired up ethereal and checked, I found another place
&gt; where I was wrong.  Of course, telnetd does not need to receive urgent
&gt; data, as it is sitting on a select waiting for data from either the pty or
&gt; the socket, and can react as soon as a ^C comes it.
[...]
&gt; Yup, it sure was ... 
&gt; 
&gt; I was wrong about most of what I said, and my penance was to go and check
&gt; it all out in the source.  Now I feel better for having done so.

	Dang! I gotta say, you're the first person I've met who actually
	did go and read the source. Tres impressed :)
