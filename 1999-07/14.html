Which bit do you/we have a problem with??? :) )

Must admit I was a bit disappointed that there's no removal of fingers for
improper use of the keyboard or more severe penalties for malicious
hacking....... but I spose you can;t have anything...... Really, the "policy"
(if enforcable/enforced) may well make some ppl THINK b4 trashing a system or
junkmailing etc etc!!

I suppose I am being cynical...but.. having spent part of the day involved in
cleaning up the mess left by what appears to be a DoS attack on our mail
server/network... I really dont see a lot wrong with Oman's Internet Usage
policy other than the lack of castration/decapitation etc for slightly less
trivial offences!

Being serious, Censorship is really quiite different to "rigid enforcement"of
a  code of acceptable behaviour!!  I did actually check out GTO's site on the
offchance they had some reference  to censorship but couldn't find anything!!
I wonder if they do really cut people off???

Btw, they also have similar rules for home telephone & GSM.... if you dont pay
your account, you can still get incoming calls for a week but instead of
outgoing you get a recorded message which says something like "Outgoing calls
have been suspended because you have not paid your account!!!!!! :)
