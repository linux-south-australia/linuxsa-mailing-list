"There was no reason why competitors could not test one another's products
and then make statements about that product in comparison with their own, Mr
Daenke said."

The above statement was at the end of an Advertiser article (today):

"GP taken to court over vein cream" - 7 Jul 99

"A WELL-KNOWN Adelaide doctor has been taken to the Supreme Court
to stop her revealing the results of a trial on the effectiveness of a
popular
spider vein cream.

Dr Sue McCoy runs the Laser, Skin and Vein Clinic in North Adelaide and
treats spider veins with traditional methods.

On March 8, she appeared in a television interview attempting to recruit
50 volunteers for a month-long, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to
test
the effectiveness of the "Vein Away" cream.

But soon after the program went to air, the Sydney-based manufacturers
and distributors of Vein Away threatened Dr McCoy with legal action."

Sound familiar?  Reminds us of the ban on revealing the results of tests
between software products (c.f. the license that comes with SQL Server).

Has anyone got/seen ideas for how to get around such bans, legally?

Are there any "kosher" (both respectibe -and- legally published) test-
results around which compare Linux to Win NT Server... -or- SQL Server
to any of the Linux-based "competition"...?

(Actually, I'm surprised that there aren't some hacker sites laden with
the "contrabanned" material... it would certainly make better reading
than Serial Numbers for proprietary software... ;)

"Sounds like a job for the ACCC"
A: Who was that masked man?
B: ACCC's Professor Fels, I reckon.
