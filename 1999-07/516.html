Hi Lai

Got a couple of AMD K6-III 400 as workstations
and heaps of K6 [-II] xxx as servers

They all run Linux flawlessly. 

Haven't bench marked them against Pentium III's

They all report BOGO MIPS of 2 * frequency (aprox 800 million
instructions a second for the K6-III 400)
note: BOGO gets its name from bogus, its a timing loop and is not a true
indicator of real app performance.  

CPU performance is generally not a bottleneck for servers. For example our
public web server a K6 233 with 3 million hits a month sits on 99.x% idle
(except when doing backups,etc) viz:

&gt; [<A HREF="mailto:adrian@dino">adrian@dino</A> adrian]$ uptime
&gt;  6:49pm  up 141 days, 22 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

In tests we've run to determine server configs, the bandwidth of the
coms gives in with 10M ether & IDE disk I/O with 100M ether well before the CPU
raises much more than a pulse with all the main services like Samba, NFS,
HTTPD, FTP. Trials we did with software RAID over 4 IDE drives & SCSI showed
processor power is not an issue here. And even our JAVA servlet & Postgres
Database apps cope fine at well above our loads.

I'm assuming you're not wanting to run high volume transaction servers, as
you'd have already been doing your own tests.

For us CPU is only an issue with the workstations for 3D graphics/games to keep
the 3D accelerators busy - here the K6-III's outperform the K6-II's. The slicker
larger caching of the III helps real apps get closer to those BOGO performance
levels!

My conclusion: Linux rocks with the AMD K6 series.

Regards
Adrian

&gt; How is the performance ?
&gt; Does it as fast as Pentium III 450 ( compare with AMD K6-III 450 ) ?
&gt; 
&gt; And does it run on Linux w/o a hitch ?
