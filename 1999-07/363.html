&gt; &gt; One of the things I like about Linux is that if something doesn't work
&gt; &gt; but you have a sneaking idea of why, you can actually fudge it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Although this might bugger up another part of one's system,
&gt; &gt; at least you get some type of workable system.
&gt; 
&gt; This kind of logic is really gonna help people buy into Linux (not).

Your attitude on this list is what will lose the market share. I was and
am expressing a personal opinion on a particular matter, note I said
**I** like. I didn't imply you, anyone else on the list, or that
nebulous market need like it at all.

&gt; &gt; In Windows, if it don't work, it just don't work.
&gt; 
&gt; I find the former applies to almost any multi-purpose, multitasking
&gt; system that I've ever worked with; I find the *opposite* of the latter
&gt; applies equally to each of them, too.
&gt; 

The former = what? The latter = what? Make yourself clear. 

&gt; As 'Maddog' seemed to suggest, last night, if one oversells (e.g.
&gt; by unduly raising expectations) Linux, it's easy to lose a market.
&gt; 
&gt; What people like about any system is all-round reliability... not:
&gt; 'at least you get some type of workable system' (SA excepted?)
&gt; 

Some people would prefer to have some type of workable system rather
than no system at all. I am one of them. Perhaps I'm not one of the
market share. The system has worked reliably for me for a number of
months, then fell over.

I posted one question on this list and received enough information to
figure out what I had done wrong. Perhaps this is in itself a selling
point? Now I have a fully working system.

&gt; If MS decides to deliver that, we better be ready to match it.
&gt; 

They already provide 'some kind of workable system' albeit slow,
inefficient and crap. Until Linux is as easy to kickstart install as
Windows 95/98 it will never have the market share, no matter how
reliable, fast or technically fant
astic it is.
