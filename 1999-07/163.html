&gt; Greetings.
&gt; 
&gt; I have done a couple of S.u.S.E. installs (ver5.1) and found the installation easy and  - typically German - efficient.
&gt; 
&gt; The a1 package only isn't a lot of use if you want a practical installation though.
&gt; 
&gt; S.u.S.E. comes with a first class installation program called "Yast". As you walk through the installation with the grafical interface you first select the usual colour/monochrome display, US keyboard etc then the partitioning of the drive (a root "/" partition (say min. 480Mb preferably over 750Mb plus a swap partition equalling your RAM - up to 64Mb is fine to start. Yast then goes to installation of packages. Here you experiment (if you wreck it just start the install again and select "format partition" when asked) you have a choice to 'configure installation/packages' A list of istall types is evident for selection ie minimum, typical, no X system (console only), typical S.u.S.E. install, and many others.
&gt; 
&gt; Once you select the closest install to your requirements you are then permitted to select individual EXTRA components. Note KDE, Netscape will need to be, and perhaps your video server MAY need to be select here.
&gt; 
&gt; Just the follow the instructions as presented. There is a fantastic book in the package - "Installation, Configuration and First steps" (440 or so pages). This is a great reference work for all newcomers to linux (and others)and covers virtually all there is need to know for a 'normal' installation plus configuration followed by utilities etc. and much more concise than FAQs and HOWTOs. The chapters are logically laid out and you only need the first ones to start and install.
&gt; 
&gt; If downloading from the net I suggest you load the book first (using acrobat reader) and plan what you will need. I strongly advise buying a CD however!
&gt; 
&gt; I found the S.u.S.E. system first class as are Redhat 6 and, Mandrake 6 if you have a greater computer than a 486! Note if you go S.u.S.E. suggest 6.1 as version 6.0 came out just prior to the release of the new kernel.
&gt; 
&gt; Enjoy!!
