&gt; Good question... since the list is maintained,
&gt; albeit automatically, by a local Linux reseller,
&gt; it becomes - like a customer or prospect list -
&gt; a bit guarded... at least, I have not seen any
&gt; way to access the list of members... so far.
&gt; 

As a long term subscriber to this list, I must object to both the tone
and the content of this message. The maintainers of this list do not
publish my contact details, and those of the other subscribers, because
it would be very unwise and impolite to do so. It would most probably be
seen as a betrayal of trust if they let you, or anyone else, access the
list. You say you have not seen any way to access the list 'so far'. Are
you indeed trying to? Why??? My details are not yours to snaffle, pal,
hands off!!!


&gt; Presumably, our wondering about it will open
&gt; the door to negotiations on opening the mem-
&gt; ber (i.e. e-mail adr) list...  ;)

When you say 'our wondering' who is this 'us'??? Do you speak for anyone
else? Who do you represent, and why do you want the contact details of
the subscribers to this list?

&gt; &gt;&gt; 4:  The LinuxSA list, or (South) Australians in general have a good
&gt; &gt;&gt; international Linux reputation, and people gravitate to LinuxSA to
&gt; &gt;&gt; absorb the guruness.
&gt; 
&gt; Marketing...  ;)

Oh please, if you are so sure this list is a cynical grab for market
share by a commercial group, would you please just go away and leave the
rest of us to be exploited. Please. Soon!

&gt; &gt;I don't thing local groups need any kind of special support. I think
&gt; &gt;that (for me) things are very good the way they are, as long as linuxSA
&gt; &gt;is willing to receive my questions and opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; I sort of agree... like newsgroups, one should be free to come & go
&gt; as one will...
&gt; 

Come and go. There is a 'go' in there. Try it, you'll be lots less
disappointed in the world by not being exploited by this group. Trust me
on this one.

To the rest of the group, try to forgive my shortness of temper. Enough
volunteer-bashing is enough in my view, and I for one have had quite
enough. Those of us who have been around even a little while know who
maintain this list and how and why. It's not compulsory to join. (though
I wonder about compulsory un-joining at times;))
