OK, this thread has now moved away from it's original subject, but I
wasn't going to change the subject cause it seems to break the
threading on the web mail archives. Did I do good or did I do bad?
*gulp*

&gt; &gt; It doesn't have to help the Linux Community to be interesting. If
&gt; &gt; you don't like the thread, then hit delete and move on.  Please
&gt; &gt; don't ask people to modify their conversation because it doesn't
&gt; &gt; fit in with your idea of what the list should be. The list is what
&gt; &gt; it's members make it, both you and everyone else.
&gt; 
&gt; But this is list is called "LinuxSA" - isn't it designed for
&gt; discussion of linux-related issues?  If somebody thinks it's not
&gt; linux-related - then what's wrong with them mentioning it?

(I knew someone would say this, and as you can guess, I'm ready...)

Nothing at all, that wasn't my point. :o)  I didn't object to the
opinion expressed, I objected to the request to be silent.

Different

&gt; Your statement - "please don't ask people to modify their
&gt; conversation" etc..  aren't you asking someone to modify their
&gt; conversation by doing that??  Like you said yourself, the list is
&gt; what it's members make it.  Seems a bit contradictory to me.

No, I simply expressed my _opinion_ They can express theirs as well.
But there is a difference between "I think this is irrelevant" and "I
think this is irrelevant so you should stop it." I don't expect people
to start flaming and not having "on topic" discussions, just because I
like that. If I thought that, I wouldn't be having this disscussion

Put very simply, the original post was "is this relevant", and my reply
was "yes it is", I don't disagree with what you are saying, I'm just
saying that you missed the point. 

I wasn't asking him to modify his conversation at all. He is more than
welcome to express his opinions, but so am I. As you will note, I
said...

"personally I prefer"

I never asked him to stop posting such requests, I simply explained
that the subject matter on the mailing list is not moderated by him.

Therein lies the difference! Shame on you for assuming I didn't expect
a reply like yours to be forthcomming! :o) (I didn't expect if from
from you though!) :o)

If the person in question doesn't like my threads, then he should move
on, not expect me to stop talking about it. I also said that the list
is what we make it because you will notice that a new thread has
formed, and he started it! You are continuing it. Everything seems to
be working fine! That is my point in a nutshell (tm).

&gt; "it doesn't have to help the Linux Community to be intersting." -
&gt; hmmm...  but again I say - this is the LinuxSA mailing list..  a
&gt; flamewar such as the one we're all currently grin-and-bearing could
&gt; possibly be taken off-list..  and perhaps made a little less rude?

You make the same mistake that I keep trying to explain. I have posted
on this topic on more than a few occasions. The mailing list is not
limited to technical matters. It is not limited to experienced users.
It is not limited to newbies. It is not limited to linux politix and
advocacy. It is all these things, plus whatever anyone posts on
tomorrow. This includes discussions about the Commodore and using the
Internet in a library. It is neither your place, mine or anyone elses
to dictate whether or not this is relevant.

(BTW My definition of a flame would probably differ from yours as
well. For example, I think that lately Paul Russell has been very
restrained! :o)  note: opinion)

I'll actually write some assumptions down now so that a reply is not
generated by anyone because they thought that "he didn't think of..."

ASSUMPTION: "Discussions about basket weaving may not fall into the
realm of my premis."

Obviously posts have to have some tiny hint of relevance, but never
assume that you understand where those boundaries are better than
someone else. (I'm not saying you did, I'm just waving my hands about
a bit)

&gt; &gt; And learn you will. Linux isn't all ones and zeros, and neither is
&gt; &gt; this list.
&gt; 
&gt; Linux -is- all ones and zeros.  And we're mostly water.

Lol, I didnt' think you'd take the double Nick! Linux is -*NOT*- all
ones and zeros, because Linux is waaaaaaaaay more than just an
operating system.

tsk tsk

&gt; &gt; Advocay and the Linux community are all part of the big picture.
&gt; 
&gt; That's too profound for me to argue with..

You just did! In your previous paragraph!

&gt; &gt; (Hmm... Maybe "black and white" would be better than "ones and zeros",
&gt; &gt; cause no doubt someone will mention that an email *is* ones and zeros.
&gt; &gt; Alternatively, you'll just know what I mean.)
&gt; 
&gt; huh?

This was the assumption I decided to voice just in case someone
misinterpreted what I meant and said that "Linux _is_ all ones and
zeros", therefore missing my point. I can be a bit obscure at times.

But surely it's not that obscure, is it?

Is it?

It is?

Shit!
