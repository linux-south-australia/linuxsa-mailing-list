Sorry?  Obtained from *WHERE*?

According to comments made by police investigators on NSW radio 
earlier today, there is no credible evidence that the Internet
had anything to do with it.  It's a lead they're pursuing, but
not a particularly high investigative priority.

 &gt; Whilst I have nothing but sympathy for the victims & their
 &gt; families, I cannot believe that the INTERNET is being blamed for
 &gt; this tragedy!! Heard some anti-internet comments already
 &gt; from some pollies abt it!!

Yes! And some ISPs! :-)

It's another media beat-up.  You just watch:  Every story about
rape, child abuse, explosives, racism, and sex for the next six 
months will feature the Internet, even if there's absolutely no
link whatsoever between the topic under discussion and the 'net[*].
