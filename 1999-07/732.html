&gt;Two quick questions:
&gt;
&gt;1. Is there many, if any, opportunities to work in a linux environment in
&gt;Adelaide, regardless of experience?


Sure, just volounteer your time at a place that uses Linux, e.g. an ISP,
school, consulting firm, etc. (be prepared to sign a "non-disclosure
agreements" on any client data that you may come into contact with
while you're at the work-place.)

And - as you're time is given so freely - I'm sure there will be lotsa
takers for your invitation... just make sure that you don't come to be
legally responsible for any errors (so, maybe it would be better to
be a very low cost employee... junior rates, if you're young may be
on offer if your employer is above using cheap labor).

Thinking along these lines might translate into a new

   "Linux Traineeship"

i.e. with some support from State Gov't.  Go campaign
with the Accreditation & Registration Council (if they're
not the one's to set-up one, they should know who is...)

Of course, if there weren't the struggle between the (now
two) ISP umbrella organisations (i.e. one for the biggies
and one for the smaller ISPs to join) consuming their
energies, I'm sure that one of these guys could be pur-
suaded to at least listen to the suggestion for such a
traineeship, if not help to fund one...

Of course, defense, gov't and industry alike are the
potential winners from a new heap of Linux/UNIX-
talent appearing in the local labor-market... so they,
too, ought to be given their chance to fund some
places.

Somebody like Richard Sharpe might be able to
come up with a syllabus and topic list for actual
training objectives for a price (after all, he's ap-
parently teaching a course that seems to cover
all the bases).

Surely, Linux SA-ers who "cheered" - at MadDog's
presentation - when the topic of Linux Certification
was discussed will come to the party with an on-
line test-administrator (or, if that's not politically
correct in light of professional test-agencies' get-
ting into the business before them, then a test-
preparation system that would aid the Trainee
who aimed to get Linux Certified by one of them).

&gt;2. Is there a definite preference for a particular major linux distribution
&gt;amongst users? Are they all pretty much the same?


As it happens, work is - as I write - being done (elsewhere, I believe)
to develop topics (for exams and/or courses) that are distribution-
specific.

Sample questions/topics are on-line and set to grow in number.

Go have a look if you're interested.

Surely there are substantial comparisons of distributions to be
found in more competitive places in the world (I haven't seen
InfoWorld in a while, but the US version used to be very good
at lining up competing products (e.g. word processor, et al.)
for tabular comparisons.  I would extrapolate from that that
they (or similar publications) might have compared the vari-
ous flavours of Linux (just as Mark Newton has just compared
FreeBSD to Linux).

Maybe there oughta be a web site for that kind of comparison
(and/or pointers to it).  If NetCraft weren't RedHat enriched,
I'd expect they'd have put such comparisons on their web site.

&gt;I currently use Redhat 5.2 and was thinking of trying something like
Caldera
&gt;OL 2.2, Debian or just grabbing Mandrake. Yes, I have read the HOW TO, and
&gt;searched the web, but there doesn't seem to be a definitive comparison,
just
&gt;gibberish about where each dist. evolved or is evolving from.


Each non-independent "box-pushers" - as I've heard them called -
(e.g. Harvey Norman, NetCraft, and lots more interstate) seem to
have settled on *one* or *maybe* two flavours.

When e-commerce mail-order houses come into their own in
the Australian Linux marketplace, you'll be able to find all at one
place (hopefully, with comparisons).

At the moment, each small reseller wins when the info you've
asked for *isn't* around (so do all the transport companies,
if you order one or two products from each reseller around,
rather than getting one-of-everything (if you want to make your
own comparisons) -or- the ONE you decide - from *lotsa*
comparitive info - is right for you (and stick with it for a while).

So, I guess small one- or two-distribution resellers don't have
anything to gain by providing the comparison info you need.

&gt;The easy way out is more me to obtain a copy of each,

The box-pushers are pleased whenever a person in your
position draws a similar conclusion... as are the transporters.

&gt; but I realy don't want the hassle of installing and re-installing
&gt; different dist. just to find a flavour I like.

Then find a comparison that you trust (for the moment) and
back the Linux flavor you think is going to be a winner for you.

It's not different than picking a suburb in which to live, really,
or a wife or a car... when you've made enough choices,
it gets easy (assuming you've made good ones... ;)
