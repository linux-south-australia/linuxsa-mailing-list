Hi Jim

...snip
&gt; 
&gt; It actually may be quite suitable for the job ...
&gt;

Yes, it might. But: its a sledge hammer for the task you describe, it gives you
the problems you are asking about, is complex to setup/administer, may suck the
life out of your unix box if more than a handfull of users, use it at the same
time.

VNC is good. We use VNC - mainly for accessing windows boxes from linux & other
windows boxes. We don't use it much for accessing UNIX apps because:
1. X11 works far faster (except over serial lines)
2. absolutely no configuration of the application server is required
   (other than to install the X application itself!) 
3. When accessing the application the fact it is on another host
   can be made transparent.
4. Windows users don't usually want a window with a whole unix desktop on it.
   They want an application window to pop up, on top of their windows desktop
   just like it was any old Windows application. (VNC puts up a whole UNIX
   desktop inside a windows window).
5. Many of our UNIX/Linux systems don't even have XFree86 installed and even
   where they do loading down the server running Xserver(s) is undesirable
   (they are resource intensive beasties)

On the other hand VNC:
1. is available totally free for windows
2. the same client can control UNIX & Win boxes

...snip
&gt; However VNC aside the problem is that I cannot run more than one X
&gt; server on the box so a remote X server like eXceed couldn't be used
&gt; either.

This isn't how remotely accessing an X11 app works.
This misconception is at the core of your problem 
1. You don't need any X Servers on "the box"
2. You can literally run hundreds of X programs displaying on hundreds of
   different XServers from a unix box that doesn't have a single copy of XFree86
   or any other Xserver on it. The only XServer required is the one on the box
   the Monitor is attached to. In your intended case the Xserver is on the
   windows box.

If you can already run the application on the UNIX/Linux box,
you have done all you need to on it.

All you need to do now is download/order a evaluation copy of a good XServer
for windows from the net and install it on the Windows box(es). It should come
with instructions, on how to configure it. It will have a security system,
which you will need to tell to allow connections from the application server.

There are many ways to launch the application on the UNIX box. The windows
software most likely will have tools for the purpose. In the first instance
though its often easiest to launch it manually. To do this:
1. telnet into the application server
2. set the DISPLAY variable
   DISPLAY=my.windows.box.com:0.0
   (substitute the IP or name of your windows box, the ":0.0" is required)
3. start the application (try "xeyes")

&gt; If I can fix this basic problem I can then sort out the VNC vs eXceed
&gt; questions you raise.

Hopefully we've side stepped the multiple XServer requirement. It's only a
requirement with VNC.

If you're after a production solution, an X11 server for windows
is the ideal tool for the job. 

If however you have no capacity to purchase or you'd just like to use VNC go
for it. 

Regards
Adrian
