Maybe this is a question that's on everyone's minds, or maybe it's just
something I've missed the answer to...

So, is C4IS the same as ARA, SBS EXPT, and possibly more people?
The organisers say so, but C4IS says that his account is shared
apparently...So does each person go by a different handle, and ARA and
SBS just haven't said anything for ages? Or do they all post under the
same name, and for some reason keep changing that name?

The next question I'm just curious about - Chuck, why do you insist on
using these things as your name? Lots of people on here use their full
names, and haven't yet complained of any abuse of their openness.. And
even if you were worried, you could have safely called yourself Chuck W.
or at least signed your initials or something... And even if you've got
a good reason for that, why do you apparently change your strange
nicknames occaisionally without letting anyone know?

Everyone's entitled to do what they like, as long as it doesn't infringe
upon other people's rights. However, doing things that aren't enforced,
but are however 'good', is etiquette.

Once, people on the internet by and large had a concept of 'netiquette'
that they followed. Sure, not everyone by any means, but I feel that as
the numbers of people using the internet go up, the average attitudes of
people seem to be on the decline. Spam seems to be on an all-time high,
and is rising still, for instance, not just commercials, but the
'forward this message to all your friends' type. You'd be surprised how
many newbies really believe things they read in email... ;)
Now, if the internet became populated with an average balance of people
from society, you'd think that on average you'd find good decent people.
Except that on the internet, one person has a lot more power than they
do in real life. One email can reach into thousands, nay millions, of
homes.

For example, if someone who harrasses your telephone is identified, you
can block the number from calling you. (Or notify the police.) On the
internet, someone can just change their email address and keep at it. 

Now, the internet is in a state of flux at the moment...things are
constantly changing, nothing is settled. But where do you think it will
end up when it finally settles down, sometime in the future? 

Will people ever get over the novelty of abusing the powers they gain
from the internet eventually? Safeguards against actual malicious
activity will evolve, I'm sure of this. However, what about people who
just seem to enjoy pretending to be someone they're not?
The internet is still growing and changing, and whatever systems can
evolve the fastest will end up successful eventually. And Linux seems to
be the best at rapid evolvement.
Will Linux become more than just an operating system and a way of doing
unix-like stuff? Will Linux and it's prominent figures become idols or
rolemodels for people? Will Linux, in other words, become a way of life?
