&gt; 
&gt; &gt;I'd wonder if there are any laws against importing large amounts of
&gt; &gt;stuff..Both from the tax aspect, and the parrellel importation aspect.
&gt; 
&gt; I there are, then I'd say:  c.f. Thoreau's Civil Disobedience   ;)
Sorry, you'll have to fill me in on that one...?

&gt; 
&gt; How any such law(s) - if they exist - apply to GPL'd software?
It might be free, but you'll probably still have to pay 10% of $0 tax on
it under a GST ;)
And wouldn't the 10% apply to service as well? So, if you downloaded 600
Mb of a linux distribution, and that cost $25 to download, then maybe
they'd try and charge you 10% on top of that, in addition to the 10% on
$0. But anyway, I'm neither a politician, or a lawyer, or even a good
mathematician.

&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I think there are far greater crimes in the world to be
&gt; concerned about than "pooling a consumer/user group's re-
&gt; sources to buy for less"
hehehe. Since when has the govt. cared about greater or lesser crimes,
when it comes to taxation?
I'm sure there are relevant examples, perhaps speed cameras and their
distribution?
An irrelevant example would be that Al Capone was convicted for income
tax evasion, rather than for murder, or racketeering, etc.
But I know that was more cos it was the only charge they could press I
think?

&gt; 
&gt; After all, it's not stealing... assuming any/all duties/taxes, etc.
&gt; were paid on the goods in question.
Well, as I said, I'm not a lawyer... But I'll bet that the Retail
Association Union (or some other pressure/lobby group) has bribed enuf
MPs to get a law passed that stops us mass importing, regardless of
duties.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It says: Save 40% (off the US price of $30)
&gt; &gt;&gt; on CD-ROMs, i.e.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; by ordering 20 together...
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; I like that way of thinking (it encourages
&gt; &gt;&gt; User Groups use to their collective
&gt; &gt;&gt; buying power)!  Have a look:

&gt; &gt;&gt; Are there any Linux counterparts to this?
