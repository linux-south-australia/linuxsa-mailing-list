Robert,

My comments are meant to be very general, I just happened to get fed up with
the 'negative' responses and opinions that appear to be flying around the
mailing list. Yours happened to be the recipient of my ire, but then again,
you were suitable as you claim reslience.

Similarly, I have no real history about Lia as I have only been on this
mailing list a very short time. I agree that his question was unresearched
and generally vague.

His probably wasn't the best example of a query to use.

I apologise if I have bothered you in any manner.

I am certainly not attempting to take you task for giving your opinion, but
what I cannot understand, and please help me here; is why the tendency in
the mailing list group to provide this type of response. No response would
have sufficed, especially for a blanket type request.

It seems to me that people here actually enjoy bagging each other.

I know that I certainly try my best to search all avenues of information
open to me before I submit questions to a mailing list, and I most certainly
agree with your comments about studying, researching and reading doco's
samples, other peoples opinions, solutions etc..

If everyone adopted this attitude then we would be getting the best out of
the mailing list.

My comments re Linux are very general, and please do not take Lia's query as
the stereotype. If people who are genuinely trying to find answers get
flamed when entering the linux neck of the woods, what is the probability
that they will persist in that line of endevour? Much less then when they
started I would say.

What happens then; They find solutions that doesn't give them that
response - generally from other sources. Hence my comment about Netware and
NT. These being the likely OS candidates if they do not choose a unix based
answer.

The newbie I helped, that I mentioned in my previous e-mail is a case in
point.

Her questions were reasonably vague, but specific enough for me to give a
response - basically she was having problems getting Samba to run. (I know
it took me 6 hours the first time - and then all it turned out to be was a
mis-behaving Win 98 Browser). I simply gave her some very basic instructions
to get it at least running with no frills, a quickly edited smb.conf file
with highlighted sections of the critical sections and that was it. She had
read the doc's and the small nudge was sufficient. I doubt if I spent more
than 5 mins in a response and most of that was in an ftp to a linux box. She
still had to do all the real work and find out and set her actual network
settings in place. She already had her NIC, TCP/IP etc running fine.

This person happens to be in South America, and was resorting to mailing
lists as she had not completely understood the correct settings to set.
There are enough of them.

What I find perplexing is that she got 59 non-helpful emails in return and
only one semi suitable one. Surely 59 other people could have left their
keyboards shut. This is what I am ranting about!

As to Jamz, I see him often enough anyway and I guess I'll hear from him.

Your response in no way will detract from my use and/or enjoyment of the
mailing list, and I hope we can provide useful assistance to each other in
the future.

Regards

Tarek

As I said it was not exactly a bashing. Again apology to Lia for seeming to
pick on you.

Irrespective of what they wanted the information for, I personally do not
really care where they are coming from, that is their business, their
reasoning for doing this is also their business.

The point I was trying to make, is re-read the emails from Lia and you will
find they all basically ask the same questions and almost tell you "I have
not read anything, just tell me how to do everything".

I am also not here to tell someone how to use the Net. I presume that the
person asking the question should have a basic understanding of the concepts
or Search Engines and their ilk.

1) If you have a problem installing Linux, maybe go to www.yahoo.com and
type +installing +linux and see what this returns. Read this information. If
you don't understand it, contact the author or LinuxSA mailing list or
search on that.
2) No 1) implies RESEARCH, anyone can ask, How do I do this oh expert and
give me every detail, what is the point, the expert is not going to really
gain anything here and neither is the asker of the question.
3) No-one on this list is being payed to do your RESEARCH for you. If it is
quite plain that you have not done any research and you just want the exact
answers, then expect to get told to read something.
4) Do not expect to be given the exact URI for any document, whilst most
time you may get the right one, try finding the info yourself. Again I point
you to the search engines.
5) If you are told what to read, read it!
6) Ask a specific question. This has been mentioned in previous mails,
whether you have seen it or not I don't know, nobody was ashamed then.

If you are an ashamed Linux user, why. I did apologise at the start of the
email to Lia and all I said was hopefully logical and not defamatory, I
didn't call anyone insulting names or decry anyones intelligence.

As regards your comment " Demeaning and content-free email responses =&gt;
Netware or NT up one, Linux down one.", how did you come up with that one ?
Is this a new mathematical thereom ?

I did not demean anyone, I pointed out some blindingly obvious facts,
content-free email, I am sure I typed something in it, if it was blank why
bother to reply at all ?

BTW, I totally agree that we should foster all newbies (or as I say
non-gurus) and give them as much help as possible, but please let's not take
them by the hand, close their eyes and feed them everything, cause sure as
hell, some garbage will end up in their mouths and they will never know.

"We like to promote unix based solutions here. By emails such as yours you
are doing just the opposite." Huh ?? When did I suggest non Unix based
solutions ? I only mentioned Windows twice (in the same sentence I might
add) and in no way framed them in a nice light and suggested that people
should use their products.

There is a lot of garbage thrown around, usually without expletives, true,
check out any public medium that doesn't ? Ego is everywhere, are you
suggesting that we attempt to subdue ego on this list ?

I also try to help "newbies" as well, don't we all ? Please do get off your
moral high horse and notice that we all try to help "newbies", the moral
high horse is from the sympathy line "I remember the dim dark ages when I
knew Jack (and probably still do!).". We ALL are newbies in some part of
Linux, it is way to big for anyone to know it all. This is why this mailing
list and others like it exist.

It is not here to pander to blanket requests, it is here to answer help
request where it seems the person is really stuck and has tried to get
unstuck and failed for any number of reasons.

But seeing as you actually disagreed with Jamz, the above message seems
irrelevant, I am big enough and ugly enough. Please in future if you
disagree with an email, reply to the email you disagree with.

Thank you for your comment, and I hope this doesn't detrack from your
enjoyment of this list. We will all continue to help non-gurus from now to
eternity, cool. One thing I know, as a student you learn, as a teacher you
learn more.

Remeber you replied.

Rob.

&gt;I disagree,
&gt;
&gt;it is much much quicker, more polite and sociable to just say look at
&gt;www.*** or look in the HOWTO-XXX than to give some-one a mail-bashing.
&gt;
&gt;Apart form pooling our expertise and knowledge the mailing list can provide
&gt;a valuable resource to newbies, many who may be coming from MS environments
&gt;and are missing many of the basic unix commands and file structure
&gt;conventions we all take for granted.
&gt;
&gt;We like to promote unix based solutions here. By emails such as yours you
&gt;are doing just the opposite.
&gt;
&gt;I have only been on this mailing list a very short time, and whilst the
&gt;topics are varied and interesting the real disappointing thing is all the
&gt;shit that is flung. It really does not portray us as unix users as a
&gt;supportive and professional mob.
&gt;
&gt;We all would like to see linux dominate the OS market, but this is
&gt;definitely not the way to start on this path.
&gt;
&gt;I always try and help newbies, I remember the dim dark ages when I knew
Jack
&gt;(and probably still do!).
&gt;
&gt;Like the last one I helped; turned out they got 59 flames to the mail post
&gt;and one useful response (mine). Turns out that she is looking at Linux as
an
&gt;alternative to Netware in her organisation. Demeaning and content-free
email
&gt;responses =&gt; Netware or NT up one, Linux down one.
&gt;
&gt;The trend is here fellows; Keep up the good work, and god only knows how
&gt;many people we can scare away from linux, no matter how good it is.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Regards
&gt;
&gt;Tarek
&gt;(An ashamed linux user)

&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Minimum Suse System
&gt;&gt; Importance: Low
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Lai, Apology from the start, this may sound like a verbal bashing.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Sorry to sound like a pain, but the questions you are asking
&gt;&gt; are answered in
&gt;&gt; a lot of places on the net. You are basically asking the same
&gt;&gt; questions 'How
&gt;&gt; do I do a minimal install of RedHat, How do I do a minimal
&gt;&gt; install of Suse,
&gt;&gt; how do I install Debian'.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Okay, most distributions have some kind of "Here's howto
&gt;&gt; install this", even
&gt;&gt; Windows does, most distro give you massive amounts more than
&gt;&gt; windows on how
&gt;&gt; to install.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; You give no indication of having read any documentation to
&gt;&gt; get some ideas
&gt;&gt; like, I tried to install Suse, but thing G broke I tried the
&gt;&gt; doco, it said I
&gt;&gt; should upgrade to library libwhatsit version 99 and then do
&gt;&gt; something else,
&gt;&gt; I can't understand what the something else is, could somebody
&gt;&gt; please give me
&gt;&gt; a hand.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It is important to at least attempt to do something first,
&gt;&gt; read all you can
&gt;&gt; understand (I will not say everything is perfectly
&gt;&gt; understandable on the
&gt;&gt; first read or even thirtieth read), but you must attempt.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If you don't wish to attempt, send somebody your computer, a couple of
&gt;&gt; hundred dollars, your cd's, etc, to someone and they will
&gt;&gt; install it for
&gt;&gt; you. You didn't have to read any documentation and the system
&gt;&gt; got built for
&gt;&gt; you.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I suspect this is not your goal (given the fact that you at
&gt;&gt; least asked a
&gt;&gt; question, all encompassing as it may be), so read, read some more and
&gt;&gt; continue reading.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I have never installed Suse or Debian so I can not say how
&gt;&gt; easy/hard they
&gt;&gt; are to install, or what would constitue a minial install, but
&gt;&gt; I would read a
&gt;&gt; few bits of doco and document the error messages on failure
&gt;&gt; so I have some
&gt;&gt; questions with hard facts to show.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;/flame&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Rob.
