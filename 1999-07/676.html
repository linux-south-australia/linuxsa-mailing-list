Hi.

Not wishing to fuel another heated debate, but there are people out
there C41S, who cannot afford to buy that neat 32bit cash converters
PC. (No, I'm not one of them)

This is not an ideal world. In percentage terms, less than 1% of the
worlds population has a home computer yet. If someone wants to run a
C64 for the net, or a Z80 or TRS-80, let them go for it. All power to
them. I'd rather some of them get connected to the information via
outdated technology than not at all. If C64 access is limiting, exactly
how limiting is no access? Unfair? would these types rather be in an
'Internet underclass' (a bit harsh) or a 'no-internet underclass'?

Don't forget that the power is in the information, not the gee-wiz
graphics. Lynx is cool for cutting to the chase and forgetting about
the eye candy. I'll bet you could use lynx from a C64. Gaelyne?

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; around Christmas time,
&gt;&gt; C4IS was ridiculing us for supporting C= users
&gt;&gt; with our Linux system
&gt; 
&gt; C4IS simply pointed out that it is *unfair* to
&gt; help people have the limited level of Internet-
&gt; access that a Commodore 64 provides IMHO.
&gt; 
&gt; For the record, there was no problem with
&gt; your use of a Linux, & it is unfortunate that
&gt; that you would mention Linux by way of jus-
&gt; tifying another apparently commercial
&gt; post on Linux SA (if you want to be com-
&gt; mercial, just prefix the title with COMMERCIAL,
&gt; per GDB's recent instruction... not that I've
&gt; seen all posts from GDB and/or NetCraft
&gt; that have commercial content applying that
&gt; rule consistently, but I digress...  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; It is bad enough that there are people
&gt; who have never had a well-rounded
&gt; "look at & surf of" the Internet are being
&gt; "spoon-fed" anti-technology propaganda
&gt; by local media (c.f. an article quoting
&gt; Amanda Vanstone that seemed to
&gt; blend the concept of Hacker into
&gt; Computer Criminal, before quoting
&gt; a Brisbane police officer on the
&gt; dangers of electronic organisers -
&gt; Advertiser 15 Jun 99 p. 26 "Minister
&gt; warms of hacker dangers")...
&gt; 
&gt; but when I'net users - who:
&gt; 
&gt;  - enjoy full 'net access (e.g. using Linux, et al.)
&gt;  - know how much there is to be learned from
&gt;    the Internet
&gt; 
&gt; continue to support (if not promote) the kind
&gt; of "limiting" technologies (here, I include any
&gt; C64-only 'net access configurations)...
&gt; 
&gt; I think they are helping to create a
&gt; similarly "Internet underclass"...
&gt; 
&gt; This is even more true today, when
&gt; e.g. a '486 with 20+ Mb of RAM and
&gt; enough Hard Drive for a 32-bit op sys
&gt; and browser, as well as multi-media
&gt; features can be seen for under $300
&gt; (one of Cash Converters' overpriced
&gt; systems, IMHO).
&gt; 
&gt; I say:
&gt; 
&gt; rather than spending human time
&gt; "helping" people learn how to use
&gt; 8-bit technologies for e-mail, etc.
&gt; why not help them use 32-bit boxes
&gt; that - these days - cost about the
&gt; same and Linux, that this list is
&gt; about?
&gt; 
&gt; Go figure...  ;)
&gt; 
&gt; Wasn't Mathew Tippett going to
&gt; address a group of your users?
&gt; 
&gt; If so, perhaps Matt can tell us how
&gt; usable, for Internet access, the
&gt; Commodor 64 that would have
&gt; been shown to him on the night...  ;)
