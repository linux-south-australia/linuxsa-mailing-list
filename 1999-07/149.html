Lai, Apology from the start, this may sound like a verbal bashing.

Sorry to sound like a pain, but the questions you are asking are answered in
a lot of places on the net. You are basically asking the same questions 'How
do I do a minimal install of RedHat, How do I do a minimal install of Suse,
how do I install Debian'.

Okay, most distributions have some kind of "Here's howto install this", even
Windows does, most distro give you massive amounts more than windows on how
to install.

You give no indication of having read any documentation to get some ideas
like, I tried to install Suse, but thing G broke I tried the doco, it said I
should upgrade to library libwhatsit version 99 and then do something else,
I can't understand what the something else is, could somebody please give me
a hand.

It is important to at least attempt to do something first, read all you can
understand (I will not say everything is perfectly understandable on the
first read or even thirtieth read), but you must attempt.

If you don't wish to attempt, send somebody your computer, a couple of
hundred dollars, your cd's, etc, to someone and they will install it for
you. You didn't have to read any documentation and the system got built for
you.

I suspect this is not your goal (given the fact that you at least asked a
question, all encompassing as it may be), so read, read some more and
continue reading.

I have never installed Suse or Debian so I can not say how easy/hard they
are to install, or what would constitue a minial install, but I would read a
few bits of doco and document the error messages on failure so I have some
questions with hard facts to show.

&lt;/flame&gt;

Rob.

P.S. If anyone wants to flame as picking on a newbie &lt;read non-guru&gt; go for
it. I am big enough and ugly enough (you will have to trust me on this
point) to handle it. 8-) I go in with my eyes open!!!!
