Linux hardware experts and others:

For a while I've been planning to build a 
really nice computer for myself, to run linux,
and to be my main work computer for the next 3 years.
So it has to be good. I've been planning this for about
11 months.

Problem:
I can't quite work out how the real experts, the in-crowd,
make up computers. There seem to be these options:

1.	"Mums and dads" store 
	I.e. Try to get the "main street" computer
	store to understand what I'm looking for in a
	"linux computer".

2.	Buy the parts from mail order magazines,
	and put it together "au hazard", as the
	French say.

3.	Buy the parts from local stored, and proceed
	as in (2).

4.	Find some fanatic who wakes up thinking about
	linux hardware compatibility tables first
	thing every morning and knows what voltage
	is on every wire in the whole computer.

5.	Find some store that employs person in (4), and
	get them to build it.

If I wanted MS wind98 or whatever, I'd go to the
local store. But in the past, this has yielded
computers with bits that don't work with linux 
(ethernet card, video card...)

Could anyone (preferably not on the list) send me
a brief idea of what is the best way to proceed?

Absolutely best for me would be to discover
that there's a store in town with all of the components
that I can just buy and put together, with some helpful
advice from an expert store owner.

But I can't even work out how I would buy a 
yeong yang case. Obviously it would be big cost and
effort to import something from Taiwan or the US.

Cheers,
Alan Kennington.
