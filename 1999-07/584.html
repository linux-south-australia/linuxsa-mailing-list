If Mark's presentation-style was a well-organised
and crisp as the slides indicate, I - for one -
would like to encourage him to:

  Organise a Political Party to put the points
  (e.g. on a censorship-free Internet, etc.)
  needed to represent the interests of our
  various Australian technical communities

After all, if a fish & chip shop owner can do it, &

a "single-issue" guy like Nick Xenophon too,

then, surely, a well-connected, high-tech guy like
Newt' can do better than at least one of these.

(I understand that Newt' has also been doing
some singing over the years... and that would
certainly put his voice in good stead for the job
of orating - both to win votes -and- to pursade,
e.g. other legislators)

I really think it's time to get more of the message
across, and in the mainstream (incl'g political
arena and media) world(s)...

* Vote Newt' *

This is NOT satire... I genuinely feel we need a
voice and - even if I don't always agree with all
that the guy has (in past) said/written or that he
may likely say (in future)... is there any better?

And - in light of the censorship bill - is there any
better time?

NOT to try is to say "You do it" and - moreover
- to give more power to the Paulene Hansons,
et al. of this world...

'don't want to start a new one, fine... so, come
out fighting as a candidate of a party of your
choice, Mark.  ;)

What'cha say to that?

- - - - - - - -

Anyway... the pres'n seems to have been
of a higher quality than I've seen for a while
even at a Linux SA meeting...

Here's a guy that knows more than how
to "dress for success" IMHO...  ;)
