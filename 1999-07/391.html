&gt;&gt; I'd like to learn about QOS, and the vaguely related traffic shaping,
&gt;&gt; but I've never got around to it yet. If you find some up to date info,
&gt;&gt; can you pass it along to me too?
&gt;
&gt;	QOS (Quality of Service) or TOS (Type of Service) is pretty

Hmmm, while I know very little about QoS, it is different to ToS and seems
to be intended to allow protocols like H323 to guarantee bandwidth for
communicating parties.  ATM seems hot on QoS.  

ToS on the other hand, as stated below is a mechanism to allow routers to
handle packets differently based on the type of data being carried, low
delay, high throughput, high reliability, etc.

&gt;	much restricted to the IP level... AFAIK, the primary role
&gt;	behind TOS in IP packets is to ensure that intermediate
&gt;	routers channel them faster (does anyone other than cisco 
&gt;	actually do this, though?).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;	While you can easily set the TOS on outgoing traffic (modify 
&gt;	the source code to ssh, irc, whatever, to call setsockopt(IP_TOS)
&gt;	on the socketi), using the TOS to filter incoming data could be 
&gt;	'interesting'.
&gt;
&gt;	The IP headers are stripped, but the TOS information is still 
&gt;	passed to the TCP level. But since all the TCP packets to a particular
&gt;	port are being queued on the same queue (same port, y'see), then
&gt;	the only real way to get a performance boost would be to
&gt;	give the server handling that particular TCP port a bigger share of
&gt;	the CPU time (?)
&gt;	If traffic of different precedences (precedents?) were all put on 
&gt;	the port/queue, TOS would make more sense (given all the packets
&gt;	have the same TOS (by merit of their destination port), then
&gt;	there's no point sorting packets on the receive queue of a TCP 
&gt;	port, because they're all effectively equal (Does this make any 
&gt;	sense?)).
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Oh, and irc and icq as high priority too ;)
&gt;
&gt;	Pray that your irc/icq traffic never passes thru one of *MY* 
&gt;	routers then. &gt;:)
&gt;
&gt;J.
