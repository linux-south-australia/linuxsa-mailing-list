 &gt; &gt; I heard from a friend the other day who works at a major Telco
 &gt; &gt; company that timed local calls are back on the agenda, surely this would

 &gt; &gt; could gain the Monopoly on Internet Service Provision.

 &gt; Maybe,  or we may see the free Net services evolve like in the UK.

We'll see something different:  When the ACCC decided to "declare" the 
local loop last week, they created an economic environment for 
telecommunications in Australia which is totally different from the
environment anywhere else in the world.  It's probably the first thing
the Government has done which will actually *benefit* a competitive
telco regime since deregulation began in the 1980's.

If Telstra decides to time-charge local calls, other telcos will be
able to offer fixed-price calls and you'll be able to say to Telstra,
"Get out of my life, I no longer wish to be a customer of yours, I'm
taking my business elsewhere.  Don't plug the wires leading to my home
into your equipment, plug them into your competitor's equipment instead."

If Telstra does something hostile to the needs of Australian 
telecommunications users, they'll very rapidly find that they are
no longer in a position to dictate the terms under which the market
will operate.  As such, I can't quite make up my mind about whether
I should be looking forward to the day that they time-charge local
calls, because that'll be the day on which their monopoly will end.

        having to buy it from Tollstra... ]
