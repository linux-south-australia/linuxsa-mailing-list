IN ORDER TO AVOID COMPLAINTS, MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND SUCH I QUOTE ALL
CORRESPONDENCE:

***

To ALL of You:

I have noted with interest that the tone of your postings has improved
since the threat (or is it the promise?) of banning. It is such a pity
that you couldn't have seen to it that this tone was used in some of
your previous postings to the list. Going through my archives now, there
have been times when it's not WHAT you say that upsets people but HOW
you say it.

I'm currently reading a biography of Aldof Hitler by Joachim Fest. It's
translated from the German and it details how through ostensible shows
of normality and humility that he fooled the world into a whole war.
Unfortunately, this current reincarnation of you only strikes me as
particularly false and either

1) somewhat akin to the historical man's maneouvers
2) one of the OTHER ghosts which existed in Stephen King's The Shining.

I think that it is unfortunate that you have allowed yourselves to speak
in such a manner as to offend the number of people you have. I'll make
it clear that you have offended me and to the point where I'm unwilling
to accept any apology from one, two or ALL of you.

Let this be a lesson to all of you. I hope that those of you who speak
in the polite tones that you speak now will realise the damage the other
one or ones have done to your collective account.

DAVID LLOYD

&gt; To ALL of You:


We appreciate that  :)

&gt; I have noted with interest that the tone of your postings has improved
&gt; since the threat (or is it the promise?) of banning.

Maybe it's all this 19 & 20 degree weather we've been enjoying... ;)

(Beware of the "Fallacy of the Single Cause" which we first saw
in a book by philosopher/logician I. M. Copi - at uni, long ago...)

&gt; It is such a pity that you couldn't have seen to it that this tone
&gt; was used in some of your previous postings to the list.

Why?  Others have used such a tone in their posts
(and not when replying to anything we've written...)

Have you written to them in this way (e.g. as below)?

&gt; Going through my archives now, there have been times when
&gt; it's not WHAT you say that upsets people but HOW you say it.


Dear fellow, as we walk through fields - e.g. in the Hills or by the sea
- we see both weeds and flowers growing along the way...

As we feel it's important enough to be able to distinquish the two
types of forms - just as we do between Night and Day - (even if
the plant types are only different by our present def'n of beauty),

somehow we manage to focus on (and perhaps take along with us)
the flowers and leave the weeds there for others to complain about.

That's our choice... you can make your own.  And Life goes on...

------------

Oh... I put this into a recent post... perhaps you missed it:

It the "Quote of the Month" from a US Scouting "Crew"
(possibly near Ohio State Uni, in Columbus Ohio):

<A HREF="http://www.post369.columbus.oh.us/ExpNews.d/1998.d/981229.Adventure.html">http://www.post369.columbus.oh.us/ExpNews.d/1998.d/981229.Adventure.html</A>

George Bernard Shaw

"Reasonable people adapt themselves to the world.
 Unreasonable people attempt to adapt the world to themselves.
 All progress, therefore, depends on unreasonable people."

 (I wonder how Copi would react to the above...  ;)

Tongue-in-cheek (mostly...), let me say...

  I find you to be a most *REASONABLE* fellow
  (How do you feel by our use of these words? ;)

&gt; I'm currently reading a biography of Aldof Hitler by Joachim Fest.

I'm not familiar with it... so, I won't comment.

&gt; It's translated from the German & it details how
&gt; through ostensible shows of normality and humility
&gt; that he fooled the world into a whole war.


Hmmm...

Do you find that related to any of the above?

(maybe you've read too much of our writings... and
are perhaps starting to make great leaps from
one concept to a only-slightly related other one... ;)

&gt; Unfortunately, this current reincarnation of you
&gt; only strikes me as particularly false and either:

&gt; 1) somewhat akin to the historical man's maneouvers


I don't see the similarity... I plan NO war, I asure you.

&gt; 2) one of the OTHER ghosts which existed in Stephen King's The Shining.


'haven't read that one either... so I can't comment here, either.

&gt; I think that it is unfortunate that you have allowed yourselves to speak
&gt; in such a manner as to offend the number of people you have.

Either that... or it is as unfortunate that you have allowed yourselves
to be effected by words in post(s)... while others - particularly,
inter-
state and across the world - continue to "get on with it" and accom-
plish much of genuine value... (mostly... ;)

&gt; I'll make it clear that you have offended me

I'll reply simply that I am not aware that we have met;
thus, you have chosen to read (and feel offense at)
our writings... we have posted as if to a bulletin board.

You - in the e-mail to which we now reply - have chosen
to compare us to Hitler (for reasons unclear).

We walk past (e.g.) political postings (on physical bul-
letin boards) all the time, some of which we disagree
with strongly and may even take offense at.

Somehow, we have the strength of character to retain
our common sense and balance after such passings.

And... Life goes on.

&gt; and to the point where I'm unwilling
&gt; to accept any apology from one, two or ALL of you.


Very humane of you (not).

Not to worry... none is (to be) offered.

&gt; Let this be a lesson to all of you. I hope that those of you who speak
&gt; in the polite tones that you speak now will realise the damage the other
&gt; one or ones have done to your collective account.


I am not aware of any such damage.

And none of us feels that we have caused
you or yours any damage either, for that
matter.

If you do, might I suggest that you consider
taking some legal action rather than send-
ing this kind of unsolicited e-mail to us.

(If you are right, you may find a lawyer to
take your case on a contingency basis.)

In the mean time, it's a nice day...
perhaps a nice long walk would
make you feel better... (it works
always for each of us... ;)

Kindly make any statements you like in public, if you must,
but - in future - spare us of any more *direct* e-mail of this
nature (e.g. comparing us and/or our behaviour to Hitler's).

Any additional direct e-mail of this kind will be grounds for
a letter to your service provider, et al.

Good day...  ;)

****

I refer specifically to the very last part of the message which appears
in the paragraphs above. Having grown up in Australia and been educated
in the Australian eduction system I am fully aware of emotional impact
of mentioning Adolf Hitler to other people. Nonetheless, there is a
valid and pertinent saying which indicates that we shuold all learn from
our history.

Any textbook on logic will indicate that analogy is a valid way to
argue. Perhaps I could reword my analogy to a particular emotion evoking
historical figure into: it seems that they have reworked themselves into
a resemblance of normality and politeness in order to fool those who
might otherwise know them for their real selves. That this historical
figure evoked a World War is part of history now; figuratively speaking
these people (i.e. the amorphous grouping called C4IS) have created a
great deal of debate - verbal war if you will have it - hence the
decision by the list owners.

I make no apologies for the way that I put my debates across. I make a
living out of debating motions and recommendatins upon the floors of
meetings; let those who are side-tracked or distracted from the
substance of my argument by the words I clothe it be side-tracked. I do
not enter a debate or argument to lose. The lowest I ever aim for is to
compromise.

If I may, with your indulgence, draw upon an analogy made by them. They
said  

&gt; Dear fellow, as we walk through fields - e.g. in the Hills or by the sea
&gt; - we see both weeds and flowers growing along the way...
&gt; 
&gt; As we feel it's important enough to be able to distinquish the two
&gt; types of forms - just as we do between Night and Day - (even if
&gt; the plant types are only different by our present def'n of beauty),

There are times when the weeds must be removed. I believe the dandelion
was introduced to Australia for it's then breathtaking beauty. Now an
obnoxious weed, what gardener have I seen who does not remove them&gt;? It
is very important to be able to distinguish the two types of forms and I
don't seem to be the only one whose decision it has been that these
particular specimens are not necessarily the flowers upon our parths in
life.

I'd like to finally comment that the last paragraphs of the last message
have already been undertaken. Although I support the proposed action for
the removal / banning of this particular email account it was not
actually my own instigation. The legal battle, my friends, has been
decided. Now, accept your fate and twist my words so much that you
cannot understand them in their own context.

Those in authority are not quite so unable to see the form, even the
intent of my argument. It is such a pity that you cannot.

DAVID LLOYD.


[NB.

It was my intention to make this reply and my original message only in a
private context. However, the other parties have requested that I reply
in a PUBLIC context....hence the original headers....]
