Subject: Min Size of Linux


&gt;I have a 1.GB Hard drive that I want to install Linux on. Unfortunately, I
&gt;have to install Windows (:-() because I need M$ office and a few other
&gt;things. Mainly I want Linux on just to play around with it and perhaps
&gt;install some word processing package (any recommendations?). I will
probably
&gt;install KDE and Gnome and a couple of other things such as Netscape. What
&gt;would be the minimum size I would need for the Linux side of things,
&gt;remembering that I need a windows partition?


I always recommend the Removable Hard-Drive solution...

for the cost of 2 mechanical (slightly electrical) accessories,
and a hard drive large enough for your smaller op sys reqt,
you can have your cake and eat it too...

I.e. Linux on one, Win (of your favorite flavor) on the other

In the simpler case, you would install just one of the two
accessories (i.e. enough to hold/remove 1 hard drive)

In the more versitile (if your case has room for it),
you would install 2 of the same accessories,
so that both hard-drives could be on-line at the same time

This enables Linux to reach across into the Win drive
for file sharing...

Having seen a few "I lost my partition" posts here
and considering the low cost of "small" (1 Gb) drives,
I would say:  Play it safe and keep the two op sys's
on separate drives (especially as it's often a Win-based
viruse that will create havoc with the dual-op sys
alternative hard drive arrangement)

You can always get another hard drive (and cheap!),
but you only live once...

Work smarter, not harder...  ;)
