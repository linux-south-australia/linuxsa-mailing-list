&gt; Dear Editor,
&gt; 
&gt; I firmly believe that the new Broadcasting Services Amendment law,
&gt; which our Government claims will protect children from exposure to
&gt; unsuitable Internet content, will not stop anyone from accessing anything.
&gt; The Government's own expert, the CSIRO, says this.  Internet providers
&gt; say this.  Foreign governments (who are now laughing at Australia),
&gt; say this.

&gt; Australians are about to be lulled into a false sense of security.
&gt; If you know you are at no risk from some particular threat there is
&gt; no reason to take precautions against it.  Parents, believing their
&gt; children to be safe from porn, won't see any need to supervise them.
&gt; How cheated they will feel when they discover their children have been
&gt; playing with porn all while the Government said it couldn't happen.
&gt; 
&gt; The Government, through this legislative deceit, has made the Internet
&gt; a much more dangerous place for our children.

Just goes to show you! After all this time, something David wrote that I
agree with ;) Not that I think the 'net is intrinsically unsafe for my
kids, but for the sort of parents who actually want and expect the
protections promised by the misguided legislation, they actually get the
side effect David describes instead.

I often wonder why it seems that the more people you get on the decision
making process (e.g. politics) the worse the end result. It is sort of
the opposite to the 'open software' development model, where the more
eyes you get on your project the better and faster it comes out. (what
was that effect called in 'The cathedral and the Bazaar'???)
