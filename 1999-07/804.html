Win 98 works ok.

Vmware is very handy Small Office/Business tool. Once set up Win98 will
run easily as well as it does on its own Hard Drive. And it runs windows
apps just as well. A system with a lot of grunt is needed. My 233mzP11
and 128mg ram is very slow. Once you have allocated space on your disk
(setup asks for 1 Gig) it will need to be formatted (a bit hairy).
Vmware prefer an upgraded X server to be used (available at their web
site). Install this first. While running it will use approx half your
ram, but this can be adjusted. -Good product.

&gt;         I am considering purchasing vmware but first of all I would like to
&gt; know if anyone has been able to get
&gt;         WIN95 to run in the Virtual Machine? If so how well does it run Win
&gt; app's?
&gt; 
&gt;         I have a AMD K6II 350 with 64 mb Ram, I realise I will probably need
&gt; 128mb for any productive performance.
&gt; 
&gt;         Are there any price wise and ease of setup comparable products
&gt; available? This email has no relation to the ad that was posted on this
&gt; group last week, I am not interested in that particular program.
&gt; 
&gt;         I apologise for all the questions but I would like to have as much
&gt; information as possible before I spend
&gt;         the rent money ;-)
