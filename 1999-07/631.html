In message &lt;002301becc07$e779f740$<A HREF="mailto:0400000a@esp">0400000a@esp</A>&gt; you write:
&gt; &gt;&gt; What would be the subject of his talk?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Not sure yet.  It will be non-technical,
&gt; &gt; probably like his "Something Warmfuzzy & Linuxy"
&gt; &gt; talk at CALU.
&gt; 
&gt; Only *local* speakers need to meet the usual req'ts.

[ Rant snipped ]

I only just read this mail, so sorry for the late reply.

You are an idiot.  I'm not normally a violent type, but *you* I want
to meet.

A number of speakers were invited to the conference; these were from
people I knew from experience were both Linux-relevent and excellent
presenters.  Andrew Tridgell, Jon Hall, Miguel de Icaza (replaced by
Federico Mena Quintero), Carsten `Rasterman' Haitzler, David Miller
and Cort Dougan were explicitly invited, and others (some with
prompting!) responded to the Call for Papers.

We put all speakers who wanted it up in cheap student accomodation,
gave them a free dinner, and flew them in from wherever they were.

*They* had to take time off work.  *They* had to travel for up to a
day each way.  And we didn't pay any of them.

&gt; Imported technologists are apparently not asked
&gt; such "mundane" questions as "Whatcha gonna
&gt; talk on?" by organisers...

Jon `maddog' Hall asked for a slot in addition to his keynote (for
which he was invited); I've seen a fair number of maddog's
presentations before, but with the impending move from Compaq he
didn't respond in time to my EMail asking for the title and blurb of
his talk.  Out of time, it was voted on by the committee, with
knowledge that it was a wildcard, but it still got in.

&gt; it's enough that they need a tax deduction & we need cheerleading
&gt; (?)

Fuck you.  Yeah, it was character-building to budget for 3 months to
fork out the money for the conference.  I especially enjoyed the
experience of going into overdraft.  My heart swooned when I decided
not to replace my broken laptop because I had to fund the conference.

Imagine my unadulterated joy when taking unpaid time off to organise
the conference.  What blissful delight to lose sleep, get stressed,
angry, and upset to run a conference, with the heavenly knowledge that
I wasn't going to attend 90% of it.

And everyone I know got dragged in as the event got closer; Duncan
Grove and Michael Neuling ended up ferrying people around, doing
photocopying, getting called out of tutorials to do stuff.  

They were so grateful to use up a week's holidays to work at a
conference!  I know Nathan Bailey, head of LUV, was delighted to have
to take time off to coordinate things on the ground at Monash when the
storm hit.

Like the Linux Kernel, this was not a democracy; the people actually
DOING IT put together what they thought would be a good conference.  I
apologise to any people who paid money and don't feel they got a fair
deal: PLEASE, EMail me (anonomously if you want) if you feel this way,
so next year's organisers can fix it.  Maybe we just don't know about
it...

I realise, C4IS, that you are not used to other people paying any
attention to what you say.  Please realise that there are real people
on the other end of the bitsream before greasing your keyboard for
anal insertion.

Meanwhile, I look forward to C4IS's conference,
Rusty.
