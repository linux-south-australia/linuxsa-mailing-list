&gt; &gt; This is getting off the track a bit isn't it?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; How is this helping the Linux community with you two fighting over
&gt; &gt; human rights.
&gt;
&gt; It doesn't have to help the Linux Community to be interesting. If you
&gt; don't like the thread, then hit delete and move on.  Please don't ask
&gt; people to modify their conversation because it doesn't fit in with
&gt; your idea of what the list should be. The list is what it's members
&gt; make it, both you and everyone else.

But this is list is called "LinuxSA" - isn't it designed for discussion of
linux-related issues?  If somebody thinks it's not linux-related - then
what's wrong with them mentioning it?

Your statement - "please don't ask people to modify their conversation"
etc..  aren't you asking someone to modify their conversation by doing
that??  Like you said yourself, the list is what it's members make it.
Seems a bit contradictory to me.

"it doesn't have to help the Linux Community to be intersting." - hmmm...
but again I say - this is the LinuxSA mailing list..  a flamewar such as the
one we're all currently grin-and-bearing could possibly be taken off-list..
and perhaps made a little less rude?

I dunno.

&gt; Personally I prefer off topic irrelevant rants and flames to "Is this
&gt; relevenat" posts" any day. Of course that's just my opinion, feel free
&gt; to disagree.

:)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; There must be a list server/group for you to discuss that argument
&gt; &gt; there?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; New Linux user looking to learn Linux.....
&gt;
&gt; And learn you will. Linux isn't all ones and zeros, and neither is
&gt; this list.

Linux -is- all ones and zeros.  And we're mostly water.

&gt; Advocay and the Linux community are all part of the big picture.

That's too profound for me to argue with..

&gt; (Hmm... Maybe "black and white" would be better than "ones and zeros",
&gt; cause no doubt someone will mention that an email *is* ones and zeros.
&gt; Alternatively, you'll just know what I mean.)

huh?
