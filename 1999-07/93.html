&gt;There is no "we".  There is no heirachy of those with and
&gt;those without influence.  That's what makes linux great.
&gt;You have an itch, develop a scratch and share it!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; How does the cost (e.g. time) of coordinating a global install-fest
&gt;&gt; pay off locally?


The question is still unanswered...
 
Think Globally... Act Locally...

&gt;&gt; E.g. has anybody in this "we" thought about includ-
&gt;&gt; ing country- and/or bush-based South Australians?
&gt;
&gt; If you want an installfest out in the bush - then organise
&gt; one - don't whinge - there _are_ plenty of opportunities
&gt; out there, and we all can't meet them all - so go out and
&gt; find your niche and meet it.


I find it interesting that - in SA - the logic is:

  If we decide to forget our own (e.g. country) people,
  so that we can follow the lead of others [Americans]
 in order to do something all-at-the-same-time...

 well, whoever suggests that we take care of our own
 should be criticized and told to do it himself...

 The others' (read: outsiders') promise of reward is
 more important than one's own... Have it your way ;)

- - -

BTW, I forgot to mention that there is a movement
to take Internet to the Bush (Internet to the Outback).

Ballarat Uni (Vic) seems to be the place organis'g it
with some sizable grants from telecomm co.['s] and
possibly gov't.

&gt; This is typical American whinging

The above is racist...

and seems to have been written by someone
who *doesn't* read the aus.politics newsgroup  ;)

BTW, I notice that the American economy seems to
be going pretty well, for all that "whinging" you see
over there...

(Apparently, squeaky wheels get oiled... elsewhere)

&gt; that makes me glad I'm an Australian.

OK by me, but I'm glad I'm an Australian for
somewhat more *positive* reasons, myself

&gt; And this paragraph is simply here
&gt; to realise that whinging on a race basis does nothing to
&gt; endear yourself to others.

 Correct... your racism (above) hasn't helped you sell.

&gt; And no, I don't really thin[k] this way -
&gt; my opinions are never based on one's race,
&gt; religion, creed or gender.


I see a contradiction here,
but leave it as an exercise
to the reader to find it... ;)

Have a nice day
