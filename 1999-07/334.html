	&lt;SNIP&gt;

&gt; is getting a bit more serious.  The only way to deal with this without
&gt; the crap being proposed is to have international co-operation and
&gt; sensible censorship rules.  Now if you think that wouldn't be a circus.
&gt; 
&gt; 
That's crap. Regardless of who co-operates or does this or that, the information will always be available. That's what the net is all about. Censorship should NOT be done by the government to protect my kid, I should be resposible for what my child does.  It starts at home.  One thing that is always left out of kids problems reported by the media is  the parents, where were the parents of the children who blew off their hand?  Teach your children in the way they should go. The net should not and cannot be regulated.
