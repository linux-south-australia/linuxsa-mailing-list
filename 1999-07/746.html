 &gt; Unless you're doing particularly i/o or cpu intensive stuff, old
 &gt; pentium-class PC's can do most tasks without even breaking into a
 &gt; sweat..

&lt;shrug&gt;  The definition of "I/O and CPU intensive stuff" is changing,
though.  Try running RealPlayer-G2 on a 486 Linux box.  Or listen to
an MP3.  Or run Applixware.  Or play Quake-II.  Or run Netscape 4.x.

Try running Enlightenment on a Pentium-II 350 MHz :-)

In the windows world, bloat is driven by a combination of the OS and
applications.  In the open-source would the applications the bloat-
potential of the OS is smaller, but the applications are kinda the same
no matter what OS you're running.

I predict that as commercial developers turn towards Linux, their 
products will start to be viewed as "standard essentials" in the same
way that they are in the MS world -- We no longer take a platform 
that can't do RealAudio seriously;  We used to poo-pooh the idea
that an office suite was an absolute requirement for a desktop 
system, then StarOffice was released and suddenly everyone's talking
about how slow it is and how much they need to beef up their systems
to run it.

Over time, Linux hardware requirements will accellerate to a level 
similar to the requirements of Windows.  

 &gt; The problem is - do you know what you want to do with your machine over
 &gt; the next 3 years?

Three years ago I had no idea that I'd want to run Quake-II, and I 
bought a low-end Pentium and a low-end S3-based video card accordingly.
Making these kinds of predictions is impossible; The best advice I can
give is "buy the most expensive system you can afford and be prepared
to add incremental upgrades to it over the next 18 months," otherwise
you'll be disappointed when you go to install RealPlayer G12 and find
that you only get 2 frames-per-second out of it.
