&gt; ** TOTAL LINUX NEWBIE ALERT **

You most welcome to ask Q's. Many ppl here are also new to Linux.

&gt; I have recently installed Openlinux 2.2 and after using LISA to install as
&gt; LIZARD wouldn't work with my graphics card I booted up. Now, not
&gt; surprisingly X wouldn't load except for in a crazy 320x400!
&gt; 
&gt; My graphics card is an on-board AGP SiS620 and I managed to download an 
&gt; XServer that supposedly works with it. when I try to run the server
&gt; however I get a screen with what looks like a default desktop pattern
&gt; and a large rectangle for a mouse cursor. My only option is to
&gt; CTRL-ALT-BKSPCE out of there and attempt to work out 
&gt; what's going wrong...
&gt; 
&gt; Now I should let you know that when I load the SiS620 server the resoulution
&gt; does appear to be 640x480.. so it seems to be communicating with the
&gt; card ok, I'm unsure as to where the problem lies.

Did you set the link up for the new server? 
	Ie: ls -l /usr/X11R6/bin/X    should show a link point to the
					xserver you downloaded

If you did.

try putting: Option "noaccel" in your XF86Config file 
(type: find / -name 'XF86Config') to find where it is located.

Ie this is it inplace with my videocard

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Tseng ET6000"
    VendorName  "Tseng"
    BoardName   "ET6000"
    videoram 2048
    Option "noaccel"      # when problems with accelerator
    #Option "hw_cursor"    # Use hardware cursor (see docs for
correct
EndSection

&gt; I know I probably haven't included enough info or even made much sense here 
&gt; but it's late, I'm tired! Any help would be appreciated...!

We work with what we have :)

If that fails to work send us the output of when you start the x server.
Ie under bash:

X &&gt; /tmp/xoutput

Then send us/me the file xoutput

Cheers,
