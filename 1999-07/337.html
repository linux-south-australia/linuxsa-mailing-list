 &gt; Can anybody give me a simple explanation of what transparent proxies are,
 &gt; and how they work?

Since we have transparent proxies in our machine room upstairs serving
DAIS (and the rest of the State Government), I have no problem at all
with answering this.  :-)  I'm going to put my Internode hat on for a 
moment and switch into "employee of somebody else" mode.

Consider a Squid server:  It accepts HTTP queries on a pre-configured
port number and responds with a HTTP data stream back to the client.
That's all very standard, straightforward and mundane, with the downside
being that users' browsers need to be configured to use it.


     USER                        PROXY                     WEBSITE 1.2.3.4
     GET <A HREF="http://1.2.3.4">http://1.2.3.4</A> --------&gt;
                                 GET <A HREF="http://1.2.3.4">http://1.2.3.4</A> -----------&gt;
                                 &lt;---------------------- response: src=1.2.3.4
     &lt;-------------------------- response: src=PROXY

Now imagine a slightly different setup:  Configure your organization's
border router so that any traffic for TCP port 80 gets diverted to a
specific machine.  Install a modified squid server on that machine which
accepts inbound packets destined for *any* IP address, and sends 
reply packets with forged source addresses which match the destination
addresses used in queries.

End users now don't need to configure their browsers:  The routers and
the modified proxy server do it all for them.


    USER                         PROXY                     WEBSITE 1.2.3.4
    GET <A HREF="http://1.2.3.4">http://1.2.3.4</A> ---------------&gt; blocked at router
                                        (and diverted to proxy)
                                 GET <A HREF="http://1.2.3.4">http://1.2.3.4</A> -------------&gt;
                                 &lt;---------------------- response: src=1.2.3.4
    &lt;---------------------------forged response from
                                PROXY: src=1.2.3.4

Believe it or not, it's possible to set this up with NAT and ipfilter/
ipfwadm/ipchains.

Once the conceptual issues are out of the way, other issues can be
dealt with as well.  For example, Cisco uses a protocol called WCCP
(Web Cache Coordination Protocol) to load-balance a farm of
transparent proxy servers sitting on their own dedicated switched
ethernet segment.  To avoid having your proxy server turn into a
bottleneck, you can keep adding WCCP-compliant proxy servers until
you have "enough" of them.

Transparent proxies *only* deal with HTTP, too, which is a
simple-enough problem domain to be handled by an embedded system which
is designed solely and specifically to do HTTP *fast*.  Cisco sell a
range of 1-RU embedded system based proxy servers which are
outrageously fast, faster than anything squid could ever hope to
achieve (our CacheEngine CE-500's upstairs happly saturate a 100baseT
network, and we have three of them with 36 Gbytes of disk each on a
switch handling WCCP-distributed HTTP queries).  We end up using a
squid to cache ftps and the CacheEngine boxes for HTTP.

If you (or anyone else) wants to come in and see the gear and/or ask
questions, feel free.  We're happy to show-off our facilities to anyone
who wants to see them, to inspire confidence in the minds of our customers
and jealousy in the minds of our competitors :-)  Just give us a call
to organize it.
