Hi, I realise this is not really linux related (other than I am using
linux netscape & this relates to TRYING to search for some linux related
info on the internet!)
I was after some info on kernel-2.2.7, nothing important, just
curiosity!! 
I happened to be looking at some stuff on the latest linux netscape
(4.61) so used netscape search!
I entered kernel-2.2.7 as my search criteria... was quite confused at
the results because I had references to 2.2.5, 2.2.8
2.2.6 etc... all was revealed when I got to the end of the screen!! 
Read this:

               "7" is a very common word and was ignored.

               Next 10 web sites for 'kernel-2.2.7' 

I tried sticking inverted commas around it etc etc but it kept telling
me "7" is blah blah... interestingly enough, there were actually less
references to 7 than any other ^@$%@#$ number!!

So, I tried Altavista.... 1st result was a dead link.... 2nd one was
www.coldbird.com & whilst it was definately a linux site, there was not
a single mention of kernel-2.2.7!!!! 3rd result did have the
"kernel-2.2.7" on the page!!

I can understand truncating the search on the basis that it may produce
too many results..but surely if I ask for 2.2.7 that is what I want!!

This sounds stupid, but I am sure that in the last 6-8 months ALL the
search engines have begun to NOT search for what I ask for... is it me,
or has anyone else noticed this trend??

Oh, a linux related item... went into our local Angus & Robertson
bookstore here in Mt Gambier, cos they had a sale on...I thought I was
in LINUX Heaven.... there were cardboard penguins hanging everywhere...
:) Turns out Penguin Books are doing a promo :))
