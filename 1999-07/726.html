You know what I REALLY, REALY DESPISE on mailing lists?

  - blank/non-specific subject lines; they encourage me to waste my
    time by forcing me to read the dribble to find out whether I want
    to read it or not.

  - spelling mistakes in the subject or body of the article.  That
    realy suks.

  - posts that say "check out this URL...", but don't give any clues
    or summary about it to let you know if you will be interested in
    it or not.

  - When people don't finish what

  - submissions from brain-dead mail clients that don't include a
    "References:" header to allow smart news readers to thread the
    entries properly.

  - submissions from brain-dead users that reply to an existing
    article with brand new subject-matter without changing the subject
    line.

  - submissions that format 
    paragraphs with the lines 
    less than 40 chars long.

  - submissions that don't format paragraphs at all, so that the lines just wrap around the screen.

  - HTML.  Don't get me started.

  - MIME headers that say "charset=NIL".  ;-)

The number one thing that I really, realy despise on mailing lists is:

  - intolerance.

(Dammit, people, I'm saying this tongue-in-cheek, in case it isn't
really, realy (sic!) obvious!)

Now the serious part:

This list has a collective 'nix knowledge that is very high, but a
collective maturity level that doesn't match it.

If you don't like what some twit is writing, use the approach
suggested by Martin Sandiford &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ms@mcdev.com.au">ms@mcdev.com.au</A>&gt;, and get your news
reader (or mail forwarder) to delete their stuff before you see it.
It is not that hard.  What about a LinuxSA session on "setting up
fetchmail, procmail, and GNUS (with a really good score file)"?

Another little quip I heard recently:  "The guy can't be a _complete_
imbecile; there were bits missing!".

I say "no de-listing".
