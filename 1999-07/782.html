I have successfully installed StarOffice 5.1 on a number of Linux machines
recently.

When installing on a RedHat6 machine, the setup program will complain about
missing glibc libraries...but you can safely ignore this and all will work
fine. I didn't have this problem with RedHat5.2...but that was because I had
manually installed new glibc libraries on that one.

Now...once you've untarred the archive, just go to the so51inst/office51
directory and run 'setup'. WARNING, if you are using the S3V X-server, then
you should have the following environment variable set before running the
setup and StarOffice itself:

"setenv SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50 true"

Be sure to enter in the correct customer/product numbers, etc when
installing. I also added StarOffice's 'bin' directory to my path.

By default, StarOffice want to install in your home directory....pretty
messy. To get around this, and therefore allow other users to use the
program, run setup with the '/net' option. You can then install StarOffice
elsewhere, such as /usr/local/Office51. Now each user who wants to use
StarOffice must run the 'setup' program from within StarOffice's bin
directory...this time with no arguments. This will create an Office51
directory in the user's home directory...but will only install about 2MB of
data there !

Hope this helps...BTW, StarOffice has some nice fonts in its 'fonts/type1'
and 'fonts/75dpi' directories. On some linux systems I've had to manually
add these directories to the FontPath (or font server config file) so that I
could then use these fonts for other apps as well.

Cheers,
Kristian.

Subject: KDE state AND Star Office


Greetings, all.

1. A tip for the unaware.  KDE stores the last state (so it can restore it
for you if possible) in ~/.kde/share/config/kwmrc.
This file is ASCII and therefore editable (with CARE!).  I had a program
freeze on me, and I could NOT get rid of it, no matter what, and KDE kept
reloading the freezed program :-(.
Problem solved by removing lines in kwmrc which referred to the offending
binaries.

2. Anyone had success installing Star Office v5.1 ?
I downloaded the tarred program, but NONE of the documentation relates to
what actually happens when the archive is unpacked.  The instruction to go
to where the achive resides 'eg in c:\download' didn't instil confidence,
either!

Thanks for any help you can provide.
