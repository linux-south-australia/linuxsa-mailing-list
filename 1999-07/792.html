I like the idea.  It would be a great way to get
any wanna-be power users and programmers up to speed...
and remind me of all the things I don't yet know...
...THEN...
we could really have fun with some serious
hack-festing.. pick a GPL program(or part there of),
pull it apart.. .. put it back together..  submit fixes!
[Imagine that on your resume!]

This is a little bit more organised than the..
'just do it' and 'RTFN' or 'RTSL' attitude of most
developers, but it could be expanded to include
writing documentation, test suites etc.  and
would certainly benefit all involved...

Are there any programs out there that particularly
bug people? or people would like wriitten?
I know Duncan (of CALU Beofulf fame) was
bemoaning the lack of administration tools
for clusters.

What about some e-commerce solutions?
(...that could get tricky... no different to
everybody using sendmail though..)

&gt; A weekend, organized in time similarly to a choir rehearsal
&gt; camp, would be 3 formal sessions of about 3 hours each per day,
&gt; plus limitless informal sessions in the main room, with people
&gt; learning the way computers have always been best learned -
&gt; by asking the person sitting next to you.
&gt;
&gt; The timetable would be Fri 6-9 p.m., Sat. 9-12,
&gt; 2-5 p.m., 7-10 p.m., Sun 10-1, 2-5, or something like that.
&gt; That would be about 18 hours of intensive formal time --
&gt; i.e. 18 1-hour talks by specialists in each topic.
&gt; That's equivalent to about a year of linuxSA meetings.
&gt;
&gt; This is such an obviously good idea, I'm certain I'll
&gt; be told that it's been done already.
&gt;
&gt; But _please_ don't let this be a stimulus for
&gt; a long thread of dilute postings.
&gt;
&gt; The name of the thing could be Linux Fest 99,
&gt; or LinuxFest99a for the first one, LinuxFest99b for the
&gt; second one etc. Or LinuxFest Adelaide 0.0, LinuxFest Adelaide 0.1
&gt; and so forth.
&gt;
&gt; Cheers,
&gt; Alan Kennington.
