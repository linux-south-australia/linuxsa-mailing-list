Subject: Re: Linux Install Fest? - Constructive Ideas


&gt;This is my last public comment on this thread.

I have my doubts, but time will tell...
take your bat & ball, & go home if you must...

but... I would invite you to let such input
as you find - for some reason - "disheartening"
affect you like water off a duck's back...
it simply washes away & evaporates...

The choice is, of course, yours...

&gt; Private emails may or may
&gt; not be responded to on this thread.


Hmmm... don't do anything rash...

&gt;The Open Source Community can do what it wants.

It usually does... and so it shall in future...

&gt; If you don't think LinuxSA is doing things right
&gt; you have the Freedom (as in the spirit of Free Software)
&gt; to do whatever you want.

Well, Stallman *did* say "like Free Speech, not Free Beer"

(I'm pleased that no one challenged him on the former...)

&gt; Raise yourself to the occassion, start doing things rather
&gt; than sitting on the sidelines complaining.

Gee, the gov't calls in consultants and pays them well
to troubleshoot and you don't write like this... (e.g. on
the allocation of tax-payers' money); maybe you should.

I think contributing ideas & policy (e.g. should Linux SA
try to take Linux to places where money is less easily
found... for some...?   &lt;== that's a policy issue) *is*
doing things.

Rather than discussing the trade-off's of the idea/policy
you would rather leave the discussion?

&gt; Many others have, and many more will.
&gt; You have the Freedom to do it.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I simply suggested that "behind closed doors"
&gt;&gt; planning was out-of-character for Linux-ists... &
&gt;
&gt;Rubbish.  The first steps of any project takes co-ordination
&gt;of the infrastructure.  Linus did not release the kernel until
&gt;0.1 he had done work by himself without any involvement.  Have 
&gt;a look at *any* Open Source project you will find that most of
&gt;them started 'behind closed doors'.  When the time was right 
&gt;the projects opened.


It would be immodest of you to compare
developing an operating system with
organising an install fest, Matt.

Nevertheless, I prefer Tique's response
to your own.  She asked for input.

&gt; The same is with this.  You will just have to wait.

For what would I be waiting...
What am I missing here?

&gt; I actually now regret even hinting that something
&gt; was even remotely getting planned.


One has to think things though before acting...
and have a few contingency plans ready,
in the event of disappointment, I guess.

&gt; In time, more things will be said about it. 

Until then, I'll keep my eye on SlashDot.org

Enjoy your holiday...

we'll see you when you get back
