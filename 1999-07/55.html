&gt;     Some (actually, only 3) of the Coffs people people want to do an
&gt; "Install Fest",  (I have given myself the short straw to get info) so with
&gt; your experience, can you offer any guidance, "watchits" or even basic
&gt; ground rules?

LinuxSA had one last year in about August.  Not only did South Australia
have one, but I loosely co-ordinated a national instalfest day with the
User groups at

	<A HREF="http://www.linux.org.au/projects/installfest98/">http://www.linux.org.au/projects/installfest98/</A>

Around the same time, Canada and France had similar efforts.

Visit <A HREF="http://www.installfest.com/">http://www.installfest.com/</A> to find out some general info on Linux
Installfests.

&gt;     Have you ever done an Install Fest?  Would you do it again?  The Sydney
&gt; LUG did one earlier this year and I have contacted them.  I have read
&gt; everything I could find, but it all seems to refer to Canada and USA  -
&gt; does not seem relevant to Oz, at least not to a remote area like ours with
&gt; a relatively small population, long distances and sub-standard Telstra
&gt; services.

We will, just a matter of organising one.  

Can let much out of the bag at the moment, but there are moves afoot to
have a global installfest.  More will come on that later.

&gt;     Any help/suggestions would be nice. Please reply off-list if you think
&gt; this is an off-topic.

Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get co-ordinated.  Get people
to volunteer to assist in installs, demos and just walk-throughs.  If you
can make it clear who and who isn't an 'official' through hats or badges
or something it makes a big difference.

Regards,

Matt
