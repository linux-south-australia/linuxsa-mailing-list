  LK&gt; That means I can get i.e a debian system and use the utilities
  LK&gt; from Redhat distribution ?

Please be more specific.  What "utilities" do you need from red hat that
aren't found on your debian distribution?

  LK&gt; I don't think so .try get the kde-1.1.1 from redhat update
  LK&gt; website and installed it to your debian system.Although you can
  LK&gt; use the alien utilites but it just fail.

Please be more specific.  What steps exactly did you perform and what
error messages did you get when it failed?

  LK&gt; And also for the library compability.You just can't get any
  LK&gt; library from any distribution and upgrade it !

Please be more specific.  What library of what distribution do you
need to upgrade, and why do you think you need to upgrade it, and what
error messages were seen when you tried to upgrade it?

  LK&gt; BTW , correct me if I'm wrong ,because the Debian package .deb
  LK&gt; is quite slow to come out 

This is not accurate in the case of the KDE packages.  I have already
posted to this list the URL of a web site that contains plenty of KDE
stuff ready for a debian system.  They have core KDE 1.1.1 packages,
KDE 2.0 development packages, and kde-devel (constantly updated from
CVS (1.1.x strain)).

To obtain the debian packages, add one of these lines to
/etc/apt/sources.list :
      deb <A HREF="http://snowcrash.tdyc.com">http://snowcrash.tdyc.com</A> potato kde contrib rkrusty
if you're running "unstable", or
      deb <A HREF="http://snowcrash.tdyc.com">http://snowcrash.tdyc.com</A> slink kde contrib rkrusty 
if you're running "stable" (Debian 2.1)

For more information, see <A HREF="http://kde.tdyc.com/Debian/">http://kde.tdyc.com/Debian/</A>

(Apart from this, have you considered running another (possibly better)
window manager if you're having trouble getting KDE up?  What other
window managers have you tried?)

  LK&gt; and I don't want to compile my program ,I had to anyway get the
  LK&gt; more update files from rpm package ( the only binary distribtion
  LK&gt; ).Alas , It just won't work.

Please be more specific about what versions of the various
distributions you are running; you have asked questions of this group
regarding so many major distributions (see the subject line), as well
as some do-it-yourself version of linux, that no-one can really have
any idea about what system you're running.

No disrespect intended, but have you noticed that commas (`,') and
periods (`.') are always attached to the right hand side of words in
the written English language?  Or that they are always followed by a
space (` ')?  The reason that I mention it is that I've noticed that
some people really object to poor punctuation, and they will not help
people until it is improved.  So for best support, always type very
carefully.

&lt;OFF-TOPIC&gt; 
Does anyone on this list know if there are any Malaysian linux user /
support groups around?
&lt;/OFF-TOPIC&gt;
