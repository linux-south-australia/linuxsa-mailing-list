Please don't misunderstand me.  It's not a question of training
anyone else's employee.  People who seek work experience can be
no-hopers.  It can take substantial effort to babysit such people.
I think it's easy to understand why a company would be reluctant
to spend that effort when they're not even looking for staff.  (If
they were looking for staff then one wouldn't be cold-calling for
work experience, one would be responding to an advertisement.)

In my personal experience, getting great skills in IT needs nothing
more than a computer and a genuine interest.  I think people who
have a computer and still need somebody to teach them are probably
never going to be great.  Somebody who has a computer AND has the
enthusiasm might still need some formal experience, but when they
come they'll be so bright and switched on that "work experience"
would be the last thing on anyone's mind.

As an aside, none of what I wrote is intended as a comment on
whoever it was that started this thread.  I have and express no
idea about her (?) skills, enthusiasm or ability.


&gt; So, by you, there isn't a shortage of IT people in Australia...?

There's certainly a shortage of great people and a terrible oversupply
of hopeless, lazy or unthinking people.


&gt;&gt; I like your suggestion  &lt;snip&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Good, then I can depend on your support to 'kill' the censorship bid?

Why would I stand up for you?  You're a whinger; you make snide comments
about people behind their backs; you refuse to follow convention and for
no apparent good reason; and you piss people off, and I believe you do it
to try to get a rise.  If I were to stand up for you I certainly wouldn't
want you to know about it lest you mistake it as tacit approval of your
standard behaviour.


&gt; A few bigger, mail-order box-pushers - no support,
&gt; just good, honest, cheap distribution of Linux s/w;
&gt; (e.g. Linux Australia could run one as a fund-raiser)

You ask for good, honest, cheap distribution of Linux yet you bitch
at NetCraft who sit around waiting to burn CD's at my whim and hand
deliver them, and it costs me less than $50.  I don't want to know
what you think cheap means.  (And NetCraft *also* do support, and
often for free, e.g. this list.)


&gt; My point:  Who says ONE company must take all that work on
&gt; themselves.

I thought you were.  You grizzle that they only sell RedHat.  If what
you really mean is to grizzle that nobody sells other Linuxes (which
happens not to be true) then go start a business selling it yourself.

&gt; There is a recurrent pattern in several of the debates that I've
&gt; been a party to:

Yes.  Paranoia; whining; and uncalled for criticism about NetCraft.

Sorry, Chuck, this is where I get of this debate with you.  I find
it as stimulating as the last one.  (Yawn.)
