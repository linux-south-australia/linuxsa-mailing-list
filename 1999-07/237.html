(The names have been removed to protect the not-so-innocent)
Here is a transcript of a project which is attempting to get a number of
proxy servers working without massive memory leaks.

After testing of alternative solutions proved to solve the problem - here is
the recommendation.

Thats it for me folks - I am outta here !

------------------- transcript follows here --------------------
&gt; Please see below an update on the efforts to resolve problems with the
&gt; slow Internet response.

xxxx , 

&gt; Internet Update 8 July 1999:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Another Proxy server has been shipped to SOC - ETA Thursday 8 July.
&gt; Once received Proxy server will require rebuilding.
&gt; 2) Microsoft are to send a Consultant to Boral to work on-site with the
&gt; team in an attempt to identify and resolve on-going problems experienced.
&gt; To date MS Premier Support arrangements have been via telephone contact
&gt; with MS.
&gt; 3) Netscape has been rejected as an alternative option - this option will
&gt; not be pursued as an alternative at this point in time.
&gt; 
&gt; We are hoping that MS' direct personal involvement will aid a swift
&gt; resolution or at least to further identification of the cause of problem.
&gt; 
&gt; If you require any further information, please don't hesitate to contact
&gt; me.

&gt; 
&gt; Further to the E-mail below would you please provide an update of the
&gt; current status with this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; Our user response is that the system is still slow ( & in fact the
&gt; reactive response is that it is getting worse).
&gt; 
&gt; The complaints regarding this problem have been vocal from many quarters
&gt; and criticism is being made that little or no progress is being made,
&gt; consequently I am extremely interested in your progress report and any
&gt; positive feedback you can provide.

&gt; 		We last spoke about the above subject on the 31/5/1999 when
&gt; you advised me of the Mini Project that had been established to
&gt; investigate this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 		Would you please provide me with a progress update and the
&gt; proposed future directions & timeframes.
