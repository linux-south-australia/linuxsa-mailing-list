I'm sure someone will take issue with some of this, but...

 &gt; Linux hardware experts and others:
 &gt; For a while I've been planning to build a 
 &gt; really nice computer for myself, to run linux,
 &gt; and to be my main work computer for the next 3 years.

3 years?  That's a bit of a stretch.  A kick-ass computer bought today
will be somewhat inadequate running the kinds of applications we'll
be taking for granted in three years time.

When you say it's your "work" computer, is this a self-employment thing
or still with the Government?  If it's the latter you should be able
to wrangle a faster turn-around on upgrades than three years; if it's
the former then you should plan to upgrade in 12-18 months.

 &gt; Problem:
 &gt; I can't quite work out how the real experts, the in-crowd,
 &gt; make up computers. There seem to be these options:
 &gt; 1.	"Mums and dads" store 
 &gt; 	I.e. Try to get the "main street" computer
 &gt; 	store to understand what I'm looking for in a
 &gt; 	"linux computer".

Sometimes works.

 &gt; 2.	Buy the parts from mail order magazines,
 &gt; 	and put it together "au hazard", as the
 &gt; 	French say.

Substitute "the net" for "mail order magazines," and you can be on a 
winner if you can find the right price points.  Brand-name hardware
is the same no matter where you get it from (so you don't need to
worry about crappy quality from unknown vendors).

 &gt; 3.	Buy the parts from local stored, and proceed
 &gt; 	as in (2).

This one works best, but I'd register a business name as a
prerequisite and do the stuff necessary to get on the reseller list of
a parts wholesaler.  Paying retail sucks.

 &gt; 4.	Find some fanatic who wakes up thinking about
 &gt; 	linux hardware compatibility tables first
 &gt; 	thing every morning and knows what voltage
 &gt; 	is on every wire in the whole computer.

I have difficulty finding people who *aren't* like that.  Perhaps
that says something about my social circles :-)

 &gt; If I wanted MS wind98 or whatever, I'd go to the
 &gt; local store. But in the past, this has yielded
 &gt; computers with bits that don't work with linux 
 &gt; (ethernet card, video card...)

Post to newsgroups/mailing-lists/etc with advice about the best
and brightest hardware to place in a server and specifically order
the bits -- Go into the deal knowing more about what you want than
the salesman knows, and make sure the requested components are the
ones you actually end up with -- "Accept no substitutes".

This is where building from parts wins out:  Most vendors have a 
set of commodity-item preferred hardware they place into every machine
they build;  If your favorite video card, network card, make/model of
hard disk, etc isn't on that list, it costs extra because they don't
get volume discounts from their suppliers.  So you buy your hard disk
from the vendor who defaults to including the one you want in all their
systems, your motherboard from the vendor who defaults to that one, etc,
and take advantage of the volume discounts you'll get from all of them.
I'm sure they'll hate you for it, but you have to remember who exists
to serve whom. :-)

CPU prices don't vary too much, so you can get them from anyone.  Items
like Ethernet cards are so cheap that there's hardly any point shopping
around (why quibble over a $10 price difference in a machine that's
going to cost $3000 anyway?).  But building from parts can yield rather
good savings on the expensive items like the motherboard, disk, memory,
etc.

 &gt; Absolutely best for me would be to discover
 &gt; that there's a store in town with all of the components
 &gt; that I can just buy and put together, with some helpful
 &gt; advice from an expert store owner.

You'll pay for that.  Time's money.

 &gt; But I can't even work out how I would buy a 
 &gt; yeong yang case. Obviously it would be big cost and
 &gt; effort to import something from Taiwan or the US.

One word:  Rackmount :-)
