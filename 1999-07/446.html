<H1>International LinuxSA subscribers & LI/Maddog</H1>

I've been noticing that there are a fairly large number of international
subscribers to this list (which is a Good Thing -- the more
international dialogue, the better). the question I have is "why"?

Possible answers include:
1:  a lack of LUGs and Linux Mailing Lists in these countries
2:  LUGs & LMLs are hard to find in these countries
3:  the subscribers are ex-adelaidians, or visited at some stage, so
this is the natural point of contact
4:  The LinuxSA list, or (South) Australians in general have a good
international Linux reputation, and people gravitate to LinuxSA to
absorb the guruness.

If the last is the case, well, maybe there is something LI could do
about this -- sponsoring training courses! :) Anyway, moving along...
The idea I have had is that if any of the first three are the case, then
somehow, between Linux International and the user groups (this group
being just one of many similar ones), an effort could be co-ordinated
(promoted on /., LI, LUGs, and so on) to try to form/locate LUGs in
these countries.

It could be co-ordinated almost automatically via CGI on LI's page
(www.li.com ?). It could also be possible for LI to have a page (or ten
:) on how to set up a LUG, and even web hosting services for LUGs. (How
much space & traffic does a LUG take to host, geoffrey/matthew/someone
else who knows?). LI could host mailing lists (eg <A HREF="mailto:linuxsa@au.li.com">linuxsa@au.li.com</A> or
something), and have geographically sorted (ie a map) links to the LUGs
pages. These pages could even be partly set up by LI, so LUGs don't need
to duplicate material, and even much of the HTML could be generated,
giving a common look and feel (maybe I'm taking this too far). The main
advantages of an approach like this are that it takes the burden of
administration away from LUG co-ordinators, and provides a centralised
user group -- possibly a foundation for forming national chapters of LI.
The lists themselves could also be added to a central list, which could
be used for *important* announcements, with only the select few allowed
to post -- perhaps a regular (monthly) Linux/LUG FAQ, and Global
InstallFest announcements, etc.

Anyway, does anyone have an opinion on this? (silly question... :P) It
would be particularly interesting to hear from our international
correspondents regarding the LUG status in their home nation (and also
from other non South Australians, for that matter -- or even those in
remote parts of the state, like Mount Gambier)

PS If this has already been discussed, or if it is already covered
somewhere, could someone please post something? Ta
