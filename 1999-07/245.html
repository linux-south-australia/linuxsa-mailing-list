Nothing out of the ordinary.  I originally thought it might be a POD or
DOS attack but there's nothing to indicate it anywhere.  I'm also
getting ping transfers between this machine and another on the same
local network of up to 10000ms.  I know that's not right.  
 
&gt;         With a card of the same brand/make, or different?
&gt;         Sound like there's something wrong with the ethernet run itself
&gt;         (or maybe the hub setup).
&gt;         BNC or RJ-45? (If it's a BNC run, are people on the same run
&gt;         experiencing problems as well???)

Thats where the major problem comes in, I have several machines, all
running identical cards with no trouble at all.  This one on the other
hand has given me more trouble than it's worth.  One thing I don't
understand at all os why the card is on IRQ 18,  I thought 15 was the
highest available unless this is something to do with the dual Pentium
II cpu's on the mainboard.

I've tried changing cards (identical and completely different) with no
luck, always the same problem.  CPU loads are minimal, it's only
ethernet traffic that's having any problems at all and this machine is
one of my main gateways so I can't really afford for this to happen.

The whole local network is running on several 10 base T hubs using RJ45
connections.   I already checked the ethernet cabling, connections at
the hub etc but all looks ok.

Any ideas?

Cheers

Tim
