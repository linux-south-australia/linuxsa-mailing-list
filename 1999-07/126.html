Posts fly in this direction or that...

Some take them (or the flames)
within them seriously... others,
e.g. myself, take them in stride.

Let me propose a model for this
mailing list, applicable to any...

Suppose we try-on the model
of a Brainstorming Session...

You know the kind... people
get together and throw ideas
around... rather freely.

All this freedom can come
(to some) from Freedom of
Speech...

and (to others) from a desire
to be a bit creative.

We've seen a nice example
today, in a post from our
"on-the-spot" reporter (i.e.
the imagined "riot" over
Tux on the cover of APC.

I enjoyed reading it immensly!

In any case, since we are all
at fairly safe distances from
each other, let's agree to
give & take ideas (via posts)
with less emotional response.

That's how Think Tanks work,
people let their creativity - to
some extent - overpower 
their civility... sometimes...
(i.e. in the safe context of a
Brainstorming Session/Room)

It's OK... since it's all for the
purpose of creating and -
later - collecting new ideas.

Instead of taking offense,
just let it go by, as if you
were seeing people debate
on the Parliament Floor
on TV... and... you KNOW
how far from civility THAT
place can go (or has done,
in past)...

(By contrast, I think Linux SA
has stayed well within bounds;
no one has needed parliamen-
tary privilege to make their
points... ;)

I, for one, do not think our
politicians should have
freedoms denied to us...
incl'g Freedom of Speech.

Where else do new ideas
come from?

After all, someone, some-
where is always going to
be somewhat offended by
an idea that changes "the
way it's always been"...

We should recognise this
and be ready to consider
any and all ideas, even
some that come wrapped
in barbed wire...

Or, if that's asking too much
- e.g. from the school-uniform
mob - then we should, at the
least, all feel free to post any
ideas that come to mind.

Hopefully, a lot of good ones
will overpower any lousy ones,
of course.

Later, people are free to sift
through the ashes, so to speak,
in the search for FAQ's, and -
hopefully - enough pointers to
their answers (and, sometimes,
answers as well) to justify col-
lecting them into a bit of usable
material that will later save
the next generation some time.

What'cha think?
