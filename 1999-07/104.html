Subject: New APC Mag


&gt;Just noticed walking past the newsagent - there is a monstrous stack of new
&gt;APC's with a glorious yellow cover dominated by a life-size Tux penguin,
&gt;with the glaring title 'Is Windows Cracking'.


&gt;Small print invites readers to look at the competive analysis of various
&gt;OSen - Linux, MacOS, BeOS, Win98, Win2000.

Is all this having any effect?


&gt; It is nice to see the banner headline and the penguin
&gt; being shoved in people's faces where it cannot be ignored.


Another person likes "push" technology, I see... ;)

&gt; It is truly frightening how many Corporate IT Managers
&gt; determine their companies future IT strategy
&gt; solely on the basis of a cursory glance through
&gt; a pulp-computer magazine that
&gt; they flick through at the airport terminal

Does anybody know any "Corporate IT Managers"
who accurately fit this description...?

I think I may have met more "Corporate IT Mgrs
in my years than you have, but none seemed
to have a desk full of the like of APC magazine.

(I would suggest that marketing is more sophis-
ticated than you may want to believe... with, e.g.
the kind of soft kid gloves treatment at sponsored
lunch/seminar meetings that doctors get...)

Let me know if you (or anyone) has any facts to
back up this model... there may be some busi-
ness to be done in your feedback... ;)
