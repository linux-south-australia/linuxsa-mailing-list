In a similar vein to this topic.... noted with interest the way the media is playing up the ppl who blew themselves up with

home made bombs built from plans obtained from the internet. Whilst I have nothing but sympathy for the victims & their

families, I cannot believe that the INTERNET is being blamed for this tragedy!! Heard some anti-internet comments already

from some pollies abt it!!

When I was abt 12 I made some really cool home made explosives - blew up the doghouse with them (no , the dog wasnt in it!)

The internet was not around then.... I got the plans from books I borrowed from the Public Library!!

Perhaps we should ask the pollies to also ban books!!
