Hi... hoping someone knows enough abt SQUID to help with this
problem.....

Background:
We (ISP in Mt Gambier) run SQUID-NOVM .... having a real problem with
www.hotmail.com & hotmail.com ..... bloody MS keeps setting up redirects
to other addresses... all well & good UNTIL they drop that address & use
another one... at that point any user who tries to get into
www.hotmail.com or hotmail.com will get the cached "previous address"
from our proxy server & never get to hotmail!!!!!
A "sort of fix" is that under NETSCAPE a reload usually works & you get
there eventually, M$IE's refresh option doesnt seem to work anywahere
near as well.!!!
The behaviour of M$/Hotmail is a pain in the bum & is causing high
levels of stress to some of our users :) My suggestion was yahoo or
hello :)

Apparently these redirects are part of the "magic" of win2000 or some
such thing.!!) Anyway, I want to set up squid to NEVER cache anything
with www.hotmail.com or hotmail.com  to overcome the problem.

Question(s):
In squid.conf under "TAG: no_cache " I can define ACL elements to NOT be
cached.... problem is I cannot really "play" with the settings on the
live system & do not have squid running on any of my systems...  and I
am not sure if a URL is an acceptable "ACL element" as far as squid is
concerned.

The 2 lines which are currently commented are
#acl QUERY urlpath_regex cgi-bin \?
#no_cache deny QUERY

I cant find anything terribly helpful in the docs ... what I want to do
is to uncomment the above lines & modify the second to something along
the lines of:

acl QUERY urlpath_regex  cgi-bin \?
no_cache deny www.hotmail.com
no_cache deny hotmail.com

I know that to deny, I have to specifically "deny" an element ... but...

Do I need to add something to the first line?? what the hell does the
first line really mean anyway????
Will the above 2 lines work (a) on their own  (b) with something added
to the first line

TIA, Phil
