&gt;Hi all.

Hey :)

&gt;I was asked today as to the ease of setting up an IRC server.  As this is a
&gt;new area for me I'd like to get some views from the more 'expert' among you
&gt;in this area.  The scenario was for a local one server site only, no link
&gt;to any IRC networks will be attempted at this stage.  The server will be
&gt;either Red Hat 5.x or Debian 2.1 with kernel 2.0.36.
&gt;My specific queries are as follows:
&gt;1) What packages are available (preferably .rpm and/or .deb, but not
&gt;necessary), and which should be avoided?

I've set up an IRC server on RH5.2. I used a server called Elite 1.3. Was a
dream to set up, the scripts pretty much do it all for you. Its a case of
untar it, run the ./Config script, run make, run ./makeconf and then run the
program. You don't need to do it as root (in fact, it won't let you)

&gt;2) Where to get recommended packages from?

I'll put the tar file on my public ftp directory. (Done, the URL is
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.bachblue.com.au/pub/Elite1.3.tgz">ftp://ftp.bachblue.com.au/pub/Elite1.3.tgz</A>)

&gt;2) What requirements (real .. not specified) are there?   ie. PC
&gt;requirements etc.

I'm using a 6x86-166MMX with 64Mb SDRAM and a 1.2Gb IDE hard drive. No
problems at all.

&gt;3) What warnings are there to heed?

I haven't had any problems with it.

&gt;4) How much administration time will be required once up and running?

1) Create (Update?) the ircd.MOTD file and that's about it. I haven't had to
make any changes at all

&gt;Any feedback will be appreciated.
&gt;regards ... Don

Hope that helps.

Dazz
