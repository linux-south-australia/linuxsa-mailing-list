Thank you, don't mind if I do.  :-)

&gt; 3 years?  That's a bit of a stretch.  A kick-ass computer bought today
&gt; will be somewhat inadequate running the kinds of applications we'll
&gt; be taking for granted in three years time.

I don't know.  A kick-ass computer will be somewhat less than bottom of the
line in three years time, but let's face it, a C=64 is still capable of
sending and receiving email.  ;-)  I'm not in any hurry to upgrade either
of my 90MHz pentiums; why should I?  They still work fine.  I think a three
year lifespan for a personal workstation is entirely sensible.  (And if
it's a business computer I suggest five to ten years is more like it.)

My experience with Linux has been that today's cutting edge hardware won't
work until tommorrow.  Either buy yesterday's top of the line; or look
carefully at what bleeding edge gear is supported and buy that; or buy
the most advanced equipment and hope that it's supported soon.  (The last
option is realistic, and it can even be fun to help make it so.)
