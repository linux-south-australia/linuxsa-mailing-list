&gt; and a sodomized penguin in our source tree.

Reminds me of when the seven dwarves went to visit the Pope, and Dopey
asked His Holiness if there were any Dwarven Nuns in the Vatican.  "No,"
replied His Papilty.  The other dwarves grinned.  Dopey then asked if
there were any Dwarven Nuns in Europe, to which the answer was also no.
The other dwarves started to snicker.  Pushing his luck, Dopey asked if
there were any Dwarven Nuns in the world.  By this time the Pope was
somewhat irritated by what was obviously a joke that he didn't get.
"No," he replied firmly, "there are no Dwarven Nuns here, in Europe or
anywhere at all in the whole universe." The other dwarves roared with
laughter, rolling around on the ground, crying in glee, "Dopey fucked
a penguin!  Dopey fucked a penguin!"
