I thought it was an excellent presentation (well done Simon) on a very 
interesting and slick operating system. Aqua is visually quite 
beautiful, lots of eye candy, but I suppose one would expect that from 
Apple. I was very interested to see X running on the system, although 
you'd rarely bother when you have access to Aqua.
One thing I didn't get to ask was about compiling source code, how does 
the system perform, relative to say an Athlon of similar vintage, when 
compiling source? I only have experience compiling on i386 boxes, so I 
was also wondering if there are any differences when compiling, are the 
any unique optimisations required on Apple hardware?

Cheers and thanks for a good presentation,
David Creed
