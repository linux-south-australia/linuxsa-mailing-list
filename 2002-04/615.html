&gt; But look at all the other big egos out there who have made successful

&gt; * Bill Gates (MICROSOFT)
&gt; * Richard Stallman (GNU)
&gt; * Dan Bernstein (QMAIL & DJBDNS)
&gt; * Hans Reiser (REISERFS)
&gt; * (that rude guy who runs smoothwall) (SMOOTHWALL)
&gt;
&gt; ...and not to mention Linus Torvalds himself (1). I've seen Bernstein,
&gt; Reiser and the latter person go off at people -- they are devestatingly
&gt; egotistical people who are devoted to their own causes (and sometimes to
&gt; each others) and they will be even more egotistical than even I can cope
&gt; with to further them. I think all communities need a small group of
&gt; strong, egocentric (to a certain degree) people to survive; we have that
&gt; in LinuxSA and I don't believe there's anything particularly wrong.

My God! I am truly abashed. I thought DSL was simply an arrogant, rude 
bastard! No, he is a bloody messiah! How wrong I was, he is truly up there 
with the greats! Linus, Stallman, Bernstein, DSL... Ghandi, (where will it 
end? ). Open up my eyes so that I might see. [1] He walks among us, let's 
prostrate ourselves at his feet and drink the delicious wit of his 
magnificence.

Hang on, I think I see a flaw in this logic. [2] OK, I give in, where are 
these 'successful computer products, services or ... new ideas.' Sorry, all I 
see is technogance and egopap.
