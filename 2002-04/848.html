I had a baaad experience with USB external Modem.

In the process I learned the following.

1. Many of the Rockwell based products that used to work well in linux 
were based on the ACF chipset most of these products are now available 
under the Conexant title BUT the chipset is now HCF or HSF unsupported 
chipsets which are recognised by but don't work with linux.

2. The spin of from this is that there are the External product based on 
these or using the chipset that are reported on many linux databases as 
being linux compliant that no longer are. My case in point is the USB 
Dynalink Pocket Modem which used to be linux compliant and I therefor 
ordered specifically. Only to find there was no means of getting it 
working as the chipset is now HSF 

3. Dynalink SA (The SA Distributer is the Owner of  THAT Computer Bloke  
) refuse to exchange or accept a return on modems that are not suitable 
for purpose ie cant be used with linux.
Basically I will no longer deal with him either. Despite his assurance 
that ALL external modems will work with linux. (The issue with The 
Pocket Rocket is the new chipset is controllerless and therefor needs 
specific software to run)

4. Second issue is that many of the internal modems are now in the same 
boat, and use the HCF or HSF chipset from conexant, rendering them non 
compliant with linux. I used to use the Mitsubishi Modems as a cheap 
internal linux compatable modem and they delivered great results, until 
they also changed chipset. Note they are still sold as Hardware modems.

5. There are many cheap $85 - $120 external serial modems now available 
two I have found reliable are
     Swann 56k Speed demon External Modem note. Wholesale for these is 
just under $90 including GST so talk them down where you can  
     Netcomm 56k External Meg-i-Modem. Wholesale with GST under $100

Best of luck, Personally, I now play it safe and use an external Modem
