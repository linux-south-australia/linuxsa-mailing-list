Thanks, I was rather proud of myself for it. Actually, I posted this
when the list was down, and was trying to figure out how to repost it in
mutt.. didn't seem to get it quite right.

I tried opening the attachment from my sent folder, then piping it to
`mutt linuxsa` but only after sending did I notice the subject was
missing. I also thought maybe of saving the attachment, then in a new
message to linuxsa use `:r saved-text` I think that would have turned
out better.. I wonder if there is a simpler way to do this..

&gt; Try using command mode and work out how to:
&gt; Yank lines
&gt; Paste or paste lines

I already have taught myself the ways of yank/paste, and use that when
simply moving parts of the one text file around. The mangled pasting
usually occurs when I try to paste something that I have copied from
Opera or Notepad. The ':set paste' option seems to have cleared this up
for me though.

Daniel Mundy
