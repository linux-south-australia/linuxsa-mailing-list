Thanks Michael,

I was thinking of hanging the printer directly off the samba server's
lpt port but your suggestion of:

* WINDOZE *         *     SAMBA  *         * lpd     *
*         *         *            *         * Printer *
* SMB     * SMB     *     SMB    *         *         *
* Network * ------&gt; *     shared *         *         *
* Printer *         *     print  *         *         *
*         *         * +-- queue  *         *         *
*         *         * |          * TCP/IP  *         *
*         *         * +-&gt; lpr    * ------&gt; *         *
*         *         *            *         *         *

Is also known to work well with OS/2 clients.
Lpr printing is excellent with W2k clients.
Using the add-on lpr client from Axis, lpr printing is excellent from
Win9x.

Thanks for the other tips & utilities, I now have some reading to do.

&gt;Yes.  The printer queue is still an lpr queue (or whatever type you want 
&gt;it to be) on your Unix box, however Samba can let Windows clients talk 
&gt;to it using the native Windows protocol.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not sure of the exact name of the service, but it's a standard 
&gt;Windows service you can install in the networking control panel, and 
&gt;it's available on the Windows installation media.  It's what is 
&gt;(usually) already installed when you want to share files between Windows 
&gt;hosts.

&gt;
&gt;The server will still use lpr, but the Windows workstations/desktops can 
&gt;use their own native printing mechanism.  I presume your concern 
&gt;regarding being logged in is only relevant (if at all) to when the print 
&gt;*server* is a Windows server, but I could be wrong.
&gt;
&gt;If you understand my point, and are still concerned by the robustness of 
&gt;SMB printing, you should certainly try your lpr on Windows printing. 
&gt;Have you tried this before?  Is the lpr client good?
&gt;
&gt;A tool that you might like to look at is SWAT.  It allows configuration 
&gt;of Samba via a web interface, and it *might* even allow basic 
&gt;administration of the print queue, but then there's probably options 
&gt;like this (perhaps Webmin) for managing lpr queues in a web interface. 
&gt;(Just a thought.)
&gt;
&gt;The other issue you may wish to investigate is:
&gt;provided you're using Windows 98, Windows 2000, and higher, you may 
&gt;prefer (or you may need) to enable SMB password encryption so your 
&gt;passwords are not stored and/or sent in plaintext.  I'll let you read 
&gt;about this one.
&gt;
