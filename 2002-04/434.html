Oh please....

&gt; That's a lot harsh. David, you should see this list as much for HELPING
&gt; people as it is for inflating your ego. Try to keep them in balance.

Let us not get into the "whether David helps people or not" flame war. 
My reasons are:

* you have absolutely no proof
* if you traul the mailing list archives, you will be disproved

Apart from this little piece of truth. You have CONVENIENTLY not said I 
actually did inform the person "manoj" how to unsubscribe from the list 
and also offered to tell him in a form he understood.

And just what have you or Craig done to help him?

NOTHING

Exactly how can you possibly say that flaming me helps him unsubscribe 
-- obviously he's missed automatigically appended message and you 
haven't pointed him to it.

No help at all.

So now you boast your ego by attempting to put me in place but you 
haven't helped this poor little person one bit. Not one bit.

And you accuse me of being UNBALANCED?

My null hypothesis is that I don't understand logic.

*thinks....thinks*

No that's illogical. I understand that "If Ian writes a message that 
flames David and has nothing at all to do with the subject (apart from 
automatically appended messages which clearly have not been seen or 
understood) then under Ian's definition of unbalanced, David's original 
message is obviously blanced because David's original message pertained 
to the subject, provided assistance by pointing the original poster to 
the automatically appended help and ALSO offered to translate that 
original message in a variety of forms".

*bugger*

My null hypothesis is incorrect therefore provided I haven't made one of 
the two possible errors (Brian Astil can explain them) then my null 
hypothesis is incorrect and I must be able to understand logic.

&gt; manoj: It's probably people like this that make you want to
&gt; unsubscribe... I know what you mean.

Give manoj some credit. Unlike YOU, he can probably see the tongue in 
cheek ;-P

LMFAO
