&gt; Can I just say that if you are serious about getting good quality, dont use

[snip lots of very good advice]

&gt; have fun!

Doing that!

Last night I got a set of headphones out of the shed. Been there for about 20 
years. Cut the plug off and soldered it into the cable to the sound card. 
Tried a quick cut of mono from the radio, nice signal considering the source.

This morning I am trying a cut of a classical record. Eugenia Zukerman - flute 
concertos by Bach, Stamitz and Vivaldi. This should be an interesting 
experiment. Running the Denon direct drive turntable now, with a good 
cartridge. Haven't bought a good record cleaner yet. The size of the WAV 
files is bloody huge - average about 75 Mb, 8 tracks on the album! 

Despite the good advice about not using internal sound cards, I will continue 
to use the one I have. The aim is to get a reasonable facsimile of the 
turntable-in-the-lounge-room sound, and if I can get the current quality 
signal minus rattle, hum, spit and pop, and with no audible distortion 
introduced by this process, it will do nicely. Speaking of distortion, are 
there any tips about minimising this, as far output signal level goes? In 
other words, where should I have the volume on the amp set? Feel free to 
wield the clue stick mightily here, I don't have much idea, I am flying in 
fog as far as this goes.

I am walking this process up, one step at a time. I have not yet introduced 
any noise filters. That comes next. I am still using sox on the command line 
and manually breaking at each track. I have started to have a look at GPL 
sound mixer/filter programs, and will report on list any further developments 
unless you all think this is too off-topic for this list. I am looking at a 
prog called 'audacity' as a front end. The ultimate aim is to get enough 
automation into the process, and a good enough signal, to be able to turn 
someone loose on the record collection a disk at a time a day at a time, to 
gradually convert a thirty year collection of vinyl to CD. It must be an 
enjoyable experience for a non-tech person so she doesn't get disheartened. 
It must add quality to a day, both in the creating of the resource and in the 
use of the end product.

I am glad I am using my M$-free PC to do this, there is no temptation to soil 
the linen and jump into Windoze to try things out. I am using XCDRoast to 
burn the CDs, works a treat! Isn't OS software a wondrous thing?

I have already learned lots thanks to the list. If anyone wants a hand to set 
up a cheap home-brew system to do similar, please let me know if you want a 
hand. Remember though, it's home brew quality here, not studio.

The Eugenia Zukerman CD is in the player now. There is no distortion, well, no 
clipping off the top end. It is a bit 'wooly' sounding, a bit muffled. This 
degradation is not too far off acceptable though, I am on the right track. 
The mix needs a bit of a stir. I will play with the amp a bit. Of course it 
could be the cumulative signal degradation from vinyl through 70s turntable 
through 70s amp through cheap sound card through CD burner through cheap 90s 
amp to good speakers is just too big an ask to get much better than this. 
Hmm. Jake could be right.
