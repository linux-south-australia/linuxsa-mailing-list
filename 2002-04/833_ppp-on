# Script to initiate a ppp connection. This is the first part of the
# pair of scripts. This is not a secure pair of scripts as the codes
# are visible with the 'ps' command.  However, it is simple.

# These are the parameters. Change as needed.
TELEPHONE=81045599  	                # The telephone number for the connection
#ACCOUNT=                        	# The account name for logon (as in 'George Burns')
#PASSWORD=      	                # The password for this account (and 'Gracie Allen')
#LOCAL IP=0.0.0.0	                # Local IP address if known. Dynamic = 0.0.0.0
#REMOTE IP=0.0.0.0	                # Remote IP address if desired. Normally 0.0.0.0

# This is the location of the script which dials the phone and logs
# in.  Please use the absolute file name as the $PATH variable is not

# a security hole so don't ask.)

# Initiate the connection
# 
# I put most of the common options on this command. Please, don't
# forget the 'lock' option or some programs such as mgetty will not
# work. The asyncmap and escape will permit the PPP link to work with
# a telnet or rlogin connection. You are welcome to make any changes
# as desired. Don't use the 'defaultroute' option if you currently
# have a default route to an ethernet gateway.
