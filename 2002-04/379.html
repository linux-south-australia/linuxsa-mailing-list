OK, I'm really interested as to why you would want to do most of the
things you seem to want to do here. I'm not being rude, I'm honestly
interested...

&gt; Some friends of mine are trialing a couple of SunBlade 100s 
&gt; at work. Rather than use Solaris 8 they would like to use 

OK, fair enough.

&gt; Redhat for Sparc. This is because the users in the area in 
&gt; which they wish to deploy them already have Linux knowledge 
&gt; but none with Solaris.

OK -- for a start, I'm slightly confused as to why you would want to use
low-end sparc machines, which are not good value in the scheme of things
(unless performance is simply not an issue, and funky looking hardware,
or non-intel hardware, is a bonus, in which case, they probably aren't
too bad...). Unless, of course, you wanted to run Solaris on them, in
which case, yes, they are a good, cheap Solaris platform... but for
Linux, they simply aren't great value or performance, and I would be
willing to bet, will give you no advantage over intel hardware, and
possibly some disadvantages...

... and the difference between Solaris and Linux is not _that_ much
anyway... if they're generally computer literate, it should be an easy
transition to use Solaris... Depends who they are and what they are
doing, I guess.

&gt; 
&gt; The problem is they also want to use a SunPCi II 2.2.2 card 
&gt; in each machine. The card is a 64bit PCI card that is 
&gt; essentially a computer in itself. It has an Pentium III 800, 
&gt; graphics, network, sound etc all one the one 
&gt; card. 

OK, this is where it gets really confusing for me. Why? Are they
planning to run Windows on it? Seems an awfully convoluted solution to
get Windows running within a Linux box -- why not go for intel linux and
vmware or wine or citrix, or any number of other more conventional
solutions (even windows with an X server and a linux box running
XDMCP)... what is it that you are trying to acheive? (I'm aware that it
could be something that precludes all the more conventional options, but
I'm still interested in what that is :)

&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any experiance using these before?

OK, here's where I could be useful, but unfortunately, I haven't had any
experience with them... though I ahve looked into them for thigns like
givign Solaris users access to Windows applications, and so on... they
always turned out to be less sensible than whatever other solutions, due
to the price/performance ratio (SPARCs are slow per $, and then the
cards are behind the curve and overpriced themselves... I also enquired
about doing it the other way around, so a PC user could have a SPARC as
well, but that isn't an offered solution anywhere)...

&gt; Does anyone know if they could be used with RedHat for Sparc?

I strongly doubt it. the SunPCI cards were never that popular anyway,
and I would think that most people who want Linux and some other intel
based OS would stick to x86 hardware, so I doubt anyone's developed the
drivers... They may not be that complex though (but that depends on your
skills and time -- I couldn't do it no matter how much time I had :)

&gt; I did a search on the net but could only turn up referances 
&gt; back to Solaris.

Tried asking on RH-SPARC lists? These would be the most concentrated
groups of people who would be likely to know...
