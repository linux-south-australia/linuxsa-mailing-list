&gt; Hi all, 
&gt; 
&gt; Some friends of mine are trialing a couple of SunBlade 100s at work.
&gt; Rather than use Solaris 8 they would like to use Redhat for Sparc.
&gt; This is because the users in the area in which they wish to deploy them
&gt; already have Linux knowledge but none with Solaris.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem is they also want to use a SunPCi II 2.2.2 card in each
&gt; machine.
&gt; The card is a 64bit PCI card that is essentially a computer in itself.
&gt; It has an Pentium III 800, graphics, network, sound etc all one the one 
&gt; card. 
&gt; 
&gt; Has anyone had any experiance using these before?
&gt; Does anyone know if they could be used with RedHat for Sparc?
&gt; I did a search on the net but could only turn up referances back to
&gt; Solaris.

as you say they are another complete single board (intel) computer (SBC)
so yes linux would work on them.  Your question is whether linux
for sparc supports using both "computers/OS'" at once.

In solaris it was intended for M$ "compatibility" so you run solaris
on your Sun machine and NT or something on the SBC inside the Sun.
Solaris allows you to have both running at once, the SBC OS inside
a window - much like VMware only it's not a virtual machine it's
another real one.

Personally with a modern machine like a SunBlade I would be using
solaris on it.  If you were using a linux like debian it's not too
dis-similar to solaris anyway in terms of sysadmin stuff, redhat is
wonky of course.  And if the users have linux knowledge presumably
they're not complete idiots so solaris shouldn't be too much of a step
(hell I've had cops using solaris - so it can't be that hard!!).

Dave.
