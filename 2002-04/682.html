Whoa!

&gt; &gt; So, you choose for them?  You presumptious cretin!

I believe Kirsty Rae said that about Shaun. Sitting decidedly on my
hands I'm going to say "norti Kirsty -- that's rood!".

&lt;dons full asbestos anti-flame suit&gt;

&gt; Why thanks,
&gt; Yes, I give Linux computers to dis-advantaged people. Most of the
&gt; recipients have never heard of Linux and many have no desktop experience
&gt; at all.

Yes, Computerbank if I recall. Do you need ancient hard drives (i.e.
perfectly good 0.5Gb drives and crap)?

&gt; I would rather teach them Linux skills using our own people, than risk
&gt; them being slammed on this list.

If you've ever seen me speak to someone -- off list -- you'll hear me
say something to the effect of "LinuxSA can be a fairly feisty group.
Don't take offense if someone seems to insult you at first, just pick
the advice out of the e-mail and run with it.". Given the chance, I'd
like to put each and every subscriber through a "How To Be a List
Member" which would include such wisdom as:

* if you get flamed by a list elder, don't get upset, wait and get even

;-P

&gt; How would you treat a blind person asking for assistance on this list- I
&gt; am afraid to even imagine what you would say to them.

Provided the subject had nothing to do with "how to interact with Linux
and be blind" then it's unlikely that we'd be able to even "tell" that
it's a blind person talking. Unless, of course, they failed to comment
on the pretty LinuxSA Animated GIF we'd included with their e-mail in
HTML by reply &lt;lol&gt;.
