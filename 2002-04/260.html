Maybe something like rpm -Fdep or something

ie. freshen and satisfy dependencies only of those that are being
'freshened'.

Subject: RPM dependencies and RedHat Advisories... rant


&gt; If Redhat insist on using a package management tool which sucks, I which
they
&gt; would at least tell you how to get around the problems in their
advisories.
&gt;
&gt; When they released the updated version of the printconf tools, they added
Omni
&gt; to the dependencies of ghostview.  In their advisory
&gt; (<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-138.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-138.html</A>) it said to
download
&gt; all the RPMs and run 'rpm -Fvh [filenames]'.  But if you don't have Omni
&gt; installed then it doesn't work as 'rpm -F' will only update packages which
are
&gt; already installed.  The default 7.2 install didn't install Omni so all of
my
&gt; work machines failed if I followed the advisory instructions.  In this
case it
&gt; was simple to overcome by installing Omni first, so why doesn't the
advisory
&gt; say this??
&gt;
&gt; This happened again when they released new RPM RPMs recently.
&gt;   <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHEA-2002-024.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHEA-2002-024.html</A>
&gt; except this time the solution was far from clear.
&gt;
&gt; How are newbies suppose to do this when even the instructions from the
vendor
&gt; are not clear?  Do they have to use Redhat's up2date and ignore the
advisories?
&gt;
&gt; It also seems to me that RPM needs another, option similar to freshen
'-F',
&gt; which installs packages which aren't installed but are required to be
installed
&gt; by packages which _are_ being upgraded. eg. Omni is not installed but is
&gt; required by the new version of ghostscript (which is install) so install
it
&gt; anyway.  Does anything like this exist?
&gt;
&gt; Regards,
&gt; Michael
