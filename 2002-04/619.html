&gt; But you can also do:

&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
&gt; 
&gt; char *c[127];
&gt; sprintf((char *)c, "Hello World!\n");
&gt; printf("%s", c);
&gt; return 0;
&gt; 
&gt; }
&gt; 	
&gt; Now the cast indicates that "c" does make reference to some memory 
&gt; location. Without the cast gcc complains about the pointer being an 
&gt; incompatible type.

Ummm...

I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong (my C is a bit rusty),
but...

Doesn't char *c[127] define an array of 127 pointers to chars?

Therefore your sprintf is going to store "Hello World!\n" inside the
first 3.25 pointers (assuming your pointers are 4 bytes wide)?  That
really isn't what you want, I'm sure.  On Intel x86, c[0] will become
a pointer to 0x6c6c6548 ('lleH'), c[1] will be a pointer to 0x6f57206f
('oW o'), etc.

No wonder it complains about an incompatible type -- sprintf wants to
print into an array of characters, not an array of pointers :-).

&gt; However, the next line says "read and display characters starting from 
&gt; the contents of the memory location starting at the appropriate variable 
&gt; (in our case c) and stop at NULL". Which implies that c is actually 
&gt; pointing to a memory location OR that printf knows what to do about it.
&gt; 
&gt; *I don't know which is true or why*

I always think of it as "the name of an array is a pointer to that
array".  The array isn't a pointer itself, but when you use the name
of an array in an expression, you'll get a pointer to the first
element of that array.  Consider char c[127] -- 'c' is an array, not a
pointer, but if you say printf("%s", c), then printf gets sent a
pointer to that array.  Similarly, you could do:

char c[127];
char *d;
d = c;
...and d would end up pointing to the first element of c.

Then this:

printf("%s", c);

or this:

printf("%s", d);

would produce the same result (because printf would get a pointer to
the same location).

You couldn't do 'c = d' though -- the bit about 'in an expression'
only applies to the RHS of an expression.
