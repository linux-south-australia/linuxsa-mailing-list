By the looks of things we have common ground.
Lets shoot David :)

Seriously - I contacted the helpdesk, the desk was more helpful (:O) but I
am waiting on a call back from level 2 support damn I want level 3!!!

I suspect it is something in my pppoe setup which is different to what
Inode expect. 

I will be posting my errors to freesco board and the guy who setup the
pppoe will look so hopefully a solution will come out of it. Once it does
it may shed some light on the issue generally.

&gt;Why go out and buy bread when you can grow some Wheat, Crush it and make
&gt;your own
&gt;
&gt;Products like Smoothwall are very easy to set up and it spreads knowledge of
&gt;Linux. Surely this is a good thing. I've got 3 friends with Telstra Cable
&gt;who would NEVER EVER have had anything to do with Linux if it wasn't for
&gt;Smoothwall. Whilst they primarily don't do too much else at least they know
&gt;Linux exists now and runs on "obsolete hardware" and does a bloody good job
&gt;of protecting their Internal Windows Network.
&gt;
&gt;My own Smoothwall box has worked flawlessly for 12 months on Telstra ADSL
&gt;and the problem I'm having now that I've gone to Internode is annoying but
&gt;minor. The "Problem" has to be something that has occurred as a result of
&gt;going to Internode and I'd like to think that a solution can be found rather
&gt;than saying " Don't use Smoothwall "
&gt;
&gt;and Yes..I have contacted both Simon, Internode Helpdesk and Smoothwall IRC
&gt;support and thus far no-one has any answers. I was hoping that one of the
&gt;"so called gurus" that frequent this mailing list might have some
&gt;constructive suggestions on finding what the problem is.
&gt;
&gt;I really don't cherish the thought of advising prospective ADSL users that
&gt;they should have a Firewall setup, but you must either
&gt;
&gt;   a) Learn how to set up and secure FreeBSD/Debian/Other linux from scratch
&gt;or b) Install WinRoute or similar
&gt;
&gt;my Tuesday Afternoon rant..

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The answer, Evan, is to install Debian/FreeBSD or whatever
&gt;&gt; and configure
&gt;&gt; it yourself ;-)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; *all these weenies expecting other people to build their
&gt;&gt; damned firewalls*
