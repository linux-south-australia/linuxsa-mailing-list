The requesting machine requests an IP. What is going on should be logged
to /var/log/messages.

EG:

Mar 12 10:44:13 adsl dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 10.3.255.252 from
00:d0:59:2e:56:b7 (c1844) via eth2
Mar 12 10:44:13 adsl dhcpd: DHCPACK on 10.3.255.252 to 00:d0:59:2e:56:b7
(c1844) via eth2

However, if you want a particular IP for your machine each time,
consider using static IPs via DHCP. A clause like so in your
/etc/dhcpd.conf should do it:

# User Name
host hostname {
    hardware ethernet 00:50:BA:76:eb:30;  
    fixed-address 10.0.1.51;
}

&gt; Can anyone shed light on the following problem
&gt; 
&gt; Setup is as follows
&gt; DHCP Server : Smoothwall ( Linux ) with scope 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.0.30
&gt; Client PC : Win2K
&gt; 
&gt; I've got Port forwarding set up on Smoothwall box to go to 10.0.0.10 which
&gt; is the address that the Win2K PC usually gets. Problem is I had my PC round
&gt; at a friends house on weekend. His DHCP server has range 10.0.0.20 -
&gt; 10.0.0.40 so my Win2K PC grabbed .20 and is now stuck with it.
&gt; 
&gt; Now DHCP is supposed to give out the same address if it free but how do I
&gt; override it. Is it the Win2K box that is requesting the same address ( even
&gt; if it is released ) or is it the Linux Box giving that address because
&gt; that's what it had before.
&gt; 
&gt; My work around was to change my scope to 10.0.0.10 - 10.0.0.11 and then
&gt; release/renew my Win2K box but there must be a better way.
